we all remember being those kids and I

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.660 
we all remember being those kids and I

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
model I met and they didn't have five

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.069 
model I met and they didn't have five
seconds<00:00:32.700> for<00:00:32.850> me<00:00:32.880> I<00:00:33.149> remember<00:00:33.600> I<00:00:33.660> met<00:00:33.840> somebody

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
seconds for me I remember I met somebody

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.600 
seconds for me I remember I met somebody
who<00:00:34.260> had<00:00:34.440> that<00:00:34.620> five<00:00:34.800> seconds<00:00:35.219> and<00:00:35.309> how<00:00:35.430> much

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
who had that five seconds and how much

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.380 
who had that five seconds and how much
that<00:00:35.790> extra<00:00:36.860> little<00:00:37.860> little<00:00:38.550> bit<00:00:38.790> meant<00:00:39.149> to<00:00:39.300> me

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
that extra little little bit meant to me

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.819 
that extra little little bit meant to me
made<00:00:39.600> me<00:00:39.719> believe<00:00:39.899> that<00:00:40.079> I<00:00:40.290> could<00:00:40.500> do<00:00:40.590> anything

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
made me believe that I could do anything

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.229 
made me believe that I could do anything
and<00:00:41.100> I<00:00:41.190> think<00:00:41.370> for<00:00:41.520> us<00:00:41.670> when<00:00:41.879> we<00:00:41.910> go<00:00:42.120> out<00:00:42.180> there

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
and I think for us when we go out there

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:43.670 
and I think for us when we go out there
with<00:00:42.450> these<00:00:42.570> kids<00:00:42.840> it's<00:00:43.020> important<00:00:43.440> for<00:00:43.500> us<00:00:43.559> to

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
with these kids it's important for us to

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.950 
with these kids it's important for us to
to<00:00:44.370> remember<00:00:44.850> that<00:00:45.030> and<00:00:45.210> I<00:00:45.270> think<00:00:45.510> everyone<00:00:45.930> on

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
to remember that and I think everyone on

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.930 
to remember that and I think everyone on
this<00:00:46.170> team<00:00:46.230> gets<00:00:46.649> that<00:00:46.829> we<00:00:47.219> get<00:00:47.489> that<00:00:47.670> what<00:00:47.850> it

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
this team gets that we get that what it

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.430 
this team gets that we get that what it
means<00:00:48.120> like<00:00:48.239> signing<00:00:48.629> oh<00:00:48.719> gosh<00:00:48.930> it's<00:00:49.140> not<00:00:49.260> just

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
means like signing oh gosh it's not just

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.690 
means like signing oh gosh it's not just
sign<00:00:49.590> your<00:00:49.620> name<00:00:49.800> it's<00:00:50.039> that<00:00:50.129> moment<00:00:50.340> with<00:00:50.610> the

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
sign your name it's that moment with the

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.490 
sign your name it's that moment with the
child<00:00:50.940> and<00:00:51.210> that<00:00:51.239> moment<00:00:52.110> to<00:00:52.170> make<00:00:52.320> them

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
child and that moment to make them

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.170 
child and that moment to make them
believe<00:00:52.620> that<00:00:52.800> hey<00:00:53.039> you<00:00:53.100> two<00:00:53.489> can<00:00:53.699> do<00:00:53.820> this<00:00:53.969> and

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
believe that hey you two can do this and

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.580 
believe that hey you two can do this and
you<00:00:54.239> two<00:00:54.420> can<00:00:54.449> be<00:00:54.690> out<00:00:54.809> there<00:00:54.960> so<00:00:55.110> it's<00:00:55.230> special

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
you two can be out there so it's special

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:05.000 
you two can be out there so it's special
every<00:00:55.770> time<00:01:00.530> I<00:01:02.629> think<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:04.049> added<00:01:04.290> pressure<00:01:04.470> is

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
every time I think the added pressure is

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.190 
every time I think the added pressure is
from<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.909> whole<00:01:06.090> country<00:01:06.479> because<00:01:06.750> we<00:01:07.020> know

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
from the whole country because we know

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.240 
from the whole country because we know
they're<00:01:07.380> going<00:01:07.500> to<00:01:07.560> be<00:01:07.650> washing<00:01:07.979> because<00:01:08.159> they

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
they're going to be washing because they

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.950 
they're going to be washing because they
