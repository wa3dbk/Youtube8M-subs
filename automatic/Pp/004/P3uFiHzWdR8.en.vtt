BetVictor um I think I think you really
excited<00:01:44.939> I<00:01:45.030> think<00:01:45.240> nya<00:01:45.450> Tina<00:01:45.840> as<00:01:46.110> it's<00:01:46.380> a

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
excited I think nya Tina as it's a

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:47.690 
excited I think nya Tina as it's a
semi-final<00:01:47.040> the<00:01:47.100> chance<00:01:47.340> to<00:01:47.399> get<00:01:47.460> to<00:01:47.610> the

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
semi-final the chance to get to the

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.219 
semi-final the chance to get to the
final<00:01:48.090> you<00:01:48.390> all<00:01:48.479> want<00:01:48.600> to<00:01:48.659> give<00:01:48.780> anything<00:01:49.049> away

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
final you all want to give anything away

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.380 
final you all want to give anything away
so<00:01:49.409> I'm<00:01:49.590> really<00:01:49.799> not<00:01:50.009> sure<00:01:50.070> what<00:01:51.060> we<00:01:51.210> try

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
so I'm really not sure what we try

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:52.370 
so I'm really not sure what we try
together<00:01:51.570> I<00:01:51.930> think<00:01:51.960> it<00:01:52.170> could<00:01:52.259> be<00:01:52.350> really

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
together I think it could be really

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.410 
together I think it could be really
tight<00:01:52.740> game<00:01:53.009> okay<00:01:53.729> what<00:01:54.090> are<00:01:54.119> you<00:01:54.210> then<00:01:54.299> be

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
tight game okay what are you then be

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.030 
tight game okay what are you then be
more<00:01:54.600> tempted<00:01:54.780> maybe<00:01:55.079> to<00:01:55.200> do<00:01:55.409> both<00:01:55.590> teams<00:01:55.860> to

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
more tempted maybe to do both teams to

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.609 
more tempted maybe to do both teams to
score<00:01:56.070> and<00:01:56.549> no<00:01:56.939> I<00:01:57.360> think<00:01:57.810> I<00:01:58.049> could<00:01:58.259> be<00:01:58.409> I<00:01:58.439> think

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
score and no I think I could be I think

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.260 
score and no I think I could be I think
if<00:01:58.979> we're<00:01:59.189> gonna<00:01:59.310> argue<00:01:59.460> with<00:01:59.610> this<00:01:59.969> they'll

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
if we're gonna argue with this they'll

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.420 
if we're gonna argue with this they'll
make<00:02:00.479> it<00:02:00.630> one<00:02:00.780> nail<00:02:01.049> so<00:02:01.710> yeah<00:02:01.890> maybe<00:02:02.070> probably

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
make it one nail so yeah maybe probably

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.670 
make it one nail so yeah maybe probably
bet<00:02:02.700> about<00:02:02.909> that<00:02:03.149> okay<00:02:03.840> what<00:02:04.320> else<00:02:04.439> should<00:02:04.619> we

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680
