00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.919 
of had enough already in the 12th minute
and<00:02:07.469> he<00:02:07.860> ends<00:02:08.069> up<00:02:08.129> rage<00:02:08.369> quitting<00:02:08.789> so<00:02:09.690> we<00:02:09.810> get

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
and he ends up rage quitting so we get

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.680 
and he ends up rage quitting so we get
that<00:02:10.080> quick<00:02:10.259> and<00:02:10.440> easy<00:02:10.590> win<00:02:10.890> not<00:02:11.640> too<00:02:11.819> bad<00:02:12.000> I

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
that quick and easy win not too bad I

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.280 
that quick and easy win not too bad I
was

the comments and i saw a funny comment
there's<00:02:16.590> like<00:02:17.060> it's<00:02:18.060> it<00:02:18.269> I<00:02:18.450> think<00:02:18.659> it's<00:02:18.780> a<00:02:18.870> trip

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.009 
there's like it's it I think it's a trip
Scruggs<00:02:19.920> or<00:02:20.159> something<00:02:20.489> like<00:02:20.640> cuz<00:02:21.569> Scruggs

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:22.019 
Scruggs or something like cuz Scruggs

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:24.349 
Scruggs or something like cuz Scruggs
they've<00:02:22.260> been<00:02:22.469> so<00:02:22.709> busy<00:02:22.980> lately<00:02:23.189> I<00:02:23.549> know<00:02:23.700> they

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:24.359 
they've been so busy lately I know they

00:02:24.359 --> 00:02:27.440 
they've been so busy lately I know they
have<00:02:24.569> to<00:02:25.170> do<00:02:25.709> shadowing<00:02:26.370> of<00:02:26.489> doctors<00:02:27.060> and<00:02:27.329> all

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
have to do shadowing of doctors and all

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.750 
have to do shadowing of doctors and all
this<00:02:27.659> they<00:02:27.959> have<00:02:28.469> been<00:02:28.680> so<00:02:28.920> busy<00:02:29.099> but<00:02:29.430> I<00:02:29.519> think

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
this they have been so busy but I think

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.539 
this they have been so busy but I think
spring<00:02:30.390> breaks<00:02:30.629> coming<00:02:30.720> up<00:02:31.049> and<00:02:31.319> maybe<00:02:32.189> a<00:02:32.280> week

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:32.549 
spring breaks coming up and maybe a week

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:34.250 
spring breaks coming up and maybe a week
or<00:02:32.700> two<00:02:32.879> so<00:02:32.909> we'll<00:02:33.750> definitely<00:02:34.049> have<00:02:34.230> some

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
or two so we'll definitely have some

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:35.569 
or two so we'll definitely have some
time<00:02:34.590> maybe<00:02:34.769> we<00:02:34.920> can<00:02:35.099> make<00:02:35.189> a<00:02:35.250> couple<00:02:35.459> of

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:35.579 
time maybe we can make a couple of

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:38.059 
time maybe we can make a couple of
videos<00:02:35.819> together<00:02:36.000> or<00:02:36.269> something<00:02:36.390> but<00:02:37.170> until

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
videos together or something but until

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:40.569 
videos together or something but until
then<00:02:38.400> they've<00:02:38.640> just<00:02:38.849> been<00:02:39.000> crazy<00:02:39.209> busy<00:02:39.599> so

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:40.579 
then they've just been crazy busy so

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:43.280 
then they've just been crazy busy so
yeah<00:02:41.579> that's<00:02:41.730> that<00:02:42.120> was<00:02:42.719> pretty<00:02:42.840> funny<00:02:43.079> just

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
yeah that's that was pretty funny just

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.369 
yeah that's that was pretty funny just
seeing<00:02:43.500> our<00:02:43.889> IP<00:02:44.400> Scruggs<00:02:44.849> so<00:02:45.150> um<00:02:45.510> right<00:02:46.200> here

00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:46.379 
seeing our IP Scruggs so um right here

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:47.660 
seeing our IP Scruggs so um right here
we<00:02:46.590> need<00:02:46.680> a<00:02:46.739> contract<00:02:47.220> for<00:02:47.340> our<00:02:47.430> center

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
we need a contract for our center

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.369 
we need a contract for our center
midfielder<00:02:48.090> that<00:02:48.239> was<00:02:48.329> a<00:02:48.359> silver<00:02:48.629> but<00:02:49.049> I<00:02:49.170> just

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:49.379 
midfielder that was a silver but I just

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:52.099 
midfielder that was a silver but I just
decided<00:02:49.590> to<00:02:49.769> go<00:02:49.889> get<00:02:50.129> Seedorf<00:02:50.730> 300<00:02:51.689> coins<00:02:51.870> i

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:52.109 
decided to go get Seedorf 300 coins i

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:53.659 
decided to go get Seedorf 300 coins i
figure<00:02:52.379> i<00:02:52.409> can<00:02:52.470> probably<00:02:52.799> sell<00:02:53.069> them<00:02:53.189> for<00:02:53.370> even

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:53.669 
figure i can probably sell them for even

00:02:53.669 --> 00:02:55.580 
figure i can probably sell them for even
what<00:02:54.510> I<00:02:54.540> bottom<00:02:54.840> for<00:02:55.019> maybe<00:02:55.230> a<00:02:55.319> little<00:02:55.409> bit

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
what I bottom for maybe a little bit

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.179 
what I bottom for maybe a little bit
more<00:02:55.799> he<00:02:56.250> has<00:02:56.370> forced<00:02:56.669> our<00:02:56.760> skills<00:02:57.530> 54<00:02:58.530> pace<00:02:58.889> I

00:02:59.179 --> 00:02:59.189 
more he has forced our skills 54 pace I

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:01.190 
more he has forced our skills 54 pace I
believe<00:02:59.519> that's<00:03:00.450> probably<00:03:00.810> as<00:03:00.930> big<00:03:01.049> as

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
believe that's probably as big as

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.349 
believe that's probably as big as
negative<00:03:01.620> but<00:03:01.889> his<00:03:02.040> passing<00:03:02.609> is<00:03:02.730> pretty

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:03.359 
negative but his passing is pretty

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:05.210 
negative but his passing is pretty
incredible<00:03:03.510> at<00:03:03.930> 86<00:03:04.470> so<00:03:04.680> you<00:03:04.739> can<00:03:04.950> pretty<00:03:05.129> much

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
incredible at 86 so you can pretty much

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.250 
incredible at 86 so you can pretty much
expect<00:03:05.459> where<00:03:06.000> wherever<00:03:06.689> you<00:03:06.810> want<00:03:07.019> the<00:03:07.109> ball

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
expect where wherever you want the ball

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.460 
expect where wherever you want the ball
to<00:03:07.290> go<00:03:07.409> it'll<00:03:07.739> go<00:03:07.859> there<00:03:08.099> this<00:03:09.030> next<00:03:09.470> opponent

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
to go it'll go there this next opponent

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.159 
to go it'll go there this next opponent
another<00:03:11.280> one<00:03:11.549> with<00:03:11.849> 900<00:03:12.450> chemistry<00:03:12.840> I'll<00:03:12.930> take

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:13.169 
another one with 900 chemistry I'll take

00:03:13.169 --> 00:03:15.890 
another one with 900 chemistry I'll take
that<00:03:13.319> any<00:03:13.379> day<00:03:13.620> and<00:03:14.010> he<00:03:14.700> comes<00:03:15.239> so<00:03:15.480> close<00:03:15.659> by

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
that any day and he comes so close by

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.710 
that any day and he comes so close by
hitting<00:03:16.200> the<00:03:16.459> the<00:03:17.459> post<00:03:17.909> right<00:03:18.209> there<00:03:18.449> and

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
hitting the the post right there and

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.199 
hitting the the post right there and
then<00:03:18.930> I<00:03:19.229> just<00:03:20.010> come<00:03:20.250> right<00:03:20.489> back<00:03:20.760> and<00:03:21.060> this

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
then I just come right back and this

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:23.390 
then I just come right back and this
could<00:03:21.389> be<00:03:21.540> pretty<00:03:21.720> devastating<00:03:22.019> if<00:03:22.889> you<00:03:23.159> just

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
could be pretty devastating if you just

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.789 
could be pretty devastating if you just
get<00:03:23.940> so<00:03:24.150> close<00:03:24.329> to<00:03:24.569> scoring<00:03:24.840> and<00:03:25.169> then<00:03:25.290> I<00:03:25.530> just

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 
get so close to scoring and then I just

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:27.649 
get so close to scoring and then I just
come<00:03:25.979> back<00:03:26.099> the<00:03:26.280> other<00:03:26.340> way<00:03:26.489> with<00:03:26.790> a<00:03:27.000> gold<00:03:27.419> and

00:03:27.649 --> 00:03:27.659 
come back the other way with a gold and

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:29.300 
come back the other way with a gold and
lens<00:03:28.290> has<00:03:28.500> just<00:03:28.739> been<00:03:28.889> picking<00:03:29.220> apart

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
lens has just been picking apart

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.159 
lens has just been picking apart
defenses<00:03:30.000> he's<00:03:30.180> been<00:03:30.389> incredible<00:03:30.599> really

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:31.169 
defenses he's been incredible really

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:33.140 
defenses he's been incredible really
he's<00:03:31.680> got<00:03:31.859> like<00:03:31.979> 88<00:03:32.310> pace<00:03:32.639> so<00:03:32.849> if<00:03:32.940> you<00:03:33.030> guys

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
he's got like 88 pace so if you guys

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.300 
he's got like 88 pace so if you guys
haven't<00:03:33.359> tried<00:03:33.599> him<00:03:33.750> out<00:03:33.810> you<00:03:34.680> might<00:03:34.979> want<00:03:35.250> to

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
haven't tried him out you might want to

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.729 
haven't tried him out you might want to
try<00:03:35.459> Outlands<00:03:36.030> I<00:03:36.150> know<00:03:36.479> he's<00:03:36.690> only<00:03:36.810> 78<00:03:37.260> overall

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
try Outlands I know he's only 78 overall

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:40.909 
try Outlands I know he's only 78 overall
but<00:03:38.540> he's<00:03:39.540> got<00:03:39.840> some<00:03:39.989> pretty<00:03:40.199> good<00:03:40.319> stats<00:03:40.620> and

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:40.919 
but he's got some pretty good stats and

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:42.830 
but he's got some pretty good stats and
he<00:03:41.040> is<00:03:41.129> the<00:03:41.310> upgraded<00:03:41.430> version<00:03:41.819> so<00:03:42.329> I<00:03:42.569> think

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
he is the upgraded version so I think

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.920 
he is the upgraded version so I think
there's<00:03:43.199> a<00:03:43.260> 76<00:03:44.129> overall<00:03:44.519> on<00:03:44.639> a<00:03:44.699> 78<00:03:45.180> /<00:03:45.510> also<00:03:45.780> make

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
there's a 76 overall on a 78 / also make

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:47.750 
there's a 76 overall on a 78 / also make
sure<00:03:45.959> to<00:03:46.109> get<00:03:46.260> that<00:03:46.319> 78<00:03:46.949> overall<00:03:47.370> if<00:03:47.489> you<00:03:47.579> do

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
sure to get that 78 overall if you do

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.430 
sure to get that 78 overall if you do
try<00:03:48.060> them<00:03:48.150> out<00:03:48.239> and<00:03:48.419> if<00:03:48.780> you<00:03:48.870> do<00:03:49.019> try<00:03:49.229> them<00:03:49.349> out

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
try them out and if you do try them out

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:50.899 
try them out and if you do try them out
let<00:03:49.650> me<00:03:49.709> know<00:03:49.799> what<00:03:49.949> you<00:03:50.069> think<00:03:50.220> because<00:03:50.459> I

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
think he's actually a really good player

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.699 
think he's actually a really good player

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
amazing skill run from jermaine lens but

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:13.429 
amazing skill run from jermaine lens but
Huntelaar<00:04:12.389> just<00:04:12.659> cleans<00:04:12.900> it<00:04:13.019> up<00:04:13.109> off<00:04:13.319> the

00:04:13.429 --> 00:04:13.439 
Huntelaar just cleans it up off the

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:15.949 
Huntelaar just cleans it up off the
deflection<00:04:13.819> and<00:04:14.819> this<00:04:15.060> squad<00:04:15.329> is<00:04:15.359> really

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
deflection and this squad is really

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:17.509 
deflection and this squad is really
turning<00:04:16.139> out<00:04:16.320> to<00:04:16.380> be<00:04:16.470> pretty<00:04:16.680> decent<00:04:17.159> only<00:04:17.310> one

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
turning out to be pretty decent only one

turning out to be pretty decent only one
loss<00:04:17.729> so<00:04:17.909> far<00:04:17.940> and<00:04:18.359> I<00:04:19.199> really<00:04:20.039> I<00:04:20.250> don't<00:04:20.609> feel

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
loss so far and I really I don't feel

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:21.979 
loss so far and I really I don't feel
like<00:04:20.909> I<00:04:21.030> can<00:04:21.090> lose<00:04:21.359> against<00:04:21.659> some<00:04:21.810> of<00:04:21.930> these

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
like I can lose against some of these

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:24.290 
like I can lose against some of these

00:04:40.189 --> 00:04:40.199 
nice little skill run from Huntelaar he

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:41.899 
nice little skill run from Huntelaar he
doesn't<00:04:40.530> have<00:04:40.650> three<00:04:40.860> star<00:04:41.069> skills<00:04:41.370> but

00:04:41.899 --> 00:04:41.909 
doesn't have three star skills but

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:44.420 
doesn't have three star skills but
managed<00:04:42.300> to<00:04:42.360> do<00:04:42.569> something<00:04:42.930> with<00:04:43.050> it<00:04:43.080> and<00:04:44.069> just

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:44.430

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110 
puts a right past the goalie my opponent

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:47.869 
puts a right past the goalie my opponent
was<00:04:46.199> defending<00:04:46.919> pretty<00:04:47.099> poorly<00:04:47.370> just<00:04:47.699> kind<00:04:47.849> of

00:04:47.869 --> 00:04:47.879 
was defending pretty poorly just kind of

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:51.439 
was defending pretty poorly just kind of
running<00:04:48.150> at<00:04:48.389> me<00:04:48.539> um<00:04:49.220> just<00:04:50.220> with<00:04:50.520> no<00:04:50.550> urgency

00:04:51.439 --> 00:04:51.449 
running at me um just with no urgency

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:53.960 
running at me um just with no urgency
really<00:04:51.930> um<00:04:52.259> so<00:04:52.770> Huntelaar<00:04:53.250> with<00:04:53.430> a<00:04:53.460> nine-point

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:53.970 
really um so Huntelaar with a nine-point

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:55.279 
really um so Huntelaar with a nine-point
a<00:04:54.060> trade<00:04:54.300> right<00:04:54.509> there<00:04:54.690> just<00:04:54.900> looking<00:04:54.990> at<00:04:55.199> some

00:04:55.279 --> 00:04:55.289 
a trade right there just looking at some

00:04:55.289 --> 00:04:58.100 
a trade right there just looking at some
of<00:04:55.349> the<00:04:55.470> stats<00:04:55.740> and<00:04:56.699> I<00:04:57.300> think<00:04:57.509> with<00:04:57.629> this<00:04:57.810> win

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:58.110 
of the stats and I think with this win

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:00.469 
of the stats and I think with this win
we<00:04:58.409> are<00:04:58.680> like<00:04:58.979> one<00:04:59.250> point<00:04:59.520> away<00:04:59.669> from<00:04:59.789> the

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:00.479 
we are like one point away from the

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:03.320 
we are like one point away from the
division<00:05:01.169> three<00:05:01.500> and<00:05:01.770> the<00:05:02.159> title<00:05:02.610> I<00:05:02.759> think

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:03.330 
division three and the title I think

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:05.029 
division three and the title I think
when<00:05:03.509> we<00:05:03.629> win<00:05:03.810> this<00:05:03.990> title<00:05:04.259> we<00:05:04.500> might<00:05:04.680> get<00:05:04.860> like

00:05:05.029 --> 00:05:05.039 
when we win this title we might get like

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:06.890 
when we win this title we might get like
three<00:05:05.460> or<00:05:05.580> four<00:05:05.639> thousand<00:05:06.180> coins<00:05:06.300> I'm<00:05:06.569> not<00:05:06.750> too

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:06.900 
three or four thousand coins I'm not too

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:08.869 
three or four thousand coins I'm not too
sure<00:05:07.110> and<00:05:07.379> if<00:05:07.830> you<00:05:07.919> guys<00:05:08.039> can<00:05:08.219> if<00:05:08.460> you<00:05:08.550> guys<00:05:08.699> see

00:05:08.869 --> 00:05:08.879 
sure and if you guys can if you guys see

00:05:08.879 --> 00:05:11.300 
sure and if you guys can if you guys see
right<00:05:09.000> here<00:05:09.229> why<00:05:10.229> put<00:05:10.440> Phil<00:05:10.680> Haines<00:05:10.860> and<00:05:10.889> who<00:05:11.280> I

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:11.310 
right here why put Phil Haines and who I

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:12.950 
right here why put Phil Haines and who I
still<00:05:11.849> think<00:05:12.060> so<00:05:12.180> really<00:05:12.360> good<00:05:12.629> player<00:05:12.780> I'll

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:12.960 
still think so really good player I'll

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:14.149 
still think so really good player I'll
probably<00:05:13.080> keep<00:05:13.319> him<00:05:13.469> in<00:05:13.590> the<00:05:13.680> squad<00:05:13.770> for<00:05:14.129> a

00:05:14.149 --> 00:05:14.159 
probably keep him in the squad for a

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:15.499 
probably keep him in the squad for a
little<00:05:14.310> bit<00:05:14.490> but<00:05:15.000> I'm<00:05:15.120> rolling<00:05:15.479> with

00:05:15.499 --> 00:05:15.509 
little bit but I'm rolling with

00:05:15.509 --> 00:05:17.149 
little bit but I'm rolling with
Huntelaar<00:05:16.080> I<00:05:16.110> think<00:05:16.409> he's<00:05:16.560> been<00:05:16.860> playing<00:05:17.039> a

00:05:17.149 --> 00:05:17.159 
Huntelaar I think he's been playing a

00:05:17.159 --> 00:05:19.999 
Huntelaar I think he's been playing a
lot<00:05:17.430> better<00:05:17.639> than<00:05:17.940> el<00:05:18.060> kebir<00:05:18.479> el<00:05:18.900> kebir<00:05:19.349> I<00:05:19.530> mean

00:05:19.999 --> 00:05:20.009 
lot better than el kebir el kebir I mean

00:05:20.009 --> 00:05:23.510 
lot better than el kebir el kebir I mean
15<00:05:20.550> overall<00:05:20.849> rating<00:05:21.389> points<00:05:21.780> 85<00:05:22.169> and<00:05:22.440> 70<00:05:22.889> my

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 
15 overall rating points 85 and 70 my

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:26.510 
15 overall rating points 85 and 70 my
thought<00:05:23.759> Huntelaar<00:05:24.180> space<00:05:24.479> was<00:05:24.780> gonna<00:05:25.520> mess

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:26.520 
thought Huntelaar space was gonna mess

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.279 
thought Huntelaar space was gonna mess
him<00:05:26.639> up<00:05:26.789> or<00:05:27.060> I<00:05:27.300> thought<00:05:27.629> his<00:05:27.750> pace<00:05:27.990> was<00:05:28.169> going

00:05:28.279 --> 00:05:28.289 
him up or I thought his pace was going

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:29.659 
him up or I thought his pace was going
to<00:05:28.349> bring<00:05:28.440> him<00:05:28.560> down<00:05:28.590> a<00:05:28.770> little<00:05:28.860> bit<00:05:29.159> but

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:29.669 
to bring him down a little bit but

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:31.430 
to bring him down a little bit but
honestly<00:05:30.029> I<00:05:30.120> haven't<00:05:30.389> really<00:05:30.690> seen<00:05:30.900> too<00:05:31.259> big

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:31.440 
honestly I haven't really seen too big

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:32.959 
honestly I haven't really seen too big
of<00:05:31.529> a<00:05:31.590> difference<00:05:31.770> in<00:05:32.069> the<00:05:32.159> pace<00:05:32.340> he<00:05:32.580> seems<00:05:32.789> to

00:05:32.959 --> 00:05:32.969 
of a difference in the pace he seems to

00:05:32.969 --> 00:05:35.600 
of a difference in the pace he seems to
be<00:05:33.199> running<00:05:34.199> pretty<00:05:34.529> good<00:05:34.800> out<00:05:34.979> there<00:05:35.009> so<00:05:35.580> and

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:35.610 
be running pretty good out there so and

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:37.309 
be running pretty good out there so and
he's<00:05:35.969> cleaning<00:05:36.240> up<00:05:36.419> pretty<00:05:36.659> much<00:05:36.840> everything

00:05:37.309 --> 00:05:37.319 
he's cleaning up pretty much everything

00:05:37.319 --> 00:05:39.170 
he's cleaning up pretty much everything
right<00:05:37.500> here<00:05:37.680> I<00:05:37.710> get<00:05:37.889> a<00:05:38.099> little<00:05:38.370> fortunate<00:05:38.909> lens
