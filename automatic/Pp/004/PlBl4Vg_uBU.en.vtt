frankly<00:05:33.620> if<00:05:33.919> you're<00:05:34.099> an<00:05:34.220> older<00:05:34.639> person<00:05:34.930> we

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:35.930 
frankly if you're an older person we

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:37.860 
frankly if you're an older person we

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:37.870 
recommend that you leave the date off

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:43.209 
recommend that you leave the date off
only<00:05:38.870> because<00:05:39.440> some<00:05:40.340> folks<00:05:40.639> do<00:05:40.940> have<00:05:40.969> a<00:05:42.219> desire

00:05:43.209 --> 00:05:43.219 
only because some folks do have a desire

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:45.909 
only because some folks do have a desire
if<00:05:43.550> you<00:05:43.729> will<00:05:43.940> to<00:05:44.389> bring<00:05:45.169> in<00:05:45.349> younger<00:05:45.740> people

00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:45.919 
if you will to bring in younger people

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:47.560 
if you will to bring in younger people
frankly<00:05:46.460> because<00:05:46.729> if<00:05:47.000> you've<00:05:47.150> worked<00:05:47.419> your

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:47.570 
frankly because if you've worked your

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:49.120 
frankly because if you've worked your
way<00:05:47.630> up<00:05:47.719> the<00:05:47.990> ladder<00:05:48.139> you're<00:05:48.440> more<00:05:48.650> expensive

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:49.130 
way up the ladder you're more expensive

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:50.649 
way up the ladder you're more expensive
so<00:05:49.310> they<00:05:49.430> are<00:05:49.580> sometimes<00:05:49.849> looking<00:05:50.419> for

00:05:50.649 --> 00:05:50.659 
so they are sometimes looking for

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:52.390 
so they are sometimes looking for
somebody<00:05:50.960> who<00:05:51.229> can<00:05:51.530> come<00:05:51.740> in<00:05:51.889> and<00:05:52.039> do<00:05:52.099> the<00:05:52.219> job

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:52.400 
somebody who can come in and do the job

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:54.430 
somebody who can come in and do the job
a<00:05:52.430> little<00:05:52.610> bit<00:05:52.820> cheaper<00:05:53.240> so<00:05:53.810> that's<00:05:54.050> just<00:05:54.199> one

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:54.440 
a little bit cheaper so that's just one

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:56.920 
a little bit cheaper so that's just one
reason<00:05:54.830> we<00:05:54.979> recommend<00:05:55.909> that<00:05:56.180> if<00:05:56.509> your<00:05:56.690> degree

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:56.930 
reason we recommend that if your degree

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:59.260 
reason we recommend that if your degree
is<00:05:57.349> more<00:05:57.620> than<00:05:57.770> 20<00:05:58.159> years<00:05:58.310> old<00:05:58.580> that<00:05:58.969> you<00:05:59.120> may

is more than 20 years old that you may

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:05.170 
is more than 20 years old that you may
want<00:05:59.479> to<00:05:59.570> just<00:05:59.750> leave<00:05:59.930> the<00:06:00.259> date<00:06:01.159> off<00:06:03.940> that<00:06:04.940> is

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:05.180 
want to just leave the date off that is

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:07.740 
want to just leave the date off that is
pretty<00:06:05.449> much<00:06:05.630> it<00:06:05.690> in<00:06:06.080> this<00:06:06.560> particular

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:07.750 
pretty much it in this particular

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:29.120 
background to your job for example if

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:30.879 
background to your job for example if
you<00:06:29.300> were<00:06:29.449> a<00:06:29.479> baseball<00:06:29.900> team<00:06:30.440> and<00:06:30.740> you<00:06:30.800> were

00:06:30.879 --> 00:06:30.889 
you were a baseball team and you were

00:06:30.889 --> 00:06:32.350 
you were a baseball team and you were
looking<00:06:31.190> for<00:06:31.370> a<00:06:31.400> second<00:06:31.849> baseman

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:32.360 
looking for a second baseman

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:33.429 
looking for a second baseman
you<00:06:32.419> would<00:06:32.539> be<00:06:32.689> concerned<00:06:33.080> with<00:06:33.259> their

00:06:33.429 --> 00:06:33.439 
you would be concerned with their

00:06:33.439 --> 00:06:35.379 
you would be concerned with their
fielding<00:06:33.949> percentage<00:06:34.520> not<00:06:34.729> their<00:06:35.000> batting

00:06:35.379 --> 00:06:35.389 
fielding percentage not their batting

00:06:35.389 --> 00:06:38.050 
fielding percentage not their batting
percentage<00:06:36.020> so<00:06:36.710> in<00:06:36.830> a<00:06:36.889> way<00:06:37.009> the<00:06:37.219> philosophy<00:06:38.030> of

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:38.060 
percentage so in a way the philosophy of

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:40.600 
percentage so in a way the philosophy of
resume<00:06:38.719> writing<00:06:39.020> is<00:06:39.439> to<00:06:39.740> say<00:06:39.979> this<00:06:40.219> is<00:06:40.400> what<00:06:40.580> I

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:40.610 
resume writing is to say this is what I

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:42.969 
resume writing is to say this is what I
was<00:06:40.909> charged<00:06:41.449> with<00:06:41.689> doing<00:06:42.259> and<00:06:42.469> this<00:06:42.590> is<00:06:42.770> how<00:06:42.949> I

00:06:42.969 --> 00:06:42.979 
was charged with doing and this is how I

00:06:42.979 --> 00:06:45.850 
was charged with doing and this is how I
did<00:06:43.400> against<00:06:44.030> that<00:06:44.360> charge<00:06:44.750> and<00:06:45.500> that's<00:06:45.590> what

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:45.860 
did against that charge and that's what

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:48.040 
did against that charge and that's what
we<00:06:45.979> mean<00:06:46.189> by<00:06:46.400> a<00:06:46.430> responsibility<00:06:47.419> statement<00:06:47.659> to

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:48.050 
we mean by a responsibility statement to

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:50.140 
we mean by a responsibility statement to
those<00:06:48.229> lines<00:06:49.009> are<00:06:49.280> two<00:06:49.490> that<00:06:49.729> would<00:06:49.819> occur

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:50.150 
those lines are two that would occur

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:52.540 
those lines are two that would occur
underneath<00:06:50.780> the<00:06:51.050> job<00:06:51.289> description<00:06:51.979> and<00:06:52.430> then

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:52.550 
underneath the job description and then

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:54.249 
underneath the job description and then
underneath<00:06:52.879> that<00:06:53.300> would<00:06:53.509> be<00:06:53.659> specific

00:06:54.249 --> 00:06:54.259 
underneath that would be specific

00:06:54.259 --> 00:06:56.740 
underneath that would be specific
bullets<00:06:54.710> that<00:06:55.639> would<00:06:55.879> talk<00:06:56.150> about<00:06:56.180> how<00:06:56.689> you

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:56.750 
bullets that would talk about how you

00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:59.200 
bullets that would talk about how you
did<00:06:57.139> again<00:06:57.439> against<00:06:57.979> those<00:06:58.210> responsibilities

00:06:59.200 --> 00:06:59.210 
did again against those responsibilities

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:01.170 
did again against those responsibilities
and<00:06:59.629> actually<00:07:00.050> in<00:07:00.139> this<00:07:00.259> particular<00:07:00.439> example

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:01.180 
and actually in this particular example

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:04.540 
and actually in this particular example
we<00:07:02.180> don't<00:07:02.360> have<00:07:02.750> those<00:07:03.550> responsibility

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:04.550 
we don't have those responsibility

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:06.129 
we don't have those responsibility
statements<00:07:05.090> in<00:07:05.240> here<00:07:05.479> but<00:07:05.599> I<00:07:05.689> didn't<00:07:05.900> want<00:07:06.050> to

00:07:06.129 --> 00:07:06.139 
statements in here but I didn't want to

00:07:06.139 --> 00:07:08.019 
statements in here but I didn't want to
