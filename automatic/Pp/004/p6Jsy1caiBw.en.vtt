00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:08.709
 I think that this time for the drawing of a perpendicular line I want to do the Tteyuu construction of vertical bisector 

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:12.179
 I will 

00:00:08.709 --> 00:00:12.179
 Vertical bisector 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:18.830
 You are cool 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:24.650
 It is as its name is not even so because the perpendicular bisector is 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:30.560
 What is connected by what kind of attached store without'm straight line Fu say this is 1000 roof 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:34.140
 By dividing it by the vertical i.e. 90 degrees when there is a line segment say 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:40.320
 Switch that line so as to integrate 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:45.300
 It's called the Obi bisect line. How can I do it for you ? 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:46.199
 What is the right way to write a straight line that divides into 90 degrees 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.160
 is 

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:54.130
 Earlier this This is not so difficult in 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:58.960
 Just as I said at the recommendation time, this is off 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:01:00.690
 I want to divide it into 90 degrees in summer so that it has the same length 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:04.010
 First of all 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.159
 It is called compass length and 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:09.490
 It is the patient today 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:17.310
 It is ok like this high and low nea her a 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:17.310
 And I will always pull on here without changing this length 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:23.500
 Then 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.740
 I can improve two things 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:32.850
 Then I can do it. 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:39.780
 If this is connected, it will be connected to the vertical bisector 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:45.760
 In other words here is the length of here have reached 90 degrees to the game if here a Well door'm together 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:51.940
 If a m and b m will be together, such a straight line 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:56.890
 But at what you can draw to this is not talk about Tsu Become fled in addition a vertical 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:02:00.620
 After all , it is 180 degrees here first with the recommendation of work 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:04.330
 It 's a fool here 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:04.330
 Hydrofluoric's wrong to say that line faction 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:09.580
 I think that I understand if you think like a triangle like this 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:16.069
 Did not change the compass and the length, such as was with swept me here, but Te Akandei had high 

00:02:15.409 --> 00:02:19.310
 It was 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:21.600
 So the length here is together 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:27.210
 Dekoko is the same 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:34.530
 It says that war this triangle this triangle has become a war that has two 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:40.950
 So if this triangle and this triangle have the same shape and shape for life , the angle here is 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:41.590
 Divide into 180 degrees and 90 degrees because it becomes equal, and the length here is equal 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.730
 In other words 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:49.569
 2 is equally divided vertically anyway of the drawing that Rutte 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:54.970
 In this vertically integrated fence tax, but in the year 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:57.110
 As the problem described how to be in and out in Fu called Take the midpoint 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:01.700
 I will remember it as the end point 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:07.490
 The end point is to the middle point when there is a line segment like this 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:10.490
 So this vertical bisector is of course removed vertically if it is transparent but there 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:14.660
 Since the mid-specific improvement of this ab is the 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:17.130
 It is possible to draw in the middle store at the same time, so it passes through the middle point 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:21.650
 A suite that is said to take a midpoint 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:21.650
 Especially how to draw a dividing line
