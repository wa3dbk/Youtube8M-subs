stats<00:00:17.310> here<00:00:17.550> I<00:00:17.609> did<00:00:17.940> get<00:00:18.210> lowered<00:00:19.020> content<00:00:19.470> a

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
stats here I did get lowered content a

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.240 
stats here I did get lowered content a
low<00:00:19.619> 50<00:00:20.100> and<00:00:21.230> the<00:00:22.230> speed<00:00:22.500> is<00:00:22.680> 10<00:00:22.890> meters<00:00:23.130> per

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
low 50 and the speed is 10 meters per

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.160 
low 50 and the speed is 10 meters per
second<00:00:23.609> which<00:00:23.699> is<00:00:23.760> the<00:00:24.119> speed<00:00:24.300> of<00:00:24.630> a<00:00:24.689> top<00:00:24.960> tier

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
second which is the speed of a top tier

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.950 
second which is the speed of a top tier
mount<00:00:25.439> like<00:00:25.939> thunder<00:00:26.939> -<00:00:27.150> or<00:00:27.710> the<00:00:28.710> pegasus<00:00:29.960> so

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
mount like thunder - or the pegasus so

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.030 
mount like thunder - or the pegasus so
this<00:00:31.109> is<00:00:31.170> what<00:00:31.260> it<00:00:31.349> does<00:00:31.500> when<00:00:31.769> you<00:00:31.859> press

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
this is what it does when you press

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.420 
this is what it does when you press
spacebar<00:00:32.309> while<00:00:33.350> standing<00:00:34.350> still<00:00:34.410> I<00:00:34.950> don't

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
spacebar while standing still I don't

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.850 
spacebar while standing still I don't
think<00:00:35.640> that<00:00:35.790> does<00:00:35.969> any<00:00:36.149> damage<00:00:36.440> anyways<00:00:37.440> going

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
think that does any damage anyways going

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.280 
think that does any damage anyways going
over<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.190> abilities<00:00:38.550> here<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:39.030> -<00:00:39.540> and<00:00:40.170> this

is a little hop that brings you forward
a<00:00:43.620> little<00:00:43.800> bit<00:00:43.920> you<00:00:44.309> can't<00:00:44.550> also<00:00:44.700> use<00:00:44.940> it<00:00:45.090> in

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
a little bit you can't also use it in

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.540 
a little bit you can't also use it in
the<00:00:45.329> air<00:00:46.160> midair<00:00:47.160> if<00:00:47.250> you<00:00:47.370> want<00:00:49.340> and<00:00:50.340> then

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
the air midair if you want and then

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.040 
the air midair if you want and then
you've<00:00:50.670> got<00:00:50.789> an<00:00:50.879> ability<00:00:51.149> very<00:00:51.600> similar<00:00:51.930> to

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
you've got an ability very similar to

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.389 
you've got an ability very similar to
drop<00:00:52.289> back<00:00:52.550> and<00:00:54.620> ability<00:00:55.620> very<00:00:55.860> similar<00:00:56.219> to

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
drop back and ability very similar to

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.400 
drop back and ability very similar to
teleportation<00:00:57.210> although<00:00:58.199> this

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
teleportation although this

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.250 
teleportation although this
teleportation<00:00:58.890> is<00:00:59.250> 18<00:01:00.149> meters<00:01:00.480> forward<00:01:00.750> while

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
teleportation is 18 meters forward while

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:07.240 
teleportation is 18 meters forward while
the<00:01:01.800> normal<00:01:02.399> ability<00:01:02.850> teleportation<00:01:03.539> is<00:01:03.949> 15

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.270 

and<00:01:08.780> then<00:01:09.780> you've<00:01:09.930> got<00:01:10.170> one<00:01:10.500> last<00:01:10.740> ability

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
and then you've got one last ability

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.210 
and then you've got one last ability
here<00:01:11.520> on<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.820> rabbit<00:01:12.390> which<00:01:12.720> is<00:01:12.960> a<00:01:13.409> self

any of these other gears onto your
rabbit<00:01:47.820> I<00:01:48.390> believe<00:01:49.380> that<00:01:49.530> it<00:01:49.619> was<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:49.829> same

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
rabbit I believe that it was the same

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.179 
rabbit I believe that it was the same
for<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.430> reindeer<00:01:51.119> mount<00:01:51.750> as<00:01:51.930> well<00:01:52.140> it<00:01:52.979> was<00:01:53.130> a

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
for the reindeer mount as well it was a

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:58.520 
for the reindeer mount as well it was a
gear<00:01:53.759> specific<00:01:56.750> so<00:01:57.750> this<00:01:57.930> is<00:01:58.049> how<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.229> three

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
gear specific so this is how the three

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:07.010 
gear specific so this is how the three
pieces<00:01:58.740> look<00:01:59.070> like<00:01:59.250> on<00:01:59.460> the<00:01:59.670> rabbit<00:02:05.960> kind<00:02:06.960> of

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
pieces look like on the rabbit kind of

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:14.940 
pieces look like on the rabbit kind of
carries<00:02:07.290> a<00:02:07.320> bag<00:02:07.590> like<00:02:07.770> a<00:02:07.829> messenger

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.410 

just<00:02:15.950> looking<00:02:16.310> at<00:02:16.370> the<00:02:16.460> stats<00:02:16.700> here<00:02:16.820> the<00:02:17.150> speed

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
just looking at the stats here the speed

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.890 
just looking at the stats here the speed
is<00:02:17.570> basically<00:02:18.020> the<00:02:18.170> same<00:02:18.380> as<00:02:18.740> as<00:02:19.400> a<00:02:20.330> another

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
is basically the same as as a another

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.270 
is basically the same as as a another
pet<00:02:21.290> another<00:02:21.890> top<00:02:22.040> tier<00:02:22.510> mount<00:02:23.860> wearing<00:02:24.860> Brees
