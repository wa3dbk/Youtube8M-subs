 in some cars that is where 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.280

 Good now, let's feel a little bit more 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:38.700
 about this new range rover sport 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:42.410
 we are in the hsc version the engine to 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:45.180
 292 horsepower 3-liter v6 diesel 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:47.489
 You looking at the car that size 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.500
 you will talk hey drive a slow car 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:51.720
 in a car that does not stop a car 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.090
 do not bend your mistake 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:57.420
 this car goes from zero so below the 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:59.640
 9 seconds it makes 7.2 seconds is a 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.770
 great curve car in a car that 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.350
 brakes excellent 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:09.270
 besides consuming 15% less 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:10.920
 fuel emitting 13% less co2 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:12.960
 this performance improvement of the new 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.690
 range rover sport is due to its low 

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:18.780
 weight coming through your pants would be 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:20.910
 totally made of aluminum and this 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.690
 makes the car look - both in 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:26.550
 braking around the curves 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:29.730
 making the car much easier to 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:30.780
 guiding more pleasurable and much more 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.210

 sportsmanship is not just in the name 

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:38.100
 from the car we have the exchange as old 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:40.230
 eight-speed 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:42.630
 in drive mode the gear shifts 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:44.760
 automatic and in sport mode is indicated 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:47.190
 for those looking for high performance 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:49.680
 are perfect resources to achieve the 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:52.230
 better torque of the vehicle and a 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:55.050
 fuel efficiency and we have 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:57.450

 for use of the engine without 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:06.150
 steering wheel hands 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:08.490
 and another thing we can use without 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:11.100
 take your hands off the wheel are the commands 

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:14.700
 radio and multimedia that we have the 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:16.590
 the new range rover sport has 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:18.150
 an intelligent traction system in the 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:22.410
 four-wheel drive that optimizes performance 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:23.820
 on off road modes 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.460
 a land rover to develop a system 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:29.220
 chance to revive good ones in 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.810
 you can select the ideal 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.950
 type of terrain you are using 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:34.710
 your vehicle 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:36.660
 the novelty is that this respons ground 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:37.980
 second generation in addition to having the 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:40.830
 manual selection 

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:43.500
 you can leave it the automatic mode and 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:45.960
 he alone he will adapt to the type 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:48.950
 the land on which you are with your 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:51.450
 range rover sport

 parking the new range rover sport is 

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:55.380
 an easy task 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:56.780
 mark s is a system that identifies vacancies 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:05:00.360
 and helps the driver when parking 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:03.060
 maneuvering the vehicle automatically 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:05.430
 range rover sport hc uses a system 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:07.290
 smart start stop it turns off 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:09.510
 car when stopped and turned back on

 automatically when the driver is 

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:14.430
 ready to start 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:16.020
 adaptive cruise control helps 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:17.790
 maintain a safe distance in 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:20.640
 relation to the front 

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:22.380
 even with the speed changes 

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:24.900
 blind spot monitor and 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:27.120
 proximity help the driver to look 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:29.310
 which may go unnoticed and 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:31.770
 detect the approach of vehicles 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:34.380
 the air suspension system 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:35.880
 four-wheeled electronic 

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:39.920
 crossing the grounds 

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:39.920
 good off road with comfort and security 

00:05:42.599 --> 00:05:49.330
 Another technology linked to suspension is the 

00:05:46.449 --> 00:05:52.569
 adaptive dynamics that are several 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:55.029
 sensors in the suspension and in the car that 

00:05:52.569 --> 00:05:57.639
 monitor it during control in the 

00:05:55.029 --> 00:06:01.169
 curve by preventing the car from skidding 

00:05:57.639 --> 00:06:03.759
 sudden movements another system 

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:05.319
 added to technology and security 

00:06:03.759 --> 00:06:08.710
 in this car 

00:06:05.319 --> 00:06:11.020
 daniel is that it monitors the respons 

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:14.289
 How much does this car roll in control? 

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:16.089
 curve and preventing it from looking the 

00:06:14.289 --> 00:06:18.249
 than necessary leaving the car very 

00:06:16.089 --> 00:06:20.339
 more stable and secure around the 

00:06:18.249 --> 00:06:20.339
 curves 

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:25.599
 this is the new range rover sport the 

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:28.629
 supreme vehicle in controls and comfort 

00:06:25.599 --> 00:06:30.729
 with exceptional performance come 

00:06:28.629 --> 00:06:33.629
 know it on eurobike land rover more
