 Completely free of that is the 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.130
 agreements that we have reached with the center 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.440

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:13.269
 2002 February 23 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.629
 comes for the reason that my parents 

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:18.099
 they sent looking for new opportunities 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:21.099
 in which after 12 years 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:24.370
 I found in this university thanks to 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:26.549
 the doctor camacho that is what we 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:29.069
 help in this university to all 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:32.379
 immigrants like me who have come to 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:35.349
 get ahead in this country that gives us 

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:37.900
 good opportunities and a year ago 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:39.760
 I'm studying at this university 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.010
 help my son also because I to the 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.870
 school and you need to learn and I 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.540
 I need to be with him to get him out 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:48.730
 go ahead because I want to understand my 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.920
 son when he talks to me or has his 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.110
 problems or I need to help him for 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.260
 listen and talk to the teachers of 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.260
 the 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:06.920
 it was a coincidence we attended 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:08.959
 a church here in wings flushing and in 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.900
 the church gave us a paper and so not 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:16.370
 I read it and I read it the next day and I 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:20.209
 I was interested in the program and I came and I 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:22.040
 I signed up but beyond coming alone 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:25.610
 school they gave me a chance to 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:27.650
 write me for the dakar program in which 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:30.110
 I qualified because I came at age 14 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:32.569
 and it's a very big sport that I 'm 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:35.180
 taking advantage and I hope it is done 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:38.359
 reality to get a permit from 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:41.870
 work, my name is calixto presenting 

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:44.989
 I come from Guatemala and I study in 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:49.480
 this program and this program has been 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:52.060
 a blessing for me and I dedicate myself to 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:54.860
 to work I work I dedicate myself 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:57.110
 working in construction 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:04:00.440
 and English is very important to 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:03.290
 communicate with people 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:07.870
 that's why it serves me so much English 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:07.870
 I had never studied at a university 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:16.340
 the experience is very very nice and better 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:18.440
 I try to make the most of it 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:20.690
 can English is basically very 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.730
 important that we must learn all 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:25.010
 because through English 

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:28.100
 I had a lot of difficulty because I did not 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:30.889
 he knew no English then in the 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:32.860
 Basic English I learned a lot about how little 

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:36.030
 that I understood enough for my work 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:38.070
 because one can not 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:40.890
 unwrap at work here without the 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:43.710
 English and with English one aspires to 

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:45.960
 win better to better positions maybe very 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:48.060
 beautiful that I have learned here I am 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.980
 Learning little by little unfortunately 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:52.500
 I work for Hispanic so I do not practice 

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:54.200
 a lot then I'm trying to 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:56.690
 to learn 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:58.460
 day to day word to word and here in the 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:00.620
 university I feel happier because 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:02.240
 I see that teaching is much better me 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:05.030
 I feel very well here at school 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:08.960
 because it's the university because I see that 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:11.270
 there are better teachers teaching is 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:13.220
 much better I'm already enrolled 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:15.680
 at school but I'm going to come here to 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:19.700
 this school to college with 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:22.130
 preference because it 's better for more 

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:24.080
 information can be communicated with the 

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:26.570

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:36.350
