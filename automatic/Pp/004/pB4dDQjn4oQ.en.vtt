hey everybody it's this here and I have

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:10.040 
hey everybody it's this here and I have
another<00:00:08.099> add-on<00:00:08.610> that<00:00:09.420> I've<00:00:09.570> been<00:00:09.690> using<00:00:09.870> that

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
another add-on that I've been using that

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:11.540 
another add-on that I've been using that
I<00:00:10.139> think<00:00:10.380> is<00:00:10.530> really<00:00:10.830> really<00:00:11.160> really<00:00:11.400> awesome

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
I think is really really really awesome

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.550 
I think is really really really awesome
and<00:00:12.559> what<00:00:13.559> it<00:00:13.679> does<00:00:14.059> it's<00:00:15.059> called<00:00:15.269> sky<00:00:16.080> shards

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
and what it does it's called sky shards

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.480 
and what it does it's called sky shards

this<00:00:20.580> awesome<00:00:20.850> add-on<00:00:21.539> the<00:00:22.020> reason<00:00:22.289> I<00:00:22.350> like<00:00:22.529> it

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
this awesome add-on the reason I like it

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.950 
this awesome add-on the reason I like it
is<00:00:22.920> it's<00:00:23.670> super<00:00:23.880> simple<00:00:24.330> and<00:00:24.660> lightweight

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
is it's super simple and lightweight

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.720 
is it's super simple and lightweight
there's<00:00:25.380> other<00:00:25.590> add-ons<00:00:25.830> that<00:00:26.220> you<00:00:26.310> can<00:00:26.460> use

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
there's other add-ons that you can use

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.609 
there's other add-ons that you can use
and<00:00:27.029> book<00:00:27.180> this<00:00:27.570> one<00:00:27.779> just<00:00:28.140> works<00:00:28.349> really

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
and book this one just works really

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.140 
and book this one just works really
really<00:00:28.740> well<00:00:28.920> it's<00:00:29.279> really<00:00:29.519> simple<00:00:29.849> and<00:00:30.029> all

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
really well it's really simple and all

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.720 
really well it's really simple and all
it<00:00:30.269> does<00:00:30.449> is<00:00:30.720> it<00:00:31.289> shows<00:00:31.529> the<00:00:31.740> sky<00:00:31.980> shards<00:00:32.460> on

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
it does is it shows the sky shards on

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.000 
it does is it shows the sky shards on
your<00:00:33.090> map<00:00:33.239> so<00:00:33.480> if<00:00:33.570> you<00:00:33.660> press<00:00:33.840> M<00:00:34.140> it'll<00:00:34.860> show

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
your map so if you press M it'll show

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.250 
your map so if you press M it'll show
the<00:00:35.040> sky<00:00:35.399> shards<00:00:35.820> for<00:00:36.120> you<00:00:36.360> and<00:00:36.570> you<00:00:37.110> can

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
the sky shards for you and you can

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.410 
the sky shards for you and you can
actually<00:00:37.469> filter<00:00:38.090> there's<00:00:39.090> different

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
actually filter there's different

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.209 
actually filter there's different
options<00:00:39.540> here<00:00:40.110> where<00:00:40.290> you<00:00:40.410> can<00:00:40.590> pick<00:00:40.890> which

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
options here where you can pick which

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.880 
options here where you can pick which
ones<00:00:41.489> if<00:00:41.670> you<00:00:41.760> want<00:00:41.940> to<00:00:42.059> show<00:00:42.440> only<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.710> sky

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
ones if you want to show only the sky

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.010 
ones if you want to show only the sky
shards<00:00:44.219> you<00:00:44.370> don't<00:00:44.579> know<00:00:44.789> about<00:00:45.090> if<00:00:45.690> you<00:00:45.840> want

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
shards you don't know about if you want

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.900 
shards you don't know about if you want
to<00:00:46.079> show<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.500> sky<00:00:46.680> shards<00:00:46.980> you<00:00:47.070> found<00:00:47.399> as<00:00:47.730> well

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
to show the sky shards you found as well

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.549 
to show the sky shards you found as well
so<00:00:48.180> it<00:00:48.239> shows<00:00:48.450> all<00:00:48.600> of<00:00:48.690> them<00:00:48.809> and<00:00:48.989> they<00:00:49.379> even

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
so it shows all of them and they even

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.380 
so it shows all of them and they even
tracks<00:00:50.100> it<00:00:50.340> on<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.640> compass<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:51.210> there's<00:00:51.329> a

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
tracks it on the compass and there's a

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.869 
tracks it on the compass and there's a
couple<00:00:51.539> of<00:00:51.690> different<00:00:51.989> options<00:00:52.160> for<00:00:53.160> what<00:00:53.219> you

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
couple of different options for what you

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.029 
couple of different options for what you
want<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.149> sky<00:00:54.329> shards<00:00:54.629> to<00:00:54.809> look<00:00:55.020> like<00:00:55.230> so<00:00:55.949> it

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
want the sky shards to look like so it

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.500 
want the sky shards to look like so it
just<00:00:56.219> makes<00:00:56.370> it<00:00:56.489> really<00:00:56.699> easy<00:00:56.789> really

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
just makes it really easy really

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.090 
just makes it really easy really
lightweight<00:00:57.690> you<00:00:58.140> can<00:00:58.320> see<00:00:58.559> where<00:00:58.739> they're<00:00:58.920> at

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
lightweight you can see where they're at

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.549 
lightweight you can see where they're at
it's<00:00:59.699> pretty<00:01:00.000> accurate<00:01:00.480> so<00:01:00.510> far<00:01:00.660> as<00:01:01.260> far<00:01:01.469> as

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
it's pretty accurate so far as far as

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.549 
it's pretty accurate so far as far as
where<00:01:01.829> it's<00:01:02.039> at<00:01:02.219> because<00:01:03.140> sometimes<00:01:04.140> some

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
where it's at because sometimes some

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.109 
where it's at because sometimes some
maps<00:01:04.860> some<00:01:05.100> different<00:01:05.339> things<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.640> sky<00:01:05.880> chart

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
maps some different things the sky chart

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.780 
maps some different things the sky chart
icon<00:01:06.420> is<00:01:06.630> so<00:01:06.840> huge<00:01:07.200> takes<00:01:07.799> up<00:01:07.979> such<00:01:08.159> a<00:01:08.189> big<00:01:08.340> area

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
icon is so huge takes up such a big area

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.550 
icon is so huge takes up such a big area
on<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:08.939> map<00:01:09.060> you<00:01:09.210> don't<00:01:09.390> know<00:01:09.479> where<00:01:09.659> it's<00:01:09.810> at

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
on the map you don't know where it's at

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.050 
on the map you don't know where it's at
this<00:01:10.920> one's<00:01:11.130> really<00:01:11.310> accurate<00:01:11.729> it's<00:01:11.850> really

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
this one's really accurate it's really

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.390 
this one's really accurate it's really
nice<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:12.570> again<00:01:13.229> you<00:01:13.409> can<00:01:13.590> filter<00:01:13.890> it<00:01:14.130> so<00:01:14.310> it

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
nice and again you can filter it so it

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.770 
nice and again you can filter it so it
only<00:01:14.520> shows<00:01:14.670> the<00:01:15.030> ones<00:01:15.180> you<00:01:15.299> don't<00:01:15.450> know<00:01:15.570> if

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
only shows the ones you don't know if

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.510 
only shows the ones you don't know if
you<00:01:15.840> look<00:01:15.960> at<00:01:16.049> my<00:01:16.140> compass<00:01:16.530> there<00:01:16.740> you<00:01:17.310> see

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
you look at my compass there you see

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.789 
you look at my compass there you see
that<00:01:17.670> icon<00:01:18.119> right<00:01:18.570> in<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:18.810> middle<00:01:19.020> how<00:01:19.650> it

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
that icon right in the middle how it

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.230 
that icon right in the middle how it
fades<00:01:20.100> in<00:01:20.369> and<00:01:20.400> fades<00:01:20.580> out

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
fades in and fades out

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.240 
fades in and fades out
that's<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.869> sky<00:01:22.080> shard<00:01:22.560> and<00:01:22.680> so<00:01:22.860> we<00:01:22.920> can<00:01:23.100> even

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
that's the sky shard and so we can even

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.980 
that's the sky shard and so we can even
show<00:01:23.369> you<00:01:23.640> on<00:01:23.970> your<00:01:24.180> compass<00:01:24.509> where<00:01:24.720> it's<00:01:24.840> at

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
show you on your compass where it's at

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.660 
show you on your compass where it's at
now<00:01:25.200> I<00:01:25.439> know<00:01:25.710> a<00:01:25.799> lot<00:01:25.979> of<00:01:26.130> people<00:01:26.340> like<00:01:26.520> the

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
now I know a lot of people like the

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.520 
now I know a lot of people like the
exploration<00:01:27.390> and<00:01:27.509> they<00:01:27.630> like<00:01:27.780> to<00:01:27.960> hunt<00:01:28.110> for<00:01:28.409> it

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
exploration and they like to hunt for it

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.170 
exploration and they like to hunt for it
and<00:01:28.770> maybe<00:01:29.070> you<00:01:29.280> wouldn't<00:01:29.520> want<00:01:29.729> this<00:01:29.850> saddle

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
and maybe you wouldn't want this saddle

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.399 
and maybe you wouldn't want this saddle
and<00:01:30.329> that's<00:01:30.450> perfectly<00:01:30.900> fine<00:01:30.990> if<00:01:31.320> you<00:01:31.380> like

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
and that's perfectly fine if you like

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.219 
and that's perfectly fine if you like
that<00:01:31.710> for<00:01:32.490> me<00:01:32.640> I<00:01:32.880> get<00:01:33.210> really<00:01:33.420> frustrated<00:01:33.509> when

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
that for me I get really frustrated when

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.319 
that for me I get really frustrated when
I'm<00:01:34.350> running<00:01:34.710> around<00:01:34.829> and<00:01:35.430> I<00:01:35.790> can't<00:01:36.060> find

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
I'm running around and I can't find

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.030 
I'm running around and I can't find
something<00:01:36.659> and<00:01:37.049> I<00:01:37.110> know<00:01:37.170> it's<00:01:37.439> here<00:01:37.710> and<00:01:37.829> I<00:01:37.890> got
