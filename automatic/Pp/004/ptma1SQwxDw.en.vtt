00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
just going to turn the whole bond you've

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.490

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
got to be quite careful with heat

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.730 
got to be quite careful with heat
because<00:01:04.860> you<00:01:04.890> don't<00:01:05.159> want<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.430> pan<00:01:05.640> to

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 
because you don't want the pan to

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.750 
because you don't want the pan to
overcook<00:01:07.740> so<00:01:07.950> i'm<00:01:08.010> just<00:01:08.070> gonna<00:01:08.280> put<00:01:08.400> that<00:01:08.580> on<00:01:08.729> a

overcook so i'm just gonna put that on a

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:09.469 
overcook so i'm just gonna put that on a
low<00:01:08.970> heat

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
low heat

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.020 
low heat

gonna not to put too much in because

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.840 
gonna not to put too much in because
it's<00:01:18.240> only<00:01:18.390> a<00:01:18.479> small<00:01:18.720> gravy<00:01:19.549> just<00:01:20.549> to<00:01:20.610> give<00:01:20.729> you

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
it's only a small gravy just to give you

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.280 
it's only a small gravy just to give you
an<00:01:20.970> example<00:01:21.390> of<00:01:21.600> how<00:01:21.630> to<00:01:21.780> do<00:01:22.080> it

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
an example of how to do it

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.109 
an example of how to do it
but<00:01:22.710> obviously<00:01:23.130> if<00:01:23.580> you<00:01:23.700> want<00:01:23.850> to<00:01:23.939> make<00:01:24.090> a

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
but obviously if you want to make a

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.969 
but obviously if you want to make a
larger<00:01:24.570> one<00:01:24.720> then<00:01:24.900> increase<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:25.290> quantities

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
larger one then increase the quantities

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.070 
larger one then increase the quantities
so<00:01:26.759> what<00:01:27.000> I'm<00:01:27.090> going<00:01:27.210> to<00:01:27.270> do<00:01:27.390> now<00:01:27.570> is<00:01:27.720> make<00:01:27.900> the

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
so what I'm going to do now is make the

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.499 
so what I'm going to do now is make the
roux<00:01:28.290> which<00:01:28.950> is<00:01:29.159> going<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:29.729> thicken<00:01:30.090> out<00:01:30.360> the

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
roux which is going to thicken out the

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.840 
roux which is going to thicken out the
gravy<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:33.470> see<00:01:34.470> most<00:01:34.920> of<00:01:35.100> it<00:01:35.220> ends<00:01:35.460> up<00:01:35.549> on<00:01:35.729> the

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
gravy and see most of it ends up on the

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.830 
gravy and see most of it ends up on the
work<00:01:36.030> surface<00:01:37.850> I'm<00:01:38.850> gonna<00:01:39.119> scrape<00:01:39.570> all<00:01:39.810> the

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
work surface I'm gonna scrape all the

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.830 
work surface I'm gonna scrape all the
flavor<00:01:40.259> from<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.799> giblets<00:01:41.750> into<00:01:42.750> the

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
flavor from the giblets into the

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.000 
flavor from the giblets into the
residual<00:01:43.740> fat<00:01:43.979> and<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:44.700> flour

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:47.010 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:49.550

you could use stock Hugh so you would

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.540 
you could use stock Hugh so you would
put<00:02:02.640> a<00:02:02.700> stock<00:02:03.000> Hugh<00:02:03.330> in<00:02:03.900> a<00:02:04.140> jug<00:02:04.440> add<00:02:05.160> some

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:05.550 
put a stock Hugh in a jug add some

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:07.460 
put a stock Hugh in a jug add some
boiling<00:02:05.880> hot<00:02:06.060> water<00:02:06.120> leave<00:02:06.810> it<00:02:06.990> for<00:02:07.200> a<00:02:07.230> few

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
boiling hot water leave it for a few

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.250 
boiling hot water leave it for a few
minutes<00:02:07.830> and<00:02:08.070> that<00:02:08.580> would<00:02:08.790> suffice<00:02:09.260> what's

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:10.260 
minutes and that would suffice what's

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:11.630 
minutes and that would suffice what's
going<00:02:10.470> to<00:02:10.500> happen<00:02:10.770> now<00:02:10.950> is<00:02:11.130> I'm<00:02:11.250> going<00:02:11.340> to<00:02:11.400> cook

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
going to happen now is I'm going to cook

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.150 
going to happen now is I'm going to cook
this<00:02:11.820> gravy<00:02:12.300> down<00:02:12.620> because<00:02:13.620> at<00:02:13.740> the<00:02:13.800> moment

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
this gravy down because at the moment

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.400 
this gravy down because at the moment
it's<00:02:14.280> very<00:02:14.310> watery<00:02:14.810> I'm<00:02:15.810> going<00:02:16.050> to<00:02:16.110> cook<00:02:16.260> this

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
it's very watery I'm going to cook this

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.400 
it's very watery I'm going to cook this
down<00:02:16.620> for<00:02:16.920> three<00:02:17.100> or<00:02:17.190> four<00:02:17.220> minutes<00:02:18.410> because

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
down for three or four minutes because

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.680 
down for three or four minutes because
we<00:02:19.680> did<00:02:20.010> the<00:02:20.160> roux<00:02:20.340> that's<00:02:20.760> the<00:02:20.940> flour<00:02:21.180> added

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
we did the roux that's the flour added

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.810 
we did the roux that's the flour added
to<00:02:21.990> the<00:02:22.080> residual<00:02:22.560> fat<00:02:22.920> it's<00:02:23.520> going<00:02:23.730> to

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
to the residual fat it's going to

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:30.760 
to the residual fat it's going to
thicken<00:02:24.000> out<00:02:24.710> and<00:02:25.710> make<00:02:25.890> a<00:02:25.920> really<00:02:26.310> nice<00:02:26.460> gravy

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:30.770 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:34.070 

right<00:02:31.770> now<00:02:31.950> that's<00:02:32.130> been<00:02:32.600> cooking<00:02:33.600> on<00:02:33.750> the<00:02:33.870> hob

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
right now that's been cooking on the hob

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.310 
right now that's been cooking on the hob
for<00:02:34.290> about<00:02:34.710> two<00:02:35.430> or<00:02:35.520> three<00:02:35.550> minutes<00:02:35.940> and<00:02:36.420> I'm

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
for about two or three minutes and I'm

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.970 
for about two or three minutes and I'm
satisfied<00:02:37.920> that<00:02:38.310> I've<00:02:38.580> got<00:02:38.730> a<00:02:38.760> really<00:02:38.970> nice

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
satisfied that I've got a really nice

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.620 
satisfied that I've got a really nice
texture<00:02:40.980> there<00:02:41.280> and<00:02:42.060> what<00:02:42.180> I'm<00:02:42.300> going<00:02:42.390> to<00:02:42.480> do

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
texture there and what I'm going to do

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.360 
texture there and what I'm going to do
is<00:02:42.780> I'm<00:02:42.900> actually<00:02:42.930> just<00:02:43.590> so<00:02:43.709> that<00:02:43.860> you<00:02:43.980> can<00:02:44.130> see

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
is I'm actually just so that you can see

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.750 
is I'm actually just so that you can see
the<00:02:44.550> texture<00:02:44.940> of<00:02:45.090> the<00:02:45.360> the<00:02:45.630> giblet<00:02:45.990> gravy<00:02:46.020> is

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
the texture of the the giblet gravy is

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.640 
the texture of the the giblet gravy is
I'm<00:02:47.760> gonna<00:02:47.940> pass<00:02:48.240> or<00:02:48.720> not<00:02:48.900> to<00:02:48.990> pass<00:02:49.140> all<00:02:49.380> of<00:02:49.530> it

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
I'm gonna pass or not to pass all of it

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:50.870 
I'm gonna pass or not to pass all of it
because<00:02:49.890> we<00:02:49.980> don't<00:02:50.100> need<00:02:50.310> all<00:02:50.490> of<00:02:50.520> it<00:02:50.700> and<00:02:50.790> I'm

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
because we don't need all of it and I'm

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.090 
because we don't need all of it and I'm
gonna<00:02:50.970> pass<00:02:51.150> some<00:02:51.420> of<00:02:51.450> it<00:02:51.720> through<00:02:52.620> just<00:02:52.980> so

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
gonna pass some of it through just so

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.040 
gonna pass some of it through just so
that<00:02:53.250> you<00:02:53.340> can<00:02:53.489> get<00:02:53.640> an<00:02:53.760> idea<00:02:54.180> of<00:02:54.420> its

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
that you can get an idea of its

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:58.130 
that you can get an idea of its
thickness<00:02:56.330> if<00:02:57.330> you<00:02:57.480> pass<00:02:57.660> it<00:02:57.690> through<00:02:57.900> the

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
thickness if you pass it through the

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.860 
thickness if you pass it through the
sieve<00:02:58.350> all<00:02:58.530> the<00:02:58.620> bits<00:02:58.830> obviously<00:02:59.430> end<00:03:00.239> up<00:03:00.720> in

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
sieve all the bits obviously end up in

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.100 
sieve all the bits obviously end up in
the<00:03:00.959> sieve<00:03:01.170> rather<00:03:01.440> than<00:03:01.709> in<00:03:01.830> the<00:03:02.010> gravy<00:03:03.110> taste

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
the sieve rather than in the gravy taste

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:06.620 
the sieve rather than in the gravy taste
delicious<00:03:04.380> and<00:03:04.800> just<00:03:05.430> to<00:03:05.519> overemphasize<00:03:05.940> the

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
delicious and just to overemphasize the

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.770 
delicious and just to overemphasize the
thickness<00:03:07.019> of<00:03:07.170> it<00:03:07.489> if<00:03:08.489> I<00:03:08.700> just<00:03:08.730> add<00:03:09.120> some<00:03:09.660> of

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
thickness of it if I just add some of

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.380 
thickness of it if I just add some of
the<00:03:09.900> chicken<00:03:10.380> stock<00:03:10.890> you<00:03:11.190> can<00:03:11.640> see<00:03:11.910> the

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
the chicken stock you can see the

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:18.620 
the chicken stock you can see the
difference<00:03:13.130> in<00:03:14.840> texture<00:03:15.840> and<00:03:16.459> that<00:03:17.459> is<00:03:18.420> how<00:03:18.570> to

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
difference in texture and that is how to

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.350 
difference in texture and that is how to
make<00:03:18.780> a<00:03:18.900> giblet<00:03:19.320> gravy
