00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:04.130 

this<00:00:02.550> is<00:00:02.730> just<00:00:02.909> response<00:00:03.330> video<00:00:03.720> to<00:00:03.840> a<00:00:03.870> bunch

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140 
this is just response video to a bunch

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:05.450 
this is just response video to a bunch
of<00:00:04.230> idiots<00:00:04.560> who<00:00:04.650> think<00:00:04.770> that<00:00:04.950> you<00:00:05.100> can<00:00:05.250> prove

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
of idiots who think that you can prove

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.960 
of idiots who think that you can prove
math<00:00:05.730> doesn't<00:00:06.180> exist<00:00:07.189> the<00:00:08.189> method<00:00:08.670> that<00:00:08.820> they

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
math doesn't exist the method that they

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.419 
math doesn't exist the method that they
use<00:00:09.210> is<00:00:09.540> that<00:00:09.570> equals<00:00:10.200> beam<00:00:10.469> and<00:00:10.740> that's<00:00:11.219> the

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
use is that equals beam and that's the

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.089 
use is that equals beam and that's the
initial<00:00:11.580> condition<00:00:12.120> multiply<00:00:12.870> both<00:00:13.650> sides<00:00:13.980> by

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
initial condition multiply both sides by

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.210 
initial condition multiply both sides by
B<00:00:14.219> so<00:00:14.429> you<00:00:14.639> get<00:00:14.759> a<00:00:14.940> B<00:00:15.120> equals<00:00:15.420> B<00:00:15.450> squared<00:00:16.220> the

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
B so you get a B equals B squared the

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.750 
B so you get a B equals B squared the
subtract<00:00:18.119> both<00:00:18.390> sides<00:00:19.550> subtract<00:00:20.550> and<00:00:20.699> a

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
subtract both sides subtract and a

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.759 
subtract both sides subtract and a
squared<00:00:21.060> from<00:00:21.210> both<00:00:21.300> sides<00:00:21.420> to<00:00:21.750> get<00:00:21.840> a<00:00:22.020> B<00:00:22.199> minus

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
squared from both sides to get a B minus

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.230 
squared from both sides to get a B minus
a<00:00:22.890> squared<00:00:23.130> equals<00:00:23.220> B<00:00:23.550> squared<00:00:23.609> minus<00:00:24.150> a

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
a squared equals B squared minus a

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.900 
a squared equals B squared minus a
squared<00:00:24.269> and<00:00:24.840> then<00:00:25.740> you<00:00:25.949> simplify<00:00:26.340> so<00:00:26.789> they

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
squared and then you simplify so they

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:33.650 
squared and then you simplify so they
get<00:00:27.680> a<00:00:29.599> times<00:00:30.619> B<00:00:31.619> minus<00:00:31.650> a<00:00:32.130> equals<00:00:32.669> B<00:00:32.910> minus<00:00:33.270> a<00:00:33.450> B

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
get a times B minus a equals B minus a B

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.180 
get a times B minus a equals B minus a B
plus<00:00:33.930> a<00:00:34.140> and<00:00:35.450> then<00:00:36.450> you<00:00:37.290> divide<00:00:37.559> both<00:00:37.800> sides<00:00:38.100> by

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
plus a and then you divide both sides by

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.729 
plus a and then you divide both sides by
the<00:00:38.340> B<00:00:38.489> minus<00:00:38.820> a<00:00:38.969> term<00:00:39.030> so<00:00:39.960> you<00:00:40.020> get<00:00:40.200> a<00:00:40.410> equals<00:00:40.620> B

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
the B minus a term so you get a equals B

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.459 
the B minus a term so you get a equals B
plus<00:00:40.770> a<00:00:41.129> and<00:00:41.520> because<00:00:42.270> I<00:00:42.480> equals<00:00:42.750> B<00:00:42.960> as<00:00:43.200> the

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
plus a and because I equals B as the

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.400 
plus a and because I equals B as the
initial<00:00:43.770> condition<00:00:43.850> you<00:00:44.850> simply<00:00:45.239> replace<00:00:45.480> B

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
initial condition you simply replace B

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.260 
initial condition you simply replace B
with<00:00:46.440> a<00:00:46.710> so<00:00:46.770> get<00:00:47.039> a<00:00:47.070> equals<00:00:47.399> a<00:00:47.460> plus<00:00:47.610> a<00:00:47.879> or<00:00:48.210> a

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
with a so get a equals a plus a or a

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.610 
with a so get a equals a plus a or a
equal<00:00:48.719> to<00:00:48.899> a<00:00:48.950> however<00:00:50.840> the<00:00:51.840> initial<00:00:52.020> condition

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
equal to a however the initial condition

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.920 
equal to a however the initial condition
a<00:00:53.570> minus<00:00:54.570> a<00:00:54.870> equals<00:00:55.379> B<00:00:55.789> therefore<00:00:56.789> B<00:00:57.510> minus<00:00:57.809> a

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
a minus a equals B therefore B minus a

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:04.219 
a minus a equals B therefore B minus a
equals<00:00:58.140> 0<00:01:00.350> so<00:01:01.350> you<00:01:01.410> get<00:01:01.710> a<00:01:01.920> times<00:01:02.910> 0<00:01:03.270> equals<00:01:03.510> 0

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
equals 0 so you get a times 0 equals 0

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.380 
equals 0 so you get a times 0 equals 0
times<00:01:04.949> P<00:01:05.189> plus<00:01:05.220> a<00:01:05.670> or<00:01:05.909> 0<00:01:06.330> equals<00:01:07.320> 0<00:01:07.560> so<00:01:08.390> doesn't

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
times P plus a or 0 equals 0 so doesn't

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:10.940 
times P plus a or 0 equals 0 so doesn't
work<00:01:09.479> from<00:01:09.600> that<00:01:09.780> angle<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.380> second<00:01:10.740> problem

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
work from that angle the second problem

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.429 
work from that angle the second problem
is<00:01:11.250> that<00:01:11.670> because<00:01:12.600> we've<00:01:12.869> already<00:01:13.020> proven

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
is that because we've already proven

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.300 
is that because we've already proven
down<00:01:13.590> here<00:01:13.920> that<00:01:14.400> B<00:01:14.760> minus<00:01:15.090> a<00:01:15.210> equals<00:01:15.420> 0

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
down here that B minus a equals 0

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.609

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
minus a term means that you're dividing

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.870

dumb enough to think that this actually

dumb enough to think that this actually
is<00:01:25.259> real<00:01:25.590> then<00:01:26.400> you'd<00:01:26.580> also<00:01:26.909> think<00:01:27.180> that<00:01:27.270> the

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
is real then you'd also think that the

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.929 
is real then you'd also think that the

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
left hand limit of that is negative

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.380 
left hand limit of that is negative
infinity<00:01:43.649> because<00:01:44.430> those<00:01:44.850> limits<00:01:45.149> are<00:01:45.270> not

those two limits are not the same and

those two limits are not the same and

therefore 1 over CL does not equal
