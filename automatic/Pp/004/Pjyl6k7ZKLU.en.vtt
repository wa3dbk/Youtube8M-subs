 the negotiation of a collective agreement that according to the unions is delayed 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.940
 too much to originate from the mobilization carried out today by the workers

 main road that joins San Roque with the line so it considers the 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.630
 reaction of the Civil Guard and is that as explained by the representative 

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:37.640

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:56.890

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.470
 incorporate us already know everything and in a symbolic way only carrying 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:04.620
 a banner nothing of rare thing or pierre nothing because the fruit not only we

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.960
 the salary differences based on seniority and the hardening of 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.260
 the penalties for a penny 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.350

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:10.749
