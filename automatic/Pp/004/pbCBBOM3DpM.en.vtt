00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.010
 well we are playing today 

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:04.490
 blackberry storm 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:08.100
 that was the first blackberry and transferring the market and how good 

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:12.920
 that in a certain way marcano hulu side session company percent in 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.360
 a chair practiced corporate asia 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.240
 the final consumer market 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.940
 the truth is that it is a team that ended up liking much more than both 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.140
 I would have waited I'm not need a fan the phones stolen crime 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.579
 well when the phone is locked and you have something interesting that 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:34.480
 was born with the speech and not with the parts are the buttons integrated to the 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:35.819
 house face on the button 

00:00:35.819 --> 00:00:40.219
 in the blockade and then my silence when for reasons what timely the 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:40.789
 team 

00:00:40.789 --> 00:00:43.210
 turns on and unlocks 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.980
 if everything works well if everything works well percent and how will they realize 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.970
 like all equipment tashkent that price and in day 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:53.970
 that not only from oovoo accelerometer or whatever you want to call it 

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:57.449
 that I decided to be at the common telephone by the display it 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.480
 which is that in the case of this type of equipment that ride from udine 

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:02.510
 specifically for together 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.250
 these horizons to play multimedia 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.190
 I always say the same thing in st 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:09.720
 type of equipment 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.969
 percent the multimedia to finish ended up being a value 

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:18.569
 differential and fundamental in this case for example the music is really 

00:01:18.569 --> 00:01:19.600
 Awesome 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.600
 tinum who take mentor case I have a 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:29.290
 finally a card of eight chairs but if I'm not wrong I think I would believe 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:31.039
 that postpone until one of 

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:32.759
 on the 16th and 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.289
 which they really too 

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:39.590
 the ability to take videos that only surpassed by the 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.979
 look at this and the quality of the video I do not know if it can 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.350
 see appreciate well 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.830
 but good that doing paper with my son but 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:48.909
 nowadays 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:52.649
 nor the colors that the plant has is really impressive 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.080
 and one of the things that has good attack 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:57.430
 as 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:02.170
 he knew from either side is not true when he is showing social objects 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.700
 of interest in your mouth against united NATO and Russia 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.429
 tnt choose the legislator that you will not give 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.400
 in this case only rossi yesterday put the scare 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.539
 the advantage of closing the buttons of physicists 

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:17.539
 on this side in order to have the entire menu 

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:19.350
 available 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.049
 with just one finger and with this money 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:23.300
 can handle it 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.300
 and as every summer there is an interesting thing soto touching the screen 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:28.889
 but the screen but on the screen 

00:02:28.889 --> 00:02:30.539
 nothing happens 

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:33.000
 because why this screen is so real 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.819
 has the peculiarity that 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:40.819
 you can touch it but to select the new one you have to press what 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:45.619
 actively because because the peseta like I do not know if it existed manages to listen 

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:49.339
 really this but i the ballot 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:56.480
 as it counts up a few things for a hundred thousand settlers a few sensors 

00:02:56.479 --> 00:03:01.939
 well I think it gives you a cool file ap that these are effectively fingering 

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:07.059
 we are clicking on one of your friends for example if we go home 

00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:10.190
 for 100 goals choose what we choose 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.319
 after being a month or month and a half earlier than expected and the remains 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:14.829
 when one touches 

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:17.909
 the keys 

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:20.370
 it automatically starts 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.490
 indefinite or rather agree 

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:26.780
 i the ticketek poker fitb is playing 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:30.590
 in my case that his party image or break the walls 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.240
 that's why his report a lawyer reminded that equality work goes like 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:37.030
 gods but in this case of ronaldo 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:41.300
 and the reality is that when it's a bit smaller than mine 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:46.140
 the rope that could be eligible we forget to make the equipment work 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:49.000
 in a much faster way the patient and the one that is working 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.899
 with me and what I said before when turning the bands are apoquinar 

00:03:52.899 --> 00:03:57.339
 effectively for any of the sides taking efe with the hand a shot 

00:03:57.339 --> 00:03:58.889
 my case and right 

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:00.409
 g squeeze 

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:03.389
 you can choose and cyber automatically 

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:04.240
 the menu 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:07.369
 and choose the very impressed menu and everything else 

00:04:07.369 --> 00:04:09.770
 no pablo part of cell phones 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:13.660
 it was what I saw portugal to squeeze out well as it fails to sell anything for the 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:14.240
 style 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:18.500
 in a sample of that one of the interesting things you have that this time not 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.269
 has in multitouch 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:22.370
 but what it does have is 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:25.420
 something quite interesting we no longer have clues to choose 

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:29.140
 what little in enlarging images as has the multitask incompression 

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:33.950
 quite interesting for example 2 148 May sigler of which the truth 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:38.230
 almost all day and choke the morning my pc then what I do is little you 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:41.390
 lasted the first as the onoto plus i what 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:46.180
 erase look how the first one 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:50.550
 remove for pc delete or not ap says to remove them 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:53.350
 if you want to delete the positive ads and automatically 

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:58.580
 I started paying to delete the messages that I have that 7 I repeat it is a team 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:00.610
 that surprised me very much 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:03.779
 very much for a hundred especially coming from a brand 

00:05:03.779 --> 00:05:08.309
 who has no experience in team multimedia equipment 

00:05:08.309 --> 00:05:11.309
 the final impulse last the same time but the conclusions 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:15.410
 really solid they were compared really put back 

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:18.790
 i really is one of the best educated theaters believe that there is in the 

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:18.930
 market
