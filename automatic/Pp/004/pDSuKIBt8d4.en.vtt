00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:16.110
 people ask me and ask 

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:17.130
 suggestions for exercises to train a 

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:20.910
 Bible 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:23.430
 well this is a very comprehensive question 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.260
 Actually, I'll be ahead of you. 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.900
 that if you really want to study 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:31.440
 I understood in the franchise will be getting a good 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.870
 years studying practicing this float 

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:35.879
 there maybe a lifetime I know 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.370
 majority when speaking in phobia refers 

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:41.190
 here by human but I understand that the term 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.560
 anatomy that can serve a lot 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.110
 of other things to us when we draw 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:49.470
 horses can I help the anatomy of 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:52.800
 horses was to design ships and improve 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:54.480
 autonomy that birds and each bird will have 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.440
 an autonomy different professions 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.360
 many different 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.680
 so basically I would say never 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:04.170
 but I think I understood more or less 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.810
 that the girl have minds want some 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:09.000
 exercises more introductory suggestions and 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.610
 mainly legal with an image in the 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.610
 internet and try to produce good 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:17.520
 besides what is out there in fact I 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.950
 can I give you a suggestion if you gave the suggestion 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.060
 more fun you can try on 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.790
 House 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.880
 one of the great problems of learning 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.710
 to draw on the human towel is the question 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.990
 of the autonomies boos 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.250
 basically people do not have bodies 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.830
 equals 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.710
 I only mean men and women 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:40.409
 but males varied young types 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.720
 various types of women and women 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.200
 varied types of ages varied types 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.780
 ethnicities and so on 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.479
 when we lose and get away 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:53.360
 drawing that does not believe in such a model 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:55.729
 half valued - a bit more 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:58.909
 complete to those who work with the idea 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:02.270
 vary ethnicities but usually show 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:03.259
 adult figures with bodies 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.030
 at times 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:07.520
 not so much the comic book tale 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:10.519
 Americans more bodies better 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:13.880
 defined the basic exercise would be you 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:16.209
 and the bodies and variations of 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.769
 child seems object two variations 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:20.660
 elderly and so on 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:23.900
 takes people or even people very 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:26.540
 Lean people with stores but I have one 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.980
 exercise that they are all a bit more 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.590
 funny 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.510
 Pay attention to exercise consists of 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:35.030
 you make five versions of one 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.880
 character you like can be a 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:40.190
 character of a manga or a character of 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.450
 some cartoon or the option of 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.220
 Super hero 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:46.430
 I just do not recommend you take too 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:48.680
 used scarton because there you 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:51.590
 will have drop another question 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:54.590
 so try a cool work drawing 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:58.060
 and proportions a little more real then 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:00.470
 suppose you get a great 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:03.620
 the first exercise shall be as follows 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:06.799
 'You will draw the character as he 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:09.200
 It is not to be strong if it is pumped and 

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:12.980
 adults and children this is how you went 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:15.380
 drawing is going to copy the drawing 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:17.030
 This one's even for you to understand more 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.459
 men like his structure the 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.410
 dress the characteristics but only 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:24.560
 for that first in batman's car 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:26.989
 he is a grown man a strong body 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:29.840
 after it's done and if you're going to do more 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:32.870
 four variant versions that will be 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.829
 different parts 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:36.290
 you want 

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:37.790
 that is if the matchmaker a grown man 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.710
 it is strong 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:42.320
 You go after it 's his aggression. 

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:44.750
 very skinny here from a version of 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:48.890
 batman according to batman version 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:52.250
 old man has my skeleton of steel and a 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:54.110
 version of his bacuri child ten t 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:56.480
 you can expand this to several 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:59.420
 characters you take for example the one 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:02.330
 female character good think that the 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:04.640
 Mr. world for example said it 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:06.380
 a young girl a teenage chicken 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:09.710
 then what will be the other four 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:12.380
 versions of it make a second rope goes 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:15.610
 draw sure pumping you go 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:17.960
 to draw a second child and an old 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:20.600
 and so on 

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:22.040
 you will be the total five drawings one 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.990
 of the characters as he is 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:26.450
 the other four with good anatomy 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:27.260
 different manual or e there begins to 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:28.790
 fun 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.980
 notice that you will work with 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:34.010
 When the guy is supposed to be 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:38.000
 Fat is fat even when to 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:39.710
 being old is well asks cachectic is not only 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.200
 put a little mouth that are there to 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:45.890
 to draw very old fear with which my 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:46.670
 And they made the grace right there. 

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:49.220
 in you 

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:51.800
 structure does not take is corresponding to 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:53.990
 this age or profile in the tower 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:56.450
 so if you were to draw the character 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:59.060
 that you see that the bombed and the course 

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:01.490
 are very similar probably 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:03.080
 something is not well resolved 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:05.000
 This is an exercise that I 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:07.070
 and they are fun to do. 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.260
 and helps to break certain prejudices 

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:11.270
 mainly because it forces you to 

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:13.760
 rethink a figure that you are very 

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:15.650
 used and you can do it with several 

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:18.350
 other characters is a way of you 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:19.700
 to play with this thing of thinking about 

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:22.490
 Anatomy variants 

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:25.040
 but of course do not be alone in this is just a 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:26.700
 Exercise Tip More Than You Can 

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:30.640
 come into your house 

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:34.440
 have fun then this is it 

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:34.440
 we are talking
