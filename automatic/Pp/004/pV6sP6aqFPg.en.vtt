and cut that out I cut out my first
layer<00:00:40.440> in<00:00:41.440> purple<00:00:42.010> and<00:00:42.160> I<00:00:42.340> did<00:00:42.550> this<00:00:42.730> at<00:00:42.970> four

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:43.720 
layer in purple and I did this at four

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.500 
layer in purple and I did this at four
by<00:00:44.230> five<00:00:44.440> and<00:00:44.649> a<00:00:44.710> quarter<00:00:44.920> and<00:00:45.309> then<00:00:46.180> I<00:00:46.270> cut<00:00:46.450> out

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:46.510 
by five and a quarter and then I cut out

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:50.010 
by five and a quarter and then I cut out
some<00:00:46.780> glittery<00:00:47.200> patterned<00:00:47.770> paper<00:00:48.100> at<00:00:48.899> two<00:00:49.899> and

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:50.020 
some glittery patterned paper at two and

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.090 
some glittery patterned paper at two and
a<00:00:50.079> half<00:00:50.399> by<00:00:51.399> five<00:00:52.329> and<00:00:52.510> a<00:00:52.600> quarter<00:00:52.840> so<00:00:53.649> it's<00:00:53.829> the

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:54.100 
a half by five and a quarter so it's the

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.639 
a half by five and a quarter so it's the
same<00:00:54.130> length<00:00:54.820> as<00:00:55.090> the<00:00:55.120> purple<00:00:55.660> but<00:00:56.410> it's

00:00:56.639 --> 00:00:56.649 
same length as the purple but it's

00:00:56.649 --> 00:00:58.110 
same length as the purple but it's
shorter<00:00:57.100> and<00:00:57.250> the<00:00:57.370> reason<00:00:57.670> that<00:00:57.700> I<00:00:57.820> did<00:00:58.000> it

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:58.120 
shorter and the reason that I did it

00:00:58.120 --> 00:00:59.790 
shorter and the reason that I did it
short<00:00:58.360> is<00:00:58.480> because<00:00:58.690> I'm<00:00:58.780> going<00:00:58.930> to<00:00:58.989> be<00:00:59.050> doing<00:00:59.230> a

00:00:59.790 --> 00:00:59.800 
short is because I'm going to be doing a

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.799 
short is because I'm going to be doing a

out<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.539> face<00:01:58.530> of<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.920> card<00:01:59.189> going<00:01:59.820> the<00:02:00.060> long

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
out the face of the card going the long

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.910 
out the face of the card going the long
way<00:02:00.270> so<00:02:00.509> that<00:02:00.659> we<00:02:00.869> can<00:02:01.020> do<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.259> things<00:02:01.500> on<00:02:01.770> the

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
way so that we can do the things on the

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.399 
way so that we can do the things on the
side<00:02:02.100> like<00:02:02.340> this<00:02:02.630> okay<00:02:03.630> so<00:02:03.990> let's<00:02:04.229> go<00:02:04.380> ahead

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
side like this okay so let's go ahead

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.160 
side like this okay so let's go ahead
and<00:02:04.560> put<00:02:04.740> this<00:02:04.890> together<00:02:05.869> first<00:02:06.869> we're<00:02:07.080> going

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
and put this together first we're going

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.600 
and put this together first we're going
to<00:02:07.259> be<00:02:07.380> doing<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:08.280> threading<00:02:08.729> water<00:02:08.970> punch

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
to be doing the threading water punch

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:16.490 
to be doing the threading water punch
and<00:02:11.610> mine<00:02:11.880> is<00:02:12.090> the<00:02:12.239> fiskars<00:02:12.720> one<00:02:14.959> and<00:02:15.959> it's

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
and mine is the fiskars one and it's

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.430 
and mine is the fiskars one and it's
really<00:02:16.709> easy<00:02:16.830> all<00:02:17.459> you<00:02:17.489> have<00:02:17.670> to<00:02:17.940> do<00:02:18.090> is<00:02:18.440> once

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
really easy all you have to do is once

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.259 
really easy all you have to do is once
you<00:02:19.590> punch<00:02:19.830> it<00:02:20.010> out<00:02:20.069> you<00:02:20.280> just<00:02:20.459> line<00:02:20.850> it<00:02:20.880> up<00:02:21.090> on

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:21.269 
you punch it out you just line it up on

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:24.350 
you punch it out you just line it up on
the<00:02:21.390> sides<00:02:21.660> it<00:02:21.900> has<00:02:21.930> um<00:02:22.549> the<00:02:23.549> same<00:02:23.819> powder<00:02:24.060> than

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
the sides it has um the same powder than

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.610 
the sides it has um the same powder than
your<00:02:24.540> that<00:02:24.750> you're<00:02:24.870> punching<00:02:25.110> it's<00:02:25.410> kind<00:02:25.590> of

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
your that you're punching it's kind of

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.559 
your that you're punching it's kind of
hard<00:02:25.799> to<00:02:25.830> do<00:02:26.010> like<00:02:26.280> that<00:02:26.459> but<00:02:26.970> the<00:02:27.360> same

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
hard to do like that but the same

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:29.120 
hard to do like that but the same
pattern<00:02:27.930> that<00:02:28.049> you're<00:02:28.200> punching<00:02:28.440> out<00:02:28.769> and

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
pattern that you're punching out and

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.460 
pattern that you're punching out and
have<00:02:29.340> it<00:02:29.370> on<00:02:29.580> the<00:02:29.700> sides<00:02:29.970> so<00:02:30.870> you<00:02:30.900> line<00:02:31.230> it<00:02:31.260> up

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
have it on the sides so you line it up

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.949 
have it on the sides so you line it up
and<00:02:31.709> it<00:02:31.799> just<00:02:32.010> keeps<00:02:32.430> going<00:02:32.700> so<00:02:33.630> you<00:02:33.750> can<00:02:33.840> get

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
and it just keeps going so you can get

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:47.750 
and it just keeps going so you can get
the<00:02:34.170> whole<00:02:34.380> side<00:02:34.860> of<00:02:34.890> the<00:02:35.130> paper

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.460 

ok<00:02:48.650> we're<00:02:49.650> going<00:02:49.769> to<00:02:49.830> be<00:02:50.810> adhering<00:02:51.810> this<00:02:52.110> down

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
ok we're going to be adhering this down

00:02:59.839 --> 00:02:59.849 
to the end of the threading water

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:02.360 
to the end of the threading water
because<00:03:00.269> I<00:03:00.420> want<00:03:00.659> to<00:03:00.750> put<00:03:01.140> this<00:03:01.170> at<00:03:01.590> the<00:03:01.620> end<00:03:01.769> so

I'm going to put this as close as
possible<00:03:03.629> without<00:03:04.319> covering<00:03:05.180> the<00:03:09.379> actual

00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:10.379 
possible without covering the actual

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:16.670 
possible without covering the actual
design<00:03:10.799> of<00:03:11.000> the<00:03:12.000> punch

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:27.490 

I'll<00:03:16.859> be<00:03:17.010> putting<00:03:17.250> those<00:03:18.530> very<00:03:19.530> much

so that's what it gonna look like and

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:33.100 
so that's what it gonna look like and

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:37.020 

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:38.990 

first<00:03:37.650> I'm<00:03:37.860> going<00:03:38.010> to<00:03:38.070> be<00:03:38.160> putting<00:03:38.370> the<00:03:38.550> ribbon

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
first I'm going to be putting the ribbon

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.790 
first I'm going to be putting the ribbon
and<00:03:39.780> I<00:03:39.840> decided<00:03:40.140> to<00:03:40.320> do<00:03:40.440> some<00:03:40.650> orange<00:03:41.130> ribbon

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:42.800 
and I decided to do some orange ribbon

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.930 
and I decided to do some orange ribbon
I'm<00:03:43.800> going<00:03:44.010> to<00:03:44.070> do<00:03:44.190> it<00:03:44.310> like<00:03:44.400> right<00:03:44.670> in<00:03:44.730> the

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
I'm going to do it like right in the

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:50.870 
I'm going to do it like right in the
middle<00:03:45.240> I<00:03:48.380> get<00:03:49.380> my<00:03:49.500> tape<00:03:49.800> and<00:03:50.460> we're<00:03:50.670> going<00:03:50.820> to

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
middle I get my tape and we're going to

00:03:50.880 --> 00:04:02.559 
middle I get my tape and we're going to
be<00:03:51.000> doing<00:03:52.910> the<00:03:53.910> cheater<00:03:54.330> method

00:04:02.559 --> 00:04:02.569 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:04.599 

so<00:04:03.079> you<00:04:03.140> basically<00:04:03.379> tape<00:04:03.920> the<00:04:04.129> ends<00:04:04.310> at<00:04:04.489> the

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:04.609 
so you basically tape the ends at the

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:12.240 
so you basically tape the ends at the
back

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:23.950 

and<00:04:12.730> then<00:04:12.880> you<00:04:13.030> try<00:04:13.300> your<00:04:13.570> bowl

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:23.960 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:28.710 

whoa<00:04:24.800> to<00:04:24.860> be<00:04:25.160> right<00:04:25.430> in<00:04:25.610> center

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.360 

just<00:04:29.140> trying<00:04:29.380> to<00:04:29.410> make<00:04:29.530> sure<00:04:29.560> I<00:04:29.740> get<00:04:29.890> both<00:04:30.130> of

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.370 
just trying to make sure I get both of

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:32.870 
just trying to make sure I get both of
my

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:32.880 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:41.450 

satin<00:04:33.720> sanctum<00:04:34.290> village

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:53.180 

go<00:04:42.150> ahead<00:04:42.449> and<00:04:42.479> trim<00:04:42.810> off<00:04:43.020> the<00:04:43.259> edges

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:53.190 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:55.100 

and<00:04:53.580> then<00:04:54.000> we're<00:04:54.210> going<00:04:54.300> to<00:04:54.390> go<00:04:54.540> ahead<00:04:54.600> and

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:55.110 
and then we're going to go ahead and

00:04:55.110 --> 00:05:08.090 
and then we're going to go ahead and
burn<00:04:55.410> off<00:04:55.620> our<00:04:55.830> edges

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:08.100 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:11.450 

and<00:05:08.220> that<00:05:08.820> just<00:05:09.090> keeps<00:05:09.330> it<00:05:09.540> from<00:05:10.190> fraying<00:05:11.190> at

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:11.460 
and that just keeps it from fraying at

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:15.200 
and that just keeps it from fraying at
the<00:05:11.580> end

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:15.210 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:17.100 

then<00:05:16.210> we're<00:05:16.360> going<00:05:16.450> to<00:05:16.540> go<00:05:16.690> ahead<00:05:16.720> and<00:05:16.930> then

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:17.110 
then we're going to go ahead and then

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:18.990 
then we're going to go ahead and then
hear<00:05:17.350> this<00:05:17.380> down<00:05:17.740> to<00:05:17.950> our<00:05:18.040> card<00:05:18.370> base<00:05:18.640> before

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:19.000 
hear this down to our card base before

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:47.900 
hear this down to our card base before
we<00:05:19.270> put<00:05:19.480> our<00:05:19.570> fangs

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:47.910 

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:52.279 

I'm<00:05:48.270> just<00:05:48.510> going<00:05:48.720> to<00:05:48.780> Center<00:05:49.200> it<00:05:49.230> on<00:05:49.350> the<00:05:49.530> card

00:05:52.279 --> 00:05:52.289 

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:55.690
