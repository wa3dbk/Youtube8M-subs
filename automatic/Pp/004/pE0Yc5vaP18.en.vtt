00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.620

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:09.290
My name is Mark D'Cruz of Ma-Ke Bonsai and today I'm going to talk to you about Ficus bonsais.

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:13.250
Ficus come in many different forms and shapes.

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:20.170
The most popular one is the Ficus Retusa or the Chinese Banyon as it's called.

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:28.100
Then we have the Ficus Carica which is very hardy and grows in the Mediterranean part of the world.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:32.320
And then last but not least is the Ficus Panda.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:42.317
Ficus are easy to recognise. They usually have dark green waxy leaves and they are usually ??

00:00:42.317 --> 00:00:44.460

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:52.340
The Ficus Carica, on the other hand, has a palmate kind of shape, with three palms rather than five.

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:59.250
The Ficus Panda has a roundish leaf shape or a deltoid leaf shape.

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:05.750
In the UK or in Europe, they will not survive outdoors so they can only grow indoors.

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:15.742
They start off as low shrub growing trees so they can actually take quite low levels of light.

00:01:15.742 --> 00:01:15.850

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:23.860
I know trees that do about 400 Lux to 500 Lux and they do quite happily with that kind of lighting.

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:33.855
They like a humidity of about 65% and above. Ficus Panda need to be watered quite regularly.

00:01:33.855 --> 00:01:34.760

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:40.140
Pots should be watered when it is feeling dry to the touch, and when you do water it,

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.450
water it thoroughly so that water drains right through
 the pot.

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:50.090
Do not let the Ficus Pandas waterlog because their roots rot very, very easily.

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:55.550
If you let the Ficus' dry out, they will drop their leaves.

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:02.490
They are very susceptible to extreme changes in water levels in their roots.

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:08.300
Feed the Ficus about three to four times in the 
growing season.

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:17.300
Use a balanced feed of 4/4/4 or perhaps even a 6/6/6 
at the most.

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:24.380
If you're using a liquid feed, then feed it every 15 days or every two weeks.

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:30.850
Ficus' are robust trees so they are quite resistant 
to pests.

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:36.150
The only thing that they really suffer from is scale. Ficus' can suffer a lot from scale.

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:44.180
You can treat the scale with a weak solution of soapy water and oil.

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:52.830
I use one teaspoon of Fairy liquid to one teaspoon of olive oil in one litre of water

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.160
and then spray it with a spray gun.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:01.250
With reference to humidity, again, spraying a Ficus as often as you can is great.

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:06.020
The Ficus' like to be sprayed regularly.

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:10.810
Ficus are vigorous growers and you prune them as and when required.

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.810
They are continuous growers so they grow all through the year, Winter or Spring.

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:21.050
They don't really have an extended dormant period like other species.

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:22.960
They tend to be continuously growing.

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:26.850
Ficus cuttings have a very high success rate.

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:34.500
All you have to do is keep them in a humid environment and 80 or 90% of all cuttings will root.

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:39.800
If you get seeds, they need to be sown very fast or as soon as they arrive,

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:45.650
because Ficus' seeds do not have a shelf life, so they have to be very, very fresh when they are sown.

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:50.820
When it comes to repotting, Ficus' can be repotted because they are vigorous growers, can be repotted

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:56.000
every two to three years. The older Ficus', perhaps every four to five years.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.580
And that's how you care for Ficus bonsai.

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:03.460
