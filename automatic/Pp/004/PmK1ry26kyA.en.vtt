you know couldn't get them off our
offense<00:05:06.390> was<00:05:06.540> a<00:05:06.570> pretty<00:05:06.810> good<00:05:06.960> defense

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:07.110 
offense was a pretty good defense

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:09.080 
offense was a pretty good defense
because<00:05:07.740> even<00:05:08.160> though<00:05:08.280> we<00:05:08.520> didn't<00:05:08.700> go<00:05:08.820> light

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:09.090
