hello<00:00:00.630> and<00:00:00.810> welcome<00:00:01.140> to<00:00:01.170> broach<00:00:01.500> all<00:00:01.770> this

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:02.159 
hello and welcome to broach all this

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:04.340 
hello and welcome to broach all this
time<00:00:02.310> we<00:00:02.399> have<00:00:02.520> decomposition<00:00:03.360> the<00:00:04.020> mud<00:00:04.200> adds

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
time we have decomposition the mud adds

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.170 
time we have decomposition the mud adds
a<00:00:04.470> new<00:00:04.589> decomposing<00:00:05.370> system<00:00:05.700> for<00:00:05.879> dead<00:00:06.000> bodies

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
a new decomposing system for dead bodies

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.780 
a new decomposing system for dead bodies
to<00:00:06.509> the<00:00:06.600> game<00:00:06.830> the<00:00:07.830> muds<00:00:08.040> very<00:00:08.280> much<00:00:08.490> a<00:00:08.519> work<00:00:08.760> in

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
to the game the muds very much a work in

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.759 
to the game the muds very much a work in
progress<00:00:09.179> and<00:00:09.630> it's<00:00:09.780> only<00:00:09.900> the<00:00:10.080> first<00:00:10.230> version

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
progress and it's only the first version

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:12.020 
progress and it's only the first version
so<00:00:10.980> keep<00:00:11.190> that<00:00:11.340> in<00:00:11.429> mind<00:00:11.610> as<00:00:11.790> you're<00:00:11.910> watching

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
so keep that in mind as you're watching

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:12.770 
so keep that in mind as you're watching

the<00:00:27.119> decomposition<00:00:27.599> works<00:00:28.019> using<00:00:28.320> a<00:00:28.410> shader

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
the decomposition works using a shader

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.080 
the decomposition works using a shader
that<00:00:28.800> eats<00:00:29.070> away<00:00:29.220> at<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:29.429> body<00:00:29.670> and<00:00:29.939> the

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
that eats away at the body and the

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.400 
that eats away at the body and the
effect<00:00:30.390> it<00:00:30.539> gives<00:00:30.570> is<00:00:30.929> similar<00:00:31.199> to<00:00:31.320> the

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
effect it gives is similar to the

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.020 
effect it gives is similar to the
necromancy<00:00:31.980> effects<00:00:32.279> mod<00:00:32.489> we<00:00:32.669> covered<00:00:32.910> not

humanoids go through the most stages of
decomposition<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.809> first<00:00:43.079> few<00:00:43.260> stages<00:00:43.469> is

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
decomposition the first few stages is

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.709 
decomposition the first few stages is
where<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.040> bodies<00:00:44.280> slowly<00:00:44.640> eaten<00:00:44.940> away<00:00:45.180> until

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
where the bodies slowly eaten away until

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
eventually it turns into a dragger

eventually it turns into a dragger
looking<00:00:47.399> body<00:00:47.579> and<00:00:47.879> then<00:00:48.059> after<00:00:48.300> a<00:00:48.329> few<00:00:48.420> more

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780

looking body and then after a few more
days<00:00:48.930> it<00:00:49.170> turns<00:00:49.379> into<00:00:49.559> a<00:00:49.649> skeleton<00:00:50.149> animals<00:00:51.149> go

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
days it turns into a skeleton animals go

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.670 
days it turns into a skeleton animals go
through<00:00:51.300> a<00:00:51.510> similar<00:00:51.750> process<00:00:51.899> but<00:00:52.320> without

the<00:00:54.960> author<00:00:55.079> plans<00:00:55.320> to<00:00:55.440> add<00:00:55.559> extra<00:00:55.829> stages<00:00:56.280> in

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
the author plans to add extra stages in

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.000 
the author plans to add extra stages in

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
the future searching a body also opens

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.349 
the future searching a body also opens
up<00:00:59.100> a<00:00:59.160> dialog<00:00:59.550> box<00:00:59.820> where<00:01:00.030> you<00:01:00.120> can<00:01:00.210> either

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
up a dialog box where you can either

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.900 
up a dialog box where you can either
leave<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.690> body<00:01:00.840> to<00:01:00.989> rot<00:01:01.170> or<00:01:01.500> bury<00:01:01.710> it<00:01:01.890> as<00:01:02.129> of

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
leave the body to rot or bury it as of

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.369 
leave the body to rot or bury it as of
right<00:01:03.030> now<00:01:03.090> buddies<00:01:03.570> don't<00:01:03.750> just<00:01:03.899> decompose

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
right now buddies don't just decompose

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.080 
right now buddies don't just decompose
and<00:01:04.589> then<00:01:04.680> disappear<00:01:05.159> so<00:01:05.489> eventually<00:01:05.939> you'll

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
and then disappear so eventually you'll

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.190 
and then disappear so eventually you'll
have<00:01:06.210> to<00:01:06.390> bury<00:01:06.570> them<00:01:06.750> unless<00:01:06.900> you<00:01:06.960> want<00:01:07.170> a

have to bury them unless you want a

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.410 
have to bury them unless you want a
