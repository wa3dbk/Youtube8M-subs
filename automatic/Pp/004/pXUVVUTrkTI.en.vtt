00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.359
 &gt;&gt; Welcome to the product design exhibition. 

00:00:02.612 --> 00:00:05.014
 I am Vince Penman. &gt;&gt; I am Allison Toepperwein. 

00:00:05.214 --> 00:00:08.853
 Today we will discuss the motorcycle design together. 

00:00:16.022 --> 00:00:21.447
 &gt;&gt; This story is on dbbp.com, which is the most popular product for all motorcycle enthusiasts. 

00:00:21.647 --> 00:00:26.302
 Mark van der Kwaak's earliest motorcycle was the beautiful 1964 Triumph. 

00:00:26.502 --> 00:00:31.252
 At that time he decided to remove the rear suspension, 

00:00:31.452 --> 00:00:34.416
 Lower the body to make it look more retro. 

00:00:34.616 --> 00:00:39.887
 Mark has CAD modeling every element of the project, including the fork design. 

00:00:40.087 --> 00:00:41.944
 The car is still under construction. 

00:00:42.144 --> 00:00:46.148
 You can track this project on dbbp.com. 

00:00:46.348 --> 00:00:51.271
 &gt;&gt; If you are too cumbersome, let Ducati introduce this unique craft project. 

00:00:51.471 --> 00:00:56.888
 It takes only ten minutes to build a new Ducati 796. 

00:00:57.088 --> 00:01:01.587
 Select the original painting, use the equipment to change the fuel tank, 

00:01:01.787 --> 00:01:04.173
 The appearance of the bezel, front bezel and seat cover. 

00:01:04.373 --> 00:01:06.382
 It's really refreshing. 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.120
 &gt;&gt; I want to put a decorative bullet hole in my car and win the envy of the brothers. 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:20.760
 Ducati's custom detailing is a safer way to install bullet holes than any other idea. 

00:01:20.813 --> 00:01:22.760
 Stupid jumping. 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.899
 Norton Motorcycle announced 

00:01:26.099 --> 00:01:29.445
 The latest engine structure of the new version of the dream comando motorcycle, 

00:01:29.645 --> 00:01:34.056
 Such a bold design requires a certain amount of courage. 

00:01:34.256 --> 00:01:38.789
 Picture of high gloss aluminum clutch parts and accessories 

00:01:38.989 --> 00:01:41.576
 Make it a design inspiration. 

00:01:41.776 --> 00:01:45.039
 There are 660 parts in the engine. 

00:01:45.239 --> 00:01:51.770
 Norton uses Creo Parametric to design and track all the ideal parts for each edition. 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:57.555
 This CAD software design environment helps to achieve accuracy, power and performance requirements. 

00:01:57.755 --> 00:02:01.800
 Speaking of a truly chic car, take a look at Uno, a fully electric motorcycle. 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.046
 Not only can pedal or throttle control be used, but even brake control, but there will be some tilt. 

00:02:07.246 --> 00:02:11.041
 The computer on the console provides power to the engine, which solves the traditional control problem. 

00:02:11.241 --> 00:02:16.007
 Recently, Brad Harkavy, CEO of BPG Engine, also explained to me. 

00:02:16.207 --> 00:02:20.951
 &gt;&gt; In terms of craftsmanship, there is a method called “reverse hammer” 

00:02:21.151 --> 00:02:26.266
 However, this is the solution for ordinary people. If you are willing to pick up the broom, put it at the end of your finger to make it in balance. 

00:02:26.466 --> 00:02:31.048
 Once the broom starts to tilt, you quickly act to balance it again. 

00:02:31.248 --> 00:02:32.885
 The principle of the car is like this. 

00:02:33.085 --> 00:02:35.391
 So you don't have to do everything the driver should do. 

00:02:35.591 --> 00:02:39.906
 There is a very intelligent software here, which is said to be the center of quality. 

00:02:40.106 --> 00:02:43.783
 That is, people sit on wheels that are based on the center of gravity. 

00:02:43.983 --> 00:02:48.059
 Therefore, if the person is in front of the center of gravity, it will accelerate the wheel. 

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:50.733
 &gt;&gt; Of course, you must wear a helmet when driving. 

00:02:50.933 --> 00:02:56.216
 French designer Kevin Goupil designed a new bicycle helmet made of cork. 

00:02:56.416 --> 00:03:01.491
 There is no doubt that cork is a commonly used renewable resource for sealing bottles. 

00:03:01.691 --> 00:03:08.517
 This will protect the more valuable things than the 1787 Chateau Lafite - the human brain. 

00:03:08.717 --> 00:03:12.528
 The helmet uses cork because cork has the best shock absorption. 

00:03:12.728 --> 00:03:16.672
 Popular after the Second World War, French Army Helmet 

00:03:16.872 --> 00:03:22.354
 The style of production is that they are immersed in the style of repelling the invaders. 

00:03:22.554 --> 00:03:26.489
 &gt;&gt; Designing a motorcycle requires engineers to collaborate to complete surface finishing, 

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:29.183
 Work on electronic equipment, components, and large assemblies. 

00:03:29.383 --> 00:03:33.218
 You can learn more about Creo Parametric, a collaborative design environment. 

00:03:33.418 --> 00:03:40.341
 Norton has been used in bold redesigns at ptc.com/go/creoparametric. 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:41.800
 &gt;&gt; This week only. 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.240
 If you want to make suggestions about product design and make it reflected in this exhibition, 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.120
 Please send an email to productdesignshow@engineering.com. 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.120
 Next week's product design exhibition, 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.680
 We will introduce the unique design of agricultural machinery.
