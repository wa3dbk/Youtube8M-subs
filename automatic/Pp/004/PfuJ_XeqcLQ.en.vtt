00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
players in the group are and you can

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.399

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:12.609 
on the situation you are in

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:14.849 
on the situation you are in
you<00:03:12.849> can<00:03:13.299> played<00:03:13.480> solo<00:03:13.900> or<00:03:14.290> you<00:03:14.379> can<00:03:14.530> group<00:03:14.680> up

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:14.859 
you can played solo or you can group up

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:16.140 
you can played solo or you can group up
with<00:03:15.069> three<00:03:15.280> other<00:03:15.430> players<00:03:15.669> and<00:03:16.030> the

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
with three other players and the

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.059 
with three other players and the
companion<00:03:16.569> gaming<00:03:16.840> so<00:03:17.260> it's<00:03:17.409> essentially

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:18.069 
companion gaming so it's essentially

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:19.500 
companion gaming so it's essentially
four<00:03:18.310> players<00:03:18.519> running<00:03:18.879> around<00:03:19.030> in<00:03:19.299> the<00:03:19.359> world

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
four players running around in the world

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.809 
four players running around in the world
exploring<00:03:20.319> the<00:03:20.560> story<00:03:20.859> doing<00:03:21.579> all<00:03:21.700> those

00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:21.819 
exploring the story doing all those

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:24.330 
exploring the story doing all those
things<00:03:22.120> together<00:03:22.450> but<00:03:23.290> then<00:03:23.500> we<00:03:23.680> have<00:03:23.859> some

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
things together but then we have some

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.699 
things together but then we have some
other<00:03:24.639> areas<00:03:25.180> which<00:03:25.510> are<00:03:25.659> our<00:03:25.870> PvP<00:03:26.349> areas

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
other areas which are our PvP areas

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:29.610 
other areas which are our PvP areas
which<00:03:27.250> is<00:03:27.400> seamlessly<00:03:28.060> can<00:03:28.480> go<00:03:28.599> into<00:03:28.810> and<00:03:29.500> when

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
which is seamlessly can go into and when

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.159 
which is seamlessly can go into and when
you<00:03:29.739> do<00:03:29.919> there<00:03:30.250> are<00:03:30.340> other<00:03:30.549> groups<00:03:30.879> of<00:03:31.510> players

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:32.169 
you do there are other groups of players

00:03:32.169 --> 00:03:34.050 
you do there are other groups of players
who<00:03:32.829> are<00:03:32.889> also<00:03:33.040> in<00:03:33.250> there<00:03:33.400> and<00:03:33.639> there<00:03:33.760> are<00:03:33.790> also

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
who are also in there and there are also

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.020 
who are also in there and there are also
story<00:03:34.419> missions<00:03:34.810> and<00:03:35.769> all<00:03:36.010> those<00:03:36.189> things<00:03:36.459> but

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
story missions and all those things but

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:38.339 
story missions and all those things but
the<00:03:37.150> thing<00:03:37.299> is<00:03:37.419> that<00:03:37.540> when<00:03:37.810> you<00:03:37.900> go<00:03:38.019> in<00:03:38.169> there

00:03:38.339 --> 00:03:38.349 
the thing is that when you go in there

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:41.339 
the thing is that when you go in there

you're in there and you know we want to
have<00:05:08.680> the<00:05:08.800> tension<00:05:09.250> of<00:05:09.580> finding<00:05:10.000> the<00:05:10.120> coolest

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:10.810 
have the tension of finding the coolest

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:13.200 
have the tension of finding the coolest
machine<00:05:10.960> gun<00:05:11.349> ever<00:05:11.680> and<00:05:12.009> you<00:05:12.729> have<00:05:12.909> to<00:05:13.060> bring

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:13.210 
machine gun ever and you have to bring

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:15.180 
machine gun ever and you have to bring
it<00:05:13.360> out<00:05:13.479> and<00:05:13.690> you<00:05:13.750> have<00:05:13.930> to<00:05:14.020> do<00:05:14.139> the<00:05:14.349> extraction

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:15.190 
it out and you have to do the extraction

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:18.029 
it out and you have to do the extraction
so<00:05:15.759> essentially<00:05:16.120> you<00:05:16.360> can<00:05:16.539> fly<00:05:16.750> a<00:05:16.780> bandit<00:05:17.349> you

00:05:18.029 --> 00:05:18.039 
so essentially you can fly a bandit you

00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:36.940 
so essentially you can fly a bandit you
can<00:05:18.310> play<00:05:18.520> bandits

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:36.950 

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:39.010
