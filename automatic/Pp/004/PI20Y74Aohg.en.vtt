stroke 250 meter set but notice

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:10.940 
stroke 250 meter set but notice
something<00:00:09.750> different<00:00:09.780> here<00:00:10.380> what<00:00:10.740> is<00:00:10.860> he

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
something different here what is he

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.169 
something different here what is he
doing<00:00:11.309> with<00:00:12.300> his<00:00:12.450> kick<00:00:12.769> notice<00:00:13.769> a<00:00:13.920> kick<00:00:14.179> yep

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
doing with his kick notice a kick yep

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.609 
doing with his kick notice a kick yep
it's<00:00:15.809> a<00:00:15.960> breaststroke<00:00:16.410> kick<00:00:16.650> so<00:00:17.310> if<00:00:17.640> he<00:00:17.820> notice

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:18.619 
it's a breaststroke kick so if he notice

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:23.660 
it's a breaststroke kick so if he notice
his<00:00:19.619> pull<00:00:20.070> breathe<00:00:20.640> kick<00:00:20.900> glide<00:00:21.900> is<00:00:22.670> very

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
his pull breathe kick glide is very

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.210 
his pull breathe kick glide is very
similar<00:00:24.060> to<00:00:24.510> way<00:00:25.230> you<00:00:25.289> would<00:00:25.800> do<00:00:26.189> a

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
similar to way you would do a

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.790 
similar to way you would do a
breaststroke<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:27.599> only<00:00:27.779> difference<00:00:28.230> is<00:00:28.470> is

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
breaststroke the only difference is is

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.749 
breaststroke the only difference is is
that<00:00:28.980> top<00:00:29.279> arm<00:00:29.580> pull<00:00:29.939> is<00:00:30.410> basically<00:00:31.410> a<00:00:31.830> crawl

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
that top arm pull is basically a crawl

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.360 
that top arm pull is basically a crawl
stroke<00:00:32.910> arm<00:00:33.690> pull<00:00:34.020> so<00:00:34.380> your<00:00:34.530> freestyle<00:00:35.070> arm

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
stroke arm pull so your freestyle arm

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.490 
stroke arm pull so your freestyle arm
pull<00:00:35.640> right<00:00:35.880> there<00:00:36.050> and<00:00:37.050> that's<00:00:37.260> when<00:00:37.410> you

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
pull right there and that's when you

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.170 
pull right there and that's when you
turn<00:00:37.680> to<00:00:37.890> breathe<00:00:38.129> and<00:00:38.399> roll<00:00:38.610> back<00:00:38.790> on<00:00:39.000> your

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
turn to breathe and roll back on your

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.049 
turn to breathe and roll back on your
belly<00:00:39.329> do<00:00:39.600> a<00:00:39.629> kick<00:00:39.960> to<00:00:40.170> Glide<00:00:40.670> all<00:00:41.670> right<00:00:41.790> so

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
belly do a kick to Glide all right so

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.410 
belly do a kick to Glide all right so
it's<00:00:42.270> pull<00:00:42.600> breathe<00:00:43.140> kick<00:00:43.879> glide<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:45.239> only

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
it's pull breathe kick glide the only

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.000 
it's pull breathe kick glide the only
difference<00:00:45.840> is<00:00:46.020> what<00:00:46.170> he's<00:00:46.320> doing<00:00:46.530> is<00:00:46.860> he's

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
difference is what he's doing is he's

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.340 
difference is what he's doing is he's
using<00:00:47.039> a<00:00:47.670> breaststroke<00:00:48.270> kick<00:00:48.480> now<00:00:49.110> don't

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
using a breaststroke kick now don't

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.160 
using a breaststroke kick now don't
necessarily<00:00:50.219> recommend<00:00:50.840> you<00:00:51.840> do<00:00:52.140> a

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
necessarily recommend you do a

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.779 
necessarily recommend you do a
breaststroke<00:00:52.860> kick<00:00:53.129> however<00:00:53.930> it<00:00:55.340> it<00:00:56.340> is<00:00:56.520> good

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
breaststroke kick however it it is good

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.959 
breaststroke kick however it it is good
if<00:00:57.859> you<00:00:58.859> know<00:00:59.190> how<00:00:59.340> to<00:00:59.399> do<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.699> breaststroke

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
if you know how to do the breaststroke

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.270 
if you know how to do the breaststroke
but<00:01:00.870> if<00:01:01.020> you're<00:01:01.170> just<00:01:01.410> picking<00:01:01.620> up<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:01.980> stroke

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
but if you're just picking up the stroke

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.320 
but if you're just picking up the stroke
for<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.550> first<00:01:02.760> time<00:01:03.059> not<00:01:03.989> a<00:01:04.439> swimmer<00:01:05.189> or<00:01:05.489> any

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
for the first time not a swimmer or any

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.910 
for the first time not a swimmer or any
history<00:01:06.780> of<00:01:06.990> swimming<00:01:07.640> I<00:01:08.640> wouldn't<00:01:09.420> try<00:01:10.409> doing

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
history of swimming I wouldn't try doing

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.600 
history of swimming I wouldn't try doing
the<00:01:11.040> breaststroke<00:01:11.340> main<00:01:11.909> reason<00:01:12.299> is<00:01:13.610> scissor

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
the breaststroke main reason is scissor

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.749 
the breaststroke main reason is scissor
kick<00:01:14.939> or<00:01:15.270> flutter<00:01:15.570> kick<00:01:15.900> is<00:01:15.930> going<00:01:16.560> to<00:01:16.799> be<00:01:17.189> your

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
kick or flutter kick is going to be your

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.640 
kick or flutter kick is going to be your
better<00:01:18.000> bet<00:01:18.360> because<00:01:18.689> you're<00:01:19.290> going<00:01:19.470> to<00:01:19.530> be

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
better bet because you're going to be

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.859 
better bet because you're going to be
able<00:01:19.770> to<00:01:19.890> easily<00:01:20.400> transition<00:01:21.409> doing<00:01:22.409> this

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:23.869 
able to easily transition doing this

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:25.820 
able to easily transition doing this
combat<00:01:24.869> swimmer<00:01:25.140> stroke<00:01:25.350> with<00:01:25.530> a<00:01:25.560> scissor

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
combat swimmer stroke with a scissor

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.460 
combat swimmer stroke with a scissor
kick<00:01:25.950> right<00:01:26.729> into<00:01:26.939> fins<00:01:27.330> now<00:01:27.930> when<00:01:28.140> he<00:01:28.290> wears

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
kick right into fins now when he wears

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.440 
kick right into fins now when he wears
fins<00:01:28.890> you<00:01:29.880> know<00:01:29.939> you<00:01:30.000> can't<00:01:30.270> do<00:01:30.420> a

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
fins you know you can't do a

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.210 
fins you know you can't do a
breaststroke<00:01:30.930> with<00:01:30.960> a<00:01:31.140> pair<00:01:31.380> of<00:01:31.439> fins<00:01:31.619> on<00:01:31.860> so

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
breaststroke with a pair of fins on so

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.359 
breaststroke with a pair of fins on so
he<00:01:32.549> has<00:01:32.729> to<00:01:32.909> change<00:01:33.150> his<00:01:33.329> whole<00:01:33.689> stroke<00:01:34.280> get<00:01:35.280> on

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
he has to change his whole stroke get on

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.420 
he has to change his whole stroke get on
his<00:01:35.579> side<00:01:35.880> and<00:01:36.299> do<00:01:37.020> flutter<00:01:37.650> kicks<00:01:38.009> or<00:01:38.220> scissor

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
his side and do flutter kicks or scissor

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.730 
his side and do flutter kicks or scissor
kicks<00:01:38.759> with<00:01:38.970> those<00:01:39.150> fins<00:01:39.470> so<00:01:40.470> it's<00:01:40.619> just

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
kicks with those fins so it's just

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.719 
kicks with those fins so it's just
another<00:01:41.310> way<00:01:41.880> to<00:01:42.180> swim<00:01:42.570> it<00:01:43.340> really<00:01:44.340> there's<00:01:44.520> no

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
another way to swim it really there's no

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.380 
another way to swim it really there's no
rules<00:01:45.720> on<00:01:46.490> exactly<00:01:47.490> how<00:01:47.729> you<00:01:47.790> do<00:01:48.000> as<00:01:48.119> long<00:01:48.329> as

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
rules on exactly how you do as long as

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.200 
rules on exactly how you do as long as
it<00:01:48.600> is<00:01:48.689> an<00:01:48.840> underwater<00:01:49.409> recovery<00:01:49.860> stroke<00:01:50.369> this

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
it is an underwater recovery stroke this

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.749 
it is an underwater recovery stroke this
is<00:01:51.420> still<00:01:51.689> considered<00:01:51.869> a<00:01:52.439> modified<00:01:53.040> side

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
is still considered a modified side

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.130 
is still considered a modified side
stroke<00:01:55.189> actually<00:01:56.189> modified<00:01:56.880> breaststroke<00:01:57.509> so

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
stroke actually modified breaststroke so

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.399 
stroke actually modified breaststroke so
to<00:01:58.200> speak<00:01:58.500> so<00:01:59.460> I<00:01:59.490> find<00:02:00.240> it<00:02:00.420> faster<00:02:00.930> than<00:02:01.079> the

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
to speak so I find it faster than the

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.980 
to speak so I find it faster than the
breaststroke<00:02:01.950> and<00:02:05.090> you<00:02:06.090> know<00:02:06.180> it's<00:02:06.390> it's<00:02:06.899> a

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
breaststroke and you know it's it's a

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.809 
breaststroke and you know it's it's a
little<00:02:07.259> more<00:02:07.409> energy<00:02:07.890> conserving<00:02:08.340> you<00:02:08.700> can

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
little more energy conserving you can

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.020 
little more energy conserving you can
get<00:02:08.940> a<00:02:08.970> lot<00:02:09.390> of<00:02:09.420> glide<00:02:10.200> out<00:02:10.229> of<00:02:10.530> this<00:02:10.770> one<00:02:11.030> so

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
get a lot of glide out of this one so

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.760 
get a lot of glide out of this one so
let's<00:02:12.360> count<00:02:12.540> a<00:02:12.690> strokes<00:02:13.050> here

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
let's count a strokes here

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.290 
let's count a strokes here
there's<00:02:13.890> one<00:02:14.160> coming<00:02:14.550> up<00:02:14.670> that<00:02:14.820> that<00:02:15.030> yellow

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
there's one coming up that that yellow

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.350 
there's one coming up that that yellow
lane<00:02:15.630> marker<00:02:16.190> there's<00:02:17.190> two<00:02:17.520> he's<00:02:18.030> usually

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
lane marker there's two he's usually

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:24.190 
lane marker there's two he's usually
about<00:02:18.510> five<00:02:18.810> or<00:02:19.020> six<00:02:19.230> on<00:02:19.500> this<00:02:19.650> one<00:02:19.860> three<00:02:22.640> four

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
about five or six on this one three four

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.330 
about five or six on this one three four
so<00:02:25.200> how<00:02:25.260> many<00:02:25.320> times<00:02:25.590> does<00:02:25.860> it<00:02:26.010> take<00:02:26.220> to

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
so how many times does it take to

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:31.550 
so how many times does it take to
breathe<00:02:26.610> there's<00:02:26.970> five<00:02:28.940> six<00:02:30.110> yeah

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
breathe there's five six yeah

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.300 
breathe there's five six yeah
six<00:02:32.010> times<00:02:32.280> hit<00:02:33.000> the<00:02:33.120> wall<00:02:33.330> it's<00:02:34.080> not<00:02:34.140> bad<00:02:34.440> not

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
six times hit the wall it's not bad not

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.890 
six times hit the wall it's not bad not
bad<00:02:35.340> he<00:02:35.580> could<00:02:35.730> be<00:02:35.820> a<00:02:35.850> little<00:02:36.090> more<00:02:36.450> efficient

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
bad he could be a little more efficient

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.880 
bad he could be a little more efficient
but<00:02:37.110> you<00:02:37.920> know<00:02:38.010> getting<00:02:38.340> under<00:02:38.580> six<00:02:38.870> is<00:02:39.890> very

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
but you know getting under six is very

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.190 
but you know getting under six is very
efficient<00:02:41.430> so<00:02:41.820> if<00:02:41.940> you<00:02:42.030> can<00:02:42.150> go<00:02:42.210> five<00:02:42.480> or<00:02:42.510> six<00:02:42.930> I

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
efficient so if you can go five or six I

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.520 
efficient so if you can go five or six I
would<00:02:43.260> try<00:02:44.100> to<00:02:44.130> wreck<00:02:44.370> that<00:02:44.850> your<00:02:45.120> goal<00:02:45.530> but

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
would try to wreck that your goal but

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.350 
would try to wreck that your goal but
right<00:02:47.430> now<00:02:47.610> this<00:02:47.970> guy<00:02:49.340> had<00:02:50.340> a<00:02:50.370> real<00:02:50.850> hard<00:02:51.210> time

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
right now this guy had a real hard time

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.000 
right now this guy had a real hard time
swimming<00:02:52.290> this<00:02:52.650> swim<00:02:53.870> at<00:02:54.870> an<00:02:55.320> eight<00:02:55.500> twenty

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
swimming this swim at an eight twenty

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.160 
swimming this swim at an eight twenty
pace<00:02:56.280> he<00:02:56.820> could<00:02:57.000> you<00:02:57.270> could<00:02:57.420> get<00:02:57.570> eight<00:02:57.720> twenty

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
pace he could you could get eight twenty

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:59.900 
pace he could you could get eight twenty
which<00:02:58.410> is<00:02:58.590> about<00:02:58.800> a<00:02:58.860> yard<00:02:59.100> per<00:02:59.400> second<00:02:59.790> which

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
which is about a yard per second which

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:01.970 
which is about a yard per second which
if<00:03:00.120> you<00:03:00.300> notice<00:03:00.510> that's<00:03:00.840> the<00:03:00.990> Pacey's<00:03:01.530> got<00:03:01.770> on

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
if you notice that's the Pacey's got on

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.720 
if you notice that's the Pacey's got on
right<00:03:02.250> now<00:03:02.480> yard<00:03:03.480> per<00:03:03.720> second<00:03:04.140> but<00:03:04.640> when<00:03:05.640> he

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
right now yard per second but when he

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.400 
right now yard per second but when he
came<00:03:05.910> in<00:03:06.120> about<00:03:06.420> a<00:03:06.450> month<00:03:06.720> ago<00:03:06.840> he<00:03:07.230> was

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
came in about a month ago he was

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:10.730 
came in about a month ago he was
exhausted<00:03:08.270> now<00:03:09.270> he's<00:03:10.140> swimming<00:03:10.350> the<00:03:10.560> same

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:10.740 
exhausted now he's swimming the same

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:14.150 
exhausted now he's swimming the same
pace<00:03:11.070> with<00:03:12.030> a<00:03:12.060> lot<00:03:12.420> less<00:03:12.450> effort<00:03:13.200> so<00:03:13.890> that's

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
pace with a lot less effort so that's

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:20.020 
pace with a lot less effort so that's
the<00:03:14.370> key<00:03:14.640> to<00:03:15.000> this<00:03:15.150> 500<00:03:15.750> yard<00:03:15.960> swim<00:03:16.170> is<00:03:17.990> to

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
the key to this 500 yard swim is to

the key to this 500 yard swim is to
conserve<00:03:21.030> your<00:03:21.060> energy<00:03:21.660> so<00:03:22.350> we're<00:03:22.709> looking<00:03:23.160> at

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
take about two minute break

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.740 
take about two minute break
get<00:03:54.060> some<00:03:54.240> water<00:03:54.420> stretch<00:03:55.050> out<00:03:55.320> do<00:03:56.130> it<00:03:56.160> again

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
get some water stretch out do it again

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.270 
get some water stretch out do it again
that's<00:03:57.750> not<00:03:58.050> that<00:03:58.230> hard<00:03:58.440> work<00:03:58.650> out<00:03:58.860> actually<00:03:59.250> I

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
that's not that hard work out actually I

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.949 
that's not that hard work out actually I
wouldn't<00:03:59.940> say<00:04:00.030> that<00:04:00.150> it's<00:04:00.330> a<00:04:00.390> hard<00:04:00.540> workout

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
wouldn't say that it's a hard workout

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:04.430 
wouldn't say that it's a hard workout
but<00:04:01.230> it's<00:04:01.410> about<00:04:01.770> 45<00:04:02.220> minutes<00:04:02.459> long<00:04:02.730> and<00:04:03.440> you

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
but it's about 45 minutes long and you

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.500 
but it's about 45 minutes long and you
definitely<00:04:05.220> are<00:04:05.580> building<00:04:06.060> up<00:04:06.209> your

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
definitely are building up your

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.650 
definitely are building up your
endurance<00:04:07.190> to<00:04:08.190> handle<00:04:08.670> the<00:04:08.790> 500<00:04:09.420> a<00:04:09.450> little

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
endurance to handle the 500 a little

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.479 
endurance to handle the 500 a little
better<00:04:09.810> no<00:04:10.230> more<00:04:10.410> of<00:04:10.470> these<00:04:10.560> 50<00:04:10.890> meter<00:04:11.100> sets

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
better no more of these 50 meter sets

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:13.850 
better no more of these 50 meter sets
and<00:04:11.820> hundred<00:04:12.090> meter<00:04:12.239> sets<00:04:12.600> pick<00:04:13.500> it<00:04:13.590> up<00:04:13.739> the

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:13.860 
and hundred meter sets pick it up the

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:16.820 
and hundred meter sets pick it up the
250<00:04:14.340> if<00:04:14.489> you're<00:04:14.640> starting
