00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.429
 Bechamel 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:11.820
 for that we will need 20 g of 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:14.820
 25 centiliter butter from the aid of 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.760
 two tablespoons of salt flour 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.470

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:22.789
 so on fire at first 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.789
 I will melt the butter 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:39.870

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:11.610
 butter here is the butter answered I them 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:20.970

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:25.409
 flour and that's what's called 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:27.840

 lumps see the cup come all 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:36.030
 amalgamate was that these little lumps 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:41.280
 feels strong but must be poured very 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:44.700
 quickly milk on it from here 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:47.420
 from this moment it is necessary to whip until 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:51.690
 that the mixture thickens 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:54.840
 so here I could very well 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:57.450
 at the beginning of the preparation the red is 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.150
 always present at the bottom of my 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:03.510
 pan it does not matter it takes 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:06.440
 continue to whip and once he 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:10.940
 will be well incorporate the béchamel 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:15.390
 will begin to solidify the household 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:22.050
 begins to solidify well it is 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:24.420
 well shine béchamel is formed and he 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:34.110

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:38.280
 let her cook sail you can see 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:40.980

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.600
 continue to cook until you reach the 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.720
 desired consistency 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:53.400
 you can make it very liquid or 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:59.330
 more compact is the béchamel property 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:03:04.190
