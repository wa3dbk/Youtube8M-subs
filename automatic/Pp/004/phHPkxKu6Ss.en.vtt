00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.500
Hey Guys, we are here at the Museum Mello Leitao in Santa Teresa, Espirito Santo.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.500
We came here with the intention to photograph this. The dream of every birdwatcher.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.000
Here we have one of the highest concentrations of hummingbirds in Espirito Santo and in all of Brazil.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.500
The ecologist Augusto Ruschi implemented his researches right here.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:41.000
There are lots of different species. Since we arrived I counted 10 different species already.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Hummingbirds are restless animals. Their heart beats about 1,250 times per minute.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
They are frantic.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.000
They can only store just enough energy to suvive some hours.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:04.500
This is why they drink nektar non-stop. They only make it through the night because they lower their metabolism.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.000
We came here to photograph the little bird which is the symbol of the museum.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.000
It is a hummingbird called Frilled Coquette.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:20.000
It is a tiny hummingbird. About this size. But he surpasses all the others.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Despite its size he is able to survive and find his niche.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
His characteristic feature is his litte red topknot.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
He is green with this golden-red topknot.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
I was finally able to take the picture I wanted to. I was trying to photograph this bird for about a year already.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.500
Today I finally did it.
