00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.579 

I'm<00:00:00.179> going<00:00:00.390> to<00:00:00.480> show<00:00:00.630> you<00:00:00.690> how<00:00:00.900> to<00:00:00.930> cast<00:00:01.290> on

00:00:01.579 --> 00:00:01.589 
I'm going to show you how to cast on

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:04.220 
I'm going to show you how to cast on
using<00:00:01.920> the<00:00:02.010> thumb<00:00:02.250> method<00:00:02.790> I'm<00:00:03.419> using<00:00:03.629> very

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.230 
using the thumb method I'm using very

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.289 
using the thumb method I'm using very
big<00:00:04.500> warm<00:00:04.770> very<00:00:05.040> big<00:00:05.279> pins<00:00:05.580> just<00:00:05.790> so<00:00:06.089> that<00:00:06.210> you

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
big warm very big pins just so that you

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.459 
big warm very big pins just so that you
can<00:00:06.450> see<00:00:06.629> what<00:00:06.779> I'm<00:00:06.960> doing<00:00:08.210> you<00:00:09.210> need<00:00:09.389> to<00:00:09.719> start

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
can see what I'm doing you need to start

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.009 
can see what I'm doing you need to start
with<00:00:10.710> a<00:00:10.769> length<00:00:11.010> of<00:00:11.219> wool<00:00:11.460> as<00:00:12.090> long<00:00:12.690> as<00:00:12.870> you

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
with a length of wool as long as you

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:14.690 
with a length of wool as long as you
think<00:00:13.049> you<00:00:13.769> need<00:00:13.799> for<00:00:14.219> the<00:00:14.309> amount<00:00:14.580> of

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
think you need for the amount of

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.310 
think you need for the amount of
stitches<00:00:15.299> so<00:00:16.880> it's<00:00:17.880> a<00:00:17.970> bit<00:00:18.090> of<00:00:18.180> guesswork<00:00:18.420> but

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
stitches so it's a bit of guesswork but

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.830 
stitches so it's a bit of guesswork but
I'm<00:00:20.130> only<00:00:20.310> going<00:00:20.580> to<00:00:20.699> cast<00:00:20.910> on<00:00:21.150> ten<00:00:21.480> stitches

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
I'm only going to cast on ten stitches

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:28.099 
I'm only going to cast on ten stitches
so<00:00:22.380> I'll<00:00:22.769> use<00:00:23.640> that<00:00:23.939> amount<00:00:24.210> of<00:00:24.449> wool<00:00:27.109> you

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
so I'll use that amount of wool you

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:33.680 
so I'll use that amount of wool you
start<00:00:28.410> by<00:00:28.560> making<00:00:28.590> a<00:00:29.070> loop<00:00:30.019> like<00:00:31.019> so<00:00:32.690> and

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
start by making a loop like so and

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.229 
start by making a loop like so and
that's<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.739> bit<00:00:34.950> of<00:00:35.219> wool<00:00:35.579> but<00:00:35.610> you're<00:00:36.000> going

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
that's the bit of wool but you're going

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.910 
that's the bit of wool but you're going
to<00:00:36.510> make<00:00:37.260> into<00:00:37.500> your<00:00:37.680> cast<00:00:38.040> on<00:00:38.250> stitches<00:00:39.920> if

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
to make into your cast on stitches if

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.860 
to make into your cast on stitches if
you're<00:00:41.070> right-handed<00:00:41.280> you<00:00:41.879> take<00:00:42.120> one<00:00:42.450> needle

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
you're right-handed you take one needle

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.770 
you're right-handed you take one needle

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:02.840 
thumb put the needle through the loop

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.509 
thumb put the needle through the loop
we'll<00:01:03.840> round<00:01:04.199> the<00:01:04.379> needle<00:01:04.769> and<00:01:04.920> pull<00:01:04.979> it

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
we'll round the needle and pull it

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.230 
we'll round the needle and pull it
through<00:01:06.049> round<00:01:07.049> your<00:01:07.350> thumb<00:01:08.030> through<00:01:09.030> the

the needle and pull it through I'm going

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:38.200 
the needle and pull it through I'm going
to<00:01:19.409> do<00:01:19.530> ten<00:01:19.890> of<00:01:19.920> these

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.110 

so<00:01:39.210> we<00:01:39.420> have<00:01:39.630> enough<00:01:40.470> wool<00:01:40.800> left<00:01:41.610> at<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:41.970> end

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:42.120 
so we have enough wool left at the end

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:47.600 
so we have enough wool left at the end
to<00:01:42.600> sew<00:01:43.500> in<00:01:43.740> at<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.370> end<00:01:46.220> now<00:01:47.220> I'm<00:01:47.340> going<00:01:47.550> to

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
to sew in at the end now I'm going to

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.550 
to sew in at the end now I'm going to
show<00:01:47.760> you<00:01:47.790> how<00:01:48.060> to<00:01:48.120> do<00:01:48.360> plane<00:01:48.720> or<00:01:49.110> garter

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
show you how to do plane or garter

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.770 
show you how to do plane or garter
stitch<00:01:49.860> when<00:01:50.220> a<00:01:50.250> patent<00:01:50.670> asks<00:01:51.030> for<00:01:51.180> a<00:01:51.390> row<00:01:51.630> of

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
stitch when a patent asks for a row of

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.200 
stitch when a patent asks for a row of
plane<00:01:52.170> this<00:01:52.620> is<00:01:52.770> what<00:01:52.920> they<00:01:53.100> mean<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:54.060> other

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
plane this is what they mean the other

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.350 
plane this is what they mean the other
name<00:01:54.600> for<00:01:54.630> it<00:01:54.930> is<00:01:55.050> garter<00:01:55.530> stitch<00:01:55.770> so<00:01:56.520> you<00:01:56.580> hold

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
name for it is garter stitch so you hold

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.180 
name for it is garter stitch so you hold
your<00:01:57.930> needle<00:01:58.830> in<00:01:59.190> the<00:01:59.820> right<00:01:59.850> hand<00:02:01.190> you're

using your main border wall and you're
about<00:02:05.220> now<00:02:05.550> to<00:02:05.610> do<00:02:06.600> a<00:02:06.870> row<00:02:07.080> of<00:02:07.380> plane

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
about now to do a row of plane

and<00:02:32.130> off<00:02:35.090> if<00:02:36.090> it's<00:02:36.300> actually<00:02:36.630> quite<00:02:36.840> hard

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
and off if it's actually quite hard

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.160

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
using big full and big pins it's much

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:45.010 
using big full and big pins it's much
easier<00:02:40.680> if<00:02:41.090> you're<00:02:42.090> going<00:02:42.330> a<00:02:42.480> bit<00:02:42.630> smaller<00:02:43.910> and

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.020 
easier if you're going a bit smaller and

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:50.000 
easier if you're going a bit smaller and
most<00:02:46.020> patterns<00:02:46.320> do<00:02:46.860> require<00:02:47.550> a<00:02:48.560> much<00:02:49.560> smaller

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
most patterns do require a much smaller

00:02:50.010 --> 00:03:01.410 
most patterns do require a much smaller
pin<00:02:50.640> and<00:02:51.080> thinner

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420
