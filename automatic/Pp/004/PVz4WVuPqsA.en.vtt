 triggers a quick command programming 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.269
 the macro

 ultimate stel proves quieter 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:45.010
 than the employee in the normal version of the 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:46.720
 The keyboard remains the product 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.940
 noisy than a keyboard with 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.760
 electronic film 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:54.160
 however the sound level produced does not 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.350
 comes to annoy what allows you to use the 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.480
 accessory in public environments without 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:01.030
 draw a lot of attention 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.790

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:09.790
 combined with the low resistance of 

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:12.670
 Stimulus keys tighten them until the end 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:15.130
 hence the stel end version does not present 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:18.280
 a tactile response as good as that of 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:20.500

 this problem does not arise during 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.380

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:39.160
 quickly and evenly 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:42.780
 simultaneous combination of several buttons is 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.780
 registered in a competent manner 

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:53.439
 costing between 500 and 600 reais 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:55.540
 the razr black widow ultimate stel is a 

00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:57.819
 keyboard for few 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:00.489
 although it is comfortable to deal with 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:03.010
 mechanical keyboard its use does not seem 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:05.920
 provide an obvious advantage in 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:09.280
 games compared to a 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:11.170
 good product with electronic film or 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.390
 accessory is a good alternative to 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:15.010
 who works typing texts and does not 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:16.299
 want to deal with a very 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:19.150
 noisy 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:21.609
 however if ambient noise does not 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:24.220
 be a problem for you to invest in 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:26.289
 conventional version of the product is shown 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:28.479
 a better idea for those who want a 

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:31.750
 superior tactile experience 

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:34.389

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:36.970
 shows a good mechanical keyboard option 

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:37.900
 but not necessarily the best 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:40.780
 Marketplace 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:43.000

 it's worth searching for other models 

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:51.220
