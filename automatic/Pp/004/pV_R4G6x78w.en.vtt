00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
logo that's taped on and stuff because I

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.540 
logo that's taped on and stuff because I
don't<00:00:16.350> even<00:00:16.529> have<00:00:16.710> a<00:00:16.770> color<00:00:17.010> printer<00:00:17.369> so<00:00:17.520> I

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
don't even have a color printer so I

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:18.769 
don't even have a color printer so I
just<00:00:17.760> had<00:00:17.880> to<00:00:18.000> print<00:00:18.150> it<00:00:18.240> out<00:00:18.300> in<00:00:18.420> black<00:00:18.449> and

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
just had to print it out in black and

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.689 
just had to print it out in black and
white<00:00:18.930> and<00:00:19.109> then<00:00:19.230> I<00:00:19.439> popped<00:00:20.100> some<00:00:20.310> markers

because<00:00:21.090> they<00:00:21.300> didn't<00:00:21.449> have<00:00:21.539> markers<00:00:21.930> either

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
because they didn't have markers either

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.650

quake<00:02:19.680> and<00:02:20.150> sky<00:02:21.500> I<00:02:22.500> think<00:02:23.400> so<00:02:23.630> but<00:02:24.630> you<00:02:24.840> can

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
quake and sky I think so but you can

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.240 
quake and sky I think so but you can
check<00:02:25.140> the<00:02:25.260> schedule<00:02:25.350> obviously<00:02:26.040> if<00:02:26.130> you're

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
check the schedule obviously if you're

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.610 
check the schedule obviously if you're
going<00:02:26.280> to<00:02:26.490> mind<00:02:26.640> con<00:02:27.230> you'll<00:02:28.230> get<00:02:28.410> it<00:02:28.530> it

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
going to mind con you'll get it it

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.740 
going to mind con you'll get it it
probably<00:02:29.100> when<00:02:29.220> you<00:02:29.340> when<00:02:29.730> you<00:02:29.880> enter<00:02:30.180> in<00:02:30.540> like

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
probably when you when you enter in like

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.930 
probably when you when you enter in like
a<00:02:30.780> pamphlet<00:02:31.020> anyway<00:02:31.590> I'll<00:02:32.550> be<00:02:32.610> doing<00:02:32.850> those

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
of them I will I'm not sure if they'll
