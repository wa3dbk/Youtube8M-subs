00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:08.200
 It is shorter than I expected a pinned served 

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.200
 220 

00:00:10.179 --> 00:00:15.589
 left our hook i bought soup on time 

00:00:13.909 --> 00:00:17.180
 like compost to do then I realized that this 

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:18.290
 impractical thing nubuck are you the one at all 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.500
 designed for water 

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:23.000
 so I decided to wash it but like this 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.680
 how were the effective ones there 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.740
 microorganisms can because I be them and 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:29.810
 washed well but still what if they 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:31.310
 will get me and recycle me there 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:32.050
 from the inside of course they are unlikely to pass 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:33.860
 through this 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:35.780
 gastric juice which should 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.500
 peretravit but nevertheless I decided everything 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:41.780
 did this tank you we carefully 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:44.540
 Lyosha doesn’t use chemistry 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.880
 I have a special sort of thing it 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.829
 I bought for other accounting purposes I number 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.030
 used for other purposes is 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:52.579
 household water activator 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.160
 shorter than it does whatever it is called 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:56.210
 buzzword electro 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.969
 electrolytic dissociation of water 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.920
 sounds even worse than whales new 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:04.009
 dissociation but ketamine avaya dissociation 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:06.770
 Much more fun I want to say how 

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:09.140
 see what happens yes two such 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:12.740
 electrodes if done with normal 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:17.450
 water there with clean cleaned up so you don’t 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:18.920
 That's what I see then scored from that of 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:23.060
 under the crane shorter 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:25.909
 Type here outside turns out living water 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:30.740
 it's this type should be drunk but but 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:38.330
 this is dead water 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:40.610
 very much when the page is shorter probably somewhere 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:43.549
 here 4 will be maybe even three shorter 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:45.700
 acid is just acid has a very 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:49.580
 hard bactericidal properties 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:54.439
 shorter kill all bacteria look 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:56.079
 this is absolutely no chemistry 

00:01:54.439 --> 00:02:00.549
 pure water 

00:01:56.079 --> 00:02:08.690
 produce any other water Odessa on 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:10.610
 sleepy but what smells like bleach here what 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.069
 focus forte 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.140
 no absolutely no well maybe 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:18.980
 it somehow emerges from the water 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:21.980
 Well, she really is in this water 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:24.430
 and the same properties that you can 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.430
 compare 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.730
 flush diesen disinfect and the 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:37.010
 like that, but in terms of drinking, I don't know 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.930
 why I didn't learn it properly 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.080
 bit activator make such water 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:44.920
 so it was delicious forever 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:50.750
 bear peeled buy in store 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:52.760
 example there is no swat no well somehow 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.010
 gives a strong alkali and the description is written 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:59.060
 that water should not 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:03:02.780
 I don’t know something like that 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:04.640
 buy these strips that ph measure these 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:07.069
 litmus 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:09.200
 also recommend to you here 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:11.780
 household activator in order to do 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:14.450
 it is precisely living dead water that I personally do not 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:17.720
 I will but I will not say that he is bad 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:21.280
 just did not recommend well 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.280
 maybe there are some better options 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:28.190
 Here I am shorter just reported 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:30.709
 smart people that it is shorter it does not smell 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:33.140
 just smell the acid water becomes 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:36.739
 very sour I really perederzhal I like 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:38.560
 for about 30 minutes 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:42.920
 household activator 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:47.140
 kept that is here plush to maximum in 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:49.370
 this and here is the acid to the maximum 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:51.769
 electrolytic dissociation of water 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:54.700
 I like such beautiful words straight 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:54.700
 what sikkime kilts 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:03.870
 all let's live as an agent
