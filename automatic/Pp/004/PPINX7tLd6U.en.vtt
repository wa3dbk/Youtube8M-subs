00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:06.220
 Hey, everyone, I am Gerald. 

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:07.509
 Next to our technician Barrett 

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:10.870
 We will explain some basic bicycle fits (FIT) today. 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:14.789
 Let you ride on the road efficiently and comfortably 

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:18.730
 Use two simple tools today 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:19.990
 You can buy it at your local hardware store. 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.980
 The first one is the protractor 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.410
 We use it to determine 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.810
 The angle of the leg, and the second is 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:35.770
 You can buy one of these with a cotton plumb. 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:36.510
 or 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.790
 I use a cotton thread to tie a ball pen or a heavy object, so that it hangs 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:40.850
 Can also measure vertical lines 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.580
 Let's get started, Gerald is here. 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:48.540
 Put the bicycle on the exercise bench and step on the pedal 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:49.160
 Continue to step on a few more 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.039
 Just like riding a few times on the road 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:58.100
 This is to do two things 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.880
 Let Jerod’s ischon 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:04.150
 He usually rides the most comfortable position and 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:08.539
 Assist the fit person to observe the position of his foot when the pedal reaches the bottom 

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:15.149
 At the same time, see where he naturally stepped on. After a few laps 

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:18.739
 Let him stop and stop at the lowest point of the pedal 

00:01:18.739 --> 00:01:19.640
 Let him stop and stop at the lowest point of the pedal 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.179
 thank you. At this time, we observe his feet 

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:27.819
 We have to put our feet on the lowest point of the pedal 

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:32.188
 Usually the crank arm and the seat tube are on the same line 

00:01:32.188 --> 00:01:36.090
 We observed that Gerald will lift the heel up a little when the pedal stroke reaches the low point. 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.938
 We want him to keep that position 

00:01:38.938 --> 00:01:42.979
 Please keep this position 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:46.218
 Open the protractor, I have to change to the left 

00:01:46.218 --> 00:01:50.649
 Now, in order to determine 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:54.679
 Jerrod’s knee angle when bending, we’re looking for three anchor points here. 

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:58.479
 Hip bone (tibia) apex 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:02.700
 The bottom end of the thigh bone has a small bump near the knee 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:03.188
 The bottom end of the thigh bone has a small bump near the knee 

00:02:03.188 --> 00:02:07.810
 There are ankles, use our protractor 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.970
 With this tool, we start here from the cheekbones 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.060
 Down the thigh bone 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.430
 Put the middle of the protractor here, and finally 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:21.080
 Follow this line to the ankle below 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.710
 The amount we bend to the leg is 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:32.319
 About 40 degrees, here, the best angle is 30 degrees 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:38.030
 This is a very simple math problem 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.849
 Used to determine the height or lowering of the seat cushion 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:42.919
 Take Jerod as an example, how to decide to increase or decrease 

00:02:42.919 --> 00:02:47.509
 Based on 30 degrees, 1 degree = 1mm 

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:52.539
 So in the case of Jerod, let his knee angle change from 40 degrees to 30 degrees. 

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:56.630
 Each degree represents 1mm 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:59.639
 We have to raise his seat cushion 1cm 

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:04.150
 We have helped Jerod set the right 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.780
 Cushion height 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.310
 We are going to start the second adjustment. 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:09.039
 Front and rear position of the cushion 

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:12.870
 Use this plumb bob. Please Jerod will step on the pedal a few times 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.430
 Just like a natural step on the road 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.780
 In order to make his ischial position feel comfortable again. 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.710
 This time we want Jerrod to park the pedal in front. 

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:28.819
 With the pedal forward, you can choose the left or right foot 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:29.259
 Can 

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:32.229
 I want to move down 

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:32.900
 So that you can see clearly 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.729
 We adjust the crank arm to the level 

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:40.620
 Parallel to the ground 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:45.259
 Very good, once again let Gerald put his feet in a natural position 

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:46.470
 His favorite location 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.780
 Now you have to stay still, you can pull the rear brakes, let’s say a word. 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:51.410
 Hold live 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:55.090
 perfect. Take out the plumb bob now 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:58.340
 We have to go from the front of the knee 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.310
 We have to put the position of the plumb 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.550
 In front of the knee, like this 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:08.970
 The knee is slightly indented to the middle of the leg at this time. 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:09.710
 Although this is not a natural riding position 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:13.319
 But can help us find the right knee vertical line 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:19.129
 Pretty 

00:04:19.129 --> 00:04:22.598
 It seems that Gerald’s knee is in an optimal front and rear position. 

00:04:22.598 --> 00:04:26.120
 Usually the plumb line is just attached to the end of the crank arm. 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:29.668
 like this. Here is an example 

00:04:29.668 --> 00:04:33.430
 The position of the cushion is too far back, so we have to move the plumb line forward 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:35.158
 That is, moving the cushion forward 

00:04:35.158 --> 00:04:40.069
 About 1cm 

00:04:40.069 --> 00:04:41.310
 These are the right focus from our bikes. 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:45.029
 These are the right focus from our bikes. 

00:04:45.029 --> 00:04:45.959
 Happy cycling 

00:04:45.959 --> 00:04:48.000
 Happy cycling
