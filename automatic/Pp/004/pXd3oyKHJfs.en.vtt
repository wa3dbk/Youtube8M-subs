this<00:00:36.110> beach<00:00:36.410> so<00:00:36.730> for<00:00:37.730> the<00:00:37.790> bait<00:00:37.970> trap<00:00:38.300> to<00:00:38.720> start

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:39.050 
this beach so for the bait trap to start

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:40.750 
this beach so for the bait trap to start
what<00:00:39.830> you<00:00:39.949> want<00:00:40.129> to<00:00:40.190> do<00:00:40.340> is<00:00:40.489> make<00:00:40.730> two

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:40.760 
what you want to do is make two

what you want to do is make two
incisions<00:00:42.640> into<00:00:43.640> the<00:00:43.730> bottle<00:00:45.160> crisscross

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:47.470 
incisions into the bottle crisscross

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:50.260 
incisions into the bottle crisscross
then<00:00:48.470> what<00:00:48.650> you<00:00:48.739> do<00:00:48.980> is<00:00:49.190> you<00:00:49.399> fold<00:00:49.610> these<00:00:49.880> tabs

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:50.270 
then what you do is you fold these tabs

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:56.440 
then what you do is you fold these tabs
down<00:00:54.040> like<00:00:55.040> so<00:00:55.340> down<00:00:55.550> to<00:00:55.730> be<00:00:55.820> full<00:00:56.059> fold<00:00:56.300> it

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:56.450

down like so down to be full fold it
down<00:00:56.600> just<00:00:56.870> enough<00:00:57.200> so<00:00:57.410> that<00:00:57.440> your<00:00:57.680> bait<00:00:57.860> that

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:58.040 
down just enough so that your bait that

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.170 
down just enough so that your bait that
you're<00:00:58.160> put<00:00:58.309> in<00:00:58.399> the<00:00:58.489> trap<00:00:58.700> isn't<00:00:58.910> going<00:00:59.120> to

00:00:59.170 --> 00:00:59.180 
you're put in the trap isn't going to

fall<00:00:59.360> out<00:00:59.800> and<00:01:00.800> what<00:01:00.980> you<00:01:01.070> do<00:01:01.219> is<00:01:01.340> simply<00:01:01.550> load

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:02.059 
fall out and what you do is simply load

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:04.299 
fall out and what you do is simply load
sand<00:01:02.660> into<00:01:03.020> it<00:01:03.170> so<00:01:03.590> that<00:01:03.770> you<00:01:03.829> can<00:01:03.980> weight<00:01:04.160> the

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.309 
sand into it so that you can weight the

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:13.580 
sand into it so that you can weight the
bottle<00:01:04.610> down<00:01:04.820> without<00:01:05.089> a<00:01:05.149> floating<00:01:05.660> off

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.819 

let's<00:01:13.890> get<00:01:14.040> a<00:01:14.100> sander<00:01:14.490> there<00:01:14.700> we<00:01:15.030> go<00:01:15.149> he<00:01:15.210> lives

00:01:15.819 --> 00:01:15.829 
let's get a sander there we go he lives

00:01:15.829 --> 00:01:28.270 
let's get a sander there we go he lives
over<00:01:16.829> in<00:01:16.979> for<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.310> fish

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.800 

all<00:01:29.280> right<00:01:29.490> and<00:01:29.850> then<00:01:30.060> what<00:01:30.179> you<00:01:30.299> do<00:01:30.479> is<00:01:30.509> with

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
all right and then what you do is with

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.709 
all right and then what you do is with
bread<00:01:31.460> just<00:01:32.460> break<00:01:32.729> off<00:01:32.939> little<00:01:33.119> pieces<00:01:33.509> and

00:01:33.709 --> 00:01:33.719 
bread just break off little pieces and

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:35.870 
bread just break off little pieces and
just<00:01:34.140> put<00:01:34.320> him<00:01:34.409> in<00:01:34.530> the<00:01:34.590> bottle<00:01:34.920> and<00:01:35.070> those

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
just put him in the bottle and those

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.550 
just put him in the bottle and those
tabs<00:01:36.270> that<00:01:36.390> I<00:01:36.509> just<00:01:36.719> cut<00:01:36.960> and<00:01:37.110> fold<00:01:37.350> it<00:01:37.530> down

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
tabs that I just cut and fold it down

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.620 
tabs that I just cut and fold it down
will<00:01:38.159> hold<00:01:38.399> the<00:01:38.549> bait<00:01:38.700> in<00:01:38.909> position<00:01:39.360> so<00:01:39.570> it

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
will hold the bait in position so it

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.169 
will hold the bait in position so it
doesn't<00:01:39.869> float<00:01:40.110> off<00:01:40.369> is<00:01:41.369> when<00:01:41.579> it<00:01:41.700> floats<00:01:41.909> off

00:01:42.169 --> 00:01:42.179 
doesn't float off is when it floats off

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:44.059 
doesn't float off is when it floats off
the<00:01:42.420> fish<00:01:42.600> just<00:01:42.810> have<00:01:42.990> a<00:01:43.020> frenzy<00:01:43.500> outside<00:01:43.890> the

00:01:44.059 --> 00:01:44.069 
the fish just have a frenzy outside the

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:45.559 
the fish just have a frenzy outside the
container<00:01:44.460> and<00:01:44.670> that's<00:01:44.789> not<00:01:45.060> what<00:01:45.210> you<00:01:45.329> want

00:01:45.559 --> 00:01:45.569

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
we want them in so we can get some fresh

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.870 
we want them in so we can get some fresh
bait<00:01:47.729> for<00:01:47.939> these<00:01:48.060> my<00:01:48.240> eyes<00:01:49.250> just<00:01:50.250> pack<00:01:50.610> it<00:01:50.640> in

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
bait for these my eyes just pack it in

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:58.389 
bait for these my eyes just pack it in
get<00:01:51.179> around<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.479> sides<00:01:51.750> around<00:01:52.289> the<00:01:52.500> front

00:01:58.389 --> 00:01:58.399 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:00.740 

we've<00:01:59.399> got<00:01:59.429> the<00:01:59.579> incoming<00:02:00.000> tide<00:02:00.329> the<00:02:00.509> tides

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
we've got the incoming tide the tides

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.120 
we've got the incoming tide the tides
probably<00:02:01.110> going<00:02:01.229> to<00:02:01.289> run<00:02:01.409> low<00:02:01.649> that's

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
probably going to run low that's

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.729 
probably going to run low that's
starting<00:02:02.579> to<00:02:02.700> run<00:02:02.849> out<00:02:03.000> now<00:02:03.179> so<00:02:03.509> it's<00:02:04.439> going<00:02:04.679> to

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:04.739 
starting to run out now so it's going to

00:02:04.739 --> 00:02:20.230 
starting to run out now so it's going to
run<00:02:04.860> low<00:02:05.069> soon<00:02:05.399> so<00:02:05.640> it's<00:02:05.759> for<00:02:05.939> the<00:02:06.119> prefer<00:02:06.599> deck

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:20.240 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.380 

and<00:02:20.690> that<00:02:20.840> is<00:02:20.960> his<00:02:21.140> bait<00:02:21.440> set<00:02:21.710> track<00:02:22.120> so<00:02:23.120> now<00:02:23.330> we

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
and that is his bait set track so now we

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.240 
and that is his bait set track so now we
just<00:02:23.510> come<00:02:23.840> back<00:02:24.020> in<00:02:24.230> a<00:02:24.290> couple<00:02:24.320> of<00:02:24.650> hours<00:02:25.040> and

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
just come back in a couple of hours and

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.970 
just come back in a couple of hours and
see<00:02:25.460> see<00:02:26.450> how<00:02:26.540> much<00:02:26.690> more<00:02:26.930> progress<00:02:27.350> see<00:02:27.800> if<00:02:27.860> we

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
see see how much more progress see if we

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.400 
see see how much more progress see if we
put<00:02:28.130> the<00:02:28.280> bait<00:02:28.490> in<00:02:28.520> there<00:02:28.850> work<00:02:29.840> together<00:02:30.020> up

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
put the bait in there work together up

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:58.170 
put the bait in there work together up
for<00:02:30.680> a<00:02:30.710> fog<00:02:31.010> which<00:02:31.220> should<00:02:31.400> do<00:02:31.580> it<00:02:31.700> it's<00:02:31.910> not

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.729 

we've<00:02:59.180> given<00:02:59.330> another<00:02:59.810> five<00:03:00.080> minutes<00:03:00.319> so<00:03:00.680> it
