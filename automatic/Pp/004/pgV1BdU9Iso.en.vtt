00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.420 

and<00:01:42.570> this<00:01:42.720> is<00:01:42.870> this<00:01:43.290> is<00:01:43.470> normally<00:01:43.800> no<00:01:43.950> problem

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
and this is this is normally no problem

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.020 
and this is this is normally no problem
I<00:01:44.610> may<00:01:45.510> not<00:01:45.660> have<00:01:45.810> gotten<00:01:45.960> that<00:01:46.730> piece<00:01:47.730> of<00:01:47.880> rope

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
I may not have gotten that piece of rope

00:01:48.030 --> 00:02:03.560 
I may not have gotten that piece of rope
would<00:01:52.430> a<00:01:54.080> little<00:01:55.080> more<00:01:55.229> fuel<00:02:02.270> I'll<00:02:03.270> play<00:02:03.450> again

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
would a little more fuel I'll play again

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.570 
would a little more fuel I'll play again
at<00:02:03.780> that<00:02:03.930> time<00:02:06.050> it's<00:02:07.050> not<00:02:07.320> this<00:02:07.650> this<00:02:07.920> uh<00:02:07.950> this

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
at that time it's not this this uh this

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.010 
at that time it's not this this uh this
step<00:02:08.759> is<00:02:08.880> not<00:02:09.030> hard<00:02:09.240> to<00:02:09.270> light<00:02:09.509> you<00:02:09.690> just<00:02:09.869> have

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
step is not hard to light you just have

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.220 
step is not hard to light you just have
to<00:02:10.200> make<00:02:10.530> sure<00:02:10.590> you<00:02:10.800> get<00:02:10.920> that<00:02:11.070> little<00:02:11.250> wick

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
to make sure you get that little wick

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:59.240 
to make sure you get that little wick
what<00:02:15.920> okay<00:02:16.920> and<00:02:17.040> that<00:02:17.160> time<00:02:17.340> I<00:02:17.370> go

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:07.100 

it's<00:03:00.250> really<00:03:00.430> pretty<00:03:00.700> windy<00:03:01.090> right<00:03:01.269> now

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:16.130 

Oh

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:17.960 

and<00:03:16.650> of<00:03:16.770> course<00:03:16.980> this<00:03:17.490> works<00:03:17.670> much<00:03:17.910> better

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
and of course this works much better

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.990 
and of course this works much better
when<00:03:18.510> you<00:03:18.660> put<00:03:18.810> the<00:03:18.930> wind<00:03:19.110> guard<00:03:19.320> on<00:03:19.500> it<00:03:19.970> but<00:03:20.970> I

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
when you put the wind guard on it but I

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.220 
when you put the wind guard on it but I
left<00:03:21.210> it<00:03:21.360> off<00:03:21.480> because<00:03:21.600> I<00:03:21.750> wanted<00:03:21.930> you<00:03:22.050> guys<00:03:22.110> to

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
left it off because I wanted you guys to

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:41.380 
left it off because I wanted you guys to
see<00:03:22.440> this

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.390 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:43.180 

let's<00:03:41.870> see<00:03:42.020> right<00:03:42.170> now<00:03:42.440> when<00:03:42.650> I<00:03:42.680> turn<00:03:42.950> it<00:03:42.980> up

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:43.190 
let's see right now when I turn it up

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:46.360 
let's see right now when I turn it up
you<00:03:43.400> get<00:03:43.520> a<00:03:43.550> ball<00:03:43.790> of<00:03:43.940> flames<00:03:44.210> there<00:03:45.220> it's<00:03:46.220> not

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.370 
you get a ball of flames there it's not

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:51.770 
you get a ball of flames there it's not
heated<00:03:46.700> up<00:03:46.850> yet
