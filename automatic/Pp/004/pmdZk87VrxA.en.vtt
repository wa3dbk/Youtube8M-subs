the color wheel pick our color maybe get
that<00:01:14.350> color<00:01:14.620> wheel<00:01:14.830> rotating<00:01:15.490> I'm<00:01:16.030> on<00:01:16.210> a<00:01:16.240> plane

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:16.540 
that color wheel rotating I'm on a plane

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.420 
that color wheel rotating I'm on a plane
I<00:01:16.810> can<00:01:17.229> see<00:01:17.560> that<00:01:17.680> I'm<00:01:17.740> rotating<00:01:18.040> my<00:01:18.250> color

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:18.430 
I can see that I'm rotating my color

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:20.760 
I can see that I'm rotating my color
wheel<00:01:18.580> same<00:01:19.360> thing<00:01:19.540> with<00:01:19.690> the<00:01:19.780> gobos<00:01:20.110> it's

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770 
wheel same thing with the gobos it's

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.070 
wheel same thing with the gobos it's
really<00:01:21.010> easy<00:01:21.280> to<00:01:22.060> see<00:01:22.299> what<00:01:22.510> gobos<00:01:22.870> were

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:23.080 
really easy to see what gobos were

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.110 
really easy to see what gobos were
choosing<00:01:23.350> what<00:01:24.250> wheel<00:01:24.430> were<00:01:24.640> choosing<00:01:24.880> that

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:25.120 
choosing what wheel were choosing that

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.920 
choosing what wheel were choosing that
gobo<00:01:25.479> from

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.220 

all<00:01:28.500> right<00:01:28.650> so<00:01:28.890> let's<00:01:29.130> talk<00:01:29.280> about<00:01:30.230> fixtures

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:31.230 
all right so let's talk about fixtures

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:34.880 
all right so let's talk about fixtures
like<00:01:31.410> a<00:01:32.480> Shogun<00:01:33.480> that<00:01:33.900> has<00:01:34.080> two<00:01:34.380> parts<00:01:34.680> to<00:01:34.770> it

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
like a Shogun that has two parts to it

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.240 
like a Shogun that has two parts to it
we<00:01:35.400> have<00:01:35.510> up<00:01:36.510> on<00:01:36.690> WYSIWYG<00:01:37.320> here<00:01:37.590> you<00:01:37.980> can<00:01:38.100> see

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
we have up on WYSIWYG here you can see

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.730 
we have up on WYSIWYG here you can see
that<00:01:38.400> we<00:01:38.490> have<00:01:38.640> a<00:01:38.670> ring<00:01:39.000> of<00:01:39.120> LEDs<00:01:39.480> around<00:01:39.900> a<00:01:40.320> cm

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
that we have a ring of LEDs around a cm

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.650 
that we have a ring of LEDs around a cm
light<00:01:40.920> fixture<00:01:41.310> so<00:01:42.000> if<00:01:42.060> you<00:01:42.120> look<00:01:42.270> back<00:01:42.420> down

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:42.660 
light fixture so if you look back down

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.080 
light fixture so if you look back down
here<00:01:42.990> I<00:01:43.170> can<00:01:44.130> pick<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.490> middle<00:01:44.850> of<00:01:45.000> the

here I can pick the middle of the

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.150 
here I can pick the middle of the
fixture<00:01:45.450> which<00:01:45.600> is<00:01:45.750> a<00:01:45.780> cm<00:01:46.110> wide<00:01:46.290> portion<00:01:46.800> and

fixture which is a cm wide portion and
put<00:01:47.700> it<00:01:47.790> in<00:01:47.910> color<00:01:48.800> All<00:01:49.800> in<00:01:50.010> One<00:01:50.040> fixture<00:01:50.369> icon

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
put it in color All in One fixture icon

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.660 
put it in color All in One fixture icon
this<00:01:52.350> multi<00:01:52.830> element<00:01:52.979> multi<00:01:53.490> parameter

we can pick an entire color brach block

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:04.820 
we can pick an entire color brach block
and<00:02:02.759> bring<00:02:02.970> it<00:02:03.060> to<00:02:03.149> full<00:02:03.440> or<00:02:04.440> we<00:02:04.590> can<00:02:04.740> pick

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:04.830 
and bring it to full or we can pick

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:06.580

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
back to the fixed review I can really

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:34.479 
back to the fixed review I can really
easily<00:02:32.130> recolor<00:02:32.640> one<00:02:32.910> section<00:02:33.330> or<00:02:33.630> another

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:34.489 
easily recolor one section or another

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:37.880 
easily recolor one section or another
very<00:02:35.489> quickly<00:02:35.730> and<00:02:36.209> it's<00:02:37.140> really<00:02:37.380> important

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
very quickly and it's really important

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.100 
very quickly and it's really important
that<00:02:37.920> we<00:02:38.160> can<00:02:38.370> actually<00:02:38.690> let's<00:02:39.690> say<00:02:39.840> put<00:02:40.049> a

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
that we can actually let's say put a

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.530 
that we can actually let's say put a
band<00:02:40.410> across<00:02:40.739> here<00:02:41.130> we<00:02:41.310> we<00:02:41.820> have<00:02:41.940> the<00:02:42.060> ability

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
band across here we we have the ability

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.539 
band across here we we have the ability
to<00:02:42.570> layout<00:02:42.989> our<00:02:43.170> fixtures<00:02:43.739> in<00:02:43.950> this<00:02:44.130> grid

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:44.549 
to layout our fixtures in this grid

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:47.000 
to layout our fixtures in this grid
which<00:02:44.820> in<00:02:44.970> the<00:02:45.060> real<00:02:45.239> world<00:02:45.650> makes<00:02:46.650> it<00:02:46.830> very

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
which in the real world makes it very

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.460 
which in the real world makes it very
very<00:02:47.250> easy<00:02:47.670> to<00:02:48.269> color<00:02:48.480> portions<00:02:49.049> of<00:02:49.140> that<00:02:49.290> that

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
very easy to color portions of that that

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.610 
very easy to color portions of that that
we

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
we

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.649 
we
wanna<00:02:49.799> color<00:02:50.010> if<00:02:50.610> I<00:02:50.760> want<00:02:51.000> to<00:02:51.090> take<00:02:51.239> the<00:02:51.360> middle

00:02:51.649 --> 00:02:51.659 
wanna color if I want to take the middle

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:53.869 
wanna color if I want to take the middle
of<00:02:51.780> this<00:02:51.930> column<00:02:52.319> here<00:02:52.650> and<00:02:52.860> make<00:02:53.400> it<00:02:53.549> green

00:02:53.869 --> 00:02:53.879 
of this column here and make it green

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:56.059 
of this column here and make it green
I'll<00:02:54.629> just<00:02:54.930> go<00:02:55.080> right<00:02:55.110> up<00:02:55.319> the<00:02:55.560> middle<00:02:55.709> and

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069 
I'll just go right up the middle and

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:58.630 
I'll just go right up the middle and
make<00:02:56.580> it<00:02:56.730> green

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
make it green

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.009 
make it green
well<00:02:59.640> we've<00:02:59.790> also<00:02:59.970> added<00:03:00.239> with<00:03:00.599> the<00:03:00.720> LED

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
well we've also added with the LED

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:02.990 
well we've also added with the LED
matrix<00:03:01.049> this<00:03:01.500> matrix<00:03:01.560> effects<00:03:02.340> and<00:03:02.730> video

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
matrix this matrix effects and video

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.750 
matrix this matrix effects and video
files<00:03:03.239> so<00:03:03.959> I'm<00:03:04.049> going<00:03:04.200> to<00:03:04.260> pull<00:03:04.440> up<00:03:04.590> a<00:03:04.799> matrix

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
files so I'm going to pull up a matrix

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.509 
files so I'm going to pull up a matrix
effect<00:03:05.879> here<00:03:06.420> perhaps<00:03:07.379> just<00:03:08.129> a<00:03:08.250> horizontal

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
effect here perhaps just a horizontal

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:10.630 
effect here perhaps just a horizontal
line<00:03:08.970> traveling<00:03:09.629> across<00:03:09.870> it

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
line traveling across it

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.710 
line traveling across it
of<00:03:11.640> course<00:03:11.909> you're<00:03:12.030> getting<00:03:12.090> visual<00:03:12.510> feedback

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
of course you're getting visual feedback

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.839 
of course you're getting visual feedback
and<00:03:13.590> you're<00:03:14.040> getting<00:03:14.159> the<00:03:14.400> effect<00:03:14.610> in<00:03:14.760> the

00:03:14.839 --> 00:03:14.849 
and you're getting the effect in the

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:17.270 
and you're getting the effect in the
real<00:03:15.000> world<00:03:15.239> and<00:03:15.810> of<00:03:15.959> course<00:03:16.230> this<00:03:16.890> the<00:03:17.099> light

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
real world and of course this the light

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.119 
real world and of course this the light
wave<00:03:17.549> we<00:03:18.209> can<00:03:18.239> recolor<00:03:18.750> just<00:03:19.409> a<00:03:19.530> section<00:03:19.920> of<00:03:20.040> it

00:03:20.119 --> 00:03:20.129 
wave we can recolor just a section of it

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:23.569 
wave we can recolor just a section of it
if<00:03:20.340> we<00:03:20.519> wanted<00:03:20.819> to<00:03:21.829> so<00:03:22.829> we<00:03:22.950> handle<00:03:23.250> LED

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:23.579 
if we wanted to so we handle LED

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:26.119 
if we wanted to so we handle LED
fixtures<00:03:23.970> a<00:03:24.030> lot<00:03:24.420> better<00:03:24.660> we<00:03:25.500> also<00:03:25.680> needed<00:03:26.040> to

00:03:26.119 --> 00:03:26.129 
fixtures a lot better we also needed to

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:28.039 
fixtures a lot better we also needed to
handle<00:03:26.370> media<00:03:26.790> servers<00:03:27.090> a<00:03:27.150> lot<00:03:27.269> better<00:03:27.480> so<00:03:27.959> I'm

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 
handle media servers a lot better so I'm

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:29.890 
handle media servers a lot better so I'm
going<00:03:28.200> to<00:03:28.260> call<00:03:28.470> up<00:03:28.500> my<00:03:28.620> media<00:03:29.010> server<00:03:29.340> layout

up a totally different set of fixtures
to<00:04:51.409> full<00:04:51.620> so<00:04:51.860> I<00:04:51.889> have<00:04:52.009> stuff<00:04:52.220> coming<00:04:52.250> from

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:52.580 
to full so I have stuff coming from

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:54.480 
to full so I have stuff coming from
playback<00:04:53.090> and<00:04:53.330> stuff<00:04:53.509> in<00:04:53.750> the<00:04:53.900> programmer

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:54.490 
playback and stuff in the programmer

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:56.680 
playback and stuff in the programmer
traditionally<00:04:55.490> on<00:04:55.610> most<00:04:55.789> consoles<00:04:56.270> if<00:04:56.449> I<00:04:56.539> was

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:56.690 
traditionally on most consoles if I was

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:58.809 
traditionally on most consoles if I was
to<00:04:56.840> use<00:04:57.020> that<00:04:57.229> console<00:04:57.650> store<00:04:57.889> function<00:04:58.400> I'd

00:04:58.809 --> 00:04:58.819 
to use that console store function I'd

00:04:58.819 --> 00:05:00.820 
to use that console store function I'd
only<00:04:59.000> be<00:04:59.210> storing<00:04:59.569> what's<00:04:59.720> in<00:04:59.840> the<00:04:59.930> playback<00:05:00.289> I

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:00.830 
only be storing what's in the playback I

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:03.129 
only be storing what's in the playback I
would<00:05:01.159> have<00:05:01.310> to<00:05:01.550> wrap<00:05:02.210> the<00:05:02.449> parameters<00:05:02.990> that

00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:03.139 
would have to wrap the parameters that

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:04.809 
would have to wrap the parameters that
are<00:05:03.199> active<00:05:03.710> suck<00:05:04.009> them<00:05:04.159> into<00:05:04.370> the<00:05:04.460> programmer

00:05:04.809 --> 00:05:04.819 
are active suck them into the programmer

00:05:04.819 --> 00:05:07.029 
are active suck them into the programmer
so<00:05:05.030> I<00:05:05.060> can<00:05:05.270> store<00:05:05.449> them<00:05:05.659> this<00:05:06.470> is<00:05:06.620> a<00:05:06.650> concept

00:05:07.029 --> 00:05:07.039 
so I can store them this is a concept

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:09.430 
so I can store them this is a concept
that<00:05:07.159> is<00:05:07.340> quite<00:05:07.759> difficult<00:05:08.000> for<00:05:08.300> beginners<00:05:08.930> to

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:09.440 
that is quite difficult for beginners to

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.189 
that is quite difficult for beginners to
comprehend<00:05:10.250> and<00:05:10.520> also<00:05:11.270> it<00:05:11.599> slows<00:05:11.960> the<00:05:12.110> whole

00:05:47.369 --> 00:05:47.379 
stage I didn't have to worry about

00:05:47.379 --> 00:05:49.289 
stage I didn't have to worry about
sucking<00:05:47.799> your<00:05:48.069> touching<00:05:48.459> is<00:05:48.909> what<00:05:49.119> you<00:05:49.209> have

00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:49.299 
sucking your touching is what you have

00:05:49.299 --> 00:05:50.909 
sucking your touching is what you have
to<00:05:49.449> do<00:05:49.539> on<00:05:49.689> some<00:05:49.869> consoles<00:05:50.349> or<00:05:50.469> grabbing<00:05:50.679> on

00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:50.919 
to do on some consoles or grabbing on

I<00:05:51.849> just<00:05:52.449> hit<00:05:52.569> my<00:05:52.689> store<00:05:53.049> look<00:05:53.259> but<00:05:53.469> that's<00:05:53.709> the

00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:53.919 
I just hit my store look but that's the

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:55.409 
I just hit my store look but that's the
look<00:05:54.069> I<00:05:54.189> want<00:05:54.369> to<00:05:54.429> see<00:05:54.579> I<00:05:54.759> want<00:05:54.819> to<00:05:55.029> store<00:05:55.209> that

00:05:55.409 --> 00:05:55.419 
look I want to see I want to store that

00:05:55.419 --> 00:05:58.289 
look I want to see I want to store that
one<00:05:56.639> one<00:05:57.639> last<00:05:57.849> thing

00:05:58.289 --> 00:05:58.299

one one last thing
we've<00:05:58.779> improved<00:05:59.429> how<00:06:00.429> we<00:06:00.489> actually<00:06:00.849> handle

00:06:02.329 --> 00:06:02.339 
we've improved how we actually handle

00:06:02.339 --> 00:06:07.579 
we've improved how we actually handle
complex<00:06:03.339> timing<00:06:04.089> in<00:06:04.539> look<00:06:04.989> stores<00:06:05.549> without

00:06:07.579 --> 00:06:07.589 
complex timing in look stores without

00:06:07.589 --> 00:06:10.529 
complex timing in look stores without
going<00:06:08.589> to<00:06:08.739> the<00:06:08.829> timeline<00:06:09.249> so<00:06:09.909> I've<00:06:10.119> created<00:06:10.269> to

00:06:10.529 --> 00:06:10.539 
going to the timeline so I've created to

00:06:10.539 --> 00:06:11.989 
going to the timeline so I've created to
look<00:06:10.689> here<00:06:10.929> where<00:06:11.079> the<00:06:11.199> lights<00:06:11.409> are<00:06:11.529> on

00:06:11.989 --> 00:06:11.999 
look here where the lights are on

00:06:11.999 --> 00:06:15.509 
look here where the lights are on
downstage<00:06:12.999> and<00:06:13.389> in<00:06:13.779> a<00:06:13.839> color<00:06:14.309> and<00:06:15.309> when<00:06:15.489> I

00:06:15.509 --> 00:06:15.519 
downstage and in a color and when I

00:06:15.519 --> 00:06:17.339 
downstage and in a color and when I
press<00:06:15.729> go<00:06:15.939> I<00:06:15.969> want<00:06:16.269> them<00:06:16.419> to<00:06:16.539> turn<00:06:16.689> on<00:06:16.899> and<00:06:17.229> then

00:06:17.339 --> 00:06:17.349 
press go I want them to turn on and then

00:06:17.349 --> 00:06:19.409 
press go I want them to turn on and then
move<00:06:17.559> downstage<00:06:18.009> then<00:06:18.429> change<00:06:18.699> color<00:06:18.939> all<00:06:19.179> in

00:06:19.409 --> 00:06:19.419 
move downstage then change color all in

00:06:19.419 --> 00:06:21.839 
move downstage then change color all in
that<00:06:19.569> burst<00:06:19.839> cue<00:06:20.369> traditional<00:06:21.369> Vista<00:06:21.699> we

00:06:21.839 --> 00:06:21.849 
that burst cue traditional Vista we

00:06:21.849 --> 00:06:24.539 
that burst cue traditional Vista we
would<00:06:21.999> had<00:06:22.209> to<00:06:22.239> go<00:06:22.869> to<00:06:22.929> the<00:06:23.079> timeline<00:06:23.319> and<00:06:23.859> move

00:06:24.539 --> 00:06:24.549 
would had to go to the timeline and move

00:06:24.549 --> 00:06:25.949 
would had to go to the timeline and move
things<00:06:24.759> around<00:06:24.909> to<00:06:25.179> make<00:06:25.329> that<00:06:25.479> happen<00:06:25.599> in<00:06:25.869> a

00:06:25.949 --> 00:06:25.959 
things around to make that happen in a

00:06:25.959 --> 00:06:28.109 
things around to make that happen in a
Vista<00:06:26.259> like<00:06:26.409> way<00:06:26.619> what<00:06:27.489> we<00:06:27.579> wanted<00:06:27.789> to<00:06:27.909> speed

00:06:28.109 --> 00:06:28.119 
Vista like way what we wanted to speed

00:06:28.119 --> 00:06:29.899 
Vista like way what we wanted to speed
up<00:06:28.239> that<00:06:28.360> process<00:06:28.419> so<00:06:29.049> our<00:06:29.169> new<00:06:29.289> store<00:06:29.589> button

00:06:29.899 --> 00:06:29.909 
up that process so our new store button

00:06:29.909 --> 00:06:32.039 
up that process so our new store button
brings<00:06:30.909> up<00:06:31.059> our<00:06:31.179> new<00:06:31.360> store<00:06:31.599> window<00:06:31.899> which

00:06:32.039 --> 00:06:32.049 
brings up our new store window which

00:06:32.049 --> 00:06:33.389 
brings up our new store window which
gives<00:06:32.259> you<00:06:32.379> a<00:06:32.409> lot<00:06:32.619> more<00:06:32.649> options<00:06:32.979> that<00:06:33.249> we

00:06:33.389 --> 00:06:33.399 
gives you a lot more options that we

00:06:33.399 --> 00:06:36.329 
gives you a lot more options that we
have<00:06:33.549> before<00:06:33.879> but<00:06:34.689> instead<00:06:34.869> of<00:06:35.169> using<00:06:35.409> default

that we're doing we're going on a custom
timing<00:06:41.679> and<00:06:42.129> I<00:06:42.399> want<00:06:42.610> position<00:06:42.999> to<00:06:43.089> have<00:06:43.239> to

00:06:43.379 --> 00:06:43.389 
timing and I want position to have to

00:06:43.389 --> 00:06:44.969 
timing and I want position to have to
happen<00:06:43.839> after<00:06:44.110> intensity<00:06:44.619> you<00:06:44.739> know<00:06:44.829> what

00:06:44.969 --> 00:06:44.979 
happen after intensity you know what

happen after intensity you know what
color<00:06:45.219> to<00:06:45.549> happen<00:06:46.389> after<00:06:46.659> position<00:06:47.079> I<00:06:47.319> hit<00:06:47.919> OK

00:06:48.209 --> 00:06:48.219 
color to happen after position I hit OK

00:06:48.219 --> 00:06:50.249 
color to happen after position I hit OK
and<00:06:48.509> I<00:06:49.509> should<00:06:49.689> have<00:06:49.779> actually<00:06:49.899> hit<00:06:50.139> this

00:06:50.249 --> 00:06:50.259 
and I should have actually hit this

00:06:50.259 --> 00:06:52.290 
and I should have actually hit this
first<00:06:50.469> sorry

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:52.300 
first sorry

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:54.540 
first sorry
there<00:06:52.900> we<00:06:53.050> go

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:54.550 
there we go

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:57.480 
there we go
I<00:06:54.640> had<00:06:55.240> okay<00:06:55.480> I<00:06:55.720> clear<00:06:56.050> my<00:06:56.170> programmer<00:06:56.590> and

00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:57.490 
I had okay I clear my programmer and

00:06:57.490 --> 00:06:59.150 
I had okay I clear my programmer and
when<00:06:57.670> I<00:06:57.700> activate<00:06:58.150> this<00:06:58.300> the<00:06:58.480> lights<00:06:58.660> come<00:06:58.870> on

00:06:59.150 --> 00:06:59.160 
when I activate this the lights come on

00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:05.260 
when I activate this the lights come on
then<00:07:00.160> they<00:07:00.370> move<00:07:00.630> then<00:07:01.630> they<00:07:01.750> change<00:07:01.990> colors

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:05.270 

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:07.029 

so<00:07:05.780> in<00:07:05.960> a<00:07:05.990> wrap-up<00:07:06.229> we've<00:07:06.590> tried<00:07:06.800> to<00:07:06.889> make

00:07:07.029 --> 00:07:07.039 
so in a wrap-up we've tried to make

00:07:07.039 --> 00:07:09.339 
so in a wrap-up we've tried to make
everything<00:07:07.310> a<00:07:08.180> lot<00:07:08.509> more<00:07:08.720> easier<00:07:09.020> we've<00:07:09.199> added

00:07:09.339 --> 00:07:09.349 
everything a lot more easier we've added

00:07:09.349 --> 00:07:10.570 
everything a lot more easier we've added
ton<00:07:09.590> of<00:07:09.620> new<00:07:09.800> features<00:07:09.919> that<00:07:10.220> I<00:07:10.280> haven't<00:07:10.520> even

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:10.580 
ton of new features that I haven't even

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:11.740 
ton of new features that I haven't even
gone<00:07:10.789> over<00:07:11.030> yet<00:07:11.210> we'll<00:07:11.389> have<00:07:11.509> more

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:11.750 
gone over yet we'll have more

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:14.890 
gone over yet we'll have more
