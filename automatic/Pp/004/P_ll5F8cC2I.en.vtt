 Lesson 2 Savelyeva Antonina knitting 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:09.160
 facial pepe 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:15.820
 Well, as always, we do not remove the first loop 

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:21.210
 knitting 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:21.210
 the front loop fits in this way 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:39.020
 at the front there are two walls with front and 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:41.570
 rear 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.770
 usually the front loop fits over the front 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:46.080
 wall 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:50.600
 with the front loop can be knit and for 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.600
 back wall like that 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:12.640
 such a facial loop turns out a little 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:15.310
 crossed and different from normal 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:18.520
 Loops in descriptions are required 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:21.369
 indicated and if the loop and knit for 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:26.830
 back wall diagrams it is denoted 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:30.369
 separate icon if all rows are knit 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:33.640
 face loop then we get 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:35.670
 another branch called stocking 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.670
 mating 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.090
 to tie the front surface 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:52.370
 we need odd rows we knit 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:57.080
 knit facial loops and in purses 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:02:00.490
 purl loops ie front row row 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:04.670
 wash the facial loops or house 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:08.680
 seamy night is obtained here 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.680
