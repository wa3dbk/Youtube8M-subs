00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 hey people welcome to a new video 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.600
 not everyone is equally beautiful but this one 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.220
 animals that are really bizarre ugly 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.290
 therefore here are the ten ugliest 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.230
 animals in the world 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:16.440
 the nose on this off has a huge 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.880
 nose males call this up everywhere the 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.619
 orang belanda 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.039
 or people who resemble the 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:25.260
 Dutch so you the parable 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.449
 The star moles are also incredible 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.650
 ugly nose words that you also up to it 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.359
 top team 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.669
 the nose resembles scientists 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.320
 a star but a dead octoplus would be whole 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.300
 can do well 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.020
 the alligator turtle with its ugly 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.219
 headline 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.960
 the dealer not only scares everyone 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.800
 but he can also quite 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.020
 bite hard now 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.850
 this turtle with it easily you 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.969
 fingers and toes off 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.309
 the ai also called the finger animal happy 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:53.670
 is this animal and active at night 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.420
 because then the naked and honorably dark 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.190
 mole rat 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.020
 do you remember the wifi animal from kim 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.030
 taste food 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:04.000
 well in real life it looks like this 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.799
 the blobvis this animal looks like a big one 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.180
 collapsed pudding 

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:09.280
 but apart from its reasonable appearance 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:12.009
 this fish still has a problem because 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.140
 there is threatened with extinction 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:16.390
 the red copy this bird looks like one 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.670
 crossing between a turkey and you control 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:21.009
 the head of the vulture has no feathers 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:24.190
 or hair and this gives one 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:26.470
 a particularly ugly appearance 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.420
 the elephant seal this animal has just like one 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:31.450
 elephant and trunk 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:33.570
 Also the animal is so super diet 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.940
 wouldn't hurt 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.250
 the sea iguana the animal is alone 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:42.240
 on the galapagos islands and what me 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.570
 he remains concerned that the sky 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.580
 look 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.110
 you learn you look a bit like one 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.970
 goldfish with inflated eyes 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.440
 but if you think he can see well 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.060
 with these big eyes 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.700
 then you are wrong this animal is 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.229
 really peel 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.820

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.540

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.340
