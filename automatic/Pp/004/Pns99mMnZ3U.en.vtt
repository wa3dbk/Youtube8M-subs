00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:06.009
 we are asked to check in each case if 

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:10.020
 the given fractions are equivalent is 

00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:10.020
 say starting with the paragraph 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.250
 it seems a 9 is 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:19.750
 we have to check if the fraction x 4 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:22.790
 / 3x minus 12 is equivalent to one third 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:26.570
 well how do we know they are equivalent or is 

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:28.939
 One way to find out is to simplify 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:31.789
 to the maximum simplify until you reach the 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:34.700
 irreducible fraction and then power 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:36.770
 see if they are exactly the same 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.810
 Well, that 's what we're going to do here 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:41.150
 second fraction of section a is already 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:45.470
 irreducible one third can no longer be 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:48.150
 simplify more the one on the left 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:52.410
 let's try to simplify it 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:52.410
 apparently it may not look like 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:57.020
 the first thing we would do is take out 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:01:00.590
 common factor 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:02.910
 apparently there is not and if not 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.890
 factorize 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.260
 the polynomials that you can not because 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.300
 they are already first grade okay I say that 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.640
 apparently there is no common factor because 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.800
 actually there is 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:19.020
 let's look at the one in which the 12 what 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:20.350
 we can write as 3 by 4 3 by 4 is 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.650
 a 12 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:25.630
 therefore down suddenly we see that 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:28.750
 yes that there is a common factor we have the 3 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:31.119
 multiplying the X and we have another 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.729
 3 exactly the same multiplying to 4 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:37.270
 so we can take the 3 as a factor 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:40.299
 common and that we have then the 3 here 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:44.130
 multiplied the X and 3 here 

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:44.130
 multiplied to minus 4 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:51.080
 because the x4 we have it as a factor 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:53.420
 up here for a 1 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.760
 remember that one factor means that 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.890
 is multiplying to something so if 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.960
 apparently does not multiply anything always 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.150
 we can put a sumo multiplying I'll 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.300
 to put here on the left is very 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:04.300
 ugly 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.330
 I'll put it to the right to see if 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:11.240
 it's a little better 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:13.220
 so the x4 which is a factor of the 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:16.160
 numerator and the x minus 4 that is a 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.540
 denominator factor are canceled and 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.470
 we have left 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.950
 one third 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:25.090
 Thus 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:28.569
 these two sections are equivalent 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.569
 describe here a yes 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:35.390
 and I'm going to erase this 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.390
 let's see section b 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:42.360
 the x match 2 again is already is 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:45.180
 irreducible we can not simplify 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.960
 more with the x with the 2 we can not do 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.990
 nothing 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:50.990
 let's try to simplify the first 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:56.060
 down we can not do anything there is no 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:58.640
 no addition or subtraction or anything is already 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.790
 updated above we could take out 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.689
 common factor 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.689
 let's remember 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:12.160
 what common factor means that we have 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:15.160
 something multiplying in all terms 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:17.380
 here we have an X and multiplying 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.390
 another xx squared and here we have a 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:23.380
 equis multiplying that multiplying 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:25.750
 to a 1 so we can take out x as 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.790
 factor common to this which is square 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:33.780
 removed one X and the other X is left 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:33.780
 already be x by 1 removed the x I stay 1 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:40.400
 if it simplified I realized that up 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:42.590
 I have an X as a factor and below 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.960
 I have an X as a factor that I 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:47.530
 cancel 

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:49.340
 and therefore 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:53.420
 I'm the same 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:57.500
 the x1 match 2 and this can no longer 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:59.599
 reduce more x plus 1 match 2 is not the 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:03.940
 same fraction as x match 2 

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:03.940
 therefore they are not equivalent 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:09.010
 let's go to section c 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:15.190
 we have x + and kiss game to 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:18.040
 square minus the square and 1 match x 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:20.410
 if again the one on the right is already 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:23.110
 irreducible the 1 in a way to reduce it 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:26.169
 and if one of the two sides of the fraction 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:28.900
 it is not reducible 1 is divisible the other 

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:32.139
 neither have we canceled anything for nothing 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:34.590
 let's see what happens with the first 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:36.810
 we have here an x ​​+ i 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:38.820
 there is no common factor there is nothing 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:41.220
 we can do 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:44.220
 however this square x less and at 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:46.890
 square if we know the identities 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:49.860
 remarkable we realize that this is 

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:51.150
 a difference of squares and one 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:53.320
 difference of squares 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:56.010
 comes from 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:56.010
 zuma 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:59.140
 by difference 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:05.190
 x + yx x if it is a sum for difference 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:07.470
 and it's the same as the differences in 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:08.970
 squares that the line from the first to the 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:13.790
 square minus the second squared 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:15.890
 we have a factor above that is 

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:18.800
 the new factor means that multiply 

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:22.010
 something here multiplies a 1 is 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:25.160
 important we have a multiplication x1 

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:27.800
 up and a team so that's factor 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:31.080
 also down and therefore we have 1 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:34.949
 match x minus and 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:40.789
 this fraction is the same as this one 

00:05:34.949 --> 00:05:40.789
 well that means they are equivalent 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:44.750
 and we go with the last 

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:52.630
 it's worth in the last both fractions are 

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:53.980
 they can simplify so let's 

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:56.610
 start with the first one I'm going to make a 

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:56.610
 little room 

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:04.260
 up there's nothing to do we have 

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:07.050
 only Equis does not have much to 

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:09.270
 simplify down we can draw factor 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:10.830
 common x again 

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:12.600
 common factor means that there is something 

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:15.600
 multiplying here we have 2x 

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:18.960
 multiplying and here an x for 1 

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:22.520
 so he took the X, here I have another one 

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:22.520
 X and here I have left 1 

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:28.840
 up I have a factor x the new factor 

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:31.420
 means that there is something multiplying not 

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:33.010
 we need to write the x 1 but 

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:34.900
 will help us see what is a factor that 

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:38.110
 is multiplying 

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:43.750
 then the factor x up and the factor x 

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:45.460
 down we are canceled and this is 1 / x 

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:47.650
 1 match 

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:49.270
 one 

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:52.310
 ok let's see what happens with the 

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:55.000
 down below we have 2 

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:58.030
 / 2 x 2 

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.460
 the 2 there is nothing to do but down 

00:06:58.030 --> 00:07:03.430
 we have a factor like a 2 of the new 

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:06.850
 train a 2 multiplying the X and this 

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:09.520
 2 are multiplying something if a 1 if 

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:11.870
 we want so we get the 2 with a 

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:15.140
 common factor and I have left 

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:18.640
 he took the goal I have the x and if I take out 

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:18.640
 the two I have the minus one 

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:23.510
 Now I realized that I have a factor 

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:25.970
 above and a factor below that are equal 

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:29.860
 which is the 2 this 2 above is a 

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:29.860
 factor because multiply 1 

00:07:30.129 --> 00:07:33.189
 and multiply nothing would not be the factor 

00:07:31.749 --> 00:07:36.560
 factor means a number that 

00:07:33.189 --> 00:07:41.240
 multiply if they cancel me 

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:43.300
 and I have 1 match x minus one as 

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:46.090
 these two fractions 

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:48.960
 They are exactly the same 

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:52.100
 these two here 

00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:52.100
 they are equivalent
