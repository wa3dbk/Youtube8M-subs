00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:14.410
 start your life journey to the end 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:16.539

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:19.359
 happy and sad moments are n't you 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:21.490
 find yourself your emotions are a mixture of 

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:23.320
 different memories at any moment she 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:25.359
 can cheer and tune in 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.369
 wave or help express your emotions 

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:29.619
 when nobody sees you when you 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:32.169
 alone with yourself you cannot imagine your 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:34.150
 life without her and if you are a man who 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:36.040
 experiencing similar feelings to music i 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:38.050
 imagine how scrupulous you are 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.520
 to the choice of every kind of audio 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.140
 because the sound quality is for you 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.270
 priority and headphones which 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.310
 abstracted from the whole world just 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:47.920
 necessary thing you guessed it 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:50.200
 Our review will talk about Marshal major 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.480
 fashionable popular recognizable thanks 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.820
 to your retro design model yes who are they 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:57.040
 does not know made in the style of the first 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.440
 headphones most common color 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.960
 so to say classic black and white 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.820
 the first is less whimsical more practical 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.070
 option over time they will not 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.259
 visible rubbing can not be said about 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.869
 second white but they look 

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:12.429
 somehow more airy and unusual such 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:14.590
 Headphones like lovers 

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:16.780
 natural materials after all here later 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.229
 on the cork arc outside it 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.270
 soul 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:21.310
 speakers covered with a mesh of natural 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.859
 fiber used velvety plastic 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:26.439
 very pleasant to the touch dust on it 

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:28.749
 accumulates and he does not mark his cups his ears 

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:30.939
 medium sized although the pictures may 

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:33.039
 seem more bulky fit 

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:35.079
 they sit pretty tightly enough but 

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:37.210
 do not completely isolate from external sounds 

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:39.609
 even though in their public transport 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.590
 your music will be enough too 

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:44.020
 if you like louder outside world 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.770
 will hear by the way they are very very 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.409
 loud 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:49.030
 insults and headband with a good move 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.950
 adjustments here inside flaunts 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.929
 autograph of the great jim marshal 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.359
 headphone design allows them 

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:58.620
 roll up to compact size like this 

00:01:55.359 --> 00:02:01.140
 and wrapped the cord around 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:03.270
 yes it is a little old school but here 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.800
 is it all in the spirit of retro and folded so 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.380
 the way headphones are basically 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:09.479
 fits in a jacket pocket on a cord of 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.940
 the remote control for the smartphone is already 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.590
 tribute to the present of the major model is one 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.640
 button and microphone button allows 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.770
 start and stop 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.230
 double click play 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:21.750
 switches the track to the next triple on 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:24.300
 previous double rewinding content 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.700
 track forward triple content back 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:29.100
 major fx versions also have keys 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.440
 volume control wire at the headphones 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:33.660
 solid enough weighty long 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.190
 due to its partially spiral sti you 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.020
 be able to lie back in the chair behind 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.270
 computer not worrying that length 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:41.580
 there is not enough wire but the cable can 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.660
 get confused especially if you clean up often 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.130
 headphones in the bag 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.110
 if they are purchased for 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:48.030
 stationary use for example 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.260
 if you are listening to music at the computer 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.480
 or play some music 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.120
 there will be no problem with this tool 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:56.730
 sound marshal major gives out a nice tight 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.890
 clean enough bass perfectly disclosed 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.230
 mids high pleasant not 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.450
 crushed in one word wonderful 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.380
 suitable for the average 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.540
 music lover at maximum volume 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:09.030
 I advise you not to listen as it is lost 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.730
 sound detailing and I repeat once again 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.800
 very very loud frequency range 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.100
 from 20 to 20,000 hertz 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.700
 resistance 32 ohm sensitivity 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.470
 121 decibels 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.989
 This model is a prime example. 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.459
 quality-price ratio but apparently they 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:25.950
 very favorably with competitors 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:27.570
 and at the same time the materials of their construction 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.940
 quality can be said at all outside 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:31.920
 competition in this price range is 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.780
