little solenoid knocks into the paper
with<00:00:43.920> great<00:00:44.160> force<00:00:45.320> the<00:00:46.320> great<00:00:46.500> precision<00:00:47.270> I'm

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
with great force the great precision I'm

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.690 
with great force the great precision I'm
going<00:00:48.420> to<00:00:48.480> run<00:00:48.570> a<00:00:48.629> self-test<00:00:49.079> on<00:00:49.379> it<00:00:49.530> so<00:00:50.520> here

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
going to run a self-test on it so here

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.560 
going to run a self-test on it so here
goes<00:00:52.340> okay<00:00:53.340> it's<00:00:53.550> on<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.910> print<00:00:54.180> hitters<00:00:54.449> to

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
goes okay it's on the print hitters to

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.750 
goes okay it's on the print hitters to
the<00:00:54.690> far<00:00:54.899> left<00:00:55.140> so<00:00:55.410> let's<00:00:55.559> go
