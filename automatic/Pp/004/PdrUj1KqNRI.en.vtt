changing back down basically use

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.270 
changing back down basically use

remember that little blip on the rev it
doesn't<00:02:32.379> look<00:02:32.500> like<00:02:32.530> I'm<00:02:32.890> using<00:02:33.129> my<00:02:33.489> clutch

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
doesn't look like I'm using my clutch

hand<00:02:34.090> that<00:02:34.299> I<00:02:34.450> am<00:02:34.629> I<00:02:34.930> notice<00:02:35.860> is<00:02:36.010> on<00:02:36.159> the

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
hand that I am I notice is on the

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.150 
hand that I am I notice is on the
previous<00:02:37.170> video<00:02:38.170> when<00:02:38.410> I<00:02:38.500> was<00:02:38.650> watching<00:02:38.860> it

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
previous video when I was watching it

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.470 
previous video when I was watching it
looks<00:02:39.340> like<00:02:39.519> I'm<00:02:39.670> not<00:02:39.819> using<00:02:40.000> my<00:02:40.239> closer

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
looks like I'm not using my closer

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.270 
looks like I'm not using my closer
change<00:02:40.840> down<00:02:41.290> but<00:02:41.530> I<00:02:41.680> am<00:02:43.560> so<00:02:44.560> really<00:02:45.010> that<00:02:45.160> is

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
change down but I am so really that is

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.809 
change down but I am so really that is
basically<00:02:45.910> it<00:02:46.209> the<00:02:46.900> next<00:02:47.230> section<00:02:47.670> use<00:02:48.670> an

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:48.819 
basically it the next section use an

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:51.149 
basically it the next section use an
approach<00:02:49.120> to<00:02:49.329> move<00:02:49.480> away<00:02:49.660> using<00:02:50.530> my<00:02:50.769> first<00:02:51.010> to

00:02:51.149 --> 00:02:51.159 
approach to move away using my first to

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:54.150 
approach to move away using my first to
go<00:02:51.280> to<00:02:51.340> second<00:02:52.440> and<00:02:53.440> now<00:02:53.709> I'm<00:02:53.829> not<00:02:53.980> going<00:02:54.099> to

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
go to second and now I'm not going to

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.440 
go to second and now I'm not going to
say<00:02:54.370> anything<00:02:54.579> I'm<00:02:54.790> just<00:02:54.819> going<00:02:55.090> to<00:02:55.150> let<00:02:55.329> you

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450

00:02:57.589 --> 00:02:57.599 
watch me change up and down my gears

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:22.570 
watch me change up and down my gears
have<00:02:58.599> a<00:02:58.629> listen<00:02:59.019> to<00:02:59.140> the<00:02:59.230> engine

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:22.580 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:25.720 

there<00:03:23.090> you<00:03:23.180> go<00:03:23.360> nothing<00:03:23.990> to<00:03:24.320> it<00:03:24.470> really<00:03:24.650> if<00:03:25.610> you

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
there you go nothing to it really if you

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.250 
there you go nothing to it really if you
try<00:03:26.000> and<00:03:26.120> change<00:03:26.330> gears<00:03:26.660> whilst<00:03:27.050> you're

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
accelerating without your clutch it's

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:32.200 
accelerating without your clutch it's
either<00:03:29.990> very<00:03:30.290> stiff<00:03:30.800> or<00:03:31.220> hard<00:03:31.610> or<00:03:32.000> impossible

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:32.210 
either very stiff or hard or impossible

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:41.680 
either very stiff or hard or impossible
to<00:03:32.690> do<00:03:33.220> either<00:03:34.220> ways<00:03:34.610> not<00:03:34.910> desirable

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:43.540
