00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:07.529
 nice guys this wood and we are 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.630
 back with the series I promised 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:13.110
 we started now with the 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:15.809
 series on classes and goss 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.119
 I start by saying that I am not I have not 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.430
 tried ie I don't know the game there 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.310
 perfection because they have not revealed 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.470
 all they have just said more or 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.960
 less what are i because even if not there 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.510
 they are ultra-detailed explanations though 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.870
 generically with these because yes 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:36.989
 could you could build let's say 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.210
 of the classes and these classes are already me 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.219
 came to mind is sails I will show in 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.600
 this series of videos before doing 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.940
 see the classes have been released 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.739
 even weapons 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.930
 and since this first video on 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:52.559
 classes and a video focused on 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.210
 sniper because I wanted to concentrate 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.090
 on the sniper because of the fact that it is 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.379
 mine 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:00.359
 let's say my favorite weapon mine 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.030
 ambit though it still plays a lot 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.369
 often also with the rest is here I put you 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.080
 the list of sniper weapons I put 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.580
 even those marx man they should 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.460
 be weapons that are a mixture of 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.229
 Assault weapons mixed with snipers 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.390
 however, they all look good new 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.740
 practically and therefore in the end I am 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.509
 sniper in the other games these 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.180
 they called snipers in a nutshell with 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.950
 this little tripp to change names 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.659
 according to me it is not under sniper in the game 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.470
 the ones that inspire me the most are i 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:31.229
 links that reminds me of a barrett and him 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.720
 srl 115 which reminds me of 118 but 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.400
 let's go straight to this I have this 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.100
 screen that is the screen in fact 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:41.520
 of the classes then I made four 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:45.119
 classes 2 for each type of platform 2 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:47.490
 for pc and two for consoles and two with 11 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.409
 points available and two with 8 points a 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.840
 arrangement because you know that in this 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:55.170
 game for perks you have points a 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.719
 arrangement ie 11 if you do not put lethal 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:01.110
 and tactics 8 if it had effects instead 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:03.600
 lethal or tactical then let's see here 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:06.780
 we see the list on the left of the pci ea 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:10.509
 right of the console 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:12.370
 for pc i put here i find it would be 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:15.940
 Quick extraction to undermine faster 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:19.569
 ping because if you are trying to do 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:22.390
 feed ping tt illustrious enemies who are 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:24.010
 close steve game that is practically 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:28.410
 you can afford not to close 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:30.640
 perfectly quick but ramble 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:33.489
 drool a little and still go to the same 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.350
 time the topless bullet to avoid 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:37.989
 to be of having too much backlash 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:40.540
 if they hit you and then blast shield eta 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:43.110
 crisis to avoid being hit by 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:47.320
 several shits in the casey while 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:48.940
 while you are practically not 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.620
 I know you're trying to trust me 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.610
 a thousand people come to break the 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.220
 dick 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:58.660
 and then I can understand that he can 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:03:01.180
 So what could be bothering 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:03.610
 different from that of the consoles between 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:07.680
 console and pc 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:11.079
 I felt compelled to advise 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:13.900
 to give a little advice on consoles 

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:15.579
 not both the speed that is with 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.040
 mouse aiming or with the keyboard 

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:20.530
 moving etc. and so on but it is a 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.989
 slightly slower and therefore practically o 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:25.030
 sad stalker instead of ping because 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:25.959
 ping is not essential above all 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.820
 for gameplay 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:30.549
 ok to make movies but for gameplay 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:32.590
 it is not essential instead of ping ho 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:34.570
 put stalker because so you can that you 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:37.750
 they can do the drive a lot more purpose 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:41.230
 quickly and therefore you have an advantage 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:43.120
 we come immediately to the second part in 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.430
 which we basically have 8 points a 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.230
 provision with 8 provisions points 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.579
 I made two classes the same because 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.370
 however there is nothing 

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:53.890
 particularly different in this case 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:57.830
 while it will change a mess between pc and 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:04:00.620
 console with assault weapons and weapons 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:02.360
 take them off with the shit then I have 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.400
 always put quickdrop because with 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:07.100
 milan sniper fast indispensable ce 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:09.860
 mv 2 mv iii and c and teach it 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:11.360
 mainly teaches blackhawks 2 where 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:13.190
 there is no possibility to aim any more 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:15.350
 quickly with the sniper then 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:17.030
 quickdrop for me in any class 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:19.130
 sniper considered the fact that it is worth 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:21.080
 one because to the side you see that there is 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:24.280
 written numbers and prizes for points 

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:27.410
 which are worth is then draw for me is over 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:29.450
 indispensable as a third I put tac 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:31.220
 always resists for the same reason that 

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:32.450
 this class is made to try to do 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:34.880
 feeder the castes making the end 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:37.040
 Stun week will devastate this 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:38.060
 class is made to make field for a 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:40.940
 main reason 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:42.380
 the second open let's pause a 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:44.000
 moment on this second offered before 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:46.400
 to close the video this second 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.430
 because it is called dead eye 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:51.860
 this because it practically says increases 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:54.290
 the damage you do to each consecutive kg 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:56.990
 in this case with the sniper if also 

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:59.930
 this is a permanent increase either 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:01.910
 that it is a momentary increase 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:03.530
 however the fidh must be 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:05.630
 from adopting so fast that even 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:07.760
 if the increase is momentary then 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:10.790
 surely this was because it was going to go 

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:13.880
 favor us because we will avoid doing so 

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:15.410
 markers is that fucking weak 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.790
 I think this is meant for 

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:19.580
 the snipers trying to feed 

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:23.540
 despite costing a lot of money e 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:25.760
 there's solid points so this is one 

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:27.410
 class to make feed while the other is more 

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:29.240
 a class for gameplay 

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:31.520
 I hope this video is there 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:34.100
 liked it and let me know in the comments 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:37.850
 instead what do you think the classes are 

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:40.010
 at high to make films and to snap and 

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:43.580
 radius only for gameplay then the 

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:45.440
 first episode of the classes is finished e 

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:48.560
 I hope you enjoyed it enough 

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:50.600
 I hope that others would like it 

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:53.000
 in fact I ask you beyond cristini le 

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:55.669
 classes according to you also register 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:59.630
 in the comments which is the next type of 

00:05:55.669 --> 00:06:01.880
 class that you want to see and I greet you 

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:05.830
 at this point or because it is not there before but 

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:05.830
 not to say we feel the next
