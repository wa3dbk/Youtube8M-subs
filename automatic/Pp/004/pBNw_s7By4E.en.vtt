00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:14.440 
had the incendiary grenades which is a

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.980 
had the incendiary grenades which is a
very<00:01:15.250> very<00:01:15.700> nice<00:01:16.030> thing<00:01:16.090> to<00:01:16.570> have<00:01:16.720> because

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
very very nice thing to have because

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.080 
very very nice thing to have because
people<00:01:17.920> are<00:01:18.010> gonna<00:01:18.130> run<00:01:18.400> through<00:01:18.610> that<00:01:18.760> and

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 
people are gonna run through that and

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.390 
people are gonna run through that and
it's<00:01:19.930> just<00:01:20.020> a<00:01:20.230> normal<00:01:20.350> nade<00:01:20.740> which<00:01:21.010> doesn't

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:21.400 
it's just a normal nade which doesn't

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.130 
it's just a normal nade which doesn't
have<00:01:21.520> really<00:01:21.760> the<00:01:21.970> same<00:01:22.210> area<00:01:22.540> of<00:01:22.570> effect<00:01:22.960> or

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.140 
have really the same area of effect or

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.440 
have really the same area of effect or
lasting<00:01:23.620> area<00:01:23.950> of<00:01:24.040> effect<00:01:24.400> so<00:01:25.000> I<00:01:25.060> got<00:01:25.240> to<00:01:25.300> do<00:01:25.360> it

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:25.450 
lasting area of effect so I got to do it

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:26.250 
lasting area of effect so I got to do it
the<00:01:25.540> old-fashioned<00:01:26.080> way

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:26.260 
the old-fashioned way

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.950 
the old-fashioned way
with<00:01:26.950> bullets<00:01:27.340> peeking<00:01:28.090> and<00:01:28.240> hoping<00:01:28.750> not<00:01:28.900> to

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:28.960 
with bullets peeking and hoping not to

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.810 
with bullets peeking and hoping not to
get<00:01:29.200> shot<00:01:29.230> and<00:01:29.650> I<00:01:29.680> think<00:01:30.100> somebody<00:01:30.310> saved<00:01:30.670> me

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:30.820 
get shot and I think somebody saved me

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.210 
get shot and I think somebody saved me
so<00:01:31.540> we<00:01:32.080> have<00:01:32.170> a<00:01:32.200> commander<00:01:32.620> I'm<00:01:32.830> not<00:01:33.070> gonna

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:33.220 
so we have a commander I'm not gonna

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.340 
so we have a commander I'm not gonna
waste<00:01:33.400> my<00:01:33.520> pokeballs<00:01:34.090> at<00:01:34.270> this<00:01:34.420> very<00:01:34.720> moment<00:01:35.080> I

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
waste my pokeballs at this very moment I

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:36.990 
waste my pokeballs at this very moment I
always<00:01:35.590> keep<00:01:35.770> that<00:01:35.920> in<00:01:36.070> mind<00:01:36.310> if<00:01:36.490> you<00:01:36.610> have<00:01:36.640> the

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000 
always keep that in mind if you have the

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:13.180 
these guys are swimming outside they've
got<00:05:11.720> to<00:05:11.810> come<00:05:11.990> up<00:05:12.020> the<00:05:12.230> concrete<00:05:12.440> and<00:05:12.950> that's

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:13.190 
got to come up the concrete and that's

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:15.970 
got to come up the concrete and that's
like<00:05:13.430> death's<00:05:13.850> doorstep<00:05:14.210> if<00:05:15.050> you're<00:05:15.110> swimming

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:15.980 
like death's doorstep if you're swimming

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:18.160 
like death's doorstep if you're swimming
in<00:05:16.070> your<00:05:16.130> defender<00:05:16.820> you're<00:05:17.420> not<00:05:17.690> in<00:05:17.960> the

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:18.170 
in your defender you're not in the

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:19.720 
in your defender you're not in the
parking<00:05:18.440> garage<00:05:18.500> you're<00:05:19.250> probably<00:05:19.550> not

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:19.730 
parking garage you're probably not

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:21.400 
parking garage you're probably not
getting<00:05:20.000> back<00:05:20.210> in<00:05:20.480> here<00:05:20.720> because<00:05:21.170> there's

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:21.410 
getting back in here because there's

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:24.280 
getting back in here because there's
only<00:05:21.560> a<00:05:21.650> couple<00:05:21.710> spots<00:05:22.130> that<00:05:22.400> the<00:05:23.290> defenders

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:24.290 
only a couple spots that the defenders

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:26.560 
only a couple spots that the defenders
can<00:05:24.440> come<00:05:24.590> up<00:05:24.710> on<00:05:24.890> so<00:05:25.430> it's<00:05:25.580> not<00:05:25.760> the<00:05:26.060> best<00:05:26.300> if

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:26.570 
can come up on so it's not the best if

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:27.610

you<00:05:26.660> guys<00:05:26.810> get<00:05:26.990> knocked<00:05:27.200> out<00:05:27.350> with<00:05:27.530> this
