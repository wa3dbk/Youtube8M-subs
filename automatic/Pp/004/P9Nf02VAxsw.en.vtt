the bottle for more nail polish and I

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:55.000 
the bottle for more nail polish and I
know<00:03:51.740> it<00:03:52.100> sometimes<00:03:52.940> be<00:03:53.270> a<00:03:53.300> pain<00:03:54.010> painting

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010 
know it sometimes be a pain painting

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:59.050 
know it sometimes be a pain painting
smaller<00:03:55.610> toenails<00:03:56.680> because<00:03:57.680> it<00:03:58.430> could<00:03:58.760> get<00:03:59.000> a

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
smaller toenails because it could get a

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.980 
smaller toenails because it could get a
little<00:03:59.390> messy<00:04:00.040> but<00:04:01.450> like<00:04:02.450> I<00:04:02.600> said<00:04:02.660> at<00:04:02.900> the

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:02.990 
little messy but like I said at the

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:05.920 
little messy but like I said at the
beginning<00:04:03.110> if<00:04:03.560> you<00:04:03.710> don't<00:04:03.890> have<00:04:04.930> copious

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
beginning if you don't have copious

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:08.980 
beginning if you don't have copious
amounts<00:04:06.680> of<00:04:06.800> nail<00:04:07.070> polish<00:04:07.610> on<00:04:07.850> the<00:04:08.300> brush<00:04:08.330> then

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:08.990 
amounts of nail polish on the brush then

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:10.240 
amounts of nail polish on the brush then
it<00:04:09.230> really<00:04:09.410> shouldn't<00:04:09.740> be<00:04:09.830> a<00:04:09.860> problem

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:10.250 
it really shouldn't be a problem

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:19.000 
it really shouldn't be a problem
crap<00:04:10.940> caught<00:04:11.360> it<00:04:11.480> on<00:04:11.570> my<00:04:11.750> nail<00:04:17.739> it's<00:04:18.739> kind<00:04:18.980> of

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.010 
crap caught it on my nail it's kind of

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:24.540 
crap caught it on my nail it's kind of
difficult<00:04:19.220> doing<00:04:19.730> it<00:04:19.850> with<00:04:20.000> one<00:04:20.030> hand<00:04:20.410> but<00:04:21.410> I

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:35.110 

got<00:04:25.550> it

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:35.120 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:41.809 

is<00:04:36.120> it<00:04:37.849> and<00:04:38.849> I<00:04:38.940> mean<00:04:40.160> it's<00:04:41.160> always<00:04:41.520> better<00:04:41.699> to

00:04:41.809 --> 00:04:41.819 
is it and I mean it's always better to

00:04:41.819 --> 00:04:44.510 
is it and I mean it's always better to
have<00:04:41.970> the<00:04:42.380> spacers<00:04:43.380> to<00:04:43.410> like<00:04:43.860> spread<00:04:44.310> your

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 
have the spacers to like spread your

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.089 
have the spacers to like spread your
toes<00:04:44.550> so<00:04:45.030> that<00:04:45.410> you<00:04:46.410> don't<00:04:46.590> end<00:04:46.770> up<00:04:46.949> getting

00:04:47.089 --> 00:04:47.099 
toes so that you don't end up getting

00:04:47.099 --> 00:04:49.490 
toes so that you don't end up getting
the<00:04:47.370> nail<00:04:47.550> polish<00:04:48.090> on<00:04:48.419> your<00:04:48.750> other<00:04:48.930> toe<00:04:49.259> or

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:49.500 
the nail polish on your other toe or

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.890 
the nail polish on your other toe or
anything<00:04:49.740> and<00:04:50.099> then<00:04:50.190> it<00:04:50.250> messes<00:04:50.729> it<00:04:50.910> up<00:04:51.000> but<00:04:51.720> I

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
anything and then it messes it up but I

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:57.409 
anything and then it messes it up but I
usually<00:04:52.560> really<00:04:52.979> never<00:04:53.660> use<00:04:54.660> it<00:04:54.840> so<00:04:55.849> um<00:04:56.849> yeah

00:04:57.409 --> 00:04:57.419
