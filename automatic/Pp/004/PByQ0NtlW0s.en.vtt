00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
this trailer the first look at the m82 a

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.369 
this trailer the first look at the m82 a
3<00:02:34.650> 50<00:02:35.250> caliber<00:02:35.730> semi-automatic<00:02:36.060> sniper<00:02:36.540> rifle

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:37.379 
3 50 caliber semi-automatic sniper rifle

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:39.589 
3 50 caliber semi-automatic sniper rifle
and<00:02:37.590> it<00:02:38.280> looks<00:02:38.430> like<00:02:38.579> it<00:02:38.700> spawns<00:02:39.030> somewhere<00:02:39.510> up

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 
and it looks like it spawns somewhere up

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:41.569 
and it looks like it spawns somewhere up
on<00:02:39.719> this<00:02:39.900> kind<00:02:40.590> of<00:02:40.709> vantage<00:02:41.129> point<00:02:41.430> up<00:02:41.549> here

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:41.579 
on this kind of vantage point up here

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:43.880 
on this kind of vantage point up here
and<00:02:41.969> it<00:02:42.150> looks<00:02:42.180> like<00:02:42.420> it<00:02:42.510> only<00:02:42.569> has<00:02:42.810> 22<00:02:43.319> bullets

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
and it looks like it only has 22 bullets

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.119 
and it looks like it only has 22 bullets
so<00:02:44.430> definitely<00:02:44.730> limited<00:02:45.150> ammo<00:02:45.829> and<00:02:46.829> also

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:47.129 
so definitely limited ammo and also

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:48.289 
so definitely limited ammo and also
doesn't<00:02:47.370> look<00:02:47.459> like<00:02:47.549> this<00:02:47.700> guy's<00:02:47.819> playing<00:02:48.090> as

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:48.299 
doesn't look like this guy's playing as

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:50.089 
doesn't look like this guy's playing as
recon<00:02:48.810> so<00:02:48.989> what<00:02:49.139> we've<00:02:49.230> heard<00:02:49.409> so<00:02:49.680> far<00:02:49.709> is<00:02:49.950> that

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:50.099 
recon so what we've heard so far is that

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:52.429 
recon so what we've heard so far is that
the<00:02:50.519> 50<00:02:51.000> caliber<00:02:51.299> sniper<00:02:51.329> rifle<00:02:51.870> is<00:02:52.049> actually

00:02:52.429 --> 00:02:52.439 
the 50 caliber sniper rifle is actually

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:54.679 
the 50 caliber sniper rifle is actually
a<00:02:52.500> droppable<00:02:52.950> item<00:02:53.430> that's<00:02:53.849> located<00:02:54.269> at<00:02:54.629> a

00:02:54.679 --> 00:02:54.689 
a droppable item that's located at a

00:02:54.689 --> 00:02:56.539 
a droppable item that's located at a
specific<00:02:55.170> point<00:02:55.650> on<00:02:55.829> the<00:02:55.920> map<00:02:55.950> instead<00:02:56.370> of

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:56.549 
specific point on the map instead of

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:58.640 
specific point on the map instead of

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
being an equippable loadout weapon like

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.550 
being an equippable loadout weapon like
all<00:02:58.799> the<00:02:58.920> other<00:02:59.040> sniper<00:02:59.340> rifles<00:02:59.670> in<00:02:59.760> the<00:02:59.879> game

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
all the other sniper rifles in the game

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.839 
all the other sniper rifles in the game
he<00:03:01.560> also<00:03:01.680> knows<00:03:01.919> once<00:03:02.129> he<00:03:02.250> looks<00:03:02.519> through<00:03:02.760> his

00:03:02.839 --> 00:03:02.849 
he also knows once he looks through his

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:04.610 
he also knows once he looks through his
scope<00:03:03.359> he<00:03:03.599> has<00:03:03.780> the<00:03:03.810> option<00:03:04.049> on<00:03:04.290> the<00:03:04.349> left<00:03:04.379> side

of his screen for the ziering allow you

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:08.569 
of his screen for the ziering allow you
to<00:03:06.689> range<00:03:07.049> your<00:03:07.290> scope<00:03:07.620> and<00:03:07.799> compensate<00:03:08.370> for

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:08.579 
to range your scope and compensate for

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:09.949 
to range your scope and compensate for
distance<00:03:09.030> and<00:03:09.209> that's<00:03:09.720> going<00:03:09.810> to<00:03:09.870> be

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
distance and that's going to be

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:11.210 
distance and that's going to be
available<00:03:10.109> not<00:03:10.349> only<00:03:10.379> to<00:03:10.650> this<00:03:10.769> weapon<00:03:11.099> but

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
available not only to this weapon but

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:16.750 
available not only to this weapon but
all<00:03:11.400> these<00:03:11.639> sniper<00:03:11.939> rifles<00:03:12.269> in<00:03:12.450> the<00:03:12.569> game

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.550 

there's<00:03:17.760> another<00:03:17.939> look<00:03:18.150> at<00:03:18.299> this<00:03:18.419> CZ<00:03:18.900> 805

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
there's another look at this CZ 805

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.280 
there's another look at this CZ 805
which<00:03:19.950> is<00:03:20.069> a<00:03:20.099> czech<00:03:20.370> republic<00:03:20.939> assault<00:03:21.840> rifle

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
which is a czech republic assault rifle

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:23.509 
which is a czech republic assault rifle
we've<00:03:22.379> seen<00:03:22.560> quite<00:03:22.650> a<00:03:22.739> bit<00:03:22.799> of<00:03:22.980> this<00:03:23.099> early<00:03:23.489> on

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
we've seen quite a bit of this early on

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:28.159 
we've seen quite a bit of this early on
an<00:03:23.790> e3<00:03:24.299> though<00:03:26.299> here's<00:03:27.299> a<00:03:27.359> really<00:03:27.750> cool<00:03:27.959> clip

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:28.169 
an e3 though here's a really cool clip

00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:30.140 
an e3 though here's a really cool clip
that<00:03:28.260> actually<00:03:28.530> shows<00:03:28.560> a<00:03:29.069> helicopter<00:03:29.849> flying

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
that actually shows a helicopter flying

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.119 
that actually shows a helicopter flying
over<00:03:30.540> destroying<00:03:31.169> a<00:03:31.349> bridge<00:03:31.650> which<00:03:32.010> is

00:03:32.119 --> 00:03:32.129 
over destroying a bridge which is

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:33.949 
over destroying a bridge which is
definitely<00:03:32.280> going<00:03:32.609> to<00:03:32.669> change<00:03:32.969> how<00:03:33.540> the<00:03:33.599> map

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
definitely going to change how the map

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:35.360 
definitely going to change how the map
is<00:03:34.079> going<00:03:34.229> to<00:03:34.290> be<00:03:34.349> played<00:03:34.530> now<00:03:34.709> you<00:03:34.769> can't<00:03:35.069> take

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
is going to be played now you can't take

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.629 
is going to be played now you can't take
tanks<00:03:35.909> or<00:03:36.090> other<00:03:36.419> land<00:03:36.870> vehicles<00:03:37.349> across<00:03:37.650> this

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:38.639 
tanks or other land vehicles across this

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:41.000 
tanks or other land vehicles across this
area<00:03:39.060> because<00:03:39.389> the<00:03:39.629> bridges<00:03:40.620> essentially

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
area because the bridges essentially

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.860 
area because the bridges essentially
destroyed<00:03:41.370> so<00:03:41.549> it's<00:03:41.669> definitely<00:03:41.940> another

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
destroyed so it's definitely another

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.479 
destroyed so it's definitely another
factor<00:03:43.409> of<00:03:43.440> l'évolution<00:03:44.129> that's<00:03:44.280> going<00:03:44.430> to

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
factor of l'évolution that's going to

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:46.280 
factor of l'évolution that's going to
change<00:03:44.790> the<00:03:45.090> battlefield<00:03:45.599> as<00:03:45.750> the<00:03:46.139> match

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
change the battlefield as the match

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.069 
change the battlefield as the match
continues<00:03:46.590> to<00:03:46.979> play<00:03:47.159> out<00:03:47.340> and<00:03:48.019> here's<00:03:49.019> a
