00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
my home goods store so I thought that I

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.049 
my home goods store so I thought that I
would<00:00:49.320> just<00:00:49.649> smell<00:00:49.890> them<00:00:50.070> on<00:00:50.219> cold<00:00:50.489> throw<00:00:50.760> and

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
would just smell them on cold throw and

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.479 
would just smell them on cold throw and
see<00:00:51.090> what<00:00:51.570> I<00:00:51.600> thought<00:00:51.930> so<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:53.070> first<00:00:53.280> one<00:00:53.460> I

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
see what I thought so the first one I

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.430 
see what I thought so the first one I
picked<00:00:53.760> up<00:00:53.910> was<00:00:54.120> this<00:00:54.300> one<00:00:54.570> this<00:00:54.780> lemon<00:00:55.199> pound

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440

actually<00:01:04.019> my<00:01:04.260> Illuma<00:01:04.739> lid<00:01:04.920> as<00:01:05.070> you<00:01:05.159> can<00:01:05.339> see

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
actually my Illuma lid as you can see

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.960 
actually my Illuma lid as you can see
fits<00:01:06.330> over<00:01:06.750> it<00:01:07.400> perfectly<00:01:08.400> just<00:01:08.790> like<00:01:08.850> a

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
fits over it perfectly just like a

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.330 
fits over it perfectly just like a
Yankee<00:01:09.240> candle<00:01:09.780> would<00:01:10.020> um<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:11.189> only

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
Yankee candle would um the only

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.670 
Yankee candle would um the only
difference<00:01:11.850> is<00:01:12.090> that<00:01:12.119> these<00:01:12.659> village<00:01:13.229> candles

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
difference is that these village candles

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:14.830 
difference is that these village candles
have<00:01:13.860> two<00:01:14.159> wicks

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
all the way around like I said the only

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.649 
all the way around like I said the only
difference<00:01:55.799> is<00:01:56.399> that<00:01:56.820> there<00:01:57.119> are<00:01:57.210> two<00:01:57.450> weeks

instead of just one and the wicks to me
I<00:02:01.110> was<00:02:01.469> very<00:02:01.710> hesitant<00:02:01.950> at<00:02:02.340> first<00:02:02.369> because

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
I was very hesitant at first because

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.740 
I was very hesitant at first because
they<00:02:03.659> are<00:02:03.689> very<00:02:04.140> very<00:02:04.560> small<00:02:05.040> very<00:02:05.460> very<00:02:05.880> puny

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:52.829 
was the exact same price $10 $9.99 then

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:55.490
