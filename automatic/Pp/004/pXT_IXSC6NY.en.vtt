say like handlebars that's right so you

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.560 
say like handlebars that's right so you
can<00:00:48.480> do<00:00:48.600> that<00:00:48.840> you<00:00:49.559> can<00:00:49.710> make<00:00:49.860> a<00:00:50.010> tightrope<00:00:50.570> you

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
can do that you can make a tightrope you

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.660 
can do that you can make a tightrope you
can<00:00:51.690> actually<00:00:51.809> sway<00:00:52.230> and<00:00:52.530> fall<00:00:52.770> off<00:00:52.949> it's

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
can actually sway and fall off it's

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.500 
can actually sway and fall off it's
pretty<00:00:53.730> cool<00:00:55.010> and<00:00:56.010> then<00:00:56.250> this<00:00:57.059> is<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.390> main

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510
