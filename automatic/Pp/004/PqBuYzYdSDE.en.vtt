00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:09.240
 the living of poems and the fotonovelas the 

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:09.240
 net it rains 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.150
 I hope they are very well be 

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:17.440
 welcome another secret of jeta 5 and 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.840
 well today we will be more than anything 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:21.550
 watching as a small instaure that no 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:25.330
 it's nothing special they're going to enter this 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:27.580
 page called the artist sociology 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:29.860
 they can look for it just as it causes 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:31.990
 or you can look for it this way with 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:34.750
 any phrase that does not come in the url 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:36.970
 is not anything special and we will 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.920
 play a particular game we're going to 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:40.900
 play to be god and right now we are 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:43.629
 seeing this little picture we do not see this 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:45.940
 nice family with her puppy a car 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:48.610
 and down comes a large button with a 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:50.559
 ray that I clicked to play go this can 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:53.110
 be offensive to people who 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:55.449
 they believe in some religion or they are very 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:57.580
 attached to his religion no and I respect 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:59.260
 that there already it clicks the button and if they occur 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:01.330
 account they see what happened to the family 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.769
 collided this I think that more than anything 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:05.710
 it's like a critique of religions 

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:08.080
 to this kind god but that life 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:11.080
 then other things are revealed not then 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:13.330
 it's like an incongruity in this of the 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.970
 religions now we saw 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:18.010
 the city and then you picassent play 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.270
 make god and come out this is one kills me 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:21.640
 200,000 people 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.830
 I as an atheist that I am gave me a lot 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.380
 laugh this is but have not taken it wrong 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:29.320
 I just like this kind of 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:31.750
 humor I know what good is black humor 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.490
 but as the joke says no humor 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.910
 black, not everyone has the same 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:35.910
 legs 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.650
 well I'm already liked this more 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.600
 that nothing is like a joke that put us 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:51.729
 rock star on the internet can access it 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.280
 just as I said look 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:55.780
 some sentence of the url and they already enter and 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.750
 play to make god I would have liked 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.430
 that they had put more things but not 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.520
 they put nothing else simply the one of the 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:06.040
 family and the city not what happened a 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.270
 tsunami you tell me what do you think the 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.580
 truth that I do not like to talk about 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:12.040
 religions in videos neither of beliefs nor 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.780
 of politics or anything like that more than anything 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.280
 because it's a video game channel, not if 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.750
 outside a channel specifically for 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.410
 talk about those issues because it would be fine 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.770
 but 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:23.020
 it's not like you like it if you liked it and if not 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:26.110
 did you like to comment me what do you think about 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:28.090
 these are bad things are good your 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.280
 humor is not your humor is a criticism or 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:33.810
 just that it's a joke that you stay gay 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.810
 see you later goodbye
