00:00:04.089 --> 00:00:08.780
 today in europe more than 90% of 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.639
 co2 emissions come from the 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:14.179
 electricity generation and heating 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:15.320
 domestic energy savings are 

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:18.320
 the first lever to reduce 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:20.480
 the emission of greenhouse gases after 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.920
 the big appliance the commission 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.289
 European Union is now interested in 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.990
 small appliances and in particular to 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:28.189
 vacuum cleaners 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:31.419
 Europe currently has no less 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:33.469
 288 million of these devices 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:36.140
 the electricity consumption of 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:40.489
 vacuum cleaners generates 6.6 million 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:42.590
 tons of co2 which equates to 3.3 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:44.420

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:53.620
 the eco design project aims to reduce 

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:56.020
 the impact of its CO2 emissions to 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:58.660
 from 2014 the establishment of the 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:00.040
 ecodesign regulation will force the 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:03.340
 manufacturers to produce devices 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:04.869
 requiring less energy what impact 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:06.850
 on their performances 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:08.380
 many think that more power 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.990
 in watts is high better and 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:13.090
 the suction efficiency is not 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.159
 quite true over the last twenty 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:18.430
 years the wattage has doubled 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:21.340
 from 1000 watts in 1990 to 2000 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:25.509
 watts in 2010 suction efficiency 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:27.250
 as for it has evolved very little 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:28.840
 eco design project provides a limit 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.910
 maximum power for 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.100
 vacuum cleaners and sets a minimum level of 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:34.330
 suction performance 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.130
 performance is measured by 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.229
 the dedusting efficiency 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.030
 it is the percentage of dust 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:42.340
 suck after five round trips 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.560
 on a certain type of soil with 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.240
 the application of the eco design project a 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.890
 new energy label will be 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.810
 also set up for the products 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.869
 this label is based on six 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.369
 key information the efficiency class 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.319
 energy represented by a scale 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:58.450
 going from a for vacuum cleaners having 

00:01:56.319 --> 00:02:01.149
 low energy consumption older 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.190
 for a high energy consumption the 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:05.319
 annual energy consumption expressed 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:07.690
 in kilowatt hours the efficiency class 

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:11.470
 of dusting for carpets and 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:13.360
 carpets and solis stop emissions 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.510
 of dust at the outlet of the air the level 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.219
 sound in decibels 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:23.290
 rowenta has already anticipated this news 

00:02:18.219 --> 00:02:25.180
 regulation since 2011 in 2014 100% 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.370
 of our products will respect the new 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.249
 regulation and in some cases hiro 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.480
 even beyond 

00:02:29.249 --> 00:02:33.549
 together let's go to success with 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.799
 rowenta the high-end brand 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:39.299
