00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
never did a video about it but since I'm

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.900 
never did a video about it but since I'm
the<00:00:27.150> galaxy<00:00:27.630> s3<00:00:28.109> here<00:00:28.650> and<00:00:28.920> some<00:00:29.250> people<00:00:29.550> might

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
the galaxy s3 here and some people might

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.290 
the galaxy s3 here and some people might
want<00:00:30.210> a<00:00:30.420> stylus<00:00:31.130> for<00:00:32.130> their<00:00:32.309> device<00:00:32.610> so<00:00:33.180> they

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.050 
can play games like draw something I

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.660 
can play games like draw something I
decided<00:00:37.050> to<00:00:37.170> do<00:00:37.290> a<00:00:37.320> little<00:00:37.710> video<00:00:38.010> about<00:00:38.219> it

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
decided to do a little video about it

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.549 
decided to do a little video about it
this<00:00:38.940> is<00:00:39.030> actually<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.540> first<00:00:39.570> time<00:00:40.050> I've

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
this is actually the first time I've

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.350 
this is actually the first time I've
ever<00:00:41.540> done<00:00:42.540> this<00:00:42.809> um<00:00:43.520> let's<00:00:44.520> start<00:00:45.239> with

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
ever done this um let's start with

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.350 
ever done this um let's start with
something<00:00:45.600> easy<00:00:46.020> and<00:00:46.700> we're<00:00:47.700> going<00:00:47.879> to<00:00:47.910> for<00:00:48.329> a

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
something easy and we're going to for a

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.670 
something easy and we're going to for a
pencil<00:00:49.289> so<00:00:50.030> I'll<00:00:51.030> just<00:00:51.090> make<00:00:51.480> it<00:00:51.510> like<00:00:52.469> their

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
pencil so I'll just make it like their

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.830 
pencil so I'll just make it like their
little<00:00:52.890> icon<00:00:53.489> right<00:00:53.520> there<00:00:53.789> and<00:00:54.329> hopefully

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
little icon right there and hopefully

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.080 
little icon right there and hopefully
someone<00:00:55.680> will<00:00:55.710> be<00:00:55.890> able<00:00:55.920> to<00:00:56.219> figure<00:00:56.789> it<00:00:57.000> out

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
someone will be able to figure it out

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.439 
someone will be able to figure it out
see<00:00:57.960> this<00:00:58.199> has<00:00:58.379> a<00:00:58.410> round<00:00:59.190> tip<00:00:59.550> it's<00:00:59.850> not<00:01:00.090> really

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
see this has a round tip it's not really

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.160 
see this has a round tip it's not really
sharp<00:01:01.250> so<00:01:02.250> this<00:01:02.550> might<00:01:02.730> actually<00:01:02.940> be<00:01:03.329> a<00:01:03.600> little

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
sharp so this might actually be a little

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:11.179 
sharp so this might actually be a little
harder<00:01:04.589> than<00:01:04.799> you<00:01:04.920> think<00:01:06.799> to<00:01:07.799> produce<00:01:10.189> good

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
harder than you think to produce good

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.030 
harder than you think to produce good
drawings<00:01:11.790> using<00:01:12.750> this<00:01:13.500> particular<00:01:13.740> stylus

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.040 
drawings using this particular stylus

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.179 
drawings using this particular stylus
see<00:01:17.040> i'm<00:01:17.250> pretty<00:01:17.610> sure<00:01:17.970> i<00:01:18.000> could<00:01:18.390> have

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:19.189 
see i'm pretty sure i could have

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:23.929 
see i'm pretty sure i could have
controlled<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:22.310> thickness<00:01:23.310> of<00:01:23.340> this<00:01:23.610> line

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
controlled the thickness of this line

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:29.120 
controlled the thickness of this line
but<00:01:24.830> this<00:01:25.830> will<00:01:26.070> have<00:01:26.100> to<00:01:26.310> do<00:01:27.860> fill<00:01:28.860> it<00:01:29.009> in

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
but this will have to do fill it in

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.800 
but this will have to do fill it in
right<00:01:29.369> there<00:01:31.640> so<00:01:32.640> this<00:01:32.820> is<00:01:32.850> a<00:01:33.030> capacitive

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
right there so this is a capacitive

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.840 
right there so this is a capacitive
touch<00:01:34.140> stylus<00:01:34.530> and<00:01:36.140> that's<00:01:37.140> why<00:01:37.380> it<00:01:37.850> actually

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
touch stylus and that's why it actually

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.359 
touch stylus and that's why it actually
will<00:01:39.570> pass<00:01:39.840> your<00:01:40.530> input<00:01:41.720> into<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:42.810> screen

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:43.369 
will pass your input into the screen

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:47.749 
will pass your input into the screen
versus<00:01:44.600> the<00:01:45.600> old<00:01:45.750> Silas's<00:01:46.530> like<00:01:47.310> you<00:01:47.490> can't

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
versus the old Silas's like you can't

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.749 
versus the old Silas's like you can't
just<00:01:48.030> use<00:01:48.960> some<00:01:49.560> object<00:01:50.130> like<00:01:50.310> in<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.579> old

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
just use some object like in the old

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:57.020 
just use some object like in the old
days<00:01:50.880> just<00:01:51.450> to<00:01:52.790> push<00:01:53.790> on<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.149> screen<00:01:56.030> anyways

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
days just to push on the screen anyways

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.039 
days just to push on the screen anyways
let's<00:01:57.060> back<00:01:57.479> out<00:01:57.689> of<00:01:57.780> that<00:01:57.899> game<00:01:59.570> it<00:02:00.570> is<00:02:00.719> strong

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
let's back out of that game it is strong

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.850 
let's back out of that game it is strong
enough<00:02:01.170> to<00:02:01.469> push<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:01.920> home<00:02:02.579> button<00:02:03.860> you

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
enough to push the home button you

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.590 
enough to push the home button you
navigate<00:02:05.399> through<00:02:05.640> everything

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:08.600 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.710 

really<00:02:09.380> easily<00:02:09.790> now<00:02:10.790> let's<00:02:11.120> go<00:02:11.420> to<00:02:11.450> the

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
really easily now let's go to the

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:18.520 
really easily now let's go to the
built-in<00:02:12.110> memo<00:02:13.390> program<00:02:14.560> s<00:02:15.560> memo<00:02:16.930> and<00:02:17.930> there

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
built-in memo program s memo and there

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.680 
built-in memo program s memo and there
was<00:02:18.620> something<00:02:18.980> i<00:02:19.100> just<00:02:19.460> did<00:02:19.700> a<00:02:19.730> few<00:02:20.330> minutes

ago<00:02:22.030> let's<00:02:23.030> add<00:02:23.300> a<00:02:23.330> memo

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:50.900 

Sally<00:02:33.890> at<00:02:37.750> 5125<00:02:41.620> 555555
