objective is of doing that is to keep

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.490 
objective is of doing that is to keep
that<00:00:42.329> alive<00:00:42.480> so<00:00:43.170> it<00:00:43.230> goes<00:00:43.379> through

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
that alive so it goes through

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.279 
that alive so it goes through
generations<00:00:44.190> and<00:00:45.120> also<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.660> importance<00:00:46.140> of

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
generations and also the importance of

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:47.450 
generations and also the importance of
it<00:00:46.410> and<00:00:46.530> especially<00:00:46.800> with<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.070> farming

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
it and especially with the farming

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.830 
it and especially with the farming
industry<00:00:47.520> because<00:00:48.059> it<00:00:48.149> was<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.360> grassroots

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
industry because it was the grassroots

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.500 
industry because it was the grassroots
and<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.739> foundation<00:00:50.250> of<00:00:50.370> farming<00:00:50.789> was<00:00:51.149> using

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
and the foundation of farming was using

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.549 
and the foundation of farming was using
heavy<00:00:51.750> horse<00:00:52.070> so<00:00:53.070> what<00:00:53.910> we<00:00:54.090> try<00:00:54.480> to<00:00:54.510> do<00:00:55.140> is

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
heavy horse so what we try to do is

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.520 
heavy horse so what we try to do is
preserve<00:00:56.399> that<00:00:56.879> and<00:00:57.210> I<00:00:57.600> know<00:00:57.840> technology's

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
preserve that and I know technology's

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.459 
preserve that and I know technology's
moved<00:00:58.829> and<00:00:59.129> no<00:00:59.340> technology's<00:01:00.000> changed<00:01:00.660> a<00:01:00.960> lot

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
moved and no technology's changed a lot

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.319 
moved and no technology's changed a lot
of<00:01:01.530> things<00:01:01.680> within<00:01:02.039> farming<00:01:02.579> but<00:01:03.149> if<00:01:03.270> you

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
of things within farming but if you

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.660 
of things within farming but if you
don't<00:01:03.600> have<00:01:03.719> those<00:01:03.870> grass<00:01:04.229> roots<00:01:04.589> and<00:01:05.519> then

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
don't have those grass roots and then

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.450 
don't have those grass roots and then
you<00:01:06.090> lose<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.299> foundation<00:01:07.130> so<00:01:08.130> that's<00:01:08.310> what

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
you lose the foundation so that's what

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.100 
you lose the foundation so that's what
we<00:01:08.580> try<00:01:08.760> to<00:01:08.820> do<00:01:09.060> here<00:01:09.090> so<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.570> things<00:01:09.750> like<00:01:09.900> all

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
we try to do here so the things like all

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.830 
we try to do here so the things like all
the<00:01:10.320> skills<00:01:10.890> and<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.400> crafts<00:01:11.840> that

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
the skills and the crafts that

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.469 
the skills and the crafts that
surrounded<00:01:13.409> them<00:01:13.590> yes<00:01:14.159> some<00:01:14.549> of<00:01:14.580> them<00:01:14.790> you<00:01:15.330> may

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
surrounded them yes some of them you may

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.050 
surrounded them yes some of them you may
not<00:01:15.630> use<00:01:15.810> again<00:01:16.200> as<00:01:16.500> towards<00:01:17.490> with<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:17.880> horse

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
not use again as towards with the horse

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.760 
not use again as towards with the horse
on<00:01:18.210> and<00:01:18.360> with<00:01:18.450> working<00:01:18.900> life<00:01:19.080> but<00:01:19.530> there<00:01:19.650> can

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
on and with working life but there can

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:20.600 
on and with working life but there can
be<00:01:19.799> readapted

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
be readapted

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.880 
be readapted
for<00:01:21.150> modern-day<00:01:21.540> life<00:01:22.020> so<00:01:22.439> it's<00:01:22.560> keeping

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
for modern-day life so it's keeping

for modern-day life so it's keeping
those<00:01:22.979> alive<00:01:23.340> and<00:01:23.640> it's<00:01:23.759> keeping<00:01:23.970> things

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
those alive and it's keeping things

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.030 
those alive and it's keeping things
moving<00:01:24.270> long<00:01:24.600> even<00:01:25.530> though<00:01:25.590> you've<00:01:25.770> got<00:01:25.799> to

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
moving long even though you've got to

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.740 
moving long even though you've got to
shore<00:01:26.340> you<00:01:26.640> would<00:01:26.759> always<00:01:26.909> get<00:01:27.090> people<00:01:27.330> always

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
shore you would always get people always

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.510 
shore you would always get people always
like<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.470> heavies<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:29.040> way<00:01:29.130> I'll<00:01:29.340> have

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
like the heavies the way I'll have

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.580 
like the heavies the way I'll have
anything<00:01:29.970> to<00:01:30.240> do<00:01:30.360> with<00:01:30.390> horses<00:01:30.810> but<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.409> heavy

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
anything to do with horses but the heavy

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.410 
anything to do with horses but the heavy
horses<00:01:32.009> there<00:01:32.220> were<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.369> ones<00:01:32.549> and<00:01:33.240> I<00:01:33.390> think

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
horses there were the ones and I think

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.330 
horses there were the ones and I think
through<00:01:34.320> talking<00:01:34.770> with<00:01:34.799> people<00:01:35.189> it<00:01:35.250> was

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
through talking with people it was

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.670 
through talking with people it was
because<00:01:35.579> they<00:01:35.700> had<00:01:35.820> a<00:01:35.850> purpose<00:01:36.180> in<00:01:36.509> life<00:01:36.680> and

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
because they had a purpose in life and

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.620 
because they had a purpose in life and
people<00:01:37.890> recognized<00:01:38.490> them<00:01:38.700> flew<00:01:38.909> grandparents

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
people recognized them flew grandparents

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.090 
people recognized them flew grandparents
conversations<00:01:40.380> you<00:01:40.500> know<00:01:40.619> they're<00:01:40.799> the

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
conversations you know they're the

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.350 
conversations you know they're the
milkman<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.520> butcher<00:01:41.939> or<00:01:42.060> something<00:01:42.270> like

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
milkman the butcher or something like

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:43.969 
milkman the butcher or something like
that<00:01:42.420> used<00:01:42.689> to<00:01:42.840> deliver<00:01:43.200> with<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.500> horse<00:01:43.710> and

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
that used to deliver with the horse and

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.139 
that used to deliver with the horse and
there's<00:01:44.130> certainly<00:01:44.369> other<00:01:44.430> so<00:01:45.000> there's

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
there's certainly other so there's

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.929 
there's certainly other so there's
always<00:01:45.270> this<00:01:45.509> relationship<00:01:46.290> and<00:01:46.470> I<00:01:47.070> think<00:01:47.670> is

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
always this relationship and I think is

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.120 
always this relationship and I think is
well<00:01:48.090> on<00:01:48.270> a<00:01:48.299> visual<00:01:48.630> sight<00:01:49.500> I<00:01:49.740> mean<00:01:49.979> there's
