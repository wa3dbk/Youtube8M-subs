00:00:19.839 --> 00:00:21.960
 a job a family of five children 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.960
 and in the evening I said little alone to isolate myself a little 

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:29.689
 keda quietly walking a team piece 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:31.339
 and masseurs 

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:34.480
 it was created on wildlife that watchmakers 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.670
 she sells books so spare parts 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.670
 in the evening when his kids from school I was going to get him to his job 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.650
 and as I always arrived ten minutes fifteen minutes before I moved in and 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:45.970
 an established 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:48.960
 I panic salt over the year and I was having fun 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.160
 to make straight lines or make him 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.160
 tv5 the scouts 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:57.930
 the statement is maintained like that 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.930
 according to jacques rougerie 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.180
 at the same time the number of new parts in a movement is a little 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.750
 different different from one movement to another 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.100
 if it's a movement it's a little bit reduced 1,180 pieces on average 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.100
 and it goes up to 5,600 pieces 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.620
 al-zaidi small pieces on the watch in thickness the smallest that do 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:31.200
 one hundredth 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.270
 it hurts but it made me laugh a lot north still work 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.800
 all in all ten minutes it's clear 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.710
 it's not counting a reproduction environment movement like 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.030
 this one 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.770
 it does not take very long, however, to focus on a 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.770
 moment like that we can easily spend a year 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.820
 and often rudimentary have started a thigh ten times twenty times 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.110
 always but always doing the same things 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.280
 to make it a simple spring principle of three months 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.579
 I am the most 

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:07.579
 m the good shape of his fate 

00:02:12.579 --> 00:02:15.599
 of cotentin movement to say he is 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:18.809
 parties that are younger than other instrumentalists 

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:20.759
 and the most difficult part that you 

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:22.219
 to establish 

00:02:22.219 --> 00:02:24.449
 this is again 

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:27.449
 and the exchange balance are spiral 

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:31.509
 it is the heart of the primed of justice that gives life to the movement 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:35.909
 I prefer in the business atmosphere is to work on 

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:37.519
 complications 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:41.170
 it's a game of dixinn that's a bit complicated which big problem this 

00:02:41.169 --> 00:02:44.169
 regime well where I was posing 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:51.519
 so it's true that when we've been minimized to the point some pride 

00:02:52.249 --> 00:02:53.249
 staff 

00:02:53.249 --> 00:02:56.279
 because eat in a company everyone works everyone 

00:02:56.279 --> 00:02:57.139
 deserved 

00:02:57.139 --> 00:03:00.139
 no but it is true that we are very satisfied me personally I am 

00:03:00.139 --> 00:03:02.019
 happy when I found a solution 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:04.419
 for the movement between parents production 

00:03:04.419 --> 00:03:07.419
 he was turning canton 

00:03:10.169 --> 00:03:12.329
 so when we show them 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:15.169
 looking general ja ja the exterior aesthetics 

00:03:15.169 --> 00:03:18.249
 that's what makes the watch sell its target if it does not hurt a little heart 

00:03:18.249 --> 00:03:19.249
 ours 

00:03:19.249 --> 00:03:22.449
 maybe also applied to decorate a movement inside and often 

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:23.819
 not worth 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:25.439
 it hurts a bit 

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:28.419
 it hurts me all the more as it is a sign the whole heart of the man who 

00:03:28.419 --> 00:03:31.419
 is inside and have spoken again 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.079
 because it's true that in recent years 

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:37.039
 at the factory 

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:38.949
 like a lot of watchmakers 

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:42.269
 well here I ask to highlight its movements 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:45.779
 the guest designers franÃ§ois fillon which allows us to see the 

00:03:45.779 --> 00:03:47.169
 shop 

00:03:47.169 --> 00:03:50.169
 certain functions 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:06.650
 I'm horrified the mention that that of 186 passengers on the same passion and 

00:04:07.939 --> 00:04:09.329
 tonight will it stop today
