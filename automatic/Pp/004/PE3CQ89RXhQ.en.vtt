impact of aviation mainly we're talking
about<00:00:15.000> two<00:00:15.269> projects<00:00:15.780> a<00:00:15.840> first<00:00:16.080> project<00:00:16.590> type

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
about two projects a first project type

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.300 
about two projects a first project type
of<00:00:17.340> project<00:00:17.790> is<00:00:17.970> around<00:00:18.810> the<00:00:19.259> roots<00:00:19.500> and<00:00:19.740> the

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
of project is around the roots and the

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.370 
of project is around the roots and the
trajectory<00:00:20.490> around<00:00:21.119> the<00:00:21.689> airport<00:00:21.930> making

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
trajectory around the airport making

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.290 
trajectory around the airport making
them<00:00:22.529> shorter<00:00:22.950> and<00:00:23.160> more<00:00:23.759> efficient

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
them shorter and more efficient

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.900 
them shorter and more efficient
obviously<00:00:25.200> helps<00:00:25.470> in<00:00:25.619> noise<00:00:25.829> but<00:00:26.369> also<00:00:26.520> in

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
obviously helps in noise but also in

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.080 
obviously helps in noise but also in

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
the second type of projects we are

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.180 
the second type of projects we are
talking<00:00:32.850> about<00:00:32.940> is<00:00:33.480> around<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.800> delays

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
talking about is around the delays

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.190 
talking about is around the delays
whether<00:00:35.520> it's<00:00:35.730> on<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:35.880> ground<00:00:35.910> or<00:00:36.390> in<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:37.020> air

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
whether it's on the ground or in the air

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.270 
whether it's on the ground or in the air
we<00:00:37.769> can<00:00:37.949> reduce<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:39.149> number<00:00:39.420> of<00:00:39.449> delays<00:00:39.809> and

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.280 
we can reduce the number of delays and

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.340 
we can reduce the number of delays and
reducing<00:00:41.280> again<00:00:41.550> either<00:00:42.149> airborne<00:00:42.840> fuel<00:00:43.170> burn

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350
