00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:14.470
 the urethral stricture consists of the 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:18.580
 narrowing of the urethra 

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:21.310
 the urethra is the tube that allows us to 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:23.770
 We expel urine from the bladder 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:26.290
 towards the outside in the woman the urethra 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:29.560
 it's very short measures one centimeter and 

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:32.020
 half two drains into the vagina and not 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:34.000
 usually causes stenosis problems but in 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:36.790
 the male urethra is long because the 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.860
 form the penile or pendulous urethra 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:40.750
 vulvar urethra membrane is not prostatic 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:43.300
 so that we have a length 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.550
 important urethra and do not always count 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.290
 that some strains appear in the 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:49.960
 urethra that we medically 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:52.030
 we call stenosis the stenosis 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:55.780
 may appear secondary to 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:58.630
 bladder catheter type manipulations is 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:02.110
 for a traumatism a fall of a 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:05.970
 horse a motorcycle crash some blow and 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:07.980
 sometimes they appear without us getting 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.010
 and the process to which to attribute it then 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:12.630
 we call them idiopathic these 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.000
 narrowings in the urethra can be 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.120
 of greater or lesser length and of lesser or 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.980
 greater thickness and severity so that the 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:22.650
 treatment of urethral strictures 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:24.030
 it's a challenge for the urologist is a 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.220
 treatment to which most of the 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.980
 urologists are not used and they 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:33.530
 It requires a great experience to 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:37.320
 be able to treat this type of stenosis 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:39.600
 When the stenosis is short, it is a 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.310
 stenosis that is not important we can 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.200
 try through the urethra to enter 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.580
 with a camera and make an exception 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.710
 endoscopic so that is a 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.660
 simple procedure that does not usually 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.640
 have great complications but that 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:52.740
 often fails and reappears 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.780
 for the product and the cicatricial process 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.420
 a new narrowing a new stenosis 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.550
 that requires other procedures or 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.950
 sometimes the narrowness is so 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:03.930
 important that requires section of 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.880
 that urethral segment and make a 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.290
 our moses terminal term or in 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.660
 Sometimes it requires surgeries 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.450
 very complex reconstructive in which 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:15.030
 we proceed to take mucous from the mouth 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:17.959
 to produce to produce a graft 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:21.360
 inside that urethra to be able to beat and 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:24.150
 return a good caliber a good step to 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:27.690
 that tube that has to take out the urethra 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:29.220
 of the bladder the urine of the bladder in 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.080
 other occasions we take grafts 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.390
 film two free grafts and it's 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.489
 important to have a very good handling of 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:37.260
 all the reconstructive surgery for 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:41.180
 to be able to provide the best solutions and 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.180
 less traumatic to our patients
