00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:07.210

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:11.780
 make day 

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:13.370
 that's a great thing for the back 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:15.019
 julia is sitting and camera is also the 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:16.369
 own youtube channel so there could be 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:19.250
 also look at the bottom 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:21.260
 i'm laying your elbow and yes 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:33.560
 I have a few questions about mine 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:35.930
 dog yes i start now what was yours 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:38.989
 first pet and his name there 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.610
 think now so we had earlier 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:45.440
 So as countries we had before 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:50.620
 always dogs and domestic pigs so not 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:53.449
 so exciting and more of a hamster 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.859
 or birds but I think so fulfilled 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:58.460
 my birds i had when they were 

00:00:54.859 --> 00:01:00.109
 here and this beep and we have it 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.429
 somehow summer but I have with 

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:04.940
 my hamster called because it 

00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:07.490
 somehow not quite so 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:09.380
 he hates it or wanted it 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.290
 a family wish as my mother 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:19.960
 nobody really wanted to have one 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:22.630
 but I wanted to against the 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:25.810
 he still lives or is going to be her 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.409
 died because I'm so birthday 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.060
 died 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:29.860
 the birds are alive after the birds are 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:33.640
 with a known one of us is quite a 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:39.580
 beautiful bird would be your favorite animal 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:45.060
 my favorite animal and I was am 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:45.060
 so for me just so kokoska now 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.540
 So the rasters advised 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.720
 Do you have pets now? If so, how 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:05.770
 many and what are their names? 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:07.869
 she's just gone somewhere else now 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.869
 I have another hobby has its six 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:13.530
 your name a special meaning 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:15.670
 So that was my mother wanted coco 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.709
 So actually it was before it was 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:23.110
 A very efficient means you always catch 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:26.260
 with so on abo is the first of one 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:29.320
 bitch and then come abc and d and gis 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:33.750
 before I copy it totally 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:33.750
 nice but better 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:45.970
 So then what was protecting her that was 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:55.090
 picked up about two years ago 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:56.610
 Almost caring next to eight 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.050
 have to 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:02.040
 no, so she lied always comes back 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:03.730
 us back because you are a very loyal 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.860
 Would you like more pets? 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.630
 to have 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.610
 So I think co so you have to 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:12.880
 say the field is it really was 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:15.610
 they are all around but you have to 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.500
 I would think so now myself 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.870
 Not easy because you do not stop then 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.160
 so can go on vacation if you can 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.680
 someone has to take care 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:26.620
 That or you can with the dog you can 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.360
 yes you still take tenth you will find 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:32.110
 are satire from the breeder or the 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:36.580
 animal shelter where my father he has an animal 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:38.140
 a dog from the shelter and you notice 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:40.300
 sometimes in the halt, so to speak the 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:41.740
 history what is behind and the 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.990
 were then mostly beaten 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:45.580
 or neglected and so on and you 

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:49.060
 it has totally changed and coco is now 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:51.010
 from a breeder and there you realize it 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.800
 not now so you just realize that 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:58.510
 they would be totally under tour groups 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:04:01.270
 States grew up and you notice 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:03.070
 it in character in all cases but me 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:05.110
 think it's the same when you look at yourself 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:06.940
 in love with his dog and then 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:08.440
 also the character corresponds 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:09.820
 maybe a proberunde with those 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:13.420
 that was possible with us earlier 

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:15.790
 so when we got there with so 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:17.080
 the dog from the shelter and there if 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:18.730
 I have to get used to it the dog 

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:19.960
 but one I'm always one must 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:21.790
 to say it is allowed in the ads 

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:23.330
 me about him also to his little ones 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:25.680
 has had 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:27.780
 are just from the shelter on wisdom 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:31.229
 actually almost never where from 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:33.630
 come from which circles say now 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:37.280
 the last question how much presence has 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:39.419
 an animal in your life to your heart 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:42.210
 I would say a lot 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:43.710
 so i am totally so coco me time 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:46.199
 could no toko has nothing to 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:48.389
 it is always said that way 

00:04:46.199 --> 00:04:50.370
 unbelievable so i miss them too 

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:51.840
 totally when I'm on vacation and she 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:54.060
 then stay with my mother and then 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:56.310
 also is really blatant than that 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:57.900
 animal then animal coco then or sets 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:00.150
 a dog or a cat does not know 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:02.220
 had and totally at the then totally 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:03.479
 then you can not heart 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:06.570
 more without that and I believe the child 

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:09.690
 your house and yes in any case completely 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:11.789
 a lot of space in my heart animals 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:13.770
 Generally I hope you have it 

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:14.910
 again you have pets if 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:16.699
 yes then you can do it in the 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:19.530
 Write comments 

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:25.070
 and what animals for you in your life 

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:25.070
 mean and a lot of fun doing
