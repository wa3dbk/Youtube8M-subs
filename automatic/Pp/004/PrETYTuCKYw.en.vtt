00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
hard for them especially if you have a

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:04.000 
hard for them especially if you have a
man<00:03:01.340> up<00:03:01.580> they<00:03:02.180> can't<00:03:02.450> even<00:03:02.690> attack<00:03:03.530> do<00:03:03.710> it<00:03:03.830> they

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
man up they can't even attack do it they

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:05.680 
man up they can't even attack do it they
just<00:03:04.160> first<00:03:04.400> strike<00:03:04.610> it<00:03:04.790> and<00:03:04.970> then<00:03:05.060> it's<00:03:05.210> other

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:05.690 
just first strike it and then it's other

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:07.090 
just first strike it and then it's other
creature<00:03:06.080> that's<00:03:06.290> funny<00:03:06.530> as<00:03:06.620> most<00:03:06.800> people<00:03:07.040> are

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.100

creature that's funny as most people are
really<00:03:07.250> excited<00:03:07.430> about<00:03:07.550> playing<00:03:07.820> this<00:03:07.940> part

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
really excited about playing this part

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.150 
really excited about playing this part
in<00:03:08.480> those<00:03:08.780> archetype<00:03:09.230> right<00:03:09.470> they<00:03:10.010> ever

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
in those archetype right they ever

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.380 
in those archetype right they ever
really<00:03:10.280> I<00:03:10.370> guess<00:03:10.610> thought<00:03:10.790> about<00:03:11.000> how<00:03:11.120> good<00:03:11.300> it

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390 
really I guess thought about how good it

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:13.090 
really I guess thought about how good it
is<00:03:11.450> against<00:03:11.930> those<00:03:12.080> are<00:03:12.260> kids<00:03:12.410> day<00:03:12.800> I<00:03:12.830> getting

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
your auger in polis and some of the

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.720 
very specific exact
okay<00:04:08.590> well<00:04:08.830> how'd<00:04:09.220> you<00:04:09.340> start<00:04:09.489> off<00:04:09.580> the

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:09.730 
okay well how'd you start off the

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:11.490 
okay well how'd you start off the
tournament<00:04:10.090> like<00:04:10.420> out<00:04:10.599> I<00:04:10.750> was<00:04:10.930> 10<00:04:11.110> played

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500 
tournament like out I was 10 played

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.650 
tournament like out I was 10 played
against<00:04:11.680> the<00:04:11.739> poor<00:04:11.890> else<00:04:12.040> deck<00:04:12.250> so<00:04:13.090> starting

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:13.660 
against the poor else deck so starting

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:14.699 
against the poor else deck so starting
off<00:04:13.720> good<00:04:13.900> and<00:04:13.959> I<00:04:14.050> guess<00:04:14.200> my<00:04:14.319> strategy<00:04:14.650> is

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:14.709 
off good and I guess my strategy is

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:15.990 
off good and I guess my strategy is
working<00:04:14.739> for<00:04:15.069> now<00:04:15.160> did<00:04:15.550> we<00:04:15.580> give<00:04:15.790> him<00:04:15.910> a

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000
