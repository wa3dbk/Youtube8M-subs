00:00:00.919 --> 00:00:04.470
 Mönchengladbach receives in the sold-out borussia park against 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.680
 Leader Borussia Dortmund 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:11.469
 on paper a clear last thing against first the home weakest team 

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:13.619
 against the strongest 

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:17.300
 The last six matches were not won by Borussia from Gladbach 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.520
 the Borussia from Dortmund has the championship to grasp 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.750
 the guests in yellow-black with the first chance and in minute 1 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:28.399
 Piszczek 

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:31.399
 but the inventor 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.470
 in ten minutes the next pies of opportunity and again it is Mario 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:38.380
 idol 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:41.380
 Gladbach keeper ter Stegen directs the ball 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:51.340
 played half an hour further at the Gladbacher Marco Reus 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.210
 and here's what it's made of 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.650
 the lead for the table last 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:00.650
 bvb-coach Klopp not satisfied until here 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.650
 in the 30th he was at or reason to cheer Lewandowski 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.030
 the Leipzig area understands 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.020
 free path to the gate 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.020
 like to be clear on the line 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.500
 the 35 minutes Dortmund lose the ball 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.070
 in the house building 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.070
 SID Idris Hourle 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.970
 sees this goal brings the bottom of the table against the 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.240
 Leaders to the front 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.070
 one to zero meant for humans 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:42.070
 this in the fifth goal of the season 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:52.160
 Dortmund's injured director to lay at break is his team 0 1 back 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.640
 BVB pushes Gladbach but with the next chance, especially in children 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.110
 with an own goal 65 minutes are already played there 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.110
 the Dortmunderin is running out of time 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.170
 68 she had a minute now for BVB 

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:14.509
 and again the duel Götze v Sierre rose 

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:19.399
 statistics 

00:02:19.399 --> 00:02:23.629
 no team in the league has so much bad luck with posts and laths like that 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:26.629
 BVB 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:29.979
 Play on a goal that the sound 

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:32.979
 76 min 

00:02:35.899 --> 00:02:38.399
 it's still at the fingertips 

00:02:38.399 --> 00:02:41.399
 Chabon as the post the gate for the guests 

00:02:41.919 --> 00:02:44.919
 this negates 

00:02:46.749 --> 00:02:49.819
 another three minutes she offered Fitch 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:51.819
 With 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:53.589
 ter Stegen has reached approx 

00:02:53.589 --> 00:02:56.589
 these two still the fists 3 

00:02:57.699 --> 00:03:02.109
 it remains at the 1 2 0 Mönchengladbach Schleck Dortmund for the first time since 

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:06.339
 four and a half years and gives the red lantern in the table 

00:03:06.339 --> 00:03:09.709
 the BVD awards the first match ball in terms of championship 

00:03:11.139 --> 00:03:13.049
 who should pay more 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:16.319
 not so good our thing played through our football he played with 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:20.709
 Lotte better scoring opportunities for the first time since Sunday and so he does not always find 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:22.559
 could and still 1 0 

00:03:22.559 --> 00:03:26.729
 Commenda two consultants the perfect place to make second part not-op Volendam 

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:29.929
 again a bit of bad luck do not make the things in and if that's the case 

00:03:29.929 --> 00:03:32.220
 Game 1 0 because some especially for 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.279
 a what's so long time percent turn back 

00:03:35.279 --> 00:03:36.599
 table 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:38.849
 in the relegation battle 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:41.869
 come to the shocked here in the end for the telecom what wants and if you 

00:03:41.869 --> 00:03:45.939
 The league leaders are about to become percent with the champions 

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:49.319
 Hammerle should say one should continue to play on feature films 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:52.849
 Gives us the opportunity to prepare for the game and to be able to 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:57.719
 so is football in its possible points are picked 

00:03:58.399 --> 00:04:01.179
 individual lay and at 

00:04:01.179 --> 00:04:04.499
 But as the animals have to balance this has not been achieved 

00:04:05.189 --> 00:04:08.059
 something like that is not important to me, nothing has happened
