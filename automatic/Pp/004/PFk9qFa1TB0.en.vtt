00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
monitor its really good for DSLR filming

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.800 
monitor its really good for DSLR filming
this<00:01:43.799> is<00:01:43.920> very<00:01:44.100> light<00:01:44.280> 6<00:01:44.700> LP<00:01:45.000> 6<00:01:45.299> batteries<00:01:45.450> I

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
this is very light 6 LP 6 batteries I

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.080 
this is very light 6 LP 6 batteries I
think<00:01:46.799> this<00:01:46.890> is<00:01:46.979> one<00:01:47.100> of<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.250> coolest<00:01:47.610> uses<00:01:47.969> of

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
think this is one of the coolest uses of

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.450 
think this is one of the coolest uses of
this<00:01:48.210> cage<00:01:48.469> because<00:01:49.469> you<00:01:49.560> have<00:01:49.710> this<00:01:49.799> this<00:01:50.100> rod

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
this cage because you have this this rod

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.819 
this cage because you have this this rod
here<00:01:50.700> to<00:01:50.820> build<00:01:50.969> a<00:01:51.060> mount<00:01:51.240> things<00:01:51.450> on<00:01:51.680> will<00:01:52.680> do

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
here to build a mount things on will do

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.920 
here to build a mount things on will do
very<00:01:52.979> simply<00:01:53.369> let's<00:01:53.789> just<00:01:54.030> screw<00:01:54.270> this<00:01:54.420> screw

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
very simply let's just screw this screw

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.990 
very simply let's just screw this screw
the<00:01:55.140> monitor<00:01:55.439> on

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.180 

so<00:01:58.660> with<00:01:58.780> the<00:01:58.840> articulating<00:01:59.380> arm<00:01:59.530> and<00:01:59.740> the<00:01:59.980> low

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:00.190 
so with the articulating arm and the low

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:02.370 
so with the articulating arm and the low
mounting<00:02:00.640> position<00:02:01.030> you<00:02:01.750> can<00:02:01.870> actually<00:02:02.020> move

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
mounting position you can actually move

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.010 
mounting position you can actually move
the<00:02:02.440> ball<00:02:02.860> joint<00:02:03.160> just<00:02:03.340> like<00:02:03.490> this<00:02:03.640> and

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
the ball joint just like this and

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.310 
the ball joint just like this and
tighten<00:02:05.020> it<00:02:05.050> down

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.320 
tighten it down

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.790 
tighten it down
and<00:02:05.820> because<00:02:06.820> the<00:02:07.330> quick<00:02:07.540> cage<00:02:07.690> offers<00:02:08.170> is

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 
and because the quick cage offers is

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.220 
and because the quick cage offers is
really<00:02:09.040> great<00:02:09.190> low<00:02:09.460> mounting<00:02:09.880> points<00:02:10.149> you<00:02:11.110> can

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
really great low mounting points you can

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.440 
really great low mounting points you can
actually<00:02:11.350> mount<00:02:11.710> the<00:02:12.100> monitor<00:02:12.580> in<00:02:12.910> the<00:02:13.270> place

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.450 
actually mount the monitor in the place

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:14.820 
actually mount the monitor in the place
of<00:02:13.600> the<00:02:13.690> camera<00:02:13.960> monitor<00:02:14.260> now<00:02:14.410> this<00:02:14.560> is<00:02:14.680> great

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
of the camera monitor now this is great

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.230 
of the camera monitor now this is great
because<00:02:14.950> this<00:02:15.070> focus<00:02:15.430> peaking<00:02:15.580> zebras

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.240 
because this focus peaking zebras

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.210 
because this focus peaking zebras
different<00:02:17.110> scopes<00:02:17.410> and<00:02:17.590> things<00:02:17.770> like<00:02:17.890> that<00:02:18.040> so

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
different scopes and things like that so

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.640 
different scopes and things like that so
actually<00:02:18.550> well<00:02:19.020> but<00:02:20.020> if<00:02:20.080> you<00:02:20.170> can<00:02:20.290> hold<00:02:20.530> it

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
actually well but if you can hold it

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.200 
actually well but if you can hold it
just<00:02:20.920> like<00:02:21.040> this<00:02:21.160> to<00:02:21.640> be<00:02:21.730> able<00:02:21.790> to<00:02:21.970> use<00:02:22.090> the

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:22.210 
just like this to be able to use the

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:24.090 
just like this to be able to use the
camera<00:02:22.510> and<00:02:22.720> again<00:02:23.110> you<00:02:23.320> have<00:02:23.470> this<00:02:23.590> rail<00:02:23.830> here

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
camera and again you have this rail here

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.560 
camera and again you have this rail here
to<00:02:24.370> be<00:02:24.460> able<00:02:24.580> to<00:02:24.670> hold<00:02:24.790> on<00:02:24.910> to<00:02:25.030> very<00:02:25.210> securely

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:25.570 
to be able to hold on to very securely

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:27.480 
to be able to hold on to very securely
so<00:02:26.140> you<00:02:26.230> can<00:02:26.380> shoot<00:02:26.620> just<00:02:26.890> about<00:02:27.310> eye<00:02:27.460> level

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:27.490 
so you can shoot just about eye level

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:29.400 
so you can shoot just about eye level
just<00:02:27.940> like<00:02:28.030> that<00:02:28.180> another<00:02:28.930> piece<00:02:29.110> of<00:02:29.260> view

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
just like that another piece of view

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:30.600 
just like that another piece of view

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 
gonna raise up the monitor just so we

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:06.600 
gonna raise up the monitor just so we
can<00:03:05.470> tighten<00:03:05.680> it<00:03:05.800> a<00:03:05.860> little<00:03:06.010> bit<00:03:06.130> better<00:03:06.250> it's

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
can tighten it a little bit better it's

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:07.860 
can tighten it a little bit better it's
a<00:03:06.640> nice<00:03:06.760> part<00:03:06.970> about<00:03:07.000> the<00:03:07.180> articulating<00:03:07.690> arms

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
a nice part about the articulating arms

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.900 
a nice part about the articulating arms
gives<00:03:08.350> you<00:03:08.410> a<00:03:08.440> lot<00:03:08.530> of<00:03:08.560> options<00:03:08.820> you're<00:03:09.820> gonna
