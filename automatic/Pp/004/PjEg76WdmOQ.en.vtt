00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:57.670 
for everyone if you understand what to

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.969 
for everyone if you understand what to
expect<00:00:58.239> and<00:00:58.449> what<00:00:58.629> to<00:00:58.809> expect<00:00:59.170> out<00:00:59.319> of<00:00:59.709> the

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.380 
it traditionally so there's nothing

ten unit building and that's a great
place<00:01:33.730> to<00:01:33.760> start<00:01:34.240> it<00:01:34.660> gives<00:01:34.870> you<00:01:34.960> the

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.110 
place to start it gives you the

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.320 
place to start it gives you the
opportunity<00:01:35.740> to<00:01:35.770> understand<00:01:36.460> like<00:01:36.730> what<00:01:37.180> it

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:37.330 
opportunity to understand like what it

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.390 
opportunity to understand like what it
is<00:01:37.480> to<00:01:37.600> have<00:01:37.750> ten<00:01:38.080> units<00:01:38.440> under<00:01:38.620> a<00:01:38.710> single<00:01:39.070> roof

is to have ten units under a single roof

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.360 
is to have ten units under a single roof

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:42.370 
instead of ten units under ten roofs you

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:45.150 
instead of ten units under ten roofs you
start<00:01:42.910> to<00:01:43.000> understand<00:01:43.540> that<00:01:43.780> there's<00:01:44.620> systems

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:45.160 
start to understand that there's systems

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.010 
start to understand that there's systems
that<00:01:45.340> can<00:01:45.490> be<00:01:45.520> put<00:01:45.760> into<00:01:45.880> place<00:01:46.210> that<00:01:46.240> takes<00:01:46.750> a

investing<00:02:44.769> in<00:02:44.859> apartment<00:02:45.310> buildings<00:02:45.639> you'll

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
investing in apartment buildings you'll

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.720 
investing in apartment buildings you'll
see<00:02:46.329> everything<00:02:47.319> that<00:02:47.440> you<00:02:47.530> do<00:02:47.769> is<00:02:48.010> a<00:02:48.069> system

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
see everything that you do is a system

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:51.539 
see everything that you do is a system
that<00:02:48.760> you<00:02:48.970> create<00:02:49.389> so<00:02:49.989> for<00:02:50.260> example<00:02:50.889> on<00:02:51.340> the

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:51.549 
that you create so for example on the

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:54.030 
that you create so for example on the
first<00:02:51.760> of<00:02:52.000> the<00:02:52.060> month<00:02:52.359> rents<00:02:53.049> are<00:02:53.200> due<00:02:53.379> right

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
first of the month rents are due right

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.849 
first of the month rents are due right
and<00:02:54.430> if<00:02:54.970> you<00:02:55.329> have<00:02:55.359> a<00:02:55.629> four<00:02:56.019> degrees<00:02:56.379> period

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:56.859 
and if you have a four degrees period

00:02:56.859 --> 00:02:58.860 
and if you have a four degrees period
and<00:02:57.099> that<00:02:57.129> means<00:02:57.879> rents<00:02:58.209> are<00:02:58.329> due<00:02:58.480> no<00:02:58.840> later

and that means rents are due no later

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.399 
and that means rents are due no later
than<00:02:59.230> the<00:02:59.500> fifth<00:02:59.859> at<00:03:00.189> 5:00<00:03:00.609> p.m.<00:03:00.939> you<00:03:01.930> have<00:03:02.139> ten

than the fifth at 5:00 p.m. you have ten

going okay
but<00:03:47.079> when<00:03:47.199> you<00:03:47.260> have<00:03:47.409> ten<00:03:47.620> units<00:03:47.919> under<00:03:48.040> one

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
but when you have ten units under one

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.059 
but when you have ten units under one
building<00:03:48.609> that's<00:03:48.729> so<00:03:49.060> much<00:03:49.269> easier<00:03:49.720> to<00:03:49.870> do

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:50.069 
building that's so much easier to do

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:52.289 
building that's so much easier to do
likewise<00:03:51.069> now<00:03:51.310> let's<00:03:51.489> say<00:03:51.639> you've<00:03:51.849> done<00:03:51.879> ten

00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:52.299 
likewise now let's say you've done ten

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:53.640 
likewise now let's say you've done ten
units<00:03:52.629> and<00:03:52.780> you're<00:03:52.900> feeling<00:03:53.199> pretty<00:03:53.349> good<00:03:53.590> you

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
units and you're feeling pretty good you

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.050 
units and you're feeling pretty good you
understand<00:03:54.310> what<00:03:54.519> it<00:03:54.609> is<00:03:54.699> to<00:03:54.760> have<00:03:54.970> an

progression to move into 20 30 and 50

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.780 
progression to move into 20 30 and 50
units<00:04:07.599> because<00:04:08.229> the<00:04:08.409> systems<00:04:08.859> are<00:04:09.099> exactly

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:09.790 
units because the systems are exactly
