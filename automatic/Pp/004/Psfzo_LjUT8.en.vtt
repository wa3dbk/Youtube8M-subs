00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.340
 everyone from the blahnik march all are 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:27.279
 still focused on learning to use 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:29.140
 at best the new power units and to put 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:30.789
 the strategies for using the 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:32.500
 electrical power supplied by 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:35.440
 recuperators the car improves 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:38.379
 slowly but continuously to erez 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:41.050
 in the first test we are limited to trying 

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:42.940
 all systems while in the two 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:52.239
 sessions in bahrain we worked 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:54.910
 as if we were in these three sessions 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:57.190
 test we learned to manage the 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:59.620
 power unit and to evaluate its interaction 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.039
 with all the other components of the 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.920
 car 

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:11.830
 because only the track gives you a way to do 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:13.630
 this querelle and viani since melbourne 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:16.500
 we will see very different races 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:18.970
 compared to 2013 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:22.119
 reliability will be a key factor 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:24.130
 given the complexity of the cars and yes 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:26.979
 will add normal aerodynamic development 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:30.459
 to which we were already used to the topic 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:31.840
 young minds, little gem, now clear 

00:01:30.459 --> 00:01:34.720
 that the key element of the season 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.220
 will be the new power train and all the 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.520
 work to optimize performance 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:44.050
 both in qualifying and in the race in white 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:46.149
 lies on certain tracks we should understand how 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:49.179
 to save fuel e 

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:50.860
 consume as little as possible to succeed in 

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:52.739
 doing it well can have great effects 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.030
 on the final result 

00:01:52.739 --> 00:01:57.179
 we can use fuel for 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.380
 produce energy through the turbo 

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:01.629
 we are and put it right away 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.550
 broadcast or save it for when there 

00:02:01.629 --> 00:02:06.700
 serves the complexity of this new one 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:08.709
 drive unit is huge to find the right one 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.780
 combination of engine power a 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:12.190
 electric power saving 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.959
 fuel is our main 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.959
 goal in view of the race 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.010
 to new haven 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.600
 among the innovations introduced in 2014 on 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.190
 propeller certainly has a role to 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.900
 observed special both for the 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.970
 operation complexity than for 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:35.840
 the obligation of lower consumption than 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:37.760
 to the engines of last season with the 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.130
 terrone power unit and is indicated 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:44.000
 the set of the following components the 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:48.380
 endothermic engine v6 1,600 cc the 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.660
 herz system which is composed of mg km gvh 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.500
 battery pack and electronics of 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:58.940
 control 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:03:01.520
 unity steve jobs shift and the cars of 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:03.320
 formula 1 2014 are equipped with engines ad 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:05.239
 very high efficiency they consume approximately 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.860
 40 percent less than the 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:09.590
 eight cylinders of 2013 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.840
 despite having very similar performance, yes 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.390
 these are units that consume 40 liters 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:21.230
 for 100 km very much but little for 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:23.030
 a thruster from charlotte the 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:25.430
 regulation this season defines 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:27.530
 two consumption limits are in fact 100 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.660
 kg in maximum load of gasoline that each 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.940
 car can board while it is set 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:34.010
 in the same threshold of 100 kg then 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:36.560
 check the flow rate from the sensors 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:37.700
 maximum over the 10.500 rpm range 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.049
 per minute 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:42.950
 this to limit the flow of 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:44.510
 fuel and curb the performance of the 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:45.709
 consumption will be one of the key issues 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.299
 this season 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:49.730
 you will need to save fuel 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:51.980
 developing a specific strategy 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:54.110
 different depending on the race phases 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:56.239
 thanks to the presence of the recoverers of 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:57.950
 energy and reducing the performance of the 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:00.010
 engine you can save 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:02.570
 fuel 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:03.160
 I'm sure all the teams are a lot 

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:04.990
 get ready 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:07.030
 first in the first races because that's all 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:09.010
 new for all we could see someone 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:11.410
 forced to turn more slowly for 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:14.890
 finish the race 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:16.810
 Modena is more than ever pilots will have to 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:18.940
 pay attention to the management of 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:20.350
 power in the race and give a lot of attention to the 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:22.720
 indications that will come from the wall 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:23.980
 and from those who fine-tune the strategy on 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.440
 tank is placed in position 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:27.910
 central behind the pilot and why 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.950
 that is the safest part of the 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:31.900
 car is because the position in which 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:32.320
 affects less on the balance of the 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.030
 car 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.620
 if it were not central it could be 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:37.480
 take the risk of finding yourself in 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:41.800
 start or end of the race with a car has 

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:43.570
 strongly unbalanced and also 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.190
 this year it will be necessary to save a 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:48.300
 gasoline sample to deliver to 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:48.300
 daughter for checks
