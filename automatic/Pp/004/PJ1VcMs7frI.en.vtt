00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:30.920 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.850 

you<00:00:31.920> know<00:00:32.480> so<00:00:33.480> basic<00:00:33.750> beam<00:00:33.989> what<00:00:34.469> more<00:00:34.649> can<00:00:34.770> I

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
you know so basic beam what more can I

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:35.930 
you know so basic beam what more can I
say<00:00:34.890> in<00:00:35.130> that<00:00:35.250> really<00:00:35.399> if<00:00:35.550> you<00:00:35.610> just<00:00:35.640> took<00:00:35.820> over

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
say in that really if you just took over

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.650 
say in that really if you just took over
the<00:00:36.210> can<00:00:37.079> see<00:00:37.230> my<00:00:37.469> numbers<00:00:37.800> go<00:00:37.920> up<00:00:38.420> all<00:00:39.420> over

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660

the can see my numbers go up all over
the<00:00:39.780> board<00:00:39.960> really<00:00:40.320> um<00:00:40.620> I<00:00:41.040> don't<00:00:41.309> think

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
the board really um I don't think

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.280 
the board really um I don't think
there's<00:00:41.700> an<00:00:42.210> exercise<00:00:42.450> in<00:00:42.870> which<00:00:42.989> I<00:00:43.110> didn't

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290
