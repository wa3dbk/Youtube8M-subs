00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:21.960 

you

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:21.970 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:27.100 

so<00:00:23.740> hello<00:00:24.740> this<00:00:25.100> is<00:00:25.210> the<00:00:26.210> wide<00:00:26.450> jump<00:00:26.720> short

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:27.110 
so hello this is the wide jump short

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:30.430 
so hello this is the wide jump short
version<00:00:27.430> this<00:00:28.430> is<00:00:28.730> a<00:00:28.810> dedicated<00:00:29.810> jumps<00:00:30.380> pool

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:30.440 
version this is a dedicated jumps pool

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:34.000 
version this is a dedicated jumps pool
which<00:00:31.310> holds<00:00:31.699> 25<00:00:32.180> meters<00:00:32.599> of<00:00:32.750> line<00:00:32.960> and<00:00:33.289> it

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.010 
which holds 25 meters of line and it

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.010 
which holds 25 meters of line and it
simplifies<00:00:34.399> the<00:00:34.640> whole<00:00:34.969> task<00:00:35.300> of<00:00:35.600> making<00:00:35.809> a

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:36.020 
simplifies the whole task of making a

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.470 
simplifies the whole task of making a
job<00:00:36.289> so<00:00:36.980> usually<00:00:37.430> when<00:00:37.640> you<00:00:37.789> jump<00:00:38.059> you<00:00:38.210> need<00:00:38.329> to

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:38.480 
job so usually when you jump you need to

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.600 
job so usually when you jump you need to
mark<00:00:39.140> with<00:00:39.379> an<00:00:39.500> arrow<00:00:39.710> the<00:00:39.920> direction<00:00:40.220> of<00:00:40.430> the

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:40.610 
mark with an arrow the direction of the

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:42.940 
mark with an arrow the direction of the
exit<00:00:40.970> and<00:00:41.149> then<00:00:41.570> attaches<00:00:42.110> pull<00:00:42.380> to<00:00:42.620> the<00:00:42.649> arrow

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:42.950 
exit and then attaches pull to the arrow

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:47.049 
exit and then attaches pull to the arrow
and<00:00:43.460> connect<00:00:43.970> the<00:00:44.120> two<00:00:44.360> main<00:00:45.110> line<00:00:46.059> template

00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:47.059 
and connect the two main line template

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:49.889 
and connect the two main line template
the<00:00:47.239> main<00:00:47.690> line<00:00:47.840> with<00:00:47.989> temporary<00:00:48.320> line<00:00:48.680> so<00:00:49.520> you

00:00:49.889 --> 00:00:49.899 
the main line with temporary line so you

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:53.160 
the main line with temporary line so you
in<00:00:50.899> this<00:00:51.680> version<00:00:51.890> can<00:00:52.219> remove<00:00:52.520> the<00:00:52.730> arrow

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.170 
in this version can remove the arrow

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.780 
in this version can remove the arrow
which<00:00:54.170> is<00:00:54.380> a<00:00:54.410> very<00:00:54.620> high<00:00:54.860> quality<00:00:55.070> material

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:55.790 
which is a very high quality material

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:58.090 
which is a very high quality material
thicker<00:00:56.090> which<00:00:56.450> would<00:00:56.660> not<00:00:56.870> break<00:00:57.170> and<00:00:57.530> also

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100 
thicker which would not break and also

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.450 
thicker which would not break and also
the<00:00:58.219> design<00:00:58.610> allows<00:00:58.969> for<00:00:59.000> fast<00:00:59.540> connection<00:01:00.110> on

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:00.460 
the design allows for fast connection on

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.729 
the design allows for fast connection on
different<00:01:01.460> thickness<00:01:01.820> lines<00:01:02.469> then<00:01:03.469> as<00:01:03.620> you

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:03.739 
different thickness lines then as you

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:07.840 
different thickness lines then as you
pull<00:01:03.980> that<00:01:04.159> out<00:01:04.689> on<00:01:05.689> the<00:01:06.590> spool<00:01:06.890> you<00:01:07.159> have<00:01:07.340> our

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
pull that out on the spool you have our

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.810 
pull that out on the spool you have our
wide<00:01:08.360> arrow<00:01:08.689> rod<00:01:09.170> which<00:01:09.979> you<00:01:10.159> can<00:01:10.340> hold<00:01:10.549> very

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
wide arrow rod which you can hold very

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.210 
wide arrow rod which you can hold very
tight<00:01:11.119> and<00:01:11.390> then<00:01:11.930> the<00:01:12.110> spool<00:01:12.320> can<00:01:12.530> slide<00:01:12.950> onto

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.220 
tight and then the spool can slide onto

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.740 
tight and then the spool can slide onto
us<00:01:13.549> it's<00:01:14.510> very<00:01:14.659> easy<00:01:15.020> to<00:01:15.560> do<00:01:15.860> it<00:01:15.979> with<00:01:16.159> gloves

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:16.750 
us it's very easy to do it with gloves

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.850 
us it's very easy to do it with gloves
and<00:01:17.750> you<00:01:18.049> connect<00:01:18.590> the<00:01:18.710> two<00:01:19.299> permanent<00:01:20.299> lines

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:20.860 
and you connect the two permanent lines

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.410 
and you connect the two permanent lines
and<00:01:21.860> you<00:01:21.890> make<00:01:22.130> the<00:01:22.250> job<00:01:22.460> then<00:01:23.150> when<00:01:23.270> you

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
and you make the job then when you

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.789 
and you make the job then when you
retrieve<00:01:23.990> it<00:01:25.840> you<00:01:26.840> can<00:01:27.049> just<00:01:27.260> put<00:01:27.470> the<00:01:27.619> arrow

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:27.799 
retrieve it you can just put the arrow

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:35.980 
retrieve it you can just put the arrow
back<00:01:28.100> into<00:01:28.460> the<00:01:28.610> side<00:01:29.450> pocket<00:01:31.150> and<00:01:34.869> you<00:01:35.869> don't

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
back into the side pocket and you don't

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.249 
back into the side pocket and you don't
have<00:01:36.110> to<00:01:36.380> lose<00:01:36.560> it<00:01:36.830> and<00:01:37.040> go<00:01:37.360> like<00:01:38.360> that<00:01:38.509> so<00:01:39.229> I

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:39.259 
have to lose it and go like that so I

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:42.130 
have to lose it and go like that so I
just<00:01:39.820> saves<00:01:40.820> you<00:01:40.970> the<00:01:41.000> time<00:01:41.270> from<00:01:41.540> looking<00:01:41.930> for

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
just saves you the time from looking for

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:43.990 
just saves you the time from looking for
the<00:01:42.229> arrow<00:01:42.380> looking<00:01:42.979> for<00:01:43.130> the<00:01:43.220> spool<00:01:43.490> putting

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
the arrow looking for the spool putting

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.330 
the arrow looking for the spool putting
it<00:01:44.090> away<00:01:44.180> put<00:01:44.630> it<00:01:44.720> back<00:01:44.960> out<00:01:45.140> you<00:01:45.860> know<00:01:46.009> just
