from<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.359> skin<00:00:24.510> as<00:00:24.900> the<00:00:25.019> skin<00:00:25.260> becomes<00:00:25.590> drier

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
from the skin as the skin becomes drier

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.609 
from the skin as the skin becomes drier
and<00:00:26.460> cracked<00:00:27.210> it<00:00:27.660> becomes<00:00:27.960> more<00:00:28.199> susceptible

to<00:00:29.150> allergens<00:00:30.150> getting<00:00:30.570> in<00:00:30.750> and<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.380> attack

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
to allergens getting in and the attack

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.650 
to allergens getting in and the attack
tends<00:00:32.160> to<00:00:32.340> get<00:00:32.430> worse<00:00:32.700> and<00:00:32.969> worse<00:00:33.030> because<00:00:33.510> you

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
tends to get worse and worse because you

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.350 
tends to get worse and worse because you
scratch<00:00:34.200> it<00:00:34.590> gets<00:00:34.800> drier<00:00:35.190> more<00:00:35.550> allergen<00:00:36.149> gets

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
scratch it gets drier more allergen gets

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.720 
scratch it gets drier more allergen gets
in<00:00:36.540> so<00:00:36.989> you<00:00:37.110> want<00:00:37.290> to<00:00:37.380> break<00:00:37.649> that<00:00:37.980> cycle<00:00:38.399> by

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
in so you want to break that cycle by

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.360 
in so you want to break that cycle by
retaining<00:00:39.120> oils<00:00:39.660> in<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:39.930> skin<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.440> first<00:00:41.100> way

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
retaining oils in the skin the first way

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.090 
retaining oils in the skin the first way
to<00:00:41.399> keep<00:00:41.700> oils<00:00:42.059> in<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.329> skin<00:00:42.660> is<00:00:43.050> to<00:00:43.350> bathe<00:00:43.559> or

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
to keep oils in the skin is to bathe or
