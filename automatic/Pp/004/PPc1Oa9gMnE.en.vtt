00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:46.930 
down the incisal edges of the anterior
teeth<00:03:45.950> I'm<00:03:46.160> going<00:03:46.340> to<00:03:46.400> focus<00:03:46.730> on<00:03:46.850> the

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:48.670 
teeth I'm going to focus on the
bicuspids<00:03:47.570> because<00:03:47.840> sometimes<00:03:48.200> it's<00:03:48.380> hard<00:03:48.440> to

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 
bicuspids because sometimes it's hard to

get the bicuspids and the molars all in
focus<00:03:51.829> at<00:03:52.160> the<00:03:52.280> same<00:03:52.459> time<00:03:52.790> the<00:03:53.180> air<00:03:53.360> is<00:03:53.510> to

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
focus at the same time the air is to

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:55.240 
focus at the same time the air is to
keep<00:03:53.840> any<00:03:54.049> fogging<00:03:54.350> off<00:03:54.620> the<00:03:54.799> mirror<00:03:55.040> and

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 
we're done so that's how quickly these

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:59.710 
we're done so that's how quickly these

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:57.870 
is close to the cervical third of the
adjacent<00:04:56.530> tooth<00:04:56.740> and<00:04:57.039> while<00:04:57.280> she<00:04:57.490> holds<00:04:57.789> that

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:57.880 
adjacent tooth and while she holds that

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.270 
adjacent tooth and while she holds that
in<00:04:58.030> place<00:04:58.080> I'm<00:04:59.080> gonna<00:04:59.289> go<00:04:59.440> ahead<00:04:59.530> and<00:04:59.919> snap<00:05:00.220> a

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:00.280 
in place I'm gonna go ahead and snap a

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.909 
in place I'm gonna go ahead and snap a
picture<00:05:00.669> making<00:05:01.030> sure<00:05:01.330> that<00:05:01.510> you<00:05:01.660> can<00:05:01.810> see<00:05:02.080> not

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:02.919 
picture making sure that you can see not

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:05.159 
picture making sure that you can see not
only<00:05:02.979> the<00:05:03.370> tooth<00:05:03.580> in<00:05:03.820> question<00:05:04.389> but<00:05:04.600> the<00:05:04.720> a<00:05:04.750> one

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:05.169 
only the tooth in question but the a one

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:07.710 
only the tooth in question but the a one
on<00:05:05.410> the<00:05:05.650> shade<00:05:05.889> tab<00:05:06.760> itself<00:05:07.180> so<00:05:07.419> they<00:05:07.539> know

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:07.720 
on the shade tab itself so they know

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:09.540 
on the shade tab itself so they know
which<00:05:07.900> shade<00:05:08.199> tab<00:05:08.440> it<00:05:08.590> was<00:05:08.770> so<00:05:09.100> then<00:05:09.250> we'll<00:05:09.370> use

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:09.550 
which shade tab it was so then we'll use

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:11.820 
which shade tab it was so then we'll use
the<00:05:09.729> B<00:05:09.910> one<00:05:10.150> for<00:05:10.449> the<00:05:10.539> incisal<00:05:11.020> third<00:05:11.470> and

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:11.830 
the B one for the incisal third and

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:14.100 
the B one for the incisal third and
again<00:05:12.820> we're<00:05:13.120> going<00:05:13.419> to<00:05:13.479> try<00:05:13.660> to<00:05:13.720> hold<00:05:13.960> the

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:14.110 
again we're going to try to hold the

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:15.900 
again we're going to try to hold the
part<00:05:14.350> of<00:05:14.470> the<00:05:14.530> shade<00:05:14.800> tab<00:05:15.070> that<00:05:15.310> represents

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:15.910 
part of the shade tab that represents

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:18.150 
part of the shade tab that represents
that<00:05:15.970> so<00:05:16.720> we<00:05:16.840> got<00:05:16.930> the<00:05:17.080> incisal<00:05:17.470> edge<00:05:17.860> open

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:18.160 
that so we got the incisal edge open

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.159 
that so we got the incisal edge open
just<00:05:18.580> a<00:05:18.699> little<00:05:18.940> alien<00:05:19.090> the<00:05:19.300> incisal<00:05:19.660> edge<00:05:19.990> of

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:20.169 
just a little alien the incisal edge of

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:21.900 
just a little alien the incisal edge of
the<00:05:20.229> shade<00:05:20.470> tab<00:05:20.740> against<00:05:21.220> the<00:05:21.310> incisal<00:05:21.639> edge

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:21.910 
the shade tab against the incisal edge

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:24.570 
the shade tab against the incisal edge
of<00:05:22.060> the<00:05:22.120> tooth<00:05:22.330> in<00:05:22.510> the<00:05:22.599> same<00:05:22.810> plane<00:05:23.310> or<00:05:24.310> as

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:24.580 
of the tooth in the same plane or as

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:25.469 
of the tooth in the same plane or as
best<00:05:24.880> as<00:05:25.060> we<00:05:25.090> can

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:25.479 
best as we can

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:27.870

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:27.880 
and take one more picture with the tooth

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:31.350
