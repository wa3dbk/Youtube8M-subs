00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
stand and this is how it's gonna be

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.790 
stand and this is how it's gonna be
looking<00:00:26.820> like<00:00:26.849> the<00:00:27.840> structure<00:00:28.320> here<00:00:28.500> at<00:00:28.590> least

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
looking like the structure here at least

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.209 
looking like the structure here at least
it's<00:00:29.070> gonna<00:00:29.220> fit<00:00:30.119> enough<00:00:30.510> to<00:00:30.890> withstand<00:00:31.890> an

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
it's gonna fit enough to withstand an

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.299 
it's gonna fit enough to withstand an
elephant<00:00:32.700> basically<00:00:33.239> I<00:00:33.780> go<00:00:34.649> I<00:00:34.680> went<00:00:35.100> ahead<00:00:35.190> and

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
elephant basically I go I went ahead and

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.639 
elephant basically I go I went ahead and
tested<00:00:35.579> it<00:00:35.850> out<00:00:35.969> I<00:00:36.000> stepped<00:00:36.450> on<00:00:36.690> it<00:00:36.899> and<00:00:37.140> walked

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
tested it out I stepped on it and walked

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
been wanting 40 inches high just so my

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.840 
been wanting 40 inches high just so my
skimmer<00:00:46.020> could<00:00:46.320> fit<00:00:46.530> in<00:00:46.649> there<00:00:46.829> easily<00:00:47.219> access

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
skimmer could fit in there easily access

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.970 
skimmer could fit in there easily access
in<00:00:48.030> everything<00:00:48.570> like<00:00:48.600> that<00:00:48.750> without<00:00:49.559> having

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
in everything like that without having

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
it's all done and complete and the

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.900 
it's all done and complete and the
aquarium<00:03:19.320> setup<00:03:19.590> on<00:03:19.860> it<00:03:20.040> I<00:03:20.190> just<00:03:20.459> can't<00:03:20.700> wait

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
aquarium setup on it I just can't wait

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.050 
aquarium setup on it I just can't wait
it's<00:03:21.750> taking<00:03:22.290> a<00:03:22.530> long<00:03:22.980> long<00:03:23.310> time<00:03:23.550> to<00:03:23.760> do<00:03:23.910> this

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
it's taking a long long time to do this

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.930 
it's taking a long long time to do this
and<00:03:24.270> it's<00:03:24.510> way<00:03:24.959> bigger<00:03:25.260> than<00:03:25.680> my<00:03:26.610> previous

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
and it's way bigger than my previous

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.660 
and it's way bigger than my previous
stance<00:03:27.480> that<00:03:27.600> I've<00:03:27.840> done<00:03:28.050> and<00:03:28.500> I<00:03:28.920> just<00:03:29.400> want<00:03:29.610> it

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
stance that I've done and I just want it

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:32.449 
stance that I've done and I just want it
to<00:03:29.850> look<00:03:29.970> really<00:03:30.330> nice<00:03:30.540> I<00:03:30.780> also<00:03:31.530> chose<00:03:31.950> birch

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
to look really nice I also chose birch

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:35.540 
to look really nice I also chose birch
here<00:03:32.970> it's<00:03:33.900> a<00:03:34.020> really<00:03:34.290> nice<00:03:34.470> smooth<00:03:34.950> wood<00:03:35.220> the

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:35.550 
here it's a really nice smooth wood the

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:38.360 
here it's a really nice smooth wood the
grain<00:03:35.760> isn't<00:03:36.000> too<00:03:36.420> deep<00:03:36.720> like<00:03:37.470> oak<00:03:37.770> would<00:03:38.130> be

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
grain isn't too deep like oak would be

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.170 
grain isn't too deep like oak would be
so<00:03:39.170> it<00:03:40.170> wouldn't<00:03:40.440> it<00:03:40.709> will<00:03:40.980> give<00:03:41.610> it<00:03:41.730> a<00:03:41.790> nicer

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
so it wouldn't it will give it a nicer

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.330 
so it wouldn't it will give it a nicer
finish<00:03:42.209> when<00:03:42.900> it's<00:03:43.260> painted<00:03:43.530> and<00:03:43.920> everything

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
finish when it's painted and everything

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.340 
finish when it's painted and everything
like<00:03:44.490> that<00:03:44.550> would<00:03:44.910> be<00:03:44.940> a<00:03:45.060> much<00:03:45.360> smoother<00:03:45.750> of

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
like that would be a much smoother of

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.440 
like that would be a much smoother of
course<00:03:46.620> I'm<00:03:46.740> gonna<00:03:46.860> send<00:03:47.400> it<00:03:47.550> down<00:03:47.760> really

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
course I'm gonna send it down really

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:52.510
