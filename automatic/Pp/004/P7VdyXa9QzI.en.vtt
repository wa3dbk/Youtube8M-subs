00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.620
What are you doing here? Oh yeah that’s
right! The Doctor Who Fan Show!

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:18.030
Who am I?

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:19.050
Any guesses?

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:19.870
Noooo?

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.590
That’s right Osgood’s back as played by
Ingrid Oliver., alongside those shape-shifting-

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.750
surprisingly good kissers- The Zygons.

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.949
They were last seen in The Day of the Doctor
where an agreement was reached between the

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:32.789
humans and the Zygons to live in peace.

00:00:32.789 --> 00:00:38.829
Their return has caused no end of trouble
in the Old Doctor Who Monster’s Home.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:47.059
In my day all this used to be glacierssss

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:49.570
Did I tell you we got another gig?

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.380
No really? So soon?

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:58.040
Well I think it was felt we’d not had a
fair crack of the whip so we’ve got a lovely

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.489
two-parter all about Zygons.

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:08.950
Lucky you! Here Terry, did you hear? Sid’s
got another gig!

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:17.469
THAT IS SO UNFAIR. PETER CAPALDI KEEPS MENTIONING
US IN INTERVIEWS AND YET NO ONE WANTS US IN

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:18.700
AN EPISODE

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:30.149
SSS SSS SSS bad luck we had a whole episode
a few series ago. That Matt Smith was a love

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:31.959
to work with.

00:01:31.959 --> 00:01:35.249
Peter is such a treasure too. Sorry Terry.

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:41.420
NO THAT IS FINE. OFF YOU GO AND HAVE YOUR
ADVENTURE. I’LL JUST LISTEN TO THE FACE

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.060
OF BO SINGING SHOW TUNES.

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:52.689
It’s good to know I am not alone for tonight’s
performance of Miss Saigon.

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:55.329
No thankyou!

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:57.669
Also returning this series is Jemma Redgrave.

00:01:57.669 --> 00:02:00.009
Because Kate Stewart is back!

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:03.679
Doctor Who’s been filming since January
and we’ll be taking a closer look at everything

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:05.929
we know about series 9 in future episodes.

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:08.780
Speaking of baddies, a brand new monster was
revealed last week.

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.130
We don’t know what they’re called yet
but they look like an awesome cross over between

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.720
a Big Daddy from Bioshock and a checkout scanner.

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.780
Let us know what you think in the comments
below.

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.890
Rufus Hound will also be joining the cast
of series 9, he’ll be playing Sam Smith

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:27.000
alongside Game of Thrones actress Maisie Williams,
and is very very very happy about it.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.260
Just had to make sure that I played it very
cool, because inside I was not.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.390
Inside I was pretty ruddy happy about it all.

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.450
Like Murray Gold? Like being menaced by monsters?
Like watching Doctor Who on a big TV?

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:45.340
Well if that’s you- viewers in the UK are
in for a treat as the Symphonic Spectacular

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.130
goes on tour from the 23rd may- and it won’t
be stopping there.

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:53.700
The show will go on to hit the Big Apple for
two performances on the 7th October hosted

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.050
by Michelle Gomez.

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:58.720
Tickets for the UK and US shows are available
now.

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.380
Check this out. An amazing fan in Germany
with very steady hands has created this out

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.710
of 34,000 dominos.

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:06.950
Oh my giddy aunt!

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.990
We spoke to Johanus who made the video and
he told us he used special software to plan

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:15.040
the picture and then it took a total of 4
months to make the video.

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.760
And he tells us that he built each picture
without any failed attempts.

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:25.080
Make sure you check out other videos we liked
in this week’s WhoTube Annotation Attack.

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.100
Get ready. Now.

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.000
And they’re gone.

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:36.280
So, that’s The Fan Show and we want to hear
from you!

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.400
No not you Chris. You!

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.900
Send us your thoughts and cool stuff, whether
it’s you cosplaying as Ursula the Paving

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.460
Slab or a cloud that looks like Peter Capaldi’s
magnificent mane.

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:46.640
Send it to

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:58.180
Oh I’ve got something else to show you!
Quick, come this way.

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:00.170
This is Television Centre.

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:04.670
This is where parts of Doctor Who got filmed
between 1964 and 2005, as well as a fair few

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:05.459
of the Doctor’s regenerations.

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:07.770
They really should put up a plaque.

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:09.420
And now it’s our home.

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.709
Well that’s it for this week. We’ll see
you next time!

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:14.360
They’ve redecorated. I like it!
