00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:09.209
 d 

00:00:09.209 --> 00:00:11.919

00:00:11.919 --> 00:00:14.919
 I put the party and then playing personally 

00:00:15.909 --> 00:00:17.539
 so I often read them under 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:18.820

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:20.259
 I'm doing today 

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:24.249
 second plastic point the visitors later younger later on so that 

00:00:24.249 --> 00:00:27.249

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.779
 project 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.790
 while the porto fc 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.080

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.840
 1 

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.200
 so 40% 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.320
 1 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.990
 1

00:02:22.179 --> 00:02:25.179
 1 decline 

00:02:43.929 --> 00:02:45.149
