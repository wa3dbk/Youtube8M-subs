and that's the main reason that sellers

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.400 
and that's the main reason that sellers
have<00:03:27.150> to<00:03:27.239> assume<00:03:27.570> a<00:03:27.750> note<00:03:27.900> or<00:03:27.930> have<00:03:28.230> somebody

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
have to assume a note or have somebody

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.620 
have to assume a note or have somebody

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
assume before them second thing is is

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:31.670 
assume before them second thing is is
you<00:03:30.720> want<00:03:30.870> to<00:03:30.930> know<00:03:30.989> what<00:03:31.080> the<00:03:31.110> interest<00:03:31.440> rate

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.170 
you want to know what the interest rate
is<00:03:31.709> because<00:03:32.280> if<00:03:32.430> you<00:03:32.520> do<00:03:32.610> have<00:03:32.760> to<00:03:32.880> assume<00:03:33.030> it

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
is because if you do have to assume it

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.910 
is because if you do have to assume it
again<00:03:33.420> you<00:03:33.870> want<00:03:34.050> it<00:03:34.110> to<00:03:34.200> be<00:03:34.290> attractive<00:03:34.770> for
