00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:03.439 

hi<00:00:01.740> I<00:00:02.370> just<00:00:02.580> want<00:00:02.820> to<00:00:02.909> talk<00:00:03.060> to<00:00:03.210> you<00:00:03.270> today

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:03.449 
hi I just want to talk to you today

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:08.690 
hi I just want to talk to you today
about<00:00:04.310> code<00:00:05.310> I<00:00:05.640> had<00:00:05.850> on<00:00:06.089> my<00:00:06.240> 1994<00:00:07.189> Ranger<00:00:08.189> XLT

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
about code I had on my 1994 Ranger XLT

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:14.180 
about code I had on my 1994 Ranger XLT
it<00:00:09.660> was<00:00:09.780> the<00:00:09.990> code<00:00:11.300> 116<00:00:12.530> engine<00:00:13.530> coolant<00:00:13.889> temp

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
it was the code 116 engine coolant temp

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.680 
it was the code 116 engine coolant temp
code<00:00:16.430> you<00:00:17.430> know<00:00:17.550> basically<00:00:18.000> at<00:00:18.150> the<00:00:18.270> time<00:00:18.449> when

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
code you know basically at the time when

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.710 
code you know basically at the time when
I<00:00:18.750> got<00:00:18.930> this<00:00:19.109> truck<00:00:19.640> the<00:00:20.640> temperature<00:00:21.210> would

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
I got this truck the temperature would

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.660 
I got this truck the temperature would
never<00:00:21.930> move<00:00:22.170> from<00:00:22.560> the<00:00:22.980> position<00:00:23.400> where<00:00:23.550> it's

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
never move from the position where it's

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:29.660 
never move from the position where it's
at<00:00:23.850> now<00:00:24.090> so<00:00:26.210> and<00:00:27.380> through<00:00:28.380> that<00:00:28.529> code<00:00:28.830> 116

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
at now so and through that code 116

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.970 
at now so and through that code 116
which<00:00:30.240> means<00:00:30.599> engine<00:00:31.460> temp<00:00:32.460> sensor<00:00:33.739> out<00:00:34.739> of

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
which means engine temp sensor out of

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:42.110 
which means engine temp sensor out of
range<00:00:35.960> so<00:00:36.960> I<00:00:40.219> so<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.340> first<00:00:41.520> step<00:00:41.730> was<00:00:41.879> to<00:00:41.940> see

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
range so I so the first step was to see

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.840 
range so I so the first step was to see
okay<00:00:42.690> where<00:00:42.899> is<00:00:43.079> this<00:00:43.290> engine<00:00:43.710> temp<00:00:43.950> sensor<00:00:44.370> so

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
okay where is this engine temp sensor so

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.299 
okay where is this engine temp sensor so
I<00:00:44.879> went<00:00:45.120> back<00:00:45.300> you<00:00:45.930> know<00:00:46.020> a<00:00:46.079> lot<00:00:46.440> of<00:00:46.469> vehicles

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
I went back you know a lot of vehicles

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.299 
I went back you know a lot of vehicles
it's<00:00:47.670> on<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:49.020> engine<00:00:49.379> somewhere<00:00:49.800> right<00:00:50.100> you

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
it's on the engine somewhere right you

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.360 
it's on the engine somewhere right you
would<00:00:50.430> assume<00:00:51.140> so<00:00:52.140> I<00:00:52.199> looked<00:00:52.620> down<00:00:52.770> here<00:00:53.340> I

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
would assume so I looked down here I

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.090 
would assume so I looked down here I
looked<00:00:53.850> all<00:00:54.030> over<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.329> place<00:00:54.600> here<00:00:55.170> near<00:00:55.949> the

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
looked all over the place here near the

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.020 
looked all over the place here near the
water<00:00:56.340> pump<00:00:56.760> put<00:00:57.300> all<00:00:57.390> this<00:00:57.629> and<00:00:58.100> come<00:00:59.100> to<00:00:59.730> find

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
water pump put all this and come to find

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.960 
water pump put all this and come to find
I<00:01:01.430> found<00:01:02.430> it<00:01:02.640> out<00:01:02.789> here<00:01:03.329> on<00:01:04.010> a<00:01:05.010> water<00:01:05.489> outlet

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
I found it out here on a water outlet

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.929 
I found it out here on a water outlet
hose<00:01:06.240> I<00:01:06.799> thought<00:01:07.799> wow<00:01:08.040> that's<00:01:08.280> pretty<00:01:08.640> strange

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
hose I thought wow that's pretty strange

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.320 
hose I thought wow that's pretty strange
the<00:01:09.240> engine<00:01:09.890> coolant<00:01:10.890> temp<00:01:11.280> sensor<00:01:11.369> is<00:01:11.939> not

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
the engine coolant temp sensor is not

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.320 
the engine coolant temp sensor is not
really<00:01:12.659> on<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:12.990> engine<00:01:13.380> it's<00:01:13.650> hanging<00:01:13.950> out

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:14.330 
really on the engine it's hanging out

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.700 
really on the engine it's hanging out
over<00:01:15.330> here<00:01:15.659> on<00:01:15.900> this<00:01:16.830> hose<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.880> coolant<00:01:18.270> hose

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
over here on this hose the coolant hose

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.830 
over here on this hose the coolant hose
so<00:01:19.710> I<00:01:20.100> did<00:01:20.490> a<00:01:20.520> little<00:01:20.700> research<00:01:21.020> and<00:01:22.020> I<00:01:22.380> found<00:01:22.619> a

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
so I did a little research and I found a

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.390 
so I did a little research and I found a
part<00:01:24.840> that<00:01:24.930> would<00:01:25.170> change<00:01:25.439> that<00:01:25.770> problem<00:01:26.280> I

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
part that would change that problem I

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:32.149 
part that would change that problem I
found<00:01:26.790> this<00:01:27.090> some<00:01:27.450> water<00:01:28.439> outlet<00:01:29.009> um<00:01:31.040> here<00:01:32.040> it

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
found this some water outlet um here it

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.569 
found this some water outlet um here it
is<00:01:32.280> here<00:01:32.579> it's<00:01:32.850> a<00:01:33.470> here's<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.680> portion<00:01:35.549> that

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
is here it's a here's the portion that

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.080 
is here it's a here's the portion that
comes<00:01:35.939> up<00:01:36.150> and<00:01:36.450> goes<00:01:36.720> to<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:36.960> radiator<00:01:37.799> and

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
comes up and goes to the radiator and

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.020 
comes up and goes to the radiator and
then<00:01:39.090> also<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.900> other<00:01:39.930> part<00:01:40.729> you'd<00:01:41.729> see<00:01:41.970> in

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
then also the other part you'd see in

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.990 
then also the other part you'd see in
the<00:01:42.150> back<00:01:42.329> here<00:01:45.170> the<00:01:46.170> portion<00:01:46.710> that<00:01:46.920> comes<00:01:47.759> out

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
the back here the portion that comes out

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.630 
the back here the portion that comes out
it<00:01:48.479> passes<00:01:49.140> this<00:01:49.860> has<00:01:50.340> a<00:01:50.369> socket<00:01:50.850> for<00:01:51.240> the

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
it passes this has a socket for the

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.429 
it passes this has a socket for the
engine<00:01:53.640> coolant<00:01:54.000> temp<00:01:54.240> sensor<00:01:54.329> and<00:01:55.229> then<00:01:55.350> it

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
engine coolant temp sensor and then it

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:03.230 
engine coolant temp sensor and then it
continues<00:01:55.920> on<00:01:56.159> out<00:01:56.579> to<00:01:57.409> the<00:02:01.880> tubing<00:02:02.880> heater

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
continues on out to the tubing heater

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:09.080 
continues on out to the tubing heater
core<00:02:03.950> through<00:02:04.950> this<00:02:05.070> hose<00:02:05.420> so<00:02:07.129> now<00:02:08.129> it's

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
core through this hose so now it's

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.809 
core through this hose so now it's
taking<00:02:09.539> the<00:02:09.629> engine<00:02:10.020> coolant<00:02:10.530> temp<00:02:10.830> actually

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
taking the engine coolant temp actually

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.330 
taking the engine coolant temp actually
closer<00:02:12.150> to<00:02:12.420> the<00:02:12.510> engine<00:02:12.900> or

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
closer to the engine or

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.970 
closer to the engine or
least<00:02:13.489> you<00:02:14.120> know<00:02:14.239> it's<00:02:14.480> it's<00:02:15.080> connected<00:02:15.950> to

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
least you know it's it's connected to

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.520 
least you know it's it's connected to
metal<00:02:16.430> that's<00:02:16.670> attached<00:02:17.090> to<00:02:17.300> the<00:02:18.080> metal<00:02:18.290> of

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
metal that's attached to the metal of

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.470 
metal that's attached to the metal of
the<00:02:18.560> engine<00:02:19.069> so<00:02:19.400> the<00:02:19.580> temperature<00:02:20.090> is<00:02:20.330> going

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
the engine so the temperature is going

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.680 
the engine so the temperature is going
to<00:02:20.569> be<00:02:20.629> drastically<00:02:21.620> higher<00:02:22.310> than<00:02:23.120> if<00:02:23.420> it<00:02:23.599> was

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
to be drastically higher than if it was

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.680 
to be drastically higher than if it was
hanging<00:02:24.170> out<00:02:24.230> here<00:02:24.709> on<00:02:24.890> this<00:02:25.459> hose<00:02:25.730> which<00:02:26.180> was

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
hanging out here on this hose which was

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.039 
hanging out here on this hose which was
just<00:02:26.959> seemed<00:02:27.170> crazy<00:02:27.410> to<00:02:27.680> me<00:02:27.920> in<00:02:28.069> first<00:02:28.370> place

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:29.049 
just seemed crazy to me in first place

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:32.140 
just seemed crazy to me in first place
so<00:02:30.049> yeah<00:02:30.349> I<00:02:30.680> bought<00:02:30.950> this<00:02:31.129> torque<00:02:31.459> flow<00:02:31.700> outlet

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
so yeah I bought this torque flow outlet

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:33.690 
so yeah I bought this torque flow outlet
and<00:02:32.330> I'm<00:02:32.450> sure<00:02:32.629> there<00:02:32.810> are<00:02:32.840> many<00:02:32.989> other

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
and I'm sure there are many other

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.259 
and I'm sure there are many other
outlets<00:02:36.250> out<00:02:37.250> there<00:02:37.310> that<00:02:37.760> may<00:02:37.879> have<00:02:37.910> this

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:38.269 
outlets out there that may have this

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:40.360 
outlets out there that may have this
design<00:02:38.720> I<00:02:39.019> think<00:02:39.200> you<00:02:39.290> have<00:02:39.410> a<00:02:39.470> choice<00:02:39.739> because

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
design I think you have a choice because

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.360 
design I think you have a choice because
they<00:02:40.640> may<00:02:40.790> have<00:02:40.940> realized<00:02:41.330> this<00:02:41.900> back<00:02:42.319> in<00:02:42.500> 1994

you<00:02:44.150> know<00:02:44.269> maybe<00:02:44.569> Midway<00:02:44.989> during<00:02:45.019> production

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
you know maybe Midway during production

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.750 
you know maybe Midway during production
that<00:02:46.880> um<00:02:47.260> they<00:02:48.260> needed<00:02:48.650> to<00:02:48.799> move<00:02:49.010> that<00:02:49.310> from

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
that um they needed to move that from

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.580 
that um they needed to move that from
off<00:02:50.360> the<00:02:51.079> pulleys<00:02:51.980> and<00:02:52.220> close<00:02:52.400> to<00:02:52.519> the<00:02:52.670> engine

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
off the pulleys and close to the engine

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:58.690 
off the pulleys and close to the engine
but<00:02:54.590> if<00:02:54.860> you<00:02:55.040> are<00:02:55.239> the<00:02:56.239> other<00:02:56.329> Ranger<00:02:57.459> has<00:02:58.459> this

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
but if you are the other Ranger has this

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:05.020 
but if you are the other Ranger has this
problem<00:03:00.760> finding<00:03:01.760> a<00:03:01.940> water<00:03:02.900> outlet<00:03:03.730> with<00:03:04.730> a

sensor<00:03:07.329> that<00:03:08.329> should<00:03:08.660> solve<00:03:08.900> your<00:03:09.110> problem

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
sensor that should solve your problem

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.039 
sensor that should solve your problem
and<00:03:10.099> if<00:03:10.220> it<00:03:10.370> doesn't<00:03:10.610> means<00:03:11.599> you've<00:03:11.780> got<00:03:11.900> other

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:12.049 
and if it doesn't means you've got other

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:14.559 
and if it doesn't means you've got other
problems<00:03:12.319> maybe<00:03:13.010> your<00:03:13.400> water<00:03:13.940> pump<00:03:14.180> needs<00:03:14.480> to

00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:14.569 
problems maybe your water pump needs to

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:16.900 
problems maybe your water pump needs to
be<00:03:14.660> changed<00:03:15.319> because<00:03:15.560> it's<00:03:15.890> not<00:03:16.069> circulating

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
be changed because it's not circulating

be changed because it's not circulating
the<00:03:17.630> water<00:03:17.870> around<00:03:18.079> enough<00:03:18.590> to<00:03:18.620> get<00:03:19.010> to<00:03:19.160> the

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
the water around enough to get to the

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.840 
the water around enough to get to the
sensor<00:03:19.700> or<00:03:20.060> maybe<00:03:20.600> your<00:03:20.780> thermostat<00:03:21.609> needs<00:03:22.609> to

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:22.850 
sensor or maybe your thermostat needs to

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
sensor or maybe your thermostat needs to
be<00:03:23.650> changed<00:03:24.650> as<00:03:24.889> well<00:03:25.690> but<00:03:26.690> on<00:03:26.900> this<00:03:27.519> this

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
be changed as well but on this this

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:34.330 
be changed as well but on this this
solved<00:03:29.870> my<00:03:30.049> problem<00:03:30.700> it<00:03:32.170> or<00:03:33.170> I<00:03:33.590> forgot<00:03:34.160> to

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
solved my problem it or I forgot to

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.809 
solved my problem it or I forgot to
mention<00:03:34.489> the<00:03:35.090> last<00:03:35.269> one<00:03:36.230> is<00:03:36.639> your<00:03:37.639> engine

00:03:37.809 --> 00:03:37.819 
mention the last one is your engine

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:40.000 
mention the last one is your engine
coolant<00:03:38.239> sensor<00:03:38.540> may<00:03:39.019> be<00:03:39.079> bad<00:03:39.410> and<00:03:39.769> it<00:03:39.859> needs

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 
to be changed but that one's the most

to be changed but that one's the most
obvious<00:03:42.709> I<00:03:42.859> guess<00:03:42.919> huh<00:03:45.970> so<00:03:46.970> good<00:03:47.540> luck
