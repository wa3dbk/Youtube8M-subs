come on zo

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:14.390 
come on zo
I<00:02:10.340> thought<00:02:11.810> in<00:02:12.810> the<00:02:13.260> most<00:02:13.409> attention<00:02:13.709> too<00:02:14.250> much

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
I thought in the most attention too much

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.199 
I thought in the most attention too much
attention<00:02:14.760> from<00:02:14.969> insight<00:02:15.450> and<00:02:15.719> yes<00:02:15.930> it's

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
attention from insight and yes it's

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:20.059 
attention from insight and yes it's
important<00:02:18.209> but<00:02:18.359> if<00:02:18.540> I<00:02:18.659> said<00:02:18.930> to<00:02:19.019> you<00:02:19.049> who<00:02:19.290> has

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
important but if I said to you who has

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:22.339 
important but if I said to you who has
inspired<00:02:20.549> you<00:02:20.879> the<00:02:21.120> most<00:02:21.269> in<00:02:21.689> your<00:02:21.719> life<00:02:21.840> I'm

inspired you the most in your life I'm

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:24.770

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.780 
guessing you probably would you respond
with<00:02:24.900> a<00:02:24.959> politician<00:02:25.230> or<00:02:25.560> a<00:02:25.650> cooker<00:02:26.040> or<00:02:26.189> so<00:02:26.340> what

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
with a politician or a cooker or so what

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.699 
with a politician or a cooker or so what
would<00:02:26.909> you<00:02:27.030> respond<00:02:27.389> not<00:02:27.629> that<00:02:27.780> chef<00:02:28.469> there's
