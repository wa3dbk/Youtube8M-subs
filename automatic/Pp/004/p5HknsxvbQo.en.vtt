00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:03.300
 Only you can hear me summoner 

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:05.800
 What masterpiece are we going to play today? 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:07.720
 Here we go! 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:09.360
 Go Go!

 This case is for me 

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:16.360
 Leave them to me 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.380
 We will make them suffer 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:19.600
 To fight 

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.160
 The storm is at your service 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.500
 My sword is at your service 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.060
 On and ready for service 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:28.400
 All the world 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:29.100
 On an arrow 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:30.600
 There is nothing that stops me 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.280
 Oblivion awaits you 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.180
 Hard as stone 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.000
 Quieggo encontggag a worthy opponent 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.880
 The eyes never lie 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.240
 Banquet time 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:40.240
 I was born for this... 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:41.740
 Literally 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.280
 The cycle of life and death continues ... 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.520
 We will live 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.080
 They will die... 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.720
 This battle will be my masterpiece 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.340
 Do not trust anything except your strength 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.180
 I decide that it will bring the tide 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.420
 Only the spider is safe in its web 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.220
 A storm is coming 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:10.820
 Sentenced to death 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.240
 Start to get excited 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:13.940
 Let the combat begin 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.620
 This is going to be a massacre 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:17.760
 let's have fun 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:19.080
 As the balance dictates 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.620
 We will kill your enemies (Do you also want to play?) 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:23.780
 It will be fun (It will be fun) 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.060
 More than precious stones 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.240
 I offer you an ancestral power ... 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:35.800
 Captain 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.040
 WORLD OF SERVICE 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.780
 I thought you would never choose me 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:40.460
 Valaran will know the harmony 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.280
 Live and die under the blade 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.440
 I will make them suffer without measure 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:46.940
 By my will, this will end 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.760
 The black rose will bloom once more 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.820
 Do not leave anything behind 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:51.720
 On my wings 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.100
 Only I will make it to victory 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:55.720
 A new moon looms 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.640
 Do you consider me beautiful? 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.080
 Embrace the darkness 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.020
 Guilt will lead to agony 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.420
 The invisible sword is the deadliest 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.000
 I knew you would do it 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.340

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.180
 So much untapped power 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.100
 Let's persecute those who have fallen in the dark 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.200
 What pleasant agony are we going to provoke? 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.820
 If I changed things I would not have mercy 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.420
 Ready to destroy with my brutal machine 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.140
 And if we burn the world? 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.200
 If you pay a round I sign 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.040
 . 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.880

 It's time to give a good lesson 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:42.580
 A demonstration of superior criteria 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.400
 I fight for a better tomorrow 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.640
 A wise decision 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.560
 The night watches my acts 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.380
 JASJASJAKSJKSJAKSJASJKSJASJK 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.240
 Changes are good 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:03.980
 As master orders 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:05.360
 Dawn has arrived 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:06.260
 Your will 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:07.100
 My hands 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.040
 A tactical decision invoking 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.360
 I'm going to be the best 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:11.640
 My sword is yours 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.100
 Everyone dies, some need help 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:15.420
 To do the troll 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.580
 Join the evolution 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.100
 Our fury is beyond your control 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.760
 They will fear the wild 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.260
 Fear the depths 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.520
 It is a privilege to die at my feet 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:27.580
 very well 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.180
 What is better than death? 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:38.540
 Crush your enemies now, see how they crawl before you and hear their novice whimpers 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.400
 My heart and sword, always for demacia 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:46.460
 Lead me to battle 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.480
 Winged Justice 

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:50.530
 I always take my part, blood or gold 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.470
 Violence fixes everything 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:53.870
 How about a drink? 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:55.770
 I want to shoot something 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:58.730
 Hit first, ask while hitting 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:00.770
 Today we feel naughty Eh? 

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:02.770
 Ahhh what do you want? 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:04.560
 What is broken 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:05.760
 It can be reforged 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.300
 Nice to meet you 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:09.700
 Prepare for boarding 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.560
 Red will turn the rivers 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.620
 Death is just the beginning 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.840
 Do you feel a chill? 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.140
 I live to kill 

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:23.320
 The heart is the strongest muscle 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.400
 I will be free 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.220
 The lady of fortune smiles at me 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:33.540
 Welcome to League of Draven 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:42.100
 Draven not 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.340
 Draaaaaaaaaaaaaaaven 

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:48.020
 I am the fear that makes my rivals tremble 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:49.760
 Always trust your spirit 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:54.080
 Eternal life infinite torture 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:55.440
 Feel 

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:58.440
 The embrace of the thorns 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:00.960
 My sting brings an excruciating death 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:05.300
 Knowledge through disintegration, 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.640
 A guardian is always prepared 

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.220
 Death is like the wind 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:11.800
 Always by my side 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:13.220
 I will bury the world in ice 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:15.440
 While living nobody will know the suffering 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:16.980
 Fortune we smiled at the foolish 

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:19.219
 I will be your bird of bad aguero 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:22.640
 Contemplate the power of the islands of the shadows 

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:25.060
 I'll do what you order for now ... 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:26.360
 This is going to be the bomb 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:31.840
 How about a magic trick? 

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:39.920
 Is it funny, right? How can your best friend explode like this ... 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:50.800
 Until lueguito!
