enough here's another situation where

I'm standing on top of the building I

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:50.800 
I'm standing on top of the building I
was<00:02:49.220> just<00:02:49.489> in<00:02:49.670> I<00:02:49.910> think<00:02:50.030> it's<00:02:50.390> actually<00:02:50.540> the

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
was just in I think it's actually the

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.920 
was just in I think it's actually the
same<00:02:50.989> light<00:02:51.260> to<00:02:51.470> the<00:02:51.560> ass<00:02:51.709> with<00:02:51.860> you<00:02:51.980> and<00:02:52.340> I<00:02:53.269> get

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
same light to the ass with you and I get

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.440 
same light to the ass with you and I get
a<00:02:53.959> couple<00:02:54.200> of<00:02:54.380> kills<00:02:54.590> here<00:02:55.040> but<00:02:55.940> you<00:02:56.060> can<00:02:56.209> see

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:56.450 
a couple of kills here but you can see

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.680 
a couple of kills here but you can see
that<00:02:56.630> I<00:02:56.660> have<00:02:56.900> the<00:02:57.050> scope<00:02:57.410> on<00:02:57.680> that<00:02:58.370> will<00:02:58.690> allow

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
that I have the scope on that will allow

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:02.080 
that I have the scope on that will allow

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:21.979 
get also only throw one at a time a lot

00:05:21.979 --> 00:05:23.409 
get also only throw one at a time a lot
of<00:05:22.009> people<00:05:22.190> will<00:05:22.430> throw<00:05:22.639> them<00:05:22.849> both<00:05:23.030> thinking

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:23.419 
of people will throw them both thinking

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:24.969 
of people will throw them both thinking
that<00:05:23.569> they're<00:05:23.750> getting<00:05:23.870> use<00:05:24.139> of<00:05:24.349> both<00:05:24.650> of<00:05:24.860> them

00:05:24.969 --> 00:05:24.979 
that they're getting use of both of them

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:26.980 
that they're getting use of both of them
that's<00:05:25.190> not<00:05:25.280> the<00:05:25.550> case<00:05:25.779> you're<00:05:26.779> going<00:05:26.930> to

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:26.990 
that's not the case you're going to

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:28.749 
that's not the case you're going to
throw<00:05:27.259> one<00:05:27.560> and<00:05:27.800> once<00:05:28.039> you<00:05:28.190> throw<00:05:28.430> the<00:05:28.580> other

00:05:28.749 --> 00:05:28.759 
throw one and once you throw the other

00:05:28.759 --> 00:05:31.450 
throw one and once you throw the other
the<00:05:29.389> first<00:05:29.629> one<00:05:29.870> you<00:05:29.990> threw<00:05:30.349> is<00:05:30.620> going<00:05:31.159> to<00:05:31.279> turn

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:31.460 
the first one you threw is going to turn

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:34.059 
the first one you threw is going to turn
off<00:05:31.669> so<00:05:32.449> you<00:05:32.539> can<00:05:32.719> only<00:05:32.960> have<00:05:33.199> one<00:05:33.229> going<00:05:33.800> at<00:05:34.039> a

00:05:34.059 --> 00:05:34.069 
off so you can only have one going at a

00:05:34.069 --> 00:05:36.309 
off so you can only have one going at a
time<00:05:34.340> so<00:05:35.270> make<00:05:35.419> sure<00:05:35.449> you<00:05:35.689> watch<00:05:35.930> the<00:05:36.169> radar

00:05:36.309 --> 00:05:36.319 
time so make sure you watch the radar

00:05:36.319 --> 00:05:40.920 
time so make sure you watch the radar
screen<00:05:36.830> to<00:05:37.039> see<00:05:37.539> exactly<00:05:38.539> when<00:05:39.080> it<00:05:39.229> happens

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:40.930 
screen to see exactly when it happens

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:43.809 
screen to see exactly when it happens
also<00:05:41.930> I<00:05:42.199> think<00:05:42.529> it's<00:05:42.620> about<00:05:42.770> 60<00:05:43.340> seconds

00:05:43.809 --> 00:05:43.819 
also I think it's about 60 seconds

00:05:43.819 --> 00:05:46.330 
also I think it's about 60 seconds
between<00:05:44.270> mortar<00:05:44.840> strikes<00:05:45.169> so<00:05:45.860> trying<00:05:46.099> to<00:05:46.159> time

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:46.340 
between mortar strikes so trying to time

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:48.459 
between mortar strikes so trying to time
it<00:05:46.370> correctly<00:05:46.639> use<00:05:47.479> those<00:05:47.719> whenever<00:05:47.960> you<00:05:48.229> can

00:05:48.459 --> 00:05:48.469 
it correctly use those whenever you can

00:05:48.469 --> 00:05:51.700 
it correctly use those whenever you can

the Recon class and I'm going to cover
with<00:05:53.419> the<00:05:53.539> VSS<00:05:54.139> I<00:05:54.529> also<00:05:54.889> use<00:05:55.190> the<00:05:55.339> t88<00:05:56.000> as<00:05:56.210> well

00:05:56.439 --> 00:05:56.449 
with the VSS I also use the t88 as well
