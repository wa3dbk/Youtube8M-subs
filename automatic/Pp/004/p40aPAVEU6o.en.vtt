00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.210
 Now people are here today 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:08.130
 I bring a chapter of best and you 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.510
 we want to show the possible location 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:13.100
 of the child we lost on the plane 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:16.950
 is 

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:19.650
 for stealth in the middle of the map 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:23.390
 not exactly in the middle of the map 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.390
 and good is a camp 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.230
 very big 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:33.340
 but something very big 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:36.829
 and good the attention is to begin 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:39.450
 these human sculptures 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:42.020
 Sun 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:45.200
 What are they 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:47.300
 a complete uncle around is maybe 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:50.050
 something you believe us and the balls of the 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:52.550
 leg at the beginning 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:55.390
 this raid so that you are but vÃ©lez 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.390
 subject of ropes 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:01.270
 there is a couple of them port with surfers 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:04.890
 a tipi hanging you know sounds of each 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.890
 people from the camps are like that 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.360
 also 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.920
 Those from Miami 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.650
 if you have upcoming memories the 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.310
 stains 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:20.210
 a racket and note 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.960
 here 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:26.250
 and most of all I wanted to teach 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:28.440
 and another is two 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.610
 In addition to teaching the possible location 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:35.240
 of our son 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:37.100
 look like we have departure prince airplane and 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.610
 he's investigating a bit and I've 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.610
 discovered 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.659
 we already know that we do not have to let go 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:47.350
 another worry 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:50.979
 it is taking 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:53.240
 but you're burning valera 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:55.790
 locations 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:59.360
 to me 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:03.130
 is to be education and I think it's the most 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.130
 logical more than anything because 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:10.110
 because it is in the middle of the camp and 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:12.180
 good is a scene then logical and 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.670
 as you can see they do not leave behind because there is a 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.400
 small square here to white 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.980
 that means I guess if it happens to me 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.819
 to me nothing more 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.819
 they are still 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:31.099
 and good this next to this video 

00:02:26.969 --> 00:02:31.099
 I will write a game of goal of belletti 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:35.610
 to see if I find more ministries 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.190
 come from the 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.890
 I was really enjoying this game 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.630
 it's a pleasure to subscribe so to disregard 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.920
 more videos 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.920
 and good until then
