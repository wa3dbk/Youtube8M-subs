I<00:00:05.859> just<00:00:06.189> wanted<00:00:06.580> to<00:00:06.729> kind<00:00:07.120> of<00:00:07.209> give<00:00:07.359> you<00:00:07.390> a

00:00:07.499 --> 00:00:07.509 
I just wanted to kind of give you a

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:09.419 
I just wanted to kind of give you a
brief<00:00:08.050> overview<00:00:08.410> of<00:00:08.559> how<00:00:08.740> the<00:00:08.799> table<00:00:09.219> works

00:00:09.419 --> 00:00:09.429 
brief overview of how the table works

00:00:09.429 --> 00:00:11.759 
brief overview of how the table works
and<00:00:10.179> hopefully<00:00:10.599> inspire<00:00:10.990> other<00:00:11.440> people<00:00:11.469> to

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:11.769 
and hopefully inspire other people to

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:16.560 
and hopefully inspire other people to
make<00:00:12.599> similar<00:00:13.599> type<00:00:13.870> tables<00:00:14.790> pretty<00:00:15.790> much<00:00:15.940> got

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:16.570 
make similar type tables pretty much got

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:19.529 
make similar type tables pretty much got
the<00:00:16.930> table<00:00:17.890> set<00:00:18.100> up<00:00:18.250> here<00:00:18.519> I've<00:00:18.880> got<00:00:19.150> the<00:00:19.330> Wii

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:19.539 
the table set up here I've got the Wii

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:22.529 
the table set up here I've got the Wii
mote<00:00:19.750> hooked<00:00:20.380> up<00:00:20.590> and<00:00:21.000> it's<00:00:22.000> linked<00:00:22.359> to<00:00:22.420> the

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:22.539 
mote hooked up and it's linked to the

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:24.450 
mote hooked up and it's linked to the
computer<00:00:23.050> and<00:00:23.199> it's<00:00:23.619> pointed<00:00:23.980> straight<00:00:24.220> down

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:24.460 
computer and it's pointed straight down

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.390 
computer and it's pointed straight down
at<00:00:24.670> the<00:00:24.820> table<00:00:25.689> now<00:00:26.380> I<00:00:26.410> use<00:00:26.560> a<00:00:26.590> program<00:00:26.859> called

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:27.400 
at the table now I use a program called

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:32.700 
at the table now I use a program called
a<00:00:27.820> Boone<00:00:28.269> gin<00:00:28.599> smooth<00:00:29.050> board<00:00:29.439> to<00:00:30.189> actually<00:00:31.710> get

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:32.710 
a Boone gin smooth board to actually get

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:35.549 
a Boone gin smooth board to actually get
the<00:00:32.950> input<00:00:33.250> from<00:00:33.489> the<00:00:34.239> infrared<00:00:35.170> emitters

00:00:35.549 --> 00:00:35.559 
the input from the infrared emitters

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:37.139 
the input from the infrared emitters
into<00:00:36.040> the<00:00:36.190> Wii<00:00:36.309> Remote<00:00:36.640> and<00:00:36.879> then<00:00:37.000> of<00:00:37.120> course

00:00:37.139 --> 00:00:37.149 
into the Wii Remote and then of course

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:39.690 
into the Wii Remote and then of course
into<00:00:37.510> the<00:00:37.600> computer<00:00:38.110> I'll<00:00:38.890> put<00:00:39.129> a<00:00:39.160> link<00:00:39.399> on<00:00:39.579> the

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:39.700 
into the computer I'll put a link on the

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:44.160 
into the computer I'll put a link on the
site<00:00:39.940> to<00:00:40.239> that<00:00:42.180> now<00:00:43.180> this<00:00:43.539> has<00:00:43.690> kind<00:00:43.870> of<00:00:43.989> been<00:00:44.050> a

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:44.170 
site to that now this has kind of been a

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.010 
site to that now this has kind of been a
learning<00:00:44.320> experience<00:00:44.940> some<00:00:45.940> things<00:00:46.239> that<00:00:46.719> I

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:47.020 
learning experience some things that I

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:49.590 
learning experience some things that I
originally<00:00:47.590> wanted<00:00:47.710> to<00:00:47.890> do<00:00:48.300> didn't<00:00:49.300> work<00:00:49.420> out

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:49.600 
originally wanted to do didn't work out

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.599 
originally wanted to do didn't work out
quite<00:00:49.780> as<00:00:49.989> well<00:00:50.020> as<00:00:50.199> planned<00:00:50.680> so<00:00:51.010> I<00:00:51.309> had<00:00:51.520> to

00:00:51.599 --> 00:00:51.609 
quite as well as planned so I had to

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:54.990 
quite as well as planned so I had to
make<00:00:51.730> a<00:00:51.789> few<00:00:52.000> changes<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:54.250> first<00:00:54.489> one<00:00:54.699> being

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:55.000 
make a few changes the first one being

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.500 
make a few changes the first one being
the<00:00:55.690> original<00:00:56.289> plan<00:00:56.590> was<00:00:56.620> to<00:00:57.100> use<00:00:57.129> an<00:00:57.609> infrared

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:58.510 
the original plan was to use an infrared

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.349 
the original plan was to use an infrared
pin<00:00:58.960> like<00:00:59.199> this<00:00:59.530> I<00:00:59.859> made<00:01:00.070> this<00:01:00.250> one<00:01:00.489> and<00:01:00.789> I<00:01:00.969> plan

00:01:01.349 --> 00:01:01.359 
pin like this I made this one and I plan

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:04.560 
pin like this I made this one and I plan
to<00:01:01.390> make<00:01:01.570> a<00:01:01.600> bunch<00:01:01.870> more<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.910> problem<00:01:04.390> with

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:04.570 
to make a bunch more the problem with

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:06.720 
to make a bunch more the problem with
this<00:01:04.840> is<00:01:05.170> since<00:01:05.560> the<00:01:05.770> Wii<00:01:06.040> mote<00:01:06.220> is<00:01:06.370> mounted

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:06.730 
this is since the Wii mote is mounted

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:10.380 
this is since the Wii mote is mounted
above<00:01:07.060> the<00:01:07.120> table<00:01:07.510> as<00:01:08.280> you're<00:01:09.280> moving<00:01:10.180> or

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:10.390 
above the table as you're moving or

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:11.940 
above the table as you're moving or
trying<00:01:10.630> to<00:01:10.720> move<00:01:10.870> things<00:01:11.110> around<00:01:11.230> your<00:01:11.620> hand

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 
trying to move things around your hand

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.230 
trying to move things around your hand
pretty<00:01:12.460> much<00:01:12.640> blocks<00:01:13.000> the<00:01:13.600> infrared<00:01:14.110> light<00:01:15.240> so

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
pretty much blocks the infrared light so

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.980 
pretty much blocks the infrared light so
because<00:01:16.570> of<00:01:16.720> that<00:01:17.160> what<00:01:18.160> I<00:01:18.190> did<00:01:18.430> was<00:01:18.640> I<00:01:18.670> made

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
because of that what I did was I made

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.580 
because of that what I did was I made
this<00:01:19.990> type<00:01:20.290> of<00:01:20.320> infrared<00:01:21.750> light<00:01:22.750> which<00:01:23.020> is<00:01:23.260> I

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590 
this type of infrared light which is I

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.570 
this type of infrared light which is I
call<00:01:24.100> it<00:01:24.130> infrared<00:01:24.610> miniature<00:01:25.320> and<00:01:26.320> I've<00:01:27.250> got

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:27.580 
call it infrared miniature and I've got

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.060 
call it infrared miniature and I've got
another<00:01:28.510> one<00:01:28.690> over<00:01:28.720> here<00:01:28.960> set<00:01:29.500> up<00:01:29.530> next<00:01:29.800> to<00:01:29.980> a

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.070 
another one over here set up next to a

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:31.230 
another one over here set up next to a
miniature<00:01:30.490> so<00:01:30.670> you<00:01:30.760> can<00:01:30.880> see<00:01:31.030> they're<00:01:31.150> about

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
miniature so you can see they're about

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.550 
miniature so you can see they're about
the<00:01:31.570> same<00:01:31.750> size<00:01:32.110> and<00:01:33.210> that<00:01:34.210> was<00:01:34.600> kind<00:01:35.350> of<00:01:35.410> my

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 
the same size and that was kind of my

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:41.460 
the same size and that was kind of my
plan<00:01:35.890> and<00:01:38.310> pretty<00:01:39.310> much<00:01:39.490> with<00:01:39.730> this<00:01:40.150> it's<00:01:41.110> set

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.470 
plan and pretty much with this it's set

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.730 
plan and pretty much with this it's set
up<00:01:41.500> so<00:01:41.860> that<00:01:42.100> it's<00:01:43.030> pointed<00:01:43.660> directly<00:01:43.960> at<00:01:44.380> the

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740 
up so that it's pointed directly at the

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.080 
up so that it's pointed directly at the
Wii<00:01:44.890> mote<00:01:45.130> so<00:01:46.060> when<00:01:46.210> you<00:01:46.300> push<00:01:46.510> the<00:01:46.690> button

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
Wii mote so when you push the button

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.750 
Wii mote so when you push the button
Wiimote<00:01:49.090> gets<00:01:49.300> a<00:01:49.390> nice<00:01:49.540> clear<00:01:49.900> signal<00:01:50.670> now<00:01:51.670> the

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:51.760 
Wiimote gets a nice clear signal now the

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.420 
Wiimote gets a nice clear signal now the
other<00:01:52.000> thing<00:01:52.390> that<00:01:52.890> we<00:01:53.890> were<00:01:54.190> originally

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:54.430 
other thing that we were originally

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.720 
other thing that we were originally
going<00:01:54.820> to<00:01:54.910> do<00:01:55.180> which<00:01:55.630> didn't<00:01:55.990> work<00:01:56.110> out<00:01:56.730> was

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:57.730 
going to do which didn't work out was

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:59.040 
going to do which didn't work out was
we're<00:01:57.940> actually<00:01:58.090> going<00:01:58.330> to<00:01:58.420> use<00:01:58.540> miniatures

00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.050 
we're actually going to use miniatures

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:03.540 
we're actually going to use miniatures
which<00:02:00.330> originally<00:02:01.330> was<00:02:01.480> fine<00:02:02.400> you<00:02:03.400> know<00:02:03.460> you

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:03.550 
which originally was fine you know you

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:06.060 
which originally was fine you know you
put<00:02:03.850> the<00:02:03.940> miniature<00:02:04.330> on<00:02:04.480> the<00:02:04.510> map<00:02:05.050> it's<00:02:05.650> right

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.070 
put the miniature on the map it's right

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.510 
put the miniature on the map it's right
there

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
there

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.630 
there
and<00:02:07.180> they<00:02:07.510> need<00:02:07.690> to<00:02:07.780> use<00:02:07.870> some<00:02:08.080> type<00:02:08.259> of

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
and they need to use some type of

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.220 
and they need to use some type of
virtual<00:02:09.640> token<00:02:10.240> underneath<00:02:10.720> it<00:02:10.930> that<00:02:10.960> you

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
virtual token underneath it that you

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:12.210 
virtual token underneath it that you
would<00:02:11.380> move

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
would move

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.760 
would move
you<00:02:12.430> know<00:02:12.550> so<00:02:12.790> you<00:02:12.850> would<00:02:13.140> move<00:02:14.140> the<00:02:14.290> token<00:02:14.500> and

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
you know so you would move the token and

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.040 
you know so you would move the token and
then<00:02:15.100> wherever<00:02:15.520> it<00:02:15.730> was<00:02:15.850> going<00:02:16.210> to<00:02:16.330> you<00:02:16.930> know

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
then wherever it was going to you know

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.640 
then wherever it was going to you know
put<00:02:17.460> it<00:02:18.460> back<00:02:18.700> on<00:02:19.000> top<00:02:19.060> so<00:02:20.020> you'd<00:02:20.170> have<00:02:20.200> you

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
put it back on top so you'd have you

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.280 
put it back on top so you'd have you
know<00:02:20.770> miniatures<00:02:21.300> the<00:02:22.300> problem<00:02:22.720> is<00:02:22.930> you're

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
know miniatures the problem is you're

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:24.440 
know miniatures the problem is you're
not<00:02:23.320> going<00:02:23.560> to<00:02:23.650> spend<00:02:23.980> the<00:02:24.100> whole<00:02:24.220> game

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
not going to spend the whole game

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.820 
not going to spend the whole game
standing<00:02:25.450> directly<00:02:25.900> above<00:02:26.140> the<00:02:26.290> table<00:02:26.650> like

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
standing directly above the table like

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.250 
standing directly above the table like
this<00:02:27.360> you're<00:02:28.360> going<00:02:28.480> to<00:02:28.570> be<00:02:28.690> sitting<00:02:28.930> over

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
this you're going to be sitting over

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.360 
this you're going to be sitting over
here<00:02:29.760> and<00:02:30.760> as<00:02:31.510> you<00:02:31.630> can<00:02:31.780> see<00:02:31.950> as<00:02:32.950> soon<00:02:33.160> as<00:02:33.280> you

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
here and as you can see as soon as you

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.030 
here and as you can see as soon as you
move<00:02:33.550> from<00:02:33.820> directly<00:02:34.180> above<00:02:34.270> the<00:02:34.720> table

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
move from directly above the table

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.410 
move from directly above the table
there's<00:02:36.040> some<00:02:36.250> distortion<00:02:36.880> here<00:02:37.090> so<00:02:37.300> you're

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
there's some distortion here so you're

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.180 
there's some distortion here so you're
not<00:02:37.450> sure<00:02:37.780> which<00:02:37.990> square<00:02:38.380> you're<00:02:38.530> actually<00:02:38.890> in

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
not sure which square you're actually in

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.580 
not sure which square you're actually in
and<00:02:40.120> it<00:02:40.390> looks<00:02:40.480> like<00:02:40.600> the<00:02:40.810> miniatures<00:02:41.200> kind<00:02:41.500> of

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
and it looks like the miniatures kind of

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.250 
and it looks like the miniatures kind of
just<00:02:41.770> floating<00:02:42.550> in<00:02:42.670> space<00:02:43.110> mainly<00:02:44.110> because

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
just floating in space mainly because

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.670 
just floating in space mainly because
the<00:02:44.560> glass<00:02:44.800> is<00:02:44.830> raised<00:02:45.750> about<00:02:46.750> an<00:02:47.170> eighth<00:02:47.530> of

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
the glass is raised about an eighth of

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.670 
the glass is raised about an eighth of
an<00:02:47.800> inch<00:02:47.920> above<00:02:48.130> the<00:02:48.490> table<00:02:48.730> and<00:02:49.200> then<00:02:50.200> the

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
an inch above the table and then the

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.280 
an inch above the table and then the
actual<00:02:51.640> LCD<00:02:52.210> screen<00:02:52.600> on<00:02:52.630> if<00:02:52.900> you<00:02:53.020> can<00:02:53.170> really

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
actual LCD screen on if you can really

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.310 
actual LCD screen on if you can really
see<00:02:53.620> it<00:02:53.710> here<00:02:53.920> but<00:02:54.790> it's<00:02:54.970> sunk<00:02:55.360> in<00:02:55.540> about<00:02:55.960> a

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:56.320 
see it here but it's sunk in about a

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:00.360 
see it here but it's sunk in about a
quarter<00:02:57.100> of<00:02:57.280> an<00:02:57.430> inch<00:02:57.690> from<00:02:58.690> the<00:02:58.810> frame<00:02:59.370> so

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
quarter of an inch from the frame so

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.350 
quarter of an inch from the frame so
there's<00:03:00.520> about<00:03:00.910> an<00:03:01.120> inch<00:03:01.480> gap<00:03:02.520> between<00:03:03.520> the

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
there's about an inch gap between the

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.100 
there's about an inch gap between the
actual<00:03:04.810> screen<00:03:05.350> and<00:03:06.480> the<00:03:07.480> top<00:03:07.690> of<00:03:07.840> the<00:03:07.900> glass

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110 
actual screen and the top of the glass

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.980 
actual screen and the top of the glass
so<00:03:08.620> because<00:03:09.370> of<00:03:09.490> that<00:03:09.520> we<00:03:10.270> did<00:03:10.420> away<00:03:10.570> with

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:10.990 
so because of that we did away with

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:14.100 
so because of that we did away with
using<00:03:11.730> regular<00:03:12.730> miniatures<00:03:13.150> and<00:03:13.480> we<00:03:13.630> went<00:03:13.840> to

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
using regular miniatures and we went to

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.940 
using regular miniatures and we went to
a<00:03:14.140> strictly<00:03:14.740> virtual<00:03:15.340> miniature<00:03:16.680> system<00:03:17.680> and

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
a strictly virtual miniature system and

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.180 
a strictly virtual miniature system and
you<00:03:18.640> can<00:03:18.790> find<00:03:19.230> hundreds<00:03:20.230> of<00:03:20.380> them<00:03:20.500> on<00:03:20.800> the

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
you can find hundreds of them on the

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:23.340 
you can find hundreds of them on the
Internet<00:03:21.640> some<00:03:22.420> are<00:03:22.540> free<00:03:22.780> some<00:03:22.810> you<00:03:23.140> have<00:03:23.230> to

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350 
Internet some are free some you have to

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:27.150 
Internet some are free some you have to
buy<00:03:23.730> but<00:03:24.730> as<00:03:25.690> you<00:03:25.810> can<00:03:25.930> see<00:03:25.990> I've<00:03:26.350> got<00:03:26.530> a<00:03:26.830> couple

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
buy but as you can see I've got a couple

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.210 
buy but as you can see I've got a couple
here<00:03:27.670> and<00:03:27.880> then<00:03:28.420> there's<00:03:29.260> also<00:03:29.440> monsters<00:03:30.040> I've

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
here and then there's also monsters I've

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.890 
here and then there's also monsters I've
got<00:03:30.340> an<00:03:30.459> owl<00:03:30.640> bear<00:03:30.940> over<00:03:31.209> here<00:03:31.570> and<00:03:32.250> I<00:03:33.250> will<00:03:34.180> now

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900

got an owl bear over here and I will now
show<00:03:35.290> you<00:03:35.320> how<00:03:35.500> the<00:03:36.310> system<00:03:36.790> actually<00:03:37.030> works

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
show you how the system actually works

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:39.960 
show you how the system actually works
