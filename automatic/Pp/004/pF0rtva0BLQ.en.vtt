00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:11.220
 despite the call of this press conference that he aims to 

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:15.180
 only the central military to seat it before the media 

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:19.100
 and through you or harshly before the citizens of the country the amendment to 

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.679
 the totality that I have registered this morning 

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:25.369
 to the financing project of the radio television corporation 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:32.009
 Spanish was a legend to the totality that we have presented as I tell you in the 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.710
 today after having requested two expansions of the term chávez is the 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.020
 Government decided that the processing of this law was for urgency 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.300
 the first base action so that what to do is that prejudices a 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.980
 absolutely unjustified urgency 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.460
 not unjustified from the political point of view that is not whether I will explain them 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:53.850
 then because he considered that politically 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.730
 is not justified but unjustified from the point of view also of the 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.799
 own processing the government has not given any argument 

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:04.920
 certainly in favor of urgency the last thing that the public said 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.359
 government by mouth of the vice president first maría teresa fernández de la 

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:10.580
 vega was precisely the opposite 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.630
 that they were not going to consider this issue urgently that they are going to 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.090
 establish radical modifications from the point of view of the 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:18.190
 financing 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:23.040
 that what but Spain wanted to leave a radio television model 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.250
 Spanish television 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.710
 similar to the official model ico a la bbc 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.119
 and you in you 'bat in the last public gatherings of the 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:33.870
 vice president nested just in the opposite direction 

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:37.050
 of what has been after the draft bill presented on 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.539
 Bill presented this as I tell you 

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:44.869
 in the letter they dedicate we have amended to the total asking 

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:52.089
 the return to for it not for a more sedate debate serene weather by 

00:01:52.089 --> 00:01:53.690
 hundreds 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:58.580
 two only for two issues would enrich the sentence in my opinion is 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.710
 justified in the trial the amendment to the entire 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.000
 the first one is the one that briefly highlighted explain is not 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.640
 justified in no way the urgency 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.750
 and therefore that same would make the law should be in as it has 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.179
 arrived rejected 

00:02:12.179 --> 00:02:16.839
 percent and the second one is because with a trick 

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:19.640
 unfit for a right or serious state 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.900
 percent and you want to change through this law that is called of 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.090
 financing of Spanish radio-television 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.739
 the model of our Spanish radio television the model that we saw 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:31.619
 through the 2006 law 

00:02:31.619 --> 00:02:36.479
 which are intended to be modified without discussing, above all, the question on the merits 

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:40.369
 of the issue and modifying it by mega-modifying the financing the 

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:43.619
 funding I merely say in quotes because that's what the 

00:02:43.619 --> 00:02:44.909
 government explains us 

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:48.470
 we're just going to modify the financing modify the financing of the 

00:02:48.469 --> 00:02:51.979
 Spanish public broadcasting is to load the public television network 

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:54.559
 Spanish is painfully loading the model 

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:58.710
 that one can modify the model by discussing the model as a whole 

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:00.339
 but modify only 

00:03:00.339 --> 00:03:05.509
 the financing of the public radio-television is a bet to charge what 

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:08.650
 that public television itself is the public television network itself 

00:03:08.649 --> 00:03:11.359
 load the public service 

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:16.280
 what a public service means, I love doing it in short 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.550
 from the beginning to the end and s 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:23.160
 not only will it be the end if this one if it pretends to go ahead if not 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.290
 if they allow me although this naturally does not stop being a hostage of subjective and not 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.800
 ceases to be a presumption by me and on my part as I do not believe that the 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:34.230
 government is unaware of what it is doing I think it's a 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:35.419
 strategy 

00:03:35.419 --> 00:03:38.419
 and it means also accidents a strategy 

00:03:39.029 --> 00:03:42.539
 end with a public service of Spanish television radio 

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:48.109
 of the citizens as a whole because it serves the 100 of the 

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:49.119
 citizens 

00:03:49.119 --> 00:03:53.789
 we have submitted a totality amendment has you is who to send 

00:03:53.789 --> 00:03:57.099
 that this end very buck 

00:03:57.099 --> 00:04:00.149
 in which we explain practically 

00:04:00.149 --> 00:04:04.579
 all the issues that in our opinion the closing wants to sell its 

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:07.569
 modification or justify their return without prejudice to the 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:09.209
 partial amendments that also 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:10.840
 percent we have presented 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:15.750
 and I'm going to tell you in summary 16 points what are the issues that 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:18.029
 about which I want to draw your attention 

00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:22.379
 first of all that the art to which the current the bill the piola the 

00:04:22.379 --> 00:04:23.670
 European directives 

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:25.580
 I believe that this is a consideration 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.990
 that it is also worthwhile to be taken into account 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:32.710
 the competition curator lived reding has already been positioned against 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:34.880
 French law l by the way 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.939
 on which the Spanish law is based 

00:04:36.939 --> 00:04:38.610
 the law of sarkozy 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:42.950
 s of the law on which this law and this bill have been based 

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:48.120
 i those laws the one that already when finding it the rejection of the commission of the commissioner 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.510
 european viviane reding european directives 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:54.110
 imposes the previous information to those affected and a period of allegations 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:59.130
 to avoid harm and also prohibits financing is crossed 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:03.510
 between sectors argued in our opinion and it is seen that it will make 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:07.900
 Operators based the resource in France and then in Spain system 

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.389
 go ahead first question so much 

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:12.730
 this is a bill and this would be a law 

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:17.290
 which violates European directives the second consideration in relation to 

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:18.289
 this first 

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:21.229
 So there is only one country in France 

00:05:21.229 --> 00:05:25.309
 as I told you in which your government approved a few months ago a project that 

00:05:25.309 --> 00:05:29.020
 contemplates charging operators with more of the Spanish model that we 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:32.099
 submits to consideration this government has called socialist 

00:05:32.099 --> 00:05:36.189
 these the operators have protested has refused to make the first payment have 

00:05:36.189 --> 00:05:37.620
 resorted to the European Union 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:42.410
 and the likelihood is that they win the lawsuit to the Gallic government the vice president the 

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:44.419
 vice president maría teresa fernández de la vega 

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:47.659
 I did not do the truth when he says that this law is applied says 

00:05:47.659 --> 00:05:51.270
 verbatim in quotes in other countries around us 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:55.360
 it's not true it only happens in france and it happens in france with this degree of 

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:56.570
 legal uncertainty 

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:58.150
 in which most likely 

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:00.199
 france will lose this writing 

00:06:00.199 --> 00:06:01.169
 before European communities
