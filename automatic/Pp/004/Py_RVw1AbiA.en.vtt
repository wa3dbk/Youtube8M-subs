something<00:03:29.850> away<00:03:30.060> from<00:03:30.239> this<00:03:30.510> it's<00:03:30.959> just<00:03:31.110> very

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
something away from this it's just very

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.680 
something away from this it's just very
difficult<00:03:32.280> it's<00:03:32.459> not<00:03:32.549> being<00:03:32.970> negative<00:03:33.180> it's

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
difficult it's not being negative it's

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.199
