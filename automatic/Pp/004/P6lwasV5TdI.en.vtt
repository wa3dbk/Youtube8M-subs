00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:40.379
 as well as Provencal herbs 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:43.340

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.940
 then add two tablespoons there 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:55.890
 never stop interfering 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:04:02.819
 gently extend 300 milliliters 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:04.890
 cold water then knead our dough 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:07.040
 hands and white beautiful soft lump 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:07.040

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:23.830
 two parts so that one chad was bigger 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:30.280
 another how much more more 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:39.850
 Once and a half fine now we pour on 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:42.639
 table flour put on the table a little lump 

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:45.300
 sprinkle it with flour and smooth it with 

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:45.300
 rolling pin help 

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:54.780
 Claire you two and lumps dough, too, clearly 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:58.520
 it would be faster to do it at the same time 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:58.520
 but we only have one 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:07.320
 the dough should be more chicken by 5 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.860
 centimeters around the contour well done 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:11.070
 Clare 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:13.220
 and here is my second secret when we have 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:18.380
 no rolling pin can use bottle 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:21.470
 bob now put the dough layers on a rolling pin and 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:32.700
 roll out and on the trail 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:33.270
 are you sure that there is no hole then you can 

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:42.690
 patch 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:45.960
 the aroma should not evaporate until 

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:47.730
 put it on the chicken 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:49.380
 should completely covers the bird and 

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:51.600
 touch the dough which lies on 

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:53.640
 pan and great now when 

00:05:51.600 --> 00:06:00.840
 using your fingers to glue both pieces of dough 

00:05:53.640 --> 00:06:04.520
 among themselves without holes is very important holes 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:07.260
 not allowed and now in the oven 

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:10.620
 put our chicken tray in the slots 

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:11.930
 lower tier and leave it there for 1 hour 

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:16.190
 10 minutes 

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:18.020
 and now the boys are getting away from especially 

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:18.800
 our dear dad who is here so 

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:22.310
 annoyed 

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:24.770
 and at this time she remembers the secrets to 

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:27.440
 our chicken turned out a costume very 

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:29.810
 tight need for 35 years and 2 canteens 

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:31.759
 spoons itself spinning does not add taste 

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:36.020
 but not to quarrel with his younger 

00:06:31.759 --> 00:06:38.479
 baking out another secret quality 

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:45.289
 additional brackets can be used 

00:06:38.479 --> 00:06:46.729
 a bottle is okay 

00:06:45.289 --> 00:06:50.000
 fried crust which is not surprising 

00:06:46.729 --> 00:06:51.759
 after so long cooking on 

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:57.349
 the result will not affect it 

00:06:51.759 --> 00:07:05.810
 how much study I learned h1 can be broken 

00:06:57.349 --> 00:07:07.400
 hammer but everywhere there are crumbs and we 

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:08.389
 risk damaging the crisp 

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:10.820
 Chicken 

00:07:08.389 --> 00:07:17.389
 there is another way to cut the crust in 

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:19.960
 the base and take it off as a hat you can 

00:07:17.389 --> 00:07:31.690
 cut a piece of cotton to try 

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:31.690
