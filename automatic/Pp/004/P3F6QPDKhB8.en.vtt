out something I just noticed that on my
diagrams<00:00:13.379> diagrams<00:00:14.379> 48<00:00:15.010> through<00:00:15.340> 50<00:00:15.879> you<00:00:16.690> also

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:16.990 
diagrams diagrams 48 through 50 you also

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:19.080 
diagrams diagrams 48 through 50 you also
have<00:00:17.140> a<00:00:17.170> duplication<00:00:17.830> of<00:00:18.070> the<00:00:18.190> flat<00:00:18.460> 7<00:00:18.940> that<00:00:19.060> I

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:19.090 
have a duplication of the flat 7 that I

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:22.710 
have a duplication of the flat 7 that I
didn't<00:00:19.450> write<00:00:19.660> in<00:00:20.490> you<00:00:21.490> because<00:00:21.970> the<00:00:22.119> one<00:00:22.330> is

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:22.720 
didn't write in you because the one is

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.130 
didn't write in you because the one is
right<00:00:22.929> there<00:00:23.109> in<00:00:23.140> the<00:00:23.230> 10th<00:00:23.500> fret<00:00:24.119> the<00:00:25.119> G<00:00:25.420> the

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:26.140 
right there in the 10th fret the G the

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:28.800 
right there in the 10th fret the G the
flat<00:00:26.380> 7<00:00:26.830> is<00:00:27.699> in<00:00:27.849> the<00:00:27.939> 8th<00:00:28.060> fret<00:00:28.330> as<00:00:28.449> well<00:00:28.630> as

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:28.810 
flat 7 is in the 8th fret as well as

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:30.359 
flat 7 is in the 8th fret as well as
being<00:00:29.050> in<00:00:29.170> the<00:00:29.289> 12th<00:00:29.589> fret<00:00:29.710> of<00:00:29.800> the<00:00:29.980> 3rd<00:00:30.250> string

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:30.369 
being in the 12th fret of the 3rd string

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:33.060

the charts when we get to print ease but
i<00:00:37.360> didn't<00:00:37.750> explain<00:00:38.320> that<00:00:38.620> because<00:00:38.829> what<00:00:39.160> that

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:39.190 
i didn't explain that because what that

diagram<00:00:58.149> 51<00:00:58.719> we<00:00:58.930> have<00:00:59.140> the<00:00:59.260> melodic<00:00:59.649> minor

00:00:59.939 --> 00:00:59.949 
diagram 51 we have the melodic minor

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:03.000 
diagram 51 we have the melodic minor
scale<00:01:00.160> and<00:01:01.050> this<00:01:02.050> works<00:01:02.289> out<00:01:02.440> really<00:01:02.710> nice

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.010 
scale and this works out really nice

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.360 
scale and this works out really nice

wasn't an awkward course suddenly gets

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:11.280 
wasn't an awkward course suddenly gets
much<00:01:09.040> more<00:01:09.280> comfortable<00:01:10.020> because<00:01:11.020> your

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:18.729 
want to start expanding things you can

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:21.270 
want to start expanding things you can
stretch<00:01:18.970> back<00:01:19.240> and<00:01:19.420> capture<00:01:19.570> that<00:01:19.869> to<00:01:20.140> be<00:01:21.130> way

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
stretch back and capture that to be way

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.890 
stretch back and capture that to be way
back<00:01:21.430> there<00:01:21.610> in<00:01:21.670> 27<00:01:22.030> foot<00:01:22.210> so<00:01:22.450> that<00:01:22.509> gives<00:01:22.780> you
