00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:01.680 
if you've been out in any commercial

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:03.710 
if you've been out in any commercial
buildings<00:00:02.010> these<00:00:02.280> days<00:00:02.490> you<00:00:02.790> see<00:00:03.330> a<00:00:03.360> lot<00:00:03.600> of

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:03.720 
buildings these days you see a lot of

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.420 
buildings these days you see a lot of
what<00:00:03.840> are<00:00:03.990> called<00:00:04.020> cloud<00:00:04.650> ceilings<00:00:05.250> and

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
what are called cloud ceilings and

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.940 
what are called cloud ceilings and
that's<00:00:05.580> where<00:00:05.910> there<00:00:06.270> is<00:00:06.569> a<00:00:06.620> drop<00:00:07.620> ceiling

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
that's where there is a drop ceiling

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.009 
that's where there is a drop ceiling
that<00:00:08.309> has<00:00:08.519> gaps<00:00:09.030> around<00:00:09.420> the<00:00:09.570> edges<00:00:09.870> for

example my teas and restaurants where

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.850 
example my teas and restaurants where
there's<00:00:11.940> some<00:00:12.179> kind<00:00:12.360> of<00:00:12.389> a<00:00:12.540> decorative<00:00:13.349> panel

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
there's some kind of a decorative panel

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.150 
there's some kind of a decorative panel

might<00:00:17.310> see<00:00:17.460> in<00:00:17.520> an<00:00:17.640> office<00:00:17.970> space<00:00:18.060> where<00:00:19.130> there

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
might see in an office space where there

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.810 
might see in an office space where there
are<00:00:20.279> large<00:00:21.619> flat<00:00:22.619> square<00:00:23.189> panels<00:00:23.609> with

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
ventilation around the edges and these

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.490 
ventilation around the edges and these
referred<00:00:25.619> to<00:00:25.800> us<00:00:25.980> as<00:00:26.220> clouds<00:00:26.580> and<00:00:27.439> there's<00:00:28.439> a

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
referred to us as clouds and there's a

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.230 
referred to us as clouds and there's a
question<00:00:28.740> right<00:00:28.920> now<00:00:29.099> as<00:00:29.550> to<00:00:29.580> what<00:00:30.000> needs<00:00:30.150> to

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
question right now as to what needs to

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.640 
question right now as to what needs to
be<00:00:30.330> done<00:00:30.420> for<00:00:30.599> a<00:00:30.660> sprinkler<00:00:31.050> protection<00:00:31.500> for

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
be done for a sprinkler protection for

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.470 
be done for a sprinkler protection for
these<00:00:31.769> because<00:00:32.130> clearly<00:00:32.610> you<00:00:33.329> know<00:00:33.450> a

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
these because clearly you know a

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.270 
these because clearly you know a
sprinkler<00:00:33.960> mounted<00:00:34.260> above<00:00:34.469> the<00:00:34.620> clouds<00:00:34.890> is

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
sprinkler mounted above the clouds is

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.670 
sprinkler mounted above the clouds is
going<00:00:35.579> to<00:00:35.760> be<00:00:35.940> you<00:00:36.570> know<00:00:36.660> impacted<00:00:37.230> by<00:00:37.350> having

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
going to be you know impacted by having

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.770 
going to be you know impacted by having
water<00:00:37.890> hit<00:00:38.129> the<00:00:38.160> clouds<00:00:38.940> and<00:00:39.239> I'd<00:00:39.360> actually

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
water hit the clouds and I'd actually

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.660 
water hit the clouds and I'd actually
you<00:00:40.170> know<00:00:40.260> make<00:00:40.739> its<00:00:40.890> way<00:00:41.070> down<00:00:41.250> to<00:00:41.460> floor

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
you know make its way down to floor

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.850 
you know make its way down to floor
level<00:00:42.030> but<00:00:42.960> then<00:00:43.110> it's<00:00:43.230> also<00:00:43.320> a<00:00:43.469> question<00:00:43.800> if

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
level but then it's also a question if

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.799 
level but then it's also a question if
you<00:00:43.980> put<00:00:44.129> a<00:00:44.160> spring<00:00:44.370> below<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.879> cloud<00:00:45.120> will<00:00:45.690> it

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
you put a spring below the cloud will it

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.389 
you put a spring below the cloud will it
activate<00:00:46.230> in<00:00:46.440> time<00:00:46.649> to<00:00:46.890> provide<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.280> level

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
activate in time to provide the level

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.690 
activate in time to provide the level
protection<00:00:47.670> that<00:00:48.090> we<00:00:48.210> desire<00:00:49.010> we<00:00:50.010> did<00:00:50.160> a<00:00:50.219> three

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
protection that we desire we did a three

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.880 
protection that we desire we did a three
phase<00:00:50.850> project<00:00:51.149> which<00:00:51.629> consisted<00:00:52.379> of<00:00:52.469> some

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
phase project which consisted of some

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.650 
phase project which consisted of some
review<00:00:53.160> of<00:00:53.250> prior<00:00:53.460> research<00:00:53.820> we<00:00:54.329> did<00:00:54.449> some

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
review of prior research we did some

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.750 
review of prior research we did some
small-scale<00:00:55.170> testing<00:00:55.620> in<00:00:55.949> our<00:00:56.010> lab<00:00:56.250> facility

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
small-scale testing in our lab facility

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.479 
small-scale testing in our lab facility
here<00:00:57.350> with<00:00:58.350> fires<00:00:58.590> we<00:00:58.859> need<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.070> mock-up<00:00:59.370> of

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
here with fires we need the mock-up of

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.430 
here with fires we need the mock-up of
the<00:00:59.550> cloud<00:00:59.730> ceiling<00:01:00.239> and<00:01:00.480> then<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.690> primary

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
the cloud ceiling and then the primary

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.560 
the cloud ceiling and then the primary
portion<00:01:02.010> of<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.129> project<00:01:02.520> was<00:01:02.730> a<00:01:02.760> large

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
portion of the project was a large

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.520 
portion of the project was a large
matrix<00:01:04.199> of<00:01:04.729> CFD<00:01:05.729> modeling<00:01:05.939> of<00:01:06.420> cloud<00:01:06.990> ceilings

matrix of CFD modeling of cloud ceilings

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.980 
matrix of CFD modeling of cloud ceilings
and<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:08.060> result<00:01:09.060> of<00:01:09.150> this<00:01:09.240> is<00:01:09.390> we<00:01:09.510> collated

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
and the result of this is we collated

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.109 
and the result of this is we collated
all<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.229> data<00:01:10.409> and<00:01:10.530> the<00:01:10.590> results<00:01:10.680> and<00:01:11.280> came<00:01:11.939> up

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
all the data and the results and came up

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.870 
all the data and the results and came up
with<00:01:12.979> conditions<00:01:13.979> where<00:01:14.369> we<00:01:14.520> felt<00:01:14.790> that

sprinklers just below the clouds would
be<00:01:17.610> permissible<00:01:18.150> per<00:01:18.570> code<00:01:18.780> and<00:01:19.020> not<00:01:19.080> that

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
be permissible per code and not that

that sprinklers both above and below in
the<00:01:21.720> end<00:01:21.869> we<00:01:21.990> developed<00:01:22.409> a<00:01:22.500> couple<00:01:22.680> of<00:01:22.860> code

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
the end we developed a couple of code
