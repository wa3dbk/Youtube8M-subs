caps<00:02:32.680> in<00:02:32.950> my<00:02:33.280> career<00:02:33.670> I<00:02:33.910> found<00:02:34.180> out<00:02:34.360> that<00:02:34.480> you

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
caps in my career I found out that you

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.080 
caps in my career I found out that you
can<00:02:34.960> go<00:02:35.200> above<00:02:35.500> the<00:02:35.710> caps<00:02:35.980> but<00:02:36.640> you<00:02:36.730> have<00:02:36.910> to

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
can go above the caps but you have to

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.390 
can go above the caps but you have to
use<00:02:37.300> VC<00:02:37.960> on<00:02:38.200> these<00:02:38.440> things<00:02:38.740> called<00:02:39.010> stat

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
use VC on these things called stat

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.520 
use VC on these things called stat
increases<00:02:40.120> and<00:02:40.450> they<00:02:40.720> only<00:02:40.900> last<00:02:41.260> for<00:02:41.380> a

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
increases and they only last for a

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:42.600 
increases and they only last for a
certain<00:02:41.830> amount<00:02:41.890> of<00:02:42.100> game<00:02:42.280> so<00:02:42.490> I<00:02:42.520> think

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
certain amount of game so I think

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.490 
certain amount of game so I think
there's<00:02:42.910> three<00:02:43.030> levels<00:02:43.480> you<00:02:43.570> can<00:02:43.720> spend

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
there's three levels you can spend

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.160 
there's three levels you can spend
something<00:02:44.710> like<00:02:44.950> 60<00:02:45.370> or<00:02:45.400> 70<00:02:45.790> VC<00:02:46.180> to<00:02:46.810> increase

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
something like 60 or 70 VC to increase

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.430 
something like 60 or 70 VC to increase
your<00:02:47.350> stats<00:02:47.680> by<00:02:47.890> 10<00:02:48.280> for<00:02:48.580> one<00:02:48.820> game<00:02:49.090> or<00:02:49.570> you<00:02:50.260> can

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.080 
your stats by 10 for one game or you can
spend<00:02:50.740> something<00:02:51.010> like<00:02:51.250> 200<00:02:51.820> and<00:02:51.940> something

attribute so if you do let's say you

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.620 
attribute so if you do let's say you

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
want to get a +10 and three point you

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.410 
want to get a +10 and three point you
have<00:03:13.780> to<00:03:13.930> spend<00:03:14.310> 460<00:03:15.310> VC<00:03:15.670> to<00:03:15.790> do<00:03:15.940> that<00:03:16.120> and<00:03:16.330> then

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
have to spend 460 VC to do that and then

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:17.520 
have to spend 460 VC to do that and then
let's<00:03:16.600> say<00:03:16.690> you<00:03:16.720> want<00:03:16.960> to<00:03:17.020> do<00:03:17.080> the<00:03:17.170> same<00:03:17.320> thing

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
let's say you want to do the same thing

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:18.930 
let's say you want to do the same thing
for<00:03:17.650> your<00:03:17.770> speed<00:03:18.070> you're<00:03:18.520> going<00:03:18.550> to<00:03:18.730> have<00:03:18.820> to

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
for your speed you're going to have to

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:20.790 
for your speed you're going to have to
spend<00:03:19.150> another<00:03:19.330> 400<00:03:20.200> in<00:03:20.320> something<00:03:20.590> so<00:03:20.740> you

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:20.800 
spend another 400 in something so you

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.340 
spend another 400 in something so you
can<00:03:21.240> get<00:03:22.240> to<00:03:22.450> those<00:03:22.570> levels<00:03:22.960> but<00:03:23.110> you're<00:03:23.260> going

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350 
can get to those levels but you're going

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:26.730 
can get to those levels but you're going
to<00:03:23.410> be<00:03:23.560> using<00:03:24.010> a<00:03:24.130> lot<00:03:24.640> of<00:03:24.670> VC<00:03:25.480> to<00:03:25.660> do<00:03:25.840> it<00:03:26.050> so<00:03:26.710> I

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:26.740 
to be using a lot of VC to do it so I

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:29.520 
to be using a lot of VC to do it so I
still<00:03:27.160> think<00:03:27.460> that<00:03:27.520> 2k13<00:03:28.240> is<00:03:28.600> version<00:03:29.020> where

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
still think that 2k13 is version where

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.250 
still think that 2k13 is version where

you<00:03:33.250> know<00:03:33.370> 90<00:03:33.940> like<00:03:34.120> so<00:03:34.300> depending<00:03:34.990> on<00:03:35.080> what

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
you know 90 like so depending on what

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.600 
you know 90 like so depending on what
your<00:03:35.350> position<00:03:35.500> was<00:03:35.800> obviously<00:03:36.400> some<00:03:36.580> things

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:36.610 
your position was obviously some things

work<00:03:36.940> at<00:03:37.120> low<00:03:37.390> like<00:03:37.720> whatever<00:03:38.560> position<00:03:38.860> you

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
work at low like whatever position you

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:40.260 
work at low like whatever position you
were<00:03:39.130> playing<00:03:39.340> some<00:03:39.550> things<00:03:39.760> were<00:03:39.880> capped<00:03:40.120> at

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:40.270

6070 you know this year even your own

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:45.660 
6070 you know this year even your own
position<00:03:43.480> they<00:03:43.600> capture<00:03:44.020> you<00:03:44.080> at<00:03:44.200> 92<00:03:44.860> and<00:03:45.190> so<00:03:45.640> I

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 
position they capture you at 92 and so I

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:47.430
