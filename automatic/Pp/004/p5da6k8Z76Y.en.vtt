00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 
different apps for each device it will

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:22.860 
different apps for each device it will
grilled<00:04:16.510> it<00:04:16.690> there<00:04:16.900> and<00:04:17.610> you<00:04:21.300> can<00:04:22.300> try<00:04:22.570> the<00:04:22.630> app

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:22.870 
grilled it there and you can try the app

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:25.050 
grilled it there and you can try the app
star<00:04:23.200> well<00:04:23.950> that<00:04:24.070> runs<00:04:24.280> differently<00:04:24.490> on<00:04:24.850> both

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.060 
star well that runs differently on both

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:26.310 
star well that runs differently on both
side<00:04:25.300> then<00:04:25.420> if<00:04:25.540> that<00:04:25.690> will<00:04:25.840> be<00:04:25.960> crushed<00:04:26.110> this

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320 
side then if that will be crushed this

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:31.650 
side then if that will be crushed this
fair<00:04:26.590> but<00:04:26.830> i<00:04:26.890> can<00:04:27.100> try<00:04:28.950> ipad<00:04:29.950> is<00:04:29.980> done<00:04:30.660> iphones

00:04:38.439 --> 00:04:38.449 
so the ipad is clearly very much faster

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:43.959 
so the ipad is clearly very much faster
than<00:04:38.599> the<00:04:38.809> iphone<00:04:39.229> 3gs<00:04:39.949> and<00:04:42.969> distracting

00:04:43.959 --> 00:04:43.969 
than the iphone 3gs and distracting

00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:45.339
