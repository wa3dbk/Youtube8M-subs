alright<00:00:03.959> scrappers<00:00:04.440> Virginia<00:00:04.950> here<00:00:05.130> so<00:00:05.310> now

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:05.490 
alright scrappers Virginia here so now

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:06.860 
alright scrappers Virginia here so now
we're<00:00:05.609> gonna<00:00:05.700> go<00:00:05.940> over<00:00:06.180> a<00:00:06.210> couple<00:00:06.420> different

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
we're gonna go over a couple different

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.179 
we're gonna go over a couple different
types<00:00:07.020> of<00:00:07.230> boards<00:00:07.560> that<00:00:07.649> you're<00:00:07.799> gonna<00:00:07.919> come

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
types of boards that you're gonna come

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.339 
types of boards that you're gonna come
across<00:00:08.309> when<00:00:08.730> scrapping<00:00:09.300> we're<00:00:09.960> gonna<00:00:10.050> start

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
across when scrapping we're gonna start

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.350 
across when scrapping we're gonna start
off<00:00:10.469> with<00:00:10.500> the<00:00:10.740> higher<00:00:10.950> price<00:00:11.280> items<00:00:11.730> we're

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
off with the higher price items we're

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.879 
off with the higher price items we're
gonna<00:00:12.450> start<00:00:12.750> off<00:00:12.870> here<00:00:13.049> with<00:00:13.110> a<00:00:13.320> hard<00:00:13.590> drive

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
gonna start off here with a hard drive

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.189 
gonna start off here with a hard drive
so<00:00:14.429> a<00:00:14.460> lot<00:00:14.820> of<00:00:14.940> times<00:00:15.150> we<00:00:15.450> say<00:00:15.809> that<00:00:16.049> you<00:00:16.170> can

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
so a lot of times we say that you can

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.170 
so a lot of times we say that you can
actually<00:00:16.350> take<00:00:16.890> this<00:00:17.039> entire<00:00:17.220> hard<00:00:17.640> drive<00:00:17.730> and

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
actually take this entire hard drive and

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.870 
actually take this entire hard drive and
scrap<00:00:18.630> it<00:00:18.810> as<00:00:18.960> is<00:00:19.260> but<00:00:19.949> a<00:00:20.189> lot<00:00:20.400> of<00:00:20.550> people<00:00:20.789> if

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
scrap it as is but a lot of people if

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.580 
scrap it as is but a lot of people if
they<00:00:21.029> have<00:00:21.180> a<00:00:21.210> lot<00:00:21.510> of<00:00:21.630> them<00:00:21.779> like<00:00:22.260> to<00:00:22.410> take

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
they have a lot of them like to take

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.980 
they have a lot of them like to take
these<00:00:22.769> boards<00:00:23.250> off<00:00:23.400> these<00:00:24.029> boards<00:00:24.539> here<00:00:24.750> are

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
these boards off these boards here are

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.330 
these boards off these boards here are
going<00:00:25.170> to<00:00:25.230> be<00:00:25.350> worth<00:00:25.560> some<00:00:25.949> of<00:00:26.070> the<00:00:26.130> higher

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
going to be worth some of the higher

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.490 
going to be worth some of the higher
priced<00:00:26.730> boards<00:00:27.420> when<00:00:27.599> you're<00:00:27.750> scrapping<00:00:28.289> a

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
priced boards when you're scrapping a

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.470 
priced boards when you're scrapping a
waste<00:00:28.789> basically<00:00:29.789> because<00:00:30.060> they<00:00:30.210> have<00:00:30.359> the

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
waste basically because they have the

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.900 
waste basically because they have the
most<00:00:30.689> gold<00:00:30.960> content<00:00:31.439> in<00:00:31.650> them<00:00:31.800> so<00:00:32.130> if<00:00:32.399> you<00:00:32.669> are

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
most gold content in them so if you are

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.370 
most gold content in them so if you are
gonna<00:00:33.059> pop<00:00:33.329> these<00:00:33.510> off<00:00:33.719> there's<00:00:33.989> usually<00:00:34.170> a

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
gonna pop these off there's usually a

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.110 
gonna pop these off there's usually a
couple<00:00:34.649> screws<00:00:35.190> that<00:00:35.399> are<00:00:35.550> on<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:35.730> corners

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
couple screws that are on the corners

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.030 
couple screws that are on the corners
that<00:00:36.270> you<00:00:36.360> can<00:00:36.510> just<00:00:36.719> take<00:00:37.350> it<00:00:37.530> right<00:00:37.649> out<00:00:37.710> with

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
that you can just take it right out with

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.979 
that you can just take it right out with
a<00:00:38.070> power<00:00:38.340> drill<00:00:38.760> and<00:00:38.790> you'll<00:00:39.570> be<00:00:39.690> able<00:00:39.809> to

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
a power drill and you'll be able to

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.840 
a power drill and you'll be able to
scrap<00:00:40.260> those<00:00:40.500> and<00:00:40.680> collect<00:00:40.950> those<00:00:41.100> separately

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
scrap those and collect those separately

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.420 
scrap those and collect those separately
moving<00:00:42.750> on<00:00:42.870> to<00:00:43.079> some<00:00:43.290> hard<00:00:43.590> are<00:00:43.890> some

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
moving on to some hard are some

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.270 
moving on to some hard are some
motherboards<00:00:45.390> that<00:00:45.450> we<00:00:45.629> have<00:00:45.840> here<00:00:46.200> these<00:00:46.950> two

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
motherboards that we have here these two

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.100 
motherboards that we have here these two
types<00:00:47.579> of<00:00:47.760> boards<00:00:48.059> are<00:00:48.450> both<00:00:48.719> going<00:00:49.020> to<00:00:49.050> be

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
types of boards are both going to be

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.200 
types of boards are both going to be
worth<00:00:49.350> more<00:00:49.379> money<00:00:49.980> they're<00:00:50.640> gonna<00:00:50.730> be<00:00:50.969> around

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
worth more money they're gonna be around

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.850 
worth more money they're gonna be around
a<00:00:51.360> motherboard<00:00:51.660> price<00:00:52.170> because<00:00:52.620> of<00:00:52.649> the

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
a motherboard price because of the

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.619 
a motherboard price because of the
amount<00:00:53.100> of<00:00:53.190> Gold's<00:00:53.579> contacts<00:00:54.149> that<00:00:54.360> are<00:00:54.510> in

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
amount of Gold's contacts that are in

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.139 
amount of Gold's contacts that are in
them<00:00:54.840> and<00:00:55.079> to<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.219> ratio<00:00:56.430> of<00:00:56.699> amount<00:00:57.059> of

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
them and to the ratio of amount of

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.450 
them and to the ratio of amount of
plastic<00:00:57.660> so<00:00:57.899> if<00:00:58.109> if<00:00:58.289> you<00:00:58.559> take<00:00:58.770> this<00:00:58.920> first<00:00:59.219> one

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
plastic so if if you take this first one

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.150 
plastic so if if you take this first one
for<00:00:59.670> example<00:00:59.840> those<00:01:00.840> different<00:01:01.410> contacts<00:01:02.039> are

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
for example those different contacts are

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.820 
for example those different contacts are
all<00:01:02.430> gold<00:01:03.270> in<00:01:03.420> there<00:01:03.600> same<00:01:04.290> thing<00:01:04.320> with<00:01:04.680> these

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
all gold in there same thing with these

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.160 
all gold in there same thing with these
here<00:01:04.890> so<00:01:05.489> inside<00:01:05.970> of<00:01:06.150> each<00:01:06.299> of<00:01:06.450> these<00:01:06.570> contacts

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
here so inside of each of these contacts

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.980 
here so inside of each of these contacts
there<00:01:07.500> are<00:01:07.590> some<00:01:07.770> gold<00:01:07.979> if<00:01:08.159> you<00:01:08.189> flip<00:01:08.520> it<00:01:08.610> over

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 
there are some gold if you flip it over

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.330 
there are some gold if you flip it over
there's<00:01:09.990> actually<00:01:10.470> going<00:01:10.619> to<00:01:10.770> be<00:01:10.890> some<00:01:11.100> more

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
there's actually going to be some more

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.969 
there's actually going to be some more
gold<00:01:11.610> contacts<00:01:12.180> on<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.479> other<00:01:12.600> side<00:01:12.930> so<00:01:13.590> even

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
gold contacts on the other side so even

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.140 
gold contacts on the other side so even
though<00:01:14.070> it<00:01:14.220> looks<00:01:14.369> like<00:01:14.460> there's<00:01:14.700> a<00:01:14.760> lot<00:01:15.000> of

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
though it looks like there's a lot of

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.179 
though it looks like there's a lot of
plastic<00:01:15.659> here<00:01:15.840> there's<00:01:16.140> enough<00:01:16.439> gold<00:01:16.740> here<00:01:16.890> to

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
plastic here there's enough gold here to

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.820 
plastic here there's enough gold here to
make<00:01:17.369> this<00:01:17.549> a<00:01:17.610> higher<00:01:18.060> price<00:01:18.540> item<00:01:19.020> and<00:01:19.290> close

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
make this a higher price item and close

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.999 
make this a higher price item and close
to<00:01:20.040> a<00:01:20.070> motherboard<00:01:20.490> price<00:01:21.320> over<00:01:22.320> here<00:01:22.619> we<00:01:22.860> have

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
to a motherboard price over here we have

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.010 
to a motherboard price over here we have
a<00:01:23.040> motherboard<00:01:23.430> right<00:01:23.820> here<00:01:24.240> that<00:01:24.840> has

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
a motherboard right here that has

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.539 
a motherboard right here that has
everything<00:01:25.350> stripped<00:01:25.799> off<00:01:25.950> and<00:01:26.189> we've<00:01:26.340> showed

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
everything stripped off and we've showed

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:27.920 
everything stripped off and we've showed
you<00:01:26.580> that<00:01:26.850> in<00:01:27.000> other<00:01:27.150> videos<00:01:27.570> you<00:01:27.780> know<00:01:27.900> the

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
you that in other videos you know the

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.679 
you that in other videos you know the
CPU<00:01:28.500> chip<00:01:28.770> is<00:01:28.920> taken<00:01:29.280> out<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:30.060> aluminum<00:01:30.509> heat

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
CPU chip is taken out the aluminum heat

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.899 
CPU chip is taken out the aluminum heat
sinks<00:01:31.079> are<00:01:31.200> all<00:01:31.320> taken<00:01:31.710> off<00:01:31.860> so<00:01:32.460> these<00:01:32.700> are

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
sinks are all taken off so these are

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.640 
sinks are all taken off so these are
also<00:01:33.119> going<00:01:33.420> to<00:01:33.479> be<00:01:33.630> worth<00:01:33.840> at<00:01:34.049> a<00:01:34.079> higher<00:01:34.290> price

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
also going to be worth at a higher price

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.090 
also going to be worth at a higher price

item for mother for boards because of

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.429 
item for mother for boards because of
the<00:01:38.159> gold<00:01:38.400> contacts<00:01:38.970> all<00:01:39.270> of<00:01:39.509> these<00:01:39.689> contacts

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
the gold contacts all of these contacts

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.850 
the gold contacts all of these contacts
here<00:01:40.799> have<00:01:41.340> gold<00:01:41.700> inside<00:01:42.090> all<00:01:42.630> of<00:01:43.170> these<00:01:43.409> here

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
here have gold inside all of these here

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.980 
here have gold inside all of these here
that's<00:01:44.640> where<00:01:44.850> you'd<00:01:45.000> store<00:01:45.329> your<00:01:45.540> RAM<00:01:45.750> memory

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
that's where you'd store your RAM memory

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.899 
that's where you'd store your RAM memory
so<00:01:46.500> all<00:01:46.740> of<00:01:46.920> that<00:01:47.070> is<00:01:47.220> all<00:01:47.460> gonna<00:01:47.640> have

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
so all of that is all gonna have

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.600 
so all of that is all gonna have
different<00:01:48.649> gold<00:01:49.649> contacts<00:01:50.189> that<00:01:50.310> are<00:01:50.460> going

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
different gold contacts that are going

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.069 
different gold contacts that are going
to<00:01:50.670> make<00:01:50.820> the<00:01:50.939> board<00:01:51.180> worth<00:01:51.420> more<00:01:51.720> money

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
to make the board worth more money

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.469 
to make the board worth more money
moving<00:01:52.950> on<00:01:53.070> to<00:01:53.250> some<00:01:53.460> lower<00:01:53.670> priced<00:01:54.060> items

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
moving on to some lower priced items

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.069 
moving on to some lower priced items
these<00:01:55.079> low<00:01:55.439> grade<00:01:55.740> boards<00:01:56.810> aren't<00:01:57.810> going<00:01:57.990> to

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
these low grade boards aren't going to

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.200 
these low grade boards aren't going to
be<00:01:58.170> priced<00:01:58.439> nearly<00:01:58.920> as<00:01:59.070> much<00:01:59.250> as<00:01:59.310> a<00:01:59.640> hot<00:01:59.909> as<00:02:00.149> a

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
be priced nearly as much as a hot as a

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.120 
be priced nearly as much as a hot as a
higher<00:02:00.540> grade<00:02:00.869> like<00:02:01.140> a<00:02:01.170> motherboard<00:02:01.860> or<00:02:02.100> a

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
higher grade like a motherboard or a

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.340 
higher grade like a motherboard or a
hard<00:02:02.399> drive<00:02:02.490> basically<00:02:03.329> due<00:02:03.869> to<00:02:04.049> the<00:02:04.140> fact

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
hard drive basically due to the fact

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.319 
hard drive basically due to the fact
that<00:02:04.469> they<00:02:04.649> have<00:02:04.829> a<00:02:05.040> lot<00:02:05.280> less<00:02:05.549> gold<00:02:05.790> inside<00:02:06.180> of

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
that they have a lot less gold inside of

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.119 
that they have a lot less gold inside of
them<00:02:06.450> and<00:02:06.659> there<00:02:06.780> are<00:02:06.840> a<00:02:06.869> lot<00:02:07.049> more<00:02:07.079> plastic<00:02:07.860> if

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
them and there are a lot more plastic if

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:09.889 
them and there are a lot more plastic if
you<00:02:08.610> take<00:02:08.819> a<00:02:08.849> look<00:02:09.090> there's<00:02:09.330> not<00:02:09.509> too<00:02:09.720> much

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
you take a look there's not too much

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.930 
you take a look there's not too much
gold<00:02:10.259> contacts<00:02:11.009> that<00:02:11.220> you<00:02:11.280> can<00:02:11.489> see<00:02:11.700> through

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
gold contacts that you can see through

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:12.930 
gold contacts that you can see through
here<00:02:12.180> a<00:02:12.390> lot

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
here a lot

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.070 
here a lot
these<00:02:13.030> little<00:02:13.210> things<00:02:13.540> you're<00:02:13.750> gonna<00:02:13.840> see

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
these little things you're gonna see

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.210 
these little things you're gonna see
here<00:02:14.230> that<00:02:14.380> make<00:02:14.530> it<00:02:14.650> look<00:02:14.800> like<00:02:14.920> it's<00:02:15.130> a

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
here that make it look like it's a

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.640 
here that make it look like it's a
little<00:02:15.340> city<00:02:15.670> are<00:02:16.060> actually<00:02:16.750> capacitor<00:02:17.410> so

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
little city are actually capacitor so

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.200 
little city are actually capacitor so
those<00:02:17.830> aren't<00:02:18.160> gonna<00:02:18.250> really<00:02:18.520> be<00:02:18.760> too<00:02:19.000> many

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:19.210 
those aren't gonna really be too many

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:21.180 
those aren't gonna really be too many
there's<00:02:19.990> not<00:02:20.140> going<00:02:20.230> to<00:02:20.290> be<00:02:20.350> too<00:02:20.590> much<00:02:20.740> gold<00:02:20.980> on

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
there's not going to be too much gold on

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.100 
there's not going to be too much gold on
these<00:02:21.370> boards<00:02:21.640> here<00:02:21.910> and<00:02:22.180> a<00:02:22.570> lot<00:02:22.780> of<00:02:22.900> it<00:02:23.020> is

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
these boards here and a lot of it is

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.660 
these boards here and a lot of it is
gonna<00:02:23.260> be<00:02:23.350> plastic<00:02:23.860> therefore<00:02:24.310> the<00:02:24.430> price

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
gonna be plastic therefore the price

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.660 
gonna be plastic therefore the price
will<00:02:24.880> be<00:02:24.910> a<00:02:25.030> lot<00:02:25.270> lower<00:02:25.680> this<00:02:26.680> large<00:02:27.070> black

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
will be a lot lower this large black

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.910 
will be a lot lower this large black
thing<00:02:28.120> here<00:02:28.480> which<00:02:28.690> is<00:02:28.840> actually<00:02:29.020> a<00:02:29.230> capacitor

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
thing here which is actually a capacitor

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.070 
thing here which is actually a capacitor
you<00:02:30.580> may<00:02:30.730> initially<00:02:31.150> think<00:02:31.630> that<00:02:31.780> that's<00:02:31.930> a

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:32.080 
you may initially think that that's a

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.080 
you may initially think that that's a
type<00:02:32.350> of<00:02:32.380> transformer<00:02:32.920> or<00:02:33.220> something<00:02:33.550> but

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
type of transformer or something but

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.790 
type of transformer or something but
check<00:02:34.390> because<00:02:34.630> sometimes<00:02:35.260> these<00:02:35.470> two<00:02:35.620> have

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
check because sometimes these two have

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.370 
check because sometimes these two have
PCBs<00:02:36.520> inside<00:02:37.000> which<00:02:37.630> are<00:02:37.780> harmful<00:02:38.050> to<00:02:38.200> the

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
PCBs inside which are harmful to the

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:39.450 
PCBs inside which are harmful to the
environment<00:02:38.500> and<00:02:39.070> you<00:02:39.130> don't<00:02:39.310> want<00:02:39.430> to

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:39.460 
environment and you don't want to

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:41.160 
environment and you don't want to
release<00:02:39.790> those<00:02:40.000> types<00:02:40.330> of<00:02:40.510> fluids<00:02:40.990> that<00:02:41.110> are

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
release those types of fluids that are

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:42.990 
release those types of fluids that are
inside<00:02:41.620> so<00:02:41.950> just<00:02:42.010> check<00:02:42.430> with<00:02:42.580> your<00:02:42.700> scrap
