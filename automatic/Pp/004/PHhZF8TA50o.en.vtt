00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
that's more feathery and this clip also

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.060 
that's more feathery and this clip also
matches<00:01:48.479> my<00:01:48.600> outfit<00:01:48.899> I'm<00:01:49.350> going<00:01:49.740> to<00:01:49.860> clip<00:01:50.039> it

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:52.050 
right over the end of the braid so it

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.309 
right over the end of the braid so it
covers<00:01:52.289> a<00:01:52.470> small<00:01:52.830> loss<00:01:53.159> of<00:01:53.310> hair<00:01:53.490> type<00:01:54.140> so<00:01:55.140> I'll
