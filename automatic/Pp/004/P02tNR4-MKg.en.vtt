00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.070 

endurance<00:00:21.520> another<00:00:21.910> major<00:00:22.240> aspect<00:00:22.900> in

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:23.080 
endurance another major aspect in

endurance another major aspect in
preparing<00:00:23.619> yourself<00:00:23.950> before<00:00:24.310> a<00:00:24.340> big<00:00:24.580> hunt<00:00:24.850> now

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:25.570 
preparing yourself before a big hunt now

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:27.060 
preparing yourself before a big hunt now
cardio<00:00:26.020> is<00:00:26.260> one<00:00:26.410> of<00:00:26.500> those<00:00:26.590> things<00:00:26.770> we<00:00:26.950> all

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:27.070 
cardio is one of those things we all

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:28.740 
cardio is one of those things we all
think<00:00:27.310> of<00:00:27.550> as<00:00:27.730> we're<00:00:27.910> preparing<00:00:28.270> for<00:00:28.510> a<00:00:28.540> hunt

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:28.750 
think of as we're preparing for a hunt

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:30.870 
think of as we're preparing for a hunt
and<00:00:28.990> it<00:00:29.680> really<00:00:29.800> does<00:00:30.040> play<00:00:30.250> a<00:00:30.279> vital<00:00:30.520> role<00:00:30.670> in

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:30.880 
and it really does play a vital role in

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.360 
and it really does play a vital role in
how<00:00:31.390> long<00:00:31.420> and<00:00:32.020> how<00:00:32.050> far<00:00:32.860> you're<00:00:33.100> going<00:00:33.220> to<00:00:33.280> be

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:33.370 
how long and how far you're going to be

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.100 
how long and how far you're going to be
able<00:00:33.460> to<00:00:33.610> pursue<00:00:33.910> that<00:00:34.090> animal<00:00:34.510> effectively

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:35.110 
able to pursue that animal effectively

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:37.140 
able to pursue that animal effectively
the<00:00:35.800> reason<00:00:36.129> for<00:00:36.309> cardiovascular<00:00:36.910> endurance

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:37.150 
the reason for cardiovascular endurance

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.660 
the reason for cardiovascular endurance
training<00:00:37.570> is<00:00:37.949> to<00:00:38.949> keep<00:00:39.129> that<00:00:39.370> heart<00:00:39.580> rate

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:39.670 
training is to keep that heart rate

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:41.369 
training is to keep that heart rate
elevated<00:00:39.910> when<00:00:40.780> you're<00:00:40.900> up<00:00:40.989> in<00:00:41.080> the<00:00:41.110> mountains

00:00:41.369 --> 00:00:41.379 
elevated when you're up in the mountains

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:42.750 
elevated when you're up in the mountains
pursuing<00:00:41.770> that<00:00:41.830> animal<00:00:42.190> you're<00:00:42.340> not<00:00:42.489> going<00:00:42.670> to

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:42.760 
pursuing that animal you're not going to

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.939 
pursuing that animal you're not going to
have<00:00:42.970> much<00:00:43.510> time<00:00:43.809> to<00:00:44.320> just<00:00:44.470> stop<00:00:44.680> and<00:00:44.830> take

00:00:44.939 --> 00:00:44.949 
have much time to just stop and take

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:46.950 
have much time to just stop and take
breaks<00:00:45.220> let<00:00:45.430> that<00:00:45.580> heart<00:00:45.790> rate<00:00:45.879> rest<00:00:46.210> so<00:00:46.690> train

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:46.960 
breaks let that heart rate rest so train

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.110 
breaks let that heart rate rest so train
the<00:00:47.110> same<00:00:47.320> way<00:00:47.559> push<00:00:48.370> the<00:00:48.550> heart<00:00:48.730> rate<00:00:48.910> push

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.120 
the same way push the heart rate push

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.700 
the same way push the heart rate push
the<00:00:49.300> heart<00:00:49.480> rate<00:00:49.660> that<00:00:50.080> way<00:00:50.260> you're<00:00:50.590> prepared

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:50.710 
the heart rate that way you're prepared

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.280 
the heart rate that way you're prepared
mentally<00:00:51.280> as<00:00:51.670> well<00:00:51.940> as<00:00:52.180> physically<00:00:52.629> on<00:00:52.839> your

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:53.290 
mentally as well as physically on your

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:55.649 
mentally as well as physically on your
hunt<00:00:53.460> not<00:00:54.460> only<00:00:54.699> thinking<00:00:55.030> about<00:00:55.089> our<00:00:55.360> running

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:55.659 
hunt not only thinking about our running

00:00:55.659 --> 00:00:57.539 
hunt not only thinking about our running
and<00:00:55.780> our<00:00:55.839> hiking<00:00:56.080> and<00:00:56.470> our<00:00:56.860> biking<00:00:57.129> as<00:00:57.430> our

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:57.549 
and our hiking and our biking as our

00:00:57.549 --> 00:01:00.810 
and our hiking and our biking as our
basic<00:00:57.940> cardio<00:00:58.769> examples<00:00:59.769> we<00:01:00.460> can<00:01:00.610> think<00:01:00.699> about

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:00.820 
basic cardio examples we can think about

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.000 
basic cardio examples we can think about
circuit<00:01:01.420> training<00:01:01.659> as<00:01:01.900> well<00:01:01.930> with<00:01:02.559> weights

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.010 
circuit training as well with weights

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:05.280 
circuit training as well with weights
maybe<00:01:03.489> it's<00:01:03.670> just<00:01:03.729> body<00:01:04.089> weight<00:01:04.360> for<00:01:05.140> me

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:05.290 
maybe it's just body weight for me

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:06.960 
maybe it's just body weight for me
circuit<00:01:05.860> training<00:01:06.040> is<00:01:06.250> my<00:01:06.430> favorite<00:01:06.820> way<00:01:06.940> to

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:06.970 
circuit training is my favorite way to

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:09.539 
circuit training is my favorite way to
prepare<00:01:07.840> myself<00:01:07.870> and<00:01:08.590> my<00:01:08.710> cardiovascular

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:09.549 
prepare myself and my cardiovascular

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:11.010 
prepare myself and my cardiovascular
endurance<00:01:09.790> as<00:01:10.120> well<00:01:10.150> as<00:01:10.360> muscular<00:01:10.630> endurance

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020 
endurance as well as muscular endurance

for<00:01:11.590> a<00:01:11.650> big<00:01:11.830> hunt<00:01:12.070> so<00:01:12.880> let<00:01:13.000> me<00:01:13.119> show<00:01:13.270> you<00:01:13.299> a

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:13.420 
for a big hunt so let me show you a

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.330 
for a big hunt so let me show you a
quick<00:01:13.600> example<00:01:13.750> of<00:01:14.260> how<00:01:14.710> circuit<00:01:15.130> training

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340 
quick example of how circuit training

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.280 
quick example of how circuit training
can<00:01:16.180> go<00:01:16.330> and<00:01:16.570> it's<00:01:16.659> seriously<00:01:16.990> just<00:01:17.170> one

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:17.290 
can go and it's seriously just one

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.289 
can go and it's seriously just one
example<00:01:17.409> there's<00:01:17.830> many<00:01:18.070> ways<00:01:18.310> of<00:01:18.610> circuit

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:19.299 
example there's many ways of circuit

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:22.260 
example there's many ways of circuit
training<00:01:19.479> so<00:01:20.140> for<00:01:20.380> me<00:01:20.530> let's<00:01:20.950> go<00:01:21.130> a<00:01:21.369> squat<00:01:21.760> into

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:22.270 
training so for me let's go a squat into

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.959 
training so for me let's go a squat into
a<00:01:22.299> lunge<00:01:22.570> into<00:01:22.930> our<00:01:23.200> push-ups<00:01:23.619> so<00:01:24.579> there's

00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:24.969 
a lunge into our push-ups so there's

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:26.520 
a lunge into our push-ups so there's
many<00:01:25.090> different<00:01:25.210> ways<00:01:25.570> to<00:01:25.869> do<00:01:25.990> this<00:01:26.020> I'm

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:26.530 
many different ways to do this I'm

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:28.679 
many different ways to do this I'm
squatting<00:01:26.920> maybe<00:01:27.670> I'm<00:01:27.939> going<00:01:28.060> to<00:01:28.119> do<00:01:28.240> 15

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:28.689 
squatting maybe I'm going to do 15

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:31.080 
squatting maybe I'm going to do 15
repetitions<00:01:28.899> of<00:01:29.560> squats<00:01:30.280> maybe<00:01:30.729> I'm<00:01:30.909> going<00:01:31.030> to

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
repetitions of squats maybe I'm going to

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.209 
repetitions of squats maybe I'm going to
go<00:01:31.149> 30<00:01:31.479> seconds<00:01:31.899> of<00:01:32.020> squats<00:01:32.350> those<00:01:32.920> are<00:01:33.100> two

00:01:33.209 --> 00:01:33.219 
go 30 seconds of squats those are two

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:35.249 
go 30 seconds of squats those are two
different<00:01:33.250> ways<00:01:33.700> i<00:01:34.000> can<00:01:34.479> cardiovascular

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:35.259 
different ways i can cardiovascular

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:37.139 
different ways i can cardiovascular
train<00:01:35.590> as<00:01:35.799> well<00:01:36.490> as<00:01:36.609> muscular<00:01:36.820> endurance

00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:37.149 
train as well as muscular endurance

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:39.660 
train as well as muscular endurance
train<00:01:37.689> so<00:01:37.899> let's<00:01:38.409> say<00:01:38.530> I<00:01:38.560> hit<00:01:38.770> my<00:01:38.890> 30<00:01:39.130> seconds

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:39.670 
train so let's say I hit my 30 seconds

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:41.669 
train so let's say I hit my 30 seconds
I'm<00:01:39.789> going<00:01:40.119> to<00:01:40.210> put<00:01:40.329> my<00:01:40.359> weight<00:01:40.630> down<00:01:40.659> maybe<00:01:41.530> I

00:01:41.669 --> 00:01:41.679 
I'm going to put my weight down maybe I

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:43.740 
I'm going to put my weight down maybe I
need<00:01:41.799> 10<00:01:42.130> seconds<00:01:42.490> recovery<00:01:42.909> maybe<00:01:43.450> I'm<00:01:43.630> going

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:43.750 
need 10 seconds recovery maybe I'm going

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.830 
need 10 seconds recovery maybe I'm going
to<00:01:43.840> go<00:01:43.929> right<00:01:44.109> into<00:01:44.320> my<00:01:45.039> lunges<00:01:45.840> everybody's

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
to go right into my lunges everybody's

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:47.799 
different depending on your fitness

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:49.080 
different depending on your fitness
level<00:01:48.009> if<00:01:48.369> you're<00:01:48.490> just<00:01:48.670> getting<00:01:48.820> off<00:01:49.060> the

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
level if you're just getting off the

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.239 
level if you're just getting off the
couch<00:01:49.390> just<00:01:50.079> starting<00:01:50.380> off<00:01:50.469> you're<00:01:51.070> probably

00:01:51.239 --> 00:01:51.249 
couch just starting off you're probably

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:53.160 
couch just starting off you're probably
gonna<00:01:51.429> need<00:01:51.520> a<00:01:51.609> little<00:01:51.789> recovery<00:01:51.999> but<00:01:52.840> as<00:01:52.960> you

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
gonna need a little recovery but as you

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:54.810 
gonna need a little recovery but as you
go<00:01:53.350> you<00:01:53.380> can<00:01:53.710> start<00:01:53.859> jumping<00:01:54.219> right<00:01:54.429> into<00:01:54.640> your

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820 
go you can start jumping right into your

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.179 
go you can start jumping right into your
next<00:01:54.999> exercise<00:01:55.450> so<00:01:56.259> for<00:01:56.530> me<00:01:56.649> I'm<00:01:56.829> jumping
