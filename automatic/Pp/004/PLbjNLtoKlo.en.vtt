00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
statement well that really was just a

it's<00:00:38.130> pretty<00:00:38.399> clever<00:00:38.640> actually<00:00:39.300> but<00:00:39.450> I<00:00:39.480> doubt

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
it's pretty clever actually but I doubt

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
anyone could get away with that kind of

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.160 
anyone could get away with that kind of
bullshit<00:00:41.399> today<00:00:41.579> but<00:00:42.329> that's<00:00:42.390> enough<00:00:42.719> history

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
bullshit today but that's enough history

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
represent the city well enough so I

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.640 
represent the city well enough so I
can't<00:01:27.240> fault<00:01:27.450> them<00:01:27.600> too<00:01:27.810> much<00:01:28.020> especially

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
when you consider how long ago this game

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.630 
when you consider how long ago this game
was<00:01:30.810> made<00:01:31.020> on<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.830> other<00:01:31.950> hand<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.369> street

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
scenes do have a bit more detail I

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.740 
scenes do have a bit more detail I
particularly<00:01:35.369> like<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.850> background<00:01:36.090> ads<00:01:36.570> in

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
particularly like the background ads in

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.990 
particularly like the background ads in
each<00:01:36.840> sector<00:01:37.170> also<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.369> spinner<00:01:38.640> doesn't

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
each sector also the spinner doesn't

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.850 
each sector also the spinner doesn't
look<00:01:39.119> too<00:01:39.299> shabby<00:01:39.570> it's<00:01:40.079> not<00:01:40.229> quite<00:01:40.500> like<00:01:40.680> the

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
look too shabby it's not quite like the

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.890 
look too shabby it's not quite like the

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:06.470 
another strange thing is that I don't

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:08.050 
another strange thing is that I don't
think<00:05:06.680> the<00:05:06.770> hired<00:05:07.040> number<00:05:07.370> replicants<00:05:07.940> are

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:08.060 
think the hired number replicants are

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:10.210 
think the hired number replicants are
the<00:05:08.150> hardest<00:05:08.480> ones<00:05:08.630> to<00:05:08.750> kill<00:05:09.050> no<00:05:09.740> I<00:05:09.770> think<00:05:10.130> the

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:10.220 
the hardest ones to kill no I think the

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:11.860 
the hardest ones to kill no I think the
hardest<00:05:10.490> ones<00:05:10.730> to<00:05:10.790> kill<00:05:11.030> are<00:05:11.210> the<00:05:11.330> tube's<00:05:11.600> and

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:11.870 
hardest ones to kill are the tube's and

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:13.870 
hardest ones to kill are the tube's and
why<00:05:12.260> you<00:05:12.320> might<00:05:12.530> ask<00:05:12.590> because<00:05:13.430> they<00:05:13.700> stay

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:13.880 
why you might ask because they stay

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:15.460 
why you might ask because they stay
right<00:05:14.090> at<00:05:14.210> the<00:05:14.300> top<00:05:14.540> of<00:05:14.690> the<00:05:14.780> fucking<00:05:14.990> screen

and<00:06:05.240> that's<00:06:05.390> not<00:06:05.510> what<00:06:05.690> video<00:06:05.960> games<00:06:06.230> should

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:06.410 
and that's not what video games should

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:08.590 
and that's not what video games should
be<00:06:06.650> if<00:06:07.190> they've<00:06:07.430> given<00:06:07.610> you<00:06:07.820> anything<00:06:08.270> else<00:06:08.420> to

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:08.600 
be if they've given you anything else to

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:10.420 
be if they've given you anything else to
do<00:06:08.810> where<00:06:09.050> at<00:06:09.140> the<00:06:09.290> very<00:06:09.320> least<00:06:09.860> ended<00:06:10.340> the

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:10.430 
do where at the very least ended the

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:12.550 
do where at the very least ended the
game<00:06:10.610> after<00:06:10.940> you<00:06:11.030> killed<00:06:11.330> 5<00:06:11.540> or<00:06:11.720> 6<00:06:11.930> replicants

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:12.560 
game after you killed 5 or 6 replicants

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.110 
game after you killed 5 or 6 replicants
then<00:06:12.860> I<00:06:12.890> would<00:06:13.100> have<00:06:13.160> liked<00:06:13.400> it<00:06:13.520> a<00:06:13.640> bit<00:06:13.850> more

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:14.120 
then I would have liked it a bit more

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:16.180 
then I would have liked it a bit more
but<00:06:14.750> nope<00:06:15.020> they<00:06:15.230> just<00:06:15.440> keep<00:06:15.620> on<00:06:15.770> having<00:06:16.130> a

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:16.190 
but nope they just keep on having a

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:18.430 
but nope they just keep on having a
chase<00:06:16.460> replicants<00:06:17.120> and<00:06:17.240> kill<00:06:17.450> them<00:06:17.600> despite

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:18.440 
chase replicants and kill them despite

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:20.050 
chase replicants and kill them despite
the<00:06:18.590> game's<00:06:18.800> problems<00:06:19.280> though<00:06:19.460> it<00:06:19.670> does<00:06:19.850> have

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:20.060 
the game's problems though it does have

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:22.360 
the game's problems though it does have
one<00:06:20.270> other<00:06:20.420> good<00:06:20.660> point<00:06:20.990> namely<00:06:21.530> is<00:06:21.800> rendition

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:22.370 
one other good point namely is rendition

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:24.820 
one other good point namely is rendition
of<00:06:22.460> Vangelis<00:06:23.030> music<00:06:23.570> from<00:06:23.690> the<00:06:23.810> movie<00:06:24.170> given

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:24.830 
of Vangelis music from the movie given

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:26.500 
of Vangelis music from the movie given
the<00:06:24.950> audio<00:06:25.220> limitations<00:06:25.910> I<00:06:26.060> think<00:06:26.240> they<00:06:26.330> did<00:06:26.480> a

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:26.510 
the audio limitations I think they did a

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:51.050 
the audio limitations I think they did a
good<00:06:26.720> job<00:06:26.780> with<00:06:27.170> the<00:06:27.260> end<00:06:27.410> theme<00:06:27.680> here<00:06:28.100> listen

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:51.060 

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:53.370 

the<00:06:52.060> only<00:06:52.180> problem<00:06:52.660> is<00:06:52.690> that<00:06:52.750> it<00:06:52.960> keeps<00:06:53.170> on

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:53.380 
the only problem is that it keeps on

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:55.230 
the only problem is that it keeps on
playing<00:06:53.680> over<00:06:54.130> and<00:06:54.250> over<00:06:54.490> again<00:06:54.610> but<00:06:55.090> it's

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:55.240 
playing over and over again but it's

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:57.420 
playing over and over again but it's
still<00:06:55.360> a<00:06:55.420> good<00:06:55.600> rendition<00:06:55.840> nonetheless<00:06:56.430> all

00:06:57.420 --> 00:06:57.430 
still a good rendition nonetheless all

00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:59.100 
still a good rendition nonetheless all
in<00:06:57.670> all<00:06:57.820> I'd<00:06:58.000> recommend<00:06:58.480> the<00:06:58.600> game<00:06:58.780> but<00:06:58.990> only

00:06:59.100 --> 00:06:59.110 
in all I'd recommend the game but only

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:00.690 
in all I'd recommend the game but only
is<00:06:59.290> a<00:06:59.320> good<00:06:59.560> diversion<00:07:00.070> that<00:07:00.100> you<00:07:00.310> might<00:07:00.490> play

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:00.700 
is a good diversion that you might play

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:03.000 
is a good diversion that you might play
for<00:07:00.940> 10<00:07:01.090> or<00:07:01.120> 20<00:07:01.390> minutes<00:07:01.750> beyond<00:07:02.560> that<00:07:02.770> however

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:03.010 
for 10 or 20 minutes beyond that however

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:06.290 
for 10 or 20 minutes beyond that however
it<00:07:03.370> becomes<00:07:03.670> way<00:07:03.880> too<00:07:03.910> tedious<00:07:04.360> to<00:07:04.600> continue

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:06.300 
it becomes way too tedious to continue

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:08.790 
it becomes way too tedious to continue
so<00:07:07.300> in<00:07:07.450> conclusion<00:07:07.690> I<00:07:08.260> have<00:07:08.380> to<00:07:08.560> give<00:07:08.710> them

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:08.800 
so in conclusion I have to give them

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:10.260 
so in conclusion I have to give them
credit<00:07:08.860> for<00:07:09.190> trying<00:07:09.430> to<00:07:09.610> make<00:07:09.760> a<00:07:09.790> Blade<00:07:10.090> Runner

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:10.270 
credit for trying to make a Blade Runner

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:12.330 
credit for trying to make a Blade Runner

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:12.340 
game back in the day and I really have

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:13.590 
game back in the day and I really have
to<00:07:12.400> give<00:07:12.580> them<00:07:12.670> some<00:07:12.820> credit<00:07:13.150> for<00:07:13.180> finding<00:07:13.420> a

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:13.600 
to give them some credit for finding a

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.510 
to give them some credit for finding a
clever<00:07:13.870> way<00:07:14.110> to<00:07:14.140> bypass<00:07:14.650> the<00:07:14.860> rights<00:07:15.100> issues

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:15.520 
clever way to bypass the rights issues

clever way to bypass the rights issues
if<00:07:16.060> you<00:07:16.240> enjoyed<00:07:16.540> the<00:07:16.690> movie<00:07:17.050> then<00:07:17.260> I<00:07:17.350> think

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:17.530 
if you enjoyed the movie then I think

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:18.870 
if you enjoyed the movie then I think
it'd<00:07:17.680> be<00:07:17.710> worth<00:07:17.950> your<00:07:18.160> while<00:07:18.340> to<00:07:18.370> play<00:07:18.670> this
