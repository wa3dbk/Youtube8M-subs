information etc and then we've got the

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:28.680 
information etc and then we've got the
star<00:02:27.190> of<00:02:27.340> the<00:02:27.460> show<00:02:27.490> which<00:02:27.940> is<00:02:28.120> the<00:02:28.270> SmartWatch

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
star of the show which is the SmartWatch

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.540 
star of the show which is the SmartWatch
itself<00:02:29.230> so<00:02:29.410> let's<00:02:29.590> pull<00:02:29.950> that<00:02:29.980> out<00:02:30.460> like<00:02:30.940> so

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
itself so let's pull that out like so

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:37.830 
itself so let's pull that out like so
let's<00:02:34.380> pull<00:02:35.380> off<00:02:35.560> the<00:02:35.890> protector<00:02:36.610> and<00:02:37.480> there

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840

we have it

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:43.200 
we have it
so<00:02:39.460> this<00:02:40.000> is<00:02:40.270> a<00:02:40.980> silicon<00:02:41.980> band<00:02:42.280> we've<00:02:42.790> got<00:02:43.030> this

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:43.210 
so this is a silicon band we've got this

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:45.980 
so this is a silicon band we've got this
nice<00:02:43.720> metal<00:02:44.290> clasp<00:02:44.620> here<00:02:44.920> with<00:02:45.040> the<00:02:45.160> sony<00:02:45.430> logo

solution<00:02:55.330> to<00:02:55.570> a<00:02:55.600> SmartWatch<00:02:56.140> but<00:02:56.410> it's<00:02:56.530> added

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:56.770 
solution to a SmartWatch but it's added

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:59.970 
solution to a SmartWatch but it's added
a<00:02:56.860> touch<00:02:57.070> class<00:02:57.459> with<00:02:57.760> this<00:02:58.690> little<00:02:59.020> bezel<00:02:59.470> and

a touch class with this little bezel and
clasp<00:03:00.940> here<00:03:01.410> so<00:03:02.410> we<00:03:03.070> can<00:03:03.370> actually<00:03:04.110> pull<00:03:05.110> out

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
clasp here so we can actually pull out

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.580 
clasp here so we can actually pull out
the<00:03:05.650> module<00:03:05.860> that<00:03:06.760> is<00:03:06.910> the<00:03:07.209> SmartWatch<00:03:07.900> 3<00:03:08.230> from

separately in a variety of colors and

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:15.660 
separately in a variety of colors and
that's<00:03:13.930> the<00:03:14.110> main<00:03:14.320> little<00:03:14.650> little<00:03:15.250> module

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
that's the main little little module

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.360 
that's the main little little module
itself<00:03:16.120> that<00:03:16.450> has<00:03:16.600> all<00:03:16.930> the<00:03:17.140> workings<00:03:17.680> the<00:03:17.830> GPS

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
itself that has all the workings the GPS

itself that has all the workings the GPS
the<00:03:18.610> Bluetooth<00:03:19.150> and<00:03:19.390> everything<00:03:19.810> that<00:03:19.930> you

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:20.019 
the Bluetooth and everything that you

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:22.890 
the Bluetooth and everything that you
need<00:03:20.230> to<00:03:20.739> actually<00:03:20.920> kind<00:03:21.760> of<00:03:21.880> use<00:03:22.180> this<00:03:22.390> on<00:03:22.630> a

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
need to actually kind of use this on a

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.150 
need to actually kind of use this on a
daily<00:03:23.519> basis<00:03:24.519> so<00:03:25.060> it's<00:03:25.180> a<00:03:25.239> 1.6<00:03:25.989> inch<00:03:26.290> display

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
daily basis so it's a 1.6 inch display

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.699 
daily basis so it's a 1.6 inch display
with<00:03:27.340> a<00:03:27.370> 320<00:03:27.940> by<00:03:28.060> 320<00:03:28.450> resolution<00:03:28.690> and<00:03:29.380> this

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
with a 320 by 320 resolution and this

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:32.970 
with a 320 by 320 resolution and this
core<00:03:29.980> unit<00:03:30.340> weighs<00:03:30.489> in<00:03:30.670> at<00:03:30.760> 45<00:03:31.209> grams<00:03:31.750> so<00:03:32.019> not

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
core unit weighs in at 45 grams so not

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.870 
core unit weighs in at 45 grams so not
too<00:03:33.220> heavy<00:03:33.519> at<00:03:33.760> all<00:03:33.970> let's<00:03:34.900> pop<00:03:35.170> that<00:03:35.310> back<00:03:36.310> in

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 
too heavy at all let's pop that back in

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.080 
too heavy at all let's pop that back in
here<00:03:38.100> now<00:03:39.100> I'm<00:03:39.160> not<00:03:39.340> having<00:03:39.459> done<00:03:39.760> this<00:03:39.880> before

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
here now I'm not having done this before

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.270 
here now I'm not having done this before
that's<00:03:40.480> fairly<00:03:40.810> easy<00:03:40.959> and<00:03:41.739> you<00:03:41.830> can<00:03:42.070> actually

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
that's fairly easy and you can actually

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.040 
that's fairly easy and you can actually
see<00:03:42.700> here<00:03:42.940> this<00:03:43.090> is<00:03:43.150> where<00:03:43.570> you<00:03:43.920> charge<00:03:44.940> the

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:46.050 
see here this is where you charge the

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:49.470 
see here this is where you charge the
SmartWatch<00:03:47.050> 3<00:03:47.260> so<00:03:47.590> let's<00:03:47.769> see<00:03:48.120> it's<00:03:49.120> not<00:03:49.300> the

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
SmartWatch 3 so let's see it's not the

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.840 
SmartWatch 3 so let's see it's not the
easiest<00:03:50.170> thing<00:03:50.470> to<00:03:50.500> get<00:03:50.860> off<00:03:51.010> but<00:03:51.310> there<00:03:51.580> is

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:51.850 
easiest thing to get off but there is

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:55.620 
easiest thing to get off but there is
the<00:03:52.810> micro<00:03:53.260> USB<00:03:53.290> connection<00:03:54.220> which<00:03:54.459> is<00:03:55.330> good

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:55.630 
the micro USB connection which is good

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:57.690 
the micro USB connection which is good
and<00:03:55.750> bad<00:03:55.900> the<00:03:56.650> good<00:03:56.830> thing<00:03:57.040> is<00:03:57.190> you<00:03:57.340> don't<00:03:57.580> need

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:57.700 
and bad the good thing is you don't need

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:59.340 
and bad the good thing is you don't need
a<00:03:57.760> special<00:03:58.030> dock<00:03:58.390> and<00:03:58.600> you<00:03:58.660> just<00:03:58.870> connect<00:03:59.200> a

00:03:59.340 --> 00:03:59.350 
a special dock and you just connect a

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:02.310 
a special dock and you just connect a
standard<00:03:59.590> micro<00:04:00.250> USB<00:04:00.280> cable<00:04:01.209> to<00:04:01.390> this<00:04:01.570> whereas

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:02.320 
standard micro USB cable to this whereas

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:05.040 
standard micro USB cable to this whereas
others<00:04:02.590> some<00:04:03.220> need<00:04:03.430> an<00:04:03.550> actual<00:04:03.670> dock<00:04:04.120> for<00:04:04.390> it

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:05.050 
others some need an actual dock for it

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:07.020 
others some need an actual dock for it
the<00:04:05.620> bad<00:04:05.799> part<00:04:06.040> it's<00:04:06.280> a<00:04:06.310> bit<00:04:06.459> fiddly<00:04:06.700> there<00:04:06.940> on

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
the bad part it's a bit fiddly there on

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:08.039 
the bad part it's a bit fiddly there on
the<00:04:07.120> back<00:04:07.299> you're<00:04:07.480> gonna<00:04:07.540> have<00:04:07.750> to<00:04:07.840> take<00:04:08.019> it

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:08.049 
the back you're gonna have to take it

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:10.680 
the back you're gonna have to take it
off<00:04:08.350> and<00:04:08.680> I<00:04:08.970> can<00:04:09.970> see<00:04:10.120> that<00:04:10.269> being<00:04:10.420> a<00:04:10.540> little

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:10.690 
off and I can see that being a little

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:13.170 
off and I can see that being a little
bit<00:04:10.989> of<00:04:11.140> a<00:04:11.200> hassle<00:04:11.519> and<00:04:12.519> it's<00:04:12.670> not<00:04:12.820> helped<00:04:13.150> by

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.180 
bit of a hassle and it's not helped by

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.170 
bit of a hassle and it's not helped by
the<00:04:13.299> fact<00:04:13.570> that<00:04:13.720> you've<00:04:13.900> got<00:04:13.930> this<00:04:14.820> band<00:04:15.820> that

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
the fact that you've got this band that

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:17.880 
the fact that you've got this band that
doesn't<00:04:16.359> doesn't<00:04:16.780> break<00:04:17.109> in<00:04:17.350> the<00:04:17.410> middle<00:04:17.709> you

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:17.890 
doesn't doesn't break in the middle you

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:19.440 
doesn't doesn't break in the middle you
know<00:04:17.919> so<00:04:18.190> all<00:04:18.430> in<00:04:18.640> one<00:04:18.789> solution<00:04:18.970> with<00:04:19.359> that

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:19.450 
know so all in one solution with that

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:20.849 
know so all in one solution with that
class<00:04:19.660> but<00:04:19.900> the<00:04:19.989> fact<00:04:20.169> you<00:04:20.260> can<00:04:20.380> pop<00:04:20.530> it<00:04:20.650> in<00:04:20.739> and

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:20.859 
class but the fact you can pop it in and

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:22.110 
class but the fact you can pop it in and
out<00:04:20.950> and<00:04:21.100> after<00:04:21.220> a<00:04:21.370> bit<00:04:21.489> of<00:04:21.580> practice<00:04:21.940> you'll

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
out and after a bit of practice you'll

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.310 
out and after a bit of practice you'll
get<00:04:22.300> used<00:04:22.539> to<00:04:22.660> it

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.320 
get used to it

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.050 
get used to it
so<00:04:23.410> we're<00:04:23.530> gonna<00:04:23.650> boot<00:04:23.920> this<00:04:24.130> up<00:04:24.370> now<00:04:24.820> you've

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.060 
so we're gonna boot this up now you've

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:26.700 
so we're gonna boot this up now you've
probably<00:04:25.180> seen<00:04:25.510> Android<00:04:26.050> wear<00:04:26.200> before<00:04:26.530> so

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
probably seen Android wear before so

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.470 
probably seen Android wear before so
we're<00:04:26.830> not<00:04:26.890> going<00:04:27.040> to<00:04:27.130> go<00:04:27.280> through<00:04:28.060> this<00:04:28.240> in

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:28.480 
we're not going to go through this in

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:29.880 
we're not going to go through this in
too<00:04:28.690> much<00:04:28.870> detail<00:04:29.140> I'm<00:04:29.530> just<00:04:29.680> going<00:04:29.830> to

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:29.890 
too much detail I'm just going to

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:34.380 
too much detail I'm just going to
quickly<00:04:30.760> pair<00:04:31.330> it<00:04:31.540> with<00:04:32.820> my<00:04:33.820> phone<00:04:34.060> here<00:04:34.360> so

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:34.390 
quickly pair it with my phone here so

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:37.110 
quickly pair it with my phone here so
popped<00:04:35.320> up<00:04:35.500> there<00:04:35.740> it's<00:04:36.550> going<00:04:36.700> to<00:04:36.790> connect

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
popped up there it's going to connect

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.420 
popped up there it's going to connect
and<00:04:37.390> this<00:04:37.540> can<00:04:37.750> take<00:04:38.050> a<00:04:38.080> few<00:04:38.380> minutes<00:04:38.440> to<00:04:39.280> do

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
and this can take a few minutes to do

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:41.550 
and this can take a few minutes to do
this<00:04:39.580> initially<00:04:40.150> okay<00:04:40.960> so<00:04:41.020> we're<00:04:41.410> now<00:04:41.500> back

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 
this initially okay so we're now back

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.980 
this initially okay so we're now back

with the SmartWatch 3 took a little

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:45.510 
with the SmartWatch 3 took a little
longer<00:04:44.170> to<00:04:44.320> set<00:04:44.530> up<00:04:44.680> the<00:04:44.770> X<00:04:44.920> had<00:04:45.070> to<00:04:45.160> download

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:45.520 
longer to set up the X had to download

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:47.760 
longer to set up the X had to download
an<00:04:45.730> update<00:04:46.120> and<00:04:46.300> everything<00:04:46.660> so<00:04:47.020> here<00:04:47.650> we<00:04:47.740> are
