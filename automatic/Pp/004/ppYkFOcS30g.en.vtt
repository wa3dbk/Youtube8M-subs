them<00:00:35.360> I'd<00:00:36.360> love<00:00:36.780> to<00:00:36.930> think<00:00:37.079> that<00:00:37.200> all

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
them I'd love to think that all

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.420 
them I'd love to think that all
cheerleaders<00:00:37.620> are<00:00:37.890> great<00:00:38.070> this<00:00:38.280> is<00:00:38.399> a

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
cheerleaders are great this is a

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.090 
cheerleaders are great this is a
terrible<00:00:39.200> reflection<00:00:40.200> on<00:00:40.320> cheerleading<00:00:40.829> but

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
terrible reflection on cheerleading but

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:41.959 
terrible reflection on cheerleading but
I<00:00:41.129> also<00:00:41.280> think<00:00:41.550> that<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:41.850> administration

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
I also think that the administration

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.880 
I also think that the administration
could<00:00:42.600> have<00:00:42.719> stepped<00:00:42.930> in<00:00:43.050> at<00:00:43.140> any<00:00:43.260> point<00:00:43.350> we're

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
could have stepped in at any point we're

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.069 
could have stepped in at any point we're
talking<00:00:43.980> about<00:00:44.219> a<00:00:44.430> sexual<00:00:45.059> innuendo<00:00:45.239> in<00:00:45.960> you

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
so is this the exception rather than the

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.730 
so is this the exception rather than the
rule<00:02:21.090> what<00:02:21.540> happens<00:02:21.870> in<00:02:21.960> this<00:02:22.080> Texas<00:02:22.470> school
