00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:11.870
 this week it's me boss 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:14.269
 indeed the union of fitters reacted 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:15.440
 facing the foul aggression of red sox the 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:15.830
 last week and took it out of his 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.150
 functions 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:19.610
 it's good because it's a bit 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:21.110
 sick as good it's not all that but 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:22.340
 I have to write the week 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:23.750
 golden toc because the other he did not 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.670
 done and it takes a little while 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.920
 but fortunately the editing is great 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:30.140
 cool and here's a proof this is this 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:32.689

 heart and team holds that at tennis in 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.440
 in short we will see that twitter is honest 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.879
 since I write a twitter is honest 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.170
 and that's all because there are some who make 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:43.730
 not their job and suddenly I do not 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.260
 great thing to present the week is going 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.789
 to be rather short and one tackles 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.379
 input a big subject that of korea 

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:49.670
 and you probably know already what I 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:51.829
 will speak the rigged bets 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.780
 already in 2010 blizzard is aware 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:54.980
 with the match fixing scandal but did 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.170
 however not wish to think about them 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.640
 rules olivia gong manager assistant tg 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.719
 Rector of content at axium denounces 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.170
 all alone in a clear tweet and 

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:01.550
 direct 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.469
 there are tired and it must move 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.090
 however how can the parsley matra 

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:06.500
 to make their bet more profitable 

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:07.820
 does it's very simple people often 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.750
 sponsors are injecting money into 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.640
 small weekly competitions 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.870
 online similar to attacks in 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.190
 france and for the purpose of their 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:15.260
 investment to ask players 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.580
 and to the organizers of the information 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.230
 on the match or at best outright 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.270
 game spectators suffers in his 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:21.320
 past for default cast bets 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.940
 were open for five minutes 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.620
 that corresponds to about him minutes 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:25.730
 in the game and therefore allows to have 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:26.060
 sacred information about the outcome of the 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:27.980
 part 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:31.180
 some even go further and ask 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.180
 to players to lose voluntarily 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.470
 for about 2000 dollars 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.970
 investments it pays rather 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.979
 well their sum invites you to 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:44.110
 read the articles on team aaa millenium 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:45.850

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:49.930
 that they treat the subject in depth 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.369
 on the other side in europe things do not 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.259

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.060
 usually 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.530
 marcus received an email from

 sia clips claiming he was cheating 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.470
 on his stream 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.450
 at the time of the z tivi in ​​2013 in 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:57.250
 generating fraudulent money or a 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.450
 nor two faithful cus out a video 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.310
 explaining that it's not very very 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.260
 nice to say they cheat why 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.209
 it's fresh it didnt decline explains 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.760
 he left money he earned in 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:07.720
 Stream has left about 1,500 euros and the 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.220
 structure is now trying to 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.019
 appropriating it as a slab layer to 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.820
 to cheat frankly it's not at all 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:14.140
 happy business site that at 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.790
 answer on facebook that it was rather 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.709
 the civil z to pay that soul 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.000
 was approximate that they paid to 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:20.350
 lose people who have type it's with 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.820
 stolen cards and that anyway 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:23.110
 whatever he says will be our villain 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:24.640
 prefer 

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:26.530
 pretty amazing millennium thing to him 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.760
 also talked about the drama to an article is 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:29.739
 dedicated with all the info and that's 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.760
 rare enough to be picked up or 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:32.440
 there I want to read to the teleprompter because 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.880
 sao paulo I still have trouble 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.019
 understand the reaction of Marcus it is 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.700
 obvious that it's an automatic message 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:38.680
 himself says it in the video 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.420
 so why stall everything on the square 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.379
 public right away we doubt 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.150
 it's not targeted action 

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:44.550
 in the end the message is addressed 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.110
 only to team 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:47.580
 he would have been much preferable 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:48.030
 strikes to settle that pardon in 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.920
 internal 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.510
 that said they would have settled this 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.790
 story discreetly I would have lost 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.120
 content for the news side show in 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.650
 short 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.120
 finally Thursday news but there's only one 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.650
 false death on one side should toc it's 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.580
 he who puts his job is not because 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.730
 that you are to someone who wishes that 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:03.960
 you can not do your job shit huh 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:05.550
 where facebook seems to get by 

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:07.560
 twitter announces failure 

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:09.120
 why are you talking about that we do not care 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.800
 effect the big boss dick costello 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.390
 bitterly admits that their politics 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.900
 anti harassment is totally 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.100
 ineffective 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.180
 at the same time I do not really see what they 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.070
 can make tweets must have 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.540
 millions a day the director 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.859
 announces having who lose thousands 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:20.190
 users every day because of 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:22.260
 these people 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:23.430
 so be nice on twitter like you 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:24.960
 each other and smile at your 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:26.880
 next you will end up thinking 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.590
 but the crs at the portel poop 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:31.200
 in fact I add last news 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:33.120
 minute what youth ensures timar is 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.410
 what you know about sweeting is 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:37.350
 a concept that comes to us from the united states 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:38.970
 and whose principle is to call it 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:40.500
 for false reasons of the east 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:42.750
 send it to a streamer in order to 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:44.310
 to make the arrest live is 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:46.680
 a really big flow technique 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:48.330
 the most beautiful kids flow too because 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.710
 that you have already done some damage and 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.060
 that proves us once again put to 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:51.720
 share on twitter that radios get 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:54.660
 believe everything allowed 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:56.820
 on february the 10th french streamer bbx has 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:57.990
 been a victim of sweeting in full stream 

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:00.270
 the police landed with great strokes of 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:03.180
 boot following a call and challenges bbx 

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:05.640

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:06.870
 time I wanted her home includes 

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:08.430
 very quickly what it turns out 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:14.669
 his friend a little less we hear 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:15.810
 was crying panicked thanks for trauma the 

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:17.820
 miners' brigade understands quickly 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:19.140
 also the situation and we skid 

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:20.790
 bbx gets them off the stream 

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:22.680
 and by calmly commissariat the individual 

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:24.630
 can I cut the thing in me 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:29.610
 what the legend here we are actually we 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:31.050
 sees in the face and a whole tweet at 11:44 pm 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:33.090
 reassures the community by explaining that 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:34.740
 all is well we all agree 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:35.850
 to say how far it goes 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:37.260
 do not have to be very clever to scream at 

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:39.510
 wolf and unless you are well prepared 

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.560

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:45.180
 bad jokes the kid was nice 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.919
 minor it could very well serve 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:48.870
 example by scooping a heavy sentence 

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:50.460
