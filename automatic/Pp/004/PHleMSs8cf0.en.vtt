what I understand about this company is

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.110 
what I understand about this company is
that<00:00:30.810> they<00:00:31.019> really<00:00:31.349> focus<00:00:31.890> their<00:00:32.399> cosmetics

that they really focus their cosmetics

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.170 
that they really focus their cosmetics
on<00:00:33.300> creating<00:00:34.110> a<00:00:34.200> really<00:00:34.530> beautiful<00:00:35.370> natural

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
on creating a really beautiful natural

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.180 
on creating a really beautiful natural
makeup<00:00:36.690> look<00:00:37.050> almost<00:00:37.380> like<00:00:37.680> a<00:00:37.710> no<00:00:37.980> makeup

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
makeup look almost like a no makeup

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.819 
makeup look almost like a no makeup
makeup<00:00:38.610> look<00:00:38.730> and<00:00:39.180> that's<00:00:39.930> why<00:00:40.200> I<00:00:40.230> was<00:00:40.559> really

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
makeup look and that's why I was really

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.889 
makeup look and that's why I was really
drawn<00:00:41.160> to<00:00:41.190> this<00:00:41.460> I'm<00:00:41.760> really<00:00:42.300> hesitant<00:00:42.510> to

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
drawn to this I'm really hesitant to

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.900 
drawn to this I'm really hesitant to
call<00:00:43.260> this<00:00:43.440> a<00:00:43.590> foundation<00:00:44.160> and<00:00:44.340> I'm<00:00:44.460> not<00:00:44.610> quite

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
call this a foundation and I'm not quite

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.880 
call this a foundation and I'm not quite
sure<00:00:44.940> why<00:00:45.539> they<00:00:45.870> called<00:00:46.140> it<00:00:46.230> a<00:00:46.350> foundation

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
sure why they called it a foundation

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.490 
sure why they called it a foundation
because<00:00:47.700> it's<00:00:47.969> very<00:00:48.210> misleading<00:00:48.510> almost<00:00:49.170> it

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
because it's very misleading almost it

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.889 
because it's very misleading almost it
does<00:00:49.770> redeem<00:00:50.309> itself<00:00:50.610> in<00:00:50.910> a<00:00:51.030> way<00:00:51.180> because<00:00:51.539> they

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
does redeem itself in a way because they

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.200 
does redeem itself in a way because they
call<00:00:52.140> it<00:00:52.289> an<00:00:52.379> ultra<00:00:52.770> sheer<00:00:52.980> foundation<00:00:53.160> but<00:00:54.030> to

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
call it an ultra sheer foundation but to

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.750 
call it an ultra sheer foundation but to
me<00:00:54.420> it<00:00:54.690> is<00:00:54.719> definitely<00:00:55.469> more<00:00:55.710> of<00:00:55.770> a<00:00:56.280> tinted

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
me it is definitely more of a tinted

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.900 
me it is definitely more of a tinted
moisturizer<00:00:57.140> like<00:00:58.140> face<00:00:58.620> product<00:00:59.160> which<00:00:59.670> I

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
happen to really really love because I

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.820

very thick it's not very creamy it's a

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.630 
very thick it's not very creamy it's a
little<00:01:45.720> bit<00:01:45.869> water<00:01:46.350> based<00:01:46.680> so<00:01:47.250> it<00:01:47.399> blends

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
little bit water based so it blends

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.940 
little bit water based so it blends
really<00:01:47.909> nicely<00:01:48.060> but<00:01:48.720> it<00:01:48.869> also<00:01:49.020> blends<00:01:49.439> again

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
really nicely but it also blends again

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.340 
really nicely but it also blends again
sheerly<00:01:50.490> and<00:01:50.729> then<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.180> finish<00:01:51.540> is<00:01:51.750> very

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
sheerly and then the finish is very

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.310 
sheerly and then the finish is very
luminous<00:01:52.799> so<00:01:53.340> this<00:01:53.579> is<00:01:53.850> not<00:01:54.270> for<00:01:54.750> people<00:01:55.020> who

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
luminous so this is not for people who

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.609 
luminous so this is not for people who
have<00:01:55.640> really<00:01:56.640> oily<00:01:56.969> or<00:01:57.210> combination<00:01:57.780> skin

I do have normal combination skin my
oiliness<00:02:02.159> is<00:02:02.430> usually<00:02:02.820> on<00:02:03.090> my<00:02:03.299> forehead<00:02:03.719> I<00:02:03.930> can

mattifying kind of serum it's from
Bioderma<00:02:11.849> it's<00:02:12.120> better<00:02:12.330> for<00:02:12.629> my

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
Bioderma it's better for my

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.880 
and I will just put that on my forehead
and<00:02:15.640> it<00:02:16.000> really<00:02:16.239> helps<00:02:16.660> modify<00:02:17.110> my<00:02:17.349> skin<00:02:17.650> so

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890

get<00:02:19.959> oily<00:02:20.379> throughout<00:02:20.680> the<00:02:20.830> day<00:02:20.950> and<00:02:21.160> also<00:02:21.670> I

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
get oily throughout the day and also I

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.030 
get oily throughout the day and also I
will<00:02:22.060> often<00:02:22.420> set<00:02:22.690> my<00:02:22.870> face<00:02:23.110> with<00:02:23.170> a<00:02:23.709> loose

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
will often set my face with a loose

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.220 
will often set my face with a loose
setting<00:02:24.340> powder<00:02:24.519> or<00:02:25.030> a<00:02:25.200> translucent<00:02:26.200> powder

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
setting powder or a translucent powder

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.470 
setting powder or a translucent powder
this<00:02:26.769> definitely<00:02:27.190> feels<00:02:27.459> like<00:02:27.910> second<00:02:28.420> skin

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
this definitely feels like second skin

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.720 
this definitely feels like second skin
when<00:02:28.930> you<00:02:29.050> apply<00:02:29.440> it<00:02:29.500> it<00:02:29.860> doesn't<00:02:30.040> kick<00:02:30.340> up<00:02:30.519> it

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
when you apply it it doesn't kick up it

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.400 
when you apply it it doesn't kick up it
doesn't<00:02:30.879> bunch<00:02:31.299> up<00:02:31.480> in<00:02:31.569> your<00:02:31.750> creases<00:02:32.170> and

doesn't bunch up in your creases and

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:35.280 
doesn't bunch up in your creases and
it's<00:02:32.920> just<00:02:33.129> very<00:02:33.450> unnoticeable<00:02:34.450> to<00:02:34.480> the<00:02:35.260> eye

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
it's just very unnoticeable to the eye

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.530 
it's just very unnoticeable to the eye
once<00:02:35.860> you're<00:02:36.160> wearing<00:02:36.610> it<00:02:36.760> because<00:02:37.299> this<00:02:37.480> is

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
so sheer you can definitely put two

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:41.729 
so sheer you can definitely put two
layers<00:02:39.730> on<00:02:40.090> right<00:02:40.420> now<00:02:40.599> I<00:02:40.629> am<00:02:41.170> wearing<00:02:41.560> two

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:41.739 
layers on right now I am wearing two

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:43.800 
layers on right now I am wearing two
layers<00:02:41.980> just<00:02:42.099> so<00:02:42.459> you<00:02:42.519> can<00:02:42.760> see<00:02:43.030> that<00:02:43.360> even

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
layers just so you can see that even

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.530 
layers just so you can see that even
with<00:02:44.500> the<00:02:44.739> extra<00:02:44.890> layer<00:02:45.370> it<00:02:45.640> doesn't<00:02:46.060> cake<00:02:46.360> up

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
with the extra layer it doesn't cake up

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:47.819 
with the extra layer it doesn't cake up
or<00:02:46.750> bunch<00:02:46.959> up<00:02:47.140> or<00:02:47.290> anything<00:02:47.500> like<00:02:47.769> that

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:47.829 
or bunch up or anything like that

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:49.979 
or bunch up or anything like that
because<00:02:48.250> this<00:02:48.579> has<00:02:48.640> virtually<00:02:49.000> zero<00:02:49.660> coverage

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
because this has virtually zero coverage

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:52.080 
because this has virtually zero coverage
you<00:02:50.650> almost<00:02:50.890> have<00:02:51.099> to<00:02:51.130> have<00:02:51.220> good<00:02:51.579> skin<00:02:51.880> to

begin with to wear this foundation or at
the<00:02:54.549> very<00:02:54.579> least<00:02:54.790> you<00:02:55.180> have<00:02:55.360> to<00:02:55.540> be

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
the very least you have to be

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.630 
the very least you have to be
comfortable<00:02:56.170> with<00:02:56.560> the<00:02:56.829> state<00:02:57.069> of<00:02:57.099> your<00:02:57.310> skin

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
Canada this retails for $51 so it's

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.930 
Canada this retails for $51 so it's
