00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
that mohair is enforced from the Angora

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.140 
that mohair is enforced from the Angora
goat<00:01:12.600> that's<00:01:13.020> where<00:01:13.260> mohair<00:01:13.590> comes<00:01:13.920> from<00:01:14.159> and

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
goat that's where mohair comes from and

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.780 
goat that's where mohair comes from and
you<00:01:15.600> should<00:01:15.869> know<00:01:16.080> all<00:01:16.290> about<00:01:16.500> that<00:01:16.790> well

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
you should know all about that well

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.270 
you should know all about that well
there<00:01:18.270> there<00:01:18.630> is<00:01:18.810> something<00:01:19.170> about<00:01:19.229> that<00:01:19.650> my

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
there there is something about that my

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.280 
there there is something about that my
understanding<00:01:20.549> is<00:01:21.180> that<00:01:21.240> there's<00:01:21.750> an<00:01:21.930> Angora

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
understanding is that there's an Angora

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.880 
understanding is that there's an Angora
rabbit<00:01:22.799> too<00:01:23.040> and<00:01:23.610> that<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.180> mohair<00:01:25.170> comes

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
rabbit too and that the mohair comes

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.760 
rabbit too and that the mohair comes
from<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.250> goat<00:01:26.490> and<00:01:26.970> it<00:01:27.780> makes<00:01:28.049> sense<00:01:28.320> since

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
from the goat and it makes sense since

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.740 
from the goat and it makes sense since
there<00:01:29.040> is<00:01:29.220> mohair<00:01:29.790> on<00:01:29.939> that<00:01:30.180> go<00:01:30.390> than<00:01:30.659> the

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
there is mohair on that go than the

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.560 
there is mohair on that go than the
rabbit<00:01:31.170> yes<00:01:31.590> I<00:01:31.920> think<00:01:32.790> that<00:01:33.030> would<00:01:33.270> be<00:01:33.420> the

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
rabbit yes I think that would be the

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.270 
rabbit yes I think that would be the
best<00:01:33.750> way<00:01:33.900> to<00:01:34.079> differentiate<00:01:34.650> between<00:01:35.009> the

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
best way to differentiate between the

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.550 
best way to differentiate between the
two<00:01:35.400> wouldn't<00:01:35.880> you<00:01:36.000> exactly<00:01:36.689> an<00:01:36.810> Angora

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
two wouldn't you exactly an Angora

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.700 
two wouldn't you exactly an Angora
rabbit<00:01:38.100> makes<00:01:38.280> fine<00:01:38.579> fine<00:01:39.060> very<00:01:39.329> soft<00:01:39.689> yarn<00:01:40.409> or

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.749 
is
I<00:01:45.630> was<00:01:46.630> perfect<00:01:47.049> for<00:01:47.170> cinches<00:01:47.619> that's<00:01:48.460> since

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:51.909 
the 1800s 1840s I understand it

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:55.350 
the 1800s 1840s I understand it
brilliant<00:01:52.600> chord<00:01:52.960> form<00:01:53.259> so<00:01:53.679> the<00:01:54.369> the

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360 
brilliant chord form so the the

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.350 
brilliant chord form so the the
durability<00:01:55.810> of<00:01:55.840> the<00:01:56.439> mohair<00:01:56.920> from<00:01:57.880> the<00:01:58.000> Angora
