from the other dogs the goal is to keep

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.130 
from the other dogs the goal is to keep
her<00:02:10.250> really<00:02:10.670> focused<00:02:11.030> on<00:02:11.150> me<00:02:11.390> she<00:02:11.720> can<00:02:11.870> look<00:02:12.019> at

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
her really focused on me she can look at

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:13.300 
her really focused on me she can look at
the<00:02:12.230> other<00:02:12.350> dogs<00:02:12.560> but<00:02:12.769> I<00:02:12.799> don't<00:02:13.040> want<00:02:13.190> her

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
the other dogs but I don't want her

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.069 
the other dogs but I don't want her
jumping<00:02:13.519> up<00:02:13.790> and<00:02:13.910> down<00:02:14.030> or<00:02:14.390> barking<00:02:14.870> or

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
getting too excited by them so hopefully

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.120 
getting too excited by them so hopefully
with<00:02:17.630> lots<00:02:17.870> of<00:02:17.989> repetition<00:02:18.140> she'll<00:02:18.860> get<00:02:19.010> the

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
with lots of repetition she'll get the

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.370 
with lots of repetition she'll get the
idea<00:02:19.549> and<00:02:19.790> start<00:02:20.390> ignoring<00:02:20.720> all<00:02:21.079> the<00:02:21.260> other

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380

dogs going to the dog park is a

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:25.000 
dogs going to the dog park is a
technique<00:02:23.600> I've<00:02:23.810> been<00:02:23.930> using<00:02:24.140> all<00:02:24.440> along<00:02:24.500> with

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
technique I've been using all along with

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.230 
technique I've been using all along with
pretty<00:02:25.310> much<00:02:25.400> every<00:02:25.820> puppy<00:02:26.150> I've<00:02:26.239> gotten

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
pretty much every puppy I've gotten

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.090 
pretty much every puppy I've gotten
seems<00:02:27.510> to<00:02:27.660> help<00:02:27.810> really<00:02:28.470> well<00:02:28.650> with<00:02:28.860> getting

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
seems to help really well with getting

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.650 
seems to help really well with getting
the<00:02:29.190> dogs<00:02:29.400> over<00:02:29.790> there<00:02:29.910> dog<00:02:30.090> distraction

the dogs over there dog distraction
problems<00:02:31.050> as<00:02:31.260> long<00:02:31.530> as<00:02:31.680> we<00:02:31.800> go<00:02:31.980> many<00:02:32.610> times<00:02:32.910> and

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:33.210 
problems as long as we go many times and

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:35.030 
problems as long as we go many times and
take<00:02:33.390> slow<00:02:33.660> easy<00:02:33.930> steps<00:02:34.380> and<00:02:34.620> don't<00:02:34.770> expect

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
take slow easy steps and don't expect

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.230 
take slow easy steps and don't expect
too<00:02:35.250> much<00:02:35.370> out<00:02:35.580> of<00:02:35.640> them<00:02:35.820> in<00:02:36.000> the<00:02:36.090> beginning

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
too much out of them in the beginning

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.000 
too much out of them in the beginning
and<00:02:36.720> also<00:02:37.260> don't<00:02:37.440> put<00:02:37.590> them<00:02:37.710> in<00:02:37.830> situations

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
and also don't put them in situations

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:39.860 
and also don't put them in situations
where<00:02:38.580> they're<00:02:38.700> going<00:02:38.880> to<00:02:38.940> fail<00:02:39.120> what<00:02:39.720> that

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
where they're going to fail what that

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.690 
where they're going to fail what that
means<00:02:40.080> is<00:02:40.260> is<00:02:40.500> I<00:02:40.710> don't<00:02:40.770> get<00:02:41.100> them<00:02:41.220> to<00:02:41.430> close

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
from a far distance they're definitely

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.230 
from a far distance they're definitely
not<00:02:50.190> going<00:02:50.400> to<00:02:50.460> be<00:02:50.520> able<00:02:50.580> to<00:02:50.790> ignore<00:02:50.970> the<00:02:51.150> other

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
of course we ran into a lot of bicycles

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.490 
of course we ran into a lot of bicycles
this<00:03:03.450> is<00:03:03.630> the<00:03:03.750> most<00:03:03.900> bikes<00:03:04.200> that<00:03:04.320> we've

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
this is the most bikes that we've

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
great behavior and a lot of training we

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.080
