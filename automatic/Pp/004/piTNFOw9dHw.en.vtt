00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
number Ten's built and bag so other

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.730 
number Ten's built and bag so other
number<00:00:12.000> ten<00:00:12.150> bags<00:00:12.300> you<00:00:12.480> know<00:00:12.630> seriously<00:00:13.500> they

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
number ten bags you know seriously they

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.770 
number ten bags you know seriously they
built<00:00:13.950> actually<00:00:14.280> three<00:00:14.610> things<00:00:14.849> but<00:00:15.059> a<00:00:15.089> first

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
built actually three things but a first

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:16.970 
built actually three things but a first
thing<00:00:15.929> you<00:00:16.020> notice<00:00:16.379> is<00:00:16.529> there's<00:00:16.619> actually<00:00:16.949> a

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
thing you notice is there's actually a

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.010 
thing you notice is there's actually a
plane<00:00:17.220> right<00:00:17.430> here<00:00:17.580> we're<00:00:18.510> guessing<00:00:18.660> has<00:00:18.900> to

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
plane right here we're guessing has to

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:19.880 
plane right here we're guessing has to
go<00:00:19.109> on<00:00:19.140> base<00:00:19.380> because<00:00:19.619> there's<00:00:19.740> nowhere

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
go on base because there's nowhere

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.650 
go on base because there's nowhere
really<00:00:20.160> but<00:00:20.580> stuck<00:00:20.880> down<00:00:21.119> but<00:00:21.330> you're<00:00:21.539> gonna

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
really but stuck down but you're gonna

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.540 
really but stuck down but you're gonna
want<00:00:22.590> to<00:00:22.680> show<00:00:22.859> you<00:00:22.920> the<00:00:23.039> next<00:00:23.189> time<00:00:23.279> you're

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
want to show you the next time you're

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.130 
want to show you the next time you're
probably<00:00:23.699> gonna<00:00:23.880> realize<00:00:24.480> white<00:00:24.689> a<00:00:24.720> sustained

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
probably gonna realize white a sustained

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.500 
probably gonna realize white a sustained
basis<00:00:25.650> or<00:00:25.890> starting<00:00:26.220> base<00:00:26.340> I<00:00:26.490> mean<00:00:26.640> I<00:00:26.789> take

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
basis or starting base I mean I take

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:28.730 
basis or starting base I mean I take
over<00:00:27.599> here<00:00:27.869> to<00:00:27.960> other<00:00:28.109> side<00:00:28.289> of<00:00:28.320> Matt<00:00:28.590> there's

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
over here to other side of Matt there's

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.859 
over here to other side of Matt there's
actually<00:00:29.070> something<00:00:29.250> right<00:00:29.460> here<00:00:29.670> these<00:00:30.480> this

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
actually something right here these this

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.479 
actually something right here these this
is<00:00:30.929> where<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:31.320> board<00:00:31.560> usually<00:00:31.859> meet<00:00:32.250> right

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
is where the board usually meet right

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:33.920 
is where the board usually meet right
here<00:00:32.520> as<00:00:32.820> you<00:00:32.910> can<00:00:32.940> see<00:00:33.120> we<00:00:33.239> have<00:00:33.270> a<00:00:33.600> double

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
here as you can see we have a double

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.979 
here as you can see we have a double
just<00:00:34.380> to<00:00:34.920> assimilate<00:00:35.670> that<00:00:35.780> right<00:00:36.780> here

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
just to assimilate that right here

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.660 
just to assimilate that right here
there'd<00:00:37.260> be<00:00:37.410> nothing<00:00:37.680> here<00:00:37.829> and<00:00:38.070> what<00:00:38.309> this<00:00:38.460> is

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
there'd be nothing here and what this is

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.299 
there'd be nothing here and what this is
hanging<00:00:39.239> off<00:00:39.360> here<00:00:40.100> don't<00:00:41.100> pay<00:00:41.219> attention

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
hanging off here don't pay attention

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.369 
hanging off here don't pay attention
sees<00:00:41.670> wheels<00:00:42.030> are<00:00:42.239> just<00:00:42.270> too<00:00:42.629> what<00:00:42.870> for<00:00:43.170> wait

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
sees wheels are just too what for wait

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.069 
sees wheels are just too what for wait
just<00:00:44.040> for<00:00:44.340> doesn't<00:00:44.640> fall<00:00:44.850> over<00:00:44.879> but<00:00:45.329> uh<00:00:45.390> I'm

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
just for doesn't fall over but uh I'm

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.569 
just for doesn't fall over but uh I'm
thinking<00:00:46.379> to<00:00:46.469> be<00:00:46.530> stuck<00:00:46.770> down<00:00:46.920> anyways<00:00:47.340> too

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
thinking to be stuck down anyways too

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.549 
thinking to be stuck down anyways too
but<00:00:47.789> uh<00:00:47.820> here's<00:00:48.690> what's<00:00:48.870> gonna<00:00:49.020> happen<00:00:49.140> till

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
but uh here's what's gonna happen till

you're gonna push this love we're gonna
bring<00:00:51.960> a<00:00:52.079> robot<00:00:52.410> you're<00:00:52.710> going<00:00:52.860> to<00:00:52.920> push<00:00:53.100> it

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
bring a robot you're going to push it

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.220 
bring a robot you're going to push it
it's<00:00:53.879> gonna<00:00:54.000> fall<00:00:54.300> down<00:00:54.360> is<00:00:54.750> this<00:00:54.899> thing<00:00:55.079> right

it's gonna fall down is this thing right
here<00:00:55.309> your<00:00:56.309> robot<00:00:56.579> is<00:00:56.610> probably<00:00:56.910> have<00:00:57.090> to

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
here your robot is probably have to

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.500 
here your robot is probably have to
retrieve<00:00:57.570> it<00:00:57.859> somehow<00:00:59.059> bring<00:01:00.059> it<00:01:00.180> down<00:01:00.329> to

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
retrieve it somehow bring it down to

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:01.970 
retrieve it somehow bring it down to
base<00:01:00.690> and<00:01:00.840> what<00:01:00.930> it<00:01:01.020> is<00:01:01.140> it<00:01:01.350> just<00:01:01.559> like<00:01:01.649> some

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
base and what it is it just like some

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.529 
base and what it is it just like some
kind<00:01:02.190> of<00:01:02.250> like<00:01:02.460> you<00:01:02.640> can<00:01:02.789> see<00:01:02.910> lego<00:01:03.090> string<00:01:03.420> on

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
kind of like you can see lego string on

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.219 
kind of like you can see lego string on
here<00:01:03.719> just<00:01:04.350> a<00:01:04.500> pulley<00:01:04.739> system<00:01:05.240> somehow<00:01:06.240> hook

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
here just a pulley system somehow hook

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.100 
here just a pulley system somehow hook
it<00:01:07.409> to<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:08.299> airplane<00:01:09.299> or<00:01:09.570> something<00:01:09.960> like

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
it to the airplane or something like

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.830 
it to the airplane or something like
that<00:01:10.170> just<00:01:10.770> hook<00:01:10.920> at<00:01:11.070> someone<00:01:11.460> way<00:01:12.270> right<00:01:12.570> like

this get it hooked on like that and then

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.380 
this get it hooked on like that and then
you're<00:01:20.280> gonna<00:01:20.369> see<00:01:20.580> as<00:01:20.700> you<00:01:20.850> pull<00:01:21.090> it<00:01:21.240> it's

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
you're gonna see as you pull it it's

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.880 
you're gonna see as you pull it it's
gonna<00:01:21.570> actually<00:01:23.030> go<00:01:24.530> put<00:01:25.530> have<00:01:25.619> it<00:01:25.740> upside

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
gonna actually go put have it upside

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.190 
gonna actually go put have it upside
down<00:01:26.040> like<00:01:26.280> this<00:01:26.430> it's<00:01:26.640> gonna<00:01:26.810> well<00:01:27.810> nevermind

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
down like this it's gonna well nevermind

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.899 
down like this it's gonna well nevermind
who<00:01:28.380> is<00:01:28.530> this<00:01:28.650> but<00:01:29.159> you<00:01:29.430> can<00:01:29.549> see<00:01:29.729> you're

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
who is this but you can see you're

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.960 
who is this but you can see you're
probably<00:01:30.060> not<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.540> pull<00:01:31.500> it<00:01:31.680> back<00:01:31.979> using<00:01:32.759> this

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
probably not the pull it back using this

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.080 
probably not the pull it back using this
and<00:01:33.360> pulled<00:01:33.659> onto<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:34.049> runway<00:01:34.229> or<00:01:35.040> into<00:01:35.909> that

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
and pulled onto the runway or into that

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.170 
and pulled onto the runway or into that
like<00:01:36.329> blue<00:01:36.780> or<00:01:36.960> yellow<00:01:36.990> it<00:01:37.500> maybe<00:01:38.400> if<00:01:38.850> you<00:01:38.970> have

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
like blue or yellow it maybe if you have

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.300 
like blue or yellow it maybe if you have
it<00:01:39.299> in<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.509> yellow<00:01:39.750> arrow<00:01:40.020> area<00:01:40.829> you<00:01:41.040> get<00:01:41.189> this

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
it in the yellow arrow area you get this
