00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:47.000
 raspberries a caravan so we go 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:47.000
 break so yellow a first 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:01:05.250
 a second son 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:05.250
 we'll put them by harry the way 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.590
 here we need permission from a 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:17.500
 ribbon let's take a body and a little 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:23.229
 little use of orange juice on two 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:25.530
 centilitres and no2 centilitres of cream 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:25.530
 raspberry 

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:47.990
 you have to mix one for one 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:52.430
 ten minutes that is very smooth 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:58.820
 that young people can leather you talk 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:02:03.680
 ribbons see we see that to the eye the 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:06.380
 shape of the edge then the strawberries whose 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:09.320
 to wash with the tail to prevent that 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:14.180
 water make it go with a thrifty 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:18.250
 we will remove the hard part it's 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.250
 very simple very quickly 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:29.160
 we'll do we'll do both 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.160
 strips 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:47.470
 we will put some raspberries 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.950
 we will keep some for the 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.950
 presentation 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:04.810
 here I apply I know hatchback are 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:04.810
 red fruits 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:21.209
 do things that divide them into 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:24.360
 two two ovens we will have them treated 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:25.680
 open oven like that the choice is 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.440
 open it's easy because the 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:31.040
 resistance is always on was going 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:35.160
 good red so it goes much faster 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:38.030
 and we're going second process we're going 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.030
 apply to the torch 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:05.130
 there I was told that she then sends the 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:08.760
 channel advantage is instantaneous 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:11.430
 we make a small road that cuts a 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:15.120
 little thicker there is below it's going 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:17.910
 stay very soft in the oven part grid 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:22.650
 so that's going to be a little bit 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:33.169
 more even tan that's so 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:33.169
 similar little carambola refers to 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:42.600
 strawberries always a little bit of 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:45.080
 colors that fart white here we are 

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:52.430
 obliged to put on all surfaces 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:52.430
 that will be enjoyed
