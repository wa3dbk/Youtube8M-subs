00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
on the KitKat bass drum which was only

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.810 
on the KitKat bass drum which was only
on<00:00:42.239> a<00:00:42.270> 4-point<00:00:42.719> 1.2<00:00:43.320> version<00:00:43.530> but<00:00:44.280> this<00:00:44.520> one<00:00:44.730> is

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820
