 I already more titles followed often I can not 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:43.990
 say although it was more than advertised 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:47.799
 until yesterday we did not know how it really is 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:49.960
 the samsung galaxy s 6 good the why 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:52.360

 presentation was present in the 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:10.000
 comparison of course with all 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.250
 characteristics in which the galaxy s 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.380
 6 are better than the apple product 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:17.590
 although there were also some comments 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:19.870
 curious after the show apart 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.730
 of the many colors to choose the 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.610
 Samsung's new range does not seem 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:27.489
 submersible as the s 5 your battery has 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:30.250
 less capacity but it is loaded before and from 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:31.030
 wirelessly with a range of 4 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.340
 hours 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.860
 minutes let's go we want to mess with 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.990
 him and see if he convinces us by the way 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.420
 we also found out that there will be glasses 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:44.560
 of new virtual reality thanks to the 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:46.330
 collaboration between samsung and oculus does 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.850
 years that kate ninhue started talking 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.470
 of virtual reality and some are 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:52.959
 they believed that huff light or would be the 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:54.940
 champion of a revolution but was 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:58.239
 clear that I could not lose Have 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.860
 live 3 to that is why sir level then 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:01.630
 as we get tired of the subject we 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.420
 let's limit to talk about what 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:06.730
 we know that htc has allied with valve 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:09.070
 to create their own reality glasses 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.420
 virtual with a project that seemed 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:12.970
 half abandoned among those responsible 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:15.610
 of steam but that has not stopped giving him 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:17.709
 laps for years as hub live 3 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.660
 anda truth that we will not worry 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:22.269
 being taught in the game actually 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.870
 virtual and they tell us that this way or nothing 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:26.140
 without glasses 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:29.019
 there is no morgan freeman this fat the 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.940
 game has already passed the time of the 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:32.380
 filtration of the mutated dinosaur more 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:35.620
 fierce of the history of Jurassic park 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:37.630
 that of having official toys sometimes 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:40.330
 we are surprised by the surprise 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:42.760
 but look that the bug is ugly and it's not going to 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:45.160
 come just because universal studios have 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.170
 shown a few more and if there 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:49.870
 many meat and saurians even have wings 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:51.880
 so we'll have to wait and see how the 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:54.220
 control in the park is good 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:57.040
 suppose that badly because if not no 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:59.320

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:02.560

 gibson or liam neeson as protagonists 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:17.440
