00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.039 
centimeters barely at all and you you
want<00:02:51.859> to<00:02:51.980> test<00:02:52.159> this<00:02:52.310> out<00:02:52.489> because<00:02:52.730> this<00:02:53.090> can

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:54.049 
want to test this out because this can

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:57.670 
want to test this out because this can
destroy<00:02:55.010> your<00:02:55.040> disc<00:02:55.430> if<00:02:56.239> you<00:02:56.750> tweak<00:02:57.170> it<00:02:57.349> way

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
destroy your disc if you tweak it way

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.339 
destroy your disc if you tweak it way
too<00:02:57.739> much<00:02:58.099> as<00:02:58.340> this<00:02:58.549> laser<00:02:58.969> right<00:02:59.629> here<00:02:59.840> that

00:03:00.339 --> 00:03:00.349 
too much as this laser right here that

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:03.750 
too much as this laser right here that
can<00:03:00.530> turn<00:03:00.769> into<00:03:00.829> elicit<00:03:01.579> that<00:03:01.609> overthrew<00:03:02.590> wall

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
can turn into elicit that overthrew wall

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.080 
can turn into elicit that overthrew wall
that<00:03:05.349> but<00:03:06.349> once<00:03:06.590> you<00:03:07.129> do<00:03:07.280> that<00:03:07.310> you<00:03:07.700> just<00:03:07.730> turn

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
that but once you do that you just turn

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:09.909 
that but once you do that you just turn
back<00:03:08.120> on<00:03:08.299> your<00:03:08.569> xbox<00:03:08.780> it'll<00:03:09.349> be<00:03:09.439> perfectly

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:09.919 
back on your xbox it'll be perfectly

00:03:09.919 --> 00:03:11.649 
back on your xbox it'll be perfectly
okay<00:03:10.280> you'll<00:03:10.489> never<00:03:10.730> get<00:03:10.909> bad<00:03:11.090> for<00:03:11.359> this<00:03:11.449> at

00:03:11.649 --> 00:03:11.659 
okay you'll never get bad for this at

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:13.509 
okay you'll never get bad for this at
all<00:03:11.810> it's<00:03:12.169> just<00:03:12.560> speaking<00:03:12.949> the<00:03:12.980> voltage<00:03:13.370> of

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:13.519 
all it's just speaking the voltage of

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:16.479 
all it's just speaking the voltage of
the<00:03:13.669> laser<00:03:14.199> making<00:03:15.199> it<00:03:15.319> out<00:03:15.709> put<00:03:16.069> more<00:03:16.280> power

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:16.489 
the laser making it out put more power

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:19.659 
the laser making it out put more power
because<00:03:17.030> over<00:03:17.689> time<00:03:17.719> lasers<00:03:18.590> lose<00:03:19.189> their

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:19.669 
because over time lasers lose their

00:03:19.669 --> 00:03:21.699 
because over time lasers lose their
strength<00:03:19.909> so<00:03:20.510> you<00:03:21.230> have<00:03:21.319> to<00:03:21.439> tweak<00:03:21.680> the

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:21.709 
strength so you have to tweak the

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:23.530 
strength so you have to tweak the
voltage<00:03:22.189> so<00:03:22.400> it<00:03:22.519> gets<00:03:22.609> from<00:03:22.849> power<00:03:23.030> to<00:03:23.299> it<00:03:23.419> and

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
voltage so it gets from power to it and

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.500 
voltage so it gets from power to it and
then<00:03:24.379> it<00:03:24.799> will<00:03:24.949> read<00:03:25.099> your<00:03:25.250> discs<00:03:25.579> more<00:03:26.120> it

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
then it will read your discs more it

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:28.390 
then it will read your discs more it
will<00:03:26.599> have<00:03:26.719> better<00:03:26.900> quality<00:03:27.139> you'll<00:03:27.829> load

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
will have better quality you'll load

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.149 
will have better quality you'll load
faster<00:03:29.000> than<00:03:29.150> everything<00:03:29.389> else<00:03:29.650> please<00:03:30.650> rate
