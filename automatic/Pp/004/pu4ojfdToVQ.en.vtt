making<00:00:18.570> an<00:00:18.779> effort<00:00:18.900> to<00:00:19.710> basically<00:00:19.980> just

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
making an effort to basically just

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.189 
making an effort to basically just
revamp<00:00:20.699> the<00:00:20.939> entire<00:00:20.970> halo<00:00:21.480> universe<00:00:21.779> as<00:00:22.170> we

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
revamp the entire halo universe as we

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:23.509 
revamp the entire halo universe as we
know<00:00:22.380> it<00:00:22.529> at<00:00:22.740> least<00:00:22.769> from<00:00:23.039> a<00:00:23.189> technical

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
know it at least from a technical

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.730 
know it at least from a technical
standpoint<00:00:23.910> so<00:00:24.900> what<00:00:25.080> does<00:00:25.199> that<00:00:25.320> mean<00:00:25.529> that

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
standpoint so what does that mean that

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.099 
standpoint so what does that mean that
means<00:00:25.859> that<00:00:26.279> the<00:00:26.369> graphics<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.420> sound<00:00:27.720> and

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
means that the graphics the sound and

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.320 
means that the graphics the sound and
even<00:00:28.410> things<00:00:28.590> like<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:28.830> AI<00:00:28.949> are<00:00:29.550> getting

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
even things like the AI are getting

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.130 
even things like the AI are getting
completely<00:00:30.689> overhauled<00:00:31.289> for<00:00:31.890> Halo<00:00:32.250> Reach<00:00:33.140> we

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
stuff like that in this map we also got

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.270 
stuff like that in this map we also got
to<00:01:32.939> see<00:01:33.170> like<00:01:34.170> in<00:01:34.290> Halo<00:01:34.439> 3<00:01:34.530> used<00:01:34.950> to<00:01:35.040> be<00:01:35.100> able<00:01:35.159> to

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
to see like in Halo 3 used to be able to

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.340 
to see like in Halo 3 used to be able to
get<00:01:35.369> upgrades<00:01:35.790> for<00:01:36.000> your<00:01:36.150> equipment<00:01:36.570> but

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
get upgrades for your equipment but

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.899 
get upgrades for your equipment but
they'd<00:01:37.619> only<00:01:37.740> be<00:01:37.950> sort<00:01:38.159> of<00:01:38.189> a<00:01:38.280> one-time<00:01:38.729> use

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
they'd only be sort of a one-time use
