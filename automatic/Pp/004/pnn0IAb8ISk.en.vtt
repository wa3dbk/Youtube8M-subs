00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.059
 you ask why games and 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.469
 because the name of this channel is 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.539

 a game that is in the background for you and 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.799

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.330
 that's the way it is pronounced 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.939

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:13.220

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:18.370

 concerned are 150 and boys keep world was 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:27.280
 the first park site in belgium 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:29.020
 how are you watching the pictures? 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.270
 horror movie scenario but the location 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.430
 was not always so in the 50s a 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.740
 famous park in belgium that was 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.450
 near a church the family takes the 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.610
 children in the church and turn left the 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.710
 children playing in the park 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.660
 only contemplation was not closed and 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.010
 abandoned and today it's there right? 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:47.680
 looking like a scary movie scenario 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:49.420
 Dude, I wanted this place right. 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.160
 He is up to being demolished. 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.750
 since 2002 it is to be demolished only 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:55.450
 Nothing to this day, right? 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.250
 So let's go to the second place. 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.110
 the second place is the island of the dolls in the 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.330
 Mexico was in this place is very bizarre 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:04.600
 and the story behind it is not 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:06.430
 very tense also in 1951 she had 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.720
 I played in the place she ended up dying 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.520
 drowned 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.899
 she died drowning trying to get her 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.760
 Doll fell on the lake 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:14.140
 there the residents began to speak 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.150
 I was listening to the cry of the child. 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:19.000
 I was listening to the child crying the day 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:21.790
 all and one of these locals known 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.709
 as a gift julian in having an idea, right? 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.230
 It's kind of strange he got the idea of leaving. 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:28.330
 picking up dolls donated by others 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.920
 residents to put in the place that 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.870
 The child died will be exploring the 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.580
 dolls near the place that the child 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.239
 died he thought so he would be 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:39.010
 helping neda make the child stop 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:41.500
 cry or the soul of the child I do not know 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.720
 that was right there and the strangest 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.530
 In addition, in 2001 he 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.510
 died 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.890
 the Sun Julian he died in the same place 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.680
 that the child died 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.810
 no man is very tense and a place he 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.150
 I ended up getting this look it 's 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:57.280
 horror movie full of dolls in the 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.110
 trees old dolls all weird 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.090
 Dude, I do not have the courage to stand up. 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.580
 get out of nowhere 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:06.220
 Let's go to the gallery for the third place. 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:08.290
 third place is the catacombs of paris 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.850

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.070
 empire of death, right? 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.970
 it has a gigantic form of tourism 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:15.070

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:21.760

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:24.700

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.960
 in this place is formed by several tunnels 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.510
 that stay there do not climb 

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:36.340
 I speak of the French capital is how it is 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:38.530
 several tunnels are not all open to the 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.810

 only that there is a lot of information about this 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:51.250

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:53.890
 video is interim about the joelma building 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:56.140

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:00.760
 Mexico, in fact, his name is not 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.590
 witch market 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:03.940
 this is just a skin of his name is the 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:07.030
 sound market 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:08.830
 it was inaugurated in 1950 but today 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:10.540
 guys, it's a fair, you can say that 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:12.280
 the scariest fair on the planet is 

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:14.350
 full of barracks, right? 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:16.510
 there you find everything lies to the 

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:19.990
 seven day candle in 100 pictures

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:23.950
 Inacio the motto galera because it's a lot 

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:26.740
 thing would not be able to decorate manuals 

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:30.250

 there with someone right? 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:37.180
 The problem is who posted it, but that's okay. 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:39.340
 People do not do this, it's very ugly. 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:42.160
 No one should do this on the skull of a 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:44.449
 monkey and even live face guy is 

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:46.039
 very tense is a very strange place 

00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:49.099
 and I do not have the slightest desire either 

00:05:46.039 --> 00:05:52.099
 to know more but then some place was 

00:05:49.099 --> 00:05:54.289
 to this list of mysterious places 

00:05:52.099 --> 00:05:56.509
 then go to the next local law 

00:05:54.289 --> 00:05:59.059
 and last census in this list of 

00:05:56.509 --> 00:06:00.860
 mysterious places and an angico lake unites 

00:05:59.059 --> 00:06:03.020
 in Canada I do not know if that 's how it is 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:04.460
 pronounced but okay right history has 

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:07.099
 This one to change the crowd happened in 

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:09.050
 1930 when the hunter he knew 

00:06:07.099 --> 00:06:10.370
 the area of the lake because it is 

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:12.169
 quite a village was also 

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:13.819
 near this lake he was in that 

00:06:12.169 --> 00:06:15.620
 village looking for a place to spend 

00:06:13.819 --> 00:06:16.939
 the night had already passed several nights 

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:18.589
 in that place, right? 

00:06:16.939 --> 00:06:20.719
 he realized that there was no one else 

00:06:18.589 --> 00:06:22.310
 in the place there was no one even seems 

00:06:20.719 --> 00:06:24.589
 that people people place 

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:27.050
 evaporated people had no one else 

00:06:24.589 --> 00:06:29.449
 left food left clothing weapons 

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:31.729
 and the only thing he found for 1 

00:06:29.449 --> 00:06:33.379
 There were some dead dogs, right? 

00:06:31.729 --> 00:06:34.819
 according to the myth galley various lights 

00:06:33.379 --> 00:06:36.770
 were seen there on top of that village 

00:06:34.819 --> 00:06:39.649
 there and people started some 

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:41.449
 theories is that it was the fault of ghosts 

00:06:39.649 --> 00:06:43.370
 extraterrestrials and even little galerinha 

00:06:41.449 --> 00:06:46.159
 Vampires, do not you think vampires are talking? 

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:46.969
 and assumed it is with the villagers but nobody 

00:06:46.159 --> 00:06:48.529
 You know right 

00:06:46.969 --> 00:06:50.749
 no one knows what the real cause was 

00:06:48.529 --> 00:06:52.189
 of the disappearance of these people and now I'm going 

00:06:50.749 --> 00:06:54.620
 talk a little about the game or what 

00:06:52.189 --> 00:06:55.939
 rolling and background gameplay the daylight o 

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:58.219

 escape from an abandoned hospital in her 

00:07:01.999 --> 00:07:06.229

00:07:03.949 --> 00:07:07.909

00:07:06.229 --> 00:07:09.949
