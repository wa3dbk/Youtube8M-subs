00:01:21.889 --> 00:01:21.899 
building this instrument was to

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:24.959 
building this instrument was to
basically<00:01:22.950> embody<00:01:23.950> all<00:01:24.250> of<00:01:24.399> the<00:01:24.490> qualities<00:01:24.939> of

00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:24.969 
basically embody all of the qualities of

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:27.899 
basically embody all of the qualities of
a<00:01:25.149> semi<00:01:25.509> hollow<00:01:25.750> of<00:01:26.020> their<00:01:26.200> famous<00:01:26.500> 335<00:01:27.459> guitar

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:27.909 
a semi hollow of their famous 335 guitar

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:32.209 
a semi hollow of their famous 335 guitar
but<00:01:28.270> in<00:01:28.509> a<00:01:28.600> smaller<00:01:28.959> size<00:01:29.380> so<00:01:29.799> this<00:01:30.610> is<00:01:30.959> almost

00:01:32.209 --> 00:01:32.219 
but in a smaller size so this is almost

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:35.699 
but in a smaller size so this is almost
on<00:01:33.219> this<00:01:33.819> length<00:01:34.119> maybe<00:01:34.929> an<00:01:35.229> inch<00:01:35.500> or<00:01:35.649> so

00:01:35.699 --> 00:01:35.709 
on this length maybe an inch or so

00:01:35.709 --> 00:01:39.510 
on this length maybe an inch or so
bigger<00:01:36.130> than<00:01:36.369> a<00:01:36.399> Les<00:01:37.179> Paul<00:01:37.450> guitar<00:01:37.860> so<00:01:38.860> it's

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
bigger than a Les Paul guitar so it's

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.929

it's<00:01:39.880> very<00:01:40.209> very<00:01:40.899> comfortably<00:01:41.619> and<00:01:41.950> it<00:01:42.819> is

it's very very comfortably and it is

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:46.260 
it's very very comfortably and it is
somewhat<00:01:43.239> lighter<00:01:43.539> than<00:01:44.470> a<00:01:44.500> regular<00:01:45.270> es-335
