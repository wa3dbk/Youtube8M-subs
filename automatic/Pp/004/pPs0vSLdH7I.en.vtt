00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.560
 Welcome to a new video 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:04.890
 It's about the blues park today 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.540
 go 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.059
 My new microphone that you bought me 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.380
 because my sound quality he did not like that 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.880
 that was Bernese and therefore hold me 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.940
 Just buy me a new one 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.500
 microphone and that's just the plus park 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.090
 and I would like to do that now 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.680
 with you in this video once 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.770
 I wish you much now 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.770
 fun 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.300
 as some may already know 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:38.650
 my sound was not that hit 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.690
 and that's why I agree 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:42.460
 decided to buy the blues park 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.200
 The device is in a very nice 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.660
 packaging is therefore packed 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:48.790
 Definitely worth unboxing after 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.739
 the cardboard box has been removed 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:52.660
 a red stable and very high quality 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:55.030
 Wooden box to the fore 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:57.580
 this carries the lettering spark on the 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.440
 the box is opened on the upper side 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:01.840
 by pushing the lid to the side 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.509
 where we then look directly paperwork 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.040
 on the one hand the blues bar 

00:01:03.509 --> 00:01:08.560
 instructions for use a blues ticker and 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.240
 yet another prospectus or at 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.070
 the microphone has to go to the 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.899
 foam lining to be raised 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.720
 and then we already see direct 

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:18.399
 complete important content is included 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.960
 on the one hand the spider the counter-attacks 

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:22.930
 should help and made of high quality 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.789
 heavy metal is also the 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.009
 Extremely stylish head protection 

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:28.810
 but also not made of metal 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:30.940
 should bring too much why 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.950
 bigger already on the way to me 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.690
 and last but not least the microphone 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.660
 which somehow not at all 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:39.880
 Names of the company fits and red is orange 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:41.979
 Also the microphone is heavy and very 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:45.399
 high quality for the price is on 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:47.410
 every case a very good quality 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:49.119
 Construction simply has to be in the microphone 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:51.280
 Spider can be rotated and this can 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:53.229
 then for example on an extra tripod 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.450
 be attached as I made it here 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:57.459
 have that is very handy there so the 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.950
 size and position of the tripod simple 

00:01:57.459 --> 00:02:01.209
 can be adjusted 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.280
 then the pope has to go to the 

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:04.810
 also be screwed that it 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.149
 simply bypasses super fast 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.280
 Now the microphone is almost ready for use 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:11.560
 but one thing is missing, namely the blue 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.660
 eyes hill a usb interface to 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.970
 connect the blues park with one 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.250
 laptop or pc 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:20.380
 because the blues bar is not an xlr microphone 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.330
 is also new xl he connection available 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.370
 and for that is just a kind of converter 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.819
 needed in this case the blue eyes 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.890
 Incl 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:28.540
 this can either be directly into the blues 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.760
 bank be plugged or per 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.209
 then extended xlr cable attached 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.550
 become 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:35.440
 Also my xlr cable is still on the way 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:38.500
 but then should the next few days 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.030
 make another sound test 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.240
 Of course, all this already wanted with the 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.860
 blues park recorded and listening now 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.540
 her my previous one sound quality 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.750
 real and 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:51.480
 or that would be there with my latest one 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.709
 video and unboxing to blues park 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.909
 Of course I would like to have yours now 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:56.040
 opinion and in the comments know 

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:57.989
 what do you think of my new sound 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.939
 quality is better and what did you think 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:01.709
 her the comparison between before and 

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:03.269
 after that video folds fallen since 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.260
 Of course you are welcome to thumb 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:06.450
 press the high button 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.799
 I would be very happy and also 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.090
 I still have a question for you it is 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:11.040
 you noticed that I am green 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.989
 screen and there my 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.519
 room imagined also that can 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:15.659
 you like to be honest in the please 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:16.349
 Write comments It is you 

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:18.120
 noticed 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:20.670
 do you look great or is it all that way? 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.379
 quite cool as before in 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.879
 my previous videos because I have 

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:25.470
 never worked with green screen 

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:26.939
 that would be it from this video me 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.709
 Hope you liked it and we see 

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:31.159
 us next time until then 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:31.159
 take care 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:40.519
 again
