coffee<00:02:12.660> I'm<00:02:13.110> just<00:02:13.410> using<00:02:13.650> approximate

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
coffee I'm just using approximate

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.550 
coffee I'm just using approximate
everything<00:02:15.120> here<00:02:15.780> just<00:02:16.170> to<00:02:18.260> just<00:02:19.260> for<00:02:19.440> the

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
everything here just to just for the

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.040 
everything here just to just for the
purposes<00:02:20.310> of<00:02:20.370> this<00:02:20.670> video<00:02:20.940> not<00:02:21.840> going<00:02:21.960> to

purposes of this video not going to

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.290 
purposes of this video not going to
measure<00:02:22.170> anything<00:02:22.560> out<00:02:22.860> my<00:02:23.550> water<00:02:23.820> is<00:02:24.060> just

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
measure anything out my water is just

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.050 
measure anything out my water is just
off<00:02:24.510> a<00:02:24.540> boil<00:02:24.990> I<00:02:25.680> think<00:02:26.520> there's<00:02:26.880> a<00:02:26.910> lot<00:02:27.030> of

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
off a boil I think there's a lot of

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.030 
off a boil I think there's a lot of
debate<00:02:27.330> over<00:02:27.630> what<00:02:27.860> temperature<00:02:28.860> you're

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
debate over what temperature you're

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.310 
debate over what temperature you're
using<00:02:30.500> with<00:02:31.670> the<00:02:32.670> Aeropress<00:02:33.150> you<00:02:33.900> know<00:02:34.020> their

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
using with the Aeropress you know their

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.370 
using with the Aeropress you know their
standard<00:02:35.040> temperature<00:02:35.250> is<00:02:35.520> pretty<00:02:35.820> low<00:02:36.380> I've

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
standard temperature is pretty low I've

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:38.930 
standard temperature is pretty low I've
been<00:02:37.680> experimenting<00:02:38.160> with<00:02:38.490> something<00:02:38.820> a

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
been experimenting with something a

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.120 
been experimenting with something a
little<00:02:39.120> bit<00:02:39.300> higher<00:02:39.510> so<00:02:39.950> definitely<00:02:40.950> off

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
little bit higher so definitely off

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:48.410 
little bit higher so definitely off
boiled<00:02:41.610> up<00:02:42.380> mix<00:02:43.380> it<00:02:43.470> up

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.580 

seal<00:02:49.140> it<00:02:49.170> up<00:02:49.349> and<00:02:49.560> then<00:02:49.650> there's<00:02:49.830> a<00:02:50.060> steep<00:02:51.060> time

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
seal it up and then there's a steep time

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.080 
seal it up and then there's a steep time
aeropress<00:02:52.590> says<00:02:52.830> I<00:02:52.980> think<00:02:53.160> I<00:02:53.400> think<00:02:53.910> they<00:02:53.970> say

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
aeropress says I think I think they say

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.640 
aeropress says I think I think they say
10<00:02:54.330> seconds<00:02:54.780> on<00:02:54.870> the<00:02:54.959> box<00:02:55.140> with<00:02:55.349> like<00:02:55.500> that<00:02:55.620> I

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
10 seconds on the box with like that I

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.229 
10 seconds on the box with like that I
don't<00:02:55.770> think<00:02:56.010> that's<00:02:56.099> enough<00:02:56.430> I<00:02:56.670> usually<00:02:57.180> do

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
don't think that's enough I usually do

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:00.320 
don't think that's enough I usually do
something<00:02:57.569> more<00:02:57.780> like<00:02:57.959> 20<00:02:58.650> and<00:02:58.860> then<00:02:59.670> there's

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
something more like 20 and then there's

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.030 
something more like 20 and then there's
the<00:03:00.480> actual<00:03:00.840> amount<00:03:01.260> of<00:03:01.440> time<00:03:01.680> that<00:03:01.709> you're

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
the actual amount of time that you're

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.260 
the actual amount of time that you're
gonna<00:03:02.239> push<00:03:03.239> down<00:03:03.480> on<00:03:03.510> it<00:03:04.670> again<00:03:05.670> I<00:03:06.030> think

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:06.270 
gonna push down on it again I think

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:07.640 
gonna push down on it again I think
you're<00:03:06.360> going<00:03:06.480> to<00:03:06.569> do<00:03:06.630> that<00:03:06.810> a<00:03:07.020> little<00:03:07.470> bit

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
you're going to do that a little bit

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.790 
you're going to do that a little bit
slower<00:03:08.239> about<00:03:09.239> 20<00:03:09.630> if<00:03:10.110> you<00:03:10.260> really<00:03:10.530> curious

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
slower about 20 if you really curious

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.340 
slower about 20 if you really curious
about<00:03:10.950> the<00:03:11.459> different<00:03:11.819> stuff<00:03:12.030> you<00:03:12.239> should<00:03:12.450> not

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
about the different stuff you should not

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:14.509 
about the different stuff you should not
all<00:03:13.470> these<00:03:13.590> different<00:03:13.739> variables<00:03:14.190> rather<00:03:14.370> you

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
all these different variables rather you

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:16.520 
all these different variables rather you
should<00:03:14.550> check<00:03:14.910> out<00:03:15.030> brew<00:03:15.450> methods<00:03:15.989> calm

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
should check out brew methods calm

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.150 
should check out brew methods calm
there's<00:03:17.010> a<00:03:17.100> lot<00:03:17.130> of<00:03:17.250> good<00:03:17.340> write-ups<00:03:18.209> there<00:03:18.420> on

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
there's a lot of good write-ups there on

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.410 
there's a lot of good write-ups there on
best<00:03:20.160> practices<00:03:20.670> and<00:03:20.730> what<00:03:21.090> people<00:03:21.330> have

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
best practices and what people have

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.960 
best practices and what people have
found<00:03:21.600> with<00:03:22.590> different<00:03:23.040> methods<00:03:23.459> of<00:03:23.550> brewing

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
found with different methods of brewing

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.090 
found with different methods of brewing
and<00:03:24.120> aeropress<00:03:24.720> is<00:03:24.989> a<00:03:25.019> there's<00:03:25.620> at<00:03:25.709> least<00:03:25.739> 10

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
and aeropress is a there's at least 10

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.160 
and aeropress is a there's at least 10
or<00:03:26.280> 15<00:03:26.610> different<00:03:26.760> options<00:03:27.239> there<00:03:27.420> if<00:03:27.989> you

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
or 15 different options there if you

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:29.539 
or 15 different options there if you
want<00:03:28.350> to<00:03:28.410> read<00:03:28.650> what<00:03:28.860> the<00:03:28.950> experts<00:03:29.280> have<00:03:29.340> to

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 
want to read what the experts have to

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:33.740 
want to read what the experts have to
say<00:03:31.280> that's<00:03:32.280> getting<00:03:32.519> on<00:03:32.610> 20<00:03:32.790> seconds<00:03:33.150> so

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
say that's getting on 20 seconds so

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:38.210 
say that's getting on 20 seconds so
we'll<00:03:33.930> give<00:03:34.049> it<00:03:34.080> a<00:03:34.200> press<00:03:37.100> it's<00:03:38.100> definitely

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
we'll give it a press it's definitely

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:43.490 
we'll give it a press it's definitely
harder<00:03:38.730> to<00:03:38.880> press<00:03:39.180> than<00:03:40.170> a<00:03:40.819> paper<00:03:41.819> filter<00:03:42.470> so<00:03:43.470> i

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
harder to press than a paper filter so i

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.949 
harder to press than a paper filter so i
might<00:03:43.890> have<00:03:44.040> grounded<00:03:44.760> a<00:03:45.000> grind<00:03:45.810> of<00:03:45.930> the

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
might have grounded a grind of the

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:49.809 
might have grounded a grind of the
coffee<00:03:46.700> ground<00:03:47.700> the<00:03:47.940> coffee<00:03:48.180> too<00:03:48.600> fine

00:03:49.809 --> 00:03:49.819 
coffee ground the coffee too fine

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:54.199 
coffee ground the coffee too fine
because<00:03:50.819> this<00:03:51.239> is<00:03:51.450> not<00:03:52.230> going<00:03:52.590> down<00:03:53.209> very

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
because this is not going down very

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:59.569 
because this is not going down very
easily<00:03:54.390> I<00:03:57.410> might<00:03:58.410> have<00:03:58.500> clogged<00:03:58.890> the<00:03:59.190> filters

00:03:59.569 --> 00:03:59.579 
easily I might have clogged the filters

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:01.099 
easily I might have clogged the filters
I'm<00:03:59.730> saying<00:04:00.030> although<00:04:00.239> like<00:04:00.660> I<00:04:00.720> said<00:04:00.930> the<00:04:00.989> guy

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:01.109

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
I talked to you booked at the coffee

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.190 
I talked to you booked at the coffee

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.500 

let's<00:04:16.040> put<00:04:16.160> that<00:04:16.280> aside

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:21.170 

and<00:04:19.130> it's<00:04:20.130> not<00:04:20.190> how<00:04:20.370> much<00:04:20.490> you<00:04:20.550> can<00:04:20.790> see<00:04:21.000> with

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
and it's not how much you can see with

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:27.370 
and it's not how much you can see with
the<00:04:21.330> coffee<00:04:21.650> now<00:04:25.250> put<00:04:26.250> it<00:04:26.280> in<00:04:26.400> usually

goes

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:49.470 

pretty<00:04:45.200> good<00:04:45.410> I<00:04:45.710> think<00:04:46.340> I<00:04:46.460> ground<00:04:47.120> it<00:04:48.400> too

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:49.480

finally it can be hard to pick up the
grunt<00:04:54.560> sighs<00:04:54.770> but<00:04:55.010> I<00:04:55.040> did<00:04:55.280> this<00:04:55.570> one<00:04:56.570> step<00:04:56.870> into

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:57.290

the aeropress sooner or later I'll test
out<00:05:44.360> the<00:05:44.480> one<00:05:44.630> for<00:05:44.840> the<00:05:44.870> filter<00:05:45.320> cone<00:05:45.530> and<00:05:45.970> we

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:46.970 
out the one for the filter cone and we

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:48.160 
out the one for the filter cone and we
could<00:05:47.090> run<00:05:47.240> through<00:05:47.420> that<00:05:47.480> that<00:05:47.870> looks<00:05:48.020> like<00:05:48.110> a

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:48.170 
could run through that that looks like a

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:50.190 
could run through that that looks like a
lot<00:05:48.350> of<00:05:48.380> fun<00:05:48.590> too<00:05:48.830> I<00:05:49.040> would<00:05:49.730> say<00:05:49.850> definitely

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:50.200 
lot of fun too I would say definitely

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:54.310 
lot of fun too I would say definitely
its<00:05:51.200> cost<00:05:51.380> $15<00:05:52.100> so<00:05:52.460> that's<00:05:53.450> a<00:05:53.570> lot<00:05:53.870> of<00:05:53.900> paper

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:54.320 
its cost $15 so that's a lot of paper

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:57.700 
its cost $15 so that's a lot of paper
filters<00:05:54.800> but<00:05:55.780> $15<00:05:56.780> really<00:05:57.050> isn't<00:05:57.320> that<00:05:57.410> bad

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:57.710 
filters but $15 really isn't that bad

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:59.710 
filters but $15 really isn't that bad
for<00:05:57.770> a<00:05:58.070> cool<00:05:58.370> coffee<00:05:58.670> espresso<00:05:59.270> and<00:05:59.510> to

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:11.620 
experimenting and hopefully I'll get
some<00:06:10.550> better<00:06:10.670> idea<00:06:10.970> on<00:06:11.000> how<00:06:11.300> to<00:06:11.330> use<00:06:11.450> this

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:11.630 
some better idea on how to use this
