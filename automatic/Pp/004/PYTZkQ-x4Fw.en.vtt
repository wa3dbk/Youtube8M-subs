a<00:00:00.149> lot<00:00:00.599> of<00:00:00.630> people<00:00:00.900> know<00:00:01.050> obviously<00:00:01.620> what<00:00:01.800> fish

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:02.070 
a lot of people know obviously what fish

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.970 
a lot of people know obviously what fish
oil<00:00:02.370> is<00:00:02.669> what<00:00:03.060> is<00:00:03.149> krill<00:00:03.510> krill<00:00:04.410> is<00:00:04.589> different

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
oil is what is krill krill is different

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.309 
oil is what is krill krill is different
from<00:00:05.069> fish<00:00:05.370> oil<00:00:05.549> fish<00:00:05.879> oil<00:00:06.150> is<00:00:06.420> triglyceride

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
from fish oil fish oil is triglyceride

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.180 
from fish oil fish oil is triglyceride
based<00:00:07.620> and<00:00:08.510> and<00:00:09.510> krill<00:00:10.170> oil<00:00:10.320> is<00:00:10.710> a

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
based and and krill oil is a

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.450 
based and and krill oil is a
phospholipid<00:00:12.000> based<00:00:12.750> oil<00:00:13.880> this<00:00:14.880> is<00:00:15.089> a<00:00:15.120> very

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:16.460 
phospholipid based oil this is a very

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.320 
phospholipid based oil this is a very
significant<00:00:17.460> difference<00:00:17.609> between<00:00:18.000> the<00:00:18.300> two

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
significant difference between the two

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.099 
significant difference between the two
oils<00:00:18.930> also<00:00:19.770> fish<00:00:20.039> oil<00:00:20.390> again<00:00:21.390> has<00:00:21.630> been<00:00:21.810> around

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
oils also fish oil again has been around

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.880 
oils also fish oil again has been around
for<00:00:22.470> many<00:00:22.590> many<00:00:22.740> years<00:00:23.510> by<00:00:24.510> now<00:00:24.750> it<00:00:25.050> is<00:00:25.199> very

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
for many many years by now it is very

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.689 
for many many years by now it is very
synthetic<00:00:27.410> actually<00:00:28.410> during<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:28.980> process<00:00:29.490> of

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
synthetic actually during the process of

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.540 
synthetic actually during the process of
fish<00:00:29.970> oil<00:00:30.269> they<00:00:31.170> use<00:00:31.349> very<00:00:31.619> high<00:00:31.710> temperature

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
fish oil they use very high temperature

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.450 
fish oil they use very high temperature
they<00:00:33.300> strip<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:34.070> triglycerides<00:00:35.070> and<00:00:35.280> then

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
they strip the triglycerides and then

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.280 
they strip the triglycerides and then
Reece<00:00:35.730> terrify<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.360> fatty<00:00:36.719> acid<00:00:37.140> after

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
Reece terrify the fatty acid after

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.130 
Reece terrify the fatty acid after
concentrating<00:00:38.190> them<00:00:38.430> while<00:00:39.210> krill<00:00:39.660> oil<00:00:39.809> is

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
concentrating them while krill oil is

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.260 
concentrating them while krill oil is
something<00:00:40.739> that<00:00:41.040> is<00:00:41.160> very<00:00:41.399> close<00:00:41.910> to<00:00:41.940> its

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
something that is very close to its

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.779 
something that is very close to its
natural<00:00:43.050> source<00:00:43.379> it's<00:00:43.680> actually<00:00:44.100> something

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
natural source it's actually something

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.700 
natural source it's actually something
may<00:00:45.059> be<00:00:45.090> more<00:00:45.539> in<00:00:45.660> the<00:00:45.780> way<00:00:45.930> of<00:00:45.960> whole<00:00:46.379> foods

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
may be more in the way of whole foods

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.090 
may be more in the way of whole foods
it's<00:00:47.280> simply<00:00:47.789> taking<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.270> krill<00:00:48.809> and

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
it's simply taking the krill and

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.439 
it's simply taking the krill and
extracting<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.309> oil<00:00:50.340> from<00:00:50.879> it<00:00:51.059> and<00:00:51.239> getting

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
extracting the oil from it and getting

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.410 
extracting the oil from it and getting
it<00:00:51.690> in<00:00:51.899> in<00:00:52.079> a<00:00:52.530> form<00:00:52.890> that<00:00:53.010> is<00:00:53.160> a<00:00:53.309> lot<00:00:53.640> closer<00:00:54.030> to

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
it in in a form that is a lot closer to

as<00:01:15.659> in<00:01:15.960> Sandton<00:01:16.320> is<00:01:16.560> as<00:01:16.830> I<00:01:16.979> said<00:01:17.250> one<00:01:17.430> of<00:01:17.460> the

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
as in Sandton is as I said one of the

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.330 
as in Sandton is as I said one of the
most<00:01:18.000> powerful<00:01:18.270> natural<00:01:19.340> antioxidants

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
most powerful natural antioxidants

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.359 
most powerful natural antioxidants
antioxidants<00:01:21.119> are<00:01:21.869> were<00:01:22.290> also<00:01:22.890> found<00:01:23.100> to<00:01:23.340> be

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
antioxidants are were also found to be

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:24.740 
antioxidants are were also found to be
very<00:01:23.729> important

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
very important

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:30.140

level<00:01:34.049> down<00:01:34.259> in<00:01:35.159> and<00:01:36.119> and<00:01:36.329> they're<00:01:36.540> natural

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
level down in and and they're natural

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.960 
level down in and and they're natural
they<00:01:37.619> have<00:01:37.740> a<00:01:37.770> natural<00:01:38.220> source<00:01:38.460> in<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.729> krill

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
they have a natural source in the krill

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.480 
they have a natural source in the krill
they<00:01:39.630> simply<00:01:39.990> don't<00:01:40.140> exist<00:01:40.350> in<00:01:40.770> fish<00:01:41.009> or<00:01:41.310> at

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
they simply don't exist in fish or at

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.969 
they simply don't exist in fish or at
least<00:01:41.729> because<00:01:42.570> of<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:42.840> process<00:01:43.380> and<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.829> way

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
least because of the process and the way

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.760 
least because of the process and the way
fish<00:01:44.640> oil<00:01:44.880> is<00:01:45.000> extracted<00:01:45.420> and<00:01:45.689> because<00:01:46.170> the

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
fish oil is extracted and because the

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.240 
fish oil is extracted and because the
process<00:01:47.369> is<00:01:47.399> so<00:01:48.409> let's<00:01:49.409> say<00:01:49.560> as<00:01:50.009> I<00:01:50.220> said

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
process is so let's say as I said

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.020 
process is so let's say as I said
synthetic<00:01:51.119> you<00:01:51.689> don't<00:01:51.930> get<00:01:52.200> any<00:01:53.030> antioxidants

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
synthetic you don't get any antioxidants

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.139 
synthetic you don't get any antioxidants
with<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.329> fish<00:01:54.540> well<00:01:55.229> as<00:01:56.009> a<00:01:56.460> stag's<00:01:56.759> Antion

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
with the fish well as a stag's Antion

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.520 
with the fish well as a stag's Antion
which<00:01:57.469> exist<00:01:58.469> naturally<00:01:58.799> in<00:01:59.520> krill<00:02:00.530> is

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
which exist naturally in krill is

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.310 
which exist naturally in krill is
extracted<00:02:02.399> with<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:02.939> oil<00:02:03.119> so<00:02:04.049> you<00:02:04.110> actually

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
extracted with the oil so you actually

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.219 
extracted with the oil so you actually
have<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:04.770> natural<00:02:05.310> form<00:02:05.610> so<00:02:06.119> you<00:02:06.240> get<00:02:06.540> double

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
have the natural form so you get double

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.229 
have the natural form so you get double
the<00:02:07.259> benefit<00:02:07.770> with<00:02:07.950> the<00:02:08.310> krill<00:02:08.580> versus<00:02:08.970> a<00:02:09.000> fish
