I'll<00:02:17.100> come<00:02:17.310> up<00:02:17.430> to<00:02:17.459> the<00:02:17.640> filter<00:02:18.030> menu<00:02:18.060> I'll<00:02:18.600> go

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
I'll come up to the filter menu I'll go

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.720 
I'll come up to the filter menu I'll go
to<00:02:19.380> other<00:02:19.670> high<00:02:20.670> pass<00:02:20.940> and<00:02:22.190> what<00:02:23.190> I<00:02:23.220> want<00:02:23.489> to<00:02:23.579> do

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
to other high pass and what I want to do

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.240 
to other high pass and what I want to do
here<00:02:24.060> is<00:02:24.239> zoom<00:02:24.959> into<00:02:25.200> a<00:02:25.410> hundred<00:02:25.769> percent<00:02:25.950> of

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
here is zoom into a hundred percent of

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.420 
here is zoom into a hundred percent of
this<00:02:26.430> image<00:02:26.820> so<00:02:27.420> that<00:02:27.540> I<00:02:27.570> can<00:02:27.780> really<00:02:28.019> see<00:02:28.560> the

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
this image so that I can really see the

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.910 
this image so that I can really see the
detail<00:02:29.910> of<00:02:29.940> the<00:02:30.180> skin<00:02:30.480> I'm<00:02:30.690> pulling<00:02:31.620> the

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
detail of the skin I'm pulling the

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.490 
detail of the skin I'm pulling the
radius<00:02:32.280> up<00:02:32.430> to<00:02:32.700> where<00:02:32.879> I<00:02:32.910> can<00:02:33.269> see<00:02:33.690> the<00:02:34.170> filter

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
radius up to where I can see the filter

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.020 
radius up to where I can see the filter
start<00:02:35.250> to<00:02:35.430> effect

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
start to effect

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.390 
start to effect
the<00:02:36.150> skin<00:02:36.450> detail<00:02:36.840> so<00:02:37.500> for<00:02:37.740> this<00:02:37.860> one<00:02:38.130> let's

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
the skin detail so for this one let's

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:46.790 
the skin detail so for this one let's
just<00:02:39.060> go<00:02:39.420> with<00:02:40.070> 15<00:02:45.110> and<00:02:46.110> if<00:02:46.230> I<00:02:46.320> go<00:02:46.440> ahead<00:02:46.470> and

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
just go with 15 and if I go ahead and

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.200 
just go with 15 and if I go ahead and
drag<00:02:47.010> over<00:02:47.040> here<00:02:47.460> you<00:02:47.580> can<00:02:47.730> see<00:02:47.880> that<00:02:48.060> this

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:48.210 
drag over here you can see that this

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.240 
drag over here you can see that this
layer<00:02:48.600> actually<00:02:49.260> has<00:02:49.440> some<00:02:49.680> really<00:02:50.010> funky

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
layer actually has some really funky

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.730 
layer actually has some really funky
color<00:02:50.640> going<00:02:51.480> on<00:02:51.630> we<00:02:52.020> don't<00:02:52.050> want<00:02:52.380> that<00:02:52.530> to

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:52.740 
color going on we don't want that to

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:55.040 
color going on we don't want that to
affect<00:02:52.830> the<00:02:53.190> image<00:02:53.490> this<00:02:53.850> layer<00:02:54.240> is<00:02:54.480> literally

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
affect the image this layer is literally

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:56.990 
affect the image this layer is literally
just<00:02:55.290> to<00:02:55.500> isolate<00:02:56.010> and<00:02:56.190> protect<00:02:56.370> the<00:02:56.760> skin

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
just to isolate and protect the skin

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.180 
just to isolate and protect the skin
texture<00:02:57.360> so<00:02:58.050> what<00:02:58.260> I'm<00:02:58.380> gonna<00:02:58.530> do<00:02:58.860> in<00:02:59.040> this

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
texture so what I'm gonna do in this

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.030 
texture so what I'm gonna do in this
case<00:02:59.430> is<00:02:59.730> I'm<00:03:00.540> going<00:03:00.810> to<00:03:00.900> select<00:03:01.440> this<00:03:01.740> layer

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
from normal to soft light so now I've

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.810 
from normal to soft light so now I've
created<00:03:39.780> the<00:03:40.320> skin<00:03:40.560> detail<00:03:40.920> layer<00:03:41.130> and<00:03:41.340> what<00:03:41.790> I

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:41.820 
created the skin detail layer and what I

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.520 
created the skin detail layer and what I
want<00:03:42.030> to<00:03:42.120> do<00:03:42.239> is<00:03:42.420> create<00:03:42.690> a<00:03:42.750> skin<00:03:43.019> blur<00:03:43.290> layer

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
want to do is create a skin blur layer

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.680 
want to do is create a skin blur layer
that<00:03:43.739> goes<00:03:43.950> along<00:03:44.130> with<00:03:44.280> the<00:03:44.880> skin<00:03:45.120> detail

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
that goes along with the skin detail

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.690 
that goes along with the skin detail
layer<00:03:45.930> so<00:03:46.500> I'm<00:03:46.590> gonna<00:03:46.739> drag<00:03:47.040> the<00:03:47.280> background

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
layer so I'm gonna drag the background

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.610 
layer so I'm gonna drag the background
layer<00:03:47.850> to<00:03:48.150> the<00:03:48.269> new<00:03:48.420> layer<00:03:48.600> icon<00:03:48.810> once<00:03:49.320> again

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
layer to the new layer icon once again

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.740 
layer to the new layer icon once again
to<00:03:49.890> create<00:03:50.010> a<00:03:50.310> layer<00:03:50.700> called<00:03:50.970> background<00:03:51.090> copy

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
to create a layer called background copy

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.720 
to create a layer called background copy
and<00:03:52.080> I'm<00:03:52.500> going<00:03:52.739> to<00:03:52.860> double<00:03:53.130> click<00:03:53.160> that<00:03:53.310> again

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
and I'm going to double click that again

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.600 
and I'm going to double click that again
and<00:03:53.910> call<00:03:54.360> that<00:03:54.600> skin<00:03:55.200> blur<00:03:55.620> instead<00:03:56.250> of<00:03:56.370> skin

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:56.610 
and call that skin blur instead of skin

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:02.540 
and call that skin blur instead of skin
detail<00:04:00.500> now<00:04:01.500> I<00:04:01.530> want<00:04:01.800> to<00:04:01.830> make<00:04:01.950> sure<00:04:02.160> that<00:04:02.340> any

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:02.550 
detail now I want to make sure that any

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:04.370 
detail now I want to make sure that any
blurring<00:04:03.090> that<00:04:03.120> we<00:04:03.330> do<00:04:03.570> on<00:04:03.750> this<00:04:03.900> layer<00:04:04.110> is

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
blurring that we do on this layer is

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:06.650 
blurring that we do on this layer is
always<00:04:04.920> editable<00:04:05.760> and<00:04:05.940> that<00:04:06.209> I'm<00:04:06.330> blurring

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
always editable and that I'm blurring

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:08.449 
always editable and that I'm blurring
this<00:04:06.810> layer<00:04:07.019> non-destructively<00:04:07.950> so<00:04:08.250> I'm

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
this layer non-destructively so I'm

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:09.949 
this layer non-destructively so I'm
gonna<00:04:08.580> turn<00:04:08.880> this<00:04:09.090> layer<00:04:09.269> into<00:04:09.510> a<00:04:09.600> smart

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
gonna turn this layer into a smart

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:11.840 
gonna turn this layer into a smart
object<00:04:10.140> and<00:04:10.650> the<00:04:10.890> way<00:04:11.010> you<00:04:11.070> can<00:04:11.370> do<00:04:11.489> that<00:04:11.640> is<00:04:11.820> to

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:11.850 
object and the way you can do that is to

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:14.390 
object and the way you can do that is to

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:35.570 
see the skin detail layer is resting

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:37.420 
see the skin detail layer is resting
above<00:05:35.750> the<00:05:36.140> skin<00:05:36.380> blur<00:05:36.590> layer<00:05:36.830> and<00:05:37.070> this<00:05:37.250> is

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:37.430 
above the skin blur layer and this is

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:39.400 
above the skin blur layer and this is
very<00:05:37.700> important<00:05:38.240> because<00:05:38.450> if<00:05:38.900> the<00:05:39.080> skin

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:39.410 
very important because if the skin

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:42.160 
very important because if the skin
detail<00:05:39.800> layer<00:05:40.010> were<00:05:40.250> resting<00:05:41.120> below<00:05:41.390> the<00:05:41.660> skin

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:42.170 
detail layer were resting below the skin

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:44.440 
detail layer were resting below the skin
blur<00:05:42.470> layer<00:05:42.680> you<00:05:43.250> wouldn't<00:05:43.610> see<00:05:43.880> the<00:05:44.030> detail

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:44.450 
blur layer you wouldn't see the detail

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:46.930 
blur layer you wouldn't see the detail
now<00:05:44.870> I<00:05:45.260> think<00:05:45.650> that<00:05:46.070> the<00:05:46.310> blur<00:05:46.490> is<00:05:46.550> a<00:05:46.670> little

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:46.940 
now I think that the blur is a little

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:49.630 
now I think that the blur is a little
heavy<00:05:47.180> here<00:05:47.600> so<00:05:48.140> what<00:05:48.350> I'm<00:05:48.470> going<00:05:49.100> to<00:05:49.130> do<00:05:49.430> with

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:49.640 
heavy here so what I'm going to do with

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:52.000 
heavy here so what I'm going to do with
the<00:05:49.790> skin<00:05:50.180> blur<00:05:50.570> layer<00:05:50.870> is<00:05:51.170> decrease<00:05:51.980> the

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:52.010 
the skin blur layer is decrease the

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:55.990 
the skin blur layer is decrease the
opacity<00:05:52.280> to<00:05:52.850> 70%<00:05:54.250> now<00:05:55.250> I'm<00:05:55.430> getting<00:05:55.700> a<00:05:55.760> nice

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:56.000 
opacity to 70% now I'm getting a nice

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.960 
opacity to 70% now I'm getting a nice
play<00:05:56.360> between<00:05:56.630> the<00:05:57.290> skin<00:05:57.710> blur<00:05:58.190> and<00:05:58.430> the<00:05:58.730> skin

00:05:58.960 --> 00:05:58.970 
play between the skin blur and the skin

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:02.320 
play between the skin blur and the skin
