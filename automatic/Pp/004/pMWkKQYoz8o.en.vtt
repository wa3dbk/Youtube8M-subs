those films have been pointed all they

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.300 
those films have been pointed all they
wanted<00:01:52.229> to<00:01:52.290> know<00:01:52.470> is<00:01:52.590> what<00:01:52.740> we<00:01:52.860> wanted<00:01:53.189> from

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
wanted to know is what we wanted from

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.340 
wanted to know is what we wanted from
future<00:01:53.759> versions<00:01:54.329> which<00:01:54.540> seems<00:01:55.079> kind<00:01:55.290> of

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
future versions which seems kind of

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.170 
future versions which seems kind of
awkward<00:01:55.770> but<00:01:55.950> still<00:01:56.610> it<00:01:56.729> does<00:01:56.939> seem<00:01:57.149> that

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
awkward but still it does seem that

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.149 
awkward but still it does seem that
microsoft<00:01:57.869> ended<00:01:58.229> up<00:01:58.320> just<00:01:58.469> pushing<00:01:58.920> back

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
microsoft ended up just pushing back

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.429 
microsoft ended up just pushing back
because<00:01:59.759> well<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.570> feedback<00:02:00.960> was<00:02:01.140> too

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
because well the feedback was too

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.039 
because well the feedback was too
negative<00:02:01.860> to<00:02:02.009> bear<00:02:02.250> and<00:02:02.790> finally<00:02:03.750> with<00:02:03.930> the

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
negative to bear and finally with the

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.990 
negative to bear and finally with the
iphone<00:02:04.409> 5s<00:02:04.860> launch<00:02:05.130> a<00:02:05.340> couple<00:02:05.579> of<00:02:05.670> things<00:02:05.850> were

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
iphone 5s launch a couple of things were

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
carrier unlock variants are going to

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.540 
carrier unlock variants are going to
have<00:02:09.420> to<00:02:09.599> wait<00:02:09.950> sadly

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
have to wait sadly

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.070

nightmare now the biggest problem with
this<00:02:28.140> verizon<00:02:28.560> and<00:02:28.950> sprint<00:02:28.980> variant<00:02:29.820> is<00:02:30.000> that

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
this verizon and sprint variant is that

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:33.560 
this verizon and sprint variant is that
it<00:02:30.330> won't<00:02:30.540> be<00:02:30.720> able<00:02:30.870> to<00:02:31.110> do<00:02:31.320> 3g<00:02:32.010> calls<00:02:32.370> and<00:02:32.790> 4G

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
it won't be able to do 3g calls and 4G

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:36.380 
it won't be able to do 3g calls and 4G
LTE<00:02:33.890> simultaneously<00:02:34.890> for<00:02:35.130> data<00:02:35.370> which<00:02:36.120> makes

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
LTE simultaneously for data which makes

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.360 
LTE simultaneously for data which makes
you<00:02:36.570> wonder<00:02:36.870> if<00:02:37.080> Apple<00:02:37.410> really<00:02:37.680> understands

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
you wonder if Apple really understands

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.060 
you wonder if Apple really understands
the<00:02:38.430> whole<00:02:38.640> reason<00:02:38.970> why<00:02:39.450> 4G<00:02:39.990> LTE<00:02:40.110> came<00:02:40.620> to<00:02:40.800> be

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
the whole reason why 4G LTE came to be

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:42.860 
the whole reason why 4G LTE came to be
so<00:02:41.700> this<00:02:41.850> leads<00:02:42.030> me<00:02:42.150> to<00:02:42.330> the<00:02:42.420> question<00:02:42.510> of<00:02:42.750> the

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
so this leads me to the question of the

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.140 
so this leads me to the question of the
day<00:02:42.900> do<00:02:43.650> you<00:02:43.800> use<00:02:44.010> data<00:02:44.370> and<00:02:44.640> call

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
day do you use data and call

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.840 
day do you use data and call
simultaneously<00:02:45.990> because<00:02:46.350> I<00:02:46.500> do<00:02:46.710> a<00:02:46.860> lot<00:02:47.160> huh

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850
