00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
even know they were there but that's

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:20.900 
even know they were there but that's
beside<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:19.860> point<00:01:19.980> I<00:01:20.340> still<00:01:20.610> like<00:01:20.730> the<00:01:20.760> way

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:20.910 
beside the point I still like the way

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:26.150 
beside the point I still like the way
they<00:01:21.000> look<00:01:21.030> and<00:01:21.500> I<00:01:23.480> got<00:01:24.480> both<00:01:24.930> versions<00:01:25.200> I<00:01:25.620> got

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:26.160 
they look and I got both versions I got

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:30.520 
they look and I got both versions I got
the<00:01:26.280> target<00:01:26.640> official<00:01:27.060> and<00:01:28.400> the<00:01:29.400> general

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
the target official and the general

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.600 
the target official and the general
version<00:01:31.530> i<00:01:31.770> guess<00:01:31.920> you'd<00:01:32.040> call<00:01:32.130> it<00:01:32.250> when<00:01:32.490> you

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
version i guess you'd call it when you

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.800 
version i guess you'd call it when you
can<00:01:32.700> get<00:01:32.850> pretty<00:01:33.090> much<00:01:33.240> everywhere<00:01:34.070> and<00:01:35.810> as

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
can get pretty much everywhere and as

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.149 
can get pretty much everywhere and as
you<00:01:36.960> can<00:01:37.080> see<00:01:37.110> some<00:01:37.290> of<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.620> differences<00:01:37.890> this

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
you can see some of the differences this

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:43.340 
you can see some of the differences this
one<00:01:38.280> has<00:01:38.400> a<00:01:39.050> metallic<00:01:40.050> silver<00:01:41.450> window<00:01:42.450> this

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
driving in the movie it was kind of hang

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:55.880 
driving in the movie it was kind of hang
out<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.110> window<00:01:55.200> because<00:01:55.320> there's<00:01:55.590> no<00:01:55.710> way<00:01:55.830> to

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
out the window because there's no way to

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.289 
out the window because there's no way to
see<00:01:56.100> Elsa<00:01:56.370> out<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.420> windshield<00:01:59.150> they're<00:02:00.150> both

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
see Elsa out the windshield they're both

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.149 
see Elsa out the windshield they're both
the<00:02:00.420> same<00:02:00.450> type<00:02:00.810> of<00:02:00.840> plastic<00:02:01.140> this<00:02:01.950> one

the same type of plastic this one

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.950 
the same type of plastic this one
