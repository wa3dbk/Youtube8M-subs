00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
clammy as it is and I felt like when I

clammy as it is and I felt like when I
wear<00:02:27.860> gloves<00:02:28.070> they<00:02:28.280> slip<00:02:28.550> around<00:02:28.790> a<00:02:28.970> lot<00:02:29.120> I<00:02:29.620> was

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
wear gloves they slip around a lot I was

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.650 
wear gloves they slip around a lot I was
gymnast<00:02:31.160> before<00:02:31.520> so<00:02:31.730> I'm<00:02:31.820> used<00:02:32.090> to<00:02:32.150> calluses

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
gymnast before so I'm used to calluses

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.240 
gymnast before so I'm used to calluses
on<00:02:32.780> my<00:02:32.810> hands<00:02:33.170> and<00:02:33.410> that's<00:02:33.650> why<00:02:33.920> a<00:02:33.950> lot<00:02:34.100> of

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
on my hands and that's why a lot of

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.930 
on my hands and that's why a lot of
girls<00:02:34.610> will<00:02:35.510> wear<00:02:35.780> them<00:02:35.990> to<00:02:36.620> prevent<00:02:37.250> calluses

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
girls will wear them to prevent calluses

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:39.340 
girls will wear them to prevent calluses
so<00:02:38.150> that<00:02:38.270> your<00:02:38.390> hand<00:02:38.630> stays<00:02:38.930> a<00:02:38.960> little<00:02:39.140> bit

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
so that your hand stays a little bit

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:42.580 
so that your hand stays a little bit
softer<00:02:39.770> but<00:02:40.010> I<00:02:40.900> personally<00:02:41.900> like<00:02:42.110> to<00:02:42.140> feel

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
softer but I personally like to feel

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.370 
softer but I personally like to feel
them<00:02:42.860> the<00:02:43.520> iron<00:02:43.700> I<00:02:44.090> feel<00:02:44.870> like<00:02:44.930> to<00:02:45.080> feel<00:02:45.350> the

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
them the iron I feel like to feel the

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.440 
them the iron I feel like to feel the
metal<00:02:45.860> on<00:02:45.950> my<00:02:46.100> hands<00:02:46.490> I<00:02:46.670> feel<00:02:47.060> like<00:02:47.150> you<00:02:47.270> get<00:02:47.390> a

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
metal on my hands I feel like you get a

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.920 
metal on my hands I feel like you get a
better<00:02:47.570> grip<00:02:47.870> so<00:02:48.730> other<00:02:49.730> people<00:02:49.850> will<00:02:50.510> differ

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
better grip so other people will differ

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.110 
better grip so other people will differ
on<00:02:51.080> that<00:02:51.230> and<00:02:51.650> feel<00:02:51.800> that<00:02:52.010> the<00:02:52.190> gloves<00:02:52.700> help

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
on that and feel that the gloves help

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.240 
on that and feel that the gloves help
them<00:02:53.420> get<00:02:53.720> a<00:02:53.780> better<00:02:53.990> grip<00:02:54.290> so<00:02:54.950> I<00:02:54.980> guess<00:02:55.100> it's

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
them get a better grip so I guess it's

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.350 
them get a better grip so I guess it's
personal<00:02:55.730> preference<00:02:55.910> I<00:02:57.910> would<00:02:58.910> like<00:02:59.030> to<00:02:59.090> know

maybe just one exercising week like
pull-ups<00:05:12.520> ok<00:05:13.520> for<00:05:13.729> taking<00:05:14.090> off<00:05:14.300> sighs<00:05:15.520> you<00:05:16.520> can

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:16.669 
pull-ups ok for taking off sighs you can

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:19.540 
pull-ups ok for taking off sighs you can
stop<00:05:16.879> training<00:05:17.690> your<00:05:18.020> back<00:05:18.340> for<00:05:19.340> a<00:05:19.370> little

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:19.550 
stop training your back for a little

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:22.480 
stop training your back for a little
while<00:05:19.819> you<00:05:20.689> could<00:05:20.870> do<00:05:21.159> much<00:05:22.159> higher

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:22.490 
while you could do much higher

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:25.839 
while you could do much higher
repetitions<00:05:23.240> and<00:05:23.419> really<00:05:23.719> lightweight<00:05:24.849> like

00:05:25.839 --> 00:05:25.849 
repetitions and really lightweight like

00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:31.740 
repetitions and really lightweight like
much<00:05:26.719> lighter<00:05:27.159> decrease<00:05:28.159> your<00:05:28.190> protein<00:05:30.039> but

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:31.750 
much lighter decrease your protein but

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:35.290 
much lighter decrease your protein but
yeah<00:05:32.750> I<00:05:32.779> mean<00:05:33.020> I<00:05:33.430> hate<00:05:34.430> to<00:05:34.490> say<00:05:34.729> stop<00:05:35.029> training

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:35.300 
yeah I mean I hate to say stop training

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:38.170 
yeah I mean I hate to say stop training
all<00:05:35.449> together<00:05:35.629> but<00:05:35.960> in<00:05:36.430> order<00:05:37.430> to<00:05:37.520> lose<00:05:37.940> the

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:38.180 
all together but in order to lose the

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:40.119 
all together but in order to lose the
muscle<00:05:38.539> that<00:05:39.229> may<00:05:39.440> be<00:05:39.500> what<00:05:39.680> you<00:05:39.770> have<00:05:39.919> to<00:05:40.009> do

00:05:40.119 --> 00:05:40.129 
muscle that may be what you have to do

00:05:40.129 --> 00:05:42.459 
muscle that may be what you have to do
for<00:05:40.279> a<00:05:40.370> duration<00:05:40.550> of<00:05:40.789> time<00:05:41.110> because<00:05:42.110> any<00:05:42.379> time

00:05:42.459 --> 00:05:42.469 
for a duration of time because any time

00:05:42.469 --> 00:05:45.610 
for a duration of time because any time
you<00:05:42.889> hit<00:05:43.219> the<00:05:43.430> muscle<00:05:43.789> it<00:05:44.029> will<00:05:44.360> help<00:05:44.750> kind<00:05:45.500> of

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:45.620 
you hit the muscle it will help kind of

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:48.879 
you hit the muscle it will help kind of
keep<00:05:45.800> it<00:05:45.979> in<00:05:46.389> if<00:05:47.389> you<00:05:48.020> keep<00:05:48.229> your<00:05:48.379> reps<00:05:48.589> higher

00:05:48.879 --> 00:05:48.889 
keep it in if you keep your reps higher

00:05:48.889 --> 00:05:51.189 
keep it in if you keep your reps higher
it<00:05:49.310> won't<00:05:49.789> necessarily<00:05:49.879> get<00:05:50.389> any<00:05:50.599> bigger<00:05:50.839> but

00:05:51.189 --> 00:05:51.199 
it won't necessarily get any bigger but

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:54.189 
it won't necessarily get any bigger but
the<00:05:51.379> size<00:05:51.860> may<00:05:52.250> stay<00:05:53.000> there<00:05:53.240> for<00:05:53.509> a<00:05:53.539> while<00:05:53.690> just

00:05:54.189 --> 00:05:54.199 
the size may stay there for a while just

00:05:54.199 --> 00:05:57.909 
the size may stay there for a while just
because<00:05:54.500> you've<00:05:54.710> got<00:05:55.009> so<00:05:55.069> much<00:05:56.349> time<00:05:57.349> that

away<00:06:02.800> but<00:06:03.800> decreasing<00:06:04.610> your<00:06:04.639> protein<00:06:05.120> that

away but decreasing your protein that

away but decreasing your protein that
you<00:06:05.389> take<00:06:05.569> on<00:06:05.719> a<00:06:05.750> regular<00:06:05.990> basis<00:06:06.500> and<00:06:07.539> then<00:06:08.539> you

00:06:09.279 --> 00:06:09.289 
you take on a regular basis and then you

00:06:09.289 --> 00:06:11.559 
you take on a regular basis and then you
know<00:06:09.349> taking<00:06:09.650> off<00:06:09.949> of<00:06:10.759> that<00:06:11.300> particular

00:06:11.559 --> 00:06:11.569 
know taking off of that particular

00:06:11.569 --> 00:06:13.119 
know taking off of that particular
muscle<00:06:12.050> group<00:06:12.319> than<00:06:12.469> just<00:06:12.620> working<00:06:12.800> other

muscle group than just working other
muscles<00:06:13.550> around<00:06:13.789> will<00:06:14.659> help<00:06:14.960> and<00:06:15.919> then<00:06:16.039> when

00:06:16.209 --> 00:06:16.219 
muscles around will help and then when

00:06:16.219 --> 00:06:17.740 
muscles around will help and then when
