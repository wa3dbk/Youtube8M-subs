00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.330 
we're announcing droid razr maxx a droid
razr<00:00:09.660> was<00:00:09.900> all<00:00:10.050> about<00:00:10.260> thin<00:00:10.679> design<00:00:10.920> and

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
razr was all about thin design and

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.249 
razr was all about thin design and
possibly<00:00:11.790> thin<00:00:12.059> design<00:00:12.179> so<00:00:12.809> let's<00:00:13.080> take<00:00:13.200> a

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
possibly thin design so let's take a

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.189 
possibly thin design so let's take a
look<00:00:13.469> here<00:00:13.679> we've<00:00:13.830> got<00:00:13.860> droid<00:00:14.219> razr<00:00:14.639> and

00:00:15.189 --> 00:00:15.199 
look here we've got droid razr and

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:18.740 
look here we've got droid razr and
possibly<00:00:16.199> thin<00:00:16.520> 7.1<00:00:17.520> millimeters<00:00:18.150> thin<00:00:18.420> so

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
possibly thin 7.1 millimeters thin so

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
keep that number in mind because as we

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.930 
keep that number in mind because as we
go<00:00:33.300> over<00:00:33.510> to<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:33.719> droid<00:00:33.930> razr<00:00:34.110> maxx<00:00:34.790> you<00:00:35.790> can

are the world's largest smartphone
battery<00:01:41.880> so<00:01:42.810> i<00:01:42.840> would<00:01:43.590> also<00:01:43.770> imagine<00:01:44.310> that's

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
battery so i would also imagine that's

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:45.920 
battery so i would also imagine that's
gonna<00:01:44.579> end<00:01:44.759> up<00:01:44.850> accommodating<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.509> longest

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
gonna end up accommodating the longest

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.810 
gonna end up accommodating the longest
battery<00:01:46.079> life<00:01:46.439> obviously<00:01:47.040> that's<00:01:47.220> a<00:01:47.310> given<00:01:47.610> so

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
battery life obviously that's a given so

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.020 
battery life obviously that's a given so
pretty<00:01:48.450> impressive<00:01:49.020> considering<00:01:49.909> you<00:01:50.909> know

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
pretty impressive considering you know

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.210 
pretty impressive considering you know
of<00:01:51.240> course<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:52.170> size<00:01:52.380> of<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:52.710> phone<00:01:52.920> when

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
of course the size of the phone when

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.310 
of course the size of the phone when
traditionally<00:01:53.939> could<00:01:54.810> put<00:01:54.930> it<00:01:55.020> next<00:01:55.110> to<00:01:55.229> the

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
traditionally could put it next to the

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.139 
traditionally could put it next to the
bionic<00:01:55.829> they're<00:01:56.009> almost<00:01:56.579> about<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:56.969> same

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
bionic they're almost about the same

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.600 
bionic they're almost about the same
thickness<00:01:57.329> right<00:01:57.780> there<00:01:58.320> is<00:01:58.469> ionic<00:01:58.979> yes<00:01:59.369> in

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
thickness right there is ionic yes in

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.060 
thickness right there is ionic yes in
terms<00:01:59.759> of<00:01:59.880> the<00:01:59.969> max<00:02:00.240> are<00:02:00.659> they<00:02:00.840> around<00:02:01.590> roughly

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
terms of the max are they around roughly

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.789 
terms of the max are they around roughly
the<00:02:02.340> same<00:02:02.520> thickness<00:02:02.820> I<00:02:03.240> know<00:02:03.570> I<00:02:04.200> I<00:02:04.290> can

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
the same thickness I know I I can

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.780 
the same thickness I know I I can
remember<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:05.189> dimensions<00:02:06.060> of<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:06.329> divine

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:06.790 
remember the dimensions of the divine

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.840 
remember the dimensions of the divine
but<00:02:07.090> uh<00:02:07.170> at<00:02:08.170> 8.9<00:02:08.890> this<00:02:09.220> is<00:02:09.369> significantly

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:09.850 
but uh at 8.9 this is significantly

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.420 
but uh at 8.9 this is significantly
thinner<00:02:10.090> than<00:02:10.330> so<00:02:11.020> it<00:02:11.140> is<00:02:11.290> yeah<00:02:11.650> well<00:02:12.100> I<00:02:12.250> can

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
thinner than so it is yeah well I can

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.240 
thinner than so it is yeah well I can
see<00:02:12.580> it<00:02:12.670> right<00:02:12.820> now<00:02:13.350> which<00:02:14.350> our<00:02:14.830> viewers

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
see it right now which our viewers

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.710 
see it right now which our viewers
cannot<00:02:15.640> but<00:02:15.970> it's<00:02:16.210> certainly<00:02:17.370> impressive<00:02:18.720> try

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
cannot but it's certainly impressive try

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.510 
cannot but it's certainly impressive try
to<00:02:19.780> do<00:02:19.930> a<00:02:19.960> hand<00:02:20.200> around<00:02:20.440> here<00:02:20.800> not<00:02:21.100> a<00:02:21.130> big<00:02:21.340> deal

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
to do a hand around here not a big deal

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.120 
to do a hand around here not a big deal
here<00:02:21.970> we<00:02:22.060> go<00:02:22.180> we<00:02:22.360> have<00:02:22.450> the<00:02:22.600> droid<00:02:23.440> bionic<00:02:23.710> so

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
here we go we have the droid bionic so

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:25.890 
here we go we have the droid bionic so
you<00:02:24.220> can<00:02:24.340> see<00:02:24.520> here<00:02:24.940> because<00:02:25.300> I<00:02:25.390> know<00:02:25.450> it's<00:02:25.750> not

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
you can see here because I know it's not

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.480 
you can see here because I know it's not
I<00:02:26.110> know<00:02:26.200> a<00:02:26.290> lot<00:02:26.440> of<00:02:26.470> people<00:02:26.620> are<00:02:26.980> going<00:02:27.160> to<00:02:27.340> say

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:27.490 
I know a lot of people are going to say

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:28.770 
I know a lot of people are going to say
you<00:02:27.550> know<00:02:27.640> they're<00:02:28.240> still<00:02:28.450> looking<00:02:28.540> at<00:02:28.720> the

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
you know they're still looking at the

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.570 
you know they're still looking at the
Bionic<00:02:29.200> because<00:02:29.500> of<00:02:29.650> the<00:02:29.770> removable<00:02:30.100> battery

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
Bionic because of the removable battery

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.150 
Bionic because of the removable battery
so<00:02:31.090> you<00:02:31.420> know<00:02:31.900> I<00:02:31.930> feel<00:02:32.170> like<00:02:32.290> that's<00:02:32.470> even

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
so you know I feel like that's even

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.100 
so you know I feel like that's even
though<00:02:33.670> the<00:02:33.760> feature<00:02:34.000> set<00:02:34.390> is<00:02:34.540> not<00:02:34.690> exactly

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
though the feature set is not exactly

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:37.050 
though the feature set is not exactly
the<00:02:35.320> same<00:02:35.560> the<00:02:35.860> marketing<00:02:36.520> certainly<00:02:36.910> isn't

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
the same the marketing certainly isn't

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.090 
the same the marketing certainly isn't
either<00:02:37.360> in<00:02:37.600> terms<00:02:37.750> of<00:02:37.960> what<00:02:38.200> you<00:02:38.650> know<00:02:38.770> each

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:39.100 
either in terms of what you know each

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.370 
either in terms of what you know each
phone<00:02:39.400> separately<00:02:39.910> represents<00:02:40.450> but<00:02:41.050> they're

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
phone separately represents but they're

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:42.720 
phone separately represents but they're
they're<00:02:41.650> pretty<00:02:41.860> close<00:02:42.040> it<00:02:42.370> looks<00:02:42.520> like

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
they're pretty close it looks like

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.390 
they're pretty close it looks like
they're<00:02:43.000> pretty<00:02:43.209> close<00:02:43.560> okay<00:02:44.560> thanks<00:02:45.130> again

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
they're pretty close okay thanks again

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.940 
they're pretty close okay thanks again
you<00:02:45.760> bet
