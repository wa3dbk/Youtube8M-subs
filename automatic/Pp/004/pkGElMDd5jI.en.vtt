hello<00:00:08.160> in<00:00:08.820> this<00:00:09.150> video<00:00:09.330> I'm<00:00:09.719> going<00:00:09.990> to<00:00:10.080> talk

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
hello in this video I'm going to talk

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.980 
hello in this video I'm going to talk
about<00:00:10.440> how<00:00:10.950> we<00:00:11.010> move<00:00:11.719> specifically<00:00:12.719> I'm<00:00:12.929> going

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
about how we move specifically I'm going

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.049 
about how we move specifically I'm going
to<00:00:13.349> try<00:00:13.559> and<00:00:13.679> explain<00:00:14.070> the<00:00:14.250> mechanism<00:00:14.790> by

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
to try and explain the mechanism by

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.000 
to try and explain the mechanism by
which<00:00:15.089> our<00:00:15.480> skeletal<00:00:15.929> muscles<00:00:16.260> contract<00:00:16.830> and

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
which our skeletal muscles contract and

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.570 
which our skeletal muscles contract and
relax<00:00:17.430> in<00:00:18.350> ask<00:00:19.350> legal<00:00:19.770> muscles<00:00:20.160> we<00:00:20.400> have

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
relax in ask legal muscles we have

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.720 
relax in ask legal muscles we have
bundles<00:00:21.119> of<00:00:21.240> strands<00:00:21.750> called<00:00:22.050> myofibrils

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:22.730 
bundles of strands called myofibrils

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.939 
bundles of strands called myofibrils
these<00:00:23.730> are<00:00:23.880> made<00:00:24.060> of<00:00:24.269> two<00:00:24.480> proteins<00:00:24.960> actin<00:00:25.769> and

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
these are made of two proteins actin and

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.910 
these are made of two proteins actin and
myosin<00:00:26.010> which<00:00:26.640> overlap<00:00:27.420> this<00:00:28.410> overlapping

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
myosin which overlap this overlapping

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.009 
myosin which overlap this overlapping
means<00:00:29.400> that<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:29.760> two<00:00:29.970> proteins<00:00:30.480> can<00:00:30.750> slide

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
means that the two proteins can slide

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.590 
means that the two proteins can slide
over<00:00:31.289> each<00:00:31.320> other<00:00:31.730> when<00:00:32.730> the<00:00:32.910> actin<00:00:33.270> slides

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
over each other when the actin slides

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.930 
over each other when the actin slides
together<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:34.440> myofibrils<00:00:34.860> get<00:00:35.309> shorter<00:00:35.760> and

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
together the myofibrils get shorter and

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.780 
together the myofibrils get shorter and
the<00:00:36.239> muscle<00:00:36.510> contracts<00:00:37.100> when<00:00:38.100> it<00:00:38.219> moves<00:00:38.430> apart

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
the muscle contracts when it moves apart

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.580 
the muscle contracts when it moves apart
again<00:00:38.969> the<00:00:39.420> marbles<00:00:39.989> return<00:00:40.350> to<00:00:40.469> their

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
again the marbles return to their

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.729 
again the marbles return to their
original<00:00:40.620> length<00:00:41.100> and<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.640> muscle<00:00:41.940> relaxants

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:42.739 
original length and the muscle relaxants

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:45.560 
original length and the muscle relaxants
so<00:00:43.739> how<00:00:44.010> does<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.309> body<00:00:44.489> control<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.149> sliding

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
so how does the body control the sliding

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.020 
so how does the body control the sliding
well<00:00:46.440> to<00:00:46.620> illustrate<00:00:47.100> this<00:00:47.280> let's<00:00:47.610> look<00:00:47.850> at

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
well to illustrate this let's look at

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.690 
well to illustrate this let's look at
one<00:00:48.239> filament<00:00:48.750> of<00:00:48.899> liason<00:00:49.440> we'll<00:00:50.219> also<00:00:50.399> need

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
one filament of liason we'll also need

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.170 
one filament of liason we'll also need
the<00:00:50.969> other<00:00:51.120> protein<00:00:51.690> actin<00:00:52.530> as<00:00:53.520> part<00:00:53.910> of<00:00:54.030> its

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
the other protein actin as part of its

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.840 
the other protein actin as part of its
structure<00:00:54.690> this<00:00:55.320> has<00:00:55.649> a<00:00:55.680> ribbon<00:00:56.129> spiraling

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
structure this has a ribbon spiraling

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.779 
structure this has a ribbon spiraling
around<00:00:57.149> it<00:00:57.329> called<00:00:57.750> tropomyosin<00:00:58.309> it<00:00:59.309> also<00:00:59.520> has

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
around it called tropomyosin it also has

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.959 
around it called tropomyosin it also has
some<00:00:59.969> receptors<00:01:00.449> on<00:01:00.600> it<00:01:00.750> called<00:01:01.079> troponin

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:01.969 
some receptors on it called troponin

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:04.520 
some receptors on it called troponin
this<00:01:02.969> leads<00:01:03.239> me<00:01:03.359> onto<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.780> next<00:01:03.960> ingredient

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
this leads me onto the next ingredient

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.469 
this leads me onto the next ingredient
which<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.250> chemist<00:01:05.580> allows<00:01:05.820> you<00:01:06.000> recognize

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
which the chemist allows you recognize

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.380 
which the chemist allows you recognize
as<00:01:06.720> a<00:01:06.780> calcium<00:01:07.229> ion<00:01:07.670> the<00:01:08.670> last<00:01:08.880> molecules

that<00:01:23.820> drives<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:24.270> mechanism<00:01:24.750> comes<00:01:25.049> from<00:01:25.670> so

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
that drives the mechanism comes from so

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.210 
that drives the mechanism comes from so
let's<00:01:26.850> look<00:01:27.150> at<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.450> actual<00:01:27.780> mechanism<00:01:28.380> when

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
let's look at the actual mechanism when

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.370 
let's look at the actual mechanism when
we<00:01:29.340> want<00:01:29.549> to<00:01:29.700> move<00:01:29.909> our<00:01:30.150> muscles<00:01:30.299> an<00:01:30.869> action

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
we want to move our muscles an action

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.950 
we want to move our muscles an action

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
potential or nerve impulse travels from

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.899 
potential or nerve impulse travels from
our<00:01:34.079> brain<00:01:34.350> to<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.680> muscles<00:01:34.820> where<00:01:35.820> it

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
our brain to the muscles where it

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.510 
our brain to the muscles where it
triggers<00:01:36.299> an<00:01:36.479> influx<00:01:36.869> of<00:01:37.140> calcium<00:01:37.350> ions<00:01:37.710> into

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
triggers an influx of calcium ions into

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.020 
triggers an influx of calcium ions into
the<00:01:38.670> myofibrils<00:01:39.860> these<00:01:40.860> ions<00:01:41.250> bind<00:01:41.670> to<00:01:41.939> the

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
the myofibrils these ions bind to the

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.870 
the myofibrils these ions bind to the
troponin<00:01:42.450> receptors<00:01:43.020> on<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.649> actin<00:01:44.070> this

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
troponin receptors on the actin this

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.870 
troponin receptors on the actin this
causes<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.420> actin<00:01:45.899> to<00:01:46.020> change<00:01:46.290> shape<00:01:46.880> the

powerstroke the ADP NP I then combine to

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.249 
powerstroke the ADP NP I then combine to
form<00:02:08.039> ATP<00:02:08.479> which<00:02:09.479> binds<00:02:09.780> to<00:02:09.929> the<00:02:10.020> myosin

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259

pulling it away from the actin

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.270 
pulling it away from the actin
finally<00:02:13.670> the<00:02:14.269> ATP<00:02:14.840> converts<00:02:15.230> back<00:02:15.530> into<00:02:15.860> ADP

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
next site and the process repeats itself

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.209 
next site and the process repeats itself
so<00:02:23.540> that's<00:02:23.629> basically<00:02:24.200> how<00:02:24.319> a<00:02:24.500> skeletal

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:25.219 
so that's basically how a skeletal

00:02:25.219 --> 00:02:26.949 
so that's basically how a skeletal
muscles<00:02:25.519> work<00:02:25.760> I<00:02:26.030> hope<00:02:26.659> this<00:02:26.780> has<00:02:26.930> been

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
muscles work I hope this has been

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:28.690 
muscles work I hope this has been
