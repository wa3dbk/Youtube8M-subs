here so let's take a quick look at the

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.660 
here so let's take a quick look at the

can<00:01:38.790> see<00:01:38.939> we<00:01:39.119> have<00:01:39.240> several<00:01:39.630> tiles<00:01:39.960> across<00:01:40.530> the

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
can see we have several tiles across the

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.830 
can see we have several tiles across the
this<00:01:41.159> is<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.310> home<00:01:41.460> screen<00:01:41.579> of<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.850> phone<00:01:41.909> so

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
this is the home screen of the phone so

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.139 
this is the home screen of the phone so

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.650 

now<00:02:43.140> you<00:02:43.200> can<00:02:43.320> see<00:02:43.470> the<00:02:43.650> color<00:02:43.980> scheme<00:02:44.310> is<00:02:44.660> very

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
now you can see the color scheme is very

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.110 
now you can see the color scheme is very
much<00:02:45.870> white<00:02:46.530> text<00:02:46.950> on<00:02:47.100> black<00:02:47.160> background<00:02:47.640> a

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
much white text on black background a

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.180 
much white text on black background a
couple<00:02:48.600> reasons<00:02:48.690> for<00:02:48.960> that<00:02:49.020> one<00:02:49.320> it's<00:02:49.560> it

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
couple reasons for that one it's it

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.280 
couple reasons for that one it's it
looks<00:02:50.370> nice<00:02:50.580> but<00:02:51.240> another<00:02:51.420> larger<00:02:51.900> reason<00:02:52.170> is

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
looks nice but another larger reason is

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.640 
looks nice but another larger reason is
that<00:02:52.320> on<00:02:52.590> AMOLED<00:02:53.040> and<00:02:53.310> OLED<00:02:53.760> screens<00:02:54.650> black

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
that on AMOLED and OLED screens black

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.320 
that on AMOLED and OLED screens black
doesn't<00:02:55.920> require<00:02:56.190> any<00:02:56.640> lighting<00:02:57.090> for<00:02:57.270> the

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
doesn't require any lighting for the

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:58.880 
doesn't require any lighting for the
pixel<00:02:57.690> so<00:02:57.870> it<00:02:57.990> actually<00:02:58.230> does<00:02:58.410> save<00:02:58.650> a<00:02:58.680> lot<00:02:58.860> of

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
pixel so it actually does save a lot of

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.240 
pixel so it actually does save a lot of
battery<00:02:59.220> if<00:02:59.400> you're<00:02:59.550> using<00:02:59.820> an<00:03:00.030> AMOLED<00:03:00.330> screen

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
battery if you're using an AMOLED screen

this<00:06:12.120> is<00:06:12.270> what<00:06:12.449> Microsoft<00:06:13.229> is<00:06:13.319> calling<00:06:13.620> a<00:06:13.680> long

00:06:13.909 --> 00:06:13.919 
this is what Microsoft is calling a long

00:06:13.919 --> 00:06:16.519 
this is what Microsoft is calling a long
press<00:06:14.279> and<00:06:14.550> it's<00:06:14.940> a<00:06:15.210> pretty<00:06:16.020> common<00:06:16.259> theme

00:06:16.519 --> 00:06:16.529 
press and it's a pretty common theme

00:06:16.529 --> 00:06:18.369

so anytime we need to enter settings
many<00:06:21.270> of<00:06:21.389> the<00:06:21.479> applications<00:06:21.599> don't<00:06:22.139> have<00:06:22.289> a

00:06:22.309 --> 00:06:22.319 
many of the applications don't have a

many of the applications don't have a
specific<00:06:22.560> Settings<00:06:23.210> button<00:06:24.210> so<00:06:24.900> instead

mostly we're getting a bit of an idea of

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:36.139 
mostly we're getting a bit of an idea of
how<00:06:34.529> the<00:06:34.589> interface<00:06:35.009> works<00:06:35.190> here<00:06:35.520> now<00:06:35.909> to<00:06:35.969> add

00:06:36.139 --> 00:06:36.149
