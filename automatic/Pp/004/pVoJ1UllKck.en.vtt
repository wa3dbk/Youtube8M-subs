00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 Hello everyone today, I wish you 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.450
 show how to change the rings to the suit 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.200
 the most important thing 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.200
 need to go to settings 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.469
 on the subway games and here we find the style 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.929
 sight 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.539
 you will likely default site 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.640
 put any classic static 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:26.150
 either classic dynamic without 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:29.759
 the difference and if you don't change then 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:33.330
 will not change if you will 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:36.530
 enter commands so the first team we have 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.530
 will crossfire 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:40.880
 she is in charge of this sight 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:51.570
 set 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:51.570
 and an example number 10 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:59.120
 sight you owe no one seems to me 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:01:02.460
 so the best option is debt 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:07.380
 I repent of the number 2 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:09.340
 if you absolutely want to remove who this is 0 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.429
 when you have 1. but 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.429
 here 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:17.990
 are visible 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:21.870
 strips then if you want to sight 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:25.180
 some term 16 need to be removed with simplicity 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:29.470
 and there is such a team 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:31.300
 l + r yes and imagine the number 0 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:37.750
 everything 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:39.760
 for sure. cleaned up if you want back 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:43.500
 write the same command 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.500
 and put the number 1 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:52.050
 here further if you want 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:54.950
 so that it is received 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:57.950
 then I need you to lead a team of courses 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.950
 fitness 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.140
 for example, put 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:04.950
 five 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:10.380
 see yes 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:13.720
 bold for optimal is 1 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:14.620
 if you want to remove the risks leave 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:19.020
 only point 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:22.280
 what will the team help you 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:28.550
 The question of course tsiferku 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:28.550
 thousands to remove risks 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:37.310
 and if small small width 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:39.240
 sight then we put what 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:42.050
 said that 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.050
 red specnaz 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.560
 But if you want to change the color 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:52.220
 sight 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:54.890
 then of course there are primitive 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.860
 red green yellow blue blue yes 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.660
 but 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.160
 maybe you don't like these colors and 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.700
 then on 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.700
 write 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:06.070
 rose 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.010
 will tell 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:13.670
 halva 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:17.030
 number 5 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:20.490
 so that he remembers your light 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:23.820
 I have just the same red 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:26.690
 to change color you need to go to 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.690
 Wikipedia 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:33.310
 there it is 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:39.730
 you have to write google and yandex like 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:39.730
 holy rgb find this list of colors 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:49.820
 so for example any let's 

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:49.820
 purple or something 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:55.440
 We only need these three 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:58.860
 column 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:04.920
 the first is responsible for red 2 for green 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:07.800
 3 for blue prescribe 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:09.140
 cover color 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.980
 red 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:13.260
 just the letter p 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:15.180

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:18.180
 p with us 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.180
 153 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:21.269
 now we write 

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:23.470
