00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:31.560
 which I pre-marinated as 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:34.649
 usually grapes are desirable 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.600
 green and seedless and for refueling i 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:40.890
 I will use mayonnaise sloboda 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:43.050

 walnuts crushed and 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:58.370

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.780

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:04.409
 vinegar with water in equal proportions 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:08.610
 add sugar and vegetable oil 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:10.950
 the recipe in front of you next I send in 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:14.880
 a cup of finely chopped onion and leave 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:17.670
 at least 30 40 minutes and beyond 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.790
 proceed to making the salad itself 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.509
 in the chicken I added some seasoning for 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.729
 Chicken 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.640
 so that the pieces themselves are more 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:30.479
 zesty and here is a deep small plate 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:34.619
 I'll add some mayonnaise and mix for 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:37.430
 to make the chicken layer easier 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.990
 lay on the plates form a bunch and 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:42.899
 farther on a flat dish we start 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:47.420
 shape our bunch of grapes on 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:52.369
 wider above and tapering towards the bottom 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.369
 the next layer is pickled onions 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.700
 science i lay eggs 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:10.489
 on top of a personal word I make a grid of 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.489
 mayonnaise and spread walnuts 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:22.230
 and on top of the walnuts last 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.230
 main cheese layer 

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:32.930
 again on top of the cheese make a grid and in this 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:36.230
 Mayonnaise is better to smooth 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:38.860
 evenly across the top to make it more comfortable 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:41.450
 to decorate our salad 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.480
 something like this is covered in all this and 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.959
 then I proceed to the formation 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.330
 bunches of grapes 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:50.239
 for this I will use halves 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:52.400
 or reward i'm just getting better by 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:55.450
 surface somewhere give 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.450
 additional volume 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:16.480
 something like this should happen 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:18.850
 and then proceed to the decoration will do 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.410
 leaves since i'm not big 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:23.170
 expert on each therefore i 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:25.510
 show in the frame how I make leaves 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:30.160
 I will not just say that I cut them 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:33.580
