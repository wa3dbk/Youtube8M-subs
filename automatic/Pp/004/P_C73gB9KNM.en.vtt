00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 
quality of the note for especially the

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.620 
quality of the note for especially the
build<00:03:22.120> quality<00:03:22.330> is<00:03:22.750> really<00:03:22.840> not<00:03:23.590> that<00:03:23.920> great

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
build quality is really not that great

the<00:03:25.630> fake<00:03:25.870> leather<00:03:26.140> is<00:03:26.440> just<00:03:26.770> it's<00:03:27.430> just<00:03:27.520> tacky

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
the fake leather is just it's just tacky

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.900 
the fake leather is just it's just tacky
I<00:03:28.210> like<00:03:29.020> the<00:03:29.230> chamfered<00:03:30.070> edges<00:03:30.190> on<00:03:30.430> the<00:03:30.520> note<00:03:30.670> 4

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:30.910 
I like the chamfered edges on the note 4

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:35.460 
I like the chamfered edges on the note 4
but<00:03:31.150> the<00:03:31.360> the<00:03:32.140> back<00:03:32.350> at<00:03:33.070> the<00:03:33.970> back<00:03:34.150> the<00:03:34.750> fake

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
but the the back at the back the fake

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:38.220 
but the the back at the back the fake
leather<00:03:35.770> is<00:03:36.190> still<00:03:37.000> tacky<00:03:37.300> so<00:03:37.870> I<00:03:37.900> guess

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
leather is still tacky so I guess

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.590 
leather is still tacky so I guess
something<00:03:38.800> just<00:03:39.160> needs<00:03:39.490> to<00:03:39.670> up<00:03:39.820> the<00:03:39.970> ante<00:03:40.330> and

something just needs to up the ante and

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:45.440 
something just needs to up the ante and
just<00:03:41.380> make<00:03:42.310> a<00:03:42.340> full<00:03:42.730> aluminium<00:03:43.630> phone<00:03:44.380> and

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:26.050 
at the back so the only thing that I
don't<00:05:25.010> like<00:05:25.220> is<00:05:25.430> the<00:05:25.460> protruding<00:05:26.030> camera

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:26.060 
don't like is the protruding camera

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:28.150 
don't like is the protruding camera
because<00:05:26.810> I'm<00:05:26.930> a<00:05:26.960> bit<00:05:27.170> worried<00:05:27.500> that<00:05:27.710> it<00:05:27.830> could

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:28.160 
because I'm a bit worried that it could

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:33.430 
because I'm a bit worried that it could
scratch<00:05:29.030> easily<00:05:30.220> but<00:05:31.220> i<00:05:31.970> would<00:05:32.690> highly<00:05:32.990> advise

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:33.440 
scratch easily but i would highly advise

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:38.530 
scratch easily but i would highly advise
you<00:05:33.920> invest<00:05:34.370> in<00:05:34.520> a<00:05:34.700> good<00:05:35.090> case<00:05:35.510> or<00:05:35.930> a<00:05:35.960> cover<00:05:37.540> to

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:38.540 
you invest in a good case or a cover to

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:41.770 
you invest in a good case or a cover to
protect<00:05:38.660> your<00:05:39.050> expensive<00:05:39.620> phone<00:05:40.480> but<00:05:41.480> this<00:05:41.630> is

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:41.780 
protect your expensive phone but this is

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:43.780 
protect your expensive phone but this is
very<00:05:41.810> better<00:05:42.170> than<00:05:42.320> the<00:05:42.380> note<00:05:42.560> 4<00:05:42.800> I<00:05:43.040> mean<00:05:43.310> in

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:43.790 
very better than the note 4 I mean in

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:46.030 
very better than the note 4 I mean in
terms<00:05:44.060> of<00:05:44.240> build<00:05:44.480> quality<00:05:44.570> I<00:05:45.080> love<00:05:45.530> the<00:05:45.650> note<00:05:45.800> 4

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:46.040 
terms of build quality I love the note 4

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:49.000 
terms of build quality I love the note 4
I<00:05:46.220> like<00:05:46.430> the<00:05:46.580> S<00:05:46.670> Pen<00:05:46.940> but<00:05:47.420> I<00:05:47.690> still<00:05:48.530> think<00:05:48.830> the

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:49.010 
I like the S Pen but I still think the

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:52.650 
I like the S Pen but I still think the
build<00:05:49.370> quality<00:05:49.580> of<00:05:49.910> Apple<00:05:50.180> is<00:05:50.270> much<00:05:50.450> better<00:05:51.340> so

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:52.660 
build quality of Apple is much better so

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:58.870 
build quality of Apple is much better so
for<00:05:53.660> me<00:05:53.810> Apple<00:05:54.410> wins<00:05:57.160> I'm<00:05:58.160> not<00:05:58.340> an<00:05:58.460> apple<00:05:58.670> fan

00:05:58.870 --> 00:05:58.880 
for me Apple wins I'm not an apple fan

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:01.060 
for me Apple wins I'm not an apple fan
because<00:05:59.150> I<00:05:59.360> do<00:05:59.420> have<00:05:59.720> a<00:05:59.750> samsung<00:06:00.320> tab<00:06:00.590> s<00:06:00.770> 10.5

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:01.070 
because I do have a samsung tab s 10.5

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:03.670 
because I do have a samsung tab s 10.5
so<00:06:01.880> I<00:06:02.180> do<00:06:02.330> like<00:06:02.570> Samsung<00:06:02.990> products<00:06:03.320> but<00:06:03.500> it's

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:03.680 
so I do like Samsung products but it's

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:05.530 
so I do like Samsung products but it's
just<00:06:03.890> that<00:06:04.040> I<00:06:04.070> feel<00:06:04.220> the<00:06:04.550> note<00:06:04.730> Full<00:06:05.030> Faith<00:06:05.270> let

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:05.540 
just that I feel the note Full Faith let

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:08.290 
just that I feel the note Full Faith let
that<00:06:05.690> the<00:06:05.780> back<00:06:05.960> is<00:06:06.140> with<00:06:06.320> techy<00:06:06.680> so<00:06:07.490> I<00:06:07.760> rather

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:08.300 
that the back is with techy so I rather

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:10.150 
that the back is with techy so I rather
prefer<00:06:08.480> phone<00:06:08.990> to<00:06:09.200> be<00:06:09.320> full<00:06:09.500> aluminum<00:06:09.920> build
