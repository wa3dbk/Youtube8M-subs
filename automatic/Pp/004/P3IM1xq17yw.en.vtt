00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:04.039 

okay<00:00:01.079> well<00:00:01.469> I<00:00:01.500> finally<00:00:02.100> got<00:00:02.310> my<00:00:03.049> thermoplastic

00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049 
okay well I finally got my thermoplastic

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:06.530 
okay well I finally got my thermoplastic
clear<00:00:04.290> ish<00:00:04.680> I<00:00:05.250> don't<00:00:05.879> know<00:00:06.029> if<00:00:06.240> this<00:00:06.420> is

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
clear ish I don't know if this is

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.330 
clear ish I don't know if this is
actually<00:00:06.720> as<00:00:07.020> clear<00:00:07.259> as<00:00:07.500> it<00:00:07.649> should<00:00:07.830> be<00:00:08.010> or

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
actually as clear as it should be or

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:09.980 
actually as clear as it should be or
what<00:00:08.370> because<00:00:09.150> it<00:00:09.389> doesn't<00:00:09.660> make<00:00:09.750> a<00:00:09.780> lot<00:00:09.929> of

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
what because it doesn't make a lot of

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.020 
what because it doesn't make a lot of
sense<00:00:10.200> but<00:00:10.500> it<00:00:10.650> does<00:00:10.679> feel<00:00:11.070> a<00:00:11.099> lot<00:00:11.519> like<00:00:11.759> some

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
sense but it does feel a lot like some

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.700 
sense but it does feel a lot like some
sort<00:00:12.210> of<00:00:12.269> wax<00:00:12.540> now<00:00:12.870> so<00:00:12.929> I'm<00:00:13.290> guessing<00:00:13.679> that

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
sort of wax now so I'm guessing that

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.820 
sort of wax now so I'm guessing that
that's<00:00:14.040> right<00:00:15.109> I'm<00:00:16.109> not<00:00:16.320> actually<00:00:16.529> sure<00:00:16.710> how

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
that's right I'm not actually sure how

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.330 
that's right I'm not actually sure how
much<00:00:17.100> to<00:00:17.279> use<00:00:17.460> because<00:00:17.730> it<00:00:17.940> just<00:00:18.150> says<00:00:18.330> a<00:00:18.570> DAB

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:19.340 
much to use because it just says a DAB

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.250 
much to use because it just says a DAB
yeah<00:00:20.340> it<00:00:20.609> is<00:00:20.760> a<00:00:20.789> really<00:00:21.240> explain<00:00:21.630> how<00:00:21.869> much<00:00:22.050> a

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
yeah it is a really explain how much a

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.050 
yeah it is a really explain how much a
DAB<00:00:22.800> is<00:00:23.539> any<00:00:24.539> how<00:00:24.779> you<00:00:25.350> pick<00:00:25.859> it<00:00:26.010> up<00:00:26.130> a<00:00:26.160> spoon<00:00:26.430> at

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
DAB is any how you pick it up a spoon at

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.359 
DAB is any how you pick it up a spoon at
which<00:00:27.240> point<00:00:27.539> it<00:00:27.660> is<00:00:27.810> pretty<00:00:28.230> damn<00:00:28.560> hot<00:00:28.830> so<00:00:29.250> be

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
which point it is pretty damn hot so be

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:36.290 
which point it is pretty damn hot so be
careful<00:00:29.400> and<00:00:30.920> you<00:00:31.920> then<00:00:32.960> um<00:00:34.700> drop<00:00:35.700> it<00:00:35.880> into<00:00:36.090> the

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
careful and you then um drop it into the

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.670 
careful and you then um drop it into the
cavity<00:00:36.480> of<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:36.989> Fang

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
cavity of the Fang

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.150 
cavity of the Fang
quickly<00:00:38.629> this<00:00:39.629> seems<00:00:39.960> like<00:00:40.110> an<00:00:40.320> awful<00:00:40.890> lot<00:00:40.920> of

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
quickly this seems like an awful lot of

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.410 
quickly this seems like an awful lot of
thermoplastic<00:00:42.059> um<00:00:43.520> next<00:00:44.520> thing<00:00:44.910> we<00:00:45.030> do<00:00:45.180> is

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
thermoplastic um next thing we do is

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.529 
thermoplastic um next thing we do is
make<00:00:45.450> a<00:00:45.840> wing<00:00:46.230> from<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.160> top<00:00:47.370> job<00:00:47.879> going<00:00:48.360> back

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
make a wing from the top job going back

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.450 
make a wing from the top job going back
towards<00:00:49.200> your<00:00:49.640> premolars<00:00:51.980> yeah<00:00:53.010> don't<00:00:53.399> know

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
towards your premolars yeah don't know

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.799 
towards your premolars yeah don't know
how<00:00:53.640> I<00:00:53.730> chose<00:00:53.910> to<00:00:54.059> do<00:00:54.149> that<00:00:54.180> without<00:00:54.510> actually

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
how I chose to do that without actually

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.150 
how I chose to do that without actually
putting<00:00:55.289> it<00:00:55.469> in<00:00:55.590> my<00:00:55.620> mouth

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
putting it in my mouth

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.250 
putting it in my mouth
no<00:00:57.289> okay<00:00:58.940> immediately<00:00:59.940> falsely<00:01:00.690> pushed<00:01:00.989> back

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
no okay immediately falsely pushed back

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.560 
no okay immediately falsely pushed back
straight<00:01:01.680> up<00:01:01.829> into<00:01:02.070> okay<00:01:02.430> notice<00:01:02.789> you<00:01:03.420> need

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
straight up into okay notice you need

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:15.230 
straight up into okay notice you need
the<00:01:03.690> mirror<00:01:03.870> for<00:01:04.019> this<00:01:04.199> ah<00:01:12.170> okay<00:01:13.200> wow<00:01:14.010> it<00:01:14.939> will

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
the mirror for this ah okay wow it will

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.870 
the mirror for this ah okay wow it will
really<00:01:15.810> hurt<00:01:16.200> your<00:01:16.860> finger<00:01:17.310> I<00:01:19.460> think<00:01:20.460> it

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
really hurt your finger I think it

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.270 
really hurt your finger I think it
didn't<00:01:21.180> do<00:01:21.330> that<00:01:21.450> quick<00:01:21.689> enough<00:01:21.720> damn<00:01:22.439> anyway

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
didn't do that quick enough damn anyway

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.460 
didn't do that quick enough damn anyway
if<00:01:23.549> that<00:01:23.610> if<00:01:24.000> that<00:01:24.240> happens<00:01:24.659> to<00:01:24.840> you<00:01:24.990> I<00:01:25.200> guess

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
if that if that happens to you I guess

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:26.929 
if that if that happens to you I guess
maybe<00:01:25.770> that's<00:01:26.009> because<00:01:26.220> I'm<00:01:26.460> talking<00:01:26.820> too

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
maybe that's because I'm talking too

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.330 
maybe that's because I'm talking too
much<00:01:26.970> you<00:01:27.479> can<00:01:28.020> just<00:01:28.049> dab<00:01:28.590> it<00:01:28.619> back<00:01:29.009> into<00:01:29.220> the

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
much you can just dab it back into the

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:39.070 
much you can just dab it back into the
bottom<00:01:29.610> order<00:01:30.320> and<00:01:31.320> Reno<00:01:31.860> your<00:01:32.130> thermoplastic

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:39.080 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.380 

it's<00:01:39.470> important<00:01:40.010> to<00:01:40.100> get<00:01:40.220> the<00:01:40.310> right<00:01:40.520> size<00:01:40.970> as

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
it's important to get the right size as

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:42.580 
it's important to get the right size as
well<00:01:41.540> they<00:01:41.720> were<00:01:41.840> trying<00:01:42.140> to<00:01:42.170> sell<00:01:42.409> me<00:01:42.560> a

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
well they were trying to sell me a

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.770 
well they were trying to sell me a
smaller<00:01:43.010> set<00:01:43.430> but<00:01:43.880> I'm<00:01:44.060> thinking<00:01:44.510> that<00:01:44.540> the

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
smaller set but I'm thinking that the

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.600 
smaller set but I'm thinking that the
smaller<00:01:45.229> set<00:01:45.590> would<00:01:45.890> have<00:01:46.010> been<00:01:46.220> even<00:01:46.580> worse

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
smaller set would have been even worse

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:52.440 
smaller set would have been even worse
because<00:01:47.390> I'm<00:01:47.659> having<00:01:47.930> some<00:01:48.110> time<00:01:48.290> issues<00:01:48.680> here

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.469 

yeah<00:01:53.590> so<00:01:54.590> not<00:01:55.070> two<00:01:55.400> people<00:01:55.550> who<00:01:55.820> sell<00:01:56.150> these

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
yeah so not two people who sell these

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:58.840 
yeah so not two people who sell these
things<00:01:57.009> don't<00:01:58.009> tell<00:01:58.340> people<00:01:58.490> they<00:01:58.729> have

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
things don't tell people they have

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.580 
things don't tell people they have
smaller<00:01:59.149> teeth<00:01:59.420> than<00:01:59.659> they<00:01:59.750> actually<00:01:59.869> have

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.889 

right<00:02:03.590> I<00:02:03.830> think<00:02:03.979> we're<00:02:04.310> okay<00:02:04.580> again

00:02:04.889 --> 00:02:04.899 
right I think we're okay again

he on the right side no that is the

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:20.449 
he on the right side no that is the
wrong<00:02:09.800> side<00:02:10.220> okay
