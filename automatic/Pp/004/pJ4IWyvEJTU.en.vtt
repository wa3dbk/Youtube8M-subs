a whole list of world's now and you're

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.900 
a whole list of world's now and you're
not<00:00:39.960> limited<00:00:40.170> to<00:00:40.410> five<00:00:40.680> you<00:00:40.980> have<00:00:41.129> an<00:00:41.460> entire

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
not limited to five you have an entire

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.049

list you can convert your old worlds to
the<00:00:45.180> new<00:00:45.450> save<00:00:46.050> format<00:00:46.590> that<00:00:46.739> he's<00:00:46.860> created

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.210

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.470 
the new save format that he's created
there's<00:00:48.210> apparently<00:00:48.420> better<00:00:48.780> I<00:00:49.050> hope<00:00:50.480> yeah

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
there's apparently better I hope yeah

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.760 
there's apparently better I hope yeah
that's<00:00:51.690> going<00:00:51.870> to<00:00:51.930> fix<00:00:52.320> a<00:00:52.440> lot<00:00:52.559> of<00:00:52.620> the

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
that's going to fix a lot of the

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.069 
that's going to fix a lot of the
problems<00:00:53.010> I<00:00:53.370> with<00:00:54.000> maybe<00:00:54.480> I<00:00:54.539> don't<00:00:54.960> know<00:00:55.020> if

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
problems I with maybe I don't know if

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.119 
problems I with maybe I don't know if
it's<00:00:55.170> going<00:00:55.260> to<00:00:55.350> fix<00:00:55.530> any<00:00:55.739> of<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:55.890> void

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
it's going to fix any of the void

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.139 
it's going to fix any of the void
problems<00:00:56.820> but<00:00:57.829> hopefully<00:00:58.829> maybe<00:00:59.760> that's<00:01:00.030> just

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
problems but hopefully maybe that's just

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.599 
problems but hopefully maybe that's just
in<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.420> bug<00:01:00.600> fixes<00:01:01.020> that<00:01:01.109> he's<00:01:01.230> done<00:01:01.609> but

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
in the bug fixes that he's done but

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.609 
in the bug fixes that he's done but
let's<00:01:03.120> get<00:01:03.300> in<00:01:03.420> started<00:01:04.019> it<00:01:04.110> with<00:01:04.140> a<00:01:04.229> new<00:01:04.409> world

the half step blocks that he's added in
addition<00:02:10.860> to<00:02:10.979> the<00:02:11.069> first<00:02:11.489> one<00:02:11.790> that<00:02:11.880> he<00:02:11.940> had

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
addition to the first one that he had

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.860 
addition to the first one that he had
which<00:02:12.569> was<00:02:12.950> the<00:02:13.950> original<00:02:14.040> stone<00:02:14.760> slab<00:02:15.180> he's

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870
