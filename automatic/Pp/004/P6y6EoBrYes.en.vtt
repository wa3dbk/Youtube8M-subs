00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:07.730
 hello everyone welcome 

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:10.400
 a new video 

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:12.880
 of my channel does not have to do anything with 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.880
 gameplay 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:19.640
 well let's see how to accelerate your 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:22.550
 performance processor 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.280
 a little bit further ok first thing 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.460
 we have to do 

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:28.870
 is 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:32.400
 and from here 

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:35.630
 we copy or open the page 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.630
 that I leave in the description 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.519
 okay 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:01:01.110
 we are going to need two programs one is 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:01:01.110
 call arms if we care and the other 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:08.270
 cpu and 11 is but eye or have 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:12.810
 watch out 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:18.570
 this is only for md 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:18.570
 that is to md to 450 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:39.670
 I have md 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:47.680
 450 hp with radio hd graphics 2 dual cpu 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:49.980
 with 1.6 and ghz ok 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:52.770
 we'll see 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:55.850
 how to accelerate it 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:58.780
 well first we unloaded the arm and 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:07.740
 it depends on you if you want 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:07.740
 they have windows 32 bits download 32 64 64 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.119
 once done that 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.080
 it comes to leave 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.320
 this is all files 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:26.830
 those 2 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:28.750
 it's good that we installed it and all this 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.180
 can be installed a little bit 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:36.550
 arm stewie care and good once 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:39.510
 installed we opened the cpu and 11 is 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:39.510
 We can do this 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:52.530
 remember this is only for processors 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:54.500
 amd of 450 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:57.450
 for the others it serves better 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:02.099
 practically you 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:03.410
 there encores pitt you will appear 1600 and 

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:05.630
 something 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:09.590
 there appears that speed because I already 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:13.420
 get when you open your arm 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.420
 lower the first now in the cpu z 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:21.260
 and about this 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:23.750
 with speed and it will lower me 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.790
 it's going to go down a lot 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:29.640
 is the normal speed of the computer 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:31.950
 let the processor begin 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:37.660
 but now we open the arm stewie care 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:40.549
 and where they say very like 33 divided 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:43.060
 is the temperature 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:49.770
 1867 good 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:54.959
 we call this to 1.001 and we're going to 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:54.959
 compare the 1.6 would be 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:03.130
 and good 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:07.240
 and the truth that someone serves others 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:08.740
 I hope that you and many others 

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:10.920
 I could play the session of the day there is no 

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:10.920
 OK 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:18.709
 I am going to play it before the children that play 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:20.260
 in classics 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:25.740
 low 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:25.740
 and now I can not play in high graphics 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:30.440
 or because with the contagion I will not be able to 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:30.440
 do what 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:39.470
 wait I will spend this occasion and 

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:39.470
 I show 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:45.110
 it becomes good we are here to extend 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:49.040
 of arrival 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:51.680
 or for the sample of what is 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:54.130
 good one thing 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.130
 and 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:05:01.600
 to zeta programming does not have to close 

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:01.600
 to the arms 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:11.860
 and good if you want to see here is everything 

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:11.860
 faster 

00:05:14.009 --> 00:05:16.879
 cried 

00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:23.199
 the cne is slow since flaps consume 

00:05:20.899 --> 00:05:23.199
 much 

00:05:26.249 --> 00:05:31.940
 but it gets worse 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:34.930
 exceeds graphic journalism of 200 

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:38.100
 and now we will test all graphics 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:40.760
 so wait 

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:40.760
 outside 

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:47.400
 two 

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:49.320
 it does not work very well since I'm 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:51.720
 recording 

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:53.609
 she says she goes three phrases from the nps 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:57.280
 minutes 

00:05:53.609 --> 00:06:00.660
 without going faster 

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:00.660
 so let's go 

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:04.600
 already 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:08.270
 in seconds 

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:15.610
 good once done that remember that 

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:17.529
 it does not have to close 

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:20.379
 yes 

00:06:17.529 --> 00:06:22.749
 I say one more time I will look silly 

00:06:20.379 --> 00:06:26.040
 but they will not do it color 

00:06:22.749 --> 00:06:30.520
 processor that is not 

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:32.630
 there are more than 450 because it can fail 

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:35.460
 but 

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:38.000
 so it will be then 

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:40.720
 and good 

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.720
 there it is 

00:06:42.129 --> 00:06:47.620
 the links that leave in the description 

00:06:45.139 --> 00:06:47.620
 Y 

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:56.570
 also warn that if they want 

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:56.570
 as you see, I have to see 

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:01.340
 it's a small detail but some of them 

00:06:59.409 --> 00:07:04.750
 like transfers 

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:07.330
 I have windows 7 home basic 

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:09.830
 the basic does not have to be transparent 

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:12.350
 this is in Mexico far behind 

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:15.160
 same as the toolbar 

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:15.160
 if you see me get off 

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:23.729
 if they want to know how I do it as 

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:25.600
 I did not change 

00:07:23.729 --> 00:07:27.930
 tell me 

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:32.330
 and I will tell you 

00:07:27.930 --> 00:07:32.330
 so good until the next friends
