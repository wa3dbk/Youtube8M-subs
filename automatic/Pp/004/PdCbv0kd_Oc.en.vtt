00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:17.870 
on my cheeks and to be honest at first I
didn't<00:01:17.009> think<00:01:17.100> I<00:01:17.250> was<00:01:17.340> going<00:01:17.460> to<00:01:17.520> like<00:01:17.670> it<00:01:17.820> on

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
didn't think I was going to like it on

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.880 
didn't think I was going to like it on
my<00:01:18.000> cheeks<00:01:18.240> but<00:01:18.540> I<00:01:18.750> blended<00:01:19.380> it<00:01:19.500> out<00:01:19.619> with<00:01:19.860> a

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
my cheeks but I blended it out with a

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.039 
my cheeks but I blended it out with a
stippling<00:01:20.310> brush<00:01:20.580> to<00:01:20.850> kind<00:01:21.000> of<00:01:21.119> make<00:01:21.869> it<00:01:21.900> a

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
stippling brush to kind of make it a

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.600 
stippling brush to kind of make it a
little<00:01:22.290> less<00:01:22.530> harsh<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:23.070> I<00:01:23.159> think<00:01:23.369> it<00:01:23.460> looks

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
little less harsh and I think it looks

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.370 
little less harsh and I think it looks
good<00:01:23.759> it's<00:01:24.000> just<00:01:24.060> a<00:01:24.240> nice<00:01:24.420> natural<00:01:24.659> color<00:01:25.080> I

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
good it's just a nice natural color I

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.050 
good it's just a nice natural color I
especially<00:01:25.860> like<00:01:26.280> it<00:01:26.430> for<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:26.640> lips<00:01:26.850> though

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
especially like it for the lips though

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.330

feel<00:04:55.510> like<00:04:55.870> if<00:04:56.080> you<00:04:56.340> you<00:04:57.340> know<00:04:57.490> had<00:04:57.790> the<00:04:58.180> extra

00:04:58.469 --> 00:04:58.479 
feel like if you you know had the extra

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:00.270 
feel like if you you know had the extra
time<00:04:58.660> to<00:04:58.720> just<00:04:59.020> pack<00:04:59.200> on<00:04:59.380> the<00:04:59.530> layers<00:04:59.740> of<00:05:00.100> these

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:00.280 
time to just pack on the layers of these

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:01.710 
time to just pack on the layers of these
eyeshadows<00:05:00.490> then<00:05:01.090> they<00:05:01.210> would<00:05:01.360> eventually

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:01.720 
eyeshadows then they would eventually

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.870 
eyeshadows then they would eventually
build<00:05:02.560> up<00:05:02.740> to<00:05:02.919> the<00:05:03.040> color<00:05:03.310> payoff<00:05:03.490> that<00:05:03.639> you

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:03.880 
build up to the color payoff that you

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:05.430 
build up to the color payoff that you
wanted<00:05:04.210> but<00:05:04.540> they<00:05:04.660> do<00:05:04.720> look<00:05:05.020> a<00:05:05.139> little<00:05:05.260> bit

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:05.440 
wanted but they do look a little bit

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.020 
wanted but they do look a little bit
better<00:05:05.530> in<00:05:05.770> my<00:05:05.889> opinion<00:05:06.040> over<00:05:06.610> the<00:05:06.729> makeup

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:07.030 
better in my opinion over the makeup

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:08.370 
better in my opinion over the makeup
base<00:05:07.150> that<00:05:07.360> I<00:05:07.419> was<00:05:07.540> just<00:05:07.660> talking<00:05:07.960> about<00:05:08.080> so

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:08.380 
base that I was just talking about so

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:10.290 
base that I was just talking about so
that's<00:05:08.860> always<00:05:09.040> an<00:05:09.220> option<00:05:09.310> it<00:05:09.820> gives<00:05:10.030> it<00:05:10.180> a

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:10.300 
that's always an option it gives it a

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:12.450 
that's always an option it gives it a
little<00:05:10.540> bit<00:05:10.750> more<00:05:10.900> of<00:05:11.020> a<00:05:11.110> vibrant<00:05:11.500> color<00:05:11.800> okay

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:12.460 
little bit more of a vibrant color okay

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:14.550 
little bit more of a vibrant color okay
this<00:05:12.639> is<00:05:12.850> what<00:05:13.060> I'm<00:05:13.210> most<00:05:13.450> excited<00:05:13.660> about<00:05:14.169> it

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:14.560 
this is what I'm most excited about it

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:17.010 
this is what I'm most excited about it
is<00:05:14.830> the<00:05:15.070> shimmer<00:05:15.400> 9<00:05:15.760> stack<00:05:16.150> and<00:05:16.450> what<00:05:16.630> it<00:05:16.720> is<00:05:16.840> is

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:17.020 
is the shimmer 9 stack and what it is is

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.110 
is the shimmer 9 stack and what it is is
just<00:05:17.050> nine<00:05:17.590> different<00:05:18.100> shimmer<00:05:18.370> eyeshadow

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:19.120 
just nine different shimmer eyeshadow

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.540 
just nine different shimmer eyeshadow
pigments<00:05:19.900> I<00:05:20.050> guess<00:05:20.620> apparently<00:05:20.800> you<00:05:21.250> can<00:05:21.400> use

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:21.550 
pigments I guess apparently you can use

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:23.130 
pigments I guess apparently you can use
them<00:05:21.729> for<00:05:21.760> more<00:05:22.120> than<00:05:22.180> just<00:05:22.570> eye<00:05:22.720> shadow<00:05:23.020> on

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:23.140 
them for more than just eye shadow on

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:26.159 
them for more than just eye shadow on
the<00:05:23.350> box<00:05:23.560> that<00:05:23.680> says<00:05:23.979> you<00:05:24.700> can<00:05:24.940> use<00:05:25.450> them<00:05:26.020> as<00:05:26.140> a

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:26.169 
the box that says you can use them as a

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:28.350 
the box that says you can use them as a
cream<00:05:26.530> shadow<00:05:26.830> if<00:05:27.310> you<00:05:27.520> used<00:05:27.700> a<00:05:27.820> damp<00:05:28.090> brush

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:28.360 
cream shadow if you used a damp brush

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:30.960 
cream shadow if you used a damp brush
which<00:05:28.840> is<00:05:29.110> true<00:05:29.530> like<00:05:29.860> I<00:05:30.100> used<00:05:30.430> a<00:05:30.520> damp<00:05:30.729> brush

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:30.970 
which is true like I used a damp brush

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:33.630 
which is true like I used a damp brush
this<00:05:31.300> morning<00:05:31.330> to<00:05:31.720> put<00:05:31.900> them<00:05:32.080> on<00:05:32.110> and<00:05:32.620> it<00:05:33.130> makes

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:33.640 
this morning to put them on and it makes

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:35.580 
this morning to put them on and it makes
them<00:05:33.880> a<00:05:33.910> lot<00:05:34.090> more<00:05:34.150> vibrant<00:05:34.510> since<00:05:35.320> you<00:05:35.410> can

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:35.590 
them a lot more vibrant since you can

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:38.670 
them a lot more vibrant since you can
use<00:05:35.620> them<00:05:35.890> as<00:05:36.100> a<00:05:36.130> blush<00:05:36.550> which<00:05:37.240> I<00:05:37.630> don't<00:05:38.470> know

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:38.680 
use them as a blush which I don't know

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:41.430 
use them as a blush which I don't know
about<00:05:38.770> that<00:05:39.120> because<00:05:40.120> they're<00:05:40.390> all<00:05:40.440> they're

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:41.440 
about that because they're all they're

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:43.260 
about that because they're all they're
all<00:05:41.620> like<00:05:41.919> there's<00:05:42.130> some<00:05:42.310> bronzy<00:05:42.669> colors<00:05:42.970> but

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:43.270 
all like there's some bronzy colors but

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:45.029 
all like there's some bronzy colors but
there's<00:05:43.419> greens<00:05:43.750> and<00:05:43.990> yellows<00:05:44.140> and<00:05:44.350> blues<00:05:44.650> I

00:05:45.029 --> 00:05:45.039 
there's greens and yellows and blues I

00:05:45.039 --> 00:05:46.740 
there's greens and yellows and blues I
don't<00:05:45.460> know<00:05:45.580> I<00:05:45.760> mean<00:05:45.940> do<00:05:46.090> what<00:05:46.210> you<00:05:46.330> want<00:05:46.539> but

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:46.750 
don't know I mean do what you want but

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:48.719 
don't know I mean do what you want but
I'm<00:05:47.050> probably<00:05:47.710> not<00:05:48.010> going<00:05:48.340> to<00:05:48.400> use<00:05:48.490> any<00:05:48.669> of

00:05:48.719 --> 00:05:48.729 
I'm probably not going to use any of

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:50.969 
I'm probably not going to use any of
these<00:05:48.940> for<00:05:49.150> blush<00:05:49.419> any<00:05:49.780> time<00:05:50.020> soon<00:05:50.260> it<00:05:50.800> says

00:05:50.969 --> 00:05:50.979 
these for blush any time soon it says

00:05:50.979 --> 00:05:53.340 
these for blush any time soon it says
you<00:05:51.100> can<00:05:51.250> also<00:05:51.400> use<00:05:51.700> them<00:05:51.910> as<00:05:51.940> an<00:05:52.300> eyeliner<00:05:52.750> or

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:53.350 
you can also use them as an eyeliner or

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:55.710 
you can also use them as an eyeliner or
a<00:05:53.530> lip<00:05:53.860> color<00:05:54.100> or<00:05:54.550> nail-polish<00:05:55.060> tinted

mascara or a bronzer on a day to day

00:05:57.729 --> 00:05:59.400 
mascara or a bronzer on a day to day
basis<00:05:58.090> I<00:05:58.210> would<00:05:58.330> probably<00:05:58.510> use<00:05:58.870> these<00:05:59.020> more<00:05:59.200> as

00:05:59.400 --> 00:05:59.410

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:11.270 
I'm pretty sure that's because they have

I'm pretty sure that's because they have
similar<00:07:12.020> ingredients<00:07:12.230> I'm<00:07:12.980> guessing<00:07:13.460> so<00:07:14.330> the

similar ingredients I'm guessing so the

similar ingredients I'm guessing so the
next<00:07:14.660> lip<00:07:14.900> color<00:07:15.290> we<00:07:15.500> have<00:07:15.710> is<00:07:15.950> Vava<00:07:16.490> voom<00:07:16.610> this
