00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.809
 which operating system will be 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:15.329
 Mobile internet devices are also a huge future market 

00:00:15.329 --> 00:00:19.730
 his philosophy of the car hire Hilde white Red it is the device that 

00:00:19.729 --> 00:00:22.789
 most likely billions of people who are not currently in bed 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:24.239
 get into the net 

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:27.899
 and that will be the way the internet is used for the user on 10 4 

00:00:27.899 --> 00:00:28.890
 millions 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.399
 Mobile devices and the Internet are merging 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:34.859

00:00:34.859 --> 00:00:38.859
 Internet company an interest in one is for example the search engine giant 

00:00:38.859 --> 00:00:43.619
 Google until 6 is the capital Google has is the use of mobile Internet 

00:00:43.619 --> 00:00:47.649
 to push forward Pablo Nolte Henrich actively 

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:51.690
 The good purpose is that we will attract more people to use mobile services 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.089
 However, not so many innovative mobile devices are being developed 

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:59.420
 it would be possible I think so far will orient 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.330
 that's why they have an open operating system for smartphones 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:03.000
 developed 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.950
 Word of honor that happens too - and is in principle any case available 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.450
 but Android will not be easy, we still others want the market with the 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.610
 mobile operating system is coming 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.370
 Apple has developed a mobile version of the Mac OS for its iPhone 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.490
 and also Microsoft tries to gain a foothold in the market 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.729
 and because of the slow pace they have recently announced their system 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:27.400
 want to examine further investments 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.990
 but also the blackberry system of Research in Motions plays a role 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.370
 and so the competitors share the market 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:38.760
 far behind is the only coach Spahn can be where it comes on 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.630
 1 comment 2 percent 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.430
 unspecified others come to six, taking care of 4 percent 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.180
 including Apple Seif and platform 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.720
 how Lynx comes to have a market share of currently seven Commander iPods 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.969
 Research in Motion is in third place with a 10 percent command 

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:58.790
 behind Microsoft with eleven you can get 9 percent 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.640
 but the lion's share is still Nokia's platform, the symbian system 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:08.120
 comes to 62 2 3 percent According to analysts, but that is already 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:09.179
 change soon 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.720
 so Appel Research calculates that the proportion of - in the next 

00:02:12.719 --> 00:02:15.179
 treble four years 

00:02:15.179 --> 00:02:17.069
 so much air for further developments
