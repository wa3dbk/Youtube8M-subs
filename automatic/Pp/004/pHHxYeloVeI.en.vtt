00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
perspective on that first of all we're

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.319 
perspective on that first of all we're
in<00:04:13.470> probably<00:04:13.799> the<00:04:13.859> worst<00:04:14.130> economic<00:04:14.400> situation

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:15.329 
in probably the worst economic situation

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:17.509 
in probably the worst economic situation
that<00:04:15.690> the<00:04:16.260> industry<00:04:16.440> has<00:04:16.590> ever<00:04:16.829> been<00:04:17.100> in<00:04:17.280> our

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
that the industry has ever been in our

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:19.610 
that the industry has ever been in our
sales<00:04:17.880> for<00:04:18.630> the<00:04:18.720> industry<00:04:19.169> for<00:04:19.350> the<00:04:19.380> first

sales for the industry for the first

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.379 
sales for the industry for the first
nine<00:04:19.829> months<00:04:20.070> is<00:04:20.370> down<00:04:20.549> nearly<00:04:20.760> 45-percent

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:21.389 
nine months is down nearly 45-percent

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:24.529

00:04:24.529 --> 00:04:24.539 
and the actual sales for October are the

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:26.990 
and the actual sales for October are the
lowest<00:04:24.810> for<00:04:25.200> the<00:04:25.260> industry<00:04:25.770> and<00:04:25.950> over<00:04:26.520> 25

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
lowest for the industry and over 25

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.629

years

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:27.639 
years

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:29.640

so<00:04:28.030> when<00:04:28.180> your<00:04:28.300> sales<00:04:28.569> fall<00:04:28.900> off<00:04:29.110> that<00:04:29.139> much

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.650 
so when your sales fall off that much

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:31.559 
so when your sales fall off that much
with<00:04:30.129> the<00:04:30.249> issue<00:04:30.430> that<00:04:30.669> we<00:04:30.819> have<00:04:31.060> is<00:04:31.389> this

00:04:31.559 --> 00:04:31.569 
with the issue that we have is this

00:04:31.569 --> 00:04:33.899 
with the issue that we have is this
crisis<00:04:32.169> in<00:04:32.379> the<00:04:32.499> economy<00:04:33.069> and<00:04:33.340> with<00:04:33.819> the
