00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 on rustica point fr we go 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.310
 learn how to lighten apples and 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:12.090
 pears for it to be even more 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:14.040
 tasty at harvest time why 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.480
 thinning on trees 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.730
 fruit trees including apples and 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.770
 pears simply to eliminate the 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.410
 fruits in excess they will be many 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.150
 tastier more sweet it will relieve 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.250
 also the branches that risk getting 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.500
 break under the weight of the fruits and then 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.699
 and then it will decrease the risk of 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.929
 diseases 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.640
 from what time can we 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.110
 to lighten our fruits in principle to 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.239
 less June just after the fall 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.100
 physiological fruit another point of 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.430
 landmark when fruits are big 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.260
 like a goose 2 cm in diameter for 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.520
 to clear up a weapon made in 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.070
 two times first time you have 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.379
 already shaken your tree to eliminate 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.989
 all the fruits that are badly hooked 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:55.140
 after that we will start to observe are 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.719
 there are between 8 and 15 fruits on one 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.270
 carpenter branch by linear meter 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.250
 eight fruits for a young tree a tree 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.350
 who is already over 10 years old 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.750
 can keep a fruit breaks apple 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.640
 or if tonight we will practice two 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.110
 kinds of thinning a thinning 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.330
 for apples and peas 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.119
 on principle pears 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.340
 canned fruits by bouquets and we 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.590
 let's instead keep the fruits to 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.990
 outside and we can see it well 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.180
 biggest fruits the most 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.700
 important are on the outside of the 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.990
 bouquet so we eliminate the fruits a 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:33.420
 inside to leave some fruit 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:35.430
 also count between 30 and 40 sheets 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.829
 by bouquet ie when you 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.659
 have cleared your fruit tree your 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.210
 apples in power he has to stay between 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.340
 30 and 40 sheets and when I talk about 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.049
 30 to 40 leaves it can be also a 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.909
 young shoot that is on the side that is going 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.290
 allow to feed your tree if you 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.060
 cut too many leaves you risk 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.560
 to have burns regarding 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.290
 apples we will do the opposite we 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.570
 let's keep the fruits that are at 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.159
 inside and we will eliminate the fruits 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.290
 who are outside 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:04.020
 choose of course the fruits the 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:06.030
 sicker those who are attacked already 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.979
 by the codling moth we already have some at the beginning 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.950
 of season so its fruits you go 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:13.120
 start by removing them in order to 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.670
 have the healthiest fruits 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:19.269
 possible pear apples plums apricots 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:21.489
 peaches a good thinning prolongs the 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:24.420
 life of your fruit trees they are in 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:24.420
 better health
