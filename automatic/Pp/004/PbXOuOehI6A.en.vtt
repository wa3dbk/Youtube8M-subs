thing alive more than sonic and before

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.070 
thing alive more than sonic and before
refine<00:03:05.490> alright<00:03:06.180> awesome<00:03:06.330> so<00:03:06.810> let<00:03:07.050> us

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
refine alright awesome so let us

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.290 
refine alright awesome so let us
continue<00:03:07.350> on<00:03:07.650> in<00:03:07.890> move<00:03:08.520> away<00:03:08.700> and<00:03:09.090> hopefully

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
continue on in move away and hopefully

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.180 
continue on in move away and hopefully
she<00:03:09.959> won't<00:03:10.050> catch<00:03:10.230> up<00:03:10.350> to<00:03:10.440> the<00:03:10.530> system<00:03:10.860> because

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
she won't catch up to the system because

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.670 
she won't catch up to the system because
you<00:03:11.340> know<00:03:11.430> she's<00:03:11.670> very<00:03:11.880> pretty<00:03:12.030> fast<00:03:12.450> but<00:03:12.680> you

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
you know she's very pretty fast but you

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:14.990 
you know she's very pretty fast but you
really<00:03:13.830> don't<00:03:14.010> know<00:03:14.190> if<00:03:14.400> she'd<00:03:14.580> be<00:03:14.700> able<00:03:14.790> to

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
really don't know if she'd be able to

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.520 
really don't know if she'd be able to
catch<00:03:15.150> up<00:03:15.300> to<00:03:15.420> us<00:03:15.450> at<00:03:15.750> this<00:03:15.930> point<00:03:15.989> um

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
catch up to us at this point um

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.890 
catch up to us at this point um
basically<00:03:17.489> I<00:03:17.850> think<00:03:18.269> we're<00:03:18.390> gonna<00:03:18.540> win<00:03:18.750> this

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
basically I think we're gonna win this

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.080 
basically I think we're gonna win this
one<00:03:18.959> just<00:03:19.230> just<00:03:19.530> because<00:03:19.860> still<00:03:20.640> is<00:03:20.790> so<00:03:20.940> far

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
one just just because still is so far

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:22.370 
one just just because still is so far
behind<00:03:21.180> us<00:03:21.480> right<00:03:21.570> now<00:03:21.690> as<00:03:21.930> you<00:03:22.019> guys<00:03:22.170> see<00:03:22.290> at

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
there are little electric powers I think

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:28.850
