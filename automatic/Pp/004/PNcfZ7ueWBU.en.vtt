by means of its flexi fuel engine this
is<00:00:20.640> a<00:00:20.670> different<00:00:21.240> kind<00:00:21.390> of<00:00:21.570> hybrid<00:00:21.750> than<00:00:22.199> what

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
is a different kind of hybrid than what

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.340 
is a different kind of hybrid than what
we<00:00:22.619> normally<00:00:22.650> used<00:00:23.430> to<00:00:23.550> it<00:00:24.119> has<00:00:24.390> an<00:00:24.689> engine<00:00:25.109> but

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
we normally used to it has an engine but

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.140 
we normally used to it has an engine but
does<00:00:25.590> not<00:00:25.800> have<00:00:26.039> any<00:00:26.279> chat<00:00:26.640> between<00:00:26.880> the

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
does not have any chat between the

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.179 
does not have any chat between the
engine<00:00:27.269> and<00:00:27.570> wheels<00:00:27.660> so<00:00:28.410> actually<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:28.949> wheels

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
engine and wheels so actually the wheels

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.339 
engine and wheels so actually the wheels
are<00:00:29.369> driven<00:00:29.460> by<00:00:29.670> motors<00:00:30.150> in<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:30.750> wheels<00:00:31.170> of

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
are driven by motors in the wheels of

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.370 
are driven by motors in the wheels of
themselves<00:00:31.859> inside<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:32.759> tires<00:00:33.030> and<00:00:33.390> so<00:00:34.230> we

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
themselves inside the tires and so we

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.410 
themselves inside the tires and so we
have<00:00:34.559> four<00:00:34.860> motors<00:00:35.370> driving<00:00:35.940> four<00:00:36.149> wheels

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
have four motors driving four wheels

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.150 
have four motors driving four wheels
it's<00:00:36.870> a<00:00:37.079> it's<00:00:37.410> called<00:00:37.590> something<00:00:37.770> called<00:00:38.100> a

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
it's a it's called something called a

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.209 
it's a it's called something called a
series<00:00:38.579> hybrid<00:00:38.820> with<00:00:39.149> wheel<00:00:39.329> motors<00:00:40.040> this<00:00:41.040> is

a car of the future with many smart

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.369 
a car of the future with many smart
solutions<00:00:43.879> that<00:00:44.879> is<00:00:45.059> a<00:00:45.090> very<00:00:45.390> unique<00:00:45.989> and

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
solutions that is a very unique and

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.380 
solutions that is a very unique and
actually<00:00:46.770> a<00:00:46.800> big<00:00:47.010> improvement<00:00:47.399> in<00:00:47.730> car<00:00:47.969> design

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
actually a big improvement in car design

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.990 
actually a big improvement in car design
because<00:00:49.140> it<00:00:49.469> allows<00:00:49.770> us<00:00:50.039> to<00:00:50.219> have<00:00:50.430> a<00:00:50.760> lot<00:00:50.969> of

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
because it allows us to have a lot of

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.029 
because it allows us to have a lot of
flexibility<00:00:51.719> and<00:00:52.020> also<00:00:52.350> improvements<00:00:52.920> in

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
flexibility and also improvements in

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.040 
flexibility and also improvements in
terms<00:00:53.250> of<00:00:53.340> safety<00:00:53.640> because<00:00:54.570> now<00:00:54.780> we've<00:00:55.020> moved

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
terms of safety because now we've moved

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.709 
terms of safety because now we've moved
the<00:00:55.500> motors<00:00:56.070> to<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.399> wheels<00:00:56.640> we<00:00:57.270> get<00:00:57.510> much

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
the motors to the wheels we get much

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.750 
the motors to the wheels we get much
more<00:00:57.960> crash<00:00:58.530> protection<00:00:58.949> in<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.340> front<00:00:59.640> of

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
more crash protection in the front of

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.639 
more crash protection in the front of
the<00:00:59.820> car<00:01:00.059> that<00:01:00.629> will<00:01:00.840> wasn't<00:01:01.050> be<00:01:01.320> otherwise

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
the car that will wasn't be otherwise

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.100 
the car that will wasn't be otherwise
possible<00:01:02.239> he<00:01:03.239> also<00:01:03.420> has<00:01:03.719> a<00:01:03.750> lot<00:01:04.080> of

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
possible he also has a lot of

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.960 
possible he also has a lot of
interesting<00:01:04.680> things<00:01:04.710> like<00:01:05.189> allows<00:01:05.519> us<00:01:05.760> to

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
interesting things like allows us to

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.240 
interesting things like allows us to
independently<00:01:06.900> control<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.619> wheels<00:01:07.860> and

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
independently control the wheels and

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.490 
independently control the wheels and
also<00:01:08.939> I'll<00:01:09.180> get<00:01:09.360> much<00:01:09.570> better<00:01:09.810> efficiency

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
also I'll get much better efficiency

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.440 
also I'll get much better efficiency
because<00:01:10.830> we<00:01:11.010> eliminated<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.729> transmission

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
because we eliminated the transmission

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.750 
because we eliminated the transmission
that<00:01:12.990> takes<00:01:13.229> away<00:01:13.380> about<00:01:13.619> ten<00:01:13.830> percent<00:01:14.010> of<00:01:14.460> our

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
that takes away about ten percent of our

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.350 
that takes away about ten percent of our
energy<00:01:15.689> are<00:01:15.840> almost<00:01:16.140> cars<00:01:16.500> today<00:01:17.180> what<00:01:18.180> is

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
energy are almost cars today what is

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.149 
energy are almost cars today what is
unusual<00:01:18.570> about<00:01:18.960> this<00:01:19.259> car<00:01:19.530> is<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.890> fact<00:01:20.070> that

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
unusual about this car is the fact that

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.310 
unusual about this car is the fact that
it<00:01:20.280> is<00:01:20.400> driven<00:01:20.729> by<00:01:20.880> four<00:01:21.360> wheel<00:01:21.810> motors

it is driven by four wheel motors
directly<00:01:22.830> from<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.130> battery<00:01:23.490> and<00:01:23.640> it<00:01:24.390> is

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
directly from the battery and it is

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.450 
directly from the battery and it is
possible<00:01:25.020> to<00:01:25.080> drive<00:01:25.380> a<00:01:25.439> hundred<00:01:25.830> kilometers

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
possible to drive a hundred kilometers

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.850

without<00:01:26.670> recharging<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.630> battery<00:01:28.020> this

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
without recharging the battery this

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.679 
without recharging the battery this
means<00:01:29.159> that<00:01:29.310> eighty<00:01:29.640> percent<00:01:29.880> of<00:01:30.150> all<00:01:30.270> cars<00:01:30.600> in

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
means that eighty percent of all cars in

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.660 
means that eighty percent of all cars in
the<00:01:30.810> USA<00:01:31.290> could<00:01:31.799> be<00:01:31.920> driven<00:01:32.130> in<00:01:32.400> an

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
the USA could be driven in an
