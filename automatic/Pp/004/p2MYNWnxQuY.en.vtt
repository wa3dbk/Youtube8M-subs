00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:20.400
 review, we look at the router j2 500 this 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.470
 the device is intended for

 main characteristics of any router 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.360
 this is the power of rotational speed and 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.350
 torque power consumption 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.450
 measured in watts 

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:36.170
 and shows how much the medalist consumes 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:39.420
 electric power milling cutter jig 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:41.370
 535 watt rotational mill speed 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.850
 measured by the number of revolutions the prizes in 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.739
 a minute 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.800
 maximum rotation speed given 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.089
 cruisers 35,000 rpm 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.830
 torque shows strength with 

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:51.989
 which is the rotation of prizes 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:54.059
 the higher the torque the more 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.760
 it will take an externally effort to 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:59.190
 stop prize winner prize
