00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:04.839
 hello girls here comes a new video 

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:07.390
 in art this was my idea 

00:00:04.839 --> 00:00:09.760
 I made an orange single color with gods 

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:11.110
 very difficult doodles to reproduce them on 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.030
 an opposite hand 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:14.620
 tell me if they suck so much from 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:17.110
 hand on the opposite hand because you know 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:20.470
 I try, we try, I try now 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:21.910
 let's move to the tutorial as a current one 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.130
 yellow orange enamel acrylic colors 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:26.500
 neri the brush tip 0 and the sfotto 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.090
 obviously or before you do the reconstruction 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.699
 and then use yellow 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:30.970
 orange or before you put the 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:34.630
 top 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:35.860
 the base and then use the enamel in this 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:38.579
 in case you know I'm using the 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.870
 glazes lately so I use a 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.340
 reinforcing I use the nice tech that 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:42.940
 I think it's the best on the face 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:45.160
 of the earth 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.620
 so I use it on long teas 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:50.079
 effect that you dry after I take this 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:52.030
 color board that the 515 pupa of 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:53.530
 new collection I tell you if things of 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.370
 I don't usually do it but when I have it 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.680
 view 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:57.960
 the first three calories draw pink and 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.879
 I am really orange 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.860
 in love are a lot of spring and 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:04.570
 I really like them a lot 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.580
 plus with one hand in one 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:09.670
 beautiful covering however I see two for 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:11.680
 security shakes the color a little and then it 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:14.020
 laying monocolor choose you if 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.640
 put now I wanted to show or the 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.530
 hand in this way in the sense 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.290
 horizontal the finger is started 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.840
 obviously to put the polish you have to 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:25.780
 do not put too much because you can 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.790
 see very well two hands and me 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.710
 I recommend you try not to do the 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:31.630
 burgundy in the cuticle around the sides 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.979
 too jagged and cover one 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.750
 catch the tip 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:36.939
 otherwise another system that I find myself 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.290
 so much more convenient instead is putting 

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:40.960
 the hand in front of you a little like 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:42.460
 when the reconstruction is done e 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.869
 apply the color 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.310
 here I still try to put 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:46.600
 a little more polish to see if 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.880
 covered 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.710
 but with one hand, however, preferred 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.720
 same after giving two hands and me 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:55.150
 I recommend waiting a lot 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.920
 waited like 10 minutes then what do you do 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.659
 take an opacified buffer the 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.119
 surface where you have to do the decor 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:03.070
 take your tip brush 0 i 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:05.080
 acrylic colors 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:07.149
 take a saucer put the color 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.860
 acrylic on the saucer dilute it with 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:11.770
 the water but where it dilutes and much 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.660
 so much with water as you have to do 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:16.060
 of thin lines and the only way to 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.130
 make thin lines and spend anyway 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.739
 well the color is that acrylic color 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:23.050
 is very diluted and the surface matte 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:26.019
 allows you to make the more easily 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:28.209
 color is difficult this nail art I ve 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:30.610
 I say this because it is not easy for those who do not 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:32.590
 loves to draw for those who are not very good at 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.930
 I tried to draw them try it 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.430
 you too especially try something 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.049
 hand mail you are used to 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.390
 write because it really is an exercise 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:42.459
 very very difficult 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:45.280
 in addition, he gives you advice well placed 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:48.730
 keep your elbows on the table 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:51.549
 arms very close to you tightly 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.500
 very diluted color the brush must 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:56.019
 be vertical when you do line e 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.000
 all art and light that is you have to support 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:01.290
 excuse me a little peta 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.630
 then excuse some silk yes goodnight 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:06.250
 some bristles on the surface because 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:09.160
 will be the one that will help you do the 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:11.049
 decorum is very very very difficult 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.870
 the idea of ​​a moment you a little bit 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:15.579
 what do you think the color is and what is it? 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.310
 acrylics dry the area so you have to 

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:20.170
 wait slightly I did this by 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.120
 choir on the thumbs you see is 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.859
 on the ring finger you don't see why not 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.930
 he took the camera at that moment 

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:28.120
 the video camera I simply changed 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:30.430
 that on the ring finger it did it slightly 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.560
 the bigger it is at 3 after I do it 

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.359
 see as the last step after that 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.280
 dry really take everything 

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:38.829
 fixer to the top coat fix everything 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.989
 as you can see to embellish a little bit 

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:45.190
 these strips of dots that they would be 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:47.799
 4 3 2 1 is just right to embellish it again 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.730
 a little because you know that too little does not 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:50.260
 I like it 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:52.450
 I show you see that on the ring finger 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:55.060
 I made three I did a little more 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:57.780
 wide to see if I liked them more 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:59.640
 wide ends I tell you that 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.440
 maybe I should have made them wider on 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.730
 inch more children on the annual the 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.010
 contrary to what I did 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.270
 however, in itself it is pretty enough 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:08.670
 the nail art 

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:10.410
 I still hope you like it if you have 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:13.970
 questions do apples below the next 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:13.970
 video but hello
