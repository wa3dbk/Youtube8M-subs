the analog stick have been switched
which<00:00:26.470> we<00:00:26.589> find<00:00:26.769> to<00:00:26.829> be<00:00:26.859> a<00:00:26.919> little<00:00:27.009> bit<00:00:27.159> more

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:27.220 
which we find to be a little bit more

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:30.359 
which we find to be a little bit more
natural<00:00:27.730> for<00:00:27.849> some<00:00:27.909> people<00:00:28.169> so<00:00:29.169> gamers<00:00:30.130> have<00:00:30.249> a

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:30.369 
natural for some people so gamers have a

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:32.700 
natural for some people so gamers have a
choice<00:00:30.579> than<00:00:30.970> on<00:00:31.060> how<00:00:31.210> they<00:00:31.359> want<00:00:31.569> this<00:00:31.720> it

and one thing we really love is this
angle<00:01:03.660> or<00:01:03.750> triggered<00:01:04.140> but<00:01:04.290> together<00:01:04.470> you<00:01:04.739> can

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
angle or triggered but together you can

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.980

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
see how their angle cut this way to

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.780 
see how their angle cut this way to
match<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.350> contours<00:01:07.890> of<00:01:07.890> wearing<00:01:08.400> how<00:01:08.640> your
