00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:07.280
 hello very good I come to realize you a 

00:00:02.719 --> 00:00:08.929
 mathematical effect but initially not 

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:10.339
 I'm going to make the revelation because there 

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:11.959
 users who tell you to first do 

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:13.579
 the effect and then carry out the 

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:15.559
 revelation to make it easier to 

00:00:13.579 --> 00:00:16.789
 understand easier to perform good the 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:18.470
 truth is that it is not that it is 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:21.230
 truly necessary to do so 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.490
 but good this game is given the 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.279
 circumstance that has two variants 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:27.289
 so I 'll put them at the end of the video the 

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:31.249
 revelation and the variant that is a bit 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:32.210
 more commercial then I explain to you how 

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:34.430
 the game works well 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:37.030
 will initially show you up to your 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:40.100
 public a deck as you can check 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:42.020
 totally mixed you can if you 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.239
 you want to mix it or 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:47.629
 give it to someone to make a 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:50.329
 mixture does not carry any kind of 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:52.699
 initial preparation is mathematical but 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:55.050
 you will see on what the mathematics is based 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:57.719
 when I make the revelation well 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.270
 you will need 5 spectators to those who 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:03.149
 indicate that from any point of the 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:06.180
 shuffle take a card that is left 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:08.350
 the deck you can have mixed you or 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.259
 any spectator 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:15.930
 that does not have as I say any 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:19.440
 previous preparation so 12 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:22.270
 four and five spectators will take a 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:25.179
 letter very freely 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.950
 all this to make your port a 

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:29.590
 back so that you see it in no 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.200
 moment the letters that they take from where the 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.869
 they take vale 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.780
 tells them that the rest of the deck 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:39.479
 make three piles approximately 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.000
 equal not for nothing especially just for 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.860
 aesthetic is because we are not going to 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.810
 do anything concrete with them just 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.090
 return the letters that the 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.039
 public the three engines and return them 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.439
 to the public the letters from the heaps 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:54.390
 now what are we going to do then now as 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.159
 we do not really have an audience for 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.799
 analyze the effect we are going to observe the 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:01.710
 letters and to not forget more every 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.509
 viewer will look and remember your letter 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.920
 but to not forget them now 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:08.369
 same I'm going to do it 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:12.780
 write them down on a piece of paper on 3 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:17.579
 clubs on 10 of spades on 4 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:21.140
 hearts on 7 of clover and 8 of 

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:24.230
 hearts we leave it here annotated 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.550
 so that there is no doubt I leave a 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.540
 side that now is not going to do us 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:30.090
 lack well 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.159
 I leave in the cards face down because he 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.590
 we are not supposed to see that the 

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:36.840
 we would see when we turn around again 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.459
 half a turn and obviously would not see 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.859
 no values and tells the 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:43.319
 viewers that starting with the last 

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:45.510
 and ending with the first return the 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:47.909
 letters to any of the heaps but 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.159
 that the heap they choose to be all 

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:52.319
 the same so let's suppose as the 

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:53.609
 first to leave the cards is going to be the 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:56.040
 fifth spectator 

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:58.109
 suppose that supposes that the fifth 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.790
 You decide to return to a central heap you 

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:02.519
 does not touch the cards at any time 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.799
 fourth the third the second and the 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:08.159
 first they all have to go together and 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:09.900
 you explain whatever it is to have a 

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:12.950
 reason why are they going to go 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.950
 all together good 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:17.490
 and that any one of them who 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.890
 want me to recompose the complete deck 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:21.870
 so much you can put the pile of the 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.180
 left on top like a lot of 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.740
 the right as the two together as one 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.810
 below and exactly the same but 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:30.480
 let's suppose that one of them decides 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:32.460
 put this here and this here so 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.230
 we have five letters right now 

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:37.380
 chosen by a spectator in a deck 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:39.540
 mixed lost in the center good in 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:41.250
 one third of the deck approximately 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.110
 with which as we know more or less in 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:46.620
 what position is left to your 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:49.680
 spectators who cut and complete then 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:52.170
 like a couple of times so that you do not 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.720
 you know in what position the letters are 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:56.310
 even so still not knowing in what position 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.740
 is the letters you say you're going 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:02.340
 to proceed to do the same to cut and 

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:04.770
 complete the letters even mix them 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.569
 well no no because good half that but 

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:09.450
 in exactly the same way 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:12.060
 mixed a little more so they remain 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:15.269
 totally lost you tell them that they 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:17.609
 you are going to give a hand of poker but not of 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:19.199
 five letters of six plus one way 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:21.180
 a little extra, you're going to do what 

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:22.889
 next you will start by giving a letter 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:25.289
 to each of them starting from below 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:27.240
 if they saw your letter very mixed 

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:30.060
 as we have cut several times not 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:32.880
 we know in what position the five 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:35.039
 letters what is likely is that they are 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.650
 yes close together as we have 

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:39.960
 mixed American, they stay 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:43.310
 well you can throw the cards one two 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:47.100
 three four and five letters to each 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:50.880
 the first ones from below half a turn 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:55.920
 and the second ones from above half a turn and 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:58.710
 from below half a turn and half above 

00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:00.840
 back and down all of you leave mouth 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:03.120
 down although some are seen and the last 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:05.340
 hand also the body is done this the 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:07.140
 another was singing silver tarada each 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:09.780
 one of them has six letters to the 

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:11.580
 you indicate the first to the third and the 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:12.840
 fifth to do the following do it 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:14.640
 all three at once to make it more 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:17.340
 fast the realization video is more 

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:18.990
 slow for this I just tell you that from 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:21.990
 up receive two letters and pass them down 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:24.840
 two letters of the pass down two cards 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:28.560
 in the I went down the third the same two 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:32.210
 letters down two letters down two letters 

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:35.330
 below and the fifth two letters below 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:36.949
 two letters down two letters below and 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:40.069
 the second and the fourth a very thing 

00:05:36.949 --> 00:05:42.610
 similar but in this case three letters and 

00:05:40.069 --> 00:05:45.460
 three letters only twice 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:48.009
 it's a different way of mixing for 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:49.629
 each of them so that it remains as a 

00:05:48.009 --> 00:05:51.250
 little more bound the good letters 

00:05:49.629 --> 00:05:52.780
 remember we already have them written down for 

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:55.810
 I do not know very well why they write it and 

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:57.759
 after which letters were good method 

00:05:55.810 --> 00:06:01.030
 to perform the game since no 

00:05:57.759 --> 00:06:03.099
 remembering the when the practices then 

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:05.710
 the notes do not know what letters are like that 

00:06:03.099 --> 00:06:08.349
 that you get closer to reality 

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:10.060
 well then now in this case all and 

00:06:08.349 --> 00:06:13.599
 each of them five at a time 

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:15.159
 they would do the same thing you tell them they catch and 

00:06:13.599 --> 00:06:16.479
 come I'll have to do it just for one 

00:06:15.159 --> 00:06:18.580
 I have no choice but to have two 

00:06:16.479 --> 00:06:20.020
 hands that pick up in your heap in your hand 

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:22.300
 left in position of the area do what 

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:25.029
 next the letter from top to bottom 

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:27.219
 the next to the table the bank passes 

00:06:25.029 --> 00:06:29.289
 down the next to the table at the top 

00:06:27.219 --> 00:06:31.210
 passes down the next to the table to the river 

00:06:29.289 --> 00:06:33.460
 from below table up down 

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:35.319
 the one that fits you keep it the 

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:36.819
 hand this is actually an account is 

00:06:35.319 --> 00:06:39.279
 we all know how soft they bring 

00:06:36.819 --> 00:06:41.469
 direct and everyone will do it at the same time 

00:06:39.279 --> 00:06:44.569
 that I proceed with each and every one of 

00:06:41.469 --> 00:06:47.179
 them until final 

00:06:44.569 --> 00:06:49.639
 of the game and that everyone has one 

00:06:47.179 --> 00:06:52.639
 letter in the hand is supposed to each 

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:54.559
 of them he keeps a letter at hand 

00:06:52.639 --> 00:06:57.080
 obviously doing it can only 

00:06:54.559 --> 00:06:59.270
 lead to error because it makes one 

00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:01.759
 it is only important that the indications 

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:04.249
 are well given to your audience so that 

00:07:01.759 --> 00:07:05.509
 nobody alter the order because it is altered 

00:07:04.249 --> 00:07:08.559
 the order I already say is a game 

00:07:05.509 --> 00:07:11.619
 totally mathematical a game 

00:07:08.559 --> 00:07:14.089
 automatic any false movement 

00:07:11.619 --> 00:07:17.440
 obviously leads to error by 

00:07:14.089 --> 00:07:19.600
 complete and the failure of the effect 

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:21.250
 these letters are not worth anything and every 

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:23.350
 one of them will have a letter he wins 

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:25.470
 you ask them to name each of them 

00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:28.650
 the letter they had that they had chosen 

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:33.610
 we have them note the star shamrocks 

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:36.990
 10 of spades four hearts seven of 

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:40.020
 shamrocks and eight of hearts 

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:45.110
 total success without any doubt now by 

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:47.960
 Here I leave the revelation and the format 

00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:49.360
 and commercial that I have done because 

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:54.250
 it's totally different from reality 

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:54.250
 thank you very much and until the next video
