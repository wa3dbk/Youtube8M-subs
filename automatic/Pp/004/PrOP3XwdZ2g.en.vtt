00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:05.040
 the train train we want is first friday night in chamonix 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.249
 a gigantic surge of all 

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:12.730
 1300 athletes accustomed to novice spectators the runner the emotion and 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:15.289
 always at the rendezvous 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:16.219
 from the first 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:19.990
 I wanted but the Catalan kilian Jornet takes the lead of the race and flies away 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:21.570
 towards a second victory 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.050
 a big champion with a big heart like that the mapad but it's not 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.169
 for him who dread it 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:31.149
 during the truce after his victory in the tour 

00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:34.050
 to support him this year it's clear 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.050
 to perfect 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:42.550
 quickly the night falls on the massif of mont-blanc and on the ridges 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.630
 the principle of this extra-long extra-hard race is semi-autonomy 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:50.810
 but everyone is responsible for his health and diet 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.910
 at the resumption the 166 km a fortnight of food still been 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:56.610
 planned 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.340
 always very appreciated 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:59.320

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.270
 never spoke again buddy of spain and europe 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.839
 middle of the night the fatigue is felt 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:07.460
 to read about the faces and the rhythm of the parents 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.100
 but no question of sleeping happily the audience is there enthusiastic 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.100
 latest 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.760
 the day gets up after hard hours fog rain the night has 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.320
 been long and cold she left traces 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.260
 the man was the mans 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:30.350
 they should take off the affirm the Americas 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.270
 mid course in the net the courses are already free some 1500 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.650
 meters the second half of the program 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.880
 already 30% drop 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.560
 I only think about this 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.560
 the radar is lost 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.780
 16-year-old who is coming off his second victory after 9 pm 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.650

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:52.830
 this sunday noon 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.910
 the last riders still have not arrived after two days and 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:00.550
 two nights in the mountains after traveling the equivalent head of my 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.930
 balance sheet and kate mara grave they will be able to say that I did
