00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:10.840
 Hello, I 'm Marlon from the shop everything in parts. 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:13.869
 and in this video I will introduce and install 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:16.869
 also the door sill stainless steel 

00:00:13.869 --> 00:00:18.279
 fiat freemont you know what it's for 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:20.500
 a door sill 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:23.110
 well I'll show it serves you to 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:26.500
 protect this region here at the 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:28.450
 vehicle is normal you check many 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.370
 here in this region of the vehicle by the 

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:33.039
 wear when you enter and exit the 

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:35.079
 car you fatally end up scraping the 

00:00:33.039 --> 00:00:37.900
 or even treading in this region of the 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:41.470
 and it's messing up it will scratch and leave 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:41.920
 nerd worn this region of the door of the 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:44.829
 car 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.090
 ok the threshold besides protecting it goes 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:47.829
 customize your car 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:50.829
 All right then let's proceed with the 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:52.899
 installation before starting installation 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:54.399
 You need to check the threshold. 

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:55.239
 the front door with the door sill 

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:59.170
 back door 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:01:00.730
 ok normally you would think the 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.370
 greater threshold would be the front door 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:04.780
 but in the case of fiat freemont this does not 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:08.459
 it's correct see here 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:11.770
 to put only read here it is not 

00:01:08.459 --> 00:01:13.990
 fully plan, she forces herself 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:17.289
 this can cause over time the 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:19.179
 and then it's actually in the 

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:22.499
 fiat freemont even bigger at the door 

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:24.789
 rear and lower threshold 

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:26.829
 goes that at the front door 

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:30.969
 so the first step is you check 

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:34.529
 the position where Azorean will be more 

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:34.529
 possible plan ok 

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:43.710
 well so I would be checked 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:47.240
 the position I'm going to take from the plastic and 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.240
 I'll do the gluing next 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:02.920
 before you actually paste you have to 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:07.929
 to clean the installation site 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:10.929
 to remove all types of waste dust 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:10.929
 fat 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.710
 Very well now, yes, I'll fix the 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.710
 soller 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.909
 to 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.739
 can not bring 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:13.140
 I'm going to put the sill higher by remembering 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:17.819
 thus this is a feature of the 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:18.810
 Frelimo and the doorway behind the 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:20.849
 front marking 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.340
 usually this does not happen in most 

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:28.400
 of cars larger front broom 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:30.630
 I found here the rock position 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.750
 I'll do the double tape removal 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.750
 face 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:44.400
 even though these the lion up tape 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:44.400
 double-sided 100% of her verse affected 3 m 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:07.050
 remembering that you should look for the 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:07.050
 possible plan 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:34.440
 very well done the installation of one side 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.760
 of the car now just proceed with the 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:38.160
 same procedure 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:40.560
 on the other side of the efficient car concludes 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.700
 installation of door thresholds of 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.650
 fiat freemont 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:45.660
 I hope you enjoyed it if you have 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:48.270
 any questions leave your comments 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:50.130

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:52.880
 forget car accessories is 

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:52.880
