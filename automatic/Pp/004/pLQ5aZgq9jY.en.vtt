00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:38.269 
maybe I got it wrong but this one's got

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:40.330 
maybe I got it wrong but this one's got
all<00:02:38.660> the<00:02:38.870> different<00:02:39.170> films<00:02:39.500> and<00:02:39.650> as<00:02:39.830> well<00:02:40.040> some

the<00:06:21.540> trailer<00:06:21.870> so<00:06:22.500> I've<00:06:22.890> not<00:06:23.100> actually<00:06:23.220> watched

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:23.670 
the trailer so I've not actually watched

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:25.700 
the trailer so I've not actually watched
them<00:06:23.940> as<00:06:24.240> a<00:06:24.450> trailer<00:06:24.840> real<00:06:25.080> but<00:06:25.350> watch<00:06:25.560> them

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:25.710 
them as a trailer real but watch them

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:27.710 
them as a trailer real but watch them
with<00:06:25.830> the<00:06:25.920> intros<00:06:26.280> and<00:06:26.490> that<00:06:26.850> was<00:06:27.210> really

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:27.720 
with the intros and that was really

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:31.520 
with the intros and that was really
really<00:06:27.840> good<00:06:28.020> aim<00:06:29.000> as<00:06:30.000> a<00:06:30.030> bit<00:06:30.240> 13<00:06:30.630> hours<00:06:30.900> 13<00:06:31.410> and

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:31.530 
really good aim as a bit 13 hours 13 and

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:33.350 
really good aim as a bit 13 hours 13 and
a<00:06:31.590> half<00:06:31.620> hours<00:06:32.070> altogether<00:06:32.340> so<00:06:32.790> you<00:06:32.850> have<00:06:33.210> to

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:33.360 
a half hours altogether so you have to

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:35.810 
a half hours altogether so you have to
put<00:06:33.540> aside<00:06:33.660> some<00:06:33.990> time<00:06:34.020> for<00:06:34.230> old<00:06:34.650> and<00:06:34.919> like<00:06:35.790> I

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:35.820 
put aside some time for old and like I

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:38.000 
put aside some time for old and like I
said<00:06:36.000> it's<00:06:36.210> about<00:06:36.390> 14<00:06:36.870> 15<00:06:37.050> pounds<00:06:37.500> in<00:06:37.620> Amazon

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:38.010 
said it's about 14 15 pounds in Amazon

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:40.250 
said it's about 14 15 pounds in Amazon
think<00:06:38.880> it's<00:06:38.970> about<00:06:39.120> 20<00:06:39.660> pounds<00:06:39.810> in<00:06:40.020> this

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:40.260 
think it's about 20 pounds in this

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:43.400 
think it's about 20 pounds in this
or<00:06:40.380> I<00:06:40.740> don't<00:06:41.340> really<00:06:41.940> think<00:06:42.120> is<00:06:42.630> worth<00:06:42.870> picking

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:43.410 
or I don't really think is worth picking

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:45.140 
or I don't really think is worth picking
