00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
well I had a good a good beginning good

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.990 
well I had a good a good beginning good
start<00:00:35.960> with<00:00:36.960> my<00:00:37.110> two<00:00:37.170> linemates<00:00:38.070> brogard<00:00:38.790> in

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
start with my two linemates brogard in

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.100 
start with my two linemates brogard in
the<00:00:39.120> record<00:00:40.050> I<00:00:40.620> think<00:00:41.250> we<00:00:42.210> drink<00:00:42.900> all<00:00:42.989> the

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
the record I think we drink all the

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.650 
the record I think we drink all the
season<00:00:43.410> who<00:00:43.470> had<00:00:43.650> up<00:00:43.920> and<00:00:44.160> downs<00:00:44.340> but<00:00:44.610> we<00:00:45.150> keep

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
season who had up and downs but we keep

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.820 
season who had up and downs but we keep
we<00:00:46.530> keep<00:00:46.710> our<00:00:46.830> game<00:00:47.010> up<00:00:47.190> and<00:00:48.350> that's<00:00:49.350> why<00:00:49.530> I<00:00:49.559> got

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:49.830 
we keep our game up and that's why I got

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:52.670 
we keep our game up and that's why I got
well<00:00:50.610> almost<00:00:50.820> appointed<00:00:51.449> game<00:00:51.570> and<00:00:51.840> I<00:00:52.140> think

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
well almost appointed game and I think

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.130 
well almost appointed game and I think
we<00:00:52.770> were<00:00:52.830> factoring<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:53.910> game<00:00:54.059> ours<00:00:54.540> the

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
we were factoring the game ours the

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.700 
we were factoring the game ours the
second<00:00:55.440> line<00:00:55.530> of<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:55.769> team<00:00:55.949> and<00:00:57.229> well<00:00:58.229> we<00:00:58.500> put

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
second line of the team and well we put

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.969 
second line of the team and well we put
a<00:00:58.920> lot<00:00:59.100> of<00:00:59.220> gold<00:00:59.519> during<00:01:00.300> this<00:01:00.420> season<00:01:00.979> the

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:01.979 
a lot of gold during this season the

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:03.710 
a lot of gold during this season the
adjustment<00:01:02.550> to<00:01:02.790> the<00:01:02.820> major<00:01:03.059> junior<00:01:03.449> level

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:03.720 
adjustment to the major junior level

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:04.850 
adjustment to the major junior level
take<00:01:03.930> me<00:01:04.050> through<00:01:04.080> that<00:01:04.350> tell<00:01:04.620> me<00:01:04.739> how

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
take me through that tell me how

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.760 
take me through that tell me how
difficult<00:01:05.670> and<00:01:05.880> adjustment<00:01:06.510> it<00:01:06.570> was<00:01:06.770> well

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
difficult and adjustment it was well

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.510 
difficult and adjustment it was well
during<00:01:08.190> midget<00:01:08.640> triple-a<00:01:09.140> Wow<00:01:10.280> every<00:01:11.280> player

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
during midget triple-a Wow every player

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.219 
during midget triple-a Wow every player
was<00:01:11.760> 16<00:01:12.630> or<00:01:12.659> 15<00:01:13.290> and<00:01:13.760> I<00:01:14.760> think<00:01:15.000> I<00:01:15.030> was<00:01:15.120> the

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:15.229 
was 16 or 15 and I think I was the

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:19.100 
was 16 or 15 and I think I was the
average<00:01:16.229> size<00:01:16.710> and<00:01:17.100> when<00:01:17.610> I<00:01:17.640> came<00:01:17.790> Junior<00:01:18.659> they

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
average size and when I came Junior they

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.580 
average size and when I came Junior they
were<00:01:19.229> like<00:01:19.350> 20<00:01:19.770> 19<00:01:20.549> bigger<00:01:21.030> than<00:01:21.240> me<00:01:21.930> so<00:01:22.290> it<00:01:22.440> was

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
were like 20 19 bigger than me so it was

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.740 
were like 20 19 bigger than me so it was
tougher<00:01:23.130> because<00:01:23.280> I<00:01:23.580> used<00:01:24.210> to<00:01:24.390> play<00:01:24.479> with<00:01:24.600> my

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
tougher because I used to play with my

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.250 
tougher because I used to play with my
physic<00:01:25.320> a<00:01:25.590> bit<00:01:26.100> and<00:01:26.450> well<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.690> first<00:01:27.900> year<00:01:28.110> was

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:28.260 
physic a bit and well the first year was

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.890 
physic a bit and well the first year was
a<00:01:28.320> tougher<00:01:29.040> but<00:01:29.490> now<00:01:29.670> I'm<00:01:29.850> 17<00:01:30.360> I<00:01:30.390> think<00:01:30.750> I'm<00:01:30.870> a

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
a tougher but now I'm 17 I think I'm a

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.240 
a tougher but now I'm 17 I think I'm a
stronger<00:01:31.830> and<00:01:32.070> bigger<00:01:32.820> I<00:01:33.720> think<00:01:34.200> I'm<00:01:34.380> not<00:01:34.590> well

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:37.830 
i'm everett so i think i can use my

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:41.540 
i'm everett so i think i can use my
physic<00:01:38.490> to<00:01:38.640> uh<00:01:38.810> well<00:01:39.810> gain<00:01:40.800> some<00:01:41.010> battle<00:01:41.340> and

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:41.550 
physic to uh well gain some battle and

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
the head thing when I had a good start

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.470 
the head thing when I had a good start
when<00:01:57.960> I<00:01:57.990> have<00:01:58.140> a<00:01:58.170> good<00:01:58.320> start<00:01:58.560> keep<00:01:59.300> you<00:02:00.300> in<00:02:00.390> the

you've<00:02:02.120> shift<00:02:02.690> after<00:02:02.870> shift<00:02:03.110> on<00:02:03.620> a<00:02:03.650> one-year

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:04.400 
you've shift after shift on a one-year

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.040

practice you know quickly to the

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.580 
practice you know quickly to the
playoffs<00:02:32.330> up<00:02:32.690> two<00:02:32.870> nothing<00:02:32.990> after<00:02:33.290> winning

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
playoffs up two nothing after winning

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.440 
playoffs up two nothing after winning
both<00:02:33.740> games<00:02:33.800> in<00:02:34.250> Halifax<00:02:34.700> great<00:02:34.940> start<00:02:35.240> to<00:02:35.360> the

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
both games in Halifax great start to the

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:36.790 
both games in Halifax great start to the
series<00:02:35.660> why<00:02:35.930> have<00:02:36.110> you<00:02:36.170> had<00:02:36.350> the<00:02:36.440> success

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
series why have you had the success

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.530 
series why have you had the success
you've<00:02:37.040> you've<00:02:37.550> had<00:02:37.730> here<00:02:37.940> in<00:02:38.000> the<00:02:38.150> first<00:02:38.390> two

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
you've you've had here in the first two

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.310 
you've you've had here in the first two
games<00:02:38.570> I<00:02:39.020> think<00:02:40.030> that's<00:02:41.030> the<00:02:41.360> series<00:02:41.810> the

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:42.320 
games I think that's the series the

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.970 
games I think that's the series the
playoffs<00:02:42.620> are<00:02:42.830> so<00:02:43.340> intense<00:02:43.700> and<00:02:44.080> I'm<00:02:45.080> the<00:02:45.290> type

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
playoffs are so intense and I'm the type

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.910 
playoffs are so intense and I'm the type
of<00:02:46.010> player<00:02:46.340> that<00:02:46.370> when<00:02:47.120> you<00:02:47.180> have<00:02:47.360> a<00:02:47.710> goal<00:02:48.710> and

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
of player that when you have a goal and

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.550 
of player that when you have a goal and
a<00:02:49.070> something<00:02:49.760> to<00:02:49.880> push<00:02:50.030> you<00:02:50.210> it's<00:02:50.810> so<00:02:51.140> easy<00:02:51.320> to

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
a something to push you it's so easy to

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.450 
a something to push you it's so easy to
play<00:02:52.220> well<00:02:52.400> and<00:02:52.640> to<00:02:53.000> be<00:02:53.090> intense<00:02:53.360> and<00:02:54.460> finally
