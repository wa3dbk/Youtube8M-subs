this<00:02:16.010> is<00:02:16.310> going<00:02:16.610> to<00:02:16.730> be<00:02:16.850> deciding<00:02:17.390> where<00:02:17.630> to

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:18.460 
this is going to be deciding where to

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:21.280 
this is going to be deciding where to
cut<00:02:19.460> the<00:02:19.760> roll<00:02:19.970> cage<00:02:20.210> so<00:02:20.570> we're<00:02:20.960> going<00:02:21.200> to

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
cut the roll cage so we're going to

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.220 
cut the roll cage so we're going to
place<00:02:21.860> the<00:02:22.130> unit<00:02:22.280> on<00:02:22.640> the<00:02:22.790> back<00:02:22.990> and<00:02:23.990> we're

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
place the unit on the back and we're

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:25.360 
place the unit on the back and we're
going<00:02:24.350> to<00:02:24.380> take<00:02:24.620> a<00:02:24.650> look<00:02:24.920> at<00:02:25.040> all<00:02:25.160> of<00:02:25.190> our

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
going to take a look at all of our

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.070 
going to take a look at all of our
surrounding<00:02:25.970> objects<00:02:26.420> to<00:02:26.570> make<00:02:26.690> sure<00:02:26.900> that

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
surrounding objects to make sure that

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.710 
surrounding objects to make sure that
it's<00:02:27.230> not<00:02:27.410> going<00:02:27.620> to<00:02:27.680> hit<00:02:27.860> anything<00:02:28.130> and<00:02:28.970> we're

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
it's not going to hit anything and we're

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.990 
it's not going to hit anything and we're
going<00:02:30.020> to<00:02:30.050> use<00:02:30.470> a<00:02:30.800> magic<00:02:31.460> marker<00:02:31.930> and<00:02:33.850> just<00:02:34.850> out

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
going to use a magic marker and just out

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.700 
going to use a magic marker and just out
of<00:02:35.030> experience<00:02:35.870> I<00:02:36.020> know<00:02:36.080> that<00:02:36.410> we're<00:02:36.560> going<00:02:36.650> to

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:36.710 
of experience I know that we're going to

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:41.460 
of experience I know that we're going to
want<00:02:36.980> the<00:02:37.750> brace<00:02:38.750> itself<00:02:39.490> the<00:02:40.490> h-bomb

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
want the brace itself the h-bomb

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.140 
want the brace itself the h-bomb
placement<00:02:42.470> so<00:02:42.800> that<00:02:42.980> when<00:02:43.130> you<00:02:43.250> cut<00:02:43.610> it<00:02:43.790> that

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
placement so that when you cut it that

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.120 
placement so that when you cut it that
there<00:02:44.390> is<00:02:44.540> still<00:02:44.810> plenty<00:02:45.080> of<00:02:45.320> tube<00:02:45.620> left<00:02:45.980> in

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
there is still plenty of tube left in

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:48.670 
there is still plenty of tube left in
the<00:02:46.250> back<00:02:46.459> so<00:02:46.730> we're<00:02:46.880> going<00:02:46.970> to<00:02:47.030> cut<00:02:47.350> cut<00:02:48.350> it<00:02:48.500> so

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
the back so we're going to cut cut it so

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.980 
the back so we're going to cut cut it so
that<00:02:48.709> there's<00:02:49.040> more<00:02:49.310> forward<00:02:49.970> tube<00:02:50.300> sliding

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:50.990 
that there's more forward tube sliding

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:53.500 
that there's more forward tube sliding
in<00:02:51.230> than<00:02:51.890> there<00:02:52.130> is<00:02:52.280> rear<00:02:52.610> tube<00:02:52.880> holding<00:02:53.270> it<00:02:53.360> on

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
in than there is rear tube holding it on

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.540 
in than there is rear tube holding it on
because<00:02:53.840> we<00:02:53.959> do<00:02:54.080> have<00:02:54.260> the<00:02:54.470> set<00:02:54.950> screws<00:02:55.280> in<00:02:55.459> the

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:55.550 
because we do have the set screws in the

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:57.970 
because we do have the set screws in the
back<00:02:55.870> to<00:02:56.870> set<00:02:57.320> it<00:02:57.470> so<00:02:57.590> we're<00:02:57.709> going<00:02:57.800> to<00:02:57.860> go

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
back to set it so we're going to go

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.150 
back to set it so we're going to go
about<00:02:58.239> 3/4<00:02:59.239> of<00:02:59.270> the<00:02:59.480> way<00:02:59.660> back<00:03:00.050> I'm<00:03:00.920> going<00:03:01.100> to

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
about 3/4 of the way back I'm going to

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:06.760 
about 3/4 of the way back I'm going to
go<00:03:01.280> ahead<00:03:01.370> and<00:03:01.610> mark<00:03:01.820> that<00:03:02.090> with<00:03:04.239> our<00:03:05.239> pen<00:03:05.770> on

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:06.770 
go ahead and mark that with our pen on

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:10.000 
go ahead and mark that with our pen on
both<00:03:07.010> sides<00:03:07.989> so<00:03:08.989> that<00:03:09.020> we<00:03:09.200> can<00:03:09.470> see<00:03:09.680> it<00:03:09.800> I'm

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
both sides so that we can see it I'm

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:11.500 
both sides so that we can see it I'm
going<00:03:10.160> to<00:03:10.220> try<00:03:10.340> to<00:03:10.400> make<00:03:10.610> them<00:03:10.790> just<00:03:10.940> as<00:03:11.150> even

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
going to try to make them just as even

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:16.060 
going to try to make them just as even
as<00:03:11.840> possible<00:03:12.550> gonna<00:03:13.550> measure<00:03:13.790> up<00:03:14.000> and<00:03:14.890> see<00:03:15.890> how

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:16.070 
as possible gonna measure up and see how

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:17.920 
as possible gonna measure up and see how
even<00:03:16.430> we<00:03:16.580> came<00:03:16.820> we<00:03:17.030> were<00:03:17.090> pretty<00:03:17.360> close<00:03:17.600> there

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:20.330 
go ahead and mark this one up a little

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:23.770 
go ahead and mark this one up a little
further<00:03:20.680> there<00:03:21.680> we<00:03:21.830> go<00:03:22.299> now<00:03:23.299> you<00:03:23.360> can<00:03:23.630> use<00:03:23.750> a

further there we go now you can use a

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:26.680 
further there we go now you can use a
wire<00:03:24.140> cutter<00:03:24.500> into<00:03:25.190> the<00:03:25.340> hacksaw<00:03:25.910> you<00:03:26.330> can<00:03:26.540> use
