00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
not the best store in the world but um

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.210 
not the best store in the world but um
really<00:01:33.600> all<00:01:33.869> you<00:01:33.960> have<00:01:34.049> to<00:01:34.140> do<00:01:34.259> is<00:01:34.500> sew<00:01:34.799> both

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
really all you have to do is sew both

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.480 
really all you have to do is sew both
sides<00:01:35.729> and<00:01:36.680> you're<00:01:37.680> going<00:01:37.890> like<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.130> side<00:01:38.369> of

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
sides and you're going like the side of

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.929 
sides and you're going like the side of
spread<00:01:38.700> that<00:01:38.820> you<00:01:39.180> put<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:39.840> tampon<00:01:40.259> in<00:01:40.470> and

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:40.939 
spread that you put the tampon in and

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:44.090 
spread that you put the tampon in and
then<00:01:41.939> this<00:01:42.299> side<00:01:42.570> is<00:01:42.930> where<00:01:43.079> holdren<00:01:43.710> already

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
then this side is where holdren already

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.149 
then this side is where holdren already
folded<00:01:44.280> so<00:01:44.909> that's<00:01:45.060> always<00:01:45.299> good

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:46.159 
folded so that's always good

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:48.859 
folded so that's always good
okay<00:01:47.159> so<00:01:47.220> that's<00:01:47.430> all<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:47.640> way<00:01:47.759> out<00:01:47.909> and<00:01:48.210> I

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
okay so that's all the way out and I

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.380 
okay so that's all the way out and I
suggest<00:01:49.290> using<00:01:49.409> a<00:01:49.890> pencil<00:01:50.430> to<00:01:50.850> like<00:01:51.770> get<00:01:52.770> the

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
suggest using a pencil to like get the

00:01:53.390 --> 00:02:03.230 
suggest using a pencil to like get the
edges<00:01:55.070> completely<00:01:56.090> out<00:01:58.490> so<00:01:59.490> it<00:01:59.790> looks<00:02:00.530> nicer

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
edges completely out so it looks nicer

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:12.300 
edges completely out so it looks nicer
so<00:02:04.240> there<00:02:04.479> was<00:02:04.600> that<00:02:05.400> and<00:02:06.400> yeah<00:02:07.270> so<00:02:09.989> and<00:02:11.310> we

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
so there was that and yeah so and we

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:17.400 
so there was that and yeah so and we
just<00:02:13.500> put<00:02:14.500> it<00:02:14.530> in<00:02:14.680> and<00:02:15.430> I<00:02:15.760> whoopsies<00:02:16.360> and<00:02:17.260> then

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
just put it in and I whoopsies and then

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.600 
just put it in and I whoopsies and then
left<00:02:17.650> it<00:02:18.190> open<00:02:19.180> right<00:02:19.209> here<00:02:19.450> so<00:02:19.630> it's<00:02:19.750> easy<00:02:19.959> to

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
left it open right here so it's easy to

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.320 
left it open right here so it's easy to
put<00:02:21.610> in<00:02:21.790> take<00:02:22.120> out<00:02:22.980> and<00:02:23.980> then<00:02:24.010> you<00:02:24.819> just<00:02:24.850> slide

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
put in take out and then you just slide

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:32.670 
put in take out and then you just slide
it<00:02:25.480> to<00:02:25.660> the<00:02:25.750> bottom<00:02:29.190> like<00:02:30.190> that<00:02:31.349> if<00:02:32.349> you<00:02:32.500> want

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
it to the bottom like that if you want

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:55.350 
it to the bottom like that if you want
to<00:02:32.739> get<00:02:50.250> it<00:02:51.250> just<00:02:51.400> peels<00:02:51.760> off<00:02:51.970> and<00:02:54.360> it's

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
to get it just peels off and it's

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.900 
to get it just peels off and it's
already<00:02:55.690> like<00:02:56.160> really<00:02:57.160> secure<00:02:57.400> in<00:02:57.970> place<00:02:58.660> I

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
already like really secure in place I

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.490 
already like really secure in place I
