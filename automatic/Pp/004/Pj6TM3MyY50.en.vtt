is 1.1 the initial launch was a little
bit<00:00:27.820> bumpy<00:00:28.240> there<00:00:28.690> was<00:00:28.780> a<00:00:28.810> few<00:00:29.050> issues<00:00:29.140> or<00:00:29.470> not

bit bumpy there was a few issues or not
along<00:00:29.830> the<00:00:29.950> way<00:00:29.980> most<00:00:30.610> of<00:00:30.789> these<00:00:30.850> sort<00:00:31.180> of

bunks<00:00:31.539> have<00:00:31.660> actually<00:00:31.930> been<00:00:32.110> fixed<00:00:32.559> now<00:00:32.710> there

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:33.220 
bunks have actually been fixed now there

bunks have actually been fixed now there
was<00:00:33.309> one<00:00:33.460> issue<00:00:33.640> there<00:00:34.030> which<00:00:34.360> are<00:00:34.510> supposed

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:34.780 
was one issue there which are supposed

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:36.119 
was one issue there which are supposed
really<00:00:35.230> it's<00:00:35.350> more<00:00:35.500> of<00:00:35.559> a<00:00:35.620> hardware<00:00:35.890> issue

00:00:36.119 --> 00:00:36.129 
really it's more of a hardware issue

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:38.250 
really it's more of a hardware issue
than<00:00:36.520> anything<00:00:36.879> star<00:00:37.210> citizen<00:00:37.660> or<00:00:37.780> ours<00:00:37.960> I

didn't have enough servers in particular
areas<00:00:40.870> to<00:00:41.110> deal<00:00:41.500> with<00:00:41.650> a<00:00:41.739> load<00:00:41.949> you<00:00:42.370> could<00:00:42.550> see

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:42.730 
areas to deal with a load you could see

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:44.130 
areas to deal with a load you could see
this<00:00:42.879> as<00:00:43.000> a<00:00:43.030> bad<00:00:43.210> thing<00:00:43.270> that<00:00:43.720> the<00:00:43.810> good<00:00:43.960> news

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:44.140 
this as a bad thing that the good news

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:45.750 
this as a bad thing that the good news
was<00:00:44.560> that<00:00:44.620> there<00:00:45.010> was<00:00:45.100> a<00:00:45.130> lot<00:00:45.310> more<00:00:45.340> people

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:45.760 
was that there was a lot more people

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.940 
was that there was a lot more people
playing<00:00:46.090> in<00:00:46.420> patch<00:00:46.960> 1.1<00:00:47.560> and<00:00:47.739> then<00:00:47.829> the

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:47.950 
playing in patch 1.1 and then the

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:49.680 
playing in patch 1.1 and then the
previous<00:00:48.310> patches<00:00:48.730> which<00:00:49.090> is<00:00:49.210> good<00:00:49.420> not<00:00:49.660> only

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:49.690 
previous patches which is good not only

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:51.450 
previous patches which is good not only
for<00:00:49.840> our<00:00:50.079> side<00:00:50.380> but<00:00:50.680> it's<00:00:50.920> good<00:00:51.070> for<00:00:51.220> us<00:00:51.250> as

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:51.460 
for our side but it's good for us as

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:52.680 
for our side but it's good for us as
well<00:00:51.670> because<00:00:51.970> I'll<00:00:52.059> see<00:00:52.180> the<00:00:52.270> more<00:00:52.450> people

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:52.690 
well because I'll see the more people

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:54.630 
well because I'll see the more people
that<00:00:52.720> play<00:00:53.020> the<00:00:53.470> better<00:00:53.739> the<00:00:53.920> load<00:00:54.070> testing<00:00:54.520> is

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:54.640 
that play the better the load testing is

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.280 
that play the better the load testing is
so<00:00:54.910> ions<00:00:55.329> that<00:00:55.450> limp<00:00:55.690> bugs<00:00:55.899> a<00:00:56.020> little<00:00:56.200> bit

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:56.290 
so ions that limp bugs a little bit

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:58.049 
so ions that limp bugs a little bit
easier<00:00:56.410> for<00:00:56.590> us<00:00:56.860> some<00:00:57.399> of<00:00:57.489> the<00:00:57.550> things<00:00:57.730> we<00:00:57.880> saw

00:00:58.049 --> 00:00:58.059 
easier for us some of the things we saw

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:01.020 
easier for us some of the things we saw
in<00:00:58.300> that<00:00:58.450> patch<00:00:58.750> update<00:00:59.170> in<00:00:59.380> 1.1<00:01:00.010> was<00:01:00.700> the

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.030 
in that patch update in 1.1 was the

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:03.360 
in that patch update in 1.1 was the
landing<00:01:01.780> mechanic<00:01:02.200> which<00:01:02.350> is<00:01:02.500> pretty<00:01:02.950> good<00:01:03.219> i

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:03.370 
landing mechanic which is pretty good i

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.310 
landing mechanic which is pretty good i
like<00:01:03.550> the<00:01:03.760> look<00:01:04.149> of<00:01:04.180> it<00:01:04.300> so<00:01:04.449> far<00:01:04.479> if<00:01:05.080> you<00:01:05.229> look

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.320 
like the look of it so far if you look

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:06.780 
like the look of it so far if you look
at<00:01:05.410> my<00:01:05.530> last<00:01:05.710> video<00:01:06.009> you<00:01:06.070> can<00:01:06.220> see<00:01:06.430> me<00:01:06.550> sort<00:01:06.729> of

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:06.790 
at my last video you can see me sort of

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:08.370 
at my last video you can see me sort of
demonstrating<00:01:07.390> that<00:01:07.420> part<00:01:07.930> of<00:01:07.990> the<00:01:08.050> upgrade

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.380 
demonstrating that part of the upgrade

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.820 
demonstrating that part of the upgrade
for<00:01:08.680> 1.1<00:01:09.160> was<00:01:09.460> also<00:01:09.820> to<00:01:10.170> reinstall<00:01:11.170> the<00:01:11.649> whole

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:11.830 
for 1.1 was also to reinstall the whole

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:13.889 
for 1.1 was also to reinstall the whole
entire<00:01:12.100> game<00:01:12.430> it<00:01:12.880> did<00:01:13.090> actually<00:01:13.270> increase<00:01:13.720> in

00:01:13.889 --> 00:01:13.899 
entire game it did actually increase in

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:15.690 
entire game it did actually increase in
size<00:01:14.110> slightly<00:01:14.410> by<00:01:14.649> about<00:01:14.860> five<00:01:15.130> gig<00:01:15.369> as<00:01:15.520> well

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:15.700 
size slightly by about five gig as well

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.570 
size slightly by about five gig as well
I<00:01:15.940> think<00:01:16.420> one<00:01:16.630> of<00:01:16.659> the<00:01:16.810> reasons<00:01:16.960> was<00:01:17.320> is<00:01:17.560> RS<00:01:18.430> I

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:18.580 
I think one of the reasons was is RS I

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.880 
I think one of the reasons was is RS I
wanted<00:01:19.420> to<00:01:19.540> make<00:01:19.659> sure<00:01:19.720> that<00:01:20.170> everyone<00:01:20.409> was<00:01:20.710> on

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:20.890 
wanted to make sure that everyone was on

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.100 
wanted to make sure that everyone was on
the<00:01:21.040> same<00:01:21.070> playing<00:01:21.520> field<00:01:21.640> and<00:01:22.330> also<00:01:22.750> I

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.110 
the same playing field and also I

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:25.230 
the same playing field and also I
believe<00:01:23.440> that<00:01:23.860> 64<00:01:24.340> bit<00:01:24.549> positions<00:01:25.030> been

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 
believe that 64 bit positions been

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.090 
believe that 64 bit positions been
implement<00:01:25.750> into<00:01:26.110> the<00:01:26.200> game<00:01:26.380> although<00:01:26.710> we're

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100 
implement into the game although we're

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.940 
implement into the game although we're
not<00:01:27.130> really<00:01:27.549> seeing<00:01:27.939> any<00:01:28.360> dramatic<00:01:28.830> impact<00:01:29.830> by

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
not really seeing any dramatic impact by

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.320 
not really seeing any dramatic impact by
that<00:01:30.130> yet<00:01:30.369> we're<00:01:30.670> probably<00:01:30.880> more<00:01:31.119> likely

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:31.330 
that yet we're probably more likely

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:32.490 
that yet we're probably more likely
going<00:01:31.510> to<00:01:31.570> see<00:01:31.780> that<00:01:32.020> it's<00:01:32.110> probably<00:01:32.320> going<00:01:32.439> to

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:32.500 
going to see that it's probably going to

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.440 
going to see that it's probably going to
be<00:01:32.560> the<00:01:32.740> most<00:01:32.830> beneficial<00:01:33.010> size<00:01:33.640> is<00:01:34.119> obviously

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
be the most beneficial size is obviously

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.120 
be the most beneficial size is obviously
the<00:01:34.510> map<00:01:34.720> size<00:01:34.990> increasing<00:01:35.650> and<00:01:35.799> so<00:01:35.950> on<00:01:36.100> so

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.130 
the map size increasing and so on so

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:37.560 
the map size increasing and so on so
it's<00:01:36.340> something<00:01:36.490> to<00:01:36.640> look<00:01:36.670> forward<00:01:36.970> to<00:01:37.210> in

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:37.570 
it's something to look forward to in

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:39.539 
it's something to look forward to in
upcoming<00:01:37.930> patch<00:01:38.200> updates<00:01:38.619> the<00:01:39.010> Gladius<00:01:39.430> is

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:39.549 
upcoming patch updates the Gladius is

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:41.910 
upcoming patch updates the Gladius is
now<00:01:39.790> flyable<00:01:40.360> seems<00:01:41.200> quite<00:01:41.439> good<00:01:41.650> needs<00:01:41.860> a

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
now flyable seems quite good needs a

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.800 
now flyable seems quite good needs a
little<00:01:42.040> bit<00:01:42.250> of<00:01:42.280> adjusting<00:01:43.240> here<00:01:43.479> and<00:01:43.630> there

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
little bit of adjusting here and there

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
actually going to affect the ships

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.220 
actually going to affect the ships
before<00:02:30.430> Matt<00:02:30.790> at<00:02:31.030> the<00:02:31.060> moment<00:02:31.510> but<00:02:32.020> we're

to<00:02:41.860> wait<00:02:42.010> and<00:02:42.160> see<00:02:42.220> on<00:02:42.370> that<00:02:42.520> the<00:02:43.090> main<00:02:43.300> engine

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
to wait and see on that the main engine

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.770 
to wait and see on that the main engine
thrusters<00:02:44.260> it's<00:02:44.470> got<00:02:44.620> two<00:02:44.860> TR<00:02:45.460> fours<00:02:45.850> which<00:02:46.600> is

thrusters it's got two TR fours which is

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.510 
thrusters it's got two TR fours which is
relatively<00:02:47.140> large<00:02:47.440> actually<00:02:47.830> is<00:02:47.890> prettier<00:02:48.160> so

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:48.520 
relatively large actually is prettier so

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.210 
relatively large actually is prettier so
it<00:02:48.610> should<00:02:48.760> be<00:02:48.790> pretty<00:02:48.880> nippy<00:02:49.360> 12<00:02:49.870> TR<00:02:50.650> to

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
it should be pretty nippy 12 TR to

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.670 
it should be pretty nippy 12 TR to
maneuver<00:02:51.970> thrusters<00:02:52.420> maximum<00:02:53.170> shields<00:02:53.590> of

two<00:02:53.920> does<00:02:54.250> seem<00:02:54.490> low<00:02:54.730> but<00:02:55.360> apparently<00:02:55.720> this

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
two does seem low but apparently this

tank<00:02:58.270> taking<00:02:58.810> a<00:02:58.900> beating<00:02:59.110> so<00:02:59.860> I'm<00:02:59.920> assuming

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
tank taking a beating so I'm assuming

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.070

the actual physical hull armor is going

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.900 
the actual physical hull armor is going
to<00:03:02.140> be<00:03:02.230> pretty<00:03:02.500> pretty<00:03:02.800> good<00:03:03.070> at<00:03:03.460> the<00:03:03.580> front<00:03:03.820> of

ship looks absolutely fantastic it looks

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:50.490 
ship looks absolutely fantastic it looks
very<00:03:48.580> stealth<00:03:49.180> like<00:03:49.300> and<00:03:49.750> there's<00:03:50.260> quite<00:03:50.470> a

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
very stealth like and there's quite a

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
lot of animation points on it as well

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:53.910 
lot of animation points on it as well
now<00:03:52.510> although<00:03:52.840> this<00:03:53.020> one's<00:03:53.230> not<00:03:53.350> really<00:03:53.650> news

playing<00:03:55.690> around<00:03:55.900> with<00:03:56.230> the<00:03:56.650> creating

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 
playing around with the creating

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.880 
playing around with the creating
different<00:03:57.520> types<00:03:57.880> of<00:03:58.060> user<00:03:58.720> config<00:03:59.350> files<00:03:59.620> and

00:03:59.880 --> 00:03:59.890 
different types of user config files and

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:01.560 
different types of user config files and
for<00:04:00.370> use<00:04:00.459> for<00:04:00.700> the<00:04:00.850> people<00:04:01.060> that<00:04:01.270> don't<00:04:01.480> know

the<00:04:01.870> way<00:04:01.959> the<00:04:02.110> CryEngine<00:04:02.650> works<00:04:02.890> i<00:04:03.100> think

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
the way the CryEngine works i think

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.100 
the way the CryEngine works i think
there's<00:04:03.400> a<00:04:03.459> couple<00:04:03.610> of<00:04:03.820> file<00:04:04.000> types<00:04:04.330> that<00:04:04.720> the

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:05.110 
there's a couple of file types that the

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:07.199 
there's a couple of file types that the
cryo<00:04:05.350> engine<00:04:05.770> can<00:04:05.950> accept<00:04:06.610> it's<00:04:06.850> normally<00:04:07.180> a

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:07.209 
cryo engine can accept it's normally a

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:10.800 
cryo engine can accept it's normally a
game<00:04:07.600> config<00:04:08.290> or<00:04:08.500> user<00:04:08.800> config<00:04:09.550> now<00:04:10.120> they're

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:10.810 
game config or user config now they're

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:12.090 
game config or user config now they're
the<00:04:10.959> two<00:04:11.110> ones<00:04:11.350> you<00:04:11.500> can<00:04:11.620> actually<00:04:11.770> configure

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:12.100 
the two ones you can actually configure

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:14.070 
the two ones you can actually configure
the<00:04:12.760> stock<00:04:13.000> wonder<00:04:13.270> you<00:04:13.360> actually<00:04:13.660> get<00:04:13.870> with

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:14.080 
the stock wonder you actually get with

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:16.680 
the stock wonder you actually get with
your<00:04:14.560> game<00:04:14.830> installation<00:04:15.160> is<00:04:15.670> the<00:04:16.120> system

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
your game installation is the system

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:18.810 
your game installation is the system
config<00:04:17.169> that's<00:04:17.650> the<00:04:17.770> configuration<00:04:18.459> file<00:04:18.669> the

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:18.820 
config that's the configuration file the

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:21.000 
config that's the configuration file the
game<00:04:19.060> needs<00:04:19.330> to<00:04:19.480> launch<00:04:19.690> so<00:04:20.380> what<00:04:20.859> I've<00:04:20.980> done

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.010 
game needs to launch so what I've done

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:23.250 
game needs to launch so what I've done
is<00:04:21.190> I<00:04:21.640> create<00:04:22.120> my<00:04:22.150> own<00:04:22.240> sunny<00:04:22.600> a<00:04:22.690> small<00:04:22.990> file

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:23.260 
is I create my own sunny a small file

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.440 
is I create my own sunny a small file
but<00:04:23.560> I<00:04:23.680> saw<00:04:24.160> significant<00:04:24.880> improvements<00:04:25.390> for

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:25.450 
but I saw significant improvements for

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:27.000 
but I saw significant improvements for
the<00:04:25.540> people<00:04:25.810> that<00:04:25.990> are<00:04:26.020> using<00:04:26.320> crossfire<00:04:26.770> I

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.010 
the people that are using crossfire I

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:28.680 
the people that are using crossfire I
don't<00:04:27.250> know<00:04:27.430> if<00:04:27.880> this<00:04:28.060> is<00:04:28.090> going<00:04:28.300> to<00:04:28.360> help<00:04:28.540> the

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:31.480 
people out using SLI I saw increases in

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:33.990 
people out using SLI I saw increases in
game<00:04:31.690> of<00:04:31.990> around<00:04:32.290> about<00:04:32.380> 10<00:04:32.710> to<00:04:32.830> 15<00:04:32.950> fps<00:04:33.610> I<00:04:33.910> know

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:54.640 
relating to our SI but it does suppose

definitely want to be doing this is the

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:10.500 
definitely want to be doing this is the
reason<00:05:08.920> why<00:05:09.250> I<00:05:09.280> wanted<00:05:09.580> to<00:05:09.700> sort<00:05:09.910> the<00:05:10.090> depth<00:05:10.300> of

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:10.510 
reason why I wanted to sort the depth of

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:12.600 
reason why I wanted to sort the depth of
playing<00:05:11.050> around<00:05:11.260> my<00:05:11.470> user<00:05:11.710> config<00:05:12.190> to<00:05:12.310> see<00:05:12.520> if

I<00:05:12.760> could<00:05:12.820> get<00:05:13.540> a<00:05:13.570> sort<00:05:14.500> of<00:05:14.530> good<00:05:14.710> FPS<00:05:14.860> in<00:05:15.280> 4k<00:05:15.670> so

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:15.970 
I could get a sort of good FPS in 4k so

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:17.480 
I could get a sort of good FPS in 4k so
I<00:05:16.000> could<00:05:16.300> maybe<00:05:16.810> just<00:05:16.930> do<00:05:17.170> a<00:05:17.200> demonstration

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:17.490 
I could maybe just do a demonstration

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:19.500 
I could maybe just do a demonstration
it's<00:05:18.490> something<00:05:18.820> I<00:05:19.000> would<00:05:19.150> definitely<00:05:19.270> like

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:19.510 
it's something I would definitely like

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:21.570 
it's something I would definitely like
to<00:05:19.570> move<00:05:19.870> to<00:05:20.260> the<00:05:20.590> only<00:05:20.800> reason<00:05:21.100> that<00:05:21.130> I<00:05:21.250> didn't

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:21.580 
to move to the only reason that I didn't

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:24.600 
to move to the only reason that I didn't
go<00:05:21.730> to<00:05:21.760> 4k<00:05:22.720> before<00:05:23.350> for<00:05:23.890> the<00:05:23.950> main<00:05:24.100> reason<00:05:24.490> of

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:24.610 
go to 4k before for the main reason of

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:27.270 
go to 4k before for the main reason of
if<00:05:24.910> you<00:05:25.030> do<00:05:25.150> 4k<00:05:25.450> previous<00:05:26.170> previously<00:05:27.010> to<00:05:27.160> the

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:27.280 
if you do 4k previous previously to the

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.460 
if you do 4k previous previously to the
latest<00:05:27.640> update<00:05:28.030> from<00:05:28.300> YouTube<00:05:28.750> the<00:05:29.200> problem

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:29.470 
latest update from YouTube the problem

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:32.580 
latest update from YouTube the problem
you<00:05:29.560> would<00:05:29.650> get<00:05:29.890> is<00:05:30.160> the<00:05:30.840> 720<00:05:31.840> and<00:05:32.020> the<00:05:32.140> 1080p

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:32.590 
you would get is the 720 and the 1080p

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:35.370 
you would get is the 720 and the 1080p
would<00:05:33.310> automatically<00:05:33.880> go<00:05:34.090> to<00:05:34.120> 30fps<00:05:34.690> which<00:05:35.200> is

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:35.380 
would automatically go to 30fps which is

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:37.500 
would automatically go to 30fps which is
sort<00:05:35.650> of<00:05:35.680> see<00:05:35.890> no<00:05:36.250> point<00:05:36.460> doing<00:05:36.670> there<00:05:36.910> so

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:37.510 
sort of see no point doing there so

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:39.270 
sort of see no point doing there so
something<00:05:38.050> I'm<00:05:38.140> looking<00:05:38.170> into<00:05:38.530> guys<00:05:38.890> once

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:39.280 
something I'm looking into guys once

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.580 
something I'm looking into guys once
I've<00:05:39.460> cracked<00:05:39.700> it<00:05:39.910> I'll<00:05:40.660> put<00:05:40.870> a<00:05:40.900> video<00:05:41.110> out<00:05:41.260> so

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:41.590 
I've cracked it I'll put a video out so

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:43.530 
I've cracked it I'll put a video out so
you<00:05:41.650> can<00:05:41.800> take<00:05:42.040> a<00:05:42.070> look<00:05:42.310> and<00:05:42.970> hopefully<00:05:43.120> then

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:43.540 
you can take a look and hopefully then

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:44.910 
you can take a look and hopefully then
that<00:05:43.690> way<00:05:43.840> that<00:05:44.050> covers<00:05:44.350> all<00:05:44.440> the<00:05:44.500> audience

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:44.920 
that way that covers all the audience

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:46.590 
that way that covers all the audience
for<00:05:45.040> the<00:05:45.100> people<00:05:45.370> that<00:05:45.550> are<00:05:45.580> watching<00:05:45.790> in<00:05:46.060> 720

they'll<00:06:12.970> see<00:06:13.120> the<00:06:13.210> full<00:06:13.390> games<00:06:13.630> not<00:06:13.840> there<00:06:14.080> but

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:14.680 
they'll see the full games not there but

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:16.470 
they'll see the full games not there but
I<00:06:14.890> see<00:06:15.280> some<00:06:15.550> of<00:06:15.580> the<00:06:15.730> challenges<00:06:15.910> that<00:06:16.180> they

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:16.480 
I see some of the challenges that they

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:17.880 
I see some of the challenges that they
would<00:06:16.690> have<00:06:16.810> had<00:06:16.990> if<00:06:17.290> they<00:06:17.410> would<00:06:17.530> have<00:06:17.620> kept

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:17.890 
would have had if they would have kept

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:19.860 
would have had if they would have kept
off<00:06:18.040> to<00:06:18.220> the<00:06:18.340> ranee<00:06:18.640> new<00:06:18.820> commander<00:06:19.300> 1.1

off to the ranee new commander 1.1

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:21.630 
off to the ranee new commander 1.1
there's<00:06:20.320> obviously<00:06:20.560> once<00:06:20.740> the<00:06:20.890> FPS<00:06:21.250> module

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:21.640 
there's obviously once the FPS module

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:23.100 
there's obviously once the FPS module
comes<00:06:21.850> out<00:06:22.060> what<00:06:22.660> you're<00:06:22.780> going<00:06:22.870> to<00:06:22.960> call<00:06:23.080> it

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:23.110 
comes out what you're going to call it

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:24.510 
comes out what you're going to call it
then<00:06:23.380> you<00:06:23.530> can't<00:06:23.710> call<00:06:23.920> it<00:06:24.040> arena<00:06:24.310> commander

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:24.520 
then you can't call it arena commander

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:27.330 
then you can't call it arena commander
FPS<00:06:25.390> module<00:06:25.810> 1.1<00:06:26.350> and<00:06:26.530> then<00:06:26.950> when<00:06:27.130> you<00:06:27.220> add

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:27.340 
FPS module 1.1 and then when you add

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:29.640 
FPS module 1.1 and then when you add
another<00:06:27.640> module<00:06:27.880> on<00:06:28.090> that<00:06:28.300> you<00:06:28.750> know<00:06:28.900> you<00:06:29.530> may

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:29.650 
another module on that you know you may

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:31.350 
another module on that you know you may
also<00:06:29.770> just<00:06:29.980> make<00:06:30.340> that<00:06:30.520> call<00:06:30.730> and<00:06:30.820> say<00:06:31.000> let's

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:31.360 
also just make that call and say let's

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:34.920 
also just make that call and say let's
just<00:06:31.420> call<00:06:31.750> it<00:06:31.780> star<00:06:32.440> citizen<00:06:32.950> 1.1<00:06:33.880> also<00:06:34.450> some

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:34.930 
just call it star citizen 1.1 also some

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:36.780 
just call it star citizen 1.1 also some
other<00:06:35.080> news<00:06:35.290> as<00:06:35.440> well<00:06:35.680> which<00:06:35.890> is<00:06:35.920> coming<00:06:36.460> up<00:06:36.610> in
