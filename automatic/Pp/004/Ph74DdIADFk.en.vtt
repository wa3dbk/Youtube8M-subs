00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:09.889
 welcome working at mister 

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:12.500
 Today I show you how to do such a thing 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:15.530
 even that frog origami frog 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:17.869
 jumps to us quite a handed 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:20.810
 simple sheet of paper on green bit 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:23.000
 because the researcher is green and we are 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:25.400
 start by pointing the tip 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.590
 From the top of the customer falls on top 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.510
 Of course you can also do the same with me 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:33.890
 make any four others 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:35.140
 as long as it's square afterwards 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.699
 open the fold again 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:41.170
 and also the point from the right to the 

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:41.170
 fold from left to right 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:54.070
 but now open again in the 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.750
 in the middle backwards fold this up 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:58.020
 this edge and follow the whole 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.020
 think 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:09.160
 either occurs and now the two 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.400
 knew from right and left in the 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.810
 middle push together and the whole 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:17.280
 move together to such a 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.280
 inserted triangle 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:27.050
 then we switch the two tips off 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:31.040
 down to the middle but upwards 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:34.900
 only the front ones right on the left 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:38.510
 Fold page up to this point 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:41.840
 that is the whole thing on the whole thing 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:48.530
 back side now turn up this edge 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:51.880
 to fold the middle and the same one too 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.880
 with the edge from the other side 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.320
 now I'm against the normal 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.000
 laws, we also take the means 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:04.500
 could now also be the new outside 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.500
 put on the edges 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.690
 but it looks like this when we are 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.960
 the whole back on the back sees 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:31.240
 quite so and the two tips of 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:31.240
 outside, we now hold on to the medium 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:48.739
 arises then take this woman now 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.540
 we created this square or 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:53.030
 this rauter as an aid 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:56.829
 because hawk exactly over the midline 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.829
 We now move our legs forward 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:02.180
 that it will look that way and in the half 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:10.489
 Let's fold it back 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:12.109
 Turn it all over now is the 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:14.120
 frog already so deep now have 

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:16.909
 we only have the fore-legs down 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:19.970
 Fold a bit right pluck 

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:22.310
 and done is our origami luck 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:24.980
 a lot of joy while imitating and 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:27.310
 until next time at mister tip 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.310
 ticker
