00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.660
 one of the common deaths in pets 

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:09.170
 is caused by home poisoning 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:11.930
 as in the case of the anti frizz if 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:14.450
 There is a great variety of poisons that 

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:16.490
 we have to the house there are poisons for 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:18.140
 example chose antifreeze from the 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:19.310
 vehicles when freezing the 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.320
 vehicles are made on the basis of 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.480
 solution be metal in glycol plate 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.760
 hellenic what normally has a 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:28.670
 slightly sweet taste when 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:30.770
 there are cars with certain 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:32.659
 damage to the radiator and that 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:34.730
 start to throw water water 

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:37.789
 antifreeze the dog arrives and what 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:41.870
 it starts to lick and it enters and this guy 

00:00:37.789 --> 00:00:44.479
 of chemical cause renal deficiency causes 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.629
 obstruction of the renal glomeruli or 

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:49.039
 is what gives us a kidney deficiency 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:50.899
 quite severe and sometimes hepatic 

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:53.059
 the big problem with that kind of poisons 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:56.479
 is that sometimes it will come with its type and not 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:58.069
 we know his history, that is, he could have 

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:59.359
 past three months and the problems 

00:00:58.069 --> 00:01:01.070
 Kidneys appear up to three o'clock 

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:03.590
 four months later 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.900
 one of the disadvantages of this poison is 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:08.780
 which is slow and may take up to three 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:11.360
 months to present itself is damage as in the 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.220
 case of the next patient prognosis 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.320
 this puppy what is the good prognosis 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.210
 of passage actually makes almost two 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:21.140
 months and a half that entered the 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:22.820
 antifreeze and the mental methods that 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.530
 remove a kidney because the owner of it 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.170
 was affected we have to make a 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.759
 kidney recession and fortunately the 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.680
 little ones are not affected and the animal 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:33.140
 with a fortune that survived the 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:37.009
 poisoning warning symptoms 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:38.600
 they are nauseous absence of urine and appetite 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:40.369
 well then immediately take them with 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.560
 the catenary doctor and apply therapies 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:44.630
 fluids that what we do we apply 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.340
 directly the intravenous fluid for 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.280
 try to wash that kidneys try to 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:52.340
 that they expel in the shortest possible time 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.960
 time can have good results 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.820
 the faster the better all the 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.670
 poisons all landlords or 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:00.619
 rodenticide insecticides the more 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.210
 Quickly the poison is eliminated better 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:04.039
 prognosis in the patient 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.619
 take care of our pets at the moment 

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:07.700
 to feed them and monitor the environment

 That surrounds them 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:12.800
 guarantees to avoid the possibility of a 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:16.810
