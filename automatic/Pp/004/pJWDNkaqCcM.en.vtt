i've got 12 1 meter of talented actress
plugged<00:00:16.800> into<00:00:16.980> the<00:00:17.190> step<00:00:17.400> 13<00:00:17.789> and<00:00:18.060> I've<00:00:18.270> got

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
plugged into the step 13 and I've got

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.019 
plugged into the step 13 and I've got
little<00:00:18.830> one-inch<00:00:19.830> pieces<00:00:20.130> of<00:00:20.340> visco<00:00:20.699> fuse

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
little one-inch pieces of visco fuse

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.090 
little one-inch pieces of visco fuse
mounted<00:00:21.869> in<00:00:21.960> a<00:00:22.050> block<00:00:22.260> of<00:00:22.289> wood<00:00:22.470> that<00:00:22.859> you<00:00:22.949> can

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
mounted in a block of wood that you can

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.050 
mounted in a block of wood that you can
see<00:00:23.220> just<00:00:23.460> at<00:00:23.580> the<00:00:23.640> top<00:00:23.789> of<00:00:23.850> the<00:00:24.000> screen<00:00:24.240> there

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:26.060 
see just at the top of the screen there

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.500 
see just at the top of the screen there
okay<00:00:27.060> so<00:00:27.119> if<00:00:27.750> I<00:00:27.869> just<00:00:28.140> open<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.590> unit<00:00:29.390> you<00:00:30.390> can

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
okay so if I just open the unit you can

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.269 
okay so if I just open the unit you can
see<00:00:30.630> we've<00:00:30.900> got<00:00:30.929> all<00:00:31.320> of<00:00:31.349> the<00:00:31.560> keys<00:00:31.769> connected

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
see we've got all of the keys connected

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.639 
see we've got all of the keys connected
in<00:00:32.540> and<00:00:33.540> I'm<00:00:33.630> just<00:00:33.660> going<00:00:33.840> to<00:00:34.020> turn<00:00:34.350> it<00:00:34.500> on

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
in and I'm just going to turn it on

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.229 
in and I'm just going to turn it on
you're<00:00:35.520> going<00:00:35.670> to<00:00:35.730> see<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:35.940> batch<00:00:36.090> of

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
you're going to see the batch of

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.119 
you're going to see the batch of
voltages<00:00:36.600> at<00:00:36.719> 100%<00:00:37.050> it's<00:00:37.770> going<00:00:37.950> to<00:00:38.010> run

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
voltages at 100% it's going to run

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.580 
voltages at 100% it's going to run
through<00:00:38.160> self-test<00:00:38.790> which<00:00:39.030> is<00:00:39.149> fine<00:00:39.500> so<00:00:40.500> the

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
through self-test which is fine so the

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:41.930 
through self-test which is fine so the
first<00:00:40.770> thing<00:00:40.950> we<00:00:41.040> want<00:00:41.190> to<00:00:41.250> do<00:00:41.460> is<00:00:41.610> connect

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
first thing we want to do is connect

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.240 
first thing we want to do is connect
that<00:00:42.120> all<00:00:42.329> of<00:00:42.480> the<00:00:42.629> talent<00:00:43.230> and<00:00:43.620> nighters<00:00:44.010> are

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
that all of the talent and nighters are

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.619 
that all of the talent and nighters are
connected<00:00:44.760> correctly<00:00:44.879> and<00:00:45.329> they've<00:00:45.420> got<00:00:45.539> good

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
connected correctly and they've got good

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.650 
connected correctly and they've got good
continuity<00:00:46.280> so<00:00:47.280> what<00:00:48.059> I'm<00:00:48.120> going<00:00:48.239> to<00:00:48.300> do<00:00:48.450> here

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
continuity so what I'm going to do here

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.119 
continuity so what I'm going to do here
is<00:00:48.930> I'm<00:00:49.289> just<00:00:49.320> going<00:00:49.559> to<00:00:49.590> press<00:00:49.770> and<00:00:49.920> hold<00:00:50.039> the

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
is I'm just going to press and hold the

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.889 
is I'm just going to press and hold the
test<00:00:50.340> button<00:00:50.550> and<00:00:51.360> you're<00:00:51.480> going<00:00:51.600> to<00:00:51.660> hear<00:00:51.870> a

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
test button and you're going to hear a

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.689 
test button and you're going to hear a
beep<00:00:52.230> because<00:00:52.620> we've<00:00:52.770> got<00:00:52.890> Beauty<00:00:53.160> continuity

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
beep because we've got Beauty continuity

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.049 
beep because we've got Beauty continuity
on<00:00:53.850> all<00:00:53.969> 12<00:00:54.270> keys<00:00:55.489> so<00:00:56.489> you<00:00:56.550> can<00:00:56.610> see<00:00:56.789> that's<00:00:56.910> a

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
on all 12 keys so you can see that's a

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.490 
on all 12 keys so you can see that's a
solid<00:00:57.360> beep<00:00:57.539> for<00:00:57.750> as<00:00:57.840> long<00:00:57.989> as<00:00:58.140> I<00:00:58.199> hold<00:00:58.350> down

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
solid beep for as long as I hold down

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.889 
solid beep for as long as I hold down
the<00:00:58.649> test<00:00:58.829> button<00:00:59.390> and<00:01:00.390> you<00:01:00.449> can<00:01:00.570> see<00:01:00.660> that<00:01:00.809> all

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
the test button and you can see that all

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.930 
the test button and you can see that all
12<00:01:01.230> cues<00:01:01.559> we<00:01:02.370> can<00:01:02.520> see<00:01:02.640> there's<00:01:02.820> good

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
12 cues we can see there's good

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.810 
12 cues we can see there's good
continuity<00:01:03.539> there<00:01:03.719> by<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:05.100> blocks<00:01:05.549> on<00:01:05.729> the

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
continuity there by the blocks on the

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.910 
continuity there by the blocks on the
screen<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.840> X<00:01:06.990> here<00:01:07.290> just<00:01:07.530> means<00:01:07.650> we<00:01:07.799> put

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
screen the X here just means we put

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.550 
screen the X here just means we put
nothing<00:01:08.220> connected<00:01:08.640> to<00:01:08.729> Q<00:01:08.909> 13<00:01:11.030> so<00:01:12.030> I<00:01:12.930> think<00:01:13.380> I'm

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
nothing connected to Q 13 so I think I'm

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.490 
nothing connected to Q 13 so I think I'm
going<00:01:13.710> to<00:01:13.770> set<00:01:13.950> this<00:01:14.070> up<00:01:14.220> with<00:01:15.110> just<00:01:16.110> an<00:01:16.200> equal

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
going to set this up with just an equal

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.390 
going to set this up with just an equal
time<00:01:16.710> delay<00:01:16.979> between<00:01:17.220> each<00:01:17.729> Q<00:01:18.409> and<00:01:19.409> we<00:01:19.560> can<00:01:19.950> set

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
time delay between each Q and we can set

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:26.330 
time delay between each Q and we can set
that<00:01:20.549> perhaps<00:01:20.850> to<00:01:21.860> one<00:01:22.860> second<00:01:23.280> I<00:01:25.070> set<00:01:26.070> that<00:01:26.189> in

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
that perhaps to one second I set that in

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.550 
that perhaps to one second I set that in
there<00:01:26.720> and<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.840> other<00:01:27.869> thing<00:01:28.200> that<00:01:28.229> we<00:01:28.409> might

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
there and the other thing that we might

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:29.840 
there and the other thing that we might
want<00:01:28.619> to<00:01:28.829> do<00:01:28.979> because<00:01:29.159> we're<00:01:29.430> using<00:01:29.549> Tower

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
want to do because we're using Tower

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.660 
want to do because we're using Tower
igniters<00:01:30.450> is<00:01:30.659> adjust<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.170> pulse<00:01:31.380> time<00:01:31.710> from

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
igniters is adjust the pulse time from

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.609 
igniters is adjust the pulse time from
0.2<00:01:33.299> seconds<00:01:33.689> which<00:01:34.140> you<00:01:34.229> would<00:01:34.350> use<00:01:34.380> pretty

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
0.2 seconds which you would use pretty

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.160 
0.2 seconds which you would use pretty
matches<00:01:35.070> to<00:01:35.729> 2<00:01:35.909> seconds<00:01:36.299> long<00:01:36.479> for<00:01:36.869> Talon

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
matches to 2 seconds long for Talon

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.890 
matches to 2 seconds long for Talon
igniters<00:01:37.619> so<00:01:38.369> this<00:01:38.520> means<00:01:38.759> that<00:01:38.880> each<00:01:39.299> Q<00:01:39.689> is

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
igniters so this means that each Q is

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.240 
igniters so this means that each Q is
actually<00:01:40.170> going<00:01:40.259> to<00:01:40.350> turn<00:01:40.530> on<00:01:40.740> when<00:01:40.920> it<00:01:41.040> fires

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
actually going to turn on when it fires

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.160 
actually going to turn on when it fires
for<00:01:41.640> two<00:01:41.790> seconds<00:01:42.210> and<00:01:42.420> this<00:01:42.840> gives<00:01:43.049> the

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
for two seconds and this gives the

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.630 
for two seconds and this gives the
talons<00:01:43.560> enough<00:01:43.770> time<00:01:43.979> to<00:01:44.189> heat<00:01:44.340> up<00:01:44.460> and

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
talons enough time to heat up and

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.660 
talons enough time to heat up and
actually<00:01:44.790> ignite<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.270> fuse<00:01:46.399> so<00:01:47.399> if<00:01:47.460> we<00:01:47.549> go

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
actually ignite the fuse so if we go

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:48.950 
actually ignite the fuse so if we go
back<00:01:47.700> it's<00:01:47.909> equal<00:01:48.180> time<00:01:48.390> mode<00:01:48.600> you<00:01:48.750> can<00:01:48.869> see

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
back it's equal time mode you can see

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.420 
back it's equal time mode you can see
our<00:01:49.079> time<00:01:49.290> delay<00:01:49.530> is<00:01:49.649> still<00:01:49.890> locked<00:01:50.100> in<00:01:50.280> there

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
our time delay is still locked in there

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.539 
our time delay is still locked in there
and<00:01:50.810> if<00:01:51.810> I<00:01:51.930> wanted<00:01:52.170> to<00:01:52.229> run<00:01:52.799> and<00:01:53.009> just<00:01:53.130> simulate

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
and if I wanted to run and just simulate

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:54.889 
and if I wanted to run and just simulate
the<00:01:53.670> sequence<00:01:54.030> so<00:01:54.210> just<00:01:54.420> press<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:54.720> Run

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
the sequence so just press the Run

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.499 
the sequence so just press the Run
button<00:01:55.820> hopefully<00:01:56.820> you<00:01:56.939> can<00:01:57.060> see<00:01:57.299> they're

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
button hopefully you can see they're

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.450 
button hopefully you can see they're
just<00:01:59.000> running<00:02:00.000> through<00:02:00.119> each<00:02:00.270> Q<00:02:01.340> firing<00:02:02.340> it

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
just running through each Q firing it

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.550 
just running through each Q firing it
with<00:02:02.610> a<00:02:02.640> one<00:02:02.820> second<00:02:03.180> interval<00:02:06.320> I'll<00:02:07.320> just<00:02:07.439> let

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
with a one second interval I'll just let

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.880 
with a one second interval I'll just let
that<00:02:07.619> finish<00:02:07.979> off<00:02:08.129> right

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
that finish off right

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:11.290 
that finish off right
so<00:02:10.250> obviously<00:02:10.520> we<00:02:10.670> actually<00:02:10.970> want<00:02:11.090> to<00:02:11.210> go

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
so obviously we actually want to go

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.930 
so obviously we actually want to go
ahead<00:02:11.420> and<00:02:11.720> fire<00:02:12.350> the<00:02:12.500> Q's<00:02:12.740> now<00:02:13.520> you<00:02:13.760> could

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
ahead and fire the Q's now you could

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:15.160 
ahead and fire the Q's now you could
just<00:02:13.970> give<00:02:14.240> it<00:02:14.330> a<00:02:14.420> voltage<00:02:14.720> into<00:02:15.020> the

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
just give it a voltage into the

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:16.840 
just give it a voltage into the
triggering<00:02:15.650> food<00:02:15.800> terminals<00:02:16.250> here<00:02:16.460> and<00:02:16.670> that

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
triggering food terminals here and that

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:18.190 
triggering food terminals here and that
would<00:02:16.970> start<00:02:17.150> the<00:02:17.330> sequencer<00:02:17.750> going<00:02:18.020> once

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
would start the sequencer going once

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.260 
would start the sequencer going once
it's<00:02:18.350> been<00:02:18.470> armed<00:02:18.800> so<00:02:19.520> this<00:02:19.670> would<00:02:19.820> come<00:02:19.970> from

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
it's been armed so this would come from

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.000 
it's been armed so this would come from
your<00:02:20.450> existing<00:02:20.660> firing<00:02:21.170> system<00:02:21.500> or<00:02:21.680> just<00:02:21.920> a

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
your existing firing system or just a

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:23.860 
your existing firing system or just a
battery<00:02:22.190> on<00:02:22.490> the<00:02:22.550> length<00:02:22.700> of<00:02:22.850> wire<00:02:23.030> but

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
battery on the length of wire but

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.240 
battery on the length of wire but
there's<00:02:24.020> also<00:02:24.140> a<00:02:24.260> manual<00:02:24.680> override<00:02:24.920> function

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
there's also a manual override function

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
there's also a manual override function
as<00:02:25.550> well<00:02:25.700> so<00:02:26.000> if<00:02:26.120> I<00:02:26.210> hold<00:02:26.540> down<00:02:26.840> the<00:02:26.990> arm<00:02:27.140> button

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
as well so if I hold down the arm button

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:31.960 
as well so if I hold down the arm button
and<00:02:29.320> then<00:02:30.320> press<00:02:30.530> the<00:02:30.680> Run<00:02:30.890> button<00:02:30.920> that<00:02:31.850> will

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
and then press the Run button that will

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:33.550 
and then press the Run button that will
actually<00:02:32.120> simulate<00:02:32.780> a<00:02:32.870> trigger<00:02:33.140> input<00:02:33.410> pulse

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
actually simulate a trigger input pulse

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.300 
actually simulate a trigger input pulse
and<00:02:33.830> actually<00:02:34.580> fire<00:02:34.760> the<00:02:34.790> keys<00:02:35.890> so<00:02:36.890> I'm<00:02:37.190> just

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
and actually fire the keys so I'm just

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:38.410 
and actually fire the keys so I'm just
going<00:02:37.430> to<00:02:37.490> adjust<00:02:37.790> the<00:02:37.850> camera<00:02:38.000> onto<00:02:38.240> the

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:38.420 
going to adjust the camera onto the

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:44.610 
going to adjust the camera onto the
igniters<00:02:38.810> and<00:02:39.230> we'll<00:02:39.500> go<00:02:39.590> ahead<00:02:39.710> and<00:02:39.830> do<00:02:40.010> that

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.020 

okay<00:02:45.620> so<00:02:45.680> i've<00:02:46.010> just<00:02:46.070> adjusted<00:02:46.340> the<00:02:46.700> cameras

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
okay so i've just adjusted the cameras

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.840 
okay so i've just adjusted the cameras
on<00:02:47.150> to<00:02:47.240> the<00:02:47.330> igniters<00:02:47.810> and<00:02:48.310> I'll<00:02:49.310> go<00:02:49.490> ahead<00:02:49.610> and

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
on to the igniters and I'll go ahead and

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.480 
on to the igniters and I'll go ahead and
hold<00:02:50.000> down<00:02:50.060> the<00:02:50.270> arm<00:02:50.420> button<00:02:51.190> and<00:02:52.190> I'll<00:02:52.310> press

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:52.490 
hold down the arm button and I'll press

00:02:52.490 --> 00:03:10.540 
hold down the arm button and I'll press
the<00:02:52.610> wrong<00:02:52.730> button<00:02:52.790> in<00:02:53.270> three<00:02:53.540> two<00:02:53.990> one

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:10.550 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:12.650 

you<00:03:11.550> can<00:03:11.730> see<00:03:11.880> there<00:03:12.060> that<00:03:12.270> was<00:03:12.630> very

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
you can see there that was very

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.140 
you can see there that was very
successful
