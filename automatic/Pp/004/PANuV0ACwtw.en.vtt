we<00:00:04.470> use<00:00:04.500> them<00:00:04.859> in<00:00:04.980> shuffles<00:00:05.600> not<00:00:06.600> that<00:00:06.690> you

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
we use them in shuffles not that you

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:08.419 
we use them in shuffles not that you
can't<00:00:06.960> use<00:00:07.230> them<00:00:07.410> when<00:00:07.529> you're<00:00:07.620> playing<00:00:07.830> a<00:00:08.010> 8th

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
can't use them when you're playing a 8th

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:10.970 
can't use them when you're playing a 8th
note<00:00:08.730> or<00:00:08.940> 16th<00:00:09.360> note<00:00:09.510> base<00:00:09.719> pattern<00:00:10.050> but<00:00:10.860> I'm

we<00:00:11.340> do<00:00:11.460> use<00:00:11.639> them<00:00:11.790> in<00:00:11.880> shuffles<00:00:12.799> remember<00:00:13.799> the

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
we do use them in shuffles remember the

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.790 
we do use them in shuffles remember the
shuffle<00:00:14.250> is<00:00:14.309> based<00:00:14.519> on<00:00:14.639> triplets<00:00:15.089> one<00:00:15.330> and

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:15.800 
shuffle is based on triplets one and

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:30.519 
shuffle is based on triplets one and
three<00:00:19.699> so<00:00:20.699> if<00:00:20.760> you<00:00:20.820> play<00:00:21.029> eighth<00:00:21.240> notes<00:00:21.570> or<00:00:21.720> 16

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:30.529 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:32.659 

not<00:00:31.529> that<00:00:31.619> it<00:00:31.740> doesn't<00:00:32.009> work<00:00:32.160> just<00:00:32.189> sounds<00:00:32.640> a

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
not that it doesn't work just sounds a

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:33.950 
not that it doesn't work just sounds a
bit<00:00:32.730> out<00:00:32.850> of<00:00:32.880> place<00:00:33.090> and<00:00:33.390> that<00:00:33.450> can<00:00:33.719> work<00:00:33.899> for

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
bit out of place and that can work for

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.080 
bit out of place and that can work for
you<00:00:34.200> at<00:00:34.380> time<00:00:34.559> but<00:00:34.800> generally<00:00:35.520> we<00:00:35.790> play

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
you at time but generally we play

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.380 
you at time but generally we play
triplets<00:00:36.899> when<00:00:37.140> we're<00:00:37.290> doing<00:00:38.390> shuffle

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
triplets when we're doing shuffle

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:49.209 
triplets when we're doing shuffle
grooves<00:00:39.660> a<00:00:39.989> triplet<00:00:40.980> is<00:00:41.040> a<00:00:41.100> grouping<00:00:41.399> a<00:00:41.489> three

00:00:49.209 --> 00:00:49.219 

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:52.670 

okay<00:00:50.219> and<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.910> most<00:00:51.170> basic<00:00:52.170> feel<00:00:52.379> you<00:00:52.500> need<00:00:52.649> to

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
okay and the most basic feel you need to

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:59.420 
okay and the most basic feel you need to
learn<00:00:52.920> is<00:00:53.129> to<00:00:53.160> do<00:00:53.340> three<00:00:53.730> hits<00:00:54.000> per<00:00:54.750> drum<00:00:58.430> the

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
learn is to do three hits per drum the

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.770 
learn is to do three hits per drum the
challenge<00:00:59.879> with<00:01:00.030> this<00:01:00.149> is<00:01:00.390> since<00:01:00.600> it's<00:01:00.719> a

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
challenge with this is since it's a

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.090 
challenge with this is since it's a
grouping<00:01:01.020> of<00:01:01.140> three<00:01:01.199> his<00:01:01.590> sticking<00:01:01.890> is<00:01:01.949> going

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
grouping of three his sticking is going

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.529 
grouping of three his sticking is going
to<00:01:02.160> feel<00:01:02.280> like<00:01:02.309> it's<00:01:02.550> changing<00:01:03.000> if<00:01:03.180> no<00:01:03.420> you're

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
to feel like it's changing if no you're

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:04.579 
to feel like it's changing if no you're
just<00:01:03.570> going<00:01:03.809> to<00:01:03.870> right<00:01:04.080> left<00:01:04.320> right<00:01:04.530> left

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
just going to right left right left

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.710 
just going to right left right left
right<00:01:04.949> left<00:01:05.010> it<00:01:05.339> feels<00:01:05.580> a<00:01:05.700> bit<00:01:05.729> strange<00:01:05.850> first

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
right left it feels a bit strange first

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.250

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 
which works really well her place so you

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.719 
which works really well her place so you
just<00:01:38.020> got<00:01:38.110> to<00:01:38.170> practice<00:01:38.350> doing<00:01:38.800> that<00:01:38.830> now<00:01:39.550> if

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:39.729 
just got to practice doing that now if

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:41.340 
just got to practice doing that now if
you<00:01:39.850> start<00:01:40.180> triplets<00:01:40.810> on<00:01:40.930> the<00:01:41.020> count<00:01:41.200> of<00:01:41.290> one

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
you start triplets on the count of one

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.080 
you start triplets on the count of one
and<00:01:41.800> you<00:01:41.920> starting<00:01:42.280> with<00:01:42.310> your<00:01:42.460> right<00:01:42.490> hand<00:01:42.700> it

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:51.160 
the count of two you actually have to

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:52.560 
the count of two you actually have to
start<00:01:51.399> the<00:01:51.520> fill<00:01:51.729> on<00:01:51.850> your<00:01:52.000> left<00:01:52.179> hand<00:01:52.270> you

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570 
start the fill on your left hand you

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.930 
start the fill on your left hand you
don't<00:01:52.720> have<00:01:52.899> to<00:01:53.050> but<00:01:53.170> it's<00:01:53.289> advisable

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:56.940 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:02.180
