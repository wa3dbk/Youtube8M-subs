00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:07.440
 a greeting to all and welcome e 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:12.000
 welcome back together again this time 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:15.179
 not for gameplay but for a 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.340
 tutorial a very short guide on how 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.930
 broadcast live via the 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.910
 service offered free by 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.180
 microsoft and we are talking of course 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.800
 of tweets the console is the last one 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.490
 generation don't tell you the name I'm here 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:32.700
 nor part ii kinect and therefore immediately 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.590
 casinos therefore substantially then i 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.870
 ways to reach the application 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.180
 twitch and there are two in essence one is 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.800
 the one through the vocal commands that 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.270
 we'll see later while the other and leave 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.930
 to recover in my games and 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:50.010
 app and here at the beginning 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.390
 here it is, you move to app and suap 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.550
 found 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.469
 among other things here are still if 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.320
 you don't have it, instead you have to download it 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:02.280
 sailing this will be the main screen 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:05.369
 you will need to log in and go 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:08.900
 then insert a code via web that 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.820
 then it will associate your twitch channel 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.920
 obviously you need to have an account 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:16.229
 valid and open on trici to be able to 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:22.020
 do this and associate it 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:23.939
 precisely to your xbox one account 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.189
 here is the name of his part not for 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:29.009
 luck did n't take it so badly like 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.900
 see we are right here is among the various 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.700
 options there is also what he says 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:36.420
 therefore transmit therefore not e 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.670
 we click on it as you will see 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.049
 here obviously now he tells me he must 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.200
 there is an open game to be able to 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:46.229
 transmit and obviously opens in short 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.509
 next to it the relative part 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.759
 to the twitch application and remember 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.770
 which will be there for the duration of the 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:55.590
 video so if you want if it were in 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.579
 this moment you see we act on the part 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.590
 right then on the part 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.630
 application to return to the other 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.149
 part click chelsea dunks two 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.490
 times the xbox symbol on the 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.350
 controller and then returns 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.580
 on the other side 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:13.020
 back to the home 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:15.180
 and the other way instead is at this point 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.430
 in short, we must necessarily start 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.780
 a game otherwise we fail then to 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:23.130
 see everything else 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:29.550
 now it's okay we do that 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:31.830
 take xbox off perfect now now 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.910
 you see we do this immediately 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.560
 here 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.830
 so while you are playing then 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:40.350
 you are beautiful here if you spend the night 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.390
 let me born with any game 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:47.010
 obviously supported by the platform 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:52.190
 twitch and you at any time 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:52.190
 you can simply tell xbox send 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:03:04.580
 xbox broadcast and suddenly 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:04.580
 you will be catapulted into 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:11.700
 twitch application then to this 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:13.230
 so now we are back 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.750
 precisely on the relative part 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.670
 to the application and as you see we have 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:20.010
 the preview of the broadcast that 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.600
 change according to your signal is the 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:26.010
 title of the transmission we can 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:28.590
 obviously going to change this 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.840
 for me, here is the title I have 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.330
 last used on the one 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:36.269
 transmission in short that I did for the 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:39.180
 moment I believe that given the connection 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:41.600
 that we have available in Italy for 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.980
 we Italians will be very very difficult 

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:46.370
 being able to transmit unless 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.370
 we have 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:51.780
 we have no business connections then 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:54.510
 here we do for example try it out 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:56.340
 then game to be transmitted up to 14 lo 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:59.489
 locate him directly and go upstairs 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:01.709
 settings where we have again 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:03.810
 preview the visual of the visual 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:05.700
 we can decide whether to activate or 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.500
 disable the kinect and in which corner 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.220
 go and position it during the 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:13.010
 reproduction 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:16.350
 if activate the microphone the microphone of 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:18.479
 of kinect is the volume of the 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:20.549
 microphone itself once you've chosen everything 

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:23.280
 come back with b 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:25.639
 and we can safely start 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:28.919
 broadcast at that point you will be 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:31.229
 obviously online the first time 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:33.620
 you will do this type of operation will do a 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:37.470
 check your speed 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:40.080
 of your gang but wanting not me 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:41.669
 I remember where, but it can also be found 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:45.659
 here below title transmission 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:47.819
 quality you can also go to change e 

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:50.129
 while it also submits the url then 

00:04:47.819 --> 00:04:52.110
 the address of the tweet channel on which 

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:54.030
 transmission takes place in 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:55.830
 when it is started 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:57.690
 so guys with this 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:00.060
 basically everything I hope to be 

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:01.169
 been clear enough not not 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:04.199
 lot 

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:06.180
