00:00:00.849 --> 00:00:04.180
 on this 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.830
 but only now had to present the lowest price 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:14.889
 it is not what one might call a portable cell phone 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.409
 but has since compensated the company 

00:00:18.409 --> 00:00:22.179
 with features that go far beyond what you would expect from a regular cell phone 

00:00:22.749 --> 00:00:27.749
 to begin with the r9 3 comes equipped with a lens causes more 

00:00:27.749 --> 00:00:31.109
 protected by this pandemic to remove the device 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.530
 with 3 points 2 megapixel resolution reflects quite powerful 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:40.399
 for the cell phone with the r29 3 with six bright spot measurements 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:42.980
 the phone is flipped 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.070
 but its opening it the great differential of having distracted with the 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.820
 rotating mechanism 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.870
 This feature allows the mobile phone to interpret the function you 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:57.650
 want to use according to the positioning of the display operating in the 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:01.490
 traditional position and triggered middle of phone shortcuts 

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:04.269
 I'm learning with the display turned on the side 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:08.270
 it sounds the camera because an hour that incidentally in that position 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:13.220
 provides a good grip for filming that later 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:16.080
 can be assisted in the lateral- 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.250
 by speaking in video the r9 three films of 30 frames per second with resolution 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.520
 640 by 480 pixels 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:29.260
 this means that it kept normal that is not high resolution you 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:33.480
 you can watch images that are the same as your open TV program with the 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:34.840
 local 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.680
 The ior 3 also have mp3 player that worked like the headphones of the 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.550
 own nokia which is a shame as its entrance the owner did not 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:49.260
 allows the use of other points and the priest sources that accompanies the product is very 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.310
 great for those who have small invitations 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:57.870
 all images and music stored on the receive memory card of 512 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.300
 megabytes that comes with your phone 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.910
 in its memory can be extended until June giga bytes as other factors 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:10.520
 another cool thing is that with a 2 5 4 inch display and with the program 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:17.160
 because it did it possible to open files of love excel power point pdf with the theme 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.549
 quality 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:23.229
 You better make your own conclusions, I understand that this 

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:25.079
 device is capable 

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:29.680
