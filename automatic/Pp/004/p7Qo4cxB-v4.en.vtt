 install an ssd in your laptop 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.139
 in this case we use the samsung ssd 

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:11.670
 850 evo 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.740
 These are the accessories that are 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.570
 included in the box 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.660
 a usb cable to keep your files safe 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.880
 to transfer and write to the ssd 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.000
 to fit a cd rom with the 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.460
 required software and and sst 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.200
 an ssd makes your computer much faster 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.660
 then boot a regular hard drive 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.790
 if we for the installation of the ssd 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.930
 Windows boot takes longer than 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.030
 two minutes 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.470
 to stay indoors you have to 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.450
 first your files and you 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:42.430
 transfer the operating system to the 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:43.780
 new ssd 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:46.239
 that is possible with the software that is 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.340
 included on this CD-ROM 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:50.320
 follow the instructions on the screen 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.000
 you don't have a cd-rom player then you can 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.110
 the right one on the samsung site 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.030
 find software 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:57.480
 connect the ssd to the supplied 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.480
 USB cable 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:03.879
 then plug the usb into the usb port 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:06.009
 follow the instructions to your files and 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:07.479
 transfer your operating system to 

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:10.479
 your ssd 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:12.310
 this process can take a while 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:15.159
 when it's done you can start with it 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.930
 install the ssd in your computer 

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:19.720
 make sure your laptop is not running on power 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.369
 is connected and remove your battery 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.799
 you do not have to open the entire laptop 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:25.420
 screws to install the ssd 

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:27.039
 You just need the panel where the SSD 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.409
 the back is unscrewing 

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:30.789
 This panel looks with every laptop 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:33.600
 differently 

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:35.580
 so pay attention to which you are loosening 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.270
 loosen the screws on the panel 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.270
 with a screwdriver 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.350
 this is the inside of the laptop turn 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:45.540
 the screws of the hard disk and 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.490
 then pull out the writer 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.590
 You can see here that the connections of the 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.650
 hard drive and your new ssd 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:55.020
 be exactly the same that means 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.729
 you can change them so easily 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.670
 over the hard drive and protect 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:02.369
 frame screw that first release you can do it 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.890
 then screw it back on the ssd 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.600
 the ssd is thinner than the hard drive 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.240
 That is why Samsung also supplies this plastic 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.489
 put yourself along so that the ssd on the same 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:13.530
 height can be connected as the 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:15.360
 old hard drive 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.550
 tighten all screws again 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.440
 and put the panel back 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.060
 the new ssd is now in your laptop 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.459
 installed 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.680
 as you can see, your new ssd takes care of it 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:28.110
 that your computer starts up much faster than 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.540
 assembly works first in a computer 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:33.239
 slightly different from a ssd 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.850
 make sure just like with the laptop before you 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:38.459
 the power of your computer keeps the hard 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:40.530
 disk is stuck with two cables 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:43.340
 disconnect the two cables and hold the 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:45.830
 hard disk from the computer 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.930
 now connect the cables to your new sst 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:50.209
 and place it where you are hard 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.459
 disk was allowed to install you 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:54.830
 If you don't succeed in using SSD in one go , you must 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:56.209
 change the order of your bios go to 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:56.810
 the link in the description of this 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:58.640
 video 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.970
 to find out exactly how you do that 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.970
 is doing
