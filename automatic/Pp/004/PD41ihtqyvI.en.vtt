00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:18.030
 as much as possible 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:32.200
 My name is Andrew Nekrasov provide 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:36.920
 left turn should be 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:38.960
 or gas on a taxi Moscow why 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.729
 the presidentâ€™s motorcade you allowed 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.149
 actually there in violation 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:44.750
 sign 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:45.789
 I show hardly the reason for this 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.130
 sensuality 

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:52.280
 me in a second as soon as the motorcade passed 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:54.110
 you immediately got into your car that is 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.000
 you went out specifically for the tuple 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.549
 received 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.720
 I ensured his flight let's again 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:02.420
 provided communism 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.789
 that is, you went out specifically for 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:08.910
 President Volkov on special I 

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:11.480
 I will explain why 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.480
 Today 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.420
 but I do not understand that there are cars got up 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:21.260
 in order to 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:24.690
 our president turned on expert signals 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:27.720
 violation of the sign that he now hangs 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:31.410
 do you have any instruction what are you 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.750
 must at this particular time here shows 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:36.620
 that the tuple of the president must go 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:42.620
 actually speaking in violation of the rules 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:42.620
 it's not interesting just the solution
