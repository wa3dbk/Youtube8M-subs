through<00:01:53.570> the<00:01:53.750> other<00:01:53.840> side<00:01:54.080> and<00:01:54.380> then<00:01:54.470> sort<00:01:54.680> of

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
through the other side and then sort of

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:55.840 
through the other side and then sort of
pull<00:01:55.580> it

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
pull it

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:57.250 
pull it
so<00:01:56.090> it's<00:01:56.300> pulled<00:01:56.570> out<00:01:56.750> the<00:01:56.870> other<00:01:57.020> side<00:01:57.170> of

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:57.260 
so it's pulled out the other side of

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.710 
so it's pulled out the other side of
that<00:01:57.350> dread<00:01:57.530> now<00:01:57.680> if<00:01:58.130> I'm<00:01:58.400> really<00:01:58.640> lucky<00:01:58.850> some

00:01:59.710 --> 00:01:59.720 
that dread now if I'm really lucky some

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.270 
that dread now if I'm really lucky some
of<00:01:59.840> that<00:01:59.930> loose<00:02:00.140> hair<00:02:00.409> will<00:02:00.650> stay<00:02:01.010> stuck

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
of that loose hair will stay stuck

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.670 
of that loose hair will stay stuck
inside<00:02:01.460> that<00:02:01.790> dread<00:02:02.000> and<00:02:02.210> so<00:02:02.479> I<00:02:02.510> go<00:02:03.440> through

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 
inside that dread and so I go through

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.530 
inside that dread and so I go through
periods<00:02:03.860> of<00:02:04.280> time<00:02:04.340> where<00:02:04.490> I<00:02:04.670> have<00:02:04.880> no<00:02:05.330> loose

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:05.540 
periods of time where I have no loose

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:07.510 
periods of time where I have no loose
hair<00:02:05.750> here<00:02:05.990> and<00:02:06.350> then<00:02:06.530> eventually<00:02:06.770> bits<00:02:07.310> start

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
hair here and then eventually bits start

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.040 
hair here and then eventually bits start
to<00:02:07.610> build<00:02:07.760> up<00:02:07.850> again<00:02:08.119> this<00:02:08.450> brings<00:02:08.750> me<00:02:08.869> on<00:02:09.019> to

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
to build up again this brings me on to

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.550 
to build up again this brings me on to
the<00:02:09.259> risks<00:02:09.709> of<00:02:09.890> doing<00:02:10.190> dread<00:02:11.180> balling<00:02:11.690> I<00:02:11.930> only

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
the risks of doing dread balling I only

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.890 
the risks of doing dread balling I only
dread<00:02:12.860> ball<00:02:13.069> this<00:02:13.280> one<00:02:13.580> little<00:02:13.940> patch<00:02:14.180> here<00:02:14.599> so

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
dread ball this one little patch here so

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.509 
dread ball this one little patch here so
from<00:02:15.230> the<00:02:15.379> middle<00:02:15.590> of<00:02:15.680> my<00:02:15.799> head<00:02:15.980> across<00:02:16.280> on

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:16.519 
from the middle of my head across on

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:18.640 
from the middle of my head across on
this<00:02:16.670> side<00:02:16.849> and<00:02:17.090> that's<00:02:17.360> because<00:02:17.720> that<00:02:18.260> is<00:02:18.470> the

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
this side and that's because that is the

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
this side and that's because that is the
only<00:02:18.680> place<00:02:19.129> that<00:02:19.310> I<00:02:19.370> would<00:02:19.489> feel<00:02:19.610> comfortable

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
only place that I would feel comfortable

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.030 
only place that I would feel comfortable
doing<00:02:20.360> it<00:02:20.599> when<00:02:21.319> you<00:02:21.409> drink<00:02:21.590> bowling<00:02:21.920> you're

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
doing it when you drink bowling you're

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.619 
doing it when you drink bowling you're
making<00:02:22.430> sort<00:02:22.700> of<00:02:22.730> a<00:02:22.819> lump<00:02:23.030> of<00:02:23.180> hair<00:02:23.390> and<00:02:23.510> then

00:02:23.619 --> 00:02:23.629 
making sort of a lump of hair and then

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:25.000 
making sort of a lump of hair and then
you're<00:02:23.780> pushing<00:02:24.260> it<00:02:24.379> into<00:02:24.560> the<00:02:24.680> root<00:02:24.860> of

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
you're pushing it into the root of

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:26.770 
you're pushing it into the root of
another<00:02:25.220> dread<00:02:25.459> there's<00:02:25.819> obviously<00:02:26.390> a<00:02:26.510> risk

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
another dread there's obviously a risk

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.730 
another dread there's obviously a risk
there<00:02:27.200> that<00:02:27.380> you're<00:02:27.530> going<00:02:27.650> to<00:02:27.770> damage<00:02:28.069> those

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:28.740 
there that you're going to damage those

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:30.830 
there that you're going to damage those
it's<00:02:28.890> because<00:02:29.190> you're<00:02:29.670> pushing<00:02:30.270> something<00:02:30.540> in

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
it's because you're pushing something in

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.330 
it's because you're pushing something in
there<00:02:31.050> this<00:02:31.410> would<00:02:31.560> be<00:02:31.650> really<00:02:31.800> careful<00:02:32.040> with

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
there this would be really careful with

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:33.830 
there this would be really careful with
roots<00:02:32.580> you<00:02:32.730> don't<00:02:32.760> thinning<00:02:33.360> out<00:02:33.450> and<00:02:33.630> stuff

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
roots you don't thinning out and stuff

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.710 
roots you don't thinning out and stuff
so<00:02:34.230> I<00:02:34.530> am<00:02:34.860> kind<00:02:35.370> of<00:02:35.520> okay<00:02:35.940> and<00:02:35.970> happy<00:02:36.300> to<00:02:36.510> do<00:02:36.630> it

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
so I am kind of okay and happy to do it

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.210 
so I am kind of okay and happy to do it
there<00:02:36.870> because<00:02:37.170> you<00:02:37.620> see<00:02:37.830> that<00:02:37.980> the<00:02:38.040> dread

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
there because you see that the dread

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.130 
there because you see that the dread
that<00:02:38.250> I<00:02:38.400> push<00:02:38.610> that<00:02:38.760> into<00:02:39.060> it<00:02:39.330> is<00:02:39.630> actually

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
that I push that into it is actually

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.620 
that I push that into it is actually
this<00:02:40.290> Congo<00:02:40.770> here<00:02:41.040> so<00:02:41.250> that's<00:02:41.460> quite<00:02:42.150> thick

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
this Congo here so that's quite thick

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.320 
this Congo here so that's quite thick
this<00:02:43.290> although<00:02:44.190> it<00:02:44.310> looks<00:02:44.490> like<00:02:44.550> two<00:02:44.850> now<00:02:45.060> at

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
this although it looks like two now at

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:46.760 
this although it looks like two now at
one<00:02:45.540> point<00:02:45.750> was<00:02:45.990> actually<00:02:46.170> three<00:02:46.500> dreads

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
one point was actually three dreads

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.530 
one point was actually three dreads
because<00:02:47.100> this<00:02:47.250> was<00:02:47.430> a<00:02:47.460> Congo<00:02:47.880> here<00:02:48.150> that<00:02:48.360> was

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
because this was a Congo here that was

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.060 
because this was a Congo here that was
two<00:02:48.690> dreads<00:02:48.960> and<00:02:49.140> this<00:02:49.320> is<00:02:49.440> a<00:02:49.470> single<00:02:49.770> dread<00:02:49.920> so

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
two dreads and this is a single dread so

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:51.950 
two dreads and this is a single dread so
there's<00:02:50.580> kind<00:02:50.880> of<00:02:51.000> three<00:02:51.300> dreads<00:02:51.570> worth<00:02:51.780> of

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:51.960 
there's kind of three dreads worth of

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.720 
there's kind of three dreads worth of
root<00:02:52.110> there<00:02:52.410> so<00:02:52.680> there's<00:02:53.160> quite<00:02:53.400> a<00:02:53.430> lot<00:02:53.640> of

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
root there so there's quite a lot of

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.730 
root there so there's quite a lot of
root<00:02:53.880> basically<00:02:54.480> and<00:02:54.660> because<00:02:55.320> there's<00:02:55.530> a

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:55.740 
root basically and because there's a

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:57.710 
root basically and because there's a
wide<00:02:56.070> root<00:02:56.310> it<00:02:56.820> can<00:02:57.000> be<00:02:57.090> quite<00:02:57.240> soft<00:02:57.540> in<00:02:57.660> the

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
wide root it can be quite soft in the

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.050 
wide root it can be quite soft in the
middle<00:02:57.750> and<00:02:58.080> I<00:02:58.140> can<00:02:58.380> happily<00:02:58.890> enough<00:02:59.220> push<00:02:59.820> a

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
middle and I can happily enough push a

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.840 
middle and I can happily enough push a
ball<00:03:00.960> of<00:03:01.170> loose<00:03:01.380> hair<00:03:01.410> there<00:03:01.890> I<00:03:02.100> would<00:03:02.640> not

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
ball of loose hair there I would not

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:05.720 
ball of loose hair there I would not
really<00:03:03.090> be<00:03:03.240> happy<00:03:03.660> doing<00:03:03.840> anywhere<00:03:04.350> else<00:03:04.730> for

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
really be happy doing anywhere else for

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.450 
really be happy doing anywhere else for
one<00:03:05.970> because<00:03:06.600> I<00:03:07.080> wouldn't<00:03:07.710> be<00:03:07.770> able<00:03:07.860> to<00:03:08.040> see

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:08.460 
one because I wouldn't be able to see

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.310 
one because I wouldn't be able to see
where<00:03:08.940> I<00:03:08.970> was<00:03:09.120> pushing<00:03:09.360> it<00:03:09.570> if<00:03:09.810> it's<00:03:09.990> not<00:03:10.140> right

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
where I was pushing it if it's not right

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.430 
where I was pushing it if it's not right
for<00:03:10.380> my<00:03:10.650> face<00:03:10.800> and<00:03:11.090> for<00:03:12.090> two<00:03:12.240> unless<00:03:13.110> there's<00:03:13.380> a

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
for my face and for two unless there's a

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.290 
for my face and for two unless there's a
really<00:03:13.620> wide<00:03:13.950> root<00:03:14.340> I<00:03:14.580> wouldn't<00:03:14.910> really<00:03:15.030> want

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
really wide root I wouldn't really want

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.180 
really wide root I wouldn't really want
to<00:03:15.390> risk<00:03:15.480> damaging<00:03:15.840> the<00:03:16.230> root<00:03:16.470> like<00:03:16.680> that<00:03:16.860> so

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
to risk damaging the root like that so

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.210 
to risk damaging the root like that so
ye<00:03:17.820> be<00:03:18.060> warned<00:03:18.600> if<00:03:18.840> you<00:03:19.050> go<00:03:19.590> down<00:03:19.800> this<00:03:19.980> route

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:01.800 
want Congress you're taking loose hair

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.560 
want Congress you're taking loose hair
from<00:04:02.040> one<00:04:02.220> area<00:04:02.430> and<00:04:02.610> sort<00:04:02.790> of<00:04:02.820> pushing<00:04:03.420> it

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:03.570 
from one area and sort of pushing it

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:05.570 
from one area and sort of pushing it
into<00:04:03.900> maybe<00:04:04.230> it's<00:04:04.500> nearest<00:04:04.800> red<00:04:05.010> but<00:04:05.250> that<00:04:05.280> can

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:05.580 
into maybe it's nearest red but that can

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:08.750 
into maybe it's nearest red but that can
often<00:04:06.060> end<00:04:06.150> up<00:04:06.360> pulling<00:04:06.990> other<00:04:07.590> hairs<00:04:08.160> into<00:04:08.490> it

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
often end up pulling other hairs into it

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.210 
often end up pulling other hairs into it
so<00:04:09.060> I<00:04:09.300> mean<00:04:09.810> it's<00:04:10.170> not<00:04:10.290> a<00:04:10.350> worry<00:04:10.590> here<00:04:10.830> because

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
so I mean it's not a worry here because

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.730 
so I mean it's not a worry here because
they're<00:04:11.730> all<00:04:11.880> con<00:04:12.120> guard<00:04:12.330> up<00:04:12.450> anyway<00:04:12.810> possibly

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:13.740 
they're all con guard up anyway possibly

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:16.039 
they're all con guard up anyway possibly
due<00:04:13.980> to<00:04:14.010> a<00:04:14.490> mirror<00:04:15.420> I<00:04:15.510> think<00:04:15.720> those<00:04:15.840> hairs

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
due to a mirror I think those hairs

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:18.289 
due to a mirror I think those hairs
around<00:04:16.200> them<00:04:16.440> but<00:04:16.590> there<00:04:17.280> you<00:04:17.340> go<00:04:17.460> so<00:04:18.030> I

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
around them but there you go so I

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:19.520 
around them but there you go so I
believe<00:04:18.630> that's<00:04:18.750> dread<00:04:19.080> balling<00:04:19.380> in<00:04:19.500> a

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
believe that's dread balling in a

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:21.560 
believe that's dread balling in a
nutshell<00:04:19.680> balling<00:04:20.430> up<00:04:20.489> loose<00:04:20.670> hair<00:04:20.880> pushing

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570 
nutshell balling up loose hair pushing

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.960 
nutshell balling up loose hair pushing
it<00:04:21.690> into<00:04:21.870> neighbor<00:04:22.860> dread<00:04:23.190> if<00:04:23.520> you<00:04:23.760> want<00:04:23.910> to

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
it into neighbor dread if you want to

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.630 
it into neighbor dread if you want to
follow<00:04:24.090> the<00:04:24.480> way<00:04:24.900> that<00:04:25.170> it's<00:04:25.440> supposedly<00:04:26.280> done

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:26.640 
follow the way that it's supposedly done

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:28.130 
follow the way that it's supposedly done
you<00:04:26.820> leave<00:04:27.060> that<00:04:27.240> ball<00:04:27.420> inside<00:04:27.570> the<00:04:27.810> dried<00:04:27.990> and

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:28.140 
you leave that ball inside the dried and

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:29.480 
you leave that ball inside the dried and
then<00:04:28.200> it<00:04:28.320> kind<00:04:28.470> of<00:04:28.500> unravels<00:04:28.980> and<00:04:29.130> then<00:04:29.250> should

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
then it kind of unravels and then should

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.730 
then it kind of unravels and then should
hopefully<00:04:29.760> grow<00:04:30.120> inside<00:04:30.480> there<00:04:30.780> the<00:04:31.260> method<00:04:31.590> I

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
hopefully grow inside there the method I

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.200 
hopefully grow inside there the method I
