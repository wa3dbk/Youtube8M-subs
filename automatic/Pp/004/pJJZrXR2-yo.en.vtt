00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:13.780
 I am then head of external design of 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:16.480
 bmw i have fulfilled my dream 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:18.640
 I design cars especially the am 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:22.570
 Most of the time I like to sit in one 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:24.939
 2002 from 1967 the place authoritative the 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:27.340
 Character of bmw has cared and exactly 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:29.140
 this character tried in the 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:31.090
 new 2er to be included 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.640
 Now I wanted my colleague 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:35.680
 thomas ebner aps product manager of the 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.920
 new two happen what he has to say 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.920
 Has 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:46.730
 and that means to my car design 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.140
 athletic impression but I will now 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.309
 I 'm interested in the driving dynamics 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:53.900
 say it and just let it out 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:54.440
 I'm really curious how 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:01:00.160
 lead 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:00.160
 let's correct gas can begin 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.220
 hamm-heessen impressed 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.350
 it is different too 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.940
 Vehicles of today but this 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.440
 vehicle that is still puristic it 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:10.979
 Smells even after the 60 and 70 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.750
 billions 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.150
 And I think that's on the slogan 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.170
 Ancestors its origins that you can tell 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.909
 here 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:26.790
 we want them two religion 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:29.369
 coupé success leads just like then 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.380
 bmw 2002 coupé the pulse of time 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:33.259
 has hit light on today if 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.549
 We have two problems in the pulse of time 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:36.570
 only when you notice full throttle here 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.000
 you really what an irrepressible 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.450
 power under the bonnet is like you 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.939
 see 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.950
 in addition, the vehicle is very agile it 

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:47.110
 really offers a great handling one 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.130
 razor- sharp steering but tell me something 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:48.939
 actually fascinates you about this 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.189
 vehicle ago 

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:55.060
 the car is exactly what bmw for me 

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:56.799
 it is compact everything is so 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.810
 directly and you feel totally 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:02.170
 sheltered it actually combines comfort 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:05.920
 and have athleticism together yes 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:08.830
 the bmw 3 coupé designed which 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.220
 inspiration from 2002 in the article 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.400
 read 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:14.200
 the whole gene of 2002 that i want 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:18.120
 show you best when we are now 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:21.310
 directly back in front of the slope 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.930
 except cars two new colors 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.569
 much more in common has theirs 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:29.019
 front do you see the typical bmw shark 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:30.250
 nose the 2002 so extreme had the 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:32.709
 We also tried bands celebration 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.269
 coupe and bring in these 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:37.269
 focus on the street 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:39.459
 this sporty look that's what 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:42.010
 make up the two and in the side 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:43.900
 that it has the bmw beading lines 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.959
 We shine here once, too 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.940
 run around the corner and the power 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:51.760
 the car also so distinctive with 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:52.200
 The hofmeister kink also very typical 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.359
 bmw 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:58.150
 that makes everything the two 

00:02:55.359 --> 00:02:59.709
 really worthy followers from 2002 on 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.250
 I like to say let us down again 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:04.389
 rotate 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:09.180
