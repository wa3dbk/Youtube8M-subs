00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:24.849 
populations first and then I had my

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:27.810 
populations first and then I had my
ornithology<00:00:25.570> lecture<00:00:26.070> nothing<00:00:27.070> too<00:00:27.400> exciting

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:27.820 
ornithology lecture nothing too exciting

ornithology lecture nothing too exciting
today<00:00:28.419> we<00:00:29.110> learned<00:00:29.320> about<00:00:29.669> brood<00:00:30.669> parasitism

today we learned about brood parasitism
in<00:00:32.140> ornithology<00:00:32.920> thought<00:00:33.399> which<00:00:33.520> was<00:00:33.640> pretty

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:33.730 
in ornithology thought which was pretty

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:35.160 
in ornithology thought which was pretty
interesting<00:00:34.060> just<00:00:34.600> like<00:00:34.720> the<00:00:34.840> idea<00:00:35.110> that

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:35.170 
interesting just like the idea that

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:38.160 
interesting just like the idea that
burns<00:00:36.130> will<00:00:36.430> lay<00:00:37.270> their<00:00:37.510> eggs<00:00:37.750> and<00:00:38.050> other

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:38.170 
burns will lay their eggs and other

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:40.920 
burns will lay their eggs and other
birds<00:00:39.160> nests<00:00:39.790> so<00:00:39.910> that<00:00:40.059> they<00:00:40.180> don't<00:00:40.540> have<00:00:40.780> to

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:40.930 
birds nests so that they don't have to

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:42.950 
birds nests so that they don't have to
spend<00:00:41.170> the<00:00:41.320> energy<00:00:41.680> to<00:00:41.950> raise<00:00:42.130> them<00:00:42.399> and

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
spend the energy to raise them and

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.569

coach<00:02:50.980> basically<00:02:51.970> she<00:02:52.300> said<00:02:52.330> the<00:02:52.540> biggest

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
coach basically she said the biggest

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.600 
coach basically she said the biggest
critique<00:02:52.870> for<00:02:53.380> me<00:02:53.470> was<00:02:53.739> I<00:02:53.950> need<00:02:54.130> to<00:02:54.250> be<00:02:54.310> leaner

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
critique for me was I need to be leaner

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.360 
critique for me was I need to be leaner
especially<00:02:55.540> my<00:02:55.660> legs<00:02:55.900> and<00:02:56.380> a<00:02:57.100> little<00:02:57.280> bit

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
especially my legs and a little bit

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.270 
especially my legs and a little bit
tighter<00:02:57.580> in<00:02:57.880> my<00:02:58.060> glutes<00:02:58.450> and<00:02:58.660> delts<00:02:59.320> and<00:02:59.500> I

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
tighter in my glutes and delts and I

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.750 
tighter in my glutes and delts and I
definitely<00:03:00.610> agree<00:03:00.970> with<00:03:01.300> that<00:03:01.330> so<00:03:02.760> excited

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
definitely agree with that so excited

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.670 
definitely agree with that so excited
too<00:03:03.970> I<00:03:04.450> mean<00:03:04.900> I'm<00:03:04.989> not<00:03:05.110> going<00:03:05.260> to<00:03:05.320> work<00:03:05.500> on

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
too I mean I'm not going to work on

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.320 
too I mean I'm not going to work on
getting<00:03:05.950> leaner<00:03:06.310> now<00:03:06.550> because<00:03:06.970> there's<00:03:07.180> no

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
getting leaner now because there's no

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:08.850 
getting leaner now because there's no
point<00:03:07.600> of<00:03:07.750> that<00:03:07.930> but<00:03:08.200> now<00:03:08.290> we<00:03:08.350> know<00:03:08.530> for<00:03:08.769> the

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
point of that but now we know for the

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.310 
point of that but now we know for the
next<00:03:08.890> show<00:03:09.310> what<00:03:09.610> to<00:03:09.730> focus<00:03:09.850> on<00:03:10.180> and<00:03:10.480> for<00:03:11.170> now<00:03:11.290> I

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.320 
next show what to focus on and for now I

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.050 
next show what to focus on and for now I
can<00:03:11.680> start<00:03:12.010> working<00:03:12.489> on<00:03:12.580> tightening<00:03:12.940> my

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
can start working on tightening my

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.600 
can start working on tightening my
muscle<00:03:13.450> over<00:03:14.019> the<00:03:14.140> summer<00:03:14.350> now<00:03:14.950> it<00:03:15.160> is<00:03:15.190> time

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:15.610 
muscle over the summer now it is time

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.080 
muscle over the summer now it is time
for<00:03:16.050> some<00:03:17.050> stenting<00:03:17.620> um<00:03:17.920> we<00:03:18.640> have<00:03:18.730> an<00:03:18.820> open

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
for some stenting um we have an open

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.000 
for some stenting um we have an open
practice<00:03:19.209> tonight<00:03:19.750> so<00:03:20.470> I<00:03:20.530> think<00:03:20.650> just<00:03:20.920> gonna

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
practice tonight so I think just gonna

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.130 
practice tonight so I think just gonna
head<00:03:21.160> over<00:03:21.220> to<00:03:21.430> campus<00:03:21.580> now<00:03:21.910> and<00:03:22.269> hopefully

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
head over to campus now and hopefully

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.250 
head over to campus now and hopefully
today<00:03:23.790> is<00:03:24.790> a<00:03:24.850> good<00:03:25.090> day<00:03:25.150> of<00:03:25.540> stunting<00:03:25.930> but<00:03:26.110> we

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
today is a good day of stunting but we

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:45.360 
today is a good day of stunting but we
will<00:03:26.350> see

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.220 

so<00:03:46.370> obviously<00:03:47.210> the<00:03:47.390> REE<00:03:47.540> one<00:03:47.720> didn't<00:03:48.080> hit

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
so obviously the REE one didn't hit

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:51.910 
so obviously the REE one didn't hit
again<00:03:48.770> today<00:03:49.130> and<00:03:49.370> practice<00:03:50.300> went<00:03:50.920> much

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 
again today and practice went much

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.210 
again today and practice went much
better<00:03:51.950> than<00:03:52.490> yesterday<00:03:53.450> though<00:03:53.630> it<00:03:54.020> was<00:03:54.950> fun

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
better than yesterday though it was fun

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:58.170 
better than yesterday though it was fun
and<00:03:55.460> it<00:03:55.520> was<00:03:55.580> productive<00:03:56.170> just<00:03:57.170> were<00:03:57.260> so<00:03:57.530> close

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
and it was productive just were so close

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.160 
and it was productive just were so close
probably<00:03:59.180> not<00:03:59.270> close<00:03:59.480> enough<00:03:59.720> to<00:03:59.840> do<00:03:59.960> it<00:04:00.050> for

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.170 
probably not close enough to do it for

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:03.250 
probably not close enough to do it for
tryouts<00:04:00.410> but<00:04:01.210> that's<00:04:02.210> okay<00:04:02.480> you<00:04:02.750> know<00:04:02.870> I'm<00:04:03.200> not

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260 
tryouts but that's okay you know I'm not

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:04.960 
tryouts but that's okay you know I'm not
going<00:04:03.470> to<00:04:03.560> give<00:04:03.680> up<00:04:03.740> yet<00:04:04.100> and<00:04:04.430> it's<00:04:04.580> not<00:04:04.790> that

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:04.970 
going to give up yet and it's not that

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:07.390 
going to give up yet and it's not that
hard<00:04:05.120> to<00:04:05.210> change<00:04:05.600> to<00:04:06.470> an<00:04:06.590> easier<00:04:06.890> stun<00:04:07.130> to<00:04:07.310> the

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.400 
hard to change to an easier stun to the

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.520 
hard to change to an easier stun to the
last<00:04:07.610> minute<00:04:07.910> that<00:04:07.940> we<00:04:08.240> know<00:04:08.390> we<00:04:08.510> can<00:04:08.660> hit<00:04:08.840> the

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
last minute that we know we can hit the

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:12.790 
last minute that we know we can hit the
weird<00:04:09.740> thing<00:04:09.950> about<00:04:09.980> stunts<00:04:10.460> is<00:04:11.260> once<00:04:12.260> you<00:04:12.560> hit

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:12.800 
weird thing about stunts is once you hit

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.740 
weird thing about stunts is once you hit
it<00:04:12.980> it's<00:04:13.250> like<00:04:13.940> something<00:04:14.360> in<00:04:14.450> your<00:04:14.540> body

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750 
it it's like something in your body

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:16.870 
it it's like something in your body
clicks<00:04:15.140> and<00:04:15.350> it's<00:04:15.500> like<00:04:15.650> oh<00:04:15.800> that's<00:04:16.610> what<00:04:16.790> I'm

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 
clicks and it's like oh that's what I'm

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.180 
clicks and it's like oh that's what I'm
supposed<00:04:17.180> to<00:04:17.270> do<00:04:17.450> so<00:04:17.780> as<00:04:18.470> soon<00:04:18.739> as<00:04:18.890> i<00:04:19.040> hit<00:04:19.130> a

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:19.190 
supposed to do so as soon as i hit a

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:23.080 
supposed to do so as soon as i hit a
rewind<00:04:19.549> first<00:04:20.230> for<00:04:21.230> real<00:04:21.410> i<00:04:21.820> think<00:04:22.820> it<00:04:22.970> will

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
rewind first for real i think it will

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:25.390 
rewind first for real i think it will
get<00:04:23.300> much<00:04:24.230> easier<00:04:24.290> and<00:04:24.740> we'll<00:04:25.010> be<00:04:25.100> able<00:04:25.190> to<00:04:25.280> hit

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400 
get much easier and we'll be able to hit

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.850 
get much easier and we'll be able to hit
them<00:04:25.580> pretty<00:04:25.820> consistently<00:04:26.480> after<00:04:26.750> that<00:04:26.930> I've

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860 
them pretty consistently after that I've

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:29.440 
them pretty consistently after that I've
been<00:04:28.190> spending<00:04:28.400> the<00:04:28.580> last<00:04:28.670> few<00:04:28.910> hours<00:04:29.150> working
