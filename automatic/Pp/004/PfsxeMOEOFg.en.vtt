00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:02.370 
so what is going to be announced at this

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.030 
so what is going to be announced at this
big<00:00:02.669> apple<00:00:03.179> event<00:00:03.270> in<00:00:03.629> San<00:00:03.870> Francisco<00:00:04.080> well

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040 
big apple event in San Francisco well

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.160 
big apple event in San Francisco well
the<00:00:05.220> best<00:00:05.430> guess<00:00:05.670> is<00:00:05.940> it's<00:00:06.359> a<00:00:06.480> new<00:00:06.629> phone<00:00:06.899> a

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
the best guess is it's a new phone a

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.270 
the best guess is it's a new phone a
successor<00:00:07.919> for<00:00:08.580> the<00:00:08.670> iphone<00:00:09.210> 4s<00:00:09.990> and<00:00:10.650> what

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
successor for the iphone 4s and what

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.370 
successor for the iphone 4s and what
will<00:00:11.429> it<00:00:11.550> be<00:00:11.700> in<00:00:11.880> terms<00:00:12.150> of<00:00:12.420> better<00:00:12.780> well

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
will it be in terms of better well

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.890 
will it be in terms of better well
probably<00:00:13.830> bigger<00:00:14.250> and<00:00:14.549> who<00:00:15.000> knows<00:00:15.179> maybe<00:00:15.240> even

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
probably bigger and who knows maybe even

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.320 
probably bigger and who knows maybe even
made<00:00:16.560> of<00:00:16.740> different<00:00:16.920> materials<00:00:17.180> than<00:00:18.180> the

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
made of different materials than the

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.590 
made of different materials than the
present<00:00:18.690> iphone<00:00:19.439> 4s<00:00:20.130> let's<00:00:21.029> give<00:00:21.480> you<00:00:21.539> a

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
present iphone 4s let's give you a

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.650 
present iphone 4s let's give you a
comparison<00:00:21.960> in<00:00:22.529> what<00:00:22.830> seems<00:00:23.130> a<00:00:23.310> likely

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:23.660 
comparison in what seems a likely

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:26.390 
comparison in what seems a likely
improvement<00:00:24.660> regime<00:00:25.080> that's<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:25.680> 4s<00:00:26.160> in

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
improvement regime that's the 4s in

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.400 
improvement regime that's the 4s in
terms<00:00:26.609> of<00:00:26.730> dimension<00:00:27.240> what<00:00:27.750> would<00:00:27.930> make<00:00:28.050> sense

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
terms of dimension what would make sense

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.470 
terms of dimension what would make sense
will<00:00:28.859> this<00:00:29.070> phone<00:00:29.340> screen<00:00:29.730> will<00:00:29.939> be<00:00:29.970> at<00:00:30.150> least

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
will this phone screen will be at least

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.729 
will this phone screen will be at least
another<00:00:31.219> icon<00:00:32.219> taller<00:00:32.940> in<00:00:33.329> fact<00:00:33.989> if<00:00:34.260> you<00:00:34.320> tip

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
another icon taller in fact if you tip

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.350 
another icon taller in fact if you tip
it<00:00:34.770> through<00:00:35.010> 90<00:00:35.250> degrees<00:00:35.610> it<00:00:35.910> would<00:00:36.120> probably

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
it through 90 degrees it would probably

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.830 
it through 90 degrees it would probably
be<00:00:36.570> perfect<00:00:37.170> for<00:00:37.829> 16<00:00:38.370> by<00:00:38.579> 9<00:00:38.850> that's<00:00:39.210> widescreen

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
be perfect for 16 by 9 that's widescreen

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.910 
be perfect for 16 by 9 that's widescreen
TV<00:00:40.320> or<00:00:40.590> video<00:00:41.239> so<00:00:42.239> that<00:00:42.690> would<00:00:42.899> make<00:00:43.290> absolute

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
TV or video so that would make absolute

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.400 
TV or video so that would make absolute
sense<00:00:43.950> in<00:00:44.579> terms<00:00:45.059> of<00:00:45.300> other<00:00:45.570> changes<00:00:46.140> to<00:00:46.320> the

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
sense in terms of other changes to the

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.479 
sense in terms of other changes to the
phone<00:00:46.680> itself<00:00:47.340> well<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.899> display<00:00:49.350> now<00:00:50.160> four

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
phone itself well the display now four

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.010 
phone itself well the display now four
inches<00:00:50.820> that<00:00:51.090> would<00:00:51.270> be<00:00:51.420> bigger<00:00:51.750> than<00:00:51.840> ever

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
inches that would be bigger than ever

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.380 
inches that would be bigger than ever
before<00:00:52.469> but<00:00:52.710> not<00:00:52.920> interestingly<00:00:53.489> as<00:00:53.969> big<00:00:54.239> as

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
before but not interestingly as big as

some of its immediate rivals it will be

that could be used as security so just

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
well have invested a bit more technology

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:12.350 
well have invested a bit more technology
in<00:03:10.200> the<00:03:10.800> kind<00:03:11.100> of<00:03:11.400> headphones<00:03:11.610> you<00:03:12.000> get<00:03:12.150> in<00:03:12.270> the

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
in the kind of headphones you get in the

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.979 
in the kind of headphones you get in the
box<00:03:12.390> which<00:03:13.380> up<00:03:13.650> till<00:03:13.890> now<00:03:13.920> have<00:03:14.400> been<00:03:14.670> okay<00:03:15.480> but

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
box which up till now have been okay but

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:17.509 
box which up till now have been okay but
most<00:03:16.410> people<00:03:16.680> throw<00:03:16.860> them<00:03:16.980> away<00:03:17.100> and<00:03:17.370> use

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
most people throw them away and use

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:19.490 
most people throw them away and use
something<00:03:17.850> bit<00:03:18.030> better<00:03:18.209> quality<00:03:18.660> these<00:03:19.230> we

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
something bit better quality these we

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.170 
something bit better quality these we
think<00:03:19.799> are<00:03:20.190> going<00:03:20.370> to<00:03:20.430> be<00:03:20.489> included<00:03:20.850> and

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
think are going to be included and

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.130 
think are going to be included and
probably<00:03:22.019> be<00:03:22.230> a<00:03:22.440> lot<00:03:22.890> better<00:03:23.250> design<00:03:24.030> now<00:03:24.840> what

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
probably be a lot better design now what

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:26.570 
probably be a lot better design now what
else<00:03:25.290> can<00:03:25.470> we<00:03:25.560> say<00:03:25.590> about<00:03:25.860> this<00:03:26.100> new<00:03:26.340> phone

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
else can we say about this new phone

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:29.630 
else can we say about this new phone
well<00:03:26.910> the<00:03:27.299> back<00:03:27.540> of<00:03:27.720> it<00:03:27.840> certainly<00:03:28.530> may<00:03:29.459> well

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
well the back of it certainly may well

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.000 
well the back of it certainly may well
look<00:03:29.850> different<00:03:30.360> the<00:03:30.870> camera<00:03:31.380> in<00:03:31.530> the<00:03:31.650> corner

look different the camera in the corner

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.130 
look different the camera in the corner
here<00:03:32.040> what's<00:03:32.880> that<00:03:33.000> going<00:03:33.239> to<00:03:33.299> be<00:03:33.450> the<00:03:33.660> 4s<00:03:34.019> has

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
here what's that going to be the 4s has

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.289 
here what's that going to be the 4s has
got<00:03:34.290> an<00:03:34.380> 8<00:03:34.500> megapixel<00:03:34.680> camera<00:03:35.489> already<00:03:35.640> can

got an 8 megapixel camera already can
they<00:03:36.420> make<00:03:36.600> that<00:03:36.780> even<00:03:37.049> better<00:03:37.290> one<00:03:38.130> way<00:03:38.310> we've

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
they make that even better one way we've

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:41.330 
they make that even better one way we've
make<00:03:38.790> it<00:03:38.940> 3d<00:03:39.450> it's<00:03:40.080> a<00:03:40.170> possibility<00:03:40.470> the

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
make it 3d it's a possibility the

make it 3d it's a possibility the

it's<00:04:50.460> nearly<00:04:50.790> 5<00:04:51.120> inches<00:04:51.450> across<00:04:51.690> this<00:04:51.990> screen

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:52.350 
it's nearly 5 inches across this screen

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:54.620 
it's nearly 5 inches across this screen
it's<00:04:52.860> got<00:04:53.070> a<00:04:53.100> quad-core<00:04:53.460> processor<00:04:54.330> so<00:04:54.480> it's

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:54.630 
it's got a quad-core processor so it's

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:57.710 
it's got a quad-core processor so it's
blazingly<00:04:55.260> fast<00:04:55.620> the<00:04:56.340> HTC<00:04:56.700> One<00:04:57.150> comes<00:04:57.480> pretty

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:57.720 
blazingly fast the HTC One comes pretty

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.900 
blazingly fast the HTC One comes pretty
close<00:04:57.960> as<00:04:58.230> well<00:04:58.470> the<00:04:58.800> screens<00:04:59.130> almost

00:04:59.900 --> 00:04:59.910 
close as well the screens almost

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:02.450 
close as well the screens almost
identical<00:05:00.540> and<00:05:00.710> super<00:05:01.710> high<00:05:01.830> quality<00:05:01.860> as<00:05:02.430> well

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 
identical and super high quality as well

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:05.810 
identical and super high quality as well
so<00:05:03.270> if<00:05:03.540> our<00:05:03.870> guess<00:05:04.470> about<00:05:05.010> this<00:05:05.250> phone<00:05:05.490> is<00:05:05.669> it's

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:05.820 
so if our guess about this phone is it's

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:07.370 
so if our guess about this phone is it's
only<00:05:06.060> a<00:05:06.090> four<00:05:06.389> inch<00:05:06.570> screen<00:05:06.840> that<00:05:07.110> might

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:07.380 
only a four inch screen that might

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:09.110 
only a four inch screen that might
disappoint<00:05:07.860> some<00:05:08.130> people<00:05:08.460> who've<00:05:08.639> got<00:05:08.820> used

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 
disappoint some people who've got used

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.840 
disappoint some people who've got used
to<00:05:09.300> that<00:05:09.510> amount<00:05:10.169> of<00:05:10.350> screen<00:05:10.919> real<00:05:11.250> estate<00:05:11.280> and

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:11.850 
to that amount of screen real estate and

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:14.120 
to that amount of screen real estate and
will<00:05:12.360> it<00:05:12.450> have<00:05:12.660> a<00:05:12.690> quad-core<00:05:13.020> processor<00:05:13.830> so<00:05:14.010> it

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:14.130 
will it have a quad-core processor so it

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:16.370 
will it have a quad-core processor so it
can<00:05:14.310> keep<00:05:14.580> up<00:05:14.790> and<00:05:15.030> maybe<00:05:15.210> make<00:05:15.750> maximum<00:05:16.260> use

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:16.380 
can keep up and maybe make maximum use

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:20.030 
can keep up and maybe make maximum use
