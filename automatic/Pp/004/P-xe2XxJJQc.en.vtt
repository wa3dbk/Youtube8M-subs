00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
you something very interesting unless

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.129 
you something very interesting unless
you<00:00:09.000> guys<00:00:09.150> have<00:00:09.210> been<00:00:09.570> living<00:00:09.780> in<00:00:09.870> Iraq<00:00:09.960> you

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
you guys have been living in Iraq you

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.860 
you guys have been living in Iraq you
know<00:00:10.440> that<00:00:10.650> AMD<00:00:11.309> has<00:00:11.550> released<00:00:11.969> a<00:00:12.179> brand<00:00:12.630> new

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
know that AMD has released a brand new

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.189 
know that AMD has released a brand new
GPU<00:00:13.440> out<00:00:13.710> into<00:00:14.490> the<00:00:14.670> market<00:00:15.089> now<00:00:15.240> why<00:00:15.570> is<00:00:15.630> this

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
GPU out into the market now why is this

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.260 
GPU out into the market now why is this
well<00:00:16.619> when<00:00:16.800> AMD<00:00:17.310> looked<00:00:17.760> at<00:00:17.880> their<00:00:18.029> lineup

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
well when AMD looked at their lineup

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.740 
well when AMD looked at their lineup
between<00:00:18.779> their<00:00:19.070> 7770<00:00:20.070> and<00:00:20.279> their<00:00:20.760> 7850<00:00:21.539> they

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
between their 7770 and their 7850 they

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.390 
between their 7770 and their 7850 they
felt<00:00:22.050> that<00:00:22.230> there<00:00:22.410> was<00:00:22.560> a<00:00:22.590> gap<00:00:22.920> in<00:00:23.160> between

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
felt that there was a gap in between

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.790 
felt that there was a gap in between
there<00:00:23.850> that<00:00:24.029> could<00:00:24.300> be<00:00:24.449> filled<00:00:24.810> and<00:00:25.050> therefore

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
there that could be filled and therefore

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.660 
there that could be filled and therefore
the<00:00:26.099> new<00:00:26.279> HD<00:00:26.820> 77<00:00:27.660> 90<00:00:28.019> was<00:00:28.410> born<00:00:28.980> not<00:00:29.429> today

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
the new HD 77 90 was born not today

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.009 
the new HD 77 90 was born not today
we're<00:00:29.789> going<00:00:29.880> to<00:00:29.970> bring<00:00:30.119> you<00:00:30.269> the<00:00:30.510> review

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
we're going to bring you the review

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.959 
we're going to bring you the review
comparison<00:00:31.949> against<00:00:32.489> its<00:00:32.610> little<00:00:32.850> brother

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
comparison against its little brother

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.930 
comparison against its little brother
card<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:33.660> 77<00:00:34.410> 70<00:00:34.770> which<00:00:34.920> many<00:00:35.190> of<00:00:35.370> you<00:00:35.579> have

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
card the 77 70 which many of you have

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.330 
card the 77 70 which many of you have
asked<00:00:36.329> for<00:00:36.390> so<00:00:36.989> what<00:00:37.140> that<00:00:37.290> said<00:00:37.649> let's<00:00:38.129> get

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
asked for so what that said let's get

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.670 
asked for so what that said let's get
ready<00:00:38.520> to<00:00:38.610> rumble<00:00:38.850> and<00:00:39.239> jump<00:00:39.600> in<00:00:39.870> to<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.469> ring

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
ready to rumble and jump in to the ring

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.290 
ready to rumble and jump in to the ring
so<00:00:41.160> now<00:00:41.250> let's<00:00:41.430> talk<00:00:41.550> about<00:00:41.610> some<00:00:42.090> of<00:00:42.210> the

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
so now let's talk about some of the

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.170 
so now let's talk about some of the
basic<00:00:42.840> differences<00:00:43.350> between<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.920> new<00:00:43.950> 77<00:00:44.820> 90

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
basic differences between the new 77 90

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.180 
basic differences between the new 77 90
and<00:00:45.360> its<00:00:45.480> little<00:00:45.660> brother<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.440> seventy<00:00:46.860> seven

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
and its little brother the seventy seven

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.540 
and its little brother the seventy seven
seventy<00:00:47.399> now<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:47.850> 77<00:00:48.690> 78<00:00:49.200> GPU<00:00:49.829> was<00:00:50.250> called

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
seventy now the 77 78 GPU was called

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.540 
seventy now the 77 78 GPU was called
cape<00:00:51.090> verde<00:00:51.870> and<00:00:52.170> it<00:00:52.649> actually<00:00:52.829> featured<00:00:53.399> a

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
cape verde and it actually featured a

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.580 
cape verde and it actually featured a
die<00:00:53.730> that<00:00:53.760> was<00:00:54.180> slightly<00:00:54.750> smaller<00:00:55.170> than<00:00:55.320> the

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
die that was slightly smaller than the

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.630 
die that was slightly smaller than the
new<00:00:55.969> 77<00:00:56.969> 90<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.660> 77<00:00:58.350> 90<00:00:58.680> is<00:00:58.829> based<00:00:59.070> off<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.489> new

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
new 77 90 the 77 90 is based off the new

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.119 
new 77 90 the 77 90 is based off the new
bone<00:01:00.149> air<00:01:00.359> GPU<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:01.109> actually<00:01:01.440> this<00:01:01.829> is<00:01:01.890> the

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
bone air GPU and actually this is the

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.770 
bone air GPU and actually this is the
very<00:01:02.399> first<00:01:02.640> of<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.000> sea<00:01:03.210> islands<00:01:03.629> to

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
very first of the sea islands to

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.600 
very first of the sea islands to
actually<00:01:04.199> hit<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.769> market<00:01:05.159> there'll<00:01:05.309> be<00:01:05.339> many

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
actually hit the market there'll be many

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.310 
actually hit the market there'll be many
more<00:01:05.670> that<00:01:05.939> are<00:01:05.970> coming<00:01:06.299> out<00:01:06.420> but<00:01:06.810> this<00:01:06.990> is<00:01:07.049> the

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
more that are coming out but this is the

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.800 
more that are coming out but this is the
first<00:01:07.560> now<00:01:08.250> stream<00:01:08.850> processors<00:01:09.330> which<00:01:09.659> is

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
first now stream processors which is

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.210 
first now stream processors which is
really<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.140> most<00:01:10.320> important<00:01:10.979> thing<00:01:11.010> about

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
really the most important thing about

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.100 
really the most important thing about
the<00:01:11.520> card<00:01:11.760> is<00:01:11.970> a<00:01:12.030> major<00:01:12.420> difference<00:01:12.720> between

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
the card is a major difference between

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.390 
the card is a major difference between
the<00:01:13.260> two<00:01:13.439> on<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:14.010> 77<00:01:14.640> 90<00:01:15.000> we<00:01:15.299> see<00:01:15.979> 896<00:01:16.979> stream

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
the two on the 77 90 we see 896 stream

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.310 
the two on the 77 90 we see 896 stream
processors<00:01:18.060> on<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.750> 77<00:01:19.290> 70<00:01:19.799> we<00:01:20.070> see<00:01:20.250> only<00:01:21.320> 640

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
processors on the 77 70 we see only 640

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.440 
processors on the 77 70 we see only 640
there<00:01:22.680> are<00:01:22.740> also<00:01:22.830> some<00:01:23.250> difference<00:01:23.670> in<00:01:23.880> the

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
there are also some difference in the

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.359 
there are also some difference in the
total<00:01:24.689> available<00:01:25.259> memory<00:01:25.680> bandwidth<00:01:26.189> now

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
total available memory bandwidth now

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.010 
total available memory bandwidth now
take<00:01:26.610> into<00:01:26.820> consideration<00:01:27.420> that<00:01:27.570> both<00:01:27.780> these

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
take into consideration that both these

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.700 
take into consideration that both these
cards<00:01:28.530> are<00:01:28.729> overclocked<00:01:29.729> on<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.210> 77<00:01:30.689> 90<00:01:31.110> we

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
cards are overclocked on the 77 90 we

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.289 
cards are overclocked on the 77 90 we
see<00:01:31.920> a<00:01:31.950> total<00:01:32.400> available<00:01:32.670> memory<00:01:32.850> bandwidth

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
see a total available memory bandwidth

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.679 
see a total available memory bandwidth
of<00:01:33.450> 100<00:01:33.810> and<00:01:33.900> 2.4<00:01:34.860> gigabytes<00:01:35.759> per<00:01:35.909> second<00:01:36.570> on

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
of 100 and 2.4 gigabytes per second on

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.069 
of 100 and 2.4 gigabytes per second on
the<00:01:37.020> 77<00:01:37.530> 70<00:01:38.070> we<00:01:38.520> see<00:01:38.759> slightly<00:01:39.060> lower<00:01:39.390> at<00:01:39.630> 80

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
the 77 70 we see slightly lower at 80

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.590 
the 77 70 we see slightly lower at 80
3.2<00:01:40.860> gigabytes<00:01:41.400> per<00:01:41.549> second<00:01:42.060> so<00:01:42.240> there<00:01:42.390> is<00:01:42.570> a

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
3.2 gigabytes per second so there is a

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.899 
3.2 gigabytes per second so there is a
pretty<00:01:42.960> big<00:01:43.079> difference<00:01:43.350> there<00:01:43.860> now<00:01:44.579> let's

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
pretty big difference there now let's

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.080 
pretty big difference there now let's
talk<00:01:45.090> about<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.899> GPU<00:01:46.409> core<00:01:46.829> clock<00:01:47.100> speed<00:01:47.460> one

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
talk about the GPU core clock speed one

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.569 
talk about the GPU core clock speed one
thing<00:01:48.270> to<00:01:48.360> take<00:01:48.540> note<00:01:48.600> of<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:49.490> 7770<00:01:50.490> is

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.789 
thing to take note of the 7770 is
actually<00:01:51.119> clocked<00:01:51.420> higher<00:01:51.720> it's<00:01:52.049> at<00:01:52.320> eleven

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
clock is at a thousand 75 but the memory

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.950

we<00:02:01.409> see<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.649> memory<00:02:01.950> speeds<00:02:02.250> at<00:02:02.460> 1600

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
we see the memory speeds at 1600

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.840 
we see the memory speeds at 1600

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
megahertz and on the 77 70 we see them

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.789

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
back to 1300 megahertz so there are some

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.710 
back to 1300 megahertz so there are some
differences<00:02:08.099> there<00:02:08.459> as<00:02:08.640> well<00:02:08.879> both<00:02:09.360> cards

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
differences there as well both cards

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.960 
differences there as well both cards
feature<00:02:09.929> one<00:02:10.530> gigabyte<00:02:10.950> of<00:02:11.220> gddr5<00:02:11.640> memory

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
feature one gigabyte of gddr5 memory

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.200 
feature one gigabyte of gddr5 memory
both<00:02:12.930> cards<00:02:13.349> feature<00:02:13.560> 100

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:14.210 
both cards feature 100

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:16.870 
both cards feature 100
memory<00:02:15.200> interface<00:02:15.590> all<00:02:15.860> those<00:02:16.370> things<00:02:16.640> are

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
memory interface all those things are

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.970 
memory interface all those things are
pretty<00:02:17.090> much<00:02:17.360> the<00:02:17.660> same<00:02:17.870> so<00:02:18.500> now<00:02:18.590> let's<00:02:18.770> take<00:02:18.950> a

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
pretty much the same so now let's take a

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.710 
pretty much the same so now let's take a
look<00:02:19.250> at<00:02:19.370> the<00:02:19.460> aesthetics<00:02:19.850> of<00:02:19.970> the<00:02:20.120> card<00:02:20.360> we

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
look at the aesthetics of the card we

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.660 
look at the aesthetics of the card we
can<00:02:20.870> see<00:02:21.110> that<00:02:21.320> right<00:02:21.470> off<00:02:21.680> the<00:02:21.710> bat<00:02:21.890> both<00:02:22.460> of

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
can see that right off the bat both of

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.060 
can see that right off the bat both of
these<00:02:22.820> cards<00:02:23.210> feature<00:02:23.690> aftermarket<00:02:24.680> cooling

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.070 
these cards feature aftermarket cooling

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:26.980 
these cards feature aftermarket cooling
the<00:02:25.190> real<00:02:25.370> difference<00:02:25.790> is<00:02:25.970> one<00:02:26.270> has<00:02:26.300> vapor<00:02:26.660> X

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:26.990 
the real difference is one has vapor X

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:30.640 
the real difference is one has vapor X
which<00:02:27.170> is<00:02:27.290> a<00:02:27.350> 77<00:02:27.710> 70<00:02:28.370> and<00:02:28.550> the<00:02:29.000> 77<00:02:29.600> 90<00:02:29.960> has<00:02:30.170> dual
