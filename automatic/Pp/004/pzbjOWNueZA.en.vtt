00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:09.960
 I hope well stories and tochÃ© and 

00:00:07.979 --> 00:00:12.660
 we are an audio of minecraft figure 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:16.740
 we are here with a new way that the 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:19.350
 nine cut and how he follows is the cat 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:23.510
 this this cat of color and color and 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.510
 all this one 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:29.370
 there 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:29.370
 taking 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:33.060
 the common project 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.520
 well I would not know states or sugar that are 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.190
 d 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.370
 this union 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:48.120
 this puppy for example this 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:51.000
 and he's talking and then he exploded and 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.620
 then we have to modify it and make 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.510
 this 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:58.530
 first we have to do these first 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:02.309
 with this and how this is done with this 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.610
 this in powdered sugar and this stone of 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:08.080
 mine 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:11.860
 and there we have this then let's do and 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:15.630
 we do this although this is so that 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:19.000
 more time to exploit us for example 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:22.080
 we throw this takes a certain 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.710
 time and exploded as they see there 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:29.470
 and good he went 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.470
 well and then explode look 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:37.960
 good he went 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:39.930
 is there exploded one and now the 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.530
 other 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.390
 I do not know how many seconds these are but 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:48.750
 then feed this cerritos 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:52.740
 I'm there longer and it lasts to explode 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:57.000
 so do not say I do not know if you can 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:59.960
 go up and drop it but it would be a 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.960
 little complicated 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.060
 with 8 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:11.100
 is concludes not to conclude done with click 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:11.100
 in runs one of these bugs 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.319
 you can not 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:22.740
 although I can not 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:26.850
 or not son of a bitch 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:30.200
 well he destroyed all of this 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:30.200
 and platform 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.610
 it is done with all dye colors and a 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:38.670
 diamond and this one to another or so that 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:42.390
 demonstrates that is with one dispenser 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:46.740
 option to iron mingote pink tint 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:50.730
 good a piston and gunpowder comes out this with 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:54.730
 this can do this other in jean cut 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:57.640
 but this third destination 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:00.099
 and we have with the dyes with all the 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:03.519
 dyes a diamond washes his head and a 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:05.040
 glass panel glass and we already have this 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:09.120
 Y 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.120
 we are going to stay to I do not know what we are 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:12.250
 dyes 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:16.690
 we have all the dyes here 

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:22.600
 point was red orange yellow 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.360
 red orange 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:33.780
 orange 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:40.990
 yellow yes 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:40.990
 for now he dresses and green 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:44.740
 pure 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:48.690
 but this one 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:53.690
 we already have if you measure d 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:56.650
 what the diamond hates the most 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:56.650
 but first 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:02.530
 ay this 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:02.530
 wang damon 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:09.319
 one of these panels that we have here 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.680
 here it is 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:14.090
 there 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.090
 we put this 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:17.130
 touch 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:26.610
 diamond and 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.610
 same 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:31.789
 although good we trace this first 

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:31.789
 so 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:41.539
 we go all 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:49.240
 well the class one so do not have them 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:53.470
 if we speak we have this 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:53.470
 on top of the little girl and all 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:05:04.960
 Now I feel now now the rest 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:04.960
 we have this 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:14.590
 but thanks to a little bit here, edit the 

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:19.180
 truth is useless but with such 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:23.530
 to move the other players a little or 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:28.140
 play on we use this and already 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:33.940
 it's the same if they can get this 

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:36.750
 mount is the strip and if they hit 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:39.330
 Right click and put this and get on 

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:42.930
 good for you give to the gunpowder 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:44.720
 is in memory there are positions by 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:48.420
 generation 

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:51.060
 these are these are for said this one 

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:55.280
 Once I have insurance, I guess for the 

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:55.280
 two are the common 

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:04.080
 or no it does not look like in our positions 

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:04.080
 or not 

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:10.750
 ok well I thought it was other positions 

00:06:08.379 --> 00:06:14.470
 but no 

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:20.590
 normal and we saw each other and see each other 

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:24.390
 in another video chao and I got on and got on 

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:27.730
 at last you can do this also 

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:30.970
 If you do not have the water and ready to throw 

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:33.520
 this bichito aragua put the mount 

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:37.270
 it's ready 

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:40.410
 there they will see that it has zero this 

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:40.410
 down below 

00:06:41.569 --> 00:06:44.169
 best 

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:47.800
 better not 

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:51.980
 okay
