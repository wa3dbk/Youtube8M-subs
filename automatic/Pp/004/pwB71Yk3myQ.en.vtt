00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
it as one negative it might be just mine

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.330 
it as one negative it might be just mine
or<00:02:48.030> it<00:02:48.450> might<00:02:48.599> be<00:02:48.780> everyone's<00:02:49.200> if<00:02:49.590> this<00:02:50.129> does

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
or it might be everyone's if this does

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.949

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
happened to you tell me this break no I

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:58.429 
happened to you tell me this break no I
know<00:02:55.470> freaking<00:02:56.129> big<00:02:56.310> break<00:02:56.670> a<00:02:56.849> propel<00:02:57.629> this

00:02:58.429 --> 00:02:58.439 
know freaking big break a propel this

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:02.149 
know freaking big break a propel this
pedal<00:02:58.829> that<00:02:59.129> I<00:02:59.189> guess<00:02:59.579> the<00:02:59.790> left<00:03:00.780> pedal<00:03:01.159> it

00:03:02.149 --> 00:03:02.159 
pedal that I guess the left pedal it

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:05.030 
pedal that I guess the left pedal it
loosens<00:03:02.609> at<00:03:03.450> the<00:03:03.659> at<00:03:03.870> the<00:03:03.930> bulb<00:03:04.530> there<00:03:04.769> I<00:03:04.799> think

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
loosens at the at the bulb there I think

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.649 
loosens at the at the bulb there I think
I've<00:03:05.159> I<00:03:07.430> think<00:03:08.430> that<00:03:08.670> I've<00:03:08.819> had<00:03:09.090> the<00:03:09.120> Titan<00:03:09.510> so
