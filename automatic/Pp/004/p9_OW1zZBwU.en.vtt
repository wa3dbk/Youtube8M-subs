00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:07.650
 Hello If Sakurai is the Serra star of Kirby Toka Super Smash Brothers game 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:13.230
 I did Arad for the design 

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:18.060
 This time in Maid in I came out and decided to make 7 games 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:20.480
 One you also but somehow I heard this is the very first project Farewell work 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:24.099
 Thank you please expected 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:27.050
 I also used to be tools like this 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:30.610
 I entered the game industry though 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:34.960
 I think it would be really troublesome if you try it in practice 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:39.370
 Naughty Maid-in I 'm not making a game itself 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:40.469
 Why is still very big is the Tteyuu inasmuch pleasure in that troublesome grass of the previous 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:47.160
 Ne 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:51.629
 Really and I do not know at all in hit and things like that Toka difficulty but make 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.500
 Who eat to eat you have to like the food I think it's genre, which can also be a want discarded 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:58.769
 Though 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:01:00.340
 People who make games so hard and hard to do it 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:05.950
 That there is 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:12.220
 It would be appreciated if you could know a little bit, and people who found it would be a game 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:17.300
 That pleases the dust various visitor to the in to make a real game and I want to make 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:20.340
 I think it would be nice if you could do something 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:26.250
 The fact that this time Re after Meguuin 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:32.549
 For example, one-touch without moving operation Toka aiming for something Toka those things are all 1 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:33.600
 I tried to make it stick to saying only the timing, but in that respect various features 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:38.850
 And it may change 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:45.750
 Thank you please try to play by all means I think that randomness is 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:48.600
 8 I will have made this game in time, but actually it will take a little more time 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:53.549
 I thought that I want to put in various distances 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:55.470
 I think that you have created a bone end tour de force with a user of you perhaps more 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:59.940
 But 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.540
 We think that we want to work hard towards making a normal game from this so as not to lose 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.440
 I will 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.440
 Thank you in advance
