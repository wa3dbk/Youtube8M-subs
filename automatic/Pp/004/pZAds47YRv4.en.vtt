00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.650
 mom mom tonight so we talked a lot about the themes of the 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.720
 campaign to the war in iraq and the economy and the environment but me 

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:15.600
 I am so opticians a major theme that will be determining these 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.810
 elections because Americans are voting right now c the look from 8 o'clock 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:20.630
 cyclists 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:21.679
 Its very important 

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:24.829
 it may sound futile to talk about dresses decode women candidates 

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:27.079
 but deep down today we have to remember that politics is more 

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:27.699
 only 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:31.149
 programs and meetings confirms it's the family of the candidate entrusted 

00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:32.390
 of all his seams 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.059
 it's the camera that make these countries to the living room and sometimes to the 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:37.500
 bedroom and it's a picture building at the bottom 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.839
 of themselves the color of a candidate's dress and I thought 

00:00:40.839 --> 00:00:44.260
 thinking is part of a message can not be challenged to look into it 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.080
 he described you seeing what it tells the site so it was not 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.270
 a lot of women it's michelle obama have to their opponents to start 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.730
 by exact to make me massage India looks at the time of sending the left 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.650
 we have a feather dress printed on the right a dress 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:59.800
 single fare and both times very far-sighted very closely 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.890
 very very fast in the crowd she has a chance to have to go 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:05.700
 in a few days it is the turn of colors and prints it is an advantage 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.620
 in relation to that the end of her husband's rival clark we chose images 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.680
 because keeping the fathers is basically it was the necklace of the 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.770
 campaign that the two have not worn the same record seems 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.630
 for the pearl his skin his wife do you know if a little afp side a little bit 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:20.200
 love 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.740
 presenter of even advised this bag do not expect mayotte in the 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.060
 grammar beyond politics the pearl is a legitimate thing 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.090
 there by cons around this gentleman looked at me bare arms 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.299
 the light dress in case no complex to something very very 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.390
 natural and she talks about it 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:36.619
 very very often income 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:38.180
 colors both the worn belt 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:39.990
 and yet I will see to his golden lion 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.000
 then obviously changed in the red we are obviously of category we have 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.040
 a lot compared 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.160
 by the end of the year the makina lawns taken at the latter could 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.520
 to be realized without the kind in front of lacapelle children it is a rich woman 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:53.890
 which means that is quite chic and that there are 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.880
 constraints that weigh on the woman who wears closed 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.770
 so here we see that it's the consumption of the day after my sense the 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.950
 money break is true that the missed acts we will be mostly 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.219
 so how to do too much else still too fair 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.609
 it was not something that happened to someone little me hot obama 

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:09.419
 which is much more natural to frankly 

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:11.519
 the euro had outclassed victory 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:15.199
 on the other hand in the middle I can be in the genre even if reagan we went 

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:19.189
 quite successful so for the industry close buttoned then left we have 

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:21.889
 always this doubt is hidden by a keffiyeh right a lot of clothes 

00:02:21.889 --> 00:02:25.109
 moreover in 24 others are Congolese never relevant 

00:02:25.619 --> 00:02:28.389
 almost always rolled up the mark their flesh that can do 

00:02:28.389 --> 00:02:29.450
 illusion from afar 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.650
 so here we obviously have darfur if we will say a little more to listen 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:34.229
 Michel Amat 

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:37.339
 he was only trying to hide his dark face 

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:40.689
 in any case a lot of beasts short jackets where we find the small 

00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:43.939
 bolero the color dress leave a little bit to have the lightest but 

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:48.079
 only one who knows a little theoretical side his 87th very well dressed 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:52.200
 towards the end of his career the women of the countryside did a little bit of 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.419
 efforts to make contracted contracted more 

00:02:54.419 --> 00:02:57.019
 the quietest blow even at the level of just now when even 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:02:57.509
 broken 

00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:59.830
 in a different color of the shoes 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:03.070
 remembering vote ben here are the shoes the lady obama wears shoes 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.529
 flat 

00:03:03.529 --> 00:03:06.209
 because she is taller than her very strong husband she is very very 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:07.329
 very high value 

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:10.419
 obama is very very big whereas at the film library it can be 

00:03:10.419 --> 00:03:13.119
 allow and a year earlier for that we do not respect his status 

00:03:13.119 --> 00:03:16.119
 in his image is his true size as it is a very precise woman 

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:19.999
 Scottish minc the present 

00:03:19.999 --> 00:03:22.850
 so here we see a little bit between the two sides clashing on the ball 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:25.880
 I do not know interesting to put these last days because basically by 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.189
 against the other we saw 

00:03:27.189 --> 00:03:30.590
 first a ma'am maclean buttoned up to the top 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:33.349
 do you keep language we do not know if they are really strong but his name is 

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:33.790
 anyway 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:35.249
 this complicity between the two 

00:03:35.249 --> 00:03:38.529
 and those things that clothing tells pretty much anyway a question 

00:03:38.529 --> 00:03:39.899
 Image 

00:03:39.899 --> 00:03:43.579
 the role completely different because we want to say when we look at their 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:44.649
 clothing 

00:03:44.649 --> 00:03:46.659
 generating positive signals 

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:49.699
 these two generations of this type of different stories the daily mail 

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:53.290
 a lady madam obama to work very early at the arsenal put hand to 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:56.759
 the dough he was the head of her husband so she did not keep my future 

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:59.120
 who is pushed modern women today 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.830
 she dresses a relatively cheap marc pcb has arrived 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:05.620
 with a floating h &amp; m meter but also dresses very very expensive at night she 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.760
 is very glamorous present very verve 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.629
 when she is on the ground the weapon of the clothes of a woman who is working 

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:12.410
 with hospitals things like that 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:14.580
 while deep down but in my head it's a little bit the opposite to the 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:17.639
 platelet out of his role two women 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:19.799
 at home a little in the shadow of her husband 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:22.849
 having a solid image to watch you will see have given me that 

00:04:22.849 --> 00:04:26.210
 he is a little praying to participate in the election campaign that can 

00:04:26.209 --> 00:04:29.589
 annoying the tears a little bit problematic as said the press 

00:04:29.589 --> 00:04:32.820
 American so even though in the end the sexes of Christ a little bit 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:35.740
 these two generations but also from the social image two images of women 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:36.349
 different 

00:04:36.349 --> 00:04:39.120
 on one side the quiet housewife who is holding the house 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.599
 the other two women who work 

00:04:40.599 --> 00:04:42.300
 so when we see that's all you 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.830
 you said weird so launched the voters 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.729
 it's already good because the team is in French or in English 

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:48.830
 we'll look at all this 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:50.370
 tomorrow thank you very much said
