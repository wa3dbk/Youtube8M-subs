00:00:00.579 --> 00:00:02.090
 the guidelines 

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:03.850
 so 

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:05.760
 Hartmann also buys Google 

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:07.210
 but not here 

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:09.949
 namely from the Moonlight results 1 

00:00:09.949 --> 00:00:12.949
 Woods 

00:00:16.919 --> 00:00:18.359
 that's okay 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:19.420
 Plattling as 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:21.650
 that the sales start 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:23.560
 the brushes 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.349
 It is clear that I necessarily have 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:26.329
 and 

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:28.579
 what was in the European Championship 

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:31.089
 Weiner and touched percent 

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:34.190
 now suffers de 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.450
 Kramer built the rail no island but also afterwards 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.160
 Judge for justification 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.160
 to write the 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:46.570
 NDR main 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.930
 black me my person 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.250
 Another bad example is definitely the city of Bayreuth and the or is 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.070
 everything 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:55.170
 Aral 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.010
 then everything was gone so there were hardly any causes left from this sooner 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:01.890
 celebrate no borders anymore 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.730
 they have 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.510
 Whenever I know something special in my chest, I have mobile phones in my chest 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:10.320
 followed and 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.320
 and it will be hard but nothing is incredibly much easier 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.320
 So I thought maybe he is worthy of the other 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.550
 reasonable would be 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:21.690
 the city hall damage 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:25.140
 The costs are just a lot much much much easier 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.140
 this assures the employees to meet again 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.550
 felt and therefore it was not quite enough although he was already for 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:32.520
 heavyweight St 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.470
 at his work 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.390
 and yes I am the master already the country Hessen reached a chance with 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:39.660
 satisfied 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:43.500
 that he was well ahead of the order with 831 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.500
 I have already done a few times 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.090
 one is way 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.680
 He would have to try other things 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.780
 by nana-shi calculator try to compare brush applied 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.650
 no one has already pleaded with me so I had that too 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:01.010
 second hand 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:03.100
 that is still around 5 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.400
 Polenz 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.410
 that is an internet access is so extreme 

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:12.079
 So I've been like that for years now 

00:02:12.079 --> 00:02:14.689
 but were 

00:02:14.689 --> 00:02:17.469
 I think because you apply the deductible 

00:02:17.469 --> 00:02:21.019
 it is a little bit so that now at the Steller Rough skin 

00:02:21.649 --> 00:02:25.009
 By doing that knows that is not so extreme 

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:26.919
 Rheine around 

00:02:26.919 --> 00:02:28.230
 that would have thought 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.969
 this step was 

00:02:30.969 --> 00:02:34.819
 what she knows is that the Steag Projectile is destined 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:35.659
 percent 

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:39.729
 Chiles on the cheek shine or something and that is then quite free 

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:42.729
 that's not the same with the team that it's rather a bit over the top 

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:45.939
 I know the business 

00:02:45.939 --> 00:02:50.089
 and I think I'm fine too, I'm subsidizing the 3 and that's me 

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:53.879
 not that works quite well because hackers did not mean Jensen Basic 

00:02:54.669 --> 00:02:56.529
 and here 

00:02:56.529 --> 00:02:58.519
 the simple ones were allowed to Beck 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:00.019
 around 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:02.819
 the announcement I no longer bought New Delhi 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:05.109
 I had no money because too few staff 

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:08.430
 it does not really stay something I'm not from failure as well 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.009
 Tehran 

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:12.429
 be first 

00:03:12.429 --> 00:03:16.790
 The bond to be called in the utilization is sequenced Haas 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.169
 i know i am a frugal she is 

00:03:19.169 --> 00:03:22.519
 and Georg she was very beautiful 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:25.520
 so it is not so special for his welfare 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:29.970
 this really great out so so properly positioned so I have so completely free 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.339
 leaves a pig out 

00:03:31.339 --> 00:03:32.849
 because she is so 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:35.509
 Harper 

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:38.939
 otherwise I'm serious about the situation it comes from the g2e 

00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:42.809
 which wishes picture I have smoked myself a piece because 

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:46.969
 for me at violent otherwise actually not what I would 

00:03:46.969 --> 00:03:49.969
 needed 

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:52.749
 does not always have something with 

00:03:52.749 --> 00:03:55.959
 it lets recognize 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:57.359
 this packaging 

00:03:57.359 --> 00:03:59.019
 Anette not at 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:03.099
 Arctic March clearly better Messi to those already familiar from the years 

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:08.519
 and i also want to pack it in donations of 30 years 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:10.899
 at SAP of it nothing except "Dirkules" 

00:04:10.899 --> 00:04:13.289
 but I mean Ernst Colmar like that 

00:04:13.289 --> 00:04:14.569
 serious 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:18.629
 David Zauner of KakÃ¡ Trieste i Schwarte crashes Eppinger or something 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:22.139
 correspondingly strong 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:27.430
 1 the packaging of the complaints 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:30.430
 at the 31 we are looking 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.620
 it is known that is at twelve to March together 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:36.580
 when RTS s 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.930
 as well the deflagration 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:43.979
 to consider that Hartz iv receivers do not complain Wolter 

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:46.979
 I have to die at all 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:49.370
 I have to say unfortunately 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:51.610
 that will not be so good with Ricky 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:55.330
 What I have these little ones is a bit of luck 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.439
 this one of a poor 

00:04:57.439 --> 00:05:00.419
 small packaged handkerchiefs 

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:03.540
 so lets Niqab Super and numerous great 

00:05:04.069 --> 00:05:07.089
 Unfortunately it is not so good under 

00:05:07.089 --> 00:05:09.229
 what did not refill 

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:12.159
 Percent the skin has burned a bit 

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:13.540
 when I did it 

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:15.460
 that was not so nice 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:19.790
 and since I of course that would have worked Karsai 2 and bought 

00:05:19.789 --> 00:05:21.259
 Meier 

00:05:21.259 --> 00:05:23.969
 Finally, Friday is the Lord 

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:26.189
 so if I have the hair 

00:05:26.189 --> 00:05:29.599
 The criticism is easy to buy what the show 

00:05:29.599 --> 00:05:32.599
 that it is not enough just to complain September 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.240
 okay the wrong thing to say before every other purchase used 

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:40.180
 short video 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:41.419
 Why 

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:43.669
 especially pleasant 

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:45.909
 athletic occurs Adam Parr videos 

00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:49.110
 I have not told you this yet 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:51.309
 Liebscher fabric shows 

00:05:51.309 --> 00:05:53.089
 but

 Basso 

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:56.919
 Citigroup does not suspect the overall concept 

00:05:57.619 --> 00:06:00.619
 a parked red have no time at school 

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:03.379
 I think so 

00:06:03.379 --> 00:06:06.379
 Either this or next week is going to send a lot of frustration 

00:06:07.029 --> 00:06:08.710
 only the press 

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:10.580
 Vintage it alike and
