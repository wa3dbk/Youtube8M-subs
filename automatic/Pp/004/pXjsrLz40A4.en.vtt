this device is actually very good one
place<00:01:45.810> I<00:01:46.020> have<00:01:46.290> noticed<00:01:46.710> that<00:01:46.770> it<00:01:47.009> heats<00:01:47.250> up<00:01:47.399> is

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
place I have noticed that it heats up is

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.120 
place I have noticed that it heats up is
while<00:01:48.299> charging<00:01:48.869> and<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.590> thing<00:01:49.770> will<00:01:49.920> start

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
while charging and the thing will start

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.670 
while charging and the thing will start
the<00:01:50.790> charge<00:01:51.060> is<00:01:51.210> supplied<00:01:51.329> as<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:52.049> quick

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
the charge is supplied as the quick

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.069 
the charge is supplied as the quick
charger<00:01:53.189> and<00:01:53.369> that's<00:01:53.759> common<00:01:54.180> in<00:01:54.299> fact<00:01:54.509> I<00:01:54.750> also

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
charger and that's common in fact I also

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.020 
charger and that's common in fact I also
experienced<00:01:55.950> a<00:01:56.040> heating<00:01:56.369> when<00:01:56.520> I<00:01:56.549> charged<00:01:56.850> the

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
experienced a heating when I charged the

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.179 
experienced a heating when I charged the
note<00:01:57.240> 4<00:01:57.479> and<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:57.719> galaxy<00:01:58.140> s6<00:01:58.439> because<00:01:59.040> they

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
note 4 and the galaxy s6 because they

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.190 
note 4 and the galaxy s6 because they
also<00:01:59.310> have<00:01:59.579> fast<00:01:59.909> charger<00:02:00.299> so<00:02:00.689> if<00:02:00.780> you<00:02:00.869> use<00:02:01.020> the

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
also have fast charger so if you use the

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.530 
also have fast charger so if you use the
supplied<00:02:01.560> charger<00:02:02.130> yes<00:02:02.610> while<00:02:02.880> charging<00:02:03.210> it

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
supplied charger yes while charging it

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.319 
supplied charger yes while charging it
will<00:02:03.719> sort<00:02:04.200> of<00:02:04.290> get<00:02:04.590> vom<00:02:04.890> but<00:02:05.100> don't<00:02:05.310> worry<00:02:05.490> it

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
will sort of get vom but don't worry it

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.139 
will sort of get vom but don't worry it
is<00:02:06.540> sort<00:02:06.930> of<00:02:06.990> normal<00:02:07.259> with<00:02:07.740> fast<00:02:08.160> chargers<00:02:08.759> so

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
is sort of normal with fast chargers so

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.390 
is sort of normal with fast chargers so
it<00:02:09.360> will<00:02:09.599> get<00:02:09.780> wrong<00:02:10.110> value<00:02:10.890> charge<00:02:11.190> and

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
it will get wrong value charge and

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
it will get wrong value charge and
regarding<00:02:11.910> the<00:02:12.030> charge

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
regarding the charge

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.130 
regarding the charge
time<00:02:12.800> when<00:02:13.800> it<00:02:13.950> was<00:02:14.130> around<00:02:14.340> at<00:02:14.580> 8%<00:02:15.210> and<00:02:15.660> I<00:02:15.960> use

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
time when it was around at 8% and I use

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.990 
time when it was around at 8% and I use
the<00:02:16.290> default<00:02:16.680> the<00:02:16.890> fast<00:02:17.160> charges<00:02:17.550> up<00:02:17.670> that

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
the default the fast charges up that

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.290 
the default the fast charges up that
Xiaomi<00:02:18.209> has<00:02:18.360> supplied<00:02:18.810> it<00:02:19.560> to<00:02:19.950> reach<00:02:20.340> 200%<00:02:21.060> it

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
Xiaomi has supplied it to reach 200% it

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.140 
Xiaomi has supplied it to reach 200% it
took<00:02:21.480> 2<00:02:21.930> hours<00:02:22.140> 15<00:02:22.740> minutes<00:02:23.160> but<00:02:23.640> I<00:02:23.700> did<00:02:24.000> notice

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
took 2 hours 15 minutes but I did notice

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.120 
took 2 hours 15 minutes but I did notice
that<00:02:24.330> if<00:02:24.540> you<00:02:24.660> use<00:02:24.810> generate<00:02:25.410> charges<00:02:25.950> the

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
that if you use generate charges the

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:28.100 
that if you use generate charges the
charging<00:02:26.520> time<00:02:26.700> is<00:02:26.730> actually<00:02:27.240> very<00:02:27.480> slow<00:02:27.840> it

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
charging time is actually very slow it

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.320 
charging time is actually very slow it
can<00:02:28.440> take<00:02:28.680> over<00:02:28.890> 3<00:02:29.220> and<00:02:29.370> a<00:02:29.430> half<00:02:29.640> hours<00:02:30.030> so

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
can take over 3 and a half hours so

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.180 
can take over 3 and a half hours so
don't<00:02:31.050> be<00:02:31.200> worried<00:02:31.380> just<00:02:31.560> use<00:02:31.770> the<00:02:31.890> supplied

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
don't be worried just use the supplied

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.250 
don't be worried just use the supplied
charge<00:02:32.430> up<00:02:32.610> but<00:02:32.970> yes<00:02:33.209> it<00:02:33.450> will<00:02:33.690> get<00:02:33.930> a<00:02:34.110> little

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
charge up but yes it will get a little

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.550 
charge up but yes it will get a little
bit<00:02:34.530> warm<00:02:35.120> let's<00:02:36.120> actually<00:02:36.360> now<00:02:36.630> divide<00:02:37.410> it

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
bit warm let's actually now divide it

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.020 
bit warm let's actually now divide it
between<00:02:37.680> the<00:02:37.980> pros<00:02:38.220> and<00:02:38.400> the<00:02:38.459> cons<00:02:38.520> are<00:02:38.820> made<00:02:39.000> a

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
between the pros and the cons are made a

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.479 
between the pros and the cons are made a
list<00:02:39.300> first<00:02:39.780> let's<00:02:40.050> talk<00:02:40.350> about<00:02:40.410> the<00:02:40.709> things

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
list first let's talk about the things

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:43.580 
list first let's talk about the things
that<00:02:41.670> I<00:02:41.700> don't<00:02:41.819> like<00:02:42.150> that<00:02:42.180> other<00:02:42.480> cons<00:02:42.870> the

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
that I don't like that other cons the

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.740 
that I don't like that other cons the
first<00:02:43.830> thing<00:02:43.950> that<00:02:43.980> I<00:02:44.130> don't<00:02:44.250> did<00:02:45.120> not<00:02:45.270> like<00:02:45.510> is

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
first thing that I don't did not like is

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.440 
first thing that I don't did not like is
the<00:02:46.680> capacitive<00:02:47.459> buttons<00:02:47.790> at<00:02:47.910> the<00:02:47.940> bottom

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
the capacitive buttons at the bottom

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.920 
the capacitive buttons at the bottom
they<00:02:49.170> are<00:02:49.200> actually<00:02:49.770> backlight<00:02:50.310> and<00:02:50.510> but<00:02:51.510> the

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
they are actually backlight and but the

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:54.080 
they are actually backlight and but the
light<00:02:52.110> is<00:02:52.290> showed<00:02:52.530> them<00:02:52.769> that<00:02:52.950> during<00:02:53.790> the<00:02:53.910> day

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
light is showed them that during the day

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.430 
light is showed them that during the day
it's<00:02:54.300> hardly<00:02:54.690> visible<00:02:54.840> they<00:02:55.200> are<00:02:55.260> only

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
it's hardly visible they are only

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.009 
it's hardly visible they are only
visible<00:02:55.830> at<00:02:56.100> night<00:02:56.400> so<00:02:57.209> they<00:02:57.660> should<00:02:57.870> have

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
visible at night so they should have

00:02:58.019 --> 00:02:59.780 
visible at night so they should have
been<00:02:58.200> a<00:02:58.230> little<00:02:58.470> bit<00:02:58.680> brighter<00:02:59.040> the<00:02:59.580> same

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
been a little bit brighter the same

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.910 
been a little bit brighter the same
thing<00:03:00.000> is<00:03:00.180> for<00:03:00.510> the<00:03:00.660> LED<00:03:01.050> notification<00:03:01.170> also

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
thing is for the LED notification also

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.910 
thing is for the LED notification also
that's<00:03:02.430> also<00:03:02.820> over<00:03:03.000> here<00:03:03.209> and<00:03:03.480> it's<00:03:03.870> yeah<00:03:04.709> it

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
that's also over here and it's yeah it

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:05.449 
that's also over here and it's yeah it
works

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
works

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:07.729 
works

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
up very lightly so in bright environment

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.550 
up very lightly so in bright environment
it's<00:03:10.260> hardly<00:03:10.620> visible<00:03:11.040> also<00:03:11.700> the<00:03:12.510> biggest<00:03:13.350> con

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
it's hardly visible also the biggest con

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.020 
it's hardly visible also the biggest con
with<00:03:13.739> this<00:03:13.860> device<00:03:14.130> is<00:03:14.340> that<00:03:14.370> it<00:03:14.790> does<00:03:15.000> not

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
with this device is that it does not

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.720 
with this device is that it does not
have<00:03:15.390> any<00:03:15.570> 4G<00:03:16.080> support<00:03:16.230> in<00:03:16.560> India<00:03:16.829> so<00:03:17.280> yeah<00:03:17.459> it

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
have any 4G support in India so yeah it

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.210 
have any 4G support in India so yeah it
will<00:03:17.970> just<00:03:18.150> work<00:03:18.239> with<00:03:18.600> 2g<00:03:19.019> and<00:03:19.230> 3G<00:03:19.650> in<00:03:19.829> India

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
will just work with 2g and 3G in India

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.910 
will just work with 2g and 3G in India
but<00:03:20.760> I<00:03:20.850> so<00:03:21.060> for<00:03:21.209> this<00:03:21.329> 15,000<00:03:22.019> version<00:03:22.290> is<00:03:22.410> for

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
but I so for this 15,000 version is for

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.740 
but I so for this 15,000 version is for
the<00:03:23.040> 16<00:03:23.400> gig<00:03:23.579> variant<00:03:23.940> and<00:03:24.090> out<00:03:24.180> of<00:03:24.269> that<00:03:24.360> 16

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
the 16 gig variant and out of that 16

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.380 
the 16 gig variant and out of that 16
gigs<00:03:24.989> you<00:03:25.410> get<00:03:25.620> just<00:03:25.860> 12<00:03:26.160> gigabytes<00:03:27.090> of<00:03:27.239> space

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390 
gigs you get just 12 gigabytes of space

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.569 
gigs you get just 12 gigabytes of space
that<00:03:27.660> is<00:03:27.720> available<00:03:28.230> to<00:03:28.350> you<00:03:28.500> and<00:03:28.680> that<00:03:29.340> is<00:03:29.489> the

that is available to you and that is the
space<00:03:29.760> that<00:03:29.820> you<00:03:30.060> get<00:03:30.209> because<00:03:30.360> this<00:03:30.630> device

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
space that you get because this device

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:33.350 
space that you get because this device
does<00:03:31.260> not<00:03:31.290> have<00:03:31.470> any<00:03:31.829> micro<00:03:32.220> SD<00:03:32.549> card<00:03:32.790> slot<00:03:32.850> so

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
does not have any micro SD card slot so

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.050 
does not have any micro SD card slot so

gigabytes<00:03:38.600> also<00:03:39.600> I<00:03:39.630> do<00:03:39.870> not<00:03:40.110> like<00:03:40.320> the<00:03:40.530> back

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
gigabytes also I do not like the back

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.080 
gigabytes also I do not like the back
actually<00:03:41.130> I<00:03:41.340> have<00:03:41.430> changed<00:03:41.700> the<00:03:41.760> back<00:03:41.910> if<00:03:42.060> you

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
actually I have changed the back if you

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.930 
actually I have changed the back if you
notice<00:03:42.450> the<00:03:42.959> default<00:03:43.140> back<00:03:43.950> is<00:03:44.160> the<00:03:44.340> white<00:03:44.579> one

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
notice the default back is the white one

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:47.120 
notice the default back is the white one
it<00:03:45.209> was<00:03:45.540> very<00:03:45.840> slippery<00:03:46.350> so<00:03:46.620> I<00:03:46.650> have<00:03:46.920> just

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
it was very slippery so I have just

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:50.360 
it was very slippery so I have just
changed<00:03:47.400> to<00:03:48.269> this<00:03:48.420> wooden<00:03:49.230> back<00:03:49.440> already<00:03:50.220> made

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
changed to this wooden back already made

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:51.830 
changed to this wooden back already made
a<00:03:50.400> video<00:03:50.610> regarding<00:03:51.030> that<00:03:51.180> it's<00:03:51.510> actually

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
a video regarding that it's actually

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.050 
a video regarding that it's actually
pretty<00:03:52.019> easy<00:03:52.110> to<00:03:52.440> change<00:03:52.650> so<00:03:53.400> with<00:03:53.640> this<00:03:53.790> new

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
pretty easy to change so with this new

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.270 
pretty easy to change so with this new
back<00:03:54.269> it's<00:03:54.720> a<00:03:54.840> lot<00:03:55.049> less<00:03:55.260> slippery<00:03:55.650> but<00:03:55.950> the

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
back it's a lot less slippery but the

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.880 
back it's a lot less slippery but the
default<00:03:56.670> back<00:03:57.420> was<00:03:57.870> not<00:03:58.140> that<00:03:58.350> great<00:03:58.590> it<00:03:58.739> was

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
default back was not that great it was

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:01.130 
default back was not that great it was
very<00:03:59.160> slippery<00:03:59.519> and<00:03:59.790> gave<00:04:00.299> a<00:04:00.329> very<00:04:00.390> plasticy

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
very slippery and gave a very plasticy

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:04.880 
very slippery and gave a very plasticy
feel<00:04:01.920> also<00:04:02.579> the<00:04:03.120> thing<00:04:03.269> is<00:04:03.390> that<00:04:03.510> still<00:04:04.200> this

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
feel also the thing is that still this

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:08.210 
feel also the thing is that still this

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
update hasn't come till now also I for

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:15.170 
update hasn't come till now also I for
the<00:04:12.540> most<00:04:12.600> part<00:04:12.989> it<00:04:13.200> is<00:04:13.260> actually<00:04:14.180> performs

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
the most part it is actually performs

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.449 
the most part it is actually performs
very<00:04:15.390> well<00:04:15.480> and<00:04:15.780> it's<00:04:15.900> almost<00:04:16.320> lag<00:04:16.709> free<00:04:17.010> but<00:04:17.430> I

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
very well and it's almost lag free but I

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:19.960 
very well and it's almost lag free but I
still<00:04:17.789> notice<00:04:18.180> some<00:04:18.510> lag<00:04:18.780> here<00:04:19.140> and<00:04:19.380> there

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:19.970 
still notice some lag here and there

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:21.340 
still notice some lag here and there
particularly

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:21.350 
particularly

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:23.350 
particularly
in<00:04:21.380> the<00:04:21.530> Twitter<00:04:21.830> app<00:04:22.100> I<00:04:22.280> noticed<00:04:22.700> that<00:04:22.910> when

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 
in the Twitter app I noticed that when

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.200 
in the Twitter app I noticed that when
you<00:04:23.510> scroll<00:04:23.870> it<00:04:24.440> actually<00:04:25.310> exhibits<00:04:25.820> a<00:04:25.970> little

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.210 
you scroll it actually exhibits a little

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:28.540 
you scroll it actually exhibits a little
bit<00:04:26.360> of<00:04:26.540> lag<00:04:26.780> and<00:04:27.050> sometimes<00:04:27.800> in<00:04:28.040> some<00:04:28.070> of<00:04:28.430> the

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:28.550 
bit of lag and sometimes in some of the

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:31.870 
bit of lag and sometimes in some of the
menus<00:04:28.820> I<00:04:28.970> notice<00:04:29.360> minor<00:04:29.690> lack<00:04:30.080> but<00:04:30.880> overall

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:31.880 
menus I notice minor lack but overall

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.240 
menus I notice minor lack but overall
apart<00:04:32.540> from<00:04:32.690> that<00:04:32.900> minor<00:04:33.230> hiccups<00:04:33.680> overall

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.250 
apart from that minor hiccups overall

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:36.460 
apart from that minor hiccups overall
the<00:04:34.400> performance<00:04:34.850> of<00:04:35.000> the<00:04:35.090> phone<00:04:35.270> was<00:04:35.570> good

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:36.470 
the performance of the phone was good

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:40.090 
the performance of the phone was good
also<00:04:37.430> when<00:04:37.640> we<00:04:37.760> move<00:04:37.940> to<00:04:37.970> the<00:04:38.830> rear<00:04:39.830> facing

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:40.100 
also when we move to the rear facing

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:41.650 
also when we move to the rear facing
camera<00:04:40.610> I<00:04:40.790> will<00:04:40.970> check<00:04:41.210> the<00:04:41.300> rear<00:04:41.450> facing

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:41.660 
camera I will check the rear facing

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:43.990 
camera I will check the rear facing
camera<00:04:42.050> is<00:04:42.170> good<00:04:42.440> in<00:04:42.620> outdoor<00:04:43.070> conditions<00:04:43.580> but

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:44.000 
camera is good in outdoor conditions but

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.240 
camera is good in outdoor conditions but
again<00:04:44.390> I<00:04:44.570> noticed<00:04:45.110> that<00:04:45.260> in<00:04:45.470> indoor<00:04:46.040> lighting

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:46.250 
again I noticed that in indoor lighting

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:48.430 
again I noticed that in indoor lighting
conditions<00:04:47.000> and<00:04:47.210> in<00:04:47.720> dimly<00:04:48.050> lighting

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:48.440 
conditions and in dimly lighting

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.710 
conditions and in dimly lighting
conditions<00:04:48.950> there<00:04:49.550> is<00:04:49.820> fair<00:04:50.090> bit<00:04:50.330> of<00:04:50.480> noise

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:50.720 
conditions there is fair bit of noise

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:52.390 
conditions there is fair bit of noise
and<00:04:51.080> you<00:04:51.200> have<00:04:51.350> to<00:04:51.470> be<00:04:51.560> careful<00:04:51.920> otherwise<00:04:52.040> the

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.400 
and you have to be careful otherwise the

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.010 
and you have to be careful otherwise the
pictures<00:04:52.730> really<00:04:53.000> come<00:04:53.360> out<00:04:53.390> to<00:04:53.510> be<00:04:53.660> a<00:04:53.750> little

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:54.020 
pictures really come out to be a little

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:57.160 
pictures really come out to be a little
bit<00:04:54.140> shaky<00:04:55.070> also<00:04:56.030> another<00:04:56.390> corner<00:04:56.810> again<00:04:57.050> you

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:57.170 
bit shaky also another corner again you

00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:00.190 
bit shaky also another corner again you
sort<00:04:58.040> of<00:04:58.100> get<00:04:58.370> used<00:04:58.760> to<00:04:59.120> it<00:04:59.300> but<00:04:59.690> it's<00:04:59.960> slightly

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:00.200 
sort of get used to it but it's slightly

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:03.550 
sort of get used to it but it's slightly
heavy<00:05:00.620> for<00:05:01.010> a<00:05:01.040> five<00:05:01.400> inch<00:05:01.930> screen<00:05:02.930> I<00:05:03.140> would<00:05:03.380> say

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:03.560 
heavy for a five inch screen I would say

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:05.980 
heavy for a five inch screen I would say
and<00:05:03.830> now<00:05:04.460> let's<00:05:04.670> move<00:05:04.910> to<00:05:05.090> the<00:05:05.210> things<00:05:05.780> that<00:05:05.960> I

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:05.990 
and now let's move to the things that I

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:08.230 
and now let's move to the things that I
like<00:05:06.290> and<00:05:06.320> the<00:05:06.620> pros<00:05:07.010> about<00:05:07.310> this<00:05:07.490> device<00:05:07.790> the

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:08.240 
like and the pros about this device the

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:09.910 
like and the pros about this device the
first<00:05:08.510> thing<00:05:08.690> is<00:05:08.900> the<00:05:09.080> performance<00:05:09.560> overall

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:09.920 
first thing is the performance overall

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:11.950 
first thing is the performance overall
performance<00:05:10.250> is<00:05:10.580> actually<00:05:10.940> very<00:05:11.090> nice<00:05:11.330> and<00:05:11.570> it

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:11.960 
performance is actually very nice and it

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:14.710 
performance is actually very nice and it
still<00:05:12.950> is<00:05:13.220> a<00:05:13.250> pretty<00:05:13.640> powerful<00:05:13.880> device<00:05:14.480> it

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:14.720 
still is a pretty powerful device it

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.780 
still is a pretty powerful device it
comes<00:05:15.320> with<00:05:15.440> a<00:05:15.470> quad<00:05:15.770> core<00:05:15.950> processor<00:05:16.010> that's

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:16.790 
comes with a quad core processor that's

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:19.300 
comes with a quad core processor that's
based<00:05:17.060> on<00:05:17.210> the<00:05:17.330> Snapdragon<00:05:17.990> 801<00:05:18.500> chipset<00:05:19.130> it

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:19.310 
based on the Snapdragon 801 chipset it

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:21.370 
based on the Snapdragon 801 chipset it
has<00:05:19.460> three<00:05:19.700> gigs<00:05:19.940> of<00:05:20.090> RAM<00:05:20.270> so<00:05:20.630> it's<00:05:20.870> still<00:05:21.350> a

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:21.380 
has three gigs of RAM so it's still a

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:24.280 
has three gigs of RAM so it's still a
very<00:05:21.650> powerful<00:05:22.280> device<00:05:22.430> I<00:05:23.210> also<00:05:23.750> like<00:05:24.050> the

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:24.290 
very powerful device I also like the

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:26.020 
very powerful device I also like the
front-facing<00:05:24.650> camera<00:05:25.220> as<00:05:25.370> well<00:05:25.610> as<00:05:25.670> the<00:05:25.880> rear

as<00:05:32.300> you<00:05:32.420> can<00:05:32.510> see<00:05:32.570> the<00:05:32.930> picture<00:05:33.230> quality<00:05:33.320> is

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:33.740 
as you can see the picture quality is

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:36.610 
as you can see the picture quality is
actually<00:05:34.550> very<00:05:35.060> good<00:05:35.360> regarding<00:05:36.290> this<00:05:36.380> part

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:36.620 
actually very good regarding this part

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:37.750 
actually very good regarding this part
of<00:05:36.740> the<00:05:36.800> footage<00:05:37.070> with<00:05:37.220> the<00:05:37.250> front-facing

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:37.760 
of the footage with the front-facing

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:40.390 
of the footage with the front-facing
camera<00:05:38.270> of<00:05:38.420> the<00:05:38.630> mean<00:05:38.870> four<00:05:39.290> and<00:05:39.620> this<00:05:40.190> is<00:05:40.310> an

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:40.400 
camera of the mean four and this is an

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.010 
camera of the mean four and this is an
outdoor<00:05:40.760> candy<00:05:41.150> since<00:05:41.360> there's<00:05:41.600> a<00:05:41.720> little<00:05:41.930> bit

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:42.020 
outdoor candy since there's a little bit

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:43.870 
outdoor candy since there's a little bit
of<00:05:42.110> wind<00:05:42.290> so<00:05:42.470> they<00:05:42.620> might<00:05:42.830> be<00:05:42.980> with<00:05:43.160> noise<00:05:43.340> now

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:43.880 
of wind so they might be with noise now

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:45.280 
of wind so they might be with noise now
I'll<00:05:43.940> just<00:05:44.030> move<00:05:44.270> the<00:05:44.480> camera<00:05:44.690> against<00:05:45.140> the

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:45.290 
I'll just move the camera against the

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:47.050 
I'll just move the camera against the
light<00:05:45.470> to<00:05:45.770> see<00:05:45.950> how<00:05:46.160> it<00:05:46.340> handles<00:05:46.670> abrupt

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:47.060 
light to see how it handles abrupt

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:49.660 
light to see how it handles abrupt
lighting<00:05:47.450> conditions<00:05:47.990> for<00:05:48.680> example<00:05:49.190> this<00:05:49.520> is

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:49.670 
lighting conditions for example this is

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:52.150 
lighting conditions for example this is
pretty<00:05:49.880> bad<00:05:50.270> lighting<00:05:50.510> conditions<00:05:51.140> but<00:05:51.380> let's

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:52.160 
pretty bad lighting conditions but let's

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.640 
pretty bad lighting conditions but let's
see<00:05:52.340> how<00:05:52.460> it<00:05:52.640> handles<00:05:52.670> it<00:05:53.180> and<00:05:53.450> as<00:05:54.230> you<00:05:54.320> can<00:05:54.470> see

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:54.650 
see how it handles it and as you can see

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:57.310 
see how it handles it and as you can see
in<00:05:55.250> outdoor<00:05:55.610> lighting<00:05:55.790> if<00:05:56.780> you<00:05:56.930> adjust<00:05:57.230> the

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:57.320 
in outdoor lighting if you adjust the

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:59.470 
in outdoor lighting if you adjust the
angle<00:05:57.710> the<00:05:58.370> video<00:05:58.640> quality<00:05:58.970> seems<00:05:59.180> to<00:05:59.360> be

00:05:59.470 --> 00:05:59.480 
angle the video quality seems to be

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:01.630 
angle the video quality seems to be
pretty<00:05:59.900> good<00:06:00.140> with<00:06:00.320> the<00:06:00.410> front-facing<00:06:01.040> camera

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:01.640 
pretty good with the front-facing camera

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:03.460 
pretty good with the front-facing camera
recording<00:06:02.480> this<00:06:02.600> part<00:06:02.840> of<00:06:02.930> the<00:06:03.020> footage<00:06:03.320> I

of<00:06:10.460> pretty<00:06:10.700> low<00:06:10.970> lighting<00:06:11.450> so<00:06:11.810> this<00:06:12.020> should

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:12.200 
of pretty low lighting so this should

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:13.450 
of pretty low lighting so this should
give<00:06:12.350> me<00:06:12.380> an<00:06:12.500> idea<00:06:12.620> how<00:06:12.950> will<00:06:13.130> be<00:06:13.220> the<00:06:13.340> video

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:13.460 
give me an idea how will be the video

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:14.950

fair bit of noise and you have to be

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:23.050 
fair bit of noise and you have to be
careful<00:06:21.890> otherwise<00:06:21.980> the<00:06:22.340> pictures<00:06:22.670> will<00:06:22.880> come
