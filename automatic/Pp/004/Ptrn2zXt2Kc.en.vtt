we're gonna get back and get more active
in<00:00:18.000> everything<00:00:18.210> so<00:00:18.570> anyway<00:00:19.289> in<00:00:19.439> this<00:00:19.560> video<00:00:19.859> I

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070

in everything so anyway in this video I
wanted<00:00:20.609> to<00:00:20.670> test<00:00:21.000> out<00:00:21.240> and<00:00:21.539> kind<00:00:21.720> of<00:00:21.779> show<00:00:21.990> you

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
wanted to test out and kind of show you

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.290 
wanted to test out and kind of show you
guys<00:00:22.320> what<00:00:22.710> stability<00:00:23.460> can<00:00:23.699> do<00:00:23.850> for<00:00:24.090> you<00:00:24.150> the

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
guys what stability can do for you the

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.849 
guys what stability can do for you the
weapon<00:00:24.570> proficiency<00:00:25.140> that's<00:00:25.289> available<00:00:25.560> on

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
weapon proficiency that's available on

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.580 
weapon proficiency that's available on
assault<00:00:26.130> rifles<00:00:26.250> because<00:00:26.970> it<00:00:27.359> is<00:00:27.590> extremely

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
assault rifles because it is extremely

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:29.779 
assault rifles because it is extremely
good<00:00:28.859> and<00:00:29.099> I've<00:00:29.160> been<00:00:29.279> messing<00:00:29.550> around<00:00:29.580> with

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
good and I've been messing around with

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.189 
good and I've been messing around with
it<00:00:29.939> lately<00:00:30.119> and<00:00:30.420> I've<00:00:30.689> really<00:00:30.960> been<00:00:31.080> enjoying

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
it lately and I've really been enjoying

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:32.810 
it lately and I've really been enjoying
it<00:00:31.529> and<00:00:31.650> I<00:00:31.740> think<00:00:31.800> I<00:00:32.099> might<00:00:32.279> like<00:00:32.520> it<00:00:32.700> better

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
it and I think I might like it better

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.000 
it and I think I might like it better
than<00:00:33.030> kicks<00:00:33.300> so<00:00:33.570> let's<00:00:34.200> get<00:00:34.290> into<00:00:34.500> this<00:00:34.590> now<00:00:34.800> a

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
than kicks so let's get into this now a

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.920 
than kicks so let's get into this now a
stability<00:00:35.520> what<00:00:36.030> it<00:00:36.120> does<00:00:36.300> is<00:00:36.510> it<00:00:36.750> decreases

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
stability what it does is it decreases

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.080 
stability what it does is it decreases
the<00:00:37.500> weapon<00:00:37.829> sway<00:00:38.160> when<00:00:38.460> you're<00:00:38.579> aiming<00:00:38.940> down

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
the weapon sway when you're aiming down

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.270 
the weapon sway when you're aiming down
sights<00:00:39.510> so<00:00:39.780> to<00:00:40.410> test<00:00:40.559> this<00:00:40.680> out<00:00:40.860> I<00:00:40.890> just<00:00:41.100> showed

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
sights so to test this out I just showed

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.200 
sights so to test this out I just showed
you<00:00:41.370> guys<00:00:41.430> here<00:00:41.820> that

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
you guys here that

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.700 
you guys here that
aiming<00:00:42.540> down<00:00:42.629> sight<00:00:42.870> with<00:00:43.020> a<00:00:43.050> kick<00:00:43.260> weapon<00:00:43.590> the

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
aiming down sight with a kick weapon the

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.770 
aiming down sight with a kick weapon the
blue<00:00:43.890> tiger<00:00:44.100> m4<00:00:44.610> you<00:00:45.000> can<00:00:45.149> see<00:00:45.300> that<00:00:45.480> it<00:00:45.570> moves

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
blue tiger m4 you can see that it moves

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.150 
blue tiger m4 you can see that it moves
quite<00:00:46.020> a<00:00:46.079> bit<00:00:46.320> you<00:00:46.410> know<00:00:46.469> it<00:00:46.649> goes<00:00:46.739> up<00:00:46.950> and<00:00:47.129> down

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
quite a bit you know it goes up and down

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.799 
quite a bit you know it goes up and down
side<00:00:47.550> to<00:00:47.700> side<00:00:47.879> it<00:00:48.120> has<00:00:48.239> a<00:00:48.270> good<00:00:48.510> amount<00:00:48.570> of

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
side to side it has a good amount of

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.540 
side to side it has a good amount of
area<00:00:49.079> that<00:00:49.140> it<00:00:49.320> covers<00:00:49.590> now<00:00:49.770> when<00:00:50.219> we<00:00:50.340> switch

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
area that it covers now when we switch

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.850 
area that it covers now when we switch
over<00:00:50.850> to<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:51.090> red<00:00:51.270> tiger<00:00:51.600> m4<00:00:52.020> this<00:00:52.469> one<00:00:52.710> has

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
over to the red tiger m4 this one has

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.260 
over to the red tiger m4 this one has
stability<00:00:53.100> on<00:00:53.489> it<00:00:53.610> and<00:00:53.760> you're<00:00:53.879> gonna<00:00:53.969> see

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
stability on it and you're gonna see

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.029 
stability on it and you're gonna see
that<00:00:54.480> it<00:00:54.870> still<00:00:55.170> moves<00:00:55.440> you<00:00:55.649> know<00:00:55.739> it's<00:00:55.890> not

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
that it still moves you know it's not

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.010 
that it still moves you know it's not
completely<00:00:56.460> still<00:00:56.789> but<00:00:57.300> it's<00:00:57.420> definitely<00:00:57.719> a

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
completely still but it's definitely a

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.740 
completely still but it's definitely a
lot<00:00:58.530> less<00:00:59.219> movement<00:01:00.030> you<00:01:00.120> know<00:01:00.239> it<00:01:00.420> covers<00:01:00.719> a

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
lot less movement you know it covers a

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.240 
lot less movement you know it covers a
lot<00:01:01.020> smaller<00:01:01.320> area<00:01:01.620> and<00:01:01.649> here<00:01:01.829> you<00:01:01.920> can<00:01:02.070> see

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
lot smaller area and here you can see

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.950 
lot smaller area and here you can see
side-by-side<00:01:02.489> that<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.449> one<00:01:03.600> on<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:03.780> right

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
side-by-side that the one on the right

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.230 
side-by-side that the one on the right
with<00:01:04.140> stability<00:01:04.589> is<00:01:04.739> a<00:01:04.949> much<00:01:05.400> smaller<00:01:05.820> area

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
with stability is a much smaller area

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.570 
with stability is a much smaller area
that<00:01:06.990> that<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.650> reticle<00:01:08.010> is<00:01:08.100> swinging<00:01:08.460> around

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
that that the reticle is swinging around

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.340 
that that the reticle is swinging around
in<00:01:09.030> so<00:01:09.270> that's<00:01:09.689> a<00:01:09.869> good<00:01:09.990> thing<00:01:10.049> you<00:01:10.290> know

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
in so that's a good thing you know

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.539 
in so that's a good thing you know
that's<00:01:10.590> gonna<00:01:10.710> help<00:01:10.860> you<00:01:11.040> and<00:01:11.159> help<00:01:11.280> you<00:01:11.369> when

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
that's gonna help you and help you when

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.580 
that's gonna help you and help you when
your<00:01:11.640> gun<00:01:11.760> fights<00:01:12.000> but<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.630> question<00:01:13.020> is<00:01:13.229> how

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
your gun fights but the question is how

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.140 
your gun fights but the question is how
exactly<00:01:13.830> does<00:01:14.400> it<00:01:14.430> help<00:01:14.700> you<00:01:14.820> these<00:01:15.000> are

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
exactly does it help you these are

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.149 
exactly does it help you these are
certain<00:01:15.450> guns<00:01:15.659> that<00:01:15.960> it's<00:01:16.080> better<00:01:16.320> on<00:01:16.409> and<00:01:16.890> you

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
certain guns that it's better on and you

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.039 
certain guns that it's better on and you
know<00:01:17.250> stuff<00:01:17.490> like<00:01:17.700> that<00:01:17.850> now<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.630> first<00:01:18.869> thing

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
know stuff like that now the first thing

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.590 
know stuff like that now the first thing
I<00:01:19.140> tested<00:01:19.590> was<00:01:19.979> kick<00:01:20.310> versus<00:01:20.700> stability<00:01:21.180> just

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
I tested was kick versus stability just

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.090 
I tested was kick versus stability just
on<00:01:21.750> straight-up<00:01:22.170> recoil<00:01:22.710> you<00:01:22.799> know<00:01:22.890> does

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
on straight-up recoil you know does

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.890 
on straight-up recoil you know does
somehow<00:01:23.369> stability<00:01:24.119> mess<00:01:24.270> with<00:01:24.450> the<00:01:24.540> recoil

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
somehow stability mess with the recoil

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.690 
somehow stability mess with the recoil
and<00:01:25.020> answer<00:01:25.680> is<00:01:25.799> no<00:01:26.009> so<00:01:26.250> you're<00:01:26.369> gonna<00:01:26.520> see

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
and answer is no so you're gonna see

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.460 
and answer is no so you're gonna see
here<00:01:26.939> I<00:01:26.970> sprayed<00:01:27.360> at<00:01:27.479> a<00:01:27.540> wall<00:01:27.750> on<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.229> left

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
here I sprayed at a wall on the left

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.130 
here I sprayed at a wall on the left
side<00:01:28.619> is<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.100> kick<00:01:29.310> kind<00:01:29.729> of<00:01:29.909> pattern<00:01:30.540> and<00:01:30.750> on

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
side is the kick kind of pattern and on

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.080 
side is the kick kind of pattern and on
the<00:01:31.290> right<00:01:31.470> side<00:01:31.740> is<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.070> stability<00:01:32.520> pattern

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
the right side is the stability pattern

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.300 
the right side is the stability pattern
and<00:01:33.329> as<00:01:33.840> what<00:01:34.229> would<00:01:34.380> be<00:01:34.500> expected<00:01:34.740> to<00:01:35.070> kick

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
and as what would be expected to kick

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.560 
and as what would be expected to kick
pattern<00:01:35.640> is<00:01:35.790> small<00:01:35.970> you<00:01:36.000> know<00:01:36.180> cuz<00:01:36.329> if<00:01:36.450> you're

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
pattern is small you know cuz if you're

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.450 
pattern is small you know cuz if you're
just<00:01:36.750> straight-up<00:01:37.079> spraying<00:01:37.619> then<00:01:38.220> kicks

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
just straight-up spraying then kicks

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.679 
just straight-up spraying then kicks
gonna<00:01:38.700> beat<00:01:38.880> it<00:01:38.970> every<00:01:39.150> time<00:01:39.299> because<00:01:39.450> it's

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
gonna beat it every time because it's

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.149 
gonna beat it every time because it's
meant<00:01:39.930> to<00:01:39.990> reduce<00:01:40.320> recoil<00:01:40.530> so<00:01:40.920> that's<00:01:41.070> gonna

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
meant to reduce recoil so that's gonna

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.530 
meant to reduce recoil so that's gonna
make<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.460> pattern<00:01:41.729> closer<00:01:41.970> together<00:01:42.180> now

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
make the pattern closer together now

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.840 
make the pattern closer together now
we're<00:01:43.320> stability<00:01:43.799> actually<00:01:44.189> helps<00:01:44.490> you<00:01:44.670> is

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
we're stability actually helps you is

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.539 
we're stability actually helps you is
within<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:45.689> first<00:01:45.960> couple<00:01:46.409> of<00:01:46.470> shots<00:01:46.530> so<00:01:46.979> like

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
within the first couple of shots so like

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.370 
within the first couple of shots so like
kick<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:48.270> first<00:01:48.509> couple<00:01:48.780> shots<00:01:48.930> might<00:01:49.200> be<00:01:49.350> a

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
kick the first couple shots might be a

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.020 
kick the first couple shots might be a
little<00:01:49.530> bit<00:01:49.710> off<00:01:49.799> target<00:01:50.040> but<00:01:50.520> everything<00:01:50.939> is

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
little bit off target but everything is

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.249 
little bit off target but everything is
going<00:01:51.119> to<00:01:51.210> be<00:01:51.299> kind<00:01:51.540> of<00:01:51.689> like<00:01:51.960> decent

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
going to be kind of like decent

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:53.870 
going to be kind of like decent
everything's<00:01:52.829> gonna<00:01:52.950> be<00:01:53.159> okay

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
everything's gonna be okay

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.330 
everything's gonna be okay
whereas<00:01:54.420> with<00:01:54.689> stability<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.829> first<00:01:56.070> couple

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
whereas with stability the first couple

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.709 
whereas with stability the first couple
of<00:01:56.399> shots<00:01:56.610> are<00:01:56.820> going<00:01:56.939> to<00:01:57.030> be<00:01:57.119> really<00:01:57.570> on

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
of shots are going to be really on

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.810 
of shots are going to be really on
target<00:01:58.049> because<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.500> gun<00:01:58.680> moves<00:01:59.009> less<00:01:59.310> but

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
target because the gun moves less but

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.429 
target because the gun moves less but
then<00:01:59.969> the<00:02:00.090> ones<00:02:00.299> after<00:02:00.479> that<00:02:00.689> are<00:02:01.079> gonna<00:02:01.200> be<00:02:01.409> a

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
then the ones after that are gonna be a

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:02.990 
then the ones after that are gonna be a
little<00:02:01.680> bit<00:02:01.860> out<00:02:02.009> there<00:02:02.280> because<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.820> recoil

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
little bit out there because the recoil

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.760 
little bit out there because the recoil
starts<00:02:03.570> to<00:02:03.689> go<00:02:03.810> crazy<00:02:03.840> like<00:02:04.380> a<00:02:04.409> gun<00:02:04.619> without

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
starts to go crazy like a gun without

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.429 
starts to go crazy like a gun without
any<00:02:04.920> proficiency<00:02:05.640> on<00:02:05.670> it<00:02:05.850> so<00:02:06.060> that's<00:02:06.960> where<00:02:07.290> it

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
any proficiency on it so that's where it

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.229 
any proficiency on it so that's where it
helps<00:02:07.680> you<00:02:07.829> out<00:02:07.860> and<00:02:08.129> how<00:02:08.399> I<00:02:08.429> tested<00:02:08.849> this<00:02:08.970> was

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
helps you out and how I tested this was

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.570 
helps you out and how I tested this was
I<00:02:09.450> sprayed<00:02:10.080> in<00:02:10.170> a<00:02:10.229> wall<00:02:10.440> except<00:02:11.039> this<00:02:11.160> time<00:02:11.400> I

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
I sprayed in a wall except this time I

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.460 
I sprayed in a wall except this time I
didn't<00:02:11.849> go<00:02:11.940> full<00:02:12.239> auto<00:02:12.450> I<00:02:12.870> just<00:02:13.170> burn

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
didn't go full auto I just burn

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.800 
didn't go full auto I just burn
fired<00:02:13.770> it<00:02:13.920> so<00:02:14.130> I<00:02:14.310> zoomed<00:02:14.820> in<00:02:15.030> burst<00:02:15.480> fired

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
fired it so I zoomed in burst fired

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.780 
fired it so I zoomed in burst fired
zoomed<00:02:16.200> out<00:02:16.380> zoomed<00:02:16.800> in<00:02:16.980> burst<00:02:17.250> fired<00:02:17.520> zoomed

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
zoomed out zoomed in burst fired zoomed

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.460 
zoomed out zoomed in burst fired zoomed
out<00:02:17.910> and<00:02:18.150> as<00:02:18.690> you're<00:02:18.810> gonna<00:02:18.930> see<00:02:19.080> here<00:02:19.320> I

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
out and as you're gonna see here I

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.170 
out and as you're gonna see here I
tested<00:02:20.010> it<00:02:20.070> like<00:02:20.220> five<00:02:20.460> or<00:02:20.580> six<00:02:20.610> times<00:02:20.820> and

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
tested it like five or six times and

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.020 
tested it like five or six times and
every<00:02:21.750> single<00:02:21.960> time<00:02:22.350> the<00:02:22.770> stability<00:02:23.460> side<00:02:23.760> the

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
every single time the stability side the

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.060 
every single time the stability side the
right<00:02:24.240> side<00:02:24.510> was<00:02:24.990> always<00:02:25.470> a<00:02:25.500> little<00:02:25.920> bit

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
right side was always a little bit

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:27.590 
right side was always a little bit
better<00:02:26.430> than<00:02:26.700> the<00:02:26.820> kick<00:02:27.000> side<00:02:27.240> you<00:02:27.360> know<00:02:27.450> I<00:02:27.480> had

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
better than the kick side you know I had

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.080 
better than the kick side you know I had
a<00:02:27.660> little<00:02:27.870> bit<00:02:28.140> smaller<00:02:28.530> of<00:02:28.890> a<00:02:29.220> bullet<00:02:29.760> pattern

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
a little bit smaller of a bullet pattern

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.940 
a little bit smaller of a bullet pattern
there<00:02:30.270> so<00:02:30.780> it<00:02:31.050> was<00:02:31.170> a<00:02:31.200> little<00:02:31.470> bit<00:02:31.680> more<00:02:31.800> on

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
there so it was a little bit more on

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.730 
there so it was a little bit more on
target<00:02:32.190> when<00:02:32.490> you're<00:02:32.610> burst<00:02:32.820> firing<00:02:33.120> and<00:02:33.740> then

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
target when you're burst firing and then

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:36.620 
target when you're burst firing and then
that<00:02:35.220> means<00:02:35.460> that<00:02:35.700> just<00:02:35.940> basically<00:02:36.180> the<00:02:36.420> first

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
that means that just basically the first

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.060 
that means that just basically the first
couple<00:02:36.930> of<00:02:36.960> bullets<00:02:37.260> are<00:02:37.380> always<00:02:37.770> a<00:02:37.800> little

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
couple of bullets are always a little

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:39.320 
couple of bullets are always a little
bit<00:02:38.250> more<00:02:38.460> on<00:02:38.580> target<00:02:38.790> when<00:02:39.060> you're<00:02:39.180> using

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
bit more on target when you're using

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:40.820 
bit more on target when you're using
stability<00:02:39.900> and<00:02:40.020> this<00:02:40.110> made<00:02:40.260> me<00:02:40.410> think<00:02:40.440> well

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
stability and this made me think well

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.430 
stability and this made me think well
you<00:02:41.430> know<00:02:41.550> the<00:02:41.670> recoil<00:02:42.150> might<00:02:42.420> be<00:02:42.660> worse<00:02:43.170> than

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
you know the recoil might be worse than

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.470 
you know the recoil might be worse than
kick<00:02:43.710> but<00:02:44.220> if<00:02:44.310> I<00:02:44.400> can<00:02:44.580> always<00:02:45.000> land<00:02:45.270> those

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
kick but if I can always land those

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.420 
kick but if I can always land those
first<00:02:45.780> couple<00:02:45.990> of<00:02:46.230> bullets<00:02:46.590> on<00:02:46.709> a<00:02:46.770> person<00:02:47.280> is

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
first couple of bullets on a person is

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.130 
first couple of bullets on a person is
that<00:02:48.030> gonna<00:02:48.209> make<00:02:48.300> it<00:02:48.570> better<00:02:48.720> than<00:02:48.959> kick

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
that gonna make it better than kick

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.270 
that gonna make it better than kick
because<00:02:49.290> I'm<00:02:49.560> gonna<00:02:49.680> have<00:02:49.830> a<00:02:49.860> head<00:02:50.010> start<00:02:50.040> on

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
because I'm gonna have a head start on

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.590 
because I'm gonna have a head start on
the<00:02:50.400> gunfight<00:02:50.730> and<00:02:50.910> I<00:02:50.940> might<00:02:51.120> be<00:02:51.270> able<00:02:51.360> to<00:02:51.450> kill

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
the gunfight and I might be able to kill

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.260 
the gunfight and I might be able to kill
them<00:02:51.720> faster<00:02:52.110> so<00:02:52.260> I<00:02:52.500> tested<00:02:53.130> this<00:02:53.250> out<00:02:53.430> and<00:02:53.640> you

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 
them faster so I tested this out and you

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:56.240 
them faster so I tested this out and you
know<00:02:54.360> I<00:02:54.390> a<00:02:54.540> short<00:02:54.900> range<00:02:55.140> of<00:02:55.380> course<00:02:55.890> what<00:02:56.160> you

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
know I a short range of course what you

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:57.320 
know I a short range of course what you
would<00:02:56.370> think<00:02:56.490> it<00:02:56.670> doesn't<00:02:56.970> really<00:02:57.060> matter

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
would think it doesn't really matter

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:58.640 
would think it doesn't really matter
because<00:02:57.480> all<00:02:57.630> the<00:02:57.900> bullets<00:02:58.140> are<00:02:58.230> gonna<00:02:58.320> be<00:02:58.530> on

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
because all the bullets are gonna be on

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.170 
because all the bullets are gonna be on
target<00:02:59.010> it's<00:02:59.130> not<00:02:59.280> really<00:02:59.520> a<00:02:59.550> big<00:02:59.730> deal<00:02:59.880> but

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
target it's not really a big deal but

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.600 
target it's not really a big deal but
when<00:03:00.570> we<00:03:00.720> move<00:03:00.959> back<00:03:01.200> to<00:03:01.470> more<00:03:01.650> medium<00:03:02.160> to<00:03:02.370> long

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
when we move back to more medium to long

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.610 
when we move back to more medium to long
range<00:03:02.850> as<00:03:03.060> you're<00:03:03.180> gonna<00:03:03.330> see<00:03:03.420> here<00:03:03.930> when<00:03:04.500> I'm

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
range as you're gonna see here when I'm

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.740 
range as you're gonna see here when I'm
shooting<00:03:05.130> with<00:03:05.160> kick<00:03:05.640> you're<00:03:06.120> gonna<00:03:06.300> see<00:03:06.540> that

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
shooting with kick you're gonna see that

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.900 
shooting with kick you're gonna see that
there<00:03:06.900> are<00:03:06.930> some<00:03:07.470> bullets<00:03:07.890> that<00:03:08.100> miss<00:03:08.430> because

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
there are some bullets that miss because

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.660 
there are some bullets that miss because
the<00:03:09.270> weapon<00:03:09.870> is<00:03:10.140> swaying<00:03:10.680> off<00:03:11.100> to<00:03:11.340> the<00:03:11.459> side

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
the weapon is swaying off to the side

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.160 
the weapon is swaying off to the side
and<00:03:11.940> above<00:03:12.180> the<00:03:12.360> person<00:03:12.690> and<00:03:12.840> things<00:03:13.020> like

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
and above the person and things like

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.230 
and above the person and things like
that<00:03:13.380> whereas<00:03:14.040> when<00:03:14.250> we<00:03:14.280> switch<00:03:14.670> over<00:03:14.850> to<00:03:15.030> the

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:15.240 
that whereas when we switch over to the

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.810 
that whereas when we switch over to the
gun<00:03:15.390> with<00:03:15.570> stability<00:03:16.200> you're<00:03:16.770> gonna<00:03:16.920> see<00:03:17.250> that

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
gun with stability you're gonna see that

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:19.699 
gun with stability you're gonna see that
none<00:03:18.239> of<00:03:18.269> the<00:03:18.570> bullets<00:03:18.900> missed<00:03:19.140> because<00:03:19.590> the

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
none of the bullets missed because the

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:21.680 
none of the bullets missed because the
sway<00:03:19.950> isn't<00:03:20.400> as<00:03:20.489> big<00:03:20.730> so<00:03:20.940> it's<00:03:21.090> always<00:03:21.300> staying

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
sway isn't as big so it's always staying

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.810 
sway isn't as big so it's always staying
on<00:03:21.870> his<00:03:21.989> character<00:03:22.380> no<00:03:22.530> matter<00:03:22.709> what<00:03:23.010> so<00:03:23.280> that

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
on his character no matter what so that

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.880 
on his character no matter what so that
is<00:03:24.030> where<00:03:24.300> the<00:03:24.420> huge<00:03:24.870> huge<00:03:25.170> advantage<00:03:25.410> with

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
is where the huge huge advantage with

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:27.740 
is where the huge huge advantage with
this<00:03:26.040> is<00:03:26.250> is<00:03:26.430> if<00:03:26.940> you're<00:03:27.090> trying<00:03:27.269> to<00:03:27.510> burst

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
this is is if you're trying to burst

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.840 
this is is if you're trying to burst
fire<00:03:28.110> or<00:03:28.410> something<00:03:29.010> like<00:03:29.100> that<00:03:29.160> at<00:03:29.459> a<00:03:29.489> longer

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
fire or something like that at a longer

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:31.460 
fire or something like that at a longer
range<00:03:30.090> your<00:03:30.570> first<00:03:30.840> couple<00:03:31.050> of<00:03:31.140> shots<00:03:31.200> are

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
range your first couple of shots are

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:32.750 
range your first couple of shots are
gonna<00:03:31.560> be<00:03:31.709> more<00:03:31.890> on<00:03:31.950> target<00:03:32.430> and<00:03:32.519> you're<00:03:32.640> going

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
gonna be more on target and you're going

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.160 
gonna be more on target and you're going
to<00:03:32.820> be<00:03:32.880> able<00:03:32.970> to<00:03:33.120> kill<00:03:33.269> the<00:03:33.390> guy<00:03:33.480> faster<00:03:33.959> and

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
to be able to kill the guy faster and

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.680 
to be able to kill the guy faster and
you<00:03:34.950> know<00:03:35.040> or<00:03:35.250> if<00:03:35.459> it's<00:03:35.640> medium<00:03:35.970> range<00:03:36.209> and<00:03:36.420> you

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
you know or if it's medium range and you

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.240 
you know or if it's medium range and you
can<00:03:36.870> just<00:03:37.080> see<00:03:37.200> the<00:03:37.320> very<00:03:37.530> top<00:03:37.800> of<00:03:37.950> his<00:03:37.980> head

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
can just see the very top of his head

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.160 
can just see the very top of his head
here's<00:03:38.550> another<00:03:38.790> example<00:03:39.000> this<00:03:39.720> guy's<00:03:39.930> head

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
here's another example this guy's head

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.259 
here's another example this guy's head
glitching<00:03:40.440> when<00:03:40.920> I<00:03:40.950> have<00:03:41.130> kick<00:03:41.340> on<00:03:41.550> some<00:03:42.120> of<00:03:42.239> my

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
glitching when I have kick on some of my

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:44.030 
glitching when I have kick on some of my
bullets<00:03:42.720> missed<00:03:42.930> and<00:03:43.110> I<00:03:43.170> kill<00:03:43.410> him<00:03:43.590> but<00:03:43.950> it

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
bullets missed and I kill him but it

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.979 
bullets missed and I kill him but it
takes<00:03:44.220> a<00:03:44.340> little<00:03:44.519> bit<00:03:44.730> longer<00:03:45.030> whereas<00:03:45.750> when<00:03:45.959> I

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
takes a little bit longer whereas when I

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:48.080 
takes a little bit longer whereas when I
switch<00:03:46.290> over<00:03:46.410> to<00:03:46.560> stability<00:03:47.250> all<00:03:47.580> of<00:03:47.940> my

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
switch over to stability all of my

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:49.880 
switch over to stability all of my
bullets<00:03:48.450> hit<00:03:48.630> none<00:03:49.019> of<00:03:49.170> a<00:03:49.230> miss<00:03:49.470> and<00:03:49.620> I'm<00:03:49.799> able

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
bullets hit none of a miss and I'm able

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:52.070 
bullets hit none of a miss and I'm able
to<00:03:50.070> kill<00:03:50.220> him<00:03:50.310> really<00:03:50.670> really<00:03:50.700> quickly<00:03:51.150> so

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 
to kill him really really quickly so

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:53.630 
to kill him really really quickly so
what<00:03:52.350> what<00:03:52.650> does<00:03:52.799> this<00:03:52.950> mean<00:03:53.160> is<00:03:53.400> stability

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
what what does this mean is stability

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.910 
what what does this mean is stability
better<00:03:54.060> than<00:03:54.209> kick<00:03:54.420> well<00:03:54.959> honestly<00:03:55.530> in<00:03:55.680> some

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
better than kick well honestly in some

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.350 
better than kick well honestly in some
ways<00:03:56.070> I<00:03:56.250> think<00:03:56.280> it<00:03:56.610> is<00:03:56.730> and<00:03:56.910> I'm<00:03:56.970> really<00:03:57.209> having

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 
ways I think it is and I'm really having

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.090 
ways I think it is and I'm really having
a<00:03:57.510> lot<00:03:57.720> of<00:03:57.750> fun<00:03:57.989> using<00:03:58.200> it<00:03:58.440> I<00:03:58.530> suggest<00:03:58.739> you<00:03:58.980> guys

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 
a lot of fun using it I suggest you guys

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:00.410 
a lot of fun using it I suggest you guys
at<00:03:59.310> least<00:03:59.430> try<00:03:59.760> it<00:03:59.820> out<00:03:59.970> if<00:04:00.120> you<00:04:00.239> haven't

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
at least try it out if you haven't

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.050 
at least try it out if you haven't
already<00:04:00.570> but<00:04:01.320> you<00:04:01.980> know<00:04:02.070> it<00:04:02.340> just<00:04:02.459> depends<00:04:02.940> on

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
already but you know it just depends on

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:04.340 
already but you know it just depends on
what<00:04:03.239> type<00:04:03.420> of<00:04:03.450> player<00:04:03.750> you<00:04:03.930> are<00:04:03.959> if<00:04:04.230> you're

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
what type of player you are if you're

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:05.840 
what type of player you are if you're
the<00:04:04.500> type<00:04:04.650> of<00:04:04.680> player<00:04:04.950> that<00:04:04.980> really<00:04:05.489> likes<00:04:05.670> to

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:05.850 
the type of player that really likes to

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:08.390 
the type of player that really likes to
spray<00:04:06.299> people<00:04:06.570> down<00:04:06.930> and<00:04:07.200> really<00:04:07.860> holds<00:04:08.220> down

spray people down and really holds down

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.220 
spray people down and really holds down
that<00:04:08.610> trigger<00:04:08.880> then<00:04:09.360> stability<00:04:09.870> isn't<00:04:10.019> gonna

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
that trigger then stability isn't gonna

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:11.870 
that trigger then stability isn't gonna
be<00:04:10.410> for<00:04:10.650> you<00:04:10.739> because<00:04:11.100> you<00:04:11.310> know<00:04:11.400> your<00:04:11.700> guns

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:15.299 
gonna hit anybody but if you're the type

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:17.090 
gonna hit anybody but if you're the type
of<00:04:15.570> guy<00:04:15.660> that<00:04:15.690> really<00:04:16.080> you<00:04:16.320> know<00:04:16.440> burst<00:04:16.709> fires

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100 
of guy that really you know burst fires

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.640 
of guy that really you know burst fires
and<00:04:17.609> tries<00:04:18.000> to<00:04:18.030> be<00:04:18.330> on<00:04:18.450> target<00:04:18.930> right<00:04:19.019> away

and tries to be on target right away

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:21.380 
and tries to be on target right away
then<00:04:20.130> stability<00:04:20.640> might<00:04:20.820> be<00:04:20.970> better<00:04:21.120> for<00:04:21.239> you

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.390 
then stability might be better for you

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:22.969 
then stability might be better for you
and<00:04:21.479> I<00:04:21.720> honestly<00:04:21.870> think<00:04:22.109> it<00:04:22.440> will<00:04:22.620> help<00:04:22.860> you

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:22.979 
and I honestly think it will help you

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:24.980 
and I honestly think it will help you
win<00:04:23.160> quite<00:04:23.430> a<00:04:23.460> few<00:04:23.700> gunfights<00:04:24.150> you<00:04:24.690> just<00:04:24.870> have

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
win quite a few gunfights you just have

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:26.810 
win quite a few gunfights you just have
to<00:04:25.140> burst<00:04:25.349> fire<00:04:25.650> your<00:04:25.890> weapons<00:04:26.370> if<00:04:26.460> you

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
to burst fire your weapons if you

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:28.670 
to burst fire your weapons if you

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 
using a faster firing assault rifle like

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.980 
using a faster firing assault rifle like
um<00:04:28.920> for<00:04:29.190> the<00:04:29.430> FA<00:04:29.670> D<00:04:29.730> or<00:04:29.970> something<00:04:30.330> but<00:04:30.750> then<00:04:30.870> if

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
um for the FA D or something but then if

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:33.620 
um for the FA D or something but then if
use<00:04:31.170> in<00:04:31.290> like<00:04:31.410> the<00:04:31.530> g36c<00:04:32.280> or<00:04:32.520> the<00:04:32.640> C<00:04:32.820> 901<00:04:33.330> or<00:04:33.540> the

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:33.630 
use in like the g36c or the C 901 or the

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:36.140 
use in like the g36c or the C 901 or the
type<00:04:33.840> 95<00:04:34.230> of<00:04:34.440> the<00:04:34.500> MK<00:04:34.770> 14<00:04:35.220> the<00:04:35.640> ones<00:04:35.880> where<00:04:36.060> the

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.150 
type 95 of the MK 14 the ones where the

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:37.760 
type 95 of the MK 14 the ones where the
shots<00:04:36.390> really<00:04:36.720> count<00:04:37.170> and<00:04:37.350> you<00:04:37.410> really<00:04:37.680> have

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770 
shots really count and you really have

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:38.600 
shots really count and you really have
to<00:04:37.830> be<00:04:37.980> on<00:04:38.070> target

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
to be on target

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:40.070 
to be on target
then<00:04:38.970> then<00:04:39.420> that's<00:04:39.630> where<00:04:39.840> it's<00:04:39.930> going<00:04:40.020> to

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
then then that's where it's going to

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.590 
then then that's where it's going to
give<00:04:40.260> you<00:04:40.380> the<00:04:40.560> most<00:04:40.800> benefit<00:04:41.400> so<00:04:41.730> stability

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:42.600 
give you the most benefit so stability

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:45.140 
give you the most benefit so stability
is<00:04:42.750> an<00:04:42.900> extremely<00:04:43.470> good<00:04:43.740> proficiency<00:04:44.370> and<00:04:44.550> I

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
is an extremely good proficiency and I

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:46.640 
is an extremely good proficiency and I
really<00:04:45.480> suggest<00:04:45.870> you<00:04:45.930> guys<00:04:46.110> try<00:04:46.350> it<00:04:46.380> out<00:04:46.500> I

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:46.650 
really suggest you guys try it out I

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:47.990 
really suggest you guys try it out I
think<00:04:46.680> it's<00:04:47.010> better<00:04:47.160> than<00:04:47.310> kick<00:04:47.490> in<00:04:47.610> some<00:04:47.790> ways

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000 
think it's better than kick in some ways

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.180 
think it's better than kick in some ways
but<00:04:48.540> at<00:04:48.930> the<00:04:49.020> same<00:04:49.170> time<00:04:49.380> kick<00:04:49.650> is<00:04:49.800> just<00:04:49.830> kind

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:50.190 
but at the same time kick is just kind

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:51.650 
but at the same time kick is just kind
of<00:04:50.220> like<00:04:50.280> this<00:04:50.550> all-around<00:04:50.880> thing<00:04:51.270> that<00:04:51.450> works

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:51.660 
of like this all-around thing that works

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:53.600 
of like this all-around thing that works
for<00:04:51.810> everything<00:04:52.080> so<00:04:52.500> I<00:04:52.710> really<00:04:53.220> depends<00:04:53.550> on

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:53.610 
for everything so I really depends on

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:54.920 
for everything so I really depends on
the<00:04:53.730> type<00:04:53.850> of<00:04:53.910> player<00:04:54.180> you<00:04:54.330> aren't<00:04:54.540> but<00:04:54.660> some

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 
the type of player you aren't but some

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:56.720 
the type of player you aren't but some
