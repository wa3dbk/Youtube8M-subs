00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:12.719
 hello on this occasion we will show a 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:15.420
 ekiza and flash tokyo watch that we 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.640
 they sent just from tokyo japan is 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.220
 a watch for all those enthusiasts 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.740
 and technology fans we are going to 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.020
 do in the pits quickly here what 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.540
 first thing we see is a usb cable let's go 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.440
 to open it also this cable hbo 

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:32.590
 listened to with toulouse 

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:34.450
 and with a small screwdriver 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:39.280
 screwdriver that will later know 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:43.079
 why it works and the usb cable that also 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:45.899
 let's see here is the clock 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:49.039
 you can not give an account you have to 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:53.100
 read the time with a degree of inclination 

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:55.199
 so you almost do not see you have to read like that 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.989
 that's why the box says change 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.960
 the way i used enke about time that this 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:04.379
 clock adds in the box we remove this 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.840
 what we are is steel enduring 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:10.860
 weigh these two buttons are just 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.750
 to put the time and minutes 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.710
 set the alarm 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.960
 this is where the usb port goes 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:23.140
 we remove this capital in this cable 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:24.680
 obviously it goes to the computer and this 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.650
 Blog 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.630
 this jack we connect here this is 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:33.650
 connect the meter and what is it used for? 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:35.990
 first to charge it on battery because 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:38.630
 This watch lasts the battery around 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:41.659
 3 or 4 months of recharging time 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:44.420
 it's more like 3.5 hours 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:46.430
 approximately from 0 to 100 percent and 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.979
 It also serves to transfer data 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:51.619
 because because inside this clock there is 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:54.740
 a microsd memory here is the last 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:57.170
 screw and we retired to be able 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.490
 open the lid and see of course in 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.460
 where are you going 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:04.409
 the 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:06.490
 microsd card we lift the lid and 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:11.069
 here it is 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:13.650
 the battery here is the microsd card 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:16.150
 to open it what we have to do is 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:19.230
 use it 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.230
 can already be opened 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:26.120
 and this one comes with this card 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:29.209
 2 gigabyte launch is enough 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:31.400
 not for an emergency and with the novelty 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:34.010
 that this clock or plus of x there is 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.290
 touch dotcom flashes we're going to 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:40.970
 give away a user of 10 point com 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:45.170
 send us the design picture or drawing 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:47.569
 of what the cover of a clock would look like 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.819
 10 point com not upload the image 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:52.180
