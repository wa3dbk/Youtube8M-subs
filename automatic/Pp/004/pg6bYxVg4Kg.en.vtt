a scruffy been just over just a little

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.250 
a scruffy been just over just a little
bit<00:00:45.420> more<00:00:45.690> so<00:00:46.350> I'm<00:00:46.530> just<00:00:46.710> gonna<00:00:47.000> do<00:00:48.000> that<00:00:48.260> just

bit more so I'm just gonna do that just

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.380 
bit more so I'm just gonna do that just
gives<00:00:49.440> a<00:00:49.530> bit<00:00:49.680> more<00:00:49.829> volume<00:00:50.039> I'm<00:00:50.670> just<00:00:51.239> going

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
gives a bit more volume I'm just going

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.360 
gives a bit more volume I'm just going
to<00:00:51.420> take<00:00:51.629> bits<00:00:51.960> of<00:00:52.140> my<00:00:52.289> hair<00:00:52.320> and<00:00:52.590> backcomb

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
to take bits of my hair and backcomb

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.490 
to take bits of my hair and backcomb
them<00:00:53.870> the<00:00:54.870> fringe<00:00:56.390> just<00:00:57.390> at<00:00:57.600> the<00:00:57.750> root<00:00:57.960> at<00:00:58.289> the

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
them the fringe just at the root at the

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.959 
them the fringe just at the root at the
top<00:00:58.879> so<00:00:59.879> then<00:01:00.030> isn't<00:01:00.420> so<00:01:00.629> flat<00:01:01.100> at<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.430> top<00:01:02.699> as

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
top so then isn't so flat at the top as

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.719 
top so then isn't so flat at the top as
well<00:01:03.180> you<00:01:03.809> could<00:01:04.049> if<00:01:04.290> you<00:01:04.589> already<00:01:04.769> have<00:01:05.220> quite

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
well you could if you already have quite

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.740 
well you could if you already have quite
volume<00:01:06.210> volume<00:01:06.869> here<00:01:07.640> you<00:01:08.640> can<00:01:08.820> do<00:01:09.030> wherever

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
volume volume here you can do wherever

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.450 
volume volume here you can do wherever
so<00:01:10.290> it's<00:01:10.470> just<00:01:10.650> a<00:01:10.740> little<00:01:10.979> bit<00:01:11.100> more<00:01:11.250> volume

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
so it's just a little bit more volume

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.460 
so it's just a little bit more volume
I'm<00:01:12.240> just<00:01:12.420> using<00:01:12.600> a<00:01:12.689> little<00:01:12.720> brush<00:01:13.170> cut<00:01:13.380> is

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
I'm just using a little brush cut is

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.260 
I'm just using a little brush cut is
easier<00:01:14.960> like<00:01:15.960> that<00:01:16.229> okay<00:01:16.950> and<00:01:17.850> then<00:01:18.150> I'm<00:01:18.240> just

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270
