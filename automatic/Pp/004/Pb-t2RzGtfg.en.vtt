00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.929 

I<00:00:00.299> really<00:00:01.020> like<00:00:01.290> Spade<00:00:01.800> bits<00:00:01.829> and<00:00:02.820> that's

00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:02.939 
I really like Spade bits and that's

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:04.160 
I really like Spade bits and that's
because<00:00:03.179> they<00:00:03.330> work<00:00:03.540> so<00:00:03.570> well

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:04.170 
because they work so well

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.860 
because they work so well
although<00:00:04.770> most<00:00:05.400> woodworkers<00:00:05.670> shun<00:00:06.390> them<00:00:06.540> they

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
although most woodworkers shun them they

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.059 
although most woodworkers shun them they
have<00:00:06.960> a<00:00:07.020> prejudice<00:00:07.470> against<00:00:07.770> them<00:00:07.980> because

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
have a prejudice against them because

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.400 
have a prejudice against them because
unless<00:00:08.910> they're<00:00:09.330> sharpened<00:00:09.900> properly

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
unless they're sharpened properly

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:11.990 
unless they're sharpened properly
they're<00:00:10.860> not<00:00:11.010> going<00:00:11.219> to<00:00:11.250> work<00:00:11.429> all<00:00:11.610> that<00:00:11.820> well

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
they're not going to work all that well

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.480 
they're not going to work all that well
so<00:00:12.150> I<00:00:12.420> want<00:00:12.719> to<00:00:12.750> show<00:00:12.960> you<00:00:13.019> a<00:00:13.259> few<00:00:13.650> things<00:00:13.860> that

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
so I want to show you a few things that

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.189 
so I want to show you a few things that
you<00:00:14.580> can<00:00:14.759> do<00:00:14.910> with<00:00:15.089> Spade<00:00:15.330> bits<00:00:15.360> and<00:00:15.750> most

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
you can do with Spade bits and most

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:17.990 
you can do with Spade bits and most
importantly<00:00:16.770> how<00:00:17.250> you<00:00:17.310> can<00:00:17.520> get<00:00:17.640> them<00:00:17.820> really

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
importantly how you can get them really

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.720 
importantly how you can get them really
sharp<00:00:18.480> so<00:00:19.020> that<00:00:19.170> they<00:00:19.320> cut<00:00:19.619> as<00:00:19.770> cleanly<00:00:20.160> as<00:00:20.310> any

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
sharp so that they cut as cleanly as any

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.640 
sharp so that they cut as cleanly as any
other<00:00:21.060> kind<00:00:21.390> of<00:00:21.449> fine<00:00:21.720> woodworking<00:00:21.990> bit<00:00:22.529> you

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
other kind of fine woodworking bit you

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.980 
other kind of fine woodworking bit you
might<00:00:22.830> try<00:00:23.070> the<00:00:23.580> beauty<00:00:24.029> of<00:00:24.060> a<00:00:24.210> spade<00:00:24.570> bit<00:00:24.600> is

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
might try the beauty of a spade bit is

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.620 
might try the beauty of a spade bit is
that<00:00:25.470> you<00:00:25.560> can<00:00:25.800> read<00:00:26.189> grind<00:00:26.670> it<00:00:26.910> to<00:00:27.300> different

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
that you can read grind it to different

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.150 
that you can read grind it to different
configurations<00:00:28.380> that's<00:00:28.740> something<00:00:29.070> you

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
configurations that's something you

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.099 
configurations that's something you
can't<00:00:29.490> do<00:00:29.670> with<00:00:29.849> any<00:00:30.119> other<00:00:30.240> kinds<00:00:30.840> of<00:00:30.900> bit

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
can't do with any other kinds of bit

can't do with any other kinds of bit
take<00:00:31.920> a<00:00:31.949> look<00:00:32.130> here<00:00:32.279> this<00:00:32.579> is<00:00:32.820> a<00:00:32.850> stalk<00:00:33.320> Spade

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
take a look here this is a stalk Spade

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.170 
take a look here this is a stalk Spade

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
bit it's sharp and ready to go and it'll

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.580 
bit it's sharp and ready to go and it'll
work<00:00:36.329> just<00:00:36.360> fine<00:00:36.570> for<00:00:36.960> you<00:00:37.050> it's<00:00:37.290> got<00:00:37.410> some

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
work just fine for you it's got some

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.680 
work just fine for you it's got some
Spurs<00:00:37.950> on<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.280> corners<00:00:38.730> to<00:00:39.059> help<00:00:39.239> it<00:00:39.360> cut<00:00:39.540> more

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
Spurs on the corners to help it cut more

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.720 
Spurs on the corners to help it cut more
cleanly<00:00:40.110> but<00:00:40.710> what<00:00:40.829> if<00:00:40.950> you<00:00:41.040> want<00:00:41.280> a<00:00:41.460> hole

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
cleanly but what if you want a hole

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.670 
cleanly but what if you want a hole
that's<00:00:42.090> just<00:00:42.300> slightly<00:00:42.690> smaller<00:00:43.290> than<00:00:43.440> a

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
that's just slightly smaller than a

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:44.630 
that's just slightly smaller than a
standard<00:00:43.739> size

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
standard size

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.000 
standard size
well<00:00:45.149> this<00:00:45.270> half-inch<00:00:45.780> bit<00:00:46.050> as<00:00:46.440> you<00:00:46.649> can<00:00:46.680> see

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
well this half-inch bit as you can see

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.940 
well this half-inch bit as you can see
here<00:00:47.250> along<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.640> edges<00:00:48.000> ivory<00:00:48.930> grounded<00:00:49.559> so

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
here along the edges ivory grounded so

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.310 
here along the edges ivory grounded so
it's<00:00:50.100> slightly<00:00:50.520> smaller<00:00:51.090> than<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.930> half-inch

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
it's slightly smaller than the half-inch

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.860 
it's slightly smaller than the half-inch
size<00:00:52.559> and<00:00:52.829> it<00:00:53.430> works<00:00:53.579> perfectly<00:00:54.090> with<00:00:54.449> tapered

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
size and it works perfectly with tapered

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.220 
size and it works perfectly with tapered
wooden<00:00:55.320> plugs<00:00:56.180> these<00:00:57.180> bits<00:00:57.510> here<00:00:57.840> are<00:00:57.899> for

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
wooden plugs these bits here are for

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.580 
wooden plugs these bits here are for
situations<00:00:58.859> where<00:00:59.129> I<00:00:59.399> couldn't<00:01:00.359> tolerate<00:01:00.930> the

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
situations where I couldn't tolerate the

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.429 
situations where I couldn't tolerate the
long<00:01:01.980> spur<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:02.879> long<00:01:03.059> central<00:01:03.539> spur<00:01:03.840> coming

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
long spur the long central spur coming

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.530 
long spur the long central spur coming
through<00:01:04.769> on<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.670> bottom<00:01:05.820> edge<00:01:06.180> of<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.360> hole

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
through on the bottom edge of the hole

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.330 
through on the bottom edge of the hole
because<00:01:06.900> it<00:01:07.049> would<00:01:07.200> have<00:01:07.320> punched<00:01:08.040> through<00:01:08.310> a

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
because it would have punched through a

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.310 
because it would have punched through a
visible<00:01:08.820> part<00:01:09.030> of<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.150> project<00:01:09.630> so<00:01:10.080> I<00:01:10.110> simply

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
visible part of the project so I simply

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.060 
visible part of the project so I simply
ground<00:01:10.860> down<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.760> central<00:01:12.180> spur<00:01:12.540> and<00:01:12.920> made<00:01:13.920> it

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
ground down the central spur and made it

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.300 
ground down the central spur and made it
work<00:01:14.630> much<00:01:15.630> like<00:01:15.780> any<00:01:15.990> other<00:01:16.080> kind<00:01:16.500> of<00:01:16.710> shallow

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
work much like any other kind of shallow

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.310 
work much like any other kind of shallow
bit<00:01:17.759> like<00:01:17.970> a<00:01:18.000> Forstner<00:01:18.479> bit<00:01:18.720> or<00:01:18.869> a<00:01:18.960> sawtooth

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
bit like a Forstner bit or a sawtooth

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.770 
bit like a Forstner bit or a sawtooth
bit<00:01:19.619> so<00:01:20.340> let's<00:01:20.700> go<00:01:20.820> to<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:21.000> grinder<00:01:21.390> now<00:01:21.540> and

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
bit so let's go to the grinder now and

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.420 
bit so let's go to the grinder now and
I'm<00:01:22.229> going<00:01:22.380> to<00:01:22.470> show<00:01:22.590> you<00:01:22.619> some<00:01:22.890> of<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.100> tricks

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
I'm going to show you some of the tricks

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.670 
I'm going to show you some of the tricks
that<00:01:23.580> let<00:01:23.909> me<00:01:24.090> do<00:01:24.540> great<00:01:24.869> things<00:01:24.900> with<00:01:25.409> Spade

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
that let me do great things with Spade

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.950 
that let me do great things with Spade
bits<00:01:25.710> this<00:01:26.490> three<00:01:27.060> quarter<00:01:27.390> inch<00:01:27.540> spade<00:01:27.930> bit

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
bits this three quarter inch spade bit

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.810 
bits this three quarter inch spade bit
has<00:01:28.259> never<00:01:28.470> been<00:01:28.650> sharpened<00:01:29.100> before<00:01:29.430> but<00:01:29.670> it's

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
has never been sharpened before but it's

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.999 
has never been sharpened before but it's
working<00:01:30.570> a<00:01:30.659> little<00:01:30.900> sad<00:01:31.140> its<00:01:31.409> lost<00:01:31.680> some<00:01:31.979> of

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
working a little sad its lost some of

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.370 
working a little sad its lost some of
the<00:01:32.189> edge<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.850> crispness<00:01:33.450> of<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:33.780> Spurs<00:01:34.110> is

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
the edge the crispness of the Spurs is

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.310 
the edge the crispness of the Spurs is
gone<00:01:34.650> but<00:01:35.579> I<00:01:35.640> can<00:01:35.909> reestablish<00:01:36.390> all<00:01:36.960> that<00:01:37.140> and

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
gone but I can reestablish all that and

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.080 
gone but I can reestablish all that and
make<00:01:37.439> this<00:01:37.560> bit<00:01:37.799> cut<00:01:38.040> at<00:01:38.250> least<00:01:38.549> as<00:01:38.759> good<00:01:38.939> as

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.539 
with a few minutes at the grinder the
trick<00:01:42.329> is<00:01:42.600> to<00:01:43.049> get<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.530> angle<00:01:43.979> of<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.250> tool

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
trick is to get the angle of the tool

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.420 
trick is to get the angle of the tool
rest<00:01:44.880> just<00:01:45.570> right<00:01:45.840> you<00:01:46.560> want<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:46.950> leading

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
rest just right you want the leading

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.270 
rest just right you want the leading
edge<00:01:47.610> of<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:48.630> cutting<00:01:48.810> surfaces<00:01:49.500> to<00:01:50.250> be

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
edge of the cutting surfaces to be

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.310 
edge of the cutting surfaces to be
slightly<00:01:50.670> higher<00:01:51.090> than<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.570> trailing<00:01:51.990> edges

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
slightly higher than the trailing edges

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.850 
slightly higher than the trailing edges
and<00:01:52.560> because<00:01:53.130> these<00:01:53.369> bits<00:01:53.670> turn<00:01:54.030> clockwise

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
and because these bits turn clockwise

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.300 
and because these bits turn clockwise
that<00:01:55.860> means<00:01:56.219> that<00:01:56.939> the<00:01:57.590> left<00:01:58.590> side<00:01:59.040> of<00:01:59.219> the

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
that means that the left side of the

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.620 
that means that the left side of the
cutter<00:01:59.520> as<00:01:59.790> it<00:01:59.969> lays<00:02:00.180> on<00:02:00.450> the<00:02:00.479> tool<00:02:00.840> rest<00:02:01.380> here

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:02.630 
cutter as it lays on the tool rest here

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.810 
cutter as it lays on the tool rest here
needs<00:02:03.630> to<00:02:03.780> be<00:02:04.020> angled<00:02:04.380> upwards<00:02:04.890> as<00:02:05.130> you<00:02:05.640> can

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
needs to be angled upwards as you can

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.580 
needs to be angled upwards as you can
see<00:02:06.030> here<00:02:06.270> on<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.509> wheel<00:02:06.659> now<00:02:07.079> I'm<00:02:07.229> not<00:02:07.409> going

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
see here on the wheel now I'm not going

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.919 
see here on the wheel now I'm not going
to<00:02:07.649> worry<00:02:07.920> about<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:09.060> presence<00:02:09.420> of<00:02:09.539> the<00:02:09.599> Spurs

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
to worry about the presence of the Spurs

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.000 
to worry about the presence of the Spurs
they're<00:02:10.170> going<00:02:10.349> to<00:02:10.410> get<00:02:10.530> ground<00:02:10.860> off<00:02:11.129> but<00:02:11.760> in

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
they're going to get ground off but in

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:13.770 
they're going to get ground off but in
practice<00:02:12.310> that's<00:02:12.879> not<00:02:13.150> going<00:02:13.360> to<00:02:13.420> matter<00:02:13.569> at

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
practice that's not going to matter at

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.690 
practice that's not going to matter at
all<00:02:13.900> so<00:02:14.170> come<00:02:14.620> and<00:02:14.769> take<00:02:14.830> a<00:02:14.920> close<00:02:15.250> look<00:02:15.400> and

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
all so come and take a close look and

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.569 
all so come and take a close look and
watch<00:02:16.239> how<00:02:16.450> I<00:02:16.510> grind<00:02:16.870> one<00:02:17.140> side<00:02:17.500> and<00:02:17.799> then<00:02:18.430> the

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:18.579 
watch how I grind one side and then the

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:21.000 
watch how I grind one side and then the
other<00:02:19.170> so<00:02:20.170> I'm<00:02:20.260> going<00:02:20.409> to<00:02:20.470> switch<00:02:20.709> on<00:02:20.890> the

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
other so I'm going to switch on the

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.309 
other so I'm going to switch on the
grinder<00:02:21.430> I'm<00:02:21.700> using<00:02:21.909> a<00:02:22.090> cool<00:02:22.450> running<00:02:22.959> stone

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 
grinder I'm using a cool running stone

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:26.460 
grinder I'm using a cool running stone
to<00:02:23.709> minimize<00:02:24.189> heat<00:02:24.489> buildup<00:02:24.909> and<00:02:25.319> I'm<00:02:26.319> going

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
to minimize heat buildup and I'm going

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.399 
to minimize heat buildup and I'm going
to<00:02:26.530> be<00:02:26.680> grinding<00:02:27.189> the<00:02:27.310> left<00:02:27.640> side<00:02:28.030> because<00:02:29.019> my

00:02:29.399 --> 00:02:29.409 
to be grinding the left side because my

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:32.660 
to be grinding the left side because my
blade<00:02:30.370> my<00:02:30.670> tool<00:02:30.940> rest<00:02:31.180> is<00:02:31.390> tilted<00:02:31.930> this<00:02:32.079> way<00:02:32.140> I

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
blade my tool rest is tilted this way I

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.730 
blade my tool rest is tilted this way I
want<00:02:33.670> a<00:02:33.760> grind

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:35.740 
want a grind

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:38.490 
want a grind
like<00:02:36.280> this<00:02:36.460> very<00:02:37.300> gently<00:02:37.630> I<00:02:37.900> don't<00:02:38.260> want<00:02:38.410> to

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
like this very gently I don't want to

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.560 
like this very gently I don't want to
grind<00:02:38.680> like<00:02:38.950> this<00:02:39.190> because<00:02:39.580> that<00:02:39.610> will<00:02:39.940> angle

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.570 
grind like this because that will angle

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:42.930 
grind like this because that will angle
the<00:02:41.230> cutter<00:02:41.500> in<00:02:41.770> exactly<00:02:42.280> the<00:02:42.400> opposite

the cutter in exactly the opposite
direction<00:02:43.240> that<00:02:43.450> I<00:02:43.570> want<00:02:43.840> so<00:02:44.200> I<00:02:44.470> just<00:02:45.220> a<00:02:46.050> few

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
direction that I want so I just a few

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:53.730 
direction that I want so I just a few
contact<00:02:47.590> points<00:02:47.950> here<00:02:48.220> flip<00:02:49.210> over

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:53.740 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:56.220 

you<00:02:54.310> hear<00:02:54.610> I<00:02:54.760> don't<00:02:55.330> need<00:02:55.450> to<00:02:55.540> complete<00:02:55.990> it<00:02:56.110> all

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
you hear I don't need to complete it all

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.520 
you hear I don't need to complete it all
in<00:02:56.380> one<00:02:56.560> go<00:02:56.620> I<00:02:57.690> only<00:02:58.690> want<00:02:58.930> to<00:02:58.990> touch<00:02:59.200> the<00:02:59.410> wheel

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
in one go I only want to touch the wheel

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:04.920 
in one go I only want to touch the wheel
briefly<00:03:01.530> to<00:03:02.530> minimize<00:03:02.920> heat<00:03:03.220> buildup

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
briefly to minimize heat buildup

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.059 
briefly to minimize heat buildup
a<00:03:05.019> lot

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:08.069 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:11.119 

is<00:03:08.459> it<00:03:08.670> nicely<00:03:08.879> sharpened<00:03:09.540> spade<00:03:09.840> bit<00:03:10.129> and

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:11.129 
is it nicely sharpened spade bit and

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:12.770 
is it nicely sharpened spade bit and
it's<00:03:11.280> going<00:03:11.459> to<00:03:11.519> work<00:03:11.760> really<00:03:12.000> well<00:03:12.150> how<00:03:12.719> the

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
it's going to work really well how the

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.440 
it's going to work really well how the
edges<00:03:13.230> of<00:03:13.349> this<00:03:13.469> bit<00:03:13.739> are<00:03:14.000> still<00:03:15.000> pretty<00:03:15.209> sharp

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
edges of this bit are still pretty sharp

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.720 
edges of this bit are still pretty sharp
I<00:03:15.659> don't<00:03:15.810> need<00:03:15.959> to<00:03:16.049> redo<00:03:16.349> them<00:03:16.500> again<00:03:16.799> but<00:03:16.980> if<00:03:17.519> I

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
I don't need to redo them again but if I

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.509 
I don't need to redo them again but if I
was<00:03:17.939> going<00:03:18.269> to<00:03:18.299> reduce<00:03:18.659> the<00:03:18.900> size<00:03:19.140> a<00:03:19.500> fold<00:03:20.280> of

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
was going to reduce the size a fold of

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:22.699 
was going to reduce the size a fold of
the<00:03:20.640> drill<00:03:20.909> made<00:03:21.540> or<00:03:21.840> if<00:03:22.019> I<00:03:22.140> wanted<00:03:22.469> to

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:22.709 
the drill made or if I wanted to

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:25.339 
the drill made or if I wanted to
crispin<00:03:23.250> up<00:03:23.370> the<00:03:23.489> edges<00:03:23.819> I<00:03:24.060> would<00:03:24.720> also<00:03:25.109> use

00:03:25.339 --> 00:03:25.349 
crispin up the edges I would also use

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:30.229 
crispin up the edges I would also use
the<00:03:25.680> same<00:03:25.920> angle<00:03:26.569> it<00:03:27.569> just<00:03:27.629> gently<00:03:29.000> grind<00:03:30.000> one

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
the same angle it just gently grind one

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:34.610 
the same angle it just gently grind one
side<00:03:30.540> of<00:03:30.689> the<00:03:30.750> bit

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.100 

and<00:03:34.800> then<00:03:34.920> the<00:03:35.069> other

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:36.110 
and then the other

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:39.010 
and then the other
until

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:39.020 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:43.720 

a<00:03:39.080> newly<00:03:39.800> ground<00:03:40.040> surface<00:03:42.190> existed<00:03:43.190> all<00:03:43.460> the

a newly ground surface existed all the

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:48.280 
a newly ground surface existed all the
way<00:03:43.880> across<00:03:45.760> the<00:03:46.760> edge<00:03:46.880> of<00:03:47.090> the<00:03:47.180> bit<00:03:47.360> so<00:03:48.170> now

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
way across the edge of the bit so now

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:50.230 
way across the edge of the bit so now
I've<00:03:48.440> got<00:03:48.590> my<00:03:48.620> newly<00:03:49.070> sharpened<00:03:49.250> spade<00:03:49.790> bit<00:03:49.820> in

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:50.240 
I've got my newly sharpened spade bit in

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:52.420 
I've got my newly sharpened spade bit in
the<00:03:50.360> drill<00:03:50.570> press<00:03:50.750> this<00:03:51.470> is<00:03:51.650> a<00:03:51.680> block<00:03:51.980> of<00:03:52.190> ash

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
the drill press this is a block of ash

00:03:52.430 --> 00:04:09.570 
the drill press this is a block of ash
and<00:03:52.820> let's<00:03:53.450> just<00:03:53.690> see<00:03:53.870> how<00:03:54.020> well<00:03:54.200> it<00:03:54.380> cuts

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:09.580 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:13.030 

we<00:04:10.580> end<00:04:10.790> up<00:04:10.909> with<00:04:11.150> is<00:04:11.299> a<00:04:11.330> nice<00:04:11.659> clean<00:04:12.409> crisp
