either<00:02:14.890> one<00:02:15.220> of<00:02:15.340> those<00:02:15.489> so<00:02:15.700> I'm<00:02:15.760> gonna<00:02:15.880> take<00:02:16.060> a

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
either one of those so I'm gonna take a

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.210 
either one of those so I'm gonna take a

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
look at my hand here octopus and that's

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.600 
look at my hand here octopus and that's
a<00:02:18.370> penguin<00:02:18.880> the<00:02:19.030> other<00:02:19.180> one<00:02:19.680> done<00:02:20.680> next

players<00:02:21.940> turn<00:02:22.060> octopus<00:02:22.870> or<00:02:23.019> penguin<00:02:26.459> octopus

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
players turn octopus or penguin octopus

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:31.370 
players turn octopus or penguin octopus
or<00:02:27.700> penguin<00:02:28.030> I<00:02:28.810> don't<00:02:29.530> think<00:02:29.830> they<00:02:29.980> have<00:02:30.250> one

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
or penguin I don't think they have one

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.870 
or penguin I don't think they have one
but<00:02:32.380> I<00:02:32.410> always<00:02:32.650> have<00:02:32.860> to<00:02:32.920> check<00:02:32.980> very<00:02:33.489> closely

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
but I always have to check very closely

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.310 
but I always have to check very closely
because<00:02:34.739> these<00:02:35.739> symbols<00:02:36.280> are<00:02:36.750> kind<00:02:37.750> of<00:02:38.080> tricky

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:38.320 
because these symbols are kind of tricky

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.289 
because these symbols are kind of tricky
I<00:02:38.769> don't<00:02:39.130> think<00:02:39.250> they<00:02:39.370> do<00:02:39.430> so<00:02:39.790> if<00:02:39.880> you<00:02:39.910> don't

00:02:40.289 --> 00:02:40.299 
I don't think they do so if you don't

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:44.539 
I don't think they do so if you don't
you<00:02:40.540> draw<00:02:40.780> card<00:02:41.110> done<00:02:42.040> next<00:02:42.430> players<00:02:42.790> turn

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:44.549 
you draw card done next players turn

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:48.630 
you draw card done next players turn
penguin<00:02:45.549> monkey<00:02:46.590> they'll<00:02:47.590> play<00:02:47.799> and<00:02:48.160> so<00:02:48.430> on

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
penguin monkey they'll play and so on

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:49.170 
penguin monkey they'll play and so on
okay

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
okay

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.509 
okay
very<00:02:49.630> simple<00:02:50.110> you've<00:02:50.410> basically<00:02:50.890> played<00:02:51.370> this

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:51.519 
very simple you've basically played this

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:54.000 
very simple you've basically played this
game<00:02:51.730> before<00:02:52.110> the<00:02:53.110> game<00:02:53.140> things<00:02:53.560> that<00:02:53.709> change

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
game before the game things that change

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.870 
game before the game things that change
the<00:02:54.220> game<00:02:54.459> are<00:02:55.420> these<00:02:56.160> which<00:02:57.160> are<00:02:57.370> rules<00:02:57.700> that

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
the game are these which are rules that

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.660 
the game are these which are rules that
change<00:02:58.299> the<00:02:58.510> game<00:02:58.750> so<00:02:59.010> the<00:03:00.010> two<00:03:00.160> that<00:03:00.280> I<00:03:00.340> happen

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
change the game so the two that I happen

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.780 
change the game so the two that I happen
to<00:03:00.700> flip<00:03:00.970> over<00:03:01.150> randomly<00:03:01.720> here<00:03:01.930> say<00:03:02.200> by<00:03:02.530> you

to flip over randomly here say by you

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.069 
to flip over randomly here say by you
whenever<00:03:03.790> you<00:03:04.000> play<00:03:04.180> a<00:03:04.209> crocodile<00:03:04.720> satisfy

whenever you play a crocodile satisfy

the top card of the draw pile whenever
you<00:03:07.269> play<00:03:07.450> a<00:03:07.480> card<00:03:07.690> that<00:03:07.780> has<00:03:07.989> no<00:03:08.200> crocodile

you play a card that has no crocodile

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:11.100 
you play a card that has no crocodile
you<00:03:08.829> take<00:03:09.040> all<00:03:09.220> those<00:03:09.340> cards<00:03:09.700> into<00:03:10.570> your<00:03:10.780> hand

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
you take all those cards into your hand

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.300 
you take all those cards into your hand
no<00:03:12.010> bueno<00:03:12.220> and<00:03:13.150> this<00:03:13.420> one<00:03:13.920> stowaway<00:03:14.920> whenever

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
no bueno and this one stowaway whenever

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.820 
no bueno and this one stowaway whenever
you<00:03:15.400> play<00:03:15.550> a<00:03:15.580> rat<00:03:16.080> discard<00:03:17.080> a<00:03:17.290> card<00:03:17.319> from<00:03:17.709> your

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:17.830 
you play a rat discard a card from your

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:18.480 
you play a rat discard a card from your
hand

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:18.490 
hand

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:20.760 
hand
and<00:03:18.580> slip<00:03:19.180> it<00:03:19.330> under<00:03:19.540> the<00:03:19.570> cart<00:03:19.840> played<00:03:20.140> then

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:20.770 
and slip it under the cart played then

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:25.190 
and slip it under the cart played then
draw<00:03:21.220> a<00:03:21.250> card<00:03:21.840> okay<00:03:22.840> that's<00:03:23.470> good<00:03:24.190> I<00:03:24.370> guess

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
draw a card okay that's good I guess

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.230 
draw a card okay that's good I guess
so<00:03:26.200> there's<00:03:26.530> those<00:03:26.770> two<00:03:27.130> there's<00:03:27.760> obviously<00:03:28.120> a

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:28.240 
so there's those two there's obviously a

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:31.320 
so there's those two there's obviously a
ton<00:03:28.600> of<00:03:28.630> rules<00:03:29.580> walruses<00:03:30.580> are<00:03:30.610> wild<00:03:31.270> cards

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:31.330 
ton of rules walruses are wild cards

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:32.670 
ton of rules walruses are wild cards
that's<00:03:32.140> good

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
that's good

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.010 
that's good
whenever<00:03:33.370> you<00:03:33.610> play<00:03:33.970> a<00:03:34.000> penguin<00:03:34.510> that<00:03:34.540> play

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:35.020 
whenever you play a penguin that play

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:38.510 
whenever you play a penguin that play
order<00:03:35.380> switches<00:03:35.860> directions<00:03:36.040> okay

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:38.520 
order switches directions okay

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:41.100 
order switches directions okay
whenever<00:03:39.520> you<00:03:39.610> play<00:03:39.700> crocodile<00:03:40.240> the<00:03:40.900> next

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.110 
whenever you play crocodile the next

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:43.980 
whenever you play crocodile the next
player<00:03:41.320> skips<00:03:41.710> his<00:03:41.830> turn<00:03:42.130> hmm<00:03:42.990> switch

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:43.990 
player skips his turn hmm switch

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:47.910 
player skips his turn hmm switch
direction<00:03:44.470> skip<00:03:45.190> turn<00:03:45.690> that's<00:03:46.690> from<00:03:47.320> I<00:03:47.740> think

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920 
direction skip turn that's from I think

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.840 
direction skip turn that's from I think
another<00:03:48.250> game<00:03:48.550> that<00:03:48.880> I<00:03:49.050> possibly<00:03:50.050> heard<00:03:50.620> of

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
another game that I possibly heard of

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:52.980 
another game that I possibly heard of
anyway<00:03:51.850> that's<00:03:52.240> the<00:03:52.390> way<00:03:52.510> the<00:03:52.660> game<00:03:52.780> works

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:52.990 
anyway that's the way the game works

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:55.290 
anyway that's the way the game works
very<00:03:53.320> simple<00:03:53.770> you<00:03:54.160> continue<00:03:54.610> doing<00:03:54.910> this<00:03:55.060> you

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:55.300 
very simple you continue doing this you

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.270 
very simple you continue doing this you
empty<00:03:55.570> your<00:03:55.690> hand<00:03:55.990> some<00:03:56.650> of<00:03:56.740> the<00:03:56.800> cards<00:03:57.100> do

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
empty your hand some of the cards do

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.190 
empty your hand some of the cards do
have<00:03:57.490> a<00:03:57.520> single<00:03:58.090> character<00:03:58.510> which<00:03:58.690> can<00:03:59.050> be<00:03:59.170> a

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 
have a single character which can be a

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.560 
have a single character which can be a
little<00:03:59.440> trickier<00:03:59.770> to<00:03:59.830> get<00:03:59.980> rid<00:04:00.250> of<00:04:00.280> but<00:04:00.580> that's

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:01.570 
little trickier to get rid of but that's

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:04.860 
little trickier to get rid of but that's
that<00:04:01.810> and<00:04:02.080> once<00:04:02.650> you<00:04:02.740> empty<00:04:03.040> your<00:04:03.220> hand<00:04:03.870> you

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
that and once you empty your hand you

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.470 
that and once you empty your hand you
grab<00:04:05.140> two<00:04:05.350> of<00:04:05.440> these<00:04:05.590> keep<00:04:06.340> one<00:04:06.580> make<00:04:07.120> one<00:04:07.330> an

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 
grab two of these keep one make one an

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.360 
grab two of these keep one make one an
active<00:04:07.870> rule<00:04:08.110> once<00:04:08.950> you<00:04:09.010> have<00:04:09.130> the<00:04:09.220> whole<00:04:09.340> map

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370 
active rule once you have the whole map

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:12.750 
active rule once you have the whole map
you<00:04:09.730> win<00:04:09.940> there<00:04:10.690> can<00:04:10.840> be<00:04:10.870> up<00:04:11.230> to<00:04:11.530> six<00:04:12.250> rules<00:04:12.550> in

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:12.760 
you win there can be up to six rules in

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.330 
you win there can be up to six rules in
play<00:04:13.000> and<00:04:13.330> so<00:04:14.080> if<00:04:14.290> you<00:04:14.380> would<00:04:14.500> play<00:04:14.710> a<00:04:14.740> seventh

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
play and so if you would play a seventh

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.880 
play and so if you would play a seventh
rule<00:04:15.670> you<00:04:16.360> instead<00:04:16.750> replace<00:04:17.170> one<00:04:17.410> of<00:04:17.440> the<00:04:17.590> six

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:17.890 
rule you instead replace one of the six

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:08.470 
now I do have a couple of reservations

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:12.450 
now I do have a couple of reservations
with<00:05:09.220> the<00:05:09.400> packets<00:05:09.910> as<00:05:10.060> they<00:05:10.090> hold<00:05:11.220> the<00:05:12.220> box

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:12.460 
with the packets as they hold the box

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:14.700 
with the packets as they hold the box
that's<00:05:12.700> 30<00:05:13.000> minutes<00:05:13.240> game<00:05:14.140> tends<00:05:14.440> to<00:05:14.560> be<00:05:14.680> a

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:14.710 
that's 30 minutes game tends to be a

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:18.480 
that's 30 minutes game tends to be a
little<00:05:15.070> longer<00:05:15.340> than<00:05:15.670> that<00:05:15.700> so<00:05:16.410> and<00:05:17.410> it's<00:05:17.650> you

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:18.490 
little longer than that so and it's you

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:20.100 
little longer than that so and it's you
know<00:05:18.610> I<00:05:18.640> know<00:05:19.090> if<00:05:19.360> you're<00:05:19.540> used<00:05:19.840> to<00:05:19.930> playing

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:20.110

uno<00:05:20.650> and<00:05:20.800> that<00:05:20.920> sort<00:05:21.220> of<00:05:21.250> thing<00:05:21.460> then<00:05:21.670> maybe

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:21.700 
uno and that sort of thing then maybe

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:25.350 
uno and that sort of thing then maybe
this<00:05:22.210> is<00:05:22.330> not<00:05:22.510> as<00:05:22.660> big<00:05:22.810> a<00:05:22.870> deal<00:05:22.960> okay<00:05:23.500> but<00:05:24.210> 30<00:05:25.210> is

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:25.360 
this is not as big a deal okay but 30 is

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:28.800 
this is not as big a deal okay but 30 is
good<00:05:25.630> and<00:05:25.840> longer<00:05:26.620> than<00:05:26.740> 30<00:05:27.390> isn't<00:05:28.390> as<00:05:28.570> good

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:28.810 
good and longer than 30 isn't as good

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:31.730 
good and longer than 30 isn't as good
and<00:05:29.050> this<00:05:29.200> is<00:05:29.370> longer<00:05:30.370> than<00:05:30.520> 30<00:05:30.729> minutes

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:31.740 
and this is longer than 30 minutes

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:33.770 
and this is longer than 30 minutes

that<00:06:16.260> would<00:06:16.560> have<00:06:16.680> done<00:06:16.890> for<00:06:17.070> the<00:06:17.430> index<00:06:17.910> a

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:18.830 
that would have done for the index a

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:21.950 
that would have done for the index a
symbol<00:06:19.830> and<00:06:20.100> a<00:06:20.190> color<00:06:20.630> something<00:06:21.630> that<00:06:21.750> really

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:21.960 
symbol and a color something that really

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:24.170 
symbol and a color something that really
pops<00:06:22.110> down<00:06:22.590> something<00:06:22.890> iconic<00:06:23.160> but<00:06:23.790> something

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:24.180 
pops down something iconic but something

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:26.570 
pops down something iconic but something
that<00:06:24.330> jumps<00:06:25.290> out<00:06:25.410> at<00:06:25.470> me<00:06:25.890> immediately

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:26.580 
that jumps out at me immediately

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:31.930 
that jumps out at me immediately
and<00:06:26.820> so<00:06:27.500> it's<00:06:29.390> visually<00:06:30.390> it's<00:06:30.720> a<00:06:30.840> little<00:06:31.110> busy

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:31.940 
and so it's visually it's a little busy

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:35.570 
and so it's visually it's a little busy
the<00:06:32.940> they<00:06:33.660> just<00:06:33.930> grabbed<00:06:34.440> the<00:06:34.800> the<00:06:35.160> animals

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:35.580 
the they just grabbed the the animals

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:36.500 
the they just grabbed the the animals
that<00:06:35.670> are<00:06:35.730> in<00:06:35.850> the<00:06:35.940> center<00:06:36.120> of<00:06:36.150> the<00:06:36.270> cards<00:06:36.480> and

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:36.510 
that are in the center of the cards and

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:37.790 
that are in the center of the cards and
put<00:06:36.630> them<00:06:36.720> in<00:06:36.870> the<00:06:36.990> in<00:06:37.140> the<00:06:37.230> corners<00:06:37.620> there

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:37.800 
put them in the in the corners there

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:40.880 
put them in the in the corners there
it's<00:06:38.190> too<00:06:38.400> busy<00:06:38.790> for<00:06:39.000> that<00:06:39.030> to<00:06:39.270> work<00:06:39.780> well<00:06:40.080> but

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:40.890 
it's too busy for that to work well but

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:43.430 
it's too busy for that to work well but
other<00:06:41.100> than<00:06:41.310> that<00:06:41.520> the<00:06:42.030> game<00:06:42.270> is<00:06:42.420> fun<00:06:42.660> clearly

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:43.440 
other than that the game is fun clearly

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:47.330 
other than that the game is fun clearly
a<00:06:43.470> family<00:06:43.800> game<00:06:45.560> it's<00:06:46.560> a<00:06:46.770> well<00:06:47.040> put<00:06:47.220> together

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:47.340 
a family game it's a well put together

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:49.670 
a family game it's a well put together
package<00:06:48.000> I<00:06:48.120> like<00:06:48.330> most<00:06:48.690> of<00:06:48.960> the<00:06:49.080> rules<00:06:49.290> like<00:06:49.500> I

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:49.680 
package I like most of the rules like I

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:51.440 
package I like most of the rules like I
said<00:06:49.980> I<00:06:50.010> think<00:06:50.220> some<00:06:50.580> of<00:06:50.610> them<00:06:50.790> slow<00:06:51.120> the<00:06:51.300> game

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:51.450 
said I think some of them slow the game

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:55.460 
said I think some of them slow the game
down<00:06:51.510> so<00:06:53.210> that<00:06:54.210> one<00:06:54.450> you<00:06:54.630> can<00:06:54.840> play<00:06:55.140> however

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:55.470 
down so that one you can play however

00:06:55.470 --> 00:06:58.100 
down so that one you can play however
you<00:06:55.650> want<00:06:55.890> to<00:06:56.100> you<00:06:56.250> do<00:06:56.460> draw<00:06:56.790> two<00:06:57.120> and<00:06:57.510> then

00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:58.110 
you want to you do draw two and then

00:06:58.110 --> 00:06:59.960 
you want to you do draw two and then
pick<00:06:58.380> the<00:06:58.410> one<00:06:58.650> you<00:06:58.680> want<00:06:58.830> so<00:06:59.280> you<00:06:59.370> can<00:06:59.400> sort<00:06:59.820> of

00:06:59.960 --> 00:06:59.970 
pick the one you want so you can sort of

00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:02.120 
pick the one you want so you can sort of
you<00:07:00.690> know<00:07:00.720> not<00:07:00.960> be<00:07:01.140> a<00:07:01.170> jerk<00:07:01.530> and<00:07:01.650> pick<00:07:01.830> the<00:07:01.950> rule

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:02.130 
you know not be a jerk and pick the rule

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:03.620 
you know not be a jerk and pick the rule
it's<00:07:02.340> really<00:07:02.670> annoying<00:07:02.940> right

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:03.630 
it's really annoying right

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:07.300
