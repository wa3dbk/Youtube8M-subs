00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 hi to all my friends and listeners 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.410
 welcome to this new installment of 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.910
 born with the joystick 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:11.550
 today I am here to tell you about a 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.670
 pretty important topic 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:17.820
 as you will all know in fact 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.850
 There are several pokémon video games 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.519
 types that in the first generation though 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.260
 they weren't so many in fact 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.199
 second two new ones have been added 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.720
 guys but it only happened in that one 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.880
 circumstance and matthew occurred 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.950
 A thing like that 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.380
 now the news is that it could 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.940
 occur again with pokémon hicks e 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:43.379
 pokemon ye then the sixth generation 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:47.160
 could indeed be revealed to 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:50.039
 moments the type of our new silvio 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:53.039
 in the new TV evolution that could 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:58.920
 to be precisely this type of everything 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:01:01.680
 new and still not revealed well before 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.960
 reveal to you what type you have 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.500
 already understood from the title above but for whom 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:11.280
 he didn't read it but I didn't anticipate it 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.890
 still I wanted to talk a little bit about 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.650
 output of who is in fact the author of 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:20.909
 this of this rumor of this news 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:24.600
 not confirmed is an Iberian boy a 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:27.479
 Spanish guy who revealed in 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.450
 advance through your profile of 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:33.689
 twitter these news as well as of course a 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.450
 this new type has also revealed the 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:41.079
 guy 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:42.890
 of the new pokémon choice of wealth al 

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:45.289
 you have understood 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:48.770
 the bird I showed you in 

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:51.170
 opening episode of pokémon ips e 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.390
 pokémon y just the day they were 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:56.090
 states the first was released 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:59.450
 trailer looks like this can 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:03.500
 that is not of home jt and steering wheel 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:07.610
 while our silvio and the other 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:11.720
 legendary pokémon or trio will be 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:13.400
 two pokemon of made type 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:17.980
 the new type will in fact be called 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:21.709
 just so the fatah type already exists a 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:24.380
 egg group of what is called precisely 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:27.530
 fatah and includes several pokemon 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:30.519
 legendary various pokémon including 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:33.560
 we also find togas eg the relative ones 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:37.160
 sensory and relative evolutions 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:41.420
 evolutions and 3 evolutions and then we find 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:43.959
 finally even holidays 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:47.030
 in fact, these pokémon seem to be 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:49.819
 ready to leave the normal type for 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:53.120
 irrigate in the new pokémon category 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:55.940
 fatah type could be added to 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.819
 they also our sel b and b not 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:02.989
 It would be more psycho type of grass, but grass 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:05.120
 fatah naturally I wanted you guys 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:07.130
 say to pay close attention to these 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:10.519
 news that might be 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:12.560
 interesting news and more than founded or 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:14.239
 news 6 that do not even have a 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.130
 bit of novelty 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:18.109
 so be careful if you want them 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:21.380
 spread through the sites and say 

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:22.730
 always as I'm doing that it is 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.910
 only from Rome 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:28.280
 then I wanted to tell you that in my opinion 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:30.730
 this addition of this new type of 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:33.799
 pokémon to really turn out 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:36.620
 interesting because why the pokémon 

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:38.720
 have been for too many generations like vi 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:42.720
 I said at the beginning always the usual ones 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:44.640
 guys it seems to me they are 18 and 19 now no 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.940
 horn could also have said one 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:51.290
 bullshit absurd, however, these types 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.550
 by now we know strength weaknesses 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:55.620
 etc 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:57.420
 so now that we know them 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:00.060
 like the palm of your hand 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:03.750
 I wish they would add something 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:07.410
 new so that poor for those who do the 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:11.100
 competitive batwing that will have to put back 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:15.390
 all teams in place, however 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:18.600
 they would also be a bit of diversity 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:20.459
 in short from the rest of the games 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:23.630
 the new competitive battles with 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:27.150
 pokémon xxx ey 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:29.640
 I personally with the battles 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:32.040
 competitive I don't try that much 

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:35.820
 because it is very very tiring to train 

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:38.430
 but with the vs I have to say 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:42.630
 so let's say I do the game 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:44.940
 but nothing more, let's say 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:47.400
 that I know well enough that this 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:52.140
 camp and I believe that such a junta 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:55.820
 not worth it would not hurt at all last 

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:59.460
 what to tell you before leaving them e 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:01.380
 to take leave is to observe the image that 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:03.750
 I saw it as a background 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:06.900
 if you see this is an image 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:09.540
 released precisely from a trailer of the 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:12.660
 short film in which all will appear 

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:15.810
 the forms of heavy and will be released in 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:17.640
 contemporary with the film the new film 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:20.160
 of the pokémon that with the form 

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:21.930
 alternative of mutual 

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:24.450
 in this picture if you notice well 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:26.670
 we find a vapor that is represented 

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:29.340
 precisely of blue with waves 

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:33.210
 our ex because he is represented as 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:36.530
 a gem with purplish colors in fact a 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:40.800
 symbolize our psycho type in 

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:44.760
 umbria is represented as in one 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:47.040
 gash all of dark colors while the 

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:51.810
 our livio obviously in the leaves 

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:53.470
 our glese is inside a crystal 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:59.050
 of ice 

00:05:53.470 --> 00:06:02.530
 but it has some crystal points of 

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:06.640
 ice is our flere ham e 

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:10.270
 around one to a fairy tale as is obvious 

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:12.510
 for his type the same thing ivey that is 

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:15.220
 within a 

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:18.760
 of an object that the color of its tir 

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:21.670
 has its color and is wrapped in a 

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:23.850
 little heart this little heart is a 

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:27.100
 symbolize precisely his friendship 

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:30.160
 while instead our jordan is 

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:32.560
 represented with all lightning 

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:35.050
 these pokémon obviously have some 

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:38.470
 referring to their type but if 

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:40.990
 let's look carefully at our new pokémon 

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:44.290
 our silvio observe it 

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:47.470
 carefully its container seems 

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:50.560
 giving does not seem to give a color 

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:52.750
 very specific of type he had been 

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:55.540
 steering wheel should have colored it 

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:58.660
 a darker color had been instead 

00:06:55.540 --> 00:07:02.410
 of another type like the one who has us 

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:05.830
 thought the normal type would be 

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:08.710
 white and thousand color therein instead 

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:10.110
 no it is none of these what could 

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:13.330
 wanting to say all this 

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:15.670
 well what i gave myself like 

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:18.670
 explanation is what I have you 

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:22.050
 told first however as I said 

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:24.880
 always by taking these 

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:29.050
 information with the utmost caution 

00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:31.930
 because they could turn out to be unfounded 

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:34.060
 I greet you and give you an appointment then a 

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:38.220
 Friday with the new episode of born with 

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:38.220
 the joystick soon
