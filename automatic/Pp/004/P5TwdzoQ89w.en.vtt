00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:07.039 

so<00:00:01.920> here's<00:00:02.280> my<00:00:02.429> sl3<00:00:02.970> top<00:00:03.570> mount<00:00:03.899> control<00:00:06.049> here

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
so here's my sl3 top mount control here

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.049 
so here's my sl3 top mount control here
is<00:00:07.230> these<00:00:07.589> are<00:00:07.859> the<00:00:07.950> ones<00:00:08.160> that<00:00:08.340> are<00:00:08.580> labeled

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
is these are the ones that are labeled

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.339 
is these are the ones that are labeled
with<00:00:09.900> a1<00:00:10.380> both<00:00:11.340> of<00:00:11.519> these<00:00:11.639> here<00:00:12.120> and<00:00:12.300> this<00:00:13.139> is

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
with a1 both of these here and this is

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.779 
with a1 both of these here and this is
the<00:00:13.969> throttle<00:00:14.969> that<00:00:15.809> I<00:00:16.470> can<00:00:17.100> move<00:00:17.310> it<00:00:17.460> with<00:00:17.580> my

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
the throttle that I can move it with my

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.480 
the throttle that I can move it with my
thumb<00:00:18.119> when<00:00:18.510> everything<00:00:18.990> is<00:00:19.109> in<00:00:19.260> neutral<00:00:19.650> but

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
thumb when everything is in neutral but

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.990 
thumb when everything is in neutral but
this<00:00:20.670> piece<00:00:21.000> is<00:00:21.270> not<00:00:22.550> switching<00:00:23.550> back<00:00:23.730> and

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
this piece is not switching back and

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.269 
this piece is not switching back and
forth<00:00:24.269> when<00:00:24.510> I<00:00:24.570> shift<00:00:25.019> the<00:00:25.320> shift<00:00:25.350> lever<00:00:25.949> from

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
forth when I shift the shift lever from

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.080 
forth when I shift the shift lever from
forward<00:00:26.849> to<00:00:26.880> reverse<00:00:27.560> or<00:00:28.560> back<00:00:29.400> and<00:00:29.550> forth<00:00:29.820> so

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
forward to reverse or back and forth so

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.049 
forward to reverse or back and forth so
right<00:00:30.689> now<00:00:30.960> if<00:00:31.289> I<00:00:31.500> put<00:00:31.740> it<00:00:31.830> in<00:00:31.949> forward<00:00:32.369> gear<00:00:32.550> on

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
right now if I put it in forward gear on

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:46.100 
right now if I put it in forward gear on
the<00:00:33.540> on<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:34.320> starboard<00:00:34.770> throttle<00:00:44.750> it<00:00:45.750> won't

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
the on the starboard throttle it won't

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.740 
the on the starboard throttle it won't
work<00:00:46.379> because<00:00:46.739> it's<00:00:47.280> because<00:00:47.910> this<00:00:48.239> piece<00:00:48.539> is

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
work because it's because this piece is

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.650 
work because it's because this piece is
in<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:48.960> reverse<00:00:49.530> position<00:00:50.000> if<00:00:51.000> I<00:00:51.180> put<00:00:51.420> it<00:00:51.510> in

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
in the reverse position if I put it in

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:57.529 
in the reverse position if I put it in
reverse<00:00:51.840> right<00:00:52.410> now<00:00:55.340> difficult<00:00:56.340> to<00:00:56.430> do<00:00:56.610> but

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
reverse right now difficult to do but

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.099 
reverse right now difficult to do but
you<00:00:57.809> can<00:00:57.960> see<00:00:58.140> if<00:00:58.230> I<00:00:58.350> put<00:00:58.559> it<00:00:58.649> in<00:00:58.739> reverse<00:01:00.109> right

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
you can see if I put it in reverse right

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.210 
you can see if I put it in reverse right
now<00:01:01.530> I<00:01:02.449> can<00:01:03.449> get<00:01:03.719> some<00:01:03.989> reverse<00:01:04.439> throttle<00:01:05.100> out

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
now I can get some reverse throttle out

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.300 
now I can get some reverse throttle out
of<00:01:05.489> it<00:01:05.640> like<00:01:06.090> right<00:01:06.360> there<00:01:06.750> so<00:01:07.650> see<00:01:07.920> you<00:01:08.100> see

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
of it like right there so see you see

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.910 
of it like right there so see you see
that<00:01:08.340> I'm<00:01:08.580> getting<00:01:08.790> reverse<00:01:09.470> now<00:01:10.470> when<00:01:10.619> I<00:01:10.650> go

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
that I'm getting reverse now when I go

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.679 
that I'm getting reverse now when I go
back<00:01:10.950> into<00:01:11.430> neutral<00:01:12.030> that<00:01:13.020> piece<00:01:13.409> is<00:01:13.770> not

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:14.689 
back into neutral that piece is not

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:17.929 
back into neutral that piece is not
flipping<00:01:15.689> back<00:01:15.930> where<00:01:16.259> it<00:01:16.380> needs<00:01:16.619> to<00:01:16.799> be<00:01:17.040> so

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
flipping back where it needs to be so

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.429 
flipping back where it needs to be so
that<00:01:17.970> I<00:01:18.180> can<00:01:18.420> get<00:01:19.070> forward<00:01:20.070> throttle<00:01:21.170> so<00:01:22.170> right

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
that I can get forward throttle so right

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:28.149 
that I can get forward throttle so right
now<00:01:22.619> I'm<00:01:22.799> in<00:01:22.920> neutral<00:01:23.159> I<00:01:25.580> pop<00:01:26.580> this<00:01:26.880> guy<00:01:26.939> back

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:28.159 
now I'm in neutral I pop this guy back

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:32.179 
now I'm in neutral I pop this guy back
back<00:01:29.159> into<00:01:29.670> this<00:01:30.329> position<00:01:30.930> so<00:01:31.200> it<00:01:31.409> was<00:01:31.650> here

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
back into this position so it was here

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.660 
back into this position so it was here
not<00:01:32.850> pop<00:01:33.270> it<00:01:33.450> back<00:01:33.479> to<00:01:33.900> here<00:01:34.200> now<00:01:34.979> I<00:01:35.009> can<00:01:35.369> put<00:01:35.579> it

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
not pop it back to here now I can put it

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.179 
not pop it back to here now I can put it
in<00:01:35.820> forward<00:01:36.329> and<00:01:36.360> I<00:01:36.930> can<00:01:37.140> get<00:01:37.320> throttle<00:01:37.829> out<00:01:37.979> of

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
in forward and I can get throttle out of

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.999 
in forward and I can get throttle out of
it<00:01:38.310> but<00:01:39.240> again<00:01:39.360> if<00:01:39.930> I<00:01:40.140> come<00:01:40.409> back<00:01:40.619> to<00:01:40.680> neutral

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
it but again if I come back to neutral

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.740 
it but again if I come back to neutral
and<00:01:41.280> try<00:01:41.520> to<00:01:41.579> put<00:01:41.820> it<00:01:41.939> straight<00:01:42.150> back<00:01:42.450> into

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
and try to put it straight back into

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.280 
and try to put it straight back into
reverse<00:01:43.490> that<00:01:44.490> piece<00:01:44.909> does<00:01:45.299> not<00:01:45.479> flip<00:01:45.990> back

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
reverse that piece does not flip back

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.109 
reverse that piece does not flip back
the<00:01:46.320> other<00:01:46.649> direction<00:01:47.100> so<00:01:47.340> that<00:01:47.549> I<00:01:47.759> can<00:01:47.939> get

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
the other direction so that I can get

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.120 
the other direction so that I can get
throttle<00:01:48.720> in<00:01:48.840> Reverse<00:01:49.259> so<00:01:49.590> now<00:01:49.770> I'm<00:01:49.950> in

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
throttle in Reverse so now I'm in

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.210 
throttle in Reverse so now I'm in
reverse<00:01:50.490> gear<00:01:51.590> but<00:01:52.590> now<00:01:52.740> I've<00:01:52.920> got<00:01:53.189> no

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
reverse gear but now I've got no

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.100 
reverse gear but now I've got no
throttle<00:01:53.700> because<00:01:54.180> it's<00:01:54.360> not<00:01:54.570> flipped<00:01:54.960> the

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
throttle because it's not flipped the

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.929 
throttle because it's not flipped the
right<00:01:55.259> direction<00:01:55.500> to<00:01:56.040> allow<00:01:56.280> that<00:01:56.549> throttle

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
right direction to allow that throttle

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.020 
right direction to allow that throttle
to<00:01:57.180> move<00:01:57.439> so<00:01:58.439> that's<00:01:58.740> my<00:01:58.950> problem<00:01:59.250> and<00:01:59.759> I

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
to move so that's my problem and I

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.459 
to move so that's my problem and I
appreciate<00:02:00.509> you<00:02:00.630> looking<00:02:00.780> at<00:02:01.079> it<00:02:01.200> thank<00:02:01.409> you
