 the knot had burst because from now on the game of the Betzdorfer and in the 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.920
 55 minutes scored again 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.990
 this says Mio that two to zero for the SG 06 Betzdorf 

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:30.309

00:02:54.369 --> 00:02:58.109
 I would have scored the 15 0 almost before the end but it should not be 

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:02.819
 the SG 06 wins superior with 14 0 and thus leaves the last
