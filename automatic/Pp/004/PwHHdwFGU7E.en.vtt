several different places and then you're

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.130 
several different places and then you're
using<00:01:30.869> that<00:01:32.180> so<00:01:33.180> you<00:01:33.240> still<00:01:33.570> have<00:01:33.780> a<00:01:33.810> free<00:01:34.110> hand

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.130 
usually you just do it a few seconds but
that<00:02:02.250> could<00:02:02.579> be<00:02:02.790> enough<00:02:03.090> to<00:02:03.390> mess<00:02:03.899> up<00:02:04.110> your

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
that could be enough to mess up your

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.530 
that could be enough to mess up your
fabric<00:02:04.680> so<00:02:04.860> I<00:02:04.890> usually<00:02:05.219> use<00:02:05.430> a<00:02:05.549> pressing<00:02:06.420> cloth

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
fabric so I usually use a pressing cloth

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.949 
fabric so I usually use a pressing cloth
for<00:02:06.869> almost<00:02:07.110> everything<00:02:07.770> and<00:02:08.629> then<00:02:09.629> what<00:02:09.840> you

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
for almost everything and then what you

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.240 
for almost everything and then what you
can<00:02:10.110> do<00:02:10.229> is<00:02:10.349> keep<00:02:10.500> checking<00:02:10.860> yet

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
can do is keep checking yet

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:13.800 
can do is keep checking yet
and<00:02:12.430> yeah<00:02:12.820> like<00:02:13.000> I<00:02:13.060> said<00:02:13.390> now<00:02:13.570> if<00:02:13.660> you've

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
and yeah like I said now if you've

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.350 
and yeah like I said now if you've
stretched<00:02:14.260> it<00:02:14.500> out<00:02:14.650> too<00:02:14.860> much<00:02:15.100> you<00:02:15.580> can<00:02:16.180> read

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
stretched it out too much you can read

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.390 
stretched it out too much you can read
AMPA<00:02:16.750> NIT<00:02:16.870> or<00:02:17.050> usually<00:02:17.500> it's<00:02:17.620> still<00:02:17.920> damp<00:02:18.130> so

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
AMPA NIT or usually it's still damp so

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.040 
AMPA NIT or usually it's still damp so
what<00:02:18.580> you<00:02:18.670> can<00:02:18.850> do<00:02:19.030> is<00:02:19.240> you<00:02:19.420> can<00:02:19.600> kind<00:02:19.900> of

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
what you can do is you can kind of

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:24.090 
what you can do is you can kind of
scrunch<00:02:20.380> it<00:02:20.560> back<00:02:20.770> up<00:02:21.040> and<00:02:22.470> then<00:02:23.470> you<00:02:23.590> can<00:02:23.740> Pat

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
scrunch it back up and then you can Pat

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.380 
scrunch it back up and then you can Pat
it<00:02:24.340> down<00:02:25.050> while<00:02:26.050> it's<00:02:26.320> wet<00:02:26.650> and<00:02:27.070> you<00:02:27.940> can<00:02:28.120> even

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390
