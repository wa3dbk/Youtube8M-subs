you guys who don't know rush hour 3 is
is<00:00:23.820> an<00:00:23.970> older<00:00:24.330> map<00:00:24.510> that<00:00:24.689> was<00:00:24.810> used<00:00:25.019> in<00:00:25.140> some<00:00:25.289> of

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
is an older map that was used in some of

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.200 
is an older map that was used in some of
the<00:00:25.410> older<00:00:25.650> leagues<00:00:25.830> and<00:00:26.670> it's<00:00:26.880> not<00:00:27.029> in

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
the older leagues and it's not in

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.269 
the older leagues and it's not in
playing<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.630> pro<00:00:27.810> leagues<00:00:28.080> anymore<00:00:28.650> it's

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
playing the pro leagues anymore it's

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:30.589 
playing the pro leagues anymore it's
only<00:00:29.429> on<00:00:29.609> three<00:00:29.789> spawn<00:00:30.029> points<00:00:30.390> I<00:00:30.420> think

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
only on three spawn points I think

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:31.939 
only on three spawn points I think
overall<00:00:30.900> it's<00:00:31.109> considered<00:00:31.470> to<00:00:31.529> be<00:00:31.650> fairly

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
overall it's considered to be fairly

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.700 
overall it's considered to be fairly
balanced<00:00:32.460> though<00:00:32.719> the<00:00:33.719> statistics<00:00:34.260> show<00:00:34.530> a

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
balanced though the statistics show a

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.610 
balanced though the statistics show a
slight<00:00:35.190> preponderance<00:00:35.820> towards<00:00:36.180> turn<00:00:36.620> that

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
slight preponderance towards turn that

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.470 
slight preponderance towards turn that
being<00:00:37.890> said<00:00:38.100> I<00:00:38.160> think<00:00:38.280> this<00:00:38.670> map<00:00:38.910> is<00:00:38.940> actually

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
being said I think this map is actually

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.060 
being said I think this map is actually
probably<00:00:39.780> good<00:00:40.050> favor<00:00:40.410> save<00:00:40.680> yours<00:00:40.829> if<00:00:40.980> you're

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
probably good favor save yours if you're

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.260 
probably good favor save yours if you're
scouting<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.460> right<00:00:41.550> direction<00:00:41.700> was<00:00:41.969> over<00:00:42.120> I

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
scouting the right direction was over I

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.400 
scouting the right direction was over I
think<00:00:42.420> this<00:00:42.480> map<00:00:42.660> is<00:00:42.690> probably<00:00:43.050> gonna<00:00:43.170> favor

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
think this map is probably gonna favor

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.380 
think this map is probably gonna favor
Savior<00:00:43.890> because<00:00:44.370> I<00:00:44.579> think<00:00:44.910> he's<00:00:45.090> probably

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
Savior because I think he's probably

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.060 
Savior because I think he's probably
played<00:00:45.870> that<00:00:46.020> I<00:00:46.050> I<00:00:46.200> have<00:00:46.530> to<00:00:46.649> be<00:00:46.710> honest<00:00:46.950> I've

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
played that I I have to be honest I've

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.619 
played that I I have to be honest I've
never<00:00:47.100> seen<00:00:47.460> a<00:00:47.520> match<00:00:47.700> on<00:00:47.850> this<00:00:48.000> snack<00:00:48.210> before

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
never seen a match on this snack before

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.450 
never seen a match on this snack before
or<00:00:48.780> at<00:00:48.840> least<00:00:48.960> I<00:00:49.020> don't<00:00:49.079> recall<00:00:49.289> seeing<00:00:49.710> one<00:00:49.829> I

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
or at least I don't recall seeing one I

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.189 
or at least I don't recall seeing one I
might<00:00:51.120> have<00:00:51.329> at<00:00:51.449> some<00:00:51.570> point<00:00:51.840> but<00:00:51.960> I<00:00:51.989> just

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
might have at some point but I just

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.560 
might have at some point but I just
don't<00:00:52.320> remember<00:00:52.440> it<00:00:52.649> but<00:00:53.190> um<00:00:53.489> I<00:00:53.730> think<00:00:54.480> this

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
don't remember it but um I think this

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.180 
don't remember it but um I think this
map<00:00:54.780> is<00:00:54.809> actually<00:00:55.199> got<00:00:55.350> all<00:00:55.559> that<00:00:55.770> probably

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
map is actually got all that probably

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.310 
map is actually got all that probably
flashing<00:00:56.789> it<00:00:56.940> is<00:00:57.180> too<00:00:57.510> young<00:00:57.719> remember<00:00:57.960> flash

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
flashing it is too young remember flash

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.680 
flashing it is too young remember flash
is<00:00:58.530> just<00:00:58.739> barely<00:00:58.980> sixteen<00:00:59.460> years<00:00:59.609> old<00:00:59.760> so

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
is just barely sixteen years old so

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.090 
is just barely sixteen years old so
flash<00:01:00.960> is<00:01:01.140> probably<00:01:01.379> too<00:01:01.590> young<00:01:01.620> to<00:01:01.949> have

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
flash is probably too young to have

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.740 
flash is probably too young to have
played<00:01:02.309> on<00:01:02.430> it<00:01:02.520> before<00:01:02.670> and<00:01:03.059> I'm<00:01:03.120> not<00:01:03.300> sure<00:01:03.329> how

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
played on it before and I'm not sure how

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.600 
played on it before and I'm not sure how
much<00:01:03.899> motivation<00:01:04.439> he<00:01:04.680> would<00:01:04.830> have<00:01:04.920> had<00:01:05.100> to

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
much motivation he would have had to

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.310 
much motivation he would have had to
practice<00:01:06.090> for<00:01:06.270> an<00:01:06.360> exhibition<00:01:06.720> match<00:01:06.960> up

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
practice for an exhibition match up

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.410 
practice for an exhibition match up
albeit<00:01:08.220> being<00:01:08.520> in<00:01:08.670> Savior<00:01:09.030> I<00:01:09.060> think<00:01:09.270> probably

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
albeit being in Savior I think probably

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.810 
albeit being in Savior I think probably
the<00:01:09.930> fact<00:01:10.380> that<00:01:10.470> Savior<00:01:10.890> has<00:01:11.010> been<00:01:11.490> in<00:01:11.580> a<00:01:11.670> slump

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
the fact that Savior has been in a slump

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.609 
the fact that Savior has been in a slump
of<00:01:12.060> late<00:01:12.270> and<00:01:12.420> that<00:01:12.540> jaedong<00:01:13.080> really<00:01:13.350> has<00:01:13.470> been

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
of late and that jaedong really has been

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.469 
of late and that jaedong really has been
the<00:01:13.830> player<00:01:14.070> to<00:01:14.250> beat<00:01:14.460> flash<00:01:15.000> might<00:01:15.240> have<00:01:15.360> come

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
the player to beat flash might have come

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:16.340 
the player to beat flash might have come
into<00:01:15.630> this<00:01:15.750> match<00:01:15.810> a<00:01:16.049> little<00:01:16.259> bit

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
into this match a little bit

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.840 
into this match a little bit
overconfident<00:01:16.650> perhaps<00:01:17.159> not<00:01:17.340> practice<00:01:17.759> as

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
overconfident perhaps not practice as

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.730 
overconfident perhaps not practice as
much<00:01:17.880> as<00:01:18.119> he<00:01:18.210> would<00:01:18.330> have<00:01:18.509> on<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.350> other<00:01:19.560> hand

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
much as he would have on the other hand

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.260 
much as he would have on the other hand
I<00:01:19.890> think<00:01:19.920> Savior<00:01:20.400> probably<00:01:20.759> has<00:01:20.880> everything

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
I think Savior probably has everything

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.640 
I think Savior probably has everything
to<00:01:21.390> prove<00:01:21.509> and<00:01:21.930> wants<00:01:22.290> to<00:01:22.320> prove<00:01:22.590> something

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
to prove and wants to prove something

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.890 
to prove and wants to prove something
real<00:01:23.159> how<00:01:24.290> aggressive<00:01:25.290> Savior<00:01:25.680> is<00:01:25.830> and<00:01:26.220> how

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:26.900 
real how aggressive Savior is and how

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.179 
real how aggressive Savior is and how
competitive<00:01:27.900> his<00:01:28.200> personality<00:01:28.829> is<00:01:28.860> he's<00:01:29.070> an

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
competitive his personality is he's an

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.100 
competitive his personality is he's an
alpha<00:01:29.340> male<00:01:29.579> if<00:01:29.729> I<00:01:29.820> ever<00:01:29.909> saw<00:01:30.150> one<00:01:30.180> so

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
alpha male if I ever saw one so

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.899 
alpha male if I ever saw one so
obviously<00:01:31.500> Savior<00:01:31.920> Savior<00:01:32.400> having<00:01:32.610> a<00:01:32.670> lot<00:01:32.790> to

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
obviously Savior Savior having a lot to

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.039 
obviously Savior Savior having a lot to
prove<00:01:33.090> probably<00:01:33.479> would<00:01:33.570> have<00:01:33.630> practiced

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
prove probably would have practiced

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.149 
prove probably would have practiced
harder<00:01:34.320> and<00:01:34.470> I<00:01:34.500> think<00:01:34.680> this<00:01:34.799> map<00:01:35.009> would

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
harder and I think this map would

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.319 
harder and I think this map would
probably<00:01:35.520> give<00:01:35.670> save<00:01:35.850> you<00:01:35.939> a<00:01:35.970> little<00:01:36.090> bit<00:01:36.270> of

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
probably give save you a little bit of

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:37.370 
probably give save you a little bit of
an<00:01:36.390> advantage<00:01:36.540> because<00:01:36.810> he's<00:01:37.079> probably

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
an advantage because he's probably

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.990 
an advantage because he's probably
played<00:01:37.799> on<00:01:37.920> it<00:01:38.009> before<00:01:38.159> and<00:01:38.729> probably

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
played on it before and probably

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.670 
played on it before and probably
understands<00:01:39.750> them<00:01:39.990> out<00:01:40.079> probably<00:01:40.350> a<00:01:40.590> little

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
understands them out probably a little

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.770 
understands them out probably a little
bit<00:01:40.860> better<00:01:41.009> than<00:01:41.250> flash<00:01:41.430> does<00:01:41.850> flash<00:01:42.420> I<00:01:42.600> don't

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
bit better than flash does flash I don't

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.030 
bit better than flash does flash I don't
think<00:01:42.960> would<00:01:43.020> have<00:01:43.140> had<00:01:43.259> much<00:01:43.409> practice<00:01:43.619> on<00:01:43.920> it

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
think would have had much practice on it

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.690 
think would have had much practice on it
so<00:01:44.610> that<00:01:45.110> being<00:01:46.110> said<00:01:46.170> I<00:01:46.380> hopefully<00:01:46.979> will<00:01:47.250> see

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
so that being said I hopefully will see

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.039 
so that being said I hopefully will see
an<00:01:47.759> interesting<00:01:48.119> matchup<00:01:48.420> definitely<00:01:48.869> gave

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
an interesting matchup definitely gave

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.830 
an interesting matchup definitely gave
one<00:01:49.290> we<00:01:49.979> saw<00:01:50.159> some<00:01:50.670> glimpses<00:01:51.420> of<00:01:51.570> the<00:01:51.659> old

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
one we saw some glimpses of the old

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.840 
one we saw some glimpses of the old
Savior<00:01:52.229> I<00:01:52.290> know<00:01:52.649> that<00:01:53.040> I<00:01:53.189> praise<00:01:53.460> singer<00:01:53.759> too

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
Savior I know that I praise singer too

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:54.980 
Savior I know that I praise singer too
high<00:01:53.939> I<00:01:53.970> have<00:01:54.149> in<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.329> last<00:01:54.360> game<00:01:54.630> and<00:01:54.750> I<00:01:54.780> think

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
high I have in the last game and I think

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.719 
high I have in the last game and I think
we<00:01:55.439> need<00:01:55.560> to<00:01:55.649> temper<00:01:55.979> that<00:01:56.009> with<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:56.369> dose<00:01:56.520> of

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
we need to temper that with the dose of

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.760 
we need to temper that with the dose of
reality<00:01:56.850> here<00:01:57.270> we<00:01:57.420> need<00:01:57.540> we<00:01:57.780> need<00:01:57.810> to<00:01:58.110> calm

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
reality here we need we need to calm

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:59.990 
reality here we need we need to calm
down<00:01:58.799> a<00:01:59.040> little<00:01:59.250> bit<00:01:59.399> I<00:01:59.460> think<00:01:59.610> they<00:01:59.939> were

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
down a little bit I think they were

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.950 
down a little bit I think they were
there<00:02:00.270> were<00:02:00.360> quite<00:02:00.540> a<00:02:00.600> few<00:02:00.689> mistakes

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
there were quite a few mistakes

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.780 
there were quite a few mistakes
especially<00:02:01.259> in<00:02:01.740> Savior<00:02:02.009> scourge<00:02:02.250> control<00:02:02.640> and

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
especially in Savior scourge control and

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.399 
especially in Savior scourge control and
even<00:02:02.880> to<00:02:03.149> an<00:02:03.210> extent<00:02:03.479> snorkel<00:02:03.840> control<00:02:04.140> we<00:02:04.259> saw

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
even to an extent snorkel control we saw

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.230 
even to an extent snorkel control we saw
some<00:02:04.590> great<00:02:04.740> micro<00:02:05.040> from<00:02:05.219> flash<00:02:05.430> and<00:02:05.700> really

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
some great micro from flash and really

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.150 
some great micro from flash and really

get speed upgrades earlier this year I
think<00:02:34.350> he<00:02:34.560> went<00:02:34.680> nine<00:02:34.920> hash<00:02:35.190> I<00:02:35.310> don't<00:02:35.460> think<00:02:35.610> he

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
think he went nine hash I don't think he

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.340 
think he went nine hash I don't think he
got<00:02:35.910> 12<00:02:36.180> drones<00:02:36.420> so<00:02:36.810> then<00:02:36.930> you<00:02:37.020> got<00:02:37.140> nine

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
got 12 drones so then you got nine

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.020 
got 12 drones so then you got nine
droves<00:02:37.590> a<00:02:37.770> hash<00:02:38.010> then<00:02:38.310> spawning<00:02:38.700> pool<00:02:38.850> and

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
droves a hash then spawning pool and

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.850 
droves a hash then spawning pool and
extractor<00:02:39.480> and<00:02:40.020> this<00:02:40.230> might<00:02:40.380> work<00:02:40.530> out<00:02:40.680> very

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
extractor and this might work out very

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.290 
extractor and this might work out very
well<00:02:40.980> for<00:02:41.100> Savior<00:02:41.400> because<00:02:41.490> he's<00:02:41.700> now<00:02:41.820> scouted

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
well for Savior because he's now scouted

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.300 
well for Savior because he's now scouted
