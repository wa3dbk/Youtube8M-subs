00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.040
 fine very well with confidence with rhythm 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:13.200
 with strength with desire although as a 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:17.590
 level of game and look I hope to continue 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:21.660
 well, work, work, illusion 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:21.660
 determination to do things well 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:25.330
 Well, I'm very, very focused now 

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:28.630
 same 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:32.290
 in my career I find myself and I want 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:34.809
 continue we will see it we will discover it 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.320
 very high or the highest but it will not be 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:37.210
 easy 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.590
 I think that team has gone through a 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.410
 complicated season with more connections 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:44.410
 that has allowed us to be 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:47.500
 regular at certain times yes but 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:49.930
 now now what you have to try is 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:52.390
 with all the equipment find our 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.559
 better level of play and win at 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.170
 different equipment that we are 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:58.330
 I do not think the projects if you want 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.120
 move forward and you want to fight for the child 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:03.430
 you have to win everyone then 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:06.430
 try one another to avoid 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:09.369
 another one to another would be for I think for 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:11.050
 my team an error also by the 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:13.869
 season and how do I find 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:15.850
 physically and good from there then 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:17.440
 I will make a decision, not especially of 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:21.009
 try to make him comfortable 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:25.210
 I welcome him to make him feel or his 

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:26.229
 trust and I think that I think we have 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.320
 we did it 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:31.500
 he carries I do not know 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.720
 the great merit for how he has played a 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.300
 It was a very positive year now that it was 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.310
 the most important thing of the season and it's 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:42.420
 where he also has to continue has 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:45.900
 an important role and a year occasion 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:48.410
 but something very positive for me for me 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.410
 improvable 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:57.290
 very happy very pleased with how they have 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:59.360
 gone things and how are they going and the 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:01.690
 level that I am able to play during 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.690
 all season
