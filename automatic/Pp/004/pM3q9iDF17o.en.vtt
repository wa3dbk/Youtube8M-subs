00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:29.640
 over meadows and through the forest 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.040
 the cross country course of the 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.500
 third grade exam of the rai tv cups 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.630
 to have an overview on the terrain and 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.580
 his horse on all tasks optimally 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:42.870
 to be able to prepare to go 

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:45.090
 Participants the route in advance on foot 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.520
 the very first 80 really on the 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.290
 first impression one attains because that 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.300
 is ultimately the impression of the 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:52.949
 the quarter has the horse knows the 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.050
 course and does not really see 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.940
 this one sometimes pulls in 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.230
 very last moment and especially there 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.720
 also important to pay attention to how 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.000
 could which situation ausfÃ¤hrt act 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:04.979
 and that is why it is above all the 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.979
 first impression important to me and then 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.210
 the more often I tinker the route 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.640
 I'm for every obstacle, so to speak 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.610
 individually exact plan next to me exactly before 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.440
 where I was bored when I do what 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.289
 I react to him what a situation 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:21.360
 so i should in all situations it should 

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:24.710
 not come as planned 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.710
 can also react accordingly 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:35.719
 the most important thing is of course that 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.060
 versatility horse that the rider 

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:39.649
 and the thing in itself then trusts 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.710
 Of course, I'm also thinking about that right now 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:44.990
 with the young horses how far I am 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:48.020
 best which ways do I lead with that 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:50.030
 horse as good as possible or as early as it is 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.549
 The task can and does recognize 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:55.340
 that's not surprising, so to speak 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:58.429
 not quite easy here, because often 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.719
 times so through the forest goes around then 

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:01.009
 you ride a turn and then you stand 

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:02.359
 a jump but then you have to then 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:04.520
 Of course, just think 

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:04.849
 that then every turn as good as it 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.549
 going 

00:02:04.849 --> 00:02:08.349
 he does not ride out of it 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:10.759
 Overwhelmed 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:12.500
 even during the leave is the 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:14.690
 Rider hopes the track imaginary 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.750
 he prepares for the 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:20.019
 note check must be preparation point 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.099
 means you have the obstacle 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:25.430
 somehow a point you look at 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:28.430
 choose a tree or stone or otherwise 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:31.220
 Something where you start on that 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.930
 I'm prepared for the jump 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.569
 I would like the upper body once after 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.829
 I galloped for a long time or something 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:38.510
 career my horse is ready once 

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:40.970
 before the next task comes and 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:44.170
 I'll see you riding again 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.170
 distances can be overcome 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.790
 during the country change have to 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.079
 Horse and rider full on each other 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:52.329
 being able to leave 

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:53.980
 only the rider knows the way and must 

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:56.470
 pretend to the horse this 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.329
 straight young and inexperienced horses 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.329
 The rider should be difficult 

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:03.510
 support tasks and so on 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:06.579
 Create self-confidence and routine 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:09.340
 that's natural in the square 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:10.690
 so one comes from the forest the horses 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.060
 also see the big tournament place 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:15.760
 in light sand it goes over one 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.870
 tree trunk on the place up so far 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.390
 it may be that the horses are there 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.500
 maybe a bit 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:21.010
 wait and say oh what is coming now 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.260
 here 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.209
 then you have to immediately in the left 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:28.389
 keep sending keep in flow 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:30.609
 and then a jump with one 

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:33.250
 dig before even so far as is 

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:34.959
 then immediately right the next the 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.700
 next obstacle complex just after one 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:39.790
 some gallop where that again jump 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:41.109
 so horse has a bit to look so 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:43.060
 here in the square it is really very 

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:45.310
 very fast if you are above it 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:48.370
 are spread in principle a large 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:50.079
 Right circle comes immediately narrow 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:51.340
 So a third corner of the front pointed 

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:52.629
 is then comes back to a narrower 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:54.639
 then jump between owls 

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:56.440
 maybe we are there too 

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:57.849
 one or the other is still driving 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.440
 bit irritated you have such a jump 

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:01.150
 not too often at home and then 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.859
 directly back from the square over two 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.699
 tree trunks with a combination too 

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:05.949
 liquid built 

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:07.299
 insofar as that right here on the 

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:09.819
 tournament place already strike on strike 

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:11.530
 Follow to follow and then you have to 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:13.900
 already see that one keeps the rhythm 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:15.280
 the valuable driving aid has the 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.709
 thigh tune has the reins 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.840
 positively frame and self-assurance 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:21.889
 gives and sees to see that one 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.990
 rhythm world 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:25.729
 the preparation for the field test 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:28.009
 is as important as the domestic one 

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:29.419
 training the fortune of the horse and 

00:04:28.009 --> 00:04:31.969
 that can be the rider's 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:34.219
 only those who are optimally focused on the tasks in the 

00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:35.389
 prepared terrain can be rides 

00:04:34.219 --> 00:04:37.639
 sovereign and with the right one 

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:41.800
 to steer support through the terrain 

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:41.800
 and thus achieve the goal 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:00.750
 the 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:00.750
 hello we are rolling in here now
