00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:05.140
 hello people welcome once more alone 

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:08.349
 for everyone today we are going to make a video of 

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:11.080
 emergency recipe would be a live heart 

00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:13.450
 and we're going to teach you how to make a sandwich 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:18.209
 toasted but in this case we 're going to 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:18.209
 Toast using an iron 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.650
 today we not only have anxiety in a 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:25.240
 technique to toast the sandwiches but 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:26.680
 that we also take teaches a recipe for 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.110
 sandwiches that is one that I like 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:31.930
 very much and today they are going to give an account because 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:33.550
 is that I'm lately so fat but 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.860
 I'm already doing something about it with 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:38.980
 that's what we're going to use besides the 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.660
 aluminum paper plate and to make 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:45.190
 our sandwiches we are going to use bread 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:46.839
 form some oregano butter and the 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:50.260
 fill that we're going to put that goes to 

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:52.089
 be tomato cheese and olives first 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.729
 let's take a bread and we're going to put 

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:56.409
 butter by one of the sides now let's go 

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:58.869
 to put the butter side to the side 

00:00:56.409 --> 00:01:00.760
 of the plate that is face down after 

00:00:58.869 --> 00:01:03.070
 let's put some cheese in this 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.170
 case I'm going to put two dams now I'm going 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.810
 cut the olives I'll put 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:10.530
 this way and then I'm going to put a little 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.530
 tomato 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:17.490
 one that you already all this ready I'm going to 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.490
 put a little oregano 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.380
 at this time if you want him 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.210
 they can put a little salt I do not 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.710
 I usually eat with salt, I do not put 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:27.200
 go out to the food so I'm going to do it 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.759
 in this way and now I'm going to do everything 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.310
 the process in reverse I'm going to go back to 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:36.040
 put the olives I'm going to put cheese 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:38.500
 again and then I'm going to put the bread 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:42.110
 now for the top of the bread I'm going 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:44.090
 to put butter again 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.070
 now let's proceed to the state of 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.450
 our angles for that we're going to use 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.340
 the aluminum cut 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.440
 let's open the aluminum foil we're going to 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.090
 put the sandwich on top and let's 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:56.090
 cut a piece enough 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:59.060
 big enough to wrap around the whole 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:01.460
 sandwich and now we're going to press a 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.350
 little with the iron for a while not 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.690
 there is a specific time to do this 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.640
 we are going to review what and when we see 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:09.380
 that this toast is going to give 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.620
 back and we will do the same for the 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.630
 another side because of the aroma that is coming out 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:17.900
 it seems that it is almost finished 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:19.420
 to see how our sÃ¡nguche was 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.700
 toasted 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.690
 an iron 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.690
 ah 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.930
 it's an excellent result for a 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.810
 emergency we can touch a sandwich 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.370
 using an iron and now it 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.230
 they will ask why we put butter 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.510
 outside and not inside the sandwich 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.489
 because butter is what helps 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.560
 it is more toasted all this that you 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:52.170
 they're seeing toasting is thanks to the 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.000
 butter I hope you enjoy it good 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.500
 appetite and remember that if you want to see 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.569
 more videos like these can enter the 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.260
 one page for all 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:00.260
 bye 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.849
 now that summer is selling 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:07.550
 I will be leaving two recipes 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:10.550
 interesting one of them is how to do 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:12.709
 ice cream in 10 minutes but leave here 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:14.599
 above obviously but what they do 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:16.370
 in 10 minutes you do not have to look 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:18.200
 the ice and all that salt and everything 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.090
 but simply by making the recipe 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.190
 and putting in the freezer gives the same 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:24.770
 result 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:26.180
 and if after making the ice cream you 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:28.370
 you left wanting more 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.410
 then I leave here below a recipe for 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:33.320
 how to make the cones 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:35.810
 edible cups for ice cream te 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:37.610
 I leave it here to find out if it is what it is 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.320
 a pretty interesting recipe 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:41.120
 so remember there are the other channels 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:44.120
