00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:59.340

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.829

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:13.200
 many but many mountains here face the 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.910
 world is practically only of mountains 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.430
 Look, there's a place practically 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:20.040
 It's a good idea for us to make a 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:23.280
 our normal construction in debt 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:26.370
 And he'll get you to make a 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:29.969
 nice building there some buildings and pa 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:32.640
 here is also the most snow paper for 

00:03:29.969 --> 00:03:34.680

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:37.799
 there has more mountains guy has a lot of 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:41.370
 mountain here and cup and I know the world 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:44.129
 of the mountains much of the time looks only at 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:47.459
 light here is going to start here 

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:50.909
 starts a new language of snow very nice 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:52.349
 and the world I think that's what it gives 

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:54.510
 To show you guys, it's going to have 

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:58.109
 But I went back to what I 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:04:00.720
 you can give one explored but what 

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:02.970
 I really wanted to focus is that and 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:07.049
 I think I had it up front here too. 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:09.120
 has a kind of ravine in the fear of 

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:11.159
 mountain that is cool too 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.900
