hi guys it's Steve here and today I'm
doing<00:00:19.539> unboxing<00:00:20.230> of<00:00:20.350> the<00:00:20.439> Asus<00:00:20.800> GTX<00:00:21.099> 680<00:00:22.200> this

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:23.200 
doing unboxing of the Asus GTX 680 this

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.019 
doing unboxing of the Asus GTX 680 this
is<00:00:23.349> the<00:00:23.470> overclocked<00:00:23.860> version<00:00:23.890> of<00:00:24.369> a<00:00:24.460> card<00:00:24.730> and

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:25.029 
is the overclocked version of a card and

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:27.570 
is the overclocked version of a card and
at<00:00:25.150> the<00:00:25.210> moment<00:00:25.360> it<00:00:25.689> retails<00:00:26.110> for<00:00:26.200> around<00:00:26.580> 240

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:27.580 
at the moment it retails for around 240

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:32.249 
at the moment it retails for around 240
to<00:00:27.820> 270<00:00:28.540> pounds<00:00:30.360> let's<00:00:31.360> start<00:00:31.660> by<00:00:31.869> taking<00:00:32.079> a

00:00:32.249 --> 00:00:32.259 
to 270 pounds let's start by taking a

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:41.040 
to 270 pounds let's start by taking a
look<00:00:32.349> at<00:00:32.529> the<00:00:32.590> box<00:00:39.420> this<00:00:40.420> is<00:00:40.570> a<00:00:40.600> 2<00:00:40.840> gigabyte

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:41.050 
look at the box this is a 2 gigabyte

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:48.530 
look at the box this is a 2 gigabyte
card<00:00:41.649> that<00:00:42.070> runs<00:00:42.280> at<00:00:42.489> 1008<00:00:43.420> to<00:00:43.570> 4<00:00:43.750> mega<00:00:43.960> Hertz

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:48.540 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.520 

on<00:00:49.540> the<00:00:49.720> left<00:00:49.930> it<00:00:50.080> shows<00:00:50.260> you<00:00:50.410> which

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:50.530 
on the left it shows you which

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:52.500 
on the left it shows you which
connections<00:00:51.070> it<00:00:51.250> has<00:00:51.280> there<00:00:51.850> are<00:00:51.940> two<00:00:52.120> DVI

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:52.510 
connections it has there are two DVI

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.890 
connections it has there are two DVI
ports<00:00:53.200> one<00:00:53.530> HDMI<00:00:54.190> or<00:00:54.490> one<00:00:54.640> DisplayPort<00:00:55.300> the

ports one HDMI or one DisplayPort the

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.330 
ports one HDMI or one DisplayPort the
middle<00:00:56.170> says<00:00:56.410> it's<00:00:56.650> built<00:00:56.890> with<00:00:56.980> components

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:57.340 
middle says it's built with components

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:59.160 
middle says it's built with components
let's<00:00:57.880> turn<00:00:58.090> off<00:00:58.300> times<00:00:58.600> longer<00:00:58.900> than<00:00:59.050> normal

00:00:59.160 --> 00:00:59.170 
let's turn off times longer than normal

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.069 
let's turn off times longer than normal
and<00:00:59.710> on<00:01:00.130> the<00:01:00.280> right<00:01:00.430> it<00:01:00.579> has<00:01:00.610> VJ<00:01:01.120> hotwire<00:01:01.570> so

00:01:02.069 --> 00:01:02.079 
and on the right it has VJ hotwire so

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:03.600 
and on the right it has VJ hotwire so

yep<00:02:50.890> nothing<00:02:51.250> else<00:02:55.890> all<00:02:56.890> right<00:02:56.920> let's<00:02:57.280> take<00:02:57.430> it

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:57.490 
yep nothing else all right let's take it

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:11.910 
yep nothing else all right let's take it
out<00:02:57.730> of<00:02:57.850> a<00:02:58.000> key<00:03:10.110> now<00:03:11.110> you'd<00:03:11.290> expect<00:03:11.740> it's
