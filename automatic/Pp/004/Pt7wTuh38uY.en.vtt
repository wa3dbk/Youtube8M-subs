end we're hoping that these videos will

00:00:26.059 --> 00:00:30.019 
end we're hoping that these videos will
enlighten<00:00:27.059> them<00:00:27.529> if<00:00:28.529> you<00:00:29.130> look<00:00:29.340> at<00:00:29.460> any<00:00:29.700> bridge

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
enlighten them if you look at any bridge

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.650 
enlighten them if you look at any bridge
port<00:00:30.360> you<00:00:30.509> will<00:00:30.599> see<00:00:30.899> these<00:00:31.079> fittings<00:00:31.680> that

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:32.660 
port you will see these fittings that

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:41.419 
port you will see these fittings that
are<00:00:33.660> on<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.170> front<00:00:34.500> and<00:00:35.540> the<00:00:36.540> side<00:00:40.100> and<00:00:41.100> also

00:00:41.419 --> 00:00:41.429 
are on the front and the side and also

00:00:41.429 --> 00:00:49.310 
are on the front and the side and also
on<00:00:44.690> the<00:00:45.690> knee<00:00:46.460> so<00:00:47.460> all<00:00:47.699> in<00:00:47.850> all<00:00:47.969> you<00:00:48.030> have<00:00:48.420> two

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
on the knee so all in all you have two

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.369 
on the knee so all in all you have two
fittings<00:00:49.679> on<00:00:49.859> the<00:00:49.890> knee<00:00:50.960> two<00:00:51.960> fittings

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
fittings on the knee two fittings

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.299 
fittings on the knee two fittings
underneath<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.489> table<00:00:54.210> and<00:00:54.589> two<00:00:55.589> fittings<00:00:56.039> in

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
underneath the table and two fittings in

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.970 
underneath the table and two fittings in
the<00:00:57.089> front<00:00:57.359> of<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.510> table<00:00:57.870> now<00:00:58.409> a<00:00:58.440> lot<00:00:58.829> of

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
the front of the table now a lot of

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.169 
the front of the table now a lot of
people<00:00:59.249> think<00:00:59.489> that<00:00:59.640> these<00:00:59.760> are<00:00:59.819> grease

00:01:00.169 --> 00:01:00.179 
people think that these are grease

00:01:00.179 --> 00:01:01.819 
people think that these are grease
fittings<00:01:00.569> but<00:01:00.749> they<00:01:00.899> aren't<00:01:01.199> what<00:01:01.710> they

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
fittings but they aren't what they

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.759 
fittings but they aren't what they
actually<00:01:02.039> are<00:01:02.339> as<00:01:02.609> oil<00:01:02.969> fittings<00:01:03.479> and<00:01:03.769> they're

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
actually are as oil fittings and they're

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.710 
actually are as oil fittings and they're
designed<00:01:05.010> to<00:01:05.400> lubricate<00:01:05.940> the<00:01:06.120> ways<00:01:06.330> of<00:01:06.570> the

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
designed to lubricate the ways of the

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.360 
designed to lubricate the ways of the
machine<00:01:07.080> now<00:01:07.440> where<00:01:07.620> a<00:01:07.650> lot<00:01:07.830> of<00:01:07.860> people<00:01:08.040> make

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:08.370 
machine now where a lot of people make

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:09.770 
machine now where a lot of people make
their<00:01:08.550> mistake<00:01:08.580> is<00:01:09.060> they'll<00:01:09.210> take<00:01:09.420> a<00:01:09.450> grease

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
their mistake is they'll take a grease

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.290 
their mistake is they'll take a grease
gun<00:01:09.810> and<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:11.070> grease<00:01:11.280> gun<00:01:11.460> will<00:01:11.670> fit<00:01:11.970> on<00:01:12.090> these

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:12.300 
gun and the grease gun will fit on these

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.540 
gun and the grease gun will fit on these
fittings<00:01:12.720> and<00:01:13.020> they'll<00:01:13.920> pump<00:01:14.190> it<00:01:14.340> full<00:01:14.490> of

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:14.550 
fittings and they'll pump it full of

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:16.700 
fittings and they'll pump it full of
grease<00:01:14.850> thinking<00:01:15.540> that<00:01:15.690> they're<00:01:15.930> lubricating

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
grease thinking that they're lubricating

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.350 
grease thinking that they're lubricating
or<00:01:16.830> greasing<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.250> table<00:01:17.700> and<00:01:17.880> that's<00:01:18.240> the

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
or greasing the table and that's the

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.400 
or greasing the table and that's the
last<00:01:18.540> thing<00:01:18.750> you<00:01:18.900> want<00:01:19.080> to<00:01:19.110> do<00:01:19.260> to<00:01:19.380> a

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:19.410 
last thing you want to do to a

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:22.190 
last thing you want to do to a
Bridgeport<00:01:20.070> that's<00:01:20.520> a<00:01:20.640> fastest<00:01:21.150> way<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:21.870> ruin

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
Bridgeport that's a fastest way to ruin

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.470 
Bridgeport that's a fastest way to ruin
your<00:01:22.380> your<00:01:22.890> machine<00:01:23.280> because<00:01:23.820> what<00:01:24.120> happens

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:24.480 
your your machine because what happens

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.500 
your your machine because what happens
is<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.810> grease<00:01:25.140> will<00:01:25.950> attract<00:01:26.400> and<00:01:26.670> hold<00:01:27.090> and

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:27.510 
is the grease will attract and hold and

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:31.070 
is the grease will attract and hold and
trap<00:01:27.960> any<00:01:28.430> filings<00:01:29.430> or<00:01:29.640> soif<00:01:30.000> and<00:01:30.330> just

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:31.080 
trap any filings or soif and just

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.130 
trap any filings or soif and just
basically<00:01:31.680> grind<00:01:32.370> the<00:01:33.060> ways<00:01:33.270> of<00:01:33.510> the<00:01:33.690> of<00:01:33.990> the

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
basically grind the ways of the of the

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.760 
basically grind the ways of the of the
Machine<00:01:34.500> until<00:01:35.460> they're<00:01:35.700> pretty<00:01:36.120> well<00:01:36.270> shot

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
Machine until they're pretty well shot

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.240 
Machine until they're pretty well shot
what<00:01:37.770> you<00:01:37.890> need<00:01:38.160> is<00:01:38.400> a<00:01:38.430> specialized<00:01:39.240> gun<00:01:40.250> that
