00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
lavenia the cancer moon does create that

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.359 
lavenia the cancer moon does create that
that<00:00:27.330> sense<00:00:27.720> of<00:00:27.900> fear<00:00:28.320> or<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.650> caution<00:00:29.250> about

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
that sense of fear or the caution about

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.759 
that sense of fear or the caution about
moving<00:00:29.910> forward<00:00:30.230> but<00:00:31.230> I<00:00:31.289> don't<00:00:31.500> think<00:00:31.650> we're

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
moving forward but I don't think we're

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.200 
moving forward but I don't think we're
going<00:00:31.859> to<00:00:31.949> be<00:00:32.070> able<00:00:32.160> to<00:00:32.399> help<00:00:32.520> ourselves<00:00:32.790> I

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
going to be able to help ourselves I

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.090 
going to be able to help ourselves I
think<00:00:33.239> we<00:00:33.510> move<00:00:33.719> forward<00:00:34.020> today<00:00:34.320> even<00:00:34.680> if<00:00:34.920> it's

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
think we move forward today even if it's

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.760 
think we move forward today even if it's
awkwardly<00:00:35.610> well<00:00:36.360> yeah<00:00:36.630> that<00:00:36.870> moon<00:00:37.170> in<00:00:37.469> cancer

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
awkwardly well yeah that moon in cancer

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.760 
awkwardly well yeah that moon in cancer
opposes<00:00:38.610> aggressive<00:00:39.180> Mars<00:00:39.510> and<00:00:39.899> potent<00:00:40.260> Pluto

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
opposes aggressive Mars and potent Pluto

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.280 
opposes aggressive Mars and potent Pluto
today<00:00:41.160> that<00:00:41.850> can<00:00:42.149> certainly<00:00:42.360> evoke<00:00:42.899> power

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
today that can certainly evoke power

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.799 
today that can certainly evoke power
struggles<00:00:44.040> and<00:00:44.280> yet<00:00:45.059> I<00:00:45.239> think<00:00:45.570> it's<00:00:45.750> more

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
struggles and yet I think it's more

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.770 
struggles and yet I think it's more
important<00:00:46.500> to<00:00:46.590> engage<00:00:46.860> our<00:00:47.640> desires<00:00:48.239> and<00:00:48.390> act

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
important to engage our desires and act

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.290 
important to engage our desires and act
on<00:00:49.110> them<00:00:49.350> with<00:00:49.559> some<00:00:49.860> cool<00:00:50.190> clarity<00:00:50.879> if<00:00:50.969> we<00:00:51.120> can

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
on them with some cool clarity if we can

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.540 
on them with some cool clarity if we can
find<00:00:51.570> it<00:00:51.840> then<00:00:52.410> to<00:00:52.680> just<00:00:52.920> move<00:00:53.129> into<00:00:53.399> a

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
find it then to just move into a

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.700 
find it then to just move into a
defensive<00:00:54.090> position<00:00:54.239> yeah<00:00:54.750> I<00:00:54.809> agree<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:55.530> I

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
defensive position yeah I agree and I

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.040 
defensive position yeah I agree and I
think<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:56.070> awkwardness<00:00:56.610> though<00:00:57.360> comes<00:00:57.750> from

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
think the awkwardness though comes from

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.340 
think the awkwardness though comes from
Venus<00:00:58.590> and<00:00:58.770> Mars<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.219> cosmic<00:00:59.699> lovers<00:01:00.090> are

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 
Venus and Mars the cosmic lovers are

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.139 
Venus and Mars the cosmic lovers are
kind<00:01:01.350> of<00:01:01.410> close<00:01:01.649> to<00:01:01.980> sex<00:01:02.250> tiling<00:01:02.760> each<00:01:02.879> other

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
kind of close to sex tiling each other

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.980 
kind of close to sex tiling each other
this<00:01:03.570> is<00:01:03.750> a<00:01:03.780> simple<00:01:05.060> textile<00:01:06.060> covers<00:01:06.600> I<00:01:06.750> like

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
this is a simple textile covers I like

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.410 
this is a simple textile covers I like
it<00:01:07.170> no<00:01:07.650> but<00:01:07.950> but<00:01:08.310> there's<00:01:08.640> a<00:01:08.700> support<00:01:09.270> of

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
it no but but there's a support of

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.359 
it no but but there's a support of
energy<00:01:09.840> that<00:01:10.049> they<00:01:10.380> have<00:01:10.710> and<00:01:11.010> so<00:01:11.189> they're

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
energy that they have and so they're

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.060 
energy that they have and so they're
working<00:01:11.909> with<00:01:12.090> one<00:01:12.330> another<00:01:12.570> however<00:01:13.470> their
