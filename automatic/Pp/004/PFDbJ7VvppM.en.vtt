00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
go bang the first time that thing was

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.560

absolutely<00:01:15.659> caked<00:01:16.170> in<00:01:16.290> mud<00:01:16.350> after<00:01:17.250> Larry

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
absolutely caked in mud after Larry

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.730 
absolutely caked in mud after Larry
cleaned<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.630> gun<00:01:18.810> off<00:01:18.930> pretty<00:01:19.200> good<00:01:19.290> picked

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:22.440 
it up drop it down low shot great so I

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:23.930

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:46.230 
out today we're gonna drag the rifle

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:48.380 
out today we're gonna drag the rifle
behind<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:46.650> truck<00:01:46.920> bombs<00:01:47.220> away<00:01:47.430> I<00:01:47.820> predicted

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
behind the truck bombs away I predicted

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.670 
behind the truck bombs away I predicted
that<00:01:48.450> we<00:01:48.660> were<00:01:48.750> gonna<00:01:48.870> have<00:01:49.050> some<00:01:49.200> cosmetic

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
that we were gonna have some cosmetic

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.110 
that we were gonna have some cosmetic
and<00:01:49.830> surface<00:01:50.160> damage<00:01:50.370> but<00:01:50.730> nothing<00:01:51.090> that

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:51.120 
and surface damage but nothing that

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.120 
and surface damage but nothing that
would<00:01:51.330> prohibit<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:52.050> gun<00:01:52.230> from<00:01:52.440> functioning

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
would prohibit the gun from functioning

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.750 
would prohibit the gun from functioning
properly

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:53.760 
properly

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.700 
properly
I<00:01:53.790> was<00:01:54.300> kind<00:01:54.480> of<00:01:54.510> surprised<00:01:54.870> at<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.410> amount<00:01:55.500> of

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
I was kind of surprised at the amount of

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.320 
I was kind of surprised at the amount of
grit<00:01:56.040> that<00:01:56.220> got<00:01:56.400> into<00:01:56.760> the<00:01:56.820> action<00:01:57.000> of<00:01:57.240> the

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.330 
grit that got into the action of the

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.010 
grit that got into the action of the
weapon<00:01:59.090> basically<00:02:00.090> fired<00:02:00.330> one<00:02:00.570> shot<00:02:00.600> and

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
weapon basically fired one shot and

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.810 
weapon basically fired one shot and
there's<00:02:01.140> so<00:02:01.350> much<00:02:01.530> Grint<00:02:01.950> back<00:02:02.190> in<00:02:02.370> the<00:02:02.430> action

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
there's so much Grint back in the action

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.550 
there's so much Grint back in the action
that<00:02:02.970> got<00:02:03.090> pounded<00:02:03.510> into<00:02:03.690> it<00:02:03.900> from<00:02:03.990> Dragon

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
that got pounded into it from Dragon

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.920 
that got pounded into it from Dragon
it's<00:02:05.010> binding<00:02:05.370> up<00:02:05.670> I<00:02:05.910> think<00:02:06.480> once<00:02:06.660> Larry

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
it's binding up I think once Larry

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.780 
it's binding up I think once Larry
breaks<00:02:07.320> down<00:02:07.470> the<00:02:07.620> gun<00:02:07.800> we<00:02:08.190> clean<00:02:08.490> it<00:02:08.520> we

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:08.790 
breaks down the gun we clean it we

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:10.040 
breaks down the gun we clean it we
lubricate<00:02:08.970> it<00:02:09.330> again<00:02:09.510> the<00:02:09.600> guns<00:02:09.780> gonna<00:02:09.930> work

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
lubricate it again the guns gonna work

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.230 
lubricate it again the guns gonna work
fine<00:02:10.440> the<00:02:11.130> next<00:02:11.400> thing<00:02:11.550> coming<00:02:11.820> up<00:02:11.880> we're

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
fine the next thing coming up we're

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:13.850 
fine the next thing coming up we're
gonna<00:02:12.330> freeze<00:02:12.630> the<00:02:12.840> gun<00:02:13.020> my<00:02:13.350> guess<00:02:13.590> is<00:02:13.770> that

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
gonna freeze the gun my guess is that

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.110 
gonna freeze the gun my guess is that
we'll<00:02:13.950> come<00:02:14.160> through<00:02:14.190> that<00:02:14.550> the<00:02:14.820> flying

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
we'll come through that the flying

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:21.320 
we'll come through that the flying

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
colors bro shut essentially once the gun

called<00:02:21.660> out<00:02:21.810> just<00:02:22.140> enough<00:02:22.500> to<00:02:22.620> get<00:02:22.740> it

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
called out just enough to get it

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.790 
called out just enough to get it
operational<00:02:23.840> worked<00:02:24.840> like<00:02:24.960> a<00:02:25.020> champ<00:02:25.290> I

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
operational worked like a champ I

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.040 
operational worked like a champ I
learned<00:02:26.640> last<00:02:27.030> year<00:02:27.270> -<00:02:27.630> never<00:02:27.840> underestimate

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
now what I did underestimate was just

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
came through it far beyond what I
