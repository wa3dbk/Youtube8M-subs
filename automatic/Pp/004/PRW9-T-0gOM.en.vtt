00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
than the AUG but the good thing about

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.290

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.580 
lot in mid in close range and even keep
far<00:01:44.039> because<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:44.969> clip<00:01:45.479> won't<00:01:45.780> go<00:01:45.990> out<00:01:46.020> really

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
far because the clip won't go out really

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.039 
far because the clip won't go out really
fast<00:01:46.770> as<00:01:47.039> an<00:01:47.159> m16<00:01:47.820> is<00:01:47.939> clip<00:01:48.240> I<00:01:48.479> have<00:01:48.719> a<00:01:48.750> clip<00:01:49.020> in

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
fast as an m16 is clip I have a clip in

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.050 
fast as an m16 is clip I have a clip in
there<00:01:49.320> that<00:01:49.530> you<00:01:49.679> will<00:01:49.890> see<00:01:50.070> it's<00:01:50.310> great<00:01:50.820> for

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
there that you will see it's great for

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.609 
there that you will see it's great for
double<00:01:51.390> kills<00:01:51.570> and<00:01:51.750> triple<00:01:52.049> kills<00:01:52.259> because

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
double kills and triple kills because

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.469 
double kills and triple kills because
they're<00:01:52.950> having<00:01:53.280> lower<00:01:53.490> p.m.<00:01:53.880> it's<00:01:54.119> really

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
they're having lower p.m. it's really

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.109 
they're having lower p.m. it's really
good<00:01:54.689> for<00:01:55.109> taking<00:01:55.530> a<00:01:55.619> lot<00:01:55.829> of<00:01:55.859> people<00:01:56.159> if<00:01:56.490> they

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
good for taking a lot of people if they

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.330 
good for taking a lot of people if they
are<00:01:57.179> not<00:01:57.390> aware<00:01:57.689> of<00:01:57.750> your<00:01:58.020> existence<00:01:58.590> taking<00:01:59.250> a

that<00:02:01.320> you're<00:02:01.710> there<00:02:01.740> I<00:02:02.249> would<00:02:02.729> like<00:02:02.939> to<00:02:02.969> see

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
that you're there I would like to see

the holographic sight on it though in

the holographic sight on it though in
order<00:02:05.460> to<00:02:05.520> take<00:02:05.789> those<00:02:06.030> long<00:02:06.299> rates<00:02:06.539> can<00:02:06.810> sell

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
order to take those long rates can sell

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.960 
order to take those long rates can sell
me<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.200> easier<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.799> AUG<00:02:08.160> doesn't<00:02:08.580> have<00:02:08.759> that

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
me the easier the AUG doesn't have that

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.450 
me the easier the AUG doesn't have that
high<00:02:09.450> vertical<00:02:09.899> rico<00:02:10.410> so<00:02:10.710> it's<00:02:10.890> really<00:02:11.100> used

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:11.460 
high vertical rico so it's really used

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.190 
high vertical rico so it's really used
to<00:02:11.550> burst<00:02:11.820> and<00:02:12.030> long<00:02:12.180> rates<00:02:12.390> as<00:02:12.630> you<00:02:12.780> will<00:02:12.990> say

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
to burst and long rates as you will say

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.070 
to burst and long rates as you will say
i<00:02:13.440> took<00:02:13.980> out<00:02:14.129> a<00:02:14.220> couple<00:02:14.700> of<00:02:14.909> snipers<00:02:15.450> while

pretty fat and you can't see you're

targeting long range but if you know how

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.320 
targeting long range but if you know how
to<00:02:25.709> burst<00:02:26.160> you<00:02:26.310> can<00:02:26.459> take<00:02:26.640> out<00:02:26.760> your<00:02:26.879> target

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330

be<00:02:38.069> really<00:02:38.459> nitrate<00:02:38.970> so<00:02:39.360> you<00:02:39.420> gotta<00:02:39.720> use<00:02:39.989> it<00:02:40.140> in

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
it it does a personal preference there

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.830 
it it does a personal preference there
about<00:02:55.860> the<00:02:56.010> secondary<00:02:56.489> now<00:02:56.670> the<00:02:56.730> 44<00:02:57.390> Magnum<00:02:57.420> is

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
about the secondary now the 44 Magnum is

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.509 
about the secondary now the 44 Magnum is
a<00:02:57.930> pretty<00:02:58.140> good<00:02:58.440> choice<00:02:58.680> I<00:02:58.920> used<00:02:59.190> to<00:02:59.250> hate<00:02:59.459> it

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
a pretty good choice I used to hate it

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:02.180 
a pretty good choice I used to hate it
because<00:03:00.030> it<00:03:00.390> should<00:03:00.660> slow<00:03:01.019> it<00:03:01.290> recalls<00:03:01.860> a<00:03:02.010> lot

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
because it should slow it recalls a lot

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:03.860 
because it should slow it recalls a lot
it<00:03:02.370> can<00:03:02.579> carry<00:03:02.819> a<00:03:02.970> lot<00:03:03.150> of<00:03:03.180> bullet<00:03:03.540> can<00:03:03.720> only

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
it can carry a lot of bullet can only

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.140 
it can carry a lot of bullet can only
carry<00:03:04.049> six<00:03:04.410> bullets<00:03:04.829> and<00:03:05.069> the<00:03:05.519> reload<00:03:05.819> time<00:03:05.849> is

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
carry six bullets and the reload time is

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.509 
carry six bullets and the reload time is
pretty<00:03:06.420> redonkulous<00:03:07.019> but<00:03:07.709> after<00:03:07.890> i<00:03:08.069> started

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
pretty redonkulous but after i started

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:10.430 
pretty redonkulous but after i started
using<00:03:08.730> a<00:03:08.910> controller<00:03:09.299> with<00:03:09.630> trigger<00:03:09.959> stops<00:03:10.290> I

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
using a controller with trigger stops I

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.170 
using a controller with trigger stops I
need<00:03:10.590> to<00:03:10.680> literally<00:03:11.010> change<00:03:11.160> my<00:03:11.940> opinion

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
need to literally change my opinion

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.240 
need to literally change my opinion
about<00:03:12.450> the<00:03:12.720> 44<00:03:13.019> Magnum<00:03:13.170> now<00:03:13.709> we<00:03:13.769> can<00:03:14.069> actually

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
about the 44 Magnum now we can actually

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.339 
about the 44 Magnum now we can actually
kill<00:03:14.700> people<00:03:15.000> pretty<00:03:15.180> easily<00:03:15.329> I<00:03:15.690> can<00:03:16.140> finish

00:03:16.339 --> 00:03:16.349 
kill people pretty easily I can finish

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:18.380 
kill people pretty easily I can finish
off<00:03:16.620> my<00:03:16.769> target<00:03:17.190> and<00:03:17.340> kill<00:03:17.519> another<00:03:17.849> target
