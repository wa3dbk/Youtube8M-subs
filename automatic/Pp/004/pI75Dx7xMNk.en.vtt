00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.609
 hello everyone again you are credited 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:08.730
 today we will disassemble the remainder and branches 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:12.300
 riffles of the USSR, that is, this side 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:14.490
 branch to su-152 tarot well and let's begin 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.420
 the very first cars and after that all 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:20.850
 let's sum up all branches in the USSR 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.740
 this is a very unusual car 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.750
 ambiguous because as you see 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.760
 body armor 6 millimeters in any 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.189
 place spills on any landmine and 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.679
 it needs to be played very carefully but 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:35.070
 nonetheless we have a pretty powerful 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:37.260
 top engine in 3 became chic to withdraw 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.800
 horses and the mass we have only some 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.989
 pathetic 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.170
 three tons with a little machine 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.600
 flies just it turns out that we have more 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.899
 20 horses per ton is much even 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.940
 probably more than 30 scooter people in 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.360
 general machines just space ride 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.079
 quickly 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.760
 45 max speed is a weapon 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:59.160
 57mm punches 160 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.530
 millimeters of armor and causes 142 in 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:05.180
 average damage she shoots very very 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:07.770
 often mediocre reduced but general 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.869
 compensated for its low damage high 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.670
 rate of fire and implement it in 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.260
 the principle is quite difficult because 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.840
 you install clips it is not very much 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.090
 but there is no armor like car 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.580
 hard to play it is possible and even fun 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.820
 but for beginners, I do not recommend pumping 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.970
 In general, here is this branch, we go further a 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.830
 185 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.470
 well this car is an improvement 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.960
 previous here installed 80 5 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.490
 millimeter cannon 203 and 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.619
 300 damage 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.439
 also rate of fire is very good 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.260
 level of guidance is mediocre good 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.840
 final 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:43.260
 cars still remains very fast 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.850
 seven and a half tons weighs 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:48.430
 240 horses that is all the same machine 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.560
 very very fast straight 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.990
 rapid more than 30 horses per ton 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.480
 45 again the maximum speed and already have armor 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:58.570
 which you just do not just take 45 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:01.660
 millimeters burst 15 7 we forces 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:04.330
 us to think where to call and so go on 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:06.670
 sous-100 r this is a car on which I 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:09.820
 I would stop in more detail 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:13.450
 interesting unit big so all 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:17.250
 such cardboard scold us 55 LOV 15 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:20.200
 10h board and feed in general niskolechki 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:24.460
 top speed 57 kilometers per hour 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:26.590
 weight 11 tons and engine power 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:28.660
 four hundred and eighty horses that is 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:33.190
 there are 40 horses per ton 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:34.690
 and she just rides max speed 57 together 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.570
 with bipods ride 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:40.209
 with pluses they are a very good gun 227 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:41.980
 a breakdown of 530 medium damage is excellent 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:44.050
 temporal rate of fire 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.910
 normal this time and pretty 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:48.550
 good accuracy as a result of the machine 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:51.090
 just the ultimate super st 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:55.780
 but without a tower unfortunately there is no tower 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:57.970
 strength by the way 2900 is also pretty good 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.010
 cool pt not recommend it to everyone 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.170
 go but beginners again say 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.720
 This line is not very good start with 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.790
 anything else 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:10.000
 su-152 and this is basically the same with y 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:12.880
 It costs only a little bit heavier and has 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:17.800
 150 two millimeter guns here already 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:19.540
 space 1160 breakdown damage 265 good 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.400
 pretty quick rate mediocre 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.920
 such a temporary vision of about two 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.750
 seconds, maybe a little less, and 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:29.170
 the mediocre precision of the gun is cool 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:31.690
 very much though at level 8 9 there is already a weapon 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:33.780
 terrible why not really there tiger n t 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:36.410
 but the main thing is that Randy 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:39.360
 balancing on the verge of power and accuracy 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:41.250
 gives great results car 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.970
 again, quickly, I absolutely do not have 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.430
 armor 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:46.680
 Well, in general, what else to say is almost the same 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:50.520
 the very thing that p is just a gun here much 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:53.430
 steeper well su-152 ram is a crown 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:55.800
 this branch is one such difference 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:58.709
 which no one is more in this 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:00.510
 in these branches of two soviet this tower 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:04.020
 maybe she and unarmored 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:07.519
 again 70 millimeters forehead case 65 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:09.930
 forehead of the tower but the tower is plus the guns 152 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:14.459
 millimeter with a cosmic break in 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:16.650
 290 one-hundredth 1160 average damage 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:18.320
 rather mediocre time 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:20.850
 guidance for quite a while 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:23.280
 rate of fire is quite good and 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:25.020
 accuracy is also not very good but for 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.570
 such indicators tools for such 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:30.270
 caliber quite acceptable acceptable shooting 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:32.570
 we quite often and very painfully well 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:35.250
 plus we fly higher hit like mad 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:37.800
 25 tons where you will be mass 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:40.890
 and four hundred eighty horses power 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:43.650
 almost 20 per ton is like so good 

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:45.750
 st as t-54 and t-55 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:47.250
 Well, we have a weapon, of course, not like 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:49.890
 better than these costs 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:52.169
 that tower there can be armor have I not 

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:54.000
 so good, but what do we do 

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:55.979
 should pay something for our 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.770
 great machine guns very 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:05:00.600
 interesting and very nice but again 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:03.390
 how many times have I repeated this but 

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:06.840
 I still do not recommend this thread 

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:07.979
 pumping to beginners and so what is the result for 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:10.350
 all these cars 

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:13.020
 except for all these cars probably 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:15.419
 only st have great weapons 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:18.870
 although west and they are pretty good too 

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:21.000
 There is something to compare and the damage is great 

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:23.760
 and break through the normal pro pshki I 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.370
 generally keep quiet there just up-penny figures 

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:29.669
 I recommend to pump in the village at the beginning 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:32.070
 branch to 268 objects and in general all 

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:35.090
 these branches for beginners can download well except 

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:37.220
 unless branches to 152 taro she to us 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:39.740
 enough words not all the rest 

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:40.669
 contains great cars 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:44.090
 on their levels 

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:45.889
 who are capable of throwing fights capable 

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:47.870
 straight pull them out so deep 

00:05:45.889 --> 00:05:48.530
 dad from whom the others just was no longer 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:50.690
 could 

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:53.750
 Well, in general delivery, what can I say grandfathers 

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:57.050
 fought well in general thats all we 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:06:00.260
 dismantled the entire branch of the USSR more precisely as the whole 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:02.720
 branch all tree branches of the ussr and turn 

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:04.639
 to the next germany or us decide 

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:06.860
 write yourself in a comment about what you 

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:11.500
 want to hear next time well with 

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:11.500
 see you all, see you soon
