shuffle<00:00:10.950> strumming<00:00:11.490> now<00:00:12.090> this<00:00:12.270> type<00:00:12.540> of

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
shuffle strumming now this type of

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.869 
shuffle strumming now this type of
strumming<00:00:13.139> is<00:00:13.260> really<00:00:13.799> really<00:00:14.250> common<00:00:14.549> on<00:00:14.760> the

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:14.879 
strumming is really really common on the

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:16.369 
strumming is really really common on the
ukulele<00:00:15.180> so<00:00:15.600> it's<00:00:15.719> definitely<00:00:16.170> something

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
ukulele so it's definitely something

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:17.420 
ukulele so it's definitely something
that<00:00:16.500> you<00:00:16.650> need<00:00:16.890> to<00:00:17.010> do<00:00:17.100> a<00:00:17.130> bit<00:00:17.310> of<00:00:17.340> practice

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
that you need to do a bit of practice

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.160 
that you need to do a bit of practice
with<00:00:17.789> and<00:00:18.180> we're<00:00:18.660> going<00:00:18.780> to<00:00:18.840> be<00:00:18.930> doing<00:00:19.110> a

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
with and we're going to be doing a

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:20.690 
with and we're going to be doing a
little<00:00:19.289> bit<00:00:19.470> of<00:00:19.500> a<00:00:19.619> play<00:00:19.890> along<00:00:20.220> now<00:00:20.400> so<00:00:20.640> you

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:20.700 
little bit of a play along now so you

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.820 
little bit of a play along now so you
can<00:00:20.970> get<00:00:21.090> used<00:00:21.270> to<00:00:21.360> the<00:00:21.510> feel<00:00:21.750> of<00:00:21.780> it<00:00:21.990> so<00:00:22.230> what

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
can get used to the feel of it so what

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.490 
can get used to the feel of it so what
is<00:00:22.980> a<00:00:23.010> shuffle<00:00:23.520> so<00:00:24.090> normally<00:00:24.930> in<00:00:25.020> music<00:00:25.350> when

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
is a shuffle so normally in music when

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.380 
is a shuffle so normally in music when
you<00:00:25.590> have<00:00:25.710> like<00:00:25.920> a<00:00:25.950> one<00:00:26.040> and<00:00:26.640> two<00:00:27.060> and<00:00:27.360> three

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
you have like a one and two and three

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.230 
you have like a one and two and three
and<00:00:28.110> four<00:00:28.170> and<00:00:28.890> it<00:00:29.190> would<00:00:29.550> be<00:00:29.700> played<00:00:29.970> very

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
and four and it would be played very

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.869 
and four and it would be played very
evenly<00:00:30.870> okay<00:00:31.620> like<00:00:31.860> mathematically<00:00:32.759> as

00:00:32.869 --> 00:00:32.879 
evenly okay like mathematically as

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:34.639 
evenly okay like mathematically as
perfectly<00:00:33.329> as<00:00:33.450> you<00:00:33.480> could<00:00:33.780> you'll<00:00:34.230> be<00:00:34.410> doing

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
perfectly as you could you'll be doing

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:45.799 
perfectly as you could you'll be doing
something<00:00:34.980> like<00:00:44.480> normally<00:00:45.480> it<00:00:45.570> would<00:00:45.690> be<00:00:45.719> a

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
something like normally it would be a

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.869 
something like normally it would be a
Down<00:00:46.140> strum<00:00:46.530> on<00:00:46.679> the<00:00:46.800> beat<00:00:46.980> okay<00:00:47.670> on<00:00:47.760> the<00:00:47.850> one

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
Down strum on the beat okay on the one

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.729 
Down strum on the beat okay on the one
two<00:00:48.210> three<00:00:48.239> in<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.570> four<00:00:48.780> and<00:00:48.929> an<00:00:48.989> up<00:00:49.230> strum<00:00:49.559> on

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
two three in the four and an up strum on

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:57.200 
two three in the four and an up strum on
the<00:00:50.219> end<00:00:50.429> so<00:00:54.920> okay<00:00:55.920> now<00:00:56.429> that<00:00:56.640> should<00:00:57.089> be

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
the end so okay now that should be

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.430 
the end so okay now that should be
something<00:00:57.420> that<00:00:57.629> you're<00:00:57.749> working<00:00:57.899> on<00:00:58.170> already

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
something that you're working on already

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.799 
something that you're working on already
but<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:59.309> shuffle<00:00:59.729> is<00:00:59.819> but<00:01:00.149> particularly

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
but the shuffle is but particularly

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.840 
but the shuffle is but particularly
common<00:01:01.109> on<00:01:01.409> the<00:01:01.829> ukulele<00:01:02.159> we<00:01:02.519> use<00:01:02.639> it<00:01:02.789> on

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
common on the ukulele we use it on

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.399 
common on the ukulele we use it on
guitar<00:01:03.149> as<00:01:03.269> well<00:01:03.329> in<00:01:03.510> fact<00:01:03.569> all<00:01:03.929> music<00:01:04.320> is

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
guitar as well in fact all music is

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.200 
guitar as well in fact all music is
particularly<00:01:04.890> blues<00:01:05.250> use<00:01:05.489> a<00:01:05.519> lot<00:01:05.729> of<00:01:05.760> shuffle

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
particularly blues use a lot of shuffle

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.120 
particularly blues use a lot of shuffle
stuff<00:01:06.420> but<00:01:07.050> on<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.350> ukulele<00:01:07.620> there's

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
stuff but on the ukulele there's

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.370 
stuff but on the ukulele there's
something<00:01:08.400> about<00:01:08.640> that<00:01:08.939> kind<00:01:09.210> of<00:01:09.360> it's<00:01:10.170> got<00:01:10.320> a

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
something about that kind of it's got a

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.870 
something about that kind of it's got a
little<00:01:10.619> bit<00:01:10.740> of<00:01:10.829> a<00:01:10.920> groove<00:01:11.130> to<00:01:11.430> it<00:01:11.549> sounds

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
little bit of a groove to it sounds

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.340 
little bit of a groove to it sounds
great<00:01:12.060> on<00:01:12.119> you<00:01:12.450> so<00:01:12.990> what<00:01:13.170> we're<00:01:13.320> basically

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
great on you so what we're basically

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.789 
great on you so what we're basically
doing<00:01:14.100> is<00:01:14.369> delaying<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.689> upstroke<00:01:16.439> a<00:01:16.590> little

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
doing is delaying the upstroke a little

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.730 
doing is delaying the upstroke a little
bit<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.070> end<00:01:17.310> so<00:01:18.030> instead<00:01:18.270> of<00:01:18.329> going<00:01:18.600> one<00:01:19.259> and

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
bit the end so instead of going one and

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.149 
bit the end so instead of going one and
two<00:01:20.100> and<00:01:20.430> three<00:01:20.490> and<00:01:21.299> four<00:01:21.899> and<00:01:22.170> we<00:01:22.439> go<00:01:22.590> one<00:01:22.829> and

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
two and three and four and we go one and

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.510 
two and three and four and we go one and
two

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
two

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:33.899 
two
and<00:01:25.150> my<00:01:31.649> flat<00:01:32.649> on<00:01:32.890> the<00:01:33.009> ferry<00:01:33.250> different

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:33.909 
and my flat on the ferry different

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:37.200 
and my flat on the ferry different
strike

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:37.210 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:42.500 

now<00:01:38.050> the<00:01:38.110> shelf<00:01:38.500> again

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:42.510 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:45.000 

now<00:01:43.510> actually<00:01:44.200> if<00:01:44.290> we<00:01:44.380> want<00:01:44.590> to<00:01:44.620> look<00:01:44.800> at<00:01:44.890> it

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.010 
now actually if we want to look at it

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:47.070 
now actually if we want to look at it
kind<00:01:45.190> of<00:01:45.250> mathematically<00:01:46.030> we<00:01:46.480> would<00:01:46.660> divide

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:47.080 
kind of mathematically we would divide

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.470 
kind of mathematically we would divide
edged<00:01:47.350> feet<00:01:47.680> into<00:01:48.130> three<00:01:48.580> commonly<00:01:49.240> called

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:49.480 
edged feet into three commonly called

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.120 
edged feet into three commonly called
triplets<00:01:49.960> in<00:01:50.140> music<00:01:50.440> and<00:01:50.590> we'd<00:01:50.980> be<00:01:51.100> playing

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
triplets in music and we'd be playing

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.030 
triplets in music and we'd be playing
the<00:01:51.550> first<00:01:51.880> one<00:01:52.180> and<00:01:52.390> the<00:01:52.570> last<00:01:52.600> one<00:01:53.260> so<00:01:53.800> if<00:01:53.860> we

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:54.040 
the first one and the last one so if we

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.500 
the first one and the last one so if we
were<00:01:54.190> counting<00:01:54.610> this<00:01:54.790> we'd<00:01:54.970> normally<00:01:55.120> count

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:55.510 
were counting this we'd normally count

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:57.840 
were counting this we'd normally count
one<00:01:55.810> triplet<00:01:56.170> two<00:01:56.500> triplet<00:01:56.800> three<00:01:57.460> triplet

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
one triplet two triplet three triplet

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.720 
one triplet two triplet three triplet
four<00:01:58.480> triplet<00:01:58.870> that<00:01:59.830> would<00:02:00.010> be<00:02:00.100> the<00:02:00.220> count<00:02:00.460> for

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:00.730 
four triplet that would be the count for

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:02.880 
four triplet that would be the count for
it<00:02:00.820> so<00:02:01.300> it'd<00:02:01.450> be<00:02:01.480> strumming<00:02:01.930> the<00:02:02.200> down<00:02:02.500> on<00:02:02.770> the

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
it so it'd be strumming the down on the

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.670 
it so it'd be strumming the down on the
beat<00:02:03.070> and<00:02:03.280> the<00:02:04.030> upstroke<00:02:04.630> on<00:02:04.810> the<00:02:05.080> left<00:02:05.380> so<00:02:05.590> if

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:05.680 
beat and the upstroke on the left so if

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.100 
beat and the upstroke on the left so if
I<00:02:05.740> don't<00:02:05.920> really<00:02:06.160> slowly<00:02:06.580> we're<00:02:07.270> doing<00:02:07.480> 1

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.110 
I don't really slowly we're doing 1

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.870 
I don't really slowly we're doing 1
triplet<00:02:08.590> 2<00:02:08.979> triplet<00:02:09.399> 3<00:02:10.300> triplet<00:02:10.750> 4<00:02:11.620> triplet<00:02:12.070> 1

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
triplet 2 triplet 3 triplet 4 triplet 1

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:19.290 
triplet 2 triplet 3 triplet 4 triplet 1
triplet<00:02:13.420> 2<00:02:14.230> triplet<00:02:14.650> 3<00:02:15.490> -<00:02:17.700> it's<00:02:18.700> not<00:02:18.850> kind<00:02:19.180> of

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
triplet 2 triplet 3 - it's not kind of

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.180 
triplet 2 triplet 3 - it's not kind of
quite<00:02:19.510> as<00:02:19.630> mathematical<00:02:20.410> as<00:02:20.560> that<00:02:20.709> really<00:02:20.920> in

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
quite as mathematical as that really in

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:22.680 
quite as mathematical as that really in
it<00:02:21.310> when<00:02:21.459> it<00:02:21.580> comes<00:02:21.730> to<00:02:21.880> really<00:02:22.060> making<00:02:22.300> music

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
it when it comes to really making music

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.250 
it when it comes to really making music
out<00:02:22.810> of<00:02:22.840> it<00:02:23.020> it's<00:02:23.380> just<00:02:23.560> got<00:02:23.709> this<00:02:23.890> kind<00:02:24.190> of<00:02:24.400> a

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
out of it it's just got this kind of a

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:36.560 
out of it it's just got this kind of a
little<00:02:26.260> bit<00:02:26.410> more<00:02:26.620> dancing

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.700 

then<00:02:37.570> it<00:02:37.690> would<00:02:37.840> if<00:02:37.960> I<00:02:38.080> played<00:02:38.320> that<00:02:38.470> same

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:38.710 
then it would if I played that same

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:45.780 
then it would if I played that same
thing<00:02:38.980> straight<00:02:44.160> doesn't<00:02:45.160> seem<00:02:45.490> to<00:02:45.610> quite

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
thing straight doesn't seem to quite

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:56.360 
thing straight doesn't seem to quite
have<00:02:46.030> the<00:02:46.060> same<00:02:46.210> roof

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.740 

so<00:02:57.370> to<00:02:57.430> practice<00:02:57.730> it<00:02:58.060> what<00:02:58.390> I<00:02:58.420> would<00:02:58.630> recommend

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
so to practice it what I would recommend

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.510 
so to practice it what I would recommend
you<00:02:59.110> start<00:02:59.500> off<00:02:59.620> with<00:02:59.650> is<00:02:59.950> doing<00:03:00.250> a<00:03:00.340> little

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:00.520 
you start off with is doing a little

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.310 
you start off with is doing a little
count<00:03:00.850> thing<00:03:01.150> so<00:03:01.360> first<00:03:01.870> thing<00:03:02.080> is<00:03:02.200> to

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:02.320 
count thing so first thing is to

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.590 
count thing so first thing is to
practice<00:03:02.740> actually<00:03:02.950> saying<00:03:03.490> out<00:03:03.730> loud<00:03:03.760> one

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600 
practice actually saying out loud one

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.650 
practice actually saying out loud one
triplet<00:03:05.020> two<00:03:05.320> triplet<00:03:05.670> three<00:03:06.670> triplet<00:03:06.700> four

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
triplet two triplet three triplet four

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.590 
triplet two triplet three triplet four
triplet<00:03:07.950> over<00:03:08.950> and<00:03:09.100> over<00:03:09.370> again<00:03:09.490> then<00:03:10.180> start

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 
triplet over and over again then start

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.330 
triplet over and over again then start
just<00:03:10.840> playing<00:03:11.110> along<00:03:11.440> with<00:03:11.470> a<00:03:11.650> down<00:03:11.950> strum<00:03:12.310> on

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
just playing along with a down strum on

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.160 
just playing along with a down strum on
that<00:03:12.640> beat<00:03:12.910> on<00:03:13.060> the<00:03:13.180> count<00:03:13.420> the<00:03:13.600> one<00:03:13.750> two<00:03:13.780> three

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
that beat on the count the one two three

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.350 
that beat on the count the one two three
in<00:03:14.230> the<00:03:14.290> four<00:03:14.470> and<00:03:14.590> the<00:03:14.980> up<00:03:15.160> on<00:03:15.490> the<00:03:15.670> let<00:03:15.880> so<00:03:16.180> go

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360 
in the four and the up on the let so go

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.910 
in the four and the up on the let so go
1<00:03:17.110> triplet<00:03:17.560> 2<00:03:17.950> triplet<00:03:18.370> 3<00:03:19.210> triplet<00:03:19.690> 4<00:03:20.470> triplet

1 triplet 2 triplet 3 triplet 4 triplet
1<00:03:21.670> triplet<00:03:26.640> ok<00:03:27.640> let's<00:03:27.850> have<00:03:27.940> a<00:03:28.000> little<00:03:28.120> play

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
1 triplet ok let's have a little play

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:29.760 
1 triplet ok let's have a little play
along<00:03:28.750> of<00:03:28.930> doing<00:03:29.200> that<00:03:29.320> now<00:03:29.380> because<00:03:29.650> it

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:29.770 
along of doing that now because it

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:31.320 
along of doing that now because it
really<00:03:30.040> is<00:03:30.160> this<00:03:30.310> is<00:03:30.370> how<00:03:30.640> you<00:03:30.700> want<00:03:31.000> to<00:03:31.090> get<00:03:31.210> it

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:31.330 
really is this is how you want to get it

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:33.420 
really is this is how you want to get it
under<00:03:31.540> your<00:03:31.630> fingers<00:03:31.960> properly<00:03:32.350> so<00:03:32.590> or<00:03:32.950> finger

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
under your fingers properly so or finger

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:34.680 
under your fingers properly so or finger
because<00:03:33.700> you're<00:03:33.820> probably<00:03:34.030> strumming<00:03:34.510> just

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
because you're probably strumming just

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:35.850 
because you're probably strumming just
with<00:03:34.840> your<00:03:34.930> first<00:03:35.140> thing<00:03:35.350> here<00:03:35.560> that's<00:03:35.710> what

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:35.860 
with your first thing here that's what

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:38.640 
with your first thing here that's what
I'd<00:03:35.980> be<00:03:36.010> recommending<00:03:36.640> and<00:03:37.140> I'm<00:03:38.140> using<00:03:38.410> a

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
I'd be recommending and I'm using a

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:40.230 
I'd be recommending and I'm using a
little<00:03:39.010> C<00:03:39.250> chord<00:03:39.520> here<00:03:39.730> just<00:03:39.940> because<00:03:40.090> it's

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:40.240 
little C chord here just because it's

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:41.370 
little C chord here just because it's
nice<00:03:40.390> and<00:03:40.630> easy<00:03:40.720> and<00:03:40.900> you<00:03:40.930> don't<00:03:41.110> want<00:03:41.260> to<00:03:41.320> be

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:41.380 
nice and easy and you don't want to be

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:42.630 
nice and easy and you don't want to be
thinking<00:03:41.530> about<00:03:41.710> your<00:03:41.950> chord<00:03:42.220> you<00:03:42.340> just<00:03:42.520> want

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640 
thinking about your chord you just want

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.490 
thinking about your chord you just want
to<00:03:42.700> be<00:03:42.790> thinking<00:03:42.970> about<00:03:43.150> the<00:03:43.420> strumming<00:03:43.810> so<00:03:44.410> if

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
to be thinking about the strumming so if

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.380 
to be thinking about the strumming so if

let<00:04:00.100> to<00:04:00.520> triplet<00:04:01.390> 3<00:04:01.900> triplet<00:04:01.930> 4<00:04:02.710> triplet<00:04:03.480> down

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:20.170 
triplet 3 triplet 4 triplet 1 triplet ok

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:22.770 
triplet 3 triplet 4 triplet 1 triplet ok
so<00:04:20.770> really<00:04:21.310> that's<00:04:21.489> the<00:04:21.670> way<00:04:21.790> to<00:04:21.850> get<00:04:22.270> used<00:04:22.600> to

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:22.780 
so really that's the way to get used to

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:24.690 
so really that's the way to get used to
the<00:04:22.930> idea<00:04:22.960> of<00:04:23.380> having<00:04:23.680> that<00:04:23.860> kind<00:04:23.980> of<00:04:24.280> delayed

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:24.700 
the idea of having that kind of delayed

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.910 
the idea of having that kind of delayed
and<00:04:25.030> if<00:04:25.330> you<00:04:25.420> like<00:04:25.570> the<00:04:25.690> shuffle<00:04:26.110> but<00:04:26.650> really

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:26.920 
and if you like the shuffle but really

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:28.710 
and if you like the shuffle but really
what's<00:04:27.100> important<00:04:27.580> is<00:04:27.670> that<00:04:27.700> it<00:04:27.910> feels<00:04:28.240> good

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 
what's important is that it feels good

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.510 
what's important is that it feels good
so<00:04:29.230> once<00:04:29.440> you've<00:04:29.560> actually<00:04:29.710> got<00:04:29.980> it<00:04:30.100> right<00:04:30.130> the

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
so once you've actually got it right the

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.440 
so once you've actually got it right the
point<00:04:30.700> will<00:04:30.880> be<00:04:31.000> to<00:04:31.060> just<00:04:31.330> plan

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:33.450 
point will be to just plan

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:35.720 
point will be to just plan
so<00:04:34.350> if<00:04:34.410> you<00:04:34.530> get<00:04:34.680> that<00:04:34.890> kind<00:04:35.160> of<00:04:35.250> Skippy

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:35.730 
so if you get that kind of Skippy

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:38.570 
so if you get that kind of Skippy
feeling<00:04:36.180> work<00:04:36.360> random<00:04:36.870> I<00:04:37.440> don't<00:04:38.160> mean<00:04:38.280> to<00:04:38.400> skip
