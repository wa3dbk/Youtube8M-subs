they<00:00:47.219> include<00:00:47.700> and<00:00:48.180> it's<00:00:49.050> also<00:00:49.320> very<00:00:49.710> stiff<00:00:50.370> so

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
they include and it's also very stiff so

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.810 
they include and it's also very stiff so
it's<00:00:51.270> not<00:00:51.449> super<00:00:51.780> you<00:00:52.559> know<00:00:52.710> squishy<00:00:53.460> and

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
it's not super you know squishy and

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.760 
it's not super you know squishy and
huggable<00:00:54.149> well<00:00:54.750> it's<00:00:54.899> still<00:00:55.140> huggable<00:00:55.649> I

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
huggable well it's still huggable I

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.849 
huggable well it's still huggable I
guess<00:00:55.980> but<00:00:56.309> it's<00:00:56.579> not<00:00:56.820> ultra<00:00:57.059> squishy<00:00:57.719> so<00:00:58.559> it

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
guess but it's not ultra squishy so it

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.700 
guess but it's not ultra squishy so it
is<00:00:59.010> more<00:00:59.219> firm<00:00:59.640> I'm<00:01:00.030> it's<00:01:00.539> this<00:01:00.960> packing<00:01:01.530> that

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
is more firm I'm it's this packing that

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.319 
is more firm I'm it's this packing that
they<00:01:01.800> put<00:01:02.039> in<00:01:02.160> it<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.399> stuffing<00:01:02.850> is<00:01:03.030> very

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
they put in it the stuffing is very

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.690 
they put in it the stuffing is very
stiff<00:01:03.780> so<00:01:04.559> some<00:01:04.949> people<00:01:05.070> will<00:01:05.309> might<00:01:05.489> prefer

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
stiff so some people will might prefer

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.539 
stiff so some people will might prefer
that<00:01:06.060> to<00:01:06.330> say<00:01:06.689> other<00:01:07.020> more<00:01:07.680> loosely<00:01:08.130> stuffed

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
that to say other more loosely stuffed

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.120 
that to say other more loosely stuffed
plushies<00:01:09.090> so<00:01:09.990> that's<00:01:10.290> definitely<00:01:10.530> something

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
plushies so that's definitely something

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.219 
plushies so that's definitely something
to<00:01:11.310> consider<00:01:11.520> and<00:01:12.180> it<00:01:12.420> also<00:01:12.630> is<00:01:12.930> a<00:01:12.960> bit

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
to consider and it also is a bit

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.700 
to consider and it also is a bit
top-heavy<00:01:14.330> purloined<00:01:15.330> has<00:01:15.600> a<00:01:15.630> big<00:01:15.960> head<00:01:16.200> so<00:01:16.590> it

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
top-heavy purloined has a big head so it

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.780 
top-heavy purloined has a big head so it
kind<00:01:16.950> of<00:01:17.070> if<00:01:17.729> you<00:01:17.939> situate<00:01:18.509> it<00:01:18.659> right<00:01:19.670> kind<00:01:20.670> of

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
kind of if you situate it right kind of

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.510 
kind of if you situate it right kind of
bend<00:01:21.210> his<00:01:21.390> head<00:01:21.420> to<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:21.840> side<00:01:22.170> it<00:01:22.619> will<00:01:23.189> stay

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
bend his head to the side it will stay

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.630 
bend his head to the side it will stay
for<00:01:23.880> you<00:01:24.030> so<00:01:24.270> it<00:01:24.390> will<00:01:24.710> usually<00:01:25.710> stand<00:01:26.070> up<00:01:26.340> but

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
for you so it will usually stand up but

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.030 
for you so it will usually stand up but
otherwise<00:01:27.060> it<00:01:27.450> can<00:01:27.720> be<00:01:27.750> top-heavy<00:01:28.380> so<00:01:28.740> that<00:01:28.890> is

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
otherwise it can be top-heavy so that is

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.580 
otherwise it can be top-heavy so that is
something<00:01:29.400> to<00:01:29.460> pay<00:01:29.759> attention<00:01:30.000> to<00:01:30.380> also<00:01:31.380> it

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
something to pay attention to also it

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.810
