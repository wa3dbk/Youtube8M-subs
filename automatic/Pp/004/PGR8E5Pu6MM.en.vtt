00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:37.060 
uploading in case things happen where we

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:38.670 
uploading in case things happen where we
can't<00:05:37.270> make<00:05:37.360> a<00:05:37.389> video<00:05:37.599> one<00:05:37.780> week<00:05:37.960> but<00:05:38.320> we're

you're<00:05:38.860> done<00:05:39.130> with<00:05:39.250> two<00:05:39.370> once<00:05:39.940> we<00:05:40.030> get<00:05:40.120> five

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:40.300 
you're done with two once we get five

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:41.410 
we're going to start uploading and i

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:42.750 
we're going to start uploading and i
think<00:05:41.620> i'm<00:05:41.680> going<00:05:41.860> to<00:05:42.010> make<00:05:42.430> a<00:05:42.460> different

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:42.760 
think i'm going to make a different

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:46.080 
think i'm going to make a different
channel<00:05:43.060> for<00:05:43.210> that<00:05:44.010> just<00:05:45.010> because<00:05:45.310> i<00:05:45.699> actually

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:46.090 
channel for that just because i actually

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:48.000 
channel for that just because i actually
don't<00:05:46.570> like<00:05:46.630> it<00:05:46.900> a<00:05:47.139> lot<00:05:47.500> of<00:05:47.620> times<00:05:47.800> when<00:05:47.949> people

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:48.010 
don't like it a lot of times when people

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:50.100 
don't like it a lot of times when people
make<00:05:48.310> different<00:05:48.639> channels<00:05:48.909> for<00:05:49.120> it<00:05:49.210> but<00:05:49.389> its

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:50.110 
make different channels for it but its

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:52.260 
make different channels for it but its
key<00:05:50.530> and<00:05:50.650> I'm<00:05:50.710> doing<00:05:51.220> it<00:05:51.310> like<00:05:51.430> 5050<00:05:51.880> and<00:05:52.210> I

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:52.270 
key and I'm doing it like 5050 and I

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:54.210 
key and I'm doing it like 5050 and I
feel<00:05:52.449> like<00:05:52.479> it'd<00:05:52.659> be<00:05:52.750> selfish<00:05:53.139> if<00:05:53.349> I<00:05:53.560> just<00:05:54.070> put

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:54.220 
feel like it'd be selfish if I just put

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:55.920 
feel like it'd be selfish if I just put
it<00:05:54.310> on<00:05:54.430> my<00:05:54.580> channel<00:05:55.000> and<00:05:55.210> that<00:05:55.449> he<00:05:55.539> has<00:05:55.659> like<00:05:55.780> no

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:55.930 
it on my channel and that he has like no

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:57.420 
it on my channel and that he has like no
access<00:05:56.349> to<00:05:56.380> so<00:05:56.770> we're<00:05:57.099> going<00:05:57.190> to<00:05:57.280> make<00:05:57.340> a

it again I just he lives in Mississippi

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:21.190 
it again I just he lives in Mississippi
or<00:07:18.410> another<00:07:18.920> state<00:07:19.220> that<00:07:19.910> live<00:07:20.030> in<00:07:20.120> Texas<00:07:20.450> um

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:21.200 
or another state that live in Texas um

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:23.230 
or another state that live in Texas um
but<00:07:21.710> yeah<00:07:21.860> that's<00:07:22.070> pretty<00:07:22.250> much<00:07:22.400> that's<00:07:22.700> and<00:07:23.060> I

00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:23.240 
but yeah that's pretty much that's and I

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:24.460 
but yeah that's pretty much that's and I
think<00:07:23.450> the<00:07:23.540> gameplay<00:07:23.930> is<00:07:24.050> kind<00:07:24.260> of<00:07:24.320> coming

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:24.470 
think the gameplay is kind of coming

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:26.080 
think the gameplay is kind of coming
down<00:07:24.590> to<00:07:24.860> an<00:07:24.950> end<00:07:25.130> it<00:07:25.700> could<00:07:25.820> have<00:07:25.910> been<00:07:25.970> a<00:07:26.030> lot

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:26.090 
down to an end it could have been a lot

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:27.640 
down to an end it could have been a lot
better<00:07:26.270> i<00:07:26.480> think<00:07:26.750> i'd<00:07:26.840> add<00:07:26.990> a<00:07:27.020> couple<00:07:27.380> kills

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:27.650 
better i think i'd add a couple kills
