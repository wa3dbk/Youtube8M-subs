pace doesn't necessarily feel at eighty
one<00:05:12.000> shot<00:05:12.360> I<00:05:12.600> think<00:05:13.140> maybe<00:05:13.320> shooting<00:05:14.010> deserves

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:14.280 
one shot I think maybe shooting deserves

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.310 
one shot I think maybe shooting deserves
to<00:05:14.430> be<00:05:14.520> a<00:05:14.550> bit<00:05:14.730> higher<00:05:14.940> is<00:05:15.150> finishing<00:05:15.510> but

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:16.320 
to be a bit higher is finishing but

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.980 
to be a bit higher is finishing but
unfortunately<00:05:16.500> not<00:05:17.280> his<00:05:17.670> shot<00:05:18.180> power<00:05:18.420> so

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:18.990 
unfortunately not his shot power so

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:19.910 
unfortunately not his shot power so

has a weak shot he has low strength all
of<00:05:54.330> these<00:05:54.480> come<00:05:54.810> together<00:05:54.960> to<00:05:55.350> me<00:05:55.470> and<00:05:55.560> that<00:05:55.650> he

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:55.860

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:57.870 
isn't the player that you would hope for

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:00.740 
isn't the player that you would hope for
when<00:05:58.440> spending<00:05:58.800> a<00:05:59.130> million<00:05:59.760> coins<00:06:00.330> or<00:06:00.570> you

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:00.750 
when spending a million coins or you

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:02.120 
when spending a million coins or you
know<00:06:00.870> even<00:06:00.900> if<00:06:01.170> he<00:06:01.230> comes<00:06:01.380> down<00:06:01.590> to<00:06:01.770> six<00:06:02.010> or

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:02.130 
know even if he comes down to six or

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:04.370 
know even if he comes down to six or
seven<00:06:02.400> hundred<00:06:02.700> I<00:06:02.880> would<00:06:03.420> think<00:06:03.690> that<00:06:03.840> a<00:06:04.020> fair

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:04.380 
seven hundred I would think that a fair

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:06.200 
seven hundred I would think that a fair
price<00:06:04.710> room<00:06:05.100> would<00:06:05.280> be<00:06:05.460> between<00:06:05.700> three<00:06:06.180> and

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:06.210 
price room would be between three and

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:08.630 
price room would be between three and
four<00:06:06.660> hundred<00:06:07.050> K<00:06:07.260> I<00:06:07.500> think<00:06:08.010> at<00:06:08.130> that<00:06:08.160> kind<00:06:08.550> of

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:08.640 
four hundred K I think at that kind of

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:10.640 
four hundred K I think at that kind of
money<00:06:08.760> is<00:06:09.060> worth<00:06:09.090> upgrading<00:06:09.540> from<00:06:10.080> his<00:06:10.260> non<00:06:10.500> in

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:10.650 
money is worth upgrading from his non in

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:13.250 
money is worth upgrading from his non in
form<00:06:10.980> but<00:06:11.460> in<00:06:11.610> the<00:06:11.700> current<00:06:11.850> guys<00:06:12.260> probably

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:13.260 
form but in the current guys probably

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:14.750 
form but in the current guys probably
not<00:06:13.740> we're<00:06:13.950> going<00:06:14.070> to<00:06:14.130> give<00:06:14.250> him<00:06:14.370> an<00:06:14.430> eight<00:06:14.550> out

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:14.760
