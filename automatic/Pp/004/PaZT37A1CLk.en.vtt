records<00:06:43.540> this<00:06:43.660> year<00:06:43.930> and<00:06:44.130> you<00:06:45.130> know<00:06:45.190> we<00:06:45.340> had

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:45.460 
records this year and you know we had

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:46.620 
records this year and you know we had
some<00:06:45.610> good<00:06:45.760> games<00:06:45.820> when<00:06:46.180> we<00:06:46.240> played<00:06:46.450> down

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:46.630 
some good games when we played down

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:48.960 
some good games when we played down
there<00:06:46.870> and<00:06:47.080> we<00:06:47.830> didn't<00:06:48.340> have<00:06:48.460> our<00:06:48.490> full<00:06:48.760> lineup

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:48.970 
there and we didn't have our full lineup

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:51.570 
there and we didn't have our full lineup
as<00:06:49.210> well<00:06:49.390> at<00:06:49.540> that<00:06:49.570> time<00:06:49.900> so<00:06:50.200> we<00:06:50.650> know<00:06:51.370> they're

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:51.580 
as well at that time so we know they're

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:52.710 
as well at that time so we know they're
a<00:06:51.610> good<00:06:51.760> team<00:06:51.790> but<00:06:51.970> we're<00:06:52.180> also<00:06:52.300> a<00:06:52.450> good<00:06:52.600> team

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:52.720 
a good team but we're also a good team

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:53.790 
a good team but we're also a good team
up<00:06:52.870> here<00:06:52.930> I<00:06:53.080> think<00:06:53.200> it's<00:06:53.320> going<00:06:53.440> to<00:06:53.470> be<00:06:53.590> a<00:06:53.620> great

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:53.800 
up here I think it's going to be a great

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:56.010 
up here I think it's going to be a great
series
