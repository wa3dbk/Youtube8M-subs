00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:16.610 
breakage and even baldness I spent many
years<00:02:14.910> searching<00:02:15.329> for<00:02:15.720> a<00:02:15.750> product<00:02:16.079> to<00:02:16.200> rectify

this<00:02:16.680> issue<00:02:17.069> I'm<00:02:17.790> now<00:02:18.060> confident<00:02:18.569> that<00:02:18.780> I<00:02:18.840> have

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
this issue I'm now confident that I have

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:21.199 
this issue I'm now confident that I have
developed<00:02:19.230> a<00:02:19.530> complete<00:02:19.950> system<00:02:20.160> that<00:02:20.970> allows

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
developed a complete system that allows

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:23.600 
developed a complete system that allows
damage-free<00:02:21.599> quick<00:02:22.079> removal<00:02:22.380> our<00:02:23.099> movies

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
damage-free quick removal our movies

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.220 
damage-free quick removal our movies
that's<00:02:23.760> a<00:02:23.819> time<00:02:24.030> free<00:02:24.329> and<00:02:24.569> when<00:02:24.720> sprayed<00:02:25.019> onto

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
that's a time free and when sprayed onto

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.780 
that's a time free and when sprayed onto
the<00:02:25.410> bonded<00:02:25.709> area<00:02:26.010> it<00:02:26.250> causes<00:02:26.459> a<00:02:26.610> reaction

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
the bonded area it causes a reaction

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.300 
the bonded area it causes a reaction
that<00:02:27.690> allows<00:02:27.989> the<00:02:28.260> bond<00:02:28.440> to<00:02:28.590> simply<00:02:28.920> slide<00:02:29.130> off

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
that allows the bond to simply slide off

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.270 
that allows the bond to simply slide off
the<00:02:29.430> head<00:02:30.650> yeah<00:02:31.650> because<00:02:31.859> that's<00:02:32.100> the<00:02:32.250> time

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
the head yeah because that's the time

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.879 
the head yeah because that's the time
actually<00:02:32.639> damages<00:02:33.269> the<00:02:33.900> hair's<00:02:34.139> cuticle<00:02:34.859> of

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:34.889 
actually damages the hair's cuticle of

00:02:34.889 --> 00:02:36.289 
actually damages the hair's cuticle of
the<00:02:35.040> hair<00:02:35.130> so<00:02:35.400> you<00:02:35.489> can<00:02:35.639> imagine<00:02:35.700> if<00:02:36.000> you<00:02:36.060> start

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:36.299 
the hair so you can imagine if you start

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:37.190 
the hair so you can imagine if you start
putting<00:02:36.450> that<00:02:36.630> on<00:02:36.750> the<00:02:36.810> roots<00:02:36.959> of<00:02:37.079> the<00:02:37.170> hair

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
putting that on the roots of the hair

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.620 
putting that on the roots of the hair
well<00:02:38.100> you<00:02:38.190> need<00:02:38.340> to<00:02:38.459> remove<00:02:38.700> them<00:02:39.000> it's<00:02:39.389> then

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
well you need to remove them it's then

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.319 
well you need to remove them it's then
going<00:02:39.660> to<00:02:39.959> bring<00:02:40.670> the<00:02:41.670> client's<00:02:42.030> hair<00:02:42.120> and<00:02:42.269> if

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:42.329 
going to bring the client's hair and if

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:43.400 
going to bring the client's hair and if
it<00:02:42.420> doesn't<00:02:42.630> bring<00:02:42.720> the<00:02:42.840> clients<00:02:43.139> hair<00:02:43.260> at

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
it doesn't bring the clients hair at

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:44.629 
it doesn't bring the clients hair at
then<00:02:43.530> afterwards<00:02:43.889> it's<00:02:44.010> going<00:02:44.130> to<00:02:44.190> weaken<00:02:44.489> it

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:44.639 
then afterwards it's going to weaken it

00:02:44.639 --> 00:02:49.550 
then afterwards it's going to weaken it
so<00:02:45.120> then<00:02:45.299> the<00:02:45.420> hair<00:02:45.569> just<00:02:45.750> breaks<00:02:45.989> off<00:02:46.230> and<00:02:48.560> do

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
so then the hair just breaks off and do

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.020 
so then the hair just breaks off and do
a<00:02:49.620> couple<00:02:49.920> more<00:02:50.069> so<00:02:50.340> you<00:02:50.430> can<00:02:50.579> actually<00:02:50.730> just

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
a couple more so you can actually just

00:02:51.030 --> 00:03:00.910 
a couple more so you can actually just
say<00:02:52.010> how<00:02:53.010> quick<00:02:54.560> it<00:02:55.560> will<00:02:55.709> come<00:02:55.920> out

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.960 

and<00:03:01.920> then<00:03:02.040> I'll<00:03:02.129> we<00:03:02.250> do<00:03:02.480> we<00:03:03.480> just<00:03:03.659> get<00:03:03.780> the<00:03:03.870> kind

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
and then I'll we do we just get the kind

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:09.530 
and then I'll we do we just get the kind
we<00:03:05.970> start<00:03:06.209> coming<00:03:06.599> out<00:03:06.769> from<00:03:07.769> the<00:03:07.890> rope<00:03:08.540> like

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540
