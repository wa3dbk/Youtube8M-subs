00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:05.190 

okay<00:00:04.150> so<00:00:04.210> today<00:00:04.450> we're<00:00:04.690> going<00:00:04.780> to<00:00:04.840> be<00:00:04.960> going

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:05.200 
okay so today we're going to be going

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.050 
okay so today we're going to be going
over<00:00:05.410> the<00:00:05.620> central<00:00:05.950> dogma<00:00:06.190> and<00:00:06.460> protein

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:07.060 
over the central dogma and protein

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:09.390 
over the central dogma and protein
synthesis<00:00:07.630> and<00:00:07.660> so<00:00:08.590> for<00:00:08.800> those<00:00:08.920> who<00:00:09.190> are

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:09.400 
synthesis and so for those who are

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.760 
synthesis and so for those who are
watching<00:00:09.910> this<00:00:10.240> that<00:00:10.540> are<00:00:10.690> taking<00:00:11.230> a<00:00:11.320> genetics

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:11.770 
watching this that are taking a genetics

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:13.230 
watching this that are taking a genetics
class<00:00:11.920> that<00:00:12.220> may<00:00:12.340> need<00:00:12.520> some<00:00:12.670> help<00:00:12.850> this<00:00:13.150> is

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:13.240 
class that may need some help this is

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:14.190 
class that may need some help this is
probably<00:00:13.480> not<00:00:13.660> going<00:00:13.750> to<00:00:13.840> be<00:00:13.930> the<00:00:14.050> right

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:14.200 
probably not going to be the right

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.049 
probably not going to be the right
lecture<00:00:14.410> for<00:00:14.710> you<00:00:14.830> will<00:00:15.220> be<00:00:15.340> going<00:00:15.460> more<00:00:15.910> in

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:16.059 
lecture for you will be going more in

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:18.090 
lecture for you will be going more in
detail<00:00:16.449> in<00:00:16.990> future<00:00:17.140> lectures<00:00:17.500> but<00:00:17.830> for<00:00:18.010> now

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:18.100 
detail in future lectures but for now

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:19.919 
detail in future lectures but for now
this<00:00:18.250> is<00:00:18.310> just<00:00:18.580> for<00:00:18.730> people<00:00:19.390> studying<00:00:19.720> for<00:00:19.869> the

00:00:19.919 --> 00:00:19.929 
this is just for people studying for the

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:23.339 
this is just for people studying for the
mcat<00:00:20.050> and<00:00:20.560> a<00:00:20.650> very<00:00:21.039> general<00:00:21.490> overview<00:00:21.999> only<00:00:22.990> so

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:23.349 
mcat and a very general overview only so

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:25.050 
mcat and a very general overview only so
just<00:00:23.529> to<00:00:23.650> start<00:00:23.710> what<00:00:24.400> is<00:00:24.490> the<00:00:24.579> central<00:00:24.880> dogma

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:25.060 
just to start what is the central dogma

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.899 
just to start what is the central dogma
so<00:00:25.570> the<00:00:25.689> central<00:00:26.019> dogma<00:00:26.169> it<00:00:27.159> has<00:00:27.429> to<00:00:27.640> do<00:00:27.789> with

00:00:27.899 --> 00:00:27.909 
so the central dogma it has to do with

00:00:27.909 --> 00:00:30.390 
so the central dogma it has to do with
protein<00:00:28.359> synthesis<00:00:28.869> so<00:00:29.019> it<00:00:29.289> will<00:00:29.409> tell<00:00:29.710> us<00:00:29.739> how

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:30.400 
protein synthesis so it will tell us how

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.750 
protein synthesis so it will tell us how
proteins<00:00:31.029> are<00:00:31.269> made<00:00:31.320> so<00:00:32.320> specifically<00:00:32.890> going

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:33.760 
proteins are made so specifically going

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:38.430 
proteins are made so specifically going
from<00:00:33.940> DNA<00:00:34.770> DNA<00:00:35.770> goes<00:00:36.039> into<00:00:36.280> RNA<00:00:36.640> and<00:00:36.940> RNA<00:00:37.930> goes

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:38.440 
from DNA DNA goes into RNA and RNA goes

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.849 
from DNA DNA goes into RNA and RNA goes
into<00:00:39.190> protein<00:00:39.760> okay<00:00:40.750> so<00:00:40.809> that<00:00:41.140> is<00:00:41.170> the<00:00:41.530> central

00:00:41.849 --> 00:00:41.859 
into protein okay so that is the central

00:00:41.859 --> 00:00:43.889 
into protein okay so that is the central
dogma<00:00:42.039> that<00:00:42.280> fact<00:00:42.820> right<00:00:43.059> there<00:00:43.329> we're<00:00:43.719> not

00:00:43.889 --> 00:00:43.899 
dogma that fact right there we're not

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:45.779 
dogma that fact right there we're not
going<00:00:44.050> to<00:00:44.109> skip<00:00:44.289> from<00:00:44.500> DNA<00:00:44.859> all<00:00:45.160> we<00:00:45.309> all<00:00:45.550> the

00:00:45.779 --> 00:00:45.789 
going to skip from DNA all we all the

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:47.520 
going to skip from DNA all we all the
way<00:00:45.910> going<00:00:45.940> to<00:00:46.300> protein<00:00:46.690> and<00:00:46.899> we're<00:00:47.230> not<00:00:47.320> going

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:47.530 
way going to protein and we're not going

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:50.340 
way going to protein and we're not going
to<00:00:47.620> skip<00:00:48.269> RNA<00:00:49.269> going<00:00:49.629> straight<00:00:49.870> to<00:00:49.989> protein

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:50.350 
to skip RNA going straight to protein

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.259 
to skip RNA going straight to protein
without<00:00:50.500> having<00:00:51.070> any<00:00:51.219> DNA<00:00:51.670> to<00:00:51.730> begin<00:00:52.120> with

00:00:52.259 --> 00:00:52.269 
without having any DNA to begin with

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:54.329 
without having any DNA to begin with
okay<00:00:52.870> so<00:00:53.289> that's<00:00:53.469> just<00:00:53.559> what<00:00:53.800> the<00:00:53.980> central

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:54.339 
okay so that's just what the central

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:57.090 
okay so that's just what the central
dogma<00:00:54.460> is<00:00:54.899> so<00:00:55.899> from<00:00:56.260> DNA<00:00:56.589> to<00:00:56.620> RNA<00:00:56.769> that's

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:57.100 
dogma is so from DNA to RNA that's

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.759 
dogma is so from DNA to RNA that's
called<00:00:57.670> something<00:00:58.030> called<00:00:58.769> transcription

00:00:59.759 --> 00:00:59.769 
called something called transcription

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:02.579 
called something called transcription
and<00:01:00.339> from<00:01:01.149> RNA<00:01:01.570> to<00:01:01.899> protein<00:01:02.350> is<00:01:02.559> called

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:02.589 
and from RNA to protein is called

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:08.039 
and from RNA to protein is called
translation<00:01:05.100> okay<00:01:06.100> so<00:01:06.160> transcription<00:01:07.090> is<00:01:07.270> DNA

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:08.049 
translation okay so transcription is DNA

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:11.010 
translation okay so transcription is DNA
and<00:01:08.290> specifically<00:01:09.040> to<00:01:09.280> mrna<00:01:10.030> Oh<00:01:10.180> a<00:01:10.240> messenger

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020 
and specifically to mrna Oh a messenger

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.310 
and specifically to mrna Oh a messenger
RNA<00:01:11.500> and<00:01:12.460> so<00:01:13.030> we're<00:01:13.360> going<00:01:13.450> to<00:01:13.540> see<00:01:13.840> the

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:14.320 
RNA and so we're going to see the

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.380 
RNA and so we're going to see the
important<00:01:14.890> thing<00:01:15.100> is<00:01:15.280> where<00:01:15.640> does<00:01:15.820> it<00:01:15.970> occur

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.390 
important thing is where does it occur

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.490 
important thing is where does it occur
so<00:01:17.170> in<00:01:17.320> eukaryotes<00:01:17.920> first<00:01:18.460> prokaryotes<00:01:19.500> where

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:20.500 
so in eukaryotes first prokaryotes where

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.410 
so in eukaryotes first prokaryotes where
does<00:01:20.680> it<00:01:20.740> occur<00:01:21.070> well<00:01:21.310> it's<00:01:21.790> going<00:01:21.939> to<00:01:22.030> occur

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
does it occur well it's going to occur

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.899 
does it occur well it's going to occur
in<00:01:22.450> the<00:01:22.780> same<00:01:23.079> place<00:01:23.350> that<00:01:23.470> DNA<00:01:24.130> is<00:01:24.159> located<00:01:24.790> in

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:24.909 
in the same place that DNA is located in

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:26.850 
in the same place that DNA is located in
and<00:01:25.090> that<00:01:25.600> would<00:01:25.810> be<00:01:25.930> in<00:01:26.020> the<00:01:26.110> nucleus<00:01:26.530> and

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.860 
and that would be in the nucleus and

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.700 
and that would be in the nucleus and
that's<00:01:27.820> only<00:01:28.060> for<00:01:28.390> you<00:01:28.479> carrots<00:01:28.899> but<00:01:29.350> the<00:01:29.470> same

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:29.710 
that's only for you carrots but the same

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:31.230 
that's only for you carrots but the same
thing<00:01:29.920> goes<00:01:30.070> for<00:01:30.100> prokaryotes<00:01:30.790> it's<00:01:31.030> going<00:01:31.180> to

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
thing goes for prokaryotes it's going to

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:32.639 
thing goes for prokaryotes it's going to
happen<00:01:31.390> in<00:01:31.570> the<00:01:31.600> same<00:01:31.840> place<00:01:32.020> where<00:01:32.259> DNA<00:01:32.439> is

00:01:32.639 --> 00:01:32.649 
happen in the same place where DNA is

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:35.039 
happen in the same place where DNA is
located<00:01:33.159> but<00:01:33.310> there<00:01:33.490> is<00:01:33.549> no<00:01:33.700> nucleus<00:01:34.090> so<00:01:34.930> it's

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:35.049 
located but there is no nucleus so it's

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:37.350 
located but there is no nucleus so it's
going<00:01:35.140> to<00:01:35.229> be<00:01:35.320> the<00:01:35.409> cytoplasm<00:01:35.920> all<00:01:36.820> right<00:01:37.000> so

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.360 
going to be the cytoplasm all right so

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.230 
going to be the cytoplasm all right so
what<00:01:37.630> does<00:01:37.899> this<00:01:38.140> so<00:01:38.799> RNA<00:01:39.280> polymerase<00:01:39.939> does

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 
what does this so RNA polymerase does

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.240 
what does this so RNA polymerase does
this<00:01:40.450> and<00:01:40.659> this<00:01:40.750> is<00:01:40.810> an<00:01:41.110> enzyme<00:01:41.350> similar<00:01:42.100> to

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.250 
this and this is an enzyme similar to

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.550 
this and this is an enzyme similar to
DNA<00:01:42.549> polymerase<00:01:43.030> where<00:01:43.869> I'll<00:01:44.020> lay<00:01:44.200> down<00:01:44.409> the

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 
DNA polymerase where I'll lay down the

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.850 
DNA polymerase where I'll lay down the
tracks<00:01:44.590> okay<00:01:45.280> um<00:01:45.520> and<00:01:46.240> so<00:01:46.990> it<00:01:47.289> would<00:01:47.409> convert

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860 
tracks okay um and so it would convert

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.240 
tracks okay um and so it would convert
DNA<00:01:48.399> into<00:01:49.119> RNA<00:01:49.170> all<00:01:50.170> right<00:01:50.320> and<00:01:50.500> we'll<00:01:50.860> see

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
DNA into RNA all right and we'll see

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.399 
DNA into RNA all right and we'll see
exactly<00:01:51.610> what<00:01:52.299> the<00:01:52.450> difference<00:01:52.810> between<00:01:52.899> DNA

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:53.409 
exactly what the difference between DNA

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:58.980 
exactly what the difference between DNA
and<00:01:53.530> RNA<00:01:53.979> is<00:01:54.869> all<00:01:55.869> right<00:01:56.280> so<00:01:57.280> DNA<00:01:57.789> verse<00:01:58.030> RNA<00:01:58.539> so

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
and RNA is all right so DNA verse RNA so

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:00.690 
and RNA is all right so DNA verse RNA so
if<00:01:59.109> we<00:01:59.229> have<00:01:59.320> on<00:01:59.560> a<00:01:59.590> on<00:01:59.859> this<00:02:00.039> side<00:02:00.280> and<00:02:00.310> we'll

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 
if we have on a on this side and we'll

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.849 
if we have on a on this side and we'll
put<00:02:00.909> DNA<00:02:01.329> on<00:02:01.509> this<00:02:01.780> side<00:02:02.020> we'll<00:02:02.500> go<00:02:02.680> over<00:02:02.710> some

00:02:02.849 --> 00:02:02.859 
put DNA on this side we'll go over some

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:04.590 
put DNA on this side we'll go over some
of<00:02:03.070> the<00:02:03.159> very<00:02:03.490> key<00:02:03.729> points<00:02:04.149> that<00:02:04.180> you'll<00:02:04.450> need

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
of the very key points that you'll need

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.469 
of the very key points that you'll need
to<00:02:04.659> know<00:02:04.810> alright<00:02:05.710> so<00:02:06.369> the<00:02:06.850> first<00:02:06.880> thing<00:02:07.210> is

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 
to know alright so the first thing is

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:12.860 
to know alright so the first thing is
that<00:02:07.570> RNA<00:02:08.350> is<00:02:08.560> single-stranded

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.920 

versus<00:02:13.230> DNA<00:02:13.709> is<00:02:13.920> double<00:02:14.459> stranded<00:02:14.909> all<00:02:15.750> right

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
versus DNA is double stranded all right

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.869 
versus DNA is double stranded all right
so<00:02:16.140> we<00:02:16.260> have<00:02:16.290> that<00:02:16.530> double<00:02:16.980> helix<00:02:17.159> versus<00:02:17.700> just

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:17.879 
so we have that double helix versus just

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:20.330 
so we have that double helix versus just
a<00:02:18.060> single<00:02:18.360> shine<00:02:18.690> of<00:02:18.840> RNA<00:02:19.319> all<00:02:19.920> right<00:02:20.069> the

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
a single shine of RNA all right the

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.740 
a single shine of RNA all right the
nucleotides<00:02:21.090> involved<00:02:21.690> will<00:02:22.049> be<00:02:22.080> a<00:02:22.580> you<00:02:23.580> G<00:02:24.480> and

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
nucleotides involved will be a you G and

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:31.100 
nucleotides involved will be a you G and
C<00:02:25.220> vs<00:02:26.220> a<00:02:26.370> T<00:02:27.269> G<00:02:28.230> and<00:02:28.500> C<00:02:28.700> so<00:02:29.700> we<00:02:29.940> see<00:02:30.150> that<00:02:30.180> what<00:02:30.930> has

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
C vs a T G and C so we see that what has

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.580 
C vs a T G and C so we see that what has
changed<00:02:31.680> is<00:02:31.799> the<00:02:31.829> tea<00:02:32.250> and<00:02:32.549> then<00:02:32.760> you<00:02:33.170> and<00:02:34.170> so

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
changed is the tea and then you and so

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.160 
changed is the tea and then you and so
if<00:02:35.040> we<00:02:35.190> can<00:02:35.370> remember<00:02:35.819> a<00:02:35.970> binds<00:02:36.420> with<00:02:36.599> t<00:02:36.780> and<00:02:36.810> g

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
if we can remember a binds with t and g

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.050 
if we can remember a binds with t and g
bonds<00:02:37.500> with<00:02:37.620> see<00:02:37.860> so<00:02:38.250> the<00:02:38.400> same<00:02:38.700> would<00:02:38.909> be<00:02:38.940> true

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
bonds with see so the same would be true

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.869 
bonds with see so the same would be true
g<00:02:39.599> bounds<00:02:39.930> with<00:02:40.049> c<00:02:40.260> and<00:02:40.500> so<00:02:40.890> now<00:02:41.069> we<00:02:41.129> can<00:02:41.340> pretty

00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:41.879 
g bounds with c and so now we can pretty

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:43.220 
g bounds with c and so now we can pretty
much<00:02:41.970> assume<00:02:42.180> that<00:02:42.480> a<00:02:42.629> is<00:02:42.810> going<00:02:42.930> to<00:02:42.989> bond<00:02:43.200> with

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
much assume that a is going to bond with

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.849 
much assume that a is going to bond with
you<00:02:43.760> ok<00:02:45.109> the<00:02:46.109> next<00:02:46.140> thing<00:02:46.410> i'm<00:02:46.560> going<00:02:46.590> to<00:02:46.709> look

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:46.859 
you ok the next thing i'm going to look

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:51.949 
you ok the next thing i'm going to look
at<00:02:47.010> is<00:02:47.599> ribose<00:02:48.599> versus<00:02:49.579> deoxyribose<00:02:50.870> ok<00:02:51.870> so

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
at is ribose versus deoxyribose ok so

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:53.839 
at is ribose versus deoxyribose ok so
what<00:02:52.290> does<00:02:52.379> that<00:02:52.410> mean<00:02:52.769> so<00:02:52.980> remember<00:02:53.400> ribose

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:53.849 
what does that mean so remember ribose

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:58.130 
what does that mean so remember ribose
look<00:02:54.120> something<00:02:54.480> like<00:02:54.510> this<00:02:56.810> then<00:02:57.810> we<00:02:57.900> had<00:02:58.019> our

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
look something like this then we had our

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.220 
look something like this then we had our
little<00:02:58.290> ch2<00:02:58.980> group<00:02:59.220> by<00:02:59.400> here<00:02:59.879> and<00:03:00.060> our<00:03:00.480> bases

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
little ch2 group by here and our bases

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.170 
little ch2 group by here and our bases
but<00:03:01.409> that's<00:03:01.590> not<00:03:01.950> exactly<00:03:02.430> ribose<00:03:02.970> that's

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
but that's not exactly ribose that's

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.960 
but that's not exactly ribose that's
adding<00:03:03.480> stuff<00:03:03.659> onto<00:03:03.900> it<00:03:04.700> deoxyribose<00:03:05.700> look

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
adding stuff onto it deoxyribose look

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.180 
adding stuff onto it deoxyribose look
something<00:03:06.329> like<00:03:06.359> this<00:03:06.510> and<00:03:07.079> this<00:03:07.920> is<00:03:08.069> the

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
something like this and this is the

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:12.229 
something like this and this is the
sugar<00:03:08.489> backbone<00:03:09.859> all<00:03:10.859> right<00:03:10.980> so<00:03:11.370> deoxyribose

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
sugar backbone all right so deoxyribose

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:16.640 
sugar backbone all right so deoxyribose
lost<00:03:12.900> one<00:03:13.680> of<00:03:13.709> the<00:03:13.829> hydroxy<00:03:14.430> groups<00:03:15.140> ok<00:03:16.140> and<00:03:16.349> so

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
lost one of the hydroxy groups ok and so

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:17.539 
lost one of the hydroxy groups ok and so
the<00:03:16.769> final<00:03:16.950> thing<00:03:17.099> we're<00:03:17.310> going<00:03:17.400> to<00:03:17.459> be

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:17.549 
the final thing we're going to be

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:21.349 
the final thing we're going to be
looking<00:03:17.669> at<00:03:17.970> is<00:03:18.690> the<00:03:19.349> speed<00:03:19.680> so<00:03:20.010> the<00:03:20.040> speed<00:03:20.639> how

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:21.359 
looking at is the speed so the speed how

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:23.569 
looking at is the speed so the speed how
long<00:03:21.569> do<00:03:21.720> these<00:03:21.870> things<00:03:22.169> last<00:03:22.440> so<00:03:22.680> the<00:03:22.799> amount

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:23.579 
long do these things last so the amount

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:25.220 
long do these things last so the amount
that<00:03:23.700> are<00:03:23.970> any<00:03:24.150> last<00:03:24.329> is<00:03:24.510> a<00:03:24.540> very<00:03:24.870> short<00:03:24.930> amount

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
that are any last is a very short amount

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.280 
that are any last is a very short amount
of<00:03:25.410> time<00:03:25.470> versus<00:03:26.370> DNA<00:03:26.790> this<00:03:27.090> is<00:03:27.239> very<00:03:27.359> long<00:03:27.660> you

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
of time versus DNA this is very long you

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:29.930 
of time versus DNA this is very long you
can<00:03:28.410> imagine<00:03:28.650> that<00:03:28.859> your<00:03:29.190> DNA<00:03:29.400> will<00:03:29.669> stay<00:03:29.849> with

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
can imagine that your DNA will stay with

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.750 
can imagine that your DNA will stay with
you<00:03:30.120> forever<00:03:30.650> and<00:03:31.650> so<00:03:31.889> it<00:03:31.980> won't<00:03:32.160> be<00:03:32.280> degraded

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
you forever and so it won't be degraded

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.909 
you forever and so it won't be degraded
versus<00:03:33.060> RNA<00:03:33.510> will<00:03:33.660> be<00:03:33.750> degraded<00:03:34.260> very<00:03:34.560> quickly

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:34.919 
versus RNA will be degraded very quickly

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:37.670 
versus RNA will be degraded very quickly
because<00:03:35.629> say<00:03:36.629> you<00:03:36.690> don't<00:03:36.930> need<00:03:37.139> that<00:03:37.169> certain

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
because say you don't need that certain

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:40.670 
because say you don't need that certain
protein<00:03:38.099> to<00:03:38.310> be<00:03:38.720> constantly<00:03:39.720> translated<00:03:40.440> on

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
protein to be constantly translated on

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.039 
protein to be constantly translated on
in<00:03:40.980> the<00:03:41.069> future<00:03:41.220> from<00:03:41.489> RNA<00:03:41.849> to<00:03:41.910> protein<00:03:42.419> well

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:43.049 
in the future from RNA to protein well

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:44.780 
in the future from RNA to protein well
you<00:03:43.620> want<00:03:43.829> to<00:03:43.919> want<00:03:44.040> it<00:03:44.190> so<00:03:44.340> you<00:03:44.400> would<00:03:44.609> have<00:03:44.639> to

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
you want to want it so you would have to

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.580 
you want to want it so you would have to
degrade<00:03:45.269> it<00:03:45.629> and<00:03:45.750> that's<00:03:45.930> why<00:03:46.049> I<00:03:46.079> has<00:03:46.169> a<00:03:46.199> very

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
degrade it and that's why I has a very

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.689 
degrade it and that's why I has a very
short<00:03:46.949> amount<00:03:47.160> of<00:03:47.459> life<00:03:49.010> ok<00:03:50.010> so<00:03:50.099> we<00:03:50.280> saw<00:03:50.489> what

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:50.699 
short amount of life ok so we saw what

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:52.220 
short amount of life ok so we saw what
transcription<00:03:51.329> was<00:03:51.510> and<00:03:51.720> it<00:03:51.780> was<00:03:51.870> pretty<00:03:52.019> much

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
transcription was and it was pretty much

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:57.050 
transcription was and it was pretty much
just<00:03:52.970> RNA<00:03:53.970> or<00:03:54.180> so<00:03:54.870> sorry<00:03:55.260> DNA<00:03:55.799> to<00:03:56.069> RNA<00:03:56.099> ok<00:03:57.000> so

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
just RNA or so sorry DNA to RNA ok so

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:58.159 
just RNA or so sorry DNA to RNA ok so
now<00:03:57.389> the<00:03:57.449> next<00:03:57.690> thing<00:03:57.810> I'm<00:03:57.930> going<00:03:57.959> to<00:03:58.079> be

00:03:58.159 --> 00:03:58.169 
now the next thing I'm going to be

00:03:58.169 --> 00:04:00.259 
now the next thing I'm going to be
looking<00:03:58.410> at<00:03:58.560> is<00:03:58.709> translation<00:03:59.549> this<00:03:59.879> very

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
looking at is translation this very

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:02.809 
looking at is translation this very
general<00:04:00.660> overview<00:04:01.280> translation<00:04:02.280> again<00:04:02.609> is

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:02.819 
general overview translation again is

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:08.569 
general overview translation again is
RNA<00:04:03.750> going<00:04:04.590> into<00:04:04.949> protein<00:04:07.040> ok<00:04:08.040> so<00:04:08.160> RNA<00:04:08.459> to

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:08.579 
RNA going into protein ok so RNA to

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:11.599 
RNA going into protein ok so RNA to
protein<00:04:09.169> this<00:04:10.169> is<00:04:10.319> the<00:04:10.470> key<00:04:11.010> part<00:04:11.280> and<00:04:11.459> it

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:11.609 
protein this is the key part and it

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:15.259 
protein this is the key part and it
occurs<00:04:12.000> in<00:04:12.150> the<00:04:12.180> ribosome<00:04:13.099> and<00:04:14.099> so<00:04:14.669> ribosomes

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269 
occurs in the ribosome and so ribosomes

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:18.400 
occurs in the ribosome and so ribosomes
they're<00:04:16.169> made<00:04:16.320> up<00:04:16.440> of<00:04:16.560> different<00:04:16.709> things<00:04:17.160> and

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410 
they're made up of different things and

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:22.700 
they're made up of different things and
so<00:04:19.410> when<00:04:19.560> you<00:04:19.739> carry<00:04:20.039> oats<00:04:20.190> there's<00:04:21.150> a<00:04:21.710> small

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
so when you carry oats there's a small

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:24.740 
so when you carry oats there's a small
subunit<00:04:23.010> and<00:04:23.340> there's<00:04:23.550> a<00:04:23.610> big<00:04:23.849> subunit<00:04:24.450> and<00:04:24.479> so

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
subunit and there's a big subunit and so

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:25.840 
subunit and there's a big subunit and so
for<00:04:25.020> eukaryotes

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:25.850 
for eukaryotes

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:27.580 
for eukaryotes
we<00:04:25.970> have<00:04:26.180> something<00:04:26.600> that's<00:04:26.840> called<00:04:27.050> a<00:04:27.110> 40s

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590 
we have something that's called a 40s

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:31.390 
we have something that's called a 40s
and<00:04:27.890> the<00:04:27.920> 60s<00:04:28.790> and<00:04:29.000> that<00:04:29.600> makes<00:04:29.840> an<00:04:30.020> 80s<00:04:30.530> and<00:04:30.860> in

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 
and the 60s and that makes an 80s and in

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.270 
and the 60s and that makes an 80s and in
prokaryotes<00:04:31.910> we<00:04:32.210> have<00:04:32.420> a<00:04:32.450> 50s<00:04:33.020> and<00:04:33.650> the<00:04:33.680> 30s

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.280 
prokaryotes we have a 50s and the 30s

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:37.210 
prokaryotes we have a 50s and the 30s
and<00:04:34.550> that<00:04:34.940> makes<00:04:35.180> 70s<00:04:35.960> all<00:04:36.590> right<00:04:36.710> and<00:04:36.920> these

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:37.220 
and that makes 70s all right and these

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.100 
and that makes 70s all right and these
are<00:04:37.400> just<00:04:37.430> the<00:04:37.670> size<00:04:38.000> of<00:04:38.210> them<00:04:38.390> and<00:04:38.630> the<00:04:38.720> way

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.110 
are just the size of them and the way

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:44.500 
are just the size of them and the way
they<00:04:39.320> are<00:04:40.810> sediment<00:04:41.810> in<00:04:41.990> a<00:04:42.140> centrifuge<00:04:43.510> life

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:44.510 
they are sediment in a centrifuge life

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:47.650 
they are sediment in a centrifuge life
and<00:04:44.900> so<00:04:45.380> translation<00:04:46.340> so<00:04:46.760> this<00:04:46.940> translation

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:47.660 
and so translation so this translation

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:49.780 
and so translation so this translation
pretty<00:04:48.260> much<00:04:48.410> all<00:04:48.560> we<00:04:48.740> really<00:04:48.890> need<00:04:49.580> to<00:04:49.640> know

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:49.790 
pretty much all we really need to know

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:52.630 
pretty much all we really need to know
is<00:04:49.910> that<00:04:49.940> it<00:04:50.120> goes<00:04:50.240> from<00:04:50.330> RNA<00:04:50.810> to<00:04:50.870> protein<00:04:51.640> and

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:52.640 
is that it goes from RNA to protein and

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:54.850 
is that it goes from RNA to protein and
there's<00:04:53.270> three<00:04:53.480> different<00:04:53.600> sites<00:04:54.110> we<00:04:54.830> have

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:54.860 
there's three different sites we have

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:58.450 
there's three different sites we have
the<00:04:55.040> a<00:04:55.280> the<00:04:55.880> P<00:04:56.180> and<00:04:56.590> the<00:04:57.590> East<00:04:57.890> site<00:04:58.160> and

00:04:58.450 --> 00:04:58.460 
the a the P and the East site and

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:00.850 
the a the P and the East site and
different<00:04:59.210> things<00:04:59.240> happen<00:04:59.690> in<00:04:59.780> each<00:04:59.990> one<00:05:00.230> it's

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:00.860 
different things happen in each one it's

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:02.620 
different things happen in each one it's
not<00:05:01.010> so<00:05:01.280> much<00:05:01.340> important<00:05:02.000> we<00:05:02.120> just<00:05:02.300> need<00:05:02.510> to

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:02.630 
not so much important we just need to

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:04.870 
not so much important we just need to
know<00:05:02.750> that<00:05:02.900> there's<00:05:03.080> three<00:05:03.320> sides<00:05:03.790> for<00:05:04.790> the

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:04.880 
know that there's three sides for the

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:06.850 
know that there's three sides for the
mcat<00:05:05.240> is<00:05:05.420> just<00:05:05.630> translation<00:05:06.440> has<00:05:06.560> three

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:06.860 
mcat is just translation has three

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:10.090 
mcat is just translation has three
different<00:05:07.010> sides<00:05:07.370> that<00:05:07.850> e<00:05:08.060> the<00:05:08.300> P&amp;A<00:05:08.900> the<00:05:09.680> EU<00:05:09.950> is

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:10.100 
different sides that e the P&amp;A the EU is

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:13.090 
different sides that e the P&amp;A the EU is
the<00:05:10.220> exit<00:05:10.640> site<00:05:10.880> the<00:05:11.330> P<00:05:11.630> is<00:05:11.660> the<00:05:11.930> peptidyl<00:05:12.680> site

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:13.100 
the exit site the P is the peptidyl site

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:14.770 
the exit site the P is the peptidyl site
um<00:05:13.400> it's<00:05:13.670> where<00:05:13.850> we<00:05:13.940> have<00:05:14.090> the<00:05:14.210> growth<00:05:14.480> and<00:05:14.690> the

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:14.780 
um it's where we have the growth and the

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:19.330 
um it's where we have the growth and the
a<00:05:15.320> is<00:05:15.680> the<00:05:15.890> aminoacyl<00:05:17.590> site<00:05:18.590> and<00:05:18.860> it's<00:05:19.160> where

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:19.340 
a is the aminoacyl site and it's where

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:22.030 
a is the aminoacyl site and it's where
all<00:05:19.370> the<00:05:19.700> the<00:05:20.210> tRNAs<00:05:21.110> will<00:05:21.380> add<00:05:21.530> all<00:05:21.710> the<00:05:21.860> amino

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:22.040 
all the the tRNAs will add all the amino

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:25.480 
all the the tRNAs will add all the amino
acids<00:05:22.520> there<00:05:22.930> okay<00:05:23.950> so<00:05:24.950> another<00:05:25.190> thing<00:05:25.280> that

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:25.490 
acids there okay so another thing that

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:27.460 
acids there okay so another thing that
will<00:05:25.610> have<00:05:25.760> to<00:05:25.910> know<00:05:26.090> is<00:05:26.360> the<00:05:26.660> start<00:05:26.990> codons

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:27.470 
will have to know is the start codons

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:30.400 
will have to know is the start codons
and<00:05:27.710> the<00:05:27.890> stop<00:05:28.220> codons<00:05:28.960> alright<00:05:29.960> so<00:05:30.080> the<00:05:30.170> start

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:30.410 
and the stop codons alright so the start

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:33.430 
and the stop codons alright so the start
codons<00:05:30.860> in<00:05:31.100> translation<00:05:32.000> will<00:05:32.570> be<00:05:32.690> a<00:05:32.720> you<00:05:32.930> and

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:33.440 
codons in translation will be a you and

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:37.420 
codons in translation will be a you and
g<00:05:33.730> and<00:05:34.730> the<00:05:34.760> stop<00:05:35.120> codons<00:05:35.600> would<00:05:35.810> be<00:05:35.900> a<00:05:36.110> you<00:05:36.800> AG

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:37.430 
g and the stop codons would be a you AG

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:44.080 
g and the stop codons would be a you AG
you<00:05:38.030> a<00:05:38.060> a<00:05:38.330> and<00:05:39.010> UGA<00:05:40.210> okay<00:05:41.210> um<00:05:41.530> and<00:05:42.700> so<00:05:43.700> you<00:05:44.060> know

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:44.090 
you a a and UGA okay um and so you know

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:45.610 
you a a and UGA okay um and so you know
there's<00:05:44.360> a<00:05:44.450> lot<00:05:44.480> more<00:05:44.630> detail<00:05:45.110> that<00:05:45.230> we<00:05:45.320> can<00:05:45.470> go

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:45.620 
there's a lot more detail that we can go

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:47.140 
there's a lot more detail that we can go
into<00:05:45.800> for<00:05:46.190> translation<00:05:46.730> but<00:05:46.880> this<00:05:47.060> is<00:05:47.120> just

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:47.150 
into for translation but this is just

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:49.090 
into for translation but this is just
the<00:05:47.390> bare<00:05:47.600> minimum<00:05:47.900> just<00:05:48.470> some<00:05:48.710> of<00:05:48.770> the<00:05:48.860> facts

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:49.100 
the bare minimum just some of the facts

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:52.000 
the bare minimum just some of the facts
that<00:05:49.340> will<00:05:49.430> need<00:05:49.670> to<00:05:49.790> know
