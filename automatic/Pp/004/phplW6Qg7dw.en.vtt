00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
more imperfect than what it seems I've

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.970

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
without any makeup on at least to some

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.699 
without any makeup on at least to some
degree<00:03:10.950> I'm<00:03:11.610> not<00:03:11.790> saying<00:03:12.060> that<00:03:12.180> I<00:03:12.540> don't<00:03:13.290> like

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
degree I'm not saying that I don't like

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:15.140 
degree I'm not saying that I don't like
the<00:03:13.890> way<00:03:14.010> that<00:03:14.160> I<00:03:14.190> look<00:03:14.430> without<00:03:14.610> makeup<00:03:14.850> on

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
the way that I look without makeup on

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:16.520 
the way that I look without makeup on
that's<00:03:15.330> not<00:03:15.480> what<00:03:15.600> I'm<00:03:15.690> saying<00:03:15.840> either<00:03:16.140> I<00:03:16.320> mean

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
that's not what I'm saying either I mean

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.140 
that's not what I'm saying either I mean
I<00:03:16.590> obviously<00:03:16.830> look<00:03:17.040> different<00:03:17.520> and<00:03:17.730> I

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
I obviously look different and I

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.810 
I obviously look different and I
obviously<00:03:18.950> you<00:03:19.950> know<00:03:20.040> wear<00:03:20.310> it<00:03:20.459> all<00:03:20.640> the<00:03:20.670> time

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
obviously you know wear it all the time

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.729 
obviously you know wear it all the time
so<00:03:21.030> you'd<00:03:21.570> assume<00:03:21.870> that<00:03:22.080> I<00:03:22.140> like<00:03:22.320> the<00:03:22.410> way<00:03:22.530> I

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
so you'd assume that I like the way I

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:24.470 
so you'd assume that I like the way I
look<00:03:22.980> with<00:03:23.100> it<00:03:23.280> but<00:03:23.940> I'm<00:03:24.060> not<00:03:24.150> saying<00:03:24.300> that<00:03:24.450> I

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
look with it but I'm not saying that I

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.060 
look with it but I'm not saying that I
don't<00:03:24.600> like<00:03:25.050> the<00:03:25.440> way<00:03:25.530> that<00:03:25.680> I<00:03:25.709> look<00:03:25.920> without

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
don't like the way that I look without

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:27.740 
don't like the way that I look without
it<00:03:26.220> I<00:03:26.580> just<00:03:26.880> looked<00:03:27.000> different<00:03:27.150> without<00:03:27.600> it
