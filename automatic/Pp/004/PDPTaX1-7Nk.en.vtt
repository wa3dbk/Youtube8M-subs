00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:10.400
 a perfect yes that the someca is 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.400
 almost format 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.630
 then the question is what is completely perfect 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.190
 according to is so powerful that when doing something 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.330
 the rest can only watch and 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.130

 second-last cauberg full of struggle 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.660

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.250
 tactics were played so perfectly 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.660
 so that fox remained as the last pawn 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.669
 in the end the other was fed up 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.140
 with a very nice group ahead strong 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.880

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.649
 and I have one against the the 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.239
 other riders said from next time 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.530
 cauberg 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.590
 it should stay about this 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:46.070
 thirty forty seconds and then it falls 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.070
 about being able to 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.340
 the last time the people cauberghs again 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:56.030

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:58.250

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.170

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.810
 that it is after five times silver 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.810

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:10.900
