00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
Calgary Alberta Canada I think I figured

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:33.910 
Calgary Alberta Canada I think I figured
out<00:02:31.670> shipping<00:02:32.090> to<00:02:32.209> be<00:02:32.300> about<00:02:32.620> 150<00:02:33.620> was<00:02:33.800> in

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
out shipping to be about 150 was in

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.160 
out shipping to be about 150 was in
Canada<00:02:34.340> about<00:02:34.550> 200<00:02:35.330> to<00:02:35.510> the<00:02:35.630> States

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
Canada about 200 to the States

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:37.900 
Canada about 200 to the States
I<00:02:36.320> really<00:02:36.830> have<00:02:36.950> no<00:02:37.130> idea<00:02:37.160> how<00:02:37.489> I'm<00:02:37.550> gonna<00:02:37.640> ship

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
I really have no idea how I'm gonna ship

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:39.810 
I really have no idea how I'm gonna ship
this<00:02:38.060> so<00:02:38.180> I'm<00:02:38.239> hoping<00:02:38.570> for<00:02:38.750> local<00:02:39.080> sales<00:02:39.350> only

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
this so I'm hoping for local sales only

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:42.370 
this so I'm hoping for local sales only
the<00:02:40.820> legs<00:02:41.000> right<00:02:41.239> now<00:02:41.300> they're<00:02:41.630> not<00:02:41.780> glued<00:02:42.140> on

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
the legs right now they're not glued on

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.890 
the legs right now they're not glued on
they<00:02:42.650> are<00:02:42.770> screwed<00:02:43.160> on<00:02:43.340> by<00:02:43.550> pocket<00:02:43.970> holes<00:02:44.150> so<00:02:44.420> I

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
they are screwed on by pocket holes so I

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.449 
they are screwed on by pocket holes so I
can<00:02:45.380> definitely<00:02:45.500> take<00:02:45.830> those<00:02:45.980> out<00:02:46.160> and<00:02:46.280> kind

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
can definitely take those out and kind

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:47.530 
can definitely take those out and kind
of<00:02:46.489> ship<00:02:46.700> them<00:02:46.850> on<00:02:46.940> the<00:02:47.030> side<00:02:47.209> so<00:02:47.390> it's<00:02:47.510> a

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
of ship them on the side so it's a

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.420 
of ship them on the side so it's a
little<00:02:47.720> bit<00:02:47.810> more<00:02:47.959> flat<00:02:48.320> I<00:02:48.560> don't<00:02:49.130> know<00:02:49.280> the

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
little bit more flat I don't know the

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:50.920 
little bit more flat I don't know the
complete<00:02:49.790> weight<00:02:50.000> of<00:02:50.150> this<00:02:50.330> I<00:02:50.600> would

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
complete weight of this I would

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:58.270 
complete weight of this I would
guesstimate<00:02:51.820> probably<00:02:53.590> hundred<00:02:54.590> pounds<00:02:57.280> okay

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
guesstimate probably hundred pounds okay

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.310 
guesstimate probably hundred pounds okay
so<00:02:58.340> this<00:02:58.580> is<00:02:58.700> about<00:02:58.850> 70<00:02:59.270> pounds<00:02:59.420> if<00:03:00.140> you<00:03:00.230> guys

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:00.320 
so this is about 70 pounds if you guys

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:01.750 
so this is about 70 pounds if you guys
have<00:03:00.560> any<00:03:00.680> questions<00:03:01.010> leave<00:03:01.340> it<00:03:01.400> in<00:03:01.610> the

coats<00:03:41.680> of<00:03:41.860> poly<00:03:42.070> curly<00:03:42.370> on<00:03:42.790> top<00:03:43.060> to<00:03:43.240> seal

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
coats of poly curly on top to seal

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:44.910 
coats of poly curly on top to seal
everything<00:03:43.630> off<00:03:44.140> just<00:03:44.410> so<00:03:44.530> you<00:03:44.650> know<00:03:44.680> the

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
everything off just so you know the

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.280 
everything off just so you know the
