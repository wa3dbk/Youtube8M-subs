home<00:02:18.459> on<00:02:18.700> these<00:02:18.940> muddy<00:02:19.209> forest<00:02:19.659> tracks<00:02:19.959> so

00:02:20.399 --> 00:02:20.409 
home on these muddy forest tracks so

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:22.289 
home on these muddy forest tracks so
let's<00:02:20.560> hit<00:02:20.709> the<00:02:20.830> dirt<00:02:21.040> and<00:02:21.099> find<00:02:21.730> out<00:02:21.940> how<00:02:22.269> it

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:22.299 
let's hit the dirt and find out how it

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:29.600 
let's hit the dirt and find out how it
performs<00:02:22.870> on<00:02:22.959> some<00:02:23.290> slippery<00:02:23.680> stuff

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.920 

off-road<00:02:30.610> on<00:02:30.640> these<00:02:30.969> forest<00:02:31.420> tracts<00:02:31.780> the

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
off-road on these forest tracts the

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:33.990 
off-road on these forest tracts the
Subaru<00:02:32.409> Forester<00:02:32.980> really<00:02:33.340> is<00:02:33.519> in<00:02:33.700> its<00:02:33.849> element

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
Subaru Forester really is in its element

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.030 
Subaru Forester really is in its element
and<00:02:34.390> that's<00:02:34.689> why<00:02:34.930> people<00:02:35.349> out<00:02:35.500> in<00:02:35.620> the<00:02:35.709> rural

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
and that's why people out in the rural

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.979 
and that's why people out in the rural
areas<00:02:36.370> of<00:02:36.400> Australia<00:02:36.969> love<00:02:37.209> it<00:02:37.329> so<00:02:37.540> much

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:37.989 
areas of Australia love it so much

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:40.020 
areas of Australia love it so much
now<00:02:38.379> the<00:02:38.650> all-wheel<00:02:38.980> drive<00:02:39.250> system<00:02:39.700> is<00:02:39.730> great

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
now the all-wheel drive system is great

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:41.880 
now the all-wheel drive system is great
and<00:02:40.209> you've<00:02:40.599> always<00:02:40.780> got<00:02:40.930> traction<00:02:41.439> no<00:02:41.709> matter

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
and you've always got traction no matter

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:43.740 
and you've always got traction no matter
how<00:02:42.069> slippery<00:02:42.400> the<00:02:42.640> surface<00:02:43.030> is<00:02:43.180> beneath<00:02:43.540> you

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
how slippery the surface is beneath you

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.170 
how slippery the surface is beneath you
and<00:02:43.930> the<00:02:44.290> diesel<00:02:44.709> engines<00:02:45.040> fantastic<00:02:45.790> it's

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
and the diesel engines fantastic it's

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.240 
and the diesel engines fantastic it's
got<00:02:46.359> a<00:02:46.390> meaty<00:02:46.720> chunk<00:02:47.170> of<00:02:47.319> Tor<00:02:47.590> and<00:02:47.739> that's

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
got a meaty chunk of Tor and that's

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.550 
got a meaty chunk of Tor and that's
available<00:02:48.549> low<00:02:49.000> down<00:02:49.239> in<00:02:49.269> the<00:02:49.510> rev<00:02:49.689> range<00:02:49.720> so

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
available low down in the rev range so

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:51.899 
available low down in the rev range so
it<00:02:50.709> always<00:02:50.859> feels<00:02:51.340> like<00:02:51.609> you're<00:02:51.790> getting

00:02:51.899 --> 00:02:51.909 
it always feels like you're getting

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:53.940 
it always feels like you're getting
league<00:02:52.209> and<00:02:52.390> need<00:02:52.510> to<00:02:52.689> go<00:02:52.870> without<00:02:53.439> having<00:02:53.739> to

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
league and need to go without having to

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.910 
league and need to go without having to
work<00:02:54.129> too<00:02:54.370> hard<00:02:54.400> on<00:02:55.329> top<00:02:55.569> of<00:02:55.720> that<00:02:55.810> the<00:02:56.260> new<00:02:56.439> CVT

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
work too hard on top of that the new CVT

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.589 
work too hard on top of that the new CVT
makes<00:02:57.549> a<00:02:57.670> real<00:02:57.879> difference<00:02:58.329> especially

00:02:58.589 --> 00:02:58.599 
makes a real difference especially

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:01.349

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:21.720 
some sealed tarmac and I have to say
it's<00:03:20.380> just<00:03:20.560> as<00:03:20.650> impressive<00:03:21.130> on<00:03:21.250> the<00:03:21.280> road<00:03:21.550> as

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
it's just as impressive on the road as

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.940

really<00:03:24.700> flexible<00:03:24.940> and<00:03:25.450> it's<00:03:25.660> beautifully

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 
really flexible and it's beautifully

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:27.540 
really flexible and it's beautifully
matched<00:03:26.410> to<00:03:26.590> the<00:03:26.680> automatic<00:03:27.160> transmission

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:27.550 
matched to the automatic transmission

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:29.729 
matched to the automatic transmission
and<00:03:28.000> you<00:03:28.420> get<00:03:28.569> a<00:03:28.600> real<00:03:28.840> punchy<00:03:29.319> feeling

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630 
especially off the mark or if you need

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:33.600 
especially off the mark or if you need
to<00:03:31.660> do<00:03:31.870> roll-on<00:03:32.319> overtaking<00:03:32.980> on<00:03:33.100> the<00:03:33.190> highway

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610 
to do roll-on overtaking on the highway

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:35.970 
to do roll-on overtaking on the highway
it's<00:03:34.090> always<00:03:34.540> got<00:03:34.780> plenty<00:03:34.989> of<00:03:35.170> power<00:03:35.410> right

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
it's always got plenty of power right

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:37.830 
it's always got plenty of power right
when<00:03:36.220> you<00:03:36.340> need<00:03:36.550> it<00:03:36.730> and<00:03:36.819> whichever<00:03:37.569> way<00:03:37.780> you

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
when you need it and whichever way you

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:44.520 
when you need it and whichever way you
look<00:03:38.019> at<00:03:38.170> it<00:03:38.230> it's<00:03:38.500> a<00:03:38.590> really<00:03:38.800> great<00:03:39.010> combo<00:03:43.530> so

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
look at it it's a really great combo so

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:46.500 
look at it it's a really great combo so
it's<00:03:44.800> fair<00:03:45.010> to<00:03:45.130> say<00:03:45.160> that<00:03:45.489> Subaru<00:03:45.819> fans<00:03:46.269> have

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 
it's fair to say that Subaru fans have

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.539 
it's fair to say that Subaru fans have
had<00:03:46.630> a<00:03:46.690> long<00:03:46.959> while<00:03:47.200> to<00:03:47.230> wait<00:03:47.709> for<00:03:48.280> a<00:03:48.310> diesel

00:03:48.539 --> 00:03:48.549 
had a long while to wait for a diesel

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:51.210 
had a long while to wait for a diesel

automatic forester the diesel engines

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.070 
automatic forester the diesel engines
fantastic<00:03:51.910> previously<00:03:52.480> you<00:03:52.569> could<00:03:52.690> only<00:03:52.750> get

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:53.080 
fantastic previously you could only get

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.850 
fantastic previously you could only get
it<00:03:53.110> with<00:03:53.290> a<00:03:53.319> manual

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:53.860 
it with a manual

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:56.280 
it with a manual
now<00:03:54.160> with<00:03:54.430> the<00:03:54.519> CVT<00:03:54.940> it<00:03:55.450> makes<00:03:55.900> it<00:03:56.019> a<00:03:56.110> really

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
now with the CVT it makes it a really

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.100 
now with the CVT it makes it a really
flexible<00:03:56.620> driving<00:03:57.370> machine<00:03:57.730> on<00:03:57.940> and<00:03:58.360> off<00:03:58.810> road
