00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:10.630
 let's edit this photo that I took in the 

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:13.660
 shoe store in lisbon 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:15.520
 The first thing we are going to do is adjust 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:19.779
 the white balance because you see that 

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:21.820
 has a yellow dominant that I do not 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:25.779
 like 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:28.390
 let's try selecting a point 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:30.160
 from an area that we know you have to 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:33.250
 be neutral 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:37.330
 what result do we have and we see that 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:40.510
 effectively the neutral zones or the 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:43.720
 wall and ceiling appear completely 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:47.020
 white but instead the red soil 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:49.270
 It has lost intensity 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:51.790
 For this, what we are going to do is 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:54.370
 adjust the white balance a bit 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:58.420
 warmer 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:01:02.469
 until we see 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:04.309
 that the intensity of red we like 

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:06.320
 plus 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:10.040
 what happens that now we have again 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.960
 dominant on the white wall to 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:16.000
 remove it 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:20.110
 I'm going to do it working by zones 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:23.250
 and saturating, let's try an 80 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.250
 saturation cent 

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:30.579
 selecting only what would be the 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:30.579
 ceiling in the wall 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:36.840
 we could do this also with him 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.750
 working by zones what is the 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.930
 white balance but being a case 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.250
 very simple and this one has to be 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.640
 used to doing it like this in 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.130
 previous investments of lightroom 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.730
 I do it with 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:55.350
 the low saturation 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:57.360
 we see that now we have a 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:01.049
 a neutral tone for the wall and ceiling 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:03.090
 and the red of the floor has one more color 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:08.039
 interesting that the first option that 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:11.430
 we had done anyway I'm going to 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:15.750
 back off a bit the saturation for 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:19.430
 that the effect is not so radical and not 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.430
 look like a photomontage 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.950
 that's fine with me 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:28.430
 what are we going to do now to give it a 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:30.469
 little more intensity and contrast 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:36.400
 that will also increase the saturation 

00:02:30.469 --> 00:02:36.400
 of the colors is to apply a curve 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:42.030
 of tones with a strong contrast we 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:45.110
 they approved what is not so strong 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.110
 I'm doing well 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:53.110
 as I already like it a lot more 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:55.720
 the overall appearance of the photo other thing 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:59.799
 that I see is the deformation of the 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:03.280
 target in a kite and that too 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:05.920
 causes the vintner at the tips of the 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:08.860
 What I'm going to do now is with 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:11.980
 lens correction activate profile 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:14.530
 the lens and we see how it has already corrected 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.569
 very well what would be the horizontal 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:19.200
 of this photo and it was already taken with intention 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:23.019
 with a totally frontal point of view 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:25.900
 to give more emphasis to this design 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:27.750
 minimalist of the interior design of this 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:31.230
 crazy 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:35.390
 and the only thing I'm going to try to finish 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.390
 adjust the distortion a bit 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:41.670
 or know 

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:41.670
 something like that 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:47.329
 why 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:49.780
 Whatever the maximum and horizontal as possible 

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:49.780
 lines 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:56.450
 At the same time I see that I still have one 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:58.250
 little vignette effect that in this 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:01.879
 type of compositions I do not like that 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:04.189
 appear because being a composition 

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:07.159
 by stripes the stripe of the roof of the 

00:04:04.189 --> 00:04:09.459
 wall and soil because I like to leave 

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:12.260
 as the impression that continues 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:14.840
 infinitely these stripes by the 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:17.829
 left and on the right that's why the 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:19.850
 viÃ±eta do gives me more a feeling of 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:24.289
 concentration that I do not like in these 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:29.409
 cases I will try to decrease a bit 

00:04:24.289 --> 00:04:32.039
 plus the vignetting for example as 

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:32.039
 A) Yes 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:40.280
 very good now the thing that I am 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:43.340
 in lack is a little more of protagonism 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:45.540
 of all these electronic pieces that 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:49.360
 there is on the wall 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:52.719
 if I edit the photo by zones 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:56.050
 and taking advantage of the area that you edit that is 

00:04:52.719 --> 00:04:58.569
 it stops saturating if here what I do 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:02.189
 is to increase the clarity that would be a 

00:04:58.569 --> 00:05:06.039
 local contrast what happens to me I like 

00:05:02.189 --> 00:05:07.719
 how it is in the circuits but what 

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:12.159
 I do not like it, it loses softness 

00:05:07.719 --> 00:05:14.139
 fluorescent light on the ceiling by 

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:19.900
 that what I'm going to do is leave this 

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:23.169
 equal area and create a new zone just 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:26.669
 for circuits not 

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:26.669
 this new selection 

00:05:31.129 --> 00:05:35.700
 very well 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:40.440
 Y 

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:43.920
 perfect selection and let's leave it to 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:46.470
 see the clarity if I pass obviously 

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:48.910
 it's exaggerated or we're going to leave it more or 

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:51.590
 less so 

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:54.980
 in agreement 

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:57.590
 Well, I do not think I'm going to do any 

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:59.560
 another adjustment because the histogram already 

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:02.410
 I was 

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:05.320
 quite correct from the taking of the 

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:06.930
 picture only your own are burned 

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:11.880
 lights 

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:14.610
 and it seems to me that that's the way it is 

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:16.470
 quite correct result let's go now 

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:17.950
 to check the before and after how 

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:22.710
 has been 

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:22.710
 and here you have the result
