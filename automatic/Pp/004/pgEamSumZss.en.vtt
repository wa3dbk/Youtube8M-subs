00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.389
 Hello to you guys I fell so 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.099
 pretty often I go to other cities 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.570
 often have to become in 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.429
 hotels but there are regular prices 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.350
 space therefore have to look 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.600
 options for people who publish that is it 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.100
 apartments that I rent 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.789
 Found an app in the appstore called 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.289
 but rent and let him talk 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:26.939
 let's go application and first of all i am you 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.429
 I will tell about minuses which thank God 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.080
 here a little 1 minus is the one that search 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.550
 available for only two years 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.590
 Moscow and St. Petersburg one by one 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.790
 Moscow region, but I am sure that 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.890
 updates will be developers 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.840
 add new areas new cities and 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.690
 we will get a large-scale search by cities 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.129
 not only Russia but also other countries in the CIS 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.450
 the program has a simple filter 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.700
 which will allow you to find a one-room 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.350
 two or three rooms and above 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.360
 apartment that is you will find something that you 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.309
 looking for another one of the advantages of this 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.289
 programs probably the main plus is this 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.149
 that the battle of this program is clean is all 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.640
 happening thanks to manual moderation 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.770
 there is a person tracking ads and 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.660
 chooses those who really 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.670
 real without realtors th you get 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.020
 apartment from the owners see that 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.710
 every ad has any 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.900
 contact 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.729
 this is either in contact or phone and you 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.830
 can write or call and given 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.509
 man and just learn everything from him 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.770
 With an example I can write to Mary by 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.810
 about her apartment agree on 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.430
 meeting what to see by the way is convenient 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.500
 what is right in this application you can 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.080
 find the contact of the person who 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.909
 rents this or that apartment application 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.560
 easy to use if you just 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.090
 want to find yourself an apartment in which you 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.950
 stop for a while you 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.540
 rate this app appreciated 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.850
 we see that next to each ad 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.439
 there is a basket and an asterisk for example if 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.600
 click on the basket then you can weed out 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:42.509
 an ad that doesn't suit you either 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.950
 mark it to be removed or just 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.780
 linger if as i said on not 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.340
 suitable also has a select 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.049
 for example if you are looking for a lot of options 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.549
 then you want to choose the one that you 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.740
 need you can add a lot 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.720
 ads in favorites and then select 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.409
 what you need can also file 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.869
 your ad that is to beat the city 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:02.030
