00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:04.480
 you do not have to go to norway 

00:00:03.189 --> 00:00:06.700
 make big secrets 

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:10.000
 That is also relatively easy 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:11.559
 accomplish without one 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.589
 Madness exploitation with drag 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:16.720
 one needs three good ones in principle 

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:18.280
 if you go to norway that is 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:21.040
 something like that 

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:22.720
 that is a good one like you 

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:24.700
 also in the baltic sea with it can 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:27.520
 we still wonderful in norway the almost 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:31.510
 1 against fishing with pilgrims with rubber 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:33.010
 Fishing throw weight 200 grams 300 grams 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:35.650
 that depends a bit on the 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.360
 personal preferences starting with a method 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:40.390
 which is especially popular with Norway 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.100
 drivers that is that nadal in larger 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.560
 Deep there you catch everything 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:47.350
 directs and floral still halibut and 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:49.750
 there will be some other species of fish for it 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.790
 By default, a 20 to 30 from co2 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.560
 used as she shared one here 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:54.790
 is now an inliner where the schools 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:57.790
 runs and of course you can also one 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:01:00.370
 Conditional ones take a multi fitting 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:02.230
 and the recorded with a 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:04.570
 plaited braided because of this 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.130
 was like a big deep lack has 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.170
 none of which we have direct contact 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.510
 to the fish 20 kilo load she should 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.190
 and that with that you actually 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:14.320
 in most parts of Norway very well 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:15.310
 it is now ready for the role 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.780
 not so important if one 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.310
 push or not the brake has that 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.380
 it's also a bit of a question of 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.750
 personal taste the push 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:25.299
 Brake is easier to operate 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:26.860
 because the braking power is always the same 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:28.690
 can be adjusted at a stern 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.220
 brake when rumfummeln a brake 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:30.640
 then the braking power is stronger 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.380
 weaker 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.150
 this can already be an inexperienced one 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.470
 small problem will be there so then 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.570
 the brake is certainly the better one 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:40.060
 choice 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:42.610
 for friends of light fishing 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.200
 a medium-weight spin route one 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.970
 very good choice in norway there you can 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.430
 Thus, a stationary roll light 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:50.500
 lace and light lures would be nice 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:53.380
 on pollack fishing but on salmon 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.090
 very entertaining angela is fun 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.350
 especially when you blow the wind and you 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.700
 did not come out right then you can 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:02.800
 between the islands the so-called 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:04.900
 Shear wonderful with this device 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:08.649
 classic bait for norway fishing 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:12.300
 Still the pilgrim is in many 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:14.970
 Executions from 20 grams to 1000 grams 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:19.270
 usually one is actually with 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:23.770
 weights from 60 to 200 250 grams well 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:26.260
 served wilken is the classic form 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:28.180
 in norway, however, will not - she 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.800
 It is often formed on the ground but it becomes 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.000
 also many medium water filled the 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.739
 fish hunt medium water space 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.180
 Central water primarily existed as fish 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:34.660
 and salmon are rather medium water 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.350
 captured 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:40.330
 josh homme ground but also goes out 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:41.980
 Novi This thirds water to as the 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.600
 to chase rings or play sand 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:51.100
 then he eats hunt and will have as our 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:53.160
 can also be offered politically 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:56.079
 Fishing is just the last years 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:58.269
 very popular norway too 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:03:00.940
 extremely penny on a lot of fish species 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:03.070
 and it's just about little rubber 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:06.250
 fish 10 to 12 cm with very light 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:10.870
 heads 30 grams 40 grams on pollack and 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:13.090
 there partly on salmon and with it 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.880
 really heavy caliber 300 grams 400 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.440
 grams 500 grams in deep or deep 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.430
 on larger fish like halibut or 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.430
 big or big 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:26.830
 to the conservationist fishing you use the 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.900
 under assembly but so synonymous down 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:31.390
 come, of course, a corresponding 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.710
 heavy bligh that starts at 200 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:36.190
 gram if you do not fish quite so deep 

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:37.870
 wants and up to 1000 grams is fished 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:40.209
 So over 1000 grams it really is 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.580
 very exhausting so the standard 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:49.870
 lead weight for fishing is not too between 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:51.640
 400 and 600 grams around the great catches 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.200
 which one then lands in norway 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:56.260
 of course you have to be able to process 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.830
 accordingly, a good team is better at it 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.989
 to have 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:01.900
 preferably two different ones 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:03.310
 length softer blade harder blade 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.750
 that is also a bit the question of 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.190
 personal taste of the one freezes 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:08.739
 never was with a slightly harder sounds 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:10.570
 another with another should be great 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:14.230
 be enough because sometimes I know too 

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:17.079
 Not big fisherman is a good idea 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:19.180
 if you caught fish with it 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:21.250
 the water is frozen too 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:24.040
 it really runs out in such a way 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:25.900
 old potato or onion sack 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.590
 this is the designer of oranges 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.140
 pretty much no matter 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:30.790
 there you can reinstopfen and can 

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:33.010
 you then there for half an hour 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:34.720
 hang out and then that's neat 

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:38.280
 drained and you do not have so much 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:38.280
 water what you freeze
