00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:18.760 
it's a tiger's eye I expected out a

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:20.580 
it's a tiger's eye I expected out a
little<00:01:19.030> bit<00:01:19.210> of<00:01:19.300> hair<00:01:19.510> up<00:01:19.690> there<00:01:19.720> I<00:01:20.260> didn't

little bit of hair up there I didn't

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.310 
little bit of hair up there I didn't
know<00:01:20.619> my<00:01:21.400> expectation<00:01:22.270> was<00:01:22.479> is<00:01:22.780> that<00:01:22.960> as<00:01:23.110> it

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:23.320 
know my expectation was is that as it

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:24.930 
know my expectation was is that as it
got<00:01:23.440> longer<00:01:23.680> you<00:01:24.070> would<00:01:24.190> notice<00:01:24.550> that<00:01:24.580> it<00:01:24.790> was

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:24.940 
got longer you would notice that it was

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:26.760 
got longer you would notice that it was
thinner<00:01:25.210> and<00:01:25.930> then<00:01:26.140> I<00:01:26.170> really<00:01:26.530> actually

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
thinner and then I really actually

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.560 
thinner and then I really actually
wouldn't<00:01:27.310> be<00:01:27.399> able<00:01:27.460> to<00:01:27.610> do<00:01:27.850> what<00:01:28.060> I<00:01:28.090> wanted<00:01:28.479> to

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:28.570 
wouldn't be able to do what I wanted to

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.260 
wouldn't be able to do what I wanted to
do<00:01:28.720> and<00:01:28.930> that<00:01:29.020> was<00:01:29.170> to<00:01:29.680> throw<00:01:30.399> it<00:01:30.550> out<00:01:30.670> super

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 
do and that was to throw it out super

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.240 
do and that was to throw it out super
long<00:01:31.479> and<00:01:32.040> also<00:01:33.040> get<00:01:33.220> in<00:01:33.340> the<00:01:33.430> swimming<00:01:33.670> pool

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
long and also get in the swimming pool

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.180 
long and also get in the swimming pool
and<00:01:36.250> that<00:01:36.880> hasn't<00:01:37.149> been<00:01:37.330> the<00:01:37.540> case<00:01:38.190> it

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:39.190 
and that hasn't been the case it

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:41.340 
and that hasn't been the case it
actually<00:01:39.520> I<00:01:40.149> mean<00:01:40.390> it's<00:01:40.570> full<00:01:40.780> whether<00:01:41.080> it's

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
actually I mean it's full whether it's

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.219 
actually I mean it's full whether it's
wet<00:01:41.619> dry<00:01:42.330> and<00:01:43.330> especially<00:01:43.869> like<00:01:44.050> you<00:01:44.200> said

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:44.229
