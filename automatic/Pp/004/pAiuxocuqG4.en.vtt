00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:09.600
 useful hello to all guys found in 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.340
 this new part of ruby pokemon 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:14.190
 mega last time we faced 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:20.460
 ester this time we will head into the hall 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:22.830
 of the third super 4 freda freddo ok then 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.750
 we can't play guard ar or better 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.760
 gardev doesn't suit us can be 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:31.859
 very well played but I prefer 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:33.900
 dealing with gross gross meta meta is 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.820
 higher than the others 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:39.180
 because I remember we took it through 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.309
 domus don secret can't talk 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.530
 from the secret and therefore receives beauty 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.390
 of experience points is not normal 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.850
 experience points of the pokémon that come 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.589
 normally caught by us 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.430
 I looked forward to coaching the 

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:52.260
 hot spirits 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.729
 you will be able you and your team of 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.629
 face a mega evolution that 

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:56.629
 freezes the blood in the veins 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:04.710
 I must consider this a threat 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:06.510
 cold then its mega evolution is 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.780
 the only one that is not ice type, even though 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:12.149
 no there are more than a few who can 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:18.359
 better to evolve like ice though 

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:22.740
 the new one and igla there I don't think that 

00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:25.710
 now playing at medieval snow bomb 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.539
 I don't think so right away 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:31.070
 then never evolution and let's go of 

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:36.450
 meteor punch again this time 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:38.549
 we play against cold with meta gross is 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.429
 better megoso gross guys than 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:44.130
 we have seen little in ours 

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:46.049
 adventure to a simply because it is 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.840
 too strong guys then I consider 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.909
 really not very strong and therefore 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.240
 I didn't really see the need to 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.509
 use it 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.170
 I came just the need then cross 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:02:00.130
 the ass 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:01.930
 meteor punch also on her from each 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:07.960
 however we suffer damage due to it 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:11.440
 of hail put in field by descents 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:15.730
 we see a snow and the arts are fine or 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:19.680
 how beautiful bea artic here it is level 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:23.290
 72 I'm noticing that every super four 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.600
 increases by the low average level of 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:29.080
 his pokémon 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:31.000
 the first was 70 at the second 71 and now 72 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.440
 meta gross suffers other damages from the 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.489
 hailstorm 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:38.290
 all in a range that we do the 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:40.269
 let's put handcuffs on as he admits 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:43.390
 next i think if able to 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:46.239
 knock it down you know boh maybe with marta 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:48.790
 to the fist, however, I prefer to peel and 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:50.769
 put man act rick warren to the level 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.500
 73 here for example we are now 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:57.910
 using but network that is barely 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:59.829
 at 73 here is ok to the straight but the blow is 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.600
 been paralyzed very well has 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:05.500
 paralyzed should not possess body 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:08.769
 yellow sapid boys no ok this 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:12.160
 rendon has it, but it's a war skill 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:14.170
 in body gello now I don't remember if it is 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:17.709
 the world 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:21.870
 or not, however, it stops hailing 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:25.090
 well let's go to landfill and this time 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:27.700
 for the last time because I have the rain 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:29.620
 cow pop I can't explain why it has 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.900
 used the total recharge you do not have the 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.970
 red life the rule was only lived there 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.609
 stop use the total top-ups 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:40.090
 oh well if the saras cordata wants to 

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:44.170
 send va nilox we replace r put 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:45.880
 meta grass valley would be the ice cream of 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:47.680
 fifth generation for those who don't 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:50.410
 He knew a little but that does not 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.359
 you see it very often and therefore can 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:55.480
 let it not be known 

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:57.840
 ok puts pride and now i expect 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:03.450
 gla from there can not not have 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:06.780
 these cannot fail to have trouble from the avenues 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:08.790
 in fact the boys were rather al 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.450
 sure from the mega evolution of this 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.269
 pokémon 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:14.450

 our mag to meta gross is one 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:33.570

 cross mag to meta gross mag to meta gross 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:42.000

 I still do very well or you would like 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.690
 even melt my heart out of 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:46.770
 ice is a more pleasant feeling 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:48.660

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:51.479
