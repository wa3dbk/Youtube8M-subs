attracted<00:06:34.430> us<00:06:34.550> to<00:06:34.909> walk<00:06:35.599> joy<00:06:35.839> especially<00:06:35.960> for

00:06:36.579 --> 00:06:36.589 
attracted us to walk joy especially for

00:06:36.589 --> 00:06:38.529 
attracted us to walk joy especially for
the<00:06:36.680> aging<00:06:36.979> population<00:06:37.129> with<00:06:37.969> the<00:06:38.000> peripheral

00:06:38.529 --> 00:06:38.539 
the aging population with the peripheral

00:06:38.539 --> 00:06:41.709 
the aging population with the peripheral
neuropathy<00:06:39.229> is<00:06:39.469> it<00:06:39.979> works<00:06:40.219> with<00:06:40.490> the<00:06:40.699> body<00:06:40.939> to

00:06:41.709 --> 00:06:41.719 
neuropathy is it works with the body to

00:06:41.719 --> 00:06:43.749 
neuropathy is it works with the body to
enhance<00:06:42.259> it<00:06:42.529> so<00:06:42.740> that<00:06:42.919> they<00:06:43.039> can<00:06:43.250> continue<00:06:43.580> to

00:06:43.749 --> 00:06:43.759 
enhance it so that they can continue to

00:06:43.759 --> 00:06:47.230 
enhance it so that they can continue to
be<00:06:43.969> active<00:06:44.449> in<00:06:44.689> it<00:06:45.319> from<00:06:45.919> the<00:06:46.250> inside<00:06:46.909> out

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:47.240 
be active in it from the inside out

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:49.240 
be active in it from the inside out
where<00:06:47.629> the<00:06:47.719> nervous<00:06:48.080> system<00:06:48.439> stimulates<00:06:49.009> it

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:49.250 
where the nervous system stimulates it

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:51.699 
where the nervous system stimulates it
so<00:06:50.000> that<00:06:50.240> they<00:06:50.389> can<00:06:50.659> go<00:06:51.019> ahead<00:06:51.050> and<00:06:51.469> be<00:06:51.589> as

00:06:51.699 --> 00:06:51.709 
so that they can go ahead and be as

00:06:51.709 --> 00:06:52.610 
so that they can go ahead and be as
active<00:06:51.949> as<00:06:52.159> they<00:06:52.310> need

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:52.620 
active as they need

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:55.010 
active as they need
to<00:06:52.710> be<00:06:52.889> and<00:06:53.070> retrain<00:06:53.460> themselves<00:06:53.699> a<00:06:54.270> lot<00:06:54.900> of

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:55.020 
to be and retrain themselves a lot of

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:57.950 
to be and retrain themselves a lot of
these<00:06:55.110> people<00:06:55.620> will<00:06:56.610> just<00:06:56.880> hang<00:06:57.630> up<00:06:57.810> their

00:06:57.950 --> 00:06:57.960 
these people will just hang up their

00:06:57.960 --> 00:06:59.750 
these people will just hang up their
activity<00:06:58.260> and<00:06:58.470> sit<00:06:58.740> on<00:06:58.770> the<00:06:58.919> sidelines<00:06:59.430> and

00:06:59.750 --> 00:06:59.760 
activity and sit on the sidelines and

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:01.909 
activity and sit on the sidelines and
medicate<00:07:00.210> themselves<00:07:00.470> we<00:07:01.470> give<00:07:01.650> them<00:07:01.770> an

00:07:01.909 --> 00:07:01.919 
medicate themselves we give them an

00:07:01.919 --> 00:07:04.340 
medicate themselves we give them an
alternative<00:07:02.010> for<00:07:02.729> that<00:07:02.940> we<00:07:03.540> believe<00:07:03.870> that<00:07:04.110> the

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:04.350 
alternative for that we believe that the

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:06.260 
alternative for that we believe that the
population<00:07:04.979> now<00:07:05.160> is<00:07:05.340> more<00:07:05.490> youthful<00:07:05.760> and<00:07:06.120> they

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:06.270 
population now is more youthful and they

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:08.750 
population now is more youthful and they
want<00:07:06.479> to<00:07:06.570> stay<00:07:06.750> more<00:07:06.990> active<00:07:07.580> but<00:07:08.580> there's

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:08.760 
want to stay more active but there's

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:10.250 
want to stay more active but there's
something<00:07:09.060> else<00:07:09.210> that's<00:07:09.389> more<00:07:09.510> important<00:07:10.139> on

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:10.260 
something else that's more important on

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:14.120 
something else that's more important on
this<00:07:10.470> we<00:07:11.190> can't<00:07:11.460> forget<00:07:11.699> that<00:07:12.240> by<00:07:13.199> showing<00:07:13.560> the

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:14.130 
this we can't forget that by showing the

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:16.550 
this we can't forget that by showing the
patient<00:07:14.580> this<00:07:14.840> by<00:07:15.840> showing<00:07:16.169> them<00:07:16.440> their

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:19.290 
progress it then becomes therapeutic

00:07:19.290 --> 00:07:22.310 
progress it then becomes therapeutic
they<00:07:20.100> see<00:07:20.160> that<00:07:20.669> there<00:07:20.910> are<00:07:21.150> making<00:07:21.479> gains<00:07:21.900> and
