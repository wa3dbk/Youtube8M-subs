00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.810
 good friends is already the contribution is nothing 

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:08.029
 we have installed this bulb to 

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:10.040
 client that is a p 3 the two bulbs 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:12.349
 in ape 3 and they come with two keys 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:14.269
 different we have the service key 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:16.610
 of which the manufacturer gives us two 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:20.120
 units of this combo of the pétriz de 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:21.800
 cisa and then we have the key to the 

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:24.080
 customer the key to the owner who 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.580
 are five copies well the keys are 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.860
 anti copy and they carry a system that makes 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:30.710
 missing an identification card for 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:33.890
 can make the copy as you will see with the 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:36.280
 customer key closes the lock 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:36.280
 higher 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.840
 how the lock is boiling 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:43.360
 The upper one is closed, all the 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.680
 bolts according the house above and 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.850
 the box below also though I 'm not 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.850
 watching the images come out 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:54.070
 with the service key also closes 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:58.270
 all balls 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:01:00.720
 up and down the advantage is that 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:04.809
 if you give the service key to 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:06.400
 Mrs. cleaning or who he needs and 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:08.290
 at some point they wish that although she 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.119
 have your key can not enter you 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.190
 what they will have to do is close the 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:14.440
 lower lock 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:17.800
 that has two volcanoes but in turn 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:19.570
 is lock locks the top of 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.120
 so that when the lady of 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:25.300
 service come with your key though 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:27.100
 try to open the lock she can not 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.810
 the whole door is left to reach 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.570
 all the houses from the top box 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:34.390
 the bar that carries the right to the box 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:36.070
 central the 2 burón is the box below 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.890
 and the bar that leads to the floor in accordance 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:41.770
 and your key of course does not open the 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:45.070
 lower bulb that can only be 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:47.020
 open with the key owner of the 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.520
 agreement then the owner can 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.960
 decide when the person who has the 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.030
 service key enters the home 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.160
 and when it does not enter the home 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.440
 simply closing the system works 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.880
 both inside the door and by 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.080
 outside but inside for comfort the 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.180
 manufacturer installed in the 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:03.310
 moth with which we do not have to 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.530
 walking with the key is simply some 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.910
 video below so we will act with the 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.069
 TV from within 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:12.099
 when we close it 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:14.530
 As you can see, the layer goes back 

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:16.650
 inferior and this already allows us to 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.290
 back off the top layer 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.120
 or lower of which only opens 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.489
 the customer's key with a key 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.860
 the two locks or the 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:29.489
 light bulbs better said then with that key 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:31.620
 we can allow them weight or deny the 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:33.480
 Access to the person with the key 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.700
 of the service I hope you liked it 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.200
 the installation of this door is a 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.849
 door that is really worth it 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.799
 being in an address gives you a lot 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:42.659
 safety especially if we have children 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:44.579
 game simply for the safety of 

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:45.959

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:47.430
 have a service person and they have 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:48.720
 that person controlled at all times 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.340
 that you do not have to go asking for the 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.989
 key if we have problem with it 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.790

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:55.920

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.420

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.549

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.349
