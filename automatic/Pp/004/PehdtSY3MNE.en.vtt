00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
thought how am I gonna store them I like

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.109 
thought how am I gonna store them I like
my<00:00:25.080> brushes<00:00:25.439> to<00:00:25.859> be<00:00:25.980> stuck<00:00:26.310> in<00:00:26.490> some<00:00:26.519> sort<00:00:26.789> of

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
my brushes to be stuck in some sort of

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.659 
my brushes to be stuck in some sort of
container<00:00:27.650> not<00:00:28.650> lying<00:00:28.920> down<00:00:29.599> lying<00:00:30.599> flat<00:00:30.900> and

00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:31.669 
container not lying down lying flat and

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:35.680 
container not lying down lying flat and
I<00:00:32.669> thought<00:00:33.030> if<00:00:33.239> I<00:00:33.420> store<00:00:33.840> them<00:00:33.989> like<00:00:34.230> this

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:35.690 
I thought if I store them like this

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.190 
I thought if I store them like this
all<00:00:36.690> these<00:00:36.930> brushes<00:00:37.260> will<00:00:37.590> get<00:00:37.860> ruined<00:00:39.140> so<00:00:40.140> I

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
all these brushes will get ruined so I

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.540 
all these brushes will get ruined so I
looked<00:00:40.440> in<00:00:40.590> my<00:00:40.739> drawers<00:00:41.010> and<00:00:41.309> what<00:00:41.610> I<00:00:41.640> found<00:00:42.440> is

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:43.550 
looked in my drawers and what I found is

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.600 
looked in my drawers and what I found is
their<00:00:44.550> brush<00:00:45.059> guides<00:00:45.390> and<00:00:46.010> there<00:00:47.010> was<00:00:47.160> a<00:00:47.190> craze

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
their brush guides and there was a craze

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.760 
their brush guides and there was a craze
a<00:00:47.879> while<00:00:48.180> ago<00:00:48.390> on<00:00:48.570> YouTube<00:00:49.050> about<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.530> brush

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
a while ago on YouTube about the brush

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.639 
a while ago on YouTube about the brush
guards<00:00:50.280> and<00:00:50.570> the<00:00:51.570> idea<00:00:51.870> is<00:00:52.140> that<00:00:52.320> when<00:00:52.500> you've

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
guards and the idea is that when you've

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.630 
guards and the idea is that when you've
washed<00:00:52.860> your<00:00:53.070> brush<00:00:53.460> you<00:00:54.500> put<00:00:55.500> it<00:00:55.739> in<00:00:55.920> here<00:00:56.219> and

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
washed your brush you put it in here and

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.849 
washed your brush you put it in here and
you<00:00:57.180> dry<00:00:57.480> it<00:00:57.539> that<00:00:57.930> way<00:00:58.109> so<00:00:58.170> it<00:00:58.379> keeps<00:00:58.590> its

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
you dry it that way so it keeps its

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.599 
you dry it that way so it keeps its
shape<00:00:58.949> to<00:00:59.539> me<00:01:00.539> it<00:01:01.140> was<00:01:01.320> too<00:01:01.590> much<00:01:01.770> bother<00:01:02.100> I

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
shape to me it was too much bother I

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.270 
shape to me it was too much bother I
might<00:01:03.600> be<00:01:03.750> used<00:01:03.930> it<00:01:04.110> once<00:01:04.320> for<00:01:04.559> that<00:01:04.710> purpose

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
might be used it once for that purpose

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.280 
might be used it once for that purpose
but<00:01:05.790> thankfully<00:01:06.299> I<00:01:06.330> didn't<00:01:06.750> throw<00:01:06.930> them<00:01:07.110> away

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
but thankfully I didn't throw them away

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.870 
but thankfully I didn't throw them away
and<00:01:07.650> because<00:01:07.979> they're<00:01:08.130> coming<00:01:08.490> different

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
and because they're coming different

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.630 
and because they're coming different
sizes<00:01:09.840> I<00:01:10.049> thought<00:01:10.830> that's<00:01:11.040> what<00:01:11.280> I<00:01:11.369> could<00:01:11.610> use

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
sizes I thought that's what I could use

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.840 
sizes I thought that's what I could use
them<00:01:12.060> for<00:01:12.299> so<00:01:13.080> for<00:01:13.409> example<00:01:14.010> this<00:01:14.490> is<00:01:14.549> the

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
them for so for example this is the

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.109 
them for so for example this is the
Tarte<00:01:15.560> brush<00:01:16.560> and<00:01:17.009> he's<00:01:17.130> going<00:01:17.369> to<00:01:17.520> eyeliner

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
Tarte brush and he's going to eyeliner

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.899 
Tarte brush and he's going to eyeliner
brush<00:01:18.509> so<00:01:18.840> I<00:01:18.869> could<00:01:19.200> use<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:20.130> really<00:01:20.310> thin<00:01:20.700> one

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
brush so I could use the really thin one

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.899 
brush so I could use the really thin one
I<00:01:21.119> know<00:01:21.390> that<00:01:21.810> if<00:01:21.930> you<00:01:22.140> stick<00:01:22.979> it<00:01:23.159> in<00:01:23.340> like<00:01:23.610> this

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
I know that if you stick it in like this

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.469 
I know that if you stick it in like this
you<00:01:24.299> might<00:01:24.930> splay<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:26.490> bristles<00:01:26.970> but<00:01:27.090> if<00:01:27.360> you

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
you might splay the bristles but if you

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.210 
you might splay the bristles but if you
go<00:01:27.659> all<00:01:27.900> the<00:01:28.049> way<00:01:28.080> through<00:01:28.470> and<00:01:28.710> then<00:01:28.829> pull<00:01:29.070> it

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
go all the way through and then pull it

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.060 
go all the way through and then pull it
back<00:01:29.250> they<00:01:29.700> will<00:01:29.909> stay<00:01:30.270> like<00:01:31.020> this<00:01:31.049> and<00:01:31.500> that

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
back they will stay like this and that

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.270 
back they will stay like this and that
way<00:01:32.310> obviously<00:01:33.090> you<00:01:33.900> have<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.290> brush<00:01:34.590> right

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
way obviously you have the brush right

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.840 
way obviously you have the brush right
inside<00:01:35.880> it<00:01:36.119> that<00:01:36.900> way<00:01:37.110> you<00:01:37.170> can<00:01:37.680> put<00:01:38.159> it<00:01:38.340> in<00:01:38.670> a

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
inside it that way you can put it in a

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.440 
inside it that way you can put it in a
pot<00:01:39.210> and<00:01:39.689> your<00:01:40.409> brush<00:01:40.650> is<00:01:40.860> not<00:01:41.070> gonna<00:01:41.450> be

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
pot and your brush is not gonna be

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:48.020 
pot and your brush is not gonna be
ruined<00:01:43.250> for<00:01:44.250> example<00:01:44.759> this<00:01:44.939> one<00:01:45.270> I<00:01:46.189> think<00:01:47.189> this

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
ruined for example this one I think this

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.340 
ruined for example this one I think this
brush<00:01:48.390> guide<00:01:48.720> this<00:01:49.170> size<00:01:49.490> would<00:01:50.490> be<00:01:50.759> okay<00:01:51.350> you

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
brush guide this size would be okay you

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:58.670 
brush guide this size would be okay you
see<00:01:52.560> if<00:01:53.250> you<00:01:53.490> don't<00:01:53.700> want<00:01:53.880> to<00:01:54.090> ruin<00:01:55.369> your<00:01:57.680> brush

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
see if you don't want to ruin your brush

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.850 
see if you don't want to ruin your brush
you<00:01:58.710> could<00:01:59.159> put<00:01:59.460> something<00:02:00.299> like<00:02:00.810> a<00:02:01.320> lipstick

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
you could put something like a lipstick

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.139 
you could put something like a lipstick
in<00:02:02.070> front<00:02:02.460> of<00:02:02.670> it

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
in front of it

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.999 
in front of it
and<00:02:04.340> slide<00:02:05.340> it<00:02:05.549> down<00:02:05.820> or<00:02:06.560> you<00:02:07.560> just<00:02:07.740> raise

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
and slide it down or you just raise

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
explain the bristles but you pull it all

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:11.510
