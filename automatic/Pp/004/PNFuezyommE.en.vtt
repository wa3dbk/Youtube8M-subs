00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.629
 I will be back with a wurmkur 

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:08.429
 / the room change do it yourself 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.889
 whatever kind of nothing 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.660
 I have it in the exam time 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.780
 failed to clean up a room I 've 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.270
 I'm actually the reason for everything 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.250
 this mess here as if it were one 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.680
 hurricane hit I feel 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.730
 totally well and yes it belongs one 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.859
 change 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.599
 I do not want the room just something 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:33.360
 change but more neat 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:37.380
 make and make europe and europe more chic 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:41.280
 think we'll get together down there 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:43.500
 a little bit of work but that 's how I am with one 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.170
 blue garbage bag in which I really 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.450
 I will not throw anything in 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.850
 need because I have left and right 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:54.090
 some has to stand this total 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.800
 stuffed somehow pity me 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.360
 now open drawers and draw 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:03.600
 Just throw the whole garbage in 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:05.400
 and so on just like that out here 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.060
 I have a board in one 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:11.090
 treated wood board by ikea 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:13.850
 that I am now with white wood stain 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:16.650
 just going to paint it with it 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.810
 so it just fits the room 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.790
 I do not want to think that though 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.360
 I if I only once 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.360
 coat 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:38.259
 that will then hit the wall like this and here 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:40.570
 my beautiful picture is me 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:41.979
 recently bought at family and 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.840
 as you can see I do not know so 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:46.509
 right where the flowers should be but yes 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.610
 in the end I have a position 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:52.000
 found and these could be balls or 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:55.390
 I also bought wood from ikea 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.369
 here again a stock filing system 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.530
 what should be on the wall 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:01.810
 right there right next to mine 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.520
 computer and took screen with it me 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.259
 sort my whole documents better 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.880
 can and we can see I can leave mine 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:09.940
 friend rather because I hate 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:14.620
 this noise because that 's easy 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:16.330
 just against the wall and wanted 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.920
 I was a bit hardworking and I have them too 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:22.500
 labeled the same and my stuff 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:24.910
 arranged now on the other side 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.480
 that's just too much, but we 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.060
 can do that 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.500
 I just set myself with that 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:31.299
 continue sorting 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.489
 and here I have some insight 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:35.680
 Boxing so kopper boxes where here 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:37.150
 my nail polish stuff and everything 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.820
 little lohse is sorted 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:42.630
 Of course, I also wrote that on 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:46.150
 So do not stick such an adhesive 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:48.489
 dinger can remain on these 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.890
 I stick there and that I stick directly on 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:52.209
 the box is sorted everything 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.859
 and immediately labeled then I know 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:55.420
 namely what is in the box 

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:57.730
 without seeing you have to measure 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.829
 that comes in the second row and how 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.359
 you can see there you mean I mean 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:02.739
 Books above that in and out of the big one 

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:03.970
 cabinet is now in the small 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:07.109
 cabinet down though because the 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.109
 I have already read all books 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:18.680
 on we go with the order of my 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:20.450
 whole bastl stuff and the amount here 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.880
 I have the craft boxes of keeper 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:26.030
 brought and sometimes just like that 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:27.890
 the fab shop and the whole comes in 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:31.690
 the ex offers victory quite chic or 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:35.960
 I'm totally in love with the boxing 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:37.130
 then further deviates long 

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:39.110
 thought about it and I there yet 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:41.840
 I was really expensive 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:44.360
 there are alternatives but the sinziger 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.670
 and then as mom actually then 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:49.490
 quite alright 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:52.580
 I got this movie was lz 

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:54.380
 of these acrylic organizer boxes and me 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:56.200
 thought it was really funny and because of that 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:59.050
 things are so cute 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:03.950
 yes you can just own his own 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:04.610
 make quasi compile and fan 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:07.010
 wool 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:10.220
 so i designed it i found it 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:14.240
 just invite beautiful zippel here 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:16.610
 up until the board is still possible and so on 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:18.730
 then sit at the end so on the 

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:18.730
 page 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.910
 and that 's it, that's the whole room 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:29.060
 left, I still have my favorite 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:33.260
 nigers sorted and my uni column 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:36.080
 quasi sorted in folder again 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:37.010
 arranged and strung nicely and that 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.200
 is the result 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:41.210
 Here you can see the big one on the left again 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:43.370
 expert with my swing and right the 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:45.910
 small series with the things that I 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:49.010
 need and write again forest 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:50.630
 nothing great so we are here 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:51.980
 Again, before I picture 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:54.020
