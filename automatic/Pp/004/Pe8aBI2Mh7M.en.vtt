00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.279 
married to a champion jockey about time
I<00:00:27.869> think<00:00:28.490> it<00:00:29.490> was<00:00:29.609> heartbreaking<00:00:30.019> was<00:00:31.019> it<00:00:31.140> two

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
I think it was heartbreaking was it two

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.020 
I think it was heartbreaking was it two
years<00:00:31.470> ago<00:00:31.619> when<00:00:32.009> he<00:00:32.130> missed<00:00:32.309> out<00:00:32.550> and<00:00:32.790> the

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
years ago when he missed out and the

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.410 
years ago when he missed out and the
last<00:00:33.590> two<00:00:34.590> winners<00:00:35.070> but<00:00:35.940> this<00:00:36.030> is<00:00:36.210> brilliant

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
last two winners but this is brilliant

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.000 
last two winners but this is brilliant
now<00:00:36.719> it<00:00:36.960> seems<00:00:37.260> like<00:00:37.410> it's<00:00:37.590> come<00:00:37.739> at<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:37.920> right

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
now it seems like it's come at the right

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.580 
now it seems like it's come at the right
time<00:00:38.070> I<00:00:38.309> think<00:00:38.730> as<00:00:38.879> well<00:00:39.059> I<00:00:39.329> called<00:00:40.230> him<00:00:40.320> champ

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
time I think as well I called him champ

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.610 
time I think as well I called him champ
now<00:00:40.800> which<00:00:41.010> he<00:00:41.129> thinks<00:00:41.280> quite<00:00:41.579> funny<00:00:42.620> he

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
now which he thinks quite funny he

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.069 
now which he thinks quite funny he
doesn't<00:00:43.950> get<00:00:44.040> used<00:00:44.190> to<00:00:44.370> I<00:00:44.399> think<00:00:44.489> um<00:00:45.050> he's<00:00:46.050> a

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
doesn't get used to I think um he's a

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.690 
doesn't get used to I think um he's a
bit<00:00:46.289> shy<00:00:46.320> about<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.920> whole<00:00:47.039> thing<00:00:47.070> but<00:00:47.520> he's

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
bit shy about the whole thing but he's

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.020 
bit shy about the whole thing but he's
he<00:00:48.660> so<00:00:48.960> he<00:00:49.170> does<00:00:49.410> deserve<00:00:49.590> it<00:00:49.950> and<00:00:50.129> he's<00:00:50.340> it's

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
he so he does deserve it and he's it's

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.680 
he so he does deserve it and he's it's
coming<00:00:51.390> a<00:00:51.449> good<00:00:51.600> time<00:00:51.870> where<00:00:52.590> I<00:00:52.620> think

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:53.690 
coming a good time where I think

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.880 
coming a good time where I think
everything's<00:00:54.690> come<00:00:54.870> right<00:00:55.050> for<00:00:55.320> him<00:00:55.440> how<00:00:55.829> do

20<00:03:45.590> behind<00:03:45.890> with<00:03:46.130> I<00:03:46.340> think<00:03:47.239> six<00:03:47.450> weeks<00:03:47.690> to<00:03:47.840> go

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:48.019 
20 behind with I think six weeks to go

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:50.530 
20 behind with I think six weeks to go
and<00:03:48.680> I<00:03:48.739> got<00:03:48.890> beat<00:03:49.040> by<00:03:49.220> two<00:03:49.280> so<00:03:50.030> I<00:03:50.060> knew<00:03:50.269> it<00:03:50.390> could

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
and I got beat by two so I knew it could

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.020 
and I got beat by two so I knew it could
be<00:03:50.570> done<00:03:50.660> and<00:03:51.100> I<00:03:52.100> said<00:03:52.280> I've<00:03:52.400> the<00:03:52.519> hordes<00:03:52.880> he's

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:55.850 
no to catch up so it was probably the

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:57.220 
no to catch up so it was probably the
best<00:03:56.030> time<00:03:56.239> here<00:03:56.450> to<00:03:56.540> get<00:03:56.690> banned<00:03:56.870> if<00:03:57.050> you<00:03:57.140> were

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
best time here to get banned if you were

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:59.620 
best time here to get banned if you were
going<00:03:57.380> to<00:03:57.440> get<00:03:57.560> bad<00:03:57.790> and<00:03:58.790> what<00:03:59.000> about<00:03:59.090> then<00:03:59.450> the

00:03:59.620 --> 00:03:59.630 
going to get bad and what about then the

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:02.290 
going to get bad and what about then the
fact<00:03:59.810> that<00:03:59.930> the<00:04:00.560> ban<00:04:00.800> was<00:04:01.040> reciprocated<00:04:01.430> here

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:02.300 
fact that the ban was reciprocated here

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:05.949 
fact that the ban was reciprocated here
and<00:04:02.590> many<00:04:03.590> people<00:04:03.799> felt<00:04:04.130> that<00:04:04.310> an<00:04:04.700> i<00:04:05.150> saw<00:04:05.480> i<00:04:05.870> saw

and many people felt that an i saw i saw
the<00:04:06.290> incident<00:04:06.680> and<00:04:06.980> I<00:04:07.040> thought<00:04:07.280> what<00:04:07.459> it<00:04:07.519> was

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:07.640 
the incident and I thought what it was

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:11.320 
the incident and I thought what it was
lunacy<00:04:08.299> did<00:04:08.989> you<00:04:09.140> think<00:04:09.470> that<00:04:09.910> maybe<00:04:10.910> the

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:11.330 
lunacy did you think that maybe the

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:13.570 
lunacy did you think that maybe the
stewards<00:04:11.720> here<00:04:11.959> should<00:04:12.230> have<00:04:12.350> just<00:04:12.590> ignored

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:13.580

stewards here should have just ignored
us<00:04:14.030> I<00:04:14.709> think<00:04:15.709> there's<00:04:15.860> a<00:04:15.890> lot<00:04:16.010> of<00:04:16.039> politics

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:16.549 
us I think there's a lot of politics

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:18.580 
us I think there's a lot of politics
involved<00:04:16.850> myself<00:04:17.090> and

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
involved myself and

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:21.550 
involved myself and
