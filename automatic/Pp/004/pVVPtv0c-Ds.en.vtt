technique first of all we're now to grab
the<00:01:01.320> ball<00:01:01.640> it<00:01:02.640> would<00:01:02.760> actually<00:01:02.879> place<00:01:03.180> the

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:03.330 
the ball it would actually place the

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:04.939 
the ball it would actually place the
ball<00:01:03.480> on<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.690> floor<00:01:03.720> so<00:01:04.050> the<00:01:04.110> valve<00:01:04.409> is<00:01:04.589> facing

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
ball on the floor so the valve is facing

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.680 
ball on the floor so the valve is facing
toward<00:01:05.280> you<00:01:05.339> and<00:01:05.700> we<00:01:05.880> try<00:01:06.060> to<00:01:06.090> strike<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.570> ball

on<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.870> veldt<00:01:07.080> because<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.350> hardest<00:01:07.710> part

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
on the veldt because the hardest part

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.399 
on the veldt because the hardest part
part<00:01:08.280> of<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.430> ball<00:01:08.780> help<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.900> ball<00:01:10.080> travel

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
part of the ball help the ball travel

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:11.780 
part of the ball help the ball travel
far<00:01:10.590> through<00:01:10.800> the<00:01:10.860> air<00:01:11.130> and<00:01:11.400> makes<00:01:11.580> it<00:01:11.700> more

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
far through the air and makes it more

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.550 
far through the air and makes it more
difficult<00:01:11.940> for<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.360> goalkeeper<00:01:12.540> as<00:01:12.960> well<00:01:13.140> so

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
difficult for the goalkeeper as well so

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:14.810 
difficult for the goalkeeper as well so
when<00:01:13.680> he<00:01:13.740> places<00:01:13.950> it<00:01:14.159> down<00:01:14.340> as<00:01:14.520> well<00:01:14.700> you

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
when he places it down as well you

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.010 
when he places it down as well you
mentioned<00:01:15.270> sank<00:01:15.450> about<00:01:15.570> obviously<00:01:15.990> a

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
mentioned sank about obviously a

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.840 
mentioned sank about obviously a
different<00:01:16.350> as<00:01:16.409> well<00:01:16.530> before<00:01:16.710> climbing<00:01:17.070> so<00:01:17.340> he

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
different as well before climbing so he

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.399 
different as well before climbing so he
like<00:01:18.030> will<00:01:18.210> place<00:01:18.390> a<00:01:18.420> divot<00:01:18.870> place<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.229> ball

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
like will place a divot place the ball

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.980 
like will place a divot place the ball
in<00:01:19.440> it<00:01:19.880> and<00:01:20.880> then<00:01:21.030> as<00:01:21.240> he<00:01:21.360> strikes<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.780> ball

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
in it and then as he strikes the ball

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.750 
in it and then as he strikes the ball
because<00:01:22.290> there's<00:01:22.440> a<00:01:22.500> little<00:01:22.650> lip<00:01:22.950> that<00:01:23.490> allows

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:23.760 
because there's a little lip that allows

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.670 
because there's a little lip that allows
the<00:01:23.909> balls<00:01:24.120> to<00:01:24.300> really<00:01:24.570> punch<00:01:25.080> through<00:01:25.380> and

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
the balls to really punch through and

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.350 
the balls to really punch through and
then<00:01:25.829> get<00:01:26.130> a<00:01:26.159> bit<00:01:26.399> more<00:01:26.579> of<00:01:26.700> a<00:01:26.820> dip<00:01:26.969> on<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.210> ball

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
then get a bit more of a dip on the ball

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.469 
then get a bit more of a dip on the ball
again<00:01:27.600> so<00:01:28.049> we're<00:01:28.409> in<00:01:28.500> that<00:01:28.530> position<00:01:28.950> there

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479 
again so we're in that position there

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:33.440 
again so we're in that position there
so<00:01:30.479> I've<00:01:30.600> Val<00:01:30.840> facing<00:01:31.229> towards<00:01:31.590> us<00:01:32.240> he<00:01:33.240> then

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
so I've Val facing towards us he then

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.350 
so I've Val facing towards us he then
takes<00:01:33.689> a<00:01:33.930> certain<00:01:34.229> amount<00:01:34.409> of<00:01:34.530> steps<00:01:34.799> back<00:01:35.360> he

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
takes a certain amount of steps back he

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.760 
takes a certain amount of steps back he
sets<00:01:36.659> himself<00:01:36.869> and<00:01:37.229> when<00:01:37.320> he<00:01:37.350> does<00:01:37.530> set

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
sets himself and when he does set

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.550 
sets himself and when he does set
himself<00:01:37.890> it's<00:01:38.759> pretty<00:01:39.299> much<00:01:39.600> straight<00:01:40.170> on<00:01:40.409> to

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
himself it's pretty much straight on to

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.020 
himself it's pretty much straight on to
where<00:01:40.710> he<00:01:40.799> wants<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.100> ball<00:01:41.130> to<00:01:41.399> go<00:01:41.579> so<00:01:41.820> if<00:01:41.939> I

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
where he wants the ball to go so if I

post there I'm actually bang straight

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.899 
post there I'm actually bang straight
behind<00:01:45.899> it<00:01:46.079> here<00:01:46.259> quite<00:01:46.950> a<00:01:46.979> hard<00:01:47.189> technique<00:01:47.789> to

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
behind it here quite a hard technique to

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.190 
behind it here quite a hard technique to
master<00:01:48.090> and<00:01:48.390> it<00:01:48.420> feels<00:01:48.630> quite<00:01:48.780> uncomfortable

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
master and it feels quite uncomfortable

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.389 
master and it feels quite uncomfortable
when<00:01:49.469> you're<00:01:49.560> about<00:01:49.710> to<00:01:49.890> strike<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.250> ball

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
when you're about to strike the ball

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.340 
when you're about to strike the ball
because<00:01:50.700> naturally<00:01:51.180> we<00:01:51.659> like<00:01:51.930> having<00:01:52.200> a

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
because naturally we like having a

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.200 
because naturally we like having a
little<00:01:52.560> bit<00:01:52.740> of<00:01:52.859> an<00:01:52.920> angle<00:01:53.100> because<00:01:53.939> then<00:01:54.119> we

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
little bit of an angle because then we

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.760 
little bit of an angle because then we
could<00:01:54.329> obviously<00:01:54.689> our<00:01:54.930> body<00:01:55.109> shake<00:01:55.409> and<00:01:55.649> help

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
could obviously our body shake and help

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.709 
could obviously our body shake and help
us<00:01:55.920> to<00:01:56.009> strike<00:01:56.219> the<00:01:56.340> ball<00:01:56.490> but<00:01:57.090> he<00:01:57.119> stands<00:01:57.570> by

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
us to strike the ball but he stands by

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.499 
us to strike the ball but he stands by
really<00:01:58.109> behind<00:01:58.469> it<00:01:58.649> as<00:01:59.340> he<00:01:59.880> runs<00:02:00.060> up<00:02:00.270> to<00:02:00.390> the
