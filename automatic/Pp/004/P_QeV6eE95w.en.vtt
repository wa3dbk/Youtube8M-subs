00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
and I thought for a few seconds that

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:20.690 
and I thought for a few seconds that
rusev<00:03:19.829> was<00:03:20.010> actually<00:03:20.250> going<00:03:20.340> to<00:03:20.430> get<00:03:20.519> beat

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
because he had Rousseff on the ropes

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.080 
because he had Rousseff on the ropes
rusev<00:03:22.410> was<00:03:22.560> actually<00:03:22.859> down<00:03:23.069> on<00:03:23.340> the<00:03:23.459> mat<00:03:23.670> like

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:03.720 
the w feels like that they have to give

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:05.270 
the w feels like that they have to give
less<00:06:03.900> of<00:06:03.930> an<00:06:04.170> effort<00:06:04.350> now<00:06:04.590> I<00:06:04.620> mean<00:06:04.890> like<00:06:05.190> I<00:06:05.250> said

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:05.280 
less of an effort now I mean like I said

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:06.860 
less of an effort now I mean like I said
I'm<00:06:05.520> happy<00:06:05.730> that<00:06:05.820> John<00:06:06.060> seems<00:06:06.300> champion<00:06:06.780> but

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:06.870 
I'm happy that John seems champion but

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:07.970 
I'm happy that John seems champion but
he's<00:06:06.960> not<00:06:07.050> gonna<00:06:07.170> be<00:06:07.320> champion<00:06:07.650> for<00:06:07.770> a<00:06:07.800> long

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:07.980 
he's not gonna be champion for a long

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:09.290 
he's not gonna be champion for a long
time<00:06:08.220> we<00:06:08.370> already<00:06:08.610> know<00:06:08.730> this<00:06:08.850> brought<00:06:09.090> less

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:09.300 
time we already know this brought less

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:10.490 
time we already know this brought less
it's<00:06:09.420> going<00:06:09.540> to<00:06:09.600> become<00:06:09.690> the<00:06:09.810> next<00:06:09.900> champion

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:10.500 
it's going to become the next champion

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:13.010 
it's going to become the next champion
unless<00:06:10.980> the<00:06:11.070> ww<00:06:11.550> decides<00:06:11.790> to<00:06:11.880> serve<00:06:12.030> us<00:06:12.660> where

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:13.020 
unless the ww decides to serve us where

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:15.710 
unless the ww decides to serve us where
of<00:06:13.080> us<00:06:13.200> but<00:06:13.740> the<00:06:14.640> PIP<00:06:14.820> you<00:06:14.970> started<00:06:15.450> with<00:06:15.600> an

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:15.720 
of us but the PIP you started with an

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:17.780 
of us but the PIP you started with an
extreme<00:06:16.200> high<00:06:16.470> and<00:06:16.800> then<00:06:16.920> ended<00:06:17.310> with<00:06:17.490> with<00:06:17.760> a

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:17.790 
extreme high and then ended with with a

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:19.970 
extreme high and then ended with with a
low<00:06:18.120> as<00:06:18.390> it<00:06:18.450> concerns<00:06:19.170> the<00:06:19.560> whole

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:19.980 
low as it concerns the whole

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:21.590 
low as it concerns the whole
pay-per-view<00:06:20.490> I<00:06:20.520> mean<00:06:20.730> it<00:06:20.940> didn't<00:06:21.330> end<00:06:21.420> with<00:06:21.540> a

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:21.600 
pay-per-view I mean it didn't end with a

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:22.820 
pay-per-view I mean it didn't end with a
low<00:06:21.750> at<00:06:21.900> Jhansi<00:06:22.260> to<00:06:22.350> become<00:06:22.560> a<00:06:22.590> champion

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:22.830 
low at Jhansi to become a champion

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:24.260 
low at Jhansi to become a champion
although<00:06:23.220> a<00:06:23.250> lot<00:06:23.400> of<00:06:23.460> you<00:06:23.610> people<00:06:23.760> say<00:06:24.120> that

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:24.270 
although a lot of you people say that

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:26.420 
although a lot of you people say that
but<00:06:24.750> it<00:06:24.840> just<00:06:25.020> I<00:06:25.260> don't<00:06:25.320> know<00:06:25.470> it<00:06:25.650> had<00:06:26.250> its

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:26.430 
but it just I don't know it had its

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:28.250 
but it just I don't know it had its
moments<00:06:26.550> but<00:06:27.060> there<00:06:27.480> are<00:06:27.600> very<00:06:27.780> few<00:06:27.870> and<00:06:28.230> far

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:28.260 
moments but there are very few and far

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:29.780 
moments but there are very few and far
between<00:06:28.440> like<00:06:28.860> I<00:06:28.920> said<00:06:29.070> expected<00:06:29.550> a<00:06:29.610> lot<00:06:29.730> more

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:29.790 
between like I said expected a lot more

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:31.910 
between like I said expected a lot more
from<00:06:30.420> money<00:06:30.720> in<00:06:30.840> the<00:06:30.930> bank<00:06:31.170> tonight<00:06:31.350> so<00:06:31.650> on<00:06:31.860> a

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:31.920 
from money in the bank tonight so on a

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:33.830 
from money in the bank tonight so on a
scale<00:06:32.400> of<00:06:32.550> 10<00:06:32.940> I<00:06:32.970> anything<00:06:33.390> I<00:06:33.510> would<00:06:33.630> give<00:06:33.750> it

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:33.840 
scale of 10 I anything I would give it

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:35.960 
scale of 10 I anything I would give it
this<00:06:33.930> reading<00:06:34.290> but<00:06:34.410> I'd<00:06:34.650> have<00:06:34.830> to<00:06:34.950> give<00:06:35.070> it<00:06:35.250> six

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:35.970 
this reading but I'd have to give it six

00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:38.510 
this reading but I'd have to give it six
out<00:06:36.120> of<00:06:36.150> 10<00:06:36.479> and<00:06:36.630> that's<00:06:36.780> just<00:06:36.930> being<00:06:37.169> nice<00:06:37.440> I<00:06:37.800> I

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:38.520 
out of 10 and that's just being nice I I

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:40.559 
out of 10 and that's just being nice I I
mean<00:06:39.000> the<00:06:39.240> outcomes<00:06:39.630> in

00:06:40.559 --> 00:06:40.569 
mean the outcomes in

00:06:40.569 --> 00:06:42.689 
mean the outcomes in
Ziggler<00:06:40.809> should<00:06:40.839> have<00:06:41.050> one<00:06:41.369> Cesaro<00:06:42.369> should

00:06:42.689 --> 00:06:42.699 
Ziggler should have one Cesaro should

00:06:42.699 --> 00:06:44.040 
Ziggler should have one Cesaro should
have<00:06:42.789> one<00:06:42.969> but<00:06:43.179> we<00:06:43.270> all<00:06:43.360> know<00:06:43.479> Cena<00:06:43.749> was<00:06:43.869> gonna

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:44.050 
have one but we all know Cena was gonna

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:45.989 
have one but we all know Cena was gonna
win<00:06:44.139> anyways<00:06:44.409> and<00:06:44.770> I<00:06:45.159> think<00:06:45.309> Naomi<00:06:45.849> should

00:06:45.989 --> 00:06:45.999 
win anyways and I think Naomi should

00:06:45.999 --> 00:06:47.369 
win anyways and I think Naomi should
probably<00:06:46.629> become<00:06:46.839> the<00:06:46.929> new<00:06:47.050> Divas<00:06:47.080> Champion

00:06:47.369 --> 00:06:47.379 
probably become the new Divas Champion

00:06:47.379 --> 00:06:49.199 
probably become the new Divas Champion
but<00:06:47.889> a<00:06:48.009> lot<00:06:48.249> of<00:06:48.279> things<00:06:48.399> didn't<00:06:48.669> go<00:06:48.789> my<00:06:48.819> way<00:06:48.969> and

00:06:49.199 --> 00:06:49.209 
but a lot of things didn't go my way and

00:06:49.209 --> 00:06:51.149 
but a lot of things didn't go my way and
you<00:06:49.569> know<00:06:49.659> I<00:06:49.689> had<00:06:49.959> high<00:06:50.349> expectations<00:06:50.649> but

00:06:51.149 --> 00:06:51.159 
you know I had high expectations but

00:06:51.159 --> 00:06:53.429 
you know I had high expectations but
they<00:06:51.369> were<00:06:51.429> not<00:06:51.669> met<00:06:51.939> tonight<00:06:52.209> like<00:06:53.139> I<00:06:53.229> said<00:06:53.289> I
