00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:07.169
 good by Viktorovich please as you 

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:09.780
 assess the situation with Ukraine Ukraine 

00:00:07.169 --> 00:00:11.910
 the same was if we take historical and 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.799
 independent state and part 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.590
 some European empires part 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.780
 powerful soviet union and that's what 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.230
 turned out with Ukraine now it is part 

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.360
 what 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.700
 or she herself did not think so 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.830
 they are as independent as they are about 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.720
 the menu tells but if you follow 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.850
 some events are constantly what 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.680
 called soiled eyes especially 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:33.449
 if political events occur 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:36.089
 various interpretations of assessment 

00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:38.910
 a lot of emotions for which the essence is lost 

00:00:36.089 --> 00:00:40.469
 let's take the political analogy 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.129
 go to sports then everything will be 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:46.109
 it is clear that I think that hundreds of millions 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.960
 people probably billions even people in 

00:00:46.109 --> 00:00:51.749
 world loves grandson ta game where twenty two 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:55.199
 healthy men chase one ball across the field 

00:00:51.749 --> 00:00:57.499
 I try to hammer it in each otherâ€™s gates 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:02.280
 this game has its own rules there are players 

00:00:57.499 --> 00:01:04.980
 there is a ball and players while playing this 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.370
 the ball mercilessly kick hit from all sides 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:10.200
 they make him extremely sick 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:12.150
 in some situations they might hit 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.910
 according to him that he either blown away or burst 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.920
 I want to say that between the ball and 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:19.050
 players have a fundamental difference 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.200
 players decide when to apply 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:24.630
 strike where they move how to pass 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.240
 they determine their actions meiji 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.850
 Leaves where to kill him no one 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.430
 asks whether he likes whether he likes 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.680
 what gate would he want to fly into 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.540
 In general, that he wants a sword none of 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.690
 football players in this matter are not at all 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:42.600
 puzzled he just hits this sword 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:48.060
 so in politics you can be either 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:50.280
 the player or sword of the third is not given in 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.530
 today's situation with all due respect to 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.110
 Ukraine to the Ukrainian people who I 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:59.400
 I consider it part of the great Russian people 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:02.040
 Ukraine is a ball is a geopolitical ball 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:04.740
 which geopolitical players beat with 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.770
 different sides directing him to different 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:10.619
 sides trying to score goals to each other 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:13.950
 but it was not always quite recently before 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:17.080
 91 years old Ukraine was games 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:19.090
 she was part of the great 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.670
 a powerful player called soviet 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:24.400
 Russian Union 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:26.260
 civilization Russian civilization before 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.910
 Ukraine was part of the Russian 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:31.030
 empire it was also a powerful player 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:32.980
 remember how Ukraine played then 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:37.090
 the forty-fifth year the goal was scored right up to 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.810
 Berlin then sent Gagarin to 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.720
 space 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:43.690
 it was a great beautiful goal 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.430
 which of its kind was probably more 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:49.260
 beautiful than the goals that are forgotten 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:52.750
 scored saw and what happened in the end 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:56.049
 Today Ukraine is not a player is a subject 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:59.069
 games are a ball and it is unfortunately very 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:03:02.879
 clearly today when 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:06.239
 all sorts of puppet pseudo politicians 

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:08.769
 politicians brought Ukraine to split and 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:11.709
 there is a question of coexistence 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:15.329
 Ukrainian state just need 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:16.750
 recall that Ukraine was a player and 

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:19.269
 become again 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.459
 the player is not too difficult to need 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:22.870
 unite on the basis of a customs union 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:25.750
 Eurasian Union 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.400
 because today's Russia for all 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:31.359
 problems that exist russia 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:33.760
 nobody kicks like a ball can 

00:03:31.359 --> 00:03:36.940
 The 90s kicked now 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:39.780
 it turns out we become a player again 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:42.790
 already become a player we will play better 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.799
 we will give quality passes and 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.989
 we will score goals from farther 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:48.730
 distance if Ukraine will be together with 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:50.709
 us if Belarus will be with us 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:53.919
 if with us being shards of Russian 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:56.560
 civilizations so the choice of Ukraine is not so 

00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:59.290
 so big not so big either 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:02.230
 remain the sword that will 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:06.099
 kick without asking reluctance 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:09.230
 the ball either become a player and what else 

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:12.830
 I would like to separately note here 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:13.970
 being a sword without a player to 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:16.669
 join him 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:19.459
 the ball can never become a player 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:21.380
 separate to not speak 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:23.750
 Western partners as if they did not press 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:25.790
 hands as if did not show respect 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:27.919
 they will never consider Ukraine 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:30.350
 equal to themselves they understand only language 

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:32.780
 forces of another language in politics in general 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:35.600
 no one therefore understands 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.990
 everything looks beautiful everything in the game to everything 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:39.110
 field 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:40.669
 all in the wild all run psyche 22 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:43.039
 man runs and the ball too 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:45.979
 moves runs but only in politics 

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:49.220
 you had no one to explain the rules and 

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:52.370
 these are 22 people in geopolitics of course 

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:54.860
 not 22 less than 23 centers of power they 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:56.960
 move as they need as they 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:59.330
 I want it and the ball goes where it goes 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:02.720
 sent here actually the essence 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:05.630
 so Ukraine today has one choice 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:09.979
 either become a player again with Russia 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:12.050
 either you remain a sword but apparently so 

00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:15.289
 a sword that soon stutters dudu and stupid 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:18.200
 torn with great risk in perspective 

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:20.900
 unfortunately this ball can experience 

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:23.840
 such overloads that will leave it all 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:26.060
 air and the fate of the swords that can not 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:28.880
 play football she is generally sad them 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:31.010
 just throwing away i wish that 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:33.220
 dear citizens of Ukraine thought 

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:33.220
 above this
