once<00:00:52.770> we<00:00:52.920> start<00:00:52.980> mining<00:00:53.850> this<00:00:53.969> clay<00:00:54.300> location

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
once we start mining this clay location

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.010 
once we start mining this clay location
here<00:00:55.850> you'll<00:00:56.850> notice<00:00:57.210> that<00:00:57.329> I<00:00:57.390> mined<00:00:57.690> it<00:00:57.809> very

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.160 
here you'll notice that I mined it very
fast<00:00:58.410> and<00:00:58.739> since<00:00:59.550> it's<00:00:59.789> fast<00:01:00.120> it's<00:01:00.510> a<00:01:00.690> fast<00:01:00.960> way

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
fast and since it's fast it's a fast way

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.160 
fast and since it's fast it's a fast way
of<00:01:01.199> making<00:01:01.649> money<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:02.340> so<00:01:03.210> you<00:01:03.270> can<00:01:03.660> get<00:01:03.780> 28

and funny thing about this is that I
actually<00:01:20.620> noticed<00:01:21.280> that<00:01:21.430> this<00:01:21.550> guy<00:01:21.790> was<00:01:22.120> an

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
a high enough mining level to take it

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.160

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
checking thing as I call it

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.330 
checking thing as I call it
let's<00:01:55.270> see<00:01:55.509> click<00:01:56.140> on<00:01:56.290> the<00:01:56.380> items<00:01:56.740> you<00:01:57.040> click

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:57.340 
let's see click on the items you click

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:00.390 
let's see click on the items you click
your<00:01:57.640> clay<00:01:57.910> press<00:01:58.270> all<00:01:58.509> and<00:01:58.869> wow<00:01:59.470> look<00:02:00.250> at<00:02:00.280> that

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:00.400 
your clay press all and wow look at that

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.520 
your clay press all and wow look at that
twelve<00:02:01.300> thousand<00:02:01.869> nine<00:02:01.990> hundred<00:02:02.290> ninety<00:02:02.500> two

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
twelve thousand nine hundred ninety two

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.450 
twelve thousand nine hundred ninety two
so<00:02:02.920> thirteen<00:02:03.700> thousand<00:02:04.570> dollars<00:02:04.750> in<00:02:05.560> about

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:06.460 
so thirteen thousand dollars in about

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:12.510 
so thirteen thousand dollars in about
two<00:02:07.240> minutes<00:02:07.450> as<00:02:08.009> not<00:02:09.009> bad<00:02:10.950> now<00:02:11.950> we<00:02:12.010> can<00:02:12.280> do<00:02:12.400> the

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
two minutes as not bad now we can do the

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.820 
two minutes as not bad now we can do the
math<00:02:12.730> and<00:02:13.030> we<00:02:13.450> notice<00:02:13.780> that<00:02:13.810> each<00:02:14.230> clay<00:02:14.620> piece

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
math and we notice that each clay piece

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.070 
math and we notice that each clay piece
is<00:02:15.010> four<00:02:15.220> hundred<00:02:15.250> sixty<00:02:15.760> four<00:02:15.940> apiece<00:02:16.330> so<00:02:16.959> we

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
is four hundred sixty four apiece so we

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.479 
is four hundred sixty four apiece so we
multiply<00:02:17.500> that<00:02:17.650> by<00:02:17.709> the<00:02:17.830> total<00:02:18.070> number<00:02:18.459> of

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:18.489 
multiply that by the total number of

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:21.420 
multiply that by the total number of
inventory<00:02:19.090> spaces<00:02:19.570> and<00:02:19.750> our<00:02:20.500> sixty<00:02:21.010> minutes

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
inventory spaces and our sixty minutes

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:22.979 
inventory spaces and our sixty minutes
and<00:02:21.550> divide<00:02:22.060> that<00:02:22.209> by<00:02:22.269> two<00:02:22.420> minutes<00:02:22.750> because

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
and divide that by two minutes because

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:25.110 
and divide that by two minutes because
it<00:02:23.230> takes<00:02:23.500> it<00:02:23.739> two<00:02:24.010> minutes<00:02:24.340> and<00:02:24.489> you<00:02:24.970> get

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
it takes it two minutes and you get

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.550 
it takes it two minutes and you get
about<00:02:25.300> four<00:02:25.570> hundred<00:02:25.630> thousand<00:02:26.140> dollars<00:02:26.410> each

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
about four hundred thousand dollars each

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:32.039 
about four hundred thousand dollars each
time<00:02:30.060> since<00:02:31.060> we're<00:02:31.239> finished<00:02:31.540> with<00:02:31.630> that<00:02:31.810> now

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:32.049 
time since we're finished with that now

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:33.300 
time since we're finished with that now
we<00:02:32.080> can<00:02:32.290> move<00:02:32.350> on<00:02:32.530> to<00:02:32.560> the<00:02:32.739> second<00:02:33.040> part<00:02:33.190> of<00:02:33.220> the

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
we can move on to the second part of the

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.630 
we can move on to the second part of the

down<00:02:56.950> oak<00:02:57.220> it's<00:02:57.850> usually<00:02:58.030> the<00:02:58.390> big<00:02:58.570> tall<00:02:58.840> trees

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
down oak it's usually the big tall trees

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.910 
down oak it's usually the big tall trees
that<00:02:59.500> span<00:02:59.830> out<00:03:00.070> wide<00:03:00.519> with<00:03:00.850> their<00:03:01.030> leaves<00:03:01.209> and

that span out wide with their leaves and

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.500 
that span out wide with their leaves and
the<00:03:02.920> thing<00:03:03.100> about<00:03:03.310> oak<00:03:03.549> trees<00:03:03.880> is<00:03:04.090> that<00:03:04.150> they

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
the thing about oak trees is that they

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.340 
the thing about oak trees is that they
may<00:03:04.720> not<00:03:05.040> cost<00:03:06.040> very<00:03:06.459> much<00:03:06.549> oak<00:03:07.360> logs<00:03:07.720> sorry

these logs on hand and after about three
four<00:03:36.120> hundred<00:03:36.420> logs<00:03:36.629> you<00:03:37.349> can<00:03:37.379> get<00:03:37.769> quite<00:03:38.249> a

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
four hundred logs you can get quite a

this up just a little bit so we can get
to<00:03:42.030> the<00:03:42.239> end

now that we've finished gathering all 28

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.330 
now that we've finished gathering all 28
logs<00:03:54.870> it's<00:03:55.170> time<00:03:55.350> to<00:03:55.500> check<00:03:55.650> the<00:03:55.710> price<00:03:56.070> and

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
logs it's time to check the price and

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:58.430 
logs it's time to check the price and
you<00:03:56.880> do<00:03:57.000> this<00:03:57.120> in<00:03:57.180> your<00:03:57.480> inventory<00:03:57.810> with<00:03:58.320> the

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
you do this in your inventory with the

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.400 
you do this in your inventory with the
little<00:03:58.710> cash<00:03:59.070> bag<00:03:59.460> thing<00:03:59.880> so<00:04:00.660> what<00:04:01.080> I<00:04:01.110> can<00:04:01.290> do

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
little cash bag thing so what I can do

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.740 
little cash bag thing so what I can do
is<00:04:01.530> I<00:04:01.620> drag<00:04:01.860> the<00:04:02.010> log<00:04:02.190> in<00:04:02.400> here<00:04:02.640> and<00:04:02.820> seemed

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
is I drag the log in here and seemed

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.020 
is I drag the log in here and seemed
like<00:04:03.900> there<00:04:04.080> were<00:04:04.170> 76<00:04:04.830> apiece

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
like there were 76 apiece

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.780 
like there were 76 apiece
a<00:04:06.060> total<00:04:06.660> of<00:04:06.720> two<00:04:06.960> thousand<00:04:07.680> two<00:04:08.370> thousand

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
a total of two thousand two thousand

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.690 
a total of two thousand two thousand
dollars<00:04:09.090> which<00:04:09.390> hey<00:04:10.230> it's<00:04:10.530> it's<00:04:10.860> a<00:04:11.040> log<00:04:11.250> so

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
dollars which hey it's it's a log so

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.270 
dollars which hey it's it's a log so
it's<00:04:11.880> not<00:04:12.090> going<00:04:12.270> to<00:04:12.330> get<00:04:12.390> you<00:04:12.540> that<00:04:12.690> much<00:04:13.280> now

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
it's not going to get you that much now

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.220 
it's not going to get you that much now
we<00:04:14.340> can<00:04:14.610> do<00:04:14.700> the<00:04:14.820> math<00:04:15.000> again<00:04:15.180> then<00:04:15.750> we<00:04:15.900> can<00:04:16.049> see

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:16.230 
we can do the math again then we can see

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:18.320 
we can do the math again then we can see
that<00:04:16.260> each<00:04:16.590> log<00:04:16.859> is<00:04:17.070> seventy<00:04:17.370> six<00:04:17.640> so<00:04:18.299> you

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:18.330 
that each log is seventy six so you

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:20.120 
that each log is seventy six so you
