00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:18.960
 come now 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.150
 she is fine too 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:23.900
 we go to the street 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.949
 we represent for ourselves whether with or without union whether with or without 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:31.680
 It does not matter if it is not just e10 or 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.250
 integrated Zurich 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.250
 and then she makes out of our goal skill 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.570

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:41.660
 always said 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.190
 the same as the aging one 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.840
 in the ladies single 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.040
 and that all reminds 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.530
 40 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.730
 both riders want the cup 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.750
 then together 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.080
 continue for 12 hours 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.080
 be the last one 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.150
 Whimsical 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.820
 but you have seen 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.820
 he just wanted to be approached for money 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.490
 we change that 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.820
 Mannheim RPO

 Citizens 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.380
 so 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.380
 we wanted, so to speak 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.520
 just like Nico Wendt for the location 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.900

 us near Central Park 

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:50.329
 I should let him out the court 

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:53.609
 because the animals regularly show that he is different too 

00:02:54.649 --> 00:02:57.979
 No jobs secure no matter who guess 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:06.069
