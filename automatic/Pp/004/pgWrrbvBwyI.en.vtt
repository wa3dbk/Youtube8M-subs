00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.339 
being the ash tree red frame I just like
the<00:00:26.189> design<00:00:26.490> of<00:00:26.670> this<00:00:26.789> kit<00:00:27.240> the<00:00:27.660> design<00:00:27.960> of<00:00:28.109> 0

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
the design of this kit the design of 0

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.050 
the design of this kit the design of 0
and<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:29.039> way<00:00:29.189> it<00:00:29.279> was<00:00:29.400> constructed<00:00:29.939> was

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
and the way it was constructed was

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.240 
and the way it was constructed was
pretty<00:00:30.630> nice<00:00:30.840> although<00:00:31.140> there<00:00:32.040> are<00:00:32.130> a<00:00:32.160> few

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
pretty nice although there are a few

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.850 
pretty nice although there are a few

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.160 
things that I will say I will complain
about<00:00:35.040> later<00:00:35.399> on<00:00:35.610> and<00:00:35.969> you'll<00:00:36.120> obviously<00:00:36.660> hear

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
about later on and you'll obviously hear

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.360 
about later on and you'll obviously hear
it<00:00:37.290> but<00:00:38.540> here<00:00:39.540> we<00:00:39.629> have<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:39.899> box<00:00:40.079> itself<00:00:40.440> with

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
it but here we have the box itself with

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.119 
it but here we have the box itself with
a<00:00:41.399> nice<00:00:41.730> picture<00:00:42.149> of<00:00:42.450> zero<00:00:43.170> except<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:43.739> wings

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
a nice picture of zero except the wings

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.940 
a nice picture of zero except the wings
are<00:00:44.370> kind<00:00:45.149> of<00:00:45.239> overdone<00:00:45.780> on<00:00:46.050> this<00:00:46.649> picture

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
are kind of overdone on this picture

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.380 
are kind of overdone on this picture
they<00:00:47.100> don't<00:00:47.309> really<00:00:47.430> reflect<00:00:47.640> what<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.180> wings

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
they don't really reflect what the wings

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.810 
they don't really reflect what the wings
look<00:00:48.570> like<00:00:48.840> as<00:00:49.590> itself<00:00:50.100> but<00:00:50.309> it's<00:00:50.610> just

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
look like as itself but it's just

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.049 
look like as itself but it's just
concept<00:00:51.239> art<00:00:51.420> so<00:00:51.629> I'll<00:00:51.719> forget<00:00:52.649> it<00:00:52.969> we<00:00:53.969> have

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
concept art so I'll forget it we have

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.910 
concept art so I'll forget it we have
our<00:00:54.270> perfect<00:00:54.600> grade<00:00:54.750> at<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:54.989> bottom<00:00:55.289> with

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
our perfect grade at the bottom with

our perfect grade at the bottom with
some<00:00:56.420> information<00:00:57.420> about<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:58.079> mole<00:00:58.320> suit<00:00:58.590> and

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
didn't do that to mine because I was

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.880 
didn't do that to mine because I was
just<00:01:23.280> ready<00:01:23.460> to<00:01:23.549> finish<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:23.970> thing<00:01:24.710> on<00:01:25.710> both

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
and going up to the tourist ability yeah

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:18.490 
and going up to the tourist ability yeah
you<00:02:17.819> got<00:02:18.150> it

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
you got it

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.600 
you got it
but<00:02:19.500> eventually<00:02:19.739> it<00:02:19.980> brings<00:02:20.190> you<00:02:20.310> over<00:02:20.340> two

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
but eventually it brings you over two

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.559 
but eventually it brings you over two
legs<00:02:21.530> then<00:02:22.530> into<00:02:22.769> the<00:02:22.890> torso<00:02:23.299> and<00:02:24.299> with<00:02:24.480> the

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
legs then into the torso and with the

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:28.130 
legs then into the torso and with the
torso<00:02:24.810> I<00:02:24.870> need<00:02:25.019> to<00:02:25.110> save<00:02:25.319> them<00:02:26.299> that's<00:02:27.299> okay<00:02:27.540> it

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
torso I need to save them that's okay it

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.059 
torso I need to save them that's okay it
has<00:02:28.340> two<00:02:29.340> points<00:02:29.730> where<00:02:30.299> it<00:02:30.569> lights<00:02:31.410> up<00:02:31.620> and

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
has two points where it lights up and

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:34.940 
has two points where it lights up and
it's<00:02:32.459> both<00:02:32.670> in<00:02:32.880> the<00:02:32.970> torso<00:02:33.390> and<00:02:33.630> the<00:02:33.900> head<00:02:34.170> unit

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
it's both in the torso and the head unit

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.559 
it's both in the torso and the head unit
and<00:02:35.160> all<00:02:35.549> of<00:02:35.670> them<00:02:35.849> are<00:02:35.940> connected<00:02:36.120> to<00:02:36.450> the

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
and all of them are connected to the

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:40.699 
and all of them are connected to the
same<00:02:37.760> battery<00:02:38.760> pack<00:02:39.030> and<00:02:40.019> it's<00:02:40.170> all<00:02:40.319> by<00:02:40.440> wires

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
same battery pack and it's all by wires

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:43.339 
same battery pack and it's all by wires
so<00:02:41.160> you<00:02:41.430> have<00:02:42.360> a<00:02:42.390> limited<00:02:42.660> number<00:02:42.780> of<00:02:42.930> wires<00:02:43.140> to

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:43.349 
so you have a limited number of wires to

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:46.039 
so you have a limited number of wires to
do<00:02:43.470> this<00:02:43.620> and<00:02:43.830> it<00:02:44.130> can<00:02:44.390> the<00:02:45.390> process<00:02:45.810> of<00:02:45.930> doing

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:46.049 
do this and it can the process of doing

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:48.640 
do this and it can the process of doing
it<00:02:46.230> can<00:02:46.380> actually<00:02:46.530> get<00:02:46.799> quite<00:02:47.130> annoying<00:02:47.579> and

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
it can actually get quite annoying and

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.500 
it can actually get quite annoying and
the<00:02:49.650> wire<00:02:49.920> this<00:02:50.190> connection<00:02:50.700> can<00:02:50.880> be<00:02:50.910> cut<00:02:51.269> with

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
the wire this connection can be cut with

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.560 
the wire this connection can be cut with
the<00:02:51.690> slightest<00:02:52.500> of<00:02:52.680> movement<00:02:53.070> like<00:02:53.760> I<00:02:53.910> I<00:02:54.180> had

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
the slightest of movement like I I had

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.559 
the slightest of movement like I I had
the<00:02:54.600> chest<00:02:55.530> unit<00:02:55.829> lighting<00:02:56.160> up<00:02:56.340> but<00:02:56.670> now<00:02:57.450> it

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
the chest unit lighting up but now it

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:00.170 
the chest unit lighting up but now it
won't<00:02:57.660> light<00:02:57.959> up<00:02:58.019> anymore<00:02:58.380> and<00:02:58.799> I'm<00:02:59.609> just<00:02:59.850> I

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
just don't want to take the part to try

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.360 
just don't want to take the part to try

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
and get that single light to light up

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.400 
and get that single light to light up
it's<00:03:05.819> just<00:03:05.850> annoying<00:03:06.569> I<00:03:06.870> don't<00:03:07.079> like<00:03:07.260> that

pieces all contained within the chest in
its<00:03:20.970> own<00:03:21.090> battery<00:03:21.510> in<00:03:21.690> there<00:03:21.900> and<00:03:22.109> same<00:03:22.739> for

its own battery in there and same for

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.800 
its own battery in there and same for
the<00:03:23.010> head<00:03:23.220> that<00:03:23.760> would<00:03:23.850> be<00:03:24.000> that<00:03:24.329> have<00:03:24.450> been<00:03:24.540> so

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
the head that would be that have been so

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:30.220 
the head that would be that have been so
much<00:03:24.959> better<00:03:25.230> but<00:03:26.600> whatever<00:03:28.160> see<00:03:29.160> here's<00:03:29.489> all

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
much better but whatever see here's all

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:33.020 
much better but whatever see here's all
of<00:03:31.230> them<00:03:31.500> run<00:03:31.709> through<00:03:31.980> the<00:03:32.100> head<00:03:32.280> and<00:03:32.819> through

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
of them run through the head and through

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:34.640 
of them run through the head and through
there<00:03:33.180> into<00:03:33.510> the<00:03:33.600> backpack<00:03:33.780> and<00:03:34.500> that

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
there into the backpack and that

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.039 
there into the backpack and that
actually<00:03:34.980> leads<00:03:35.160> to<00:03:35.250> another<00:03:35.459> problem

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:36.049 
actually leads to another problem

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:38.390 
actually leads to another problem
alright<00:03:37.049> here<00:03:37.319> you<00:03:37.350> can<00:03:37.709> see<00:03:37.950> it's<00:03:38.190> just

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
alright here you can see it's just

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.890 
alright here you can see it's just
connected<00:03:38.819> between<00:03:38.940> these<00:03:39.209> two<00:03:39.389> net<00:03:39.569> has<00:03:39.750> to

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
connected between these two net has to

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.620 
connected between these two net has to
this<00:03:40.650> part<00:03:41.040> has<00:03:41.220> to<00:03:41.400> share<00:03:41.639> both<00:03:41.940> the<00:03:42.180> poly<00:03:42.359> cap

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
this part has to share both the poly cap

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:45.710 
this part has to share both the poly cap
and<00:03:42.989> the<00:03:43.170> wire<00:03:43.380> and<00:03:43.680> it's<00:03:44.310> not<00:03:44.670> really<00:03:45.000> it

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
and the wire and it's not really it

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.420 
and the wire and it's not really it
doesn't<00:03:45.959> do<00:03:46.170> that<00:03:46.319> very<00:03:46.500> well<00:03:46.769> but<00:03:47.280> actually

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
doesn't do that very well but actually

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.000 
doesn't do that very well but actually
and<00:03:47.910> there's<00:03:48.630> one<00:03:48.900> peg<00:03:49.170> that<00:03:49.560> connects<00:03:49.890> to

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
and there's one peg that connects to

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.280 
and there's one peg that connects to
these<00:03:50.159> two<00:03:50.400> parts<00:03:50.580> together<00:03:50.849> and<00:03:51.480> actually<00:03:51.930> my

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
these two parts together and actually my

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.350 
these two parts together and actually my
peg<00:03:52.530> snaps<00:03:52.950> so<00:03:53.189> these<00:03:53.310> two<00:03:53.519> kind<00:03:53.849> of<00:03:53.939> just

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
peg snaps so these two kind of just

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:58.680 
peg snaps so these two kind of just
sit<00:03:55.360> there<00:03:55.739> halfway<00:03:56.739> I<00:03:57.400> don't<00:03:58.330> like<00:03:58.480> the<00:03:58.569> way

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:58.690 
sit there halfway I don't like the way

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:00.360 
sit there halfway I don't like the way
they<00:03:58.840> designed<00:03:59.560> that<00:03:59.770> for<00:03:59.980> the<00:04:00.040> head<00:04:00.190> they

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
they designed that for the head they

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.720 
they designed that for the head they
should<00:04:00.550> allowed<00:04:01.090> this<00:04:01.300> either<00:04:01.599> more<00:04:01.900> space<00:04:02.230> or

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
should allowed this either more space or

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.880 
should allowed this either more space or
like<00:04:03.730> I<00:04:03.880> said<00:04:04.090> just<00:04:04.120> done<00:04:04.810> we'll<00:04:05.050> just<00:04:05.739> on

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:05.890 
like I said just done we'll just on

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:10.110 
like I said just done we'll just on
metal<00:04:06.220> components<00:04:06.910> in<00:04:06.970> the<00:04:07.090> head<00:04:07.440> but<00:04:09.000> as<00:04:10.000> I

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
metal components in the head but as I

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:14.280 
metal components in the head but as I
said<00:04:10.300> it<00:04:10.420> before<00:04:11.040> whatever<00:04:12.630> and<00:04:13.630> here's<00:04:14.230> a

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.290
