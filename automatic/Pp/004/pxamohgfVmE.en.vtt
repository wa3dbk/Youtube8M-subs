00:00:09.789 --> 00:00:14.900
 this is the new class of 

00:00:12.289 --> 00:00:16.579
 mercedes benz a big family van den 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.650
 will be available in three lengths that here 

00:00:16.579 --> 00:00:21.199
 is to start the middle variant 5 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:23.300
 14 meters this completely new 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:25.009
 constructed vehicle what able 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.289
 all the assistant systems are out 

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:29.029
 so cars knows to record a 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:30.019
 exciting alternative but not quite 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:32.150
 cheap alternative 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:35.110
 We'll see if the car is worth it 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:35.110
 water costs at the end 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.580
 Pre-cash is available with three engines or 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:46.730
 or with a motor 2.2 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:50.630
 liter diesel but 1 3 ps stages I have 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:52.760
 with 136 163 and 190 ps and at 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:54.080
 Consumption receives the train also at 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.480
 higher speeds relative 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:58.360
 is moderate given six liters 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.900
 we know this is the typical one 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:03.810
 Consumption value you never reached 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:05.940
 we are probably about the 883 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:09.200
 liter we at a fast 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.200
 motorway travel measured here 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.280
 mercedes has strong in the v class 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:19.960
 oriented to the car 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.460
 On the one hand you can see it on the other hand 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.130
 low roof about ten centimeters 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.510
 less than the rival bully and 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.410
 On the other hand, it's quite long 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:30.730
 become hood about 14 centimeters more 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:32.350
 had to be installed so that the 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:34.150
 pedestrian protection is guaranteed 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.830
 is the pedestrian in case of 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:38.620
 an accident really is one 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:40.630
 chance has a disadvantage that makes the car 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:42.100
 altogether a bit confusing 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.470
 you follow it when you are inside 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.480
 mentally slice and then wear 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:47.740
 the car is still going forward it takes 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.390
 quite a time to get a feeling 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.620
 get for how long the car 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:54.090
 really is and that can be done 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:54.090
 city ​​traffic get annoying 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.180
 the quality of a family vans 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:01.869
 decides, of course, also in 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.610
 hold 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:04.990
 mercedes has quite a lot 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:06.909
 to come up with creative ideas 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.560
 on the one hand, you can not just the huge one 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:10.450
 open tailgate but also the 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.000
 upper part in itself the rear window 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:15.910
 separately below is a loading floor of the 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.500
 50 kilo tells enough for all sorts 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.110
 purchases that can be adjusted quickly 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:23.760
 and to test whether this really the case 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:26.980
 I took a lot of help 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:29.310
 Well then both of them really happens 

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.310
 help 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.420
 I would say solidly built then 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.310
 with you the interior 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.260
 I'll do that further back 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.720
 you have to flap the big one 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:43.390
 little to do first around the big one 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:45.030
 to be able to open as in the 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.770
 parking space almost impossible 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.720
 and here you can see the loading floor 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:51.850
 you can unfold yourself again 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.950
 here buys body remove the 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:55.260
 then also be taken in the store 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.330
 can be quite practical actually 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:00.880
 a little bit of work and less 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:03.060
 also nice place together about 1000 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.060
 liter 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:12.520
 march, he is solid reputation for the call 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.380
 Build at least one hatchback 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.220
 they put that under proof the feathers 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.260
 here are pretty neat 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.780
 dimensioned we hold the tailgate 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.070
 in every situation above is the problem 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.660
 if you want to close you have to 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:24.190
 working against these springs to work that is 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.370
 quite difficult that I show them 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:26.370
 times 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:35.769
 They hold the child to what I hang on it 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:37.689
 Loose from clubs and expect instead 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:43.540
 I'm here now it works like that 

00:03:37.689 --> 00:03:45.700
 just as you can tell but it is not 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:48.159
 really easy to do and in tight 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.670
 park gap is also an adult 

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:50.079
 torture 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:52.090
 I would almost own one of them 

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:55.510
 Electric tailgate recommended 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:59.940
 the cost but hefty surcharge the v 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:01.320
 class of mercedes starting from scarcely 37,000 euro 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:05.460
 Now we ask a family member 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:10.820
 half of it is the car he is like that 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:10.820
 or so ok
