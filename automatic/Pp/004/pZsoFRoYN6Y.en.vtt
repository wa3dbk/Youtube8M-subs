you have a designer that's expert on

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:26.389 
you have a designer that's expert on
sketching<00:01:25.110> and<00:01:25.259> all<00:01:25.470> together<00:01:25.619> they<00:01:26.070> create

00:01:26.389 --> 00:01:26.399 
sketching and all together they create

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:28.820 
sketching and all together they create
this<00:01:26.640> very<00:01:27.330> high<00:01:27.540> level<00:01:27.899> in<00:01:28.110> all<00:01:28.229> fields<00:01:28.649> while

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:28.830 
this very high level in all fields while

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:30.949 
this very high level in all fields while
in<00:01:29.220> when<00:01:30.030> you<00:01:30.119> do<00:01:30.209> a<00:01:30.270> coffee<00:01:30.450> machine<00:01:30.690> you

00:01:30.949 --> 00:01:30.959 
in when you do a coffee machine you

00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:32.900 
in when you do a coffee machine you
maybe<00:01:31.170> are<00:01:31.440> more<00:01:31.470> through<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.039> whole<00:01:32.220> process

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:32.910 
maybe are more through the whole process

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:35.779 
maybe are more through the whole process
from<00:01:33.270> sketching<00:01:34.259> to<00:01:34.440> creating<00:01:35.160> the<00:01:35.250> surfaces

00:01:35.779 --> 00:01:35.789 
from sketching to creating the surfaces

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:38.359 
from sketching to creating the surfaces
to<00:01:35.819> to<00:01:36.090> links<00:01:36.450> it's<00:01:36.709> you're<00:01:37.709> more<00:01:37.920> part<00:01:38.160> of<00:01:38.250> the

to to links it's you're more part of the

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.270 
to to links it's you're more part of the
whole<00:01:38.990> process<00:01:39.990> with<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.649> products<00:01:41.130> and

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
whole process with the products and

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.219 
whole process with the products and
transportation<00:01:42.149> and<00:01:42.330> the<00:01:42.479> we're<00:01:43.020> a<00:01:43.050> little

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
transportation and the we're a little

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.469 
transportation and the we're a little
more<00:01:43.410> individual<00:01:44.340> and<00:01:44.490> neat<00:01:44.700> on<00:01:44.970> your<00:01:45.149> tasks

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
more individual and neat on your tasks

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:50.430 
more individual and neat on your tasks
in<00:01:45.750> automotive

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:50.440 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.720 

I<00:01:51.750> think<00:01:52.750> with<00:01:52.930> the<00:01:52.990> new<00:01:53.020> x6<00:01:53.650> we<00:01:53.950> try<00:01:54.250> to<00:01:54.310> make

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:54.730 
I think with the new x6 we try to make

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:58.260 
I think with the new x6 we try to make
the<00:01:55.450> x6<00:01:55.930> mature<00:01:56.470> and<00:01:57.280> to<00:01:57.460> put<00:01:57.640> a<00:01:57.670> lot<00:01:57.850> of<00:01:57.970> effort

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
the x6 mature and to put a lot of effort

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.390 
the x6 mature and to put a lot of effort
to<00:01:58.390> make<00:01:58.420> it<00:01:58.720> more<00:01:58.930> a<00:01:58.990> premium<00:01:59.770> feel<00:02:00.010> almost

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:00.400 
to make it more a premium feel almost

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.360 
to make it more a premium feel almost
ours<00:02:00.550> luxury<00:02:00.940> and<00:02:01.270> also<00:02:02.110> to<00:02:02.170> use<00:02:02.380> some<00:02:03.130> of<00:02:03.250> the

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:03.370 
ours luxury and also to use some of the

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:05.160 
ours luxury and also to use some of the
key<00:02:03.580> characters<00:02:04.300> for<00:02:04.510> an<00:02:04.570> ex<00:02:04.720> car<00:02:04.990> and

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
key characters for an ex car and

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.140 
key characters for an ex car and
emphasize<00:02:05.620> on<00:02:05.800> this<00:02:05.890> like<00:02:06.190> the<00:02:06.340> copy<00:02:06.640> roofline

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:07.150 
emphasize on this like the copy roofline

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:08.639 
emphasize on this like the copy roofline
and<00:02:07.180> this<00:02:07.480> so<00:02:07.630> it's<00:02:07.780> it's<00:02:08.260> still<00:02:08.410> a<00:02:08.470> very

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
and this so it's it's still a very

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:11.520 
and this so it's it's still a very
typical<00:02:08.920> x6<00:02:09.610> but<00:02:10.300> if<00:02:10.479> the<00:02:10.630> matured<00:02:11.050> we<00:02:11.380> also

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
typical x6 but if the matured we also

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.120 
typical x6 but if the matured we also
wanted<00:02:11.890> it<00:02:12.040> to<00:02:12.190> be<00:02:12.340> a<00:02:13.080> very<00:02:14.080> extroverted<00:02:14.620> car

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
wanted it to be a very extroverted car

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.520 
wanted it to be a very extroverted car
but<00:02:15.700> not<00:02:15.880> with<00:02:16.120> a<00:02:16.150> negative<00:02:16.690> sense<00:02:16.990> a<00:02:17.200> little

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
but not with a negative sense a little

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:18.900 
but not with a negative sense a little
more<00:02:17.710> sophisticated

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
more sophisticated

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.030 
more sophisticated
so<00:02:19.270> we<00:02:19.360> also<00:02:19.510> put<00:02:19.900> focus<00:02:20.170> on<00:02:20.380> efficient

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
so we also put focus on efficient

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.690 
so we also put focus on efficient
dynamic<00:02:21.460> and<00:02:21.670> how<00:02:21.720> it<00:02:23.190> has<00:02:24.190> better<00:02:24.430> fuel

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
dynamic and how it has better fuel

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.640 
dynamic and how it has better fuel
consumption<00:02:25.060> and<00:02:25.360> an<00:02:25.630> aerodynamic<00:02:25.900> aspect

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
consumption and an aerodynamic aspect

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.220 
consumption and an aerodynamic aspect
and<00:02:26.800> so<00:02:26.950> on<00:02:27.070> so<00:02:27.460> we<00:02:27.760> wanted<00:02:28.000> a<00:02:28.230> more

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
and so on so we wanted a more

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:30.900 
and so on so we wanted a more
sophisticated<00:02:29.590> car<00:02:30.370> but<00:02:30.580> it's<00:02:30.730> still

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:30.910 
sophisticated car but it's still

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:36.390 
sophisticated car but it's still
show-off<00:02:34.170> in<00:02:35.170> regards<00:02:35.530> to<00:02:35.650> the<00:02:35.800> whole<00:02:36.010> design

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
show-off in regards to the whole design

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.120 
show-off in regards to the whole design
process<00:02:36.850> for<00:02:37.060> a<00:02:37.120> car<00:02:37.420> it's<00:02:38.260> it's<00:02:38.860> a<00:02:38.950> quite

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
process for a car it's it's a quite

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.370 
process for a car it's it's a quite
complex<00:02:39.460> thing<00:02:39.730> and<00:02:39.850> it's<00:02:40.030> of<00:02:40.420> course<00:02:40.480> I<00:02:40.930> think

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
complex thing and it's of course I think

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.800 
complex thing and it's of course I think
we<00:02:41.590> started<00:02:41.980> sketching<00:02:42.340> in<00:02:42.610> the<00:02:42.700> end<00:02:42.880> of<00:02:43.030> 2010

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
we started sketching in the end of 2010

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.410 
we started sketching in the end of 2010
on<00:02:44.020> this<00:02:44.170> one<00:02:44.380> with<00:02:45.100> the<00:02:45.220> sketch<00:02:45.610> ideation<00:02:46.300> and

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
on this one with the sketch ideation and

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.980 
on this one with the sketch ideation and
then<00:02:46.810> you<00:02:46.930> also<00:02:47.080> have<00:02:47.260> a<00:02:47.320> lot<00:02:47.470> of<00:02:47.500> designers

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:48.990 
then you also have a lot of designers

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:52.670 
then you also have a lot of designers
doing<00:02:49.990> is<00:02:50.230> a<00:02:50.260> sketch<00:02:50.650> pitch<00:02:51.220> so<00:02:51.520> to<00:02:51.580> say<00:02:51.850> and

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
doing is a sketch pitch so to say and

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.170 
doing is a sketch pitch so to say and
and<00:02:53.680> then<00:02:53.890> it<00:02:54.010> gets<00:02:54.160> selected<00:02:54.760> through

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
and then it gets selected through

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.750 
and then it gets selected through
different<00:02:55.480> stages<00:02:55.900> from<00:02:56.310> first<00:02:57.310> sketches

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
different stages from first sketches

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.750 
different stages from first sketches
then<00:02:58.120> to<00:02:58.360> 3d<00:02:58.750> and<00:02:59.170> to<00:02:59.350> clay<00:02:59.709> models<00:03:00.160> one-to-one

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
then to 3d and to clay models one-to-one

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.110 
then to 3d and to clay models one-to-one
scale<00:03:00.940> and<00:03:01.540> then<00:03:01.750> in<00:03:01.870> the<00:03:01.989> end<00:03:02.080> you<00:03:02.200> have<00:03:03.120> very

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
scale and then in the end you have very

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.630 
scale and then in the end you have very
realistic<00:03:04.690> models<00:03:05.080> and<00:03:05.290> very<00:03:05.470> refined<00:03:05.980> models

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
realistic models and very refined models

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:12.010 
realistic models and very refined models
so<00:03:07.239> it's<00:03:07.360> a<00:03:07.510> long<00:03:07.780> process

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:12.020 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:14.830 

I<00:03:12.220> think<00:03:13.220> you<00:03:13.310> can<00:03:13.490> see<00:03:13.640> with<00:03:13.790> the<00:03:13.880> x6<00:03:14.420> it<00:03:14.660> was<00:03:14.810> a

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
I think you can see with the x6 it was a

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.600 
I think you can see with the x6 it was a
quite<00:03:15.170> dare<00:03:15.440> move<00:03:15.620> from<00:03:15.860> the<00:03:15.980> beginning<00:03:16.310> to<00:03:16.490> go

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:16.610 
quite dare move from the beginning to go

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:18.880 
quite dare move from the beginning to go
into<00:03:16.820> new<00:03:17.000> field<00:03:17.300> to<00:03:17.540> blending<00:03:18.170> this<00:03:18.290> copy<00:03:18.860> a

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:18.890 
into new field to blending this copy a

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:21.280 
into new field to blending this copy a
car<00:03:19.190> with<00:03:19.340> an<00:03:19.430> off-road<00:03:19.820> and<00:03:20.030> you<00:03:20.870> can<00:03:21.020> see<00:03:21.170> the

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
car with an off-road and you can see the

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.140 
car with an off-road and you can see the
success<00:03:21.530> over<00:03:21.950> the<00:03:21.980> years<00:03:22.340> how<00:03:22.490> other<00:03:22.700> brands

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.150 
success over the years how other brands

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.770 
success over the years how other brands
are<00:03:23.270> now<00:03:23.390> starting<00:03:23.840> to<00:03:24.050> to<00:03:24.590> copy<00:03:24.800> and<00:03:25.300> like<00:03:26.300> I

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
are now starting to to copy and like I

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.600 
are now starting to to copy and like I
think<00:03:27.110> Mercedes<00:03:27.740> is<00:03:27.860> coming<00:03:28.160> out<00:03:28.280> with<00:03:28.430> one

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:28.610 
think Mercedes is coming out with one

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:31.300 
think Mercedes is coming out with one
now<00:03:28.760> and<00:03:28.970> it's<00:03:29.450> quite<00:03:29.660> interesting<00:03:29.690> to<00:03:30.310> to

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
now and it's quite interesting to to

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:32.770 
now and it's quite interesting to to
have<00:03:31.460> created<00:03:31.850> something<00:03:32.090> that<00:03:32.270> are<00:03:32.540> being

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
have created something that are being

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.720 
have created something that are being
copied<00:03:33.080> you<00:03:33.350> know<00:03:33.500> so<00:03:33.800> I<00:03:33.830> think<00:03:34.130> we<00:03:34.400> are<00:03:34.520> said

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
copied you know so I think we are said

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:36.310 
copied you know so I think we are said
to<00:03:34.850> try<00:03:35.030> to<00:03:35.090> stay<00:03:35.360> in<00:03:35.390> the<00:03:35.570> lead<00:03:35.750> and<00:03:35.960> keep

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:36.320 
to try to stay in the lead and keep

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:39.760 
to try to stay in the lead and keep
develop<00:03:36.770> the<00:03:36.920> cars<00:03:37.190> more<00:03:37.900> even<00:03:38.900> more<00:03:38.930> premium

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:39.770 
develop the cars more even more premium

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:47.030 
develop the cars more even more premium
and<00:03:40.010> more<00:03:40.250> good<00:03:40.910> at<00:03:41.060> what<00:03:41.240> it<00:03:41.270> does

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.520 

you<00:03:47.489> can<00:03:47.670> see<00:03:47.819> how<00:03:47.909> complex<00:03:48.090> the<00:03:48.540> car<00:03:48.719> is<00:03:48.870> with

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
you can see how complex the car is with

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.050 
you can see how complex the car is with
the<00:03:49.680> regulations<00:03:50.310> and<00:03:50.430> the<00:03:50.519> technical

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
the regulations and the technical

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:52.849 
the regulations and the technical
requirements<00:03:51.689> it's<00:03:51.900> a<00:03:51.989> lot<00:03:52.140> of<00:03:52.170> work<00:03:52.500> together

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:52.859 
requirements it's a lot of work together

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:55.910 
requirements it's a lot of work together
with<00:03:53.159> engineers<00:03:54.109> not<00:03:55.109> always<00:03:55.439> against<00:03:55.859> the

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
with engineers not always against the

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.380 
with engineers not always against the
engineer<00:03:56.250> it's<00:03:56.370> more<00:03:56.549> together<00:03:56.760> you<00:03:57.120> try<00:03:57.329> to

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
engineer it's more together you try to

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.410 
engineer it's more together you try to
solve<00:03:57.750> problems<00:03:58.319> you<00:03:58.500> know<00:03:58.620> how<00:03:58.799> to<00:03:58.859> make<00:03:59.099> it

00:03:59.410 --> 00:03:59.420 
solve problems you know how to make it

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:02.479 
solve problems you know how to make it
more<00:04:00.420> beautiful<00:04:00.599> or<00:04:01.140> in<00:04:01.290> a<00:04:01.409> cheaper<00:04:01.859> or<00:04:02.189> to

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489 
more beautiful or in a cheaper or to

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:04.369 
more beautiful or in a cheaper or to
produce<00:04:02.670> or<00:04:03.209> there's<00:04:03.510> a<00:04:03.599> lot<00:04:04.079> of<00:04:04.200> challenges

00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:04.379 
produce or there's a lot of challenges

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:06.920 
produce or there's a lot of challenges
all<00:04:04.950> over<00:04:05.189> the<00:04:05.310> car<00:04:05.519> and<00:04:05.790> of<00:04:06.450> course<00:04:06.659> you<00:04:06.750> want

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
all over the car and of course you want

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:09.229 
all over the car and of course you want
your<00:04:06.989> design<00:04:07.439> to<00:04:07.799> survive<00:04:08.640> through<00:04:09.030> all<00:04:09.090> the

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
your design to survive through all the

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:10.910 
your design to survive through all the
stages<00:04:09.510> so<00:04:09.840> you<00:04:09.959> it's<00:04:10.170> a<00:04:10.260> little<00:04:10.500> fight<00:04:10.680> to

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 
stages so you it's a little fight to

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.369 
stages so you it's a little fight to
keep<00:04:11.189> the<00:04:11.760> essence<00:04:12.120> of<00:04:12.239> your<00:04:12.390> idea<00:04:12.720> to<00:04:13.349> the

00:04:13.369 --> 00:04:13.379 
keep the essence of your idea to the

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:15.859 
keep the essence of your idea to the
very<00:04:13.680> end
