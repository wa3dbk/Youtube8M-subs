00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.990
 hello j the orma coach experience 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.480
 walk today I'm going to you 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.099
 explain how to determine your fcm 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:12.780
 in other words, your heart rate 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:14.340
 maximum the term of fcm is omnipresent 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.590
 in the jargon of the race training 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.779
 on foot it is found in many 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.300
 articles dedicated to training but 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.279
 also in the training plans for 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.539
 some sessions 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:26.130
 the intensity of efforts is expressed in 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.099
 percentage of heart rate 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.660
 It is therefore imperative that the 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.270
 foot runner may have a 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.850
 reliable value of this famous fcm for 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.850
 to be able to take full advantage of the plan 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.890
 training that he will follow for 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.430
 determine this fcm there are several 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.260
 methods 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.690
 but before approaching them we will 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.120
 start by getting rid of the 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.399
 most used formula indeed 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.140
 a lot of runners to determine 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.260
 their stage dreams is based on the 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:58.109
 famous formula of 120 - the golden age at 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.969
 final on the ground we realize 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.820
 that this formula is unreliable 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.229
 it gives values ​​of fcn they are 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.290
 different from the ones we can measure 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.720
 in the field why simply 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.330
 this formula is based on a standard 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.460
 in fact it represents a gold average 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.740
 like in any average there are some 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.540
 Individuals that are located above the 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.820
 individuals who are dismissed below 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.950
 I take for example a 40 year course 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.470
 logically we should find it a 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.030
 fcm of 180 beats per minute 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.850
 if we apply this formula 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.740
 out of athletes I train 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.490
 also after having discussed with 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.170
 many runners 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.049
 it turns out that they end up with 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.509
 maximum heart rate of 180,590 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.030
 195 I even saw x 200 pulses 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.409
 per minute 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.210
 so we can not afford to have 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.079
 so much difference in the evaluation 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.700
 from the asm 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.740
 because when we are going to set up 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.119
 training plans and we're going 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.920
 implement the percentages 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.990
 of sn we're going to have some gaps too 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.570
 important 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:59.790
 then there is a reassurance of 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:03.680
 methods that make it possible to measure more 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:06.140
 precisely this famous sr 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.390
 one of the solutions on to get a 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.910
 reliable s &amp; m value is all 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.710
 simply to perform a stress test 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.420
 it was defending you can 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:16.820
 perform either at the cardiologist's or 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.680
 in a sports medicine center or at 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:20.660
 through the stress tests proposed in 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.410
 athletics clubs then in the 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.510
 athletics clubs 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:26.000
 we often use test the test 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:28.190
 evans valves and the butcher light test 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.500
 then these tests are initially planned 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.110
 to evaluate the vma ie the 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.280
 aerobic maximum speed 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.870
 in other words the race speed to 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.080
 which the rider reaches his 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:41.300
 maximum oxygen consumption but 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.040
 when you pass this type of test to the 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.350
 end of the test when you reach your 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.410
 aerobic maximum speed you reach 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:50.150
 also your maximum heart rate 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:52.580
 so it's not enough just to 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.830
 raise the frequency reached at the end 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:58.790
 of the test and you will have a reliable value 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:00.739
 of your fcm for people who have not 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.050
 no access to this kind of test there is 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:05.300
 a second solution to get a 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:06.770
 reliable sn value it just enough 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:09.110
 to simply use races 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:11.150
 which you then participate in 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:14.739
 level of distances you have to leave on 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:16.640
 the 5 km voice ideally on the 10 km 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:18.620
 why not simply 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.239
 during these two races the duration of 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.310
 the effort is relatively long 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:24.739
 but the intensity of the efforts is also 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:27.049
 in relation to him, it is necessary that these 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:28.519
 two parameters are present for 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:30.580
 hope to reach his heart rate 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:33.830
 maximum 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:34.459
 so the day of the race in the 500 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:37.100
 last meters 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:39.590
 give 100% of your 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:42.380
 abilities and once the finish line 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:45.230
 crossed immediately look at the 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:47.209
 heart rate reached and he is 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:48.980
 it's a safe bet that the value you 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:51.769
 go get to the end of your run 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:55.760
 very very very close to voting 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:57.230
 fcn i would even say that often me to 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.209
 personal title but also on 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:01.850
 runners that I train we found 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:04.250
 fcm higher than we had 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:06.140
 measured during stress tests and who 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:08.060
 of course was not connected at all 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:08.540
 with the famous formula that I evoked 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:13.190
 see you later 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:15.740
 220 - age so for me finally 1 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:18.950
 the 5 km and 10 km the cross-country 

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:21.049
 winter are great places to 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:25.520
 also measure heart rate 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:27.890
 maximum runner third solution 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.870
 for the person who does not have access to 

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:31.730
 stress test they do not realize 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:35.780
 races simply to achieve 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:37.970
 a test session then this session is 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:41.300
 what are you going to organize it in the way 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:42.970
 next you start with 20 minutes 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:45.350
 quiet allure 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:47.690
 then you chained by ten minutes 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:48.860
 fast jogging but be careful you do not 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:52.250
 you do not put in the red you 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:53.840
 stay at the balanced respiratory and 

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:55.160
 on the last ten last ten 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:59.810
 minutes of your sitting there though 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:05:01.850
 give you 100% of your abilities and to 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:02.950
 the outcome of these ten minutes of efforts to 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:05.390
 high intensity 

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:06.350
 when you give thoroughly on both 

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:09.050
 last three minutes 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:11.510
 you simply raise the 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:12.620
 heart rate reached then that 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:15.110
 may be a little less reliable than 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:16.550
 on a stress test but that and wherever 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:19.130
 on a race but already there you 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:20.950
 will get a value of fcm that will 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:23.270
 closer to reality 

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:24.410
 so obviously before you start 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:26.270
 in this kind of sitting 

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:28.370
 it is imperative to check that you 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:30.260
 are in good physical shape he's out 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:32.270
 of question for a body that starts at 

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:34.970
 hurdle of running to embark on 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:36.919
 background in this kind of test always 

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:38.350
 take advice from your doctor if 

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:40.760
 you have the slightest doubt 

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:43.669
 whatever the solution chosen for 

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:46.040
 evaluate your fcm it is imperative to 

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:48.380
 able to accurately measure 

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:49.700
 heart rates achieved one can 

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:51.410
 not be content with taking a 

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:53.870
 pulsation at the carotid artery 

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:56.030
 at the wrist level indeed when we 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:58.580
 do so well we ask you to 

00:05:56.030 --> 00:06:00.650
 calculate the number of pulsations out of six 

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:03.380
 seconds or ten seconds and then from 

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:06.770
 multiply the result by either 6 or 

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:09.410
 by ten gold the slightest mistake of 

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:11.660
 counting a low pulse will 

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:13.610
 obligatorily reverberates and with a 

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:17.540
 difference after in your final calculation 

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:19.760
 from 10 to 15 publications among us it's 

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:21.729
 to say you're going to get a value of 

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:25.340
 fcm that will not be reliable at all 

00:06:21.729 --> 00:06:26.060
 then to get a value of fcm 

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:28.220
 sial 

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:29.950
 use the heart rate monitor this 

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:32.690
 are devices that are planned 

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:34.010
 really for that and who proved their 

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:35.990
 reliability now since 

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:36.500
 many years with this guy 

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:38.570
 device 

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:40.730
 1 you will get fm values 

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:41.720
 accurate and then two balls when you 

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:43.430
 put your plans in place 

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:45.500
 when you are asked 

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:47.720
 then to respect certain 

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:50.180
 percentage of sn will you have 

00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:50.540
 a reliable tool that will last in 

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:52.460
 the weather 

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:54.380
 so do not hesitate to do this kind 

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:57.160
 investment is frankly not 

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:59.720
 money thrown out the windows 

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:01.490
 so here with these different elements 

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:04.370
 now you are able to get 

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:06.560
 s &amp; m values that will be close to 

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:08.210
 the reality was necessarily going away 

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:09.760
 at cardiologist night in a center 

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:11.870
 sports medicine 

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:14.389
 do not hesitate over the years to 

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:17.930
 cross different values ​​obtained 

00:07:14.389 --> 00:07:20.180
 be talked about efforts be talking to 

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:22.820
 the outcome of your shopping be at the end of 

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:24.470
 some test sessions as you go 

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:27.500
 may be surprised to see that your 

00:07:24.470 --> 00:07:29.419
 cm varies more like the general says on 

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:31.789
 says that the ASM is gradually decreasing 

00:07:29.419 --> 00:07:33.650
 over the years but in the end we surrender 

00:07:31.789 --> 00:07:36.050
 here again that there are phenomena 

00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:38.840
 that go against the conventional wisdom 

00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:41.030
 indeed it happens very regularly 

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:42.890
 than kora on foot after 

00:07:41.030 --> 00:07:44.120
 periods of workouts get 

00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:46.669
 found with heart rate 

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:48.410
 higher than that which was the 

00:07:46.669 --> 00:07:50.390
 their when they stopped 

00:07:48.410 --> 00:07:51.860
 I take the example to a runner who have 

00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:53.810
 a heart rate of 180 

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:55.250
 pulsations per minute going could very 

00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:57.260
 get back together with a 

00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:59.090
 maximum heart rate of 190 

00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:00.620
 pulsations per minute after for example 

00:07:59.090 --> 00:08:04.160
 six months of interruption of the race to 

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:07.400
 foot here so I hope now 

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:10.100
 you are well equipped to get 

00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:11.900
 specific values of your essay n 

00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:14.570
 will be found soon for 

00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:16.400
 new videos tips by then I 

00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:19.450
