00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
application in this game is only $2.99

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.730 
application in this game is only $2.99
and<00:01:07.340> it's<00:01:08.340> a<00:01:08.760> little<00:01:09.060> bit<00:01:09.360> hefty<00:01:09.750> at<00:01:09.930> that

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
price at least for me I think it would

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.940 
price at least for me I think it would
more<00:01:14.549> fit<00:01:14.939> in<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.390> $0.99<00:01:16.140> area<00:01:16.560> but

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
more fit in the $0.99 area but

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.039 
more fit in the $0.99 area but
nonetheless<00:01:17.580> a<00:01:17.909> great<00:01:18.509> game<00:01:18.900> and<00:01:19.820> so<00:01:21.049> since

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
nonetheless a great game and so since

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
fruit ninja or something like that all

00:01:47.970 --> 00:02:43.250 
fruit ninja or something like that all
right<00:01:48.620> so<00:01:49.620> I'm<00:01:50.040> gonna<00:01:50.220> do<00:01:50.490> oh<00:02:42.020> crap

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
right so I'm gonna do oh crap

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.350 
right so I'm gonna do oh crap
I<00:02:43.290> accidentally<00:02:44.040> sliced<00:02:44.400> one<00:02:44.700> of<00:02:44.850> those<00:02:45.000> time

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
I accidentally sliced one of those time

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.560 
I accidentally sliced one of those time
bombs<00:02:45.690> and<00:02:46.160> I<00:02:47.160> guess<00:02:47.430> the<00:02:47.670> rule<00:02:48.180> of<00:02:48.300> the<00:02:48.420> game

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
bombs and I guess the rule of the game

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:51.320 
bombs and I guess the rule of the game
is<00:02:48.630> you<00:02:49.080> don't<00:02:49.260> slice<00:02:49.650> you<00:02:50.280> try<00:02:50.640> to<00:02:50.700> avoid<00:02:51.060> the

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
is you don't slice you try to avoid the

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.680 
is you don't slice you try to avoid the
time<00:02:51.840> bomb<00:02:52.110> and<00:02:52.850> okay<00:02:53.850> well<00:02:54.120> that's<00:02:54.360> good

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
time bomb and okay well that's good

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.240 
time bomb and okay well that's good
