00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.800
 today we will show you how 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.800
 prepare some rich esquites for the 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.720
 that do not know about skeet skeet like you 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.939
 want to call are some snacks 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:28.009
 Mexicans this word comes from the 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:32.040
 Nahuatl and means toast a lot of people 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:34.350
 well, corn with many other things 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.270
 Menjurjes, so to speak, but 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.060
 we only met the Zealots 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.940
 in a pot like this 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:44.400
 with a quarter of water and we leave it 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.770
 boil until they are soft look like this 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:49.200
 it's how they are now and now only 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.270
 let's slice the 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.140
 Here we have our corn ready 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.140
 Cooked 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:56.850
 the herds 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.700
 yes 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:06.610
 and for this recipe the ingredients are 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:12.250
 Well mayonnaise 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:16.030
 chilito powder lemon and salt and we need 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:18.010
 to us the grated cheese cheese that 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:21.160
 we missed but you can add 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:22.900
 everything they want in many places is 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:25.420
 usually differently so 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:29.500
 the ingredients will always vary 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:33.090
 depending on the region or state 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.090
 here is already ready 1 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.240
 once we have it sliced 

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:42.260
 we are going to disintegrate the grains as if 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:45.200
 we were shelling 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:47.980
 for that because if not, it would seem that 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.980
 it is whole 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.070
 the corn 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.189
 and here is already in the process to fill 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.689
 our cup and add all the 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:01.619
 other ingredients the truth that is a 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:04.850
 little Mexican is very good 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.850
 me if I love 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.970
 once it's shelled we're going to 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:16.150
 put in the glass and before filling it 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:18.579
 we can add lemon for what 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:23.170
 because then when they sell them only 

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:25.110
 they put it up and down are x we 're going to 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:28.630
 put 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:32.440
 and in the content of the ingredients 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:36.530
 lemon for the juicers but this 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:43.120
 woman as well wants to be the cow 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:43.120
 so he has a lot of willpower 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.870
 we give mayonnaise a lot of people do not 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:52.170
 like mayonnaise puts those who are 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.170
 to 100 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:57.450
 we add more so that all the 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.450
 glass 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.390
 look what kind of 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.390
 let's also put more of the world 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:21.060
 if they knew the smell, they would be touched 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.060
 I assure you 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:32.049
 it's not mayonnaise 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:37.930
 who has not heard the song of the 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:42.100
 mayonnaise here is she basically like 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:44.410
 I told them we needed 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:48.100
 grated cheese but it seems that already 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:52.440
 is ready we will try either way I 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:52.440
 they ask me to try it because I sacrifice 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:58.880
 um 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:58.880
 delicious bai
