00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:45.260 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.389 

yeah<00:00:46.260> that's<00:00:46.590> they<00:00:47.280> took<00:00:47.730> like<00:00:47.910> a<00:00:47.940> bowie<00:00:48.270> knife

00:00:49.389 --> 00:00:49.399 
yeah that's they took like a bowie knife

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:52.880 
yeah that's they took like a bowie knife
jammed<00:00:50.399> it<00:00:50.550> in<00:00:50.670> just<00:00:50.879> one<00:00:50.969> hot<00:00:51.469> slice<00:00:52.469> right

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
jammed it in just one hot slice right

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.069 
jammed it in just one hot slice right
into<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.250> toy<00:00:53.480> having<00:00:54.480> a<00:00:54.510> look<00:00:54.629> at<00:00:54.719> this<00:00:54.840> a<00:00:54.870> bit

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
into the toy having a look at this a bit

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.750 
into the toy having a look at this a bit
more<00:00:55.260> I<00:00:55.320> think<00:00:55.620> this<00:00:55.710> is<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:55.949> underside<00:00:56.520> of

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
more I think this is the underside of

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.200 
more I think this is the underside of
gutter<00:00:57.199> so<00:00:58.199> at<00:00:59.100> least<00:00:59.309> that's<00:00:59.640> not<00:00:59.730> gonna<00:01:00.000> be

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
gutter so at least that's not gonna be

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.450 
gutter so at least that's not gonna be
like<00:01:00.510> an<00:01:00.750> utter<00:01:01.289> defacement<00:01:02.070> of<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.250> piece

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
like an utter defacement of the piece

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.759 
like an utter defacement of the piece
but<00:01:03.140> that's<00:01:04.140> completely<00:01:04.559> unacceptable

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
but that's completely unacceptable

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.800 
but that's completely unacceptable
