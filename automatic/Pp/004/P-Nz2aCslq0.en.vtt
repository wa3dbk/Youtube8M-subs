00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
our tests we found that a range between

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.690 
our tests we found that a range between
37<00:01:05.720> and<00:01:05.990> 50<00:01:06.500> miles<00:01:06.740> is<00:01:07.040> more<00:01:07.340> realistic

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 
37 and 50 miles is more realistic

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.330 
37 and 50 miles is more realistic
driving<00:01:08.660> the<00:01:08.960> Twizy<00:01:09.290> feels<00:01:09.530> quite<00:01:09.740> strange<00:01:09.950> at

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
driving the Twizy feels quite strange at

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.460 
driving the Twizy feels quite strange at
first<00:01:10.370> this<00:01:11.330> versions<00:01:11.750> actually<00:01:12.110> got<00:01:12.320> the

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 
first this versions actually got the

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.170 
first this versions actually got the
optional<00:01:12.890> five<00:01:13.190> hundred<00:01:13.550> and<00:01:13.610> fifty<00:01:13.940> pound

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.180 
optional five hundred and fifty pound

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.540 
optional five hundred and fifty pound
doors<00:01:14.510> but<00:01:15.140> there<00:01:15.260> are<00:01:15.350> still<00:01:15.560> no<00:01:15.740> windows<00:01:16.280> so

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:16.550 
doors but there are still no windows so

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:18.670 
doors but there are still no windows so
you're<00:01:16.940> quite<00:01:17.090> exposed<00:01:17.600> to<00:01:17.870> the<00:01:17.990> elements<00:01:18.080> and

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:18.680 
you're quite exposed to the elements and

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.130 
you're quite exposed to the elements and
you<00:01:18.740> need<00:01:19.580> to<00:01:19.700> be<00:01:19.820> prepared<00:01:20.270> for<00:01:20.390> plenty<00:01:20.870> of

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
you need to be prepared for plenty of

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.350 
you need to be prepared for plenty of
attention<00:01:21.410> and<00:01:22.310> luckily<00:01:22.610> the<00:01:22.820> controls<00:01:23.210> are

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
attention and luckily the controls are

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.260 
attention and luckily the controls are
really<00:01:23.570> simple<00:01:24.020> there<00:01:24.830> are<00:01:24.950> no<00:01:25.070> gears<00:01:25.400> so<00:01:26.150> it's

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
really simple there are no gears so it's

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.240 
really simple there are no gears so it's
just<00:01:26.360> accelerate<00:01:26.990> brake<00:01:27.410> and<00:01:27.650> steer<00:01:27.920> and

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
just accelerate brake and steer and

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:29.950 
just accelerate brake and steer and
you'll<00:01:28.880> see<00:01:29.030> me<00:01:29.150> zipping<00:01:29.480> in<00:01:29.600> and<00:01:29.750> out<00:01:29.840> of

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
you'll see me zipping in and out of

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.410 
you'll see me zipping in and out of
traffic<00:01:30.140> really<00:01:30.590> easily<00:01:31.060> electric<00:01:32.060> motors

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
traffic really easily electric motors

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.270 
traffic really easily electric motors
produce<00:01:32.660> all<00:01:33.050> their<00:01:33.380> torque<00:01:33.650> or<00:01:34.010> pulling

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
produce all their torque or pulling

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:35.800 
produce all their torque or pulling
power<00:01:34.640> from<00:01:35.000> a<00:01:35.090> standstill

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
power from a standstill

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.350 
power from a standstill
so<00:01:36.440> the<00:01:36.560> Twizy<00:01:36.860> actually<00:01:37.370> feels<00:01:37.580> quite<00:01:37.880> quick

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
so the Twizy actually feels quite quick

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.990 
so the Twizy actually feels quite quick
up<00:01:38.570> to<00:01:38.720> about<00:01:38.930> 30<00:01:39.320> miles<00:01:39.710> an<00:01:39.860> hour<00:01:39.980> and<00:01:40.310> it's

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
up to about 30 miles an hour and it's

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.240 
up to about 30 miles an hour and it's
brilliant<00:01:41.480> fun<00:01:41.780> the<00:01:42.350> steering<00:01:42.770> is<00:01:42.890> really

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
brilliant fun the steering is really

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.130 
brilliant fun the steering is really
directly<00:01:43.760> you<00:01:43.880> can<00:01:44.030> dart<00:01:44.360> around<00:01:44.720> corners

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
directly you can dart around corners

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:46.460 
directly you can dart around corners
like<00:01:45.320> a<00:01:45.350> go-cart

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
like a go-cart

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.440 
like a go-cart
unfortunately<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.400> ride<00:01:47.610> quality<00:01:47.880> isn't

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
unfortunately the ride quality isn't

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.930 
unfortunately the ride quality isn't
such<00:01:48.600> a<00:01:48.630> strong<00:01:49.050> point<00:01:49.350> it's<00:01:49.860> very<00:01:50.280> firm<00:01:50.670> and

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:50.940 
such a strong point it's very firm and

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:52.940 
such a strong point it's very firm and
there's<00:01:51.450> almost<00:01:51.600> no<00:01:51.960> padding<00:01:52.410> in<00:01:52.530> this<00:01:52.650> seat

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
there's almost no padding in this seat

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.920 
there's almost no padding in this seat
so<00:01:53.220> it's<00:01:53.730> lucky<00:01:53.880> you'll<00:01:54.090> only<00:01:54.240> be<00:01:54.450> using<00:01:54.690> it

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
so it's lucky you'll only be using it

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:55.940 
so it's lucky you'll only be using it
for<00:01:54.960> short<00:01:55.350> journeys

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
for short journeys

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.760 
for short journeys
it's<00:01:56.850> was<00:01:57.030> ease<00:01:57.180> also<00:01:57.540> too<00:01:57.600> wide<00:01:58.050> to<00:01:58.320> filter

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
it's was ease also too wide to filter

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.740 
it's was ease also too wide to filter
through<00:01:58.980> traffic<00:01:59.220> like<00:01:59.430> a<00:01:59.580> motorbike<00:02:00.180> and

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
through traffic like a motorbike and

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.570 
through traffic like a motorbike and
although<00:02:01.230> here<00:02:01.650> in<00:02:01.740> central<00:02:02.130> London<00:02:02.460> you

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580 
although here in central London you
