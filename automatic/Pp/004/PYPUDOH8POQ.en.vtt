00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 to think about it always never talk about it 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.330
 it was a bit like that so we saw 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.280
 smiles those of laurent labit t luc 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.960
 ducalcon his future player of the 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.969
 concentration especially for laurent 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.500
 through and gonzalo quesada three men 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.480
 who did not even greet even 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.430
 not to cross before the beginning of this 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.680
 encounter there is a match to play a 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.539
 capital match for the rest of the season 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.070
 a match that castrais take by 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.570
 the good end they are installed since the 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.369
 beginning of this meeting in half 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.019
 of bicycle racing subway the bike for 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.029
 boorman the release is fast enough 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.160
 with samson relay the balloon for by 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.950
 the inner hook and already after seven 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.739
 minutes the first try in favor of 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.050
 Olympic castres that leads 7 to 0 tries 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.000
 registered by the Fijian lease that comes 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.219
 reward the very good start of the match 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.250
 castrated who really dominates the 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.890
 debates it's hard for gonzalo quesada and 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.989
 patricio noriega is hard all the more 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.850
 that rory kockott adds three points 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.510
 on penalty we play for ten minutes 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.010
 and castrates leads 10 to 0 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.480
 big domination on the part of 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.100
 castrated and the racing tries to put 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.329
 finally the hand on the balloon and 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.700
 multiply playing times but 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.439
 aggressiveness and castrated side with this 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.750
 badly negotiated balloon 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:12.180
 recovered by casserole that can 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.430
 quickly eject this balloon that comes out 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.310
 for 505 sound that lengthens his pass for 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.200
 brice mach mac who sets for thales 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.610
 thales for martial running 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.740
 the winger of the cases would kick it 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.840
 from above and recovers the balloon and at the 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.110
 race is going to crash the second try 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:31.619
 personal achievement signed romain martial 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.840
 superb test of castrated winger and 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.549
 once again this aggression to 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.500
 the image of rory kockott who is at 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.880
 the origin of the recovery the turn 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.250
 over is behind that goes very fast with 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.899
 this against the martial conclusion for 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.320
 the second try is played since 24 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.990
 minutes 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.659
 the seo masters his subject at the beginning of 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.670
 match and it's already 10 7 to 0 it's hard 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.920
 it's hard for Parisians trying 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:56.280
 to set up worn balloons 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.469
 to contain this castres attack 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.600
 try to focus the fronts 1 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:02.310
 castrated studded gentleman with outstretched arm 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.530
 advantage going on the round ball and the 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.360
 maul roots but that progresses from 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.799
 seconds for Bédié we play on plays 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.060
 more with bedie who knows and from 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.920
 bypass the balloon castres defense 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.300
 over the casserole cover 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.070
 we will go back to the local penalty 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.510
 if we gave gaëtan germain after 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:19.960
 first two failures and well to reduce 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.520
 the gap at 17 to 3 at half an hour of play 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:23.320
 no problem for castrais who 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.470
 have life genuinely dominated their 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:28.420
 subject even on this melee one of the few 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.340
 but the ones on which the roots but 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.930
 have been caught out this evening it's 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.450
 one of the highlights of racing the balloon 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.010
 imhof points that makes his point speak 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.330
 speed acceleration them 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.190
 castrais coaches had to appreciate the 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.540
 performance of the Argentine who wanted to 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.800
 show in its best light against 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.690
 his future coaches unfortunately 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.310
 he loses that balloon new balloon 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.890
 recovery and in front there is also some 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.570
 talent of speed and that of brice 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.070
 dulin the French international who 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:52.750
 was making her come back as 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:54.760
 holder of the Basel is pursued there 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.140
 dock by andreu martial threw himself on 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.090
 this ball just like julien brugnaut 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.960
 studded gentleman and asks for arbitration 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.750
 video 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:04.690
 martial and sure of him on having flattened 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:07.240
 this balloon and he's right because 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.600
 yes this ball is mastered in the in 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.330
 goal 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.440
 he's tenacious and that's the third 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:13.720
 try just before half time 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:16.690
 it is the test of the offensive bonus for the 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:19.180
 castrate and the doubled for roman martial 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.590
 on this beautiful initiative of brice 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.150
 dulin even though there this balloon and maybe 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.739
 at the limit of the forward for marc 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.950
 andreu this is the half time on this score of 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:28.360
 24 to 3 for true castres only 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.350
 team on the ground Santa Claus is 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.270
 happy obelix 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:33.010
 also even if he will soon take 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:34.450
 scheer the Belgian border we remember 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:36.580
 than last year well after seven 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.709
 victories in a row and well the castrais 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:40.000
 had their series interrupted by the 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:42.100
 racing metro they do not want 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.020
 know the same disappointment then they 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:47.290
 press on the accelerator the 50th 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:48.340
 minute and the fourth essay concluded by 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.870
 seremaïa baï 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:51.640
 again the Fijian who also 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:53.830
 as a martial is offered a doubled 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:56.440
 there is only one team in the field 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:04:00.160
 turns to the demonstration of castrais 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:02.860
 31 to 3 for the double and so lease the 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:05.470
 end of the game is a little disjointed 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:08.500
 that and castrated have given a lot and 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:11.019
 the human races on this ultimate and 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.880
 new scrum and well get a try 

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:14.890
 of penalty that really rewards their 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:16.570
 dominance in this sector and its 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:17.940
 penalties to fifteen minutes from the end 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:20.489
 concludes 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:22.650
 reported by sir costed 31 to 10 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:24.240
 gonzalo quesada to little it was not going 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:25.590
 castrais them remain on an eighth 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.170
 victory in a row 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:30.150
 not sure not sure that both laurent is 

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:32.070
 appreciated the performance of their future 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.150
 team 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:34.590
 just to say without it we have a lot 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.700
 talked about the context and frankly between 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:37.110
 we did not speak the only context 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.670
 of crisis and that their opinion and racing 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.650
 had come to type me here after seven 

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:42.780
 consecutive wins 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:44.280
 we had her head and here I think that 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:45.210
 tonight we answered this and it was 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.740
 only one context that can be 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:48.180
 actively as we are at the end of 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:50.550
 contract and that we are free the end of the 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:51.860
 season we have several big projects that 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:54.180
 is offered to us one is necessarily 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:55.620
 the opponent of the day is one of them but 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.760
 but for now what we 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:59.550
 interesting as it has always been said 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:00.810
 it's the Olympic castres is no 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:03.260
 only these two is to finish well 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:05.190
 here but mostly to leave the club 

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:07.260
 but as well as we found in 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:11.090
 arriving if we can leave it better this 

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:11.090
 will be just happiness for us
