00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
come off and i think that is what gut

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.490 
come off and i think that is what gut
instinct<00:00:44.820> is<00:00:44.879> all<00:00:45.059> about<00:00:45.360> i<00:00:45.390> think<00:00:45.600> captain's

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
instinct is all about i think captain's

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.220 
instinct is all about i think captain's
need<00:00:46.739> to<00:00:46.890> go<00:00:47.579> by<00:00:47.760> their<00:00:47.969> gut<00:00:48.149> instinct<00:00:48.629> if<00:00:48.750> they

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
need to go by their gut instinct if they

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.850 
need to go by their gut instinct if they
wait<00:00:49.500> even<00:00:49.800> an<00:00:50.070> over<00:00:50.610> or<00:00:50.820> two<00:00:51.570> to<00:00:52.140> act<00:00:52.379> upon<00:00:52.710> the

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
wait even an over or two to act upon the

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.010 
wait even an over or two to act upon the
gut<00:00:53.039> instinct<00:00:53.640> moving<00:00:54.180> a<00:00:54.270> fielder<00:00:54.629> from<00:00:54.750> one

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
gut instinct moving a fielder from one

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.139 
gut instinct moving a fielder from one
place<00:00:55.260> to<00:00:55.289> another<00:00:55.469> making<00:00:56.460> a<00:00:56.550> bowling<00:00:56.879> change

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
place to another making a bowling change

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.720 
place to another making a bowling change
if<00:00:57.329> they<00:00:57.480> wait<00:00:57.690> even<00:00:57.960> for<00:00:58.079> one<00:00:58.469> over<00:00:59.010> that

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
if they wait even for one over that

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.119 
if they wait even for one over that
gutting<00:01:00.270> instinct<00:01:00.870> at<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.140> moment<00:01:01.559> is<00:01:01.710> gone

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
gutting instinct at the moment is gone

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.609 
gutting instinct at the moment is gone
and<00:01:02.430> i<00:01:02.910> think<00:01:03.120> that<00:01:03.539> is<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.809> beauty<00:01:04.170> about<00:01:04.199> the

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.289 
and i think that is the beauty about the
magazine<00:01:04.799> though<00:01:05.189> his<00:01:05.369> captaincy<00:01:05.790> is<00:01:06.150> the

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299

fact that he has got this fantastic

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.300 
fact that he has got this fantastic
gut<00:01:08.939> instinct<00:01:09.420> he<00:01:09.630> acts<00:01:09.869> on<00:01:10.140> it<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:10.500> more

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310

when you see the flow of the tournament

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.340 
when you see the flow of the tournament
you<00:01:47.970> see<00:01:48.149> in<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.329> flow<00:01:48.540> of<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.780> tournament<00:01:49.229> is

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
you see in the flow of the tournament is

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.139 
you see in the flow of the tournament is
jean-charles<00:01:49.560> NACO<00:01:50.369> picking<00:01:50.700> up<00:01:50.759> a<00:01:50.880> wicked

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
jean-charles NACO picking up a wicked

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.060 
jean-charles NACO picking up a wicked
after<00:01:51.750> bowling<00:01:52.020> a<00:01:52.079> couple<00:01:52.350> of<00:01:52.439> bad<00:01:52.590> deliveries

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
after bowling a couple of bad deliveries

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.760 
after bowling a couple of bad deliveries
so<00:01:53.640> that<00:01:53.880> is<00:01:54.030> exactly<00:01:54.509> what<00:01:54.720> happened<00:01:55.079> he<00:01:55.170> was

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
so that is exactly what happened he was

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.380 
so that is exactly what happened he was
hit<00:01:56.100> for<00:01:56.280> a<00:01:56.310> six<00:01:56.369> he<00:01:56.790> bowled<00:01:56.969> a<00:01:57.060> couple<00:01:57.299> of

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
hit for a six he bowled a couple of

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.539 
hit for a six he bowled a couple of
whites<00:01:57.600> and<00:01:57.990> then<00:01:58.409> he<00:01:58.469> took<00:01:58.649> wickets<00:01:59.430> of

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
whites and then he took wickets of

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.880 
whites and then he took wickets of
consecutive<00:01:59.969> deliveries<00:02:00.540> so<00:02:01.110> I<00:02:01.320> think<00:02:01.500> it<00:02:01.770> was

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
consecutive deliveries so I think it was

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.859 
consecutive deliveries so I think it was
the<00:02:02.040> flow<00:02:02.340> of<00:02:02.369> the<00:02:02.640> tournament<00:02:03.119> by<00:02:03.630> which

here<00:06:08.720> this<00:06:09.320> is<00:06:09.530> because<00:06:09.980> it<00:06:10.520> was<00:06:10.850> England<00:06:11.810> has

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:11.990 
here this is because it was England has

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:21.770 
day after and that is the reason that

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:23.710 
day after and that is the reason that
they<00:06:21.890> could<00:06:22.070> not<00:06:22.190> have<00:06:22.430> this<00:06:22.550> reserve<00:06:22.940> day<00:06:23.180> now

they could not have this reserve day now
this<00:06:23.960> is<00:06:24.110> strange<00:06:24.740> I<00:06:25.040> mean<00:06:25.430> with<00:06:25.580> what<00:06:25.790> it

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:25.940 
this is strange I mean with what it

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:29.170 
this is strange I mean with what it
tells<00:06:26.150> you<00:06:26.360> is<00:06:26.510> that<00:06:26.630> a<00:06:27.169> board<00:06:28.070> is<00:06:28.550> giving<00:06:28.970> more

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:29.180 
tells you is that a board is giving more

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:31.600
