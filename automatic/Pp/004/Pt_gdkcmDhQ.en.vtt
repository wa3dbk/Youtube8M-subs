comfortable<00:01:35.369> feel<00:01:35.790> but<00:01:36.270> it<00:01:36.360> does<00:01:36.570> add<00:01:36.600> some

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
comfortable feel but it does add some

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.140 
comfortable feel but it does add some
extra<00:01:37.320> bezel<00:01:37.799> to<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.009> edges<00:01:38.400> which<00:01:38.939> if<00:01:39.060> you're

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
extra bezel to the edges which if you're

of<00:01:40.229> look<00:01:40.409> and<00:01:40.590> feel<00:01:40.740> makes<00:01:41.490> it<00:01:41.670> a<00:01:41.790> little<00:01:42.030> bit

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210
