00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:03.360
 has been hit since eleven past eleven on Wednesday evening 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.160
 p on fire in the air 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.559
 you can if and share is in the air 24 hours a day for the next 6 days 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:11.869
 and that means carnival music 

00:00:11.869 --> 00:00:14.299
 mentioned a lot as music 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:19.000
 i'll hear you in breda breda against nac breda but i got it all over there 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.080
 much changed in 2009 by our editors 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:28.150
 readers' contribution can no longer be counted on part of the bell a year earlier 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:32.480
 Some thirty years ago radio was born. The Netherlands was a pirate channel 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:34.649
 after disappearing for a few years 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.630
 brecht was given a new lease of life in 2004 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:42.240
 since our weapons and they can make a false start because the 3js so the mood is there 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:43.430
 also good at it 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:44.800
 9 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.950
 I have to say well watch every little program offer 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:50.900
 the 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.950
 the company is active immediately after the incident 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:57.600
 that is between a final decision i definitely want that the leader at team 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.660
 way too much happen 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:04.050
 brussels after 2 hours and so you can watch the tricks and after that I will be one 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:08.030
 little years lawyer showed that it turned out as well as four tests round of it 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.030
 number falls so is not really 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.620
 You also need a little things outside of the reporting car that is in between or the 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.520
 banks with on location 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.160
 then it was agreed 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.250
 the hard core of six dies have been doing this together for years 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.240
 besides that they all love carnival hits 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:27.619
 make this radio 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:28.979
 become more than a hobby 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.270
 it's the majority of our who have a past with the local broadcaster 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:38.080
 it is about children with their fingers in that search is the currently i want them 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:39.330
 fifteen minutes too 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:42.330
 still a programming but in the coming channel 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:44.100
 in Belgium 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.280
 so that the hustle and bustle of the radio and the rest of us that's actually alone 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.280
 but radio was allowed to be made and the rest of the year was appointed 

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:55.580
 In addition to the golden old carnival hits, the DJ is naturally looking for 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.570
 new songs to play on radio peelland this argument spontaneous striptease 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:01.530
 controlled 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.390
 in the event of a difference between these cases that are specialized in cables 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.610
 plates that the game rules though 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.910
 so all in all it is still some work to find because this year more than 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.309
 180 new numbers 

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:16.909
 Also group 8 from primary school De Linde Lommer came over to take a look at 

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:17.750
 the studio 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.999
 and it can still affect it 

00:02:19.999 --> 00:02:24.139
 but sometimes a very good earth will fall in the coming four weeks 

00:02:24.139 --> 00:02:26.309
 long after the defeat in Ghent 

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:31.500
 what could be nicer than it was initially fine 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.259
 then it will be all right 

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:36.429
 that was intended to prevent this from being forced to leave and 

00:02:36.429 --> 00:02:39.729
 threatened why the radio is expected, reported the fire department 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:44.579
 I was ready for what was allowed and there are in Groningen 

00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:50.839
 looks from April 12 there are numerous standing there 

00:02:52.399 --> 00:02:56.269
 a lot of success in his later life there was always something withheld
