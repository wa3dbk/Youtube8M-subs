00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:35.840 
Klingons are a very traditional race if

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.410 
Klingons are a very traditional race if
they<00:00:36.079> do<00:00:36.260> Klingon<00:00:36.680> toasting<00:00:37.190> they<00:00:38.059> always

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:38.420 
they do Klingon toasting they always

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.810 
they do Klingon toasting they always
have<00:00:38.780> the<00:00:39.289> Proverbs<00:00:39.769> and<00:00:40.039> I<00:00:40.129> need<00:00:40.340> to<00:00:40.460> be<00:00:40.579> used

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:40.820 
have the Proverbs and I need to be used

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.270 
have the Proverbs and I need to be used
correctly<00:00:41.359> you<00:00:42.079> cannot<00:00:42.320> just<00:00:42.620> go<00:00:42.680> ahead<00:00:42.949> and

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:43.280 
correctly you cannot just go ahead and

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.939 
correctly you cannot just go ahead and
say<00:00:43.489> okay<00:00:44.149> let's<00:00:44.570> drink<00:00:44.960> to<00:00:45.230> your<00:00:45.379> health<00:00:45.649> or

00:00:45.939 --> 00:00:45.949 
say okay let's drink to your health or

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:49.689 
say okay let's drink to your health or
so<00:00:46.239> it's<00:00:47.239> just<00:00:47.539> not<00:00:47.750> the<00:00:48.379> way<00:00:48.500> it<00:00:48.620> is<00:00:48.739> Klingons

00:00:49.689 --> 00:00:49.699 
so it's just not the way it is Klingons

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:52.029 
so it's just not the way it is Klingons
have<00:00:49.760> very<00:00:50.089> strange<00:00:50.629> expressions<00:00:51.289> but<00:00:51.890> you

00:00:52.029 --> 00:00:52.039 
have very strange expressions but you

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:54.790 
have very strange expressions but you
need<00:00:52.219> to<00:00:52.339> know<00:00:52.370> them<00:00:52.670> so<00:00:53.449> one<00:00:54.350> of<00:00:54.469> the<00:00:54.589> most

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:54.800
