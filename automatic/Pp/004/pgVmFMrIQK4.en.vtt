00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:04.469 
watch the volume knob on the stereo and
not<00:02:01.539> kill<00:02:01.840> it<00:02:01.990> until<00:02:02.950> I<00:02:02.979> get<00:02:03.219> a<00:02:03.579> higher<00:02:04.119> power

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:04.479 
not kill it until I get a higher power

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:08.550 
not kill it until I get a higher power
replacement<00:02:05.350> so<00:02:05.709> good<00:02:06.459> news<00:02:06.610> anyway<00:02:07.140> it's<00:02:08.140> not

the new amplifier which is good so and
continue<00:02:10.959> with<00:02:11.470> my<00:02:11.680> capacitor<00:02:12.640> hookup<00:02:13.360> on

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
continue with my capacitor hookup on

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.990 
continue with my capacitor hookup on
there<00:02:13.810> as<00:02:14.170> we<00:02:15.040> got<00:02:15.130> a<00:02:15.190> bit<00:02:15.400> of<00:02:15.430> blinking
