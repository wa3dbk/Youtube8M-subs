today I will show you how the mapping

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.999 
today I will show you how the mapping

example our character is using eight
mouth<00:00:19.650> positions<00:00:20.250> so<00:00:21.180> we<00:00:21.330> have<00:00:21.510> the<00:00:21.750> closed

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
mouth positions so we have the closed

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.599 
mouth positions so we have the closed
mouth<00:00:23.060> MBP<00:00:24.289> one<00:00:25.289> for<00:00:25.560> all<00:00:25.680> of<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:25.920> consonants

mouth MBP one for all of the consonants

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:34.610 
mouth MBP one for all of the consonants
then<00:00:27.510> we<00:00:27.720> have<00:00:27.930> the<00:00:28.140> e<00:00:28.170> ay<00:00:29.390> u<00:00:30.390> FV<00:00:31.160> and<00:00:32.160> L<00:00:33.590> what<00:00:34.590> I

to change the default settings and

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.799 
to change the default settings and
create<00:00:39.629> new<00:00:39.660> mouth<00:00:40.079> positions<00:00:41.120> so<00:00:42.120> go<00:00:42.480> into

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
create new mouth positions so go into

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.619 
create new mouth positions so go into
the<00:00:42.930> phony<00:00:43.230> mapping<00:00:43.860> section<00:00:44.190> and<00:00:44.579> in<00:00:45.420> this

allowing you to customize your own
visine<00:01:02.149> let's<00:01:03.149> create<00:01:03.420> a<00:01:03.480> new<00:01:03.570> visine<00:01:04.170> and

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
visine let's create a new visine and

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.929 
visine let's create a new visine and
name<00:01:04.979> it<00:01:05.129> oh<00:01:06.350> this<00:01:07.350> ova<00:01:08.189> seem<00:01:08.490> we'll<00:01:08.729> regroup

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
name it oh this ova seem we'll regroup

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.510 
name it oh this ova seem we'll regroup
three<00:01:09.510> different<00:01:09.869> phonemes<00:01:10.220> whom<00:01:11.220> as<00:01:11.369> you

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
three different phonemes whom as you

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.130 
three different phonemes whom as you
will<00:01:11.640> notice<00:01:11.909> don't<00:01:12.360> sound<00:01:12.689> so<00:01:12.930> different

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
will notice don't sound so different

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:20.469 
will notice don't sound so different
after<00:01:13.470> all<00:01:13.680> let's<00:01:14.580> have<00:01:14.790> a<00:01:14.820> listen<00:01:16.070> odd<00:01:17.930> go<00:01:19.400> toy

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:20.479 
after all let's have a listen odd go toy

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:23.120 
after all let's have a listen odd go toy
you<00:01:21.479> will<00:01:21.600> also<00:01:21.780> notice<00:01:22.229> in<00:01:22.619> addition<00:01:23.009> to

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
you will also notice in addition to

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.429 
you will also notice in addition to
hearing<00:01:23.490> an<00:01:23.610> audible<00:01:24.030> cue<00:01:24.390> that<00:01:25.080> we<00:01:25.229> have<00:01:25.409> a

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
hearing an audible cue that we have a

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.679 
hearing an audible cue that we have a
visual<00:01:25.770> tool<00:01:26.250> tip<00:01:26.520> indicating<00:01:27.390> what<00:01:27.540> the

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
visual tool tip indicating what the

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.910 
visual tool tip indicating what the
individual<00:01:28.350> phonemes<00:01:28.890> relate<00:01:29.340> to<00:01:30.799> so<00:01:31.799> we

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
individual phonemes relate to so we

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.130 
individual phonemes relate to so we
created<00:01:32.280> a<00:01:32.460> new<00:01:32.640> visine<00:01:33.150> family<00:01:33.630> called<00:01:33.960> oh

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
created a new visine family called oh

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.690 
created a new visine family called oh
and<00:01:34.560> this<00:01:35.189> family<00:01:35.430> regroups<00:01:36.119> three<00:01:36.540> phonemes

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
and this family regroups three phonemes

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.460 
and this family regroups three phonemes
the<00:01:38.700> idea<00:01:39.030> is<00:01:39.210> that<00:01:39.240> you<00:01:39.450> can<00:01:39.659> go<00:01:39.840> in<00:01:39.990> any<00:01:40.259> of

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
the idea is that you can go in any of

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.530 
the idea is that you can go in any of
the<00:01:40.590> vibes<00:01:41.100> and<00:01:41.340> change<00:01:41.670> any<00:01:41.970> phoneme

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
the vibes and change any phoneme

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.830 
the vibes and change any phoneme
assigned<00:01:42.960> by<00:01:43.200> default<00:01:44.210> back<00:01:45.210> to<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.540> visine

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
assigned by default back to the visine

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.260 
assigned by default back to the visine
mapping<00:01:46.500> we<00:01:46.979> can<00:01:47.159> see<00:01:47.340> that<00:01:47.460> we<00:01:47.610> have<00:01:47.790> this<00:01:48.000> new

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
mapping we can see that we have this new

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.620 
mapping we can see that we have this new
0<00:01:48.450> YZ<00:01:48.990> but<00:01:49.979> it<00:01:50.070> is<00:01:50.220> not<00:01:50.399> being<00:01:50.700> assigned<00:01:51.119> to<00:01:51.509> an

0 YZ but it is not being assigned to an

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.530 
0 YZ but it is not being assigned to an
image<00:01:52.040> so<00:01:53.040> we<00:01:53.159> can<00:01:53.310> simply<00:01:53.729> double<00:01:54.090> click<00:01:54.119> to

select<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:55.079> mouth<00:01:55.259> we<00:01:55.530> want<00:01:55.740> to<00:01:55.920> use<00:01:55.950> I<00:01:57.950> will

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
select the mouth we want to use I will

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.190 
select the mouth we want to use I will
simply<00:01:59.340> use<00:01:59.369> the<00:01:59.610> oh<00:01:59.820> math<00:02:00.360> position<00:02:00.899> that<00:02:01.079> was
