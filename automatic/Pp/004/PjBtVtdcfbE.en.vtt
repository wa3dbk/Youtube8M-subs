tennis<00:00:17.940> we<00:00:18.090> have<00:00:18.240> spin<00:00:18.660> meaning<00:00:19.320> you<00:00:19.830> go

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
tennis we have spin meaning you go

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.560 
tennis we have spin meaning you go
through<00:00:20.220> the<00:00:20.310> fall<00:00:20.580> and<00:00:20.789> you<00:00:21.000> make<00:00:21.210> the<00:00:21.359> ball

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
through the fall and you make the ball

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.390 
through the fall and you make the ball
spin<00:00:21.600> like<00:00:22.410> this<00:00:23.480> however<00:00:24.480> sometimes<00:00:25.400> the

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
spin like this however sometimes the

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.200 
spin like this however sometimes the
alignment<00:00:26.939> of<00:00:27.000> the<00:00:27.150> racket<00:00:27.510> can<00:00:27.599> go<00:00:27.779> wrong<00:00:28.109> and

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:29.210 
alignment of the racket can go wrong and

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:31.519 
alignment of the racket can go wrong and
when<00:00:30.210> the<00:00:30.449> alignment<00:00:30.869> goes<00:00:31.019> wrong<00:00:31.320> what

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
when the alignment goes wrong what

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.560 
when the alignment goes wrong what
happens<00:00:31.890> is<00:00:32.040> that<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.309> racket<00:00:32.669> face<00:00:32.850> changes

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
happens is that the racket face changes

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.549 
happens is that the racket face changes
angle<00:00:34.140> too<00:00:34.590> fast<00:00:35.660> upside<00:00:36.660> down<00:00:36.870> or<00:00:37.110> sometimes

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
angle too fast upside down or sometimes

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.520 
angle too fast upside down or sometimes
it<00:00:37.680> actually<00:00:37.920> changes<00:00:38.219> angle<00:00:38.640> and<00:00:39.230> it<00:00:40.230> opens

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
it actually changes angle and it opens

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.430 
it actually changes angle and it opens
up<00:00:40.649> either<00:00:41.460> way<00:00:41.820> it's<00:00:42.120> no<00:00:42.270> good<00:00:42.480> now<00:00:42.750> to<00:00:43.200> work

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
up either way it's no good now to work

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.500 
up either way it's no good now to work
on<00:00:43.710> proper<00:00:44.219> or<00:00:44.430> perfect<00:00:44.700> alignment<00:00:45.090> with<00:00:45.360> the

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
on proper or perfect alignment with the

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.360 
on proper or perfect alignment with the
Tuscan<00:00:45.870> boom<00:00:46.020> rapport<00:00:46.410> what<00:00:46.860> you<00:00:46.980> do<00:00:47.160> is<00:00:47.340> that

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
Tuscan boom rapport what you do is that

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.360 
Tuscan boom rapport what you do is that
you<00:00:47.579> can<00:00:47.730> use<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.090> edge<00:00:48.420> of<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:49.050> board<00:00:49.289> to<00:00:50.100> run

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
you can use the edge of the board to run

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.590 
you can use the edge of the board to run
the<00:00:50.520> racket<00:00:50.910> through<00:00:51.180> what<00:00:52.309> you<00:00:53.309> see<00:00:53.489> this<00:00:53.670> by

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
the racket through what you see this by

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.450 
the racket through what you see this by
this<00:00:56.210> angle<00:00:57.210> and<00:00:57.500> this<00:00:58.500> is<00:00:58.680> a<00:00:58.829> great<00:00:59.190> exercise

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
this angle and this is a great exercise

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.110 
this angle and this is a great exercise
to<00:00:59.730> do<00:01:00.149> that<00:01:00.840> will<00:01:01.020> prove<00:01:01.440> you<00:01:01.649> gain<00:01:02.120> nearly

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
to do that will prove you gain nearly

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.340 
to do that will prove you gain nearly
immediately<00:01:03.809> but<00:01:04.409> it's<00:01:04.559> practicing<00:01:05.159> this<00:01:05.309> I

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
immediately but it's practicing this I

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.410 
immediately but it's practicing this I
love<00:01:07.350> doing<00:01:07.650> this<00:01:07.770> exercise<00:01:08.310> again<00:01:08.670> it<00:01:09.150> is<00:01:09.299> an

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
love doing this exercise again it is an

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.080 
love doing this exercise again it is an
exercise<00:01:09.869> on<00:01:09.900> racket<00:01:10.470> around<00:01:10.950> it<00:01:11.189> right

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
exercise on racket around it right

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.030 
exercise on racket around it right
notice<00:01:12.570> how<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.750> racket<00:01:13.260> cannot<00:01:13.710> change

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
notice how the racket cannot change

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.300 
notice how the racket cannot change
angle<00:01:14.729> now<00:01:15.360> I'm<00:01:15.960> not<00:01:16.259> getting<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.619> benefit<00:01:17.159> of

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
angle now I'm not getting the benefit of

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.850 
angle now I'm not getting the benefit of
the<00:01:17.820> spin<00:01:18.270> when<00:01:18.869> I<00:01:18.900> work<00:01:19.259> on<00:01:19.409> rack<00:01:19.650> and

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
the spin when I work on rack and

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.969 
the spin when I work on rack and
alignment<00:01:20.310> nonetheless<00:01:21.590> there<00:01:22.590> are<00:01:22.710> two

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
alignment nonetheless there are two

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.090 
alignment nonetheless there are two
separate<00:01:23.549> elements<00:01:23.780> of<00:01:24.780> a<00:01:25.229> tennis<00:01:25.650> player<00:01:25.860> or

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
over forehand or backhand alignment is

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.640 
over forehand or backhand alignment is
one<00:01:28.950> thing<00:01:29.189> and<00:01:29.369> spin<00:01:30.270> which<00:01:30.750> relates<00:01:31.140> to<00:01:31.229> feel

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
one thing and spin which relates to feel

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.770 
one thing and spin which relates to feel
is<00:01:32.130> a<00:01:32.280> completely<00:01:32.820> different<00:01:33.000> thing<00:01:33.210> again

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
is a completely different thing again

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.340 
is a completely different thing again
watch<00:01:34.049> racket<00:01:34.890> alignment<00:01:36.170> grab<00:01:37.170> the

going a lot into the net chances are

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.530 
going a lot into the net chances are
good<00:01:43.560> that<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:44.310> racket<00:01:44.909> that<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.299> ball<00:01:45.509> is

you<00:01:54.990> should<00:01:55.200> do<00:01:55.320> this<00:01:55.409> exercise<00:01:55.950> on<00:01:55.979> average

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:56.580 
you should do this exercise on average

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.090 
you should do this exercise on average
50<00:01:57.420> times<00:01:57.659> so<00:01:57.930> I'm<00:01:58.049> going<00:01:58.170> to<00:01:58.259> do<00:01:58.409> it<00:01:58.530> let's<00:01:58.950> say

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
50 times so I'm going to do it let's say

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.969 
50 times so I'm going to do it let's say
5<00:01:59.400> times<00:01:59.700> for<00:02:00.000> you<00:02:00.090> just<00:02:00.479> to<00:02:00.630> run<00:02:01.409> your<00:02:01.560> lawn

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
5 times for you just to run your lawn

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:07.910 
5 times for you just to run your lawn
that's<00:02:02.700> three<00:02:04.280> four<00:02:05.540> in<00:02:06.540> five<00:02:07.080> notice<00:02:07.830> that

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
that's three four in five notice that

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.279 
that's three four in five notice that
when<00:02:08.069> I<00:02:08.100> do<00:02:08.280> that<00:02:08.310> exercise<00:02:08.700> I<00:02:09.179> keep<00:02:09.690> the

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
when I do that exercise I keep the

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.010 
when I do that exercise I keep the
racket<00:02:10.890> right<00:02:11.610> on<00:02:11.790> the<00:02:11.880> edge<00:02:12.060> of<00:02:12.420> the<00:02:12.780> board
