00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.600
 when I convinced my manager of 

00:00:05.529 --> 00:00:10.540
 television then federico 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:14.620

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:18.520
 I wanted to give to another person and I wanted to 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:22.359
 I was just the journalist director 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:24.550
 at that time I prepared for something in 

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:27.760
 what I trusted in what I always 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:29.840
 I 'm so close that I always want to 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:34.310
 be the best 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:37.280
 and here I am after 15 years 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:40.580
 the only thing I think I have wanted in the 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:42.650
 life is that people laugh with me that 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:45.230

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:47.650
 They were to follow more than one season this 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:50.960
 has exceeded all my expectations 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:53.290
 when I went to jail four years ago 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.290
 years 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:59.170
 I wanted to leave everything and everyone 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:01.930
 know why you think nothing in this 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:04.299
 life was worth taking my freedom and 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:07.570
 that will affect my family however 

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:10.180
 the great affection of the public convinced me 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.500
 that I should go ahead and 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.950
 I do not regret 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:17.190
 absolutely nothing and I say it with the 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.840
 head up I do not regret 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:23.229
 absolutely nothing because yesterday 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:26.380
 example yesterday a man who has lived 50 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:31.840
 years away from Peru who do not know his 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:34.210
 name approached me hugged me and cried and 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.360
 he told me all my life I loved 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:40.360
 I have suffered with you when 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:44.159
 US was seeing in jail I 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:48.270
 cried with you and hugged me and cried 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:50.880
 I can never understand he said that I have 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.880
 given me to you so that someone 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.240
 thrill in that way 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:58.670
 I'm never going to 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:03.259
 cerebrally 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:05.380
 I did think that something good was 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:08.619
 be returned 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.929
 really be here doing 15 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:13.420
 years and closing a chapter of my life 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:15.610
 as you just wrote from a person to 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.980
 which I love very much this is the first 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:20.810
 day of a new stage 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:23.090
 I just saw my parents go 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:26.380
 and there is something that I have always said 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:30.550
 I've always wanted my father dad 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:33.630
 You feel proud childhood 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.630
 and have achieved it
