00:02:44.959 --> 00:03:16.440 
should go on the fifth fret of the D
string<00:02:46.719> and<00:02:47.799> then<00:02:50.109> bring<00:02:51.109> your<00:02:51.139> pinkie<00:02:51.590> off<00:02:51.620> so

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:28.179 

so<00:03:17.450> 0<00:03:18.260> to<00:03:18.769> 2<00:03:19.400> 45<00:03:25.810> then<00:03:26.810> back<00:03:27.379> to<00:03:27.590> 2<00:03:27.769> and<00:03:27.799> up<00:03:28.040> to

00:03:28.179 --> 00:03:28.189 
so 0 to 2 45 then back to 2 and up to

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:36.520 
so 0 to 2 45 then back to 2 and up to
four<00:03:28.370> again<00:03:32.920> and<00:03:34.000> then<00:03:35.019> this<00:03:36.019> parts<00:03:36.319> a<00:03:36.379> bit

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
four again and then this parts a bit

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.339 
four again and then this parts a bit
easier<00:03:36.829> you<00:03:37.489> just<00:03:37.519> play<00:03:37.879> the<00:03:38.329> lowest<00:03:39.109> two

00:03:39.339 --> 00:03:39.349 
easier you just play the lowest two

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:41.920 
easier you just play the lowest two
strings<00:03:39.709> without<00:03:40.129> any<00:03:40.519> any<00:03:40.939> frets<00:03:41.299> for<00:03:41.810> this

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
strings without any any frets for this

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:54.399 
strings without any any frets for this
one<00:03:52.269> but<00:03:53.269> you<00:03:53.389> keep<00:03:53.540> this<00:03:53.810> finger<00:03:54.169> on<00:03:54.290> the

00:03:54.399 --> 00:03:54.409 
one but you keep this finger on the

00:03:54.409 --> 00:04:03.810 
one but you keep this finger on the
fourth<00:03:54.620> fret<00:03:54.769> of<00:03:54.889> the<00:03:55.209> D<00:03:56.209> string

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:03.820 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:07.600 

then<00:04:04.820> that<00:04:05.120> five<00:04:05.450> again<00:04:05.840> and<00:04:06.320> then<00:04:07.250> the<00:04:07.370> four

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:07.610 
then that five again and then the four

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:20.560 
then that five again and then the four
again<00:04:18.489> then<00:04:19.489> this<00:04:19.610> part<00:04:19.820> gets<00:04:19.970> a<00:04:20.090> bit<00:04:20.209> harder

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:20.570 
again then this part gets a bit harder

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:23.290 
again then this part gets a bit harder
way<00:04:21.290> it's<00:04:21.590> the<00:04:21.830> same<00:04:22.010> fingering<00:04:22.490> as<00:04:22.760> the<00:04:23.090> two

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.300 
way it's the same fingering as the two

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:27.280 
way it's the same fingering as the two
to<00:04:23.480> four<00:04:23.840> but<00:04:24.830> this<00:04:25.010> time<00:04:25.220> it's<00:04:25.810> 557<00:04:26.810> going

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:27.290 
to four but this time it's 557 going

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:35.320 
to four but this time it's 557 going
from<00:04:27.650> lowest<00:04:28.160> to<00:04:28.220> highest<00:04:28.720> so<00:04:33.700> 557<00:04:34.700> just<00:04:35.180> like

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
from lowest to highest so 557 just like

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:39.910 
from lowest to highest so 557 just like
that<00:04:35.510> just<00:04:35.540> like<00:04:35.840> that<00:04:35.930> I<00:04:38.860> realized<00:04:39.860> you

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:39.920 
that just like that I realized you

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:41.410 
that just like that I realized you
should<00:04:40.100> probably<00:04:40.250> be<00:04:40.550> using<00:04:40.700> a<00:04:40.910> better<00:04:41.090> camera

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:41.420 
should probably be using a better camera

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:45.340 
should probably be using a better camera
but<00:04:43.030> you<00:04:44.030> I<00:04:44.330> hope<00:04:44.540> I<00:04:44.690> hope<00:04:44.810> you<00:04:44.990> get<00:04:45.140> the<00:04:45.230> gist

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:45.350 
but you I hope I hope you get the gist

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:53.410 
but you I hope I hope you get the gist
of<00:04:45.500> that<00:04:49.030> but<00:04:50.030> then<00:04:50.300> you<00:04:50.390> go<00:04:50.510> back<00:04:50.540> you<00:04:51.350> go<00:04:52.420> 557

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:53.420 
of that but then you go back you go 557

00:04:53.420 --> 00:05:06.610 
of that but then you go back you go 557
and<00:04:53.870> then<00:05:00.880> okay<00:05:01.880> so<00:05:02.420> you<00:05:02.510> go<00:05:03.400> 557<00:05:05.140> then<00:05:06.140> back<00:05:06.410> to

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:06.620 
and then okay so you go 557 then back to

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:12.670 
and then okay so you go 557 then back to
the<00:05:06.820> back<00:05:07.820> to<00:05:08.030> the<00:05:08.150> five<00:05:10.720> then<00:05:11.720> then<00:05:12.530> you

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:12.680 
the back to the five then then you

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.370 
the back to the five then then you
remove<00:05:12.980> the<00:05:13.370> finger<00:05:13.700> from<00:05:13.850> the<00:05:13.970> seven<00:05:14.330> and<00:05:14.510> put

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:15.380 
remove the finger from the seven and put

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:18.640 
remove the finger from the seven and put
and<00:05:15.560> bar<00:05:16.130> again<00:05:16.760> as<00:05:16.970> I<00:05:17.180> said<00:05:17.230> bar<00:05:18.230> the<00:05:18.440> three

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:18.650 
and bar again as I said bar the three

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:26.340 
and bar again as I said bar the three
strings<00:05:21.610> so<00:05:22.610> what<00:05:22.760> should<00:05:22.880> sound<00:05:23.060> like<00:05:23.150> that

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:26.350 

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:32.920 

then<00:05:27.350> put<00:05:27.560> the<00:05:27.650> stuff<00:05:27.830> in<00:05:27.860> back<00:05:28.130> on<00:05:31.750> then<00:05:32.750> this

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:32.930 
then put the stuff in back on then this

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:34.570 
then put the stuff in back on then this
next<00:05:33.230> part<00:05:33.470> you<00:05:33.590> actually<00:05:33.920> have<00:05:34.010> to<00:05:34.100> skip<00:05:34.370> over

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:34.580 
next part you actually have to skip over

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:38.560 
next part you actually have to skip over
a<00:05:34.730> string<00:05:35.090> so<00:05:36.130> while<00:05:37.130> having<00:05:37.550> your<00:05:37.970> fingers<00:05:38.360> on

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:38.570 
a string so while having your fingers on

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:46.150 
a string so while having your fingers on
the<00:05:39.320> high<00:05:39.530> E<00:05:39.560> on<00:05:40.150> the<00:05:41.150> D<00:05:41.630> string<00:05:42.550> you<00:05:43.660> go<00:05:45.160> you

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:46.160 
the high E on the D string you go you

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.100 
the high E on the D string you go you
skip<00:05:46.490> the<00:05:46.760> a<00:05:46.790> string<00:05:47.240> and<00:05:47.360> go<00:05:47.510> right<00:05:47.660> back<00:05:47.690> to

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:48.110 
skip the a string and go right back to

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:52.240 
skip the a string and go right back to
the<00:05:48.200> low<00:05:48.380> E<00:05:48.520> by

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:52.250 

00:05:52.250 --> 00:06:04.060 

that<00:05:58.190> seven<00:05:59.900> open<00:06:00.900> E<00:06:00.990> string<00:06:01.340> 5<00:06:02.690> open<00:06:03.690> E<00:06:03.750> string

have um I'm still having a little bit of
problem<00:06:15.060> with<00:06:15.300> timing<00:06:16.050> on<00:06:16.169> this<00:06:16.290> rift<00:06:16.560> because

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:16.950 
problem with timing on this rift because

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:19.700 
problem with timing on this rift because
I<00:06:17.100> learned<00:06:17.250> it<00:06:17.490> in<00:06:17.580> a<00:06:17.700> hurry<00:06:17.910> but<00:06:18.750> um<00:06:19.080> I<00:06:19.380> hope<00:06:19.620> I

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:19.710 
I learned it in a hurry but um I hope I

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:21.470 
I learned it in a hurry but um I hope I
helped<00:06:19.889> you<00:06:20.010> just<00:06:20.880> by<00:06:21.000> looking<00:06:21.330> at<00:06:21.389> the

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:21.480 
helped you just by looking at the

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:22.970 
helped you just by looking at the
fingering<00:06:21.870> sometimes<00:06:22.290> it<00:06:22.440> helps<00:06:22.560> it<00:06:22.830> helps

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:22.980 
fingering sometimes it helps it helps

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:26.420 
fingering sometimes it helps it helps
more<00:06:23.250> than<00:06:23.310> a<00:06:23.430> tab<00:06:23.730> but<00:06:24.560> I'm<00:06:25.560> including<00:06:26.160> tabs
