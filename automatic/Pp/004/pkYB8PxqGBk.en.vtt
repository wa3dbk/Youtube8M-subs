the<00:02:46.380> Downloads<00:02:46.709> might<00:02:46.860> be<00:02:46.950> a<00:02:46.980> little<00:02:47.100> bit<00:02:47.250> slow

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
the Downloads might be a little bit slow

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.640 
the Downloads might be a little bit slow
I<00:02:47.730> think<00:02:48.030> the<00:02:48.120> servers<00:02:48.420> are<00:02:48.630> from<00:02:48.870> China<00:02:49.230> so<00:02:49.470> if

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
I think the servers are from China so if

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.530 
I think the servers are from China so if
you're<00:02:49.800> from<00:02:49.980> another<00:02:50.100> country<00:02:50.540> the

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
you're from another country the

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:52.610 
you're from another country the

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
the spot on the dad and applying the

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.850 
the spot on the dad and applying the
theme<00:03:38.640> oh<00:03:38.820> man<00:03:39.420> it's<00:03:39.540> done<00:03:39.690> I<00:03:39.720> believe<00:03:39.860> and

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:40.860 
theme oh man it's done I believe and

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:42.080 
theme oh man it's done I believe and
yeah<00:03:41.040> there<00:03:41.220> we<00:03:41.280> go<00:03:41.310> so<00:03:41.760> as<00:03:41.850> you<00:03:41.940> can<00:03:42.030> see

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
yeah there we go so as you can see

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.320 
yeah there we go so as you can see
that's<00:03:42.420> the<00:03:42.510> theme<00:03:42.830> really<00:03:43.830> quickly<00:03:44.190> all<00:03:45.060> the

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330 
that's the theme really quickly all the

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.600 
that's the theme really quickly all the
widgets<00:03:45.690> icons<00:03:46.260> even<00:03:46.950> the<00:03:47.040> lock<00:03:47.220> screen<00:03:47.489> I

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610 
widgets icons even the lock screen I

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:48.920 
widgets icons even the lock screen I
believe<00:03:47.640> yep<00:03:48.150> even<00:03:48.360> the<00:03:48.420> lock<00:03:48.600> screen<00:03:48.840> is

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
believe yep even the lock screen is

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.470 
believe yep even the lock screen is
different<00:03:49.370> so<00:03:50.370> it's<00:03:50.670> not<00:03:50.790> your<00:03:50.910> regular<00:03:51.120> theme

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
different so it's not your regular theme

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.180 
different so it's not your regular theme
actually<00:03:51.900> goes<00:03:52.019> really<00:03:52.410> pretty<00:03:52.590> deep<00:03:52.799> into

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
actually goes really pretty deep into

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.160 
actually goes really pretty deep into
your<00:03:53.310> settings<00:03:53.730> and<00:03:53.850> all<00:03:53.970> that<00:03:54.090> -<00:03:54.299> so<00:03:54.989> we<00:03:55.080> can

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
your settings and all that - so we can

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:57.470 
your settings and all that - so we can
go<00:03:55.260> and<00:03:55.380> unlock<00:03:55.650> it<00:03:55.890> and<00:03:56.100> we<00:03:57.090> can<00:03:57.209> go<00:03:57.330> into

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
go and unlock it and we can go into

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:58.880 
go and unlock it and we can go into
settings<00:03:57.660> and<00:03:57.930> see<00:03:58.110> if<00:03:58.170> that<00:03:58.290> changed<00:03:58.620> up<00:03:58.739> as

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
settings and see if that changed up as

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:02.800 
settings and see if that changed up as
well<00:03:59.220> so<00:03:59.459> I<00:04:00.330> believe<00:04:00.840> toggles<00:04:01.500> and<00:04:01.890> settings

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
well so I believe toggles and settings

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:05.060 
well so I believe toggles and settings
so<00:04:03.810> yeah<00:04:03.959> I<00:04:03.989> think<00:04:04.170> settings<00:04:04.620> did<00:04:04.769> change<00:04:04.980> a

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:05.070 
so yeah I think settings did change a

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:08.449 
so yeah I think settings did change a
little<00:04:05.190> bit<00:04:05.400> here<00:04:05.610> -<00:04:06.200> possibly<00:04:07.200> I<00:04:07.459> can't

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
little bit here - possibly I can't

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:10.520 
little bit here - possibly I can't
really<00:04:08.549> remember<00:04:08.840> but<00:04:09.840> we<00:04:09.930> can<00:04:10.049> go<00:04:10.170> ahead<00:04:10.260> and

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
really remember but we can go ahead and

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:12.590 
really remember but we can go ahead and
go<00:04:10.650> back<00:04:10.680> into<00:04:10.950> themes<00:04:11.220> and<00:04:11.459> let's<00:04:12.360> see<00:04:12.450> if<00:04:12.510> the

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600 
go back into themes and let's see if the

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.780 
go back into themes and let's see if the
other<00:04:12.690> one<00:04:12.900> is<00:04:13.079> done<00:04:13.590> downloading<00:04:13.739> so<00:04:14.610> we<00:04:14.670> can

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
other one is done downloading so we can

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.099 
other one is done downloading so we can
go<00:04:14.850> back<00:04:15.060> and<00:04:15.090> as<00:04:15.420> you<00:04:15.510> can<00:04:15.600> see<00:04:15.660> all<00:04:15.900> the<00:04:15.989> back

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:16.109 
go back and as you can see all the back

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:17.569 
go back and as you can see all the back
and<00:04:16.320> all<00:04:16.380> that<00:04:16.500> stuff<00:04:16.709> is<00:04:16.859> really<00:04:17.040> different<00:04:17.430> -

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:17.579 
and all that stuff is really different -

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:19.370 
and all that stuff is really different -
and<00:04:17.910> we'll<00:04:18.359> go<00:04:18.479> ahead<00:04:18.600> and<00:04:18.720> apply<00:04:19.079> the<00:04:19.140> free

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
and we'll go ahead and apply the free

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:19.969 
and we'll go ahead and apply the free
one<00:04:19.530> as<00:04:19.650> well

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:19.979 
one as well

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:21.620 
one as well
so<00:04:20.489> you<00:04:20.579> can<00:04:20.729> see<00:04:20.880> my<00:04:21.060> white<00:04:21.269> is<00:04:21.450> completely

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
so you can see my white is completely

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:24.980 
so you can see my white is completely
different<00:04:22.380> I<00:04:23.160> really<00:04:23.400> like<00:04:23.820> it<00:04:24.000> it<00:04:24.570> changes<00:04:24.840> it

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
different I really like it it changes it

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:26.000 
different I really like it it changes it
up<00:04:25.080> especially<00:04:25.380> if<00:04:25.590> you're<00:04:25.680> getting<00:04:25.770> bored
