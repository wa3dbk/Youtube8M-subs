00:00:01.567 --> 00:00:02.739
 - Yes, we get on a motorcycle. 

00:00:03.092 --> 00:00:07.098
 -I get on a motorcycle. - Yes, we're putting together a leg. 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.131
 - I put my foot on. -Maximum steering wheel to the right. 

00:00:11.644 --> 00:00:13.371
 - Something here? -We are doing nothing. 

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:17.245
 And on our feet we move backwards. 

00:00:17.245 --> 00:00:20.790
 This is one change of direction. 

00:00:23.255 --> 00:00:26.636
 We look back not to hit the line, which is important. 

00:00:26.636 --> 00:00:30.528
 Yes, now drive the wheel. 

00:00:33.156 --> 00:00:39.839
 Straighten the motorcycle and now back up on your legs so that you do not overrun ... - I can not cross the line here either, right? 

00:00:40.126 --> 00:00:45.645
 - This is the exit line, so of course we have to move all the time in this designated field. 

00:00:45.645 --> 00:00:52.914
 I would like to mention that the motorcycle can not move on the line, because we can tread the most on this line. 

00:00:55.679 --> 00:00:56.958
 - I see that it is not so difficult ... 

00:00:58.225 --> 00:01:03.581
 -This is not difficult for a man with a height of 1.75 m- 1.80 m. 

00:01:04.123 --> 00:01:10.392
 Males have the most problems, who have a problem with staying on a motorcycle. 

00:01:11.443 --> 00:01:14.975
 Slalom between goals, second, third goal very correctly. 

00:01:14.975 --> 00:01:18.407
 Fourth ... 1/3 of the job done. 

00:01:18.805 --> 00:01:21.922
 We drive ourselves in an eighth. 

00:01:23.708 --> 00:01:28.789
 There will be a five-fold passage in the eighth. 

00:01:35.037 --> 00:01:39.560
 The first eight are counted. 

00:01:46.433 --> 00:01:48.160
 The second eight are counted. 

00:01:56.596 --> 00:01:59.400
 During the third eighty it was touching the line. 

00:02:02.388 --> 00:02:03.790
 The fourth eight. 

00:02:06.732 --> 00:02:09.040
 -Which already? - fourth, go the fifth. 

00:02:21.723 --> 00:02:27.360
 We leave and on the other hand, we are back in the slalom between the gates. 

00:02:34.475 --> 00:02:38.350
 Going into the goal, please, the first bollard on the left hand side. 

00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:41.270
 And go in the goal - correctly. 

00:02:43.758 --> 00:02:50.640
 This is so-called fast slalom, it should be noted that during this task we can not knock down cones. 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:58.430
 We have no obligation to turn, but we should go on the second or third gear. 

00:03:02.956 --> 00:03:05.860
 -30 km / h it is really fast. - Quick, well. 

00:03:08.153 --> 00:03:13.200
 The minimum speed during this task is 30 km / h. 

00:03:18.936 --> 00:03:26.680
 In a moment the student will show how to perform the next exam task. 

00:03:26.992 --> 00:03:29.960
 This is called bypassing the obstacle. 

00:03:32.007 --> 00:03:41.580
 There is an entrance and exit gate, we cross the obstacle once from one side once on the other. 

00:03:41.581 --> 00:03:49.360
 It should be noted that the speed during this task should be at least 50 km / h. 

00:03:50.851 --> 00:03:55.660
 And this task is to practice the counter-turret once to the right once to the left.
