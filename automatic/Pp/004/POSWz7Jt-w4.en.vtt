hi I'm lassie and I'm back here where
the<00:00:07.540> tips<00:00:07.809> and<00:00:07.990> tricks<00:00:08.230> again<00:00:08.530> and<00:00:08.800> this<00:00:09.070> time

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:09.130 
the tips and tricks again and this time

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:11.760 
the tips and tricks again and this time
we<00:00:09.640> are<00:00:09.670> back<00:00:09.970> with<00:00:10.300> the<00:00:10.420> English<00:00:10.630> wheel<00:00:10.840> this

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:11.770 
we are back with the English wheel this

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:14.190 
we are back with the English wheel this
isn't<00:00:12.130> an<00:00:12.190> important<00:00:12.700> thing<00:00:12.910> to<00:00:13.330> remember<00:00:13.690> for

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:14.200 
isn't an important thing to remember for

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.199 
isn't an important thing to remember for
you<00:00:14.530> when<00:00:15.100> you're<00:00:15.250> using<00:00:15.460> your<00:00:15.610> English<00:00:16.029> wheel

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:16.209 
you when you're using your English wheel

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:18.720 
you when you're using your English wheel
at<00:00:16.390> home<00:00:16.570> and<00:00:16.860> this<00:00:17.860> is<00:00:18.070> the<00:00:18.250> same<00:00:18.460> principle

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:18.730 
at home and this is the same principle

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:20.480 
at home and this is the same principle
so<00:00:19.150> you<00:00:19.270> can<00:00:19.420> use<00:00:19.600> that<00:00:19.750> for<00:00:19.960> many<00:00:20.170> different

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
so you can use that for many different

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.090 
so you can use that for many different
brands<00:00:21.490> of<00:00:21.580> English<00:00:21.940> wheels<00:00:22.470> long<00:00:23.470> time<00:00:23.740> ago

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:24.100 
brands of English wheels long time ago

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.130 
brands of English wheels long time ago
when<00:00:24.430> we<00:00:24.550> wheeled<00:00:24.880> up<00:00:25.090> a<00:00:25.210> door<00:00:25.420> skin<00:00:25.779> like<00:00:25.960> this

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:26.140 
when we wheeled up a door skin like this

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:27.870 
when we wheeled up a door skin like this
because<00:00:26.680> that's<00:00:26.800> what<00:00:27.039> I'm<00:00:27.160> going<00:00:27.369> to<00:00:27.460> talk<00:00:27.670> to

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:27.880 
because that's what I'm going to talk to

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:32.220 
because that's what I'm going to talk to
to<00:00:28.330> talk<00:00:28.359> to<00:00:28.750> you<00:00:28.869> about<00:00:30.359> we<00:00:31.359> could<00:00:31.689> wheel<00:00:31.930> it

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:32.230 
to talk to you about we could wheel it

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:36.200 
to talk to you about we could wheel it
up<00:00:32.439> this<00:00:33.430> way<00:00:33.789> and<00:00:34.030> cross<00:00:34.510> it<00:00:34.809> this<00:00:35.019> way<00:00:35.350> and

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
up this way and cross it this way and

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.200 
up this way and cross it this way and
sometimes<00:00:37.210> it<00:00:37.719> came<00:00:37.929> out<00:00:38.109> okay<00:00:38.979> but<00:00:39.879> I<00:00:39.909> had<00:00:40.179> a

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:40.210 
sometimes it came out okay but I had a

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.899 
sometimes it came out okay but I had a
feeling<00:00:40.510> that<00:00:40.870> it<00:00:41.050> it<00:00:41.350> could<00:00:41.409> look<00:00:42.280> better<00:00:42.519> and

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:42.909 
feeling that it it could look better and

00:00:42.909 --> 00:00:46.829 
feeling that it it could look better and
it<00:00:43.659> must<00:00:43.899> be<00:00:44.109> another<00:00:44.319> way<00:00:44.559> to<00:00:44.620> do<00:00:44.920> it<00:00:44.949> so<00:00:45.839> many

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:46.839 
it must be another way to do it so many

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:48.809 
it must be another way to do it so many
times<00:00:47.109> when<00:00:47.379> I<00:00:47.409> have<00:00:47.710> a<00:00:47.739> problem<00:00:48.069> and<00:00:48.489> I<00:00:48.579> go<00:00:48.760> to

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:48.819 
times when I have a problem and I go to

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:50.610 
times when I have a problem and I go to
sleep<00:00:49.149> then<00:00:49.449> I<00:00:49.629> wake<00:00:49.839> up<00:00:50.019> in<00:00:50.170> the<00:00:50.289> middle<00:00:50.379> of

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:50.620 
sleep then I wake up in the middle of

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.549 
sleep then I wake up in the middle of
the<00:00:50.739> night<00:00:50.920> and<00:00:51.219> find<00:00:51.370> out<00:00:51.609> that<00:00:51.819> oh<00:00:52.379> there<00:00:53.379> is

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:53.559 
the night and find out that oh there is

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:56.549 
the night and find out that oh there is
the<00:00:53.709> answer<00:00:54.089> so<00:00:55.089> this<00:00:55.749> happened<00:00:56.199> even<00:00:56.289> this

00:00:56.549 --> 00:00:56.559 
the answer so this happened even this

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:01.410 
the answer so this happened even this
time<00:00:57.719> so<00:00:58.719> I'm<00:00:59.049> going<00:00:59.229> to<00:00:59.289> explain<00:01:00.179> if<00:01:01.179> you're

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:01.420 
time so I'm going to explain if you're

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.590 
time so I'm going to explain if you're
wheeling<00:01:01.659> it<00:01:01.929> across<00:01:02.649> like<00:01:02.709> this<00:01:03.390> in<00:01:04.390> the

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600 
wheeling it across like this in the

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.420 
wheeling it across like this in the
English<00:01:04.839> wheel<00:01:05.049> so<00:01:05.350> you<00:01:05.379> cross<00:01:05.650> it<00:01:05.860> both<00:01:06.100> ways

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.430 
English wheel so you cross it both ways

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:08.760 
English wheel so you cross it both ways
like<00:01:06.730> that<00:01:06.910> but<00:01:07.450> 90<00:01:07.900> degrees<00:01:08.260> to<00:01:08.470> each<00:01:08.500> other

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:08.770 
like that but 90 degrees to each other

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.430 
like that but 90 degrees to each other
you<00:01:09.340> can<00:01:09.370> see<00:01:09.790> how<00:01:09.940> much<00:01:10.120> overlap<00:01:10.660> we<00:01:11.050> have<00:01:11.260> in

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:11.440 
you can see how much overlap we have in

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.110 
you can see how much overlap we have in
the<00:01:11.560> center<00:01:12.010> there<00:01:12.160> between<00:01:12.400> those<00:01:12.820> two

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:13.120 
the center there between those two

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.050 
the center there between those two
tracks<00:01:13.710> when<00:01:14.710> we<00:01:14.890> wheeling<00:01:15.220> it<00:01:15.520> in<00:01:15.670> a<00:01:15.790> diamond

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.060 
tracks when we wheeling it in a diamond

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.380 
tracks when we wheeling it in a diamond
shape<00:01:16.330> and<00:01:17.110> I<00:01:17.830> turn<00:01:18.160> it<00:01:18.190> over<00:01:18.520> like<00:01:18.880> this<00:01:19.120> to

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.390 
shape and I turn it over like this to

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.080 
shape and I turn it over like this to
diamond<00:01:19.870> shape<00:01:20.080> can<00:01:20.680> you<00:01:20.830> see<00:01:21.100> there<00:01:21.400> how<00:01:21.850> much

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090 
diamond shape can you see there how much

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:27.840 
diamond shape can you see there how much
we<00:01:22.390> increase<00:01:23.050> that<00:01:23.920> area<00:01:26.040> so<00:01:27.040> that<00:01:27.220> means<00:01:27.520> that

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
we increase that area so that means that

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.180 
we increase that area so that means that
when<00:01:28.270> we<00:01:28.450> wheeling<00:01:28.780> up<00:01:29.170> a<00:01:29.350> door<00:01:29.590> skin<00:01:29.980> like

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:30.190 
when we wheeling up a door skin like

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:34.110 
when we wheeling up a door skin like
this<00:01:30.400> in<00:01:30.730> a<00:01:30.910> diamond<00:01:31.210> shape<00:01:32.160> the<00:01:33.160> it's<00:01:33.850> the

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:34.120 
this in a diamond shape the it's the

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.300 
this in a diamond shape the it's the
same<00:01:34.450> amount<00:01:34.690> of<00:01:35.080> wheeling<00:01:35.590> to<00:01:35.770> cover<00:01:36.070> the

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 
same amount of wheeling to cover the

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.240 
same amount of wheeling to cover the
whole<00:01:36.490> area<00:01:36.520> but<00:01:37.150> the<00:01:37.300> overlap<00:01:37.870> is<00:01:38.080> more<00:01:38.410> so<00:01:39.070> we

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.250 
whole area but the overlap is more so we

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.390 
whole area but the overlap is more so we
can<00:01:39.280> get<00:01:39.700> it<00:01:39.850> up<00:01:40.000> faster<00:01:40.750> and<00:01:40.780> we<00:01:41.350> can<00:01:41.650> make<00:01:42.220> it

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:42.400 
can get it up faster and we can make it

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.290 
can get it up faster and we can make it
better<00:01:42.580> quality<00:01:43.300> too<00:01:44.280> so<00:01:45.280> if<00:01:45.580> you<00:01:45.670> have<00:01:45.970> a<00:01:46.000> big

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:46.300 
better quality too so if you have a big

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.780 
better quality too so if you have a big
panel<00:01:46.750> like<00:01:46.900> this<00:01:47.140> as<00:01:47.350> the<00:01:47.500> door<00:01:47.710> skin<00:01:47.980> one

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:48.790 
panel like this as the door skin one

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:51.149 
panel like this as the door skin one
thing<00:01:49.030> to<00:01:49.240> remember<00:01:49.480> for<00:01:49.720> you<00:01:50.020> is<00:01:50.200> that<00:01:50.920> you

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:51.159 
thing to remember for you is that you

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:53.790 
thing to remember for you is that you
need<00:01:51.310> to<00:01:51.370> be<00:01:51.670> two<00:01:51.970> people<00:01:52.570> to<00:01:52.870> hold<00:01:53.260> the<00:01:53.440> panel

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:53.800 
need to be two people to hold the panel

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.240 
need to be two people to hold the panel
like<00:01:53.950> this<00:01:55.080> you<00:01:56.080> can't<00:01:56.409> do<00:01:56.650> a<00:01:56.680> panel<00:01:57.100> like<00:01:57.220> this

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
like this you can't do a panel like this

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.580 
like this you can't do a panel like this
by<00:01:57.640> yourself<00:01:58.060> because<00:01:58.479> the<00:01:58.659> gravity<00:01:59.229> going<00:01:59.409> to

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
by yourself because the gravity going to

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.000 
by yourself because the gravity going to
hang<00:01:59.800> down<00:01:59.830> one<00:02:00.520> side<00:02:00.880> and<00:02:01.240> the<00:02:01.900> doors<00:02:02.590> can<00:02:02.860> go

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:03.010 
hang down one side and the doors can go

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:05.430 
hang down one side and the doors can go
our<00:02:03.159> roof<00:02:03.729> skin<00:02:04.030> going<00:02:04.540> to<00:02:04.720> take<00:02:04.900> a<00:02:04.930> totally

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.440 
our roof skin going to take a totally

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.729 
our roof skin going to take a totally

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
holding it tight like this those sides

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.530 
holding it tight like this those sides
going<00:02:30.250> to<00:02:30.459> hang<00:02:30.640> down<00:02:30.670> because<00:02:31.269> of<00:02:31.420> the

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:31.540 
going to hang down because of the

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.199 
going to hang down because of the
gravity<00:02:32.049> and<00:02:32.290> the<00:02:33.250> panel<00:02:33.610> are<00:02:33.670> going<00:02:33.879> to<00:02:34.030> take

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209 
gravity and the panel are going to take

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:39.930 
gravity and the panel are going to take
a<00:02:34.239> different<00:02:34.510> shape<00:02:34.870> that<00:02:35.110> you<00:02:35.230> want<00:02:38.400> so<00:02:39.400> when

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
a different shape that you want so when

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:41.699 
a different shape that you want so when
you<00:02:40.060> have<00:02:40.239> a<00:02:40.269> flat<00:02:40.450> piece<00:02:40.930> and<00:02:41.290> you're<00:02:41.560> going

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
you have a flat piece and you're going

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:44.460 
you have a flat piece and you're going
to<00:02:41.860> wheel<00:02:42.069> it<00:02:42.310> I<00:02:42.519> put<00:02:43.150> some<00:02:43.390> help<00:02:43.720> lines<00:02:44.110> like

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
to wheel it I put some help lines like

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.220 
to wheel it I put some help lines like
this

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
this

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.619 
this
so<00:02:47.230> those<00:02:47.440> three<00:02:47.799> lines<00:02:48.160> is<00:02:48.549> just<00:02:48.970> help<00:02:49.329> lines

00:02:49.619 --> 00:02:49.629 
so those three lines is just help lines

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:51.839 
so those three lines is just help lines
and<00:02:49.900> then<00:02:50.049> I<00:02:50.200> cross<00:02:50.590> it<00:02:50.859> the<00:02:51.129> other<00:02:51.220> way<00:02:51.459> in<00:02:51.730> a

00:02:51.839 --> 00:02:51.849 
and then I cross it the other way in a

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:54.360 
and then I cross it the other way in a
diamond<00:02:52.090> shape<00:02:52.269> so<00:02:52.720> we<00:02:52.840> have<00:02:52.870> six<00:02:53.260> lines<00:02:53.620> that

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
diamond shape so we have six lines that

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.660 
diamond shape so we have six lines that
help<00:02:54.700> us<00:02:54.940> to<00:02:55.150> keep<00:02:55.359> those<00:02:56.079> lines<00:02:56.410> parallel<00:02:57.190> to

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
help us to keep those lines parallel to

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.240 
help us to keep those lines parallel to
the<00:02:57.790> wheel<00:02:57.970> and<00:02:58.410> then<00:02:59.410> we<00:02:59.620> start<00:02:59.920> in<00:03:00.069> one

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
the wheel and then we start in one

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.670 
the wheel and then we start in one
corner<00:03:00.280> and<00:03:00.760> wheeling<00:03:01.359> it<00:03:01.480> as<00:03:01.690> far<00:03:02.109> up<00:03:02.290> as<00:03:02.500> we

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
corner and wheeling it as far up as we

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.080 
corner and wheeling it as far up as we
can<00:03:02.950> until<00:03:03.190> this<00:03:03.730> corner<00:03:04.329> here<00:03:04.780> touching<00:03:06.090> the

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
can until this corner here touching the

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.240 
can until this corner here touching the
frame<00:03:07.390> in<00:03:07.569> the<00:03:07.659> English<00:03:07.870> wheel<00:03:08.079> then<00:03:08.890> we<00:03:09.069> go

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
frame in the English wheel then we go

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:10.920 
frame in the English wheel then we go
out<00:03:09.370> with<00:03:09.640> the<00:03:09.670> wheel<00:03:09.940> to<00:03:10.299> here

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
out with the wheel to here

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.300 
out with the wheel to here
or<00:03:11.019> to<00:03:11.590> here<00:03:12.010> and<00:03:12.220> then<00:03:13.060> turn<00:03:13.420> it<00:03:13.450> around<00:03:13.750> and

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
or to here and then turn it around and

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.849 
or to here and then turn it around and
continue<00:03:15.310> wheeling<00:03:15.730> this<00:03:15.909> part<00:03:16.530> the<00:03:17.530> next

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:17.859 
continue wheeling this part the next

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:20.190 
continue wheeling this part the next
step<00:03:18.069> is<00:03:18.340> to<00:03:18.640> cross<00:03:18.970> this<00:03:19.299> we<00:03:19.720> go<00:03:19.900> the<00:03:20.079> other

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
step is to cross this we go the other

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.400 
step is to cross this we go the other
direction<00:03:20.440> and<00:03:21.130> do<00:03:21.250> the<00:03:21.430> same<00:03:21.639> thing<00:03:22.090> there

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
direction and do the same thing there

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.990 
direction and do the same thing there
then<00:03:23.410> we<00:03:23.560> have<00:03:23.769> a<00:03:23.799> little<00:03:24.099> convex<00:03:24.730> on<00:03:24.910> the

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
then we have a little convex on the

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.500 
then we have a little convex on the
panel<00:03:25.450> and<00:03:26.340> what<00:03:27.340> we<00:03:27.489> do<00:03:27.669> you<00:03:27.700> can<00:03:27.910> see<00:03:28.269> those

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
panel and what we do you can see those

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.869 
panel and what we do you can see those
rectangular<00:03:29.079> that<00:03:29.410> I<00:03:29.440> put<00:03:29.739> up<00:03:29.889> on<00:03:30.069> the<00:03:30.700> panel

00:03:30.869 --> 00:03:30.879 
rectangular that I put up on the panel

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:34.229 
rectangular that I put up on the panel
here<00:03:31.209> so<00:03:31.620> we<00:03:32.620> start<00:03:32.950> in<00:03:33.160> one<00:03:33.370> corner<00:03:33.400> here<00:03:34.150> and

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 
here so we start in one corner here and

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:37.650 
here so we start in one corner here and
wheel<00:03:34.989> this<00:03:35.290> and<00:03:35.620> then<00:03:36.280> we<00:03:36.459> cross<00:03:36.819> this<00:03:37.239> first

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
wheel this and then we cross this first

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.099 
wheel this and then we cross this first
one<00:03:37.959> this<00:03:38.319> way<00:03:38.669> then<00:03:39.669> we<00:03:39.700> go<00:03:40.000> over<00:03:40.269> to<00:03:40.450> the<00:03:40.900> next

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:41.109 
one this way then we go over to the next

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:43.890 
one this way then we go over to the next
rectangular<00:03:41.889> and<00:03:42.069> start<00:03:42.879> in<00:03:43.000> one<00:03:43.209> corner<00:03:43.239> we

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
rectangular and start in one corner we

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.259 
rectangular and start in one corner we
let<00:03:44.109> the<00:03:44.230> diamond<00:03:44.620> shape<00:03:44.859> over<00:03:45.730> the<00:03:45.760> center

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:46.269 
let the diamond shape over the center

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:49.559 
let the diamond shape over the center
one<00:03:46.389> and<00:03:46.629> then<00:03:47.319> we<00:03:47.500> cross<00:03:47.799> this<00:03:48.099> one<00:03:48.459> and<00:03:48.730> over

00:03:49.559 --> 00:03:49.569 
one and then we cross this one and over

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:53.339 
one and then we cross this one and over
the<00:03:50.079> Center<00:03:50.410> one<00:03:50.530> again<00:03:50.829> and<00:03:51.930> then<00:03:52.930> we<00:03:53.079> do<00:03:53.199> the

00:03:53.339 --> 00:03:53.349 
the Center one again and then we do the

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:54.990 
the Center one again and then we do the
same<00:03:53.500> thing<00:03:53.799> with<00:03:53.980> the<00:03:54.099> third<00:03:54.310> rectangular

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
same thing with the third rectangular

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.449 
same thing with the third rectangular
and<00:03:55.209> then<00:03:55.540> the<00:03:55.750> whole<00:03:55.959> sheet<00:03:56.319> that<00:03:56.739> means<00:03:57.069> that

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
and then the whole sheet that means that

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:02.069 
and then the whole sheet that means that
we<00:03:58.150> cover<00:03:58.540> the<00:03:59.500> center<00:03:59.949> section<00:04:00.660> four<00:04:01.660> times

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:02.079 
we cover the center section four times

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:06.689 
we cover the center section four times
more<00:04:02.500> than<00:04:02.560> the<00:04:03.989> big<00:04:04.989> sheet<00:04:05.260> and<00:04:05.560> that<00:04:06.459> means

00:04:06.689 --> 00:04:06.699 
more than the big sheet and that means

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:08.189 
more than the big sheet and that means
that<00:04:06.940> we're<00:04:07.090> raising<00:04:07.329> it<00:04:07.629> up<00:04:07.750> more<00:04:07.989> in<00:04:08.169> the

00:04:08.189 --> 00:04:08.199 
that we're raising it up more in the

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:12.229 
that we're raising it up more in the
same<00:04:08.440> thing<00:04:08.680> and<00:04:09.510> that's<00:04:10.510> what<00:04:10.780> we<00:04:10.959> want<00:04:11.199> so

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 
same thing and that's what we want so

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:15.330 
same thing and that's what we want so
that's<00:04:13.239> a<00:04:13.419> good<00:04:13.599> tip<00:04:13.870> and<00:04:14.230> remember<00:04:14.769> that<00:04:14.949> when

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
that's a good tip and remember that when

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.550 
that's a good tip and remember that when
you're<00:04:15.519> wheeling<00:04:15.819> up<00:04:16.150> something<00:04:16.660> roof<00:04:17.289> skin

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 
you're wheeling up something roof skin

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:22.110 
you're wheeling up something roof skin
like<00:04:18.070> or<00:04:18.340> door<00:04:18.729> skin<00:04:18.970> like<00:04:19.150> this<00:04:19.470> if<00:04:21.120> your

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
like or door skin like this if your

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.450 
like or door skin like this if your
shape<00:04:22.479> of<00:04:22.750> the<00:04:22.900> panel<00:04:23.409> if<00:04:23.560> it's<00:04:23.740> a<00:04:23.860> trunk<00:04:24.159> lid

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
shape of the panel if it's a trunk lid

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.270 
shape of the panel if it's a trunk lid
you<00:04:25.060> maybe<00:04:25.330> have<00:04:25.719> this<00:04:25.990> little<00:04:26.469> further<00:04:26.680> up<00:04:27.010> so

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 
you maybe have this little further up so

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.189 
you maybe have this little further up so
you<00:04:27.340> can<00:04:27.640> actually<00:04:27.820> when<00:04:28.270> you<00:04:28.390> put<00:04:28.599> those

00:04:29.189 --> 00:04:29.199 
you can actually when you put those

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:31.739 
you can actually when you put those
on<00:04:29.590> the<00:04:29.710> sheet<00:04:29.919> you<00:04:30.430> can<00:04:30.639> actually<00:04:30.819> move<00:04:31.300> this

00:04:31.739 --> 00:04:31.749 
on the sheet you can actually move this

00:04:31.749 --> 00:04:34.290 
on the sheet you can actually move this
high<00:04:32.349> spot<00:04:32.830> wherever<00:04:33.129> you<00:04:33.490> want<00:04:33.789> where<00:04:34.150> the

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
high spot wherever you want where the

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:38.010 
high spot wherever you want where the
highest<00:04:34.449> spot<00:04:34.990> is<00:04:35.199> and<00:04:36.419> sometimes<00:04:37.419> you<00:04:37.810> maybe

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
highest spot is and sometimes you maybe

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.369 
highest spot is and sometimes you maybe
don't<00:04:38.289> want<00:04:38.529> the<00:04:38.680> roof<00:04:39.370> skin<00:04:39.729> so<00:04:40.120> top<00:04:40.990> on<00:04:41.289> the

00:04:41.369 --> 00:04:41.379 
don't want the roof skin so top on the

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:43.769 
don't want the roof skin so top on the
center<00:04:41.889> so<00:04:42.370> you<00:04:42.430> maybe<00:04:42.759> have<00:04:43.120> only<00:04:43.330> this

00:04:43.769 --> 00:04:43.779 
center so you maybe have only this

00:04:43.779 --> 00:04:45.719 
center so you maybe have only this
rectangular<00:04:44.379> and<00:04:44.710> this<00:04:44.919> and<00:04:45.189> then<00:04:45.430> the<00:04:45.550> whole

00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:45.729 
rectangular and this and then the whole

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:47.999 
rectangular and this and then the whole
sheet<00:04:46.060> and<00:04:46.389> working<00:04:47.080> on<00:04:47.199> those<00:04:47.379> so<00:04:47.650> you<00:04:47.710> don't

00:04:47.999 --> 00:04:48.009 
sheet and working on those so you don't

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:50.670 
sheet and working on those so you don't
using<00:04:48.460> the<00:04:48.580> center<00:04:48.969> one<00:04:49.120> and<00:04:49.300> we<00:04:49.419> let<00:04:49.659> up<00:04:49.840> so<00:04:50.590> it

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:50.680 
using the center one and we let up so it

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.050 
using the center one and we let up so it
depends<00:04:51.099> little<00:04:51.340> on<00:04:51.400> the<00:04:51.550> shape<00:04:51.759> but<00:04:51.939> the

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:52.060 
depends little on the shape but the

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:55.499 
depends little on the shape but the
principle<00:04:52.659> is<00:04:52.779> the<00:04:52.810> same<00:04:53.909> so<00:04:54.909> this<00:04:55.060> will<00:04:55.330> help

00:04:55.499 --> 00:04:55.509 
principle is the same so this will help

00:04:55.509 --> 00:04:57.420 
principle is the same so this will help
you<00:04:55.749> a<00:04:55.779> lot<00:04:55.960> with<00:04:56.379> their<00:04:56.620> wheeling<00:04:56.979> up<00:04:57.069> a<00:04:57.219> big

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:57.430 
you a lot with their wheeling up a big

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:00.749 
you a lot with their wheeling up a big
big<00:04:57.909> skin<00:04:58.180> and<00:04:58.449> if<00:04:59.169> you<00:04:59.229> have<00:04:59.409> a<00:04:59.620> if<00:05:00.069> the<00:05:00.550> your

00:05:00.749 --> 00:05:00.759 
big skin and if you have a if the your

00:05:00.759 --> 00:05:02.909 
big skin and if you have a if the your
English<00:05:01.029> wheel<00:05:01.270> frame<00:05:01.689> is<00:05:01.960> is<00:05:02.289> stiff<00:05:02.710> enough

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:02.919 
English wheel frame is is stiff enough

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:05.129 
English wheel frame is is stiff enough
it<00:05:03.639> shouldn't<00:05:04.089> take<00:05:04.120> you<00:05:04.419> longer<00:05:04.629> than<00:05:04.930> one

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:05.139 
it shouldn't take you longer than one

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:07.290 
it shouldn't take you longer than one
and<00:05:05.289> a<00:05:05.349> half<00:05:05.560> hour<00:05:05.830> to<00:05:06.249> wheel<00:05:06.520> a<00:05:06.550> pad<00:05:06.849> or<00:05:06.999> skin

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:07.300 
and a half hour to wheel a pad or skin

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:09.629 
and a half hour to wheel a pad or skin
or<00:05:07.509> a<00:05:07.599> roof<00:05:07.839> skin<00:05:08.080> like<00:05:08.319> this<00:05:08.529> that's<00:05:09.219> what<00:05:09.430> we

00:05:09.629 --> 00:05:09.639 
or a roof skin like this that's what we

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:11.429
