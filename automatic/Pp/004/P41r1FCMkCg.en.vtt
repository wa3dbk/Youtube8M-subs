 of the wheel as extremely rusted ordeal twists 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.010
 Before starting the restoration process you will need to study the

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.669
 Nava and wheel thoroughly and make sure it is completely dry 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.090
 If you have an area with a lot of corrosion 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.090
 Use the 220 gram sandpaper 

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:18.919
 If the corrosion is minimal then you can use the sandpaper more 

00:02:18.919 --> 00:02:21.919
 fine of 320 grams 

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:25.230
 once you chose the right sandpaper 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.079
 and I saw that he had corroded 

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:30.319
 use only your hands and fingers to reach smaller areas 

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:36.919

00:02:36.919 --> 00:02:39.079
 grains paralyze the area 

00:02:39.079 --> 00:02:43.889

00:02:48.649 --> 00:02:50.059
 grease 

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:51.319
 and water 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:56.949
 Use paint for wheels at temperatures between 60 and 92-80 to ips and 

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:57.909
 when the humidity 

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:00.109
 be less than 60% 

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:04.299
 to avoid any excess of paint on the tire and today in the waves of 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:08.899

 If you are not sure of the color of your wheel try silver paint 

00:03:28.669 --> 00:03:33.189
 supplied in a discrete area to verify the color match 

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:35.529

 Carefully spray the repaired area until it coexists with the rest of the 

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:04.369
 wheel 

00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:08.689
 to avoid runs and subsidence I applied two light layers followed by 

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:10.069
 a medium moist layer 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:13.129
 apply all the layers in the course of an hour 

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:16.269
 letting ten minutes pass between each layer 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:20.729
 the paint of the wheel will dry to the touch in the course of an hour and 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:23.740
 It will be completely dry at 24 hours 

00:04:24.279 --> 00:04:28.399
