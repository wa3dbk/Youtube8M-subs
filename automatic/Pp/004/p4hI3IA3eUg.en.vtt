00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:05.400
 hello friends how good today I bring you 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.560
 a new video I will show you how to download 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.809
 the nintendo 64 emulator 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.330
 the file comes with the game legend of 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.309
 zelda ocarina of time I will leave the link 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:18.210
 of download in the description is by 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:20.220
 please you know, you just click on the 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.660
 link that I will leave you I do not download the 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.660
 file because I already have it 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.410
 now they will go where he keeps it 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.090
 they right click on the file and they give it 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:48.460
 extract here I have it in English for 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:50.410
 that appears different to me to do this 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.650
 they need the winrar that already many 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.650
 know 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:00.300
 this can be eliminated will leave a 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.430
 folder in which includes the installer 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.879
 and the one where legend of zelda ocarina of 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.879
 time 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.740
 open the installer and follow my steps 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:21.180
 select espanyol so that the 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.180
 installer is in that language 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:26.290
 this can be read to know what 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:29.080
 requirements they need to have for 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:31.330
 execute it well to be able to open 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.580
 roms need live 9 this 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.920
 element for the pc is necessary for 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.930
 be able to play the games that you download there 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.659
 some videos in which they teach you to 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.999
 install it 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.390
 here they must wait until it is installed 

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:44.390
 the emulator 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.049
 they give him in finalize 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:04.189
 and they will have the complete emulator and the 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.990
 open it must put it in Spanish to 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:08.360
 that the emulator is in that language 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.489
 I will cut the roms folder in the folder 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:14.830
 where you install the game that's not 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:14.830
 necessary I do it to not confuse 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:28.580
 now they open the emulator and select the 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.580
 Spanish language 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.100
 do not 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:41.890
 here they give him in file they give him in abrir 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.819
 rom and find the folder where they are 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.890
 their games 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:46.959
 You can also adjust the folder as 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.760
 a directory of roms is to say that at 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:50.889
 moment to put your games in that 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:54.030
 folder that will appear in the space in 

00:02:50.889 --> 00:02:54.030
 white that has the emulator 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:03.080
 As you know the campaign and study did not 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:06.700
 well the games that's why I was not slow 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.700
 but if he stopped recording it will be fine 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:15.100
 and I will show you that if it is in Spanish 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:26.180
 there they are as you can see if you are in 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.180
 Spanish 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:31.300
 If you get an error that says you do not know 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:33.460
 have installed well the bruins should 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:35.950
 right click to the desktop they give 

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:38.080
 in properties later in configuration 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.660
 advanced options and solver 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.760
 problems there will appear a bar the 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:44.860
 they go up to where it says full and they give it 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.700
 to apply and accept and ready and they 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:47.680
 it will work 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:50.470
 I think this method is the same in a 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.810
 27 but if you see another error in the 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:54.670
 that brings a series of numbers means 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.560
 who do not have direct 9 or are not 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.660
 activated so they will have to activate it 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.030
 or install is very easy is not so 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:03.400
 complicated good friends this is all 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:06.070
 I hope you liked it, do not forget 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:08.520
