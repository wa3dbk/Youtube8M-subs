all<00:00:09.280> right<00:00:09.400> here's<00:00:09.610> a<00:00:09.670> question<00:00:09.700> for<00:00:10.240> Hilton

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:10.450 
all right here's a question for Hilton

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:13.620 
all right here's a question for Hilton
from<00:00:11.050> Richard<00:00:11.800> from<00:00:12.340> MX<00:00:12.700> Tech<00:00:12.910> in<00:00:13.150> the<00:00:13.360> States

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:13.630 
from Richard from MX Tech in the States

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:16.980 
from Richard from MX Tech in the States
and<00:00:13.870> he's<00:00:14.830> asking<00:00:15.420> from<00:00:16.420> the<00:00:16.570> outside<00:00:16.869> the

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:16.990 
and he's asking from the outside the

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:19.349 
and he's asking from the outside the
fork<00:00:17.289> appears<00:00:17.830> the<00:00:17.980> same<00:00:18.279> as<00:00:18.640> it<00:00:18.910> has<00:00:19.090> since

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:19.359 
fork appears the same as it has since

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:23.130 
fork appears the same as it has since
2003<00:00:20.730> the<00:00:21.730> cartridge<00:00:22.180> is<00:00:22.300> now<00:00:22.420> three<00:00:22.900> pieces

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:23.140 
2003 the cartridge is now three pieces

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.230 
2003 the cartridge is now three pieces
simply<00:00:23.650> but<00:00:24.340> all<00:00:24.460> the<00:00:24.580> other<00:00:24.730> internals

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:25.240 
simply but all the other internals

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:26.339 
simply but all the other internals
appear<00:00:25.510> to<00:00:25.660> be<00:00:25.750> the<00:00:25.869> same<00:00:26.019> as<00:00:26.140> the<00:00:26.199> previous

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:26.349 
appear to be the same as the previous

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:28.890 
appear to be the same as the previous
years<00:00:26.740> what<00:00:27.369> are<00:00:27.670> the<00:00:28.180> changes<00:00:28.570> in<00:00:28.599> the<00:00:28.750> design

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:28.900 
years what are the changes in the design

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.050 
years what are the changes in the design
and<00:00:29.349> what<00:00:30.220> are<00:00:30.310> the<00:00:30.369> advantages<00:00:30.760> of<00:00:30.820> those

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:31.060 
and what are the advantages of those

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.170 
and what are the advantages of those
changes<00:00:31.539> to<00:00:31.720> the<00:00:32.110> 2009<00:00:32.649> fork<00:00:32.980> that<00:00:33.100> you<00:00:33.309> put

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:34.180 
changes to the 2009 fork that you put

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:44.220 
changes to the 2009 fork that you put
together<00:00:41.790> what<00:00:42.790> happened<00:00:43.210> is<00:00:43.329> we<00:00:43.540> had<00:00:43.660> a<00:00:43.690> 14

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:44.230 
together what happened is we had a 14

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:49.049 
together what happened is we had a 14
millimeter<00:00:44.469> spindle<00:00:45.690> then<00:00:46.690> in<00:00:47.670> 2007<00:00:48.670> we<00:00:48.850> went

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:49.059 
millimeter spindle then in 2007 we went

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:52.229 
millimeter spindle then in 2007 we went
to<00:00:49.149> a<00:00:49.210> 12<00:00:49.510> millimeter<00:00:49.719> spindle<00:00:50.410> which<00:00:51.239> reduces

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:52.239 
to a 12 millimeter spindle which reduces

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:54.090 
to a 12 millimeter spindle which reduces
amount<00:00:52.660> of<00:00:52.750> oil<00:00:52.930> flying<00:00:53.289> over<00:00:53.469> the<00:00:53.590> base<00:00:53.770> valve

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:54.100 
amount of oil flying over the base valve

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.580 
amount of oil flying over the base valve
as<00:00:54.579> the<00:00:54.789> four<00:00:55.000> conferences<00:00:55.570> we<00:00:56.230> found

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:56.590 
as the four conferences we found

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:58.619 
as the four conferences we found
advantages<00:00:57.250> with<00:00:57.430> this<00:00:57.579> just<00:00:57.850> it's<00:00:58.149> easier<00:00:58.480> to

00:00:58.619 --> 00:00:58.629 
advantages with this just it's easier to

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:00.630 
advantages with this just it's easier to
control<00:00:59.020> the<00:00:59.230> damping<00:00:59.620> we<00:00:59.829> had<00:01:00.070> less<00:01:00.280> oil

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:00.640 
control the damping we had less oil

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.490 
control the damping we had less oil
flowing<00:01:01.300> over<00:01:01.480> the<00:01:01.570> baseball<00:01:01.809> we<00:01:02.170> still<00:01:02.379> use

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:02.500 
flowing over the baseball we still use

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.160 
flowing over the baseball we still use
the<00:01:02.710> same<00:01:02.859> piston<00:01:03.370> on<00:01:04.089> the<00:01:04.149> baseball<00:01:04.720> but

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.170 
the same piston on the baseball but

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.260 
the same piston on the baseball but
obviously<00:01:05.560> with<00:01:05.799> the<00:01:05.890> smaller<00:01:06.340> spindle<00:01:06.790> it

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:07.270 
obviously with the smaller spindle it

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.890 
obviously with the smaller spindle it
changed<00:01:07.720> the<00:01:07.900> amount<00:01:08.799> of<00:01:08.950> oil<00:01:09.159> flow<00:01:09.460> then<00:01:10.180> we

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:10.900 
changed the amount of oil flow then we

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.960 
changed the amount of oil flow then we
did<00:01:11.110> a<00:01:11.140> lot<00:01:11.380> of<00:01:11.409> work<00:01:11.740> with<00:01:11.979> the<00:01:12.130> altitudes

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:12.970 
did a lot of work with the altitudes

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.660 
did a lot of work with the altitudes
from<00:01:13.299> sort<00:01:13.840> of<00:01:13.869> 2006<00:01:14.650> up<00:01:14.860> with<00:01:15.460> different

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:15.670 
from sort of 2006 up with different

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.179 
from sort of 2006 up with different
contours<00:01:16.299> on<00:01:16.450> the<00:01:16.479> altitude<00:01:16.780> Medina<00:01:17.259> to<00:01:17.350> what

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:18.189 
contours on the altitude Medina to what

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:20.039 
contours on the altitude Medina to what
we<00:01:18.340> call<00:01:18.520> harmonic<00:01:18.970> bending<00:01:19.450> which<00:01:19.659> allowed

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:20.049 
we call harmonic bending which allowed

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:23.789 
we call harmonic bending which allowed
the<00:01:20.530> 40<00:01:21.009> flicks<00:01:21.400> I<00:01:22.229> would<00:01:23.229> say<00:01:23.409> differently

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:23.799 
the 40 flicks I would say differently

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:25.859 
the 40 flicks I would say differently
without<00:01:24.610> it<00:01:24.759> effects<00:01:25.119> more<00:01:25.330> efficiently

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:25.869 
without it effects more efficiently

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:28.289 
without it effects more efficiently
without<00:01:26.290> putting<00:01:26.619> as<00:01:26.920> much<00:01:27.340> pressure<00:01:27.400> on<00:01:28.150> the

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:28.299 
without putting as much pressure on the

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:30.569 
without putting as much pressure on the
bushes<00:01:28.720> so<00:01:29.560> in<00:01:29.680> other<00:01:29.770> words<00:01:30.070> the<00:01:30.159> inner<00:01:30.400> tube

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:30.579 
bushes so in other words the inner tube

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:33.060 
bushes so in other words the inner tube
and<00:01:30.700> altitude<00:01:31.119> with<00:01:31.750> Flex<00:01:32.350> for<00:01:32.560> money<00:01:32.770> please

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:33.070 
and altitude with Flex for money please

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.539 
and altitude with Flex for money please
so<00:01:33.280> to<00:01:33.340> speak<00:01:33.670> and<00:01:34.020> in<00:01:35.020> this<00:01:35.290> way<00:01:35.799> we<00:01:36.070> reduced<00:01:36.460> a

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:36.549 
so to speak and in this way we reduced a

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:37.830 
so to speak and in this way we reduced a
lot<00:01:36.640> of<00:01:36.700> friction<00:01:36.970> on<00:01:37.329> the<00:01:37.420> floor

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:37.840 
lot of friction on the floor

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.899 
lot of friction on the floor
in<00:01:38.430> 2008<00:01:39.430> we<00:01:39.640> also<00:01:39.759> changed<00:01:40.240> the<00:01:40.470> bearing<00:01:41.470> seat

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
in 2008 we also changed the bearing seat

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.580 
in 2008 we also changed the bearing seat
to<00:01:42.909> a<00:01:42.939> slightly<00:01:43.299> more<00:01:43.600> convex<00:01:44.079> shape<00:01:44.320> just

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
to a slightly more convex shape just

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.289 
to a slightly more convex shape just
your<00:01:44.740> normal<00:01:44.920> movement<00:01:45.340> of<00:01:45.579> the<00:01:45.700> bearing<00:01:46.060> as<00:01:46.240> a

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:46.299 
your normal movement of the bearing as a

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:48.600 
your normal movement of the bearing as a
fall<00:01:46.720> flexed<00:01:47.200> with<00:01:47.259> the<00:01:47.470> laws<00:01:47.619> of<00:01:47.649> the<00:01:47.950> very<00:01:48.369> to

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.610 
fall flexed with the laws of the very to

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.600 
fall flexed with the laws of the very to
move<00:01:48.820> with<00:01:49.090> four<00:01:49.780> inner<00:01:50.020> tube<00:01:50.350> also<00:01:50.979> reducing

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
move with four inner tube also reducing

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:52.660 
move with four inner tube also reducing
friction

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670

the<00:01:53.210> are<00:01:53.330> 2010<00:01:54.050> he<00:01:54.200> also<00:01:54.230> changed<00:01:54.800> a<00:01:54.860> bit<00:01:54.980> on

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
the are 2010 he also changed a bit on

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.160 
the are 2010 he also changed a bit on
the<00:01:55.190> contour<00:01:55.520> Ganges<00:01:55.940> to<00:01:56.120> optimize<00:01:56.630> that<00:01:56.930> and

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
the contour Ganges to optimize that and

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.100 
the contour Ganges to optimize that and
also<00:01:57.560> changed<00:01:57.890> again<00:01:58.100> contours<00:01:58.840> we<00:01:59.840> made<00:02:00.080> a

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
also changed again contours we made a

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.230 
also changed again contours we made a
birth<00:02:00.350> in<00:02:00.590> Edina<00:02:00.830> to<00:02:01.160> which<00:02:01.580> also<00:02:01.760> a<00:02:01.910> lot<00:02:02.120> of

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
birth in Edina to which also a lot of

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.570 
birth in Edina to which also a lot of
benefits<00:02:02.690> and<00:02:02.870> characteristics<00:02:03.560> then<00:02:04.400> what

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:04.580 
benefits and characteristics then what

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.130 
benefits and characteristics then what
happened<00:02:04.970> in<00:02:05.060> 2009<00:02:06.050> is<00:02:06.590> we<00:02:06.740> changed<00:02:07.340> the<00:02:07.490> for

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:08.140 
happened in 2009 is we changed the for

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.500 
happened in 2009 is we changed the for
cartridge<00:02:09.140> diameter<00:02:09.770> from<00:02:10.009> 28<00:02:10.580> to<00:02:10.610> 23<00:02:11.330> more

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
cartridge diameter from 28 to 23 more

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.630 
cartridge diameter from 28 to 23 more
now<00:02:11.810> the<00:02:11.870> baseball<00:02:12.500> piston<00:02:12.920> is<00:02:13.040> a<00:02:13.070> 28

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
now the baseball piston is a 28

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.030 
now the baseball piston is a 28
millimeter<00:02:13.820> piston<00:02:14.540> we<00:02:15.170> kept<00:02:15.470> the<00:02:15.620> 12<00:02:15.860> more

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
millimeter piston we kept the 12 more

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.340 
millimeter piston we kept the 12 more
spindle<00:02:16.490> which<00:02:16.670> we<00:02:16.790> used<00:02:17.000> a<00:02:17.090> 23<00:02:17.660> millimeter

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
spindle which we used a 23 millimeter

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:22.570 
spindle which we used a 23 millimeter
mid<00:02:18.950> valve<00:02:19.220> piston<00:02:19.850> which<00:02:20.840> allowed<00:02:21.260> us<00:02:21.290> to<00:02:21.580> 2/5

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
mid valve piston which allowed us to 2/5

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:27.160 
mid valve piston which allowed us to 2/5
which<00:02:23.180> created<00:02:24.050> less<00:02:24.890> oil<00:02:25.390> flow<00:02:26.390> over<00:02:26.930> the<00:02:27.020> mid

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
which created less oil flow over the mid

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.800 
which created less oil flow over the mid
felt<00:02:27.500> piston<00:02:27.980> but<00:02:28.670> created<00:02:29.090> the<00:02:29.209> same<00:02:29.390> amount

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
felt piston but created the same amount

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.040 
felt piston but created the same amount
of<00:02:29.959> flour<00:02:30.140> to<00:02:30.500> baseball<00:02:31.010> and<00:02:31.570> we<00:02:32.570> found<00:02:32.810> this

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
of flour to baseball and we found this

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:34.930 
of flour to baseball and we found this
was<00:02:33.290> more<00:02:33.470> efficient<00:02:33.950> and<00:02:34.100> easier<00:02:34.430> to<00:02:34.790> make

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
was more efficient and easier to make

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.300 
was more efficient and easier to make
settings<00:02:35.420> with<00:02:35.570> and<00:02:35.840> just<00:02:36.100> increase<00:02:37.100> the

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
settings with and just increase the

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:19.090

it<00:03:16.820> was<00:03:17.450> also<00:03:17.750> easier<00:03:18.110> in<00:03:18.230> the<00:03:18.320> field<00:03:18.590> we<00:03:18.830> found

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.100 
it was also easier in the field we found

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.310 
it was also easier in the field we found
you<00:03:19.400> to<00:03:19.580> make<00:03:19.970> setups<00:03:20.510> you<00:03:20.660> know<00:03:20.780> we'd<00:03:21.140> make

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:21.320 
you to make setups you know we'd make

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.050 
you to make setups you know we'd make
changes<00:03:21.739> and<00:03:21.920> we<00:03:22.040> feel<00:03:22.280> a<00:03:22.310> bit<00:03:22.549> a<00:03:22.580> difference

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
changes and we feel a bit a difference

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:24.580 
changes and we feel a bit a difference
in<00:03:23.239> people<00:03:23.480> because<00:03:23.660> the<00:03:23.750> result<00:03:24.049> of<00:03:24.170> more<00:03:24.530> of

in people because the result of more of
an<00:03:24.680> evolution<00:03:24.890> than<00:03:25.730> a<00:03:25.760> revolution<00:03:26.510> in<00:03:26.780> terms

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 
an evolution than a revolution in terms

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:29.050 
an evolution than a revolution in terms
of<00:03:27.170> the<00:03:27.500> design<00:03:27.799> of<00:03:27.860> the<00:03:28.220> fork<00:03:28.459> you<00:03:28.610> know<00:03:28.850> I

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
of the design of the fork you know I

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.810 
of the design of the fork you know I
think<00:03:29.299> it<00:03:29.540> always<00:03:29.690> you<00:03:30.290> know<00:03:30.489> all<00:03:31.489> the<00:03:31.610> time

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:31.820 
think it always you know all the time

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:35.080 
think it always you know all the time
even<00:03:32.120> in<00:03:32.950> factory<00:03:33.950> level<00:03:34.190> I<00:03:34.489> think<00:03:34.790> if<00:03:34.970> you

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
even in factory level I think if you

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:37.420 
even in factory level I think if you
look<00:03:35.269> at<00:03:35.450> all<00:03:35.570> the<00:03:35.750> four<00:03:36.290> contours<00:03:36.799> today<00:03:37.220> and

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
look at all the four contours today and

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.539 
look at all the four contours today and
bearing<00:03:37.820> seeds<00:03:38.120> and<00:03:38.450> flow<00:03:39.170> dynamics<00:03:39.799> they<00:03:40.310> not

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:40.549 
bearing seeds and flow dynamics they not

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:42.400 
bearing seeds and flow dynamics they not
use<00:03:40.820> differences<00:03:41.450> you<00:03:41.570> know<00:03:41.600> we<00:03:41.750> all<00:03:41.959> sort<00:03:42.290> of

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
use differences you know we all sort of

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:45.220 
use differences you know we all sort of
work<00:03:43.220> in<00:03:43.430> the<00:03:43.519> same<00:03:43.730> direction<00:03:44.090> and<00:03:44.510> I<00:03:44.810> don't

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230 
work in the same direction and I don't

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:47.050 
work in the same direction and I don't
think<00:03:45.470> there's<00:03:45.769> been<00:03:45.830> an<00:03:46.130> action<00:03:46.640> I<00:03:46.700> could<00:03:46.850> use

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
think there's been an action I could use

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.220 
think there's been an action I could use
I<00:03:47.860> can<00:03:48.860> I<00:03:48.950> say<00:03:49.280> breakthrough<00:03:50.239> in<00:03:50.510> technology<00:03:50.720> I

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 
I can I say breakthrough in technology I

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.339 
I can I say breakthrough in technology I
mean<00:03:51.560> I<00:03:51.799> think<00:03:51.950> it's<00:03:52.250> telescopic<00:03:52.760> fork

00:03:53.339 --> 00:03:53.349 
mean I think it's telescopic fork

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:56.099 
mean I think it's telescopic fork
in<00:03:53.829> theory<00:03:54.129> is<00:03:54.340> not<00:03:54.489> the<00:03:54.670> optimum<00:03:55.239> system<00:03:55.719> but

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:56.109 
in theory is not the optimum system but

00:03:56.109 --> 00:03:58.190 
in theory is not the optimum system but
it's<00:03:56.290> still<00:03:56.499> used<00:03:56.739> today<00:03:56.950> in<00:03:57.219> all<00:03:57.459> forms<00:03:57.790> of

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
it's still used today in all forms of

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.809 
it's still used today in all forms of
motorcycle<00:03:59.200> racing<00:03:59.319> so<00:03:59.739> you<00:04:00.370> know<00:04:00.489> maybe<00:04:00.670> in

00:04:00.809 --> 00:04:00.819 
motorcycle racing so you know maybe in

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:02.069 
motorcycle racing so you know maybe in
the<00:04:00.849> future<00:04:00.939> we<00:04:01.359> see<00:04:01.540> some<00:04:01.780> type<00:04:02.049> of

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:02.079 
the future we see some type of

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:04.500 
the future we see some type of
electronic<00:04:02.739> damping<00:04:03.310> or<00:04:03.489> more<00:04:03.849> rigid<00:04:04.269> front

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
electronic damping or more rigid front

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:06.750 
electronic damping or more rigid front
ends<00:04:04.719> which<00:04:04.989> go<00:04:05.200> away<00:04:05.409> from<00:04:05.650> telescopic<00:04:06.310> forks

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.970 
ends which go away from telescopic forks
systems<00:04:07.209> but<00:04:07.389> I<00:04:07.659> don't<00:04:08.499> think<00:04:08.590> we're<00:04:08.769> ready

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:08.980 
systems but I don't think we're ready

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:12.170 
systems but I don't think we're ready
for<00:04:09.040> that<00:04:09.219> yet<00:04:09.519> you<00:04:09.760> know<00:04:09.879> like<00:04:10.599> the<00:04:11.079> theory

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
for that yet you know like the theory

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.490 
for that yet you know like the theory
obviously<00:04:13.180> points<00:04:13.480> in<00:04:13.569> other<00:04:13.719> directions<00:04:13.959> but

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
obviously points in other directions but

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.310 
obviously points in other directions but
in<00:04:14.769> practice<00:04:15.370> we're<00:04:15.609> still<00:04:15.879> finding<00:04:16.389> that<00:04:17.169> the

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.320 
in practice we're still finding that the

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.439 
in practice we're still finding that the
system<00:04:17.650> we<00:04:17.709> use<00:04:17.889> the<00:04:18.070> telescopic<00:04:18.639> fork<00:04:18.880> has

00:04:19.439 --> 00:04:19.449 
system we use the telescopic fork has

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:22.350 
system we use the telescopic fork has
the<00:04:19.630> best<00:04:19.810> results<00:04:20.380> I<00:04:20.470> mean<00:04:20.650> otherwise<00:04:21.609> my<00:04:21.880> GP

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 
the best results I mean otherwise my GP

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.089 
the best results I mean otherwise my GP
with<00:04:22.599> be<00:04:22.930> riding<00:04:23.320> with<00:04:23.349> a<00:04:23.590> different<00:04:23.919> system

00:04:24.089 --> 00:04:24.099 
with be riding with a different system

00:04:24.099 --> 00:04:27.240 
with be riding with a different system
obviously<00:04:24.460> and<00:04:24.960> yeah<00:04:25.960> and<00:04:26.320> it's<00:04:26.680> functioning

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.250 
obviously and yeah and it's functioning

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:29.879 
obviously and yeah and it's functioning
well<00:04:27.400> if<00:04:27.490> I<00:04:27.669> still<00:04:28.110> look<00:04:29.110> there<00:04:29.289> are<00:04:29.440> systems

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:29.889 
well if I still look there are systems

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:31.589 
well if I still look there are systems
like<00:04:30.070> that<00:04:30.099> which<00:04:30.520> in<00:04:30.669> theory<00:04:30.849> offer<00:04:31.240> really

00:04:31.589 --> 00:04:31.599 
like that which in theory offer really

00:04:31.599 --> 00:04:34.260 
like that which in theory offer really
good<00:04:31.690> rigidity<00:04:32.410> and<00:04:32.440> anti<00:04:33.430> die<00:04:33.610> properties

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:34.270 
good rigidity and anti die properties

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:37.409 
good rigidity and anti die properties
and<00:04:35.070> yeah<00:04:36.070> I'm<00:04:36.340> also<00:04:36.550> a<00:04:36.729> friction<00:04:37.180> reduction

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:37.419 
and yeah I'm also a friction reduction

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:39.510 
and yeah I'm also a friction reduction
in<00:04:37.720> some<00:04:37.930> areas<00:04:38.320> but<00:04:38.349> it's<00:04:38.860> just<00:04:39.160> I<00:04:39.430> think

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:39.520 
in some areas but it's just I think

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.100 
in some areas but it's just I think
these<00:04:39.849> these<00:04:40.210> haven't<00:04:40.599> really<00:04:40.960> been

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:41.110 
these these haven't really been

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:43.950 
these these haven't really been
developed<00:04:41.380> to<00:04:41.800> a<00:04:41.830> point<00:04:41.889> where<00:04:42.430> we<00:04:43.389> found<00:04:43.660> them

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:43.960 
developed to a point where we found them

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.350 
developed to a point where we found them
more<00:04:44.289> efficient<00:04:44.919> and<00:04:45.099> more<00:04:45.639> beneficial<00:04:46.150> than

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 
more efficient and more beneficial than

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.290 
more efficient and more beneficial than
a<00:04:46.509> telescopic<00:04:47.050> fork<00:04:47.470> which<00:04:48.280> is<00:04:48.460> it's<00:04:49.120> quite

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:49.300 
a telescopic fork which is it's quite

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:50.969 
a telescopic fork which is it's quite
interesting<00:04:49.599> you<00:04:49.840> know<00:04:50.110> from<00:04:50.380> a<00:04:50.440> developer's

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:50.979 
interesting you know from a developer's

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:52.980 
interesting you know from a developer's
point<00:04:51.130> of<00:04:51.250> view<00:04:51.400> because<00:04:51.550> like<00:04:52.539> I<00:04:52.630> said<00:04:52.810> in

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:52.990 
point of view because like I said in

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:54.570 
point of view because like I said in
theory<00:04:53.289> the<00:04:53.560> other<00:04:53.710> systems<00:04:54.160> which<00:04:54.340> which

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:54.580 
theory the other systems which which

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:56.820 
theory the other systems which which
probably<00:04:55.479> should<00:04:55.630> work<00:04:55.990> better<00:04:56.169> and<00:04:56.620> you<00:04:56.710> know

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:56.830 
probably should work better and you know

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:59.969 
probably should work better and you know
actually<00:04:57.250> you<00:04:57.639> want<00:04:57.870> the<00:04:58.870> most<00:04:59.110> rigid<00:04:59.500> fork

00:04:59.969 --> 00:04:59.979 
actually you want the most rigid fork

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:01.710 
actually you want the most rigid fork
you<00:05:00.130> can<00:05:00.310> get<00:05:00.490> in<00:05:00.669> theory<00:05:00.940> with<00:05:01.210> as<00:05:01.419> little

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:01.720 
you can get in theory with as little

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.930 
you can get in theory with as little
friction<00:05:01.870> as<00:05:02.169> possible<00:05:02.680> but<00:05:03.370> we<00:05:03.550> just<00:05:03.699> haven't

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:03.940 
friction as possible but we just haven't

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:07.520 
friction as possible but we just haven't
the<00:05:04.930> really<00:05:05.229> the<00:05:05.349> Frank<00:05:05.650> technology<00:05:06.400> yet<00:05:06.699> and

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:07.530 
the really the Frank technology yet and

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:10.310 
the really the Frank technology yet and
the<00:05:08.530> technology<00:05:09.099> in<00:05:09.159> other<00:05:09.280> areas<00:05:09.669> where<00:05:10.060> this

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:10.320 
the technology in other areas where this

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.930 
the technology in other areas where this
theory<00:05:11.320> is<00:05:11.470> giving<00:05:11.830> us<00:05:11.979> a<00:05:12.130> desired<00:05:12.520> result<00:05:12.699> so

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:12.940 
theory is giving us a desired result so

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:14.279 
theory is giving us a desired result so
he's<00:05:13.090> still<00:05:13.270> getting<00:05:13.570> better<00:05:13.690> results<00:05:13.900> with

00:05:14.279 --> 00:05:14.289 
he's still getting better results with

00:05:14.289 --> 00:05:17.159 
he's still getting better results with
telescopic<00:05:14.740> fall
