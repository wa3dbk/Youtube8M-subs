00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:09.280
 and they appreciated it is the meteorological service 

00:00:07.479 --> 00:00:11.680
 national is reporting on the 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:14.320
 presence of the tropical storm the 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:16.869
 raimon there in the easy to know you already 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:19.599
 It is far from the Mexican coast and 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:22.000
 keeps moving away at a rate of 15 kilometers 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:24.250
 per hour towards the west we have 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.860
 Cloud generation encompasses what is 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.419
 warrior with very heavy rainfall 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:31.270
 strong is michoacán in colima and in 

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:32.680
 state of Jalisco and also covers the 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:35.500
 most of the center of the republic 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.300
 Mexican and interaction with the front 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.940
 good we will give of precipitations in 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.560
 moderate to strong forecast there will be 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.440
 some intense with a lot of possibility 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:47.260
 in the state of puebla good because this 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:50.140
 is precisely the tropical storm of 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:52.840
 raimon there in the pacific that is followed 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:55.060
 retreating little by little we have the front 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.280
 from number 7 very well the south of the Gulf of 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:59.950
 mexico the 8th in the northern region of 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:03.070
 state of veracruz has established a 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:05.140
 new unstable area with low potential 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.360
 to generate a new tropical cyclone 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.640
 but before this I can 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.469
 happen that in fact it is very low is 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.140
 generating much cloudiness itself 

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:14.910
 it reaches southeast 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.230
 we will wait in the Mexican southeast 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:19.270
 precipitations that go from intense to 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:21.700
 torrential in the peninsula and truth 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.740
 which will be very strong precisely 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.260
 all this unstable area that we have 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:29.860
 just about what is the probe of 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:31.630
 Campeche for what is the cold zone 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.840
 and you of all that is the mass the 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:36.520
 cold air mass covers the north and the 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.260
 center of the american republic it 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.970
 already resents from this day the environment 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:42.190
 cold for the capital of the republic 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.990
 Mexican and we will also have an event 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.360
 from north in the gulf of mexico 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.670
 very low temperatures already in some 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.590
 cases on the negative scale the reds and 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:53.410
 minimum temperature in the north and in the 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:55.600
 center like cold mornings in which 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:58.900
 they continue well, their displacement will be 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:01.450
 the next 7 is in the story 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:03.640
 the 8 reaches what is south of the 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:06.040
 gulf of mexico part of the probe and the 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.960
 Yucatan Peninsula and certainly 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:11.050
 the cold air mass will move towards the 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.760
 south of the gulf with this event that is the 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:16.300
 from north that can have gusts up 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:19.010
 60 65 kilometers per hour while 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.659
 the temperatures of you 36 38 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:24.079
 for the north of the pacific littoral 

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:26.450
 sky almost clear and very sunny in the 

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:28.099
 middle part cloudy cloudy cloudy 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.480
 rainfall that goes from moderate to 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:31.489
 forts in nayarit jalisco colima 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.330
 michoacán the temperatures that can 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:37.750
 reach 33 degrees in the south 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:39.700
 in Acapulco in the bays of Huatulco and 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.220
 there in the temperature bill that 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:45.340
 begin to have a rebound begin to 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.570
 improve we have had 26 degrees of 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.180
 maximum temperature for acapulco 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:50.950
 let's hope that immediately doing in 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.110
 what is in the next of the 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.060
 next hours and I'll tell him the sky 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.740
 the sky from partly cloudy to cloudy with 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.800
 precipitations that can become 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:02.050
 from very strong in intense warrior in 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.760
 the state of oaxaca and torrential in the 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.890
 state of Chiapas for the expertise of iba 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.380
 so cloudy with very heavy rainfall 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.630
 strong by the probe that we have here is 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:12.730
 an area of great instability on the 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:14.380
 Campeche probe that projects a lot 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.600
 cloudiness for the yucatan peninsula 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:18.370
 where the temperatures were falling 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:21.370
 slightly values ​​that can arrive 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:23.260
 between 27 and 29 degrees 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.240
 and the gulf of mexico that recent the 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.370
 presence of the cold air that accompanies the 

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:29.800
 front virus and temperatures not very 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:32.620
 which can reach near the 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:34.030
 30 degrees north of Tamaulipas with 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.530
 a sky half cloudy to cloudy 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:37.690
 precipitation that we have already indicated 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:39.790
 very abundant in veracruz and the state 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:40.660
 from Tabasco the north continues with mornings 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:43.420
 very cold 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:46.030
 the little moist sky in fact almost 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:48.790
 very sunny cloud in some 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:50.710
 points indicated me with values ​​in the 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.740
 scale of negatives and temperatures 

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:55.930
 maxims of nations will follow in a 

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:57.640
 temper to warm scale for the 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:58.660
 The center of the country is also a heaven 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.310
