00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.990 
yes and we will play hard but I think
the<00:03:16.410> result<00:03:16.770> isn't<00:03:17.010> isn't<00:03:17.460> a<00:03:17.490> big<00:03:17.670> thing<00:03:17.880> I

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
the result isn't isn't a big thing I

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.370 
the result isn't isn't a big thing I
think<00:03:18.210> as<00:03:18.300> long<00:03:18.390> as<00:03:18.450> the<00:03:18.600> fans<00:03:18.870> have<00:03:19.080> a<00:03:19.110> great

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
think as long as the fans have a great

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:20.750 
think as long as the fans have a great
time<00:03:19.590> it's<00:03:19.830> about<00:03:19.950> connecting<00:03:20.250> with<00:03:20.430> them<00:03:20.730> and

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
own sort of excitement and I think

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:53.510

they'll be put on that kind of show and

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:54.590 
they'll be put on that kind of show and
then<00:03:53.640> we<00:03:53.700> get<00:03:53.820> people<00:03:54.090> talking<00:03:54.210> about<00:03:54.390> the

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 
then we get people talking about the

00:03:54.600 --> 00:04:21.470 
then we get people talking about the
game<00:03:54.780> and<00:03:55.050> hopefully<00:03:56.840> as<00:03:57.840> well<00:04:03.770> all<00:04:04.770> right

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:21.480 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:25.280 

after<00:04:22.480> group<00:04:22.630> down<00:04:22.810> there<00:04:23.020> three<00:04:23.620> balls

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:25.290 
after group down there three balls

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:27.570 
after group down there three balls
you<00:04:26.290> know<00:04:26.380> I<00:04:26.410> think<00:04:26.530> everyone<00:04:26.890> understands

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:27.580 
you know I think everyone understands

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:29.850 
you know I think everyone understands
the<00:04:28.540> concept<00:04:28.930> of<00:04:29.020> the<00:04:29.140> game<00:04:29.290> and<00:04:29.530> why<00:04:29.650> they're

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:29.860 
the concept of the game and why they're

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.740 
the concept of the game and why they're
here<00:04:30.070> and<00:04:30.280> it's<00:04:31.270> one<00:04:31.390> of<00:04:31.420> those<00:04:31.540> situations

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:31.750 
here and it's one of those situations

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:33.960 
here and it's one of those situations
where<00:04:32.230> I<00:04:32.380> guess<00:04:33.310> I<00:04:33.430> just<00:04:33.550> try<00:04:33.730> to<00:04:33.790> get

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:33.970 
where I guess I just try to get

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:35.850 
where I guess I just try to get
everybody<00:04:34.210> and<00:04:34.660> even<00:04:34.750> amount<00:04:35.380> of<00:04:35.470> minutes<00:04:35.710> and

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:35.860 
everybody and even amount of minutes and

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:36.990 
everybody and even amount of minutes and
that's<00:04:36.010> going<00:04:36.340> to<00:04:36.400> be<00:04:36.490> the<00:04:36.580> biggest<00:04:36.730> challenge

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:37.000 
that's going to be the biggest challenge

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.580 
that's going to be the biggest challenge
I<00:04:37.270> think<00:04:37.330> this<00:04:37.540> video<00:04:37.840> shows<00:04:38.020> a<00:04:38.050> keep<00:04:38.260> track<00:04:38.470> of

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:38.590 
I think this video shows a keep track of

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:40.230 
I think this video shows a keep track of
that<00:04:38.650> there's<00:04:39.070> a<00:04:39.130> couple<00:04:39.370> of<00:04:39.460> basic<00:04:39.580> sets<00:04:40.030> that

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 
that there's a couple of basic sets that

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.610 
that there's a couple of basic sets that
pretty<00:04:40.420> much<00:04:40.540> everybody<00:04:40.840> in<00:04:41.080> the<00:04:41.200> league<00:04:41.380> runs

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:41.620 
pretty much everybody in the league runs

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:43.800 
pretty much everybody in the league runs
so<00:04:41.980> you<00:04:42.760> can<00:04:42.910> basically<00:04:43.090> just<00:04:43.480> give<00:04:43.660> them<00:04:43.780> a

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
so you can basically just give them a

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:45.900 
so you can basically just give them a
little<00:04:43.990> bit<00:04:44.110> of<00:04:44.170> a<00:04:44.230> common<00:04:44.500> language<00:04:44.650> to<00:04:45.100> loose

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:45.910 
little bit of a common language to loose

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:48.180 
little bit of a common language to loose
be<00:04:46.030> able<00:04:46.150> to<00:04:46.210> run<00:04:46.300> a<00:04:46.360> couple<00:04:46.570> things<00:04:47.190> but

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:48.190 
be able to run a couple things but

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:49.560 
be able to run a couple things but
there's<00:04:48.820> going<00:04:49.000> to<00:04:49.060> be<00:04:49.120> a<00:04:49.180> lot<00:04:49.300> of<00:04:49.330> freelance

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:49.570 
there's going to be a lot of freelance

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:51.750 
there's going to be a lot of freelance
particularly<00:04:50.350> offensively<00:04:50.800> again

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:51.760 
particularly offensively again

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:53.340 
particularly offensively again
defensively<00:04:52.360> obviously<00:04:52.780> there's<00:04:52.990> not<00:04:53.140> going

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:53.350 
defensively obviously there's not going

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:55.620 
defensively obviously there's not going
to<00:04:53.410> be<00:04:53.470> very<00:04:53.770> complex<00:04:54.670> schemes<00:04:55.000> going<00:04:55.360> on<00:04:55.480> it's

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:55.630 
to be very complex schemes going on it's

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:57.030 
to be very complex schemes going on it's
going<00:04:55.750> to<00:04:55.810> be<00:04:55.870> pretty<00:04:56.080> just<00:04:56.350> fundamental

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:57.040 
going to be pretty just fundamental

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:59.220 
going to be pretty just fundamental
man-to-man<00:04:57.910> defense<00:04:58.300> and<00:04:58.750> then<00:04:58.870> you're<00:04:59.020> along

00:04:59.220 --> 00:04:59.230 
man-to-man defense and then you're along

00:04:59.230 --> 00:05:00.540 
man-to-man defense and then you're along
on<00:04:59.410> the<00:04:59.500> place<00:04:59.680> to<00:04:59.860> play<00:05:00.010> on<00:05:00.070> their<00:05:00.220> instance
