I<00:00:18.539> haven't<00:00:19.410> played<00:00:19.529> this<00:00:19.680> game<00:00:19.890> much<00:00:20.130> in

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
I haven't played this game much in

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.340 
I haven't played this game much in
recent<00:00:21.000> days<00:00:21.300> I<00:00:21.510> actually<00:00:21.630> got<00:00:21.900> this<00:00:22.020> game

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
recent days I actually got this game

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.769 
recent days I actually got this game
play<00:00:22.529> a<00:00:22.560> little<00:00:22.769> while<00:00:22.980> ago<00:00:23.100> but<00:00:23.660> the<00:00:24.660> reason

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
play a little while ago but the reason

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:25.910 
play a little while ago but the reason
why<00:00:24.960> is<00:00:25.019> because<00:00:25.050> I<00:00:25.260> just<00:00:25.470> haven't<00:00:25.680> had<00:00:25.769> any

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
why is because I just haven't had any

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.589 
why is because I just haven't had any
updates<00:00:26.279> and<00:00:26.490> so<00:00:26.580> as<00:00:27.000> soon<00:00:27.150> as<00:00:27.269> they<00:00:27.359> start

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
updates and so as soon as they start

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.019 
updates and so as soon as they start
updating<00:00:27.750> and<00:00:28.410> maybe<00:00:28.680> I<00:00:28.949> know<00:00:29.609> for<00:00:29.880> sure<00:00:29.910> I

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
updating and maybe I know for sure I

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.669 
updating and maybe I know for sure I
want<00:00:30.210> to<00:00:30.269> play<00:00:30.359> this<00:00:30.480> game<00:00:30.539> when<00:00:30.840> they<00:00:30.929> unlock

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
want to play this game when they unlock

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:32.959 
want to play this game when they unlock
all<00:00:31.920> the<00:00:31.949> characters<00:00:32.160> and<00:00:32.520> then<00:00:32.730> actually

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
all the characters and then actually

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.310 
all the characters and then actually
have<00:00:33.239> a<00:00:33.270> story<00:00:33.510> mode<00:00:33.719> which<00:00:33.899> is<00:00:33.930> my<00:00:34.140> biggest

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
have a story mode which is my biggest

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.229 
have a story mode which is my biggest
complaint<00:00:34.820> originally<00:00:35.820> even<00:00:36.000> though<00:00:36.059> it's<00:00:36.180> a

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
complaint originally even though it's a

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.479 
complaint originally even though it's a
free<00:00:36.480> game<00:00:36.630> you<00:00:36.840> can<00:00:36.960> pay<00:00:37.110> twenty<00:00:37.469> tough<00:00:38.190> I

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
free game you can pay twenty tough I

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:39.740 
free game you can pay twenty tough I
think<00:00:38.700> fifty<00:00:38.969> dollars<00:00:39.300> for<00:00:39.480> this<00:00:39.600> game

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
think fifty dollars for this game

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.360 
think fifty dollars for this game
depending<00:00:40.170> on<00:00:40.260> what<00:00:40.500> all<00:00:40.710> you<00:00:40.829> want<00:00:41.010> to<00:00:41.070> unlock

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
depending on what all you want to unlock

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.150 
depending on what all you want to unlock
and<00:00:41.670> then<00:00:42.420> if<00:00:42.660> you<00:00:42.809> do<00:00:42.989> that<00:00:43.230> then<00:00:43.469> you<00:00:43.739> can<00:00:43.770> get

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
and then if you do that then you can get

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.880 
and then if you do that then you can get
the<00:00:44.640> story<00:00:44.969> mode<00:00:45.180> but<00:00:45.420> at<00:00:45.989> this<00:00:46.140> point<00:00:46.350> I<00:00:46.590> but

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
the story mode but at this point I but

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.160 
the story mode but at this point I but
again<00:00:47.370> that<00:00:47.550> that<00:00:48.030> happens<00:00:48.360> after<00:00:48.600> it<00:00:48.870> becomes

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
again that that happens after it becomes

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.260 
again that that happens after it becomes
available<00:00:49.649> for<00:00:50.010> unlock<00:00:50.309> which<00:00:50.489> is<00:00:50.670> after<00:00:51.120> all

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
available for unlock which is after all

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.180 
available for unlock which is after all
I<00:00:51.449> think<00:00:51.840> four<00:00:52.140> or<00:00:52.170> five<00:00:52.469> DLC<00:00:52.980> characters

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
I think four or five DLC characters

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.520 
I think four or five DLC characters
becomes<00:00:54.000> available<00:00:54.270> which<00:00:54.600> I<00:00:54.899> have<00:00:55.289> no<00:00:55.410> idea

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
becomes available which I have no idea

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:56.810 
becomes available which I have no idea
when<00:00:55.710> that<00:00:55.829> is<00:00:55.949> and<00:00:56.190> and<00:00:56.399> it's<00:00:56.579> it's

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
when that is and and it's it's

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.369 
when that is and and it's it's
frustrating<00:00:57.270> that<00:00:57.420> that<00:00:57.930> they<00:00:58.020> did<00:00:58.199> it<00:00:58.289> the
