description below and you guys enter it

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.700 
description below and you guys enter it
and<00:00:42.360> it<00:00:42.690> also<00:00:42.960> would<00:00:43.890> you<00:00:44.010> do<00:00:44.190> this<00:00:44.340> it<00:00:44.670> will

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:45.710 
and it also would you do this it will

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.500 
and it also would you do this it will
massively<00:00:46.730> increase<00:00:47.730> your<00:00:47.940> step<00:00:48.180> points<00:00:48.420> as

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
massively increase your step points as

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.799 
massively increase your step points as
you<00:00:48.539> will<00:00:48.780> see<00:00:48.960> in<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.140> video<00:00:49.260> and<00:00:49.789> also<00:00:50.809> I

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
you will see in the video and also I

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.139 
you will see in the video and also I
recommend<00:00:52.379> when<00:00:52.829> you're<00:00:52.980> doing<00:00:53.309> it<00:00:53.460> to<00:00:53.910> play

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
recommend when you're doing it to play

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.150 
recommend when you're doing it to play
with<00:00:54.300> someone<00:00:54.719> so<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.440> points<00:00:55.739> will<00:00:55.829> add<00:00:55.949> up

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
with someone so the points will add up

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.069 
with someone so the points will add up
and<00:00:56.309> it<00:00:56.370> would<00:00:56.489> be<00:00:56.520> way<00:00:56.820> much<00:00:57.270> faster<00:00:57.719> to<00:00:57.930> buy

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
and it would be way much faster to buy

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.369 
and it would be way much faster to buy
anything<00:00:58.500> you<00:00:58.800> want<00:00:59.090> um<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.809> only<00:01:00.960> second

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
anything you want um the only second

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:02.900 
anything you want um the only second
thing<00:01:01.530> about<00:01:01.770> this<00:01:01.980> is<00:01:02.219> that<00:01:02.370> you<00:01:02.520> have<00:01:02.550> to

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
thing about this is that you have to

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.369 
thing about this is that you have to
complete<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.300> mission<00:01:03.420> in<00:01:03.870> order<00:01:04.019> to<00:01:04.229> obtain

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
complete the mission in order to obtain

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.760 
complete the mission in order to obtain
all<00:01:04.619> these<00:01:04.710> points<00:01:05.070> but<00:01:05.250> it'll<00:01:05.519> be<00:01:05.640> simple

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
all these points but it'll be simple

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.560 
all these points but it'll be simple
where<00:01:07.770> I'm<00:01:08.040> at<00:01:08.340> I<00:01:08.580> stopped<00:01:09.119> it<00:01:09.299> quickly

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
where I'm at I stopped it quickly

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.830 
where I'm at I stopped it quickly
because<00:01:10.080> it<00:01:10.320> can<00:01:10.439> go<00:01:10.590> on<00:01:10.680> forever<00:01:10.950> but<00:01:11.600> to<00:01:12.600> test

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
because it can go on forever but to test

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.690 
because it can go on forever but to test
it<00:01:13.020> out<00:01:13.110> and<00:01:13.470> my<00:01:13.590> cousin<00:01:13.950> have<00:01:14.100> played<00:01:14.369> for

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
it out and my cousin have played for

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.030 
it out and my cousin have played for
like<00:01:14.850> a<00:01:15.060> total<00:01:15.479> of<00:01:15.540> an<00:01:15.630> hour<00:01:15.810> and<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.740> Great

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
like a total of an hour and the Great

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.429 
like a total of an hour and the Great
Plains<00:01:17.070> did<00:01:17.790> not<00:01:17.970> stop<00:01:18.330> just<00:01:19.020> keep<00:01:19.200> shooting

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
Plains did not stop just keep shooting

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.950 
Plains did not stop just keep shooting
up<00:01:19.680> forever<00:01:19.979> and<00:01:20.369> ever<00:01:20.490> and<00:01:20.700> ever<00:01:20.790> and<00:01:21.270> it'll

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
up forever and ever and ever and it'll

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.980 
up forever and ever and ever and it'll
just<00:01:22.259> basically<00:01:22.619> just<00:01:23.009> not<00:01:23.520> stop<00:01:23.939> keep<00:01:24.360> going

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
just basically just not stop keep going

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.740 
just basically just not stop keep going
and<00:01:25.290> you're<00:01:25.619> getting<00:01:25.950> a<00:01:26.220> lot<00:01:26.729> of<00:01:27.030> points<00:01:27.240> trust

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
and you're getting a lot of points trust

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.590 
and you're getting a lot of points trust
me<00:01:27.869> outlaw<00:01:28.320> which<00:01:29.189> means<00:01:29.430> basically<00:01:30.210> doing

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
me outlaw which means basically doing

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.300 
me outlaw which means basically doing
the<00:01:30.810> first

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.480 

it<00:01:35.909> would<00:01:36.030> be<00:01:36.299> quick<00:01:36.720> like<00:01:37.320> this<00:01:37.500> quick<00:01:37.890> when<00:01:38.460> I
