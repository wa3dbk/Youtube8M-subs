00:00:01.229 --> 00:00:04.720
 but I go to spring the temperatures will soften the minimums are no longer 

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.410
 so low is the right time to prepare the seedbeds if we make them 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:11.689
 in advance but it is perfect for the month of April 

00:00:11.689 --> 00:00:16.169
 of the material is cheap it is easy to get nor the summers that is why it is very 

00:00:16.169 --> 00:00:20.809
 important to have all the muses we need on the one hand will be the 

00:00:20.809 --> 00:00:25.059
 containers where we will place all the evidence that we have some spikes 

00:00:25.059 --> 00:00:26.640
 They are made of coconut fiber 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.330
 then we have in the trays where we will place containers gladly day 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.010
 Special for seedbeds that is much lighter 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.550
 and allows the nuclear plant and after having neglected with which we cover 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.510
 before sowing the seed complains while in the conditions they need 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.610
 first if the time is right 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.220
 second if you need light to germinate 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:50.940
 in the case that they require it from brazil brasil very superficially so that the 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:51.620
 receive 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.100
 many are the seeds do not prosper because they are too busy 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.000
 next to the time to sow we can choose the right container for 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.190
 example these are mauve seeds 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:02.810
 which are quite large 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:06.370
 we can remove it without problems in the larger containers others like 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:08.000
 we will treat logo 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.670
 we want to use smaller containers cuts or seeds very 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.980
 little ones and if you can not get many of them inside of yourself 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:14.910
 container 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:17.600
 we want to expose 13 miles or so 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.270
 and then we will choose 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.490
 the one that develops more we will do a little like the laws of long and the 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:23.740
 survival idea 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.250
 so it's also make sure that if any fails we will not stay with 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:28.650
 no empty container 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.150
 what we do in this case was the case of the mallows we read how is your 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:33.060
 process 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.060
 we place them over peacefully 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.080
 because they need some light to germinate in that case we go for the 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.399
 quarter 

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:45.029
 piluco what we do is protect them with a layer of vermiculite laverni point is 

00:01:45.029 --> 00:01:46.980
 a type of volcanic rock 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:48.810
 it is very very very light 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.230
 with which it does not prevent 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:55.170
 to the germinated seeds and what it does is to protect the earth and 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.740
 Whole plant 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.850
 assures them that it has heat assures them that it has enough minerals 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.460
 because it ensures a type of protection and that the substrate never stays 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.160
 so we saw covering all cases of recipients 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:11.959
 and we already have the first seedbeds 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:16.049
 punctum to seed the substrate to be repeating in the last of 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:20.069
 try to never lose mind the best thing is to wet it every day with a sprayer 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:23.950
 because of the environmental conditions of the risk of the appearance of forests 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:24.649
 big 

00:02:24.649 --> 00:02:28.969
 therefore always accuse in new land and keep containers clean 

00:02:30.389 --> 00:02:32.989
 well we have done the seedbeds we have put names 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:36.159
 according to why if we are not going to stop until we know for sure that we have 

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:36.790
 planted 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.180
 let's talk then the bad wild here the galleys this year we have been 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:41.579
 cradle are together 

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:44.930
 this one that has a lid I did not have any problem to be protected we can 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.799
 put so we can even take advantage of this cleaning everything so that it 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:53.049
 believe this we will place ourselves in the little greenhouse that we have down in the bank 

00:02:53.619 --> 00:02:57.329
 I hope you liked the council and especially that encourage you to prepare 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:02:59.039
 the votes cast this coming week
