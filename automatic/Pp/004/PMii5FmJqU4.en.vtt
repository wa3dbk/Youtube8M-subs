00:00:08.549 --> 00:00:11.569
 he did it when this one and these u 

00:00:11.569 --> 00:00:14.989
 second floor so to speak 

00:00:14.989 --> 00:00:17.929
 they insert the game 

00:00:17.929 --> 00:00:20.929
 then it will be like this 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:27.499
 for me to be able to get to that second floor we need stairs this one 

00:00:27.499 --> 00:00:30.239
 can use with this button 

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:32.680
 as you can see it just appeared 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.780
 an object or invisible 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:37.940
 for the stairs 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.660
 now we can put stairs or a ramp 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.970
 the ramp to be able to put the ramp is necessary 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:47.840
 modify our fair 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.160
 for example here 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:50.700
 make a ramp 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.730
 and how can they see camping completely changed its shape 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.340
 for adal of a ramp 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:58.370
 so 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.340
 and we want the ramp we have forgiveness 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.640
 it's just a matter of modifying it 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:04.620
 of the place 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.620
 and in size 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.390
 let's modify 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.750
 because when you are ready 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.750
 big instead texture when ready 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.040
 they insert what is going to be our world 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.420
 and there it is 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.290
 will do if you do not like the ramps then Thursday select it with the 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.320
 selection tool 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.320
 and change it to 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.870
 wait 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:53.590
 apparently it is not possible to change it back to ladder 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.920
 so I had to choose well 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.410
 your jet or 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:00.820
 stairs or ramps 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.140
 in this 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.930
 honeycomb I would leave it like this for the moment anyway at this point had a 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:10.930
 tutorial forgiveness 

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:15.339
 now suppose that our second is ready the p 

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:21.400
 now that you will see up our 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.489
 on the second floor 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:26.489
 good what can be there can be many things 

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:30.909
 suppose that above 

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:33.909
 on our second floor there 

00:02:34.929 --> 00:02:36.149
 there is a weapon 

00:02:36.149 --> 00:02:37.529
 suppose 

00:02:37.529 --> 00:02:40.549
 then we go to entities 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:43.069
 and we look 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:45.099
 on the occasion 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:47.499
 of the weapons that would be 

00:02:47.499 --> 00:02:50.499
 and who blaster I love 

00:02:50.499 --> 00:02:53.609
 will make percent in the measurement of the ship 

00:02:56.119 --> 00:02:57.440
 and who better than him 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.519
 federer 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:03.519
 n those are the weapons 

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:07.369
 when we select area 

00:03:07.369 --> 00:03:09.659
 suppose and rocket launchers 

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:14.559
 we place it close to the floor so that our game will not happen 

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:18.259
 there has been placed in the desired place 

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:21.359
 and he did we are 

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:23.829
 now high inside this one 

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:25.309
 object 

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:28.019
 we select 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:30.269
 object selection 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:32.839
 and here options appear 

00:03:32.839 --> 00:03:34.339
 reappears 

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:37.749
 true false we leave it a certain 

00:03:37.749 --> 00:03:41.829
 of lifted holding up so we want it to reappear after grabbing it 

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:48.909
 and false and we want him not to appear again 

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:52.919
 now playlist that is ready 

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:54.649
 we can not put 

00:03:54.649 --> 00:03:56.769
 enemies 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:59.919
 for that we go to entities 

00:03:59.919 --> 00:04:02.919
 and we are going to select the option 

00:04:03.779 --> 00:04:06.779
 in 

00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:10.299
 drives both males santa fe 

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:12.119
 what does it mean 

00:04:12.119 --> 00:04:15.879
 enemy start point or something like that 

00:04:16.659 --> 00:04:19.659
 we place ourselves where we want this one 

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:24.930
 We place it where they want or we do not want it to be yes 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.930
 touch some object as yes 

00:04:28.999 --> 00:04:33.599
 is stuck to the floor or in the air will happen the same as with our 

00:04:33.599 --> 00:04:35.370
 to be able to understand part 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.099
 from start 

00:04:37.099 --> 00:04:41.529
 sorry for locking up something complicated month doing tutorials is the first time that 

00:04:41.529 --> 00:04:42.650
 I make a 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:45.199
 so so 

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:47.529
 from the desired position 

00:04:47.529 --> 00:04:49.949
 in this we have just 0 

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:52.949
 enemy at the level 

00:04:53.749 --> 00:04:57.469
 now if we want our level to be formed by a two birth 

00:04:58.189 --> 00:04:59.809
 rooms 

00:04:59.809 --> 00:05:02.909
 what we have to do is use mm 

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:06.599
 cube button 

00:05:06.599 --> 00:05:09.729
 and use the golob option that would be co 

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:13.779
 to be able to put another room 

00:05:13.779 --> 00:05:16.779
 We place it in any desired position 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:21.330
 desired size 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:27.080
 and we insert him 

00:05:27.819 --> 00:05:29.700
 how can we make 

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:33.199
 our character that enters our 

00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:35.529
 to our second quarter of the level 

00:05:35.529 --> 00:05:37.490
 good first 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:41.559
 As you can see I left a small space between the two 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:48.190
 It is necessary to leave a small space, forgiveness for not depending on 

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:51.379
 you want or did not leave space 

00:05:51.379 --> 00:05:54.289
 and the one that is ready our second room 

00:05:54.289 --> 00:05:57.289
 we use art the same 

00:05:58.039 --> 00:05:59.569
 gwec or 

00:05:59.569 --> 00:06:01.279
 do what it would be 

00:06:01.279 --> 00:06:03.059
 our 

00:06:03.059 --> 00:06:05.259
 min the catwalk 

00:06:05.259 --> 00:06:07.279
 so to speak 

00:06:07.279 --> 00:06:08.590
 and we put it 

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:11.749
 in the middle of what are the two rooms 

00:06:11.749 --> 00:06:15.899
 to make a kind of corridor and be able to enter and leave to our liking 

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:21.080
 we need 

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:24.430
 As you can see, he took our little space from the Pope 

00:06:26.309 --> 00:06:28.240
 inside 

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:31.800
 will be here covered by our 

00:06:33.789 --> 00:06:35.380
 our country has seen yet 

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:38.319
 unfinished 

00:06:38.319 --> 00:06:41.389
 to be able to act on a door 

00:06:41.389 --> 00:06:43.289
 we use the option 

00:06:43.289 --> 00:06:46.199
 modify temple matrix and temple hits 

00:06:46.199 --> 00:06:49.680
 with the cube option 

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:53.740
 we modified in our priÃ­sta object showed solid 

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:58.460
 Koen de kort solid haircut 

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:00.809
 we give the size 

00:07:00.809 --> 00:07:03.529
 Nancy, we want it to be our 

00:07:03.529 --> 00:07:06.279
