of<00:05:05.349> it<00:05:05.590> we<00:05:05.949> should<00:05:06.099> mention<00:05:06.310> to<00:05:06.550> the<00:05:06.669> people<00:05:06.969> is

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:07.120 
of it we should mention to the people is

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.390 
of it we should mention to the people is
that<00:05:07.300> the<00:05:07.840> site<00:05:08.050> with<00:05:08.590> the<00:05:08.680> water<00:05:08.889> tank<00:05:09.129> on<00:05:09.250> the

that the site with the water tank on the
side<00:05:09.639> it<00:05:10.360> makes<00:05:10.990> it<00:05:11.169> easier<00:05:11.530> in<00:05:11.710> some<00:05:11.949> in<00:05:12.939> some

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:13.000 
side it makes it easier in some in some

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.179 
side it makes it easier in some in some
kitchens<00:05:13.689> if<00:05:14.199> you've<00:05:14.469> got<00:05:14.680> a<00:05:14.710> very<00:05:14.889> low

00:05:15.179 --> 00:05:15.189 
kitchens if you've got a very low

00:05:15.189 --> 00:05:19.080 
kitchens if you've got a very low
counter<00:05:16.030> or<00:05:16.150> something<00:05:16.180> that<00:05:18.090> accessibility

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:19.090 
counter or something that accessibility

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:20.850 
counter or something that accessibility
and<00:05:19.509> the<00:05:19.840> beauty<00:05:20.080> about<00:05:20.139> this<00:05:20.319> is<00:05:20.650> that<00:05:20.740> you

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:20.860 
and the beauty about this is that you

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:22.409 
and the beauty about this is that you
don't<00:05:21.009> have<00:05:21.069> to<00:05:21.189> pull<00:05:21.370> it<00:05:21.400> all<00:05:21.699> the<00:05:21.729> way<00:05:21.939> up<00:05:22.210> you

00:05:22.409 --> 00:05:22.419 
don't have to pull it all the way up you

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:24.390 
don't have to pull it all the way up you
can<00:05:22.569> just<00:05:22.750> pull<00:05:22.960> it<00:05:23.110> up<00:05:23.139> slightly<00:05:23.620> and<00:05:24.009> then

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:24.400 
can just pull it up slightly and then

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:28.020 
can just pull it up slightly and then
out<00:05:24.639> to<00:05:24.879> the<00:05:25.000> side<00:05:25.830> which<00:05:26.830> is<00:05:26.860> nice<00:05:27.250> and<00:05:27.639> of

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:28.030 
out to the side which is nice and of

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:30.059 
out to the side which is nice and of
course<00:05:28.270> the<00:05:28.449> capacity<00:05:29.080> factor<00:05:29.349> that<00:05:29.770> it<00:05:29.919> does

00:05:30.059 --> 00:05:30.069 
course the capacity factor that it does

00:05:30.069 --> 00:05:32.369 
course the capacity factor that it does
hold<00:05:30.219> more<00:05:30.460> water<00:05:30.639> holds<00:05:31.330> more<00:05:31.509> beads<00:05:31.780> your

00:05:32.369 --> 00:05:32.379 
hold more water holds more beads your
