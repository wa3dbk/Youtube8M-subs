00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
metabolic dysfunction cardiovascular

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.889 
metabolic dysfunction cardiovascular
dysfunction<00:01:45.360> but<00:01:47.090> it<00:01:48.090> will<00:01:48.329> help<00:01:48.600> you<00:01:48.720> add

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
dysfunction but it will help you add

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.899 
dysfunction but it will help you add
calories<00:01:49.229> which<00:01:49.680> is<00:01:49.829> number<00:01:50.070> one<00:01:50.369> thing<00:01:50.700> to

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
calories which is number one thing to
