what this is what you get you need these

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.660 
what this is what you get you need these
two<00:02:23.360> and<00:02:23.660> these<00:02:24.620> are<00:02:24.800> all<00:02:24.890> just<00:02:24.920> whatever<00:02:25.520> you

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
two and these are all just whatever you

two and these are all just whatever you
want<00:02:25.880> i'm<00:02:26.570> not<00:02:27.050> really<00:02:27.200> going<00:02:27.350> to<00:02:27.440> use<00:02:27.530> these

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:27.710 
want i'm not really going to use these

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:30.970 
want i'm not really going to use these
this<00:02:28.370> one<00:02:28.430> just<00:02:28.640> like<00:02:28.850> it<00:02:29.150> if<00:02:30.080> you<00:02:30.230> have<00:02:30.320> a<00:02:30.380> it's

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
this one just like it if you have a it's

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.890 
this one just like it if you have a it's
complicated<00:02:31.700> but<00:02:31.790> like<00:02:31.970> some<00:02:32.450> texture<00:02:32.720> packs

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
complicated but like some texture packs

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.530 
complicated but like some texture packs
have<00:02:33.050> multiple<00:02:33.620> skins<00:02:34.340> for<00:02:34.610> same<00:02:34.880> mobs<00:02:35.150> and

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
have multiple skins for same mobs and

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.330 
have multiple skins for same mobs and
this<00:02:36.260> would<00:02:36.380> like<00:02:36.500> randomize<00:02:36.890> it<00:02:37.040> but<00:02:37.160> I<00:02:37.190> don't

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
this would like randomize it but I don't

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.340 
this would like randomize it but I don't
like<00:02:37.460> dokucraft<00:02:37.700> SI<00:02:38.120> yet<00:02:38.270> so<00:02:38.480> see<00:02:38.750> randomized

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
like dokucraft SI yet so see randomized

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:40.540 
like dokucraft SI yet so see randomized
