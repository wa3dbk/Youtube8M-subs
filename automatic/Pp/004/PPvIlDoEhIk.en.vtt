and I want to start off with talking to
the<00:00:06.060> max<00:00:06.330> players<00:00:06.690> now<00:00:07.529> the<00:00:07.859> max<00:00:08.069> players<00:00:08.309> have

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
been pretty loyal to runescape so I

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:11.870 
been pretty loyal to runescape so I
figured<00:00:10.800> they<00:00:10.920> should<00:00:11.070> have<00:00:11.250> a<00:00:11.519> little<00:00:11.759> bit

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
figured they should have a little bit

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.959 
figured they should have a little bit
more<00:00:12.059> stuff<00:00:12.630> in<00:00:13.019> runescape<00:00:14.009> that<00:00:14.490> could<00:00:14.820> help

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
more stuff in runescape that could help

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:16.970 
more stuff in runescape that could help
them<00:00:15.089> out<00:00:15.440> since<00:00:16.440> they<00:00:16.590> are<00:00:16.650> pretty<00:00:16.770> much

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
would be able to make you have six more

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
extra items uh to where you would

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.360 
extra items uh to where you would
actually<00:02:33.510> have<00:02:33.930> more<00:02:34.410> inventory<00:02:34.680> space<00:02:35.100> to

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
actually have more inventory space to

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.650 
actually have more inventory space to

have like you know more items where you

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.170 
have like you know more items where you
could<00:02:39.810> eat<00:02:40.050> for<00:02:40.500> food<00:02:40.739> potion<00:02:41.730> stuff<00:02:42.000> like

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
could eat for food potion stuff like

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:43.970 
could eat for food potion stuff like
that<00:02:42.209> and<00:02:42.690> that's<00:02:43.110> also<00:02:43.260> another<00:02:43.530> reason<00:02:43.650> why

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
that and that's also another reason why

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.460 
that and that's also another reason why
you<00:02:44.040> were<00:02:44.190> against<00:02:44.970> it<00:02:45.060> correct<00:02:45.360> yes<00:02:46.110> you

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
you were against it correct yes you

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.699 
you were against it correct yes you
could<00:02:46.709> store<00:02:47.160> like<00:02:47.550> 12<00:02:48.090> items<00:02:48.330> in<00:02:48.870> two<00:02:49.170> spaces

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
could store like 12 items in two spaces

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:52.809 
could store like 12 items in two spaces
and<00:02:50.220> I<00:02:50.880> don't<00:02:51.120> think<00:02:51.360> that<00:02:51.450> would<00:02:51.750> be<00:02:52.140> fair<00:02:52.410> for

00:02:52.809 --> 00:02:52.819 
and I don't think that would be fair for

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:56.539 
and I don't think that would be fair for
supplies<00:02:53.930> um<00:02:54.930> okay<00:02:55.890> let's<00:02:56.010> get<00:02:56.160> on<00:02:56.250> to<00:02:56.400> the

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:56.549 
supplies um okay let's get on to the

00:02:56.549 --> 00:02:58.460 
supplies um okay let's get on to the
third<00:02:56.760> update<00:02:56.970> suggestion<00:02:57.660> trade<00:02:58.110> based<00:02:58.319> on

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
third update suggestion trade based on

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.259 
third update suggestion trade based on
total<00:02:58.709> level<00:02:58.980> instead<00:02:59.310> of<00:02:59.430> quest<00:02:59.670> points<00:03:00.000> now

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 
total level instead of quest points now

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:02.509 
total level instead of quest points now
I<00:03:00.510> personally<00:03:00.989> think<00:03:01.080> this<00:03:01.260> would<00:03:01.410> be<00:03:01.440> epic<00:03:02.010> um

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
I personally think this would be epic um

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:04.550 
I personally think this would be epic um
I<00:03:03.330> would<00:03:03.510> really<00:03:03.780> like<00:03:03.930> this<00:03:04.110> because<00:03:04.260> I<00:03:04.380> have

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
I would really like this because I have

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.160 
I would really like this because I have
a<00:03:04.590> higher<00:03:04.799> total<00:03:05.160> level<00:03:05.280> and<00:03:05.610> I<00:03:06.060> don't<00:03:07.049> really

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
a higher total level and I don't really

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.250 
a higher total level and I don't really
do<00:03:07.350> that<00:03:07.380> that<00:03:08.160> many<00:03:08.310> quest<00:03:08.640> um<00:03:09.200> now<00:03:10.200> the

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
do that that many quest um now the

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.490 
do that that many quest um now the
reason<00:03:10.530> for<00:03:10.799> this<00:03:10.890> is<00:03:11.780> more<00:03:12.780> reason<00:03:13.140> to<00:03:13.260> Train

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
reason for this is more reason to Train

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.400 
reason for this is more reason to Train
stats<00:03:14.010> and<00:03:14.430> for<00:03:14.940> jagex<00:03:15.269> to<00:03:15.420> slow<00:03:15.810> down<00:03:16.049> on

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
stats and for jagex to slow down on

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.890 
stats and for jagex to slow down on
making<00:03:17.069> quest<00:03:17.519> because<00:03:18.180> I've<00:03:18.450> realized<00:03:18.750> that

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
making quest because I've realized that

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.270 
making quest because I've realized that
there's<00:03:19.079> so<00:03:19.260> many<00:03:19.320> requests<00:03:19.709> coming<00:03:19.950> out<00:03:20.130> from

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
there's so many requests coming out from

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.599 
there's so many requests coming out from
jagex<00:03:20.820> and<00:03:21.209> most<00:03:21.900> people<00:03:22.260> they<00:03:22.650> really<00:03:23.280> don't

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:23.609 
jagex and most people they really don't

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:26.270 
jagex and most people they really don't
try<00:03:24.060> to<00:03:24.120> Train<00:03:24.450> stats<00:03:25.290> that<00:03:25.530> much<00:03:25.769> they're

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
try to Train stats that much they're

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.110 
try to Train stats that much they're
mostly<00:03:26.579> PDP<00:03:27.239> or<00:03:27.739> just<00:03:28.739> like<00:03:28.890> one<00:03:29.340> stat<00:03:29.730> you

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
mostly PDP or just like one stat you

mostly PDP or just like one stat you
know<00:03:30.209> peers<00:03:30.859> so<00:03:31.859> I<00:03:32.310> would<00:03:33.000> really<00:03:33.180> like<00:03:33.359> to<00:03:33.630> see

would have to do a quest for this item
it'd<00:05:37.380> probably<00:05:37.590> be<00:05:37.770> a<00:05:37.830> pretty<00:05:38.040> hard<00:05:38.280> quest<00:05:38.610> but

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:39.510 
it'd probably be a pretty hard quest but

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:42.590

that's<00:05:40.080> the<00:05:40.320> item<00:05:40.620> info<00:05:41.070> and<00:05:41.430> it<00:05:42.240> would<00:05:42.360> also

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:42.600 
that's the item info and it would also

that's the item info and it would also
be<00:05:42.750> non-tradable<00:05:44.120> so<00:05:45.120> I<00:05:45.150> just<00:05:45.450> think<00:05:45.600> that

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:45.630 
be non-tradable so I just think that

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:47.450 
be non-tradable so I just think that
would<00:05:45.750> be<00:05:45.870> really<00:05:45.900> cool<00:05:46.080> for<00:05:46.440> the<00:05:47.100> seventh
