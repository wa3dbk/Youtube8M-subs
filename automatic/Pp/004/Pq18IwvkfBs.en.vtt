00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
that flips around are here too so it

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.149 
that flips around are here too so it
does<00:02:01.790> inside<00:02:02.790> and<00:02:02.969> out<00:02:03.920> pretty<00:02:04.920> cool-looking

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.550 
what I even paid for and they have
little<00:03:31.350> trigger<00:03:31.680> stops<00:03:32.010> right<00:03:32.220> here<00:03:33.440> for<00:03:34.440> this

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
little trigger stops right here for this

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.009 
little trigger stops right here for this
so<00:03:34.830> you<00:03:34.920> can<00:03:34.950> custom<00:03:35.700> tailor<00:03:36.000> it<00:03:36.180> to<00:03:36.209> here<00:03:36.630> to

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
so you can custom tailor it to here to

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:41.050 
so you can custom tailor it to here to
your<00:03:37.820> design<00:03:38.820> or<00:03:39.090> desired<00:03:39.540> whatever<00:03:40.530> the<00:03:40.709> hex

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
your design or desired whatever the hex

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.340 
your design or desired whatever the hex
but<00:03:42.060> I<00:03:42.090> like<00:03:42.330> the<00:03:42.360> kind<00:03:42.900> of<00:03:42.959> the<00:03:43.050> chromed<00:03:43.230> out

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
but I like the kind of the chromed out

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:47.120 
but I like the kind of the chromed out
look<00:03:43.590> murdered<00:03:44.370> murdered<00:03:44.670> out<00:03:44.910> black<00:03:46.130> and

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
look murdered murdered out black and

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:49.340 
look murdered murdered out black and
chrome<00:03:47.400> can't<00:03:47.790> really<00:03:48.000> go<00:03:48.120> on<00:03:48.239> with<00:03:48.360> that<00:03:48.510> um

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
chrome can't really go on with that um

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:51.259 
chrome can't really go on with that um
but<00:03:49.769> yeah<00:03:49.950> that's<00:03:50.459> pretty<00:03:50.700> much<00:03:50.820> it<00:03:50.910> man<00:03:51.239> I

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
but yeah that's pretty much it man I

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:52.640 
but yeah that's pretty much it man I
didn't<00:03:51.600> see<00:03:51.690> anything<00:03:51.870> else<00:03:52.080> to<00:03:52.230> fancying<00:03:52.590> the

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
didn't see anything else to fancying the

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.300 
didn't see anything else to fancying the
box<00:03:52.860> that<00:03:53.820> was<00:03:53.940> it<00:03:54.120> just<00:03:54.360> not<00:03:54.810> in<00:03:54.959> that<00:03:55.310> so
