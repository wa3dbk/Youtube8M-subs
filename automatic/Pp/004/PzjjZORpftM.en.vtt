00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:06.950
 sometimes the antenna shots that are 

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:10.009
 they ride in the houses because they lose 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:12.650
 a lot of signal level is even with the 

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:16.160
 nice design that has and manufactured by 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:18.440
 a first brand right now 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:21.800
 you have to analyze the field meter in 

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:24.470
 channel 69 which is the channel with the 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:27.590
 highest frequency and we have the 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:30.410
 power and quality you see the cn in 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:33.890
 mail Zeberio power see as well 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:35.480
 replace with a socket also of 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.520
 first brand 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.980
 and go see the differences that they have 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.290
 with respect to the measurements I what I have 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:45.129
 fact is connect the cable here to 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:47.980
 meter and I'm taking measurements 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:51.110
 and I'll see what I'm going to do fast 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:52.610
 right now the field meter signal 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:55.240
 evidently 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:58.110
 how are we going to replace the grave 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:58.110
 this takes 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:01.230
 it's final 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:08.300
 has a screw in the center that 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.300
 you have to go removing what 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:14.670
 to take away a pressure that has 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:22.510
 and we release here 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:24.310
 and we see that to a final take list and the 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:26.580
 I live and the mesh is here back 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:30.040
 so that the contact the metal caps 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:33.240
 we're going to remove them I bring here another 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.240
 first brand also 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.619
 we must see the differences that there are in 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.700
 the take this I like this system more 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.310
 because it is screw 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:46.119
 and as long as there's a screw and you can 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:48.930
 you squeeze with your hand the for me is 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:52.170
 much much better 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.480
 it's already tight and it's just 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.700
 and lower this screw to do 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:59.210
 pressure there in the center and close well 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.210
 the wire 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:12.789
 it seems a simple thing to change a grave 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.789
 but it requires a little bit of skill 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:19.560
 ok we press there 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.450
 and now we are going to add chords from the 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:25.890
 previous measures 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:29.190
 because I did remember and the power 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:33.420
 month the movies were not like these 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:36.180
 has varied at least 10 decibels the 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:39.850
 power from one outlet to another at least 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:42.790
 exactly like that about 14 so you see 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:46.830
 in the facilities because you are not 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.830
 carrying out the installation of sockets 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:52.610
 that they do not lose that they are not 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:55.709
 hers we go so it's nothing 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:58.140
 I just wanted to see how after 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:59.819
 do a new tdt installation me 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.500
 I encounter a problem in the grave and 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:04.290
 we have replaced it see you in the 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.890
 next videotutoriales a hug and 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.890
 generate
