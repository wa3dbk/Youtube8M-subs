Azula<00:00:13.629> versus<00:00:14.559> the<00:00:14.740> Azula<00:00:15.070> -<00:00:15.280> and<00:00:15.720> let<00:00:16.720> me<00:00:16.750> know

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:16.869 
Azula versus the Azula - and let me know

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:18.269 
Azula versus the Azula - and let me know
we<00:00:16.960> think<00:00:17.140> about<00:00:17.230> our<00:00:17.439> new<00:00:17.590> lighting<00:00:18.070> for<00:00:18.220> the

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:18.279 
we think about our new lighting for the

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:22.650 
we think about our new lighting for the
videos<00:00:18.550> so<00:00:19.360> first<00:00:20.050> off<00:00:20.259> we<00:00:20.980> will<00:00:21.599> compare<00:00:22.599> the

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:22.660 
videos so first off we will compare the

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.970 
videos so first off we will compare the
knives<00:00:23.580> the<00:00:24.580> sheaths<00:00:24.910> are<00:00:25.289> identical<00:00:26.289> they're

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:26.980 
knives the sheaths are identical they're

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:28.679 
knives the sheaths are identical they're
injection<00:00:27.699> molded<00:00:28.000> plastic<00:00:28.029> they're<00:00:28.570> not

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:28.689 
injection molded plastic they're not

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:30.810 
injection molded plastic they're not
Kydex<00:00:29.109> so<00:00:30.010> they're<00:00:30.160> the<00:00:30.250> same<00:00:30.400> I've<00:00:30.640> done<00:00:30.789> a

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:30.820 
Kydex so they're the same I've done a

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.390 
Kydex so they're the same I've done a
video<00:00:31.060> on<00:00:31.179> the<00:00:31.390> Azula<00:00:31.720> so<00:00:31.960> I<00:00:32.199> won't<00:00:33.040> talk<00:00:33.190> too

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:33.400 
video on the Azula so I won't talk too

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.079 
video on the Azula so I won't talk too
much<00:00:33.430> about<00:00:33.610> it<00:00:34.000> as<00:00:34.809> far<00:00:35.080> as<00:00:35.230> the<00:00:35.379> blades<00:00:35.650> go

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:36.089 
much about it as far as the blades go

00:00:36.089 --> 00:00:39.150 
much about it as far as the blades go
they're<00:00:37.089> identical<00:00:37.500> I'm<00:00:38.500> sure<00:00:38.769> most<00:00:38.920> of<00:00:39.040> you

that if you go that far as far as the

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:25.980 
that if you go that far as far as the
profiles<00:01:24.729> of<00:01:24.999> the<00:01:25.090> handles<00:01:25.479> if<00:01:25.570> I<00:01:25.659> stack<00:01:25.899> them

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 
profiles of the handles if I stack them

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.830 
profiles of the handles if I stack them
up<00:01:26.140> there<00:01:26.350> top<00:01:27.219> and<00:01:27.399> bottom<00:01:27.729> they're<00:01:28.090> pretty

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 
up there top and bottom they're pretty

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.489 
up there top and bottom they're pretty
much<00:01:28.960> identical<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:30.460> only<00:01:30.490> difference<00:01:30.729> is<00:01:31.499> we

00:01:32.489 --> 00:01:32.499 
much identical the only difference is we

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:35.489 
much identical the only difference is we
got<00:01:32.679> my<00:01:32.829> tape<00:01:33.039> measure<00:01:33.219> here<00:01:34.049> get<00:01:35.049> those<00:01:35.229> lined

00:01:35.489 --> 00:01:35.499 
got my tape measure here get those lined

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:37.950 
got my tape measure here get those lined
up<00:01:35.679> just<00:01:35.740> right<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:37.210> only<00:01:37.390> difference<00:01:37.749> is

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:37.960 
up just right the only difference is

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:43.080 
up just right the only difference is
you're<00:01:38.439> getting<00:01:38.679> about<00:01:40.950> 3/8<00:01:41.950> of<00:01:42.100> an<00:01:42.249> inch<00:01:42.340> more

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
you're getting about 3/8 of an inch more

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.169 
you're getting about 3/8 of an inch more
on<00:01:43.390> the<00:01:43.509> handle<00:01:43.869> that's<00:01:44.560> it<00:01:44.859> yeah<00:01:45.429> almost<00:01:45.909> a

00:01:46.169 --> 00:01:46.179 
on the handle that's it yeah almost a

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:50.010 
on the handle that's it yeah almost a
half<00:01:46.359> an<00:01:46.479> inch<00:01:46.569> but<00:01:46.840> more<00:01:47.350> like<00:01:47.499> 3/8<00:01:48.539> so<00:01:49.539> you

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
half an inch but more like 3/8 so you

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.389 
half an inch but more like 3/8 so you
also<00:01:50.170> get<00:01:50.439> the<00:01:50.530> handle<00:01:50.829> scales<00:01:51.009> that<00:01:51.249> come

00:01:51.389 --> 00:01:51.399 
also get the handle scales that come

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:55.489 
also get the handle scales that come
with<00:01:51.549> it<00:01:51.579> so<00:01:52.889> economically<00:01:53.889> this<00:01:54.670> is<00:01:54.819> superior

00:01:55.489 --> 00:01:55.499 
with it so economically this is superior

different<00:02:15.790> weight<00:02:15.940> on<00:02:16.290> the<00:02:17.290> Azula<00:02:17.650> -<00:02:17.830> you're

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
different weight on the Azula - you're

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:21.000 
different weight on the Azula - you're
looking<00:02:18.700> at<00:02:18.760> 3<00:02:18.940> point<00:02:19.210> 2<00:02:19.300> ounces<00:02:19.720> and

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
looking at 3 point 2 ounces and

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.839 
looking at 3 point 2 ounces and
Azula<00:02:21.430> is<00:02:21.670> 2<00:02:21.970> ounces<00:02:22.330> I<00:02:23.280> like<00:02:24.280> them<00:02:24.400> both<00:02:24.549> for

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:24.849 
Azula is 2 ounces I like them both for

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:26.280 
Azula is 2 ounces I like them both for
different<00:02:25.090> reasons<00:02:25.390> I<00:02:25.569> like<00:02:25.780> the<00:02:25.930> Azula

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
different reasons I like the Azula

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.009 
different reasons I like the Azula
because<00:02:26.620> one<00:02:27.310> it's<00:02:27.489> less<00:02:27.670> expensive<00:02:28.239> and<00:02:28.420> 2

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:29.019 
because one it's less expensive and 2

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:30.479 
because one it's less expensive and 2
it's<00:02:29.230> lighter<00:02:29.439> so<00:02:29.950> if<00:02:30.040> I'm<00:02:30.129> going<00:02:30.220> to<00:02:30.310> use<00:02:30.340> this

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.489 
it's lighter so if I'm going to use this

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:32.580 
it's lighter so if I'm going to use this
for<00:02:30.700> a<00:02:30.730> neck<00:02:30.879> knife<00:02:31.060> or<00:02:31.329> a<00:02:31.360> backup<00:02:31.599> blade<00:02:31.930> say<00:02:32.560> I

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
for a neck knife or a backup blade say I

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.460 
for a neck knife or a backup blade say I
already<00:02:32.829> have<00:02:33.129> the<00:02:33.790> SE<00:02:34.599> three<00:02:34.870> or<00:02:34.989> four<00:02:35.319> or

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
already have the SE three or four or

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.399 
already have the SE three or four or
five<00:02:35.500> or<00:02:35.680> six<00:02:36.069> in<00:02:36.250> my<00:02:36.519> pack<00:02:36.909> or<00:02:37.299> a<00:02:37.780> k-bar<00:02:38.230> and

00:02:38.399 --> 00:02:38.409 
five or six in my pack or a k-bar and

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:39.990 
five or six in my pack or a k-bar and
this<00:02:38.500> is<00:02:38.590> my<00:02:38.709> backup<00:02:38.950> this<00:02:39.549> is<00:02:39.610> the<00:02:39.790> one<00:02:39.909> I'd

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
this is my backup this is the one I'd

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.729 
this is my backup this is the one I'd
get<00:02:40.209> let's<00:02:41.019> say<00:02:41.170> this<00:02:41.290> is<00:02:41.379> going<00:02:41.530> to<00:02:41.590> be<00:02:41.650> my

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:41.739 
get let's say this is going to be my

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:43.470 
get let's say this is going to be my
primary<00:02:42.040> blade<00:02:42.489> I'd<00:02:42.730> probably<00:02:43.030> go<00:02:43.269> with<00:02:43.299> the

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
primary blade I'd probably go with the

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.979 
primary blade I'd probably go with the
Azula<00:02:44.349> -<00:02:44.970> it<00:02:45.970> fits<00:02:46.180> better<00:02:46.360> in<00:02:46.510> your<00:02:46.540> hand

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
Azula - it fits better in your hand

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:49.050 
Azula - it fits better in your hand
as<00:02:47.049> you<00:02:47.290> can<00:02:47.409> do<00:02:47.560> heavy<00:02:47.769> tasks<00:02:48.340> I<00:02:48.489> think<00:02:48.970> this

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060 
as you can do heavy tasks I think this

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.240 
as you can do heavy tasks I think this
will<00:02:49.150> be<00:02:49.239> a<00:02:49.299> better<00:02:49.420> choice<00:02:49.920> it<00:02:50.920> does<00:02:51.069> come

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
will be a better choice it does come

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:52.770 
will be a better choice it does come
with<00:02:51.370> the<00:02:51.459> handle<00:02:51.730> scales<00:02:51.879> so<00:02:52.180> you<00:02:52.420> know<00:02:52.659> we

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
with the handle scales so you know we

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.440 
with the handle scales so you know we
get<00:02:52.930> a<00:02:52.959> nice<00:02:53.200> good<00:02:53.379> grip<00:02:53.620> on<00:02:53.739> that<00:02:54.000> you<00:02:55.000> can<00:02:55.269> buy

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
get a nice good grip on that you can buy

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.479 
get a nice good grip on that you can buy
the<00:02:55.510> scales<00:02:55.900> for<00:02:56.739> the<00:02:56.769> Azula<00:02:57.099> one<00:02:57.220> I<00:02:57.250> think

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:57.489 
the scales for the Azula one I think

00:02:57.489 --> 00:02:59.520 
the scales for the Azula one I think
you're<00:02:57.579> 11<00:02:57.879> dollars<00:02:58.030> on<00:02:58.420> the<00:02:58.900> SE<00:02:59.139> site<00:02:59.349> so

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
you're 11 dollars on the SE site so

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.500 
you're 11 dollars on the SE site so
that's<00:02:59.680> a<00:02:59.769> wrap<00:02:59.920> to<00:03:00.040> go<00:03:00.190> it<00:03:00.970> doesn't<00:03:01.239> cover<00:03:01.420> the

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
that's a wrap to go it doesn't cover the

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.330 
that's a wrap to go it doesn't cover the
whole<00:03:01.720> it<00:03:01.840> just<00:03:01.870> goes<00:03:02.139> from<00:03:02.379> there<00:03:02.590> to<00:03:03.159> there

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
whole it just goes from there to there

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.629 
whole it just goes from there to there
so<00:03:04.349> that's<00:03:05.349> the<00:03:05.500> versus<00:03:05.769> video<00:03:05.950> I<00:03:06.310> don't

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:06.639 
so that's the versus video I don't

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:08.069 
so that's the versus video I don't
really<00:03:06.909> have<00:03:07.060> a<00:03:07.090> favorite<00:03:07.480> I<00:03:07.540> like<00:03:07.629> a<00:03:07.690> bowl<00:03:07.900> for

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:08.079 
really have a favorite I like a bowl for

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:09.599 
really have a favorite I like a bowl for
