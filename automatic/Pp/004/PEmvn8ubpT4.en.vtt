00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:42.010 
it's not a mod actually it's kinda

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:45.450 
it's not a mod actually it's kinda
random<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:44.110> aim<00:01:44.260> is<00:01:44.440> a<00:01:44.470> little<00:01:44.560> harder<00:01:45.130> on<00:01:45.160> it

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
random the aim is a little harder on it

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.030 
random the aim is a little harder on it
though<00:01:45.610> I'll<00:01:45.850> tell<00:01:45.880> you<00:01:46.090> that<00:01:46.180> but<00:01:46.770> it's<00:01:47.770> still

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:48.040 
though I'll tell you that but it's still

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.130 
though I'll tell you that but it's still
and<00:01:48.670> I'm<00:01:48.910> running<00:01:49.240> a<00:01:49.330> little<00:01:49.570> laggy<00:01:49.780> if<00:01:50.020> you

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
and I'm running a little laggy if you

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:51.750 
and I'm running a little laggy if you
hadn't<00:01:50.350> noticed<00:01:50.500> I<00:01:50.770> changed<00:01:51.160> the<00:01:51.220> distance<00:01:51.640> a

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:51.760 
hadn't noticed I changed the distance a

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.100 
hadn't noticed I changed the distance a
little<00:01:51.880> bit<00:01:52.090> I'm<00:01:52.240> gonna<00:01:52.330> record<00:01:52.660> in<00:01:52.810> fraps

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
little bit I'm gonna record in fraps

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.050 
little bit I'm gonna record in fraps
with<00:01:53.440> the<00:01:53.530> distance<00:01:53.950> it's<00:01:54.160> a<00:01:54.430> little

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
with the distance it's a little

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.600 
with the distance it's a little
different<00:01:55.509> but<00:01:55.899> I<00:01:56.200> can<00:01:56.800> shoot<00:01:57.009> arrows<00:01:57.250> so<00:01:57.670> I

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
different but I can shoot arrows so I

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.790 
different but I can shoot arrows so I
don't<00:02:00.610> think<00:02:00.759> it's<00:02:00.880> very<00:02:00.970> on<00:02:01.720> target<00:02:02.470> they

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:02.800 
don't think it's very on target they

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.320 
don't think it's very on target they
just<00:02:03.040> kind<00:02:03.220> of<00:02:03.310> shoot<00:02:03.550> wherever<00:02:03.759> they<00:02:04.030> want<00:02:04.240> to

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
just kind of shoot wherever they want to

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.950 
just kind of shoot wherever they want to
shoot<00:02:04.770> but<00:02:05.770> I<00:02:06.040> guess<00:02:06.729> that's<00:02:07.090> ok<00:02:07.509> because<00:02:07.660> it's

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 
shoot but I guess that's ok because it's

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.719 
shoot but I guess that's ok because it's
still<00:02:08.200> cool<00:02:08.440> having<00:02:08.739> this<00:02:08.920> heads-up<00:02:09.310> display

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
still cool having this heads-up display

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.270 
still cool having this heads-up display

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
here you know what does this called over

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.640 
here you know what does this called over
here<00:02:24.670> these<00:02:24.850> piggies<00:02:25.270> kill<00:02:26.080> some<00:02:26.230> piggies<00:02:26.530> to

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
here these piggies kill some piggies to

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:32.330 
here these piggies kill some piggies to
see<00:02:26.800> how<00:02:26.860> far<00:02:27.040> we<00:02:27.160> get<00:02:27.250> you<00:02:27.430> ooh

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.699 

now<00:02:33.380> there's<00:02:34.380> a<00:02:34.500> way<00:02:34.800> to<00:02:35.160> zoom<00:02:35.700> in<00:02:36.260> like<00:02:37.260> if<00:02:37.530> you

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
now there's a way to zoom in like if you

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:41.030 
now there's a way to zoom in like if you
like<00:02:38.040> with<00:02:38.190> a<00:02:38.220> gun<00:02:39.590> and<00:02:40.590> then<00:02:40.739> trying<00:02:40.980> to

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
like with a gun and then trying to

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.190 
like with a gun and then trying to
figure<00:02:41.220> that<00:02:41.430> out<00:02:41.489> like<00:02:42.480> how<00:02:42.720> it<00:02:42.840> kind<00:02:43.110> of

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
figure that out like how it kind of

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.270 
figure that out like how it kind of
zooms<00:02:43.440> in<00:02:43.650> right<00:02:43.830> there<00:02:43.980> there's<00:02:44.160> actually

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
zooms in right there there's actually

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.210 
zooms in right there there's actually
way<00:02:44.640> to<00:02:44.700> get<00:02:44.970> like<00:02:45.150> the<00:02:45.330> battle<00:02:45.780> rifle<00:02:46.220> and

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
way to get like the battle rifle and

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:48.920 
way to get like the battle rifle and
then<00:02:47.310> you<00:02:47.370> can't<00:02:47.610> zoom<00:02:47.670> in<00:02:47.970> with<00:02:48.180> this<00:02:48.300> assault

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
then you can't zoom in with this assault

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.500 
then you can't zoom in with this assault
rifle<00:02:49.019> that's<00:02:49.500> on<00:02:49.650> I<00:02:49.680> know<00:02:49.890> but<00:02:50.880> I'm<00:02:51.060> gonna<00:02:51.180> see

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
rifle that's on I know but I'm gonna see

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.360 
rifle that's on I know but I'm gonna see
if<00:02:51.870> there's<00:02:52.200> a<00:02:52.260> way<00:02:52.470> to<00:02:52.500> make<00:02:52.800> it<00:02:52.950> just<00:02:53.160> do<00:02:53.340> it

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
if there's a way to make it just do it

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.250 
if there's a way to make it just do it
maybe<00:02:53.910> like<00:02:54.060> binoculars<00:02:54.420> or<00:02:54.810> something<00:02:55.140> if

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
maybe like binoculars or something if

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.030 
maybe like binoculars or something if
it's<00:02:55.410> a<00:02:55.530> person<00:02:56.930> yeah<00:02:57.930> so<00:02:58.260> I<00:02:58.290> guess<00:02:58.800> it's

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
it's a person yeah so I guess it's

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.220 
it's a person yeah so I guess it's
pretty<00:02:59.220> accurate<00:02:59.550> it's<00:03:00.000> pretty<00:03:00.180> cool<00:03:00.480> mod<00:03:00.720> or

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
pretty accurate it's pretty cool mod or

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.170 
pretty accurate it's pretty cool mod or
I<00:03:01.470> keep<00:03:01.769> saying<00:03:02.069> mod<00:03:02.280> it's<00:03:02.550> not<00:03:02.670> really<00:03:02.880> a<00:03:02.910> mod

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
I keep saying mod it's not really a mod

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.960 
I keep saying mod it's not really a mod
it's<00:03:04.040> sort<00:03:05.040> of<00:03:05.100> like<00:03:05.190> a<00:03:05.250> random<00:03:05.700> thing<00:03:05.940> that

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
it's sort of like a random thing that

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:11.360 
it's sort of like a random thing that
popped<00:03:06.360> up<00:03:06.569> for<00:03:06.870> me<00:03:09.049> but<00:03:10.049> I<00:03:10.200> think<00:03:10.590> it's<00:03:10.739> pretty

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
popped up for me but I think it's pretty

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:12.110 
popped up for me but I think it's pretty
cool

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
cool

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.970 
cool
