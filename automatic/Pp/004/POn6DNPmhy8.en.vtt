 paradise god wanted Adam and Eve to live 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:32.349
 without there peace and harmony with joy 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:35.760
 arriving at paradise god showed the 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:38.199
 tree of life and the tree of good and evil 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.620
 saying Adam and Eve 

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:44.500
 You can eat the fruit of any 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:48.519
 tree that exists in the garden of Eden 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:52.269
 but you can not eat the fruit that 

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:56.890
 from the tree of good and evil because it 

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:58.989
 not made to eat if they eat you 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:02.409

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:03.460
 one day she walked by the tree of the 

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:06.670
 good and evil 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.990
 there lived the serpent that was evil 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:11.380
 disguised 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:14.710
 the serpent said eva why do not you 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:17.650
 eat the fruit of the tree of good and evil 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:20.500
 Eva replied because we said to 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:24.730
 not like her if Adam and I eat 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:27.880
 we will be punished because God does not 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:30.940
 wants you and Adam as a fruit of the 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:34.600
 good and evil asked the snake 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:39.130
 Evil because if you eat everything 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:41.340
 stay as wise as god can eat 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:46.570
 yea 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:47.810
 eva took the fruit and eat a piece that 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:52.369
 tasty 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:55.100
 he thought after a little bit that 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:58.070
 ate and asked eva what fruit 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:00.439
 delicious where did you get that tree from? 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:03.530
 All good and evil replied Eva 

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:06.979
 suddenly Adam and Eve realized that 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:09.560
 were in and were ashamed 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:13.130
 It was then that they remembered what God 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:15.819
 said you can not eat the fruit of the 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.819
 good and evil 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.060
 when God searched the two of them through the garden 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:22.100
 from Eden 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:25.610
 Adam and Eve hid among the 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:28.850
 Trees were afraid because God had 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:33.380
 be warned to begin the fruit of good and 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:36.110
 of evil they were punished worship where 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:38.900
 Are you because you do not answer me? 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:43.430
 asks God why I was afraid of 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:45.080
 lord and month Count replied Adam because 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:48.799
 was afraid of me 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:52.880
 I already know you ate the fruit of good and 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:54.440
 It's not bad, but it was her. 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.920
 convinced 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:00.680
 Why did you do this, eva, asked God. 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.840
 it was the serpent that convinced me 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:06.680
 she answered 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:09.829
 so we have said the snake because 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:13.390
 Of the wickedness that made you will creep 

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:17.019
 on the floor for the rest of your life 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:19.940
 turning to Adam and Eve God said 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:23.389
 you are expelled from the garden of Eden 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:27.609

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:27.609
 you will have to work to live 

00:03:27.719 --> 00:03:35.019
 Then God ordered two clubs that are 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:37.989
 powerful angels to take care of the 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:38.769
 gates of the garden of Eden for Adam 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:42.129
