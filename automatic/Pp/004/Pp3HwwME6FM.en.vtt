00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.539
 all and welcome to this video review of koefnoen 

00:00:08.539 --> 00:00:09.530
 but misses in 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:11.670
 and those of today at siemens in sweet lake 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.910
 but what devices are going to view for educational espresso machines 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.230
 for example, you see the tk 7 0 6 2 0 9 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.739
 That is the absolute top model from Siemens 

00:00:21.739 --> 00:00:23.280
 I have my own 

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:24.929
 certainly seven 

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:27.060
 sit on top of calls to weesp where 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:27.980
 with a button 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.980
 but believe Magath 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:34.370
 they see it didn't seem too big to me 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.370
 and removable water reservoirs 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.740
 further see here a bartender plate on which you can place cups so that coffee 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:45.000
 stays on longer 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.370
 and this is afp adv 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.160
 in a switchable 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.520
 and we see every display 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.780
 with the handy these buttons 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.880
 so you can easily choose which types of coffee you want to ride 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.810
 exit the new club in height-adjustable coffee 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:05.470
 and turn against this time 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:09.590
 so that you can prepare a cappuccino without moving your cup 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.360
 it is, after all 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.120
 walk out of the galaxy 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.360
 which is also adjustable in height 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.160
 and a tube that you can hang in a pack of milk so that the milker will automatically 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.570
 on his mouth 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.800
 we also see here too 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.330
 the fully removable drip tray 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.410
 so that you can live everything easily 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:35.410
 and we're going to make espresso now 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.820
 in the minutes select espresso 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.740
 a message is on 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.740
 and then he gets started right away 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:04.450
 it's subject to a crap ex we find food 5 set 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.650
 which consists of two models 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:08.079
 this is the top model 

00:02:08.079 --> 00:02:11.079
 the pvv like a stone around 9 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:16.270
 has gotten to sit on top of that bean and race where 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:19.599
 with the plugs with grinds 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:20.739
 we see that here 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:26.209
 water is true that is removable he is not fine as wide life 7 series some 7 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:26.999
 liters 

00:02:26.999 --> 00:02:29.699
 still a big enough 

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:33.499
 we see the warm place here, but it cannot be switched on separately 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:39.159
 and here we see a button 

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:42.669
 with which the different suitcases and dictates he has that runs away choice 

00:02:42.669 --> 00:02:45.669
 from various specialty specialties 

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:52.149
 that is because the coffee runs out 

00:02:52.149 --> 00:02:54.529
 which is otherwise height-adjustable 

00:02:54.529 --> 00:02:57.529
 and spout is also processed 

00:02:58.059 --> 00:03:01.079
 m a tube that you hang in a milk carton so that you 

00:03:01.589 --> 00:03:04.519
 shines the milk in one go 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:07.699
 and that is therefore added directly to the suitcase 

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:09.679
 we also see further 

00:03:09.679 --> 00:03:12.759
 the removable drip tray so you how easy the army 

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:17.319
 we are going to make a cup of coffee 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:20.339
 Selecting 

00:03:20.339 --> 00:03:23.529
 the cup of coffee we want 

00:03:23.529 --> 00:03:25.699
 a perfect inhibiting case 

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:27.319
 you press start 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:30.319
 and then winning starts immediately 

00:03:58.219 --> 00:04:02.629
 after the other but by taeke 5 2 6 2 and 5 0 the dead 2 0 line 

00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:05.960
 it is actually almost identical to the other model 

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:07.789
 apart from a few small dots 

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:10.789
 she sits on top of no parma place 

00:04:11.339 --> 00:04:15.239
 in the menu you do not have a choice of report specialties as you add it to 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:17.049
 but you have the other 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:18.459
 and here is no knots 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:21.479
 9 can make two cups of coffee in profit 

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:24.969
 what can you of course do with the coffee maker 

00:04:24.969 --> 00:04:28.189
 but again with an angry button 

00:04:28.189 --> 00:04:31.409
 and the reason that you cannot prepare milk specialties in 

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:32.580
 one time is because 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:35.370
 the milk does not come out in this case 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.720
 into the coffee is processed as is the case with the others 

00:04:39.319 --> 00:04:42.749
 we do see the tube that you can just hang in the milk so that you 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:46.319
 automatically stored mel 

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:48.400
 and that is something nice about the 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.490
 on the beach at feyenoord if you are prepared to go 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:54.490
 then hot water is automatically prepared 

00:04:55.449 --> 00:04:58.059
 that leaves them but that we are going to watch is actually a bit 

00:04:58.059 --> 00:04:59.710
 outside the ecu series 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:04.270
 but still wanted to show that is namely pk 5 89 nl 

00:05:05.719 --> 00:05:06.889
 on top of 

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:08.849
 simone bolelli and black 

00:05:08.849 --> 00:05:12.069
 it is not hacked or processed once, it is on the back 

00:05:12.069 --> 00:05:14.330
 with a choice of three positions 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:17.080
 fine their faith 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.080
 we also see here the removable water is true 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:25.129
 a bartender 

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:27.729
 you can also place the cups 

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:30.080
 further we see more too 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:33.080
 a circulation for ground coffee 

00:05:37.389 --> 00:05:40.970
 siem and the buttons can adjust how much waterings the coffee leaves 

00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:42.080
 walk 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:45.080
 and see natural display 

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:48.650
 a button with which you can set the water 

00:05:49.199 --> 00:05:50.639
 which you use the 

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:53.650
 can set coffee strength 

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:55.550
 many see in a single fight 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:58.550
 but participation automatically switches off after a certain time 

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:01.960
 and then usually buy one can prepare 

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.910
 then you are still just to turn this newspaper to the right and then there comes 

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:07.910
 automatically set tone from steam nozzle 

00:06:08.449 --> 00:06:09.580
 and we also see 

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:11.430
 the coffee is running out 

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:14.430
 hereafter height is adjustable as with all machines 

00:06:14.999 --> 00:06:16.770
 and maybe also 

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:18.199
 that the drip tray is removable
