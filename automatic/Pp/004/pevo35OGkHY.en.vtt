the<00:00:42.450> other<00:00:42.480> soccer<00:00:43.079> players<00:00:43.410> then<00:00:44.399> you<00:00:44.489> have

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
the other soccer players then you have

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.700 
the other soccer players then you have
to<00:00:44.730> pay<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:44.969> price<00:00:45.140> maybe<00:00:46.140> it's<00:00:46.350> not<00:00:46.469> gonna

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
to pay the price maybe it's not gonna

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.889 
to pay the price maybe it's not gonna
it's<00:00:47.370> gonna<00:00:47.670> feel<00:00:47.910> a<00:00:47.940> little<00:00:48.210> lame<00:00:48.450> to<00:00:48.719> ask

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
it's gonna feel a little lame to ask

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.440 
it's gonna feel a little lame to ask
someone<00:00:49.260> to<00:00:49.500> follow<00:00:50.460> me<00:00:50.640> all<00:00:50.790> the<00:00:50.820> time

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:51.450 
someone to follow me all the time

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:56.299 
someone to follow me all the time
but<00:00:52.260> I<00:00:52.350> think<00:00:52.590> it's<00:00:52.680> gonna<00:00:52.800> pay<00:00:52.890> off<00:00:53.309> and<00:00:55.309> so

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
but I think it's gonna pay off and so

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.690 
but I think it's gonna pay off and so
yeah<00:00:57.230> the<00:00:58.230> idea<00:00:58.559> is<00:00:58.710> basically<00:00:58.950> to<00:00:59.219> create<00:00:59.550> a

00:00:59.690 --> 00:00:59.700 
yeah the idea is basically to create a

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.740 
yeah the idea is basically to create a
video<00:00:59.969> of<00:01:00.210> yourself<00:01:00.300> a<00:01:01.129> credibility<00:01:02.129> video

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:02.750 
video of yourself a credibility video

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:04.939 
video of yourself a credibility video
where<00:01:03.750> you<00:01:03.870> kind<00:01:04.110> of<00:01:04.140> show<00:01:04.350> off<00:01:04.530> your<00:01:04.680> skills

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
where you kind of show off your skills

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.410 
where you kind of show off your skills
okay<00:01:05.789> and<00:01:06.440> that's<00:01:07.440> going<00:01:07.680> to<00:01:08.070> help<00:01:08.220> and<00:01:08.580> it's

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
okay and that's going to help and it's

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.109 
okay and that's going to help and it's
you're<00:01:10.140> separating<00:01:10.860> yourself<00:01:11.580> just<00:01:11.789> by

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
you're separating yourself just by

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.960 
you're separating yourself just by
having<00:01:12.390> a<00:01:12.810> video<00:01:12.990> like<00:01:13.350> that<00:01:13.380> from<00:01:14.340> all<00:01:14.729> other

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.500 
it's really probably good to have those
in<00:02:11.009> pain<00:02:11.250> because<00:02:11.700> they<00:02:11.880> will<00:02:12.060> think<00:02:12.239> that<00:02:12.390> you

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
in pain because they will think that you

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.500 
in pain because they will think that you
just<00:02:12.750> will<00:02:12.930> think

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
just will think

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.880 
just will think

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.330 
mean this is amazing I mean that goal
he'd<00:02:19.989> you<00:02:20.140> three<00:02:20.409> players<00:02:20.680> and<00:02:20.950> then<00:02:21.040> the<00:02:21.159> ball

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
he'd you three players and then the ball

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.670 
he'd you three players and then the ball
from<00:02:22.000> 25<00:02:22.540> years<00:02:22.780> up<00:02:22.989> in<00:02:23.080> that<00:02:23.230> home<00:02:23.409> to<00:02:23.440> the

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
from 25 years up in that home to the

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.490 
from 25 years up in that home to the
corner<00:02:24.069> and<00:02:24.330> the<00:02:25.330> crowd<00:02:25.569> went<00:02:25.750> wild<00:02:25.989> it<00:02:26.260> was<00:02:26.319> an

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
corner and the crowd went wild it was an

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.320 
corner and the crowd went wild it was an
important<00:02:26.830> goal<00:02:26.950> and<00:02:27.129> all<00:02:27.250> the<00:02:27.340> stuff<00:02:27.549> then

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
important goal and all the stuff then

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:29.910 
important goal and all the stuff then
they<00:02:28.540> were<00:02:28.599> staying<00:02:28.900> home<00:02:29.379> he's<00:02:29.680> probably

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
they were staying home he's probably

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.789 
they were staying home he's probably
that<00:02:30.340> way<00:02:31.060> all<00:02:31.750> the<00:02:31.810> time

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:32.799 
that way all the time

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:36.180 
that way all the time
it's<00:02:33.430> probably<00:02:33.670> not<00:02:33.790> moving<00:02:34.090> them<00:02:34.830> so<00:02:35.830> create

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
it's probably not moving them so create

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.190 
it's probably not moving them so create
an<00:02:36.310> amazing<00:02:36.610> video<00:02:37.180> which<00:02:37.390> should<00:02:37.660> be<00:02:37.840> not

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
an amazing video which should be not

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.770 
an amazing video which should be not
here<00:02:38.349> long<00:02:38.620> should<00:02:39.010> be<00:02:39.160> maybe<00:02:39.760> between<00:02:40.390> two

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
here long should be maybe between two

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:41.930 
here long should be maybe between two
and<00:02:40.989> four<00:02:41.230> minutes

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
and four minutes

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.640 
and four minutes
might've<00:02:42.940> users<00:02:43.360> sometimes<00:02:43.599> it's<00:02:43.900> extending

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
might've users sometimes it's extending

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.530 
might've users sometimes it's extending
four<00:02:44.950> or<00:02:45.010> five<00:02:45.190> six<00:02:45.549> minutes<00:02:45.730> which<00:02:46.510> is

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
four or five six minutes which is

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.809 
four or five six minutes which is
something<00:02:47.260> I<00:02:47.440> apologize<00:02:47.920> about<00:02:48.220> and<00:02:48.489> I'm
