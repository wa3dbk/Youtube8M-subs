00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:13.490
 ah 

00:00:10.179 --> 00:00:15.199
 and we still have not decided when we're going 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.480
 to show our new console and the 

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:18.829
 next e3 is a possibility what 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.810
 important is that in the presentation 

00:00:18.829 --> 00:00:22.640
 we wanted to focus on the 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.349
 philosophy and the principles that have 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.050
 led to the development and design of 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:28.489
 playstation 4 we wanted to show 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.619
 the games that are currently already 

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:32.840
 running on ps4 show 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:35.739
 real demonstrations and teach the new 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.739
 I'm running 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.060
 in time 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:41.890
 I am going to detention 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:43.420
 and at the same time we wanted to put the 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.120
 focus on the new button built into the 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:48.010
 I send the share button that integrates one 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:51.400
 of the principles behind ps4 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:53.110
 the connectivity and the social element so 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.780
 just by pressing it you can show your 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:57.430
 gameplays your friends upload them to a 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.830
 social network or hosting service 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:01.450
 of videos we have decided to put the focus 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:03.610
 in the social element in the new 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:07.590
 functions and in the new command and show 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:07.590
 console on another date later 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.590
 i 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:21.359
 and it is already 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.159
 we've talked to a lot of developers 

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:25.020
 not only with the members of sony 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.060
 worldwide studios but also with 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.740
 members of making parties about what 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.200
 they would like to be able to do in the games of 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.819
 future and many of them told us that 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.740
 today's players live in a world 

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:36.569
 socially connected they use 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.880
 portable devices like smartphone 

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:41.119
 and tablets and all are connected to each 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.119
 with others 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.270
 because we are not going to use that 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.520
 feature and add it to our 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.740
 games we can make it very easy 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.149
 share what you 're doing or see what 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.460
 what are your friends doing with their 

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:56.049
 video games we believe that this 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.149
 social experience is really 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:59.679
 important for today's players and 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:02.070
 it is also for developers 

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:02.070
 of video games 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:18.020
 and the playstation network services 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.120
 they will need ps4 to be connected to 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.340
 internet the rest of services do not 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.840
 they will need all the time to have a 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.060
 total experience we recommend 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.070
 always have a connection to 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.810
 internet so that games or 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:31.820
 applications are updated so 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.040
 constant to see what they are 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:35.600
 making our friends to see what 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.550
 game just bought some of your 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.740
 friends and being able to play with him so 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:41.630
 immediately all these services and 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:43.760
 experiences are lost if you're not 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.620
 connected to the internet so it's not about 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.630
 of an obligation the console works 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.280
 without being connected but of the 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:52.750
 benefits you receive if you connect 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.750
 playstation 4 to internet 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.630
 valentine 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.720
 we are going to provide a 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:08.209
 official playstation application for 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:10.310
 ios and android devices that you can 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:11.780
 download from stores and with which 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:14.540
 you can connect your smartphone or your 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.430
 tablet to your brett ps4 in this way 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:19.810
 You can also access the contents 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.810
 of your games through this application 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.020
 I am soft hurting 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.010
 but the developers have the 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:28.110
 option to use this application 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.510
 official to interact with your games 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:32.160
 or develop an own application with 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.930
 your own contents and your own 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:37.250
 game options for your new 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.250
 psa 4 titles 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.900
 uy 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.310
 we are looking at the possibility of 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.709
 use the gaikai service of 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.630
 multiple forms of vine perry explained in 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:53.430
 the presentation a way to use the 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:54.930
 technology if you want to try 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.180
 any of the games in the store 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:59.610
 before buying it you can do it 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.090
 immediate way 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:02.950
 exciting 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:05.080
 this is a very exciting option for 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:07.390
 we on the other hand are going to be able 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:11.050
 offer old games this allows 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:13.629
 bring ps ps3 ps2 titles to 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:14.769
 through the gaikai service but we are 

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:16.750
 seeing different ways of offering 

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:19.449
 different gaikai service packages 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:21.720
 that will be integrated into the services of ps 

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:21.720
 network 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:32.870
 we can not guarantee one hundred percent if 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:34.970
 ps4 reach europe also on that date 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:36.800
 because although we are in the final phase 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:38.450
 of the development of the machine still not 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.130
 is complete and now we have to see 

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:42.440
 the delivery times the times of 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:44.810
 manufacturing there are many factors that 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:47.210
 will influence the launch but we're going to 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:48.680
 try to launch ps4 at the end of this 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:51.910
 year in the largest number of territories 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.910
 that we can 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:01.000
 we love giving the possibility of 

00:04:59.379 --> 00:05:04.419
 provide a cross - game experience 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.280
 with ps vita and ps3 titles and we're going 

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:09.330
 to continue doing it the same with ps vita 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.330
 ips 4 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:16.539
 we do not intend to offer the same 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:20.020
 game with two versions in different 

00:05:16.539 --> 00:05:22.240
 generations like ps3 and ps four but 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:24.330
 We are open to different ideas like 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:26.830
 when we have brought ps2 ps3 games 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:29.530
 as with software or shadow of the 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:31.599
 colossus in many cases those games have 

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:32.680
 looked great on the new platform to 

00:05:31.599 --> 00:05:35.229
 people already like the 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:37.090
 developers we can also go back to 

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:39.129
 do it but we will put the focus on 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:41.340
 develop new titles for the new 

00:05:39.129 --> 00:05:41.340
 platform 

00:05:49.699 --> 00:05:53.669
 you know 

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:56.430
 We will offer many more services 

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:59.009
 online in ps4 through playstation 

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:01.770
 network and we will continue to strengthen the 

00:05:59.009 --> 00:06:03.509
 subscription service ps plus 

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:05.310
 we are still deciding how they will be 

00:06:03.509 --> 00:06:07.440
 the different service options 

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:09.570
 online that we are going to offer to 

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:12.770
 users including the options of 

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:12.770
 cloud gaming and so on
