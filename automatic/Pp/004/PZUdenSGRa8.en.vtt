so<00:01:43.560> we<00:01:43.649> can<00:01:43.860> go<00:01:43.950> into<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.280> output<00:01:44.670> thing<00:01:45.469> table

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
so we can go into the output thing table

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.109 
so we can go into the output thing table
this<00:01:49.020> is<00:01:49.200> for<00:01:49.409> this<00:01:50.189> can<00:01:50.399> charge<00:01:50.610> any<00:01:50.759> battery

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
this is for this can charge any battery

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.130 
this is for this can charge any battery
because<00:01:51.329> you<00:01:51.509> all<00:01:51.570> you<00:01:51.659> have<00:01:51.750> to<00:01:51.840> do<00:01:51.930> is<00:01:52.020> hook

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
because you all you have to do is hook

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:58.810 
because you all you have to do is hook
it<00:01:52.290> up<00:01:52.380> to<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.530> metal<00:01:52.770> part<00:01:55.610> balancer<00:01:56.610> 1260

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820 
it up to the metal part balancer 1260

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:02.109 
it up to the metal part balancer 1260
let's<00:01:59.820> see<00:02:00.030> what<00:02:00.149> else<00:02:00.210> so<00:02:00.600> here<00:02:00.840> we<00:02:00.930> go<00:02:01.079> okay

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119 
let's see what else so here we go okay

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:04.990 
let's see what else so here we go okay
this<00:02:03.119> is<00:02:03.329> just<00:02:03.360> different<00:02:03.750> charge<00:02:04.229> things

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
this is just different charge things

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.690 
this is just different charge things
don't<00:02:06.000> want<00:02:06.180> that<00:02:06.240> therefore<00:02:06.420> but<00:02:06.780> whatever

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
don't want that therefore but whatever

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.300 
don't want that therefore but whatever
banana<00:02:08.700> connector<00:02:09.830> don't<00:02:10.830> think<00:02:11.009> that<00:02:11.100> comes

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
banana connector don't think that comes

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.680 
banana connector don't think that comes
with<00:02:11.460> it<00:02:11.490> but<00:02:11.790> I<00:02:11.940> just<00:02:12.090> put<00:02:12.480> it<00:02:12.600> now

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
with it but I just put it now

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.570 
with it but I just put it now
okay<00:02:13.990> so<00:02:14.050> let's<00:02:14.410> get<00:02:14.530> into<00:02:14.590> the<00:02:14.830> actual<00:02:15.100> charge

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
okay so let's get into the actual charge

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:24.120 
okay so let's get into the actual charge
so<00:02:19.830> so<00:02:20.830> this<00:02:21.160> is<00:02:21.190> the<00:02:21.370> charger<00:02:22.770> it's<00:02:23.770> pretty

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
so so this is the charger it's pretty

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.440 
so so this is the charger it's pretty

Pete and you can change that and the

00:05:50.289 --> 00:05:54.930 
Pete and you can change that and the
default<00:05:51.219> it's<00:05:51.520> a<00:05:51.610> default<00:05:52.050> input<00:05:53.339> in<00:05:54.339> power

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:54.940 
default it's a default input in power

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:58.230 
default it's a default input in power
voltage<00:05:55.500> 12.4<00:05:56.500> 0<00:05:57.210> external<00:05:58.210> temperature

00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:58.240 
voltage 12.4 0 external temperature

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:01.110 
voltage 12.4 0 external temperature
there's<00:05:58.839> none<00:05:59.020> right<00:05:59.259> now<00:06:00.120> temperature

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:01.120 
there's none right now temperature

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:02.490 
there's none right now temperature
cutoff<00:06:01.389> is<00:06:01.479> 80<00:06:01.659> degrees<00:06:01.960> so<00:06:02.169> I<00:06:02.199> guess

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:02.500 
cutoff is 80 degrees so I guess

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:06.480 
cutoff is 80 degrees so I guess
overheated<00:06:03.779> and<00:06:04.779> its<00:06:05.319> safety<00:06:05.770> timer<00:06:06.129> so<00:06:06.339> it's

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:06.490 
overheated and its safety timer so it's

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:08.070 
overheated and its safety timer so it's
over<00:06:06.669> 120<00:06:07.180> minutes<00:06:07.419> it'll<00:06:07.539> automatically

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:08.080 
over 120 minutes it'll automatically

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:12.600 
over 120 minutes it'll automatically
shut<00:06:08.349> down<00:06:09.509> so<00:06:10.509> much<00:06:10.719> it<00:06:10.930> and<00:06:11.199> it'll<00:06:11.469> like<00:06:12.310> a

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:12.610 
shut down so much it and it'll like a

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:14.879 
shut down so much it and it'll like a
default<00:06:13.539> it'll<00:06:13.839> just<00:06:13.990> go<00:06:14.110> back<00:06:14.259> to<00:06:14.289> the<00:06:14.560> normal

00:06:14.879 --> 00:06:14.889 
default it'll just go back to the normal

00:06:14.889 --> 00:06:17.309 
default it'll just go back to the normal
