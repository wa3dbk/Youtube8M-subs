now rocks it's rockin that's why I put
these<00:00:07.350> shims<00:00:07.620> in<00:00:07.799> I<00:00:07.980> see<00:00:08.400> you<00:00:08.550> put<00:00:08.700> some<00:00:08.910> shims

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
these shims in I see you put some shims

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.480 
these shims in I see you put some shims
let<00:00:09.809> me<00:00:09.900> explain<00:00:10.139> what's<00:00:10.320> going<00:00:10.380> on<00:00:10.710> this<00:00:11.309> is

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
let me explain what's going on this is

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.970 
let me explain what's going on this is
called<00:00:11.700> a<00:00:11.940> cast<00:00:12.300> iron<00:00:12.660> closet<00:00:13.440> flange<00:00:13.740> that

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
called a cast iron closet flange that

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.609 
called a cast iron closet flange that
the<00:00:14.190> toilet<00:00:14.519> attaches<00:00:14.969> to<00:00:15.179> this<00:00:16.020> is<00:00:16.260> installed

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
the toilet attaches to this is installed

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.859 
the toilet attaches to this is installed
at<00:00:16.890> the<00:00:17.010> height<00:00:17.220> of<00:00:17.400> the<00:00:17.490> old<00:00:17.699> floor

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
at the height of the old floor

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.109 
at the height of the old floor
you<00:00:19.710> built<00:00:19.980> this<00:00:20.160> floor<00:00:20.430> up<00:00:20.609> but<00:00:20.760> didn't<00:00:21.000> come

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
you built this floor up but didn't come

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:22.490 
you built this floor up but didn't come
up<00:00:21.270> high<00:00:21.480> enough<00:00:21.689> to<00:00:21.869> be<00:00:21.990> at<00:00:22.109> the<00:00:22.230> height<00:00:22.410> of

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
up high enough to be at the height of

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.140 
up high enough to be at the height of
the<00:00:22.560> old<00:00:22.710> floor<00:00:22.920> so<00:00:23.070> it's<00:00:23.220> it's<00:00:23.400> too<00:00:23.640> high<00:00:23.850> now

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
the old floor so it's it's too high now

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.480 
the old floor so it's it's too high now
the<00:00:24.210> toilet<00:00:24.660> rocks<00:00:24.930> we<00:00:25.830> also<00:00:26.010> have<00:00:26.250> to<00:00:26.369> think

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
the toilet rocks we also have to think

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:27.769 
the toilet rocks we also have to think
about<00:00:26.609> replacing<00:00:27.029> this<00:00:27.210> plans<00:00:27.449> for<00:00:27.599> another

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
about replacing this plans for another

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.200 
about replacing this plans for another
reason<00:00:28.019> it's<00:00:28.500> broken<00:00:28.890> it<00:00:29.250> should<00:00:29.970> look<00:00:30.150> like

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
reason it's broken it should look like

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.240 
reason it's broken it should look like
this<00:00:30.570> on<00:00:30.750> this<00:00:30.929> side<00:00:30.990> and<00:00:31.410> it's<00:00:31.560> broken<00:00:31.800> off<00:00:32.070> on

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
this on this side and it's broken off on

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.549 
this on this side and it's broken off on
this<00:00:32.430> side<00:00:32.669> and<00:00:33.030> that's<00:00:33.630> how<00:00:33.899> you<00:00:33.960> secure<00:00:34.380> the

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
this side and that's how you secure the

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.290 
this side and that's how you secure the
toilet<00:00:34.950> so<00:00:35.070> you<00:00:35.160> make<00:00:35.280> a<00:00:35.309> nice<00:00:35.520> tight<00:00:35.760> seal<00:00:36.090> so

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
toilet so you make a nice tight seal so

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.000 
toilet so you make a nice tight seal so
we<00:00:36.719> have<00:00:36.840> no<00:00:36.989> other<00:00:37.140> choice<00:00:37.260> but<00:00:37.620> to<00:00:37.680> break

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
we have no other choice but to break

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.680 
we have no other choice but to break
this<00:00:38.250> flange<00:00:38.579> away<00:00:38.969> we've<00:00:39.180> got<00:00:39.300> to<00:00:39.360> be<00:00:39.450> very

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
this flange away we've got to be very

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.450 
this flange away we've got to be very
very<00:00:39.989> careful<00:00:40.200> and<00:00:40.590> we've<00:00:40.950> got<00:00:41.040> to<00:00:41.129> do<00:00:41.280> it

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
very careful and we've got to do it

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.430 
very careful and we've got to do it
without<00:00:41.579> breaking<00:00:41.910> this<00:00:42.420> inner<00:00:42.840> pipe<00:00:43.230> the

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
without breaking this inner pipe the

without breaking this inner pipe the
closet<00:00:43.890> Ben<00:00:44.040> because<00:00:44.250> if<00:00:44.309> we<00:00:44.399> do<00:00:44.579> that<00:00:44.789> it's<00:00:45.120> a

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
closet Ben because if we do that it's a

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.330 
closet Ben because if we do that it's a
big<00:00:45.719> deal<00:00:45.989> all<00:00:46.890> right

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340

the closet flange is made out of cast

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.619 
the closet flange is made out of cast
iron<00:00:49.590> we<00:00:50.489> can<00:00:50.640> actually<00:00:50.820> break<00:00:51.270> it<00:00:51.480> because

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
iron we can actually break it because

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.990 
iron we can actually break it because
it's<00:00:52.050> brittle<00:00:52.500> by<00:00:52.949> using<00:00:53.309> this<00:00:53.460> it's<00:00:53.730> called<00:00:53.910> a

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
it's brittle by using this it's called a

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000 
it's brittle by using this it's called a
cold<00:00:54.300> chisel<00:00:54.600> as<00:00:54.809> a<00:00:54.840> sharp<00:00:55.170> point<00:00:55.500> right<00:00:55.680> here

cold chisel as a sharp point right here
and<00:00:56.699> I<00:00:56.879> want<00:00:57.000> to<00:00:57.120> be<00:00:57.210> careful<00:00:57.629> to<00:00:57.809> just<00:00:58.170> break

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
and I want to be careful to just break

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:05.810 
and I want to be careful to just break
this<00:00:58.649> and<00:00:58.890> not<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.340> pipe<00:00:59.579> itself<00:01:04.369> and<00:01:05.369> now<00:01:05.729> I'm

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
this and not the pipe itself and now I'm

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.359 
this and not the pipe itself and now I'm
going<00:01:05.939> to<00:01:06.030> try<00:01:06.240> to<00:01:06.299> pry<00:01:06.659> it<00:01:06.720> up<00:01:06.960> using<00:01:07.950> a<00:01:08.100> flat

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
going to try to pry it up using a flat

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:09.920 
going to try to pry it up using a flat
bar<00:01:08.670> we're<00:01:08.820> going<00:01:08.970> to<00:01:09.119> protect<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.630> floor

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
bar we're going to protect the floor

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:15.200 
bar we're going to protect the floor
using<00:01:10.770> an<00:01:10.890> old<00:01:11.040> shim<00:01:11.460> good<00:01:13.580> this<00:01:14.580> is<00:01:14.820> actually

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
using an old shim good this is actually

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.450 
using an old shim good this is actually
a<00:01:15.240> compression<00:01:15.869> flange<00:01:16.409> we're<00:01:17.159> going<00:01:17.280> to<00:01:17.340> be

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
a compression flange we're going to be

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.770 
a compression flange we're going to be
using<00:01:17.700> a<00:01:18.470> rubber<00:01:19.470> gasket<00:01:20.090> and<00:01:21.090> that<00:01:21.600> will<00:01:21.689> make

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
using a rubber gasket and that will make

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.899 
using a rubber gasket and that will make
a<00:01:21.840> nice<00:01:22.080> tight<00:01:22.439> seal<00:01:22.680> between<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.100> bend<00:01:23.610> and

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
a nice tight seal between the bend and

a nice tight seal between the bend and
the<00:01:24.150> flange<00:01:24.420> but<00:01:25.020> before<00:01:25.259> we<00:01:25.320> go<00:01:25.439> any<00:01:25.470> farther

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
the flange but before we go any farther

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.499 
the flange but before we go any farther
we<00:01:25.920> got<00:01:26.040> to<00:01:26.100> be<00:01:26.189> sure<00:01:26.220> we<00:01:26.460> get<00:01:26.580> this<00:01:26.820> flange<00:01:27.150> all

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
we got to be sure we get this flange all

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.060 
we got to be sure we get this flange all
the<00:01:27.720> way<00:01:27.810> down<00:01:27.960> to<00:01:28.200> that<00:01:28.229> floor<00:01:28.650> or<00:01:28.950> the

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
the way down to that floor or the

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.399 
the way down to that floor or the
toilets<00:01:29.400> going<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:29.610> rock<00:01:29.790> to<00:01:30.540> do<00:01:30.720> that<00:01:30.960> we<00:01:31.170> set

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
toilets going to rock to do that we set

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.560 
toilets going to rock to do that we set
in<00:01:31.560> place<00:01:31.829> just<00:01:32.189> see<00:01:32.939> where<00:01:33.119> we<00:01:33.240> hit<00:01:33.390> in<00:01:33.479> the

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
in place just see where we hit in the

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.020 
in place just see where we hit in the
tile<00:01:33.840> make<00:01:34.380> our<00:01:34.590> mark<00:01:34.860> and<00:01:35.130> we<00:01:35.520> can<00:01:35.670> chisel<00:01:35.970> it

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
tile make our mark and we can chisel it

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:42.710 
tile make our mark and we can chisel it
away<00:01:39.320> okay<00:01:40.320> that<00:01:40.890> should<00:01:41.009> be<00:01:41.159> enough<00:01:41.720> let's

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
away okay that should be enough let's

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.170 
away okay that should be enough let's
see<00:01:42.930> how<00:01:43.079> we<00:01:43.140> did<00:01:43.470> ooh<00:01:43.649> nice<00:01:44.100> we<00:01:44.850> are<00:01:44.970> right

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
see how we did ooh nice we are right

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.999 
see how we did ooh nice we are right
down<00:01:45.420> tight<00:01:45.930> right<00:01:46.320> there<00:01:46.350> so<00:01:46.770> that<00:01:46.890> means

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
down tight right there so that means

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.580 
down tight right there so that means
that<00:01:47.220> toilet<00:01:47.610> is<00:01:47.700> not<00:01:47.850> going<00:01:48.119> to<00:01:48.210> wobble<00:01:48.590> all

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
that toilet is not going to wobble all

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.109 
that toilet is not going to wobble all
right<00:01:49.770> we<00:01:49.890> can<00:01:50.040> now<00:01:50.130> make<00:01:50.310> our<00:01:50.460> connection<00:01:50.939> so

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
right we can now make our connection so

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.480 
right we can now make our connection so
there's<00:01:51.270> a<00:01:51.329> rubber<00:01:51.659> gasket<00:01:52.130> with<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.220> taper

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
there's a rubber gasket with the taper

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:59.510 
there's a rubber gasket with the taper
going<00:01:53.939> down<00:01:54.210> we<00:01:54.840> put<00:01:55.079> that<00:01:55.200> in<00:01:55.380> first<00:01:58.520> now

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
going down we put that in first now

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.859 
going down we put that in first now
there's<00:01:59.700> a<00:01:59.759> brass<00:02:00.000> ring<00:02:00.390> that's<00:02:00.689> going<00:02:00.810> to

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
there's a brass ring that's going to

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.959 
there's a brass ring that's going to
allow<00:02:01.110> for<00:02:01.340> stainless<00:02:02.340> steel<00:02:03.320> bolts<00:02:04.729> to<00:02:05.729> push

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
allow for stainless steel bolts to push

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.100 
allow for stainless steel bolts to push
that<00:02:06.149> down<00:02:06.390> I'm<00:02:06.540> just<00:02:06.570> going<00:02:06.780> to<00:02:06.840> tap<00:02:07.079> that

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
that down I'm just going to tap that

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.050 
that down I'm just going to tap that
down

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.760 

so<00:02:11.060> that<00:02:11.270> seems<00:02:11.540> down<00:02:11.840> enough<00:02:12.260> and<00:02:12.500> now<00:02:12.710> we

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
so that seems down enough and now we

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.100 
so that seems down enough and now we
have<00:02:13.010> four<00:02:13.280> stainless<00:02:13.730> steel<00:02:14.120> bolts<00:02:14.630> all

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
have four stainless steel bolts all

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:16.960 
have four stainless steel bolts all
right<00:02:15.440> now<00:02:15.920> we<00:02:16.130> just<00:02:16.310> tighten<00:02:16.550> them<00:02:16.700> up<00:02:16.760> with<00:02:16.940> a

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
right now we just tighten them up with a

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.670 
right now we just tighten them up with a
socket<00:02:17.270> wrench<00:02:19.630> I'm<00:02:20.630> just<00:02:20.810> doing<00:02:21.020> each<00:02:21.200> bolt<00:02:21.530> a

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
socket wrench I'm just doing each bolt a

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.560 
socket wrench I'm just doing each bolt a
little<00:02:22.010> bit<00:02:22.130> of<00:02:22.280> time<00:02:22.580> so<00:02:22.610> I<00:02:22.910> drive<00:02:23.270> that

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:23.570 
little bit of time so I drive that

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:29.080 
little bit of time so I drive that
rubber<00:02:23.810> gasket<00:02:24.320> down<00:02:24.500> evenly<00:02:27.550> okay<00:02:28.550> so<00:02:28.880> now<00:02:29.000> we

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
rubber gasket down evenly okay so now we

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:30.550 
rubber gasket down evenly okay so now we
have<00:02:29.330> a<00:02:29.360> nice<00:02:29.570> tight<00:02:29.840> seal<00:02:30.050> between<00:02:30.260> the

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
have a nice tight seal between the

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.650 
have a nice tight seal between the
flange<00:02:30.980> and<00:02:31.340> the<00:02:31.490> bend<00:02:31.790> and<00:02:32.060> the<00:02:32.270> flange<00:02:32.480> is

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
flange and the bend and the flange is

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.150 
flange and the bend and the flange is
right<00:02:32.870> down<00:02:33.080> tight<00:02:33.380> to<00:02:33.410> the<00:02:33.650> floor<00:02:33.890> so<00:02:34.070> that's

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
right down tight to the floor so that's

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.220 
right down tight to the floor so that's
good<00:02:34.490> now<00:02:35.150> we<00:02:35.210> need<00:02:35.420> to<00:02:35.540> make<00:02:35.660> a<00:02:35.690> connection

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
good now we need to make a connection

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.620 
good now we need to make a connection
between<00:02:36.350> the<00:02:36.770> flange<00:02:37.100> and<00:02:37.430> the<00:02:37.610> toilet<00:02:38.030> for

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
between the flange and the toilet for

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:40.750 
between the flange and the toilet for
that<00:02:38.810> we<00:02:39.350> use<00:02:39.500> this<00:02:39.740> it's<00:02:39.950> called<00:02:40.070> a<00:02:40.220> closet

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760

bolt as an oval-shaped at the base and
that<00:02:44.270> goes<00:02:44.450> into<00:02:44.630> a<00:02:44.750> key<00:02:45.020> way<00:02:45.200> right<00:02:45.470> here<00:02:46.270> okay

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.270 
that goes into a key way right here okay

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:48.910 
that goes into a key way right here okay
and<00:02:47.450> we<00:02:47.870> hold<00:02:48.170> that<00:02:48.290> right<00:02:48.440> to<00:02:48.590> the<00:02:48.680> center

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
and we hold that right to the center

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.920 
and we hold that right to the center
point<00:02:49.190> right<00:02:49.400> there<00:02:49.600> another<00:02:50.600> one<00:02:50.780> the

is<00:03:22.430> a<00:03:22.459> white<00:03:22.760> plastic<00:03:23.300> base<00:03:23.510> flat<00:03:24.110> side<00:03:24.410> up

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
is a white plastic base flat side up

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:29.590 
is a white plastic base flat side up
there's<00:03:25.040> a<00:03:25.100> washer<00:03:25.340> then<00:03:26.120> there's<00:03:26.360> a<00:03:26.420> nut<00:03:28.600> okay

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:29.600 
there's a washer then there's a nut okay

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.000 
there's a washer then there's a nut okay
now<00:03:29.900> we<00:03:29.959> tighten<00:03:30.320> it<00:03:30.350> up<00:03:30.470> with<00:03:30.530> a<00:03:30.680> socket

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
now we tighten it up with a socket

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:35.970 
now we tighten it up with a socket
wrench<00:03:33.640> okay<00:03:34.640> that<00:03:34.970> should<00:03:35.240> do<00:03:35.450> it<00:03:35.600> I<00:03:35.690> think

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
wrench okay that should do it I think

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.150 
wrench okay that should do it I think
now<00:03:36.980> these<00:03:37.310> brass<00:03:37.640> bolts<00:03:38.209> are<00:03:38.330> left<00:03:38.660> long

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
now these brass bolts are left long

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.440 
now these brass bolts are left long
because<00:03:40.160> of<00:03:40.190> that<00:03:40.370> the<00:03:40.550> caps<00:03:40.790> won't<00:03:41.060> fit<00:03:41.270> on

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 
because of that the caps won't fit on

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:43.090 
because of that the caps won't fit on
unless<00:03:41.660> you<00:03:41.690> cut<00:03:41.959> them<00:03:42.110> off<00:03:42.290> so<00:03:42.560> for<00:03:42.770> that<00:03:42.890> we

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:43.100 
unless you cut them off so for that we

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:45.000 
unless you cut them off so for that we
use<00:03:43.250> a<00:03:43.280> mini<00:03:43.640> hacksaw

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
use a mini hacksaw

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.590 
use a mini hacksaw
