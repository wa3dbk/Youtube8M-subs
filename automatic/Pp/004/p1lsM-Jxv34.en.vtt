things of that nature so if we swipe up
on<00:00:24.000> safari<00:00:24.510> we<00:00:25.230> get<00:00:25.470> some<00:00:26.060> options<00:00:27.060> here<00:00:27.119> we

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
on safari we get some options here we

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
could put in a password here but I'm

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.100 
could put in a password here but I'm
going<00:00:35.370> to<00:00:35.430> go<00:00:35.579> ahead<00:00:35.730> and<00:00:35.940> turn<00:00:36.300> that<00:00:36.540> option

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
going to go ahead and turn that option

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.950 
going to go ahead and turn that option
off<00:00:37.290> just<00:00:38.219> because<00:00:38.399> I<00:00:38.760> don't<00:00:39.000> want<00:00:39.059> to<00:00:39.450> do<00:00:39.930> that

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
off just because I don't want to do that

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.959 
off just because I don't want to do that
but<00:00:40.500> then<00:00:40.770> you<00:00:40.980> would<00:00:41.160> just<00:00:41.190> simply<00:00:41.550> tap

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
but then you would just simply tap

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.990 
but then you would just simply tap
launch<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:42.840> application<00:00:43.020> and<00:00:43.829> it<00:00:44.640> would<00:00:44.789> open

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
launch the application and it would open

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.959 
launch the application and it would open
up<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.600> safari<00:00:46.079> app<00:00:46.320> that<00:00:46.590> easy<00:00:46.800> if<00:00:47.370> you<00:00:47.700> had

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
up the safari app that easy if you had

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.500 
up the safari app that easy if you had
the<00:00:48.440> password<00:00:49.440> option<00:00:49.710> chosen<00:00:50.370> then<00:00:51.210> it<00:00:51.360> would

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
the password option chosen then it would

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.450 
the password option chosen then it would
ask<00:00:51.690> you<00:00:51.960> to<00:00:51.989> enter<00:00:52.350> your<00:00:52.500> password<00:00:52.680> before

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
ask you to enter your password before

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.330 
ask you to enter your password before
you<00:00:53.760> could<00:00:54.000> could<00:00:54.449> open<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.410> application<00:00:56.219> and

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
you could could open the application and

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.639 
you could could open the application and
you<00:00:56.820> can<00:00:57.000> do<00:00:57.149> that<00:00:57.360> for<00:00:57.539> any<00:00:57.780> application<00:00:58.500> on

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
you can do that for any application on

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.670 
you can do that for any application on
your<00:00:58.680> device<00:00:58.829> and<00:00:59.340> it<00:00:59.820> just<00:01:00.090> makes<00:01:00.329> it<00:01:00.420> a<00:01:00.690> more

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
your device and it just makes it a more

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.399 
your device and it just makes it a more
a<00:01:01.739> little<00:01:02.100> bit<00:01:02.160> more<00:01:02.430> secure<00:01:03.180> way<00:01:03.390> and<00:01:03.780> gives

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
a little bit more secure way and gives

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:05.870 
a little bit more secure way and gives
you<00:01:04.559> a<00:01:04.589> little<00:01:04.739> bit<00:01:04.860> more<00:01:05.100> control<00:01:05.369> of<00:01:05.640> each

wireless networks and I'd also like to

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.920 
wireless networks and I'd also like to
point<00:01:26.340> out<00:01:26.700> that<00:01:26.759> this<00:01:27.000> is<00:01:27.240> design<00:01:27.630> for<00:01:27.840> the

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
point out that this is design for the

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.670 
point out that this is design for the
iphone<00:01:28.380> and<00:01:28.710> only<00:01:29.340> supports<00:01:29.759> iOS<00:01:29.939> 7<00:01:30.869> and<00:01:30.990> it

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
iphone and only supports iOS 7 and it

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.130 
iphone and only supports iOS 7 and it
does<00:01:31.950> add<00:01:32.220> an<00:01:32.729> icon<00:01:32.970> director<00:01:33.869> to<00:01:34.020> your

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
does add an icon director to your

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.039 
does add an icon director to your
springboard<00:01:34.680> so<00:01:35.009> this<00:01:35.189> is<00:01:35.369> like<00:01:35.549> a<00:01:35.579> an

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:36.049 
springboard so this is like a an

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:38.780 
springboard so this is like a an
application<00:01:37.049> as<00:01:37.229> opposed<00:01:37.560> to<00:01:37.860> more<00:01:38.579> of<00:01:38.640> a

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
application as opposed to more of a

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.420 
application as opposed to more of a
tweak<00:01:39.150> I<00:01:39.329> guess<00:01:39.600> in<00:01:39.930> here<00:01:40.590> it<00:01:40.710> shows<00:01:40.979> you<00:01:41.400> just

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
tweak I guess in here it shows you just

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.280 
tweak I guess in here it shows you just
exactly<00:01:42.240> how<00:01:43.229> your<00:01:43.560> signal<00:01:44.100> strength<00:01:44.430> is<00:01:44.670> and

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.290 
exactly how your signal strength is and

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.080 
exactly how your signal strength is and
some<00:01:46.290> of<00:01:46.409> the<00:01:46.530> different<00:01:46.950> details<00:01:47.130> about<00:01:47.850> it

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
some of the different details about it

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.810 
some of the different details about it
it's<00:01:48.299> got<00:01:48.509> some<00:01:48.780> graphs<00:01:49.110> down<00:01:49.409> here<00:01:49.770> shows<00:01:50.490> a

it's got some graphs down here shows a

it's got some graphs down here shows a

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
often you could increase and decrease

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.110

then you would only see the ones that

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.660

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
were unsecured which all of my networks

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.229 
were unsecured which all of my networks
are<00:03:05.880> secure<00:03:06.330> around<00:03:06.900> me<00:03:07.200> and<00:03:07.470> my<00:03:08.030> network<00:03:09.030> is

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
are secure around me and my network is

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:11.870 
are secure around me and my network is
secure<00:03:09.450> also<00:03:10.049> so<00:03:10.799> that<00:03:11.190> would<00:03:11.340> be<00:03:11.459> a<00:03:11.489> good<00:03:11.670> way

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
secure also so that would be a good way

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.759 
secure also so that would be a good way
