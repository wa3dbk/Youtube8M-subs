00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.969 
is it's not a progressive app and what I
mean<00:01:51.240> is<00:01:51.509> you<00:01:51.750> don't<00:01:52.049> have<00:01:52.350> to<00:01:52.530> complete

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
mean is you don't have to complete

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
anywhere if they're great with addition

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.399 
anywhere if they're great with addition
but<00:01:59.850> they<00:02:00.000> need<00:02:00.180> some<00:02:00.420> help<00:02:00.450> with<00:02:00.840> greater

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
but they need some help with greater

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.679 
but they need some help with greater
than<00:02:01.500> equal<00:02:02.130> to<00:02:02.159> or<00:02:02.310> less<00:02:02.579> then<00:02:02.909> they<00:02:03.540> can

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
instantly go right to the chapter and

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:06.080 
instantly go right to the chapter and
work<00:02:05.610> on<00:02:05.790> it

work on it

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.210 
work on it
so<00:02:06.420> this<00:02:06.899> is<00:02:07.079> definitely<00:02:07.500> something<00:02:07.950> that's

so this is definitely something that's

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.360 
so this is definitely something that's
worth<00:02:08.399> noting<00:02:08.879> because<00:02:09.179> a<00:02:09.390> lot<00:02:10.229> of

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:10.370 
worth noting because a lot of

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:13.100 
worth noting because a lot of
educational<00:02:11.370> apps<00:02:11.580> tend<00:02:11.940> to<00:02:12.060> lock<00:02:12.750> things

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
educational apps tend to lock things

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.820 
educational apps tend to lock things
down<00:02:13.260> like

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
down like

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.520

an<00:02:26.910> adventure<00:02:27.260> learning<00:02:28.260> about<00:02:28.590> math<00:02:28.830> and

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
an adventure learning about math and

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.730 
an adventure learning about math and
this<00:02:30.600> is<00:02:30.780> one<00:02:30.930> of<00:02:31.050> the<00:02:31.110> things<00:02:31.320> that's<00:02:31.470> pretty

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
this is one of the things that's pretty

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.410 
this is one of the things that's pretty
unique<00:02:32.070> to<00:02:32.100> touch<00:02:32.490> math<00:02:32.730> addition<00:02:33.240> one

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
unique to touch math addition one

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.560 
unique to touch math addition one
because<00:02:34.290> not<00:02:35.040> all<00:02:35.220> math<00:02:35.490> games<00:02:35.820> are<00:02:36.000> fun<00:02:36.300> and

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
because not all math games are fun and

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:39.590 
because not all math games are fun and
this<00:02:36.930> is<00:02:36.990> kind<00:02:37.980> of<00:02:38.040> a<00:02:38.160> sad<00:02:38.400> fact<00:02:38.760> but<00:02:39.150> it's<00:02:39.300> true

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
a lot of them focus on repetition and

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.920 
a lot of them focus on repetition and
basically<00:02:42.930> grinding<00:02:43.650> mathematical<00:02:44.460> methods

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
basically grinding mathematical methods

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.260 
basically grinding mathematical methods
into<00:02:45.930> you<00:02:46.410> know<00:02:46.530> a<00:02:46.710> child's<00:02:47.250> mind<00:02:47.460> but<00:02:48.150> they

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
into you know a child's mind but they

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:49.880 
into you know a child's mind but they
don't<00:02:48.480> have<00:02:48.690> fun<00:02:49.080> with<00:02:49.320> it<00:02:49.440> I<00:02:49.560> mean<00:02:49.770> there

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
don't have fun with it I mean there

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.530 
don't have fun with it I mean there
might<00:02:50.070> be<00:02:50.100> fun<00:02:50.430> sound<00:02:50.940> effects<00:02:51.270> or<00:02:51.450> whatever

might be fun sound effects or whatever

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.860 
might be fun sound effects or whatever
but<00:02:52.050> touch<00:02:52.920> math<00:02:53.190> edition<00:02:53.730> one<00:02:53.970> goes<00:02:54.420> way

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
but touch math edition one goes way

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.010 
but touch math edition one goes way
above<00:02:55.200> and<00:02:55.350> beyond<00:02:55.680> as<00:02:56.100> far<00:02:56.160> as<00:02:56.760> making<00:02:57.720> it<00:02:57.870> a

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
above and beyond as far as making it a

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:03.340 
above and beyond as far as making it a
fun<00:02:58.920> app<00:02:59.220> to<00:02:59.910> use<00:03:00.120> it<00:03:00.570> even<00:03:00.690> has<00:03:00.960> a<00:03:00.990> storyline

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
fun app to use it even has a storyline

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:07.100 
fun app to use it even has a storyline
so<00:03:04.350> when<00:03:05.160> you<00:03:05.250> touch<00:03:05.490> adventure<00:03:06.300> mode<00:03:06.480> you<00:03:06.960> can

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
so when you touch adventure mode you can

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:08.840 
so when you touch adventure mode you can
choose<00:03:07.350> to<00:03:07.680> continue<00:03:08.190> your<00:03:08.520> current

you<00:04:07.500> can<00:04:07.680> see<00:04:07.920> count<00:04:08.850> the<00:04:09.000> number<00:04:09.239> of<00:04:09.270> objects

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
you can see count the number of objects

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.830 
you can see count the number of objects
on<00:04:10.019> the<00:04:10.110> screen<00:04:10.230> and<00:04:11.090> like<00:04:12.090> I<00:04:12.239> said<00:04:12.450> the<00:04:12.660> nice

on the screen and like I said the nice
thing<00:04:13.320> about<00:04:13.350> this<00:04:13.739> is<00:04:14.040> that<00:04:14.630> different

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:15.630 
thing about this is that different

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:18.140 
thing about this is that different
activities<00:04:16.140> change<00:04:16.590> and<00:04:16.919> it's<00:04:17.760> not<00:04:17.850> all<00:04:18.120> the

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
activities change and it's not all the

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.590 
activities change and it's not all the
same<00:04:18.480> so<00:04:18.810> kids<00:04:19.049> won't<00:04:19.230> get<00:04:19.470> bored<00:04:19.830> very<00:04:19.950> easily

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:20.600 
same so kids won't get bored very easily

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:26.210 
same so kids won't get bored very easily
so<00:04:21.600> go<00:04:21.810> ahead<00:04:21.900> and<00:04:22.020> go<00:04:22.200> back<00:04:22.350> to<00:04:22.530> the<00:04:22.620> menu

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:31.390 
mention is touch math addition one does

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:34.230 
mention is touch math addition one does
