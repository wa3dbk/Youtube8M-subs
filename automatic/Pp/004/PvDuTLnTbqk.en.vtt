00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:16.020
 hello girls hello everyone how can you 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.000
 note I hurt my finger 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.610
 to the nail therefore precisely this 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.900
 beautiful token though in this video 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:23.550
 very fast I wanted to show 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.950
 some creations that done up 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.329
 order in which of top pendants 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:34.160
 im precisely i made some 

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:36.899
 playing cards and non poker cards 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.300
 practically texas hold'em poker yes 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:42.260
 plays with two cards in hand and then duty 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:45.300
 in short, pair through the various 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.440
 two pair poker scale combinations 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.149
 etc 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.410
 the board that is on the ground of five cards 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.420
 for those who tell you this why 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.949
 practically every player or almost the 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.899
 Most players are over 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.690
 affectionate have their own hand 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:00.960
 favorite from which I am often a lot 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.489
 tied and therefore had this idea 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.559
 practically giving my friends as gifts 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.450
 however the people they wanted 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.260
 cards that represented their hand 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.180
 favorite 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.010
 I as I find myself only some 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.930
 because the others have already gone 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:16.020
 way I have not had time to make the 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:19.080
 see however I show you type 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:22.080
 these are practically put up here 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.840
 a base of fimo you see that this is the 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:29.340
 width of the base end of then 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:31.770
 subdued a print that I then polished 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:35.300
 in this case both on one side and 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:38.760
 on the other you can see that they are shiny 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:41.190
 I used a university resin that 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:42.870
 he died very transparent and remains 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.240
 above all white in fact I tell you 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:47.820
 this because another using it I have 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.910
 used like this here is almost are 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:53.460
 the two axes or used on this side 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:55.380
 the bee resin instead from 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.050
 this one the resin of the caterpillars but 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.940
 as you can see that the comparison between 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:01.260
 one and the other the protein but after a while 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.750
 of time turns yellow 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:06.570
 in the act of show from the short e 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:09.720
 instead it remains beautiful white and 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:12.810
 so the effect I like the most is 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:15.150
 certainly it costs a lot however 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.920
 the effect is that the cards in this 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.660
 case I am a little bit more double but not 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.030
 you realize then admitted the 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.480
 hook here to make some or 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:26.640
 a key ring or a pendant for 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.740
 for this necklace I did 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:32.400
 several necklaces then I made the money there 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:36.990
 for the mobile I show you mine 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:38.790
 of the mobile that is this as you see 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:41.340
 here I also made her one of the first 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:44.340
 salted the resin of the pro team a 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.260
 and they are all yellowish days of the 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:49.230
 exhibits here you see this is very much 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:53.550
 more beautiful in the back part but I don't have 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:54.930
 put and the other cards so these are 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.600
 on one side you see on the other 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:00.090
 always the same cards here instead I wanted 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:02.010
 make a kind of texture actually with 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.110
 other cards or photos the sort of care with 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.420
 the fimo used in this one only 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:09.060
 a glaze but in short I did not put to 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:12.330
 cell phone to see also what kind of 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:15.930
 effect I will have if it lasts if it does not last 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:17.280
 like this this kind of experiment 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.920
 in short, these are an experiment and 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.110
 got for me on others i 'm 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:25.110
 realizing everyone in this way then I have 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:28.620
 also made a gift 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:30.570
 pretty much for my friend so 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.300
 I believe you will see this video later 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:34.860
 who had given her this, then you will see 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:39.330
 his gift practically I made 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:41.459
 and he by a method of play and that is 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:43.560
 usually play when in the hands of an ace 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:45.390
 followed by any other card then 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.269
 he when he sees the two cards 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.980
 our he type being played is played 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:51.750
 everything is played for the home 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.400
 so what did you decide to do? 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.709
 He said to his hand which will be preferred 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.420
 which will be maybe in a favorite hand 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:59.010
 but now I do this but I put them 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.989
 a solo of this system in this 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.670
 case schulte flowers said then I put them 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:03.989
 the banana banana would be a card 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:05.060
 in short, it has no meaning 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:06.920
 it is not 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:10.610
 a very high card but those that 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:15.380
 the cards are defined by the 2 3 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:16.940
 4 until 7 left him banana should 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:18.650
 human being 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.840
 the sum is not lucky you his hand 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:23.330
 in short, the one that is played very often 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:27.230
 in fact when he sees ours we play 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:28.880
 we all go, so I have them 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:30.889
 modified obviously not modified on 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:33.050
 computer so I made this stuff 

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:34.730
 dwarf who is the very pretty india face 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:38.570
 added this lace practically 

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:40.729
 for us this does not accept that yes 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:43.639
 he practically puts his neck and I did it 

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:48.440
 yellow as right at the base is fine 

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:50.270
 said this very nice thing nothing 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:54.830
 these are my graces in china sails 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:56.560
 done review and great idea for Christmas 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:59.360
 good idea 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:00.919
 nothing I send you a big kiss there 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:03.460
