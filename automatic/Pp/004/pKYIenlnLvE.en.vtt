00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:06.270
 hello i have a good day salute here 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.010
 is lg's stand at ifa 2010's 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.800
 Thursday we are still relatively fresh 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.809
 and here you have the youtube right now 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.099
 we did not even find that 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.690
 we have not been to the 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.320
 event in new york with me 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.109
 invited 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.490
 and now we have each one 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.140
 Possibility us the device at least once 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.789
 to look like I said I still have it 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.990
 even not seen the first 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.510
 which I just noticed but 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:31.109
 everything has been lifted this is this 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:34.020
 but relatively clear to see grid 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.520
 on the display maybe controls now 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.090
 nobody because if you can do that thing 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.579
 on the 8th 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.520
 then you can see how fantastic the picture 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.829
 so here is this full hd ips display 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.620
 that is really real mustache 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.090
 say this incredibly thin edge so 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.829
 really nice phone 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.239
 I have to say my slow is coming 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.460
 really slow at the point that 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.000
 i kind of like this poly camera crew 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.090
 Fed up 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.680
 I have a bit over because of you 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.000
 Yes, the disadvantage is there 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.020
 just always one has always hard 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.359
 stains so it's just always 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.369
 smells no matter how then sends that 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.350
 design is completely from the surface 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.119
 no matter what I like now is that 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.490
 the power button here on the back 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:13.080
 device attached that pictures of seen 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.659
 I thought that was the only way to get there 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.680
 Maybe all the time or so 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:18.630
 is not actually the case 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.220
 because that's at such a height when you are 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.680
 So it holds such a hand that one 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.040
 actually 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:26.140
 I do not even get there 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.090
 my the specs here 13 megapixel camera 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.540
 can we see what the good piece 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.550
 can 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:33.070
 jens's all I may just before 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:35.080
 still a function shown if you can 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:38.350
 device is not a caress or a 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.310
 pressure on the power button to live 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.860
 then you can just wake up 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.220
 knock on it so to speak, then it works 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:43.900
 Not 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:47.220
 So that should be the same way, yes 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:49.600
 that's a bit like 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.750
 firmly one had to beat out of it 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:55.060
 but yes klapptten bell town stroking 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.970
 Again, there are nice animations like 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.410
 it's from lg of the last ones 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.600
 equipment also knows every now and then 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:05.500
 what has something really great must have something 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:10.540
 a dandelion the camera wanted us 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:12.070
 short, do not look at everything like that 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:13.660
 a little bit if you move a lot 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:15.550
 Normally there are mistakes again 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.400
 The camera is also rather quiet and therefore 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.750
 that in any case absolutely reasonable 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.100
 I want the results year 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.810
 Of course like to look at the computer 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:25.299
 and so is the smartphone camera 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:28.800
 but everything looks very chic first of 

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:33.090
 2 26 ghz quad core processor 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:34.740
 the snapdragon 800 and I have to say so 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.020
 i like the knowledge of design 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:40.890
 In any case I am quite good 52 inches me 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:43.620
 I 'm still not user 55 inches 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.900
 and the difference is not so 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:49.320
 big and 52 goes with me with the 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:51.330
 polymer I have 65 now 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:55.050
 inch ssds more 1 comment up to small 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:56.990
 in comparison to that the htc is when 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:58.830
 a bit narrower has a bit 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:00.930
 perhaps is even a bit 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:03.540
 better if you have to say, I think the 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.860
 Aluminum it feels easy 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.990
 still a little better but 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:10.080
 I really have to say this one 

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:12.300
 whole construction here I like it 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.980
 really really good that you have 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.550
 get the nest laid when we are 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.700
 with it a bit more 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:19.380
 because so here on the 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.820
 ifa on the stand you have of course 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.170
 not so many options now 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.940
 to go a little deeper into the matter 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:26.760
 first impression in any case completely 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:29.010
 great thing and especially for the 394th 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.050
 euro I think that's really a 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.910
 fight announcement especially for the vpr vip 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:33.570
 cards soon a cheaper price 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:34.860
 count 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:36.480
 we're still going a bit now 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.590
 The fair you can see a few more 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.680
 other things because there is a lot here 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:42.040
 much to discover 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:43.659
 and say goodbye until goodbye 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.900
 until next time that neither and 

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:45.900
 bye
