words write down the word pun there when

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:17.500 
words write down the word pun there when
you<00:04:15.350> use<00:04:15.530> one<00:04:15.920> word<00:04:16.190> and<00:04:16.580> you<00:04:16.880> take<00:04:17.390> the

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:17.510 
you use one word and you take the

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:19.930 
you use one word and you take the
meaning<00:04:17.750> from<00:04:17.989> another<00:04:18.380> word<00:04:18.680> then<00:04:19.340> you're

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:19.940 
meaning from another word then you're

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:21.340 
meaning from another word then you're
making<00:04:20.120> a<00:04:20.299> play<00:04:20.510> on<00:04:20.570> words<00:04:20.750> it's<00:04:20.960> a<00:04:21.049> pun<00:04:21.229> and

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:21.350 
making a play on words it's a pun and

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:22.420 
making a play on words it's a pun and
you<00:04:21.440> really<00:04:21.620> have<00:04:21.770> to<00:04:21.799> read<00:04:22.100> between<00:04:22.190> the

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:22.430 
you really have to read between the

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:26.709 
you really have to read between the
lines

00:04:26.709 --> 00:04:26.719 

00:04:26.719 --> 00:04:29.270 

now<00:04:27.719> I<00:04:27.749> want<00:04:27.930> to<00:04:27.960> see<00:04:28.139> the<00:04:28.289> steam<00:04:28.560> rushing<00:04:29.099> out

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
now I want to see the steam rushing out

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.360 
now I want to see the steam rushing out
of<00:04:29.310> there<00:04:30.050> and<00:04:31.050> I<00:04:31.680> think<00:04:31.949> we're<00:04:32.129> at<00:04:32.189> a<00:04:32.219> good

of there and I think we're at a good

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:38.529 
of there and I think we're at a good
point<00:04:32.580> here<00:04:32.729> we<00:04:32.909> go<00:04:33.060> one<00:04:33.389> two<00:04:33.419> three<00:04:34.020> and<00:04:34.259> in

00:04:38.529 --> 00:04:38.539 

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:43.300 

how<00:04:39.539> about<00:04:39.779> that<00:04:40.020> now<00:04:40.979> why<00:04:41.460> did<00:04:41.789> the<00:04:41.909> can

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:43.310 
how about that now why did the can

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:50.959 
how about that now why did the can
violently<00:04:44.310> implode<00:04:46.129> Jessica<00:04:49.490> since<00:04:50.490> I<00:04:50.639> had<00:04:50.819> no

00:04:50.959 --> 00:04:50.969 
violently implode Jessica since I had no

00:04:50.969 --> 00:04:52.580 
violently implode Jessica since I had no
air<00:04:51.150> pressure<00:04:51.449> inside<00:04:51.689> yeah<00:04:52.199> there<00:04:52.349> was<00:04:52.469> no

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 
air pressure inside yeah there was no

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.399 
air pressure inside yeah there was no
air<00:04:52.770> pressure<00:04:52.979> inside<00:04:53.580> so<00:04:54.300> Brad<00:04:54.749> say<00:04:54.990> what

00:04:55.399 --> 00:04:55.409 
air pressure inside so Brad say what

00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:58.420 
air pressure inside so Brad say what
would<00:04:55.500> you<00:04:55.620> say<00:04:55.830> about<00:04:55.949> air<00:04:56.219> pressure<00:04:57.229> it's

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:58.430 
would you say about air pressure it's

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:03.490 
would you say about air pressure it's
powerful<00:05:00.830> 14.7<00:05:01.830> pounds<00:05:02.129> per<00:05:02.969> square<00:05:03.000> inch

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:03.500

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.960 
pushing in on this can form would this

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.709 
pushing in on this can form would this
be<00:05:07.169> problem<00:05:07.590> 180<00:05:08.129> degrees<00:05:08.430> plus<00:05:08.460> the<00:05:08.789> same<00:05:09.029> yes

00:05:09.709 --> 00:05:09.719 
be problem 180 degrees plus the same yes

00:05:09.719 --> 00:05:10.939 
be problem 180 degrees plus the same yes
that<00:05:09.930> would<00:05:10.020> be<00:05:10.080> to<00:05:10.169> convert<00:05:10.469> it<00:05:10.560> to<00:05:10.590> the<00:05:10.740> same

00:05:10.939 --> 00:05:10.949 
that would be to convert it to the same

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:13.309 
that would be to convert it to the same
