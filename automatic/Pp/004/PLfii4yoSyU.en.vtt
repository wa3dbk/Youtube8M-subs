00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.770
 it's me it's true why I took 

00:00:22.239 --> 00:00:25.300
 a voice like that for my intro and well 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:27.160
 listen to it sounds weird but 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.779
 I do not have a fucking idea 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.059
 this is how it came like 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:32.469
 come as I could have said or with a 

00:00:31.059 --> 00:00:34.300
 voice of morons or complain door 

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:35.649
 now the point is not there 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.820
 ladies and gentlemen today we are 

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:38.469
 there for a participant and we are not 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.640
 there to procrastinate on this or that subject 

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:42.579
 which has nothing to do with 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:45.100
 gifts though go out a critic 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:47.560

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:50.500
 weird for grabbing at I do not know 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:51.910
 me parasites or or even 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.829
 what are the names of the dancing zombies 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.880
 no zombies meiway the flight licked 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:56.440
 more like they're called monsters 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.120
 are halo 4 there when in mode 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.860
 zombie they make weird cries too 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.890
 when he kills someone or when he 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:05.259
 should be you have noticed 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.909

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:08.170
 belongs one will go on the party 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:10.149
 comment if this is what interests you 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.110
 on one side if you clicked on the 

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:13.360
 video it may be that's what 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.799
 interested you indeed if you had 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.880
 wanted to have some sort of open debate 

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:20.799
 on the cry and sound design of games 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.840
 it's more like the samian calls 

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:24.249
 zombies or monsters in in 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.709
 parties by the parasites 

00:01:24.249 --> 00:01:27.579

00:01:26.709 --> 00:01:28.389
 is called I outright see their 

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:30.620
 Gules agreed when sowing 

00:01:28.389 --> 00:01:33.990
 completely foul but I 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:35.340
 ok ok ok so we go right now and 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.690
 so before starting the game I 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.680
 specifies that it is therefore a part of 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:44.580

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.820
 where are we going to boye now we are 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.259
 as modesty I have arsonists but 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.840
 in those loaves without saying these directories 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:09.390
 that's called cold I'm so 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.800
 Promethean weapons me is where do you see 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.750

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.430
 plan nice essential a double fra 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.320
 big eyes as an excuse me I was listening to them 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.790
 blades make a trip a trip to very low 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:24.090
 price 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:25.410
 what excuse me if you understood 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.250
 that I did not understand but I do not 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.110
 can you explain what happened 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.250
 spent for me he has the means 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.280
 obviously the guy was not the same 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:34.260
 notice here's oulala the task at ffs ma 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.489
 share as long as you're there 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.200
 temporize as we say in the jargon 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:38.970
 temporize a little bit we turn around 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.739
 and there we sell them chain go on there 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.209
 returns and my returns 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:43.890
 here we do not recharge because everything 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:45.690
 happens except that he knows how to finish there 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.920
 we can reload that one you make yourself 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:50.760
 do you totally make yourself you can 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.840
 the more I do not know about you but me 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.070
 it's a sensation that makes so much 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.900
 sore on my anus when I'm not doing 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:57.540
 mounted in matchmaking by a mecha fida 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.610
 evening aims operated that I say pretty much 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.500
 well and that guy just sell it to 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.600
 wood reconciliation and dementia it's 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.830
 very frustrating 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:07.940
 I love the sound effects of this weapon 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.940
 looks like a toy for baby 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:15.359
 it looks like trashy catwalk at uja and 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:18.480
 spits thumbs six months in fact that's 

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:19.920
 hardcore like brigands but hey that's 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.120
 effective in the end we know it's a 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.590
 weapon that even again like 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.409
 all infos for meteosuisse very 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.569
 little but not bad it's a trick 

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:29.549
 like to hear that we have succeeded 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:31.379
 like you take you think you 're a god 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:35.659
 only a few seconds but more 

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:37.650
 now to the pretty pretty bone in the chain 

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:39.389
 damage 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.099
 a double train I admit that a double 

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:42.540
 sombrero would have gone cream or even 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:47.069
 it would have happened alone as he 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:48.120
 works because it does not matter 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:49.260
 balls too when the guys are killing each other 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.150
 between them and leave that same step you 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.159
 pick one of the two frei is not very 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.480
 nice where there are people on the back or 

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:56.220
 leila of the world on the dow have joined 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.599
 they kill each other his part against and 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.680
 account actually register a regicide 

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:01.439
 as in all modes to each for 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.430
 on one side of times you're not at all 

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:03.989
 happy when the guys get together 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.669
 between them what are you saying a big month 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:06.629
 I have people for me and then as we 

00:04:05.669 --> 00:04:07.530
 just saw him sometimes you're fine 

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:08.790
 glad they are interfering with each other 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.980
 because suddenly the 10,000 connacht 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:20.220
 drinking on the face and lower arm of 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:20.940
 match a good well yes it's not a death 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.740
 useless 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.449
 what to see in halo do not need 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:27.360
 to see the ffo ratio is especially to see the 

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:32.070
 dead useful or not so in your life you have 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:33.840
 had a life worth it you can die you 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:35.190
 can die easily kouadio my quota 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:37.650
 dead to rats and finances in the hold 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:38.880
 opinion will have been the knee understand to the 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:41.880
 houplinois chain again 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:43.590
 maybe a survey chosen franÃ§ois 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:48.660
 purchase damage was not played out big 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:50.040
 thing in my opinion but that's very very 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:51.300
 hardcore too i think i think the 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:53.250
 man is well done but it's the guy 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:54.810
 had begun to take his sprint and 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:56.280
 he was taken by the moors his 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:56.490
 sprinter of the coup could not stop at 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.170
 time 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:59.940
 he tried to put his shield out of 

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:04.410
 to say I protect myself but it works like 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:05.730
 that I do not know if you saw the 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:07.620
 color has passed two fingers of his 

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:10.260
 tef still I prefer to tell you that 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:11.550
 it did not go far to the h &amp; m chain 

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:15.600
 end of the chain 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:16.700
 ah ah no no I carried the bad luck and 

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.510
 well no 

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:20.850
 but hey there is still a pretty 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:25.980
 sequence that we make her lie a guy 

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:27.660
 in the back to the goal sedunois I'm in 

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:29.900
 his back he had not picked dawit had 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:29.900
 calculated 

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:39.440
 it's a performance are nice 

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:42.510
 summative me so merdy are sommier or 

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:49.050
 sleep but it's an execution he 

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:50.550
 doing that hurts though with the 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:52.290
 patati science review on two nights the 

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:56.010

 a little bit like that everything is like 

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:08.850
 said but that fits I believe it I 

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:11.340
 think it's not too bad for the situation 

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:15.030
 that's all that it's packed 

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:16.950

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:48.919
 imagine that if I leave you and 

00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:48.919
 without doing one it would not be me
