00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
this wasn't the easiest bit of land to

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.010 
this wasn't the easiest bit of land to
build<00:01:32.640> a<00:01:32.820> golf<00:01:32.969> course<00:01:33.240> on<00:01:33.509> while<00:01:33.990> all

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
build a golf course on while all

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.260 
build a golf course on while all
architects<00:01:34.770> say<00:01:35.009> that<00:01:35.250> and<00:01:35.729> I<00:01:35.820> really<00:01:36.090> think

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
architects say that and I really think

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.380 
architects say that and I really think
we've<00:01:36.390> created<00:01:36.689> 18<00:01:37.409> very<00:01:38.070> nice<00:01:38.429> holes<00:01:38.759> bit<00:01:39.270> of

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
we've created 18 very nice holes bit of

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.539 
we've created 18 very nice holes bit of
a<00:01:39.450> slow<00:01:39.750> start<00:01:39.780> but<00:01:40.350> then<00:01:40.500> away<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.310> course

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
a slow start but then away the course

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.059 
a slow start but then away the course
runs<00:01:41.759> in<00:01:42.030> front<00:01:42.270> of<00:01:42.390> you<00:01:42.539> not<00:01:43.049> very<00:01:43.289> long<00:01:43.560> but

00:01:44.059 --> 00:01:44.069 
runs in front of you not very long but

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:46.429 
runs in front of you not very long but
narrow<00:01:44.369> bit<00:01:45.119> of<00:01:45.240> water<00:01:45.479> about<00:01:45.840> few<00:01:46.140> ponds

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
narrow bit of water about few ponds

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.469 
narrow bit of water about few ponds
which<00:01:47.130> make<00:01:47.340> it<00:01:47.369> all<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.670> more<00:01:47.789> difficult<00:01:47.939> I

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
which make it all the more difficult I

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.270 
which make it all the more difficult I
think<00:01:48.630> we've<00:01:48.929> got<00:01:49.140> three<00:01:49.380> or<00:01:49.500> four<00:01:49.709> classic

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
think we've got three or four classic

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.649 
think we've got three or four classic
holes<00:01:50.490> here<00:01:50.729> that<00:01:50.759> would<00:01:51.000> stand<00:01:51.209> out<00:01:51.420> pretty

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
holes here that would stand out pretty

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.499 
holes here that would stand out pretty
well<00:01:51.840> on<00:01:52.049> any<00:01:52.560> inland<00:01:53.159> course<00:01:53.490> in<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.329> world

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
well on any inland course in the world

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.100 
well on any inland course in the world
particularly<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:55.530> third<00:01:55.799> but<00:01:56.610> this<00:01:57.390> is<00:01:57.659> my

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
particularly the third but this is my
