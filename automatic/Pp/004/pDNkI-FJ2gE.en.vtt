00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.149 
that's right so easy
the<00:02:00.630> foundation<00:02:01.229> of<00:02:01.320> footwork<00:02:01.650> is<00:02:01.799> this<00:02:01.950> stuff

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
the foundation of footwork is this stuff

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.190 
the foundation of footwork is this stuff
that<00:02:02.340> you<00:02:02.460> generally<00:02:02.759> use<00:02:02.880> in<00:02:03.270> mobile<00:02:03.479> that's

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
that you generally use in mobile that's

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.499 
that you generally use in mobile that's
right<00:02:04.439> so<00:02:04.860> one<00:02:05.189> of<00:02:05.220> the<00:02:05.580> basic<00:02:05.790> training<00:02:06.210> on

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
right so one of the basic training on

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:07.940 
right so one of the basic training on
the<00:02:06.630> foundation<00:02:07.140> turn<00:02:07.290> the<00:02:07.380> wing<00:02:07.530> tool<00:02:07.740> we

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
the foundation turn the wing tool we

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.490 
the foundation turn the wing tool we
learn<00:02:08.160> about<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:08.849> movement<00:02:09.239> like<00:02:09.500> stepping

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
learn about the movement like stepping

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.640 
learn about the movement like stepping
forward<00:02:11.280> freely<00:02:12.060> this<00:02:12.690> is<00:02:12.810> basically<00:02:13.290> to<00:02:13.470> move

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
forward freely this is basically to move

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.530 
forward freely this is basically to move
all<00:02:13.800> the<00:02:13.860> time<00:02:14.069> and<00:02:14.580> every<00:02:14.790> time<00:02:14.819> to<00:02:15.120> move<00:02:15.300> your

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
all the time and every time to move your

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.780 
all the time and every time to move your
ground<00:02:15.870> well<00:02:16.140> yeah<00:02:16.770> because<00:02:17.160> if<00:02:17.400> I<00:02:17.489> do<00:02:17.550> like

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
ground well yeah because if I do like

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.010 
ground well yeah because if I do like
that<00:02:17.940> all<00:02:18.090> the<00:02:18.150> time<00:02:18.180> and<00:02:18.600> he's<00:02:18.690> gonna<00:02:18.840> take<00:02:18.959> me

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
that all the time and he's gonna take me

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.520 
that all the time and he's gonna take me
down

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
down

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.979 
down
was<00:02:20.130> it<00:02:20.280> a<00:02:20.430> simple<00:02:21.120> problem<00:02:21.270> right<00:02:21.569> way<00:02:21.720> so

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
was it a simple problem right way so

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:29.809 
was it a simple problem right way so
everyone<00:02:22.890> knows<00:02:27.470> me<00:02:28.470> because<00:02:28.980> I'm<00:02:29.250> brown<00:02:29.610> the

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 
everyone knows me because I'm brown the

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:32.150 
everyone knows me because I'm brown the
flow<00:02:30.090> you<00:02:30.870> don't<00:02:31.050> move<00:02:31.230> and<00:02:31.530> down<00:02:31.709> the<00:02:31.860> ground

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
flow you don't move and down the ground

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:39.759 
flow you don't move and down the ground
but<00:02:32.340> it<00:02:32.489> happened<00:02:33.030> too<00:02:33.180> high<00:02:33.420> the<00:02:33.959> foundation

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:39.769 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:54.289 

that's<00:02:40.769> why<00:02:40.950> you<00:02:41.010> need<00:02:41.280> to<00:02:41.310> know<00:02:41.489> yourself<00:02:53.299> now

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:54.299 
that's why you need to know yourself now

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:56.240 
that's why you need to know yourself now
is<00:02:54.480> it<00:02:54.660> on<00:02:54.810> this<00:02:55.049> basic<00:02:55.470> movement<00:02:55.799> question
