however<00:01:45.360> as<00:01:45.960> I<00:01:46.079> found<00:01:46.320> out<00:01:47.390> by<00:01:48.390> mistake<00:01:49.880> can

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
however as I found out by mistake can

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.779 
however as I found out by mistake can
drop<00:01:51.240> troops<00:01:51.630> on<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:52.170> outside<00:01:52.920> you<00:01:53.549> can't

00:01:53.779 --> 00:01:53.789 
drop troops on the outside you can't

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:56.090

drop<00:01:53.939> them<00:01:54.090> at<00:01:54.179> the<00:01:54.210> trees<00:01:54.569> here<00:01:54.810> you<00:01:55.740> can<00:01:55.920> drop

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
drop them at the trees here you can drop

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.789 
drop them at the trees here you can drop
them<00:01:56.280> at<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.520> outside<00:01:56.939> edge<00:01:57.329> so<00:01:58.289> just<00:01:58.560> enough

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
them at the outside edge so just enough

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.709 
them at the outside edge so just enough
or<00:01:59.069> single<00:01:59.460> arch<00:01:59.670> is<00:01:59.909> enough<00:02:00.210> to<00:02:00.329> take<00:02:00.539> that

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
or single arch is enough to take that

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:10.090 
or single arch is enough to take that
entire<00:02:01.079> castle<00:02:02.069> down

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:10.100 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:15.050 

it's<00:02:11.100> also<00:02:12.710> going<00:02:13.710> to<00:02:13.800> drop<00:02:14.070> my<00:02:14.250> bonus<00:02:14.760> trips

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.150 

and<00:02:21.640> I<00:02:21.730> just<00:02:21.760> wanted<00:02:22.060> to<00:02:22.360> demonstrate<00:02:23.160> the

and I just wanted to demonstrate the

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.730 
and I just wanted to demonstrate the
sort<00:02:24.460> of<00:02:24.610> damage<00:02:25.240> these<00:02:25.540> towers<00:02:26.170> do<00:02:26.380> to<00:02:26.590> them

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:26.740 
sort of damage these towers do to them

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:33.210
