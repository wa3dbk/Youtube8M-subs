00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:10.019
 the guitar uses vibrating strings for 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:13.490
 generate tones on live strings 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:16.049
 they vibrate at a certain frequency or tone 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:18.480
 so if a song on the radio sees 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:30.990
 some nice vibrations could be 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:33.600
 thanks to them the strings are 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:39.390
 fundamental to determine the sound of 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.930
 a guitar to make a string of 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.000
 guitar 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.800
 it starts from a central steel wire 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.110
 which is examined under the zoom and of 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.789
 a stereo microscope which 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.590
 enlarges the rope a hundred times 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.590
 looking for defects in the hexagonal vault 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:01:01.440
 then the wire diameter is measured 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:03.210
 central with a digital micrometer a 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.400
 this point wraps the thread of 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.619
 made of stainless nickel coating 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:11.580
 around the pedals of a car 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:13.290
 will pull up to make it broken is a test 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.869
 which measures the wire capacity below 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.580
 voltage 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:19.380
 a computer measures the distance is the 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.720
 load to which the wire was subjected 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.780
 before breaking to determine 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.430
 how much tension can bear 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.950
 now the thread is subjected to a test 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.020
 of twist is wrapped around a 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.509
 hook in a machine to measure the 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.430
 stiffness which turns quickly 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.740
 wraps the thread that this does not break 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.650
 this test tests strength e 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.930
 the elasticity of speech 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:44.090
 these plastic containers are 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.850
 full of fine rope rings 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.260
 this machine selects the rings 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:51.040
 cristoni cables go up and down 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:53.540
 selecting one at a time 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:57.130
 this process causes them to pass 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.130
 only those of the right size 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.420
 the rings of rope files come out of the 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:07.229
 pistons and end up in a bucket 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:11.030
 below from here we will move on to 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.030
 machine for the soul of the rope 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:22.340
 a mechanism puts the rings on a 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:24.349
 pin while the rollers fall from a crow 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.689
 bring the central soul to a guide a 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:35.000
 vice that aligns with the ring of 

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:39.049
 end of stroke the pin rotates wrapping the 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:42.040
 Let's look around this ring 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:42.040
 slow motion action 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:54.860
 the central strings now tied to the rings 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:54.860
 cadoni he containers 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.849
 then a worker hooks a ring with the 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.159
 central wire to a winder that the 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:06.010
 external bronze wire to the central wire 

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:08.230
 a rolling cart guides the wire of 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:11.579
 bronze along the entire central wire not 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.579
 wrapping it text 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.910
 the electric winder rolls the wire 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.129
 central the cart makes sure that the 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:22.160
 outer thread is sheathed in the way 

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:22.160
 quite right 

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:29.870
 computer sensors in states control the 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:33.370
 speed at which the rope is wound 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.370
 as well as the pension 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:39.910
 the reel carries a quantity 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:43.650
 tension criticism while wrapping the 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:43.650
 bronze coating around the core 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:53.439
 no strings are collected like the 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:53.439
 144 straw strands for each band 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:00.640
 guitar strings can also 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:02.200
 the central core be made of nylon 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.330
 nylon is attached to a 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.750
 winder that plays it from a large one 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:06.750
 bovine 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:12.050
 then a bronze outer covering 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:16.100
 silver plated is wrapped 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:18.100
 around the hook turns and wraps around the 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:21.290
 outer thread around the nylon thread 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:23.120
 tying them together the powered trolley 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:25.370
 by an electric motor ensures that 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:28.130
 everything is in the right position 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:30.500
 a worker removes the ropes from hanging 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:32.900
 on a rack gravity causes 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:35.210
 the ropes slip into a ward where 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:37.760
 workers wrap them up and then put them up 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:39.500
 a conveyor belt along the line 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:41.200
 assembly another worker puts them 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:43.610
 in an envelope with a barrier 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:46.540
 plasticized that neutralizes the gas for 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:46.540
 avoid corrosion 

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:53.590
 and now these ropes are ready to give 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:53.590
 sound vibrations
