00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.700
 Mexicans is one of the most emblematic 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.949

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.660

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.300
 information I leave the link so 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:27.949
 alright let's start perfect in action 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.949
 Notice how standard started 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.080
 perfect let's start first with the 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.820
 rhythm and chords and hear more 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:59.070
 I'll show you this little boy 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.460
 ok arrangement let's use nothing more than 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.460
 chords 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.400
 17 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:12.200
 and this is for the intro part and 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.479
 the part of the verse we're going to start 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:17.810
 with the rhythm here I know that they do 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:19.970
 with a pick to give that sound more 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:23.840
 peculiar quiet 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:25.909
 check it is down we turn well 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.710
 this many and it must sound a lot 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:31.299
 all right 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:35.830
 ok 2 above 

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:35.830
 up and we repeat the circle 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:48.580
 ok it's going to be very slow for them to go 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.580
 grabbing rhythm 3 2 1 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:56.229
 or 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.750
 perfect this is the rhythm that leads 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:17.569
 let's do it with a change accordingly 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.569
 so they get used to 3 2 1 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.530
 you 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:49.590
 we start now like this with the stanza this 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:52.250
 it is equal pure circle of 17 and 321 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.250
 fear 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.810
 pretty so sensual 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:21.320
 you come back and 79 that afternoon I understood 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:21.320
 with you I had all the dogs 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:28.810
 the chorus of chords comes immediately 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:31.750
 extras let's use nothing but a cigar 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:34.270
 C sharp minor is already the only chord 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:36.280
 extra ok after accepting there is a 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:42.000
 small shot or Czech italo 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:42.000
 we started 321 these beings 

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:54.360
 the copper lords 

00:03:55.659 --> 00:03:58.659
 with you 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.950
 it would be everything 

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:10.470
 ok to check or in a small auction 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:13.290
 when yes yes 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:19.100
 ok the choir is not going to be very slow 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:19.100
 to check the change 321 these 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:25.390
 do not 

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:33.220
 and the worst is that it gives me 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:46.400
 with you would be the whole man 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:46.400
 and if the circle is repeated 

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:56.010
 and well the ground arrangement is very 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:58.080
 We start by placing fingers 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:00.420
 number one on the rope number one 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:02.910
 Fret number 7 and the new number three 

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:05.040

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:09.900
 rope 2 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:14.190
 it's a blow we go back 5 behind 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:18.890
 of 7 we go through again fret 4 after 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:18.890
 of 5 and we go back 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:27.070
 and we stay there 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:39.910
 the last auction nothing else is in the 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:44.490
