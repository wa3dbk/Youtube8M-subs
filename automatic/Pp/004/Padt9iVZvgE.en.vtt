this<00:01:03.150> is<00:01:03.210> what<00:01:03.570> we<00:01:03.750> call<00:01:03.989> digestion<00:01:05.299> when<00:01:06.299> you

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
this is what we call digestion when you

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.109 
this is what we call digestion when you
feel<00:01:06.689> bloated<00:01:07.020> have<00:01:07.710> cramps<00:01:08.280> or<00:01:08.430> our<00:01:08.640> abscess

feel bloated have cramps or our abscess

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.539 
feel bloated have cramps or our abscess
stomach<00:01:09.570> is<00:01:09.780> because<00:01:10.200> your<00:01:10.470> digestion<00:01:10.950> is<00:01:11.369> not

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
stomach is because your digestion is not

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.690 
stomach is because your digestion is not
functioning<00:01:12.119> efficiently<00:01:13.070> so<00:01:14.070> how<00:01:14.369> do<00:01:14.429> we

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
functioning efficiently so how do we

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.480 
functioning efficiently so how do we
maintain<00:01:14.909> a<00:01:15.179> healthy<00:01:15.719> digestive<00:01:16.289> system<00:01:16.740> with
