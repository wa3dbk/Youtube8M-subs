00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
the same and notice how it goes from 419

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.179 
the same and notice how it goes from 419
to<00:01:31.820> 356<00:01:32.820> all<00:01:33.600> of<00:01:33.810> that<00:01:33.960> stuff<00:01:34.259> happens<00:01:34.770> because

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
to 356 all of that stuff happens because

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.099 
to 356 all of that stuff happens because
we've<00:01:35.549> actually<00:01:35.789> keyed<00:01:36.240> out<00:01:36.270> that<00:01:36.630> black<00:01:36.899> with

00:01:37.099 --> 00:01:37.109 
we've actually keyed out that black with

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:39.919 
we've actually keyed out that black with
a<00:01:37.140> digital<00:01:37.920> composite<00:01:38.609> mode<00:01:38.789> so<00:01:39.270> just<00:01:39.750> real

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:45.889 
know what you're doing but but but what
do<00:01:44.579> they<00:01:44.700> need<00:01:44.850> to<00:01:45.060> do<00:01:45.210> that<00:01:45.359> again<00:01:45.659> well

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
do they need to do that again well

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.120 
do they need to do that again well
you're<00:01:46.049> gonna<00:01:46.170> need<00:01:46.409> some<00:01:46.770> kind<00:01:46.920> of<00:01:47.039> a

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
you're gonna need some kind of a

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.130 
you're gonna need some kind of a
hardware<00:01:47.460> like<00:01:47.759> a<00:01:47.820> switcher<00:01:48.420> so<00:01:48.719> that<00:01:48.869> you<00:01:48.990> can

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
hardware like a switcher so that you can

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.349 
hardware like a switcher so that you can
do<00:01:49.229> a<00:01:49.259> luma<00:01:49.679> key<00:01:49.859> so<00:01:50.369> that<00:01:50.520> you<00:01:50.609> can<00:01:50.789> kill<00:01:51.060> all

00:01:51.349 --> 00:01:51.359 
do a luma key so that you can kill all

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:53.510 
do a luma key so that you can kill all
of<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.630> black<00:01:51.869> you<00:01:52.289> keying<00:01:52.649> it<00:01:52.829> all<00:01:53.039> out<00:01:53.249> and

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
of the black you keying it all out and

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.580 
of the black you keying it all out and
leaving<00:01:53.850> that<00:01:53.999> white<00:01:54.299> text<00:01:54.749> on<00:01:54.840> there<00:01:55.140> like

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
leaving that white text on there like

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.099 
leaving that white text on there like
you<00:01:55.770> see<00:01:55.979> right<00:01:56.219> down<00:01:56.399> here<00:01:56.460> so<00:01:57.359> that<00:01:57.569> that<00:01:57.869> way

00:01:58.099 --> 00:01:58.109 
you see right down here so that that way

00:01:58.109 --> 00:02:00.200 
you see right down here so that that way
you<00:01:58.439> can<00:01:58.619> have<00:01:58.649> any<00:01:58.950> image<00:01:59.310> see<00:01:59.579> through<00:01:59.850> it

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
you can have any image see through it

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.420 
you can have any image see through it
if<00:02:00.390> you<00:02:00.600> have<00:02:00.810> editing<00:02:01.260> software<00:02:01.800> to<00:02:02.010> Final

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
if you have editing software to Final

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.000 
if you have editing software to Final
Cut<00:02:02.460> Pro<00:02:02.640> Adobe<00:02:03.570> Premiere<00:02:04.110> you<00:02:04.620> would<00:02:04.740> be<00:02:04.920> able

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.010 
Cut Pro Adobe Premiere you would be able

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:06.470 
Cut Pro Adobe Premiere you would be able
to<00:02:05.250> actually<00:02:05.580> take<00:02:05.760> that<00:02:05.790> in<00:02:06.060> there<00:02:06.210> and<00:02:06.360> do<00:02:06.450> a

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:06.480 
to actually take that in there and do a

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.180 
to actually take that in there and do a
composite<00:02:06.840> mode<00:02:07.200> like<00:02:07.410> I<00:02:07.590> did<00:02:07.800> you<00:02:07.950> can<00:02:08.070> get

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
composite mode like I did you can get

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.620 
composite mode like I did you can get
different<00:02:08.369> results<00:02:08.940> by<00:02:09.030> doing<00:02:09.330> different

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
different results by doing different

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:11.510 
different results by doing different
kinds<00:02:09.660> of<00:02:09.929> composites<00:02:10.560> but<00:02:11.100> I<00:02:11.130> did<00:02:11.340> a<00:02:11.400> very

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
kinds of composites but I did a very

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.580 
kinds of composites but I did a very
simple<00:02:11.910> key<00:02:12.240> and<00:02:12.510> all<00:02:12.630> I<00:02:12.660> do<00:02:12.870> now<00:02:13.080> is<00:02:13.260> I<00:02:13.380> take

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
simple key and all I do now is I take

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.699 
simple key and all I do now is I take
that<00:02:13.650> video<00:02:14.100> I<00:02:14.430> explored<00:02:15.210> it<00:02:15.300> out<00:02:15.480> and<00:02:15.840> you<00:02:16.560> can

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
that video I explored it out and you can

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:18.650 
that video I explored it out and you can
even<00:02:16.860> do<00:02:17.100> just<00:02:17.610> plain<00:02:17.850> text<00:02:18.240> if<00:02:18.330> you<00:02:18.420> want<00:02:18.600> to

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
even do just plain text if you want to

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.360 
even do just plain text if you want to
take<00:02:18.810> a<00:02:18.840> look<00:02:19.080> you<00:02:19.320> can<00:02:19.770> have<00:02:19.890> something<00:02:20.160> on

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
take a look you can have something on

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:21.980 
take a look you can have something on
there<00:02:20.610> that's<00:02:20.790> just<00:02:20.850> gonna<00:02:21.180> be<00:02:21.360> text<00:02:21.780> it's<00:02:21.930> not

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
there that's just gonna be text it's not

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.350 
there that's just gonna be text it's not
going<00:02:22.260> to<00:02:22.320> be<00:02:22.470> an<00:02:22.560> image<00:02:22.920> and<00:02:23.100> so<00:02:23.610> it<00:02:23.880> will<00:02:24.060> just

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
going to be an image and so it will just

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.630 
going to be an image and so it will just
be<00:02:24.510> showing<00:02:25.110> that<00:02:25.590> text<00:02:26.100> so<00:02:26.130> it<00:02:26.340> could<00:02:26.520> be

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
be showing that text so it could be

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.220 
be showing that text so it could be
announcements<00:02:27.090> for<00:02:27.420> your<00:02:27.540> church<00:02:27.810> and<00:02:28.050> could
