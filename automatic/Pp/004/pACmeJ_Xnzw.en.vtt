00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.790
 Mousse 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.790
 Hmm 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:31.800
 Ha ha Hahhahha' Her 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:47.579
 Yes here it is- 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:51.210
 I would like to talk about the subject of why I am tired 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:55.470
 Say why selfishness of become easier 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:57.340
 By all means it is also there because there is also a video 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:01.710
 Please see 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:02.940
 Here is the story of why it is used in reverse 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:09.420
 a ridge 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:11.570
 There is a thing called bending extension movement by movement with many drummers 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.980
 It is part of this elbow 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.980
 It is such an exercise 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.980
 Mainly this kind of temporary egg flexion and extension movement 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:28.050
 soho 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:30.620
 I would like to realize everyone's in today that Tteyuu easy tired of and say, 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:33.140
 Well then 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:36.010
 Also experiment 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.010
 I would like to do 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:44.890
 I often come out of my lessons 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:51.140
 a because the cymbal stand 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:56.479
 I have no idea who made the story Moranbon , etc. I thought of in my arms 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:58.350
 Everything is a little different , so I'm glad if you hear that story 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:03.250
 here 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:05.990
 8 Muscles used for flexing motion 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:08.890
 I think it is dinner bending operation 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.890
 It is such an operation 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:15.590
 This is the upper arm biceps muscle 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.590
 that 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:22.490
 I'm active but I'm biceps 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:28.770
 If you say that you are on the floor 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:31.900
 Because it is a health child that 98 sterilization is in this back along the upper arm 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:38.010
 It is here under much 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:42.980
 I have a stand not be ulna and Touko Zu' is here, but of the individual skull inside of 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.980
 I'm attached to the root inside 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:48.520
 Experiment 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:51.360
 First of all, please have it here 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:54.620
 This stand 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:57.540
 Please try it because there are 12 time differences everywhere 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:01.340
 Another will have here in the body 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:04.580
 So I will pull this up from now on 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:08.050
 Please make a black turn 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.050
 This is not heavy on the previous such 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:14.980
 Do you have the same behavior with you next time? 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:18.740
 Have here 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:22.160
 Many at this cloud point 

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:24.270
 Incense is not raised bar on from here 0 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:27.210
 It is very difficult 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:28.890
 It is Nitta with this 9 songs 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:31.040
 this 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:32.660
 Please try it 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.060
 It is heavy 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:36.750
 This is leisurely 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.750
 Easy 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:44.030
 I wanted you to notice in the tatami mats about the floor with rags 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:47.170
 I explained it now 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.170
 I'm with here 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:57.050
 Here from here Parliament is here 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:04:00.100
 So the place is like this to bend the elbow in the rag 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:00.100
 Uniform good luck 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.500
 Ne 

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:11.200
 We do it as it is natural but it is awesome 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:14.590
 The fact is that it is not easy for winter at half past this time 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.519
 I'm not sure I'm riding on my upper arms sometimes or is it a bit appropriate? 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:22.740
 Well, I is not know 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:25.690
 Also it is referred to as the market is a two-Doki was here a comfortable If you come with the here and here 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:29.849
 This is easy to imagine 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:32.139
 But it was not possible to get here 

00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:35.249
 More r reason 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:35.249
 I could not attach it here 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:42.370
 Well the reason is I will later explained was a little assistance in this experiment is about here 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:46.210
 Is 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:50.090
 Because it is an opposite child, a great power is full 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:54.260
 Naa mainly made the flexing movement 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:59.180
 My muscles are very tired when I say window 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:05:04.830
 8 I do is not that they do not take advantage of this bending motion because 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:06.249
 I use this absolutely, but it is an exercise that I relied on here 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:09.139
 Like this 

00:05:06.249 --> 00:05:13.830
 Or something like this 

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:16.810
 After all the behavior that I asked was 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:18.430
 It is easy to get tired 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:19.500
 Hey Well 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:22.320
 A while ago 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:23.960
 If Tsuitere is here where also muscle strength 

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:26.009
 This was easy 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:29.009
 Because it is not attached in Well 

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:30.710
 I understand I I was that I thought 

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:32.529
 Hmm 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:35.300
 that 

00:05:32.529 --> 00:05:38.470
 Where did you get here 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:42.750
 This length when I saw more 

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:47.190
 So when it really shrinks it will be this length 

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:49.360
 Arm Te 4 I also Some people when most of the technology in this length 

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:55.319
 Almost ok 

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:55.319
 But it is not muscle so contracted that overlaps full Do of 

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:01.700
 So 

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:04.700
 I had no choice but to come here from here 

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:09.800
 If you contract from here 

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:14.450
 But it will suffer a loss I say reverse v of reverse Te to Cocorico in force 

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:15.990
 That's right with power, but you'll post it over distance 

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:21.700
 I understand the meaning 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:22.569
 The distance is small and I think that the tip of this one seems full 

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:24.040
 Ne 

00:06:22.569 --> 00:06:30.210
 So 

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:30.210
 The muscles are very hard, and if you use this as the main 

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:34.449
 So 

00:06:32.289 --> 00:06:37.360
 Such behavior is 

00:06:34.449 --> 00:06:39.620
 Main is both 

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:43.240
 Get tired easily 

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:48.460
 So why not say how it works 

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:54.009
 Because there is a daily amount why it is easy for a ridge , if you can see a little more then 

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:58.050
 There a saying do not to say I will make what I'd move to something like 

00:06:54.009 --> 00:06:58.050
 I wish I could 

00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:05.000
 In the say so meaning today 

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:08.410
 I was experimenting with why I can use it 

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.410
 I think if you can uncon
