00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.669
 good all attached to a new video 

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:05.680
 good topic that is interesting enough I am 

00:00:03.669 --> 00:00:08.110
 possible launch of gta 5 in pc 

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:10.390
 playstation 4 and xbox one and basically 

00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:12.490
 by bonus it seems that the ugly of you 

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:14.020
 strauss zelnick well I want to clarify everything 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:15.730
 a little bit this has not basically said that 

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:17.800
 will launch gta where the 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:19.900
 consumers basically that if this is 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.390
 translates into what they are in what is in a 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.760
 tablet or are on a mobile there 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:26.500
 will launch gta really these 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.060
 statements are a bit confusing 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.320
 I really do add the sales of 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.640
 crises are four teams one almost 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.499
 reaches 10 million 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.960
 I think they have passed and I am not very 

00:00:32.499 --> 00:00:36.069
 sure then I will look at figures and data but 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.440
 I think that they are about to 

00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:40.179
 reach 10 million between the two 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.179
 I think there is a source of 

00:00:40.179 --> 00:00:44.920
 pretty pretty high players if 

00:00:43.179 --> 00:00:48.039
 we counted the players that may have 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:50.649
 I started since the number increases from 10 to 

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:52.059
 100 million or more let's go I'm putting 

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:53.859
 random numbers I do not know how many millions 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:56.469
 of computers have sold are data that 

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:58.959
 I do not drive but there are many millions of 

00:00:56.469 --> 00:01:00.850
 players in bc and I think this can be 

00:00:58.959 --> 00:01:02.829
 translate into what I started yes that is possible 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.600
 it is very possible that it will come out 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:06.220
 what will this say how good that gta 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.530
 launched from the consumers I think 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.630
 which is a good indication that as 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:13.030
 I say it can come out in pc and it's very likely 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.649
 that comes out in PC soon as a team 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.350
 of my company are four pos I can still 

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:19.810
 have my doubts projecting brno in 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.189
 business in that sense text the truth 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.110
 who want to look more for the business of 

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:25.299
 rockstar more for the players but I 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.610
 I think if people start asking with 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:28.869
 emphasis the game on pc that are four and 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.420
 team one 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:34.119
 at the end rockstar and text are going to end 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:36.130
 giving way was going to end up coming out I think 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:38.140
 that these statements indicate that 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.940
 that people who see that they have interest 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.130
 in that only games on that platform 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:44.890
 Well, they will end up taking it out, I think 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:47.679
 every time is closer to the announcement of 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:50.590
 possible launch of the team game 

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:52.390
 how ps4 ipc i the truth watching this 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.369
 statements that cost me a bit that 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.409
 the truth seems a bit strange to me that 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:57.729
 do not announce since they will take it out on 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:59.799
 some platforms is that they are going to 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:01.479
 out because I think this maybe you 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:02.979
 is hurting not to say that they are going to 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:04.990
 launch then start and start the 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:06.539
 people to already reserve the game and such and I 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.319
 I think that a little bit was coming in the 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:09.020
 enthusiasm that people have for the 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:11.000
 game 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.220
 just simply on the rockstar newsweek 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.220
 for asking how many people do you want 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:19.130
 do a kind of survey and good 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.960
 caught and then already to tell him by throwing 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.220
 not so good nothing more kids this 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.500
 are the statements of this man not 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.940
 I know if all this is clear to you but 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.150
 good so nothing we go in the next 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.150
 video
