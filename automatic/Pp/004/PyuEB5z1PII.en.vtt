00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
a zippy sandwich bag would look

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.830 
a zippy sandwich bag would look
perfectly<00:00:24.269> -<00:00:24.619> and<00:00:25.619> we're<00:00:25.890> just<00:00:26.010> going<00:00:26.279> to<00:00:26.310> slip

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:26.840 
perfectly - and we're just going to slip

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:33.530 
perfectly - and we're just going to slip
the<00:00:27.840> sponge<00:00:28.289> into<00:00:29.449> the<00:00:30.449> milk<00:00:30.689> bag<00:00:31.940> and<00:00:32.940> we're

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
the sponge into the milk bag and we're

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.260 
the sponge into the milk bag and we're
going<00:00:33.690> to<00:00:33.719> cut<00:00:34.020> it<00:00:34.340> straight<00:00:35.340> across

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
going to cut it straight across

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.479 
going to cut it straight across
go<00:00:37.079> like<00:00:37.440> that<00:00:39.079> maybe<00:00:40.079> about<00:00:40.260> an<00:00:40.530> inch<00:00:40.590> kind<00:00:41.399> of

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
go like that maybe about an inch kind of

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.450 
go like that maybe about an inch kind of
above<00:00:41.850> this<00:00:42.210> sponge<00:00:42.890> so<00:00:43.890> we'll<00:00:44.010> cut<00:00:44.219> it<00:00:44.250> like

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
above this sponge so we'll cut it like

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.389 
above this sponge so we'll cut it like
that<00:00:44.760> and<00:00:45.530> then<00:00:46.530> you<00:00:46.649> need<00:00:46.829> to<00:00:46.980> cut<00:00:47.219> out<00:00:47.370> a

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
that and then you need to cut out a

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.240 
that and then you need to cut out a
little<00:00:47.760> area<00:00:48.300> in<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.719> middle<00:00:49.050> do<00:00:50.010> like<00:00:50.219> a

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
little area in the middle do like a

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.880 
little area in the middle do like a
little<00:00:50.700> kind<00:00:51.000> of<00:00:51.149> a<00:00:53.059> little<00:00:54.059> new<00:00:54.570> shaped<00:00:55.020> kind

a<00:00:56.010> little<00:00:56.250> ditch<00:00:56.550> thing<00:00:56.850> it<00:00:56.940> doesn't<00:00:57.090> have<00:00:57.239> to

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
a little ditch thing it doesn't have to

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.139 
a little ditch thing it doesn't have to
be<00:00:57.539> perfect<00:00:58.050> because<00:00:59.039> we're<00:00:59.430> going<00:00:59.579> to<00:00:59.670> adjust

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
be perfect because we're going to adjust

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.060 
be perfect because we're going to adjust
it<00:01:00.420> with<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.750> duct<00:01:00.960> tape<00:01:01.230> so<00:01:01.500> we're<00:01:01.859> going<00:01:01.980> to

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
it with the duct tape so we're going to

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.780 
it with the duct tape so we're going to
cut<00:01:02.250> out<00:01:02.399> some<00:01:03.030> little<00:01:03.059> bits<00:01:03.769> like<00:01:04.769> that<00:01:05.129> so

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
cut out some little bits like that so

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:06.950 
cut out some little bits like that so
we've<00:01:05.880> got<00:01:06.119> little<00:01:06.390> cutouts

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
we've got little cutouts

going to take our balloon and for this

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.950 
going to take our balloon and for this
one<00:01:43.590> I'm<00:01:43.829> using<00:01:44.040> a<00:01:44.250> bigger<00:01:44.579> balloon<00:01:44.939> but<00:01:45.780> if

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.770 
one I'm using a bigger balloon but if
you<00:01:46.170> use<00:01:46.500> a<00:01:46.790> smaller<00:01:47.790> balloon<00:01:48.090> you'll

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
you use a smaller balloon you'll

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.499 
you use a smaller balloon you'll
actually<00:01:48.990> get<00:01:49.320> a<00:01:49.350> different<00:01:49.590> sound<00:01:50.329> sort<00:01:51.329> of<00:01:51.390> a

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
actually get a different sound sort of a

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.080 
actually get a different sound sort of a
higher<00:01:51.750> pitched<00:01:52.170> sound<00:01:52.829> so<00:01:53.579> now<00:01:53.729> I'm<00:01:53.880> going<00:01:54.030> to

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
higher pitched sound so now I'm going to

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.810 
higher pitched sound so now I'm going to
take<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:54.450> balloon<00:01:54.720> and<00:01:55.170> you're<00:01:56.100> just<00:01:56.460> going

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
take the balloon and you're just going

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.550 
take the balloon and you're just going
to<00:01:56.939> cut<00:01:57.180> it<00:01:57.360> across<00:01:58.880> boat<00:01:59.880> here<00:02:00.600> cut<00:02:01.439> it

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
to cut it across boat here cut it

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.410 
to cut it across boat here cut it
straight<00:02:01.740> across<00:02:02.390> and<00:02:03.390> then<00:02:04.579> you<00:02:05.579> want<00:02:06.060> to<00:02:06.149> cut

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
straight across and then you want to cut

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.749 
straight across and then you want to cut
up<00:02:06.630> a<00:02:06.930> little<00:02:07.409> bit<00:02:07.619> on<00:02:07.770> an<00:02:07.920> angle<00:02:08.069> just<00:02:08.550> to

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
up a little bit on an angle just to

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.170 
up a little bit on an angle just to
where<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.330> narrow<00:02:10.229> part

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
where the narrow part

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.030 
where the narrow part
starts<00:02:12.040> so<00:02:13.040> we're<00:02:13.159> going<00:02:13.280> to<00:02:13.370> cut<00:02:13.579> it<00:02:13.760> just<00:02:13.939> up

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
starts so we're going to cut it just up

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:21.670 
starts so we're going to cut it just up
on<00:02:16.040> angle<00:02:16.939> like<00:02:17.720> that<00:02:19.360> okay<00:02:20.360> and<00:02:20.780> then<00:02:21.530> we're

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
on angle like that okay and then we're

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.339 
on angle like that okay and then we're
going<00:02:21.769> to<00:02:21.829> get<00:02:21.980> a<00:02:22.040> couple<00:02:22.489> pieces<00:02:22.939> of<00:02:23.480> duct

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:24.349 
going to get a couple pieces of duct

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:34.869 
going to get a couple pieces of duct
tape<00:02:25.269> again<00:02:32.530> this<00:02:33.530> parts<00:02:33.950> pretty<00:02:34.040> important

00:02:34.869 --> 00:02:34.879 
tape again this parts pretty important

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:38.199 
tape again this parts pretty important
because<00:02:35.120> you<00:02:35.569> need<00:02:35.980> the<00:02:36.980> air<00:02:37.220> to<00:02:37.579> be<00:02:37.730> able<00:02:37.760> to

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
because you need the air to be able to

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:40.690 
because you need the air to be able to
come<00:02:38.959> out<00:02:39.170> of<00:02:39.560> the<00:02:39.769> balloon<00:02:39.980> so<00:02:40.010> you<00:02:40.310> want<00:02:40.609> to

come out of the balloon so you want to

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:44.259 
come out of the balloon so you want to
kind<00:02:40.879> of<00:02:41.000> Center<00:02:41.540> this<00:02:41.840> over<00:02:42.849> the<00:02:43.849> space

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:44.269 
kind of Center this over the space

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:48.069 
kind of Center this over the space
between<00:02:44.989> the<00:02:45.319> plastic<00:02:45.590> and<00:02:46.099> just<00:02:46.810> kind<00:02:47.810> of<00:02:47.870> put

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:48.079 
between the plastic and just kind of put

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:53.170 
between the plastic and just kind of put
random<00:02:48.440> pieces<00:02:48.709> of<00:02:49.180> tape<00:02:50.180> at<00:02:50.900> the<00:02:51.530> edges<00:02:52.180> so

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
random pieces of tape at the edges so

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.679 
random pieces of tape at the edges so
it's<00:02:53.389> positioned<00:02:54.079> properly<00:02:55.000> and<00:02:56.000> another

00:02:56.679 --> 00:02:56.689 
it's positioned properly and another

00:02:56.689 --> 00:03:00.460 
it's positioned properly and another
couple<00:02:57.019> pieces<00:02:57.409> on<00:02:57.650> the<00:02:57.980> other<00:02:58.010> side<00:02:59.230> in<00:03:00.230> any

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
couple pieces on the other side in any

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:01.509 
couple pieces on the other side in any
case<00:03:00.709> we're<00:03:00.920> going<00:03:01.010> to<00:03:01.069> cover<00:03:01.280> the<00:03:01.489> whole

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:01.519 
case we're going to cover the whole

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:04.539 
case we're going to cover the whole
thing<00:03:01.849> with<00:03:02.150> duct<00:03:02.780> tape<00:03:03.079> but<00:03:03.409> for<00:03:03.680> now<00:03:03.829> when<00:03:04.519> I

00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:04.549 
thing with duct tape but for now when I

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:07.629 
thing with duct tape but for now when I
get<00:03:05.120> the<00:03:05.269> balloon<00:03:05.599> in<00:03:05.900> the<00:03:06.650> right<00:03:06.829> place<00:03:07.159> so

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:07.639 
get the balloon in the right place so

00:03:07.639 --> 00:03:09.849 
get the balloon in the right place so
we've<00:03:07.939> got<00:03:08.120> one<00:03:08.329> side<00:03:08.629> done<00:03:08.659> and<00:03:09.260> so<00:03:09.709> we're

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:09.859 
we've got one side done and so we're

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:14.140 
we've got one side done and so we're
going<00:03:10.010> to<00:03:10.069> go<00:03:10.280> here<00:03:10.760> to<00:03:11.629> the<00:03:11.659> other<00:03:12.049> side<00:03:13.150> and

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
going to go here to the other side and

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.819 
going to go here to the other side and
just<00:03:14.629> put<00:03:14.959> a<00:03:15.169> couple<00:03:15.650> of<00:03:15.919> pieces<00:03:16.190> of<00:03:16.810> tape<00:03:17.829> just

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:18.829 
just put a couple of pieces of tape just

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:23.199 
just put a couple of pieces of tape just
to<00:03:19.010> kind<00:03:19.310> of<00:03:19.720> cover<00:03:20.720> any<00:03:21.169> little<00:03:21.650> holes<00:03:22.340> and

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 
to kind of cover any little holes and

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:25.780 
to kind of cover any little holes and
then<00:03:24.049> now<00:03:24.410> we're<00:03:24.980> actually<00:03:25.160> going<00:03:25.489> to<00:03:25.549> cover

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
then now we're actually going to cover

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.920 
then now we're actually going to cover
the<00:03:26.090> whole<00:03:26.419> thing<00:03:26.780> with<00:03:27.489> the<00:03:28.489> duct<00:03:28.730> tape<00:03:28.970> so

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
the whole thing with the duct tape so

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.990 
the whole thing with the duct tape so
what<00:03:30.440> we're<00:03:30.590> going<00:03:30.799> to<00:03:30.889> do<00:03:31.190> is<00:03:31.909> take<00:03:32.299> this<00:03:32.980> and

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
what we're going to do is take this and

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000 
what we're going to do is take this and
I<00:03:35.000> found<00:03:35.180> the<00:03:35.359> easiest<00:03:35.750> way<00:03:36.019> to<00:03:36.049> do<00:03:36.409> it<00:03:36.590> is<00:03:36.829> just

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
I found the easiest way to do it is just

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.420 
I found the easiest way to do it is just
take<00:03:37.549> one<00:03:37.970> and<00:03:38.260> put<00:03:39.260> it<00:03:39.409> like<00:03:39.560> right<00:03:39.799> around

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
take one and put it like right around

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:55.689 
take one and put it like right around
one<00:03:41.389> side<00:03:43.419> right<00:03:44.419> around<00:03:45.099> like<00:03:46.099> that<00:03:54.549> and<00:03:55.549> on

00:03:55.689 --> 00:03:55.699 
one side right around like that and on

00:03:55.699 --> 00:04:03.180 
one side right around like that and on
the<00:03:55.909> other<00:03:56.090> side<00:03:59.799> so<00:04:00.799> it<00:04:00.919> goes<00:04:01.129> right<00:04:01.370> to<00:04:01.909> the

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190 
the other side so it goes right to the

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:05.890 
the other side so it goes right to the
edge<00:04:04.190> okay<00:04:04.579> it's<00:04:04.940> kind<00:04:05.120> of<00:04:05.180> like<00:04:05.329> a<00:04:05.359> perfect

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900 
edge okay it's kind of like a perfect

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.789 
edge okay it's kind of like a perfect
size<00:04:06.849> because<00:04:07.849> it<00:04:08.299> seems<00:04:08.599> like<00:04:08.840> if<00:04:09.290> you<00:04:09.500> do

00:04:09.789 --> 00:04:09.799 
size because it seems like if you do

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:13.899 
size because it seems like if you do
three<00:04:10.549> strips<00:04:11.120> it<00:04:12.109> covers<00:04:12.560> the<00:04:12.829> whole<00:04:12.909> sponge

00:04:13.899 --> 00:04:13.909 
three strips it covers the whole sponge

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:16.330 
three strips it covers the whole sponge
and<00:04:14.900> you<00:04:15.169> could<00:04:15.349> probably<00:04:15.530> use<00:04:15.829> any<00:04:16.070> size

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.340 
and you could probably use any size

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:18.009 
and you could probably use any size
sponge<00:04:17.150> I<00:04:17.570> wouldn't

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:18.019 
sponge I wouldn't

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:19.809 
sponge I wouldn't
much<00:04:18.229> smaller<00:04:18.739> than<00:04:19.039> this<00:04:19.190> or<00:04:19.489> it<00:04:19.579> wouldn't

00:04:19.809 --> 00:04:19.819 
much smaller than this or it wouldn't

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:22.629 
much smaller than this or it wouldn't
really<00:04:19.970> make<00:04:20.180> that<00:04:20.419> much<00:04:20.479> sound<00:04:21.079> and<00:04:21.639> then

00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:22.639 
really make that much sound and then

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:24.969 
really make that much sound and then
here<00:04:23.300> if<00:04:23.630> you<00:04:23.720> want<00:04:23.900> to<00:04:23.960> do<00:04:24.080> it<00:04:24.199> right<00:04:24.470> from<00:04:24.770> the

00:04:24.969 --> 00:04:24.979 
here if you want to do it right from the

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:31.600 
here if you want to do it right from the
edge<00:04:25.849> of<00:04:26.180> the<00:04:27.759> balloon<00:04:28.759> there<00:04:30.280> you<00:04:31.280> can<00:04:31.460> always

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:31.610 
edge of the balloon there you can always

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:33.520 
edge of the balloon there you can always
touch<00:04:31.940> it<00:04:32.120> up<00:04:32.240> after<00:04:32.660> if<00:04:32.750> you<00:04:32.870> find<00:04:33.169> that<00:04:33.349> the

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:33.530 
touch it up after if you find that the

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:36.580 
touch it up after if you find that the
air<00:04:33.710> leaks<00:04:34.009> out<00:04:34.310> you<00:04:35.270> can<00:04:35.419> always<00:04:35.569> add<00:04:35.900> this<00:04:36.349> is

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590 
air leaks out you can always add this is

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:39.999 
air leaks out you can always add this is
a<00:04:36.889> duct<00:04:37.490> tape<00:04:38.020> to<00:04:39.020> make<00:04:39.199> sure<00:04:39.470> that<00:04:39.650> you've<00:04:39.800> got

00:04:39.999 --> 00:04:40.009 
a duct tape to make sure that you've got

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:41.920 
a duct tape to make sure that you've got
all<00:04:40.130> the<00:04:40.280> air<00:04:40.430> holes<00:04:40.789> filled<00:04:41.240> up<00:04:41.449> so<00:04:41.690> then

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:41.930 
all the air holes filled up so then

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:46.930 
all the air holes filled up so then
we're<00:04:42.080> going<00:04:42.169> to<00:04:42.229> cut<00:04:42.470> a<00:04:42.500> little<00:04:44.020> here<00:04:45.940> so

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:46.940 
we're going to cut a little here so

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:49.980 
we're going to cut a little here so
we've<00:04:47.060> got<00:04:47.090> sort<00:04:47.569> of<00:04:47.630> our<00:04:47.750> basic<00:04:48.500> shape

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:49.990 
we've got sort of our basic shape

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:52.839 
we've got sort of our basic shape
they're<00:04:50.990> all<00:04:51.319> cover<00:04:51.680> and<00:04:52.190> now<00:04:52.460> you<00:04:52.520> want<00:04:52.789> to

00:04:52.839 --> 00:04:52.849 
they're all cover and now you want to

00:04:52.849 --> 00:04:56.559 
they're all cover and now you want to
cover<00:04:53.060> each<00:04:53.330> side<00:04:54.610> and<00:04:55.610> again<00:04:56.000> it<00:04:56.150> seems<00:04:56.180> to<00:04:56.449> be

00:04:56.559 --> 00:04:56.569 
cover each side and again it seems to be

00:04:56.569 --> 00:05:00.010 
cover each side and again it seems to be
a<00:04:56.599> perfect<00:04:57.080> size<00:04:57.289> if<00:04:57.530> we<00:04:57.650> just<00:04:57.889> do<00:04:58.069> this<00:04:59.020> and

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.020 
a perfect size if we just do this and

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:05.020 
a perfect size if we just do this and
then<00:05:00.080> go<00:05:00.560> down<00:05:02.620> check<00:05:03.620> the<00:05:03.830> little<00:05:04.099> edge<00:05:04.639> in

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:05.030 
then go down check the little edge in

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:16.300 
then go down check the little edge in
like<00:05:05.750> that<00:05:06.460> go<00:05:07.460> down<00:05:07.880> like<00:05:08.120> that<00:05:11.500> and<00:05:14.560> then<00:05:15.560> you

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:16.310 
like that go down like that and then you

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:19.420 
like that go down like that and then you
want<00:05:16.460> these<00:05:16.880> edges<00:05:17.449> to<00:05:17.630> actually<00:05:18.430> overlap

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:19.430 
want these edges to actually overlap

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:22.209 
want these edges to actually overlap
because<00:05:20.330> you<00:05:20.690> really<00:05:21.020> want<00:05:21.229> to<00:05:21.349> make<00:05:22.190> it

00:05:22.209 --> 00:05:22.219 
because you really want to make it

00:05:22.219 --> 00:05:26.969 
because you really want to make it
airtight<00:05:22.659> and<00:05:23.659> we'll<00:05:23.960> do<00:05:24.169> the<00:05:24.320> other<00:05:24.500> side

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:26.979 

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:34.830 

this<00:05:29.590> okay<00:05:31.990> just<00:05:32.990> make<00:05:33.199> sure<00:05:33.440> it's<00:05:33.620> centered

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:34.840 
this okay just make sure it's centered

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:39.600 
this okay just make sure it's centered
and<00:05:35.860> then<00:05:36.860> just<00:05:37.310> cut<00:05:37.820> it<00:05:37.969> a<00:05:38.150> little<00:05:38.449> past<00:05:38.870> the

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:39.610 
and then just cut it a little past the

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:44.860 
and then just cut it a little past the
edge<00:05:40.610> there<00:05:41.210> is<00:05:42.880> two<00:05:43.880> you<00:05:44.389> want<00:05:44.630> to<00:05:44.690> make<00:05:44.750> sure

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:44.870 
edge there is two you want to make sure

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:49.959 
edge there is two you want to make sure
you<00:05:45.110> put<00:05:45.349> this<00:05:45.530> little<00:05:45.800> edge<00:05:46.099> down<00:05:46.940> and<00:05:48.969> push

00:05:49.959 --> 00:05:49.969 
you put this little edge down and push

00:05:49.969 --> 00:05:52.209 
you put this little edge down and push
that<00:05:50.210> right<00:05:50.449> up<00:05:50.780> to<00:05:51.050> the<00:05:51.199> edges<00:05:51.469> and<00:05:51.860> then

00:05:52.209 --> 00:05:52.219 
that right up to the edges and then

00:05:52.219 --> 00:05:56.170 
that right up to the edges and then
really<00:05:52.880> smooth<00:05:53.469> these<00:05:54.469> edges<00:05:55.069> down<00:05:55.370> and<00:05:56.060> you

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:56.180 
really smooth these edges down and you

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:57.969 
really smooth these edges down and you
can<00:05:56.360> squeeze<00:05:56.690> it<00:05:57.020> even<00:05:57.259> like<00:05:57.469> that

00:05:57.969 --> 00:05:57.979 
can squeeze it even like that

00:05:57.979 --> 00:06:00.540 
can squeeze it even like that
just<00:05:58.610> to<00:05:58.759> make<00:05:58.909> sure<00:05:58.969> you<00:05:59.539> have<00:05:59.750> it<00:05:59.900> air<00:06:00.380> tight

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:00.550 
just to make sure you have it air tight

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:04.570 
just to make sure you have it air tight
squeeze<00:06:01.550> squeeze<00:06:01.789> and<00:06:02.530> around<00:06:03.530> here<00:06:03.979> squeeze

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:04.580 
squeeze squeeze and around here squeeze

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:08.379 
squeeze squeeze and around here squeeze
it<00:06:05.590> so<00:06:06.590> that's<00:06:06.889> pretty<00:06:07.370> well<00:06:07.639> in<00:06:07.849> you<00:06:08.120> might

00:06:08.379 --> 00:06:08.389
