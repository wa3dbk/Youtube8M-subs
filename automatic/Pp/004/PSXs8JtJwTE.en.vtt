idea<00:00:09.840> from<00:00:10.139> September<00:00:11.130> we<00:00:11.429> had<00:00:11.730> a<00:00:12.200> reference

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
idea from September we had a reference

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.020 
idea from September we had a reference
design<00:00:13.500> with<00:00:13.710> an<00:00:13.799> e-ink<00:00:13.950> display<00:00:14.490> and<00:00:14.730> we<00:00:14.849> have

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
design with an e-ink display and we have

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.150 
design with an e-ink display and we have
the<00:00:15.150> sky<00:00:15.420> like<00:00:15.599> edition<00:00:16.109> here<00:00:16.470> for<00:00:16.710> us<00:00:16.890> today

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
the sky like edition here for us today

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.660 
the sky like edition here for us today
this<00:00:17.789> is<00:00:17.970> a<00:00:18.000> resolution<00:00:18.300> of<00:00:18.630> 2560<00:00:19.350> by<00:00:19.859> 1440

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
this is a resolution of 2560 by 1440

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.269 
this is a resolution of 2560 by 1440
there's<00:00:21.570> a<00:00:21.660> real<00:00:21.990> sense<00:00:22.230> camera<00:00:22.740> up<00:00:22.949> on<00:00:23.130> the

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
there's a real sense camera up on the

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.160 
there's a real sense camera up on the
top<00:00:23.580> there<00:00:23.850> so<00:00:23.970> that<00:00:24.090> means<00:00:24.180> we<00:00:24.359> can<00:00:24.510> do<00:00:24.660> depth

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
top there so that means we can do depth

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.500 
top there so that means we can do depth
perception<00:00:26.010> and<00:00:26.310> we<00:00:26.730> can<00:00:26.939> also<00:00:27.180> kind<00:00:27.420> of

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
perception and we can also kind of

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.089 
perception and we can also kind of
unlock<00:00:27.869> it<00:00:28.019> with<00:00:28.109> our<00:00:28.260> faces<00:00:28.769> there's

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
unlock it with our faces there's

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.330 
unlock it with our faces there's
probably<00:00:29.820> gonna<00:00:30.029> be<00:00:30.710> pupil<00:00:31.710> tracking<00:00:32.189> I<00:00:32.250> know

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
probably gonna be pupil tracking I know

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.130 
probably gonna be pupil tracking I know
there's<00:00:32.520> eye<00:00:32.640> tracking<00:00:32.969> already<00:00:33.750> involved

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
there's eye tracking already involved

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.139 
there's eye tracking already involved
right<00:00:34.500> now<00:00:34.920> now<00:00:35.190> if<00:00:35.309> we<00:00:35.399> take<00:00:35.579> a<00:00:35.610> look<00:00:35.760> around

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
right now now if we take a look around

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.240 
right now now if we take a look around
the<00:00:36.239> system<00:00:36.540> we've<00:00:36.690> got<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:36.960> two<00:00:37.320> speakers

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
the system we've got the two speakers

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.400 
the system we've got the two speakers
there<00:00:38.489> on<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:38.879> front<00:00:39.360> and<00:00:39.660> around<00:00:39.719> the<00:00:40.050> side

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
there on the front and around the side

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.590 
there on the front and around the side
you<00:00:40.620> can<00:00:40.770> see<00:00:40.829> that<00:00:41.550> we<00:00:41.640> have<00:00:41.760> a<00:00:41.790> display<00:00:42.239> port

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
you can see that we have a display port

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.540 
you can see that we have a display port
there's<00:00:42.960> no<00:00:43.200> oath<00:00:43.559> under<00:00:43.890> bold<00:00:44.219> whoa

there<00:00:47.520> there's<00:00:47.789> a<00:00:47.850> SIM<00:00:48.239> card<00:00:48.480> slot<00:00:48.719> there<00:00:48.930> that

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
there there's a SIM card slot there that

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.590 
there there's a SIM card slot there that
would<00:00:49.860> be<00:00:49.890> your<00:00:50.280> headphone<00:00:50.760> jack<00:00:50.789> volume

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
would be your headphone jack volume

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.630 
would be your headphone jack volume
rocker<00:00:51.840> and<00:00:52.050> then<00:00:52.379> that<00:00:52.559> looks<00:00:52.920> like<00:00:53.100> a<00:00:53.129> screw

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
rocker and then that looks like a screw

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.939 
rocker and then that looks like a screw
and<00:00:56.640> if<00:00:56.789> we<00:00:56.910> take<00:00:57.030> a<00:00:57.090> look<00:00:57.329> at<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.809> back<00:00:58.109> this

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
and if we take a look at the back this

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.650 
and if we take a look at the back this
is<00:00:59.129> where<00:00:59.340> we<00:00:59.520> have<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.879> e-ink<00:01:00.059> display

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
is where we have the e-ink display

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.479 
is where we have the e-ink display
what's<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:00.960> resolution<00:01:01.440> on<00:01:01.559> this<00:01:01.710> display<00:01:01.980> I

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
what's the resolution on this display I

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.820 
what's the resolution on this display I
don't<00:01:03.120> it's<00:01:03.539> just<00:01:03.809> an<00:01:03.960> eating<00:01:04.199> display<00:01:04.680> we

things<00:01:21.420> going<00:01:21.689> on<00:01:21.900> here<00:01:22.110> and<00:01:22.170> this<00:01:22.290> is<00:01:22.500> why

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
things going on here and this is why

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.440 
things going on here and this is why
it's<00:01:22.979> targeted<00:01:23.369> at<00:01:23.460> software<00:01:23.939> developers

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
it's targeted at software developers

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.200 
it's targeted at software developers
because<00:01:24.630> Intel<00:01:25.170> wants<00:01:25.680> people<00:01:26.310> to<00:01:26.490> say<00:01:26.759> what

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
because Intel wants people to say what

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.609 
because Intel wants people to say what
are<00:01:27.270> we<00:01:27.360> gonna<00:01:27.509> do<00:01:27.720> with<00:01:27.869> this<00:01:27.990> let's<00:01:28.200> innovate

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
are we gonna do with this let's innovate

are we gonna do with this let's innovate
on<00:01:28.799> this<00:01:29.009> new<00:01:29.189> platform<00:01:29.430> now<00:01:29.909> along<00:01:30.509> with<00:01:30.540> the

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
on this new platform now along with the

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.630 
on this new platform now along with the
innovation<00:01:31.380> of<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.619> ink<00:01:31.950> display<00:01:32.070> which<00:01:32.490> is

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
innovation of the ink display which is

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.460 
innovation of the ink display which is
totally<00:01:33.030> cool<00:01:33.270> I<00:01:33.329> love<00:01:33.720> it

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
totally cool I love it

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.350 
totally cool I love it
you<00:01:34.770> also<00:01:34.920> have<00:01:35.220> wide<00:01:35.490> eye<00:01:35.520> and<00:01:36.030> wireless

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
you also have wide eye and wireless

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.090 
you also have wide eye and wireless
charging<00:01:36.689> into<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.170> base<00:01:37.380> and<00:01:37.650> of<00:01:37.740> course<00:01:37.950> it

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
charging into the base and of course it

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.440 
charging into the base and of course it
is<00:01:38.189> a<00:01:38.220> touchscreen<00:01:38.549> cuz<00:01:38.790> it's<00:01:38.909> like<00:01:38.970> a<00:01:39.060> tablet

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
is a touchscreen cuz it's like a tablet

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.020 
is a touchscreen cuz it's like a tablet
and<00:01:39.630> boom<00:01:40.140> we<00:01:40.409> got<00:01:40.560> some<00:01:40.770> windows<00:01:41.189> 10<00:01:41.640> on<00:01:41.790> there

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
and boom we got some windows 10 on there

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.630 
and boom we got some windows 10 on there
because<00:01:42.509> that<00:01:42.780> action<00:01:43.350> definitely<00:01:44.070> needs<00:01:44.369> to
