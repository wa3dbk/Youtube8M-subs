00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
something like that I like getting a

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:41.260 
something like that I like getting a
whole<00:01:39.469> new<00:01:39.499> bike<00:01:39.799> all<00:01:40.159> together<00:01:40.700> at<00:01:41.030> the<00:01:41.060> same

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
whole new bike all together at the same

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.359 
whole new bike all together at the same
time<00:01:41.509> so<00:01:41.929> that<00:01:41.960> way<00:01:42.350> everything's<00:01:42.740> fresh<00:01:43.069> and

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:43.369 
time so that way everything's fresh and

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:44.529 
time so that way everything's fresh and
it<00:01:43.579> usually<00:01:43.880> lasts<00:01:44.119> longer<00:01:44.509> when

00:01:44.529 --> 00:01:44.539 
it usually lasts longer when

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:46.059 
it usually lasts longer when
everything's<00:01:45.049> new<00:01:45.259> you<00:01:45.439> don't<00:01:45.590> have<00:01:45.679> to<00:01:45.799> keep

00:01:46.059 --> 00:01:46.069 
everything's new you don't have to keep

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:48.039 
everything's new you don't have to keep
switching<00:01:46.249> out<00:01:46.579> parts<00:01:46.969> cuz<00:01:47.210> everything

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:48.049 
switching out parts cuz everything

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:51.099 
switching out parts cuz everything
usually<00:01:48.590> has<00:01:49.130> the<00:01:49.219> same<00:01:49.429> wide<00:01:49.639> span<00:01:49.969> so<00:01:50.299> it's

00:01:51.099 --> 00:01:51.109 
usually has the same wide span so it's

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:54.099 
usually has the same wide span so it's
better<00:01:51.259> to<00:01:51.469> just<00:01:51.649> get<00:01:51.799> a<00:01:51.829> new<00:01:52.759> bike<00:01:52.999> every<00:01:53.329> six

00:01:54.099 --> 00:01:54.109 
better to just get a new bike every six

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:56.379 
better to just get a new bike every six
months<00:01:54.469> then<00:01:54.679> switch<00:01:55.310> out<00:01:55.490> parts<00:01:55.789> every<00:01:56.090> two

00:01:56.379 --> 00:01:56.389 
months then switch out parts every two

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:59.410 
months then switch out parts every two
weeks<00:01:56.630> or<00:01:56.840> so<00:01:57.049> I<00:01:57.939> don't<00:01:58.939> really<00:01:59.060> care<00:01:59.299> about

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
weeks or so I don't really care about

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.690 
weeks or so I don't really care about

00:02:02.919 --> 00:02:02.929 
like an average weight right now it's

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:04.929 
like an average weight right now it's
not<00:02:03.079> too<00:02:03.259> light<00:02:03.469> not<00:02:03.530> too<00:02:03.920> heavy<00:02:04.159> and<00:02:04.310> doesn't

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:04.939 
not too light not too heavy and doesn't

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:07.599 
not too light not too heavy and doesn't
bother<00:02:05.209> me<00:02:05.389> so<00:02:05.649> it's<00:02:06.649> fine<00:02:06.889> the<00:02:07.039> way<00:02:07.159> it<00:02:07.189> is

00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:07.609

not very tall I think I'm like five six
or<00:02:16.260> so<00:02:16.470> so<00:02:16.950> I<00:02:16.980> need<00:02:17.250> something<00:02:17.580> a<00:02:17.610> little<00:02:17.730> bit

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
smaller I tried running a twenty point

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:23.030 
smaller I tried running a twenty point
seven<00:02:21.540> five<00:02:21.690> it<00:02:21.990> was<00:02:22.050> too<00:02:22.230> big<00:02:22.410> for<00:02:22.650> me<00:02:22.770> so<00:02:23.010> I

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040
