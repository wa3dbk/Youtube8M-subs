clip<00:00:32.910> I<00:00:33.000> want<00:00:33.090> to<00:00:33.239> show<00:00:33.420> here<00:00:33.809> is<00:00:33.960> I've<00:00:34.559> got<00:00:34.770> my

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:35.690 
clip I want to show here is I've got my

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.900 
clip I want to show here is I've got my
large<00:00:36.690> level<00:00:37.079> out<00:00:37.230> because<00:00:37.590> when<00:00:38.520> I<00:00:38.579> stalled

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
large level out because when I stalled

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.540 
large level out because when I stalled
it<00:00:39.090> looked<00:00:39.600> like<00:00:39.750> it<00:00:39.899> was<00:00:39.989> off<00:00:40.230> just<00:00:40.590> slightly

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
it looked like it was off just slightly

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.600 
it looked like it was off just slightly
so<00:00:42.420> I<00:00:42.450> wanted<00:00:42.989> to<00:00:43.140> confirm<00:00:43.559> that<00:00:43.620> so<00:00:44.250> I<00:00:44.280> pulled

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
so I wanted to confirm that so I pulled

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.959 
so I wanted to confirm that so I pulled
out<00:00:44.730> my<00:00:45.500> regular<00:00:46.500> construction<00:00:46.860> level<00:00:47.340> and<00:00:47.700> I

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
out my regular construction level and I

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.729 
out my regular construction level and I
was<00:00:48.270> able<00:00:48.510> to<00:00:48.539> confirm<00:00:48.930> it<00:00:48.960> was<00:00:49.289> off<00:00:49.500> a<00:00:49.530> little

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
was able to confirm it was off a little

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.900 
was able to confirm it was off a little
bit<00:00:50.270> so<00:00:51.270> what<00:00:52.020> I<00:00:52.050> wanted<00:00:52.469> to<00:00:52.620> check<00:00:52.920> was<00:00:53.280> how<00:00:53.670> it

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
bit so what I wanted to check was how it

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.850 
bit so what I wanted to check was how it
actually<00:00:54.420> got<00:00:54.570> off<00:00:54.780> when<00:00:55.110> I<00:00:55.199> installed<00:00:55.559> it<00:00:55.739> it

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
actually got off when I installed it it

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.660 
actually got off when I installed it it
looked<00:00:56.539> slightly<00:00:57.539> off<00:00:57.780> but<00:00:58.489> instead<00:00:59.489> of

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
looked slightly off but instead of

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.260 
looked slightly off but instead of
trying<00:01:00.329> to<00:01:00.680> use<00:01:01.680> a<00:01:01.710> separate<00:01:02.579> tool<00:01:02.760> I<00:01:03.030> wanted

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
trying to use a separate tool I wanted

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.210 
trying to use a separate tool I wanted
to<00:01:03.390> just<00:01:03.600> do<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.960> clean<00:01:04.199> install<00:01:04.530> just<00:01:04.979> like

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
the product was delivered and the

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.020 
the product was delivered and the
instructions<00:01:07.890> had<00:01:08.100> indicated<00:01:08.640> to<00:01:08.729> do<00:01:08.880> the

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
instructions had indicated to do the

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:15.170 
instructions had indicated to do the
install<00:01:10.820> so<00:01:11.820> I<00:01:13.310> wanted<00:01:14.310> to<00:01:14.460> after<00:01:14.700> I<00:01:14.820> did<00:01:15.060> the

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
install so I wanted to after I did the

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.450 
install so I wanted to after I did the
install<00:01:15.450> just<00:01:15.659> kind<00:01:15.930> of<00:01:16.020> confirm<00:01:16.439> that<00:01:17.100> it<00:01:17.250> was

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
install just kind of confirm that it was

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.440 
install just kind of confirm that it was
off<00:01:17.670> number<00:01:18.060> one<00:01:18.299> so<00:01:18.689> I<00:01:18.720> took<00:01:19.619> it<00:01:19.770> apart<00:01:20.009> and

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
off number one so I took it apart and

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.880 
off number one so I took it apart and
wanted<00:01:21.450> to<00:01:21.540> try<00:01:21.720> to<00:01:21.780> figure<00:01:22.110> out<00:01:22.259> exactly<00:01:22.439> how

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
wanted to try to figure out exactly how

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.760 
wanted to try to figure out exactly how
that<00:01:23.640> happened<00:01:24.200> one<00:01:25.200> of<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.380> things<00:01:25.619> I

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
that happened one of the things I

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.600 
that happened one of the things I
learned<00:01:26.009> is<00:01:27.320> took<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.530> proprietary<00:01:29.189> screws

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
learned is took the proprietary screws

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.690 
learned is took the proprietary screws
loose<00:01:29.970> and<00:01:30.270> opened<00:01:30.720> it<00:01:30.810> back<00:01:30.930> up<00:01:31.200> and<00:01:32.100> I<00:01:32.310> was<00:01:32.520> I

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
loose and opened it back up and I was I

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.340 
loose and opened it back up and I was I
put<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.299> level<00:01:33.990> back<00:01:34.350> in<00:01:34.619> position<00:01:35.720> there<00:01:36.720> in

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
put the level back in position there in

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.090 
put the level back in position there in
what<00:01:38.220> I<00:01:38.250> learned<00:01:38.640> was<00:01:38.970> that<00:01:39.320> the<00:01:40.320> slots<00:01:40.740> where

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
what I learned was that the slots where

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.719 
what I learned was that the slots where
the<00:01:41.460> level<00:01:41.850> was<00:01:42.659> installed<00:01:43.380> originally<00:01:44.220> it

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
the level was installed originally it

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.280 
the level was installed originally it
was<00:01:45.090> placed<00:01:45.450> when<00:01:45.689> it<00:01:45.810> was<00:01:45.930> in<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.229> original

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
was placed when it was in the original

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.510 
was placed when it was in the original
container<00:01:47.189> it<00:01:47.970> rocks<00:01:48.420> just<00:01:48.780> ever<00:01:49.140> so<00:01:49.380> slightly

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
container it rocks just ever so slightly

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.810 
container it rocks just ever so slightly
so<00:01:50.520> it<00:01:50.579> was<00:01:50.700> just<00:01:51.000> enough<00:01:51.360> to<00:01:51.869> make<00:01:52.020> it<00:01:52.079> off<00:01:52.820> a

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
so it was just enough to make it off a

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.020 
so it was just enough to make it off a
little<00:01:54.750> bit<00:01:55.020> so<00:01:55.350> it<00:01:55.560> doesn't<00:01:55.670> it<00:01:56.670> wasn't

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
little bit so it doesn't it wasn't

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.420 
little bit so it doesn't it wasn't
exactly<00:01:57.149> a<00:01:57.509> hundred<00:01:57.600> level<00:01:58.290> so<00:01:59.070> I<00:01:59.130> checked

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
exactly a hundred level so I checked

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.100 
exactly a hundred level so I checked
several<00:01:59.790> of<00:01:59.909> the<00:02:00.060> different<00:02:00.240> slots<00:02:00.719> that<00:02:00.960> was

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
several of the different slots that was

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.120 
several of the different slots that was
in<00:02:01.290> there<00:02:01.759> and<00:02:02.759> tried<00:02:03.509> to<00:02:03.540> see<00:02:04.320> that<00:02:04.619> I<00:02:04.649> jiggle

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
in there and tried to see that I jiggle

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.850 
in there and tried to see that I jiggle
a<00:02:05.310> little<00:02:05.340> bit<00:02:05.759> to<00:02:05.939> see<00:02:06.149> if<00:02:06.180> it<00:02:06.450> would<00:02:06.600> move<00:02:06.860> and

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
a little bit to see if it would move and

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.029 
a little bit to see if it would move and
it<00:02:08.069> was<00:02:08.190> just<00:02:08.459> enough<00:02:08.729> to<00:02:08.849> be<00:02:08.970> off<00:02:09.200> so<00:02:10.200> what<00:02:10.920> I'd

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
it was just enough to be off so what I'd

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.730 
it was just enough to be off so what I'd
recommend<00:02:11.069> that<00:02:11.790> you<00:02:12.599> consider<00:02:13.110> when<00:02:13.530> you

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
recommend that you consider when you

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.860 
recommend that you consider when you
do<00:02:14.430> this<00:02:14.670> is<00:02:14.970> maybe<00:02:15.840> just<00:02:15.990> lay<00:02:16.410> it<00:02:16.530> on<00:02:16.650> top<00:02:16.680> and

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
do this is maybe just lay it on top and

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.320 
do this is maybe just lay it on top and
what<00:02:18.870> I<00:02:18.900> found<00:02:19.200> was<00:02:19.620> that<00:02:19.950> if<00:02:20.880> you<00:02:21.000> lay<00:02:21.150> it<00:02:21.210> on

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
what I found was that if you lay it on

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.000 
what I found was that if you lay it on
top<00:02:21.360> of<00:02:22.080> the<00:02:22.440> unit

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
top of the unit

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.360 
top of the unit
it<00:02:23.460> really<00:02:23.730> does<00:02:24.000> square<00:02:24.360> it<00:02:24.510> up<00:02:24.660> and<00:02:24.960> it<00:02:25.890> it

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
it really does square it up and it it

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.520 
it really does square it up and it it
will<00:02:26.490> tell<00:02:26.790> you<00:02:26.910> exactly<00:02:27.150> whether<00:02:27.930> it's<00:02:28.170> level

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
will tell you exactly whether it's level

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.250 
will tell you exactly whether it's level
or<00:02:28.620> not<00:02:28.800> so<00:02:29.610> the<00:02:29.790> level<00:02:30.060> itself<00:02:30.420> is<00:02:30.630> accurate<00:02:31.140> I

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
or not so the level itself is accurate I

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.850 
or not so the level itself is accurate I
just<00:02:31.470> I<00:02:31.770> wanted<00:02:32.520> to<00:02:32.580> do<00:02:32.790> some<00:02:32.970> testing<00:02:33.360> on<00:02:33.540> the

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
just I wanted to do some testing on the

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:39.350 
just I wanted to do some testing on the
level<00:02:35.180> piece<00:02:36.180> itself<00:02:36.720> and<00:02:37.020> it<00:02:37.800> does<00:02:37.830> work<00:02:38.360> so

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
level piece itself and it does work so

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.220 
level piece itself and it does work so
dis<00:02:39.810> lay<00:02:40.020> it<00:02:40.140> on<00:02:40.230> top<00:02:40.640> the<00:02:41.640> other<00:02:41.670> thing<00:02:42.090> that<00:02:42.390> I

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
dis lay it on top the other thing that I

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.190 
dis lay it on top the other thing that I
did<00:02:43.440> learn<00:02:43.860> with<00:02:44.160> this<00:02:44.430> is<00:02:44.760> when<00:02:45.750> I<00:02:45.780> put<00:02:46.050> the

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
did learn with this is when I put the

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.060 
did learn with this is when I put the
screws<00:02:46.560> in<00:02:46.860> and<00:02:47.160> use<00:02:48.120> the<00:02:48.300> drill<00:02:48.600> the<00:02:49.590> in

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
screws in and use the drill the in

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.390 
screws in and use the drill the in
masonry<00:02:50.840> the<00:02:51.840> hole<00:02:52.230> got<00:02:52.500> a<00:02:52.530> little<00:02:52.830> bigger<00:02:53.040> as

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
masonry the hole got a little bigger as

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.330 
masonry the hole got a little bigger as
I<00:02:53.730> mentioned<00:02:54.120> in<00:02:54.180> the<00:02:54.270> last<00:02:54.420> video<00:02:54.690> and<00:02:55.320> so<00:02:56.310> I

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
I mentioned in the last video and so I

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.990 
I mentioned in the last video and so I
had<00:02:56.610> to<00:02:56.730> put<00:02:56.910> in<00:02:57.060> some<00:02:57.980> oversized<00:02:58.980> inserts<00:02:59.640> and

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
had to put in some oversized inserts and

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.260 
had to put in some oversized inserts and
a<00:03:00.450> little<00:03:00.900> bit<00:03:00.990> larger<00:03:01.350> screws<00:03:01.740> to<00:03:02.100> hold<00:03:02.220> it<00:03:02.460> so

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.270 
a little bit larger screws to hold it so

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:05.030 
a little bit larger screws to hold it so
most<00:03:03.570> of<00:03:03.750> the<00:03:03.840> screws<00:03:04.110> are<00:03:04.260> tight<00:03:04.500> there's<00:03:04.830> one

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
most of the screws are tight there's one

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.330 
most of the screws are tight there's one
that's<00:03:05.160> still<00:03:05.430> loose<00:03:05.700> and<00:03:06.680> you<00:03:07.680> can<00:03:07.710> see<00:03:08.040> here

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
that's still loose and you can see here

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.000 
that's still loose and you can see here
that<00:03:08.490> I've<00:03:08.610> got<00:03:08.640> the<00:03:09.000> electrical<00:03:10.010> low-voltage

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
that I've got the electrical low-voltage

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.610 
that I've got the electrical low-voltage
doorbell<00:03:12.000> system<00:03:12.690> in<00:03:12.810> my<00:03:12.960> house<00:03:13.170> and<00:03:13.440> hooked

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
doorbell system in my house and hooked

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:14.810 
doorbell system in my house and hooked
up<00:03:13.740> and<00:03:14.040> that<00:03:14.220> part<00:03:14.430> was<00:03:14.580> very

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820 
up and that part was very

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.360 
up and that part was very
straightforward<00:03:15.150> very<00:03:15.570> simple<00:03:16.250> screwed<00:03:17.250> it

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
straightforward very simple screwed it

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:22.370 
straightforward very simple screwed it
in<00:03:17.550> and<00:03:17.940> it<00:03:18.090> worked<00:03:18.330> fine<00:03:19.850> so<00:03:21.290> from<00:03:22.290> the

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
in and it worked fine so from the

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.770 
in and it worked fine so from the
standpoint<00:03:22.620> of<00:03:22.950> that<00:03:23.570> that's<00:03:24.570> my

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
standpoint of that that's my

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.560 
standpoint of that that's my
recommendation<00:03:25.110> for<00:03:25.850> the<00:03:26.850> install<00:03:27.180> the<00:03:27.450> other

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
recommendation for the install the other

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:30.890 
recommendation for the install the other
thing<00:03:27.810> I<00:03:27.900> would<00:03:27.960> say<00:03:28.350> is<00:03:28.820> that<00:03:29.820> once<00:03:30.720> you

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
thing I would say is that once you

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.760 
thing I would say is that once you
install<00:03:31.410> it<00:03:31.440> if<00:03:31.890> you<00:03:32.100> have<00:03:32.340> luck<00:03:32.580> at

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:33.770 
install it if you have luck at

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:36.020 
install it if you have luck at
wood-framed<00:03:34.770> house<00:03:35.070> or<00:03:35.490> you<00:03:35.610> have<00:03:35.730> a<00:03:35.760> wood

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
wood-framed house or you have a wood

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.450 
wood-framed house or you have a wood
condition<00:03:36.660> then<00:03:37.410> I<00:03:37.680> think<00:03:37.950> it<00:03:38.100> would<00:03:38.190> really

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:38.460 
condition then I think it would really

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:40.580 
condition then I think it would really
work<00:03:38.760> a<00:03:38.970> lot<00:03:39.210> better<00:03:39.450> because<00:03:39.930> I<00:03:40.200> think<00:03:40.260> that

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
work a lot better because I think that

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:42.680 
work a lot better because I think that
the<00:03:40.950> only<00:03:41.160> problem<00:03:41.490> I<00:03:41.640> the<00:03:42.030> main<00:03:42.210> problem<00:03:42.600> I

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
the only problem I the main problem I

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:46.070 
the only problem I the main problem I
had<00:03:42.900> was<00:03:43.830> that<00:03:44.130> was<00:03:44.250> masonry<00:03:44.760> and<00:03:44.970> that<00:03:45.870> dis

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080 
had was that was masonry and that dis

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.640 
had was that was masonry and that dis
didn't<00:03:47.570> fit<00:03:48.570> in<00:03:48.720> as<00:03:48.930> snug<00:03:49.170> as<00:03:49.320> I<00:03:49.440> would<00:03:49.590> have

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
didn't fit in as snug as I would have

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.940 
didn't fit in as snug as I would have
normally<00:03:49.950> liked<00:03:50.370> but<00:03:50.610> it<00:03:50.730> seemed<00:03:50.970> to<00:03:51.060> work

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 
normally liked but it seemed to work

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:55.070 
normally liked but it seemed to work
then<00:03:52.950> next<00:03:53.460> I<00:03:53.610> want<00:03:53.760> to<00:03:53.850> talk<00:03:53.970> about<00:03:54.090> the<00:03:54.510> app<00:03:54.630> a

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:55.080 
then next I want to talk about the app a

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:59.180 
then next I want to talk about the app a
I<00:03:55.560> have<00:03:56.160> it<00:03:56.310> on<00:03:56.430> the<00:03:56.610> iPhone<00:03:57.740> in<00:03:58.740> the<00:03:58.800> app

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
I have it on the iPhone in the app

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.490 
I have it on the iPhone in the app
install<00:03:59.640> was<00:03:59.940> very<00:04:00.180> straightforward<00:04:00.510> it

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
install was very straightforward it

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:06.200 
install was very straightforward it
worked<00:04:01.770> fine<00:04:02.480> the<00:04:03.480> setup<00:04:03.810> was<00:04:03.990> easy<00:04:04.670> and<00:04:05.670> all

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:06.210 
worked fine the setup was easy and all

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:09.350 
worked fine the setup was easy and all
of<00:04:06.420> that<00:04:06.630> went<00:04:07.440> fairly<00:04:07.800> smooth<00:04:08.220> so<00:04:09.150> the

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 
of that went fairly smooth so the

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:10.940 
of that went fairly smooth so the
operation<00:04:09.930> this<00:04:10.140> is<00:04:10.290> kind<00:04:10.500> of<00:04:10.530> what<00:04:10.680> it<00:04:10.770> looks

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
operation this is kind of what it looks

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:13.449 
operation this is kind of what it looks
like<00:04:11.130> and<00:04:11.430> it<00:04:11.490> gives<00:04:11.730> you<00:04:11.940> recent<00:04:12.630> activity

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:13.459 
like and it gives you recent activity

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:20.729 
like and it gives you recent activity
and<00:04:14.810> so<00:04:15.810> you<00:04:15.870> can<00:04:18.230> look<00:04:19.230> at<00:04:19.380> some<00:04:19.590> of<00:04:19.709> your

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 
and so you can look at some of your

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:28.710 
and so you can look at some of your
your<00:04:21.310> videos<00:04:21.759> that<00:04:26.160> it<00:04:27.160> it<00:04:27.789> records<00:04:28.449> and<00:04:28.630> it

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 
your videos that it it records and it

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:33.950 
your videos that it it records and it
maintains<00:04:29.199> those<00:04:29.470> videos<00:04:30.569> available<00:04:31.569> online

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:38.059 

let's<00:04:34.960> see<00:04:35.319> here<00:04:35.710> if<00:04:35.949> I<00:04:36.430> can<00:04:36.610> get<00:04:36.819> one<00:04:36.849> that's

00:04:38.059 --> 00:04:38.069 
let's see here if I can get one that's

00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:46.589 
let's see here if I can get one that's
got<00:04:41.009> got<00:04:42.009> a<00:04:42.039> video<00:04:42.400> here<00:04:44.430> so<00:04:45.430> it<00:04:45.849> does<00:04:46.120> it<00:04:46.419> does

00:04:46.589 --> 00:04:46.599 
got got a video here so it does it does

00:04:46.599 --> 00:04:50.189 
got got a video here so it does it does
keep<00:04:46.810> all<00:04:47.020> of<00:04:47.050> that<00:04:47.580> available<00:04:48.580> in<00:04:49.020> one<00:04:50.020> of<00:04:50.139> the

00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:50.199 
keep all of that available in one of the

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:52.950 
keep all of that available in one of the
main<00:04:50.380> things<00:04:50.650> that<00:04:50.740> we<00:04:50.889> did<00:04:51.190> learn<00:04:51.460> to<00:04:51.669> also<00:04:52.630> is

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:52.960 
main things that we did learn to also is

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.050 
main things that we did learn to also is
when<00:04:53.320> you<00:04:53.560> get<00:04:53.770> deliveries<00:04:54.310> a<00:04:54.580> lot<00:04:54.729> of<00:04:54.820> times

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:55.060 
when you get deliveries a lot of times

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.300 
when you get deliveries a lot of times
the<00:04:55.330> delivery<00:04:55.780> folks<00:04:56.380> will<00:04:56.710> come<00:04:56.979> and<00:04:57.160> ring

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:57.310 
the delivery folks will come and ring

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:58.980 
the delivery folks will come and ring
the<00:04:57.430> doorbell<00:04:57.460> they'll<00:04:58.120> leave<00:04:58.300> the<00:04:58.479> box<00:04:58.720> on

00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:58.990 
the doorbell they'll leave the box on

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:00.839 
the doorbell they'll leave the box on
the<00:04:59.110> door<00:04:59.380> and<00:04:59.560> then<00:05:00.070> they'll<00:05:00.250> just<00:05:00.430> take<00:05:00.610> off

00:05:00.839 --> 00:05:00.849 
the door and then they'll just take off

00:05:00.849 --> 00:05:02.580 
the door and then they'll just take off
so<00:05:01.180> by<00:05:01.360> the<00:05:01.449> time<00:05:01.660> you<00:05:01.780> get<00:05:01.930> the<00:05:02.349> application

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:02.590 
so by the time you get the application

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:06.930 
so by the time you get the application
up<00:05:03.130> it<00:05:03.370> does<00:05:03.520> ring<00:05:03.759> pretty<00:05:05.310> quick<00:05:06.310> so<00:05:06.340> when

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:06.940 
up it does ring pretty quick so when

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:09.200 
up it does ring pretty quick so when
someone<00:05:07.630> rings<00:05:07.750> the<00:05:07.930> doorbell<00:05:08.320> it's<00:05:08.590> fairly

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:09.210 
someone rings the doorbell it's fairly

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:11.820 
someone rings the doorbell it's fairly
responsive<00:05:10.210> but<00:05:11.020> went<00:05:11.199> by<00:05:11.349> the<00:05:11.410> time<00:05:11.620> you<00:05:11.710> get

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:11.830 
responsive but went by the time you get

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:14.159 
responsive but went by the time you get
the<00:05:11.919> video<00:05:12.099> up<00:05:12.550> get<00:05:13.120> the<00:05:13.240> app<00:05:13.360> and<00:05:13.690> open<00:05:14.080> the

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:14.169 
the video up get the app and open the

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:16.499 
the video up get the app and open the
app<00:05:14.320> and<00:05:14.530> get<00:05:14.620> the<00:05:14.740> video<00:05:14.979> up<00:05:15.250> it's<00:05:15.550> there

00:05:16.499 --> 00:05:16.509 
app and get the video up it's there

00:05:16.509 --> 00:05:17.189 
app and get the video up it's there
either

00:05:17.189 --> 00:05:17.199 
either

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:19.430 
either
already<00:05:17.830> gone<00:05:18.039> or<00:05:18.460> they're<00:05:18.639> walking<00:05:18.789> away

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:19.440 
already gone or they're walking away

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:22.680 
already gone or they're walking away
with<00:05:20.440> the<00:05:20.740> delivery<00:05:21.610> trucks<00:05:21.880> but<00:05:22.240> they<00:05:22.479> don't

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:22.690 
with the delivery trucks but they don't

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:24.540 
with the delivery trucks but they don't
they<00:05:23.020> normally<00:05:23.380> don't<00:05:23.590> stay<00:05:23.830> around<00:05:24.130> anyway

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:24.550 
they normally don't stay around anyway

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:28.290 
they normally don't stay around anyway
so<00:05:25.389> if<00:05:25.479> someone's<00:05:25.810> coming<00:05:25.960> to<00:05:26.229> your<00:05:26.380> home<00:05:27.300> to

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:28.300 
so if someone's coming to your home to

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:29.820 
so if someone's coming to your home to
talk<00:05:28.539> to<00:05:28.750> you<00:05:28.870> or<00:05:28.930> whatever<00:05:29.259> they<00:05:29.620> probably

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:29.830 
talk to you or whatever they probably

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:32.100 
talk to you or whatever they probably
would<00:05:30.310> stay<00:05:30.490> a<00:05:30.520> little<00:05:30.610> bit<00:05:30.759> longer<00:05:30.849> and<00:05:31.419> so<00:05:31.960> we

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:32.110 
would stay a little bit longer and so we

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:34.350 
would stay a little bit longer and so we
have<00:05:32.289> tested<00:05:32.740> this<00:05:32.860> both<00:05:33.159> on<00:05:33.430> Wi-Fi<00:05:34.000> as<00:05:34.330> well

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:34.360 
have tested this both on Wi-Fi as well

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:38.100 
have tested this both on Wi-Fi as well
set<00:05:34.870> cell<00:05:35.349> network<00:05:35.740> and<00:05:36.550> it<00:05:36.820> will<00:05:37.030> work<00:05:37.389> fine

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:38.110 
set cell network and it will work fine

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:41.040 
set cell network and it will work fine
with<00:05:38.469> both<00:05:38.710> of<00:05:38.919> those<00:05:39.099> it's<00:05:40.030> but<00:05:40.810> there<00:05:40.930> are

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:41.050 
with both of those it's but there are

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:43.950 
with both of those it's but there are
some<00:05:41.800> of<00:05:41.889> the<00:05:41.979> delays<00:05:42.340> with<00:05:42.759> the<00:05:42.789> cell<00:05:43.690> network

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:43.960 
some of the delays with the cell network

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:46.050 
some of the delays with the cell network
which<00:05:44.380> is<00:05:44.530> to<00:05:44.710> be<00:05:44.830> expected<00:05:45.219> on<00:05:45.580> certain

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:46.060 
which is to be expected on certain

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:47.730 
which is to be expected on certain
communication<00:05:46.750> depends<00:05:47.199> on<00:05:47.380> where<00:05:47.590> you're<00:05:47.710> at

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:47.740 
communication depends on where you're at

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:52.529 
communication depends on where you're at
and<00:05:48.210> that<00:05:49.210> sort<00:05:49.539> of<00:05:49.630> thing<00:05:50.580> so<00:05:51.580> all<00:05:51.940> in<00:05:52.120> all<00:05:52.240> I

00:05:52.529 --> 00:05:52.539 
and that sort of thing so all in all I

00:05:52.539 --> 00:05:55.860 
and that sort of thing so all in all I
would<00:05:52.570> say<00:05:52.780> that<00:05:53.500> I<00:05:53.830> would<00:05:54.789> give<00:05:54.940> this<00:05:55.180> maybe<00:05:55.750> a

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:55.870 
would say that I would give this maybe a

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:58.350 
would say that I would give this maybe a
three<00:05:56.440> and<00:05:56.500> a<00:05:56.590> half<00:05:56.740> out<00:05:56.919> of<00:05:56.949> five<00:05:57.070> stars<00:05:57.580> just

00:05:58.350 --> 00:05:58.360 
three and a half out of five stars just

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:00.749 
three and a half out of five stars just
for<00:05:58.570> a<00:05:58.630> couple<00:05:58.900> reasons<00:05:59.250> I<00:06:00.250> think<00:06:00.580> the

00:06:00.749 --> 00:06:00.759 
for a couple reasons I think the

00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:04.080 
for a couple reasons I think the
technology<00:06:01.240> is<00:06:01.870> not<00:06:02.169> quite<00:06:02.680> 100%<00:06:03.400> there<00:06:04.060> yet

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:04.090 
technology is not quite 100% there yet

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:07.709 
technology is not quite 100% there yet
for<00:06:04.719> this<00:06:04.870> type<00:06:05.199> of<00:06:05.229> device<00:06:06.270> given<00:06:07.270> all<00:06:07.389> the

00:06:07.709 --> 00:06:07.719 
for this type of device given all the

00:06:07.719 --> 00:06:11.430 
for this type of device given all the
network<00:06:08.710> speeds<00:06:09.039> and<00:06:09.840> wireless<00:06:10.840> and<00:06:11.080> those

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:11.440 
network speeds and wireless and those

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:13.860 
network speeds and wireless and those
kinds<00:06:11.860> of<00:06:11.919> things<00:06:12.270> but<00:06:13.270> it<00:06:13.330> served<00:06:13.690> the

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:13.870 
kinds of things but it served the

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:16.529 
kinds of things but it served the
purpose<00:06:14.289> for<00:06:14.530> what<00:06:14.919> we<00:06:15.070> wanted<00:06:15.370> to<00:06:15.490> do<00:06:15.669> and<00:06:15.969> the

00:06:16.529 --> 00:06:16.539 
purpose for what we wanted to do and the

00:06:16.539 --> 00:06:18.719 
purpose for what we wanted to do and the
last<00:06:16.690> thing<00:06:17.080> is<00:06:17.409> is<00:06:17.710> we're<00:06:17.979> still<00:06:18.190> waiting<00:06:18.520> on

00:06:18.719 --> 00:06:18.729 
last thing is is we're still waiting on

00:06:18.729 --> 00:06:21.990 
last thing is is we're still waiting on
the<00:06:19.120> motion<00:06:19.659> activation<00:06:20.729> component<00:06:21.729> so<00:06:21.969> that

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:22.000 
the motion activation component so that

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.540 
the motion activation component so that
when<00:06:22.509> you<00:06:22.659> it<00:06:23.080> detects<00:06:23.440> motion<00:06:23.710> it's<00:06:24.130> supposed

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:24.550 
when you it detects motion it's supposed

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:28.800 
when you it detects motion it's supposed
to<00:06:24.669> come<00:06:25.120> on<00:06:25.360> and<00:06:25.539> record<00:06:26.159> so<00:06:27.159> that's<00:06:27.880> that's

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:28.810 
to come on and record so that's that's

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:31.320 
to come on and record so that's that's
