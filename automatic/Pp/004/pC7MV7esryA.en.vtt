distinctly<00:01:28.770> remember<00:01:29.040> wondering<00:01:29.940> why<00:01:30.210> I

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
distinctly remember wondering why I

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.810 
distinctly remember wondering why I
couldn't<00:01:30.750> find<00:01:30.960> a<00:01:31.080> Caterpie<00:01:31.590> again<00:01:32.370> the

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
couldn't find a Caterpie again the

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.060 
couldn't find a Caterpie again the
show's<00:01:33.090> influence<00:01:33.840> was<00:01:34.079> quite<00:01:34.320> strong<00:01:34.649> on<00:01:34.920> me

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070

I<00:01:35.250> did<00:01:35.520> eventually<00:01:35.670> but<00:01:36.329> I<00:01:36.450> remember<00:01:36.930> it<00:01:37.049> being

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
I did eventually but I remember it being

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.740 
I did eventually but I remember it being
really<00:01:37.770> hard<00:01:38.100> and<00:01:38.490> thinking<00:01:38.969> it<00:01:39.360> didn't<00:01:39.659> make

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
really hard and thinking it didn't make

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.450 
really hard and thinking it didn't make
sense<00:01:39.810> why<00:01:40.229> they<00:01:40.380> would<00:01:40.530> hide<00:01:40.740> such<00:01:41.070> a<00:01:41.100> cool

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460
