process<00:00:11.070> to<00:00:11.550> a<00:00:11.580> gorilla<00:00:11.820> surrogate<00:00:12.570> we<00:00:12.870> have<00:00:13.019> a

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:13.190 
process to a gorilla surrogate we have a

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:15.680 
process to a gorilla surrogate we have a
quite<00:00:14.190> a<00:00:14.219> few<00:00:14.519> different<00:00:14.940> components<00:00:15.059> that

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
quite a few different components that

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.269 
quite a few different components that
all<00:00:15.750> eventually<00:00:16.350> have<00:00:16.529> to<00:00:16.560> kind<00:00:16.920> of<00:00:17.010> merge

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
all eventually have to kind of merge

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.900 
all eventually have to kind of merge
together<00:00:17.670> and<00:00:18.270> one<00:00:18.779> of<00:00:18.900> those<00:00:19.050> is<00:00:19.350> to<00:00:20.130> Train

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
together and one of those is to Train

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.480 
together and one of those is to Train
one<00:00:21.779> of<00:00:21.900> her<00:00:22.020> potential<00:00:22.410> gorilla<00:00:22.920> surrogates

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
one of her potential gorilla surrogates

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.570 
one of her potential gorilla surrogates
to<00:00:24.150> ignore<00:00:24.660> a<00:00:24.990> baby<00:00:25.289> bottle<00:00:25.590> when<00:00:26.160> we<00:00:26.310> present

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
to ignore a baby bottle when we present

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.450 
to ignore a baby bottle when we present
it<00:00:26.910> to<00:00:27.510> her<00:00:27.869> through<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:28.949> front<00:00:29.220> of<00:00:29.400> the

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
it to her through the front of the

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.569 
it to her through the front of the
bedroom<00:00:29.910> area<00:00:30.349> and<00:00:31.349> that<00:00:31.560> seems<00:00:31.949> kinda<00:00:32.520> like

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
bedroom area and that seems kinda like

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.490 
bedroom area and that seems kinda like
it<00:00:32.759> would<00:00:32.850> be<00:00:32.880> hard<00:00:33.180> to<00:00:33.420> do<00:00:33.570> it<00:00:33.780> and<00:00:34.230> it<00:00:34.350> is

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
it would be hard to do it and it is

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.010 
it would be hard to do it and it is
because<00:00:34.950> gorillas<00:00:35.430> like<00:00:35.719> novelty<00:00:36.719> things

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
because gorillas like novelty things

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.470 
because gorillas like novelty things
gorillas<00:00:37.530> like<00:00:38.280> to<00:00:38.460> drink<00:00:38.730> milk<00:00:38.969> if<00:00:39.149> they<00:00:39.300> get

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
gorillas like to drink milk if they get

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.680 
gorillas like to drink milk if they get
the<00:00:39.629> opportunity<00:00:39.770> so<00:00:40.820> we<00:00:41.820> have<00:00:42.030> to<00:00:42.149> be<00:00:42.270> smart

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
the opportunity so we have to be smart

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.750 
the opportunity so we have to be smart
about<00:00:42.809> how<00:00:42.930> we<00:00:43.079> approach<00:00:43.590> this<00:00:43.829> so<00:00:44.129> step<00:00:44.489> one

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
about how we approach this so step one

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.490 
about how we approach this so step one
in<00:00:45.420> this<00:00:45.690> process<00:00:46.260> is<00:00:46.620> to<00:00:47.039> make<00:00:47.120> a<00:00:48.170> baby<00:00:49.170> bottle

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
in this process is to make a baby bottle

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.110 
in this process is to make a baby bottle
or<00:00:50.039> at<00:00:50.129> least<00:00:50.280> one<00:00:50.460> that<00:00:50.489> kind<00:00:50.789> of<00:00:50.850> looks<00:00:51.030> like

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
or at least one that kind of looks like

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.510 
or at least one that kind of looks like
one<00:00:51.420> this<00:00:51.570> isn't<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:52.320> same<00:00:52.530> formula<00:00:52.949> Gladys

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
one this isn't the same formula Gladys

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.810 
one this isn't the same formula Gladys
gets<00:00:53.760> it's<00:00:53.969> actually<00:00:54.360> just<00:00:54.600> milk<00:00:54.930> so<00:00:55.680> we<00:00:55.949> have

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
gets it's actually just milk so we have

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.340 
gets it's actually just milk so we have
a<00:00:56.850> bottle<00:00:57.300> and<00:00:57.390> I<00:00:57.480> could<00:00:57.660> just<00:00:57.870> start<00:00:58.109> with

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
a bottle and I could just start with

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.709 
a bottle and I could just start with
milk<00:00:58.620> and<00:00:58.800> trainer<00:00:59.100> to<00:00:59.340> ignore<00:00:59.670> it<00:00:59.820> but<00:01:00.359> we've

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
milk and trainer to ignore it but we've

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.869 
milk and trainer to ignore it but we've
taken<00:01:00.930> it<00:01:01.199> a<00:01:01.260> step<00:01:01.289> further<00:01:01.739> just<00:01:02.160> in<00:01:02.340> case<00:01:02.579> she

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
taken it a step further just in case she

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.750 
taken it a step further just in case she
decides<00:01:03.260> she<00:01:04.260> wants<00:01:04.290> to<00:01:04.799> get<00:01:05.100> in<00:01:05.250> there<00:01:05.519> and

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
decides she wants to get in there and

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.660 
decides she wants to get in there and
actually<00:01:06.360> take<00:01:06.630> a<00:01:06.810> taste<00:01:07.170> of<00:01:07.409> it<00:01:07.590> we're<00:01:08.340> making

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
actually take a taste of it we're making

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.140 
actually take a taste of it we're making
it<00:01:08.790> very<00:01:08.970> unpalatable<00:01:09.540> so<00:01:10.260> we<00:01:10.470> have<00:01:10.680> some

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:11.150 
it very unpalatable so we have some

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.870 
it very unpalatable so we have some
garlic<00:01:12.150> salt<00:01:12.630> and<00:01:13.189> we're<00:01:14.189> not<00:01:14.310> just<00:01:14.369> putting<00:01:14.760> a

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
garlic salt and we're not just putting a

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.710 
garlic salt and we're not just putting a
little<00:01:14.909> in<00:01:15.299> there<00:01:15.509> we're<00:01:15.659> gonna<00:01:15.860> really<00:01:17.720> make

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
little in there we're gonna really make

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.570 
little in there we're gonna really make
it<00:01:18.750> bad<00:01:19.680> tasting

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
it bad tasting

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.480 
it bad tasting
if<00:01:21.509> melenz<00:01:22.229> ii<00:01:22.409> who<00:01:22.650> is<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:22.979> gorilla<00:01:23.310> were

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
if melenz ii who is the gorilla were

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.340 
if melenz ii who is the gorilla were
going<00:01:23.759> to<00:01:23.880> be<00:01:24.000> training<00:01:24.330> decides<00:01:25.020> she<00:01:25.320> wants

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
time we've announced this but

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.020 
time we've announced this but
Malindi<00:01:57.149> is<00:01:58.110> probably<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:58.950> frontrunner<00:01:59.520> to

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
Malindi is probably the frontrunner to

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.899 
Malindi is probably the frontrunner to
be<00:02:00.180> Gladys's<00:02:00.780> surrogate<00:02:01.350> that<00:02:01.710> lets<00:02:02.369> Malindi

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
be Gladys's surrogate that lets Malindi

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.080 
be Gladys's surrogate that lets Malindi
know<00:02:03.060> whatever<00:02:03.270> it<00:02:03.540> is<00:02:04.280> she<00:02:05.280> just<00:02:05.520> did<00:02:05.790> is

know whatever it is she just did is

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.320 
know whatever it is she just did is
going<00:02:06.840> to<00:02:06.960> be<00:02:07.079> followed<00:02:07.530> by<00:02:07.560> a<00:02:07.789> reinforcer<00:02:08.789> in

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
going to be followed by a reinforcer in

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.580 
going to be followed by a reinforcer in
this<00:02:09.599> case<00:02:09.899> some<00:02:10.709> fruit

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
this case some fruit

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:17.460 
this case some fruit
she<00:02:11.980> is<00:02:15.239> at<00:02:16.239> this<00:02:16.450> point<00:02:16.750> we<00:02:16.900> really<00:02:17.170> do<00:02:17.290> need

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
she is at this point we really do need
