time which is extremely fast one thing

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:48.950 
time which is extremely fast one thing

this mouse it was a big surprise for me
on<00:00:51.030> how<00:00:51.059> fast<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.930> mouse<00:00:52.110> can<00:00:52.350> move<00:00:52.530> to

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
on how fast the mouse can move to

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.360 
on how fast the mouse can move to
compare<00:00:53.129> to<00:00:53.280> other<00:00:53.399> Mouse's<00:00:53.879> so<00:00:54.780> if<00:00:55.320> this<00:00:56.160> is

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
compare to other Mouse's so if this is

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.979 
compare to other Mouse's so if this is

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
it is very sensitive so you might want

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.099 
it is very sensitive so you might want
to<00:00:59.879> double<00:01:00.149> it<00:01:00.210> down<00:01:00.359> a<00:01:00.390> little<00:01:00.660> bit<00:01:00.870> I

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
to double it down a little bit I

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.200 
to double it down a little bit I
personally<00:01:01.920> do<00:01:02.039> not<00:01:02.070> adjusted<00:01:02.820> to<00:01:02.910> it<00:01:02.940> pretty

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
personally do not adjusted to it pretty

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.810 
personally do not adjusted to it pretty
fast<00:01:03.510> in<00:01:03.840> now<00:01:04.379> I<00:01:04.769> play<00:01:05.280> most<00:01:05.549> of<00:01:05.670> my<00:01:05.760> games

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
fast in now I play most of my games

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.550 
fast in now I play most of my games
without<00:01:06.180> moving<00:01:06.900> within<00:01:07.590> a<00:01:07.920> few<00:01:08.130> inches<00:01:09.560> the

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
without moving within a few inches the

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.190 
without moving within a few inches the
next<00:01:10.830> thing<00:01:11.010> is<00:01:11.280> that<00:01:11.939> it<00:01:12.090> has<00:01:12.270> 12<00:01:12.780> side

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
next thing is that it has 12 side

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.350 
next thing is that it has 12 side
buttons<00:01:13.590> that's<00:01:13.890> why<00:01:14.100> they<00:01:14.820> say<00:01:15.030> it's<00:01:15.210> for

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
buttons that's why they say it's for

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.380 
buttons that's why they say it's for
mmos<00:01:15.869> I<00:01:16.200> have<00:01:16.470> played<00:01:16.799> World<00:01:17.729> of<00:01:17.850> Warcraft<00:01:18.240> and

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
mmos I have played World of Warcraft and

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.870 
mmos I have played World of Warcraft and
Starcraft<00:01:18.570> with<00:01:19.290> this<00:01:19.439> mouse<00:01:19.650> and<00:01:19.950> I<00:01:20.100> think<00:01:20.729> it

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
Starcraft with this mouse and I think it

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.539 
Starcraft with this mouse and I think it
handles<00:01:21.299> very<00:01:21.390> well<00:01:21.780> especially<00:01:22.500> with<00:01:23.009> MMOs

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
handles very well especially with MMOs

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.760 
handles very well especially with MMOs
and<00:01:23.850> all<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.570> different<00:01:24.869> hotkeys<00:01:25.200> you<00:01:25.380> get<00:01:25.650> to

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
and all the different hotkeys you get to

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.740 
and all the different hotkeys you get to
have<00:01:25.920> you<00:01:26.580> can<00:01:26.759> also<00:01:26.909> hold<00:01:27.210> keys<00:01:27.450> on<00:01:27.659> your

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
have you can also hold keys on your

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.480 
have you can also hold keys on your
keyboard<00:01:27.810> and<00:01:28.229> press<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.740> keys<00:01:29.009> and<00:01:29.220> I'll<00:01:29.340> act

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
keyboard and press the keys and I'll act

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:30.950 
keyboard and press the keys and I'll act
just<00:01:29.790> like<00:01:29.850> how<00:01:30.270> it<00:01:30.329> would<00:01:30.509> on<00:01:30.630> your<00:01:30.780> keyboard

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
just like how it would on your keyboard

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.940 
just like how it would on your keyboard
so<00:01:31.740> it's<00:01:31.890> very<00:01:32.130> convenient<00:01:32.960> the<00:01:33.960> first<00:01:34.290> couple

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
so it's very convenient the first couple

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.929 
so it's very convenient the first couple
rows<00:01:35.159> are<00:01:35.610> very<00:01:36.360> accessible<00:01:36.930> 1<00:01:37.259> through<00:01:37.530> 6

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:37.939 
rows are very accessible 1 through 6

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:40.609 
rows are very accessible 1 through 6
once<00:01:38.939> you<00:01:39.060> get<00:01:39.240> down<00:01:39.420> to<00:01:39.780> seven<00:01:40.439> eight<00:01:40.590> nine

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
once you get down to seven eight nine

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.490 
once you get down to seven eight nine
and<00:01:41.189> 10<00:01:41.880> 11<00:01:42.210> 12<00:01:42.390> it<00:01:42.600> gets<00:01:42.930> kind<00:01:43.170> of<00:01:43.290> hard

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
and 10 11 12 it gets kind of hard

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.200 
and 10 11 12 it gets kind of hard
especially<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.399> last<00:01:44.610> row<00:01:44.880> it's<00:01:45.030> nearly

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
especially the last row it's nearly

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.210 
especially the last row it's nearly
impossible<00:01:45.560> and<00:01:46.560> you<00:01:46.649> pretty<00:01:46.799> much<00:01:46.890> have<00:01:47.189> to

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
impossible and you pretty much have to

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.310 
impossible and you pretty much have to
shift<00:01:47.520> your<00:01:47.640> whole<00:01:47.939> you<00:01:48.750> know<00:01:48.899> you're<00:01:49.200> going

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
shift your whole you know you're going

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.870 
shift your whole you know you're going
to<00:01:49.380> when<00:01:49.649> you're<00:01:49.799> going<00:01:50.220> to<00:01:50.280> be<00:01:50.369> using<00:01:50.549> this

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
to when you're going to be using this

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.270 
to when you're going to be using this
you<00:01:51.090> already<00:01:51.450> shift<00:01:51.899> your<00:01:52.079> hand<00:01:52.380> from<00:01:52.799> here<00:01:53.040> to

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
you already shift your hand from here to

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.700 
you already shift your hand from here to
here<00:01:53.610> to<00:01:54.270> use<00:01:54.420> these<00:01:54.600> new<00:01:54.810> buttons<00:01:55.200> you<00:01:55.530> get

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
here to use these new buttons you get

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.709 
here to use these new buttons you get
used<00:01:55.890> to<00:01:56.009> that<00:01:56.159> and<00:01:56.340> it<00:01:56.430> feels<00:01:56.640> great<00:01:56.909> because

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
used to that and it feels great because

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.109 
used to that and it feels great because
the<00:01:57.930> mouse<00:01:58.110> is<00:01:58.140> curved<00:01:58.619> really<00:01:58.979> well<00:01:59.130> but<00:01:59.369> it's

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
the mouse is curved really well but it's

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.929 
the mouse is curved really well but it's
really<00:02:00.420> hard<00:02:00.750> to<00:02:00.899> reach<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.229> last<00:02:01.439> two<00:02:01.729> and<00:02:02.729> it

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
really hard to reach the last two and it

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.399 
really hard to reach the last two and it
takes<00:02:03.149> a<00:02:03.270> little<00:02:03.390> bit<00:02:03.540> getting<00:02:03.750> used<00:02:03.869> to<00:02:04.229> to

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
takes a little bit getting used to to

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.109 
takes a little bit getting used to to
memorize<00:02:04.710> where<00:02:04.890> all<00:02:04.979> the<00:02:05.100> keys<00:02:05.310> are<00:02:05.520> they

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
memorize where all the keys are they

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.119 
memorize where all the keys are they
come<00:02:06.329> with<00:02:06.450> little<00:02:06.689> jell<00:02:06.930> pads<00:02:06.960> so<00:02:07.890> you<00:02:07.979> can

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
come with little jell pads so you can

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:09.529 
come with little jell pads so you can
put<00:02:08.280> them<00:02:08.429> on<00:02:08.580> keys<00:02:08.819> to<00:02:09.060> remember<00:02:09.390> where

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
put them on keys to remember where

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:10.790 
put them on keys to remember where
certain<00:02:09.720> ones<00:02:09.989> are<00:02:10.200> I<00:02:10.410> have
