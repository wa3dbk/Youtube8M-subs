possible<00:00:29.699> this<00:00:30.390> is<00:00:30.630> where<00:00:30.840> I<00:00:30.869> come<00:00:31.170> in<00:00:31.230> because

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
possible this is where I come in because

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.990

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
and I think that this is revolutionary

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.119 
and I think that this is revolutionary
in<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.880> fact<00:00:36.120> that<00:00:36.239> this<00:00:36.660> will<00:00:36.899> help<00:00:37.140> so<00:00:37.829> many

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
in the fact that this will help so many

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.850 
in the fact that this will help so many
channels<00:00:38.520> to<00:00:38.910> grow<00:00:39.149> as<00:00:39.390> well<00:00:40.079> as<00:00:40.230> mine<00:00:40.469> so<00:00:40.710> it's

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
channels to grow as well as mine so it's

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.340 
channels to grow as well as mine so it's
a<00:00:40.980> win-win<00:00:41.250> situation<00:00:41.579> for<00:00:42.420> absolutely

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350
