lines until it's nice and smooth and

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.209 
lines until it's nice and smooth and
then<00:00:57.989> if<00:00:58.199> you<00:00:58.350> feel<00:00:58.590> like<00:00:58.620> you<00:00:58.829> want<00:00:59.010> to<00:00:59.100> add

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
then if you feel like you want to add

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.729 
then if you feel like you want to add
more<00:00:59.640> shadow<00:01:00.030> you<00:01:00.210> can<00:01:00.600> do<00:01:00.750> that<00:01:00.930> but<00:01:01.530> make

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
more shadow you can do that but make

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:07.980 
more shadow you can do that but make
sure<00:01:01.770> that<00:01:01.920> you<00:01:02.190> blend<00:01:02.370> it<00:01:02.609> first

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:07.990 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.870 

so<00:01:08.990> here<00:01:09.229> I'm<00:01:09.320> just<00:01:09.590> adding<00:01:09.799> more<00:01:10.130> products

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 
so here I'm just adding more products

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.969 
so here I'm just adding more products
and<00:01:11.119> I'm<00:01:11.240> also<00:01:11.450> holding<00:01:11.869> the<00:01:12.110> brush<00:01:12.320> downward

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
and I'm also holding the brush downward

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:14.920 
and I'm also holding the brush downward
because<00:01:13.460> when<00:01:13.670> you<00:01:13.790> do<00:01:14.030> that<00:01:14.270> it<00:01:14.540> actually

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:14.930 
because when you do that it actually

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.680 
because when you do that it actually
blends<00:01:15.619> it<00:01:15.830> for<00:01:16.130> you<00:01:16.369> and<00:01:16.670> it<00:01:17.030> gives<00:01:17.270> it<00:01:17.420> a<00:01:17.540> nice

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:17.690 
blends it for you and it gives it a nice

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.920 
blends it for you and it gives it a nice
of<00:01:17.930> fading<00:01:18.350> effect<00:01:18.470> and<00:01:19.340> I<00:01:20.090> using<00:01:20.450> this<00:01:20.570> deep

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:20.930 
of fading effect and I using this deep

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.620 
of fading effect and I using this deep
brown<00:01:21.200> color<00:01:21.590> I'm<00:01:21.950> going<00:01:22.220> to<00:01:22.340> use<00:01:23.090> this<00:01:23.299> in<00:01:23.509> the

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
brown color I'm going to use this in the

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.359 
brown color I'm going to use this in the
crease<00:01:23.900> and<00:01:24.229> I'm<00:01:24.350> going<00:01:24.590> to<00:01:24.619> apply<00:01:24.950> it<00:01:25.070> with

makeup<00:01:27.680> addiction<00:01:28.460> and<00:01:28.700> I'm<00:01:29.540> obsessed<00:01:29.750> with

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:30.259 
makeup addiction and I'm obsessed with

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:32.350 
makeup addiction and I'm obsessed with
these<00:01:30.380> brushes<00:01:30.680> because<00:01:31.130> they<00:01:31.490> blend<00:01:31.850> so<00:01:32.119> well

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
these brushes because they blend so well

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.660 
these brushes because they blend so well
and<00:01:32.810> the<00:01:33.619> only<00:01:33.710> thing<00:01:33.860> is<00:01:34.070> that<00:01:34.250> they're<00:01:34.640> a

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
and the only thing is that they're a

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.030 
and the only thing is that they're a
little<00:01:34.940> pricey<00:01:35.060> but<00:01:35.750> it's<00:01:36.140> definitely<00:01:36.500> worth

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040 
little pricey but it's definitely worth

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.029 
little pricey but it's definitely worth
it<00:01:37.250> because<00:01:37.490> they<00:01:38.360> blend<00:01:38.750> the<00:01:38.960> eyeshadows<00:01:39.530> so

00:01:40.029 --> 00:01:40.039 
it because they blend the eyeshadows so

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:42.999 
it because they blend the eyeshadows so
perfectly<00:01:40.610> and<00:01:41.140> next<00:01:42.140> for<00:01:42.320> the<00:01:42.350> lid<00:01:42.590> I'm<00:01:42.830> going

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:43.009
