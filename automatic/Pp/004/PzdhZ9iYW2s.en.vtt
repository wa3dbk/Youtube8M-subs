00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:18.330
 viva carlos sine viewers and well 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:21.000
 Welcome to another video collaboration of 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:22.769
 power new commander in this video let's go 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.279
 to talk about the email that the email and email 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:28.650
 about the identity of the mobile phone 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:32.700
 for example when we make a 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:35.430
 call is network knows that you have voice 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.050
 image and recorded the siemens you 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:41.850
 access to the net and so but is also 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:45.660
 be provided if you see what 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.039
 they do not have access to these 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.989
 possibility to make a call 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.460
 and sometimes you even have a high 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.930
 and does not realize what it is that 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.760
 this happens sometimes goes to the mark 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.300
 and this is always another hypothesis for 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.250
 You'll see if everything's all right. 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.660
 before sending it to the brand or 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.219
 to execute the possibilities all 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.320
 not to stay for several days without 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.210
 mobile phone and simplify your sister is 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.010
 properly installed 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:12.530
 How can you see the e-mail? 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:14.880
 make on the scoreboard at 3 cardinal 06 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.310
 cardinal and you make a call sign 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.369
 and I will not put a picture here because 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:23.700
 for questions to the more curious because 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.860
 nor make jokes back and 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.080
 How do you make a copy of 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.850
 Safety from among a way that 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.759
 this happens, something you can 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:35.549
 ratify this directory that are 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.110
 directory to return to normality 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:41.820
 so that's how you voted for a program 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:44.399
 called explorer route to do is copy 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.250
 let you feel the same even this 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:49.229
 program and of course need to have the broken 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.670
 made the voice of her death can not 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.560
 copy this directory 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:56.280
 so this is how you see the web the folder 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.740
 ruth roth mean the phone to kings 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.899
 the phone and then you go and look for 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.149
 this directory here eff sa 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:05.909
 and you copy the directory do here 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.439
 more copy then I ask for 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.970
 Where do we want to copy? 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.979
 but because of 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.629
 Security for you to do the to cope 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.140

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:15.990
 passes away 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.550
 and then here is create a directory has 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:22.350
 for example have the director called 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:26.490

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:29.880

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:31.680

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.200

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:44.720
 of the year is just to be sure that before 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.980
 to ship with the factory 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:51.150
 made use of all the possibilities that 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:51.989
 could do to avoid this 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.670
 situation 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:55.980
