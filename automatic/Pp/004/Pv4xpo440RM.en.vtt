00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.779
 video for you beauty everything 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.179
 rest assured you are also very welcome 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:24.980
 to another video here on the channel and today 

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:26.720
 an information video from your school 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.789
 It's not been a long time since we've spoken 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:32.300
 make a video the different information 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:34.280
 rumors or quotes, and today is a 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.540
 video to talk about the rumor is a rumor 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.340
 What happened there? 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.770
 after the hymns of the mini show that I do 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:42.260
 part of the team is also they found 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:45.440
 in the internal files of these four 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:48.260
 references some online features of the 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.180
 game the sims 4 right is none of that was 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.200
 confirmed worth remembering that already in 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.750
 I start that none of this has been confirmed 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:55.760
 none of that can be that can materialize 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.560
 then but it can be as it does not materialize 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.790
 we have to stay smart is that 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.170
 rumor business 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.420
 so I'll start talking 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:05.089
 first on a post that is so 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:07.130
 simple br did it right and many people already 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:08.570
 confirmed this also decides school 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.520
 it was supposed to be a totally online game 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.690
 beauty is the producers were 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.909
 planning it to be fully 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:15.950
 online with dedicated servers and everything 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:18.530
 more how simcity works and why 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:21.229
 that we make the sims and 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:24.080
 we players can go home from 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:26.240
 other teams and visit friends and so 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.550
 play better this month 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.620
 four would be 2004 multiplayer 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:32.330
 was a totally online game that the 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:34.940
 people used the resources online and everything 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:37.940
 more and ended up with more or less in 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:40.490
 2010 they took this idea of ​​making a 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:43.070
 online to play offline 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.560
 because not only because Sin City has 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.240
 the servers there broken more and by 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.340
 some mistakes I was also making and they 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:52.220
 realized that not beauty let's do the 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:54.530
 game is offline even we make 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.390
 they 4 are offline you do not need 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.960
 internet to play these bullshit 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.689
 all 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.220
 Let's do it the way I've always been and 

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:03.320
 there they decided to make this school of 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.510
 way people are used to seeing 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.200
 during those newscasts there that is the 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:10.020
 fate of the four 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.550
 can play offline if you're not online 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.200
 You will not play on the internet this month. 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.980
 four knows if you are connected to the 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.140
 Internet 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.930
 You're going to see the gallery and everything. 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:22.019
 more and also have these other resources 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.010
 who were there, which is the dream of the 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:25.290
 mini show 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:28.650
 among the features they found in 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:30.720
 files is that we will have batting window 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.970
 chat room including waiting room 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.810
 so he can even create cross and everything 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.970
 but no 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.980
 updates are being downloaded in the 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.989
 while we play and then 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.630
 When it's over, we'll go. 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:45.090
 there and return and restart the game neither to 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.500
 it is updated but I update it 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.390
 You will not need to leave the game for you. 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.420
 do the update and it will announce 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:53.730
 when you are receiving the 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:56.010
 update and will also talk when 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.530
 What are you going to need to do? 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.790
 update and also during our 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.709
 online gambling 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.170
 we will receive information and 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:06.569
 messages that the server may be in 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.670
 maintenance and everything else in the 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:11.489
 codes you are seeing the image is 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:13.739
 all of them sea ​​with a code and what the 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:16.319
 code is to do what it will show up 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:19.350
 The people on the screen are disconnected. 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:21.720
 connected stay there these things because it is 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:23.400
 it may mean that we have 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.380
 online resources of the sims 4 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:28.500
 Now what does this have to do with what I 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:30.150
 I told in the beginning is about the deviation school 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.769
 is being produced. 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.810
 produced online 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:35.850
 happens that the glass eel anthems not 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:38.220
 you can say that you will be in the game for 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:40.350
 fact that they find this remnants 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.299
 online game online 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:44.010
 is doing parades, right? 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:47.220
 that's how it was found in archives 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:49.049
 is internal it may be that this is in the game 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:52.170
 how can it be that can not be confirmed 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:54.359
 that might be that it has air come 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:56.959
 happening is that one of these four does not 

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:59.670
 he does not have these codes because he has been 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:01.319
 formerly thought of as a mode 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:03.569
 multiplayer but then they have 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:06.120
 gave up and ended up leaving that 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:08.940
 open folder without wanting to be there 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:11.849
 so we do not have much to stay 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:15.020
 Thinking a lot of time, our time will come. 

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:17.540
 so you already found this in the file and such 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:19.640
 where we stand there with this thing of 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:22.070
 Left foot is not even half 

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:24.350
 thoughtful as it may be that you have a 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:26.810
 multiplayer mode has shown there 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:27.530
 as the chat window of the most like 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:29.330
 maybe not 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:32.060
 the multiplayer mode I say between 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:33.770
 would not be an online resource even 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:35.810
 Not that we are going to visit the house of 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.130
 I feel more but we can 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:40.580
 chat with our friends while 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:42.080
 plays power to make updates and so is 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:43.070
 that even as they are showing the 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.470
 files ne 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:48.350
 this may be the remnant things 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:50.210
 left over from the sims 4 online they 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:52.550
 were doing previously and that 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:54.350
 stayed there might not come to 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:56.780
 to materialize with the finalized 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:58.610
 the final version of the sims quota né mas 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:00.680
 how can it happen then it goes 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:03.770
 even needing confirmation is your 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:05.450
 front or as many producers do not 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:07.460
 we are still believing that 

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:10.190
 many a lot of surprises are coming 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:11.780
 with the 2004 base, we may not have 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:13.130
 so much information about the game because 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:15.350
 they want to make surprise they want 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:17.420
 Let's open the game, let's face it. 

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:19.550
 that old was not believing then 

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:21.500
 is to have many things still that people 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:22.370
 need to see when the game is released and 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.860
 that we will not have information 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:26.570
 so I'll always keep an eye on you 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:28.970
 that has any information some humor 

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:30.800
 about this online resource some 

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:32.270
 producers comment on the case 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:34.010
 Of course I would bring it here for you and 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:36.710
 if it is implemented or not 

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:38.780
 beauty then in the cases of 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:40.070
 the range of favorites wants to enjoy the 

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:41.420
 top page of the mini shopping mall in 

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:43.580
 description of the video also because they 

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:46.370
 they think a part of it is wrong 

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:47.630
 even crazy students top even uncle then 

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:50.240
 I commented on the comments that you 

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:51.770
 They found decide these online resources right 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:54.440
 several things you can comment on 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:55.850
 beauty is we just want to comment on the sly 

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:58.910
 I do not want to see flash, I'm not kidding. 

00:05:55.850 --> 00:06:00.650
 It can put strong but only one comes 

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:02.150
 It's over , you have not got a 

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:04.720
 but it 's not us 

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:04.720
 went
