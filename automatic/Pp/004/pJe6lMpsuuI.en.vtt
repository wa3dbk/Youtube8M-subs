00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.200 
and it was a heart neetu for her and but
at<00:00:37.620> a<00:00:37.710> certain<00:00:37.920> point<00:00:38.070> I<00:00:38.399> believe<00:00:38.579> I<00:00:38.910> was<00:00:39.059> also

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
at a certain point I believe I was also

Ning<00:00:39.510> around<00:00:39.809> on<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.200> head<00:00:40.379> on<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.620> ground<00:00:40.710> I

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
Ning around on the head on the ground I

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.770 
Ning around on the head on the ground I
thought<00:00:41.250> that<00:00:41.489> referee<00:00:41.940> would<00:00:42.149> stop<00:00:42.390> hit<00:00:42.600> but

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
thought that referee would stop hit but

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.930 
thought that referee would stop hit but
he<00:00:42.870> didn't<00:00:43.170> that<00:00:43.260> she<00:00:43.440> kept<00:00:43.800> him<00:00:43.980> going<00:00:44.160> in<00:00:44.579> and

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
he didn't that she kept him going in and

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.680 
he didn't that she kept him going in and
i<00:00:45.600> ended<00:00:45.840> up<00:00:45.960> again<00:00:46.260> in<00:00:46.410> armor<00:00:47.570> there<00:00:48.570> was<00:00:48.660> a

think<00:05:12.620> the<00:05:12.860> UFC<00:05:13.219> I<00:05:13.580> don't<00:05:14.150> think<00:05:14.210> she<00:05:14.419> knows

00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:14.539 
think the UFC I don't think she knows

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:15.879 
think the UFC I don't think she knows
because<00:05:14.750> it<00:05:14.990> will<00:05:15.110> give<00:05:15.139> her<00:05:15.349> a<00:05:15.379> girl<00:05:15.560> she<00:05:15.770> can

00:05:15.879 --> 00:05:15.889 
because it will give her a girl she can

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:18.610 
because it will give her a girl she can
be<00:05:16.069> and<00:05:16.969> she<00:05:17.210> will<00:05:17.330> never<00:05:17.449> go<00:05:17.719> early<00:05:18.319> she<00:05:18.439> gets

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:18.620 
be and she will never go early she gets

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:20.980 
be and she will never go early she gets
too<00:05:18.800> fat<00:05:19.009> but<00:05:19.279> otherwise<00:05:19.789> it<00:05:20.060> I<00:05:20.479> don't<00:05:20.839> think

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:20.990 
too fat but otherwise it I don't think

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:22.809 
too fat but otherwise it I don't think
she<00:05:21.080> wants<00:05:21.199> to<00:05:21.349> face<00:05:21.589> meet<00:05:21.860> 145<00:05:22.490> and<00:05:22.699> she
