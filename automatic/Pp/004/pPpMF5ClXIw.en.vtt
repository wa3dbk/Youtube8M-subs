 million people worldwide and the team 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.560
 all and went to check the 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.320
 work of the great stars of

 in 1968 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:08.630
 we are equal sometimes failure in the wheel that 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:08.630

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.610
 ae 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.430
 I knew this musical via Brazil 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:26.220
 I stayed 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:29.020
 was quoted in the possibility of doing so 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:32.380
 I felt prepared for this 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:34.540
 the thrill is very great that it was a movie 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:37.870
 such as adolescence 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:39.670
 I think not only my most 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:42.869
 Brazilians 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.869
 so many people around the world 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.960
 I say I'm fulfilling a dream. 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.960
 like this 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:59.300
 As soon as you got the kiss, I'll be right back. 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.610
 I visualized everything I did very well 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:06.160
 addressed to this profession is drug then 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:06.160
 came the directors claudio 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.250
 already has a format is not is we have 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.530
 that conform to this format but to the 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.180
 at the same time they gave a lot of 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:19.120
 People put on souza 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:21.310
 It's the Brazilian inside the room. I stayed. 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:25.599
 very happy in this process 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:28.239
 dakar in Africa and more mature and 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:31.599
 I discovered the comedy team a little 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:33.730
 control of the audience if the river 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:35.680
 we have one of loures that is 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.639
 considered one of the best 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.889
 they appeared 

00:02:36.639 --> 00:02:43.420
 so we put amounts that is the villain 

00:02:38.889 --> 00:02:46.480
 also held 16 07 which was one of the 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:49.180
 better choices they have had in 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.609
 all messages 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:55.620
 The protocol is with them. 

00:02:51.609 --> 00:03:01.200
 they were prioritized i do karting 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:01.200
 Because I know he's a boyfriend of roriz. 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.590
 i will chase for musical lourenco 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.780
 whole was yellow green that 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.970
 happens to the song I sing to a 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:14.350
 incredible that I am accompanied by the 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:17.650
 your henchmen and it 's cool I think this is 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:19.450
 in this case who has stressed that the 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:22.210
 music proposes the joke that he who 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:26.220
 has singing as if it were a song of 

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:26.220
 love that will end her 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:52.100
 if I find 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:54.890
 the turkey is not funny and curious you 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:57.800
 assists nuns who are human beings 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:59.720
 inmates and and liabilities right in your in 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:01.940
 popular imaginary 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:04.460
 And then you see these times turning 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:06.670
 and dancing on the stage singing I'm ozzy 

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:08.450
 very funny and fun police 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:10.850
 very greek 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:13.460
 I think both the movie and the music 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:14.900
 that carry this song I'm evil 

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:17.810
 immense quality 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:21.550
 it makes these products 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:25.010
 Reach success is a hot challenge. 

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:28.930
 having the work is the end of the season with 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:32.240

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:35.220
 I know how to change and half is not and I gave it to you 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:39.390
 for him but at the same time 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:41.370
 I think smoking or doing below me 

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:43.590
 I'm playing to avoid the collapse. 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:48.020
 small details that make the difference 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:51.879
