many many years ago and my brother and I
were<00:02:11.989> back<00:02:12.989> here

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
were back here

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.059 
were back here
in<00:02:14.099> the<00:02:14.220> lineup<00:02:15.409> looking<00:02:16.409> at<00:02:16.500> different<00:02:16.830> stuff

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
in the lineup looking at different stuff

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.369 
in the lineup looking at different stuff
that<00:02:17.099> we<00:02:17.340> had<00:02:17.519> and<00:02:17.730> he<00:02:18.450> says<00:02:18.720> well<00:02:18.900> hey<00:02:19.019> I<00:02:19.049> want

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:19.379 
that we had and he says well hey I want

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:21.830 
that we had and he says well hey I want
to<00:02:19.440> get<00:02:19.560> the<00:02:19.680> John<00:02:19.890> Deere<00:02:20.129> running<00:02:20.489> and<00:02:21.390> so<00:02:21.720> it

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
to get the John Deere running and so it

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.720 
to get the John Deere running and so it
seemed<00:02:22.080> like<00:02:22.290> a<00:02:22.319> good<00:02:22.530> idea<00:02:22.709> and<00:02:22.980> we<00:02:23.190> spent<00:02:23.489> I

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
seemed like a good idea and we spent I

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.320 
seemed like a good idea and we spent I
suppose<00:02:24.650> four<00:02:25.650> or<00:02:25.709> five<00:02:25.830> days<00:02:26.159> beyond<00:02:26.700> doing

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
suppose four or five days beyond doing

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:28.850 
suppose four or five days beyond doing
chores<00:02:27.720> and<00:02:27.989> everything<00:02:28.080> else<00:02:28.470> that<00:02:28.620> we<00:02:28.739> do

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
chores and everything else that we do

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.490 
chores and everything else that we do
around<00:02:29.069> here<00:02:29.420> just<00:02:30.420> turn<00:02:30.629> it<00:02:30.840> down<00:02:30.870> the<00:02:31.290> gas

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
around here just turn it down the gas

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.800 
around here just turn it down the gas
was<00:02:31.830> just<00:02:32.040> rottenness<00:02:32.700> just<00:02:33.239> just<00:02:33.569> the<00:02:33.660> most

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
was just rottenness just just the most

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.080 
was just rottenness just just the most
rot<00:02:34.140> and<00:02:34.319> terrible<00:02:34.739> stuff<00:02:34.980> you'd<00:02:35.160> ever<00:02:35.310> ever

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
rot and terrible stuff you'd ever ever

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.800 
rot and terrible stuff you'd ever ever
come<00:02:36.390> across<00:02:36.510> and<00:02:38.120> so<00:02:39.120> we<00:02:39.209> cleaned<00:02:39.510> out<00:02:39.660> the

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
come across and so we cleaned out the

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.140 
come across and so we cleaned out the
carburetor<00:02:40.319> and<00:02:40.650> did<00:02:41.430> some<00:02:41.640> work<00:02:41.790> on<00:02:42.000> the

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
carburetor and did some work on the

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.979 
carburetor and did some work on the
magneto<00:02:42.629> and<00:02:42.989> it<00:02:44.239> more<00:02:45.239> or<00:02:45.329> less<00:02:45.450> fired<00:02:45.780> right

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:45.989 
magneto and it more or less fired right

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:47.509 
magneto and it more or less fired right
up<00:02:46.049> and<00:02:46.379> we<00:02:46.470> run<00:02:46.680> it<00:02:46.829> around<00:02:46.920> for<00:02:47.310> quite<00:02:47.459> a

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 
up and we run it around for quite a

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:48.020 
up and we run it around for quite a
while

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
while

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.229 
while
I<00:02:48.090> actually<00:02:48.780> ran<00:02:49.200> it<00:02:49.349> on<00:02:49.410> the<00:02:49.590> flat<00:02:49.829> tires<00:02:50.239> the

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
I actually ran it on the flat tires the

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:52.640 
I actually ran it on the flat tires the
other<00:02:51.390> problem<00:02:51.780> I<00:02:51.840> think<00:02:51.900> I'm<00:02:52.140> gonna<00:02:52.260> run<00:02:52.470> into

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
other problem I think I'm gonna run into

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.349 
other problem I think I'm gonna run into
here<00:02:53.160> is<00:02:53.310> that<00:02:53.489> these<00:02:54.000> tires<00:02:54.950> were<00:02:55.950> had<00:02:56.790> were

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:57.359 
here is that these tires were had were

00:02:57.359 --> 00:03:00.470 
here is that these tires were had were
had<00:02:57.930> the<00:02:58.079> chlorine<00:02:58.530> in<00:02:58.709> them<00:02:58.829> and<00:02:59.269> chlorine<00:03:00.269> is

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
had the chlorine in them and chlorine is

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:07.099 
had the chlorine in them and chlorine is
a<00:03:00.510> terribly<00:03:01.349> corrosive<00:03:02.099> stuff<00:03:03.319> so<00:03:04.319> I<00:03:05.030> I<00:03:06.109> kind

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:07.109 
a terribly corrosive stuff so I I kind

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:08.900 
a terribly corrosive stuff so I I kind
of<00:03:07.200> hoped<00:03:07.500> that<00:03:07.709> those<00:03:07.890> tires<00:03:08.190> will<00:03:08.489> hold<00:03:08.700> air

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
of hoped that those tires will hold air

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:10.970 
of hoped that those tires will hold air
but<00:03:09.269> when<00:03:09.690> I<00:03:09.720> get<00:03:09.930> some<00:03:10.109> new<00:03:10.260> ones<00:03:10.379> on<00:03:10.590> here<00:03:10.829> but

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
but when I get some new ones on here but

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.770 
but when I get some new ones on here but
I<00:03:11.010> just<00:03:11.280> I<00:03:11.549> can't<00:03:12.120> be<00:03:12.510> sure

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
I just I can't be sure

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.640 
I just I can't be sure
I<00:03:13.400> guess<00:03:14.400> we'll<00:03:14.670> we'll<00:03:15.390> find<00:03:15.660> out<00:03:15.930> when<00:03:16.560> it

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
I guess we'll we'll find out when it

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.900 
I guess we'll we'll find out when it
comes<00:03:16.799> to<00:03:17.040> that<00:03:17.190> point<00:03:18.290> but<00:03:19.290> we're<00:03:19.560> gonna<00:03:19.910> show

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
comes to that point but we're gonna show

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.870 
comes to that point but we're gonna show
you<00:03:20.970> how<00:03:21.150> to<00:03:21.209> crank<00:03:21.569> it<00:03:21.720> over<00:03:22.190> well<00:03:23.190> look<00:03:23.519> I<00:03:23.700> see

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
you how to crank it over well look I see

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.190 
you how to crank it over well look I see
this<00:03:24.000> is<00:03:24.150> one<00:03:24.269> of<00:03:24.359> the<00:03:24.419> obstacles<00:03:24.720> I'm<00:03:25.049> gonna

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
this is one of the obstacles I'm gonna

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.789 
this is one of the obstacles I'm gonna
have<00:03:25.319> to<00:03:25.440> cover<00:03:25.650> to<00:03:25.919> get<00:03:26.519> a<00:03:26.549> plug<00:03:27.090> wire<00:03:27.329> there

00:03:27.789 --> 00:03:27.799 
have to cover to get a plug wire there

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:30.979 
have to cover to get a plug wire there
but<00:03:28.799> see<00:03:28.980> these<00:03:29.190> tractors<00:03:29.700> have<00:03:29.910> petcocks<00:03:30.419> now

00:03:30.979 --> 00:03:30.989 
but see these tractors have petcocks now

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:34.940 
but see these tractors have petcocks now
this<00:03:31.139> tractor<00:03:33.260> can't<00:03:34.260> remember<00:03:34.470> I<00:03:34.560> think<00:03:34.859> it

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
this tractor can't remember I think it

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:38.629 
this tractor can't remember I think it
was<00:03:35.069> a<00:03:35.099> six<00:03:35.609> point<00:03:35.940> three<00:03:36.620> liter<00:03:37.620> engine<00:03:38.519> that

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:38.639 
was a six point three liter engine that

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:40.879 
was a six point three liter engine that
they<00:03:38.760> used<00:03:39.030> in<00:03:39.209> these<00:03:39.329> which<00:03:39.599> I<00:03:39.720> can't<00:03:39.989> say<00:03:40.769> it

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:40.889 
they used in these which I can't say it

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:45.470 
they used in these which I can't say it
must<00:03:41.069> have<00:03:41.160> been<00:03:41.250> about<00:03:41.340> 300<00:03:41.940> and<00:03:42.590> 390<00:03:43.590> or<00:03:44.480> 375

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
must have been about 300 and 390 or 375

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.220 
must have been about 300 and 390 or 375
cubic<00:03:45.930> inches<00:03:46.230> I<00:03:46.380> think<00:03:46.410> that's<00:03:46.769> that's<00:03:47.190> right

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
cubic inches I think that's that's right

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.520 
cubic inches I think that's that's right
but<00:03:49.230> just<00:03:49.709> a<00:03:49.799> twin<00:03:50.040> cylinder<00:03:50.569> but<00:03:51.569> four<00:03:52.260> point

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
but just a twin cylinder but four point

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.710 
but just a twin cylinder but four point
four<00:03:52.799> five<00:03:53.069> to<00:03:53.370> one<00:03:53.519> compression<00:03:53.940> which<00:03:54.510> is

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
four five to one compression which is

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.390 
four five to one compression which is
really<00:03:55.079> low<00:03:55.230> you<00:03:55.440> could<00:03:55.590> run<00:03:55.769> these<00:03:55.919> things<00:03:56.160> on

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
really low you could run these things on

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.990 
really low you could run these things on
dog<00:03:56.700> piss<00:03:57.030> if<00:03:57.209> you<00:03:57.299> wanted<00:03:57.599> to<00:03:58.639> anyway<00:03:59.639> so<00:03:59.700> you

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
dog piss if you wanted to anyway so you

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.699 
dog piss if you wanted to anyway so you
open<00:04:00.329> the<00:04:00.359> petcocks<00:04:02.959> and<00:04:03.959> the<00:04:04.139> other<00:04:04.260> one<00:04:04.530> on

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
open the petcocks and the other one on

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:07.250 
open the petcocks and the other one on
the<00:04:04.769> other<00:04:04.859> side<00:04:05.840> essentially<00:04:06.840> all<00:04:06.959> there<00:04:07.109> is

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
the other side essentially all there is

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.080 
the other side essentially all there is
to<00:04:07.470> it<00:04:07.590> you<00:04:07.620> know<00:04:07.889> you<00:04:07.980> got<00:04:08.250> a<00:04:08.280> you<00:04:08.609> get<00:04:08.730> a<00:04:08.760> choke

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
to it you know you got a you get a choke

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:13.039 
to it you know you got a you get a choke
here<00:04:09.590> see<00:04:10.590> you<00:04:10.709> choke<00:04:11.010> it<00:04:11.299> and<00:04:12.299> then<00:04:12.449> you<00:04:12.599> make

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:13.049 
here see you choke it and then you make

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:15.830 
here see you choke it and then you make
sure<00:04:13.230> your<00:04:13.440> fuel<00:04:13.650> was<00:04:13.949> turned<00:04:14.190> on<00:04:14.400> and<00:04:14.840> you

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
sure your fuel was turned on and you
