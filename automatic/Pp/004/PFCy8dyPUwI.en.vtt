00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
we became friends it was funny as the

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.200 
we became friends it was funny as the
hot<00:00:43.860> tub<00:00:44.040> went<00:00:44.160> through<00:00:44.280> my<00:00:44.460> mind<00:00:44.640> I'm<00:00:44.910> paying

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
hot tub went through my mind I'm paying

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.390 
hot tub went through my mind I'm paying
for<00:00:45.330> this<00:00:45.390> wave<00:00:45.600> I<00:00:45.900> there<00:00:46.680> was<00:00:46.769> assess<00:00:47.010> coming

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:47.400 
for this wave I there was assess coming

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.250 
for this wave I there was assess coming
and<00:00:47.640> it<00:00:47.879> was<00:00:48.000> like<00:00:48.150> the<00:00:48.269> first<00:00:48.449> real<00:00:48.690> tidal

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
and it was like the first real tidal

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.799 
and it was like the first real tidal
wave<00:00:49.470> of<00:00:49.559> that<00:00:49.710> set<00:00:49.949> and<00:00:50.489> I<00:00:50.879> battle<00:00:51.540> for<00:00:51.720> it

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
wave of that set and I battle for it

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.509 
wave of that set and I battle for it
because<00:00:52.229> I<00:00:52.350> flew<00:00:52.500> in<00:00:52.650> time<00:00:52.860> with<00:00:53.070> everybody

00:00:53.509 --> 00:00:53.519 
because I flew in time with everybody

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:55.130 
because I flew in time with everybody
else<00:00:53.699> let's<00:00:54.300> really<00:00:54.479> go<00:00:54.629> for<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:54.839> first<00:00:55.019> one

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
else let's really go for the first one

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.100 
else let's really go for the first one
cycle<00:00:56.010> necklace<00:00:56.370> and<00:00:56.670> then<00:00:57.600> I<00:00:57.720> often<00:00:58.050> I

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:58.110 
cycle necklace and then I often I

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:00.020 
cycle necklace and then I often I
noticed<00:00:58.379> market<00:00:58.769> timing<00:00:58.979> out<00:00:59.190> toward<00:00:59.670> me<00:00:59.850> and

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
noticed market timing out toward me and

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.030 
noticed market timing out toward me and
I'm<00:01:00.420> having<00:01:00.629> his<00:01:00.839> hardly<00:01:01.110> can<00:01:01.290> he's<00:01:01.470> on<00:01:01.620> I'm

deep and he's shallow with more on
shoulders<00:01:05.070> but<00:01:05.670> it's<00:01:05.820> typical<00:01:06.330> Mavericks

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
shoulders but it's typical Mavericks

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.660

items<00:01:07.080> just<00:01:07.200> sucked<00:01:07.500> out<00:01:07.620> the<00:01:07.770> jack<00:01:08.010> so<00:01:08.220> much<00:01:08.400> I

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
items just sucked out the jack so much I

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.930 
items just sucked out the jack so much I
had<00:01:09.060> all<00:01:09.240> colleague<00:01:09.659> speeds<00:01:09.930> and<00:01:10.860> there<00:01:11.729> goes

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:11.940 
had all colleague speeds and there goes

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:13.520 
had all colleague speeds and there goes
mark<00:01:12.150> he<00:01:12.299> turned<00:01:12.570> his<00:01:12.720> butt<00:01:12.960> to<00:01:13.110> me<00:01:13.229> and<00:01:13.409> he's

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
mark he turned his butt to me and he's

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.590 
mark he turned his butt to me and he's
having<00:01:13.950> to<00:01:14.070> that<00:01:14.220> way<00:01:14.370> rather<00:01:14.820> than<00:01:15.150> follow

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
having to that way rather than follow

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.390 
having to that way rather than follow
him<00:01:15.990> I<00:01:16.229> knew<00:01:16.470> there<00:01:16.620> were<00:01:16.680> more<00:01:16.860> waves<00:01:17.100> coming

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
him I knew there were more waves coming

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.679 
him I knew there were more waves coming
so<00:01:17.670> I<00:01:17.700> actually<00:01:17.850> pulled<00:01:18.210> back<00:01:18.360> and<00:01:18.509> if<00:01:18.600> you

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
so I actually pulled back and if you

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.330 
so I actually pulled back and if you
look<00:01:18.840> at<00:01:18.930> the<00:01:18.990> photos<00:01:19.259> well<00:01:19.500> I'm<00:01:20.159> actually

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
look at the photos well I'm actually

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.209 
look at the photos well I'm actually
pulling<00:01:21.149> back<00:01:21.600> I'm<00:01:22.200> not<00:01:22.409> missing<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.070> wave

00:01:23.209 --> 00:01:23.219 
pulling back I'm not missing the wave

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:24.740 
pulling back I'm not missing the wave
I'm<00:01:23.460> pulling<00:01:24.149> the<00:01:24.210> board<00:01:24.420> out<00:01:24.539> of<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.719> way

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
I'm pulling the board out of the way

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.510 
I'm pulling the board out of the way
because<00:01:25.170> I<00:01:25.439> don't<00:01:25.920> have<00:01:26.009> a<00:01:26.070> momentum<00:01:26.250> from

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
because I don't have a momentum from

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.149 
because I don't have a momentum from
paddling<00:01:26.850> and<00:01:27.229> I<00:01:28.229> just<00:01:28.439> let<00:01:28.619> him<00:01:28.710> go<00:01:28.829> figured

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
paddling and I just let him go figured

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.760 
paddling and I just let him go figured
he<00:01:29.250> was<00:01:29.369> going<00:01:29.570> knowing<00:01:30.570> mark<00:01:30.869> he's<00:01:31.200> going<00:01:31.530> so

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
he was going knowing mark he's going so

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.499 
he was going knowing mark he's going so
I<00:01:31.799> just<00:01:31.979> meant<00:01:32.189> ah<00:01:32.340> he's<00:01:32.549> going<00:01:32.880> fine<00:01:33.119> how<00:01:33.329> it

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
I just meant ah he's going fine how it

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.510 
I just meant ah he's going fine how it
gives<00:01:33.780> an<00:01:33.930> expert<00:01:34.259> so<00:01:34.979> I<00:01:35.009> turn<00:01:35.280> around<00:01:35.369> the

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
gives an expert so I turn around the

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.740 
gives an expert so I turn around the
paddle<00:01:35.789> back<00:01:35.909> out<00:01:36.060> I<00:01:36.090> had<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.420> paddle<00:01:36.750> over
