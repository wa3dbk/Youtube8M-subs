00:00:02.449 --> 00:00:05.900
 I will show you how to be able to 

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:09.070
 download pandora music 

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:11.299
 then ipod ipad and iphone devices 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:13.070
 obviously we need to see and if not 

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:15.289
 you have to see that here I leave the link 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:17.360
 so you can go and jailbreak 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:18.950
 on your device although I do not go 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.800
 having to see what we are going to do is 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:22.929
 enter Libya 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:27.210
 and we leave as always to load the 

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:27.210
 packages to work 100% 

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:34.570
 ok once being in cydia what we're going 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.030
 to say to handle 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:40.129
 forces or sources and we're going to add the 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:43.220
 next source that we are going to put 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:45.350
 obviously edit add and we will give 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.480
 this source which I'll put in the 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:51.440
 screen for you to put that 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:52.070
 it's apt dot semi.com diagonal 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.900
 ripoll 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.820
 they add it and what they are going to do 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:58.460
 after being the search engine and search by 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.409
 this is called I lit this lime tree 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.899
 will allow us is to download the 

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:04.280
 music although since it has been installed what 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:07.070
 what we are going to do is obviously go to 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.500
 pandora and let's put the song that 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.930
 we want or the group whatever we want 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:15.540
 we are going to look for a genre and we are going to put 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:17.700
 hip-hop and we're going to put of the 90s 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.700
 what it is going to do is that it will happen to the 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.420
 music will start as you will see the music 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.190
 is starting and is loading the 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:28.350
 little black circle is when you are 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:31.020
 downloading what we are going to do to leave 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.610
 is that I finished loading obviously 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.010
 so that the song ends 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.410
 complete 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:37.730
 many times it takes many times not here 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:39.710
 let's see how long it takes 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:42.050
 depending on the music also that is 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.550
 the song is long and good 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:46.040
 when it finishes loading what is going to 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.990
 to seem is to say that it is like 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.540
 announces that it says song saved together 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:53.300
 with the photo the good thing about this is that 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:55.160
 you can without you want or you can put 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.210
 This on iTunes is as if you had 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.850
 legally purchased 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:01.400
 the bad thing is that you can not choose the 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.380
 song is not already you see that pandora you 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.630
 put songs of jump 2 or things like that 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.070
 that 's the bad thing you have no choice of 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.100
 download or whenever you put it 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.690
 you are always going to download your mantente 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.060

00:02:23.749 --> 00:02:28.310
