which<00:03:21.110> is<00:03:21.140> pretty<00:03:21.799> simple<00:03:24.220> this<00:03:25.220> core<00:03:25.519> that<00:03:25.670> we

00:03:25.809 --> 00:03:25.819 
which is pretty simple this core that we

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:27.250 
which is pretty simple this core that we
talked<00:03:26.030> about<00:03:26.180> at<00:03:26.360> the<00:03:26.390> very<00:03:26.480> beginning<00:03:26.780> this

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
talked about at the very beginning this

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.369 
talked about at the very beginning this
d9<00:03:27.739> you<00:03:28.220> take<00:03:28.430> the<00:03:28.519> same<00:03:28.760> chord<00:03:29.150> form<00:03:29.450> move<00:03:30.170> up

00:03:30.369 --> 00:03:30.379 
d9 you take the same chord form move up

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:33.670 
d9 you take the same chord form move up
to<00:03:30.560> the<00:03:30.680> seventh<00:03:31.069> fret<00:03:31.310> on<00:03:31.579> the<00:03:32.180> B<00:03:32.360> and<00:03:32.750> g

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
to the seventh fret on the B and g

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:46.140 
to the seventh fret on the B and g
strings<00:03:34.180> so<00:03:35.180> he<00:03:35.480> goes

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.980 

so<00:03:47.150> what<00:03:47.300> I<00:03:47.330> did<00:03:47.420> was<00:03:48.580> seventh<00:03:49.580> fret<00:03:49.990> being

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:50.990 
so what I did was seventh fret being

00:03:50.990 --> 00:04:02.280 
so what I did was seventh fret being
g-strings<00:03:51.610> and<00:03:52.610> I<00:03:52.700> moved<00:03:52.940> up<00:03:53.150> to<00:03:53.360> the<00:03:53.710> 8<00:03:54.710> 8<00:03:55.100> &amp;<00:03:55.460> 9

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:06.960 

and<00:04:03.290> back<00:04:03.500> down<00:04:03.530> to<00:04:03.770> five

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:06.970 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:09.340 

and<00:04:07.970> here<00:04:08.090> look<00:04:08.300> guys<00:04:08.510> a<00:04:08.540> little<00:04:08.750> run<00:04:09.020> on<00:04:09.200> the

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:09.350 
and here look guys a little run on the

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:31.210 
and here look guys a little run on the
e-string

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:31.220 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:34.749 

you

00:04:34.749 --> 00:04:34.759 

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:40.320 

so<00:04:35.330> that's<00:04:35.509> the<00:04:35.629> same<00:04:35.870> thing

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.119 

I'm<00:04:40.750> getting<00:04:41.050> that<00:04:41.139> sound<00:04:41.470> by<00:04:41.650> letting<00:04:41.860> go<00:04:41.979> of

00:04:42.119 --> 00:04:42.129 
I'm getting that sound by letting go of

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:44.159 
I'm getting that sound by letting go of
the<00:04:42.280> my<00:04:42.819> third<00:04:43.090> finger<00:04:43.360> so<00:04:43.629> I'm<00:04:43.720> letting<00:04:43.900> the<00:04:44.020> B

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:44.169 
the my third finger so I'm letting the B

00:04:44.169 --> 00:05:00.940 
the my third finger so I'm letting the B
string<00:04:44.500> ring<00:04:44.710> through

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:00.950 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:03.710 

that's<00:05:01.950> the<00:05:02.100> backbones<00:05:02.520> of<00:05:02.640> the<00:05:02.700> song<00:05:03.000> hope

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:03.720
