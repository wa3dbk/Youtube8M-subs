hey<00:00:01.439> everyone<00:00:01.829> in<00:00:02.070> this<00:00:02.129> video<00:00:02.669> I'm<00:00:03.090> going<00:00:03.419> to

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510 
hey everyone in this video I'm going to

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.530 
hey everyone in this video I'm going to
explain<00:00:04.049> how<00:00:04.110> a<00:00:04.380> sump<00:00:04.859> or<00:00:05.069> a<00:00:05.160> wet/dry<00:00:06.060> filter

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
explain how a sump or a wet/dry filter

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.730 
explain how a sump or a wet/dry filter
works<00:00:06.779> so<00:00:07.770> this<00:00:07.859> is<00:00:08.010> my<00:00:08.130> 75<00:00:08.639> gallon<00:00:09.030> tank<00:00:09.300> and<00:00:09.740> I

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
works so this is my 75 gallon tank and I

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.660 
works so this is my 75 gallon tank and I
have<00:00:11.219> two<00:00:11.670> large<00:00:12.120> goldfish<00:00:12.809> in<00:00:13.049> it<00:00:13.230> and<00:00:13.500> it<00:00:14.400> has

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
have two large goldfish in it and it has

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:21.140 
have two large goldfish in it and it has
a<00:00:15.120> sump<00:00:18.439> so<00:00:19.439> the<00:00:19.590> first<00:00:19.830> step<00:00:20.220> is<00:00:20.430> the<00:00:20.939> water

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
a sump so the first step is the water

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.040 
a sump so the first step is the water
gets<00:00:21.660> drawn<00:00:22.020> into<00:00:22.350> the<00:00:22.470> sump<00:00:22.800> and<00:00:23.840> this<00:00:24.840> is

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
gets drawn into the sump and this is

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.370 
gets drawn into the sump and this is
done<00:00:25.320> with<00:00:26.010> an<00:00:26.160> overflow<00:00:26.609> box<00:00:27.019> you<00:00:28.019> can<00:00:28.199> see

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
done with an overflow box you can see

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:34.069 
done with an overflow box you can see
mine<00:00:28.590> back<00:00:28.890> here<00:00:30.289> and<00:00:31.940> the<00:00:32.940> slats<00:00:33.360> on<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:33.840> top

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
mine back here and the slats on the top

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.940 
mine back here and the slats on the top
there<00:00:34.730> are<00:00:35.730> where<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.149> water<00:00:36.329> goes<00:00:36.630> through

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:36.950 
there are where the water goes through

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:42.229 
there are where the water goes through
and<00:00:37.950> it's<00:00:38.910> black<00:00:39.239> and<00:00:39.629> my<00:00:39.989> aquarium<00:00:40.940> back<00:00:41.940> is

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
and it's black and my aquarium back is

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.180 
and it's black and my aquarium back is
painted<00:00:42.629> black<00:00:42.809> so<00:00:43.440> it<00:00:43.649> blends<00:00:43.920> in<00:00:44.160> really

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
painted black so it blends in really

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.910 
painted black so it blends in really
nicely<00:00:44.899> that's<00:00:45.899> one<00:00:46.230> thing<00:00:46.410> I<00:00:46.500> really<00:00:46.530> like

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
nicely that's one thing I really like

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.029 
nicely that's one thing I really like
about<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.399> sump<00:00:47.670> filtration<00:00:48.450> is<00:00:48.629> that<00:00:49.559> it's

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
about the sump filtration is that it's

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.299 
about the sump filtration is that it's
really<00:00:50.789> easy<00:00:51.000> to<00:00:51.120> disguise<00:00:51.719> so<00:00:52.710> here<00:00:53.039> you<00:00:53.129> can

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
really easy to disguise so here you can

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.900 
really easy to disguise so here you can
see<00:00:53.489> a<00:00:53.520> top<00:00:53.789> view<00:00:53.820> of<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.690> overflow<00:00:55.140> box<00:00:55.910> as

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
see a top view of the overflow box as

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.709 
see a top view of the overflow box as
the<00:00:57.210> water<00:00:57.420> overflows<00:00:58.320> over<00:00:59.160> these<00:00:59.550> slats<00:01:00.149> it

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
the water overflows over these slats it

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.310 
the water overflows over these slats it
enters<00:01:01.469> a<00:01:01.500> box<00:01:02.039> and<00:01:02.579> inside<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.629> box<00:01:03.809> there's

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
enters a box and inside the box there's

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:10.100 
enters a box and inside the box there's
a<00:01:04.619> great<00:01:05.659> looks<00:01:06.659> like<00:01:06.869> this<00:01:07.110> and<00:01:08.100> a<00:01:08.750> hole<00:01:09.750> in

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
a great looks like this and a hole in

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.000 
a great looks like this and a hole in
the<00:01:10.320> glass

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
the glass

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.460 
the glass
so<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:11.909> grate<00:01:12.119> goes<00:01:12.360> into<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.750> hole<00:01:12.930> so<00:01:13.170> it

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
so the grate goes into the hole so it

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.990 
so the grate goes into the hole so it
filters<00:01:14.750> out<00:01:15.750> any<00:01:16.229> larger<00:01:17.130> particles<00:01:17.820> that

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
filters out any larger particles that

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.330 
filters out any larger particles that
might<00:01:18.150> go<00:01:18.360> into<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.170> filter<00:01:19.500> and<00:01:19.860> then<00:01:20.040> in<00:01:20.250> the

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
might go into the filter and then in the

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.910 
might go into the filter and then in the
back<00:01:20.490> here<00:01:20.850> you<00:01:20.970> can<00:01:21.119> see<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.509> tube<00:01:21.920> that's

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
back here you can see the tube that's

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.149 
back here you can see the tube that's
coming<00:01:23.490> out<00:01:23.640> from<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.119> hole<00:01:24.360> in<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.470> tank<00:01:25.680> and

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
coming out from the hole in the tank and

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.350 
coming out from the hole in the tank and
there's<00:01:26.909> a<00:01:27.180> large<00:01:27.659> diameter<00:01:28.470> pipe<00:01:29.189> going<00:01:30.119> down

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
there's a large diameter pipe going down

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.649 
there's a large diameter pipe going down
to<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.689> sump<00:01:30.990> which<00:01:31.229> I'll<00:01:31.439> show<00:01:31.770> you

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:32.659 
to the sump which I'll show you

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:35.600 
to the sump which I'll show you
so<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:33.869> sump<00:01:34.140> is<00:01:34.350> underneath<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:35.340> tank

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
so the sump is underneath the tank

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.820 
so the sump is underneath the tank
inside<00:01:36.299> of<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.600> stand<00:01:36.990> and<00:01:38.630> this<00:01:39.630> stand<00:01:40.470> I

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:40.830 
inside of the stand and this stand I

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:46.609 
inside of the stand and this stand I
modified<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:42.270> give<00:01:43.200> it<00:01:43.350> nice<00:01:43.850> large<00:01:44.850> doors<00:01:45.619> so

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
modified to give it nice large doors so

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.219 
modified to give it nice large doors so
I<00:01:46.649> can<00:01:47.040> really<00:01:47.369> access<00:01:47.909> everything

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
I can really access everything

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:51.910 
I can really access everything
underneath<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.380> tank<00:01:49.610> more<00:01:50.610> easily

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 
underneath the tank more easily

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:58.480 
underneath the tank more easily
it<00:01:52.920> has<00:01:53.460> a<00:01:53.490> PVC<00:01:54.210> elbow<00:01:54.630> and<00:01:55.110> then<00:01:55.259> it<00:01:55.440> has<00:01:56.000> a

00:01:58.480 --> 00:01:58.490 
it has a PVC elbow and then it has a

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:03.160 
it has a PVC elbow and then it has a
bulkhead<00:01:59.490> attached<00:02:00.420> to<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:00.990> cover<00:02:01.170> here<00:02:01.619> and

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
bulkhead attached to the cover here and

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:08.240 
bulkhead attached to the cover here and
that<00:02:04.170> is<00:02:04.409> just<00:02:04.640> dumping<00:02:05.640> water<00:02:06.950> into<00:02:07.950> there

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
that is just dumping water into there

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.320 
that is just dumping water into there
and<00:02:08.580> there<00:02:09.539> is<00:02:09.690> a<00:02:09.720> drip<00:02:10.050> tray<00:02:10.850> which<00:02:11.850> is<00:02:12.060> just

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
and there is a drip tray which is just

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.890 
and there is a drip tray which is just
an<00:02:12.630> acrylic<00:02:12.989> tray<00:02:13.560> really<00:02:14.100> shallow<00:02:14.630> that<00:02:15.630> has

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
an acrylic tray really shallow that has

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.229 
an acrylic tray really shallow that has
holes<00:02:16.350> drilled<00:02:16.739> into<00:02:16.890> the<00:02:17.100> bottom<00:02:17.400> every<00:02:17.910> half

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239 
holes drilled into the bottom every half

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:22.009 
holes drilled into the bottom every half
inch<00:02:18.540> or<00:02:18.720> so<00:02:19.580> so<00:02:20.580> that<00:02:20.610> distributes<00:02:21.510> the<00:02:21.810> water

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:22.019 
inch or so so that distributes the water

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:25.009 
inch or so so that distributes the water
evenly<00:02:22.590> over<00:02:23.280> all<00:02:23.459> the<00:02:23.819> biological<00:02:24.299> media

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:25.019 
evenly over all the biological media

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:28.610 
evenly over all the biological media
that's<00:02:25.680> down<00:02:25.950> here<00:02:26.209> this<00:02:27.209> whole<00:02:27.600> part<00:02:28.380> of<00:02:28.500> it

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
that's down here this whole part of it

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.880 
that's down here this whole part of it
is<00:02:28.830> just<00:02:29.420> filled<00:02:30.420> with<00:02:30.630> biological<00:02:31.230> media

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
is just filled with biological media

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.430 
is just filled with biological media
like<00:02:32.190> you<00:02:32.940> can<00:02:33.120> see<00:02:33.330> those<00:02:33.540> blue<00:02:33.900> bio<00:02:34.110> balls

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
like you can see those blue bio balls

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.009 
like you can see those blue bio balls
and<00:02:34.830> then<00:02:34.950> I<00:02:35.220> have<00:02:36.180> some<00:02:36.450> black<00:02:36.720> plastic

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:37.019 
and then I have some black plastic

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:39.280 
and then I have some black plastic
cylinders<00:02:37.799> and<00:02:38.160> then<00:02:38.400> some<00:02:38.640> ceramic

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
cylinders and then some ceramic

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:46.520 
cylinders and then some ceramic
cylinders<00:02:40.700> and<00:02:41.700> then<00:02:41.940> the<00:02:42.090> bottom<00:02:42.480> is<00:02:45.290> just<00:02:46.290> a

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
cylinders and then the bottom is just a

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.400 
cylinders and then the bottom is just a
little<00:02:46.860> egg<00:02:47.040> crate<00:02:47.810> platform<00:02:48.810> that<00:02:49.079> I<00:02:49.109> made

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
little egg crate platform that I made

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.360 
little egg crate platform that I made
and<00:02:50.280> it<00:02:50.790> sits<00:02:51.060> above<00:02:51.359> the<00:02:51.920> bottom<00:02:52.920> of<00:02:53.040> the<00:02:53.130> tank

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
and it sits above the bottom of the tank

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.000 
and it sits above the bottom of the tank
a<00:02:53.489> little<00:02:53.519> bit<00:02:54.109> just<00:02:55.109> to<00:02:55.290> keep<00:02:55.440> them<00:02:55.739> from

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
a little bit just to keep them from

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.220 
a little bit just to keep them from
spilling<00:02:56.549> over<00:02:56.670> into<00:02:56.850> the<00:02:57.120> next<00:02:57.239> chamber

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:05.589 

and<00:03:00.440> in<00:03:01.190> here<00:03:01.550> I<00:03:01.580> just<00:03:01.700> have<00:03:02.000> a<00:03:02.950> sponge<00:03:04.599> to

00:03:05.589 --> 00:03:05.599 
and in here I just have a sponge to

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:09.610 
and in here I just have a sponge to
filter<00:03:05.959> out<00:03:06.110> more<00:03:06.709> particles<00:03:07.750> it<00:03:08.750> actually<00:03:09.380> I

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
filter out more particles it actually I

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.020 
filter out more particles it actually I
don't<00:03:09.770> know<00:03:09.950> if<00:03:10.010> you<00:03:10.099> can<00:03:10.220> tell<00:03:10.430> this<00:03:10.580> but<00:03:10.790> so

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
don't know if you can tell this but so

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:12.910 
don't know if you can tell this but so
the<00:03:11.150> water<00:03:11.300> comes<00:03:11.599> down<00:03:11.810> here<00:03:12.170> and<00:03:12.800> then<00:03:12.890> it

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
the water comes down here and then it

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.240 
the water comes down here and then it
goes<00:03:13.130> underneath<00:03:13.489> this<00:03:14.150> acrylic<00:03:14.660> wall

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
goes underneath this acrylic wall

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.800 
goes underneath this acrylic wall
because<00:03:16.250> there's<00:03:16.520> a<00:03:16.580> gap<00:03:16.850> at<00:03:17.030> the<00:03:17.150> bottom<00:03:17.480> and

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
because there's a gap at the bottom and

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.250 
because there's a gap at the bottom and
it<00:03:18.500> goes<00:03:18.620> into<00:03:18.800> this<00:03:19.010> section<00:03:20.110> and<00:03:21.110> then

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
it goes into this section and then

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.470 
it goes into this section and then
that's<00:03:21.470> divided<00:03:22.010> with<00:03:22.400> some<00:03:22.640> egg<00:03:22.850> crate<00:03:23.150> and

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
that's divided with some egg crate and

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.550 
that's divided with some egg crate and
in<00:03:23.959> here<00:03:24.230> I<00:03:24.260> have<00:03:24.500> the<00:03:24.530> pump<00:03:25.360> work<00:03:26.390> I<00:03:26.720> believe

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
in here I have the pump work I believe

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.930 
in here I have the pump work I believe
this<00:03:27.860> pump<00:03:28.250> is<00:03:28.519> 700<00:03:29.330> gallons<00:03:29.450> per<00:03:29.840> hour

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
this pump is 700 gallons per hour

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.000 
this pump is 700 gallons per hour
something<00:03:31.940> like<00:03:32.090> that<00:03:32.480> and<00:03:32.870> then<00:03:33.350> I<00:03:33.380> also<00:03:33.620> put

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 
something like that and then I also put

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:35.979 
something like that and then I also put
an<00:03:34.130> air<00:03:34.310> stone<00:03:34.670> in<00:03:34.940> here<00:03:35.239> because<00:03:35.450> I<00:03:35.780> found

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:35.989 
an air stone in here because I found

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:39.039 
an air stone in here because I found
that<00:03:36.319> the<00:03:37.220> water<00:03:37.430> on<00:03:37.610> top<00:03:37.850> tended<00:03:38.390> to<00:03:38.540> get<00:03:38.750> kind

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:39.049 
that the water on top tended to get kind

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:42.910 
that the water on top tended to get kind
of<00:03:40.000> gross<00:03:41.000> like<00:03:41.540> it<00:03:41.750> would<00:03:41.870> get<00:03:41.989> a<00:03:42.049> gross

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:42.920 
of gross like it would get a gross

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:45.460 
of gross like it would get a gross
film<00:03:43.310> on<00:03:43.670> it<00:03:44.060> after<00:03:44.390> a<00:03:44.420> while<00:03:44.690> so<00:03:45.170> the<00:03:45.319> air

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
film on it after a while so the air

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:48.160 
film on it after a while so the air
stone<00:03:45.769> really<00:03:45.950> helps<00:03:46.510> prevent<00:03:47.510> that<00:03:47.660> plus<00:03:47.989> it

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170 
stone really helps prevent that plus it

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.740 
stone really helps prevent that plus it
helps<00:03:49.000> put<00:03:50.000> more<00:03:50.180> oxygen<00:03:50.690> into<00:03:50.959> the<00:03:50.989> water<00:03:51.260> so

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:52.750 
helps put more oxygen into the water so

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:58.800 
helps put more oxygen into the water so
it's<00:03:53.750> never<00:03:53.959> a<00:03:54.049> bad<00:03:54.140> thing<00:03:55.480> and<00:03:56.480> then<00:03:56.780> I<00:03:56.810> have<00:03:57.260> a

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
it's never a bad thing and then I have a

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:03.300 
it's never a bad thing and then I have a
ball<00:03:59.810> valve<00:04:00.190> attached<00:04:01.190> directly<00:04:01.910> on<00:04:02.090> to<00:04:02.360> the

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310 
ball valve attached directly on to the

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:07.990 
ball valve attached directly on to the
the<00:04:04.310> pump<00:04:04.790> and<00:04:06.010> that's<00:04:07.010> just<00:04:07.370> to<00:04:07.549> prevent

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
the pump and that's just to prevent

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.789 
the pump and that's just to prevent
water<00:04:08.299> from<00:04:08.480> siphoning<00:04:09.290> into<00:04:09.500> this<00:04:10.239> sump<00:04:11.239> and

00:04:11.789 --> 00:04:11.799 
water from siphoning into this sump and

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:13.870 
water from siphoning into this sump and
overflowing<00:04:12.799> in<00:04:13.160> the<00:04:13.250> event<00:04:13.489> of<00:04:13.609> a<00:04:13.700> power

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:13.880 
overflowing in the event of a power

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:18.310 
overflowing in the event of a power
outage<00:04:14.799> so<00:04:15.799> that's<00:04:16.070> really<00:04:16.430> a<00:04:17.390> necessary

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 
outage so that's really a necessary

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.759 
outage so that's really a necessary
component<00:04:18.859> and<00:04:19.640> then<00:04:20.630> you<00:04:21.109> can<00:04:21.289> see<00:04:21.530> this

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:21.769 
component and then you can see this

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:24.340 
component and then you can see this
clear<00:04:22.400> tubing<00:04:22.850> is<00:04:23.150> coming<00:04:23.600> out<00:04:23.840> of<00:04:24.080> the<00:04:24.169> pump

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:24.350 
clear tubing is coming out of the pump

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:32.170 
clear tubing is coming out of the pump
and<00:04:25.390> it<00:04:26.390> splits<00:04:26.960> into<00:04:27.320> two<00:04:27.620> right<00:04:27.860> there

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:35.190 

and<00:04:32.270> that's<00:04:32.870> because<00:04:33.320> one<00:04:34.160> of<00:04:34.190> the<00:04:34.430> tubes

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:35.200 
and that's because one of the tubes

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.110 
and that's because one of the tubes
leads<00:04:36.200> to<00:04:36.560> my<00:04:36.680> UV<00:04:37.010> sterilizer<00:04:37.520> you<00:04:37.790> can<00:04:37.970> see

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 
leads to my UV sterilizer you can see

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.660 
leads to my UV sterilizer you can see
the<00:04:38.240> light<00:04:38.420> from<00:04:38.570> it<00:04:38.780> right<00:04:38.900> there<00:04:39.110> and<00:04:39.520> so<00:04:40.520> it

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:40.670 
the light from it right there and so it

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:42.750 
the light from it right there and so it
goes<00:04:40.820> through<00:04:41.060> the<00:04:41.210> UV<00:04:41.480> sterilizer<00:04:41.990> and<00:04:42.140> then

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:42.760 
goes through the UV sterilizer and then

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:45.010 
goes through the UV sterilizer and then
dumps<00:04:43.760> back<00:04:43.940> into<00:04:44.240> the<00:04:44.360> tank<00:04:44.600> and<00:04:44.750> the<00:04:44.870> other

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.020 
dumps back into the tank and the other

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:46.990 
dumps back into the tank and the other
one<00:04:45.230> bypasses<00:04:45.980> the<00:04:46.130> UV<00:04:46.460> and<00:04:46.490> just<00:04:46.820> goes

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:47.000 
one bypasses the UV and just goes

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.090 
one bypasses the UV and just goes
straight<00:04:47.150> into<00:04:47.450> the<00:04:47.690> tank<00:04:47.900> and<00:04:48.050> that<00:04:48.110> is<00:04:48.890> done

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:49.100 
straight into the tank and that is done

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:51.880 
straight into the tank and that is done
because<00:04:49.520> you<00:04:49.790> want<00:04:50.420> a<00:04:50.750> certain<00:04:51.200> flow<00:04:51.680> rate

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:51.890 
because you want a certain flow rate

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:54.970 
because you want a certain flow rate
through<00:04:52.220> the<00:04:52.310> UV<00:04:52.930> sterilizer<00:04:53.930> otherwise<00:04:54.770> you

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:54.980 
through the UV sterilizer otherwise you

00:04:54.980 --> 00:05:02.640 
through the UV sterilizer otherwise you
won't<00:04:55.130> get<00:04:57.430> efficient<00:04:59.440> sterilization<00:05:00.970> so

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:02.650 
won't get efficient sterilization so

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:07.610 
won't get efficient sterilization so
that's<00:05:03.650> why<00:05:03.860> that<00:05:03.890> is<00:05:04.100> done

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:07.620 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:10.490 

and<00:05:08.040> so<00:05:08.280> the<00:05:08.490> last<00:05:08.700> step<00:05:09.120> is<00:05:09.419> it<00:05:09.780> just<00:05:10.080> gets

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:10.500 
and so the last step is it just gets

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.980 
and so the last step is it just gets
pumped<00:05:11.130> back<00:05:11.280> into<00:05:11.340> the<00:05:11.580> tank<00:05:11.910> you<00:05:12.600> can<00:05:12.780> see

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:12.990 
pumped back into the tank you can see

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:17.360 
pumped back into the tank you can see
right<00:05:13.169> there<00:05:13.380> one<00:05:13.620> of<00:05:13.650> my<00:05:13.950> outflows<00:05:14.760> and<00:05:16.370> it's

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:17.370 
right there one of my outflows and it's

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:19.820 
right there one of my outflows and it's
angled<00:05:17.880> towards<00:05:18.300> the<00:05:18.389> bottom<00:05:18.840> here<00:05:19.290> so<00:05:19.650> it

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:19.830 
angled towards the bottom here so it

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:23.900 
angled towards the bottom here so it
kind<00:05:20.160> of<00:05:21.860> distributes<00:05:22.860> the<00:05:23.160> water<00:05:23.400> evenly

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:23.910 
kind of distributes the water evenly

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:27.470 
kind of distributes the water evenly
around<00:05:24.240> the<00:05:24.419> tank<00:05:25.160> if<00:05:26.160> you<00:05:26.760> have<00:05:27.120> these

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:27.480 
around the tank if you have these

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:29.500 
around the tank if you have these
outflows<00:05:28.139> pointed<00:05:28.650> up<00:05:28.770> towards<00:05:29.040> the<00:05:29.130> surface

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:29.510 
outflows pointed up towards the surface

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:32.659 
outflows pointed up towards the surface
then<00:05:30.510> it<00:05:30.540> won't<00:05:30.930> cycle<00:05:31.889> through<00:05:32.280> the<00:05:32.400> entire

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:32.669 
then it won't cycle through the entire

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:35.240 
then it won't cycle through the entire
tank<00:05:33.000> very<00:05:33.180> well<00:05:33.419> it'll<00:05:34.260> just<00:05:34.620> come<00:05:35.070> out<00:05:35.220> here

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:35.250 
tank very well it'll just come out here

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:36.860 
tank very well it'll just come out here
and<00:05:35.700> then<00:05:35.820> go<00:05:35.940> straight<00:05:36.270> into<00:05:36.450> the<00:05:36.600> overflow

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:36.870 
and then go straight into the overflow

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:39.350 
and then go straight into the overflow
box<00:05:37.100> so<00:05:38.100> you<00:05:38.190> really<00:05:38.490> want<00:05:38.669> to<00:05:38.820> angle<00:05:39.180> those

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:39.360 
box so you really want to angle those

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:44.600 
box so you really want to angle those
down<00:05:40.700> as<00:05:41.700> much<00:05:41.940> as<00:05:42.000> you<00:05:42.240> can<00:05:42.510> and<00:05:43.500> let's<00:05:44.340> see

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:44.610 
down as much as you can and let's see

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:46.280 
down as much as you can and let's see
the<00:05:44.820> other<00:05:44.940> one<00:05:45.240> is<00:05:45.419> up<00:05:45.540> here<00:05:45.780> somewhere

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:46.290 
the other one is up here somewhere

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:53.330 
the other one is up here somewhere
hiding<00:05:50.960> yeah<00:05:51.960> it's<00:05:52.169> not<00:05:52.290> really<00:05:52.590> very<00:05:52.860> visible

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:53.340 
hiding yeah it's not really very visible

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:56.300 
hiding yeah it's not really very visible
but<00:05:54.020> it's<00:05:55.020> just<00:05:55.260> right<00:05:55.530> up<00:05:55.680> against<00:05:56.100> the

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:56.310 
but it's just right up against the

00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:01.740 
but it's just right up against the
overflow<00:05:56.940> box<00:05:56.970> right<00:05:57.419> there

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:01.750 

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:04.800 

so<00:06:02.320> everything<00:06:02.950> is<00:06:03.250> black<00:06:03.610> inside<00:06:04.390> of<00:06:04.600> here

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:04.810 
so everything is black inside of here

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:08.040 
so everything is black inside of here
and<00:06:04.840> the<00:06:05.230> background<00:06:06.190> is<00:06:06.430> black<00:06:06.730> too<00:06:07.030> so<00:06:07.930> it

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:08.050 
and the background is black too so it

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:09.750 
and the background is black too so it
all<00:06:08.140> blends<00:06:08.410> in<00:06:08.590> really<00:06:08.620> nicely<00:06:09.070> which<00:06:09.610> I

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:09.760 
all blends in really nicely which I

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:13.340 
all blends in really nicely which I
really<00:06:10.060> like<00:06:10.270> and<00:06:10.630> you<00:06:10.660> really<00:06:11.410> can't<00:06:11.680> even

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:13.350 
really like and you really can't even

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:16.050 
really like and you really can't even
tell<00:06:14.350> that<00:06:14.380> there's<00:06:14.800> any<00:06:15.010> filtration<00:06:15.310> on<00:06:15.730> here

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:16.060 
tell that there's any filtration on here

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:18.540 
tell that there's any filtration on here
oh<00:06:16.240> I<00:06:16.450> like<00:06:16.810> that<00:06:16.840> because<00:06:17.260> I<00:06:17.770> like<00:06:18.070> a<00:06:18.250> nice

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:18.550 
oh I like that because I like a nice

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:23.400 
oh I like that because I like a nice
clean<00:06:18.970> looking<00:06:19.330> tank<00:06:19.720> with<00:06:21.390> not<00:06:22.390> too<00:06:23.290> many

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:23.410 
clean looking tank with not too many

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:25.650 
clean looking tank with not too many
visual<00:06:23.980> distractions<00:06:24.700> because<00:06:25.030> I<00:06:25.270> like<00:06:25.450> my

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:25.660 
visual distractions because I like my

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:35.920 
visual distractions because I like my
beautiful<00:06:26.560> fish<00:06:26.830> to<00:06:27.100> stand<00:06:27.430> out

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:35.930 

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:41.640 

so<00:06:36.530> that<00:06:36.919> is<00:06:37.960> very<00:06:38.960> basic<00:06:39.250> rundown<00:06:40.250> of<00:06:40.729> how<00:06:41.060> a

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:41.650 
so that is very basic rundown of how a

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:45.280 
so that is very basic rundown of how a
wet/dry<00:06:42.650> filter<00:06:43.070> works
