 tenth and final round indeed 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:25.619
 extraordinary since the tests since 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:29.070
 class superbike the superbike class he has 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:31.740

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.809
 true yes exactly speaks foreign though 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.950
 in reality two pilots speak also in the 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.270
 our Italian language 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.280
 the winner was mika kallio 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.910
 absolute ruler both in trial and in 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.989
 race rennet comes from the moto2 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.239
 very fast in the world championship 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.610
 this race has taken the place of 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:51.300
 sebastien gimbert who is engaged in the 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.649

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.449
 result of manuel that preceded 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.920
 leandro mercado also speaks third 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.750
 Italian even if he is Argentine but in the 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.030
 Progetto Punto is a San Marino project 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.330
 But the title went edi a hoe that 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.340
 he followed us 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.650
 great and the compliments first of all for 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.690
 the 2013 superbike title now 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.760
 let's hear from mika's words 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:22.450
 kallio the winner of the race 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:26.580
 of the superbike class to the 33 san vito 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.580
 cost to those known planet 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:50.469
 the plans to stay from my son de porta 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:56.799
 from these it was the Afghanistan stack 

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:59.700
 san blas force port of the wrestler 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:03.759
 complicated vasari house by myself valona 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:12.160
 of known it is it may change state was 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:14.019
 reasons and from the superbike from the class 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.150
 queen we move to the moto3 and also here 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:18.040
 if possible there were emotions 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:21.069
 even bigger with an arrival in 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:24.160
 resounding sprint 6 riders think in 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:25.989
 only 49 thousandths I think is a record 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.459
 the race is absolutely the record 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:29.709
 of the moto3 probably was the most 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:31.630
 beautiful in the history certainly of the 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:33.639
 smallest category of the sample 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:36.010
 Italian race won by Michael Coletti 

00:02:33.639 --> 00:02:37.750
 already winner in the second round here at 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.160
 then mugello at the beginning of the season 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.780
 Michael got the better by a whisker 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.180
 on fabi di gianantonio at the first podium 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.709
 in the civ and in the moto3 class 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.120
 third place for Stefano Valtulini 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:47.859
 protagonist of the first part of the 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.840
 season is back in great shape 

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:51.579
 and went a little less well to poleman luca 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.620
 marini that only four arrived 

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:55.200
 but really for a trifle and even wings 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.480
 of the championship that just andrea 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.639
 locatelli that ended up nearby in short 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.900
 to the winners but kept the 

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:04.150
 leadership and therefore tomorrow yes 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.380
 they will play everything in the last one 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.090
 rarely but now we hear right from the 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.220
 words of michael coletti the outcome of 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.590
 corsa chico was a beautiful race 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.870
 there were nine of us playing it every lap 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.609
 there was a different pilot is the last lap 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.720
 we went out and also useful to the last one 

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:19.419
 care we have arrived at the goal that 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.099
 we were eight open said clini e 

00:03:19.419 --> 00:03:22.209
 hard and hard instead paraffin sky remains 

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:24.160
 take it home 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:26.230
 stock 600 pilots had a 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.790
 very difficult task after a race 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.980
 amazing how that bike 3 ie 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.169
 don't make the show regret that 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.419
 we had lived a few moments ago and there 

00:03:32.169 --> 00:03:36.280
 they succeeded because also freely 

00:03:34.419 --> 00:03:38.049
 it seems made two arrivals on purpose 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.850
 the one for the first and the second one flew 

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:41.800
 place and that for the third and fourth 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:43.840
 is absolutely the race swept by 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:46.780
 franco morbidelli who arrived for 6 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.010
 thousandths ahead of luca 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.560
 oppedisano and two made a race 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:52.510
 incredible together with the poleman loco that 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.110
 unfortunately it slipped halfway through 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:54.850
 race 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:56.110
 third place instead for stefano casalotti 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:58.240
 also the notes in the sprint finish 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:00.010
 and now we hear rubio of the words of 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.730
 franco morbidelli winner of the stock 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:03.370
 600 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:05.500
 how it went on the track and it's great 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.630
 It was a beautiful race 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.370
 I lost the train a little at first 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:12.220
 because I tried to overtake on 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:15.190
 alessandro we touched myself I lost 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:16.989
 but then I managed to recover e 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:19.300
 I got under it 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:22.180
 up front I did my race until 

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:24.160
 end when sent and has not passed 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:26.470
 but later I used the wake on the 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:29.740
 straight and I managed to win 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:32.230
 finally the 600 supersports here too many 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:33.700
 Twists a difficult outcome too 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:35.230
 to decipher once cut the 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:38.050
 goal because in short there have been 

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:40.390
 of measures by the management 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:42.070
 of competition but was still a graduate of the 

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:43.330
 winner 2013 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:45.130
 yes exact the arrival was a bit of 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:47.170
 those who gave the daring because 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:49.660
 matthew chance passed ilario de nisi 

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:51.250
 at the last corner in with the flags 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:52.630
 so it puts on the sector was yellow 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:54.460
 downgraded indeed it was a penalty of 

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:56.890
 20 seconds ilario dionisi won the 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:58.750
 race in front of mirko giansanti and fabio 

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:00.310
 menghi then exited the third office 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:01.660
 step of the podium the race unfortunately has 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:03.700
 having seen Riccardo immediately leave the scene 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:05.710
 russian poleman and marco faccani who was in 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:07.240
 fight for the championship with Stefano 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:09.760
 cruciani cruciani who won then the 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:11.020
 title despite not arrived in 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:14.230
 bottom of the race due to breaking one 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:15.850
 candle at the very end of the race 

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:17.500
 of the 600 supersport and there was a 

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:20.260
 beautiful curtain that now we go 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:22.390
 to see among the former ilario champion 

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:24.190
 dionisi and the new champion stefano 

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:25.780
 cruciani there was this passage of 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:26.920
 deliveries then we go to see just 

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:29.950
 at the end of the race 

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:31.390
 finally happened today and passage 

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:33.520
 of witness, however, because your title 

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:35.560
 now but officially Stefano cruciani 

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:37.300
 that today did not finish the race but the 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:38.350
 new sample of 2013 dario 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:41.490
 well stefano 

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:43.900
 the strong party deserved it 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:46.330
 fact has grown so much this year 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:48.520
 compared to other years so if it is 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:50.350
 deserves everything and among all those 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.890
 they could win I'm glad it is 

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:54.820

00:05:54.820 --> 00:06:00.010
 self but of friendship and it was good to fight 

00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:00.970
 with him it was good to be his 

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:02.260
 successor 

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:04.600
 this year is the last year of the 

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:07.210
 supersport and the first year I won it 

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:09.910
