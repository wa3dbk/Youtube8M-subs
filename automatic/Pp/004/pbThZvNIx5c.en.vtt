00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
and I just knew that I was gonna get

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.539 
and I just knew that I was gonna get
beyond<00:01:09.750> that<00:01:09.900> and<00:01:10.080> even<00:01:10.470> still<00:01:10.710> I<00:01:10.740> loved<00:01:11.430> that

and you have to love that because that's

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.490 
and you have to love that because that's
that's<00:01:14.850> part<00:01:15.150> of<00:01:15.240> it<00:01:15.390> once<00:01:15.840> I<00:01:15.990> got<00:01:16.200> beyond<00:01:16.470> that

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
then I started seeing all the

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.760 
then I started seeing all the
possibilities<00:01:18.420> that<00:01:18.450> were<00:01:18.720> open<00:01:19.020> to<00:01:19.140> me<00:01:19.170> and<00:01:19.680> I

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
possibilities that were open to me and I

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.109 
possibilities that were open to me and I
can<00:01:19.920> get<00:01:20.009> into<00:01:20.159> trim<00:01:20.430> work<00:01:20.610> and<00:01:20.820> I<00:01:20.880> can<00:01:21.030> get

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
can get into trim work and I can get

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.270 
can get into trim work and I can get
into<00:01:21.240> framing<00:01:21.780> I<00:01:21.930> can<00:01:22.290> get<00:01:22.439> into<00:01:22.590> insulating

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
into framing I can get into insulating

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.630 
into framing I can get into insulating
and<00:01:23.460> ultimately<00:01:24.420> just<00:01:24.560> the<00:01:25.560> whole<00:01:25.770> package<00:01:26.340> of

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
and ultimately just the whole package of

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.960 
and ultimately just the whole package of
renovations<00:01:27.570> led<00:01:28.110> me<00:01:29.009> to<00:01:29.220> a<00:01:29.250> whole<00:01:29.520> realm<00:01:29.820> of

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
renovations led me to a whole realm of

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.940 
renovations led me to a whole realm of
thinking<00:01:30.180> that<00:01:30.420> is<00:01:30.650> beyond<00:01:31.650> what<00:01:31.829> I<00:01:31.860> ever

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
thinking that is beyond what I ever

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.429 
thinking that is beyond what I ever
thought<00:01:32.159> it<00:01:32.579> would<00:01:32.670> start<00:01:32.939> out<00:01:33.090> at<00:01:33.329> in<00:01:34.110> terms

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
thought it would start out at in terms

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.020 
thought it would start out at in terms
of<00:01:34.710> trying<00:01:34.950> to<00:01:35.130> better<00:01:35.280> yourself<00:01:35.460> it's<00:01:35.909> always

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
of trying to better yourself it's always

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.730 
of trying to better yourself it's always
