00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.380 
machine here's the other side of the
undercarriage<00:03:32.130> it's<00:03:32.490> in<00:03:32.580> about<00:03:32.790> the<00:03:33.000> they're

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
undercarriage it's in about the they're

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:35.120 
undercarriage it's in about the they're
both<00:03:33.570> in<00:03:33.780> about<00:03:34.050> the<00:03:34.200> same<00:03:34.410> condition<00:03:34.920> they're

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
both in about the same condition they're

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.740 
both in about the same condition they're
probably<00:03:35.450> eighty<00:03:36.450> or<00:03:36.660> ninety<00:03:36.720> percent<00:03:37.170> with

probably eighty or ninety percent with

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:42.140 
probably eighty or ninety percent with
there<00:03:39.750> are<00:03:39.900> a<00:03:39.930> couple<00:03:40.110> Nixle<00:03:40.650> a<00:03:41.459> couple<00:03:42.030> of<00:03:42.090> the

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
there are a couple Nixle a couple of the

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:43.760 
there are a couple Nixle a couple of the
rollers<00:03:42.510> there<00:03:42.750> but<00:03:42.989> most<00:03:43.170> of<00:03:43.260> the<00:03:43.320> rollers<00:03:43.620> in

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:43.770 
rollers there but most of the rollers in

00:03:43.770 --> 00:04:21.980 
rollers there but most of the rollers in
really<00:03:43.980> good<00:03:44.100> shape

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:21.990 

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:24.450 

so<00:04:22.990> the<00:04:23.080> engine<00:04:23.380> starts<00:04:23.740> up<00:04:23.920> and<00:04:24.100> runs<00:04:24.280> and

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
so the engine starts up and runs and

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.270 
so the engine starts up and runs and
operates<00:04:24.520> well<00:04:25.150> I<00:04:25.590> don't<00:04:26.590> have<00:04:26.680> this<00:04:26.770> cap<00:04:27.040> on

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 
operates well I don't have this cap on

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:28.920 
operates well I don't have this cap on
right<00:04:27.520> but<00:04:27.850> I'm<00:04:28.180> not<00:04:28.210> good<00:04:28.480> at<00:04:28.600> doing<00:04:28.720> that

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:28.930 
right but I'm not good at doing that

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:31.020 
right but I'm not good at doing that
left<00:04:29.170> handed<00:04:29.650> so<00:04:29.800> I<00:04:29.830> will<00:04:30.190> do<00:04:30.400> that<00:04:30.430> when<00:04:30.730> I<00:04:30.790> put

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 
left handed so I will do that when I put

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:34.620 
left handed so I will do that when I put
the<00:04:31.210> camera<00:04:31.720> down<00:04:31.930> we<00:04:33.390> haven't<00:04:34.390> seen<00:04:34.480> any
