00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:02.909 
this is a video review of the

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:05.240 
this is a video review of the
Transformers<00:00:03.449> form<00:00:03.810> age<00:00:04.110> of<00:00:04.380> extinction<00:00:04.710> flip

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
Transformers form age of extinction flip

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.299 
Transformers form age of extinction flip
and<00:00:05.460> change<00:00:05.700> Grimlock<00:00:06.180> figure<00:00:06.569> I'm<00:00:07.529> not<00:00:07.740> super

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
and change Grimlock figure I'm not super

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:10.580 
and change Grimlock figure I'm not super
excited<00:00:09.030> about<00:00:09.059> this<00:00:09.389> figure<00:00:09.660> I'm<00:00:09.840> when<00:00:10.530> I

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
excited about this figure I'm when I

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.200 
excited about this figure I'm when I
first<00:00:10.830> saw<00:00:10.980> the<00:00:11.040> videos<00:00:11.460> of<00:00:11.639> this<00:00:11.730> thing<00:00:11.969> in

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
first saw the videos of this thing in

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.180 
first saw the videos of this thing in
from<00:00:12.690> Toy<00:00:12.870> Fair<00:00:12.929> but<00:00:13.500> that<00:00:13.620> was<00:00:13.710> actually<00:00:13.830> kind

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
from Toy Fair but that was actually kind

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.680 
from Toy Fair but that was actually kind
of<00:00:14.280> neat<00:00:14.429> but<00:00:14.670> I<00:00:14.849> also<00:00:15.030> kind<00:00:15.330> of<00:00:15.389> thought<00:00:15.540> this

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
of neat but I also kind of thought this

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.570 
of neat but I also kind of thought this
figure<00:00:15.990> would<00:00:16.080> have<00:00:16.230> poseability<00:00:16.680> and<00:00:17.070> that

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
figure would have poseability and that

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:18.830 
figure would have poseability and that
the<00:00:17.820> transformation<00:00:18.510> gimmick<00:00:18.720> would

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
the transformation gimmick would

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.490 
the transformation gimmick would
actually<00:00:19.170> work<00:00:19.410> well<00:00:19.680> and<00:00:20.119> it<00:00:21.119> it<00:00:21.480> doesn't<00:00:21.810> now

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
actually work well and it it doesn't now

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.099 
actually work well and it it doesn't now
here<00:00:22.710> we<00:00:22.800> have<00:00:22.830> the<00:00:23.010> t-rex<00:00:23.460> mode<00:00:23.789> and<00:00:24.109> the

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
here we have the t-rex mode and the

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:26.420 
here we have the t-rex mode and the
sculpting<00:00:25.529> on<00:00:25.650> it's<00:00:25.830> nice<00:00:26.039> but<00:00:26.369> the

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
sculpting on it's nice but the

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.759 
sculpting on it's nice but the
proportions<00:00:27.029> and<00:00:27.269> aren't<00:00:27.689> quite<00:00:28.380> there<00:00:28.710> I

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
proportions and aren't quite there I

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.460 
proportions and aren't quite there I
mean<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.609> upper<00:00:29.820> body<00:00:30.060> over<00:00:30.929> here<00:00:31.109> is<00:00:31.230> nice

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
mean the upper body over here is nice

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.930 
mean the upper body over here is nice
except<00:00:31.859> for<00:00:31.949> this<00:00:32.070> gap<00:00:32.430> right<00:00:32.579> here<00:00:32.700> which

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
except for this gap right here which

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.040 
except for this gap right here which
you're<00:00:33.059> never<00:00:33.210> going<00:00:33.510> to<00:00:33.540> be<00:00:33.630> able<00:00:33.750> to<00:00:33.840> solve

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
you're never going to be able to solve

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.370 
you're never going to be able to solve
no<00:00:34.320> matter<00:00:34.469> what<00:00:34.620> you<00:00:34.710> do<00:00:34.890> and<00:00:36.110> that<00:00:37.110> part

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
no matter what you do and that part

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.229 
no matter what you do and that part
looks<00:00:37.530> nice<00:00:37.800> but<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.460> legs<00:00:38.700> are<00:00:38.820> just<00:00:38.879> too

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
looks nice but the legs are just too

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.510 
looks nice but the legs are just too
long<00:00:39.480> and<00:00:39.780> because<00:00:40.320> this<00:00:40.620> is<00:00:40.860> there<00:00:41.370> in<00:00:41.460> a

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
long and because this is there in a

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:42.920 
long and because this is there in a
robot<00:00:41.790> mode<00:00:41.940> configuration<00:00:42.510> just<00:00:42.719> straight

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
robot mode configuration just straight

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.529 
robot mode configuration just straight
down<00:00:43.170> if<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:44.370> thought<00:00:44.550> had<00:00:44.820> been<00:00:44.850> forward<00:00:45.360> and

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
down if the thought had been forward and

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.450 
down if the thought had been forward and
he<00:00:45.870> could<00:00:46.020> bend<00:00:46.170> his<00:00:46.350> knees<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:46.890> his<00:00:47.010> ankles

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
he could bend his knees and his ankles

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.400 
he could bend his knees and his ankles
skin<00:00:47.670> to<00:00:47.820> a<00:00:47.850> more<00:00:48.120> crouched<00:00:48.899> pose<00:00:49.110> he<00:00:49.289> will

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
skin to a more crouched pose he will

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.770 
skin to a more crouched pose he will
look<00:00:49.469> better<00:00:49.739> but<00:00:49.980> this<00:00:50.160> is<00:00:50.340> like<00:00:50.550> a<00:00:50.820> transfers

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
look better but this is like a transfers

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.150 
look better but this is like a transfers
Rick's<00:00:52.550> stepping<00:00:53.550> on<00:00:53.640> his<00:00:53.760> tippy<00:00:54.059> toes<00:00:54.239> and<00:00:55.160> it

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
Rick's stepping on his tippy toes and it

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.930 
Rick's stepping on his tippy toes and it
just<00:00:56.399> doesn't<00:00:56.660> work<00:00:57.660> very<00:00:57.719> well

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
just doesn't work very well

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.130 
just doesn't work very well
now<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.000> actual<00:01:00.180> transformation<00:01:00.690> can<00:01:01.020> make

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
now the actual transformation can make

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.460 
now the actual transformation can make
you<00:01:01.230> do<00:01:01.350> with<00:01:01.469> this<00:01:01.559> guy<00:01:02.840> it<00:01:03.840> kind<00:01:04.110> of<00:01:04.199> sucks

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
you do with this guy it kind of sucks

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.620 
you do with this guy it kind of sucks
cuz<00:01:04.680> stuff<00:01:04.890> just<00:01:05.040> bangs<00:01:05.309> into<00:01:05.790> other<00:01:06.240> stuff

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
cuz stuff just bangs into other stuff

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:07.850 
cuz stuff just bangs into other stuff
and<00:01:06.840> you<00:01:06.900> can't<00:01:07.140> really<00:01:07.260> see<00:01:07.560> what's

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
and you can't really see what's

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.710 
and you can't really see what's
happening<00:01:08.340> until<00:01:08.520> after<00:01:09.270> it's<00:01:09.390> done<00:01:09.540> now<00:01:09.659> to

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
happening until after it's done now to

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.179 
happening until after it's done now to
start<00:01:10.020> this<00:01:10.140> off<00:01:10.320> you<00:01:10.470> want<00:01:10.619> to<00:01:10.710> rotate<00:01:10.799> these

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
start this off you want to rotate these

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.370 
start this off you want to rotate these
arms<00:01:11.640> up<00:01:12.150> like<00:01:12.450> this<00:01:12.659> because<00:01:12.869> otherwise<00:01:13.170> they

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
arms up like this because otherwise they

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.780 
arms up like this because otherwise they
will<00:01:13.500> get<00:01:13.979> in<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.100> way<00:01:14.130> of<00:01:14.310> everything<00:01:14.580> and

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
will get in the way of everything and

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.330 
will get in the way of everything and
being<00:01:14.939> all<00:01:15.060> over<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.420> place<00:01:16.100> you<00:01:17.100> want<00:01:17.280> to

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
being all over the place you want to

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.460 
being all over the place you want to
split<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:18.270> transference<00:01:18.780> record<00:01:19.170> or<00:01:19.320> else

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
split the transference record or else

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.340 
split the transference record or else
this<00:01:20.150> tab<00:01:21.150> connection<00:01:21.630> right<00:01:21.720> here<00:01:21.780> will<00:01:22.080> keep

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
this tab connection right here will keep

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.200 
this tab connection right here will keep
the<00:01:22.500> transformation<00:01:23.070> from<00:01:23.159> working<00:01:23.580> and<00:01:23.790> just

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
the transformation from working and just

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.969 
the transformation from working and just
hear<00:01:24.360> this<00:01:24.479> awful<00:01:24.960> grinding<00:01:25.350> noise<00:01:25.500> as<00:01:25.770> the

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
hear this awful grinding noise as the

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:26.420 
hear this awful grinding noise as the
ears

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
ears

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.520 
ears
can't<00:01:27.150> actually<00:01:27.450> move<00:01:27.689> past<00:01:27.960> each<00:01:28.110> other<00:01:28.290> and

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
can't actually move past each other and

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.859 
can't actually move past each other and
then<00:01:29.159> you<00:01:29.250> want<00:01:29.400> to<00:01:29.490> split<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:30.030> tail<00:01:30.270> like

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
then you want to split the tail like

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.090 
then you want to split the tail like
this<00:01:31.140> and<00:01:32.360> I<00:01:33.360> don't<00:01:33.689> quite<00:01:34.229> have<00:01:34.439> enough<00:01:34.890> room

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
this and I don't quite have enough room

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.030 
this and I don't quite have enough room
to<00:01:35.130> do<00:01:35.490> this<00:01:35.640> right<00:01:36.060> I'm<00:01:36.570> gonna<00:01:37.049> try<00:01:37.530> but<00:01:37.560> what

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
to do this right I'm gonna try but what

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.490 
to do this right I'm gonna try but what
you<00:01:38.159> do<00:01:38.310> is<00:01:38.460> you<00:01:38.670> just<00:01:38.700> swing<00:01:39.630> him<00:01:39.810> around<00:01:39.840> on

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
you do is you just swing him around on

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.499 
you do is you just swing him around on
this<00:01:40.799> tail<00:01:41.490> like<00:01:41.670> this<00:01:41.700> and<00:01:42.090> what<00:01:42.210> you<00:01:42.299> do<00:01:42.420> is

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
this tail like this and what you do is

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.840 
this tail like this and what you do is
you<00:01:42.600> swing<00:01:42.840> him<00:01:42.960> forward<00:01:43.680> for<00:01:43.920> robot<00:01:44.220> mode<00:01:44.490> and

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
you swing him forward for robot mode and

robot<00:02:02.130> mode<00:02:02.310> and<00:02:02.520> it's<00:02:02.909> just<00:02:03.119> awful<00:02:03.750> and<00:02:03.990> you

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
robot mode and it's just awful and you

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.690 
robot mode and it's just awful and you
can't<00:02:04.469> see<00:02:04.710> what<00:02:04.829> you're<00:02:04.950> doing<00:02:05.009> until<00:02:05.520> it's

can't see what you're doing until it's
done<00:02:06.540> and<00:02:06.869> then<00:02:07.350> when<00:02:07.979> it<00:02:08.099> is<00:02:08.129> done<00:02:08.280> you<00:02:08.759> fold

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
done and then when it is done you fold

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.750 
done and then when it is done you fold
these<00:02:09.149> down<00:02:09.450> like<00:02:09.989> that<00:02:10.170> when<00:02:10.619> it<00:02:10.739> is<00:02:10.890> done<00:02:11.190> the

these down like that when it is done the

these down like that when it is done the
final<00:02:11.970> result<00:02:12.510> is

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
final result is

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.960 
final result is
just<00:02:13.349> kind<00:02:13.620> of<00:02:13.739> ugly<00:02:13.980> because<00:02:14.340> it's<00:02:14.459> not<00:02:14.730> very

here are just so you see screws and the
hidden<00:02:32.730> detail<00:02:33.090> that<00:02:33.300> doesn't<00:02:34.170> look<00:02:34.290> very

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
hidden detail that doesn't look very

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:37.670 
hidden detail that doesn't look very
good<00:02:34.590> just<00:02:34.890> very<00:02:35.099> flat<00:02:35.340> and<00:02:36.530> there's<00:02:37.530> just

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
good just very flat and there's just

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.640 
good just very flat and there's just
nothing<00:02:38.099> to<00:02:38.340> this<00:02:38.640> guy<00:02:38.760> he's<00:02:39.030> just<00:02:39.090> a<00:02:39.360> very

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
nothing to this guy he's just a very

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.830 
nothing to this guy he's just a very
disproportionate<00:02:40.650> mess<00:02:41.660> now<00:02:42.660> for

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
disproportionate mess now for

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.630 
disproportionate mess now for
articulation<00:02:43.290> you<00:02:43.500> do<00:02:43.650> get<00:02:43.860> elbows<00:02:44.190> that<00:02:44.370> Bend

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
articulation you do get elbows that Bend

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.070 
articulation you do get elbows that Bend
and<00:02:45.000> a<00:02:46.519> swivel<00:02:47.519> above<00:02:48.000> the<00:02:48.150> elbow<00:02:48.450> but<00:02:48.720> that's

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
and a swivel above the elbow but that's

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.420 
and a swivel above the elbow but that's
about<00:02:49.290> it<00:02:49.349> you<00:02:49.530> do<00:02:49.680> get<00:02:49.920> this<00:02:50.040> stuff<00:02:50.280> that

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
about it you do get this stuff that

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:51.680 
about it you do get this stuff that
moves<00:02:50.610> around<00:02:50.849> but<00:02:50.970> it's<00:02:51.060> all<00:02:51.150> spring-loaded

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
moves around but it's all spring-loaded

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.150 
moves around but it's all spring-loaded
so<00:02:51.870> you<00:02:51.959> can't<00:02:52.170> do<00:02:52.319> anything<00:02:52.530> with<00:02:52.799> it<00:02:52.829> and

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
so you can't do anything with it and

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.000 
so you can't do anything with it and
it's<00:02:54.090> just<00:02:54.269> overall<00:02:54.630> not<00:02:55.110> a<00:02:55.140> good<00:02:55.500> toy<00:02:55.739> because

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
it's just overall not a good toy because

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.420 
it's just overall not a good toy because
the<00:02:56.510> t-rex<00:02:57.510> pose<00:02:57.780> okay<00:02:58.140> I<00:02:58.170> guess<00:02:58.500> we<00:02:59.010> can't<00:02:59.280> do

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
the t-rex pose okay I guess we can't do

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:00.589 
the t-rex pose okay I guess we can't do
anything<00:02:59.760> with<00:02:59.849> the<00:02:59.970> except<00:03:00.239> move<00:03:00.420> these

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:00.599 
anything with the except move these

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:03.140 
anything with the except move these
little<00:03:00.780> arms<00:03:01.049> the<00:03:01.890> transformation<00:03:02.519> is<00:03:02.640> awful

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
little arms the transformation is awful

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.300 
little arms the transformation is awful
because<00:03:03.530> stuff<00:03:04.530> just<00:03:04.739> bangs<00:03:04.920> into<00:03:05.130> other

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
because stuff just bangs into other

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:06.979 
because stuff just bangs into other
stuff<00:03:05.489> it<00:03:05.640> doesn't<00:03:05.790> work<00:03:06.120> it<00:03:06.390> literally<00:03:06.660> does

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
stuff it doesn't work it literally does

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:09.289 
stuff it doesn't work it literally does
not<00:03:07.230> work<00:03:07.680> and<00:03:08.400> then<00:03:08.549> the<00:03:08.610> robot<00:03:08.849> mode<00:03:09.030> looks

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:09.299 
not work and then the robot mode looks

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:12.559 
not work and then the robot mode looks
bad<00:03:09.870> and<00:03:10.200> it's<00:03:10.819> you<00:03:11.819> can't<00:03:12.030> do<00:03:12.150> anything<00:03:12.360> with

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:12.569 
bad and it's you can't do anything with

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:13.910 
bad and it's you can't do anything with
it<00:03:12.690> either<00:03:12.810> except<00:03:13.170> for<00:03:13.290> remove<00:03:13.560> the<00:03:13.739> tiny

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
it either except for remove the tiny

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.550 
it either except for remove the tiny
arms<00:03:14.250> again<00:03:14.519> so<00:03:14.819> there<00:03:15.540> is<00:03:15.660> nothing<00:03:16.019> redeeming

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
arms again so there is nothing redeeming

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.440 
arms again so there is nothing redeeming
about<00:03:16.650> this<00:03:16.890> figure<00:03:17.130> I<00:03:17.250> do<00:03:17.340> not<00:03:17.760> recommend<00:03:18.120> it

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
about this figure I do not recommend it

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.930 
about this figure I do not recommend it
especially<00:03:19.200> not<00:03:19.680> for<00:03:19.920> it's<00:03:20.160> a<00:03:20.340> price<00:03:20.700> point

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
especially not for it's a price point

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:25.789 
especially not for it's a price point
like<00:03:21.680> I<00:03:22.680> don't<00:03:23.220> have<00:03:23.430> them<00:03:23.579> here<00:03:23.609> but<00:03:24.200> the<00:03:25.200> one

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 
like I don't have them here but the one

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:27.170 
like I don't have them here but the one
step<00:03:26.040> change<00:03:26.280> Verma<00:03:26.579> is<00:03:26.700> a<00:03:26.760> much<00:03:27.000> better

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
step change Verma is a much better

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.970 
step change Verma is a much better
figure<00:03:27.389> a<00:03:27.480> much<00:03:27.870> better<00:03:28.139> price<00:03:28.470> so<00:03:28.829> I'd

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
figure a much better price so I'd

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.370 
figure a much better price so I'd
recommend<00:03:29.459> that<00:03:29.519> way<00:03:30.359> more<00:03:30.690> than<00:03:30.870> I<00:03:30.930> recommend

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
recommend that way more than I recommend

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.650 
recommend that way more than I recommend
this<00:03:31.790> anyway<00:03:32.790> um<00:03:33.000> there's<00:03:33.329> been<00:03:33.359> a<00:03:33.510> video

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
this anyway um there's been a video
