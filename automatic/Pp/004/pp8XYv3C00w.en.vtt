bought<00:02:15.310> it<00:02:15.460> at<00:02:15.550> Old<00:02:15.760> Navy<00:02:15.850> but<00:02:16.480> it<00:02:16.810> kind<00:02:17.620> of

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
bought it at Old Navy but it kind of

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.830 
bought it at Old Navy but it kind of
tends<00:02:17.950> to<00:02:18.160> wear<00:02:18.310> off<00:02:18.520> really<00:02:18.880> fast<00:02:19.150> but<00:02:19.510> I'm

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
tends to wear off really fast but I'm

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.750 
tends to wear off really fast but I'm
just<00:02:20.050> going<00:02:20.230> to<00:02:20.290> shape<00:02:20.560> my<00:02:20.800> nails<00:02:20.830> that<00:02:21.370> I<00:02:21.490> used

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
just going to shape my nails that I used

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.970 
just going to shape my nails that I used
to<00:02:21.910> like<00:02:22.090> them<00:02:22.300> squared<00:02:22.780> off<00:02:23.080> but<00:02:23.650> I<00:02:23.800> actually

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
to like them squared off but I actually

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.800 
to like them squared off but I actually
prefer<00:02:24.190> them<00:02:24.700> rounded<00:02:25.030> off<00:02:25.180> because<00:02:25.420> it<00:02:25.630> makes

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
prefer them rounded off because it makes

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.200 
prefer them rounded off because it makes
my<00:02:25.990> hands<00:02:26.290> look<00:02:26.710> a<00:02:26.890> lot<00:02:27.220> more<00:02:27.400> feminine<00:02:28.030> and
