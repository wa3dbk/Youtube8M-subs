nothing's going out of this bathroom so
which<00:00:14.340> I<00:00:14.490> like<00:00:15.109> this<00:00:16.109> you<00:00:16.529> know<00:00:16.619> our<00:00:16.710> sink<00:00:17.010> goes

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
which I like this you know our sink goes

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.340 
which I like this you know our sink goes
directly<00:00:18.029> out<00:00:18.240> and<00:00:18.510> water<00:00:18.720> is<00:00:18.900> a<00:00:18.930> pomegranate

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
directly out and water is a pomegranate

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.720 
directly out and water is a pomegranate
and<00:00:19.830> a<00:00:19.890> Kiwi<00:00:21.980> this<00:00:22.980> is<00:00:23.100> a<00:00:23.130> composting<00:00:23.699> toilet

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
and a Kiwi this is a composting toilet

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.640 
and a Kiwi this is a composting toilet
so<00:00:24.150> it<00:00:24.240> uses<00:00:24.390> no<00:00:24.750> water<00:00:24.990> which<00:00:25.230> is<00:00:25.410> really

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
so it uses no water which is really

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.349 
so it uses no water which is really
great<00:00:25.800> because<00:00:25.859> you<00:00:26.340> cannot<00:00:26.609> reuse<00:00:26.820> toilet

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
great because you cannot reuse toilet

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.000 
great because you cannot reuse toilet
water<00:00:27.539> and<00:00:27.810> there's<00:00:28.050> also<00:00:28.199> no<00:00:28.439> reason<00:00:28.470> to<00:00:28.890> use

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
water and there's also no reason to use

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.380 
water and there's also no reason to use
fresh<00:00:29.250> drinking<00:00:29.640> water<00:00:29.670> to<00:00:30.000> deal<00:00:30.179> with

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
fresh drinking water to deal with

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.770 
fresh drinking water to deal with
sanitation<00:00:31.700> you<00:00:32.700> can<00:00:32.850> buy<00:00:33.149> composting

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
sanitation you can buy composting

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.510 
sanitation you can buy composting
toilets<00:00:34.110> this<00:00:34.290> is<00:00:34.440> a<00:00:34.469> built<00:00:34.770> one<00:00:35.010> this<00:00:35.280> is<00:00:35.489> a

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
toilets this is a built one this is a

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.010 
toilets this is a built one this is a
urine<00:00:35.850> diverting<00:00:36.239> toilet<00:00:36.540> which<00:00:36.660> is<00:00:36.809> really

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
urine diverting toilet which is really

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.660 
urine diverting toilet which is really
important<00:00:37.410> because<00:00:37.469> it<00:00:37.710> makes<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:38.129> process<00:00:38.340> a

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
important because it makes the process a

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.910 
important because it makes the process a
lot<00:00:38.790> easier<00:00:38.850> it<00:00:39.570> has<00:00:39.750> a<00:00:39.780> urine<00:00:40.559> diverting

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
lot easier it has a urine diverting

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.740 
lot easier it has a urine diverting
insert<00:00:41.309> and<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.850> urine<00:00:42.149> goes<00:00:42.180> into<00:00:42.719> a

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
insert and the urine goes into a

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.600 
insert and the urine goes into a
container<00:00:43.170> separate<00:00:43.649> from<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:43.920> feces<00:00:44.309> and

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
container separate from the feces and

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.970 
container separate from the feces and
urine<00:00:44.670> is<00:00:45.450> typically<00:00:46.110> sterile<00:00:46.559> and<00:00:46.739> you<00:00:46.800> can

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
urine is typically sterile and you can

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:47.810 
urine is typically sterile and you can
use<00:00:47.129> it<00:00:47.309> right<00:00:47.460> away

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
use it right away

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.000 
use it right away
you<00:00:48.239> dilute<00:00:48.510> it<00:00:48.600> with<00:00:48.629> water<00:00:48.750> and<00:00:49.230> it's<00:00:49.350> a<00:00:49.500> high

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
you dilute it with water and it's a high

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:57.500 
you dilute it with water and it's a high
quality<00:00:50.070> nitrogen<00:00:50.820> fertilizer<00:00:56.030> we<00:00:57.030> installed

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
quality nitrogen fertilizer we installed

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.000 
quality nitrogen fertilizer we installed
an<00:00:57.660> outlet<00:00:58.050> right<00:00:58.199> here<00:00:58.260> in<00:00:58.530> case<00:00:58.710> there<00:00:58.920> ever

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
an outlet right here in case there ever

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.470 
an outlet right here in case there ever
were<00:00:59.309> odor<00:00:59.489> problems<00:00:59.969> we<00:01:00.120> could<00:01:00.239> put<00:01:00.420> an

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
were odor problems we could put an

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.029 
were odor problems we could put an
electric<00:01:00.899> fan<00:01:01.079> because<00:01:01.379> a<00:01:01.410> lot<00:01:01.649> of<00:01:01.770> people

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
electric fan because a lot of people

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.340 
electric fan because a lot of people
will<00:01:02.219> have<00:01:02.370> an<00:01:02.489> electric<00:01:02.850> fan<00:01:03.059> but<00:01:03.629> we've<00:01:03.780> so

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
will have an electric fan but we've so

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.140 
will have an electric fan but we've so
far<00:01:04.379> it's<00:01:04.739> been<00:01:04.830> a<00:01:04.949> couple<00:01:05.280> of<00:01:05.489> years<00:01:05.760> we've

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
far it's been a couple of years we've

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.020 
far it's been a couple of years we've
not<00:01:06.360> needed<00:01:06.890> if<00:01:07.890> you're<00:01:08.460> building<00:01:08.640> a<00:01:08.880> new

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
not needed if you're building a new

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.210 
not needed if you're building a new
structure<00:01:09.299> you<00:01:09.869> can<00:01:10.049> have<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.470> same<00:01:10.680> concept

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
structure you can have the same concept

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.609 
structure you can have the same concept
with<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:12.000> chambers<00:01:12.420> below<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.810> building<00:01:13.470> so

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
with the chambers below the building so

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.170 
with the chambers below the building so
you<00:01:13.740> it's<00:01:13.950> not<00:01:14.070> in<00:01:14.280> your<00:01:14.400> living<00:01:14.700> space<00:01:14.820> that's

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
you it's not in your living space that's

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.450 
you it's not in your living space that's
more<00:01:15.390> ideal<00:01:15.750> and<00:01:16.020> if<00:01:16.530> it's<00:01:16.710> sized<00:01:16.890> properly

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
more ideal and if it's sized properly

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.130 
more ideal and if it's sized properly
you<00:01:17.790> can<00:01:17.939> have<00:01:18.090> two<00:01:18.270> different<00:01:18.299> chambers<00:01:18.750> so

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
you can have two different chambers so

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.080 
you can have two different chambers so
when<00:01:19.350> when<00:01:20.100> one<00:01:20.250> is<00:01:20.340> all<00:01:20.460> you<00:01:20.610> just<00:01:20.700> move<00:01:20.939> to

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
when when one is all you just move to

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.340 
when when one is all you just move to
the<00:01:21.119> other<00:01:21.299> and<00:01:21.630> so<00:01:21.750> you'll<00:01:21.900> need<00:01:21.990> to<00:01:22.140> do<00:01:22.229> like

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
the other and so you'll need to do like

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.039 
the other and so you'll need to do like
yearly<00:01:22.710> maintenance<00:01:22.890> in<00:01:23.729> this<00:01:24.049> situation

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
yearly maintenance in this situation

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.200 
yearly maintenance in this situation
there's<00:01:25.200> two<00:01:25.380> collection<00:01:26.210> receptacles

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
there's two collection receptacles

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.170 
there's two collection receptacles
beneath<00:01:27.540> it<00:01:27.720> and<00:01:27.900> so<00:01:28.320> these<00:01:28.950> are<00:01:29.369> removed<00:01:29.970> and

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
beneath it and so these are removed and

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.819 
beneath it and so these are removed and
emptied<00:01:30.479> into<00:01:30.630> larger<00:01:31.110> containers<00:01:31.590> so<00:01:31.710> the

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
emptied into larger containers so the

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.069 
emptied into larger containers so the
feces<00:01:32.189> there's<00:01:32.369> a<00:01:32.430> larger<00:01:32.909> feces<00:01:33.600> collection

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
feces there's a larger feces collection

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.929 
feces there's a larger feces collection
outside<00:01:34.229> that's<00:01:34.710> bent<00:01:34.979> it<00:01:35.159> and<00:01:35.340> kind<00:01:35.909> of

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
outside that's bent it and kind of

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.219 
outside that's bent it and kind of
separate<00:01:37.549> so<00:01:38.549> this<00:01:38.790> is<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.270> door<00:01:39.630> for

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
separate so this is the door for

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.929 
separate so this is the door for
servicing<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:40.770> composting<00:01:41.250> toilet<00:01:41.549> so<00:01:41.729> we

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
servicing the composting toilet so we

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.190 
servicing the composting toilet so we
need<00:01:42.150> to<00:01:42.210> open<00:01:42.390> it<00:01:42.479> up<00:01:42.600> and<00:01:42.720> then<00:01:42.810> you<00:01:42.869> can<00:01:43.020> pull

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
need to open it up and then you can pull

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.770 
need to open it up and then you can pull
out<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.350> containers<00:01:44.220> this<00:01:45.030> is<00:01:45.210> where<00:01:45.390> we<00:01:45.479> put

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
out the containers this is where we put

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.469 
out the containers this is where we put
the<00:01:46.290> feces<00:01:46.799> to<00:01:47.009> compost<00:01:47.430> it<00:01:47.579> has<00:01:47.759> netting<00:01:48.180> so

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
the feces to compost it has netting so

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.420 
the feces to compost it has netting so
flies<00:01:48.720> shouldn't<00:01:49.680> go<00:01:49.890> in<00:01:50.040> there

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
flies shouldn't go in there

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.280
