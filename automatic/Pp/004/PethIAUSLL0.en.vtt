00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:11.020

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:13.240
 to my as well as announced three live 

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:15.850
 I'm with peace train or evonik her 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.410
 number four and you at green day 

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:19.030
 see her in this video I could have 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:20.740
 No signs at all 

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:26.770
 That's why this trauma life will be 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:31.270
 we call it special as a small one 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:32.259
 info for the start I'm on 28/11 1995 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:34.570
 born 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:37.410
 at three o'clock in the morning and how it feels 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:42.520
 presenting in a hospital 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:44.860
 unbelievable as it already was then 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.150
 In social studies lessons I learned was 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.790
 Of course, on a normal 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:51.730
 Wise born with two parents 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:54.610
 father a mother a bed nine 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:01:00.850
 months and thanks to my character arts 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:01:02.380
 I look like a little dildo like 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.239
 it's from my current let's play 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:06.219
 I already knew of course 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:08.920
 then as a little kid with a whole two 

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:12.130
 years already very adventurous 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:14.500
 We had a very high sofa and me 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:16.860
 thought to me and asked me what would happen 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:19.180
 I would jump down there 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.090
 Short time later I got the answer 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:26.049
 my arm was broken and broken in 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:29.070
 that was the case even then 

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:29.070
 already a little genie 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.090
 of course I was experimental 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.490
 as a small child, that's why 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.930
 I have also in the tender 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.930
 kindergarten age in the sandbox small 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:42.520
 Sand cake was built but also became direct 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:45.130
 already moved away from my mother with 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.830
 the volleyball I prefer that 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.600
 should not eat and this taste 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.830
 but unfortunately had to stay denied 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.479
 what a shame 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.640
 Do you know how his cake tastes? 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:56.590
 write me the comments roughly 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.210
 summarized, one can say that I am 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.070
 actually a normal childhood 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.740
 and not me like this 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:05.020
 depicted dressed in women's clothes 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.780
 or me somehow the somehow 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.099
 and if not 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.739
 I saw that this was a women's dress 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:14.100
 that is definitely up to you and 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:16.440
 Do not work on my sign 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.730
 that's how elementary school became 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.560
 Of course everything is a bit too 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.230
 more exciting as you knew it in the 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.570
 Elementary school was the biggest hit pokemon 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.820
 cards or yu gi oh cards or 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.960
 other magic card or any 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.280
 cards in any case 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.740
 and i have to say i had that time 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.810
 an incredibly plump and thick 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:37.260
 filled pokemon folder 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:40.110
 I had felt almost everything I had 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.910
 almost everything, of course, next to the pokÃ©mon 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.430
 cards I also have the world of 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:47.840
 discovered and got me with 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:53.250
 consoles like ps1's sns ps2 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:55.320
 the gamecube and the n64 are serviced and me 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.960
 I'll think about that as a job later 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:00.960
 consoles sketches creator because like you 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:03.530
 look unbeatable or I mean this 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:06.290
 This approach to the console makes this easy 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:08.670
 Wow 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:11.040
 of course, my life was also through 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:14.280
 an incredible turn of events 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:17.340
 namely by the split up of my parents 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.960
 was Abraham but honestly that was 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.460
 not so bad for me and 

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:21.270
 I can handle it very well because mine 

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:23.760
 Parents still have a good relationship 

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:25.620
 and that's why I still do 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.230
 where do I want to go to that? 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.700
 each parent can go and how 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:33.390
 which could look like was the small one 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.920
 jannik also slowly big with that would be 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:37.050
 Primary school age actually already 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:40.160
 finished and it went on to the 

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:42.840
 unbelievably large school the gymnasium 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.340
 which I'm still on at the moment 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.310
 I'm in high school I never go 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:49.050
 I imagine purely from the roof and it was 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.330
 a big change for me because of me 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:52.830
 the gymnasium has to be like this 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.690
 picture already can see shaped 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:58.320
 through a lot of severe breaks books 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:04:02.880
 and so on and so forth and that was 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:05.130
 In any case, completely stupid and now comes 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:07.800
 the real incredible story 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:10.170
 how little jannik now to the 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:12.240
 be big gigantic never mind that 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:13.380
 besides, he has little contis brain now 

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:14.910
 was just listening 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:17.700
 It started with a little story 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:19.260
 that I'm in with my buddy Niklas 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:21.060
 there was one in my room 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:23.820
 carnivorous plant was and I too 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:25.050
 told him to tackle him and he 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:33.300
 answer 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:34.919
 how high as fate would have it 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.479
 of course, came a short time later too 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:38.280
 already my father rhine and said use 

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:39.599
 us yes you can up here with yours 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.879
 Of course, rooms do everything you want 

00:04:39.599 --> 00:04:44.400
 you want to have you guessed but almost 

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:44.819
 just not the carnivorous plant 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:49.340
 on 

00:04:44.819 --> 00:04:56.789
 yes , we will never do it 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:59.009
 father no and on this lan happened 

00:04:56.789 --> 00:05:02.039
 then the moment in which you niklas 

00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:05.580
 showed wedel tales injured place or 

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:07.139
 also lps on youtube and i was 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.099
 of course completely perplexed and thought 

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:10.379
 me wow 

00:05:08.099 --> 00:05:12.180
 He may be commenting on a game play 

00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:15.139
 and then upload it to this platform 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:20.460
 youtube high I can actually 

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:23.340
 and so had then attracted 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:25.319
 that on the fourth of april, it's me 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:27.719
 put the pc in the middle of the night 

00:05:25.319 --> 00:05:30.419
 my parents were sleeping and me 

00:05:27.719 --> 00:05:33.830
 sat down in front of the pc and told me now 

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:33.830
 is the beginning of an era 

00:05:34.219 --> 00:05:40.050
 In any case, I sat in front of the pc and 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:42.120
 maybe already on forests - cap 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:44.759
 started and still quite shaky 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:49.020
 sat in front of the pc and slowly the 

00:05:44.759 --> 00:05:54.900
 first words hello in the microphone 

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:57.090
 whispered yes and that's it already 

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:59.099
 with my dream alive I know it is 

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:00.779
 maybe not as exciting as 

00:05:59.099 --> 00:06:02.729
 other drama live the somehow one 

00:06:00.779 --> 00:06:05.610

 like a crippled penis with 

00:06:17.129 --> 00:06:21.270
 fingering it but that's beside the point 

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:22.050
