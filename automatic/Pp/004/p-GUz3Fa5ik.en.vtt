00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:24.690 
I gain of the review the only stuff

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.160 
I gain of the review the only stuff
that's<00:01:24.960> really<00:01:25.190> stays<00:01:26.190> on<00:01:26.460> if<00:01:27.090> in<00:01:27.630> vehicle

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
that's really stays on if in vehicle

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.970 
that's really stays on if in vehicle
mode<00:01:28.350> is<00:01:28.620> the<00:01:28.860> chest<00:01:29.160> can<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:30.300> head<00:01:30.480> can<00:01:30.980> and

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:31.980 
mode is the chest can the head can and

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:36.800 
mode is the chest can the head can and
one<00:01:32.880> of<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.240> knee<00:01:33.510> pads<00:01:33.870> can<00:01:34.410> I<00:01:35.600> believe<00:01:36.600> it's

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
one of the knee pads can I believe it's

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.680 
one of the knee pads can I believe it's
this<00:01:37.290> one<00:01:37.530> but<00:01:38.150> we'll<00:01:39.150> get<00:01:39.270> into<00:01:39.390> that<00:01:39.540> later

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:39.690 
this one but we'll get into that later

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:41.960 
this one but we'll get into that later
so<00:01:40.500> it's<00:01:40.950> definitely<00:01:41.550> something<00:01:41.760> worth

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
so it's definitely something worth

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.280 
so it's definitely something worth
picking<00:01:42.180> up<00:01:42.360> if<00:01:42.600> you're<00:01:42.780> going<00:01:43.110> to<00:01:43.170> be

works<00:03:22.389> with<00:03:22.540> the<00:03:22.629> shield<00:03:22.840> either<00:03:23.019> way<00:03:23.199> I<00:03:23.440> just

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:23.739 
works with the shield either way I just

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:24.839 
works with the shield either way I just
thought<00:03:23.889> it<00:03:24.010> looked<00:03:24.159> kind<00:03:24.400> of<00:03:24.459> cool<00:03:24.639> because

00:03:24.839 --> 00:03:24.849 
thought it looked kind of cool because

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:26.309 
thought it looked kind of cool because
it<00:03:25.389> makes<00:03:25.599> it<00:03:25.750> look<00:03:25.840> like<00:03:25.870> it<00:03:26.199> was<00:03:26.229> a

00:03:26.309 --> 00:03:26.319 
it makes it look like it was a

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:30.059 
it makes it look like it was a
three-wheeled<00:03:26.829> vehicle<00:03:27.340> and<00:03:28.440> robot<00:03:29.440> mode<00:03:29.650> per

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
vehicle mode the shield has a peg that's

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.129 
vehicle mode the shield has a peg that's
going<00:03:34.720> to<00:03:34.810> fit<00:03:34.989> right<00:03:35.409> into<00:03:35.590> the<00:03:35.739> groove<00:03:35.919> here

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:37.139 
going to fit right into the groove here

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:47.309 
going to fit right into the groove here
so<00:03:38.139> pop<00:03:38.620> that<00:03:38.650> on<00:03:42.989> next<00:03:43.989> up<00:03:44.609> the<00:03:45.609> chest<00:03:46.319> which

to<00:04:18.900> give<00:04:19.890> dual<00:04:20.760> wield<00:04:21.000> or<00:04:21.239> I<00:04:21.650> decided<00:04:22.650> just<00:04:22.800> to

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:22.980 
to give dual wield or I decided just to

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:24.770 
to give dual wield or I decided just to
leave<00:04:23.160> the<00:04:23.280> exhaust<00:04:23.610> attached<00:04:24.030> it<00:04:24.480> gives<00:04:24.690> them

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
leave the exhaust attached it gives them
