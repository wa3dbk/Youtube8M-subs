00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
have to get a new crease fitting pretty

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.550

soon<00:01:52.630> but<00:01:53.630> what<00:01:53.750> I'm<00:01:53.840> going<00:01:53.960> to<00:01:53.990> do<00:01:54.170> is<00:01:54.350> take

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:54.560 
soon but what I'm going to do is take

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.560 
soon but what I'm going to do is take
this<00:01:55.840> plate<00:01:56.840> here<00:01:57.470> side<00:01:58.310> plate<00:01:58.610> off<00:01:58.940> that

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 
this plate here side plate off that

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:04.440 
this plate here side plate off that
machine<00:01:59.720> and<00:02:00.140> put<00:02:00.290> it<00:02:00.410> onto<00:02:00.560> this<00:02:00.830> old<00:02:01.160> machine

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.100 

because<00:02:06.040> this<00:02:07.040> is<00:02:07.340> the<00:02:07.520> old<00:02:07.760> age<00:02:08.330> side<00:02:08.750> plate

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
because this is the old age side plate

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.180 
because this is the old age side plate
and<00:02:09.410> you<00:02:09.830> can<00:02:09.979> see<00:02:10.190> the<00:02:10.460> hole<00:02:11.290> is<00:02:12.290> not<00:02:12.890> round

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
and you can see the hole is not round

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:18.850 
and you can see the hole is not round
anymore<00:02:14.560> it's<00:02:15.560> pretty<00:02:15.980> worn<00:02:16.340> I<00:02:17.620> suspect<00:02:18.620> it's

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
anymore it's pretty worn I suspect it's

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:25.020 
anymore it's pretty worn I suspect it's
probably<00:02:19.250> because<00:02:19.460> nobody<00:02:20.060> ever<00:02:20.300> greeted

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.210
