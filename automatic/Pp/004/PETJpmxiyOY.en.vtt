00:00:44.099 --> 00:00:44.109 
that too anyway here's the real issue or

that too anyway here's the real issue or
here's<00:00:44.320> the<00:00:44.410> real<00:00:44.559> item<00:00:44.710> we're<00:00:44.859> looking<00:00:45.129> at

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:45.250 
here's the real item we're looking at

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.869 
here's the real item we're looking at
this<00:00:46.120> is<00:00:46.239> the<00:00:46.359> actual<00:00:46.660> cable<00:00:47.579> as<00:00:48.579> you<00:00:48.609> can<00:00:48.789> see

00:00:48.869 --> 00:00:48.879 
this is the actual cable as you can see

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:50.400 
this is the actual cable as you can see
looks<00:00:49.030> like<00:00:49.059> a<00:00:49.180> normal<00:00:49.329> internet<00:00:49.750> cable<00:00:50.230> a

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:50.410 
looks like a normal internet cable a

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:51.959 
looks like a normal internet cable a
couple<00:00:50.920> exceptions<00:00:51.219> it's<00:00:51.640> got<00:00:51.789> these

00:00:51.959 --> 00:00:51.969 
couple exceptions it's got these

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:56.400 
couple exceptions it's got these
removable<00:00:52.870> blue<00:00:53.469> clips<00:00:53.920> here<00:00:54.960> they<00:00:55.960> just<00:00:55.989> kind

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:56.410 
removable blue clips here they just kind

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:58.919 
removable blue clips here they just kind
of<00:00:56.469> pull<00:00:56.679> off<00:00:57.090> so<00:00:58.090> you<00:00:58.149> can<00:00:58.359> replace<00:00:58.600> them<00:00:58.870> with

00:00:58.919 --> 00:00:58.929 
of pull off so you can replace them with

00:00:58.929 --> 00:01:00.930 
of pull off so you can replace them with
different<00:00:59.109> colors<00:00:59.500> to<00:00:59.710> indicate<00:01:00.460> different

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:00.940 
different colors to indicate different

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.170 
different colors to indicate different
stuff<00:01:01.210> on<00:01:01.390> your<00:01:01.480> network<00:01:01.809> and<00:01:02.050> whatnot

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
stuff on your network and whatnot

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.810 
stuff on your network and whatnot
they've<00:01:04.180> got<00:01:04.540> these<00:01:04.780> coil<00:01:05.530> spring<00:01:05.950> strain

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:06.820 
they've got these coil spring strain

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.240 
they've got these coil spring strain
reliefs<00:01:07.150> which<00:01:07.390> I'm<00:01:07.570> not<00:01:07.930> too<00:01:08.140> fond<00:01:08.770> of<00:01:08.920> not

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250 
reliefs which I'm not too fond of not

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:10.740 
reliefs which I'm not too fond of not
because<00:01:09.580> they<00:01:09.910> don't<00:01:10.060> function<00:01:10.420> right<00:01:10.690> I

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
because they don't function right I

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.320 
because they don't function right I
think<00:01:11.080> they<00:01:11.170> function<00:01:11.530> okay<00:01:12.000> but<00:01:13.000> they're

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:13.330 
think they function okay but they're

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.690 
think they function okay but they're
like<00:01:13.600> these<00:01:13.720> metal<00:01:14.020> springs<00:01:14.350> and<00:01:14.710> you<00:01:15.490> know<00:01:15.610> it

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:15.700 
like these metal springs and you know it

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.610 
like these metal springs and you know it
seems<00:01:16.150> kind<00:01:16.330> of<00:01:16.420> overkill<00:01:16.840> there's<00:01:17.230> really<00:01:17.410> no

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:17.620 
seems kind of overkill there's really no

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:19.170 
seems kind of overkill there's really no
reason<00:01:17.770> you<00:01:18.070> need<00:01:18.250> that<00:01:18.430> this<00:01:18.610> is<00:01:18.730> an<00:01:18.850> ordinary

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:19.180 
reason you need that this is an ordinary

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.270 
reason you need that this is an ordinary
cat<00:01:19.900> 5<00:01:20.140> or<00:01:20.170> cat<00:01:20.770> 6<00:01:21.420> rj45<00:01:22.420> connector<00:01:22.900> and<00:01:23.140> a

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
cat 5 or cat 6 rj45 connector and a

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.910 
cat 5 or cat 6 rj45 connector and a
pretty<00:01:24.280> robust<00:01:25.110> sleeve<00:01:26.110> here<00:01:26.410> at<00:01:26.500> the<00:01:26.590> end<00:01:26.740> of

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:26.920 
pretty robust sleeve here at the end of

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.070 
pretty robust sleeve here at the end of
it<00:01:27.070> so<00:01:28.060> I'm<00:01:28.180> not<00:01:28.300> really<00:01:28.450> sure<00:01:28.660> that<00:01:28.690> this<00:01:28.930> is

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:29.080 
it so I'm not really sure that this is

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.680 
it so I'm not really sure that this is
totally<00:01:29.350> unnecessary<00:01:29.940> items<00:01:30.940> who<00:01:31.240> have<00:01:31.360> added

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:31.690 
totally unnecessary items who have added

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:33.780 
totally unnecessary items who have added
on<00:01:31.810> there<00:01:32.020> I<00:01:32.500> would<00:01:33.100> have<00:01:33.220> liked<00:01:33.400> to<00:01:33.520> maybe

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:33.790 
on there I would have liked to maybe

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:35.460 
on there I would have liked to maybe
ditch<00:01:34.000> that<00:01:34.270> and<00:01:34.510> maybe<00:01:34.810> pass<00:01:35.080> on<00:01:35.260> some

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:35.470 
ditch that and maybe pass on some

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:36.810 
ditch that and maybe pass on some
savings<00:01:35.860> to<00:01:35.950> the<00:01:36.070> end<00:01:36.220> user<00:01:36.430> because<00:01:36.670> these

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:36.820 
savings to the end user because these

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.700 
savings to the end user because these
are<00:01:36.970> pretty<00:01:37.120> expensive<00:01:37.480> I<00:01:37.780> think<00:01:37.810> this<00:01:38.140> 1.2

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710 
are pretty expensive I think this 1.2

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.130 
are pretty expensive I think this 1.2
meter<00:01:39.040> cable<00:01:39.280> is<00:01:40.060> probably<00:01:40.390> 7<00:01:40.720> or<00:01:40.810> 8<00:01:40.960> bucks

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.140 
meter cable is probably 7 or 8 bucks

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.650 
meter cable is probably 7 or 8 bucks
something<00:01:41.470> like<00:01:41.590> that<00:01:42.210> doesn't<00:01:43.210> sound<00:01:43.450> too

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:43.660 
something like that doesn't sound too

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:45.420 
something like that doesn't sound too
bad<00:01:43.690> and<00:01:44.080> so<00:01:44.170> you<00:01:44.230> need<00:01:44.410> about<00:01:44.650> 48<00:01:45.190> of<00:01:45.310> them

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:45.430 
bad and so you need about 48 of them

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:46.950 
bad and so you need about 48 of them
maybe<00:01:45.610> a<00:01:45.760> hundred<00:01:45.940> of<00:01:46.120> them<00:01:46.210> maybe<00:01:46.360> 200<00:01:46.870> of

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
maybe a hundred of them maybe 200 of

slightly more than a dollar maybe
slightly<00:01:58.180> less<00:01:58.270> depending<00:01:58.690> on<00:01:58.750> the<00:01:58.840> bond<00:01:58.960> you

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
slightly less depending on the bond you

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.190 
slightly less depending on the bond you
buy<00:01:59.230> him<00:01:59.350> but<00:01:59.890> anyway<00:02:00.100> um<00:02:00.540> yeah<00:02:01.540> so<00:02:01.780> about<00:02:01.870> 8

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
buy him but anyway um yeah so about 8

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.380 
buy him but anyway um yeah so about 8

it on at the backside of the rj45 I

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.160 
it on at the backside of the rj45 I
guess<00:02:35.800> I<00:02:35.890> didn't<00:02:36.100> plug<00:02:36.220> that<00:02:36.310> in<00:02:36.900> on<00:02:37.900> the

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
guess I didn't plug that in on the

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:39.660 
guess I didn't plug that in on the

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
and switch lenses and show you that the

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
other end of this this cable here lights

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:49.440 
other end of this this cable here lights
up<00:02:46.450> so<00:02:46.989> it's<00:02:47.980> a<00:02:48.130> real<00:02:48.280> easy<00:02:48.310> way<00:02:48.760> to<00:02:48.820> identify

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
up so it's a real easy way to identify

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:50.940 
up so it's a real easy way to identify
the<00:02:49.510> patch<00:02:49.810> cables<00:02:50.230> in<00:02:50.290> your<00:02:50.380> environment

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
the patch cables in your environment

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.540 
the patch cables in your environment
I<00:02:51.180> only<00:02:52.180> it<00:02:52.660> only<00:02:52.780> really<00:02:53.160> would<00:02:54.160> work<00:02:54.340> out

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
I only it only really would work out

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:56.729 
I only it only really would work out
into<00:02:54.910> someone's<00:02:55.330> advantage<00:02:55.690> for<00:02:56.350> like<00:02:56.500> a<00:02:56.530> real

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739 
into someone's advantage for like a real

a rack with you know an office building

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.020 
a rack with you know an office building
that<00:03:00.010> has<00:03:00.190> a<00:03:00.220> lot<00:03:00.430> of<00:03:00.459> drops

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
that has a lot of drops

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.530 
that has a lot of drops
I<00:03:01.060> work<00:03:01.540> in<00:03:01.660> data<00:03:01.930> centers<00:03:02.230> mostly<00:03:02.530> anymore<00:03:02.890> so

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
I work in data centers mostly anymore so

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.970 
I work in data centers mostly anymore so
we<00:03:04.769> have<00:03:05.769> all<00:03:06.190> our<00:03:06.220> cabling<00:03:06.760> within<00:03:07.060> one<00:03:07.269> rack

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
we have all our cabling within one rack

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.080 
we have all our cabling within one rack
not<00:03:08.980> to<00:03:09.130> say<00:03:09.250> we<00:03:09.370> don't<00:03:09.430> have<00:03:09.519> multiple<00:03:09.700> racks

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
not to say we don't have multiple racks

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:11.790 
not to say we don't have multiple racks
but<00:03:10.390> we<00:03:10.540> rarely<00:03:10.720> go<00:03:11.019> up<00:03:11.170> and<00:03:11.350> over<00:03:11.590> and<00:03:11.739> we

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:11.800 
but we rarely go up and over and we

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.590 
but we rarely go up and over and we
definitely<00:03:12.459> don't<00:03:12.730> really<00:03:13.030> work<00:03:13.269> with<00:03:13.390> patch

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:13.600 
definitely don't really work with patch

definitely don't really work with patch

as<00:03:29.290> like<00:03:29.470> an<00:03:30.040> office<00:03:30.370> building<00:03:30.489> who's

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
as like an office building who's

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.460 
as like an office building who's
constantly<00:03:31.000> moving<00:03:31.450> employees<00:03:31.930> and<00:03:32.110> patching

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
constantly moving employees and patching

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:34.440 
constantly moving employees and patching
you<00:03:32.650> know<00:03:32.769> and<00:03:33.040> doing<00:03:33.579> physical<00:03:34.090> moves<00:03:34.269> and

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.450 
you know and doing physical moves and

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.090 
you know and doing physical moves and
stuff<00:03:34.510> like<00:03:34.720> that<00:03:34.870> but<00:03:35.110> uh<00:03:35.140> but<00:03:35.769> anyway<00:03:35.890> I'm

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100 
stuff like that but uh but anyway I'm

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:37.680 
stuff like that but uh but anyway I'm
gonna<00:03:36.220> go<00:03:36.310> on<00:03:36.489> and<00:03:36.610> show<00:03:36.730> this<00:03:36.850> um<00:03:37.120> so<00:03:37.299> you<00:03:37.420> know

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.690 
gonna go on and show this um so you know

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:38.970 
gonna go on and show this um so you know
just<00:03:37.900> just<00:03:38.200> give<00:03:38.320> me<00:03:38.380> an<00:03:38.470> idea<00:03:38.680> of<00:03:38.739> where<00:03:38.950> I

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
just just give me an idea of where I

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:40.500 
just just give me an idea of where I
think<00:03:39.100> this<00:03:39.340> would<00:03:39.459> be<00:03:39.489> most<00:03:39.730> useful<00:03:39.790> so<00:03:40.450> I'm

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
think this would be most useful so I'm

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.240 
think this would be most useful so I'm
go<00:03:40.600> ahead<00:03:40.750> and<00:03:40.870> show<00:03:40.989> you<00:03:41.049> the<00:03:41.230> the<00:03:42.040> closer

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
go ahead and show you the the closer

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:43.789 
go ahead and show you the the closer
photo<00:03:42.549> or<00:03:42.790> closer<00:03:43.060> video<00:03:43.359> here<00:03:43.540> of<00:03:43.570> this<00:03:43.720> uh

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:43.799 
photo or closer video here of this uh

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:46.740 
photo or closer video here of this uh
lighting<00:03:44.799> up<00:03:44.950> alright<00:03:45.700> guys<00:03:45.910> so<00:03:46.090> here<00:03:46.450> you<00:03:46.540> see

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
lighting up alright guys so here you see

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.780 
lighting up alright guys so here you see
the<00:03:46.959> cable<00:03:47.590> is<00:03:47.709> plugged<00:03:47.920> in<00:03:48.190> and<00:03:48.430> you<00:03:48.489> can<00:03:48.640> see

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
the cable is plugged in and you can see

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.120 
the cable is plugged in and you can see
the<00:03:48.940> orange<00:03:49.120> or<00:03:49.450> rather<00:03:49.750> red<00:03:50.230> red<00:03:50.769> dots<00:03:50.980> here

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130 
the orange or rather red red dots here

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.190 
the orange or rather red red dots here
those<00:03:51.400> are<00:03:51.430> the<00:03:51.609> ends<00:03:51.850> of<00:03:51.940> the<00:03:52.000> fiber<00:03:52.239> strands

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
those are the ends of the fiber strands

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.479 
those are the ends of the fiber strands
that<00:03:53.350> are<00:03:53.410> run<00:03:53.590> through<00:03:53.769> the<00:03:53.890> plenum<00:03:54.340> of<00:03:54.430> the

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:54.489 
that are run through the plenum of the

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:56.990 
that are run through the plenum of the
cable<00:03:54.820> or<00:03:54.880> the<00:03:55.109> insulation<00:03:56.109> rather<00:03:56.290> the<00:03:56.530> cable

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
cable or the insulation rather the cable

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.670 
cable or the insulation rather the cable
you<00:03:58.000> know<00:03:58.120> it's<00:03:58.359> it's<00:03:58.660> basically<00:03:59.109> on<00:03:59.380> or<00:03:59.530> off

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
you know it's it's basically on or off

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.860 
you know it's it's basically on or off
depending<00:03:59.829> on<00:04:00.190> the<00:04:00.310> other<00:04:00.459> end<00:04:00.700> here<00:04:00.940> I'm<00:04:01.720> just

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
depending on the other end here I'm just

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:03.390 
depending on the other end here I'm just
turning<00:04:02.049> on<00:04:02.320> and<00:04:02.500> off<00:04:02.560> the<00:04:02.620> saw<00:04:03.070> light<00:04:03.280> up

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:03.400 
turning on and off the saw light up

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.210 
turning on and off the saw light up
module<00:04:04.019> so<00:04:05.019> that's<00:04:05.350> basically<00:04:05.769> how<00:04:06.040> it<00:04:06.190> works

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:06.220 
module so that's basically how it works

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:09.270 
module so that's basically how it works
on<00:04:06.730> in<00:04:06.910> terms<00:04:07.150> of<00:04:07.450> lighting<00:04:08.170> up<00:04:08.290> the<00:04:08.590> cable<00:04:09.070> I

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 
on in terms of lighting up the cable I

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.550 
on in terms of lighting up the cable I
got<00:04:10.120> the<00:04:10.209> exposure<00:04:10.510> turned<00:04:10.900> down<00:04:11.049> pretty<00:04:11.350> good

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
got the exposure turned down pretty good

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.360 
got the exposure turned down pretty good
here<00:04:12.090> if<00:04:13.090> I<00:04:13.269> expose<00:04:13.630> the<00:04:13.930> video<00:04:14.140> like<00:04:14.799> the<00:04:15.160> rest

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:15.370 
here if I expose the video like the rest

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:16.949 
here if I expose the video like the rest
of<00:04:15.459> the<00:04:15.549> video<00:04:15.790> that's<00:04:16.209> about<00:04:16.450> how<00:04:16.600> bright<00:04:16.810> it

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 
of the video that's about how bright it

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:20.729 
of the video that's about how bright it
is<00:04:17.190> so<00:04:18.190> you<00:04:18.669> can<00:04:18.850> see<00:04:19.090> that<00:04:19.359> it's<00:04:20.320> a<00:04:20.410> little<00:04:20.590> bit

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 
is so you can see that it's a little bit

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:22.649 
is so you can see that it's a little bit
more<00:04:20.890> noticeable<00:04:21.489> in<00:04:21.549> the<00:04:21.729> in<00:04:22.030> person<00:04:22.270> than<00:04:22.570> it

00:04:22.649 --> 00:04:22.659 
more noticeable in the in person than it

00:04:22.659 --> 00:04:24.600 
more noticeable in the in person than it
is<00:04:22.780> on<00:04:22.840> video<00:04:23.140> but<00:04:23.680> it's<00:04:23.830> not<00:04:24.010> super<00:04:24.220> Krete

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
is on video but it's not super Krete

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:26.159 
is on video but it's not super Krete
right<00:04:24.909> but<00:04:25.240> it's<00:04:25.389> definitely<00:04:25.569> a<00:04:25.840> lot<00:04:25.870> nicer

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:26.169 
right but it's definitely a lot nicer

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:27.749 
right but it's definitely a lot nicer
than<00:04:26.349> you<00:04:26.740> know<00:04:26.830> trying<00:04:27.069> to<00:04:27.129> tone<00:04:27.340> out<00:04:27.520> and

00:04:27.749 --> 00:04:27.759 
than you know trying to tone out and

00:04:27.759 --> 00:04:30.240 
than you know trying to tone out and
trace<00:04:28.419> out<00:04:28.569> in<00:04:28.689> tugging<00:04:28.990> wire<00:04:29.169> so<00:04:29.500> something

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250 
trace out in tugging wire so something

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:31.409 
trace out in tugging wire so something
be<00:04:30.340> said<00:04:30.490> about<00:04:30.580> that<00:04:30.669> it's<00:04:30.909> pretty<00:04:31.120> simple

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:31.419 
be said about that it's pretty simple

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:33.029 
be said about that it's pretty simple
there's<00:04:31.569> two<00:04:31.840> fiber<00:04:32.379> strands<00:04:32.710> that<00:04:32.860> are<00:04:32.949> in

00:04:33.029 --> 00:04:33.039 
there's two fiber strands that are in

00:04:33.039 --> 00:04:35.399 
there's two fiber strands that are in
there<00:04:33.419> you<00:04:34.419> know<00:04:34.509> following<00:04:34.900> the<00:04:35.020> cables

00:04:35.399 --> 00:04:35.409 
there you know following the cables

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:38.249 
there you know following the cables
cables<00:04:36.370> insulation<00:04:37.000> and<00:04:37.780> then<00:04:37.870> they<00:04:37.990> double

00:04:38.249 --> 00:04:38.259 
cables insulation and then they double

00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:39.540 
cables insulation and then they double
back<00:04:38.409> the<00:04:38.800> reason<00:04:38.949> I<00:04:39.099> don't<00:04:39.159> think<00:04:39.310> this<00:04:39.520> uh

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:39.550 
back the reason I don't think this uh

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:41.339 
back the reason I don't think this uh
this<00:04:40.060> the<00:04:40.419> strainer<00:04:40.810> leaf<00:04:41.020> is<00:04:41.139> really

00:04:41.339 --> 00:04:41.349 
this the strainer leaf is really

00:04:41.349 --> 00:04:43.379 
this the strainer leaf is really
necessary<00:04:41.830> is<00:04:41.919> because<00:04:41.949> it's<00:04:42.789> protecting<00:04:43.270> the

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:43.389 
necessary is because it's protecting the

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:46.469 
necessary is because it's protecting the
ethernet<00:04:43.840> cable<00:04:43.990> from<00:04:44.740> strain<00:04:45.300> which<00:04:46.300> makes

00:04:46.469 --> 00:04:46.479 
ethernet cable from strain which makes

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:47.670 
ethernet cable from strain which makes
sense<00:04:46.689> cuz<00:04:46.840> there's<00:04:46.990> fiber<00:04:47.169> in<00:04:47.379> there

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 
sense cuz there's fiber in there

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.850 
sense cuz there's fiber in there
however<00:04:48.069> the<00:04:48.340> fiber<00:04:48.580> is<00:04:49.330> already<00:04:49.719> bent<00:04:50.050> 180

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.860 
however the fiber is already bent 180

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:52.860 
however the fiber is already bent 180
degrees<00:04:51.159> back<00:04:51.370> inside<00:04:51.819> this<00:04:51.939> connector<00:04:52.360> so

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870 
degrees back inside this connector so

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:55.499 
degrees back inside this connector so
it's<00:04:53.020> already<00:04:53.349> under<00:04:53.560> stress<00:04:54.090> so<00:04:55.090> I'm<00:04:55.389> gonna

00:04:55.499 --> 00:04:55.509 
it's already under stress so I'm gonna

00:04:55.509 --> 00:04:56.700 
it's already under stress so I'm gonna
take<00:04:55.629> it<00:04:55.750> apart<00:04:55.990> real<00:04:56.139> quick<00:04:56.289> I<00:04:56.379> don't<00:04:56.469> think

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:56.710 
take it apart real quick I don't think

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:57.659 
take it apart real quick I don't think
anyone's<00:04:57.009> made<00:04:57.159> a<00:04:57.189> video<00:04:57.340> where<00:04:57.550> this

00:04:57.659 --> 00:04:57.669 
anyone's made a video where this

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:00.420 
anyone's made a video where this
connectors<00:04:58.360> apart<00:04:58.479> to<00:04:59.139> show<00:04:59.169> you<00:04:59.409> the<00:04:59.770> inside

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:00.430 
connectors apart to show you the inside

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:02.309 
connectors apart to show you the inside
workings<00:05:00.789> of<00:05:00.909> that<00:05:00.969> and<00:05:01.330> you<00:05:01.990> can<00:05:02.139> appreciate

00:05:02.309 --> 00:05:02.319 
workings of that and you can appreciate

00:05:02.319 --> 00:05:05.189 
workings of that and you can appreciate
what<00:05:02.650> you're<00:05:02.800> paying<00:05:02.919> for<00:05:03.009> here<00:05:03.990> alright<00:05:04.990> guys

so<00:05:05.439> not<00:05:05.740> trying<00:05:06.009> to<00:05:06.099> give<00:05:06.219> away<00:05:06.460> any<00:05:07.419> of<00:05:07.569> patch

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:08.080 
so not trying to give away any of patch

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.820 
so not trying to give away any of patch
these<00:05:08.319> trademark<00:05:09.099> secrets<00:05:09.490> here<00:05:09.669> but<00:05:10.029> uh

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:10.830 
these trademark secrets here but uh

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:13.260 
these trademark secrets here but uh
basically<00:05:11.830> to<00:05:12.279> disassemble<00:05:12.849> this<00:05:13.029> guy<00:05:13.210> you

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:13.270 
basically to disassemble this guy you

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:15.779 
basically to disassemble this guy you
can<00:05:13.629> just<00:05:13.659> pop<00:05:14.080> this<00:05:14.349> this<00:05:15.009> blue<00:05:15.250> connector

00:05:15.779 --> 00:05:15.789 
can just pop this this blue connector

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:18.779 
can just pop this this blue connector
off<00:05:15.939> here<00:05:16.180> like<00:05:16.750> so<00:05:17.430> this<00:05:18.430> little<00:05:18.669> piece<00:05:18.759> of

00:05:18.779 --> 00:05:18.789 
off here like so this little piece of

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:20.550 
off here like so this little piece of
plastic<00:05:18.969> is<00:05:19.360> just<00:05:19.539> kind<00:05:19.750> of<00:05:19.840> like<00:05:20.050> some

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:20.560 
plastic is just kind of like some

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:23.189 
plastic is just kind of like some
flashing<00:05:20.979> that's<00:05:21.129> left<00:05:21.310> over<00:05:21.750> and<00:05:22.750> then<00:05:22.990> you

00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:23.199 
flashing that's left over and then you

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:28.170 
flashing that's left over and then you
can<00:05:23.229> just<00:05:23.639> pull<00:05:24.639> these<00:05:25.680> little<00:05:26.680> tabs<00:05:26.919> up<00:05:27.180> you

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:28.180 
can just pull these little tabs up you

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:29.790 
can just pull these little tabs up you
have<00:05:28.300> to<00:05:28.389> do<00:05:28.539> it<00:05:28.599> with<00:05:28.719> your<00:05:28.870> your<00:05:29.379> fingers

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:29.800 
have to do it with your your fingers

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.469 
have to do it with your your fingers
trying<00:05:30.339> to<00:05:30.430> do<00:05:30.520> this<00:05:30.669> in<00:05:30.789> the<00:05:30.849> video<00:05:31.060> so<00:05:31.330> it's<00:05:31.419> a

00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:31.479 
trying to do this in the video so it's a

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:34.769 
trying to do this in the video so it's a
little<00:05:31.569> tricky<00:05:31.719> here<00:05:33.389> once<00:05:34.389> you<00:05:34.479> got<00:05:34.629> those

00:05:34.769 --> 00:05:34.779 
little tricky here once you got those

00:05:34.779 --> 00:05:36.629 
little tricky here once you got those
this<00:05:35.620> thing<00:05:35.800> opens<00:05:36.039> just<00:05:36.219> like<00:05:36.310> your<00:05:36.460> ordinary

00:05:36.629 --> 00:05:36.639 
this thing opens just like your ordinary

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:39.689 
this thing opens just like your ordinary
clamshell<00:05:37.529> you<00:05:38.529> know<00:05:38.620> any<00:05:38.860> any<00:05:39.159> clamshell

00:05:39.689 --> 00:05:39.699 
clamshell you know any any clamshell

00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:41.490 
clamshell you know any any clamshell
connector<00:05:40.120> that<00:05:40.839> you<00:05:40.930> might<00:05:41.110> have<00:05:41.169> dealt<00:05:41.440> with

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:41.500 
connector that you might have dealt with

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:45.149 
connector that you might have dealt with
before<00:05:41.949> ever<00:05:43.050> and<00:05:44.050> so<00:05:44.560> you<00:05:44.650> can<00:05:44.889> see<00:05:45.039> the

00:05:45.149 --> 00:05:45.159 
before ever and so you can see the

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:47.999 
before ever and so you can see the
fibers<00:05:45.550> already<00:05:45.789> popped<00:05:45.969> out<00:05:46.150> and<00:05:46.770> then<00:05:47.770> when

00:05:47.999 --> 00:05:48.009 
fibers already popped out and then when

00:05:48.009 --> 00:05:50.760 
fibers already popped out and then when
you<00:05:48.099> look<00:05:48.190> inside<00:05:49.169> you<00:05:50.169> know<00:05:50.319> you<00:05:50.349> can<00:05:50.620> see

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:50.770 
you look inside you know you can see

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:53.610 
you look inside you know you can see
that<00:05:50.889> you<00:05:50.979> have<00:05:51.009> an<00:05:51.190> Ethernet<00:05:51.339> cable<00:05:51.779> with<00:05:52.779> two

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:53.620 
that you have an Ethernet cable with two

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:56.189 
that you have an Ethernet cable with two
you<00:05:54.279> know<00:05:54.400> two<00:05:54.460> fibers<00:05:54.879> sticking<00:05:55.719> out<00:05:55.990> here

00:05:56.189 --> 00:05:56.199 
you know two fibers sticking out here

00:05:56.199 --> 00:05:59.189 
you know two fibers sticking out here
you<00:05:56.319> got<00:05:56.439> this<00:05:56.560> guy<00:05:56.740> here<00:05:56.979> and<00:05:58.139> you<00:05:59.139> know

00:05:59.189 --> 00:05:59.199 
you got this guy here and you know

00:05:59.199 --> 00:06:00.510 
you got this guy here and you know
that's<00:05:59.409> that<00:05:59.500> was<00:05:59.710> my<00:05:59.830> point<00:05:59.979> earlier<00:06:00.339> was

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:00.520 
that's that was my point earlier was

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:02.850 
that's that was my point earlier was
just<00:06:00.550> that<00:06:00.819> this<00:06:01.449> this<00:06:02.020> boot<00:06:02.289> doesn't<00:06:02.710> really

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:02.860 
just that this this boot doesn't really

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:04.490 
just that this this boot doesn't really
make<00:06:03.009> a<00:06:03.039> whole<00:06:03.219> lot<00:06:03.370> of<00:06:03.400> sense<00:06:03.610> to<00:06:03.819> me<00:06:03.939> because

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:04.500 
make a whole lot of sense to me because

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:07.110 
make a whole lot of sense to me because
it's<00:06:05.500> uh<00:06:05.620> it's<00:06:06.129> protecting<00:06:06.550> the<00:06:06.610> strain<00:06:06.909> of

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:07.120 
it's uh it's protecting the strain of

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:11.929 
it's uh it's protecting the strain of
the<00:06:07.659> cable<00:06:08.020> you<00:06:08.740> know<00:06:08.879> from<00:06:09.879> this<00:06:10.300> point<00:06:10.830> back

00:06:11.929 --> 00:06:11.939 
the cable you know from this point back

00:06:11.939 --> 00:06:15.689 
the cable you know from this point back
what<00:06:12.939> the<00:06:13.060> truth<00:06:13.300> is<00:06:13.479> the<00:06:13.990> the<00:06:14.860> fiber<00:06:15.159> is

00:06:15.689 --> 00:06:15.699 
what the truth is the the fiber is

00:06:15.699 --> 00:06:18.140 
what the truth is the the fiber is
already<00:06:16.240> doing<00:06:16.449> a<00:06:16.750> pretty<00:06:16.990> radical<00:06:17.319> Bend

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:18.150 
already doing a pretty radical Bend

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:21.269 
already doing a pretty radical Bend
right<00:06:19.150> outside<00:06:19.599> of<00:06:19.870> the<00:06:20.050> ethernet<00:06:20.439> cable<00:06:20.860> if

00:06:21.269 --> 00:06:21.279 
right outside of the ethernet cable if

00:06:21.279 --> 00:06:22.649 
right outside of the ethernet cable if
you<00:06:21.310> guys<00:06:21.460> can<00:06:21.669> really<00:06:21.879> see<00:06:22.089> that<00:06:22.120> very<00:06:22.449> well

00:06:22.649 --> 00:06:22.659 
you guys can really see that very well

00:06:22.659 --> 00:06:25.350 
you guys can really see that very well
but<00:06:23.370> trying<00:06:24.370> to<00:06:24.490> get<00:06:24.639> it<00:06:24.729> for<00:06:24.879> you<00:06:24.969> there<00:06:25.150> so

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:25.360 
but trying to get it for you there so

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:27.929 
but trying to get it for you there so
anyway<00:06:26.349> yeah<00:06:27.250> that's<00:06:27.490> the<00:06:27.580> cable

00:06:27.929 --> 00:06:27.939 
anyway yeah that's the cable

00:06:27.939 --> 00:06:30.329 
anyway yeah that's the cable
disassembled<00:06:28.930> you<00:06:29.740> know<00:06:29.830> in<00:06:29.949> terms<00:06:30.129> of<00:06:30.279> the

00:06:30.329 --> 00:06:30.339 
disassembled you know in terms of the

00:06:30.339 --> 00:06:32.249 
disassembled you know in terms of the
connector<00:06:30.729> I<00:06:30.879> don't<00:06:31.810> think<00:06:31.960> I've<00:06:32.050> seen

00:06:32.249 --> 00:06:32.259 
connector I don't think I've seen

00:06:32.259 --> 00:06:33.749 
connector I don't think I've seen
anybody<00:06:32.439> post<00:06:32.860> that<00:06:33.039> before<00:06:33.399> to<00:06:33.520> show<00:06:33.580> you
