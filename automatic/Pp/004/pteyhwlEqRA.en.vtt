this technique because a lot of times
they<00:05:04.930> fight<00:05:05.139> it<00:05:05.229> on<00:05:05.319> the<00:05:05.379> fall<00:05:05.590> you'll<00:05:05.800> put<00:05:05.979> a

00:05:05.999 --> 00:05:06.009 
they fight it on the fall you'll put a

00:05:06.009 --> 00:05:06.600 
they fight it on the fall you'll put a
bump<00:05:06.340> it

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:06.610 
bump it

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:08.129 
bump it
you<00:05:06.849> need<00:05:07.000> a<00:05:07.030> gather<00:05:07.360> if<00:05:07.539> your<00:05:07.690> line<00:05:07.810> really

00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:08.139 
you need a gather if your line really

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:09.869 
you need a gather if your line really
quick<00:05:08.379> and<00:05:08.590> set<00:05:08.830> the<00:05:08.949> hook<00:05:09.129> so<00:05:09.370> a<00:05:09.400> high-speed

00:05:09.869 --> 00:05:09.879 
quick and set the hook so a high-speed
