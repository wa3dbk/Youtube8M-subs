and reining maneuvers I see a lot of
things<00:00:15.530> that<00:00:15.860> people<00:00:16.010> commonly<00:00:16.870> do<00:00:17.870> that<00:00:18.260> work

talking<00:00:19.910> a<00:00:20.150> little<00:00:20.240> bit<00:00:20.390> about<00:00:20.770> some<00:00:21.770> of<00:00:21.860> the

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:21.920 
talking a little bit about some of the

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:23.470 
talking a little bit about some of the
things<00:00:22.100> that<00:00:22.250> I<00:00:22.280> see<00:00:22.580> people<00:00:22.610> do<00:00:23.150> in<00:00:23.330> their

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:23.480 
things that I see people do in their

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.050 
things that I see people do in their
turnaround<00:00:23.840> that<00:00:24.260> works<00:00:25.010> against<00:00:25.430> them<00:00:25.580> that

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:26.060 
turnaround that works against them that

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:27.400 
turnaround that works against them that
you<00:00:26.450> know<00:00:26.540> keeps<00:00:26.780> their<00:00:26.930> horse<00:00:27.110> from<00:00:27.260> being

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:27.410 
you know keeps their horse from being

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:29.440 
you know keeps their horse from being
able<00:00:27.500> to<00:00:27.590> perform<00:00:27.890> as<00:00:28.010> well<00:00:28.040> as<00:00:28.190> it<00:00:28.400> could<00:00:28.550> so

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:29.450 
able to perform as well as it could so

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:31.030 
able to perform as well as it could so
what<00:00:29.990> I'm<00:00:30.080> talking<00:00:30.440> about<00:00:30.500> is<00:00:30.770> when<00:00:30.920> you're

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:31.040 
what I'm talking about is when you're

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.130 
what I'm talking about is when you're
working<00:00:31.340> on<00:00:31.430> a<00:00:31.490> spin<00:00:31.820> with<00:00:31.970> your<00:00:32.090> horse<00:00:32.300> so<00:00:33.050> the

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:33.140 
working on a spin with your horse so the

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:34.540 
working on a spin with your horse so the
first<00:00:33.379> thing<00:00:33.620> that<00:00:33.649> I<00:00:33.800> see<00:00:34.040> people<00:00:34.070> do<00:00:34.370> and<00:00:34.490> I

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:34.550 
first thing that I see people do and I

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.400 
first thing that I see people do and I
actually<00:00:34.880> like<00:00:35.210> to<00:00:35.300> call<00:00:35.450> it<00:00:35.540> maneuvering<00:00:36.200> it

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:36.410 
actually like to call it maneuvering it

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:38.410 
actually like to call it maneuvering it
means<00:00:36.830> that<00:00:37.100> now<00:00:37.640> I'm<00:00:37.760> going<00:00:37.820> to<00:00:38.090> go<00:00:38.180> turn

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:38.420 
means that now I'm going to go turn

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:39.820 
means that now I'm going to go turn
around<00:00:38.690> and<00:00:38.840> there's<00:00:38.960> a<00:00:39.020> body<00:00:39.230> position<00:00:39.680> I<00:00:39.770> do

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:39.830 
around and there's a body position I do

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:41.110 
around and there's a body position I do
and<00:00:40.280> there's<00:00:40.430> things<00:00:40.730> that<00:00:40.850> I<00:00:40.880> go<00:00:41.090> through

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:41.120 
and there's things that I go through

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.270 
and there's things that I go through
when<00:00:41.510> I<00:00:41.540> turn<00:00:41.840> my<00:00:42.020> horse<00:00:42.230> around<00:00:42.500> so<00:00:42.950> the<00:00:43.040> first

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:43.280 
when I turn my horse around so the first

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.010 
when I turn my horse around so the first
thing<00:00:43.520> that<00:00:44.120> I<00:00:44.150> see<00:00:44.570> really<00:00:45.260> often<00:00:45.590> is<00:00:47.020> people

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:48.020 
thing that I see really often is people

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:49.270 
thing that I see really often is people
have<00:00:48.170> somehow<00:00:48.440> gotten<00:00:48.560> in<00:00:48.920> their<00:00:49.040> head<00:00:49.250> that

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:49.280 
have somehow gotten in their head that

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.100 
have somehow gotten in their head that
what<00:00:49.579> they<00:00:49.700> need<00:00:49.910> to<00:00:50.090> do<00:00:50.270> to<00:00:50.630> ask<00:00:50.750> their<00:00:50.960> horse

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:51.110 
what they need to do to ask their horse

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.680 
what they need to do to ask their horse
to<00:00:51.290> turn<00:00:51.410> around<00:00:51.710> is<00:00:51.950> to<00:00:52.430> open<00:00:52.970> the<00:00:53.090> door<00:00:53.270> so

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:53.690 
to turn around is to open the door so

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.960 
to turn around is to open the door so
what<00:00:53.870> you<00:00:53.989> first<00:00:54.200> see<00:00:54.440> them<00:00:54.590> do<00:00:54.800> is<00:00:55.040> if<00:00:55.730> say<00:00:55.880> if

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:55.970 
what you first see them do is if say if

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:57.160 
what you first see them do is if say if
I'm<00:00:56.090> going<00:00:56.239> to<00:00:56.300> turn<00:00:56.450> around<00:00:56.510> to<00:00:56.899> the<00:00:56.930> right

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 
I'm going to turn around to the right

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.040 
I'm going to turn around to the right
here<00:00:57.560> they'll<00:00:58.130> immediately<00:00:58.750> open<00:00:59.750> the<00:00:59.870> door

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.050 
here they'll immediately open the door

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.850 
here they'll immediately open the door
up<00:01:00.230> like<00:01:00.410> this<00:01:00.649> with<00:01:00.860> their<00:01:01.010> leg<00:01:01.220> and<00:01:02.860> and

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:03.860 
up like this with their leg and and

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:05.770 
up like this with their leg and and
being<00:01:04.100> in<00:01:04.250> a<00:01:04.309> very<00:01:04.579> unbalanced<00:01:05.299> position<00:01:05.689> in

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 
being in a very unbalanced position in

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.629 
being in a very unbalanced position in
doing<00:01:06.020> this<00:01:06.140> and<00:01:06.560> so<00:01:06.679> when<00:01:06.799> I<00:01:06.829> look<00:01:07.069> at<00:01:07.159> this<00:01:07.369> if

00:01:07.629 --> 00:01:07.639 
doing this and so when I look at this if

00:01:07.639 --> 00:01:09.550 
doing this and so when I look at this if
I'm<00:01:08.060> thinking<00:01:08.210> about<00:01:08.450> how<00:01:08.749> I've<00:01:08.869> consistently

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:09.560 
I'm thinking about how I've consistently

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.859 
I'm thinking about how I've consistently
trained<00:01:09.829> my<00:01:10.009> horse<00:01:10.280> if<00:01:10.609> I<00:01:10.999> put<00:01:11.210> any<00:01:11.359> blockage

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:11.869 
trained my horse if I put any blockage

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:13.389 
trained my horse if I put any blockage
out<00:01:12.049> for<00:01:12.259> my<00:01:12.350> horse<00:01:12.590> I<00:01:12.740> would<00:01:12.799> expect<00:01:13.130> them<00:01:13.280> to

00:01:13.389 --> 00:01:13.399 
out for my horse I would expect them to

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:16.419 
out for my horse I would expect them to
not<00:01:13.549> to<00:01:14.090> not<00:01:14.240> turn<00:01:15.139> through<00:01:15.530> this<00:01:15.649> foot<00:01:15.889> so<00:01:16.159> for

00:01:16.419 --> 00:01:16.429 
not to not turn through this foot so for

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:18.520 
not to not turn through this foot so for
example<00:01:16.819> my<00:01:16.939> horses<00:01:17.270> shoulders<00:01:17.630> here<00:01:17.929> if<00:01:18.049> my

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
example my horses shoulders here if my

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.260 
example my horses shoulders here if my
foot<00:01:18.799> comes<00:01:19.100> up<00:01:19.249> here<00:01:19.549> and<00:01:19.639> I<00:01:19.969> know<00:01:20.030> when

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
foot comes up here and I know when

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:21.639 
foot comes up here and I know when
people's<00:01:20.539> head<00:01:20.749> they're<00:01:20.990> thinking<00:01:21.409> I'm

00:01:21.639 --> 00:01:21.649 
people's head they're thinking I'm

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:23.199 
people's head they're thinking I'm
opening<00:01:22.189> up<00:01:22.280> the<00:01:22.340> door<00:01:22.549> for<00:01:22.579> my<00:01:22.789> horse<00:01:22.969> to<00:01:23.119> go

00:01:23.199 --> 00:01:23.209 
opening up the door for my horse to go

00:01:23.209 --> 00:01:24.849 
opening up the door for my horse to go
that<00:01:23.389> way<00:01:23.479> I'm<00:01:23.569> moving<00:01:23.719> my<00:01:23.959> leg<00:01:24.139> off<00:01:24.289> but<00:01:24.740> this

00:01:24.849 --> 00:01:24.859 
that way I'm moving my leg off but this

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:26.709 
that way I'm moving my leg off but this
is<00:01:24.920> what<00:01:25.159> ends<00:01:25.399> up<00:01:25.490> actually<00:01:25.700> happening<00:01:26.450> and

00:01:26.709 --> 00:01:26.719 
is what ends up actually happening and

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:29.949 
is what ends up actually happening and
so<00:01:27.249> what<00:01:28.249> this<00:01:28.399> does<00:01:28.459> is<00:01:28.729> the<00:01:29.389> first<00:01:29.600> few<00:01:29.810> times

00:01:29.949 --> 00:01:29.959 
so what this does is the first few times

00:01:29.959 --> 00:01:31.059 
so what this does is the first few times
you<00:01:30.079> do<00:01:30.229> this<00:01:30.259> if<00:01:30.469> your<00:01:30.619> horse<00:01:30.770> has<00:01:30.889> been

00:01:31.059 --> 00:01:31.069 
you do this if your horse has been

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:33.039 
you do this if your horse has been
brought<00:01:31.549> along<00:01:31.819> correctly<00:01:32.329> your<00:01:32.719> horse<00:01:32.840> isn't

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:33.049 
brought along correctly your horse isn't

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:34.389

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:08.530 
them even if they're in a leverage bit
so<00:03:05.530> in<00:03:06.530> a<00:03:07.159> proper<00:03:07.549> turn<00:03:07.730> around<00:03:08.000> my<00:03:08.150> horse<00:03:08.389> is

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
so in a proper turn around my horse is

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:09.909 
so in a proper turn around my horse is
going<00:03:08.659> to<00:03:08.719> start<00:03:09.049> with<00:03:09.199> his<00:03:09.290> I<00:03:09.439> turn<00:03:09.680> in<00:03:09.799> and

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:09.919 
going to start with his I turn in and

00:03:09.919 --> 00:03:11.259 
going to start with his I turn in and
he's<00:03:10.010> going<00:03:10.159> to<00:03:10.219> lead<00:03:10.430> with<00:03:10.459> his<00:03:10.669> nose<00:03:10.909> here

00:03:11.259 --> 00:03:11.269 
he's going to lead with his nose here

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:14.920 
he's going to lead with his nose here
and<00:03:11.590> step<00:03:12.590> around<00:03:12.709> right<00:03:13.159> so<00:03:13.760> what<00:03:14.540> I<00:03:14.569> see

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
and step around right so what I see

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:16.959 
and step around right so what I see
people<00:03:15.199> doing<00:03:15.379> and<00:03:15.680> I<00:03:15.709> and<00:03:16.010> I<00:03:16.129> and<00:03:16.430> I<00:03:16.669> don't

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:16.969 
people doing and I and I and I don't

00:03:16.969 --> 00:03:18.309 
people doing and I and I and I don't
know<00:03:17.150> if<00:03:17.299> they<00:03:17.419> know<00:03:17.659> that<00:03:17.689> they're<00:03:17.989> doing<00:03:18.199> it

00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:18.319 
know if they know that they're doing it

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:19.689 
know if they know that they're doing it
is<00:03:18.409> oftentimes<00:03:18.799> they're<00:03:19.189> going<00:03:19.340> to<00:03:19.400> lead<00:03:19.669> with

00:03:19.689 --> 00:03:19.699 
is oftentimes they're going to lead with

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:22.210 
is oftentimes they're going to lead with
their<00:03:20.060> outside<00:03:20.509> hand<00:03:20.810> here<00:03:21.079> so<00:03:21.229> instead<00:03:22.069> of

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
their outside hand here so instead of

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:23.860 
their outside hand here so instead of
the<00:03:22.579> horse<00:03:22.790> staying<00:03:23.090> between<00:03:23.299> the<00:03:23.659> reins

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
the horse staying between the reins

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.479 
the horse staying between the reins
equidistance<00:03:24.650> when<00:03:24.769> they<00:03:24.859> turn<00:03:25.040> around<00:03:25.159> and

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:25.489 
equidistance when they turn around and

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:26.770 
equidistance when they turn around and
maybe<00:03:25.879> leading<00:03:26.269> a<00:03:26.329> little<00:03:26.540> bit<00:03:26.629> with<00:03:26.720> the

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
maybe leading a little bit with the

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.809 
maybe leading a little bit with the
inside<00:03:27.079> rein<00:03:27.319> they'll<00:03:27.889> end<00:03:28.099> up<00:03:28.220> overdoing

00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:28.819 
inside rein they'll end up overdoing

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:31.119 
inside rein they'll end up overdoing
this<00:03:29.090> rein<00:03:29.389> and<00:03:29.629> so<00:03:30.319> what<00:03:30.470> happens<00:03:30.829> over<00:03:30.979> time

00:03:31.119 --> 00:03:31.129 
this rein and so what happens over time

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:33.069 
this rein and so what happens over time
is<00:03:31.370> that<00:03:31.699> their<00:03:31.849> horse<00:03:32.090> gets<00:03:32.329> bound<00:03:32.540> up<00:03:32.780> here

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:33.079 
is that their horse gets bound up here

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:35.110 
is that their horse gets bound up here
and<00:03:33.259> as<00:03:33.709> soon<00:03:33.919> as<00:03:34.040> I<00:03:34.189> break<00:03:34.430> the<00:03:34.579> plane<00:03:34.819> of<00:03:35.000> my

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
and as soon as I break the plane of my

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.199 
and as soon as I break the plane of my
horse's<00:03:35.509> neck<00:03:35.689> with<00:03:35.900> my<00:03:36.049> hand<00:03:36.489> I'm<00:03:37.489> now<00:03:37.909> asking

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:38.209 
horse's neck with my hand I'm now asking

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:40.059 
horse's neck with my hand I'm now asking
them<00:03:38.359> to<00:03:38.419> bend<00:03:38.659> this<00:03:38.840> direction<00:03:39.349> so<00:03:39.709> people<00:03:39.949> be

00:03:40.059 --> 00:03:40.069 
them to bend this direction so people be

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:41.589 
them to bend this direction so people be
doing<00:03:40.250> this<00:03:40.489> and<00:03:40.699> not<00:03:40.759> knowing<00:03:41.060> they're<00:03:41.359> doing

00:03:41.589 --> 00:03:41.599 
doing this and not knowing they're doing

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:43.030 
doing this and not knowing they're doing
it<00:03:41.720> and<00:03:41.900> now<00:03:42.019> their<00:03:42.199> horse<00:03:42.409> starts<00:03:42.680> to<00:03:42.799> step

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
it and now their horse starts to step

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.189 
it and now their horse starts to step
behind<00:03:43.189> because<00:03:43.939> they<00:03:44.209> keep<00:03:44.389> pulling<00:03:44.780> harder

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:45.199 
behind because they keep pulling harder

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:47.050 
behind because they keep pulling harder
and<00:03:45.379> your<00:03:45.919> horse<00:03:46.099> gets<00:03:46.280> bound<00:03:46.519> up<00:03:46.729> and<00:03:46.849> can't

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
and your horse gets bound up and can't

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.960 
and your horse gets bound up and can't
follow<00:03:47.269> himself<00:03:47.780> so<00:03:48.769> you<00:03:49.099> know<00:03:49.579> it's<00:03:49.729> really

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
follow himself so you know it's really

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:53.229 
follow himself so you know it's really
important<00:03:50.569> that<00:03:50.870> your<00:03:51.739> hand<00:03:52.040> never<00:03:52.879> breaks

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:53.239 
important that your hand never breaks

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:55.059 
important that your hand never breaks
the<00:03:53.419> plane<00:03:53.540> of<00:03:53.720> your<00:03:53.810> horse's<00:03:54.139> neck<00:03:54.290> if<00:03:54.829> your

00:03:55.059 --> 00:03:55.069 
the plane of your horse's neck if your

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:56.770 
the plane of your horse's neck if your
hand<00:03:55.370> needs<00:03:55.669> to<00:03:55.819> come<00:03:56.060> further<00:03:56.299> across<00:03:56.479> here

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:56.780 
hand needs to come further across here

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:57.789 
hand needs to come further across here
it's<00:03:56.900> because<00:03:57.019> your<00:03:57.259> horse<00:03:57.439> isn't<00:03:57.709> moving

00:03:57.789 --> 00:03:57.799 
it's because your horse isn't moving

00:03:57.799 --> 00:03:59.740 
it's because your horse isn't moving
with<00:03:57.979> his<00:03:58.099> body<00:03:58.310> as<00:03:58.489> much<00:03:58.639> as<00:03:58.759> he<00:03:58.849> needs<00:03:59.090> to<00:03:59.209> you

00:03:59.740 --> 00:03:59.750 
with his body as much as he needs to you

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:00.909 
with his body as much as he needs to you
need<00:03:59.900> to<00:03:59.930> use<00:04:00.049> your<00:04:00.139> leg<00:04:00.319> to<00:04:00.500> speed<00:04:00.709> them<00:04:00.829> up

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:00.919 
need to use your leg to speed them up

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:03.249 
need to use your leg to speed them up
but<00:04:01.489> the<00:04:01.609> second<00:04:02.000> that<00:04:02.090> your<00:04:02.269> hand<00:04:02.569> breaks<00:04:03.079> the

00:04:03.249 --> 00:04:03.259 
but the second that your hand breaks the

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:04.839 
but the second that your hand breaks the
plane<00:04:03.469> of<00:04:03.620> this<00:04:03.709> horse's<00:04:04.099> neck<00:04:04.310> in<00:04:04.549> a
