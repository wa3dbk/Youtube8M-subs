and that's what I ended up with and here
I<00:00:23.189> cut<00:00:23.490> out<00:00:23.519> a<00:00:23.670> nice<00:00:23.910> little<00:00:23.939> slice<00:00:24.539> the<00:00:25.140> crust

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
of toppings ratio is pretty standard I

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.150 
of toppings ratio is pretty standard I
mean<00:00:27.840> especially<00:00:28.019> if<00:00:28.260> you<00:00:28.320> compare<00:00:28.650> it<00:00:28.680> to<00:00:28.769> any

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
mean especially if you compare it to any

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.130 
mean especially if you compare it to any
other<00:00:29.250> kind<00:00:29.429> of<00:00:29.670> fast<00:00:29.910> food<00:00:30.210> like<00:00:30.449> pizza<00:00:30.960> I

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
biggest difference I would say besides

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.760

my horrible cutting cuz all I have is a

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.890 
my horrible cutting cuz all I have is a
plastic<00:01:17.250> knife<00:01:17.430> right<00:01:17.670> now<00:01:17.700> is<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.540> flavor

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
plastic knife right now is the flavor

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.469

it's<00:01:19.410> weird<00:01:19.800> to<00:01:19.979> say<00:01:20.160> that<00:01:20.430> this<00:01:20.610> frozen<00:01:20.940> pizza

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
it's weird to say that this frozen pizza

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.260 
it's weird to say that this frozen pizza
that<00:01:21.690> came<00:01:21.930> out<00:01:22.260> of<00:01:22.710> my<00:01:22.920> own<00:01:22.950> oven<00:01:23.490> definitely

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
that came out of my own oven definitely

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.450 
that came out of my own oven definitely
has<00:01:24.540> way<00:01:24.780> more<00:01:24.810> flavor<00:01:25.320> and<00:01:25.650> taste<00:01:25.920> and<00:01:26.250> then

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
has way more flavor and taste and then

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.359 
has way more flavor and taste and then
this<00:01:26.670> standard<00:01:27.150> pizza<00:01:27.770> that's<00:01:28.770> exactly<00:01:29.250> the

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
this standard pizza that's exactly the

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.550 
this standard pizza that's exactly the
same<00:01:29.580> price<00:01:29.940> as<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.510> pizza<00:01:30.840> now<00:01:30.869> guaranteed<00:01:31.500> a

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
same price as the pizza now guaranteed a

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.160 
same price as the pizza now guaranteed a
little<00:01:31.830> bit<00:01:31.920> smaller<00:01:32.280> but<00:01:32.640> really<00:01:33.030> size<00:01:33.869> or

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
little bit smaller but really size or

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.870 
little bit smaller but really size or
flavor<00:01:34.500> I<00:01:34.710> would<00:01:34.920> rather<00:01:35.220> have<00:01:35.460> a<00:01:35.520> smaller

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
flavor I would rather have a smaller

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.580 
flavor I would rather have a smaller
pizza<00:01:36.270> that<00:01:36.450> tastes<00:01:36.720> better<00:01:36.960> than<00:01:37.170> a<00:01:37.229> huge

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
pizza that tastes better than a huge

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.590 
pizza that tastes better than a huge
pizza<00:01:37.890> that<00:01:38.250> just<00:01:38.400> tastes<00:01:38.640> like<00:01:38.760> dough<00:01:39.119> one

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
pizza that just tastes like dough one

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.000 
pizza that just tastes like dough one
more<00:01:39.780> step<00:01:39.960> up<00:01:40.170> I<00:01:40.290> think<00:01:40.350> it<00:01:40.590> has<00:01:40.740> over

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:41.010 
more step up I think it has over

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:42.500 
more step up I think it has over
something<00:01:41.340> like<00:01:41.369> Little<00:01:41.790> Caesars<00:01:42.119> is<00:01:42.360> the

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:42.510 
something like Little Caesars is the

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:44.150 
something like Little Caesars is the
crust<00:01:42.720> itself<00:01:43.170> even<00:01:43.500> though<00:01:43.710> there<00:01:43.860> is<00:01:43.979> an

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:44.160 
crust itself even though there is an

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.100 
crust itself even though there is an
abundance<00:01:44.610> of<00:01:44.790> it<00:01:44.940> it<00:01:45.270> actually<00:01:45.479> has<00:01:45.780> a<00:01:45.810> good

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
abundance of it it actually has a good

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.920 
abundance of it it actually has a good
flavor<00:01:46.440> and<00:01:46.800> texture<00:01:47.220> to<00:01:47.490> it<00:01:47.520> it's<00:01:47.880> not<00:01:48.180> overly

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
flavor and texture to it it's not overly

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.780 
flavor and texture to it it's not overly
doughy<00:01:49.320> but<00:01:49.650> it<00:01:49.770> isn't<00:01:50.130> dense<00:01:50.400> like<00:01:50.580> you're

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
doughy but it isn't dense like you're

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.820 
doughy but it isn't dense like you're
eating<00:01:50.880> a<00:01:51.060> brick<00:01:51.360> and<00:01:51.600> it<00:01:52.170> worked<00:01:52.440> out<00:01:52.590> pretty

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:52.830 
eating a brick and it worked out pretty

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:54.620 
eating a brick and it worked out pretty
well<00:01:52.980> now<00:01:53.400> the<00:01:53.460> main<00:01:53.730> important<00:01:54.270> part<00:01:54.480> is

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
well now the main important part is

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.810 
well now the main important part is
what's<00:01:54.870> on<00:01:54.990> top<00:01:55.260> of<00:01:55.440> the<00:01:55.530> crust<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:56.280> pepperoni

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
what's on top of the crust the pepperoni

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.000 
what's on top of the crust the pepperoni
blows<00:01:57.660> there's<00:01:57.990> completely<00:01:58.650> out<00:01:58.800> of<00:01:58.950> the

00:01:59.000 --> 00:01:59.010 
blows there's completely out of the

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:00.740 
blows there's completely out of the
water<00:01:59.250> I<00:01:59.550> mean<00:01:59.760> it<00:01:59.880> actually<00:02:00.240> has<00:02:00.390> a<00:02:00.420> nice

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
water I mean it actually has a nice

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.810 
water I mean it actually has a nice
pepperoni<00:02:01.500> taste<00:02:01.920> to<00:02:02.070> it<00:02:02.159> and<00:02:02.340> almost<00:02:02.610> like

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
pepperoni taste to it and almost like

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.970 
pepperoni taste to it and almost like

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:04.980 
that nice pepperoni kick or burn that

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:06.470 
that nice pepperoni kick or burn that
you<00:02:05.100> get<00:02:05.310> in<00:02:05.430> the<00:02:05.520> back<00:02:05.730> unlike<00:02:06.270> their

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:06.480 
you get in the back unlike their

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.240 
you get in the back unlike their
pepperoni<00:02:06.990> that's<00:02:07.290> just<00:02:07.470> very<00:02:07.500> bland<00:02:08.040> and

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
pepperoni that's just very bland and

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.859 
pepperoni that's just very bland and
almost<00:02:08.519> tastes<00:02:08.700> like<00:02:08.850> a<00:02:08.880> fake<00:02:09.269> pepperoni

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
almost tastes like a fake pepperoni

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.410 
almost tastes like a fake pepperoni
flavored<00:02:10.350> sausage<00:02:10.830> and<00:02:11.130> one<00:02:11.910> was<00:02:12.120> hot<00:02:12.390> right

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
flavored sausage and one was hot right

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.090 
flavored sausage and one was hot right
out<00:02:12.600> of<00:02:12.750> the<00:02:12.840> oven<00:02:12.989> I<00:02:13.170> did<00:02:13.440> pull<00:02:13.650> the<00:02:13.769> pieces

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
out of the oven I did pull the pieces

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.770 
out of the oven I did pull the pieces
apart<00:02:14.250> the<00:02:14.640> cheese<00:02:14.850> itself<00:02:15.180> did<00:02:15.450> stretch

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
apart the cheese itself did stretch

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.780 
apart the cheese itself did stretch
nicely<00:02:16.320> which<00:02:16.500> was<00:02:16.680> a<00:02:16.709> good<00:02:17.040> thing<00:02:17.220> of<00:02:17.519> course

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
nicely which was a good thing of course

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.640 
nicely which was a good thing of course
the<00:02:18.330> only<00:02:18.450> thing<00:02:18.540> I<00:02:18.720> wasn't<00:02:19.080> really<00:02:19.200> feeling

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
the only thing I wasn't really feeling

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.650 
the only thing I wasn't really feeling
on<00:02:19.769> this<00:02:19.950> is<00:02:20.160> the<00:02:20.400> sauce<00:02:20.700> and<00:02:21.120> it's<00:02:21.330> not<00:02:21.480> really

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
on this is the sauce and it's not really

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.750 
on this is the sauce and it's not really
so<00:02:21.930> much<00:02:21.989> that<00:02:22.350> the<00:02:22.620> sauce<00:02:22.860> tastes<00:02:23.250> bad<00:02:23.459> it's

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
so much that the sauce tastes bad it's

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.670 
so much that the sauce tastes bad it's
the<00:02:23.910> lack<00:02:24.120> thereof<00:02:24.720> I'm<00:02:24.989> not<00:02:25.140> really<00:02:25.410> getting

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
the lack thereof I'm not really getting

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.590 
the lack thereof I'm not really getting
much<00:02:25.860> sauce<00:02:26.280> I<00:02:26.489> do<00:02:26.550> taste<00:02:26.880> the<00:02:27.030> cheese<00:02:27.209> I<00:02:27.269> taste

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
much sauce I do taste the cheese I taste

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:28.970 
much sauce I do taste the cheese I taste
the<00:02:27.720> pepperoni<00:02:28.080> and<00:02:28.440> I<00:02:28.500> can<00:02:28.650> taste<00:02:28.830> the

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
the pepperoni and I can taste the

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.620 
the pepperoni and I can taste the
seasoning<00:02:29.190> throughout<00:02:29.730> but<00:02:30.269> their<00:02:30.450> new

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
seasoning throughout but their new

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.780 
seasoning throughout but their new
upgraded<00:02:31.110> tomato<00:02:31.530> sauce<00:02:31.860> I'm<00:02:32.190> not<00:02:32.519> really

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
upgraded tomato sauce I'm not really

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.550 
upgraded tomato sauce I'm not really
tasting<00:02:33.209> and<00:02:33.720> that's<00:02:33.989> kind<00:02:34.260> of<00:02:34.290> a<00:02:34.410> letdown

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
tasting and that's kind of a letdown

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:35.930 
tasting and that's kind of a letdown
because<00:02:34.920> I<00:02:35.070> mean<00:02:35.280> I<00:02:35.370> don't<00:02:35.430> like<00:02:35.640> a<00:02:35.670> ton<00:02:35.910> of

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
because I mean I don't like a ton of

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.120 
because I mean I don't like a ton of
sauce<00:02:36.209> on<00:02:36.239> my<00:02:36.510> pizza<00:02:36.810> but<00:02:37.170> a<00:02:37.200> decent<00:02:37.739> amount<00:02:37.830> to

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
sauce on my pizza but a decent amount to

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:39.440 
sauce on my pizza but a decent amount to
at<00:02:38.220> least<00:02:38.340> taste<00:02:38.670> it<00:02:38.880> especially<00:02:39.330> after

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
at least taste it especially after

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.000 
at least taste it especially after
biting<00:02:39.870> through<00:02:39.989> a<00:02:40.080> thick<00:02:40.320> crust<00:02:40.560> like<00:02:40.799> this

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
biting through a thick crust like this

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.060 
biting through a thick crust like this
it's<00:02:41.580> definitely<00:02:41.850> well<00:02:42.239> needed<00:02:42.799> but<00:02:43.799> for<00:02:43.980> the

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
it's definitely well needed but for the

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:45.740 
it's definitely well needed but for the
de<00:02:44.190> Jonah<00:02:44.430> being<00:02:44.700> what<00:02:44.910> it<00:02:45.030> is<00:02:45.060> I'd<00:02:45.420> give<00:02:45.600> it<00:02:45.690> a

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
de Jonah being what it is I'd give it a

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.690 
de Jonah being what it is I'd give it a
6<00:02:45.989> out<00:02:46.170> of<00:02:46.200> 10<00:02:46.320> I<00:02:46.530> mean<00:02:46.799> it<00:02:46.890> does<00:02:47.040> have<00:02:47.220> a<00:02:47.250> decent

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
6 out of 10 I mean it does have a decent

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.250 
6 out of 10 I mean it does have a decent
amount<00:02:47.790> of<00:02:48.060> flavor<00:02:48.269> and<00:02:48.540> coming<00:02:49.049> from<00:02:49.140> the

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
amount of flavor and coming from the

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.720 
amount of flavor and coming from the
frozen<00:02:49.470> food<00:02:49.830> aisle<00:02:49.980> something<00:02:50.400> I<00:02:50.489> rarely

with<00:03:05.820> that<00:03:06.180> I<00:03:06.620> know<00:03:07.620> there<00:03:07.770> are<00:03:07.860> some<00:03:07.980> coupons

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:08.460 
with that I know there are some coupons

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.520 
with that I know there are some coupons
online<00:03:08.760> for<00:03:09.300> these<00:03:09.450> new<00:03:09.600> pizzas<00:03:09.990> out<00:03:10.170> I<00:03:10.200> will

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
online for these new pizzas out I will

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:11.900 
online for these new pizzas out I will
do<00:03:10.620> my<00:03:10.770> best<00:03:10.920> to<00:03:11.070> put<00:03:11.280> the<00:03:11.340> links<00:03:11.670> down<00:03:11.730> below

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
do my best to put the links down below

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.840 
do my best to put the links down below
but<00:03:12.780> if<00:03:12.870> you<00:03:12.990> do<00:03:13.170> occasionally<00:03:14.040> frozen<00:03:14.520> pizza

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
but if you do occasionally frozen pizza

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:16.430 
but if you do occasionally frozen pizza
I<00:03:15.000> think<00:03:15.270> DiGiorno<00:03:15.660> does<00:03:15.870> one<00:03:16.080> of<00:03:16.200> the<00:03:16.260> better

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
I think DiGiorno does one of the better

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:17.900 
I think DiGiorno does one of the better
pizzas<00:03:16.920> compared<00:03:17.280> to<00:03:17.370> something<00:03:17.520> like<00:03:17.670> a<00:03:17.730> Red

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
pizzas compared to something like a Red

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:19.850 
pizzas compared to something like a Red
Baron<00:03:18.360> or<00:03:18.450> even<00:03:18.630> a<00:03:18.690> toasty<00:03:19.080> no<00:03:19.230> just<00:03:19.620> shortener

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
Baron or even a toasty no just shortener

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.560 
Baron or even a toasty no just shortener
normally<00:03:20.250> does<00:03:20.460> be<00:03:20.640> pretty<00:03:20.880> good<00:03:21.120> and<00:03:21.330> this<00:03:21.420> is

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
normally does be pretty good and this is

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:22.760 
normally does be pretty good and this is
supposed<00:03:21.780> to<00:03:21.840> be<00:03:21.930> somewhat<00:03:22.440> like<00:03:22.560> they're<00:03:22.740> a

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:22.770 
supposed to be somewhat like they're a

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:24.830 
supposed to be somewhat like they're a
higher-end<00:03:23.520> version<00:03:24.000> of<00:03:24.150> their<00:03:24.330> own<00:03:24.510> pizzas

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
higher-end version of their own pizzas

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.150 
higher-end version of their own pizzas
so<00:03:25.380> it's<00:03:25.530> something<00:03:25.800> I<00:03:25.890> would<00:03:25.950> definitely

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
so it's something I would definitely

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.340 
so it's something I would definitely
recommend<00:03:26.490> you<00:03:26.970> guys<00:03:27.000> check<00:03:27.600> out<00:03:27.780> let<00:03:28.200> me<00:03:28.230> know

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:30.170 
recommend you guys check out let me know
what<00:03:28.590> you<00:03:28.680> think<00:03:28.950> and<00:03:29.280> granted<00:03:29.850> these<00:03:30.000> do<00:03:30.150> not

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
what you think and granted these do not

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.180 
what you think and granted these do not
compare<00:03:30.660> nothing<00:03:30.990> to<00:03:31.170> an<00:03:31.290> actual<00:03:31.590> pizzeria

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
compare nothing to an actual pizzeria

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.340 
compare nothing to an actual pizzeria
but<00:03:32.640> the<00:03:32.760> best<00:03:32.910> thing<00:03:33.120> closest<00:03:33.570> to<00:03:33.720> comparison

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
but the best thing closest to comparison

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.140 
but the best thing closest to comparison
would<00:03:34.560> be<00:03:34.620> a<00:03:34.739> 5<00:03:35.010> buck<00:03:35.220> pizza<00:03:35.580> from<00:03:35.820> Little

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
would be a 5 buck pizza from Little

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.030 
would be a 5 buck pizza from Little
