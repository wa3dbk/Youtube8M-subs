00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:06.240
 the noise of road traffic constitutes a 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.720
 Serious and widespread threat to health 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.030
 public 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.530
 at present the public authorities 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.139
 have to bear the costs of insulation 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.040
 acoustic noise barriers and 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.929
 health services 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.970
 but one of the most effective ways 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.039
 and the least expensive to reduce this type 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:24.480
 noise and equip cars with 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.710
 silent tires in europe the tires of 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.029
 cars must pass a test 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.039
 certification is proven 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.800
 meet emission standards before 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.840
 to be marketed rdwr 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.180
 approval authorities installed at 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.770
 Netherlands have a test circuit 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:42.090
 specific for measuring the noise of 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:44.550
 tires a car equipped with tires a 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.200
 tested approaches the test area of 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.700
 microphones are arranged all along the 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.920
 track to capture the sound is loved by 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.440
 the tires when the car low on 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.210
 a good asf has standardized tests and 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.530
 checks and recorded in a cabin 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.910
 of measures the technician installed at 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.620
 the inside monitors the data 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:05.909
 entering and the speed at which the 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:07.500
 vehicle passes between the microphone the 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.010
 instruments records the level of 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.350
 Crest 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:16.290
 that is the maximum noise level 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:18.240
 at the passage of the car so that the 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.850
 engine noise does not interfere with the 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.830
 tire noise measurement the driver 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.830
 engine torque before switching between 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:28.159
 microphones once out of reach he 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.159
 restarts 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.080
 for each node the measurement is 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:39.520
 eight times to provide 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.520
 accurate and consistent results 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.649
 two tire models are tested 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:49.340
 the art moment the other low noise 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:53.210
 10 silent the noise emitted by the tire 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:56.360
 standard was measured at 74 5 decibels 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:58.100
 course of the official homologation test the 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.990
 light gray car is equipped with tires 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.520
 standards 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.920
 the driver and technicians remain 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.560
 in touch to ensure that the 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.440
 car passes well 80 km hour at the level 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.690
 microphones the driver aboard the 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.170
 test area and cut the engine for that 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.880
 only tire noise is recorded 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:20.360
 during this most standard test is 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:22.880
 measured at 74.7 decibels the gap 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.920
 negligible 0.2 decibel shows the 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.380
 high degree of reliability of the different 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.840
 tests 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:31.280
 now let's get a silent tire on 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:35.720
 official certification tests 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:38.200
 recorded 68.3 decibels or 5 good 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:40.489
 decibels less than the standard tire 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:43.070
 his silent tires are mounted on the 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:45.140
 dark gray car the scale of 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:47.079
 decibels is logarithmic what 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.370
 means a reduction of 3 decibels 

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:52.090
 actually decreases the noise level of 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:54.440
 half a reduction of 5 decibels 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:57.290
 represents a decrease in the sound of two 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.299
 third as for the most standard of 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.609
 reference and test results 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:04.760
 Certification and our test measurement 

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:06.560
 match perfectly in this test the 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.299
 difference between the standard tire and the 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:08.950
 quieter is greater than 5 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:11.180
 decibels 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.739
 this impressive reduction of the 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.359
 sound level means that the tires 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:16.519
 mounted on the dark gray car 

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:19.359
 produce only a third of the noise 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:19.359
 issued by standard tires 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:24.769
 in other words a car equipped with 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.840
 standard tires produces the same level 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:29.870
 noise than three cars equipped with 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.549
 silent kno to bring the 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.680
 proof technicians reconfigure the 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:36.079
 instruments in order to control another 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.940
 value now we can compare 

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:40.389
 the passage of a car and that of 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.389
 three cars 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:46.380
 first of all the standard tire model 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.270
 is once again test and noise 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:50.690
 any passenger recalculated as if he were 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:53.010
 put in a second 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:56.400
 with this method the results obtained 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:59.670
 for the standard tire and 74.8 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:01.260
 decibels then the three gray cars 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:03.930
 dark are equipped with different models 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.340
 of silent tires according to the results 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.770
 of European official tests 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:11.120
 they all emit at least 5 decibels 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:11.120
 less than the standard tire 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:15.000
 these cars pass between the pickups 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.380
 as close as possible to any of the 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.760
 other 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.500
 the noise emitted by their tires and 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:23.280
 recalculated on a second 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:25.860
 the result is 74 5 decibels for 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:28.320
 the three vehicles together in 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:31.110
 comparison the car with tires 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.790
 standards had been measured at 74 8 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:34.080
 decibels 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:36.450
 so we can see that on 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:38.940
 road three cars with more 

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:41.460
 silent and m approximately the 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:44.520
 same sound level as a car with 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:46.350
 of standard tires is what the 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:49.080
 silent tires are as safe as the 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:51.030
 standard tires test results 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:53.190
 on track and on road shows that 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:54.840
 quieter can be designed and 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:57.410
 uncompromising products in terms of 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:59.850
 security to demonstrate 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:01.830
 wet braking tests 

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:05.100
 are made on the four models of 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:07.110
 more subject to previous noise tests on 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:08.910
 start by testing the model presenting 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:10.830
 the longest braking distance 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:13.460
 among the four in the tests 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:13.460
 European homologation 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:19.870
 this is one of the silent models 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:23.520
 and we can assume that others have 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:23.520
 a shorter braking distance 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:29.620
 then it's the turn of the standard tire in 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:31.480
 the official European tests and four 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:32.830
 tire models exceeds by at least 20% 

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:35.200
 the minimum requirements 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:41.050
 which means that they are all 

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:43.540
 more very safe unlike 

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:45.160
 expectations the standard tire gets a 

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:46.570
 braking distance on wet ground 

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:48.670
 slightly longer 

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:49.920
 the cones are repositioned relative 

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:52.420
 to the performance of more the standard 

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:54.790
 to see if the quietest are 

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:56.410
 the height and the test is performed a 

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:58.480
 again with the first of the tires 

00:05:56.410 --> 00:06:02.250
 quiet to make sure the 

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:02.250
 first security test were reliable 

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:08.770
 once again the silent tires get 

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:11.830
 well and the result is marked 

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:15.360
 with the cones follow two others 

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:15.360
 silent tire models 

00:06:30.129 --> 00:06:35.090
 all silent models a realistic one 

00:06:33.499 --> 00:06:37.069
 better performance than the tire 

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:40.460
 standard in ground eyrans tests 

00:06:37.069 --> 00:06:42.050
 wet the demonstration proves that he 

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:44.240
 there is no negative correlation between 

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:47.599
 tire noise and performance in 

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:51.199
 silent tire safety matter 

00:06:47.599 --> 00:06:53.689
 are just as safe or even safer than 

00:06:51.199 --> 00:06:55.490
 standard tires his tires that 

00:06:53.689 --> 00:06:57.650
 emit 5 decibels less are already 

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:58.909
 available it's easy to opt for 

00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:00.949
 silent tires during a 

00:06:58.909 --> 00:07:01.520
 renewal of climate and this in 

00:07:00.949 --> 00:07:03.979
 it's worth it 

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:07.279
 road noise could be 

00:07:03.979 --> 00:07:09.529
 reduced by two-thirds which would equate 

00:07:07.279 --> 00:07:13.219
 to eliminate the probe this car on 

00:07:09.529 --> 00:07:14.229
 ten silent tires represents a 

00:07:13.219 --> 00:07:16.370
 immense luck 

00:07:14.229 --> 00:07:18.409
 they provide one solution at a time 

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:20.479
 quick and economical to protect 

00:07:18.409 --> 00:07:22.189
 health and improve the quality of life 

00:07:20.479 --> 00:07:25.930
 at least 210 million Europeans 

00:07:22.189 --> 00:07:25.930
 exposed to road traffic noise
