anyone else
they<00:02:55.320> just<00:02:55.590> link<00:02:55.770> no<00:02:56.250> I<00:02:56.280> think<00:02:56.610> I<00:02:56.730> have<00:02:56.940> I<00:02:57.150> think

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
they just link no I think I have I think

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.690 
they just link no I think I have I think
I<00:02:57.570> have<00:02:57.600> been<00:02:57.989> linked<00:02:58.470> with<00:02:58.530> a<00:02:58.980> couple<00:02:59.610> of

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
I have been linked with a couple of

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.180 
I have been linked with a couple of
people<00:03:00.000> but<00:03:00.180> I<00:03:00.239> think<00:03:00.660> it's<00:03:00.870> a<00:03:01.230> British<00:03:01.770> that's

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
people but I think it's a British that's

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.940 
people but I think it's a British that's
always<00:03:02.550> been<00:03:03.030> overpowering<00:03:04.020> the<00:03:04.440> rest<00:03:04.650> but

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
always been overpowering the rest but

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.680 
always been overpowering the rest but
and<00:03:05.280> that's<00:03:05.430> probably<00:03:05.820> because<00:03:06.420> we<00:03:06.570> are

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
and that's probably because we are

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.800 
and that's probably because we are
friends<00:03:07.140> and<00:03:07.260> not<00:03:07.890> just<00:03:08.220> co-stars<00:03:08.880> so<00:03:09.180> why<00:03:09.780> a

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
friends and not just co-stars so why a

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.479 
friends and not just co-stars so why a
Bollywood<00:03:10.260> films<00:03:10.500> far<00:03:10.739> and<00:03:10.920> if<00:03:10.980> you<00:03:11.100> want<00:03:11.340> you

00:04:34.629 --> 00:04:34.639 
think of the beauty of intimate scenes

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:36.310 
think of the beauty of intimate scenes
is<00:04:34.910> when<00:04:35.150> they're<00:04:35.389> done<00:04:35.630> with<00:04:36.020> a<00:04:36.050> lot<00:04:36.260> of

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:36.320 
is when they're done with a lot of

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.280 
is when they're done with a lot of
dignity<00:04:36.979> and<00:04:37.070> a<00:04:37.190> lot<00:04:37.340> of<00:04:37.460> class<00:04:37.760> and<00:04:38.290> when

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:39.290 
dignity and a lot of class and when

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:41.530 
dignity and a lot of class and when
they're<00:04:39.470> not<00:04:39.760> bombarded<00:04:40.760> just<00:04:41.000> for<00:04:41.210> publicity

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:41.540 
they're not bombarded just for publicity

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:42.909 
they're not bombarded just for publicity
but<00:04:42.050> you<00:04:42.110> don't<00:04:42.260> have<00:04:42.320> anything<00:04:42.500> like<00:04:42.650> a<00:04:42.770> no

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:42.919 
but you don't have anything like a no

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:44.560 
but you don't have anything like a no
kissing<00:04:43.280> policy<00:04:43.699> or<00:04:43.820> anything<00:04:43.970> like<00:04:44.150> that

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:44.570 
kissing policy or anything like that

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:47.350 
kissing policy or anything like that
I<00:04:44.680> don't<00:04:45.680> think<00:04:45.830> it's<00:04:46.250> really<00:04:46.639> necessary<00:04:46.790> to

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:47.360 
I don't think it's really necessary to

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.860 
I don't think it's really necessary to
kiss

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:47.870 
kiss

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.740

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:50.750 
honestly in Indian cinema I think it's

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:53.890 
honestly in Indian cinema I think it's
more<00:04:51.139> about<00:04:51.320> grabbing<00:04:52.070> eyeballs<00:04:52.600> 90%<00:04:53.600> of<00:04:53.720> the

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:53.900 
more about grabbing eyeballs 90% of the

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:55.960 
more about grabbing eyeballs 90% of the
time<00:04:54.110> and<00:04:54.410> when<00:04:55.070> they're<00:04:55.250> beautiful<00:04:55.669> kisses

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:38.240 
industry opens up because it's not about

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.480 
industry opens up because it's not about
networking<00:05:38.810> it's<00:05:39.200> about<00:05:39.470> work<00:05:39.710> at<00:05:39.979> the<00:05:40.130> end<00:05:40.280> of

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:40.490 
networking it's about work at the end of

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:41.860 
networking it's about work at the end of
the<00:05:40.639> day<00:05:40.789> who<00:05:41.060> do<00:05:41.120> you<00:05:41.210> think<00:05:41.360> you<00:05:41.419> make<00:05:41.570> me<00:05:41.750> the

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:41.870 
the day who do you think you make me the

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:44.650 
the day who do you think you make me the
best<00:05:42.020> there<00:05:42.289> with<00:05:42.530> Imran<00:05:43.280> John<00:05:43.820> with<00:05:44.180> ish<00:05:44.360> I

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:44.660 
best there with Imran John with ish I

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:46.450 
best there with Imran John with ish I
think<00:05:44.960> all<00:05:45.110> three<00:05:45.320> of<00:05:45.410> them<00:05:45.620> I<00:05:45.740> mean<00:05:45.979> it<00:05:46.099> would

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:46.460 
think all three of them I mean it would

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:48.700 
think all three of them I mean it would
be<00:05:46.490> really<00:05:46.820> unfair<00:05:47.300> to<00:05:47.360> say<00:05:47.900> who<00:05:48.169> I<00:05:48.200> would<00:05:48.470> make

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:48.710 
be really unfair to say who I would make

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:50.529 
be really unfair to say who I would make
the<00:05:49.190> best<00:05:49.370> pair<00:05:49.639> but<00:05:49.849> I<00:05:49.880> think<00:05:50.210> there's<00:05:50.479> a

00:05:50.529 --> 00:05:50.539 
the best pair but I think there's a

00:05:50.539 --> 00:05:52.779 
the best pair but I think there's a
quality<00:05:51.050> that<00:05:51.320> each<00:05:51.620> of<00:05:51.680> these<00:05:51.979> boys<00:05:52.250> possess

00:05:52.779 --> 00:05:52.789 
quality that each of these boys possess

00:05:52.789 --> 00:05:55.000 
quality that each of these boys possess
and<00:05:53.030> I<00:05:53.090> think<00:05:53.300> I<00:05:53.419> make<00:05:53.599> a<00:05:53.840> great<00:05:54.080> pair<00:05:54.320> opposite

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:55.010 
and I think I make a great pair opposite

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:57.580 
and I think I make a great pair opposite
each<00:05:55.160> of<00:05:55.400> them<00:05:55.610> in<00:05:55.970> in<00:05:56.660> our<00:05:56.840> own<00:05:57.050> special<00:05:57.560> way

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:57.590 
each of them in in our own special way
