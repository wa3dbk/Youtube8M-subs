00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
it and I've already set a project to

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.970 
it and I've already set a project to
work<00:00:24.330> with<00:00:24.539> today<00:00:24.750> so<00:00:24.930> we<00:00:25.260> can<00:00:25.410> test<00:00:25.710> out<00:00:25.949> our

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
work with today so we can test out our

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.250 
work with today so we can test out our
transitions<00:00:26.939> so<00:00:27.630> I'm<00:00:27.720> going<00:00:27.840> to<00:00:27.900> tap<00:00:28.230> that

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
transitions so I'm going to tap that

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.370 
transitions so I'm going to tap that
project<00:00:29.300> I'm<00:00:30.300> gonna<00:00:30.449> open<00:00:30.810> it<00:00:30.960> up<00:00:31.080> in<00:00:31.260> the

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
project I'm gonna open it up in the

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.340 
project I'm gonna open it up in the
timeline<00:00:31.920> and<00:00:32.790> I<00:00:32.969> have<00:00:33.120> just<00:00:33.420> simply<00:00:33.690> added

timeline and I have just simply added

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.240 
timeline and I have just simply added
two<00:00:34.710> video<00:00:35.640> clips<00:00:35.969> and<00:00:36.420> there<00:00:36.780> is<00:00:36.930> a

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:37.250 
two video clips and there is a

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.740 
two video clips and there is a
transition<00:00:38.250> between<00:00:39.030> them

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
transition between them

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.420 
transition between them
so<00:00:40.079> what<00:00:40.260> we're<00:00:40.379> going<00:00:40.500> to<00:00:40.530> work<00:00:40.680> on<00:00:40.890> today<00:00:41.070> is

so what we're going to work on today is
how<00:00:41.460> to<00:00:41.610> add<00:00:41.879> these<00:00:42.239> transitions<00:00:43.170> and<00:00:43.410> modify

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
how to add these transitions and modify

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.860 
how to add these transitions and modify
them<00:00:44.070> a<00:00:44.100> little<00:00:44.340> bit<00:00:44.550> so<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.390> first<00:00:45.600> thing<00:00:45.780> you

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
want to do is tap this transition it's

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.760 
want to do is tap this transition it's
gonna<00:00:50.760> highlight<00:00:51.270> in<00:00:51.420> yellow<00:00:51.600> anything<00:00:52.469> in

lower left you can also change the
duration<00:01:43.020> of<00:01:43.439> all<00:01:43.649> your<00:01:43.890> transitions<00:01:44.579> when

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
duration of all your transitions when

you tap it you have the option of 1/2 a
second<00:01:48.149> all<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.750> way<00:01:48.899> up<00:01:49.200> to<00:01:49.590> 2<00:01:50.329> seconds<00:01:51.329> so

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
second all the way up to 2 seconds so

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.340 
second all the way up to 2 seconds so
there<00:01:52.170> if<00:01:52.439> you<00:01:53.040> are<00:01:53.600> if<00:01:54.600> you<00:01:54.810> like<00:01:54.990> slower

there if you are if you like slower

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.459 
there if you are if you like slower
transitions<00:01:56.189> highlight<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:57.090> 2<00:01:57.299> seconds<00:01:57.840> so

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
transitions highlight the 2 seconds so

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:02.420 
transitions highlight the 2 seconds so
each<00:01:58.770> of<00:01:58.829> the<00:01:59.430> bottom<00:01:59.969> transitions<00:02:00.869> has<00:02:01.710> this

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
each of the bottom transitions has this

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.889 
each of the bottom transitions has this
option<00:02:03.210> there<00:02:03.570> is<00:02:03.600> the<00:02:03.810> star<00:02:04.290> transition<00:02:05.100> I

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:05.899 
option there is the star transition I

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:09.169 
option there is the star transition I
can<00:02:06.899> now<00:02:07.140> make<00:02:07.590> that<00:02:07.649> transition<00:02:08.489> by<00:02:08.789> tapping

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
can now make that transition by tapping

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.360 
can now make that transition by tapping
the<00:02:09.979> timing<00:02:10.979> on<00:02:11.160> it

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
the timing on it

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.980 
the timing on it
I<00:02:11.459> can<00:02:11.760> make<00:02:11.940> it<00:02:12.090> one<00:02:12.360> second<00:02:12.900> by<00:02:13.020> tapping

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
I can make it one second by tapping

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.560 
I can make it one second by tapping
so<00:02:14.470> now<00:02:14.590> I<00:02:14.620> have<00:02:14.920> a<00:02:14.950> one-second<00:02:15.850> transition

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.570 
so now I have a one-second transition

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:20.340 
so now I have a one-second transition
but<00:02:16.990> as<00:02:17.580> you<00:02:18.580> can<00:02:18.790> see<00:02:19.090> the<00:02:19.540> little<00:02:19.840> speaker<00:02:20.080> is

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
but as you can see the little speaker is

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:21.960 
but as you can see the little speaker is
going<00:02:20.500> to<00:02:20.560> give<00:02:20.740> me<00:02:20.890> audio<00:02:21.370> I<00:02:21.580> don't<00:02:21.820> want

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
going to give me audio I don't want

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.430 
going to give me audio I don't want
audio<00:02:22.180> so<00:02:22.570> I'm<00:02:22.630> going<00:02:22.780> to<00:02:22.840> tap<00:02:23.050> the<00:02:23.200> speaker

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
audio so I'm going to tap the speaker

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.130 
audio so I'm going to tap the speaker
I'm<00:02:24.010> going<00:02:24.220> to<00:02:24.280> get<00:02:24.400> the<00:02:24.550> line<00:02:24.760> through<00:02:25.240> now<00:02:26.110> I

I'm going to get the line through now I

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.590 
I'm going to get the line through now I
have<00:02:26.290> a<00:02:26.470> one-second<00:02:27.280> star<00:02:27.490> transition<00:02:28.240> let's
