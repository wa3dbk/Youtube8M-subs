 is to make an adjustment in your home at home claims the signal is very beautiful 

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:16.599
 to make good ones 

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:19.039
 for markets 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:20.759
 no accident 

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:23.779
 I have to believe 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:27.550
 next opponent gets picked up now is another 'or any other boy 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:29.310

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.440
 no singh 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.560
 even by having d 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.450
 burton 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.020
 detained 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:43.610
 instead of vehicles 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.060
 the guild wanted 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:50.860
 the politician of his country in which he is, however, delivering a cargo with the 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:51.630
 idea 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:53.300
 the minister 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:54.789
 of origin of flights 

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:57.040
 so the most important thing here 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.090
 lima henrique has gone back because she 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.730
 cars on the gauge however 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.610

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.560

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.079
 the complaint when writing 

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:19.299
 so if you have a motto in college medicine and you want it to do 

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:22.299
 bringing great demand 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.620
 on the other hand forget me the past when are we going to stay the time we

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.789

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.760
