here
okay<00:01:56.930> we're<00:01:57.170> going<00:01:57.260> to<00:01:57.320> change<00:01:57.620> that<00:01:57.770> when

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
okay we're going to change that when

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.610 
okay we're going to change that when
when<00:01:58.730> we<00:01:58.880> get<00:01:59.090> into<00:01:59.270> it<00:01:59.510> it<00:01:59.750> says<00:02:00.080> physical

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:00.620 
when we get into it it says physical

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:02.320 
when we get into it it says physical
attack<00:02:00.860> by<00:02:01.100> level<00:02:01.460> work<00:02:01.670> or<00:02:01.850> not<00:02:02.030> we're<00:02:02.210> going

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:02.330 
attack by level work or not we're going

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:07.990 
attack by level work or not we're going
to<00:02:02.390> only<00:02:02.630> do<00:02:02.930> energy<00:02:03.290> attack<00:02:03.830> or<00:02:06.310> all<00:02:07.310> attack

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
to only do energy attack or all attack

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.400 
to only do energy attack or all attack
are<00:02:08.300> the<00:02:08.390> only<00:02:08.540> two<00:02:08.810> ones<00:02:09.020> that<00:02:09.200> we're<00:02:09.320> going

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
are the only two ones that we're going

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.550 
are the only two ones that we're going
to<00:02:09.470> allow<00:02:09.740> in<00:02:10.040> those<00:02:10.220> first<00:02:10.430> couple<00:02:10.700> of<00:02:10.940> slots

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
to allow in those first couple of slots

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.100 
to allow in those first couple of slots
so<00:02:12.560> where<00:02:13.220> we<00:02:13.340> add<00:02:13.520> we're<00:02:14.240> going<00:02:14.450> to<00:02:14.510> take<00:02:14.810> this

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
so where we add we're going to take this

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.380 
so where we add we're going to take this
up<00:02:15.470> we<00:02:15.770> can<00:02:15.920> get<00:02:16.130> her<00:02:16.220> up<00:02:16.400> to<00:02:16.430> seven<00:02:17.090> so<00:02:17.360> far

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
up we can get her up to seven so far

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.290 
up we can get her up to seven so far
what's<00:02:17.930> changed<00:02:18.440> these<00:02:18.590> very<00:02:18.890> quickly<00:02:19.300> they

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
what's changed these very quickly they

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.360 
what's changed these very quickly they
made<00:02:20.510> it<00:02:20.660> so<00:02:20.840> much<00:02:20.900> easier<00:02:21.050> now<00:02:21.500> after<00:02:22.220> the

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
made it so much easier now after the

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.670 
made it so much easier now after the
patch<00:02:22.610> part<00:02:23.000> of<00:02:23.090> this<00:02:23.210> so<00:02:23.510> that<00:02:23.660> you<00:02:23.690> can<00:02:24.080> cycle

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
patch part of this so that you can cycle

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.070 
patch part of this so that you can cycle
through<00:02:24.890> these<00:02:25.250> pretty<00:02:25.580> quickly<00:02:26.080> energy

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
through these pretty quickly energy

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.020 
through these pretty quickly energy
attack<00:02:27.440> are<00:02:27.740> all<00:02:27.890> attacker<00:02:28.340> the<00:02:28.610> only<00:02:28.820> two

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
attack are all attacker the only two

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:30.760 
attack are all attacker the only two
ones<00:02:29.270> that<00:02:29.540> I<00:02:29.570> want<00:02:29.780> to<00:02:29.840> keep<00:02:30.110> in<00:02:30.290> this<00:02:30.470> first

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:30.770 
ones that I want to keep in this first

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:33.160 
ones that I want to keep in this first
lot<00:02:31.070> for<00:02:31.340> her<00:02:31.490> and<00:02:31.700> if<00:02:31.850> she<00:02:32.090> was<00:02:32.330> a<00:02:32.360> multi

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
lot for her and if she was a multi

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.530 
lot for her and if she was a multi
attack<00:02:34.070> like<00:02:34.340> she<00:02:34.490> had<00:02:34.580> some<00:02:34.790> physical<00:02:35.270> attack

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
attack like she had some physical attack

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.930 
attack like she had some physical attack
type<00:02:35.810> abilities<00:02:36.380> then<00:02:36.650> I<00:02:36.680> would<00:02:36.920> only<00:02:37.160> do<00:02:37.670> all

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
type abilities then I would only do all

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.600 
type abilities then I would only do all
attack<00:02:38.480> but<00:02:39.230> because<00:02:39.590> she's<00:02:39.860> just<00:02:39.980> an<00:02:40.190> energy

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
attack but because she's just an energy

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.640 
attack but because she's just an energy
attack<00:02:41.000> based<00:02:41.360> character<00:02:42.050> I'm<00:02:42.200> not<00:02:42.410> too

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
attack based character I'm not too

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.440 
attack based character I'm not too
worried<00:02:42.920> about<00:02:43.040> that<00:02:43.220> all<00:02:43.610> attack<00:02:44.000> is<00:02:44.210> fine

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
worried about that all attack is fine

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.680 
worried about that all attack is fine
okay<00:02:45.020> now<00:02:45.680> this<00:02:45.860> one<00:02:46.130> right<00:02:46.310> here<00:02:46.570> but<00:02:47.570> I'm

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
okay now this one right here but I'm

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:51.010 
okay now this one right here but I'm
getting<00:02:47.959> really<00:02:48.230> picky<00:02:48.830> I<00:02:49.010> will<00:02:49.340> only<00:02:49.690> do<00:02:50.690> all

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:51.020 
getting really picky I will only do all

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.440 
getting really picky I will only do all
defense<00:02:51.770> and<00:02:52.160> so<00:02:52.400> like<00:02:52.580> all<00:02:52.820> the<00:02:53.030> offense<00:02:53.270> in

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
defense and so like all the offense in

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.800 
defense and so like all the offense in
that<00:02:53.600> first<00:02:53.870> slot<00:02:54.140> is<00:02:54.380> fine<00:02:54.790> but<00:02:55.790> just<00:02:56.120> for<00:02:56.780> the

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
that first slot is fine but just for the

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.560 
that first slot is fine but just for the
sake<00:02:57.080> of<00:02:57.140> this<00:02:57.380> video<00:02:57.650> I<00:02:58.190> will<00:02:58.250> keep<00:02:58.760> energy

00:02:59.560 --> 00:02:59.570 
sake of this video I will keep energy

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:02.110 
sake of this video I will keep energy
defense<00:03:00.110> or<00:03:00.470> all<00:03:00.800> defense<00:03:01.400> in<00:03:01.640> that<00:03:01.820> and<00:03:02.030> the

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
defense or all defense in that and the

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.540 
defense or all defense in that and the
first<00:03:02.390> couple<00:03:02.630> slots<00:03:03.080> I'm<00:03:03.500> not<00:03:04.130> going<00:03:04.340> to<00:03:04.400> get

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 
first couple slots I'm not going to get

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:06.699 
first couple slots I'm not going to get
ultra<00:03:05.000> picky<00:03:05.390> right<00:03:05.600> now<00:03:05.810> because<00:03:06.260> it<00:03:06.440> takes<00:03:06.590> a

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
ultra picky right now because it takes a

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:08.490 
ultra picky right now because it takes a
lot<00:03:06.890> of<00:03:06.920> time<00:03:07.220> to<00:03:07.430> go<00:03:07.580> through<00:03:07.610> all<00:03:07.820> of<00:03:08.030> them

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
lot of time to go through all of them

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.690 
lot of time to go through all of them
okay<00:03:09.500> that's<00:03:09.800> what<00:03:09.920> we're<00:03:10.040> gonna<00:03:10.130> go<00:03:10.340> hunting

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
okay that's what we're gonna go hunting

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.790 
okay that's what we're gonna go hunting
for<00:03:10.910> right<00:03:11.120> there<00:03:11.330> for<00:03:11.540> biometrics<00:03:12.200> at<00:03:12.440> in<00:03:12.650> the

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:12.800 
for right there for biometrics at in the

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.940 
for right there for biometrics at in the
video<00:03:13.510> OHP<00:03:14.510> by<00:03:14.690> level<00:03:15.080> is<00:03:15.260> good<00:03:15.560> in<00:03:15.800> the<00:03:15.920> first

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
video OHP by level is good in the first

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.509 
video OHP by level is good in the first
slot<00:03:16.550> but<00:03:17.540> after<00:03:17.840> that<00:03:17.989> I<00:03:18.050> only<00:03:18.410> will<00:03:18.560> take<00:03:18.800> HP

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:19.519 
slot but after that I only will take HP

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:22.630 
slot but after that I only will take HP

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
preferred CHP there we're turning out ok

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:36.040 
preferred CHP there we're turning out ok
this<00:03:33.290> morning<00:03:33.769> okay<00:03:34.430> so<00:03:34.489> we're<00:03:35.450> gonna<00:03:35.540> change

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:36.050 
this morning okay so we're gonna change

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:38.530 
this morning okay so we're gonna change
that<00:03:36.350> what's<00:03:36.709> changed<00:03:37.340> that<00:03:37.489> right<00:03:37.760> there<00:03:38.120> in

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
that what's changed that right there in

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.530 
that what's changed that right there in
to<00:03:38.989> say<00:03:39.470> energy<00:03:40.100> defense<00:03:40.550> or<00:03:40.850> all<00:03:41.030> defense

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
to say energy defense or all defense

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.479 
to say energy defense or all defense
optimally<00:03:42.440> I<00:03:42.470> would<00:03:42.709> like<00:03:42.860> to<00:03:43.160> have<00:03:43.310> all

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:43.489 
optimally I would like to have all

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:45.190 
optimally I would like to have all
depends<00:03:44.150> but<00:03:44.269> that's<00:03:44.450> not<00:03:44.600> always<00:03:44.810> the<00:03:44.959> way<00:03:45.080> it

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
depends but that's not always the way it

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:50.770 
depends but that's not always the way it
is<00:03:46.360> not<00:03:47.360> physical<00:03:47.690> defense<00:03:48.320> by<00:03:48.500> level<00:03:49.780> not

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:50.780 
is not physical defense by level not

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.550 
is not physical defense by level not
physical<00:03:51.500> defense

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
physical defense
