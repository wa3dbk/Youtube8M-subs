would<00:05:04.179> be<00:05:04.269> sure<00:05:04.449> of<00:05:04.509> a<00:05:04.539> battle<00:05:04.869> so<00:05:05.049> I<00:05:05.109> just

00:05:05.219 --> 00:05:05.229 
would be sure of a battle so I just

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:09.539 
would be sure of a battle so I just
crash<00:05:06.269> I<00:05:07.649> wasn't<00:05:08.649> attacking<00:05:08.919> but<00:05:09.249> it<00:05:09.339> was<00:05:09.429> no

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:09.549 
crash I wasn't attacking but it was no

00:05:09.549 --> 00:05:11.489 
crash I wasn't attacking but it was no
point<00:05:09.759> I<00:05:10.209> was<00:05:10.779> singing<00:05:10.959> like<00:05:11.019> him<00:05:11.199> attacking

00:05:11.489 --> 00:05:11.499 
point I was singing like him attacking

00:05:11.499 --> 00:05:14.009 
point I was singing like him attacking
to<00:05:11.679> me<00:05:11.829> I<00:05:12.339> had<00:05:12.699> a<00:05:12.729> really<00:05:13.179> good<00:05:13.389> place<00:05:13.629> out<00:05:13.839> of

00:05:14.009 --> 00:05:14.019 
to me I had a really good place out of

00:05:14.019 --> 00:05:16.109 
to me I had a really good place out of
my<00:05:14.109> head<00:05:14.379> it<00:05:15.099> just<00:05:15.279> didn't<00:05:15.519> end<00:05:15.699> up<00:05:15.819> hooking<00:05:15.909> me

00:05:16.109 --> 00:05:16.119 
my head it just didn't end up hooking me

00:05:16.119 --> 00:05:17.770 
my head it just didn't end up hooking me
out

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:17.780 
out

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:20.960 
out
so<00:05:18.780> the<00:05:19.290> sum<00:05:19.440> is<00:05:19.590> a<00:05:19.650> shorter<00:05:20.130> like<00:05:20.610> things<00:05:20.850> a

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:20.970 
so the sum is a shorter like things a

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:24.399 
so the sum is a shorter like things a
lot<00:05:21.150> more<00:05:21.180> if<00:05:21.540> those<00:05:21.690> colludes

00:05:24.399 --> 00:05:24.409 

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:27.699 

he<00:05:25.339> attacks<00:05:25.729> in<00:05:26.449> the<00:05:26.809> wedge<00:05:26.959> counters<00:05:27.379> makes

00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:27.709 
he attacks in the wedge counters makes

00:05:27.709 --> 00:05:30.189 
he attacks in the wedge counters makes
it<00:05:27.830> zero<00:05:28.069> a<00:05:28.219> dog-proof<00:05:28.489> a<00:05:28.879> game<00:05:29.029> and<00:05:29.330> I<00:05:29.539> really

00:05:30.189 --> 00:05:30.199 
it zero a dog-proof a game and I really

00:05:30.199 --> 00:05:32.290 
it zero a dog-proof a game and I really
got<00:05:30.349> destroyed<00:05:30.769> cold<00:05:31.219> is<00:05:31.309> over<00:05:31.639> the<00:05:31.759> two-bit
