00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:03.270 
this video I'm going to be showing you

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:04.910 
this video I'm going to be showing you
how<00:00:03.300> to<00:00:03.449> get<00:00:03.689> accomplishments<00:00:04.470> slightly

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920 
how to get accomplishments slightly

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.430 
how to get accomplishments slightly
easier<00:00:05.190> with<00:00:05.370> your<00:00:05.520> virtual<00:00:05.940> pro<00:00:06.210> so<00:00:06.870> usually

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
easier with your virtual pro so usually

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.049 
easier with your virtual pro so usually
most<00:00:07.620> people<00:00:07.710> just<00:00:08.069> play<00:00:08.189> normal<00:00:08.519> matches<00:00:08.910> but

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
most people just play normal matches but

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:10.220 
most people just play normal matches but
if<00:00:09.179> you<00:00:09.240> weren't<00:00:09.389> doing<00:00:09.510> slightly<00:00:09.870> quicker

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
if you weren't doing slightly quicker

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.440 
if you weren't doing slightly quicker
I'd<00:00:10.590> suggest<00:00:11.070> using<00:00:11.219> this<00:00:11.460> technique<00:00:11.880> so

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
I'd suggest using this technique so

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:13.789 
I'd suggest using this technique so
first<00:00:12.780> you<00:00:12.870> want<00:00:12.990> to<00:00:13.049> create<00:00:13.230> your<00:00:13.440> virtual

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
first you want to create your virtual

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:14.749 
first you want to create your virtual
pro<00:00:14.009> if<00:00:14.099> you<00:00:14.190> haven't<00:00:14.400> done<00:00:14.519> that<00:00:14.580> already

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
pro if you haven't done that already

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.730 
pro if you haven't done that already
give<00:00:15.150> him<00:00:15.240> his<00:00:15.360> name<00:00:15.599> his<00:00:15.780> commentary<00:00:16.289> name<00:00:16.529> is

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
give him his name his commentary name is

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.220 
give him his name his commentary name is
kit<00:00:17.430> number<00:00:17.730> is<00:00:17.820> Asian<00:00:18.210> all<00:00:18.330> that<00:00:18.510> and<00:00:18.720> also

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
kit number is Asian all that and also

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.900 
kit number is Asian all that and also
like<00:00:19.680> what<00:00:19.890> position<00:00:20.369> you<00:00:20.460> want<00:00:20.580> him<00:00:20.670> to<00:00:20.789> be

you want to aim for and I suggest in the
arena<00:00:37.380> ones<00:00:37.680> fast<00:00:37.950> they're<00:00:38.489> pretty<00:00:38.760> simple<00:00:39.030> to

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
arena ones fast they're pretty simple to

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.910 
arena ones fast they're pretty simple to
do<00:00:39.480> and<00:00:39.719> also<00:00:39.870> then<00:00:40.200> you'll<00:00:40.350> give<00:00:40.500> you<00:00:40.620> sort<00:00:40.829> of

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
do and also then you'll give you sort of

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.139 
do and also then you'll give you sort of
a<00:00:41.010> boost<00:00:41.250> when<00:00:41.460> you<00:00:41.579> answer<00:00:41.850> your<00:00:41.940> first

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
a boost when you answer your first

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.930 
a boost when you answer your first
couple<00:00:42.570> matches<00:00:42.719> so<00:00:43.680> for<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.070> arena<00:00:44.430> ones<00:00:44.730> is

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
couple matches so for the arena ones is

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.299 
couple matches so for the arena ones is
probably<00:00:45.629> going<00:00:45.780> to<00:00:45.840> take<00:00:46.020> you<00:00:46.260> around<00:00:46.410> 10<00:00:46.860> 15

probably going to take you around 10 15
minutes<00:00:47.610> to<00:00:47.700> get<00:00:47.850> them<00:00:48.030> all<00:00:48.149> and<00:00:48.329> well<00:00:48.989> for

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
minutes to get them all and well for

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.200 
minutes to get them all and well for
them<00:00:49.350> 10-15<00:00:49.950> minutes<00:00:50.219> is<00:00:50.399> why<00:00:50.670> fix<00:00:50.940> your

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
them 10-15 minutes is why fix your

was hoping you could do it for corners
as<00:01:41.790> well<00:01:41.820> but<00:01:42.270> you<00:01:42.420> can't<00:01:42.689> set<00:01:42.960> up<00:01:42.990> the<00:01:43.229> right

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380

back<00:01:43.619> on<00:01:43.799> them<00:01:43.979> after<00:01:44.579> that<00:01:45.060> I<00:01:45.090> want<00:01:45.329> to<00:01:45.390> ruin

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600

their<00:01:45.840> formation<00:01:46.320> by<00:01:46.470> putting<00:01:46.799> basically<00:01:47.310> ten

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
their formation by putting basically ten

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:48.889 
their formation by putting basically ten

strikers on their team

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.749 
strikers on their team
well<00:01:49.439> not<00:01:49.619> ten<00:01:49.829> strikers<00:01:50.340> about<00:01:50.549> eight

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
well not ten strikers about eight

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.880 
well not ten strikers about eight
strikers<00:01:51.450> and<00:01:51.570> then<00:01:51.689> everyone<00:01:52.229> else<00:01:52.259> slightly

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
strikers and then everyone else slightly

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.190 
strikers and then everyone else slightly
back<00:01:53.070> they<00:01:53.549> have<00:01:53.670> to<00:01:53.790> have<00:01:53.909> one<00:01:54.149> defender<00:01:54.750> but

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
back they have to have one defender but

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.660 
back they have to have one defender but
it<00:01:55.290> leaves<00:01:55.500> you<00:01:55.619> that<00:01:55.799> source<00:01:56.100> side<00:01:56.430> and

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
it leaves you that source side and

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.069 
it leaves you that source side and
defense<00:01:56.969> where<00:01:57.180> you<00:01:57.270> can<00:01:57.390> just<00:01:57.509> run<00:01:57.810> past

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
defense where you can just run past

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.990 
defense where you can just run past
their<00:01:58.350> whole<00:01:58.530> team<00:01:58.799> and<00:01:59.009> it's<00:01:59.579> like<00:01:59.700> a<00:01:59.729> nice

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
their whole team and it's like a nice

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.819 
their whole team and it's like a nice
easy<00:02:00.240> gap<00:02:00.540> to<00:02:00.719> run<00:02:00.869> free<00:02:01.049> of<00:02:01.110> your<00:02:01.229> virtual<00:02:01.590> pro

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
easy gap to run free of your virtual pro

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.249 
easy gap to run free of your virtual pro
so<00:02:02.610> by<00:02:02.909> doing<00:02:02.969> this<00:02:03.420> it<00:02:03.600> makes<00:02:03.780> it<00:02:03.899> easier<00:02:04.229> to

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
so by doing this it makes it easier to

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.219 
so by doing this it makes it easier to
counter-attack<00:02:04.770> as<00:02:05.159> well<00:02:05.310> and<00:02:05.960> once<00:02:06.960> done

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
counter-attack as well and once done

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.070 
counter-attack as well and once done
that<00:02:07.530> go<00:02:08.160> on<00:02:08.280> to<00:02:08.399> their<00:02:08.550> squad<00:02:08.910> and<00:02:09.090> switch

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
that go on to their squad and switch

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.780 
that go on to their squad and switch
their<00:02:10.349> goalkeeper<00:02:10.590> with<00:02:11.160> a<00:02:11.190> striker<00:02:11.610> or

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
their goalkeeper with a striker or

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.220 
their goalkeeper with a striker or
centre<00:02:12.270> back<00:02:12.450> or<00:02:12.629> something<00:02:12.870> like<00:02:12.959> that<00:02:13.020> I

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
centre back or something like that I

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.710 
centre back or something like that I
switch

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
switch

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.660 
switch
the<00:02:13.840> striker<00:02:14.200> and<00:02:14.890> then<00:02:15.010> change<00:02:15.310> their<00:02:15.520> two

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
the striker and then change their two

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.330 
the striker and then change their two
strikers<00:02:16.150> with<00:02:16.600> goalkeepers<00:02:17.320> that<00:02:18.040> doesn't

strikers with goalkeepers that doesn't
really<00:02:18.520> do<00:02:18.760> much<00:02:18.940> but<00:02:19.180> just<00:02:19.300> makes<00:02:19.630> it

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
really do much but just makes it

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.170 
really do much but just makes it
slightly<00:02:19.960> easier<00:02:20.200> and<00:02:20.650> also<00:02:21.340> the<00:02:21.700> rating<00:02:22.090> you

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
slightly easier and also the rating you

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.770 
slightly easier and also the rating you
can<00:02:22.420> change<00:02:22.720> that<00:02:22.870> to<00:02:23.080> one<00:02:23.260> so<00:02:24.070> remember<00:02:24.670> that

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
can change that to one so remember that

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.910 
can change that to one so remember that
but<00:02:25.780> I<00:02:25.810> don't<00:02:26.110> want<00:02:26.260> to<00:02:26.320> change<00:02:26.530> it<00:02:26.650> in<00:02:26.770> this

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
but I don't want to change it in this

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.500 
but I don't want to change it in this
one<00:02:27.130> because<00:02:27.190> it<00:02:27.370> takes<00:02:27.400> a<00:02:27.760> while<00:02:27.790> and<00:02:28.240> well

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
one because it takes a while and well

it's actually in Stanley so you don't

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.700 
it's actually in Stanley so you don't
really<00:02:30.160> need<00:02:30.280> to<00:02:30.400> change<00:02:30.430> it<00:02:30.910> so<00:02:31.870> then<00:02:32.260> make<00:02:32.500> it
