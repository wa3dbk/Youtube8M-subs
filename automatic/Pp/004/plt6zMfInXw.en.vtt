 frantic weekly updates 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.880
 have the interface every week 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.640
 graphic 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.349
 as for it has not changed much hu 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.270
 today proud to present you the 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:26.189
 brand new version 5 0 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:27.809
 no the most remarkable point is 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.300
 precisely this graphical interface 

00:00:27.809 --> 00:00:33.529
 I invite you to discover with me 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.529
 all these new innovations 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:39.180
 the graphical interface of this new 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.770
 go version 5 0 has been completely redesigned 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.790
 to adapt to the needs of workshops 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.600
 maintenance and repair 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:47.340
 automobile the first menu is going 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.820
 naturally concerned the selection of 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.960
 vehicle by clicking on it one accesses 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.970
 the history of the last ten vehicles 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.290
 selected 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:56.730
 Then click on the 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:00.800
 arrow to validate your choice of 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.800
 model then motorization 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.420
 the selection of vehicles can also 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.330
 behave as with version 4 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:16.190
 that is by selecting the 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:16.190
 builder the year 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:26.220
 the model of the vehicle and the engine 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:28.320
 one of the novelties of version 5 0 and 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.659
 the wau bar a search bar 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.820
 intuitive that will save you time 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.159
 just type in the information that 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.899
 you are looking in the wau bar and the 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.340
 software will show you a list of 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:41.580
 corresponding suggestions 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:46.050
 for example to find a 308 rcz 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:47.520
 just type rcz in the rumba you 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.050
 can also enter the engine code 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.880
 in the wau bar to select two 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.560
 vehicles 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:55.409
 finally once the vehicle selected 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.060
 input for example the word brake for 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.520
 quickly find the method for 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.550
 activate or deactivate the brake 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.550
 car park 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.189
 or the diagnostic protocol of the 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.189
 parking brake 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.510
 by this operation we come from 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:25.319
 discover another innovation of -5 0 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:27.720
 the tabs the user may have to 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:30.920
 simultaneous reach of up to 4 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.090
 different information for example 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.340
 in the first tab we can 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.440
 view the activation method 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:43.860
 disabling the parking brake in 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:46.080
 the second the electronic diagnosis and 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:54.269
 in the third tab the location 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:56.370
 of the diagnosis taken finally on the 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:58.290
 last tab of books we can 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:01.040
 display the thickness tolerances of the 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.040
 brake discs 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:07.290
 we can go from a tab to 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.330
 the other to access simultaneously 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:13.099
 all the information needed to 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:13.099
 vehicle maintenance and repair 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:19.500
 we will now discover one of 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:22.170
 major new features of this version 5 0 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:25.410
 this is the src module for 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:27.150
 customer service-receipt through this 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.859
 module the receiver is going to be able 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.320
 each control vehicle returning 

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:32.250
 in professionally workshop 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.920
 relying on a checklist 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.630
 electronically and he may subsequently 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:39.030
 produce a real life to his 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:41.549
 brilliant final which once accepted 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.900
 by this one will constitute an order of 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:44.760
 repair including all 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.620
 complementary operations that the 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.280
 garage will be mentioned during the check 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.989
 of the vehicle 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.400
 find out without delay 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:52.709
 operation of this super module 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.769
 customer reception on the pod at the ECUs 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:57.150
 150 impact is perfectly suited the 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:59.040
 customer reception 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.900
 control operations are displayed 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.850
 by following different stations going 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.160
 from outside the vehicle to 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:08.730
 underbody passing through the cockpit 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:10.590
 the engine compartment and the trunk for 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:12.660
 each control the receiver can 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:15.329
 estimate tests on four levels has 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:19.840
 as damaged b as soon has changed 

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:21.760
 it's like comfort is ok 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:25.930
 the receiver may also 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:28.960
 identified bumps or scrapes or 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:31.080
 still windshield impacts is as well 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.830
 proposed the repair of these 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:35.410
 concerning the comfort option 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:37.210
 this one is very useful to propose 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:39.639
 complementary operations or 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:41.410
 accessories related to comfort at 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:43.720
 aesthetics or safety of the 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:45.479
 vehicle such as a kit to 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:48.699
 pharmacy 

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:49.330
 in parallel with the visual control of 

00:04:48.699 --> 00:04:51.130
 different points 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.870
 the receiver may also 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:54.100
 start a scan of the fault memory 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:57.030
 of all electronic calculators 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:57.030
 embedded 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:07.710
 he will also have access to information 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:09.240
 complementary detailed as by 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:11.460
 example the thickness tolerances of 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:13.050
 brake discs or the time 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:14.669
 recommended by the manufacturer for 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:15.569
 replace the belt 

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:17.610
 of distribution 

00:05:15.569 --> 00:05:19.830
 this information will be very useful 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:22.949
 to produce an accurate quote and 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:25.080
 detailed to customers so after having 

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:26.580
 past the different stations the 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:29.039
 recipient may produce 1 and 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:30.780
 detailed print of the control and this 

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:32.520
 step could be turned into order 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:35.669
 repair after being accepted 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:37.530
 and signed by the customer you come from 

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:40.620
 discover the new version 5 0 of the 

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:41.909
 full of new software all 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:44.430
 these novelties directly influence 

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:46.530
 the efficiency and speed of the work 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:49.319
 repair service in the workshop 

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:51.150
 as for the src module here is the ideal tool 

00:05:49.319 --> 00:05:53.639
 to enjoy every entry of 

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:55.379
 vehicles in the workshop to propose 

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:57.539
 complementary benefits and so 

00:05:55.379 --> 00:06:01.699
 perpetuate your assigns then you 

00:05:57.539 --> 00:06:01.699
 also pass today hero 5 0
