 so I got to her and to 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:12.659
 los angeles airport on friday 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.909
 morning and as soon as that moment has started 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.689
 our low withdrawal was really in 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:20.610
 retirement 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:22.500
 a trip to cars at porn springs where 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.810

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.840

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.700
 white 2 it was the ones in blocks that 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.810

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.220

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.100
 kit that makes a blog but the 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.200
 player has for men 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:46.049
 realization and the third to the 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:51.170
 last it was grunt there is a blogger 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:52.970
 but it makes it makes a bla 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.400
 where they show pictures he 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:59.479
 photographers and videographers he makes 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:02.000

 breasts margats he has the best 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:15.709
 markers of the world in my opinion and then we 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.900
 went to pump springs and all the 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:20.840
 day we took pictures of desert 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:23.720

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.670
 it was really a great experience 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:30.440
 even though there is a lot of that a lot of 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:33.799
 wind what but it's been 3 hours up 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:36.769

00:02:51.470 --> 00:03:00.829
 the post office was frankly just too much 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:04.900
 pretty big champion but here's a 

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:09.890
 large space with a pool and medea 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:11.890

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:14.720
 thanandy food trucks then but 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:17.959
 frankly it was in experience that I 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:21.320
 will have for all married then there is 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:26.030
 bloggers and bloggers 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:28.760

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.840

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:41.239
 experience 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:43.010

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:47.450
 it was the most expensive thing in my case 

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:49.970
 even if one of the famous ethics at 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:51.540
