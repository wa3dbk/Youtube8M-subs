00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
but just don't use regular biomes just

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.530 
but just don't use regular biomes just
use<00:01:49.229> large<00:01:50.100> piles<00:01:50.369> you<00:01:50.820> know<00:01:51.060> through<00:01:51.299> water

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.740 
use large piles you know through water
for<00:01:51.899> another<00:01:52.409> another<00:01:53.009> waterfall<00:01:53.460> okay<00:01:54.240> so

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
for another another waterfall okay so

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.260

another waterfall you use so if you go

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.109 
another waterfall you use so if you go

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.940 
this way is a huge body of water right
here<00:02:09.170> this<00:02:10.170> will<00:02:10.319> make<00:02:10.440> for<00:02:10.470> interesting

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
here this will make for interesting

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.800 
here this will make for interesting
builds<00:02:11.790> very<00:02:12.180> interest

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
builds very interest

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.410 
builds very interest
because<00:02:13.410> this<00:02:13.650> is<00:02:13.860> just<00:02:14.100> like<00:02:14.370> a<00:02:14.400> lake<00:02:14.760> also

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
because this is just like a lake also

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.920 
because this is just like a lake also
like<00:02:16.880> not<00:02:17.880> really<00:02:18.150> like<00:02:18.270> an<00:02:18.390> ocean<00:02:18.690> you<00:02:18.720> can

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
like not really like an ocean you can

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.870 
like not really like an ocean you can
make<00:02:19.080> it<00:02:19.200> an<00:02:19.350> ocean<00:02:19.650> actually<00:02:19.800> if<00:02:20.490> you<00:02:20.670> just

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
make it an ocean actually if you just

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.030 
make it an ocean actually if you just
dispose<00:02:21.330> of<00:02:21.360> this<00:02:21.600> and<00:02:22.380> that's<00:02:22.590> right<00:02:22.800> here

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
dispose of this and that's right here

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.160 
dispose of this and that's right here
it's<00:02:23.580> gonna<00:02:24.000> be<00:02:24.090> kind<00:02:24.390> of<00:02:24.480> like<00:02:24.540> an<00:02:24.780> ocean<00:02:24.900> that

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
it's gonna be kind of like an ocean that

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.230 
it's gonna be kind of like an ocean that
kind<00:02:25.350> of<00:02:25.410> like<00:02:25.530> a<00:02:25.560> sea<00:02:25.920> you<00:02:26.700> could<00:02:26.880> use<00:02:26.970> it<00:02:27.090> like

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
kind of like a sea you could use it like

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.660 
kind of like a sea you could use it like
a<00:02:27.270> sea<00:02:27.569> I<00:02:27.600> guess<00:02:27.900> so<00:02:28.860> that's<00:02:29.040> the<00:02:29.370> most

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
a sea I guess so that's the most

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.070 
a sea I guess so that's the most
interesting<00:02:30.150> thing<00:02:30.330> is<00:02:30.420> also<00:02:30.780> I<00:02:30.810> want<00:02:31.020> to

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
your spawn which is always important for

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.300 
your spawn which is always important for
