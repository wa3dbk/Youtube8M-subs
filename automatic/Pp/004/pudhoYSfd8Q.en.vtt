00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:07.649
 hello, recently launched a new and 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:12.840
 which resulted in steel in the forests or 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:16.230
 arch goblin from them drop out the letter skin 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:20.040
 in useful things and the question is how 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.560
 they can be conveniently killed so as not to spoil 

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:24.080
 no swords and armor 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:28.470
 today I will show how to make simple 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:31.400
 cheap punched to goblins well and 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.400
 took advantage 

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:38.860
 best two to do at the border 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:44.130
 cities where there is still a drive but no longer 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:50.820
 walls and where easy is your own goblins 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:50.820
 the first task is to lure them knocked out to 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.179
 they spawn next 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:01:01.380
 kill with the help of you enough 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:05.160
 go inside and goblins 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:07.309
 who swim well now I find myself 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.309
 inside 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:15.950
 before goblins sank like an elf 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:20.490
 so the health of the killer is yamano 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:23.610
 chopped fell in a pit of water and died 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:33.380
 now they fall into such an inverted 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:39.570
 am that is the whole problem is how to find 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:42.830
 a place where you can get away from them because 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.830
 that they run fast 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:52.520
 usually when 4 goblins meet 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:57.140
 quite difficult to kill 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:02:01.310
 therefore the armor won significantly 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:04.509
 it is more convenient to look for them not to beat in the medic's armor 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.509
 who wake himself 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:14.410
 and that way 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.410
 collect a lot of its skins 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:21.060
 on 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.019
 from regeneration mirage 2 gianni 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:33.640
 but you can get a lot of goblins right away 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.640
 stored in one trap 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:45.570
 that's how we work
