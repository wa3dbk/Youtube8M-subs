00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.890 
of each part of the case if you don't do
that<00:01:23.159> I'll<00:01:23.909> notice<00:01:24.210> some<00:01:24.390> people<00:01:24.659> haven't

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
that I'll notice some people haven't

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.249 
that I'll notice some people haven't
when<00:01:25.500> they're<00:01:25.619> showing<00:01:26.130> you<00:01:26.220> how<00:01:26.310> to<00:01:26.340> use<00:01:26.460> this

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:27.259 
when they're showing you how to use this

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:29.810 
when they're showing you how to use this
they<00:01:28.259> end<00:01:28.409> up<00:01:28.500> having<00:01:28.710> to<00:01:28.799> snap<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.369> case<00:01:29.549> into

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
they end up having to snap the case into

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.060 
they end up having to snap the case into
place<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:30.240> that<00:01:30.299> shouldn't<00:01:30.900> be<00:01:31.049> it<00:01:31.170> once<00:01:31.950> you

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
place and that shouldn't be it once you

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.120 
place and that shouldn't be it once you
get<00:01:32.220> those<00:01:32.400> in<00:01:32.610> place<00:01:32.790> it<00:01:33.210> should<00:01:33.540> slide<00:01:33.840> up

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
get those in place it should slide up

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.010 
get those in place it should slide up
just<00:01:35.130> like<00:01:35.280> that<00:01:35.340> I<00:01:35.700> mean<00:01:35.880> it's<00:01:36.000> super<00:01:36.420> easy<00:01:36.450> to

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
just like that I mean it's super easy to

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.600 
just like that I mean it's super easy to
install<00:01:38.060> and<00:01:39.060> then<00:01:39.450> on<00:01:40.110> each<00:01:40.619> side<00:01:40.920> you<00:01:41.369> have

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
install and then on each side you have

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.810 
install and then on each side you have
these<00:01:41.970> little<00:01:42.119> notches<00:01:42.659> that<00:01:43.380> will<00:01:43.820> slowly

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
these little notches that will slowly

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.219 
these little notches that will slowly
push<00:01:45.630> up<00:01:45.899> and<00:01:46.189> snap<00:01:47.189> into<00:01:47.399> place<00:01:47.490> on<00:01:48.030> each<00:01:48.840> side

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
push up and snap into place on each side

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.510 
push up and snap into place on each side
of<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:50.460> tablet<00:01:51.140> once<00:01:52.140> that's<00:01:52.380> done<00:01:52.649> you<00:01:52.979> close

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
of the tablet once that's done you close

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.620 
of the tablet once that's done you close
the<00:01:53.759> lid<00:01:53.970> and<00:01:54.829> you<00:01:55.829> just<00:01:55.979> push<00:01:56.219> down<00:01:56.250> and<00:01:57.090> it's

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
the lid and you just push down and it's

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.679 
the lid and you just push down and it's
on<00:01:57.780> I<00:01:58.079> mean<00:01:58.320> it's<00:01:58.500> I<00:01:58.740> wouldn't<00:01:59.490> any<00:02:00.030> in<00:02:00.329> any<00:02:00.479> way

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
on I mean it's I wouldn't any in any way

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.080 
on I mean it's I wouldn't any in any way
compare<00:02:01.170> this<00:02:01.350> to<00:02:01.729> something<00:02:02.729> like<00:02:02.909> the

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
compare this to something like the

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.289 
compare this to something like the
otterbox<00:02:03.509> I<00:02:04.250> would<00:02:05.250> not<00:02:05.490> recommend<00:02:05.729> dropping

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
otterbox I would not recommend dropping

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.070 
otterbox I would not recommend dropping
your<00:02:06.869> your<00:02:07.530> zoom<00:02:08.009> in<00:02:08.310> this<00:02:08.520> case<00:02:08.729> but<00:02:09.599> it<00:02:09.840> does

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
your your zoom in this case but it does

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.839 
your your zoom in this case but it does
provide<00:02:10.590> protection<00:02:11.340> from<00:02:11.430> hitting<00:02:11.700> it

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
provide protection from hitting it

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.500 
provide protection from hitting it
against<00:02:12.090> the<00:02:12.180> wall<00:02:12.390> what

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
against the wall what

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.979 
against the wall what
or<00:02:13.599> you<00:02:14.019> know<00:02:14.110> maybe<00:02:14.140> a<00:02:14.379> small<00:02:14.860> minor<00:02:15.370> drop<00:02:15.989> and

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:16.989 
or you know maybe a small minor drop and

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:19.170 
or you know maybe a small minor drop and
it<00:02:17.140> does<00:02:17.170> protect<00:02:17.650> all<00:02:18.129> the<00:02:18.280> edges<00:02:18.670> as<00:02:18.879> you<00:02:19.030> can

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
it does protect all the edges as you can

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.559 
it does protect all the edges as you can
tell<00:02:19.739> every<00:02:20.739> edge<00:02:20.890> is<00:02:21.220> covered<00:02:21.909> with<00:02:21.939> with<00:02:22.390> the

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:22.569 
tell every edge is covered with with the

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:25.710 
tell every edge is covered with with the
plastic<00:02:23.099> but<00:02:24.099> it<00:02:24.400> is<00:02:24.670> not<00:02:24.819> anywhere<00:02:25.569> near

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
plastic but it is not anywhere near

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.600 
plastic but it is not anywhere near
compared<00:02:26.470> to<00:02:26.560> something<00:02:26.769> like<00:02:26.890> the<00:02:27.129> otterbox

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
compared to something like the otterbox

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.380 
compared to something like the otterbox
in<00:02:27.939> as<00:02:28.030> far<00:02:28.180> as<00:02:28.299> protection<00:02:28.739> now<00:02:29.739> to<00:02:29.799> address

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
in as far as protection now to address

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.550 
in as far as protection now to address
some<00:02:31.390> of<00:02:31.420> the<00:02:31.569> damage<00:02:31.750> issues<00:02:32.049> that<00:02:32.440> people

the video there's a small niche on the

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:59.490 
the video there's a small niche on the
outside<00:02:57.099> right<00:02:57.280> here<00:02:57.870> and<00:02:58.870> here's<00:02:59.290> the<00:02:59.379> other

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
outside right here and here's the other

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:04.670 
outside right here and here's the other
one<00:02:59.620> right<00:02:59.889> by<00:03:00.190> the<00:03:00.299> the<00:03:02.040> headphone<00:03:03.040> jack

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
one right by the the headphone jack

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.069 
one right by the the headphone jack
there's<00:03:05.680> two<00:03:06.040> small<00:03:06.400> scuffs<00:03:06.940> they're<00:03:07.870> very

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:08.079 
there's two small scuffs they're very

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:10.319 
there's two small scuffs they're very
surface<00:03:08.440> it's<00:03:08.889> not<00:03:09.069> discuss<00:03:09.849> I<00:03:10.030> think<00:03:10.209> it's

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:10.329 
surface it's not discuss I think it's

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:13.910 
surface it's not discuss I think it's
actually<00:03:10.510> just<00:03:10.870> the<00:03:10.959> coating<00:03:11.500> on<00:03:11.680> the<00:03:12.810> zoom

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
actually just the coating on the zoom

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.550 
actually just the coating on the zoom
but<00:03:14.920> those<00:03:15.519> took<00:03:16.000> I<00:03:16.389> mean<00:03:16.840> I<00:03:16.870> had<00:03:17.079> the<00:03:17.200> case<00:03:17.379> for

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
but those took I mean I had the case for

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.860 
but those took I mean I had the case for
two<00:03:17.680> hours<00:03:17.829> before<00:03:18.129> I<00:03:18.310> noticed<00:03:18.699> that<00:03:18.879> and<00:03:19.120> you

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
two hours before I noticed that and you

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.530 
two hours before I noticed that and you
know<00:03:19.989> I<00:03:20.019> checked<00:03:20.699> this<00:03:21.699> right<00:03:22.000> here<00:03:22.239> to<00:03:22.329> kind

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
know I checked this right here to kind

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.680 
know I checked this right here to kind
of<00:03:22.599> see<00:03:22.870> you<00:03:23.859> know<00:03:24.220> maybe<00:03:24.489> if<00:03:25.299> there<00:03:25.569> was

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
of see you know maybe if there was

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:27.270 
of see you know maybe if there was
something<00:03:25.870> here<00:03:26.199> like<00:03:26.349> a<00:03:26.379> Ridge<00:03:26.680> or<00:03:26.980> a<00:03:27.040> notch

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
something here like a Ridge or a notch

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.869 
something here like a Ridge or a notch
that<00:03:27.609> was<00:03:27.730> going<00:03:27.849> to<00:03:27.910> do<00:03:28.030> anything<00:03:28.449> and<00:03:28.829> I

00:03:29.869 --> 00:03:29.879 
that was going to do anything and I

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:32.189 
that was going to do anything and I
didn't<00:03:30.879> really<00:03:31.000> notice<00:03:31.209> me<00:03:31.419> because<00:03:31.690> I'm<00:03:32.019> a

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:32.199 
didn't really notice me because I'm a

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:34.289 
didn't really notice me because I'm a
leech<00:03:32.410> echt<00:03:32.680> at<00:03:32.799> the<00:03:32.889> top<00:03:33.129> here<00:03:33.519> at<00:03:34.030> the<00:03:34.150> edge

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:34.299 
leech echt at the top here at the edge

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:38.729 
leech echt at the top here at the edge
and<00:03:34.780> I<00:03:35.319> didn't<00:03:36.069> feel<00:03:36.250> anything<00:03:36.549> further<00:03:37.739> now

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:38.739 
and I didn't feel anything further now

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:46.199 
and I didn't feel anything further now
on<00:03:39.639> this<00:03:40.540> case<00:03:41.879> at<00:03:42.879> the<00:03:43.120> very<00:03:43.919> bottom<00:03:45.209> there's

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:46.209 
on this case at the very bottom there's

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:49.979 
on this case at the very bottom there's
molding<00:03:47.669> ridges<00:03:48.669> when<00:03:49.510> they<00:03:49.629> make<00:03:49.810> these

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:49.989 
molding ridges when they make these

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:52.470 
molding ridges when they make these
plastic<00:03:50.560> pieces<00:03:51.250> they're<00:03:51.730> made<00:03:51.970> from<00:03:52.120> a<00:03:52.299> mold

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
plastic pieces they're made from a mold

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.319 
plastic pieces they're made from a mold
and<00:03:52.870> then<00:03:53.799> they<00:03:53.919> pop<00:03:54.370> him<00:03:54.549> off<00:03:54.639> these<00:03:54.879> molds

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:55.329 
and then they pop him off these molds

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:56.789 
and then they pop him off these molds
and<00:03:55.419> they<00:03:55.629> finish<00:03:56.049> them<00:03:56.230> and<00:03:56.379> they<00:03:56.440> send<00:03:56.680> them

00:03:56.789 --> 00:03:56.799 
and they finish them and they send them

00:03:56.799 --> 00:03:59.189 
and they finish them and they send them
off<00:03:57.209> down<00:03:58.209> the<00:03:58.329> line<00:03:58.359> assembly<00:03:58.810> line<00:03:59.079> or

whatever well on this piece especially
in<00:04:04.030> this<00:04:04.780> area<00:04:05.489> there's<00:04:06.489> some<00:04:06.900> molding<00:04:07.900> that

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:08.109 
in this area there's some molding that

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:10.229 
in this area there's some molding that
wasn't<00:04:08.500> finished<00:04:08.709> off<00:04:09.010> it<00:04:09.489> kind<00:04:09.639> of<00:04:09.760> upset<00:04:10.120> me

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:10.239 
wasn't finished off it kind of upset me

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:12.809 
wasn't finished off it kind of upset me
because<00:04:10.329> that's<00:04:10.569> a<00:04:10.780> that's<00:04:11.109> a<00:04:11.379> design<00:04:12.370> flaw<00:04:12.699> in

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:14.969 
because that's a that's a design flaw in
my<00:04:12.940> opinion<00:04:13.239> they<00:04:13.479> should<00:04:13.510> have<00:04:13.979> gotten

00:04:14.969 --> 00:04:14.979 
my opinion they should have gotten

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:18.479 
my opinion they should have gotten
sandpaper<00:04:15.669> and<00:04:16.000> finished<00:04:16.659> these<00:04:17.099> these<00:04:18.099> small

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 
sandpaper and finished these these small

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:22.140 
sandpaper and finished these these small
little<00:04:18.780> grooves<00:04:19.780> off<00:04:20.430> those<00:04:21.430> are<00:04:21.849> what

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:22.150 
little grooves off those are what

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:24.600 
little grooves off those are what
scratched<00:04:22.659> the<00:04:23.289> top<00:04:23.560> up<00:04:23.800> here<00:04:23.860> because<00:04:24.430> when<00:04:24.580> I

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
scratched the top up here because when I

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:26.100 
scratched the top up here because when I
closed<00:04:25.030> it

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
closed it

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:29.440 
closed it
the<00:04:27.110> the<00:04:27.590> grooves<00:04:27.890> are<00:04:28.160> right<00:04:28.310> here<00:04:28.700> and<00:04:28.880> here

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:29.450 
the the grooves are right here and here

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:32.920 
the the grooves are right here and here
and<00:04:29.740> they<00:04:30.740> just<00:04:30.920> barely<00:04:31.460> touch<00:04:31.760> that<00:04:32.270> classic

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:32.930 
and they just barely touch that classic

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:34.240 
and they just barely touch that classic
but<00:04:33.050> just<00:04:33.320> they're<00:04:33.500> so<00:04:33.530> tiny<00:04:34.070> and

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.250 
but just they're so tiny and

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:36.640 
but just they're so tiny and
inconspicuous<00:04:34.790> you<00:04:35.210> wouldn't<00:04:35.450> notice<00:04:35.570> it<00:04:35.870> but

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650 
inconspicuous you wouldn't notice it but

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:38.260 
inconspicuous you wouldn't notice it but
they<00:04:36.860> were<00:04:36.920> just<00:04:37.280> enough<00:04:37.610> to<00:04:37.760> do<00:04:37.850> damage<00:04:37.880> to

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.270 
they were just enough to do damage to

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:40.780 
they were just enough to do damage to
that<00:04:38.450> so<00:04:38.900> if<00:04:39.050> you<00:04:39.170> get<00:04:39.350> this<00:04:39.410> case<00:04:39.800> the<00:04:40.610> first

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:40.790 
that so if you get this case the first

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:43.480 
that so if you get this case the first
thing<00:04:41.000> I<00:04:41.090> would<00:04:41.150> do<00:04:41.360> is<00:04:42.040> run<00:04:43.040> your<00:04:43.160> finger

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:43.490 
thing I would do is run your finger

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:46.090 
thing I would do is run your finger
right<00:04:43.520> here<00:04:43.730> and<00:04:44.320> right<00:04:45.320> here<00:04:45.590> and<00:04:45.950> if<00:04:46.010> you

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:46.100 
right here and right here and if you

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:49.030 
right here and right here and if you
feel<00:04:46.370> plastic<00:04:47.090> I<00:04:47.330> would<00:04:48.200> get<00:04:48.350> some<00:04:48.530> extremely

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:49.040 
feel plastic I would get some extremely

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:52.180 
feel plastic I would get some extremely
fine<00:04:49.400> grit<00:04:49.760> sandpaper<00:04:49.790> or<00:04:50.720> maybe<00:04:51.680> an<00:04:51.830> emery

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:52.190 
fine grit sandpaper or maybe an emery

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:54.250 
fine grit sandpaper or maybe an emery
board<00:04:52.430> or<00:04:52.790> even<00:04:53.300> your<00:04:53.390> fingernail<00:04:53.870> and<00:04:54.080> you

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:54.260 
board or even your fingernail and you

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.590 
board or even your fingernail and you
can<00:04:54.440> scrape<00:04:54.860> that<00:04:55.070> down<00:04:55.130> and<00:04:55.640> just<00:04:55.850> get<00:04:56.360> it<00:04:56.450> to

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:56.600 
can scrape that down and just get it to

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:59.380 
can scrape that down and just get it to
where<00:04:56.750> it's<00:04:57.080> it's<00:04:57.890> not<00:04:58.250> a<00:04:58.280> ridge<00:04:58.580> anymore<00:04:59.120> and

00:04:59.380 --> 00:04:59.390 
where it's it's not a ridge anymore and

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:01.450 
where it's it's not a ridge anymore and
when<00:05:00.290> you<00:05:00.380> close<00:05:00.680> it<00:05:00.710> you<00:05:00.950> shouldn't

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:01.460 
when you close it you shouldn't

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:03.010 
when you close it you shouldn't
experienced<00:05:01.970> the<00:05:02.090> same<00:05:02.240> thing<00:05:02.300> that<00:05:02.600> that<00:05:02.990> I

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:03.020 
experienced the same thing that that I

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:04.750 
experienced the same thing that that I
did<00:05:03.380> and<00:05:03.560> the<00:05:03.800> same<00:05:03.980> thing<00:05:04.190> that<00:05:04.340> many<00:05:04.580> other

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:04.760 
did and the same thing that many other

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:09.460 
did and the same thing that many other
people<00:05:05.120> experienced<00:05:07.060> another<00:05:08.260> portion<00:05:09.260> of

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:09.470 
people experienced another portion of

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:10.630 
people experienced another portion of
the<00:05:09.560> case<00:05:09.740> that<00:05:09.950> people<00:05:10.220> were<00:05:10.340> complaining

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:10.640 
the case that people were complaining

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:15.280 
the case that people were complaining
about<00:05:11.030> damaging<00:05:11.960> is<00:05:12.110> where<00:05:12.920> these<00:05:14.290> these

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:15.290 
about damaging is where these these

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:18.760 
about damaging is where these these
little<00:05:15.730> clips<00:05:16.730> that<00:05:17.600> hold<00:05:17.840> the<00:05:17.990> zoom<00:05:18.350> in<00:05:18.500> place

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:18.770 
little clips that hold the zoom in place

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:22.060 
little clips that hold the zoom in place
once<00:05:19.070> you're<00:05:19.250> closing<00:05:19.820> it<00:05:20.060> up<00:05:20.150> our<00:05:20.990> that<00:05:21.890> I

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:22.070 
once you're closing it up our that I

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:23.350 
once you're closing it up our that I
guess<00:05:22.280> some<00:05:22.430> people<00:05:22.670> reporting<00:05:23.090> that<00:05:23.180> would

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:23.360 
guess some people reporting that would

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.450 
guess some people reporting that would
scratch<00:05:23.690> the<00:05:23.930> side<00:05:24.140> I<00:05:24.380> haven't<00:05:24.800> noticed<00:05:25.250> that

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:25.460 
scratch the side I haven't noticed that

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:28.780 
scratch the side I haven't noticed that
on<00:05:25.580> mine<00:05:25.790> yet<00:05:26.000> it<00:05:26.680> it<00:05:27.680> might<00:05:28.070> be<00:05:28.280> a<00:05:28.310> little<00:05:28.550> bit

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:28.790 
on mine yet it it might be a little bit

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:30.610 
on mine yet it it might be a little bit
but<00:05:28.940> I<00:05:29.030> haven't<00:05:29.450> honestly<00:05:30.050> with<00:05:30.230> with<00:05:30.590> a

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:30.620 
but I haven't honestly with with a

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:33.070 
but I haven't honestly with with a
nekkid<00:05:30.980> I<00:05:31.040> I<00:05:31.070> can't<00:05:31.430> see<00:05:31.610> any<00:05:31.820> scratches<00:05:32.480> but<00:05:33.020> I

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:33.080 
nekkid I I can't see any scratches but I

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:34.780 
nekkid I I can't see any scratches but I
think<00:05:33.320> over<00:05:33.500> time<00:05:33.530> maybe<00:05:33.950> that'll<00:05:34.190> change<00:05:34.400> it

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:34.790 
think over time maybe that'll change it

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:37.260 
think over time maybe that'll change it
might<00:05:35.120> end<00:05:35.450> up<00:05:35.720> scratching<00:05:36.110> it<00:05:36.470> eventually

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:37.270 
might end up scratching it eventually

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:39.190 
might end up scratching it eventually
but<00:05:38.270> I've<00:05:38.420> read<00:05:38.630> that<00:05:38.780> some<00:05:38.930> people<00:05:39.170> have

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:39.200 
but I've read that some people have

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.940 
but I've read that some people have
actually<00:05:39.550> gotten<00:05:40.550> their<00:05:40.940> sandpaper<00:05:41.810> in<00:05:41.960> knots

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:42.950 
actually gotten their sandpaper in knots

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:45.580 
actually gotten their sandpaper in knots
and<00:05:43.130> paper<00:05:43.370> well<00:05:44.300> Jermel<00:05:44.750> or<00:05:44.960> I<00:05:44.990> guess<00:05:45.470> you

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:45.590 
and paper well Jermel or I guess you

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:47.890 
and paper well Jermel or I guess you
could<00:05:45.620> use<00:05:45.830> sandpaper<00:05:46.070> and<00:05:46.460> filed<00:05:47.330> those

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:47.900 
could use sandpaper and filed those

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:50.170 
could use sandpaper and filed those
little<00:05:48.200> ridges<00:05:48.590> down<00:05:48.880> to<00:05:49.880> where<00:05:50.000> they<00:05:50.060> were

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:50.180 
little ridges down to where they were

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:52.930 
little ridges down to where they were
gone<00:05:50.480> but<00:05:51.050> I<00:05:51.290> honestly<00:05:51.620> like<00:05:52.100> how<00:05:52.370> it<00:05:52.520> holds

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:52.940 
gone but I honestly like how it holds

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:55.930 
gone but I honestly like how it holds
the<00:05:53.750> zoom<00:05:54.020> there<00:05:54.430> you<00:05:55.430> know<00:05:55.520> holds<00:05:55.760> it<00:05:55.850> in

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:55.940 
the zoom there you know holds it in

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:57.310 
the zoom there you know holds it in
place<00:05:55.970> and<00:05:56.180> when<00:05:56.540> you're<00:05:56.660> ready<00:05:56.690> to<00:05:56.930> use<00:05:56.960> it

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:57.320 
place and when you're ready to use it

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:59.800 
place and when you're ready to use it
you<00:05:57.920> put<00:05:58.160> you<00:05:58.670> know<00:05:58.700> you<00:05:58.850> put<00:05:59.060> one<00:05:59.210> thumb<00:05:59.480> here

00:05:59.800 --> 00:05:59.810

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:01.900 
you put you know you put one thumb here
put<00:06:00.680> the<00:06:00.800> other<00:06:00.920> one<00:06:00.980> here<00:06:01.280> and<00:06:01.400> you<00:06:01.520> just<00:06:01.670> kind

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:01.910 
put the other one here and you just kind

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:04.720 
put the other one here and you just kind
of<00:06:02.350> push<00:06:03.350> those<00:06:03.620> back<00:06:03.890> a<00:06:03.920> little<00:06:04.190> bit<00:06:04.400> and<00:06:04.640> then

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:04.730 
of push those back a little bit and then

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:06.610 
of push those back a little bit and then
I<00:06:04.790> put<00:06:05.000> my<00:06:05.120> thumb's<00:06:05.420> underneath<00:06:05.870> and<00:06:06.170> just
