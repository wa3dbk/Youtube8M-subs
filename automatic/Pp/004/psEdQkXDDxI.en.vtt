00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.090
 yes a magnet on around 85 

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:08.429
 from Telefunken 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.429
 Scene is a there is this button 

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:14.199
 and then 

00:00:14.199 --> 00:00:16.129
 drifts here 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:19.129
 Marcel SchÃ¼tz Bonde auf 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:22.630
 what she meant is fire 

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:26.249
 Novartis with Bayer and in it founded Mio 

00:00:27.659 --> 00:00:30.659
 AR 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:34.680
 uncommented 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.680
 head Start 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.970
 we need one 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.210
 strengthen the program 1 year 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.730
 the 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.730
 sorry but counteract 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.550
 a little bit 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.550
 the concrete reasons 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.800
 be expanded 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.960
 just suppress 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.560
 the big effort or still required 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.940
 but also to drive 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:24.520
 just signed Paris 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.520
 dpa 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.590
 head Start 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:35.590
 Schilberg 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:42.700
 give it like that 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.500
 blessing 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:45.799
 but no danger 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:49.100
 Gammertingen the speed Grunder 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.729
 are named in the butt there we have 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:58.160
 you get to five inches 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.250
 betting 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:05.590
 I'll probably not yet clarified, he is hardly anything 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:06.750
 emotional 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.520
 which is however for the PID and only think that you with this profile 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.329
 presses 

00:02:12.329 --> 00:02:13.839
 for the most part 

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:16.209
 but later she carries up 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:17.979
 function 

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:20.089
 turned on Kirste 

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:22.899
 first also because is not completely deleted 

00:02:22.899 --> 00:02:26.399
 In addition, there is still the function according to the devices achieve 

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:30.409
 then you also hear in front of the microphone 

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:33.409
 or could do the moments when shooting 

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:37.729
 here is very strong 

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:41.329
 because before entrance and for this the microphone radio entrance 

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:45.139
 the victory goes to the Boom Scholten tips 

00:02:45.139 --> 00:02:49.239
 This will be the carriage description of the magnet to around 500 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:50.719
 80 

00:02:50.719 --> 00:02:52.699
 ARD in stage 

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:55.070
 what so Much off exactly yes 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:56.840
 Team had Skibbe Tappe out of it
