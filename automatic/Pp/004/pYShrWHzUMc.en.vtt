00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
out so that he doesn't realize that

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.840 
out so that he doesn't realize that
equity<00:00:55.110> we<00:00:55.680> asked<00:00:55.829> to<00:00:56.010> scale<00:00:56.219> what<00:00:56.370> factors

equity we asked to scale what factors

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.069 
equity we asked to scale what factors
you<00:00:57.000> should<00:00:57.030> be<00:00:57.239> considering<00:00:57.780> when<00:00:57.899> you're

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
you should be considering when you're

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.170 
you should be considering when you're
thinking<00:00:58.379> of<00:00:58.559> betting<00:00:58.920> for<00:00:59.129> value<00:00:59.489> there's

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
thinking of betting for value there's

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.549 
thinking of betting for value there's
really<00:01:00.300> two<00:01:00.600> main<00:01:00.629> reasons<00:01:01.140> when<00:01:01.440> you're

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
really two main reasons when you're

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.170 
really two main reasons when you're
betting<00:01:01.800> for<00:01:01.949> value<00:01:02.250> that<00:01:02.399> you<00:01:02.579> should<00:01:02.760> be<00:01:02.879> or

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
betting for value that you should be or

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.729 
betting for value that you should be or
two<00:01:03.420> main<00:01:03.629> factors<00:01:04.049> you'd<00:01:04.199> be<00:01:04.290> considering

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
two main factors you'd be considering

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.880 
two main factors you'd be considering
one<00:01:05.010> is<00:01:05.840> can<00:01:06.840> I<00:01:06.900> get<00:01:07.049> called<00:01:07.290> by<00:01:07.409> a<00:01:07.439> horse<00:01:07.680> and

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
one is can I get called by a horse and

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.080 
one is can I get called by a horse and
or<00:01:07.979> is<00:01:08.040> it<00:01:08.159> likely<00:01:08.310> that<00:01:08.430> I'll<00:01:08.610> get<00:01:08.700> called<00:01:08.939> by

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
or is it likely that I'll get called by

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.240 
or is it likely that I'll get called by
a<00:01:09.119> worse<00:01:09.330> hand<00:01:09.570> and<00:01:09.720> then<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:09.900> second<00:01:10.229> is<00:01:10.380> I

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
a worse hand and then the second is I

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.590 
a worse hand and then the second is I
think<00:01:11.490> this<00:01:11.610> is<00:01:11.670> especially<00:01:12.030> important<00:01:12.540> as

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
think this is especially important as

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.539 
think this is especially important as
your<00:01:12.810> level<00:01:13.049> of<00:01:13.110> competition<00:01:13.439> gets<00:01:13.770> higher<00:01:13.979> is

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
your level of competition gets higher is

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.249 
your level of competition gets higher is
that<00:01:14.700> are<00:01:14.850> there<00:01:15.030> are<00:01:15.390> there<00:01:15.630> Bluffs<00:01:15.930> that<00:01:16.049> I'm

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
that are there are there Bluffs that I'm

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.230 
that are there are there Bluffs that I'm
essentially<00:01:16.920> representing<00:01:17.430> like<00:01:17.549> can<00:01:17.820> my

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
essentially representing like can my

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.320 
essentially representing like can my
opponent<00:01:18.630> put<00:01:18.810> me<00:01:18.960> on<00:01:19.170> Bluffs<00:01:19.790> and<00:01:20.790> therefore

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
opponent put me on Bluffs and therefore

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.560 
opponent put me on Bluffs and therefore
of<00:01:21.600> call<00:01:21.869> I<00:01:22.350> think<00:01:23.250> against<00:01:23.549> less<00:01:24.090> experienced

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
of call I think against less experienced

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:25.910 
of call I think against less experienced
players<00:01:24.630> it's<00:01:25.110> less<00:01:25.380> relevant<00:01:25.860> because

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
players it's less relevant because

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.230 
players it's less relevant because
they're<00:01:26.159> not<00:01:26.250> thinking<00:01:26.520> in<00:01:26.700> those<00:01:26.790> terms<00:01:26.850> as

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
they're not thinking in those terms as

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.700 
they're not thinking in those terms as
much<00:01:27.420> but<00:01:27.900> in<00:01:27.990> general<00:01:28.259> I<00:01:28.320> think<00:01:28.380> it's<00:01:28.500> always

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
much but in general I think it's always

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.679 
much but in general I think it's always
a<00:01:28.799> good<00:01:28.979> idea<00:01:29.040> to<00:01:29.310> consider<00:01:29.759> and<00:01:30.000> that's<00:01:30.540> also

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
a good idea to consider and that's also

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:31.910 
a good idea to consider and that's also
true<00:01:30.840> when<00:01:31.110> you're<00:01:31.200> bluffing<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.590> flipside

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
true when you're bluffing the flipside

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.170 
true when you're bluffing the flipside
is<00:01:32.070> true<00:01:32.280> so<00:01:32.490> when<00:01:32.579> you're<00:01:32.729> bluffing

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
is true so when you're bluffing

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.219 
is true so when you're bluffing
you<00:01:33.479> want<00:01:33.630> to<00:01:33.689> make<00:01:33.810> sure<00:01:33.840> there<00:01:34.049> are<00:01:34.140> a<00:01:34.170> number

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
you want to make sure there are a number

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
for his thoughts in the subject yeah I

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.959 
for his thoughts in the subject yeah I
mean<00:01:54.810> I<00:01:54.930> think<00:01:55.250> you<00:01:56.250> know<00:01:56.280> betting<00:01:56.729> for

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
mean I think you know betting for

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.749 
mean I think you know betting for
information<00:01:57.570> is<00:01:57.719> not<00:01:58.219> necessarily<00:01:59.219> the<00:01:59.549> worst

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
information is not necessarily the worst

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.469 
information is not necessarily the worst
idea<00:02:00.329> I<00:02:00.930> think<00:02:01.140> there<00:02:01.530> are<00:02:01.560> certain<00:02:01.950> players

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 
idea I think there are certain players

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:04.399 
idea I think there are certain players
especially<00:02:03.479> against<00:02:03.659> certain<00:02:03.810> opponents<00:02:04.320> who

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
especially against certain opponents who

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.340 
especially against certain opponents who
can<00:02:04.560> effectively<00:02:04.920> use<00:02:05.070> that<00:02:05.520> strategy<00:02:06.320> but<00:02:07.320> I

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
can effectively use that strategy but I

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.779 
can effectively use that strategy but I
think<00:02:07.619> if<00:02:07.740> that's<00:02:07.860> the<00:02:08.069> only<00:02:08.099> reason<00:02:08.459> you're

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
think if that's the only reason you're

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.249 
think if that's the only reason you're
betting<00:02:09.060> it's<00:02:09.179> probably<00:02:09.569> not<00:02:09.690> great<00:02:09.989> I<00:02:10.020> mean<00:02:10.110> I

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
betting it's probably not great I mean I

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.850 
betting it's probably not great I mean I
think<00:02:10.319> you<00:02:10.500> can<00:02:10.619> bet<00:02:10.860> for<00:02:11.489> information<00:02:12.000> all

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
think you can bet for information all

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.920 
think you can bet for information all
for<00:02:13.130> value<00:02:13.550> also<00:02:14.180> maybe<00:02:14.360> to<00:02:14.540> protect<00:02:14.810> your

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
for value also maybe to protect your

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:16.990 
for value also maybe to protect your
hand<00:02:15.140> I<00:02:15.890> think<00:02:16.250> sometimes<00:02:16.580> if<00:02:16.760> you<00:02:16.820> see

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
hand I think sometimes if you see

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.390 
hand I think sometimes if you see
players<00:02:17.210> make<00:02:17.510> huge<00:02:18.260> over<00:02:18.650> bets<00:02:18.830> because

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
players make huge over bets because

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.980 
players make huge over bets because
they're<00:02:19.730> afraid<00:02:20.060> of<00:02:20.180> getting<00:02:20.330> drawn<00:02:20.810> out<00:02:20.960> on

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
they're afraid of getting drawn out on

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.290 
they're afraid of getting drawn out on
that's<00:02:21.770> just<00:02:22.010> kind<00:02:22.190> of<00:02:22.250> like<00:02:22.460> an<00:02:22.670> emotional

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
that's just kind of like an emotional

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.630 
that's just kind of like an emotional
reason<00:02:23.510> and<00:02:24.110> you<00:02:24.890> should<00:02:25.070> probably<00:02:25.220> try<00:02:25.550> to

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
reason and you should probably try to

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.050 
reason and you should probably try to
stay<00:02:25.910> away<00:02:26.090> from<00:02:26.150> that<00:02:26.480> I<00:02:27.040> think<00:02:28.040> you<00:02:28.850> should

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
stay away from that I think you should

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.410 
stay away from that I think you should
you<00:02:29.180> know<00:02:29.270> fear<00:02:30.200> of<00:02:30.410> getting<00:02:30.560> unlucky<00:02:31.160> is<00:02:31.420> just

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
you know fear of getting unlucky is just

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:33.400 
you know fear of getting unlucky is just
kind<00:02:32.570> of<00:02:32.600> part<00:02:32.810> of<00:02:32.900> the<00:02:32.960> game<00:02:33.110> and<00:02:33.260> if<00:02:33.350> you

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
kind of part of the game and if you

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.830 
kind of part of the game and if you
can't<00:02:33.710> make<00:02:34.250> good<00:02:34.460> decisions<00:02:34.910> with<00:02:35.390> that<00:02:35.600> fear

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
can't make good decisions with that fear

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.690 
can't make good decisions with that fear
then<00:02:36.110> you<00:02:36.200> should<00:02:36.350> probably<00:02:36.530> play<00:02:37.130> lower<00:02:37.370> or

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
then you should probably play lower or

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:38.890 
then you should probably play lower or
not<00:02:37.940> play<00:02:38.150> or<00:02:38.270> something<00:02:38.480> it<00:02:38.570> just<00:02:38.690> gonna<00:02:38.810> be

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
not play or something it just gonna be

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.780 
not play or something it just gonna be
hard<00:02:39.080> to<00:02:39.170> play<00:02:39.260> well<00:02:39.590> if<00:02:39.860> you're<00:02:40.010> just<00:02:40.520> afraid

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
hard to play well if you're just afraid

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.580 
hard to play well if you're just afraid
of<00:02:40.940> getting<00:02:41.150> unlucky<00:02:41.690> and<00:02:41.780> lucky<00:02:41.990> just<00:02:42.110> you

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
of getting unlucky and lucky just you

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:43.780 
of getting unlucky and lucky just you
know<00:02:42.680> getting<00:02:43.130> lucky<00:02:43.400> is<00:02:43.460> part<00:02:43.580> of<00:02:43.610> the<00:02:43.700> game

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
know getting lucky is part of the game

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:44.980 
know getting lucky is part of the game
so<00:02:43.850> you<00:02:44.000> have<00:02:44.150> to<00:02:44.240> kind<00:02:44.420> of<00:02:44.450> deal<00:02:44.600> with<00:02:44.630> it
