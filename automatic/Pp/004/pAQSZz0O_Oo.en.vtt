out throughout the day from there they

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.009 
out throughout the day from there they
moved<00:00:25.830> into<00:00:26.250> their<00:00:26.640> rotations<00:00:27.269> of<00:00:27.510> the<00:00:27.750> twelve

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
moved into their rotations of the twelve

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.650 
moved into their rotations of the twelve
challenges<00:00:28.619> where<00:00:28.800> they<00:00:28.890> had<00:00:29.039> to<00:00:29.160> utilize

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:29.660 
challenges where they had to utilize

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.359 
challenges where they had to utilize
household<00:00:30.660> items<00:00:31.050> and<00:00:31.320> complete<00:00:32.189> these

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
household items and complete these

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.090 
household items and complete these
seemingly<00:00:33.149> simple<00:00:33.630> tasks<00:00:34.290> however<00:00:34.590> once<00:00:34.890> they

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
seemingly simple tasks however once they

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.280 
seemingly simple tasks however once they
got<00:00:35.219> started<00:00:35.610> they<00:00:36.270> did<00:00:36.450> see<00:00:36.660> that<00:00:36.690> it<00:00:36.960> called

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
got started they did see that it called

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.920 
got started they did see that it called
for<00:00:37.559> quite<00:00:38.070> a<00:00:38.100> bit<00:00:38.190> more<00:00:38.399> precision<00:00:39.270> and

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
for quite a bit more precision and

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.060 
for quite a bit more precision and
strategizing<00:00:40.410> that<00:00:40.710> they<00:00:40.829> might<00:00:40.980> have

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
strategizing that they might have

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.369 
strategizing that they might have
originally<00:00:41.550> thought<00:00:41.730> so<00:00:42.030> ultimately<00:00:42.750> the

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
originally thought so ultimately the

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.020 
originally thought so ultimately the
teams<00:00:43.590> were<00:00:43.739> super<00:00:44.190> successful<00:00:44.579> higher

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
teams were super successful higher

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.340 
teams were super successful higher
energy<00:00:45.390> level<00:00:45.690> and<00:00:45.870> they<00:00:45.960> had<00:00:46.110> a<00:00:46.140> really

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
energy level and they had a really

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.440 
energy level and they had a really
really<00:00:46.530> great<00:00:46.710> time<00:00:47.059> what<00:00:48.059> was<00:00:48.180> great<00:00:48.360> about

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
really great time what was great about

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.090 
really great time what was great about
this<00:00:48.660> event<00:00:48.960> is<00:00:49.079> that<00:00:49.110> it<00:00:49.350> almost<00:00:49.590> appeared<00:00:50.039> to

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
this event is that it almost appeared to

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.740 
this event is that it almost appeared to
be<00:00:50.219> kind<00:00:50.700> of<00:00:50.760> an<00:00:50.850> icebreaker<00:00:50.969> for<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.570> group

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
be kind of an icebreaker for the group

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.360 
be kind of an icebreaker for the group
in<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:51.989> sense<00:00:52.199> that<00:00:52.289> they<00:00:52.469> came<00:00:52.710> in<00:00:52.920> you<00:00:53.340> know
