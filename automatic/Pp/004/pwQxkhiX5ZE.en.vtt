00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
is a set of auto jigglers but you can

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.900 
is a set of auto jigglers but you can
see<00:00:27.960> how<00:00:28.769> easily<00:00:29.039> you<00:00:29.279> could<00:00:29.400> rig<00:00:29.880> up

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
see how easily you could rig up

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.330 
see how easily you could rig up
something<00:00:30.269> like<00:00:30.510> this<00:00:30.689> just<00:00:30.990> have<00:00:31.109> a<00:00:31.199> a<00:00:31.500> paring

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
something like this just have a a paring

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.790 
something like this just have a a paring
knife<00:00:32.369> or<00:00:32.910> a<00:00:33.149> hacksaw<00:00:34.020> blade<00:00:34.290> or<00:00:34.440> something

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
knife or a hacksaw blade or something

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.930 
knife or a hacksaw blade or something
but<00:00:35.700> here<00:00:36.239> we<00:00:36.329> have<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.510> key<00:00:36.690> for<00:00:36.719> it<00:00:37.850> turn<00:00:38.850> it

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
but here we have the key for it turn it

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.400 
but here we have the key for it turn it
on<00:00:40.250> so<00:00:41.450> there's<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:42.660> shape<00:00:42.870> of<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:43.079> key<00:00:43.230> right

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
on so there's the shape of the key right

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.420 
on so there's the shape of the key right
there<00:00:43.460> and<00:00:45.680> the<00:00:46.680> one<00:00:46.860> that<00:00:47.010> I<00:00:47.070> find<00:00:47.280> most

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
there and the one that I find most

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.630 
there and the one that I find most
useful<00:00:47.670> for<00:00:48.390> a<00:00:48.710> lot<00:00:49.710> of<00:00:49.829> things<00:00:50.010> is<00:00:50.250> this<00:00:50.460> one

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
useful for a lot of things is this one

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.520 
useful for a lot of things is this one
right<00:00:50.760> here<00:00:50.820> and<00:00:51.149> you<00:00:51.750> can<00:00:51.899> already<00:00:52.050> see<00:00:52.289> how

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
right here and you can already see how

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.490 
right here and you can already see how
similar<00:00:52.980> they<00:00:53.309> are<00:00:53.600> so<00:00:54.600> if<00:00:54.719> we<00:00:54.870> take<00:00:55.050> that<00:00:55.289> just

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
similar they are so if we take that just

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:03.709 
similar they are so if we take that just
this<00:00:55.710> one<00:00:56.510> and<00:00:58.070> pop<00:00:59.070> it<00:00:59.219> in<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.340> ignition<00:01:02.719> just

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
this one and pop it in the ignition just

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.929 
this one and pop it in the ignition just
pop<00:01:04.650> it<00:01:04.799> in<00:01:04.890> as<00:01:05.010> far<00:01:05.159> down<00:01:05.220> as<00:01:05.369> it'll<00:01:05.610> go<00:01:05.670> and

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
pop it in as far down as it'll go and

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:11.780 
pop it in as far down as it'll go and
just<00:01:06.689> twist<00:01:06.869> it<00:01:07.080> pull<00:01:09.380> it<00:01:10.380> all<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.590> way<00:01:10.680> out<00:01:10.790> no

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
just twist it pull it all the way out no

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.460 
just twist it pull it all the way out no
fancy<00:01:12.060> tricks<00:01:12.479> or<00:01:12.600> anything<00:01:12.830> just<00:01:13.830> pop<00:01:14.040> it<00:01:14.220> in

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 
fancy tricks or anything just pop it in

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:22.670 
fancy tricks or anything just pop it in
twist<00:01:16.470> it<00:01:17.330> and<00:01:18.330> try<00:01:18.570> another<00:01:18.750> one<00:01:21.560> just<00:01:22.560> the

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
twist it and try another one just the

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.990 
twist it and try another one just the
single<00:01:22.920> ball<00:01:23.630> pop<00:01:24.630> it<00:01:24.780> in<00:01:24.900> as<00:01:25.020> far<00:01:25.200> as<00:01:25.290> it'll<00:01:25.439> go

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 
single ball pop it in as far as it'll go

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.480 
single ball pop it in as far as it'll go
so<00:01:27.000> that<00:01:27.150> one's<00:01:27.299> not<00:01:27.360> going<00:01:27.570> to<00:01:27.630> twist<00:01:28.490> but

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
so that one's not going to twist but

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.390 
so that one's not going to twist but
maybe<00:01:29.670> if<00:01:29.820> we<00:01:29.880> jiggle<00:01:30.210> it<00:01:30.299> a<00:01:30.329> little<00:01:31.400> it

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
maybe if we jiggle it a little it

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:40.569 
maybe if we jiggle it a little it
doesn't<00:01:32.820> want<00:01:32.970> to<00:01:33.030> go<00:01:34.610> let's<00:01:35.610> try<00:01:36.619> this<00:01:37.619> one

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:40.579 

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:44.859 

now<00:01:41.579> it<00:01:41.729> doesn't<00:01:41.880> want<00:01:42.000> to<00:01:42.119> go<00:01:42.180> either<00:01:42.210> but

00:01:44.859 --> 00:01:44.869 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:46.969 

this<00:01:45.869> is<00:01:46.079> the<00:01:46.170> one<00:01:46.290> I<00:01:46.350> always<00:01:46.380> try<00:01:46.770> first

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
this is the one I always try first

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.260 
this is the one I always try first
because<00:01:47.250> I<00:01:47.310> seem<00:01:47.490> to<00:01:47.549> have<00:01:47.640> a<00:01:47.700> most<00:01:47.909> left<00:01:48.180> to

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
because I seem to have a most left to

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.090 
because I seem to have a most left to
fit<00:01:48.450> and<00:01:50.720> on<00:01:51.720> my<00:01:51.869> particular<00:01:52.350> bike<00:01:52.530> I<00:01:52.799> didn't

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
fit and on my particular bike I didn't

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.069 
fit and on my particular bike I didn't
even<00:01:53.220> have<00:01:53.399> to<00:01:53.549> jiggle<00:01:53.820> it<00:01:53.909> at<00:01:53.970> all<00:01:54.090> sometimes

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
even have to jiggle it at all sometimes

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.959 
even have to jiggle it at all sometimes
you<00:01:55.380> might<00:01:55.470> a<00:01:55.530> little<00:01:55.619> but<00:01:56.280> it<00:01:56.520> just<00:01:56.790> goes

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
you might a little but it just goes

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:00.770 
you might a little but it just goes
right<00:01:57.119> in<00:01:57.180> it<00:01:57.540> twists<00:01:58.340> so

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
right in it twists so

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.300 
right in it twists so
these<00:02:01.530> are<00:02:01.830> these<00:02:02.159> alter<00:02:02.430> locks<00:02:02.670> were<00:02:04.310> nothing

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
these are these alter locks were nothing

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.010 
these are these alter locks were nothing
too<00:02:05.850> fancy<00:02:06.030> or<00:02:06.270> high-tech<00:02:06.479> but<00:02:08.690> not<00:02:09.690> that<00:02:09.840> hard

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
too fancy or high-tech but not that hard

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.420 
too fancy or high-tech but not that hard
to<00:02:10.080> get<00:02:10.200> into<00:02:10.319> either<00:02:10.560> so<00:02:10.950> if<00:02:11.039> you<00:02:11.130> lose<00:02:11.280> your

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
to get into either so if you lose your

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.270 
to get into either so if you lose your
keys<00:02:11.610> on<00:02:11.790> a<00:02:11.819> bike<00:02:12.000> like<00:02:12.209> this<00:02:13.010> don't<00:02:14.010> have<00:02:14.160> too

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
keys on a bike like this don't have too

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.559 
keys on a bike like this don't have too
much<00:02:14.430> to<00:02:14.610> worry<00:02:14.730> about<00:02:14.850> you<00:02:15.150> can<00:02:15.180> ride<00:02:15.450> it

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
much to worry about you can ride it

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:16.850 
much to worry about you can ride it
around<00:02:15.690> until<00:02:16.080> you<00:02:16.170> get<00:02:16.230> another<00:02:16.410> key<00:02:16.650> made

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
around until you get another key made

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.780 
around until you get another key made
you're<00:02:17.760> not<00:02:17.910> stuck<00:02:18.180> at<00:02:18.300> home<00:02:18.330> or<00:02:18.600> anything
