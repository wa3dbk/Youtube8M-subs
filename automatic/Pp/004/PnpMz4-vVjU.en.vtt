00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:25.630 
and get rid of it because it's just

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:34.850 
grow in there and i'll pick that first

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:36.520 
grow in there and i'll pick that first
one<00:00:35.060> there<00:00:35.239> in<00:00:35.360> the<00:00:35.450> front<00:00:35.600> tonight<00:00:36.110> and<00:00:36.380> we'll

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:36.530 
one there in the front tonight and we'll

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.010 
one there in the front tonight and we'll
eat<00:00:36.680> that<00:00:36.950> and<00:00:37.310> then<00:00:37.940> maybe<00:00:38.420> a<00:00:38.510> day<00:00:38.720> or<00:00:38.750> two

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:39.020 
eat that and then maybe a day or two

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:40.630 
eat that and then maybe a day or two
later<00:00:39.170> I'll<00:00:39.440> pick<00:00:39.620> the<00:00:39.770> one<00:00:39.920> in<00:00:40.040> the<00:00:40.130> back<00:00:40.309> and

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:40.640 
later I'll pick the one in the back and

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.660 
later I'll pick the one in the back and
then<00:00:40.809> see<00:00:41.809> what<00:00:41.930> I<00:00:41.989> got<00:00:42.230> left<00:00:42.440> in<00:00:42.739> there<00:00:42.950> and<00:00:43.190> I

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670 
then see what I got left in there and I

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.200 
then see what I got left in there and I
think<00:00:43.880> this<00:00:44.090> bin<00:00:44.660> is<00:00:44.989> ending<00:00:45.469> its<00:00:46.210> reaching

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.210 
think this bin is ending its reaching

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.770 
think this bin is ending its reaching
its<00:00:47.570> end<00:00:47.980> so<00:00:48.980> i'll<00:00:49.309> plan<00:00:49.640> to<00:00:50.030> start<00:00:50.480> some<00:00:50.750> new

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:50.780 
its end so i'll plan to start some new

getting<00:02:05.689> cool<00:02:05.899> at<00:02:06.109> night<00:02:06.140> last<00:02:06.560> night<00:02:06.680> we

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
getting cool at night last night we

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.760 
getting cool at night last night we
dropped<00:02:07.219> around<00:02:07.369> the<00:02:07.579> 46<00:02:08.229> which<00:02:09.229> isn't<00:02:09.590> good

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:09.770 
dropped around the 46 which isn't good

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.850 
dropped around the 46 which isn't good
for<00:02:10.009> the<00:02:10.100> warm<00:02:10.369> weather<00:02:10.550> things<00:02:10.970> but<00:02:11.620> the<00:02:12.620> warm

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
for the warm weather things but the warm

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.860 
for the warm weather things but the warm
weather<00:02:13.070> in<00:02:13.250> the<00:02:13.370> sunshine<00:02:13.790> we<00:02:13.940> have<00:02:14.090> had<00:02:14.450> has

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
weather in the sunshine we have had has

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.620 
weather in the sunshine we have had has
caused<00:02:15.230> the<00:02:16.100> peppers<00:02:16.550> and<00:02:16.580> especially<00:02:17.330> the

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
caused the peppers and especially the

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.290 
caused the peppers and especially the
tomatoes<00:02:18.140> to<00:02:18.620> bounce<00:02:18.980> back<00:02:19.310> considerably

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
tomatoes to bounce back considerably

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.930 
tomatoes to bounce back considerably
from<00:02:20.630> what<00:02:21.140> they<00:02:21.290> were<00:02:21.400> last<00:02:22.400> time<00:02:22.610> I<00:02:22.760> showed

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
from what they were last time I showed

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.920 
from what they were last time I showed
them<00:02:23.060> to<00:02:23.120> you<00:02:23.300> and<00:02:23.650> all<00:02:24.650> the<00:02:24.920> tomatoes<00:02:25.460> are

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
them to you and all the tomatoes are

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.550 
them to you and all the tomatoes are
looking<00:02:26.930> pretty<00:02:27.080> good

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
looking pretty good

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.890 
looking pretty good
right<00:02:27.650> now<00:02:27.849> they<00:02:28.849> still<00:02:29.120> have<00:02:29.239> some<00:02:29.420> going<00:02:29.720> to

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
right now they still have some going to

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.580 
right now they still have some going to
do<00:02:30.260> and<00:02:30.849> I'm<00:02:31.849> thinking<00:02:32.510> I<00:02:32.720> might<00:02:33.080> still<00:02:33.410> get

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
do and I'm thinking I might still get

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.010 
do and I'm thinking I might still get
some<00:02:33.890> fruit<00:02:34.190> off<00:02:34.430> of<00:02:34.459> them<00:02:34.849> because<00:02:35.390> I<00:02:35.420> planted

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
some fruit off of them because I planted

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.580 
some fruit off of them because I planted
all<00:02:36.230> the<00:02:36.770> earliest<00:02:37.780> bearing<00:02:38.780> crops<00:02:39.140> i<00:02:39.380> could

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
all the earliest bearing crops i could

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.400 
all the earliest bearing crops i could
find<00:02:39.890> they<00:02:40.280> range<00:02:40.790> from<00:02:40.940> about<00:02:41.270> 50<00:02:41.840> days<00:02:42.080> I

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
find they range from about 50 days I

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.150 
find they range from about 50 days I
think<00:02:42.950> the<00:02:43.069> highest<00:02:43.400> one<00:02:43.610> is<00:02:43.790> only<00:02:44.209> 60<00:02:44.870> so<00:02:45.160> I'm

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
think the highest one is only 60 so I'm

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.720 
think the highest one is only 60 so I'm
still<00:02:46.730> hopeful<00:02:47.090> and<00:02:47.410> it's<00:02:48.519> gratifying<00:02:49.519> to<00:02:49.640> see

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
still hopeful and it's gratifying to see

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:54.479 
still hopeful and it's gratifying to see
that<00:02:49.959> the<00:02:50.959> lettuce<00:02:51.319> is<00:02:51.530> drawed<00:02:52.160> nicely<00:02:53.050> and

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:54.489 
that the lettuce is drawed nicely and

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:56.770 
that the lettuce is drawed nicely and
haven't<00:02:55.489> picked<00:02:55.610> any<00:02:55.819> yet<00:02:56.060> it's<00:02:56.300> a<00:02:56.480> little

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
haven't picked any yet it's a little

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.500 
haven't picked any yet it's a little
young<00:02:56.989> yet<00:02:57.290> but<00:02:57.560> it<00:02:57.800> won't<00:02:58.040> be<00:02:58.160> long<00:02:58.340> and<00:02:58.700> then

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
young yet but it won't be long and then

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.059 
young yet but it won't be long and then
the<00:02:59.630> carrots<00:03:00.019> are<00:03:00.230> doing<00:03:00.560> well<00:03:00.799> I've<00:03:01.040> been

00:03:01.059 --> 00:03:01.069 
the carrots are doing well I've been

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:04.180 
the carrots are doing well I've been
gradually<00:03:02.060> thinning<00:03:02.480> them<00:03:02.660> out<00:03:02.870> I<00:03:03.190> just

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
gradually thinning them out I just

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.009 
gradually thinning them out I just
scattered<00:03:04.640> the<00:03:04.790> seed<00:03:05.030> in<00:03:05.239> there<00:03:05.480> and<00:03:05.720> I'm

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:06.019 
scattered the seed in there and I'm

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:08.530 
scattered the seed in there and I'm
going<00:03:06.290> to<00:03:06.350> be<00:03:06.620> thinning<00:03:07.610> them<00:03:07.850> down<00:03:08.060> an<00:03:08.239> event

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
going to be thinning them down an event

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.840 
going to be thinning them down an event
thing<00:03:08.780> to<00:03:08.959> try<00:03:09.140> to<00:03:09.200> give<00:03:09.890> about<00:03:10.220> two<00:03:10.489> inches

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850 
thing to try to give about two inches

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:12.759 
thing to try to give about two inches
between<00:03:11.090> carrots<00:03:11.900> I<00:03:12.110> think<00:03:12.349> that<00:03:12.530> should<00:03:12.709> be

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:12.769 
between carrots I think that should be

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:15.820 
between carrots I think that should be
adequate<00:03:13.299> but<00:03:14.299> we'll<00:03:14.540> see<00:03:14.780> in<00:03:15.349> the<00:03:15.590> back

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:15.830 
adequate but we'll see in the back

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:18.220 
adequate but we'll see in the back
behind<00:03:16.099> them<00:03:16.580> I<00:03:16.790> had<00:03:17.180> the<00:03:17.360> basil<00:03:17.780> plants<00:03:18.110> I

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
behind them I had the basil plants I

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.430 
behind them I had the basil plants I
lost<00:03:18.500> one<00:03:18.860> of<00:03:18.890> the<00:03:19.130> Basil's<00:03:19.640> and<00:03:19.910> so<00:03:20.780> I<00:03:20.810> put<00:03:21.170> in

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
lost one of the Basil's and so I put in

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.240 
lost one of the Basil's and so I put in
some<00:03:21.890> kale<00:03:22.220> in<00:03:22.580> its<00:03:22.849> spot<00:03:23.209> and<00:03:23.680> I<00:03:24.680> know<00:03:24.830> the

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
some kale in its spot and I know the

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.610 
some kale in its spot and I know the
kale<00:03:25.459> is<00:03:25.700> going<00:03:25.940> to<00:03:26.030> outgrow<00:03:26.209> that<00:03:26.540> area<00:03:27.319> but

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
kale is going to outgrow that area but

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.599 
kale is going to outgrow that area but
I'm<00:03:28.489> thinking<00:03:29.290> maybe<00:03:30.290> the<00:03:30.709> basil<00:03:31.370> will<00:03:31.489> be

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:31.609 
I'm thinking maybe the basil will be

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:33.460 
I'm thinking maybe the basil will be
finished<00:03:32.030> by<00:03:32.239> then<00:03:32.450> and<00:03:32.510> it<00:03:32.840> can<00:03:33.019> just<00:03:33.170> spill

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
finished by then and it can just spill

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.530 
finished by then and it can just spill
over<00:03:33.769> into<00:03:33.799> that<00:03:34.250> area<00:03:34.519> but<00:03:34.850> we'll<00:03:35.209> see<00:03:35.390> how<00:03:35.420> it

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540 
over into that area but we'll see how it

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.110 
over into that area but we'll see how it
goes<00:03:35.660> the<00:03:36.500> beets<00:03:36.709> are<00:03:36.920> doing<00:03:37.160> well<00:03:37.400> the<00:03:37.790> ones

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
goes the beets are doing well the ones

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.599 
goes the beets are doing well the ones
in<00:03:38.299> the<00:03:38.329> front<00:03:38.570> here<00:03:38.870> are<00:03:39.170> the<00:03:39.470> golden<00:03:40.400> beets

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:40.609 
in the front here are the golden beets

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:42.670 
in the front here are the golden beets
and<00:03:40.880> I<00:03:41.239> didn't<00:03:41.630> have<00:03:41.780> very<00:03:41.810> good<00:03:42.170> luck<00:03:42.500> with

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
and I didn't have very good luck with

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.470 
and I didn't have very good luck with
them<00:03:42.829> last<00:03:43.010> year<00:03:43.250> but<00:03:43.549> this<00:03:43.730> year<00:03:43.790> so<00:03:44.180> farther

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 
them last year but this year so farther

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.780 
them last year but this year so farther
they<00:03:44.930> seem<00:03:45.140> to<00:03:45.230> be<00:03:45.319> doing<00:03:45.440> quite<00:03:45.739> nicely<00:03:45.799> and

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
they seem to be doing quite nicely and

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.690 
they seem to be doing quite nicely and
the<00:03:47.390> Bulls<00:03:47.600> blood<00:03:47.989> in<00:03:48.260> the<00:03:48.680> back<00:03:48.890> are<00:03:49.310> doing

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:49.700 
the Bulls blood in the back are doing

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:54.370 
the Bulls blood in the back are doing
well<00:03:50.200> over<00:03:51.200> here<00:03:51.380> the<00:03:51.739> Ruby<00:03:52.280> Queen<00:03:52.810> are<00:03:53.810> doing

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:54.380 
well over here the Ruby Queen are doing

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:56.680 
well over here the Ruby Queen are doing
pretty<00:03:54.859> good<00:03:55.069> to<00:03:55.310> some<00:03:55.609> of<00:03:55.700> them<00:03:55.819> are<00:03:55.970> growing

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:56.690 
pretty good to some of them are growing

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:59.379 
pretty good to some of them are growing
a<00:03:56.959> lot<00:03:57.650> bigger<00:03:57.920> than<00:03:58.100> others<00:03:58.400> I<00:03:58.549> can't<00:03:59.000> quite

00:03:59.379 --> 00:03:59.389 
a lot bigger than others I can't quite

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:02.740 
a lot bigger than others I can't quite
figure<00:03:59.630> that<00:03:59.930> out<00:04:01.420> carrot<00:04:02.420> thought<00:04:02.600> the

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:02.750 
figure that out carrot thought the

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:05.020 
figure that out carrot thought the
carrots<00:04:03.109> the<00:04:03.230> onions<00:04:03.829> are<00:04:04.069> doing<00:04:04.400> remarkably

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030 
carrots the onions are doing remarkably

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:46.390 
the cherry belle radishes in fact I'm

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:49.260 
the cherry belle radishes in fact I'm
going<00:04:46.450> to<00:04:46.860> probably<00:04:47.860> pick<00:04:48.220> the<00:04:48.730> rest<00:04:48.940> of<00:04:49.150> them

and I've been getting them they're all

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.090

about<00:04:52.270> the<00:04:52.330> same<00:04:52.510> size<00:04:52.990> pretty<00:04:53.650> good-sized

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:54.100 
about the same size pretty good-sized

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:57.090 
about the same size pretty good-sized
radishes<00:04:54.730> and<00:04:55.380> I<00:04:56.380> think<00:04:56.560> I'll<00:04:56.650> just<00:04:56.770> pick<00:04:56.950> the

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:57.100

radishes and I think I'll just pick the
rest<00:04:57.250> of<00:04:57.400> these<00:04:57.520> here<00:04:57.820> and<00:04:58.800> call<00:04:59.800> it<00:04:59.920> a<00:05:00.010> day<00:05:00.040> on

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:02.920 
those and I'll be enough i'm getting

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:06.330

mushrooms<00:05:03.400> growing<00:05:03.820> in<00:05:03.940> here<00:05:04.180> too<00:05:05.340> there's

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:06.340 
mushrooms growing in here too there's

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:10.140 
mushrooms growing in here too there's
one<00:05:06.700> there<00:05:07.030> and<00:05:07.510> there's<00:05:07.690> one<00:05:07.960> there<00:05:08.700> and<00:05:09.700> i

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.150 
one there and there's one there and i

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:13.740 
one there and there's one there and i
believe<00:05:10.510> they<00:05:10.870> are<00:05:10.900> coming<00:05:11.530> from<00:05:12.450> the<00:05:13.450> source

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:13.750 
believe they are coming from the source

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:16.080 
believe they are coming from the source
of<00:05:13.960> the<00:05:14.350> sum<00:05:14.740> of<00:05:14.830> the<00:05:14.890> compost<00:05:15.370> in<00:05:15.610> there<00:05:15.850> it<00:05:16.000> is

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:16.090 
of the sum of the compost in there it is

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:20.040 
of the sum of the compost in there it is
mushroom<00:05:16.990> compost<00:05:17.260> and<00:05:17.940> they<00:05:18.940> think<00:05:19.750> that's

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:20.050 
mushroom compost and they think that's

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:22.170 
mushroom compost and they think that's
where<00:05:20.320> the<00:05:20.380> mushrooms<00:05:21.040> are<00:05:21.130> coming<00:05:21.490> from<00:05:21.640> so<00:05:21.970> i

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:22.180 
where the mushrooms are coming from so i

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:25.080 
where the mushrooms are coming from so i
may<00:05:22.630> not<00:05:22.840> use<00:05:23.020> that<00:05:23.290> again<00:05:23.940> shallots<00:05:24.940> are

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:25.090 
may not use that again shallots are

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:27.210 
may not use that again shallots are
doing<00:05:25.360> good<00:05:25.540> i<00:05:25.570> don't<00:05:25.720> quite<00:05:26.050> know<00:05:26.190> when<00:05:27.190> a

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:27.220 
doing good i don't quite know when a

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:29.310 
doing good i don't quite know when a
shallot<00:05:27.760> is<00:05:27.880> ready<00:05:28.330> to<00:05:28.510> pick<00:05:28.690> off<00:05:28.990> the

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:29.320
