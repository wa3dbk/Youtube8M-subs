 This clip is recommended. A little bit of Chinese money. 

00:00:07.563 --> 00:00:11.755

 Macau, he uses another currency. 

00:00:21.911 --> 00:00:26.383
 But if coming to China Will have to use the yuan 

00:00:26.383 --> 00:00:29.664
 Yuan is the biggest. It's a hundred yuan. 

00:00:29.664 --> 00:00:32.349
 It is worth about five hundred baht. 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:34.659
 When pressing money at the ATM 

00:00:34.659 --> 00:00:36.545

 Twenty yuan bank look To know each other differently 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.132
 Before traveling 

00:01:23.132 --> 00:01:24.791
 Then this is the lowest bank 

00:01:24.791 --> 00:01:28.944
