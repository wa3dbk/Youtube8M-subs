00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:56.410 
time was no longer my own and I got a

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:57.840 
time was no longer my own and I got a
choice<00:00:56.620> you<00:00:56.980> know<00:00:57.070> I<00:00:57.100> had<00:00:57.220> a<00:00:57.250> few<00:00:57.430> moments<00:00:57.580> to

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:57.850 
choice you know I had a few moments to

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:58.830 
choice you know I had a few moments to
be<00:00:57.970> honest<00:00:58.150> with<00:00:58.270> you<00:00:58.390> I<00:00:58.420> thought<00:00:58.600> how<00:00:58.720> am<00:00:58.750> I

00:00:58.830 --> 00:00:58.840 
be honest with you I thought how am I

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.480 
be honest with you I thought how am I
going<00:00:58.960> to<00:00:59.020> keep<00:00:59.230> up<00:00:59.440> and<00:00:59.980> then<00:01:00.070> I<00:01:00.100> realize

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:00.490 
going to keep up and then I realize

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:01.620 
going to keep up and then I realize
they've<00:01:00.670> got<00:01:00.790> to<00:01:00.880> ask<00:01:01.000> myself<00:01:01.210> a<00:01:01.480> better

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:01.630 
they've got to ask myself a better

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:03.870 
they've got to ask myself a better
question<00:01:02.320> the<00:01:02.710> question<00:01:02.890> I<00:01:03.130> asked<00:01:03.370> myself<00:01:03.400> was

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:03.880 
question the question I asked myself was

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:08.130 
question the question I asked myself was
how<00:01:04.180> do<00:01:04.659> I<00:01:04.720> get<00:01:04.869> more<00:01:05.650> done<00:01:06.390> so<00:01:07.390> I<00:01:07.659> started

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:08.140 
how do I get more done so I started

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:09.389 
how do I get more done so I started
looking<00:01:08.229> at<00:01:08.560> all<00:01:08.649> the<00:01:08.799> very<00:01:08.979> best<00:01:09.009> time

00:01:09.389 --> 00:01:09.399 
looking at all the very best time

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:11.190 
looking at all the very best time
management<00:01:09.850> systems<00:01:10.240> i<00:01:10.420> could<00:01:10.600> find<00:01:10.810> all<00:01:11.109> the

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
management systems i could find all the

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.169 
management systems i could find all the
leading<00:01:11.439> thinkers<00:01:12.100> authors<00:01:12.640> writers<00:01:13.030> and

00:01:13.169 --> 00:01:13.179 
leading thinkers authors writers and

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:15.179 
leading thinkers authors writers and
speakers<00:01:13.570> in<00:01:13.719> this<00:01:13.840> field<00:01:14.109> initially<00:01:15.039> it<00:01:15.070> was

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:15.189 
speakers in this field initially it was

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:16.499 
speakers in this field initially it was
quite<00:01:15.369> overwhelming<00:01:15.850> because<00:01:15.999> there<00:01:16.329> seemed

00:01:16.499 --> 00:01:16.509 
quite overwhelming because there seemed

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:17.969 
quite overwhelming because there seemed
to<00:01:16.539> be<00:01:16.659> contradictory<00:01:17.320> different<00:01:17.649> approaches

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:17.979 
to be contradictory different approaches

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:20.669 
to be contradictory different approaches
and<00:01:18.670> so<00:01:19.119> many<00:01:19.270> different<00:01:19.659> time<00:01:20.140> management

00:01:20.669 --> 00:01:20.679 
and so many different time management

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:22.529 
and so many different time management
systems<00:01:21.069> it<00:01:21.219> was<00:01:21.340> pull<00:01:21.579> overwhelming<00:01:22.359> in<00:01:22.450> its

00:01:22.529 --> 00:01:22.539 
systems it was pull overwhelming in its

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:24.539 
systems it was pull overwhelming in its
own<00:01:22.749> right<00:01:22.929> but<00:01:23.619> then<00:01:23.770> I<00:01:23.799> started<00:01:24.130> to<00:01:24.189> notice<00:01:24.249> a

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:24.549 
own right but then I started to notice a

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:26.609 
own right but then I started to notice a
pattern<00:01:24.729> then<00:01:25.479> I<00:01:25.509> started<00:01:25.929> to<00:01:25.990> notice<00:01:26.259> there

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:26.619 
pattern then I started to notice there

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:28.349 
pattern then I started to notice there
was<00:01:26.710> some<00:01:26.979> things<00:01:27.310> in<00:01:27.520> common<00:01:27.549> across<00:01:28.090> these

00:01:28.349 --> 00:01:28.359 
was some things in common across these

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:31.260 
was some things in common across these
systems<00:01:28.869> and<00:01:29.170> I've<00:01:29.649> distilled<00:01:30.039> that<00:01:30.399> into<00:01:31.210> a

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 
systems and I've distilled that into a

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.260 
systems and I've distilled that into a
simple<00:01:31.479> four<00:01:32.020> step<00:01:32.049> process<00:01:32.909> that<00:01:33.909> i<00:01:33.939> call<00:01:34.240> my

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270 
simple four step process that i call my

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.830 
simple four step process that i call my
c4<00:01:34.990> process<00:01:35.619> it's<00:01:36.549> four<00:01:36.969> steps<00:01:37.359> that<00:01:37.569> I<00:01:37.630> want

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:37.840
