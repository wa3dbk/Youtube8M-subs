00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.559
 be engaged in the reviews of technology so far 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:17.760

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:19.680

 empty jars for cosmetics too 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:49.739
 of course you can try some 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:51.960
 take off on the channel and there are already 400 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:55.879
 subscribers and everything you need for 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:59.820

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:06.920
 also do not have to earn some money by the operator 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.920
 he is our business 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:17.469
 and today I have the best girlfriend in my hands 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.469
 video blogger canon legria mini 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.520
 ps 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:32.880
 the size of the camera jester type as a pack 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:35.310
 cigarettes only slightly wider and weighing 159 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.710
 grams of glossy plastic a lot but 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.630
 say he is annoying so there is no camera 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.900
 we do not know white 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:45.270
 I better take off a pack of cigarettes 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:49.160
 would prefer a smartphone well yes you can and 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.160
 smartphone un kind of like this 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:01.160
 and despite the apparent 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.260
 the primitiveness of this here legs it is not 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.870
 only allows you to set the camera under 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:08.210
 tilt but also fix it on every 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:10.070
 starts clothespins and ending with scotch 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:12.050
 quite good free 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:14.840
 alternative mount in the same go about 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:17.720
 the screen is here with a diagonal of 27 inches 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.820
 enough to shoot 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.860
 yourself at arm's length either 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.490
 view field entry results 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.950
 conditions 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:26.870
 there are no other control buttons and 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.920
 it's not very convenient all the time 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.380
 poke at the screen 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.480
 and this is not always convenient considering that 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.940
 still camera action by the way were 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.010
 waterproof and shockproof case in 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:40.070
 The kit is not originally included, but 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:42.410
 lens with a viewing angle of 160 degrees and 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:44.390
 aperture 2 and 8 there we are not worth 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.560
 fear that all your videos will be in 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.050
 fisheye format 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.989
 thanks to 13 mega pixel bmw 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:53.270
 back light arrays and 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:55.459
 digic 4 processor camera practically 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:58.280
 without loss of quality can shoot in a cope 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:00.950
 71 degree viewing mode for full 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:03.170
 edit but need only 2 megapixels in total 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.510
 useful implemented much better than 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:08.239
 most autofocus smartphones by the way 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:10.280
 no everything from 10 centimeters and beyond 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:12.260
 there will be a very high quality video 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.450
 good more than youtube 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.220
 good detail wide 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:18.049
 dynamic range and small 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:21.500
 amount of noise even in the evening 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:23.480
 quality is better than 99 percent of smartphones 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:26.390
 practically not inferior to that in 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.400
 goopro and how is optical enough for me 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:30.830
 stabilizer because of what the video on the go 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:33.019
 enough shaking and 13 megapixel 

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:35.209
 pictures for the camera by the way are very cool 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:37.580
 sound is written in stereo and in this 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:40.070
 plan hive grammy not everything ok microphone and 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:42.709
 not bad wind noise flowing sound is written 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:44.870
 without reloading even at concerts good 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:47.209
 stereo and detail but there are 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:50.090
 one but there is no input for external 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:53.239
 microphone format their minds cinema guides 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:54.370
 25 frames per second or 720p with 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:56.590
 doubled and 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.239
 VJ with teaches boiled frame rate 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.980
 all this is played on normal 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:02.680
 speed besides there is a mode 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:05.049
 deceleration of 2 or 4 times 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:07.060
 and you can still shoot timelaps when 

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:09.459
 the camera makes short videos through 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.829
 certain intervals of 5 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:13.750
 seconds to ten minutes and then sticks together 

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:15.879
 them in one video by the way know where u 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.829
 device up is not necessarily how would you 

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:20.019
 it did not turn the sensor under costs 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:20.859
 image as it should card clinic 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:22.750
 micro sd 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:24.669
 and there is wi-fi with which you can 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:27.400
 control it run the process 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:28.870
 Recording on a smartphone or tablet, and even 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:31.449
 stream video to mobile device 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:33.789
 truth arrange online broadcast not 

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:35.250
 It turns out because the wifi access point in 

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:37.600
 case of connection with mobile device 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:40.060
 advocates camera work time 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.860
 Most action cameras are usually not very 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:44.350
 the name was no exception 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:46.090
 depending on the format chosen and 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:50.050
 use of the display can be calculated 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:52.539
 for 60 80 minutes however for issues 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:54.639
 Vloga is quite enough in the camera menu 

00:04:52.539 --> 00:04:57.039
 traditional for photo and video cameras canon 

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:59.410
 convenient and visual we certainly are not 

00:04:57.039 --> 00:05:01.840
 convenient as a goal for the simplest 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:04.210
 settings on the report 20 times and listen 

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:06.700
 19 peaks on it was sarcasm if that 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:08.710
 there are no manual modes but there is a large 

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:11.500
 the number of scene modes among 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:13.930
 which foods fashion touring 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:15.789
 I hope your photos will be better than those 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:17.770
 that almost jessica alba in instagram 

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:20.500
 soar what a terrible instagram is 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:22.510
 built-in asterisks fixed hearts 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:25.930
 if such other things that often and thickly 

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:28.240
 used by many famous bloggers in 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:29.710
 Generally if you decide to try your 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:31.870
 forces in the vloging 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:32.830
 and do not get carried away extreme 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:35.500
 sports 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:37.120
 canon legria mini is probably optimal 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:39.660
 pocket size option 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:41.770
 great photo and video quality 

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:43.780
 wide-angle lens and just such 

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:46.720
 cool and tilt display solution 

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:48.820
 and a stand with oh if I shot 

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:52.979

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:54.120
 the camera to Sasha left without work

 the basket is great here 

00:06:23.259 --> 00:06:27.819
 hooks attached to the wheel that you 

00:06:26.199 --> 00:06:29.460
 invest for someone animal 

00:06:27.819 --> 00:06:33.430
 you want to ride with you 

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:36.870
 the animal is very afraid and trembles in my 

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:36.870
 case this is such an animal 

00:06:37.259 --> 00:06:41.639
 Today we rode very much 

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:50.860
 and the second thing i have is galaxy s5 

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:53.169
 who else in my opinion has become very much 

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:54.580
 cool and I want how I liked 

00:06:53.169 --> 00:06:57.360

 black and white and right on the main screen 

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:05.620
 large calculator true without logarithm 

00:07:01.599 --> 00:07:07.860
 it did not like it and sasha also 

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:12.940
 button it 

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:14.800

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:16.719
 take off on it a review you write in 

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:21.129
 comments do you want an overview from 

00:07:16.719 --> 00:07:23.250
 samples and now the main question Sasha how 

00:07:21.129 --> 00:07:23.250
 you
