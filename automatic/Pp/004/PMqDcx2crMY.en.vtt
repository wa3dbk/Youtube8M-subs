lexan I mean I know they're doing a ton
of<00:01:57.300> detail<00:01:57.720> around<00:01:57.870> this<00:01:58.080> thing<00:01:58.350> super<00:01:59.420> deep

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
of detail around this thing super deep

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.650 
of detail around this thing super deep
stretches<00:02:00.990> and<00:02:01.110> stuff<00:02:01.350> in<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:02.130> lexan<00:02:02.550> but<00:02:02.790> so

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:03.660 
stretches and stuff in the lexan but so

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:06.890 
stretches and stuff in the lexan but so
in<00:02:04.050> and<00:02:04.470> then<00:02:05.330> smallest<00:02:06.330> little<00:02:06.480> hit<00:02:06.750> is<00:02:06.870> going

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:06.900 
in and then smallest little hit is going

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:08.980 
in and then smallest little hit is going
to<00:02:07.080> crack<00:02:07.320> this<00:02:07.500> thing<00:02:07.560> on<00:02:07.830> the<00:02:07.920> front<00:02:08.160> so<00:02:08.520> a

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:08.990 
to crack this thing on the front so a

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.030 
to crack this thing on the front so a
little<00:02:09.990> bit<00:02:10.170> of<00:02:10.200> material<00:02:10.440> on<00:02:10.649> there<00:02:10.800> to<00:02:10.890> kind

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:11.040 
little bit of material on there to kind

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.190 
little bit of material on there to kind
of<00:02:11.100> boelter<00:02:11.460> that<00:02:11.640> so<00:02:11.970> it<00:02:12.690> can<00:02:12.840> hopefully<00:02:13.020> take

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
of boelter that so it can hopefully take

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.080 
of boelter that so it can hopefully take
a<00:02:13.380> little<00:02:13.500> bit<00:02:13.650> more<00:02:13.800> punishment<00:02:16.820> just<00:02:17.820> kind

brush<00:02:35.880> motor<00:02:36.090> in<00:02:36.300> this<00:02:36.390> drift<00:02:36.660> car<00:02:36.870> should

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
brush motor in this drift car should

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.920 
brush motor in this drift car should
work<00:02:37.290> perfect<00:02:37.740> for<00:02:37.770> that<00:02:38.570> ran<00:02:39.570> us<00:02:39.600> in<00:02:39.840> a

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
work perfect for that ran us in a

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.540 
work perfect for that ran us in a
crawler<00:02:40.200> and<00:02:40.380> it<00:02:40.500> was<00:02:40.590> totally<00:02:41.130> fine<00:02:41.340> on

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
crawler and it was totally fine on

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:42.980 
crawler and it was totally fine on
brushed<00:02:41.850> motors<00:02:42.209> it<00:02:42.390> just<00:02:42.570> will<00:02:42.690> not<00:02:42.810> do

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990 
brushed motors it just will not do

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:46.520 
brushed motors it just will not do
brushless<00:02:43.290> so<00:02:43.740> I<00:02:44.150> put<00:02:45.150> that<00:02:45.180> in<00:02:45.480> there<00:02:45.690> I'm

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
brushless so I put that in there I'm

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.570 
brushless so I put that in there I'm
going<00:02:46.650> to<00:02:46.740> do<00:02:46.830> a<00:02:46.860> 27<00:02:47.459> turn<00:02:47.670> brushed<00:02:47.970> motor

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
going to do a 27 turn brushed motor

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:56.470 
going to do a 27 turn brushed motor
power<00:02:50.580> and<00:02:51.030> then<00:02:53.360> else<00:02:54.360> is<00:02:54.540> I<00:02:54.630> going<00:02:54.780> to<00:02:54.840> say<00:02:55.019> I

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
power and then else is I going to say I

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.040 
power and then else is I going to say I
can't<00:02:57.480> remember<00:02:57.780> anyway<00:02:59.630> that's<00:03:00.630> the<00:03:00.720> update

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
can't remember anyway that's the update

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:04.430 
can't remember anyway that's the update
on<00:03:01.200> the<00:03:01.290> drift<00:03:01.530> car<00:03:01.739> oh<00:03:01.950> I<00:03:02.840> just<00:03:03.840> I've<00:03:04.230> been

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
on the drift car oh I just I've been

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.160 
on the drift car oh I just I've been
doing<00:03:04.650> a<00:03:04.680> little<00:03:04.769> bit<00:03:04.950> of<00:03:04.980> research<00:03:05.280> today<00:03:05.550> and

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
doing a little bit of research today and

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.630 
doing a little bit of research today and
have<00:03:07.170> found<00:03:07.320> almost<00:03:07.530> nothing<00:03:07.860> I<00:03:08.100> know<00:03:08.160> the<00:03:08.340> TC

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
have found almost nothing I know the TC

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.430 
have found almost nothing I know the TC
for<00:03:08.880> is<00:03:09.030> not<00:03:09.150> a<00:03:09.209> popular<00:03:09.630> drift<00:03:09.840> car<00:03:10.080> because

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
for is not a popular drift car because

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.310 
for is not a popular drift car because
its<00:03:10.620> shaft<00:03:10.890> driven<00:03:11.100> and<00:03:11.370> all<00:03:11.459> that<00:03:11.700> but

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:12.320 
its shaft driven and all that but

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:15.290 
its shaft driven and all that but
looking<00:03:13.320> for<00:03:13.530> counter<00:03:14.519> steer<00:03:14.730> conversion<00:03:15.239> on

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
looking for counter steer conversion on

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.770 
looking for counter steer conversion on
this<00:03:15.420> car<00:03:15.660> some<00:03:15.900> people<00:03:16.110> are<00:03:16.200> saying<00:03:16.350> hpi

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
this car some people are saying hpi

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.840 
this car some people are saying hpi
diffs<00:03:18.780> and<00:03:18.930> ring<00:03:19.140> gears<00:03:19.410> will<00:03:19.620> work<00:03:19.830> so<00:03:20.760> you

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
diffs and ring gears will work so you

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:23.180 
diffs and ring gears will work so you
can<00:03:21.000> get<00:03:21.150> a<00:03:21.209> bit<00:03:21.330> of<00:03:21.480> a<00:03:21.540> counter<00:03:21.810> steer<00:03:22.190> setup

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
can get a bit of a counter steer setup

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:24.979 
can get a bit of a counter steer setup
going<00:03:23.340> on<00:03:23.550> so<00:03:23.760> if<00:03:23.850> anybody<00:03:24.209> had<00:03:24.390> any<00:03:24.540> details

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
going on so if anybody had any details

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:26.900 
going on so if anybody had any details
on<00:03:25.200> getting<00:03:25.650> a<00:03:25.680> TC<00:03:25.980> for<00:03:26.190> convert<00:03:26.489> the<00:03:26.640> counter

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
on getting a TC for convert the counter

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.240 
on getting a TC for convert the counter
steer<00:03:27.530> definitely<00:03:28.530> looking<00:03:28.739> for<00:03:28.920> info<00:03:29.190> on

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
steer definitely looking for info on

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:30.920 
steer definitely looking for info on
that<00:03:29.519> but<00:03:29.760> I'll<00:03:30.150> be<00:03:30.239> researching<00:03:30.660> that

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
that but I'll be researching that

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.220 
that but I'll be researching that
further<00:03:31.260> so<00:03:32.090> anyway<00:03:33.090> a<00:03:33.330> little<00:03:33.720> more<00:03:33.840> work<00:03:34.049> to

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
further so anyway a little more work to

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.759 
further so anyway a little more work to
do<00:03:34.380> on<00:03:34.980> this<00:03:35.130> body<00:03:35.400> so<00:03:35.810> i'll<00:03:36.810> update<00:03:37.380> again

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
do on this body so i'll update again

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:39.680 
do on this body so i'll update again
probably<00:03:38.760> in<00:03:38.820> just<00:03:38.970> a<00:03:39.030> couple<00:03:39.150> days<00:03:39.299> it<00:03:39.630> won't

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
probably in just a couple days it won't

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:40.910 
probably in just a couple days it won't
be<00:03:39.870> another<00:03:40.049> year<00:03:40.320> like<00:03:40.500> it<00:03:40.560> was<00:03:40.680> the<00:03:40.890> last

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
be another year like it was the last

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.670 
be another year like it was the last
time<00:03:41.280> so<00:03:42.049> thanks<00:03:43.049> for<00:03:43.110> watching<00:03:43.410> guys<00:03:43.440> to

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
time so thanks for watching guys to

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.310 
time so thanks for watching guys to
catch<00:03:43.799> up<00:03:43.980> next<00:03:44.130> one
