00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
why the box has to be so big you open it

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:03.830 
why the box has to be so big you open it
it's<00:04:01.859> got<00:04:02.010> the<00:04:02.129> card<00:04:02.370> tucked<00:04:02.639> in<00:04:02.819> here<00:04:03.180> the

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
it's got the card tucked in here the

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.520 
it's got the card tucked in here the
figures<00:04:04.500> over<00:04:05.069> here<00:04:05.959> so<00:04:06.959> really<00:04:07.109> they<00:04:07.379> could

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
figures over here so really they could

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.599 
figures over here so really they could
put<00:04:07.650> the<00:04:07.769> car<00:04:07.980> there<00:04:08.280> and<00:04:08.540> a<00:04:09.540> figure<00:04:09.780> and<00:04:10.169> even

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:10.609 
put the car there and a figure and even

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:13.939 
put the car there and a figure and even
another<00:04:11.609> figure<00:04:12.090> if<00:04:12.599> they<00:04:12.750> wanted<00:04:13.049> to<00:04:13.260> yeah<00:04:13.919> I

00:04:13.939 --> 00:04:13.949 
another figure if they wanted to yeah I

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:15.800 
another figure if they wanted to yeah I
think<00:04:14.160> the<00:04:14.250> box<00:04:14.489> could<00:04:14.730> be<00:04:14.790> about<00:04:15.120> that<00:04:15.359> big<00:04:15.629> I

think the box could be about that big I

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:17.599 
think the box could be about that big I
