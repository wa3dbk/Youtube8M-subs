00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.450
 guilty to the spade of the event the prize that went out of line and the Chilean government if the 

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:06.900
 make him a wall clock right now 

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:10.930
 There is no way to do it now or the staff is doing the 

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:11.639
 pilots 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.769
 the supreme because I'm great 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:16.999
 We'll see how the bike works. 

00:00:16.999 --> 00:00:19.039
 and the clock 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:21.009
 Can you tell me how you noticed? 

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:23.660
 Exactly, I'll get the vinyl record. 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:24.989
 I made a screen 

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:26.560
 I printed 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.560
 the numbering and the clock 

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:34.770
 I caught those were arrested 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.790
 and because your 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:39.420
 for him anyone 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.990
 come here I put here 

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:44.990
 in the middle 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:47.999
 then she 

00:00:47.999 --> 00:00:49.230
 I pick up machinery. 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.660
 branches was appropriate 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.660
 by far the greatest 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.090
 I put it here 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:01.090
 a piece because the team ensures 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:15.270
 there is nothing to see 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.349
 the 107 centralization produced 1 12 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.080
 ready then put the hands until marketed by the store 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.660
 I've sold it for about six years. 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:28.820
 I sell the roriz a lot 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.680
 I ran with the pointer worse. 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.680
 the inpi minutes then 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.430
 after second 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.240
 both are placed at 12 o'clock 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.490
 no 12 is paper of the time what is it that you get here to put time that wants 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.620
 as such now done live and the program 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.620
 up to 4 and since that date four of them here 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:01.440
 4 3 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.440
 so far followed with the copy behind 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.749
 had functioning 

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:11.749
 All right, your arm. 

00:02:29.289 --> 00:02:30.719
