00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:01.620 
hello everyone this love is designed

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:06.829 
hello everyone this love is designed
here<00:00:01.770> and<00:00:02.040> i<00:00:02.639> thought<00:00:03.570> i'd<00:00:03.750> bring<00:00:03.929> you<00:00:04.049> a<00:00:05.839> the

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
here and i thought i'd bring you a the

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.740 
here and i thought i'd bring you a the
next<00:00:07.080> part<00:00:07.259> of<00:00:07.440> the<00:00:07.710> demons<00:00:08.400> tutorial<00:00:08.910> for<00:00:09.179> for

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
next part of the demons tutorial for for

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:15.049 
next part of the demons tutorial for for
real<00:00:09.929> fo<00:00:11.900> so<00:00:12.900> yeah<00:00:13.110> i'm<00:00:13.370> in<00:00:14.370> this<00:00:14.580> one<00:00:14.820> we're

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
real fo so yeah i'm in this one we're

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.870 
real fo so yeah i'm in this one we're
doing<00:00:15.599> k<00:00:16.500> sphere<00:00:17.420> now<00:00:18.420> as<00:00:19.350> always<00:00:19.710> we<00:00:20.670> just

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
doing k sphere now as always we just

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.750 
doing k sphere now as always we just
have<00:00:21.029> this<00:00:21.439> basic<00:00:22.439> little<00:00:22.859> circle<00:00:23.400> emitter

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
have this basic little circle emitter

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.810 
have this basic little circle emitter
which<00:00:24.480> kind<00:00:25.109> of<00:00:25.170> comes<00:00:25.350> down<00:00:25.590> and<00:00:25.859> then<00:00:25.980> it's

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
which kind of comes down and then it's

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.910 
which kind of comes down and then it's
the<00:00:27.119> plane<00:00:27.750> there's<00:00:28.050> no<00:00:28.140> gravity<00:00:28.380> or<00:00:28.650> anything

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
the plane there's no gravity or anything

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.049 
the plane there's no gravity or anything
so<00:00:29.160> it<00:00:29.330> just<00:00:30.330> kind<00:00:30.599> of<00:00:31.520> fizzles<00:00:32.520> out<00:00:32.640> as<00:00:32.850> i

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
so it just kind of fizzles out as i

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.830 
so it just kind of fizzles out as i
always<00:00:33.180> say<00:00:34.040> on<00:00:35.270> basically<00:00:36.270> all<00:00:36.300> of<00:00:36.420> them<00:00:36.630> i

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
always say on basically all of them i

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.930 
always say on basically all of them i
mean<00:00:37.710> if<00:00:37.890> you're<00:00:38.010> following<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:38.579> series

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
mean if you're following the series

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.200 
mean if you're following the series
probably<00:00:39.780> sick<00:00:39.899> of<00:00:39.960> me<00:00:40.020> saying<00:00:40.110> it<00:00:40.730> but<00:00:41.730> I<00:00:41.910> mean

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
probably sick of me saying it but I mean

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.959 
probably sick of me saying it but I mean
how<00:00:42.360> could<00:00:42.480> you<00:00:42.540> get<00:00:42.780> stuck<00:00:42.960> with<00:00:43.050> my<00:00:43.140> voice

00:00:43.959 --> 00:00:43.969 
how could you get stuck with my voice

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:47.510 
how could you get stuck with my voice
but<00:00:44.969> yeah<00:00:45.149> anyway<00:00:45.450> so<00:00:45.510> basically<00:00:46.289> this<00:00:46.559> demon

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
but yeah anyway so basically this demon

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.540 
but yeah anyway so basically this demon
the<00:00:47.940> first<00:00:48.180> set<00:00:48.989> of<00:00:49.110> diamond<00:00:49.500> has<00:00:49.620> been<00:00:49.860> quite

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
the first set of diamond has been quite

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.630 
the first set of diamond has been quite
a<00:00:50.579> lot<00:00:50.910> about<00:00:53.570> so<00:00:54.570> a<00:00:54.629> bit<00:00:54.989> of<00:00:55.020> a<00:00:55.110> cold<00:00:55.320> and<00:00:55.590> but<00:00:56.100> I

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
a lot about so a bit of a cold and but I

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:57.799 
a lot about so a bit of a cold and but I
guess<00:00:56.879> it's<00:00:57.090> been<00:00:57.239> a<00:00:57.270> lot<00:00:57.420> of<00:00:57.480> our<00:00:57.629> making

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
guess it's been a lot of our making

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.340 
guess it's been a lot of our making
simulations<00:00:59.120> more<00:01:00.120> contained<00:01:00.750> or<00:01:01.050> rum<00:01:01.320> or

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
simulations more contained or rum or

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.570 
simulations more contained or rum or
more<00:01:02.190> stable<00:01:03.049> so<00:01:04.049> like<00:01:04.439> deleting<00:01:05.159> particles

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
more stable so like deleting particles

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.340 
more stable so like deleting particles
when<00:01:05.700> they<00:01:05.760> go<00:01:05.880> out<00:01:05.909> of<00:01:06.240> range<00:01:06.479> or<00:01:06.750> or

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
when they go out of range or or

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.640 
when they go out of range or or
something<00:01:07.650> like<00:01:07.740> that<00:01:07.799> and<00:01:08.159> this<00:01:08.670> one<00:01:08.939> is<00:01:09.210> very

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:09.650 
something like that and this one is very

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.730 
something like that and this one is very
much<00:01:10.650> similar<00:01:11.090> similar<00:01:12.350> it's<00:01:13.350> basically

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
much similar similar it's basically

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.789 
much similar similar it's basically
exactly<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.280> same<00:01:14.400> as<00:01:14.610> k<00:01:14.909> volume<00:01:15.570> but<00:01:16.470> it's<00:01:16.680> in

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
exactly the same as k volume but it's in

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.539 
exactly the same as k volume but it's in
a<00:01:16.890> circle<00:01:17.340> you<00:01:18.270> can<00:01:18.420> fit<00:01:18.659> it<00:01:18.780> to<00:01:18.960> object<00:01:19.619> so<00:01:20.070> if

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
a circle you can fit it to object so if

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.760 
a circle you can fit it to object so if
i<00:01:20.670> just<00:01:20.700> put<00:01:21.000> it<00:01:21.119> to<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.240> plane<00:01:21.570> you'll<00:01:22.560> see

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
i just put it to the plane you'll see

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.460 
i just put it to the plane you'll see
here<00:01:23.040> that<00:01:23.070> fits<00:01:23.369> around<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.729> plane<00:01:24.110> there<00:01:25.110> is

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
here that fits around the plane there is

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.480 
here that fits around the plane there is
also<00:01:26.780> with<00:01:27.780> leniency<00:01:28.170> as<00:01:28.920> you<00:01:29.130> can<00:01:29.189> see<00:01:29.340> around

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
also with leniency as you can see around

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:35.469 
also with leniency as you can see around
these<00:01:29.820> circles<00:01:30.689> I<00:01:31.009> mean<00:01:32.009> around<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.369> side<00:01:33.140> but

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479 
these circles I mean around the side but

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:40.460 
these circles I mean around the side but
so<00:01:36.479> that's<00:01:36.689> fit<00:01:36.960> to<00:01:36.990> seen<00:01:38.060> that<00:01:39.060> has<00:01:39.470> basically

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
so that's fit to seen that has basically

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.109 
so that's fit to seen that has basically
just<00:01:40.799> well<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.310> planes<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:41.729> biggest<00:01:41.970> thing

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
just well the planes the biggest thing

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.359 
just well the planes the biggest thing
there<00:01:42.270> so<00:01:42.479> I<00:01:42.689> mean<00:01:43.049> how<00:01:43.170> they're<00:01:43.350> doing<00:01:43.470> but<00:01:44.189> if

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
there so I mean how they're doing but if

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:49.760 
there so I mean how they're doing but if
we<00:01:44.430> just<00:01:44.670> turn<00:01:44.939> this<00:01:45.270> down<00:01:45.630> to<00:01:46.520> five<00:01:48.710> and<00:01:49.710> then

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
we just turn this down to five and then

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.639 
we just turn this down to five and then
we<00:01:50.130> go<00:01:50.340> here<00:01:50.729> um<00:01:50.909> you'll<00:01:51.600> see<00:01:51.750> that<00:01:51.930> I<00:01:52.170> you<00:01:52.320> can

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
we go here um you'll see that I you can

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.080 
we go here um you'll see that I you can
you<00:01:52.890> can<00:01:53.040> move<00:01:53.189> this<00:01:53.340> around<00:01:53.490> and<00:01:53.729> do<00:01:53.909> whatever

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
you can move this around and do whatever

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.999 
you can move this around and do whatever
you<00:01:54.270> want<00:01:54.450> with<00:01:54.509> it<00:01:54.630> I'm<00:01:54.899> just<00:01:55.619> for<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:55.860> sake

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
you want with it I'm just for the sake

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.469 
you want with it I'm just for the sake
of<00:01:56.040> this<00:01:56.159> patrol<00:01:56.490> I'll<00:01:56.670> just<00:01:56.880> move<00:01:57.090> it<00:01:57.240> up<00:01:57.329> a

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
of this patrol I'll just move it up a

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:02.899 
of this patrol I'll just move it up a
bit<00:01:57.509> um<00:02:00.020> no<00:02:01.020> that<00:02:01.290> may<00:02:01.649> be<00:02:01.680> a<00:02:01.829> bit<00:02:01.950> more<00:02:02.159> and

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
bit um no that may be a bit more and

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.510 
bit um no that may be a bit more and
then<00:02:02.969> when<00:02:03.750> i<00:02:03.780> hit<00:02:03.960> simulate<00:02:04.290> you'll<00:02:04.950> see<00:02:05.460> that

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
then when i hit simulate you'll see that

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.950 
then when i hit simulate you'll see that
when<00:02:08.520> it's<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:08.819> ground

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:11.960 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:16.060 

it<00:02:12.050> will<00:02:13.900> all<00:02:14.900> the<00:02:15.020> particles<00:02:15.290> will<00:02:15.620> go<00:02:15.830> out

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:16.070 
it will all the particles will go out

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.580 
it will all the particles will go out
and<00:02:16.340> when<00:02:16.940> they<00:02:17.060> hit<00:02:17.300> this<00:02:17.570> edge<00:02:18.200> of<00:02:18.470> the

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
and when they hit this edge of the

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:25.570 
and when they hit this edge of the
circle<00:02:19.540> or<00:02:20.540> delete<00:02:21.340> so<00:02:23.920> yeah<00:02:24.920> it<00:02:25.190> should

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
circle or delete so yeah it should

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:30.910 
circle or delete so yeah it should
happen<00:02:25.850> soon<00:02:28.630> yeah<00:02:29.630> yeah<00:02:30.110> so<00:02:30.560> you<00:02:30.620> can<00:02:30.770> see

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
happen soon yeah yeah so you can see

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.700 
happen soon yeah yeah so you can see
them<00:02:31.070> all<00:02:31.220> deleting<00:02:31.840> when<00:02:32.840> I<00:02:32.870> hit<00:02:33.020> the<00:02:33.080> circle

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:33.710 
them all deleting when I hit the circle

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:38.950 
them all deleting when I hit the circle
of<00:02:34.420> may<00:02:35.420> the<00:02:35.450> circle<00:02:35.810> here<00:02:37.240> and<00:02:38.240> yeah<00:02:38.390> i<00:02:38.420> mean<00:02:38.720> i

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:38.960 
of may the circle here and yeah i mean i

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.160 
of may the circle here and yeah i mean i
don't<00:02:39.620> i<00:02:39.860> guess<00:02:40.580> if<00:02:40.820> you<00:02:41.030> are<00:02:41.270> i<00:02:41.510> don't<00:02:41.930> really

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
don't i guess if you are i don't really

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.360 
don't i guess if you are i don't really
see<00:02:42.260> what<00:02:42.650> the<00:02:42.770> advantage<00:02:43.220> of<00:02:43.250> this<00:02:43.610> over<00:02:44.600> k

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
see what the advantage of this over k

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:52.060 
see what the advantage of this over k
volume<00:02:46.370> are<00:02:48.220> but<00:02:49.720> mmm<00:02:50.720> I<00:02:50.960> don't<00:02:51.650> know<00:02:51.830> maybe

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:52.070 
volume are but mmm I don't know maybe

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:54.100 
volume are but mmm I don't know maybe
you<00:02:52.220> do<00:02:52.340> something<00:02:52.610> with<00:02:52.790> it<00:02:52.820> you<00:02:53.690> can<00:02:53.840> change

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
you do something with it you can change

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.280 
you do something with it you can change
all<00:02:54.500> the<00:02:54.890> so<00:02:55.820> if<00:02:56.420> you<00:02:56.630> don't<00:02:56.900> want<00:02:57.050> to<00:02:57.110> have<00:02:57.200> it

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
all the so if you don't want to have it

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.190 
all the so if you don't want to have it
kind<00:02:57.470> of<00:02:57.560> square<00:02:58.010> or<00:02:58.340> just<00:02:58.760> circle<00:02:59.270> the<00:03:00.020> owner

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
kind of square or just circle the owner

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.630 
kind of square or just circle the owner
actually<00:03:00.940> prefer<00:03:01.940> the<00:03:02.000> scale<00:03:02.360> on<00:03:02.570> life<00:03:03.640> all

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 
actually prefer the scale on life all

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.090 
actually prefer the scale on life all
right<00:03:05.000> okay<00:03:05.480> and<00:03:05.540> that<00:03:05.750> didn't<00:03:05.960> work<00:03:06.020> as<00:03:06.470> um<00:03:06.860> as

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.100 
right okay and that didn't work as um as

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:17.400 
right okay and that didn't work as um as
I<00:03:07.610> plan<00:03:08.470> but<00:03:09.470> oh<00:03:09.710> well<00:03:10.990> um<00:03:12.730> so<00:03:14.230> I'll<00:03:15.230> just<00:03:15.520> check

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
I plan but oh well um so I'll just check

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:19.480 
I plan but oh well um so I'll just check
what<00:03:18.410> the<00:03:18.530> inverse<00:03:18.770> does<00:03:19.070> because<00:03:19.400> I've

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:19.490 
what the inverse does because I've

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:22.990 
what the inverse does because I've
naturally<00:03:19.850> played<00:03:20.060> around<00:03:20.300> with<00:03:20.450> this<00:03:22.000> okay

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
naturally played around with this okay

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:29.080 
naturally played around with this okay
okay<00:03:23.500> so<00:03:24.550> if<00:03:25.550> we<00:03:26.210> move<00:03:26.600> the<00:03:26.930> meter<00:03:27.920> out<00:03:28.730> of<00:03:28.970> the

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
okay so if we move the meter out of the

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:34.510 
okay so if we move the meter out of the
circle<00:03:29.560> and<00:03:31.510> we<00:03:32.510> just<00:03:32.720> hit<00:03:32.810> simulate<00:03:33.520> now

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:34.520 
circle and we just hit simulate now

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.940 
circle and we just hit simulate now
everything<00:03:35.060> outside<00:03:35.300> the<00:03:35.900> circle<00:03:36.140> will

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
everything outside the circle will

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:39.610 
everything outside the circle will
simulate<00:03:37.540> but<00:03:38.540> then<00:03:38.690> when<00:03:39.020> it<00:03:39.170> touches<00:03:39.410> the

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
simulate but then when it touches the

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.590 
simulate but then when it touches the
inside<00:03:39.800> of<00:03:40.160> the<00:03:40.310> circle<00:03:40.460> which<00:03:41.330> is<00:03:41.480> this

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:41.600 
inside of the circle which is this

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.960 
inside of the circle which is this
little<00:03:41.900> purple<00:03:42.380> line<00:03:42.530> here<00:03:42.800> it<00:03:43.700> will

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
little purple line here it will

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.950 
little purple line here it will
obviously<00:03:45.250> delete<00:03:46.250> if<00:03:47.000> you<00:03:47.450> are<00:03:47.690> if<00:03:47.900> you

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:47.960 
obviously delete if you are if you

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.120 
obviously delete if you are if you
haven't<00:03:48.200> gotten<00:03:48.320> the<00:03:48.410> gist<00:03:48.620> of<00:03:48.740> that<00:03:48.890> already

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.130 
haven't gotten the gist of that already

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:51.850 
haven't gotten the gist of that already
but<00:03:50.030> that's<00:03:50.240> some<00:03:50.600> okay<00:03:51.140> dive<00:03:51.380> in<00:03:51.560> under

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:51.860 
but that's some okay dive in under

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:55.060 
but that's some okay dive in under
that's<00:03:52.040> pretty<00:03:52.280> easy<00:03:52.810> to<00:03:53.810> figure<00:03:54.110> out<00:03:54.500> so<00:03:55.010> you

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:55.070 
that's pretty easy to figure out so you

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:57.300 
that's pretty easy to figure out so you
can<00:03:55.340> see<00:03:55.490> they're<00:03:55.640> just<00:03:55.820> a<00:03:55.940> leading<00:03:56.270> there

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310 
can see they're just a leading there

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:59.680 
can see they're just a leading there
none<00:03:58.310> of<00:03:58.340> it<00:03:58.550> still<00:03:58.790> eating<00:03:59.030> out<00:03:59.120> here<00:03:59.360> it<00:03:59.540> is

00:03:59.680 --> 00:03:59.690 
none of it still eating out here it is

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:04.630 
none of it still eating out here it is
to<00:03:59.840> leading<00:04:00.140> here<00:04:00.380> um<00:04:01.090> and<00:04:02.090> yeah<00:04:03.080> I<00:04:03.640> guess

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:04.640 
to leading here um and yeah I guess

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.990 
to leading here um and yeah I guess
that's<00:04:04.850> all<00:04:05.000> um<00:04:06.280> don't<00:04:07.280> have<00:04:07.550> anything<00:04:07.730> else

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
that's all um don't have anything else

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:15.580 
that's all um don't have anything else
to<00:04:08.300> say<00:04:11.440> also<00:04:12.440> I<00:04:12.470> oh<00:04:12.890> yeah<00:04:13.250> if<00:04:13.640> you<00:04:14.350> whoops<00:04:15.350> um

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590 
to say also I oh yeah if you whoops um

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:19.180 
to say also I oh yeah if you whoops um
if<00:04:16.100> you<00:04:16.220> are<00:04:16.340> a<00:04:16.370> regular<00:04:16.430> subscriber<00:04:17.299> um<00:04:18.190> maybe

yeah anyway so I I just got the the

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:53.379 
yeah anyway so I I just got the the
channel<00:04:51.110> monetize<00:04:51.590> done<00:04:52.030> it's<00:04:53.030> probably<00:04:53.120> like

00:04:53.379 --> 00:04:53.389 
channel monetize done it's probably like

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:55.570 
channel monetize done it's probably like
signing<00:04:53.720> for<00:04:53.840> you<00:04:53.960> guys<00:04:54.110> but<00:04:54.410> started<00:04:55.400> for<00:04:55.550> me

signing for you guys but started for me
a<00:04:56.530> second<00:04:57.530> channel<00:04:57.800> that's<00:04:57.890> monetized<00:04:58.430> by<00:04:58.790> the

00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120
