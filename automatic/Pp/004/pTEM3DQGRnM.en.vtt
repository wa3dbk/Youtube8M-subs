four-door<00:04:38.420> and<00:04:38.720> the<00:04:38.960> five-door<00:04:39.530> we<00:04:39.680> think

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:39.890 
four-door and the five-door we think

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:42.460 
four-door and the five-door we think
will<00:04:39.980> probably<00:04:40.280> be<00:04:40.370> a<00:04:41.180> little<00:04:41.870> bit<00:04:42.020> more

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:42.470 
will probably be a little bit more

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:45.160 
will probably be a little bit more
sporting<00:04:43.010> than<00:04:43.240> than<00:04:44.240> previously<00:04:44.750> it's<00:04:44.990> about

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:45.170 
sporting than than previously it's about

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:47.470 
sporting than than previously it's about
two<00:04:45.440> inches<00:04:45.710> shorter<00:04:45.770> than<00:04:46.160> the<00:04:46.460> outgoing<00:04:46.670> WRX

models<00:04:48.400> the<00:04:49.400> same<00:04:49.610> time<00:04:49.790> we've<00:04:49.940> also

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.030 
models the same time we've also

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:53.530 
models the same time we've also
developed<00:04:50.840> a<00:04:51.200> four-door<00:04:51.950> version<00:04:52.040> that<00:04:52.970> has

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:53.540 
developed a four-door version that has

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:55.270 
developed a four-door version that has
actually<00:04:53.840> have<00:04:53.990> more<00:04:54.170> usable<00:04:54.560> space<00:04:54.620> than<00:04:55.070> the

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:55.280 
actually have more usable space than the

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:56.980

grow by about two inches in width with a
three-inch<00:05:00.740> longer<00:05:01.010> wheelbase<00:05:01.190> so<00:05:01.460> we've

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:01.580 
three-inch longer wheelbase so we've

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:04.030 
three-inch longer wheelbase so we've
basically<00:05:01.790> done<00:05:01.970> is<00:05:02.120> try<00:05:02.270> to<00:05:02.330> improve<00:05:03.040> the

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:16.670 
mean everything is new on the vehicle

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:18.280

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:37.870 
we had on a previous generation that WRX
we<00:05:36.170> think<00:05:36.380> we've<00:05:36.470> accomplished<00:05:36.980> that<00:05:37.340> but

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:37.880 
we think we've accomplished that but

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:39.400 
we think we've accomplished that but
with<00:05:38.060> that<00:05:38.210> we've<00:05:38.330> got<00:05:38.510> a<00:05:38.540> lot<00:05:38.780> more<00:05:38.810> a<00:05:39.230> lot

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:39.410 
with that we've got a lot more a lot

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:41.200 
with that we've got a lot more a lot
more<00:05:39.470> comfort<00:05:40.010> to<00:05:40.130> the<00:05:40.220> interior<00:05:40.640> a<00:05:40.670> lot<00:05:41.060> more

more comfort to the interior a lot more

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:44.140 
more comfort to the interior a lot more

the interior for for for our owners and
we've<00:05:47.420> added<00:05:48.080> some<00:05:48.320> things<00:05:48.560> that<00:05:48.740> people<00:05:48.860> have

we've added some things that people have

that have made the direct tremendous
success<00:06:12.689> and<00:06:12.930> then<00:06:13.469> to<00:06:13.590> really<00:06:13.830> just<00:06:14.009> make<00:06:14.129> it

00:06:14.209 --> 00:06:14.219 
success and then to really just make it

00:06:14.219 --> 00:06:15.920 
success and then to really just make it
a<00:06:14.249> lot<00:06:14.370> more<00:06:14.460> comfortable<00:06:14.699> as<00:06:15.659> well<00:06:15.840> as

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:15.930 
a lot more comfortable as well as

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:17.059 
a lot more comfortable as well as
