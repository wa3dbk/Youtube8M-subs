00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:07.120
 commenting and I bring you to open a 

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:10.059
 bit a seek and destroy with grief 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:11.230
 account on the zittau map you have not told me 

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:12.669
 asked to upload some search and destroy 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:15.099
 is when this morning and well this is 

00:00:12.669 --> 00:00:18.220
 a game that was pretty low and 

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:19.449
 well first of all say that good 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.980
 montage yesterday I think you liked it 

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:23.890
 enough people that we liked already 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.720
 I'm sorry because I'm not a sniper 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.330
 pull 10 hours a day during I do not know 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.529
 how many months to get a clip of me or 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.570
 be with the clicks when I play because 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:34.720
 normal game get me gameplays and it 's 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:37.120
 25% of the time that I play the game to 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.710
 get me gameplays and not get clips or 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.000
 I belong to no big sniper if 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.500
 besides the assembly in was a montage of 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.420
 sniper in the assembly of call of duty in 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.560
 general so good to those who has 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.600
 liked well those who do not 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:49.090
 subscribe some assembly channel here 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:52.330
 this is a gameplays channel to give 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:53.440
 tips etc and well said this I am 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:57.220
 seeing that I am playing has already been said 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:59.470
 with the 90 with the muffler and the elves 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.790
 graneado that I played the other day in the 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:02.890
 let's do without aiming is a simple and 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:04.480
 quite similar only for the weapon and the 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:05.950
 map not by mode 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.450
 and here I am seeing that it goes around 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.770
 on the right side and me when 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.600
 game seeks to destroy has to be a 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.000
 little intelligent is to say let's see if 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.740
 me on the right now that is one of 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.120
 the areas better to turn around and not 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.190
 I was nobody is to say nobody has 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:19.510
 seen turning around let's repeat no 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:20.920
 since we take with a silencer and I 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:22.570
 I think that to give the essential return the 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.070
 part that a killer does not stop 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.050
 but so that you turn me around without being 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.210
 seen in the vee so good i go back 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:29.260
 to my site and attention because look at what 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.520
 who finds me here found me 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.500
 I'm jumping the wall there they are 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.810
 doing a hurdle race and they go to 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.030
 see me load these two and well so 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.440
 this indicates that the next round does not 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.660
 I'm going to come here because they're going to 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.670
 be waiting then you will see how 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:44.590
 change strategy so what before 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.270
 we go around the map and from here 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.010
 we have much easier to find the 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.960
 that are by means of the house map 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:51.100
 Etc. always have sun some campero 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.010
 in this case this game had not 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:56.110
 no campero so extreme because there 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:57.940
 some that go web and be looking at that 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.830
 I was there waiting for my partner 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.330
 to kill I say I'm not going to kill you 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:03.490
 hehehe 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:05.350
 so here you are watching another camera 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.490
 of death that I suck my mother I 'm going 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.490
 to suck all the death cameras of 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:11.320
 the TV and I think all for me and it's a 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:12.550
 game that I almost made myself like that talk a 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.980
 little bit more, I think I could 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:17.110
 even take out the morale not because if it's 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.790
 a 40 was very fast and he had left 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.350
 that would have put the bomb or put the 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.180
 pump and that let's turn it off or something 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:23.590
 of that good there could be something else is 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.820
 very difficult since it 's a love end search 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.530
 and destroy and attention because now 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:27.820
 you are seeing that I am not going for his 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.130
 but you see in the middle they are pulling 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:32.080
 stunt so I look and uy surprise 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:34.810
 there was one and attention because I checked in a 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.310
 wall and entity was there up here 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.860
 up something else and tell you what are you doing 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.180
 up here you too dead I say good 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.710
 good good what is coming out of me 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:46.170
 here I am literally he threw it 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:47.640
 pump placed so we've cleaned this 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.700
 area we can go around here with 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:53.060
 beware this one that is waiting for me and 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.130
 they remove it that keeps the 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.720
 so we come back again to give the 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.700
 come back here with care of the 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.220
 campers whether we shot him from 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:03.170
 hip as in the egg gameplay of 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.459
 this as it is called from the other day so 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:06.920
 of hip this weapon as I had of 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:09.290
 specialist and I class the class 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.269
 what I wear is killer marathon 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.590
 draw what you want then silence 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:13.790
 deadly and essential and how they had 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.530
 specialists here well I had 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.790
 stable aim and you have to take advantage of 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:17.200
 the stable aim connects gun that goes 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.480
 very well 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.519
 90 last round we change sides by 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.620
 what on this side have not seen me 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:26.360
 quality that I do so I 'm going to go back to 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:28.640
 repeat of tactics of going for the monkey 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:31.489
 since it is an area that many people do not 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.360
 arrives if a marathon does not arrive and here 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:33.680
 I'm seeing that you have a little 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.360
 smart I'm watching people up 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.769
 but I'm going to move on his face because with 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:38.120
 this weapon from afar I will not make them 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:39.739
 nothing now we upload support no os 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.030
 Worry we go around here 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:42.290
 you have to look well that there is no 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.940
 Campero it before the tired or 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:45.110
 corners well we go up and we who loves me 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.299
 remove this from the left no no no no 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:49.640
 they are mine friends of mine lake look 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:52.280
 of the tiger there to say they are not 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.480
 mine and again I'm taking the camera 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.670
 death four of four cameras 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:58.579
 death there is quite a departure 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:00.140
 perfect pretty good an 11-0 quickie 

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:03.500
 so good if you like 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:06.050
 destroy it I like it if you want what 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.950
 we go up to search and destroy because it is a 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:08.750
 world that I do not like much but 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:11.209
 quickie 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.950
 if you play home like the so good
