00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.249 
one or two headed goals here and there
and<00:01:21.119> you<00:01:21.299> don't<00:01:21.479> really<00:01:21.659> see<00:01:21.869> him<00:01:21.960> tracking

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
and you don't really see him tracking

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.170 
and you don't really see him tracking
back<00:01:22.500> too<00:01:22.770> much<00:01:22.950> to<00:01:23.100> be<00:01:23.189> honest<00:01:23.400> with<00:01:23.490> you<00:01:23.640> so<00:01:24.150> I

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
back too much to be honest with you so I

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.870 
back too much to be honest with you so I
gave<00:01:24.299> him<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.630> 87<00:01:25.409> overall<00:01:26.040> and<00:01:26.340> he's

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
gave him the 87 overall and he's

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.429 
gave him the 87 overall and he's
obviously<00:01:27.000> in<00:01:27.360> his<00:01:27.479> striker<00:01:27.810> roles<00:01:28.170> that's

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
obviously in his striker roles that's

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.950 
obviously in his striker roles that's
where<00:01:28.619> he<00:01:28.740> predominantly<00:01:29.369> plays<00:01:29.840> when<00:01:30.840> he's

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
where he predominantly plays when he's

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.630 
where he predominantly plays when he's
playing<00:01:31.079> throughout<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.619> season<00:01:32.040> and<00:01:32.189> I

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
playing throughout the season and I

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.340 
playing throughout the season and I
think<00:01:32.700> that<00:01:32.939> those<00:01:33.210> ratings<00:01:33.630> Oh<00:01:33.810> stats<00:01:34.140> are

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
think that those ratings Oh stats are

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.100 
think that those ratings Oh stats are

season<00:02:51.629> he<00:02:51.659> scored<00:02:51.930> eight<00:02:52.310> notes<00:02:53.310> got<00:02:53.760> 12<00:02:54.120> and

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:54.389 
season he scored eight notes got 12 and

00:02:54.389 --> 00:02:57.259 
season he scored eight notes got 12 and
assisted<00:02:54.900> 8<00:02:55.109> and<00:02:55.500> which<00:02:56.400> isn't<00:02:56.730> too<00:02:56.849> bad<00:02:57.060> for

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
assisted 8 and which isn't too bad for

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:59.330 
assisted 8 and which isn't too bad for
him<00:02:57.329> for<00:02:57.659> an<00:02:57.780> 82<00:02:58.109> overall<00:02:58.560> I<00:02:58.590> guess<00:02:59.099> that's

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
him for an 82 overall I guess that's

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.490 
him for an 82 overall I guess that's
kinda<00:02:59.730> what<00:02:59.819> you'd<00:02:59.849> expect<00:03:00.120> he<00:03:00.930> is<00:03:01.079> no<00:03:01.349> longer

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
kinda what you'd expect he is no longer
