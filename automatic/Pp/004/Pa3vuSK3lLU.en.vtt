tubing<00:01:24.680> is<00:01:24.799> routed<00:01:25.219> next<00:01:25.880> we've<00:01:26.000> got<00:01:26.030> a<00:01:26.210> couple

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
tubing is routed next we've got a couple

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.749 
tubing is routed next we've got a couple
of<00:01:26.600> stalkers<00:01:27.049> so<00:01:27.710> you<00:01:27.770> take<00:01:28.009> those<00:01:28.189> Stoppers

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:28.759 
of stalkers so you take those Stoppers

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:31.899 
of stalkers so you take those Stoppers
and<00:01:28.909> you<00:01:29.000> put<00:01:29.180> them<00:01:29.359> opposite<00:01:30.579> where<00:01:31.579> the

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:31.909 
and you put them opposite where the

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:33.609 
and you put them opposite where the
fittings<00:01:32.420> are<00:01:32.600> so<00:01:32.630> you<00:01:32.840> go<00:01:32.960> like<00:01:32.990> this<00:01:33.289> so<00:01:33.500> that

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:33.619 
fittings are so you go like this so that

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:34.779 
fittings are so you go like this so that
doesn't<00:01:33.950> just<00:01:34.070> go<00:01:34.189> straight<00:01:34.490> through<00:01:34.700> the

doesn't just go straight through the

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:36.819 
doesn't just go straight through the
card<00:01:35.030> and<00:01:35.240> spray<00:01:35.929> all<00:01:36.049> over<00:01:36.079> your<00:01:36.439> motherboard

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:36.829 
card and spray all over your motherboard

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:39.310 
card and spray all over your motherboard
got<00:01:37.579> some<00:01:37.789> mounting<00:01:38.420> hardware<00:01:38.600> got<00:01:39.049> a<00:01:39.079> couple

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 
got some mounting hardware got a couple

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.370 
got some mounting hardware got a couple
little<00:01:39.619> lock<00:01:40.280> washers<00:01:40.850> got<00:01:41.270> some<00:01:41.659> little

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
little lock washers got some little

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.230 
little lock washers got some little
screws<00:01:42.890> there<00:01:43.219> so<00:01:43.429> you'll<00:01:43.579> need<00:01:43.729> that<00:01:43.969> in

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
screws there so you'll need that in

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.179 
screws there so you'll need that in
order<00:01:44.329> to<00:01:44.659> mount<00:01:44.780> the<00:01:44.990> block<00:01:45.200> finally<00:01:45.710> some

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:46.189 
order to mount the block finally some

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:47.770 
order to mount the block finally some
thermal<00:01:46.520> compound<00:01:46.700> so<00:01:47.119> the<00:01:47.240> thermal<00:01:47.420> compound

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
thermal compound so the thermal compound

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.730 
thermal compound so the thermal compound
will<00:01:48.649> only<00:01:48.950> in<00:01:49.429> a<00:01:49.490> case<00:01:49.700> like<00:01:49.850> this<00:01:50.409> before<00:01:51.409> the

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
will only in a case like this before the

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.969 
of the memory and vrm and other
components<00:01:58.429> that<00:01:59.329> are<00:01:59.390> on<00:01:59.749> the<00:02:00.109> PCB<00:02:00.560> of<00:02:00.859> the

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979 
components that are on the PCB of the

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:03.069 
components that are on the PCB of the
video<00:02:01.249> card<00:02:01.609> so<00:02:01.969> let's<00:02:02.240> have<00:02:02.359> a<00:02:02.420> look<00:02:02.719> at<00:02:02.869> the

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:03.079 
video card so let's have a look at the

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:05.160 
video card so let's have a look at the
construction<00:02:03.439> of<00:02:03.859> this<00:02:03.979> product<00:02:04.429> overall<00:02:04.759> and

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
construction of this product overall and

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.499 
construction of this product overall and
so<00:02:06.170> far<00:02:06.380> I've<00:02:06.560> only<00:02:06.649> gotten<00:02:07.009> to<00:02:07.310> the<00:02:07.460> EVGA<00:02:07.880> part

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
so far I've only gotten to the EVGA part

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:10.510 
so far I've only gotten to the EVGA part
of<00:02:08.690> the<00:02:08.840> collaboration<00:02:09.170> but<00:02:09.830> as<00:02:10.100> soon<00:02:10.280> as<00:02:10.429> I

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 
of the collaboration but as soon as I

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.670 
of the collaboration but as soon as I
remove<00:02:10.819> this<00:02:10.970> piece<00:02:11.210> of<00:02:11.420> plastic<00:02:11.960> right<00:02:12.260> here

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
remove this piece of plastic right here

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.640 
remove this piece of plastic right here
it<00:02:13.220> will<00:02:13.340> become<00:02:13.700> more<00:02:14.150> apparent<00:02:14.350> who<00:02:15.350> these

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
it will become more apparent who these

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.190 
it will become more apparent who these
other<00:02:16.630> co-conspirator<00:02:17.630> is

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
other co-conspirator is

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.050 
other co-conspirator is
in<00:02:18.410> creating<00:02:19.010> this<00:02:19.129> product<00:02:19.640> see<00:02:19.849> they're

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
in creating this product see they're

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.259 
in creating this product see they're
powered<00:02:20.540> by<00:02:20.690> swiftech<00:02:21.260> so<00:02:22.129> that<00:02:22.400> is<00:02:22.700> machined

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:23.269 
powered by swiftech so that is machined

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:25.900 
powered by swiftech so that is machined
into<00:02:23.660> the<00:02:24.170> delrin<00:02:24.769> so<00:02:25.010> this<00:02:25.160> is<00:02:25.280> a<00:02:25.310> very<00:02:25.730> very

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
into the delrin so this is a very very

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:27.640 
into the delrin so this is a very very
durable<00:02:26.330> block<00:02:26.780> for<00:02:27.080> a<00:02:27.110> couple<00:02:27.379> of<00:02:27.470> reasons

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
durable block for a couple of reasons

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.059 
durable block for a couple of reasons
many<00:02:28.489> water<00:02:28.790> blocks<00:02:29.150> over<00:02:29.480> the<00:02:29.720> past<00:02:29.959> as<00:02:30.800> long

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:31.069 
many water blocks over the past as long

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:32.740 
many water blocks over the past as long
as<00:02:31.250> people<00:02:31.580> have<00:02:31.610> been<00:02:31.790> water<00:02:32.030> cooling<00:02:32.420> are

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
as people have been water cooling are

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.009 
as people have been water cooling are
constructed<00:02:33.530> from<00:02:33.709> a<00:02:33.980> copper<00:02:34.519> base<00:02:34.700> so<00:02:35.660> here

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:36.019 
constructed from a copper base so here

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:38.500 
constructed from a copper base so here
you<00:02:36.170> can<00:02:36.200> see<00:02:36.620> this<00:02:37.130> is<00:02:37.310> a<00:02:37.340> copper<00:02:37.790> base<00:02:38.000> plated

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
you can see this is a copper base plated

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.050 
you can see this is a copper base plated
with<00:02:38.630> nickel<00:02:39.140> nickel<00:02:39.680> is<00:02:40.069> not<00:02:40.430> harmful<00:02:40.910> to

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
with nickel nickel is not harmful to

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.809 
with nickel nickel is not harmful to
your<00:02:41.269> water<00:02:41.510> cooling<00:02:41.959> loop<00:02:42.230> because<00:02:42.920> it<00:02:43.459> is

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:43.819 
your water cooling loop because it is

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:46.570 
your water cooling loop because it is
close<00:02:44.330> enough<00:02:44.510> to<00:02:44.660> copper<00:02:45.280> that<00:02:46.280> you're<00:02:46.430> not

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:46.580 
close enough to copper that you're not

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.160 
close enough to copper that you're not
going<00:02:46.790> to<00:02:46.849> have<00:02:47.000> problems<00:02:47.299> with<00:02:47.629> corrosion

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
going to have problems with corrosion

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.800 
going to have problems with corrosion
okay<00:02:49.129> so<00:02:49.190> what<00:02:49.489> that<00:02:49.519> basically<00:02:49.910> means<00:02:50.239> is<00:02:50.630> it

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
okay so what that basically means is it

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.170 
okay so what that basically means is it
is<00:02:50.900> safe<00:02:51.200> to<00:02:51.230> mix<00:02:51.560> a<00:02:51.680> loop<00:02:51.890> with<00:02:52.400> nickel<00:02:52.940> blocks

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
is safe to mix a loop with nickel blocks

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.180 
is safe to mix a loop with nickel blocks
and<00:02:53.480> copper<00:02:53.780> blocks<00:02:54.019> whereas<00:02:54.410> it<00:02:54.560> is<00:02:54.590> not<00:02:54.920> safe

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
and copper blocks whereas it is not safe

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.220 
and copper blocks whereas it is not safe
to<00:02:55.400> mix<00:02:55.580> a<00:02:55.700> loop<00:02:55.880> with<00:02:56.329> copper<00:02:56.690> blocks<00:02:56.989> and

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
to mix a loop with copper blocks and

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:58.990 
to mix a loop with copper blocks and
aluminum<00:02:57.680> block<00:02:57.860> so<00:02:58.130> remember<00:02:58.519> that<00:02:58.670> you<00:02:58.790> guys

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
aluminum block so remember that you guys

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.800 
aluminum block so remember that you guys
okay<00:03:00.099> also<00:03:01.099> on<00:03:01.280> the<00:03:01.430> top<00:03:01.640> instead<00:03:02.150> of<00:03:02.299> using<00:03:02.510> a

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
okay also on the top instead of using a

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.130 
okay also on the top instead of using a
plexi<00:03:03.410> top<00:03:03.620> which<00:03:03.890> is<00:03:04.069> a<00:03:04.099> clear<00:03:04.819> top<00:03:05.140> swiftech

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
plexi top which is a clear top swiftech

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.920 
plexi top which is a clear top swiftech
has<00:03:06.410> opted<00:03:06.890> to<00:03:07.040> go<00:03:07.069> with<00:03:07.220> a<00:03:07.610> delrin<00:03:08.180> or<00:03:08.360> asset

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
has opted to go with a delrin or asset

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:11.979 
has opted to go with a delrin or asset
i'll<00:03:09.079> top<00:03:09.440> which<00:03:10.069> means<00:03:10.099> that<00:03:10.549> the<00:03:11.000> odds<00:03:11.150> of<00:03:11.569> it

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:11.989 
i'll top which means that the odds of it

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:15.009 
i'll top which means that the odds of it
cracking<00:03:12.650> are<00:03:13.430> basically<00:03:14.060> nothing<00:03:14.540> with

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:15.019 
cracking are basically nothing with

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:17.440 
cracking are basically nothing with
plexi<00:03:15.500> especially<00:03:16.220> around<00:03:16.340> the<00:03:16.819> fittings

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
plexi especially around the fittings

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.900 
plexi especially around the fittings
like<00:03:17.569> around<00:03:17.959> here<00:03:18.319> sometimes<00:03:19.310> if<00:03:19.549> people

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
like around here sometimes if people

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:22.030 
like around here sometimes if people
crank<00:03:20.299> the<00:03:20.630> the<00:03:21.049> barbs<00:03:21.349> in<00:03:21.530> too<00:03:21.769> tight<00:03:21.799> for

crank the the barbs in too tight for

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.129 
crank the the barbs in too tight for
example<00:03:22.760> you<00:03:23.209> know<00:03:23.239> that<00:03:23.480> just<00:03:23.660> tighten<00:03:24.019> that

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:24.139 
example you know that just tighten that

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:26.379 
example you know that just tighten that
down<00:03:24.200> really<00:03:24.590> hard<00:03:24.790> what<00:03:25.790> can<00:03:25.940> happen<00:03:26.090> is<00:03:26.359> you

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:26.389 
down really hard what can happen is you

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:28.030 
down really hard what can happen is you
can<00:03:26.569> have<00:03:26.720> little<00:03:26.840> micro<00:03:27.260> cracks<00:03:27.560> form<00:03:27.829> around

much of a mess of these before I'm ready
to<00:03:48.260> install<00:03:48.500> them<00:03:48.769> on<00:03:48.889> the<00:03:49.040> cards<00:03:49.459> now

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:50.269 
to install them on the cards now

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:52.090 
to install them on the cards now
normally<00:03:50.780> you<00:03:51.170> can<00:03:51.350> only<00:03:51.410> get<00:03:51.620> a<00:03:51.680> block<00:03:51.920> like

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:52.100 
normally you can only get a block like

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:55.000 
normally you can only get a block like
this<00:03:52.310> with<00:03:52.549> an<00:03:52.670> EVGA<00:03:52.940> classified<00:03:53.500> 590<00:03:54.500> card

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010 
this with an EVGA classified 590 card

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:59.710 
this with an EVGA classified 590 card
but<00:03:55.730> because<00:03:56.209> i<00:03:56.540> already<00:03:56.989> have<00:03:57.470> cards<00:03:58.720> right

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
but because i already have cards right

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.879 
but because i already have cards right
here<00:04:00.160> five<00:04:01.160> 90s<00:04:01.609> I<00:04:01.900> asked<00:04:02.900> d<00:04:03.049> vga<00:04:03.440> to<00:04:03.560> send<00:04:03.769> me

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:03.889 
here five 90s I asked d vga to send me

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:06.089 
here five 90s I asked d vga to send me
just<00:04:04.130> the<00:04:04.280> blocks<00:04:04.579> for<00:04:05.030> this<00:04:05.180> particular

00:04:06.089 --> 00:04:06.099 
just the blocks for this particular

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:08.170 
just the blocks for this particular
showcase<00:04:07.099> so<00:04:07.609> i'm<00:04:07.730> going<00:04:07.819> to<00:04:07.910> show<00:04:08.030> you<00:04:08.060> guys

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.180 
showcase so i'm going to show you guys

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.620 
showcase so i'm going to show you guys
the<00:04:08.889> mirror<00:04:09.889> shot<00:04:10.190> check<00:04:11.000> that<00:04:11.180> out<00:04:11.209> I<00:04:11.480> mean

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:11.630 
the mirror shot check that out I mean

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:13.750 
the mirror shot check that out I mean
look<00:04:11.660> how<00:04:12.049> reflective<00:04:12.319> this<00:04:12.709> thing<00:04:12.889> is<00:04:13.069> very

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:13.760 
look how reflective this thing is very

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.819 
look how reflective this thing is very
very<00:04:14.000> beautiful<00:04:14.299> surface<00:04:15.019> machined<00:04:15.500> on<00:04:15.650> there

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:15.829 
very beautiful surface machined on there

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:18.190 
very beautiful surface machined on there
so<00:04:16.070> how<00:04:16.639> does<00:04:16.700> the<00:04:17.060> technology<00:04:17.630> actually<00:04:17.810> work

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:18.200 
so how does the technology actually work

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.170 
so how does the technology actually work
here<00:04:18.229> well<00:04:18.620> Swift<00:04:19.250> acts<00:04:19.430> been<00:04:19.609> making<00:04:19.940> blocks

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:20.180 
here well Swift acts been making blocks

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.000 
here well Swift acts been making blocks
for<00:04:20.450> pretty<00:04:20.780> much<00:04:20.959> as<00:04:21.139> long<00:04:21.169> as<00:04:21.500> anyone's<00:04:21.829> been

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:22.010 
for pretty much as long as anyone's been

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:24.070 
for pretty much as long as anyone's been
making<00:04:22.370> commercial<00:04:22.789> grade<00:04:22.940> blocks<00:04:23.270> so<00:04:23.900> the

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.080 
making commercial grade blocks so the

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.460 
making commercial grade blocks so the
design<00:04:24.410> is<00:04:24.680> very<00:04:25.010> simple<00:04:25.610> but<00:04:26.030> very<00:04:26.090> effective

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470 
design is very simple but very effective

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:31.120 
design is very simple but very effective
so<00:04:27.470> now<00:04:27.860> with<00:04:28.039> a<00:04:28.070> single<00:04:28.550> GPU<00:04:29.030> card<00:04:29.800> the<00:04:30.800> design

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.130 
so now with a single GPU card the design

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:31.999 
so now with a single GPU card the design
of<00:04:31.370> a<00:04:31.640> full

00:04:31.999 --> 00:04:32.009 
of a full

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:34.760 
of a full
blog<00:04:32.400> is<00:04:32.610> fairly<00:04:32.999> simple<00:04:33.300> it<00:04:33.779> needs<00:04:34.169> to<00:04:34.379> get<00:04:34.559> a

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:34.770 
blog is fairly simple it needs to get a

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:38.450 
blog is fairly simple it needs to get a
little<00:04:35.219> bit<00:04:35.369> of<00:04:35.580> a<00:04:35.909> water<00:04:36.569> flow<00:04:36.930> over<00:04:37.919> the<00:04:37.949> vrm

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 
little bit of a water flow over the vrm

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:39.829 
little bit of a water flow over the vrm
components<00:04:39.029> which<00:04:39.119> are<00:04:39.240> generally<00:04:39.539> at<00:04:39.749> the

00:04:39.829 --> 00:04:39.839 
components which are generally at the

00:04:39.839 --> 00:04:41.480 
components which are generally at the
back<00:04:39.990> of<00:04:40.020> the<00:04:40.229> card<00:04:40.439> it's<00:04:40.919> a<00:04:41.009> little<00:04:41.099> bit<00:04:41.249> you

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
back of the card it's a little bit you

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.089 
back of the card it's a little bit you
know<00:04:41.520> not<00:04:41.789> not<00:04:42.389> a<00:04:42.449> huge<00:04:42.689> deal<00:04:42.899> you<00:04:43.830> go<00:04:44.009> away

00:04:44.089 --> 00:04:44.099 
know not not a huge deal you go away

00:04:44.099 --> 00:04:46.579 
know not not a huge deal you go away
thank<00:04:44.759> you<00:04:44.899> so<00:04:45.899> a<00:04:45.930> little<00:04:46.080> bit<00:04:46.229> of<00:04:46.289> pooling

00:04:46.579 --> 00:04:46.589 
thank you so a little bit of pooling

00:04:46.589 --> 00:04:48.559 
thank you so a little bit of pooling
there<00:04:46.889> because<00:04:47.460> those<00:04:47.639> components<00:04:47.999> do<00:04:48.389> get

00:04:48.559 --> 00:04:48.569 
there because those components do get

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:49.939 
there because those components do get
hot<00:04:48.749> under<00:04:48.779> air<00:04:49.110> cooling<00:04:49.379> going<00:04:49.649> to<00:04:49.740> water

00:04:49.939 --> 00:04:49.949 
hot under air cooling going to water

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:52.219 
hot under air cooling going to water
cooling<00:04:50.369> so<00:04:51.119> it's<00:04:51.360> a<00:04:51.449> breeze<00:04:51.689> it's<00:04:51.899> no<00:04:52.020> big

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:52.229 
cooling so it's a breeze it's no big

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:54.409 
cooling so it's a breeze it's no big
deal<00:04:52.259> and<00:04:52.649> then<00:04:53.219> they<00:04:53.580> need<00:04:53.759> to<00:04:53.969> route<00:04:54.389> the

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:54.419 
deal and then they need to route the

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:56.480 
deal and then they need to route the
water<00:04:54.779> around<00:04:55.499> to<00:04:55.680> the<00:04:55.800> center<00:04:55.949> of<00:04:56.129> the<00:04:56.249> card

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:56.490 
water around to the center of the card

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:58.369 
water around to the center of the card
and<00:04:56.639> then<00:04:56.969> i'll<00:04:57.089> be<00:04:57.300> out<00:04:57.539> the<00:04:57.749> outlet<00:04:58.050> so<00:04:58.229> in

00:04:58.369 --> 00:04:58.379 
and then i'll be out the outlet so in

00:04:58.379 --> 00:05:00.529 
and then i'll be out the outlet so in
the<00:04:58.529> inlet<00:04:59.099> around<00:04:59.969> to<00:05:00.059> the<00:05:00.180> center<00:05:00.300> of<00:05:00.449> the

00:05:00.529 --> 00:05:00.539 
the inlet around to the center of the

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:02.239 
the inlet around to the center of the
card<00:05:00.749> where<00:05:00.960> the<00:05:01.080> GPU<00:05:01.439> is<00:05:01.469> located<00:05:02.009> and<00:05:02.159> then

00:05:02.239 --> 00:05:02.249 
card where the GPU is located and then

00:05:02.249 --> 00:05:04.219 
card where the GPU is located and then
out<00:05:02.369> the<00:05:02.550> elder<00:05:02.789> now<00:05:03.089> with<00:05:03.389> a<00:05:03.419> dual<00:05:03.629> GPU<00:05:04.050> card

00:05:04.219 --> 00:05:04.229 
out the elder now with a dual GPU card

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:05.779 
out the elder now with a dual GPU card
it's<00:05:04.439> a<00:05:04.469> little<00:05:04.649> bit<00:05:04.740> more<00:05:04.860> complicated<00:05:05.159> so

00:05:05.779 --> 00:05:05.789 
it's a little bit more complicated so

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:07.610 
it's a little bit more complicated so
the<00:05:05.909> water<00:05:06.120> path<00:05:06.419> in<00:05:06.659> this<00:05:06.779> particular<00:05:06.990> block

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:07.620 
the water path in this particular block

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:09.799 
the water path in this particular block
goes<00:05:08.249> in<00:05:08.610> one<00:05:08.879> and<00:05:09.149> it<00:05:09.270> doesn't<00:05:09.509> really<00:05:09.599> matter

00:05:09.799 --> 00:05:09.809 
goes in one and it doesn't really matter

00:05:09.809 --> 00:05:12.980 
goes in one and it doesn't really matter
which<00:05:10.050> in<00:05:10.409> one<00:05:10.919> goes<00:05:11.759> through<00:05:11.789> a<00:05:12.089> pin<00:05:12.509> matrix

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:12.990 
which in one goes through a pin matrix

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:15.320 
which in one goes through a pin matrix
of<00:05:13.110> very<00:05:13.409> tight<00:05:13.770> pin<00:05:14.039> matrix<00:05:14.460> here<00:05:14.729> which<00:05:15.180> is

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:15.330 
of very tight pin matrix here which is

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:18.110 
of very tight pin matrix here which is
around<00:05:15.539> one<00:05:15.809> of<00:05:15.839> the<00:05:16.050> GPUs<00:05:16.939> okay<00:05:17.939> which

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120 
around one of the GPUs okay which

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:21.649 
around one of the GPUs okay which
actually<00:05:18.360> has<00:05:18.749> a<00:05:19.460> like<00:05:20.460> a<00:05:20.490> blocker<00:05:20.969> on<00:05:21.330> the

00:05:21.649 --> 00:05:21.659 
actually has a like a blocker on the

00:05:21.659 --> 00:05:24.290 
actually has a like a blocker on the
delrin<00:05:22.020> top<00:05:22.259> in<00:05:22.499> order<00:05:23.189> to<00:05:23.219> accelerate<00:05:23.969> the

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:24.300 
delrin top in order to accelerate the

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:26.329 
delrin top in order to accelerate the
water<00:05:24.479> as<00:05:24.689> it<00:05:24.839> flows<00:05:25.080> around<00:05:25.229> the<00:05:25.439> GPU<00:05:25.889> itself

00:05:26.329 --> 00:05:26.339 
water as it flows around the GPU itself

00:05:26.339 --> 00:05:28.969 
water as it flows around the GPU itself
then<00:05:26.969> it<00:05:27.300> widens<00:05:27.870> out<00:05:27.990> again<00:05:28.289> okay<00:05:28.709> so<00:05:28.770> it

00:05:28.969 --> 00:05:28.979 
then it widens out again okay so it

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:31.549 
then it widens out again okay so it
flows<00:05:29.219> quite<00:05:29.459> easily<00:05:29.669> here<00:05:30.059> and<00:05:30.209> then<00:05:30.899> it<00:05:31.199> goes

00:05:31.549 --> 00:05:31.559 
flows quite easily here and then it goes

00:05:31.559 --> 00:05:34.699 
flows quite easily here and then it goes
under<00:05:31.889> another<00:05:32.399> another<00:05:32.999> tight<00:05:33.529> a<00:05:34.529> tight

00:05:34.699 --> 00:05:34.709 
under another another tight a tight

00:05:34.709 --> 00:05:36.829 
under another another tight a tight
covering<00:05:35.490> from<00:05:35.699> the<00:05:35.819> top<00:05:36.029> through<00:05:36.509> another

00:05:36.829 --> 00:05:36.839 
covering from the top through another

why<00:05:39.089> does<00:05:39.240> swiftech<00:05:39.599> do<00:05:39.779> this<00:05:39.990> the<00:05:40.709> reason<00:05:40.919> is

00:05:41.269 --> 00:05:41.279 
why does swiftech do this the reason is

00:05:41.279 --> 00:05:43.219 
why does swiftech do this the reason is
that<00:05:41.309> cooling<00:05:41.969> performance<00:05:42.180> is<00:05:42.659> dramatically

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:43.229 
that cooling performance is dramatically

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:45.829 
that cooling performance is dramatically
better<00:05:43.469> when<00:05:43.889> you<00:05:44.129> restrict<00:05:44.849> the<00:05:45.389> flow<00:05:45.509> of<00:05:45.629> the

00:05:45.829 --> 00:05:45.839 
better when you restrict the flow of the

00:05:45.839 --> 00:05:48.290 
better when you restrict the flow of the
water<00:05:45.870> so<00:05:46.319> it<00:05:46.409> flows<00:05:46.680> faster<00:05:47.279> over<00:05:47.909> the<00:05:48.059> parts

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:48.300 
water so it flows faster over the parts

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:50.420 
water so it flows faster over the parts
that<00:05:48.389> need<00:05:48.629> to<00:05:48.749> be<00:05:48.779> cooled<00:05:49.110> the<00:05:49.289> most<00:05:49.529> so<00:05:50.279> why

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:50.430 
that need to be cooled the most so why

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:51.529 
that need to be cooled the most so why
don't<00:05:50.580> they<00:05:50.669> do<00:05:50.759> it<00:05:50.879> throughout<00:05:51.059> the<00:05:51.149> entire

00:05:51.529 --> 00:05:51.539 
don't they do it throughout the entire

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:53.719 
don't they do it throughout the entire
block<00:05:51.839> well<00:05:52.229> that's<00:05:52.559> a<00:05:52.709> smart<00:05:52.949> design<00:05:53.279> design

00:05:53.719 --> 00:05:53.729 
block well that's a smart design design

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:56.299 
block well that's a smart design design
decision<00:05:54.180> as<00:05:54.330> well<00:05:54.509> what<00:05:55.229> that<00:05:55.439> would<00:05:55.830> mean<00:05:55.860> if

00:05:56.299 --> 00:05:56.309 
decision as well what that would mean if

00:05:56.309 --> 00:05:58.399 
decision as well what that would mean if
they<00:05:56.459> had<00:05:56.639> the<00:05:56.789> entire<00:05:57.240> block<00:05:57.629> restrictive

00:05:58.399 --> 00:05:58.409 
they had the entire block restrictive

00:05:58.409 --> 00:06:00.499 
they had the entire block restrictive
and<00:05:58.589> impinging<00:05:59.129> and<00:05:59.279> jetting<00:05:59.939> the<00:06:00.029> water<00:06:00.240> onto

00:06:03.559 --> 00:06:03.569 
the surface of the water block to cool

00:06:03.569 --> 00:06:05.299 
the surface of the water block to cool
the<00:06:03.689> card<00:06:03.959> would<00:06:04.409> make<00:06:04.589> this<00:06:04.709> block<00:06:04.979> very

00:06:05.299 --> 00:06:05.309 
the card would make this block very

00:06:05.309 --> 00:06:07.100 
the card would make this block very
restrictive<00:06:05.999> so<00:06:06.180> it<00:06:06.300> mean<00:06:06.479> in<00:06:06.629> order<00:06:06.719> to<00:06:06.930> run<00:06:07.080> a

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:07.110 
restrictive so it mean in order to run a

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:09.019 
restrictive so it mean in order to run a
couple<00:06:07.349> of<00:06:07.529> these<00:06:07.620> blocks<00:06:07.979> with<00:06:08.519> dual<00:06:08.729> five

00:06:09.019 --> 00:06:09.029 
couple of these blocks with dual five

00:06:09.029 --> 00:06:11.239 
couple of these blocks with dual five
90s<00:06:09.509> in<00:06:09.659> a<00:06:09.749> loop<00:06:09.990> you<00:06:10.559> would<00:06:10.769> need<00:06:10.949> like<00:06:11.009> a

00:06:11.239 --> 00:06:11.249 
90s in a loop you would need like a

00:06:11.249 --> 00:06:13.100 
90s in a loop you would need like a
couple<00:06:11.729> pumps<00:06:12.180> in<00:06:12.300> order<00:06:12.479> to<00:06:12.599> just<00:06:12.779> get<00:06:12.990> the

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:13.110 
couple pumps in order to just get the

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:14.949 
couple pumps in order to just get the
water<00:06:13.289> through<00:06:13.649> there<00:06:13.830> at<00:06:14.009> a<00:06:14.249> reasonable

00:06:14.949 --> 00:06:14.959 
water through there at a reasonable

00:06:14.959 --> 00:06:19.219 
water through there at a reasonable
velocity<00:06:16.999> last<00:06:17.999> but<00:06:18.209> not<00:06:18.240> least<00:06:18.389> we've<00:06:19.019> also

00:06:19.219 --> 00:06:19.229 
velocity last but not least we've also

00:06:19.229 --> 00:06:21.709 
velocity last but not least we've also
got<00:06:19.589> a<00:06:19.800> glowing<00:06:20.249> EVGA<00:06:20.729> logo<00:06:21.180> up<00:06:21.330> here<00:06:21.539> at<00:06:21.659> the

00:06:21.709 --> 00:06:21.719 
got a glowing EVGA logo up here at the

00:06:21.719 --> 00:06:23.119 
got a glowing EVGA logo up here at the
top<00:06:21.809> so<00:06:22.169> that's<00:06:22.319> going<00:06:22.529> to<00:06:22.589> look<00:06:22.709> pretty<00:06:22.769> good

00:06:23.119 --> 00:06:23.129 
top so that's going to look pretty good

00:06:23.129 --> 00:06:24.799

machine which I will be building over
the<00:06:26.879> next<00:06:27.120> little<00:06:27.180> while<00:06:27.389> and<00:06:27.779> that<00:06:28.409> is<00:06:28.680> lit<00:06:29.309> up

00:06:29.329 --> 00:06:29.339 
the next little while and that is lit up

00:06:29.339 --> 00:06:32.360 
the next little while and that is lit up
by<00:06:29.699> using<00:06:29.909> the<00:06:30.269> fan<00:06:30.599> header<00:06:30.870> on<00:06:31.110> the<00:06:31.860> PCB

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:32.370 
by using the fan header on the PCB

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:34.309 
by using the fan header on the PCB
itself<00:06:32.849> so<00:06:32.999> we<00:06:33.089> got<00:06:33.240> a<00:06:33.269> little<00:06:33.479> cord<00:06:33.839> there<00:06:34.139> I

00:06:34.309 --> 00:06:34.319 
itself so we got a little cord there I

00:06:34.319 --> 00:06:35.959 
itself so we got a little cord there I
don't<00:06:35.069> know<00:06:35.249> if<00:06:35.370> I<00:06:35.430> mentioned<00:06:35.490> this<00:06:35.819> already

00:06:35.959 --> 00:06:35.969 
don't know if I mentioned this already
