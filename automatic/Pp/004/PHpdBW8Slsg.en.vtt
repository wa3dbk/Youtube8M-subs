00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:34.540
 at the moment I'm in the table what 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:37.650
 first thing I think is that I'm crazy 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.650
 what do I do here 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:46.050
 if I'm here for a reason because I 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:46.050
 here I am for myself 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:53.100
 my name leave on cotton I'm an athlete 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:57.370
 Venezuelan cyclist practiced this 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:01:01.469
 sport since 2009 enter it 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.469
 by chance in life 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.240
 and my brother is in a race 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.729
 belts and be his first race in 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.310
 that moment had finished everything and I 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.670
 He said why he did not lie because there was not 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.670
 tried 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:23.570
 a track bicycle 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:34.470
 I never thought it would be so difficult to follow 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.120
 those jumps the sports that I said 'god 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.640
 it takes a lot of 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:41.640
 resistance of a lot of training 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.260
 much strength in the pedaling that was 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.090
 difficult was not nothing was not phases had 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:47.330
 his technique like all sports you have another 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.330
 same 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.920
 first regional competition was after 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:59.280
 that he had two weeks running in 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.820
 this race wins the first sleeves and 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.710
 everyone was surprised 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.270
 it's just beginning afterwards cumshots 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.430
 nationals and nationals nobody thought 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.100
 that the approach would be able to get me into 

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:14.490
 the final since it was something already bigger 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:17.780
 then to the end I decided that 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:17.780
 It was going to be my passion 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.859
 I go 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.859
 finish 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.989
 uy 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.410
 and it's what you like about your passion, not you 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:36.410
 it's going to cost 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:52.980
 I started with my coach the worst was the 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.650
 coach was at the time the 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.269
 high performance coach 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:00.900
 carabobo and we started to accelerate all 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:04.970
 the days at all times and I was polishing and 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.970
 I was growing as an athlete 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:24.370
 for me the Olympians is a dream 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:26.540
 but in an impossible dream since I think 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:29.360
 that nothing is impossible 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:35.540
 and we overlook if we have been training 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:41.450
 a lot of sacrifice effort but it's a 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:43.790
 goal promise where I see myself every night in 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:46.489
 this match is imputable on this track 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:47.590
 achieving your dreams that will already be telling 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:49.750
 there 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:53.500
 very big step since the Olympic home 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:55.480
 for any athlete is the most 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:58.060
 is the biggest dream of the highest average that 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:00.989
 has the athlete for me is 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.989
 the biggest mistake 

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:21.570
 my dad are always supporting me always 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:25.140
 always in peace there is not a race in 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:26.370
 what I have not been in any 

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:27.720
 moment without it will start the race 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:30.680
 I think they always have to 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.680
 be in that moment 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:38.540
 and dad are always aware of how 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:40.880
 is the bicycle the track is behind 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:44.180
 of me supporting me and no more always and with 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:47.360
 the psychological part tells me it sounds better 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:49.099
 I want you to win 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.990
 your body is prepared our 

00:04:49.099 --> 00:04:53.449
 ordering your body that has to win 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:56.090
 that you are the best and to answer you 

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:57.889
 much better is going to take bigger steps 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:02.770
 to develop within you a 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:02.770
 very large potential and will give more 

00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:08.020
 they support me a lot and I have to 

00:05:05.529 --> 00:05:10.119

 feel proud of me and always be 

00:05:13.119 --> 00:05:15.809

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:23.759
