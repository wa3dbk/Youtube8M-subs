the grapefruit so in that case you won't

have to peel those elements now a lot of

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.700 
have to peel those elements now a lot of
people<00:00:51.210> tell<00:00:51.539> me<00:00:51.570> not<00:00:51.809> for<00:00:52.110> me<00:00:52.199> that's<00:00:52.469> going

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
people tell me not for me that's going

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:53.930 
people tell me not for me that's going
to<00:00:52.770> be<00:00:52.860> enough<00:00:52.949> but<00:00:53.370> then<00:00:53.579> when<00:00:53.760> I<00:00:53.789> actually

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
to be enough but then when I actually

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.510 
to be enough but then when I actually
start<00:00:54.360> juicing<00:00:54.780> and<00:00:54.899> they<00:00:55.020> realized<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:56.280> work

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
start juicing and they realized the work

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.330 
start juicing and they realized the work
that<00:00:56.789> is<00:00:56.910> involving<00:00:57.420> that<00:00:57.629> they<00:00:58.469> either<00:00:58.859> stop

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
that is involving that they either stop

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.299 
that is involving that they either stop
using<00:00:59.640> or<00:01:00.059> in<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:01.109> best<00:01:01.559> case<00:01:01.739> they<00:01:01.980> go<00:01:02.190> and

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
using or in the best case they go and

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.280 
using or in the best case they go and
get<00:01:02.520> a<00:01:02.760> citrus<00:01:03.420> press<00:01:03.690> which<00:01:03.989> would<00:01:04.170> make

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
get a citrus press which would make

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.380 
get a citrus press which would make
their<00:01:04.470> life<00:01:04.619> easier<00:01:04.830> but<00:01:05.489> it<00:01:05.700> stopped<00:01:05.909> juicing

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
their life easier but it stopped juicing

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.820 
their life easier but it stopped juicing
so<00:01:06.810> I<00:01:06.840> don't<00:01:07.080> want<00:01:07.229> to<00:01:07.290> see<00:01:07.439> you<00:01:07.590> in<00:01:07.619> that

you know itself demonstrating I did a

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.520 
you know itself demonstrating I did a
lot<00:01:12.150> of<00:01:12.210> demonstration<00:01:12.750> about<00:01:12.869> like<00:01:13.170> how<00:01:13.470> the

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
lot of demonstration about like how the

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.830 
lot of demonstration about like how the
citrus<00:01:13.979> press<00:01:14.220> work<00:01:14.490> can<00:01:14.790> have<00:01:14.909> grandees<00:01:15.390> but

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840

citrus fruits with a regular juicer
rather<00:01:32.369> than<00:01:32.520> a<00:01:32.640> solution<00:01:33.119> so<00:01:33.240> you<00:01:33.360> would<00:01:33.509> see

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
rather than a solution so you would see

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.539 
rather than a solution so you would see
all<00:01:33.720> the<00:01:34.049> prep<00:01:34.290> work<00:01:34.320> that<00:01:34.710> is<00:01:34.799> involved<00:01:34.829> let's

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
this mean and this is going to take me a

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.149 
this mean and this is going to take me a
bit<00:01:42.509> of<00:01:42.659> time<00:01:42.869> even<00:01:43.200> though<00:01:43.320> I'm<00:01:43.409> very<00:01:43.680> skilled

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
bit of time even though I'm very skilled

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.719 
bit of time even though I'm very skilled
in<00:01:44.790> doing<00:01:45.240> it<00:01:45.590> it's<00:01:46.590> still<00:01:46.939> for<00:01:47.939> many<00:01:48.149> people

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 
in doing it it's still for many people

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:52.219 
in doing it it's still for many people
might<00:01:50.729> be<00:01:50.939> a<00:01:50.970> bit<00:01:51.210> of<00:01:51.329> an<00:01:51.450> effort<00:01:51.630> rather<00:01:51.960> than

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
might be a bit of an effort rather than

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.950 
might be a bit of an effort rather than
simply<00:01:52.700> slicing<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:54.030> lemon<00:01:54.360> in<00:01:54.450> half<00:01:54.659> and

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
simply slicing the lemon in half and

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.539 
simply slicing the lemon in half and
putting<00:01:55.320> it<00:01:55.439> into<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.770> citrus<00:01:56.100> press<00:01:56.340> and

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
putting it into the citrus press and

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.830 
putting it into the citrus press and
pressing<00:01:56.939> which<00:01:57.630> is<00:01:57.840> I<00:01:59.060> admit<00:02:00.060> much<00:02:00.360> easier

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
pressing which is I admit much easier

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.219 
pressing which is I admit much easier
work<00:02:01.110> much<00:02:02.070> easier<00:02:02.100> setup<00:02:02.729> but<00:02:03.600> you<00:02:03.869> know<00:02:04.049> for

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
work much easier setup but you know for

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.469 
work much easier setup but you know for
me<00:02:04.500> I'm<00:02:04.829> used<00:02:05.250> to<00:02:05.399> doing<00:02:05.549> that<00:02:05.850> and<00:02:06.149> it's<00:02:06.299> not<00:02:06.450> a

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479

basically a grapefruit and orange then

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:06.970 
basically a grapefruit and orange then
we'll<00:03:05.750> need<00:03:05.870> I<00:03:06.080> love<00:03:06.320> this<00:03:06.440> language<00:03:06.830> it's

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
we'll need I love this language it's

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:08.410 
we'll need I love this language it's
really<00:03:07.190> refreshing<00:03:07.340> and<00:03:07.880> it's<00:03:08.000> really<00:03:08.209> great

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
really refreshing and it's really great

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.240 
really refreshing and it's really great
also<00:03:09.170> another<00:03:09.350> thing<00:03:09.500> that<00:03:09.739> you<00:03:09.770> see<00:03:10.040> here

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
also another thing that you see here

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.660 
also another thing that you see here
look<00:03:11.060> at<00:03:11.209> how<00:03:11.330> much<00:03:11.630> garbage<00:03:12.560> this<00:03:13.040> generates

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
look at how much garbage this generates

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.120 
look at how much garbage this generates
versus<00:03:14.209> if<00:03:14.540> you<00:03:14.810> cut<00:03:15.019> it<00:03:15.170> in<00:03:15.290> half<00:03:15.320> which<00:03:15.890> would

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
versus if you cut it in half which would

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:19.120 
versus if you cut it in half which would
be<00:03:16.330> simply<00:03:17.330> whatever<00:03:18.080> left<00:03:18.410> you<00:03:18.650> know<00:03:18.769> over

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 
be simply whatever left you know over

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.280 
be simply whatever left you know over
that's<00:03:19.340> all<00:03:19.660> again<00:03:20.660> really<00:03:20.750> great<00:03:21.049> from<00:03:21.230> what

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
that's all again really great from what

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.830 
that's all again really great from what
I<00:03:21.410> may<00:03:21.500> get<00:03:21.620> cut<00:03:21.799> at<00:03:21.920> the<00:03:21.980> top<00:03:22.160> here<00:03:22.720> just<00:03:23.720> until

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
I may get cut at the top here just until

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.289 
I may get cut at the top here just until
you<00:03:24.019> reveal<00:03:24.350> the<00:03:24.410> flesh<00:03:24.769> of<00:03:24.890> their<00:03:25.130> the<00:03:26.030> great

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:26.299

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
to require a few cuts and then another

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:37.630 
to require a few cuts and then another
