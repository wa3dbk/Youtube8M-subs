00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:11.170 
that 200 millimeter fan with a red LED
200<00:02:06.689> middle<00:02:07.310> but<00:02:08.899> that's<00:02:09.899> about<00:02:10.170> it<00:02:10.229> I<00:02:10.649> mean

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
200 middle but that's about it I mean

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.730 
200 middle but that's about it I mean
you<00:02:12.180> want<00:02:12.330> to<00:02:12.420> look<00:02:12.480> at<00:02:12.569> aspects

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
you want to look at aspects

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:20.420 
you want to look at aspects

of eight gigs of ram radeon HD 6870 it's

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.180 
of eight gigs of ram radeon HD 6870 it's
only<00:02:20.670> one<00:02:20.880> gig<00:02:21.180> it's<00:02:21.810> 900<00:02:22.380> megahertz<00:02:22.650> clock

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
only one gig it's 900 megahertz clock

heatsink I was getting between 45 to 60
degrees<00:02:38.700> Celsius<00:02:39.600> and<00:02:40.190> then<00:02:41.190> by<00:02:41.730> replacing<00:02:42.480> it

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
degrees Celsius and then by replacing it

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.600 
degrees Celsius and then by replacing it
with<00:02:42.900> the<00:02:43.110> new<00:02:43.290> heatsink<00:02:43.500> I'm<00:02:44.100> getting<00:02:44.370> around

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
with the new heatsink I'm getting around

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.120 
with the new heatsink I'm getting around
lesson<00:02:47.610> 30<00:02:47.940> cuz<00:02:48.930> I've<00:02:49.050> gone<00:02:49.350> down<00:02:49.650> to<00:02:49.860> all<00:02:50.010> the

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
way down to 5 degrees Celsius which is a

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.400 
way down to 5 degrees Celsius which is a
huge<00:02:56.100> difference<00:02:56.510> I'm<00:02:57.510> really<00:02:57.720> happy<00:02:57.990> with

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
huge difference I'm really happy with
