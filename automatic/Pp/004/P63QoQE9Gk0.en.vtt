00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.900
 one of the most frequent questions that 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.490
 come to our mail is how many 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.219
 speakers can be connected to a 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.890
 amplifier and even when it seems easy 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.450
 the answer is complex 

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:20.130
 let's try to help you to make yourself 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:22.410
 answer that question but of a 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.359
 informed way and for that first 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.780
 let's explain some concepts 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.790
 basic 

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:30.070
 remember that some of the concepts 

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:33.330
 here explains two have been simplified 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.330
 for a better understanding 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.870
 surely you have heard that the 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.970
 Resistance of the horns is measured in 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.980
 nose but unlike a 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:51.010
 pure resistance that is also measured in 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:53.480
 homs when it comes to speakers we talk 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.579
 of its impedance 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.410
 the impedance is the resistance 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:59.900
 electric to the passage of a current 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:02.300
 alternate for practical purposes 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.980
 let's treat the impedance with a 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.710
 pure resistance in the following 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:09.680
 examples but remember that the impedance 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:12.320
 this is a function of the frequency this 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.330
 means that the resistance to the passage of 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.400
 an alternating current changes according to 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:19.610
 to the frequency of that alternating current 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:22.850
 the higher the frequency, the greater the impedance or 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.710
 resistance is precisely why this 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.470
 when the free end user with a 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:30.680
 meter or a multimeter a speaker of your 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:33.140
 terminals can have readings from 5 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:36.320
 or more than 8 years for a horn that the 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:38.410
 specific manufacturer like eight outs 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.700
 this because I subway me 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:43.310
 pure resistances by applying a 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.530
 direct current and the impedance is 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:48.020
 a resistance to an alternating current 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:50.300
 to exemplify the best 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.610
 Did you know that a 8 or more speaker can 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:55.280
 have an impedance of more than 30 to about 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.170
 for the higher frequencies remember 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.180
 the importance of always being in 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.770
 frequency function 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:04.180
 and it can be an impedance graph 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:04.180
 versus frequencies 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.090
 if you want to check the law of ohm the 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:10.850
 You can see in our video that it's about 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.830
 what is electricity and basically we 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:15.110
 says how to calculate the value of a 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:18.080
 resistance when it is connected in series 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.850
 or parallel to calculate the resistance 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.820
 is in series we only add the 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:26.110
 values 2 horns of 8 or more give as 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:28.790
 result 16 shows and so on 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:31.400
 for the resistors in parallel the 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:34.100
 formula is expressed as the reciprocal of 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.170
 the sum of the reciprocals for a 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.970
 quick calculation we can say that when 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.430
 it's about speakers with the same 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:42.980
 impedance every time we double the 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:45.739
 number of speakers total resistance 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:48.230
 low to half the value for example 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:51.200
 a horn of 8 or more 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:54.830
 Its value is 8 but two horns of 8 or more 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:57.080
 in parallel its value stays at 4 or more and 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:59.980
 for four horns of 8 ams its value 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:02.409
 it remains in two shops 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.150
 The amplifiers are designed to 

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:06.459
 provide a voltage in their 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:09.129
 output connections to where they connect 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:11.440
 the speakers this message is the one that's going to 

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:14.080
 produce work in this case the 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:16.360
 sound reproduced by the speakers and in 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.430
 each case there is a maximum current 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:21.129
 that the amplifier can provide 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:23.290
 in a safe way depending on the 

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:26.530
 manufacturer and application 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:28.750
 amplifiers can work to 84 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.599
 idelphonse of minimum impedance in its 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.730
 exits this means that on your departure 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:35.980
 a maximum of speakers can be connected 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:39.100
 that depends on how much current you can 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:41.740
 provide maximum 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:43.300
 the minimum impedance is the minimum value 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:46.510
 of the load at the output of a 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:48.370
 amplifier the load is represented 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:50.680
 by the current that the speakers demand 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.630
 connected to the amplifier and the 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:55.090
 current demand is based on the 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:58.150
 impedance of the speakers expressed in 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:00.190
 the following formula of equal bird to 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:03.460
 square on r 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:05.800
 let's see a practical example let's consider 

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:07.990
 that an amplifier that provides 50 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:10.720
 bag in its outlet and that connects to 

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:12.400
 an 8-year horn the formula for 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:16.209
 calculate the required power to 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:19.510
 amplifier in this case is p equal to 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:23.590
 50 for 50 out of 8 and it will give us a 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:25.360
 result of 312 watts now let's think about 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:28.060
 the same amplifier but with two 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:30.940
 811 horns in parallel connected to 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:33.490
 your exit first we need to know your 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:35.230
 resistive value and with the fast rule 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:38.470
 we know that by doubling the number of 

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:41.920
 horns from 1 to 2 we get the value 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:43.630
 resistive from 8 to 4 is the value 

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:46.140
 resulting from the impedance of the two 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:50.110
 speakers in parallel is 42 

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:54.850
 now let's apply the formula of equal ab 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:58.080
 squared over 50 by 50 over 4 and 

00:04:54.850 --> 00:05:01.240
 the power value will be 625 watts 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:04.710
 as we can see the amplifier is 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.710
 now requires twice as much power 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:09.220
 it is for this reason that if we connect more 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:11.470
 speakers from which an amplifier can 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:13.870
 handle as minimum impedance will be damaged 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:16.510
 since he can not deliver the amount of 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:19.240
 power that the speakers demand in this 

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:21.160
 case we can see that less is more to 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:24.070
 lower impedance higher demand the 

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:26.620
 amplifier or in plain words to more 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:28.470
 connected speakers more power required 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:30.720
 to the amplifier 

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:32.700
 you will wonder then how many 

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:35.490
 speakers I can connect amplifier 

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:36.990
 as we saw earlier it depends on the 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:39.180
 minimum work impedance of 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:41.700
 amplifier and this depends on the 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:43.590
 equipment manufacturer verify this 

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:45.390
 value almost always printed on the panel 

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:47.910
 where are the connection terminals 

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:50.100
 of the amplifier and never work with 

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:51.720
 less impedance than the recommended one already 

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:54.990
 you can damage your tool 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:57.240
