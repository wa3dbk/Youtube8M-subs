in this video we're gonna take a look at

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:04.940 
in this video we're gonna take a look at
the<00:00:01.829> velocity<00:00:02.190> micro<00:00:02.850> cruise<00:00:03.500> so<00:00:04.500> this<00:00:04.740> is<00:00:04.830> the

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950 
the velocity micro cruise so this is the

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.140 
the velocity micro cruise so this is the
t<00:00:05.160> 103<00:00:06.000> tablet<00:00:06.480> the<00:00:07.290> T<00:00:07.470> 101<00:00:07.890> and<00:00:08.069> 102<00:00:08.309> are<00:00:09.030> also

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
t 103 tablet the T 101 and 102 are also

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.209 
t 103 tablet the T 101 and 102 are also
the<00:00:09.780> same<00:00:09.929> as<00:00:10.110> the<00:00:10.139> T<00:00:10.290> 103<00:00:10.679> here<00:00:10.860> I<00:00:10.889> think<00:00:11.130> they

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
the same as the T 103 here I think they

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.580 
the same as the T 103 here I think they
just<00:00:11.400> use<00:00:11.519> different<00:00:12.049> model<00:00:13.049> numbers<00:00:13.320> for

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
just use different model numbers for

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.330 
just use different model numbers for
different<00:00:14.309> marketing<00:00:14.759> purposes<00:00:15.650> this<00:00:16.650> is<00:00:16.800> a<00:00:16.830> 7

myself<00:01:16.700> if<00:01:17.700> you<00:01:17.820> compare<00:01:18.090> that<00:01:18.119> to<00:01:18.470> the

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
myself if you compare that to the

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.830 
myself if you compare that to the
Samsung<00:01:19.740> Galaxy<00:01:20.520> Tab<00:01:20.640> 7<00:01:21.090> plus<00:01:21.330> which<00:01:21.540> is<00:01:21.659> the

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
Samsung is about 12 ounces so you're

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.370 
Samsung is about 12 ounces so you're
looking<00:01:26.040> at<00:01:26.189> a<00:01:26.280> 6<00:01:26.580> ounce<00:01:26.729> difference<00:01:27.290> you<00:01:28.290> know

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
looking at a 6 ounce difference you know

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.410 
looking at a 6 ounce difference you know
roughly<00:01:28.680> a<00:01:28.740> third<00:01:28.979> of<00:01:29.070> a<00:01:29.159> pound<00:01:29.189> between<00:01:29.880> the

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
roughly a third of a pound between the

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.149 
roughly a third of a pound between the
second<00:01:30.750> aa<00:01:30.810> Mical<00:01:31.079> version<00:01:31.380> and<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.770> lightest

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
second aa Mical version and the lightest

second aa Mical version and the lightest
burst<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:32.970> Galaxy<00:01:33.390> at<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.810> top<00:01:33.990> end<00:01:34.229> so<00:01:35.570> let's

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
burst the Galaxy at the top end so let's

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.300 
burst the Galaxy at the top end so let's
take<00:01:36.720> a<00:01:36.750> look<00:01:36.869> at<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.140> instruction<00:01:37.860> there<00:01:38.159> the

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
take a look at the instruction there the

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.399 
take a look at the instruction there the
construction<00:01:38.850> I<00:01:38.909> should<00:01:39.060> say<00:01:39.210> it's<00:01:40.140> got<00:01:40.290> like

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
construction I should say it's got like

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.179 
construction I should say it's got like
a<00:01:41.240> plastic<00:01:42.649> textured<00:01:43.649> finish<00:01:43.920> on<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.100> back

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:35.460 
know the galaxy did that and so does the

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:37.600 
know the galaxy did that and so does the
HTC<00:06:36.460> EVO<00:06:36.730> so

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:37.610 
HTC EVO so

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:39.040 
HTC EVO so
those<00:06:37.970> don't<00:06:38.210> rotate<00:06:38.330> and<00:06:38.660> they're<00:06:38.750> not<00:06:38.870> lit

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:39.050 
those don't rotate and they're not lit

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:41.560 
those don't rotate and they're not lit
up<00:06:39.170> so<00:06:39.530> in<00:06:40.190> the<00:06:40.280> evenings<00:06:40.640> or<00:06:41.000> if<00:06:41.270> you're<00:06:41.450> in<00:06:41.540> a

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:41.570 
up so in the evenings or if you're in a

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:43.180 
up so in the evenings or if you're in a
dimly<00:06:41.960> lit<00:06:42.050> place<00:06:42.380> it's<00:06:42.620> kind<00:06:42.800> of<00:06:42.830> tough<00:06:43.070> to

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:43.190 
dimly lit place it's kind of tough to

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:45.790 
dimly lit place it's kind of tough to
even<00:06:43.280> find<00:06:43.580> those<00:06:43.790> and<00:06:44.000> now<00:06:44.060> so<00:06:44.360> don't<00:06:44.800> click

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:45.800 
even find those and now so don't click

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.400 
even find those and now so don't click
and<00:06:46.790> if<00:06:46.850> one<00:06:47.060> of<00:06:47.090> them<00:06:47.240> does<00:06:47.420> the<00:06:47.960> back<00:06:48.110> button

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:48.410 
and if one of them does the back button

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:50.890 
and if one of them does the back button
doesn't<00:06:48.710> the<00:06:48.800> home<00:06:48.950> button<00:06:49.220> doesn't<00:06:49.520> but<00:06:49.900> just

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:50.900 
doesn't the home button doesn't but just

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:53.040 
doesn't the home button doesn't but just
the<00:06:51.050> settings<00:06:51.380> and<00:06:51.710> I<00:06:51.800> don't<00:06:51.950> even<00:06:52.100> actually

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:53.050 
the settings and I don't even actually

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:54.970 
the settings and I don't even actually
another<00:06:54.050> time<00:06:54.230> it<00:06:54.380> lights<00:06:54.530> up<00:06:54.650> is<00:06:54.800> when<00:06:54.920> you

00:06:54.970 --> 00:06:54.980 
another time it lights up is when you

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:56.650 
another time it lights up is when you
hit<00:06:55.160> the<00:06:55.280> button<00:06:55.370> with<00:06:55.610> your<00:06:55.640> finger<00:06:56.480> which<00:06:56.630> is

00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:56.660 
hit the button with your finger which is

00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:58.750 
hit the button with your finger which is
kind<00:06:56.990> of<00:06:57.080> pointless<00:06:57.950> because<00:06:58.160> usually<00:06:58.670> your

00:06:58.750 --> 00:06:58.760 
kind of pointless because usually your

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:00.190 
kind of pointless because usually your
finger<00:06:58.970> is<00:06:59.030> going<00:06:59.150> to<00:06:59.180> be<00:06:59.240> on<00:06:59.420> top<00:06:59.630> of<00:06:59.660> it<00:06:59.930> so

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:00.200 
finger is going to be on top of it so

00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:02.920 
finger is going to be on top of it so
not<00:07:01.160> really<00:07:01.400> effective<00:07:01.790> but<00:07:01.970> does<00:07:02.660> allow<00:07:02.870> you

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:02.930 
not really effective but does allow you

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:05.560 
not really effective but does allow you
to<00:07:03.050> flip<00:07:03.230> the<00:07:03.350> screen<00:07:03.850> that<00:07:04.850> rotates<00:07:05.210> just

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:05.570 
to flip the screen that rotates just

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:09.610 
to flip the screen that rotates just
like<00:07:05.720> everything<00:07:06.080> else<00:07:06.170> out<00:07:07.160> there<00:07:08.560> it<00:07:09.560> is

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:09.620 
like everything else out there it is

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:11.760 
like everything else out there it is
responsive<00:07:10.250> you<00:07:10.340> do<00:07:10.400> you<00:07:10.460> have<00:07:10.610> your<00:07:10.640> multiple

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:11.770 
responsive you do you have your multiple

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:13.930 
responsive you do you have your multiple
desktops<00:07:12.770> you<00:07:12.950> can<00:07:13.130> rotate<00:07:13.610> through<00:07:13.820> either

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:13.940 
desktops you can rotate through either

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:16.530 
desktops you can rotate through either
by<00:07:14.210> swiping<00:07:14.650> or<00:07:15.650> by<00:07:15.770> clicking<00:07:15.830> the<00:07:16.130> little

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:16.540 
by swiping or by clicking the little

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:18.960 
by swiping or by clicking the little
buttons<00:07:17.540> on<00:07:17.750> the<00:07:17.870> corner<00:07:18.140> here<00:07:18.320> little<00:07:18.680> dots

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:18.970 
buttons on the corner here little dots

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:21.310 
buttons on the corner here little dots
so<00:07:19.970> overall<00:07:20.300> it's<00:07:20.570> for<00:07:20.780> a<00:07:20.810> hundred<00:07:21.050> bucks<00:07:21.200> you

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:21.320 
so overall it's for a hundred bucks you

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:24.370 
so overall it's for a hundred bucks you
really<00:07:21.710> can't<00:07:21.950> go<00:07:22.070> wrong<00:07:22.250> on<00:07:22.520> that<00:07:23.230> that<00:07:24.230> kind

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:24.380 
really can't go wrong on that that kind

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:25.240 
really can't go wrong on that that kind
of<00:07:24.410> price<00:07:24.590> when<00:07:24.740> you're<00:07:24.830> not<00:07:24.920> going<00:07:25.040> to<00:07:25.100> find
