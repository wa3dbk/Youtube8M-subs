wanted to show you a really basic
defensive<00:00:05.100> zone<00:00:05.250> coverage<00:00:05.490> set<00:00:05.700> up<00:00:05.790> called

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
defensive zone coverage set up called

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.059 
defensive zone coverage set up called
the<00:00:06.060> box<00:00:06.299> plus<00:00:06.600> one<00:00:06.839> now<00:00:07.410> you<00:00:07.470> may<00:00:07.859> or<00:00:07.950> may<00:00:08.010> not

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
the box plus one now you may or may not

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:09.740 
the box plus one now you may or may not
have<00:00:08.280> heard<00:00:08.370> of<00:00:08.460> the<00:00:08.550> box<00:00:08.700> plus<00:00:08.910> one<00:00:09.090> already

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
have heard of the box plus one already

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.230 
have heard of the box plus one already
it's<00:00:10.050> a<00:00:10.170> simple<00:00:10.620> straightforward<00:00:11.240> defensive

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
it's a simple straightforward defensive

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.759 
it's a simple straightforward defensive
zone<00:00:12.330> coverage<00:00:12.630> setup<00:00:12.990> but<00:00:13.469> one<00:00:13.620> of<00:00:13.650> the

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
zone coverage setup but one of the

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.890 
zone coverage setup but one of the
reasons<00:00:14.009> why<00:00:14.099> I<00:00:14.130> really<00:00:14.219> like<00:00:14.670> it<00:00:14.910> is<00:00:15.059> because

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
reasons why I really like it is because

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.349 
reasons why I really like it is because
it's<00:00:16.139> a<00:00:16.230> great<00:00:16.260> introductory<00:00:17.250> system<00:00:17.820> to

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
it's a great introductory system to

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.000 
it's a great introductory system to
young<00:00:18.510> players<00:00:18.690> so<00:00:19.350> players<00:00:19.680> that<00:00:19.830> aren't

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
young players so players that aren't

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.980 
young players so players that aren't
maybe<00:00:20.400> aren't<00:00:20.699> used<00:00:20.880> to<00:00:21.000> playing<00:00:21.090> complex

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
maybe aren't used to playing complex

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.019 
maybe aren't used to playing complex
systems<00:00:22.470> this<00:00:22.590> is<00:00:22.710> a<00:00:22.740> really<00:00:23.070> good<00:00:23.250> simple

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
systems this is a really good simple

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.550 
systems this is a really good simple
setup<00:00:24.330> that<00:00:24.480> they<00:00:24.570> can<00:00:24.750> use<00:00:24.960> to<00:00:25.170> kind<00:00:25.320> of<00:00:25.439> get

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
setup that they can use to kind of get

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.589 
setup that they can use to kind of get
their<00:00:25.680> feet<00:00:25.710> wet<00:00:26.010> with<00:00:26.039> the<00:00:26.310> systems<00:00:26.730> and<00:00:26.939> at

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
their feet wet with the systems and at

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.589 
their feet wet with the systems and at
the<00:00:27.689> same<00:00:27.900> time<00:00:28.170> it<00:00:28.949> can<00:00:29.220> be<00:00:29.519> modified<00:00:30.210> and

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
the same time it can be modified and

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.900 
the same time it can be modified and
progressed<00:00:31.019> into<00:00:31.349> more<00:00:32.009> complex<00:00:32.369> versions<00:00:32.820> of

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
progressed into more complex versions of

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.120 
progressed into more complex versions of
defensive<00:00:33.270> zone<00:00:33.360> coverage<00:00:33.630> setups<00:00:34.140> and<00:00:34.350> will

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
defensive zone coverage setups and will

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.350 
defensive zone coverage setups and will
show<00:00:35.280> you<00:00:35.340> how<00:00:35.460> to<00:00:35.489> do<00:00:35.670> that<00:00:35.790> in<00:00:35.969> another<00:00:36.059> video

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
show you how to do that in another video

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.860 
show you how to do that in another video
but<00:00:37.640> this<00:00:38.640> is<00:00:38.700> that<00:00:39.030> this<00:00:39.149> is<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.480> box<00:00:39.660> plus

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
but this is that this is the box plus

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.130 
but this is that this is the box plus
one<00:00:40.079> very<00:00:40.739> good<00:00:40.950> it's<00:00:41.129> a<00:00:41.219> passive<00:00:42.140> defense

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
one very good it's a passive defense

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.240 
one very good it's a passive defense
little<00:00:43.379> coverage<00:00:43.620> setup<00:00:43.980> so<00:00:44.610> it's<00:00:45.510> very<00:00:45.750> safe

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:46.250 
little coverage setup so it's very safe

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.380 
little coverage setup so it's very safe
but<00:00:47.250> at<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.460> same<00:00:47.579> time<00:00:47.789> like<00:00:47.940> I<00:00:48.059> said<00:00:48.090> before

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
but at the same time like I said before

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:49.819 
but at the same time like I said before
there's<00:00:48.719> some<00:00:48.870> modifications<00:00:49.469> you<00:00:49.680> can<00:00:49.710> make

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
there's some modifications you can make

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.529 
there's some modifications you can make
to<00:00:50.010> make<00:00:50.550> it<00:00:50.700> a<00:00:50.760> little<00:00:50.850> bit<00:00:51.030> more<00:00:51.180> aggressive

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
to make it a little bit more aggressive

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.420 
to make it a little bit more aggressive
so<00:00:52.079> let's<00:00:52.350> go<00:00:52.440> ahead<00:00:52.500> and<00:00:52.649> pull<00:00:53.039> up<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.160> rink

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
so let's go ahead and pull up the rink

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.100 
so let's go ahead and pull up the rink
and<00:00:53.640> I'll<00:00:54.270> show<00:00:54.449> you<00:00:54.510> what<00:00:54.629> we've<00:00:54.750> got<00:00:54.870> set<00:00:55.050> up

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
and I'll show you what we've got set up

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.889 
and I'll show you what we've got set up
here<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.530> X's<00:00:56.280> are<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.520> opposing<00:00:57.449> team<00:00:57.660> so

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
here the X's are the opposing team so

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.510 
here the X's are the opposing team so
those<00:00:58.050> are<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.350> players<00:00:58.649> on<00:00:58.859> offense<00:00:59.070> right

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
those are the players on offense right

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.389 
those are the players on offense right
now<00:00:59.670> and<00:01:00.020> obviously<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.410> circles<00:01:01.890> are<00:01:02.100> our

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
now and obviously the circles are our

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.759 
now and obviously the circles are our
own<00:01:02.579> team<00:01:02.850> and<00:01:03.470> different<00:01:04.470> teams<00:01:04.619> have

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
own team and different teams have

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.260 
own team and different teams have
different<00:01:04.920> setups<00:01:05.430> I<00:01:05.580> basically<00:01:05.880> just<00:01:05.970> put

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
different setups I basically just put

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.539 
different setups I basically just put
one<00:01:06.420> man<00:01:06.600> in<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:06.810> corner<00:01:07.080> here<00:01:07.549> another

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
one man in the corner here another

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.490 
one man in the corner here another
forward<00:01:09.000> here<00:01:09.240> on<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.780> boards<00:01:10.260> and<00:01:10.409> then

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
forward here on the boards and then

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.810 
forward here on the boards and then
we've<00:01:10.590> got<00:01:10.680> our<00:01:10.740> two<00:01:10.950> defenseman<00:01:11.430> and<00:01:11.549> one<00:01:11.700> guy

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
we've got our two defenseman and one guy

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:12.500 
we've got our two defenseman and one guy
in<00:01:11.880> front<00:01:12.060> of<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.210> net

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
in front of the net

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.539 
in front of the net
now<00:01:12.869> some<00:01:13.200> play<00:01:13.380> some<00:01:13.710> teams<00:01:13.920> will<00:01:14.130> maybe<00:01:14.280> move

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
now some play some teams will maybe move

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.060 
now some play some teams will maybe move
this<00:01:14.790> guy<00:01:15.000> over<00:01:15.030> for<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.720> net<00:01:15.900> try<00:01:16.320> to<00:01:16.380> get

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
this guy over for the net try to get

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.859 
this guy over for the net try to get
more<00:01:17.250> people<00:01:17.400> in<00:01:17.580> for<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.820> net<00:01:18.000> sometimes

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
more people in for the net sometimes

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.590 
more people in for the net sometimes
they'll<00:01:19.080> moving<00:01:19.350> down<00:01:19.500> behind<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.950> net<00:01:20.600> just

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
they'll moving down behind the net just

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.480 
they'll moving down behind the net just
depending<00:01:22.020> on<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.170> team<00:01:22.380> this<00:01:22.770> set<00:01:23.040> will

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
depending on the team this set will

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.249 
depending on the team this set will
probably<00:01:24.090> be<00:01:24.240> something<00:01:24.509> similar<00:01:24.930> to<00:01:25.140> this

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
probably be something similar to this

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:26.600 
probably be something similar to this
but<00:01:25.470> may<00:01:25.680> or<00:01:25.770> may<00:01:25.860> not<00:01:26.009> be<00:01:26.130> a<00:01:26.159> little<00:01:26.490> bit

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
but may or may not be a little bit

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.190 
but may or may not be a little bit
different<00:01:26.909> so<00:01:27.390> it<00:01:27.540> doesn't<00:01:27.810> matter<00:01:27.960> we'll

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
different so it doesn't matter we'll

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.350 
different so it doesn't matter we'll
still<00:01:28.409> set<00:01:28.560> up<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:28.770> same<00:01:28.950> way<00:01:29.130> that's<00:01:30.030> part<00:01:30.270> of

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
still set up the same way that's part of

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.760 
still set up the same way that's part of
one<00:01:30.840> of<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:30.990> good<00:01:31.110> things<00:01:31.290> about<00:01:31.350> this<00:01:31.590> system

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
one of the good things about this system

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.440 
one of the good things about this system
is<00:01:32.070> there<00:01:32.250> isn't<00:01:32.640> too<00:01:32.970> much<00:01:33.210> reading

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
is there isn't too much reading

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.469 
is there isn't too much reading
reactance<00:01:34.049> it's<00:01:34.290> just<00:01:34.759> you<00:01:35.759> go<00:01:35.970> your<00:01:36.119> position

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
reactance it's just you go your position

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.830 
reactance it's just you go your position
set<00:01:36.720> up<00:01:36.869> and<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.409> system<00:01:37.710> works<00:01:37.920> by<00:01:38.820> itself<00:01:38.880> so

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
set up and the system works by itself so

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.420 
set up and the system works by itself so
what<00:01:40.079> we're<00:01:40.170> going<00:01:40.259> to<00:01:40.320> do<00:01:40.439> here<00:01:40.619> is<00:01:40.829> the

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
what we're going to do here is the

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:42.950 
what we're going to do here is the
closest<00:01:41.880> player<00:01:42.060> to<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.270> puck<00:01:42.450> will<00:01:42.659> attack

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
closest player to the puck will attack

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.420 
closest player to the puck will attack
that's<00:01:43.590> where<00:01:43.860> we've<00:01:44.009> got<00:01:44.159> our<00:01:44.250> right

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
that's where we've got our right

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.149 
that's where we've got our right
defenseman<00:01:45.200> so<00:01:46.200> right<00:01:46.409> defenseman<00:01:46.860> will<00:01:47.009> go

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
defenseman so right defenseman will go

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.670 
defenseman so right defenseman will go
out<00:01:47.340> and<00:01:47.579> pressure<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:48.060> puck<00:01:48.210> character

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:48.680 
out and pressure the puck character

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.950 
out and pressure the puck character
centerman<00:01:49.680> will<00:01:49.860> set<00:01:50.100> up<00:01:50.220> on<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.909> strong<00:01:51.630> side

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
centerman will set up on the strong side

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.440 
centerman will set up on the strong side
corner<00:01:52.619> of<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:52.979> box<00:01:53.159> okay<00:01:53.670> so<00:01:53.729> he's<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.329> one

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
corner of the box okay so he's the one

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.090 
corner of the box okay so he's the one
that's<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:55.110> set<00:01:55.320> of<00:01:55.409> his<00:01:55.500> position<00:01:55.890> isn't

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
that's the set of his position isn't

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.380 
that's the set of his position isn't
always<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.640> same<00:01:56.790> I'll<00:01:56.969> show<00:01:57.090> you<00:01:57.149> how<00:01:57.240> this

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
always the same I'll show you how this

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.929 
always the same I'll show you how this
works<00:01:57.630> but<00:01:58.229> for<00:01:59.130> if<00:01:59.369> the<00:01:59.490> puck<00:01:59.640> is<00:01:59.759> in<00:01:59.790> the

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
works but for if the puck is in the

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.039 
works but for if the puck is in the
corner<00:02:00.240> cinnamon<00:02:00.570> is<00:02:00.630> going<00:02:00.750> to<00:02:00.810> be<00:02:00.869> on<00:02:00.960> the

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
corner cinnamon is going to be on the

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.260 
corner cinnamon is going to be on the
strong<00:02:01.290> side<00:02:01.320> post<00:02:01.969> supporting<00:02:02.969> the

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
strong side post supporting the

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.340 
strong side post supporting the
attacking<00:02:03.659> player

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
attacking player

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.530 
attacking player
okay<00:02:04.649> so<00:02:04.799> supporting<00:02:05.340> in<00:02:05.610> this<00:02:06.000> scenario<00:02:06.270> his

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
okay so supporting in this scenario his

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.109 
okay so supporting in this scenario his
right<00:02:06.719> defenseman<00:02:07.259> left<00:02:08.129> defenseman<00:02:08.670> will<00:02:08.970> be

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
right defenseman left defenseman will be

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.360 
right defenseman left defenseman will be
on<00:02:09.360> the<00:02:09.660> far<00:02:09.869> post<00:02:10.080> okay<00:02:10.770> and<00:02:11.009> that's<00:02:11.190> his

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
on the far post okay and that's his

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.470 
on the far post okay and that's his
general<00:02:11.849> position

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
general position

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.839 
general position
so<00:02:12.810> he<00:02:12.930> goes<00:02:13.170> there<00:02:13.410> sets<00:02:13.739> up<00:02:13.920> and<00:02:14.129> then<00:02:14.370> he

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:14.849 
so he goes there sets up and then he

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:16.190 
so he goes there sets up and then he
doesn't<00:02:15.090> just<00:02:15.180> stand<00:02:15.420> there<00:02:15.599> he<00:02:15.840> goes<00:02:15.989> there

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
doesn't just stand there he goes there

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.140 
doesn't just stand there he goes there
sets<00:02:16.500> up<00:02:16.680> and<00:02:16.860> then<00:02:16.950> looks<00:02:17.220> and<00:02:17.489> see<00:02:17.910> if<00:02:18.000> there

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
sets up and then looks and see if there

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.660 
sets up and then looks and see if there
are<00:02:18.180> any<00:02:18.470> opposing<00:02:19.470> players<00:02:19.709> around<00:02:20.040> so<00:02:20.550> in

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
are any opposing players around so in

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.059 
are any opposing players around so in
this<00:02:20.760> case<00:02:21.000> he'd<00:02:21.599> set<00:02:21.930> up<00:02:22.050> here<00:02:22.290> and<00:02:22.500> then<00:02:22.620> most

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
this case he'd set up here and then most

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:25.070 
this case he'd set up here and then most
likely<00:02:23.190> he'd<00:02:23.700> probably<00:02:23.940> be<00:02:24.360> wanting<00:02:24.750> to<00:02:24.870> pick

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
likely he'd probably be wanting to pick

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.869 
likely he'd probably be wanting to pick
up<00:02:25.230> on<00:02:25.379> this<00:02:25.530> guy<00:02:25.709> so<00:02:26.310> we<00:02:26.489> don't<00:02:26.640> have<00:02:26.700> a<00:02:26.760> guy

00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:26.879 
up on this guy so we don't have a guy

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:29.050 
up on this guy so we don't have a guy
standing<00:02:27.180> in<00:02:27.239> front<00:02:27.360> of<00:02:27.510> net<00:02:27.660> by<00:02:27.810> himself

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
standing in front of net by himself

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.370 
standing in front of net by himself
left-wingers<00:02:30.060> same<00:02:30.360> kind<00:02:30.599> of<00:02:30.660> thing<00:02:30.870> as<00:02:31.080> the

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
left-wingers same kind of thing as the

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:32.960 
left-wingers same kind of thing as the
left<00:02:31.530> defenseman<00:02:32.010> so<00:02:32.130> that<00:02:32.280> weak<00:02:32.459> side<00:02:32.670> winger

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
left defenseman so that weak side winger

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.020 
left defenseman so that weak side winger
he<00:02:33.360> sets<00:02:33.630> up<00:02:33.780> on<00:02:33.959> the<00:02:34.019> weak<00:02:34.590> side<00:02:34.620> I<00:02:35.190> call<00:02:35.910> it

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
he sets up on the weak side I call it

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.030 
he sets up on the weak side I call it
the<00:02:36.120> high<00:02:36.269> post<00:02:36.540> just<00:02:36.959> because<00:02:37.170> it's<00:02:37.590> roughly

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
the high post just because it's roughly

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.640 
the high post just because it's roughly
aligned<00:02:38.489> with<00:02:38.670> the<00:02:38.760> post<00:02:39.000> but<00:02:39.420> higher<00:02:40.349> up<00:02:40.530> in

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
aligned with the post but higher up in

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.160 
aligned with the post but higher up in
the<00:02:40.709> slot<00:02:41.000> so<00:02:42.000> left<00:02:42.239> wings<00:02:42.420> on<00:02:42.569> the<00:02:42.810> weak<00:02:43.140> side

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
the slot so left wings on the weak side

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.890 
the slot so left wings on the weak side
high<00:02:43.500> post<00:02:43.799> and<00:02:44.299> he's<00:02:45.299> doing<00:02:45.480> the<00:02:45.569> same<00:02:45.720> thing

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
high post and he's doing the same thing

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.449 
high post and he's doing the same thing
that's<00:02:46.080> his<00:02:46.200> general<00:02:46.530> setup<00:02:46.830> but<00:02:47.220> at<00:02:47.280> the<00:02:47.340> same

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
that's his general setup but at the same

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:48.410 
that's his general setup but at the same
time<00:02:47.610> he's<00:02:47.760> got<00:02:47.819> his<00:02:48.000> head<00:02:48.120> on<00:02:48.209> a<00:02:48.239> swivel

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
time he's got his head on a swivel

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.210 
time he's got his head on a swivel
making<00:02:49.230> sure<00:02:49.319> that<00:02:49.440> you<00:02:49.739> know<00:02:49.769> maybe<00:02:50.040> this

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
making sure that you know maybe this

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.979 
making sure that you know maybe this
defenseman<00:02:50.760> doesn't<00:02:50.970> sneak<00:02:51.209> in<00:02:51.390> behind<00:02:51.540> him

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
defenseman doesn't sneak in behind him

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:54.050 
defenseman doesn't sneak in behind him
or<00:02:52.200> try<00:02:53.010> to<00:02:53.069> penetrate<00:02:53.250> through<00:02:53.730> the<00:02:53.819> middle

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
or try to penetrate through the middle

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.100 
or try to penetrate through the middle
of<00:02:54.500> your<00:02:55.500> box<00:02:55.739> or<00:02:56.549> if<00:02:57.209> they've<00:02:57.450> got<00:02:57.660> a<00:02:57.690> second

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
of your box or if they've got a second

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.289 
of your box or if they've got a second
forward<00:02:58.620> over<00:02:58.829> here<00:02:59.069> obviously<00:03:00.030> he's<00:03:00.180> gonna

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:00.299 
forward over here obviously he's gonna

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:02.089 
forward over here obviously he's gonna
want<00:03:00.480> to<00:03:00.569> make<00:03:00.959> sure<00:03:01.110> he<00:03:01.230> picks<00:03:01.440> up<00:03:01.590> that<00:03:01.709> guy

00:03:02.089 --> 00:03:02.099 
want to make sure he picks up that guy

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:05.479 
want to make sure he picks up that guy
so<00:03:02.700> um<00:03:03.230> set<00:03:04.230> up<00:03:04.349> on<00:03:04.470> the<00:03:04.590> weak<00:03:04.920> side<00:03:04.950> high<00:03:05.220> post

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
so um set up on the weak side high post

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:06.920 
so um set up on the weak side high post
but<00:03:05.760> at<00:03:05.910> the<00:03:06.000> same<00:03:06.150> time<00:03:06.329> cut<00:03:06.569> on<00:03:06.690> a<00:03:06.720> swivel

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
but at the same time cut on a swivel

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.449 
but at the same time cut on a swivel
picking<00:03:07.290> up<00:03:07.410> any<00:03:07.590> additional<00:03:07.980> players<00:03:08.220> that

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
picking up any additional players that

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:10.699 
picking up any additional players that
may<00:03:08.640> be<00:03:08.700> lurking<00:03:09.030> around<00:03:09.329> there<00:03:09.630> then<00:03:10.620> the

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
may be lurking around there then the

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:12.259 
may be lurking around there then the
right<00:03:10.860> winger<00:03:11.160> is<00:03:11.430> on<00:03:11.700> the<00:03:11.790> strong<00:03:12.000> side<00:03:12.239> high

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
right winger is on the strong side high

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:15.470 
right winger is on the strong side high
post<00:03:12.660> and<00:03:13.130> you<00:03:14.130> know<00:03:14.220> it's<00:03:14.760> basically<00:03:14.970> kind<00:03:15.360> of

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
post and you know it's basically kind of

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.180 
post and you know it's basically kind of
the<00:03:15.540> same<00:03:15.720> thing<00:03:15.959> he's<00:03:16.200> he's<00:03:16.590> there<00:03:16.889> but<00:03:17.040> then

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
the same thing he's he's there but then

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:18.590 
the same thing he's he's there but then
he's<00:03:17.340> making<00:03:17.639> sure<00:03:17.670> that<00:03:17.970> nobody's

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
he's making sure that nobody's

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.020 
he's making sure that nobody's
penetrating<00:03:19.019> the<00:03:19.109> box<00:03:19.430> he's<00:03:20.430> also<00:03:20.670> probably

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
penetrating the box he's also probably

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.910 
penetrating the box he's also probably
anticipating<00:03:21.930> a<00:03:21.959> possible<00:03:22.290> pass<00:03:22.470> out<00:03:22.680> to<00:03:22.829> the

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
anticipating a possible pass out to the

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.970 
anticipating a possible pass out to the
point<00:03:23.510> and<00:03:24.510> that's<00:03:24.690> basically<00:03:25.019> his<00:03:25.260> job<00:03:25.500> so

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
point and that's basically his job so

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.490 
point and that's basically his job so
with<00:03:26.280> the<00:03:26.430> Box<00:03:26.700> plus-one<00:03:27.329> as<00:03:27.540> you<00:03:28.049> can<00:03:28.200> see

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
with the Box plus-one as you can see

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.259 
with the Box plus-one as you can see
you're<00:03:28.889> never<00:03:29.250> ever<00:03:29.459> ever<00:03:29.700> going<00:03:29.940> to<00:03:29.970> be<00:03:30.090> out

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
you're never ever ever going to be out

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:32.000 
you're never ever ever going to be out
manned<00:03:30.540> in<00:03:30.780> front<00:03:31.019> of<00:03:31.079> the<00:03:31.139> net<00:03:31.319> it's

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
manned in front of the net it's

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.460 
manned in front of the net it's
physically<00:03:32.370> impossible<00:03:32.430> if<00:03:33.000> as<00:03:33.720> long<00:03:33.810> as<00:03:34.290> they

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
physically impossible if as long as they

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:37.699 
physically impossible if as long as they
have<00:03:34.680> one<00:03:34.950> player<00:03:35.250> with<00:03:35.489> the<00:03:35.609> puck<00:03:36.290> then<00:03:37.290> it's

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
have one player with the puck then it's

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:39.890 
have one player with the puck then it's
impossible<00:03:38.100> for<00:03:38.609> them<00:03:38.730> to<00:03:38.760> have<00:03:39.030> more<00:03:39.299> than

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
impossible for them to have more than

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.870 
impossible for them to have more than
four<00:03:40.410> players<00:03:40.650> in<00:03:40.950> front<00:03:41.340> of<00:03:41.400> the<00:03:41.459> net<00:03:41.609> so

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
four players in front of the net so

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:42.830 
four players in front of the net so
you're<00:03:42.000> never<00:03:42.060> going<00:03:42.269> to<00:03:42.299> be<00:03:42.389> out<00:03:42.510> man<00:03:42.720> in

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
you're never going to be out man in

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.390 
you're never going to be out man in
front<00:03:43.049> of<00:03:43.109> the<00:03:43.170> net<00:03:43.319> which<00:03:43.859> is<00:03:44.040> part<00:03:44.280> of<00:03:44.310> the

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
front of the net which is part of the

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.879 
front of the net which is part of the
reason<00:03:44.489> why<00:03:44.700> it's<00:03:44.940> so<00:03:45.150> effective<00:03:45.450> in<00:03:45.840> but<00:03:46.739> it's

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:46.889 
reason why it's so effective in but it's

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:48.229 
reason why it's so effective in but it's
like<00:03:47.100> I<00:03:47.220> said<00:03:47.370> before<00:03:47.459> it<00:03:47.760> is<00:03:47.850> a<00:03:47.880> little<00:03:48.120> bit

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
like I said before it is a little bit

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:51.530 
like I said before it is a little bit
passive<00:03:48.660> so<00:03:49.260> that<00:03:49.680> is<00:03:50.069> the<00:03:50.280> basic<00:03:50.609> setup<00:03:50.850> now

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
passive so that is the basic setup now

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.569 
passive so that is the basic setup now
let's<00:03:51.840> say<00:03:51.989> that<00:03:52.200> let's<00:03:52.829> say<00:03:52.920> the<00:03:53.069> puck<00:03:53.250> gets

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:53.579 
let's say that let's say the puck gets

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:55.640 
let's say that let's say the puck gets
shot<00:03:54.299> around<00:03:54.420> and<00:03:54.810> now<00:03:54.900> it's<00:03:55.079> in<00:03:55.200> this<00:03:55.319> corner

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
shot around and now it's in this corner

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.979 
shot around and now it's in this corner
I'm<00:03:55.739> not<00:03:55.889> going<00:03:56.010> to<00:03:56.069> draw<00:03:56.480> all<00:03:57.480> the<00:03:57.540> other

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
I'm not going to draw all the other

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:00.199 
I'm not going to draw all the other
team's<00:03:58.290> movements<00:03:59.069> I'm<00:03:59.370> just<00:03:59.670> going<00:03:59.819> to<00:03:59.849> suit

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
team's movements I'm just going to suit

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:02.240 
team's movements I'm just going to suit
you<00:04:00.540> know<00:04:00.630> assume<00:04:01.049> that<00:04:01.319> one<00:04:02.040> of<00:04:02.160> their

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
you know assume that one of their

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:03.740 
you know assume that one of their
players<00:04:02.459> probably<00:04:03.030> this<00:04:03.120> guy<00:04:03.209> in<00:04:03.450> this<00:04:03.540> case

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
players probably this guy in this case

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.629 
players probably this guy in this case
is<00:04:03.900> going<00:04:04.019> to<00:04:04.109> go<00:04:04.200> get<00:04:04.319> the<00:04:04.380> puck<00:04:04.560> so<00:04:05.489> what

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:05.639 
is going to go get the puck so what

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:06.770 
is going to go get the puck so what
we're<00:04:05.730> going<00:04:05.819> to<00:04:05.880> do<00:04:06.030> here<00:04:06.209> is<00:04:06.359> puck<00:04:06.599> comes

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
we're going to do here is puck comes

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.780 
we're going to do here is puck comes
into<00:04:06.930> this<00:04:07.019> corner<00:04:07.290> now<00:04:07.500> it's<00:04:08.130> just<00:04:08.489> simple

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
into this corner now it's just simple

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.940 
into this corner now it's just simple
shift<00:04:09.000> left<00:04:09.540> defenseman<00:04:10.049> comes<00:04:10.290> down<00:04:10.530> to<00:04:10.799> play

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
shift left defenseman comes down to play

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:13.550 
shift left defenseman comes down to play
the<00:04:11.069> puck<00:04:11.250> centerman<00:04:12.239> comes<00:04:12.510> across<00:04:12.840> like<00:04:13.290> I

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
the puck centerman comes across like I

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.000 
the puck centerman comes across like I
said<00:04:13.739> before<00:04:13.859> he<00:04:14.639> plays<00:04:14.940> on<00:04:14.970> the<00:04:15.829> he's<00:04:16.829> the

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.010 
said before he plays on the he's the

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:18.890 
said before he plays on the he's the
moving<00:04:17.400> corner<00:04:17.760> of<00:04:17.880> the<00:04:17.970> box<00:04:18.180> so<00:04:18.780> the

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
moving corner of the box so the

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.029 
moving corner of the box so the
sentiment<00:04:19.289> is<00:04:19.349> always<00:04:19.590> going<00:04:19.680> to<00:04:19.739> be<00:04:19.829> on<00:04:19.950> the

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:20.039 
sentiment is always going to be on the

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:21.890 
sentiment is always going to be on the
strong<00:04:20.280> side<00:04:20.310> corner<00:04:20.849> of<00:04:20.970> the<00:04:21.060> box<00:04:21.269> so<00:04:21.870> he

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
strong side corner of the box so he

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.659 
strong side corner of the box so he
slides<00:04:22.289> over<00:04:22.530> to<00:04:22.650> take<00:04:22.860> the<00:04:22.979> strong<00:04:23.220> post<00:04:23.520> in

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380 
this case

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:26.620 
this case
and<00:04:24.470> the<00:04:24.980> right<00:04:25.130> defenseman<00:04:25.640> comes<00:04:25.910> over<00:04:26.180> to

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
and the right defenseman comes over to

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:32.830 
the rear post our weak post weak side
post<00:04:30.800> and<00:04:31.040> that's<00:04:31.790> the<00:04:31.910> basic<00:04:32.210> shift<00:04:32.450> there<00:04:32.720> so

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:32.840 
post and that's the basic shift there so

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.390 
post and that's the basic shift there so
if<00:04:32.930> it<00:04:33.020> goes<00:04:33.080> corner<00:04:33.410> to<00:04:33.530> corner<00:04:33.680> the<00:04:33.920> only

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:35.600 
three players that move are the two

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:40.820 
it comes up to the point okay then this

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:42.850 
it comes up to the point okay then this
shift<00:04:41.150> is<00:04:41.270> still<00:04:41.450> simple<00:04:41.780> the<00:04:42.170> player<00:04:42.410> on<00:04:42.650> the
