so what you want to do once you kind of
set<00:00:19.350> the<00:00:19.439> speed<00:00:19.619> where<00:00:19.800> you<00:00:19.859> want<00:00:20.039> to<00:00:20.130> be<00:00:20.250> at

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
set the speed where you want to be at

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.580 
set the speed where you want to be at
you've<00:00:21.119> got<00:00:21.300> your<00:00:21.480> cruise<00:00:21.840> control<00:00:21.960> buttons

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
you've got your cruise control buttons

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.560 
you've got your cruise control buttons
down<00:00:22.710> below<00:00:22.769> so<00:00:23.670> you<00:00:23.730> want<00:00:23.910> to<00:00:23.970> make<00:00:24.090> sure<00:00:24.119> your

down below so you want to make sure your
cruise<00:00:25.380> your<00:00:25.740> adaptive<00:00:26.220> cruise<00:00:26.310> control<00:00:26.460> is

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
cruise your adaptive cruise control is

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.929 
cruise your adaptive cruise control is
turned<00:00:27.029> on<00:00:27.830> okay<00:00:28.830> so<00:00:28.920> now<00:00:29.160> it<00:00:29.369> says<00:00:29.580> it's<00:00:29.760> off

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
turned on okay so now it says it's off

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.299 
turned on okay so now it says it's off
Suffolk<00:00:30.510> pushed<00:00:30.689> again<00:00:30.990> it<00:00:31.140> says<00:00:31.349> ACC<00:00:32.009> ready

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
Suffolk pushed again it says ACC ready

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.150 
Suffolk pushed again it says ACC ready
or<00:00:32.489> adaptive<00:00:32.940> cruise<00:00:33.059> control<00:00:33.120> ready<00:00:34.160> then

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
or adaptive cruise control ready then

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.150 
or adaptive cruise control ready then
you<00:00:35.250> want<00:00:35.430> to<00:00:35.489> set<00:00:35.790> your<00:00:36.059> your<00:00:36.480> speed<00:00:37.010> so<00:00:38.010> right

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
you want to set your your speed so right

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.040 
you want to set your your speed so right
now<00:00:38.309> it's<00:00:38.520> set<00:00:38.700> is<00:00:38.850> 63<00:00:39.329> miles<00:00:39.510> per<00:00:39.660> hour<00:00:39.840> the

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
now it's set is 63 miles per hour the

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.619 
now it's set is 63 miles per hour the
traffic's<00:00:40.469> a<00:00:40.559> little<00:00:40.800> heavy<00:00:40.950> on<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.219> freeway

00:00:41.619 --> 00:00:41.629 
traffic's a little heavy on the freeway

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:44.389 
traffic's a little heavy on the freeway
I'm<00:00:42.629> gonna<00:00:42.840> actually<00:00:42.960> set<00:00:43.590> that<00:00:43.800> speed<00:00:44.100> up<00:00:44.280> a

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
I'm gonna actually set that speed up a

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.510 
I'm gonna actually set that speed up a
little<00:00:44.430> bit<00:00:45.530> and<00:00:46.530> turn<00:00:46.739> it<00:00:46.829> up<00:00:46.890> to<00:00:46.920> about<00:00:47.129> say

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
little bit and turn it up to about say

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.520 
little bit and turn it up to about say
70<00:00:48.090> so<00:00:48.360> we<00:00:48.480> can<00:00:48.629> get<00:00:48.750> an<00:00:48.870> idea<00:00:49.110> of<00:00:49.170> just<00:00:49.289> how

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
70 so we can get an idea of just how

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.020 
70 so we can get an idea of just how
well<00:00:49.680> it<00:00:49.800> works<00:00:50.010> and<00:00:50.129> says<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.520> speed<00:00:50.760> right

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
well it works and says the speed right

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.420 
well it works and says the speed right
there<00:00:51.090> down<00:00:51.449> below<00:00:51.559> but<00:00:52.559> you<00:00:52.590> can<00:00:52.800> also<00:00:52.949> set

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
there down below but you can also set

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.549 
there down below but you can also set
your<00:00:53.489> your<00:00:54.300> distances<00:00:54.840> between<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.350> cars

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
your your distances between the cars

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.790 
your your distances between the cars
that's<00:00:56.010> what<00:00:56.160> these<00:00:56.250> two<00:00:56.309> right<00:00:56.670> here<00:00:57.680> okay<00:00:58.680> if

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
that's what these two right here okay if

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.470 
that's what these two right here okay if
this<00:00:59.070> is<00:00:59.129> a<00:00:59.309> good<00:00:59.430> example<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.969> car<00:01:00.149> in<00:01:00.270> front

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
this is a good example the car in front

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.200 
this is a good example the car in front
of<00:01:00.539> us<00:01:00.660> are<00:01:00.870> slowing<00:01:01.289> down<00:01:01.430> and<00:01:02.430> as<00:01:02.879> you<00:01:02.969> can

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
of us are slowing down and as you can

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.000 
of us are slowing down and as you can
see<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.629> Grand<00:01:03.809> Cherokee<00:01:04.229> to<00:01:04.379> slow<00:01:04.589> down<00:01:04.769> by

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
see the Grand Cherokee to slow down by

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.740 
see the Grand Cherokee to slow down by
itself<00:01:05.309> automatically<00:01:05.970> it<00:01:06.180> does<00:01:06.450> that<00:01:06.659> by

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
itself automatically it does that by

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.870 
itself automatically it does that by
using<00:01:06.930> sonar<00:01:07.590> and<00:01:07.890> so<00:01:08.040> it<00:01:08.159> sends<00:01:08.310> out<00:01:08.430> of<00:01:08.549> sonar

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
using sonar and so it sends out of sonar

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.270 
using sonar and so it sends out of sonar
like<00:01:09.060> in<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.270> submarine<00:01:09.750> and<00:01:10.140> it'll<00:01:10.920> just

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
like in the submarine and it'll just

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.070 
like in the submarine and it'll just
basically<00:01:11.850> tag<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.299> car<00:01:12.479> in<00:01:12.570> front<00:01:12.780> of<00:01:12.869> you<00:01:12.990> to

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
basically tag the car in front of you to

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:18.109 
basically tag the car in front of you to
help<00:01:13.260> you<00:01:13.380> match<00:01:13.590> their<00:01:14.010> speed<00:01:16.820> so<00:01:17.820> right<00:01:17.970> now

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
help you match their speed so right now

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.090 
help you match their speed so right now
my<00:01:18.270> cruise<00:01:18.479> control<00:01:18.869> this<00:01:19.020> set<00:01:19.200> is<00:01:19.350> 70<00:01:19.770> but

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
my cruise control this set is 70 but

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.230 
my cruise control this set is 70 but
because<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.520> car<00:01:20.670> in<00:01:20.759> front<00:01:20.909> of<00:01:20.970> me<00:01:21.030> is<00:01:21.150> only

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
because the car in front of me is only

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.410 
because the car in front of me is only
doing<00:01:21.450> 60<00:01:21.930> that's<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:22.920> speed<00:01:23.159> that<00:01:23.340> we<00:01:23.420> are

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
doing 60 that's the speed that we are

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.179 
doing 60 that's the speed that we are
going<00:01:24.689> this<00:01:25.170> is<00:01:25.229> really<00:01:25.560> nice<00:01:25.650> if<00:01:25.710> you're<00:01:26.009> in<00:01:26.130> a

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
going this is really nice if you're in a

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.160 
going this is really nice if you're in a
nice<00:01:26.369> long<00:01:27.119> trip<00:01:27.420> because<00:01:27.720> you're<00:01:27.840> not<00:01:27.930> always

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
nice long trip because you're not always

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.380 
nice long trip because you're not always
adjusting<00:01:28.619> your<00:01:28.680> cruise<00:01:28.890> control<00:01:29.240> so<00:01:30.240> I'm

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
adjusting your cruise control so I'm

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:31.609 
adjusting your cruise control so I'm
gonna<00:01:30.479> change<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:30.900> lanes<00:01:31.079> and<00:01:31.200> get<00:01:31.350> behind

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
gonna change the lanes and get behind

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:32.840 
gonna change the lanes and get behind
this<00:01:31.710> vehicle<00:01:31.890> that's<00:01:32.280> going<00:01:32.490> a<00:01:32.549> little<00:01:32.670> bit

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
this vehicle that's going a little bit

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.730 
this vehicle that's going a little bit
faster<00:01:33.360> and<00:01:33.570> I'm<00:01:34.079> not<00:01:34.229> touching<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:34.590> gas

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
faster and I'm not touching the gas

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.350 
faster and I'm not touching the gas
pedal<00:01:35.130> this<00:01:35.250> is<00:01:35.430> all<00:01:35.549> done<00:01:35.729> by<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:35.939> vehicle

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
pedal this is all done by the vehicle

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.069 
pedal this is all done by the vehicle
itself<00:01:37.939> so<00:01:38.939> when<00:01:39.060> that<00:01:39.150> next<00:01:39.479> line<00:01:39.600> opens<00:01:39.930> up

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
itself so when that next line opens up

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.480 
itself so when that next line opens up
off<00:01:40.259> again<00:01:40.710> that<00:01:40.920> one<00:01:41.040> because<00:01:41.189> they're<00:01:41.310> going

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
off again that one because they're going

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:42.830 
off again that one because they're going
a<00:01:41.520> little<00:01:41.579> bit<00:01:41.759> faster<00:01:42.150> as<00:01:42.270> well<00:01:42.450> so<00:01:42.659> you<00:01:42.750> can

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
a little bit faster as well so you can

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.260 
a little bit faster as well so you can
really<00:01:42.899> see<00:01:43.520> just<00:01:44.520> how<00:01:44.640> well<00:01:44.670> this<00:01:45.000> cruise

really see just how well this cruise

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.819 
really see just how well this cruise
control<00:01:45.659> system<00:01:46.079> works
