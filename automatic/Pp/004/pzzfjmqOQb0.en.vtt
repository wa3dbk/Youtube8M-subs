00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:04.780
 good we're going to change the cables 

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:09.670
 sar command selector Picasso and 

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:10.930
 I have changed it is a 2.0 hdi but more or 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:14.200
 less I show you what needs to be done 

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:17.440
 you have to get the two plugs one of 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:19.710
 sheet and other plastic that protect the 

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.710
 engine 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:26.349
 they are grabbed with bolts and work there 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:27.910
 to get the heat diffuser that that 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:31.290
 is the metal we see there that is 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:34.290
 aluminum that goes two screws 

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:34.290
 ahead 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:40.600
 two screws behind 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:43.590
 what is complicated to take out is a little 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:46.620
 is this because it is very close to the pipe 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.600
 of hydraulic steering 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.059
 but what I did is take it out and 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.600
 move it backwards because below 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:58.230
 of the pacifier below this right here 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:01:01.079
 is the rubber that holds the cables that 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.899
 prevents the passage of water 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.460
 and it becomes impossible to remove in 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.770
 he is composed of that there is 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.270
 move it backwards 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.810
 that the only way I found him 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:15.359
 maybe someone else has another way 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:20.040
 well, after taking that out, they come off 

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:24.060
 the cables these cables that we see here 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.980
 on this side he has two locks up in 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.950
 each one that prevents the 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:30.540
 cable and the signalers wear a 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.430
 little button 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:37.280
 that squeezes and pulls up 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:40.750
 Once that is done 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.750
 go to the top 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:58.469
 well here what needs to be done is the 

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:58.469
 part of the console below goes 1 2 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.610
 34 little screws on one side and 4 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:07.400
 little screws from another 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:10.270
 once they are removed they move with 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:13.670
 careful because you have to bring them to light 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:17.140
 of the ashtray and you have to get the 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:19.660
 connector that goes to the cigarette lighter 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:22.450
 once removed that displaced and removed to 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:25.000
 the console what you have to do is take out 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.540
 these cables and then by the ac the new 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.490
 position 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.410
 these cables 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:33.440
 are taken with these three views just like 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:35.280
 those in front are pressed and thrown 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:37.410
 forward 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.690
 if they press me and they throw themselves towards 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:43.350
 forward they are easy to take out 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:46.930
 a little bit more complicated but not so much 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:48.310
 are the and the lever of change that we 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:52.700
 see here 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:55.760
 it is this army that we have here 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:59.750
 and what we have here 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:02.240
 to pull them out you have to pull this 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:05.420
 wire he cited 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:08.420
 and taken out to put them 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:12.110
 they put in prison only they fit and they 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:15.190
 push until you feel the click 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:15.190
 once that 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:20.470
 supposedly and armed everything 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:27.870
 here the same here we see from above 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.730
 engine you have to remove the filter 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.250
 if the top part of the filter 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.770
 enough bothered me but well here 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.500
 carries 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:39.260
 a clamp or a seal 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:41.750
 plastic to grab the element 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:45.480
 filtering and down and see 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:47.670
 ball joint on the changed cables 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.620
 and we see in yellow what allows the 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:52.530
 regulation 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:54.920
 and we see the botoncito with Patella 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.920
 other side 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.439
 the other kneecap 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:10.180
 well now let's test if they pass the 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:10.180
 changes 

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:14.190
 once changed 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.950
 clutch 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:21.050
 perfect 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:25.060
 then we are going to start them 

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:25.060
 and approve greetings for all
