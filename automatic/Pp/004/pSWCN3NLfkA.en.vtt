 an emotional person suddenly started 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:27.869
 to lose his cool and he told me that everything

 had gone wrong he said that things did not 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:34.680
 had gone well but that I should 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:37.680
 trust that they were going to get him out of there 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:41.570
 I swear to God and for his life that 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.570
 I would drive to the city of Houston 

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:48.180

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:01.410
 to new orleans and from there to laredo 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:04.050
 He also told me that even if not 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.090
 he arrived at the airport he was going to 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:09.270
 commission to find out what happened to him 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.850
 thanks to his multiple contacts I 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.580
 he said that he should trust him and keep 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.670
 his mouth closed and then hung the 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.490
 phone 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.170
 on the morning of Saturday, November 24 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.700
 oswalt was going to be transferred from the 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.500
 police station in the city of 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.450
 dallas where he remained after his arrest 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.100
 to a more secure cell in the police station 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.930
 of the county national television 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:32.320
 transmitted the time of his transfer 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:35.510
 Judith observed everything from Florida I saw 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:38.000
 on television they moved him 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:40.820
 I realized that I could not get there 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.130
 to the airport and now they accused him of 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.470
 have murdered the president in the 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:48.080
 many press conferences that I saw no 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:50.840
 I wanted you had lost a lot of weight and 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:53.330
 that now he was very thin and also 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:56.120
 that he had a wound over his eye and a 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:58.760
 cut and I assumed that the agents or 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:00.650
 whoever they had hit him I gave 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.990
 I realized that I was hurt and I knew that 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:05.810
 they had not treated him well so I 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:09.290
 I felt very bad then I saw the moment 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:11.360
 in which they were taken out wearing a nice 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:13.970
 black sweater had shaved 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.310
 and I looked good I reassured myself and 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:19.150
 I thought they would treat him better and 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:22.689
 then he was shot 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:25.130
 he was shot he was shot as there 

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:28.280
 a man with a gun 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:30.290
 I do not know what happened after 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.170
 that shot my mind stayed in 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:35.210
 white for hours I tried 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:37.460
 find out what had happened and I think that 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:42.250
 at that moment I started screaming I think that 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:42.250
 I was crying and then I knew dead 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:48.490
 that was the first and the only time in my 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.420
 life in which I thought about killing myself not 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:52.190
 I wanted to continue living 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.470
 almost two weeks after the murder 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:56.420
 of the world ferry I call for the last time 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.310
 to judith from new orleans for 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.670
 warn him that he would die if he revealed what 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.670
 I knew 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:07.989
 it reminded me that saint trafficker who 

00:03:04.719 --> 00:03:11.180
 He was a close friend of Charles Marcellus 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:13.909
 New Orléans mafia boss 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:16.700
 he was going to take charge of watching all my 

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:19.280
 movements and that he had to keep his mouth 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:21.709
 closed he also told me he was not going to 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:24.709
 highlight me in any career and that 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:27.319
 neither was I going to get success since 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:29.599
 now he had to keep a low profile and 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:31.610
 lead a discreet life if you wanted 

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:35.220
 stay alive 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:40.130
 he cut the communication abruptly 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:40.130
 and he told me he would never call me again 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:47.870
 He warned me not to tell 

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:47.870
 nobody about this conversation 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:53.500
 and I never talked about this because I did not want 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:53.500
 as 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:04:00.370
 there would be no more scientific work or more 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.350
 attempts to find a cure against 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:06.800
 Cancer 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:09.980
 everything had gone wrong all 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:12.200
 that's all Judith kept the secret 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:14.150
 for 40 years but once your 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:15.590
 children grew up decided to break the 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:19.250
 silence before it was too much 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:21.950
 Later this has been a shameful act 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:24.800
 for my family and for my children something 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:27.410
 scandalous for them always try to 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:30.200
 teach them moral and good customs and 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:32.900
 here is your mother saying that what 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:35.780
 was the mistress of the supposed murderer of 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:37.790
 president of us i want to make it clear 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:39.910

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:43.220
 seriously my life and that of my family 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:45.650
 but it is what I had to do since oswalt 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:49.750
 he is an innocent man and my only wish 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:52.030
 is to clear his name 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:53.500
 we are an invasion of tiles hides one 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:55.210
 of the darkest and best secrets 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:57.960
