00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:14.559
 the bmw s1000 xr seems a strange one 

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:17.530
 cross between nature and the handlebar 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:19.240
 tall and a super sportsman tries the 

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:21.820
 machine no 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:25.930
 successful experiment the four-cylinder 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:27.970
 from a liter it delivers 160 horses one 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:32.079
 forty less than the same unit in 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:34.690
 supersport version of the s1000rr ma 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:35.200
 he gained in torque at the lows 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:37.720
 regimes 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:40.930
 those that are exploited more on 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:43.809
 road some mechanical interventions 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:46.390
 and above all to electronics have 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:48.750
 allowed to make a soft engine 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:51.640
 like a cream puff and bass e 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.210
 thoughtlessly powerful to the highs 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.360
 regimes 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:57.640
 the four-cylinder frontemarcia is 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:00.190
 housed in a frame too 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:03.129
 derived from the home sport with that 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:05.859
 small changes turned out to be perfect 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:07.079
 also for longer journeys and for the 

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:10.240
 urban commuting 

00:01:07.079 --> 00:01:13.929
 ergonomics has always been a point 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:15.999
 fort of the bellevue and the s 1000 r not 

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:18.340
 betrays the tradition of the house 

00:01:15.999 --> 00:01:20.740
 I drive the German crossover with 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.469
 naturalness and she follows my thoughts 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:26.170
 putting the front wheel right where 

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:29.619
 I also want to prolong braking 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:33.369
 up to inclined motion the electronics on 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:35.349
 this bike is heavily applied to the 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:37.929
 control unit offers different settings 

00:01:35.349 --> 00:01:39.909
 for engine maps the control of 

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:41.380
 traction and other parameters 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:44.349
 motorsports 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:47.169
 there are also many eyes welcomed into 

00:01:44.349 --> 00:01:49.179
 two touring and dynamic packages 

00:01:47.169 --> 00:01:52.450
 the first that makes it more comfortable and 

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:55.479
 comfortable your travels the second 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:59.349
 which makes this even more attractive 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:02.020
 motorcycle that is already in base is scary girls 

00:01:59.349 --> 00:02:03.310
 just to mention some of the options 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.009
 available 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:09.220
 from the church dwarfs or the suspensions 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:11.670
 active seeds that react in time 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:14.260
 real to the various roughness of the ground 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:17.590
 adapting the configuration of the bike 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:20.190
 or even the betrayal that allows 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:23.410
 to pull the brakes right into the curve 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:27.160
 without risking to fall 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:30.190
 seems little but in practice what it means 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:32.620
 all this means that you can choose 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:35.680
 to travel quietly perhaps with 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:38.230
 passenger and luggage without losing the 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.350
 taste of driving the taste of beauty 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:43.810
 fold of the artistic guide 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:45.940
 or you can push hard on the steps 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:49.090
 mountain with the security that 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:51.480
 the electronics will monitor perfectly 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:54.940
 your every action avoiding reactions 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:56.860
 sudden and very dangerous of the 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.890
 motorcycle 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:03.940
 however the brain must always be connected 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:06.580
 and you must always aim for more compromise 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:08.650
 I still have nice black lines on the 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:12.570
 curves in spain where we tried the 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.570
 I left the bikes e
