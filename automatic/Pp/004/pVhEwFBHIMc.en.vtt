00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:43.420
 hello how about guys today we're going to see the 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:45.370
 trick easier for 1 2 3 and 4 players 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.140
 here in muriel the only thing that we have to 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.850
 make us come to the barn for leaving us 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.890
 around here by the vallita as you see paste 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.450
 a little jump with careful until 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.730
 that you see that leaves us as subiditos 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:56.290
 over the fence then we will go through 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.180
 out skirting with a lot of care 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:00.160
 we will go by the outside line on the outside 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.290
 until we stay right in the middle of 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.059
 the straw if you see me going up and down 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.260
 that's why only that's why I do not 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:08.260
 You worry was no longer doing the 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.370
 subnormal once we are there the only thing 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.170
 what we will have to do is kill 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:12.940
 take the titan because you ever get 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.470
 shikotan and sometimes they give you a combo 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.240
 plates they stick two or three at a time 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.100
 then you have to be careful with 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.190
 that sense if they are not sure 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.900
 you continue to die at least the military the 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:24.190
 comrades would stay at the bottom some 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.070
 yes it up to them by the window that 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.360
 they have to the side but having the trap and 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.830
 there is no problem and replenishing the 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.450
 trap each round the truth is that 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:34.490
 We passed the round very very comfortable 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.649
 so nothing guys is a real 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.210
 last is super simple do you can 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:40.759
 be going down and up when I give you the 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.320
 wins because it's very easy to follow anything 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:44.420
 I hope you like it helps you there 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:47.950
 many rounds that you have the bank a 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.950
 alone and until next time 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.619
 how
