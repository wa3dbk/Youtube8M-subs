00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:14.559 
okay so I got a noisy fan from the power

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:18.179 
okay so I got a noisy fan from the power
supply<00:00:14.860> in<00:00:15.460> my<00:00:15.580> computer<00:00:16.140> so<00:00:17.140> I'll<00:00:17.410> be<00:00:17.680> taking

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:18.189 
supply in my computer so I'll be taking

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:21.090 
supply in my computer so I'll be taking
this<00:00:18.340> power<00:00:18.580> supply<00:00:18.760> out<00:00:19.119> and<00:00:19.980> replacing<00:00:20.980> the

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:21.100 
this power supply out and replacing the

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.370 
this power supply out and replacing the
fan<00:00:21.340> inside<00:00:21.760> the<00:00:22.390> first<00:00:22.660> thing<00:00:22.840> I<00:00:22.930> need<00:00:23.080> to<00:00:23.110> do

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:23.380 
fan inside the first thing I need to do

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:44.620 
fan inside the first thing I need to do
is<00:00:23.650> remove<00:00:24.369> the<00:00:24.640> cover

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:44.630 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:47.860 

now<00:00:45.630> I'll<00:00:45.870> remove<00:00:46.320> all<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.710> power<00:00:46.920> plugs

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:47.870 
now I'll remove all the power plugs

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:57.710 
now I'll remove all the power plugs
swing<00:00:48.920> the<00:00:49.920> hard<00:00:50.280> drive<00:00:51.739> cd-rom<00:00:56.450> the<00:00:57.450> main

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:57.720 
swing the hard drive cd-rom the main

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
motherboard plug the CPU plug and also

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:19.340 
motherboard plug the CPU plug and also
have<00:01:07.890> a<00:01:07.920> case<00:01:08.460> fan<00:01:08.880> here

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.490 

and<00:01:20.350> now<00:01:20.560> I<00:01:20.590> can<00:01:20.950> unscrew<00:01:21.580> the<00:01:21.990> power<00:01:22.990> supply

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:23.500 
and now I can unscrew the power supply

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:50.120 
and now I can unscrew the power supply
from<00:01:23.860> the<00:01:24.040> case

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.820 

okay<00:01:51.130> now<00:01:51.940> I<00:01:51.970> can<00:01:52.120> slide<00:01:52.720> the<00:01:53.080> power<00:01:53.440> supply

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:53.830 
okay now I can slide the power supply

00:01:53.830 --> 00:02:07.080 
okay now I can slide the power supply
out<00:02:04.710> to<00:02:05.710> remove<00:02:06.070> the<00:02:06.310> fan<00:02:06.520> from<00:02:06.820> the<00:02:06.910> power

and lift the fan out and remove the fans
plug<00:03:14.610> from<00:03:15.030> the<00:03:15.230> power<00:03:16.230> board<00:03:29.870> this<00:03:30.870> is<00:03:30.930> the

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
plug from the power board this is the

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:36.050 
plug from the power board this is the
old<00:03:31.290> one<00:03:31.530> and<00:03:32.150> that's<00:03:33.150> the<00:03:33.390> new<00:03:33.570> one<00:03:33.770> and<00:03:35.060> you

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
old one and that's the new one and you

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.000 
old one and that's the new one and you
have<00:03:36.150> to<00:03:36.270> make<00:03:36.420> sure<00:03:36.600> that<00:03:37.020> you<00:03:37.230> have<00:03:37.530> a<00:03:37.800> right

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
have to make sure that you have a right

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:38.660 
have to make sure that you have a right
fan

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
fan

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:43.190 
fan
both<00:03:39.180> of<00:03:39.450> these<00:03:39.540> are<00:03:39.900> 12<00:03:40.170> volts<00:03:40.650> and<00:03:41.600> point<00:03:42.600> 1<00:03:42.960> 6

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
both of these are 12 volts and point 1 6

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:51.370 
both of these are 12 volts and point 1 6
amps<00:03:43.830> and<00:03:45.050> both<00:03:46.050> of<00:03:46.080> them<00:03:46.350> have<00:03:46.560> the<00:03:46.800> same<00:03:46.830> plug

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:51.380 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:54.770 

now<00:03:52.380> some<00:03:52.710> of<00:03:52.740> the<00:03:52.920> older<00:03:53.910> power<00:03:54.300> supplies

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
now some of the older power supplies

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.170 
now some of the older power supplies
don't<00:03:55.230> have<00:03:55.530> plugs<00:03:55.920> like<00:03:56.130> this<00:03:56.370> they<00:03:56.940> would<00:03:57.150> be

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
don't have plugs like this they would be

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.800 
don't have plugs like this they would be
soldered<00:03:57.900> directly<00:03:58.140> onto<00:03:58.830> the<00:03:59.100> board<00:03:59.370> so<00:03:59.810> you

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
soldered directly onto the board so you

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:04.699 
soldered directly onto the board so you
would<00:04:01.020> probably<00:04:01.260> have<00:04:01.560> to<00:04:03.320> splice<00:04:04.320> the<00:04:04.530> wire

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
would probably have to splice the wire

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:08.300 
would probably have to splice the wire
and<00:04:04.980> then<00:04:06.140> solder<00:04:07.140> it<00:04:07.440> directly<00:04:07.920> onto<00:04:08.160> the

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
and then solder it directly onto the

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.380 
and then solder it directly onto the
board<00:04:09.350> or<00:04:10.350> you<00:04:11.190> can<00:04:11.370> splice<00:04:11.730> the<00:04:11.970> wire<00:04:12.150> and

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.390 
board or you can splice the wire and

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:15.800 
board or you can splice the wire and
connect<00:04:13.170> the<00:04:13.350> wires<00:04:13.620> using<00:04:14.480> these<00:04:15.480> little

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
connect the wires using these little

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:20.539 
connect the wires using these little
wire<00:04:16.560> connectors<00:04:18.380> ok<00:04:19.380> so<00:04:19.440> now<00:04:19.739> you<00:04:19.799> can<00:04:20.070> plug

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
wire connectors ok so now you can plug

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:36.070 
wire connectors ok so now you can plug
the<00:04:20.930> new<00:04:21.930> fan<00:04:22.490> into<00:04:23.490> the<00:04:23.640> board

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:05:52.870 

and<00:04:36.560> then<00:04:36.770> remount<00:04:37.400> the<00:04:37.580> fan

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:52.880 

00:05:52.880 --> 00:06:23.779 

and<00:05:53.880> you<00:05:54.540> placed<00:05:54.840> a<00:05:55.020> cover<00:06:21.800> and<00:06:22.800> put<00:06:23.640> the

00:06:23.779 --> 00:06:23.789 
and you placed a cover and put the

00:06:23.789 --> 00:07:29.980 
and you placed a cover and put the
screws<00:06:24.090> pack<00:06:24.479> whatever

00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:29.990 

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:33.469 

and<00:07:30.990> you<00:07:31.289> don't
