00:04:52.209 --> 00:04:52.219 
really think about this but in a world

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:54.370 
really think about this but in a world
where<00:04:52.460> LEDs<00:04:53.300> essentially<00:04:53.780> replacing

incandescent<00:04:54.800> bulbs<00:04:55.310> and<00:04:55.460> CFLs<00:04:56.030> so<00:04:56.300> that<00:04:56.449> we

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:56.570 
incandescent bulbs and CFLs so that we

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:58.270 
incandescent bulbs and CFLs so that we
don't<00:04:56.750> need<00:04:56.870> new<00:04:57.050> coal<00:04:57.320> power<00:04:57.530> plants<00:04:58.039> and<00:04:58.159> we

00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:58.280 
don't need new coal power plants and we

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:00.040 
don't need new coal power plants and we
don't<00:04:58.460> need<00:04:58.610> to<00:04:58.759> keep<00:04:59.599> putting<00:04:59.780> carbon

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.050 
don't need to keep putting carbon

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:02.170 
don't need to keep putting carbon
dioxide<00:05:00.530> into<00:05:00.680> the<00:05:00.770> atmosphere<00:05:00.860> so<00:05:01.280> right<00:05:02.060> now
