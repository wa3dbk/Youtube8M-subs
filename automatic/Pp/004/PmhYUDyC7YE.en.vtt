out<00:01:04.400> of<00:01:04.670> him

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:05.420 
out of him

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.679 
out of him
ricochet<00:01:06.350> and<00:01:06.650> smokescreen<00:01:07.310> he<00:01:08.210> looks<00:01:08.450> the

ricochet and smokescreen he looks the

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:11.590 
ricochet and smokescreen he looks the
nicest<00:01:08.890> definitely<00:01:09.890> the<00:01:10.850> silver<00:01:11.330> paint

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600

provides a great metallic effect on it
so<00:01:16.009> much<00:01:16.159> in<00:01:16.369> fact<00:01:16.400> if<00:01:16.970> you<00:01:17.390> were<00:01:17.540> to<00:01:17.659> place

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 
so much in fact if you were to place

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:19.870 
so much in fact if you were to place
this<00:01:18.110> next<00:01:18.470> to<00:01:18.590> its<00:01:18.710> binaltech<00:01:19.130> equivalent

and<00:01:20.060> look<00:01:20.270> at<00:01:20.390> them<00:01:20.509> both<00:01:20.750> you<00:01:21.470> wouldn't

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
and look at them both you wouldn't

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:23.380 
and look at them both you wouldn't
immediately<00:01:22.189> know<00:01:22.670> just<00:01:22.880> the<00:01:22.970> difference

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
immediately know just the difference

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:25.569 
immediately know just the difference

can well what you can see it quite

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.550 
can well what you can see it quite
clearly<00:01:37.130> but<00:01:37.610> there<00:01:38.479> you<00:01:38.600> go

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:52.880

articulation<00:05:06.289> is<00:05:06.440> also<00:05:06.830> very<00:05:07.070> good<00:05:08.919> but<00:05:09.919> are

00:05:10.029 --> 00:05:10.039 
articulation is also very good but are

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:12.250 
articulation is also very good but are
not<00:05:10.190> that<00:05:10.340> obvious<00:05:10.490> at<00:05:10.910> first<00:05:10.940> the<00:05:11.750> head<00:05:12.020> is

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:12.260 
not that obvious at first the head is

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:17.529 
not that obvious at first the head is
also<00:05:12.860> slightly<00:05:13.220> remoulded<00:05:16.150> just<00:05:17.150> to<00:05:17.240> give<00:05:17.389> him

00:05:17.529 --> 00:05:17.539 
also slightly remoulded just to give him

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:23.940 
also slightly remoulded just to give him
some<00:05:17.919> differentiation<00:05:18.919> from<00:05:19.100> smokescreen

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:23.950 

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:25.900 

that's<00:05:24.950> about<00:05:25.220> it<00:05:25.430> really

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:25.910 
that's about it really

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:30.219 
that's about it really
no<00:05:26.750> major<00:05:26.960> flaws<00:05:28.090> although<00:05:29.090> mine<00:05:29.450> came<00:05:29.930> work

00:05:30.219 --> 00:05:30.229 
no major flaws although mine came work

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:33.820 
no major flaws although mine came work
with<00:05:30.710> a<00:05:30.740> mildly<00:05:31.370> loose<00:05:31.820> right<00:05:32.479> arm<00:05:32.830> although

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:33.830 
with a mildly loose right arm although

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:36.960 
with a mildly loose right arm although
I'm<00:05:33.919> sure<00:05:33.979> that's<00:05:34.370> not<00:05:34.520> a<00:05:34.580> worldwide<00:05:35.030> problem

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:36.970 
I'm sure that's not a worldwide problem

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:41.219 
I'm sure that's not a worldwide problem
so<00:05:37.970> the<00:05:38.120> overall<00:05:38.570> mold<00:05:38.990> itself<00:05:39.530> is<00:05:39.889> very<00:05:40.340> good

00:05:41.219 --> 00:05:41.229 
so the overall mold itself is very good

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:44.070 
so the overall mold itself is very good
but<00:05:42.229> if<00:05:42.320> you<00:05:42.440> plan<00:05:42.680> on<00:05:42.710> getting<00:05:42.979> one<00:05:43.430> version

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:44.080 
but if you plan on getting one version

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:47.110 
but if you plan on getting one version
get<00:05:45.080> this<00:05:45.289> one<00:05:45.560> it<00:05:45.800> looks<00:05:46.400> the<00:05:46.550> best<00:05:46.760> I

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:47.120 
get this one it looks the best I

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:52.240 
get this one it looks the best I
strongly<00:05:47.870> recommend<00:05:48.139> this<00:05:48.560> guy<00:05:50.830> I'll<00:05:51.830> be<00:05:51.889> back

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:52.250 
strongly recommend this guy I'll be back

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:56.219 
strongly recommend this guy I'll be back
with<00:05:52.460> a<00:05:52.490> review<00:05:52.940> of<00:05:53.180> my<00:05:53.450> other<00:05:53.990> two<00:05:54.320> alts<00:05:54.770> ASAP

with a review of my other two alts ASAP

00:05:56.229 --> 00:06:01.840 
with a review of my other two alts ASAP
but<00:05:57.229> for<00:05:57.440> now<00:05:57.590> until<00:05:58.370> then<00:05:58.580> till<00:05:59.240> all<00:05:59.450> are<00:05:59.660> one
