some time the fact that the seeking air
mind<00:00:13.469> no<00:00:13.710> longer<00:00:14.040> takes<00:00:14.250> out<00:00:14.400> healers<00:00:14.730> makes<00:00:15.269> a

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
mind no longer takes out healers makes a

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.090 
mind no longer takes out healers makes a
big<00:00:15.750> difference<00:00:16.199> I<00:00:16.289> mean<00:00:16.410> that<00:00:16.560> was<00:00:16.710> just<00:00:16.740> the

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
worst part about dropping healers is

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.230 
worst part about dropping healers is
having<00:00:19.289> them<00:00:19.410> be<00:00:19.560> immediately<00:00:20.160> destroyed<00:00:20.609> so

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
having them be immediately destroyed so

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.730 
having them be immediately destroyed so
