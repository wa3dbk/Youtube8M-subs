00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.440 
5 bucks from the fiber gate so I made
this<00:00:12.150> I<00:00:12.420> call<00:00:13.380> it<00:00:13.530> the<00:00:13.650> 99<00:00:14.190> cent<00:00:14.610> guitar<00:00:15.000> capo

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
of parts to make this thing then I

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.160 
of parts to make this thing then I
figured<00:00:21.060> why<00:00:21.210> not<00:00:21.270> share<00:00:21.660> it<00:00:21.779> with<00:00:21.810> everybody

we're going to set the compass for one

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.690 
we're going to set the compass for one
and<00:01:03.719> a<00:01:03.780> quarter<00:01:04.199> notice<00:01:04.589> I<00:01:04.710> start<00:01:05.040> at<00:01:05.159> one<00:01:05.400> so

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
and a quarter notice I start at one so

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.039 
and a quarter notice I start at one so
even<00:01:06.000> though<00:01:06.119> it<00:01:06.210> says<00:01:06.420> two<00:01:06.630> and<00:01:06.810> a<00:01:06.840> quarter

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
even though it says two and a quarter

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.260 
even though it says two and a quarter
it's<00:01:07.560> actually<00:01:07.979> set<00:01:08.220> at<00:01:08.340> one<00:01:08.580> and<00:01:08.700> a<00:01:08.790> quarter

it's actually set at one and a quarter

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.480 
it's actually set at one and a quarter
I<00:01:09.299> put<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.110> compass<00:01:10.560> point<00:01:10.860> in<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.100> center

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
I put the compass point in the center

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.930 
I put the compass point in the center
and<00:01:11.670> Mark<00:01:12.450> a<00:01:12.630> semicircle

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:16.940 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:18.850 

finish<00:01:17.180> doing<00:01:17.360> that<00:01:17.660> we're<00:01:17.870> going<00:01:18.020> to<00:01:18.320> reset

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:18.860 
finish doing that we're going to reset

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.800 
finish doing that we're going to reset
the<00:01:18.890> compass<00:01:19.430> to<00:01:19.820> one<00:01:20.060> in<00:01:20.180> three-quarter

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
the compass to one in three-quarter

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:22.570 
the compass to one in three-quarter
inches<00:01:21.170> and<00:01:21.800> that's<00:01:21.950> going<00:01:22.130> to<00:01:22.250> give<00:01:22.400> us<00:01:22.550> a

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 
inches and that's going to give us a

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.080 
inches and that's going to give us a
half<00:01:23.540> an<00:01:23.720> inch<00:01:23.840> between<00:01:24.410> those<00:01:24.620> two

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
half an inch between those two

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:30.910 
half an inch between those two
semicircles<00:01:27.220> let's<00:01:28.220> mark<00:01:28.580> that<00:01:29.920> semicircle

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
semicircles let's mark that semicircle

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.950 
semicircles let's mark that semicircle
and<00:01:31.010> now<00:01:31.820> we're<00:01:32.000> going<00:01:32.090> to<00:01:32.180> measure<00:01:32.360> over<00:01:32.750> one

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 
and now we're going to measure over one

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.110 
and now we're going to measure over one
and<00:01:33.080> a<00:01:33.140> half<00:01:33.350> inches<00:01:33.770> and<00:01:34.010> draw<00:01:34.790> a<00:01:34.820> vertical

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:35.120 
and a half inches and draw a vertical

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:36.880 
and a half inches and draw a vertical
line<00:01:35.600> and<00:01:35.870> that's<00:01:36.080> going<00:01:36.290> to<00:01:36.350> be<00:01:36.440> our<00:01:36.590> cut<00:01:36.860> line

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
line and that's going to be our cut line

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.500 
line and that's going to be our cut line
we're<00:01:37.310> going<00:01:37.430> to<00:01:37.520> cut<00:01:37.730> the<00:01:37.880> bottom<00:01:38.030> part<00:01:38.420> of

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:38.510 
we're going to cut the bottom part of

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:42.610 
we're going to cut the bottom part of
the<00:01:38.630> capo<00:01:39.020> from<00:01:39.260> the<00:01:39.410> big<00:01:39.620> piece<00:01:39.860> of<00:01:39.890> wood

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
and on the other end and then I'm going

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.450 
and on the other end and then I'm going
to<00:02:20.390> draw<00:02:20.750> an<00:02:20.870> intersecting<00:02:21.530> line<00:02:22.570> 1/4<00:02:23.570> inch<00:02:23.780> in

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:24.460 
to draw an intersecting line 1/4 inch in

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:26.830

down with the point of my pencil to form
a<00:02:31.250> little<00:02:31.520> dimple<00:02:31.850> so<00:02:32.330> that<00:02:32.510> when<00:02:33.170> I<00:02:33.200> drill<00:02:33.590> it

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:33.740 
a little dimple so that when I drill it

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:35.950 
a little dimple so that when I drill it
in<00:02:33.860> a<00:02:33.950> few<00:02:34.160> minutes<00:02:34.520> the<00:02:35.150> drill<00:02:35.420> won't<00:02:35.660> wander

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:35.960 
in a few minutes the drill won't wander

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.680 
in a few minutes the drill won't wander
across<00:02:36.230> the<00:02:36.680> wood<00:02:36.910> it'll<00:02:37.910> go<00:02:38.120> right<00:02:38.300> into<00:02:38.570> that

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
across the wood it'll go right into that

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.140 
across the wood it'll go right into that
dimple<00:02:38.990> and<00:02:39.320> here<00:02:39.500> we<00:02:39.590> go<00:02:39.740> I<00:02:39.770> have<00:02:39.980> a<00:02:40.040> 1/16<00:02:40.880> inch

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:26.990 
going to enlarge that hole by using a

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:29.410 
going to enlarge that hole by using a
1/8<00:03:27.470> inch<00:03:27.500> drill<00:03:27.860> bit<00:03:28.130> because<00:03:28.940> that's<00:03:29.209> the

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
1/8 inch drill bit because that's the

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.420 
1/8 inch drill bit because that's the
final<00:03:29.900> dimension<00:03:30.410> I<00:03:30.530> actually<00:03:30.740> need<00:03:31.190> in<00:03:31.340> the

bottom of the cave up there do it on one
side<00:03:35.300> and<00:03:35.630> then<00:03:36.560> I<00:03:36.650> do<00:03:36.709> it<00:03:36.830> on<00:03:37.040> the<00:03:37.160> other<00:03:37.190> side

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630 
side and then I do it on the other side

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.330 
side and then I do it on the other side
now<00:03:38.630> in<00:03:38.780> order<00:03:38.959> to<00:03:39.080> thread<00:03:39.500> the<00:03:39.650> screw<00:03:39.770> in<00:03:40.130> that

and see I've done that there and there's

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.469 
and see I've done that there and there's
the<00:04:33.259> head<00:04:33.410> that<00:04:33.620> I<00:04:33.650> just<00:04:33.919> cut<00:04:34.160> off<00:04:34.190> and<00:04:34.610> there's

the head that I just cut off and there's
the<00:04:35.660> screws<00:04:36.220> but<00:04:37.220> the<00:04:37.340> process<00:04:37.759> of<00:04:37.849> cutting

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.060 
the screws but the process of cutting

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:41.200 
the screws but the process of cutting
those<00:04:38.389> heads<00:04:38.660> up<00:04:38.870> cause<00:04:39.259> little<00:04:40.030> jaggies<00:04:41.030> on

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.210

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:43.200 
those heads up cause little jaggies on
the<00:04:41.449> edge<00:04:41.599> of<00:04:41.780> the<00:04:41.900> screw<00:04:42.169> so<00:04:42.319> I<00:04:42.380> use<00:04:42.560> a<00:04:42.590> file<00:04:42.979> to

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210 
the edge of the screw so I use a file to

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:45.999 
the edge of the screw so I use a file to
file<00:04:44.210> that<00:04:44.419> off<00:04:44.599> until<00:04:44.870> I<00:04:45.110> can<00:04:45.440> put<00:04:45.710> the<00:04:45.830> wig

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:52.280 
go on easy using the semicircles that I

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:55.029 
go on easy using the semicircles that I
drew<00:04:52.580> before<00:04:52.759> I<00:04:53.270> cut<00:04:53.780> off<00:04:53.930> the<00:04:54.080> excess<00:04:54.440> parts
