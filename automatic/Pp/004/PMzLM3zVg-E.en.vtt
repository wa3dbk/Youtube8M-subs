the bathroom so it's a mirror shot it's
a<00:00:41.649> tricky<00:00:41.979> shot<00:00:42.010> because<00:00:42.399> what<00:00:43.149> we<00:00:43.269> shoot<00:00:43.539> in

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:43.749 
a tricky shot because what we shoot in

00:00:43.749 --> 00:00:46.739 
a tricky shot because what we shoot in
James<00:00:44.170> is<00:00:44.289> back<00:00:44.409> then<00:00:44.589> we<00:00:44.679> have<00:00:44.769> to<00:00:44.829> flip<00:00:45.749> so

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:46.749 
James is back then we have to flip so

00:00:46.749 --> 00:00:48.869 
James is back then we have to flip so
that<00:00:46.899> it<00:00:47.019> looks<00:00:47.199> like<00:00:47.379> when<00:00:47.920> Amy<00:00:48.190> closes<00:00:48.729> the

00:00:48.869 --> 00:00:48.879 
that it looks like when Amy closes the

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:51.049 
that it looks like when Amy closes the
mirror<00:00:49.239> I<00:00:49.389> show<00:00:49.780> up<00:00:49.899> on<00:00:50.049> the<00:00:50.139> other<00:00:50.319> side<00:00:50.530> I

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
mirror I show up on the other side I

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.750 
mirror I show up on the other side I
chasing<00:00:52.059> you<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:53.379> concept<00:00:53.889> of<00:00:54.069> this<00:00:54.249> music

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:54.760 
chasing you the concept of this music

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.289 
chasing you the concept of this music
video<00:00:55.089> is<00:00:55.600> split<00:00:56.499> screen<00:00:56.829> so<00:00:57.249> basically<00:00:57.909> we

00:00:58.289 --> 00:00:58.299 
video is split screen so basically we

00:00:58.299 --> 00:01:01.319 
video is split screen so basically we
travel<00:00:58.899> Aras<00:00:59.289> and<00:00:59.530> Amy<00:01:00.159> you<00:01:00.699> know<00:01:00.850> throughout

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:01.329 
travel Aras and Amy you know throughout

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:03.689 
travel Aras and Amy you know throughout
their<00:01:01.569> day<00:01:01.600> doing<00:01:02.589> the<00:01:02.829> exact<00:01:03.100> same<00:01:03.129> things

00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:03.699 
their day doing the exact same things

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:05.940 
their day doing the exact same things
but<00:01:03.969> in<00:01:04.119> two<00:01:04.299> different<00:01:04.479> locations<00:01:04.659> and<00:01:05.590> then

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:05.950 
but in two different locations and then

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.670 
but in two different locations and then
on<00:01:06.159> the<00:01:06.400> screen<00:01:06.700> were<00:01:07.110> spliced<00:01:08.110> and<00:01:08.410> put

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:08.680 
on the screen were spliced and put

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.200 
on the screen were spliced and put
together<00:01:08.860> so<00:01:09.370> they<00:01:09.490> look<00:01:09.730> like<00:01:09.760> they<00:01:10.120> match<00:01:10.390> up

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
together so they look like they match up

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.280 
together so they look like they match up
gosh<00:01:13.210> we've<00:01:13.480> been<00:01:13.510> working<00:01:13.750> on<00:01:13.930> this<00:01:14.050> video

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:14.290

than<00:01:17.440> that<00:01:17.560> I<00:01:17.770> came<00:01:18.010> up<00:01:18.130> with<00:01:18.250> the<00:01:18.310> concept<00:01:18.490> for

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
than that I came up with the concept for

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.090 
than that I came up with the concept for
the<00:01:18.970> video<00:01:19.060> about<00:01:19.420> five<00:01:19.750> months<00:01:19.990> ago<00:01:20.200> and<00:01:20.590> then

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
the video about five months ago and then

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.550 
the video about five months ago and then

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:23.560 
it took about two months to storyboarded

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.260 
it took about two months to storyboarded
it's<00:01:23.710> a<00:01:23.800> complex<00:01:24.160> video<00:01:24.490> it's<00:01:24.820> a<00:01:24.910> split<00:01:25.180> screen

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270
