 equal ask the viewer to choose any 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:35.399
 deck for example choose this one 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:38.489
 green we postpone 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.920
 with her nothing to ask the viewer under 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.899

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.999
 and memorize and top or I cover to 

00:00:45.929 --> 00:00:51.389
 we do not believe at this time we can 

00:00:47.999 --> 00:00:54.510
 turn away we can watch us nothing 

00:00:51.389 --> 00:00:58.799

 deck and you see what we have 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.190

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.050
 some points rewind 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:18.510
 since this is your boredom 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:23.420
 Completely however, two decks turn over 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:23.420

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:55.359

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.750
 carefully we got to these cards this 

00:01:55.359 --> 00:02:03.610
 map where the viewer and chose 10 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:09.310
 Baba look here we turn and 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:09.849
 here is similar to 10 in both and so ask 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.370
 you 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:15.989
 Well, after the deck please our two 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.989
 10 buddhas have gone 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:50.200
 all completely two different decks and here 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:53.680
 our greatest coincidences that is what 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:56.709
 focus frequency the viewer takes picks 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:59.829
 any card that is, he raises it himself 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:01.620
 the most interesting green deck we 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:04.629
 do nothing that is we cannot 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:08.560
 fine-tune and this is not the real frequency 

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:12.099
 the focus of the match is one hundred percent simple 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:14.109
 focus music break everyone thanks for 

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:16.620
