00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:10.349
 hello backstage finally we are back 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.330
 At home in our home office 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.190
 on the roof terrace where just great 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.000
 weather is before and what we are 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.529
 now look here 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.970
 that is where it ends 615 on the 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.400
 at first sight it looks like in 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.189
 standard android phone is actually 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.019
 Two things also make it interesting 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.580
 the first only so half that is a quad 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.579
 core cpus you have in the second umso 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.719
 More is the cheapest quadcore 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:35.100
 Android smartphone what is currently on the 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.350
 Market gives noncommittal 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.059
 Price recommendation of the 299 euro that is 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.360
 it will probably be relatively fast 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.700
 Well, let's say 250 to 270 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.530
 to be available in euros and thus undercuts 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.969
 it's all what the market at quad core 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.640
 Fund currently has to offer 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:53.460
 despite the cheap price is that the 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.949
 615 not at first glance 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.410
 absolute cheapheimer make out because 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.120
 no plastic bags surface here 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.160
 but at least a rubberized 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.600
 Battery cover made of plastic of course 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.909
 frame is made of plastic but the glass 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.610
 at least as if it were here 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.650
 real glass at second glance is 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.720
 Of course, it can be really high quality 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.369
 a device with this equipment too 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.409
 not be this price or it can 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.500
 at least not feel that way and that 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.509
 you also notice the g 615 that here 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.460
 just does not feel like meyer 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.619
 its an iphone or some time 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.689
 other smartphone with metal case and 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.460
 metal frame and so on but one 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.350
 just notice here then must somehow 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.170
 which places will be saved that sees 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.479
 One feels the housing one feels 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.680
 it's just it's okay that you can 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.840
 they are not known to us complain 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.520
 that now it would be the total scrap 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.070
 but it's just simply a 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.810
 Tumbled 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:48.740
 if we get that in detail times 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:53.939
 we have here a 4 5 inches 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:55.140
 large lcd ips panel with 720 x 1280 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.479
 pixel resolution 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.780
 this roughly corresponds to that of the lg 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.420
 optimus 2x hd 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.950
 7 inch display with same resolution 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.960
 And that's also the price 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.940
 the next competitor was the display 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.740
 just then noticed when I 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.540
 Display brightness very high and regular 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:14.120
 a dark image representative 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.590
 because I already notice the contrast hz 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.989
 what is black no longer black 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.910
 but simply on it too 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:23.270
 camera comes the similarity to the lg 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:25.340
 optimus 4x hd definitely to the fore 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:28.190
 here as there we have an 8 megapixel 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.440
 Camera with photo led with the possibility 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.640
 to record full hd videos 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.739
 besides we have here on the 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.739
 front still a second camera with 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:40.610
 1.3 megapixel resolution takes videos 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:43.070
 only in 27 p on the remaining equipment 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:45.260
 meets the standard of cheap 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:47.360
 quad-core phones or what 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:50.330
 half an year ago, absolute 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:52.480
 Upper class was at 1 gigabyte ram 8 gb 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.680
 In addition, there is a micro sd 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:58.040
 Memory card slot to expand the 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:00.380
 Battery of smg 615 is at first 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:04.570
 look only minimally more than that of the e 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:07.100
 4x hd of 2230 milliamp hours 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:10.579
 but a small trap is there 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:13.459
 here we have 4.35 volt defense system 3.8 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:16.070
 volt of the lg battery and that is the 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:17.989
 capacity of this power storage then 

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:19.610
 but much higher than that in the 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:23.150
 Practice has an impact on us 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:25.400
 but still found on the g 615 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:27.350
 currently runs android 4.0 and 

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.090
 surprisingly with a vanilla 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:31.040
 surface is not here yet 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.640
 that way own user interface to 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.769
 commitment 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:36.170
 after all, the good news in march 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:40.239
 otherwise an update on jenny like android 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:43.070
 4.1 are some of the most exciting questions 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:44.750
 year 650 is probably the actual 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:45.140
 performance of the processor we know 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:48.109
 beautiful 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:49.130
 that came for example already at the way it is the 

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:50.959
 Quad for use 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:53.329
 and also at the 10 inch media 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:54.799
 tablet of Chinese manufacturer and 

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:57.230
 measured in the benchmarks we got ourselves 

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:59.600
 for example the antique market and the 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:01.970
 looked at quadrant there it is from the 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:05.150
 readings about what the lg 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:06.630
 optimus 2x hd with his tegra 3 too 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:09.340
 has to offer 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:11.680
 where planed will fall, however, too 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:14.980
 chips and as with the other quadcore 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:19.390
 equipment will also be that was sng 615 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:22.510
 under full load quite warm when we are 

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:24.340
 us that there are 615 more to watch the first one 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:26.620
 what stands out is the shape is a 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:28.630
 Let's say weird that 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.490
 phones not part now more detailed 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:32.860
 as possible, look at this page 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:35.140
 it's going to be apart it's going to be up 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:36.940
 narrow at the top and lower at the bottom 

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:38.350
 down together again this is not a 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.240
 big problem is just a bit 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:40.480
 unusual feels a bit strange 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.300
 on 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:44.710
 but it does not bother us all the time 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.510
 elements in detail we have on the 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:48.550
 top the 3.5 millimeters 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:50.950
 jack socket for a headset or from 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:53.470
 standard headphones core of the page above 

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:55.419
 on the right side a key below it 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:56.020
 rocker switch to regulate the 

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:58.930
 volume 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:00.880
 Here it might be a button to give a 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:02.140
 trigger for the camera that has been 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.730
 Saved in this case 

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:06.130
 on the bottom we have one 

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:08.410
 microphone and on the left side of the device 

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:11.140
 a micro USB socket to the transfer 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:13.150
 of data and to recharge the battery 

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:15.610
 on the back we still have here 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:18.250
 housed the speaker and there 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:21.900
 above the camera a second 

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:24.669
 microphone for active noise reduction 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:27.070
 under the dash you can say the g60 with 

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:28.960
 15 makes the quadcore suitable for mass 

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:30.850
 much power to such a low one 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:32.800
 price that is not available anywhere else 

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:34.240
 and when performance is more important than 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:37.320
 Haptics and design there you can 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.320
 strike without hesitation
