00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:12.309
 santander is the bank that most invests 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.799
 universities in the world and to open 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:17.500
 even more possibilities in the universe 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:20.109
 we created the university card 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:22.119
 an agile and secure tool that unites 

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:24.550
 academic and financial functions 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:26.830
 the university card has several 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:28.630
 features that make life easier 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:31.779
 inside university 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:33.460
 just look at the university card he 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:35.590
 allows a set of functionalities 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:39.030
 ranging from access to 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:39.030
 campus campus parking 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.390
 the removal of books from a 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:56.720
 more automated way in the library 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.720
 campus 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:03.360
 and also allows students to keep 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.360
 your belongings in the storeroom 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.630
 Another important point is that the student 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.510
 you can use the university card 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.550
 as debit card is current 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.500
 circular can you sang university 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:18.570
 in your account by completing this in 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.720
 view are two less cards in the 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.720
 Wallet 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.689
 I think it's fantastic to be part of a 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.990
 a university that invests in technology and 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:38.759
 innovation and today through the 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.399
 of uff with santander I can say 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.049
 here my card and allows 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:45.409
 Let's go out to dinner every day at 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.409
 tray 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.720
 I also integrate with the 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.520
 public transportation 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.520
 take the boat bus and subway 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.250
 if I needed to buy the ticket before 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:04.110
 There are a thousand cards to do it today. 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.110
 I do everything with a wallet in action 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.810
 The partnership with usp has been 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:18.910
 fully aligned with the priorities 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.230
 of santander bank in the world that I support 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:22.690
 higher education comes from 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:25.060
 consolidating every day in 2010 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:27.040
 the good set with uff implemented the 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.319
 fourth universities participate in 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.780
 delivery of these cards allows us to 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:33.790
 rapid growth of our base is a 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.720
 concrete example is our agency. 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.370
 unisinos 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.010
 today we have more than five thousand 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.000
 cardholders from the card 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.310
 university 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.069
 This has been very good, very positive. 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.360
 for the community as a whole and has 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:47.380
 has been very zealous has been very 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.420
 efficient 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.459
 the implementation of the process and 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.980
 commercial view but the oversight 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:55.599
 regional INCRA we are enjoying 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:58.420
 intensely this opportunity to 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:03:00.519
 present the strength of the santander brand and 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.200
 financial services a community 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:04.209
 which is a reference in teaching 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.849
 Top in Brazil, we can 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:09.370
 evolve along with these university students 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:12.220
 because we follow life 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:14.709

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.319
 to offer 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:25.570
 another initiative that generated the value of this 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:28.000
 partnership between santander was the creation 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:29.710
 of the observatory which aims at 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.950
 develop research on new 

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:35.830

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.990

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:42.730
 also generates academic enrichment 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:44.380
