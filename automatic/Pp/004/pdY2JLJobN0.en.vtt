essentially<00:03:43.440> I<00:03:43.620> really<00:03:43.949> liked<00:03:44.160> what<00:03:44.400> this<00:03:44.549> app

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:44.699 
essentially I really liked what this app

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:46.400 
essentially I really liked what this app
had<00:03:44.910> to<00:03:45.060> offer<00:03:45.209> I<00:03:45.449> think<00:03:45.629> it's<00:03:45.930> a<00:03:45.989> great<00:03:46.139> way<00:03:46.379> to

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
had to offer I think it's a great way to

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:47.869 
had to offer I think it's a great way to
learn<00:03:46.709> about<00:03:46.889> animals<00:03:47.340> if<00:03:47.459> you're<00:03:47.579> a<00:03:47.609> small

00:03:47.869 --> 00:03:47.879 
learn about animals if you're a small

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:50.629 
learn about animals if you're a small
child<00:03:47.910> although<00:03:48.690> I<00:03:48.870> do<00:03:49.019> agree<00:03:49.410> with<00:03:49.739> the<00:03:49.919> age

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:50.639 
child although I do agree with the age

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:52.220 
child although I do agree with the age
group<00:03:51.030> on<00:03:51.209> this<00:03:51.389> I<00:03:51.540> think<00:03:51.599> should<00:03:51.900> only<00:03:52.049> be

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
group on this I think should only be

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.800 
group on this I think should only be
good<00:03:52.349> for<00:03:52.410> children<00:03:52.799> about<00:03:53.250> 1<00:03:53.489> to<00:03:53.639> 5<00:03:53.910> I<00:03:54.239> don't

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
good for children about 1 to 5 I don't

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:56.809 
good for children about 1 to 5 I don't
know<00:03:54.930> how<00:03:55.230> much<00:03:55.410> interest<00:03:55.650> older<00:03:56.489> children

00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:56.819 
know how much interest older children

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:58.129 
know how much interest older children
are<00:03:56.909> going<00:03:57.000> to<00:03:57.120> have<00:03:57.359> in<00:03:57.510> this<00:03:57.629> that's<00:03:57.870> one<00:03:58.049> of

00:03:58.129 --> 00:03:58.139 
are going to have in this that's one of

00:03:58.139 --> 00:03:59.599 
are going to have in this that's one of
my<00:03:58.230> complaints<00:03:58.709> of<00:03:58.799> the<00:03:58.829> app<00:03:59.010> although<00:03:59.280> it's

00:03:59.599 --> 00:03:59.609 
my complaints of the app although it's

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:01.909 
my complaints of the app although it's
not<00:03:59.790> so<00:04:00.030> much<00:04:00.150> a<00:04:00.209> complaint<00:04:00.780> as<00:04:00.959> more<00:04:01.739> of<00:04:01.829> a

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:01.919 
not so much a complaint as more of a

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:04.009 
not so much a complaint as more of a
caution<00:04:02.579> if<00:04:03.269> you're<00:04:03.449> going<00:04:03.720> to<00:04:03.810> interest

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:04.019 
caution if you're going to interest

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:05.869 
caution if you're going to interest
maybe<00:04:04.290> slightly<00:04:04.919> older<00:04:05.340> children

00:04:05.869 --> 00:04:05.879 
maybe slightly older children

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:08.689 
maybe slightly older children
I<00:04:05.909> might<00:04:06.510> have<00:04:06.780> say<00:04:07.169> a<00:04:07.199> little<00:04:07.980> bit<00:04:08.129> more<00:04:08.190> extra

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:08.699 
I might have say a little bit more extra

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:10.520 
I might have say a little bit more extra
information<00:04:08.909> about<00:04:09.299> each<00:04:09.690> animal<00:04:10.139> such<00:04:10.349> as

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
information about each animal such as

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:11.719 
information about each animal such as
where<00:04:10.739> they<00:04:10.889> live

00:04:11.719 --> 00:04:11.729 
where they live

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:13.309 
where they live
perhaps<00:04:12.389> what<00:04:12.540> they<00:04:12.629> eat<00:04:12.780> things<00:04:13.019> like<00:04:13.079> that

00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:13.319 
perhaps what they eat things like that

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:14.629 
perhaps what they eat things like that
but<00:04:13.500> then<00:04:13.650> again<00:04:13.769> if<00:04:14.010> that's<00:04:14.190> not<00:04:14.340> the<00:04:14.549> age

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:14.639 
but then again if that's not the age

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:16.819 
but then again if that's not the age
group<00:04:14.909> they're<00:04:15.150> going<00:04:15.180> for<00:04:15.750> I'd<00:04:16.199> say<00:04:16.440> leave<00:04:16.650> it

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:16.829 
group they're going for I'd say leave it

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:19.719 
group they're going for I'd say leave it
but<00:04:17.099> like<00:04:17.609> I<00:04:17.729> said<00:04:17.909> definitely<00:04:18.239> age<00:04:18.659> 1<00:04:18.989> to<00:04:19.019> 5

00:04:19.719 --> 00:04:19.729 
but like I said definitely age 1 to 5

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:23.330 
but like I said definitely age 1 to 5
however<00:04:20.729> the<00:04:20.970> design<00:04:21.269> of<00:04:21.419> this<00:04:21.570> is<00:04:22.340> extremely

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:23.340 
however the design of this is extremely

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:24.890 
however the design of this is extremely
complementary<00:04:23.849> to<00:04:24.120> the<00:04:24.270> age<00:04:24.389> group<00:04:24.659> in<00:04:24.810> the

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
complementary to the age group in the

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.089 
complementary to the age group in the
sense<00:04:25.139> that<00:04:25.229> you<00:04:25.440> have<00:04:25.469> these<00:04:25.650> gigantic

00:04:26.089 --> 00:04:26.099 
sense that you have these gigantic

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:27.230 
sense that you have these gigantic
buttons<00:04:26.520> that<00:04:26.669> are<00:04:26.729> very

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
buttons that are very

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.939 
buttons that are very
child<00:04:27.360> friendly<00:04:27.750> very<00:04:28.020> easy<00:04:28.169> to<00:04:28.349> press<00:04:28.620> and

00:04:28.939 --> 00:04:28.949 
child friendly very easy to press and

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:31.370 
child friendly very easy to press and
likewise<00:04:29.900> controlling<00:04:30.900> the<00:04:30.990> app<00:04:31.139> is<00:04:31.319> very

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
likewise controlling the app is very

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:34.219 
likewise controlling the app is very
simple<00:04:31.889> as<00:04:31.979> well<00:04:32.300> to<00:04:33.300> us<00:04:33.389> adults<00:04:33.810> this<00:04:33.960> looks

00:04:34.219 --> 00:04:34.229 
simple as well to us adults this looks

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:35.900 
simple as well to us adults this looks
kind<00:04:34.530> of<00:04:34.650> simple<00:04:35.069> in<00:04:35.190> fact<00:04:35.430> I<00:04:35.550> mean<00:04:35.669> now<00:04:35.789> it's

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:35.910 
kind of simple in fact I mean now it's

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:36.980 
kind of simple in fact I mean now it's
essentially<00:04:36.300> just<00:04:36.360> a<00:04:36.539> collection<00:04:36.780> of

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
essentially just a collection of

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:38.990 
essentially just a collection of
pictures<00:04:37.169> and<00:04:37.440> sounds<00:04:37.889> but<00:04:38.460> to<00:04:38.610> any<00:04:38.759> child

pictures and sounds but to any child

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.430 
pictures and sounds but to any child
this<00:04:39.210> is<00:04:39.330> going<00:04:39.509> to<00:04:39.569> be<00:04:39.660> very<00:04:39.870> intuitive<00:04:40.139> and

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:40.440 
this is going to be very intuitive and

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.070 
this is going to be very intuitive and
very<00:04:40.650> fun<00:04:40.830> to<00:04:40.949> use<00:04:40.979> and<00:04:41.430> user<00:04:42.419> reviews<00:04:42.900> are

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 
very fun to use and user reviews are

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.200 
very fun to use and user reviews are

review<00:05:02.159> so<00:05:02.400> to<00:05:02.460> speak<00:05:02.759> I<00:05:02.940> do<00:05:03.479> like<00:05:03.750> what<00:05:03.870> this

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:04.020 
review so to speak I do like what this

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:05.600 
review so to speak I do like what this
has<00:05:04.199> to<00:05:04.229> offer<00:05:04.380> and<00:05:04.680> like<00:05:04.800> I<00:05:04.919> said<00:05:04.979> though<00:05:05.460> it

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:05.610 
has to offer and like I said though it

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:07.370 
has to offer and like I said though it
is<00:05:05.729> age<00:05:06.000> limited<00:05:06.539> I<00:05:06.720> think<00:05:06.930> if<00:05:07.050> you<00:05:07.169> have<00:05:07.349> a

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:07.380 
is age limited I think if you have a

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:08.629 
is age limited I think if you have a
child<00:05:07.620> in<00:05:07.800> the<00:05:07.860> appropriate<00:05:08.250> age<00:05:08.370> group

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:08.639 
child in the appropriate age group

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:10.149 
child in the appropriate age group

they'll absolutely love this and

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:12.170 
they'll absolutely love this and
presumably<00:05:11.159> they'll<00:05:11.430> love<00:05:11.580> the<00:05:11.699> dogs<00:05:11.880> more
