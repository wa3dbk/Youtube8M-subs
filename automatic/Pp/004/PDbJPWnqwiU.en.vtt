00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:56.510

 esika Latvian valdis himself chooses his nickname quoted text is plastic with the 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:22.910
 what to expect 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:25.910
 this is contradicted in any bazaar 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.270
 and it's worth 75 cents worth then full and without the pot 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.850
 to make almonds to the top 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.720
 and after echaíz 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.760
 two or three droplets 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.700
 decency dk 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.380
 echaíz two or three droplets float rays of an essence the first we start crown 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:50.810
 we drop teachers droplets we close it and we move saleh so that it mixes well 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.840
 still essential with the oil and that is that we expose the other two or three droplets I'll 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.120
 to those affected and we return to shake vale 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:03.690

 these aromas we could also use 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.930
 other essential oils that we like mixing the platform in which they remain in 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.690
 and I think it's a good option to apply to our children because their 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:23.039
 natural 

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:28.189

 ee it's good what happens is that I found out that it has derivatives of 

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:35.879
