00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:41.410 
tutorial on how to do here we go by
learning<00:00:07.620> Lantis<00:00:08.250> and<00:00:08.900> this<00:00:09.900> is<00:00:10.019> a<00:00:10.139> start<00:00:10.410> off

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:41.420 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.520 

even<00:00:42.420> quite<00:00:42.570> a<00:00:42.600> bit<00:00:42.719> kept<00:00:42.840> in<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.079> first<00:00:43.290> part

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
even quite a bit kept in the first part

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:53.940 
even quite a bit kept in the first part
and<00:00:43.850> finally<00:00:44.850> get<00:00:44.969> something<00:00:45.120> doing<00:00:45.360> this

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:53.950 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:01:13.660 

which<00:00:54.950> is<00:00:59.680> 5<00:01:00.680> 3<00:01:01.100> 5<00:01:02.320> 2<00:01:04.480> tt<00:01:12.280> that's<00:01:13.280> that<00:01:13.430> first

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 
which is 5 3 5 2 tt that's that first

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:29.520 
which is 5 3 5 2 tt that's that first
part<00:01:13.940> and<00:01:14.120> then<00:01:14.240> it<00:01:14.390> changes

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:29.530 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:35.560 

so<00:01:30.530> just<00:01:30.710> adding<00:01:30.950> that<00:01:31.100> bill<00:01:31.220> in<00:01:31.280> the<00:01:31.340> end<00:01:34.570> so

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570 
so just adding that bill in the end so

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:47.820 
so just adding that bill in the end so
one<00:01:35.810> next<00:01:36.049> one<00:01:36.380> on<00:01:36.500> the<00:01:36.590> end<00:01:36.710> as<00:01:36.830> well<00:01:36.979> of<00:01:37.250> that

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:47.830 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:53.350 

and<00:01:48.830> then<00:01:49.070> he<00:01:49.340> goes<00:01:49.520> into<00:01:49.700> there<00:01:52.180> which<00:01:53.180> is<00:01:53.330> the

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.360 
and then he goes into there which is the

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.330 
and then he goes into there which is the
next<00:01:53.600> string<00:01:53.810> up<00:01:53.960> they're<00:01:54.890> doing<00:01:55.070> the<00:01:55.130> same

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
next string up they're doing the same

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:12.340 
next string up they're doing the same
similar<00:01:56.300> pattern<00:02:10.330> completely<00:02:11.330> for<00:02:12.020> the<00:02:12.110> next

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350 
similar pattern completely for the next

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.140 
similar pattern completely for the next
part<00:02:12.680> it<00:02:12.770> gives<00:02:12.920> him<00:02:12.980> city<00:02:13.250> it's<00:02:13.400> the<00:02:13.550> main<00:02:13.820> the

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
part it gives him city it's the main the

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:34.580 
part it gives him city it's the main the
chorus

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:44.619 

that's

00:02:44.619 --> 00:02:44.629 

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:51.090 

let's<00:02:45.629> slide<00:02:45.900> down

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:03:01.160 

and<00:02:51.970> then<00:02:52.870> 78

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:41.320 

and<00:03:02.170> then<00:03:02.260> goes<00:03:02.410> on<00:03:02.590> to<00:03:02.620> some<00:03:03.160> heavy<00:03:03.640> bit

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:41.330 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:04:00.000 

that's<00:03:42.330> that<00:03:42.480> bit<00:03:42.890> and<00:03:43.890> it<00:03:44.040> goes<00:03:44.250> round<00:03:44.370> again

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.010 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:03.000 

plaintiff<00:04:00.670> is<00:04:00.760> reading<00:04:01.410> that<00:04:02.410> is<00:04:02.470> that<00:04:02.739> again

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.010 
plaintiff is reading that is that again

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:06.479 
plaintiff is reading that is that again
