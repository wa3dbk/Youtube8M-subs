00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 and people pass video videos I'll talk 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.080
 for you here as we make a 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.990
 pet bottle trap plant picking 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.150
 it's baits in case do not stop and other fish 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.030
 where you can enter 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.039
 From this hole here are then the materials 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.539
 that you are already using to do this 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.880
 trap will be a pet bottle of 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.859
 three liters preferably in color 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.289
 transparent that will not scare the 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.480
 bugs because if you would do with the 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.090
 family of another color may be 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.859
 planting them and they may not come 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.559
 to enter into our hole 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:37.170
 ok so here the simple system 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.360
 do you will make a small hole 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.850
 here in the home of the bottle about a 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:46.590
 her friend but life more or less two 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:48.390
 tall fingers and other 3 finger width 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:52.770
 can be even a smaller hole 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:55.199
 and then down here to grab 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:01:00.030
 We 're already making the pest holes. 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:02.219
 there're actually want to identify 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.260
 our bottle she will choose 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.720
 no it will not take as on date then 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.409
 make several holes there only for water 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.340
 to run 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:13.439
 enough and our last step in 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:17.850
 on top of our bottle that will be 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.930
 voting is our line where there is a 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.280
 bottle cap 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.979
 we will give a north when the 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.290
 laps pull and the other end loose there 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:29.009
 upon not to run risk of 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:31.470
 bursting there is bursting 9 there the nets 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.450
 making your personal note there will be left 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.689
 a little of it and that line after you 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.340
 engage in a piece of struggle 'whoever 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.770
 compliance may vary according to 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.500
 own local community that you are 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:46.259
 using your trap is important 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.390
 also a tip is you use this 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:51.630
 trap but it does not leave much time 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:54.270
 it is in the water because the fish there 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:57.030
 can come in and out quickly 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.799
 so you boot into the bottom of the water left 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.509
 the two minutes and costs back 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.000
 're the tips we will be 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:05.250

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.090

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:13.560
 humble bread ration and other tips're there 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:16.440
 to you piece of meat that is 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.870
 the call there the lambaris was only 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.450
 Here is another tip for you is for you 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:24.180
 here make these holes a form 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:27.810
 It's very easy there to get a nail to heat up. 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.430
 He's going to take the pliers and retake it. 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:33.030
 it's very simple 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:36.090
 okay I gave a problem because if you ta 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:38.340
 is making a knife is a nail you 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:42.989
 may be hurting and the hole does not 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:45.269
 it stays so perfect so good 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:46.739
 So basically, that's it. 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:48.900
