you to get into the headphone jack then

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.340 
you to get into the headphone jack then
on<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.340> bottom<00:01:32.579> you'll<00:01:32.909> see<00:01:33.000> cutouts<00:01:33.570> just

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
on the bottom you'll see cutouts just

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.080 
on the bottom you'll see cutouts just
perfectly<00:01:34.740> placed<00:01:35.130> so<00:01:35.369> you<00:01:35.430> can<00:01:35.670> still<00:01:35.880> get

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
perfectly placed so you can still get

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.069 
perfectly placed so you can still get
into<00:01:36.450> your<00:01:37.310> micro<00:01:38.310> USB<00:01:38.670> charging<00:01:39.119> port<00:01:39.420> on<00:01:39.930> the

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
into your micro USB charging port on the

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.140 
into your micro USB charging port on the
other<00:01:40.229> side<00:01:40.470> it's<00:01:40.770> just<00:01:41.070> plain<00:01:41.460> flat<00:01:41.820> since

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
other side it's just plain flat since

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.370 
other side it's just plain flat since
there's<00:01:42.299> nothing<00:01:42.420> on<00:01:42.720> that<00:01:42.840> side<00:01:43.079> other<00:01:43.320> than

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
there's nothing on that side other than

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.260 
there's nothing on that side other than
your<00:01:43.680> sim<00:01:44.159> tray<00:01:44.520> but<00:01:44.729> you<00:01:44.820> shouldn't<00:01:45.060> need<00:01:45.149> to

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
your sim tray but you shouldn't need to

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.630 
your sim tray but you shouldn't need to
access<00:01:45.420> that<00:01:45.869> all<00:01:46.159> access<00:01:47.159> that<00:01:47.310> all<00:01:47.460> that

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
access that all access that all that

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.999 
access that all access that all that
often<00:01:47.850> so<00:01:48.090> uh<00:01:48.299> no<00:01:48.899> need<00:01:49.079> for<00:01:49.290> a<00:01:49.320> cut<00:01:49.590> out<00:01:49.710> there

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
often so uh no need for a cut out there

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.210 
often so uh no need for a cut out there
so<00:01:50.549> in<00:01:51.030> hand<00:01:51.329> definitely<00:01:52.170> feels<00:01:52.530> like<00:01:52.920> it<00:01:53.100> was

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
so in hand definitely feels like it was

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.819 
so in hand definitely feels like it was
perfectly<00:01:53.880> made<00:01:54.270> for<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:54.930> Moto<00:01:55.110> X<00:01:55.320> obviously

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
perfectly made for the Moto X obviously

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.789 
perfectly made for the Moto X obviously
it<00:01:55.890> was<00:01:56.100> but<00:01:56.430> it<00:01:56.509> sort<00:01:57.509> of<00:01:57.540> has<00:01:57.750> that<00:01:57.780> same<00:01:58.380> feel

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
it was but it sort of has that same feel

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.170 
it was but it sort of has that same feel
that<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.130> Moto<00:01:59.310> X<00:01:59.520> does<00:01:59.759> that<00:01:59.939> sort<00:02:00.090> of

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
that the Moto X does that sort of

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.030 
that the Moto X does that sort of
rounded<00:02:00.869> feel<00:02:01.170> so<00:02:01.409> when<00:02:01.530> you're<00:02:01.649> holding<00:02:01.950> at

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
rounded feel so when you're holding at

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.429 
rounded feel so when you're holding at
hand<00:02:02.340> i<00:02:03.030> will<00:02:03.509> say<00:02:03.689> that<00:02:03.719> adds<00:02:03.990> a<00:02:04.140> little<00:02:04.320> bit

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
hand i will say that adds a little bit

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.340 
hand i will say that adds a little bit
of<00:02:04.560> bulk<00:02:04.890> and<00:02:05.159> uh<00:02:05.570> not<00:02:06.570> sure<00:02:06.630> if<00:02:06.869> you<00:02:06.990> guys<00:02:07.110> can

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
of bulk and uh not sure if you guys can

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.960 
of bulk and uh not sure if you guys can
see<00:02:07.560> this<00:02:07.680> or<00:02:07.829> not<00:02:07.950> but<00:02:08.009> it<00:02:08.220> is<00:02:08.340> kind<00:02:08.759> of<00:02:08.879> a

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
see this or not but it is kind of a

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.850 
see this or not but it is kind of a
thick<00:02:09.239> case<00:02:09.569> mocking<00:02:10.050> alive<00:02:10.319> should<00:02:10.709> offer

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
thick case mocking alive should offer

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.540 
thick case mocking alive should offer
you<00:02:11.099> quite<00:02:11.730> a<00:02:11.760> bit<00:02:11.849> of<00:02:12.000> protection

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
you quite a bit of protection

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.040 
you quite a bit of protection
actually<00:02:12.760> if<00:02:12.850> you<00:02:12.970> drop<00:02:13.270> this<00:02:13.480> sucker<00:02:13.750> and<00:02:13.960> you

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
actually if you drop this sucker and you

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:15.660 
actually if you drop this sucker and you
can<00:02:14.140> see<00:02:14.260> does<00:02:14.440> cover<00:02:14.680> all<00:02:14.920> the<00:02:15.040> corners<00:02:15.460> so<00:02:15.610> if

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
can see does cover all the corners so if

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.730 
can see does cover all the corners so if
you<00:02:15.760> corner<00:02:16.000> drop<00:02:16.330> you<00:02:16.480> might<00:02:16.720> be<00:02:16.990> saved<00:02:17.500> with

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 
you corner drop you might be saved with

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.410 
you corner drop you might be saved with
this<00:02:17.890> but<00:02:18.370> you<00:02:18.460> can<00:02:18.610> see<00:02:18.730> that's<00:02:18.940> definitely<00:02:19.300> a

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
this but you can see that's definitely a

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.810 
this but you can see that's definitely a
pretty<00:02:19.660> thick<00:02:20.050> case<00:02:20.380> this<00:02:20.620> is<00:02:20.740> not<00:02:20.890> it's<00:02:21.700> not

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
pretty thick case this is not it's not

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:23.610 
pretty thick case this is not it's not
one<00:02:21.970> of<00:02:22.030> those<00:02:22.150> ultra<00:02:22.420> minimal<00:02:22.960> cases<00:02:23.350> that<00:02:23.530> we

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
one of those ultra minimal cases that we

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.800 
one of those ultra minimal cases that we
tend<00:02:23.860> to<00:02:23.950> feature<00:02:24.250> this<00:02:24.670> is<00:02:24.880> definitely<00:02:25.390> there

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
tend to feature this is definitely there

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.520 
tend to feature this is definitely there
to<00:02:26.110> protect<00:02:26.320> you<00:02:27.300> but<00:02:28.300> otherwise<00:02:28.530> everything

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
to protect you but otherwise everything

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.110 
to protect you but otherwise everything
is<00:02:29.560> still<00:02:29.740> going<00:02:29.920> to<00:02:29.980> work<00:02:30.190> the<00:02:30.670> game<00:02:30.820> your

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
is still going to work the game your

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.510 
is still going to work the game your
power<00:02:31.330> locks<00:02:31.690> which<00:02:31.960> is<00:02:32.170> there<00:02:32.560> your<00:02:33.100> volume

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.520 
power locks which is there your volume

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.380 
power locks which is there your volume
rocker<00:02:33.790> is<00:02:34.510> there<00:02:35.430> and<00:02:36.430> you<00:02:36.460> can<00:02:36.820> access<00:02:37.000> that

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
rocker is there and you can access that

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.240 
rocker is there and you can access that
pretty<00:02:37.720> easily<00:02:37.840> although<00:02:38.830> it<00:02:38.920> does<00:02:39.040> take<00:02:39.220> a

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
pretty easily although it does take a

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:40.350 
pretty easily although it does take a
little<00:02:39.400> bit<00:02:39.550> of<00:02:39.610> getting<00:02:39.730> used<00:02:39.850> to<00:02:40.060> in<00:02:40.180> any

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
little bit of getting used to in any

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.970 
little bit of getting used to in any
case<00:02:40.660> let's<00:02:41.230> see<00:02:41.320> we<00:02:41.440> can<00:02:41.560> still<00:02:41.740> do<00:02:41.860> the

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
case let's see we can still do the

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.180 
case let's see we can still do the
camera<00:02:42.430> thing<00:02:43.410> obviously<00:02:44.410> that's<00:02:44.920> still

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
camera thing obviously that's still

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:46.650 
camera thing obviously that's still
going<00:02:45.310> to<00:02:45.490> work<00:02:45.670> since<00:02:45.910> that<00:02:46.060> has<00:02:46.180> nothing<00:02:46.360> to

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
going to work since that has nothing to

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.750 
going to work since that has nothing to
do<00:02:46.780> with<00:02:46.900> the<00:02:46.990> case<00:02:47.200> but<00:02:48.130> you'll<00:02:48.220> see<00:02:48.400> this<00:02:48.580> is

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
do with the case but you'll see this is

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.140 
do with the case but you'll see this is
again<00:02:49.030> the<00:02:49.590> incase<00:02:50.590> snap<00:02:51.190> case<00:02:51.610> for<00:02:51.910> the<00:02:51.970> Moto

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
again the incase snap case for the Moto

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:53.610 
again the incase snap case for the Moto
X<00:02:52.390> can<00:02:52.930> I<00:02:52.960> believe<00:02:53.200> there's<00:02:53.350> going<00:02:53.470> to<00:02:53.530> be<00:02:53.560> a

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
X can I believe there's going to be a

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:54.930 
X can I believe there's going to be a
couple<00:02:53.860> different<00:02:54.100> colors<00:02:54.340> but<00:02:54.460> they've

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
couple different colors but they've

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.640 
couple different colors but they've
really<00:02:55.180> formed<00:02:55.540> this<00:02:55.660> thing<00:02:55.960> to<00:02:56.170> fit<00:02:56.470> the

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
really formed this thing to fit the

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.310 
really formed this thing to fit the
device<00:02:56.980> really<00:02:57.490> well<00:02:57.750> and<00:02:58.750> again<00:02:58.870> yeah<00:02:59.140> it's

00:02:59.310 --> 00:02:59.320 
device really well and again yeah it's

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.050 
device really well and again yeah it's
kind<00:02:59.620> of<00:02:59.680> a<00:02:59.800> thicker<00:03:00.040> case<00:03:00.370> so<00:03:00.730> you're<00:03:00.970> gonna

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
kind of a thicker case so you're gonna

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:02.160 
kind of a thicker case so you're gonna
have<00:03:01.180> to<00:03:01.240> get<00:03:01.300> used<00:03:01.480> to<00:03:01.570> it<00:03:01.630> I<00:03:01.720> wouldn't<00:03:01.960> say<00:03:02.050> it

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
have to get used to it I wouldn't say it

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:03.570 
have to get used to it I wouldn't say it
adds<00:03:02.320> a<00:03:02.500> ton<00:03:02.680> of<00:03:02.710> bulk<00:03:03.040> that<00:03:03.250> makes<00:03:03.460> it

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580
