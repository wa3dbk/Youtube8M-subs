and<00:01:03.420> went<00:01:03.989> to<00:01:04.110> increase<00:01:04.439> duration<00:01:05.070> because

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
and went to increase duration because

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.200 
and went to increase duration because
they'll<00:01:05.729> also<00:01:06.119> leaves<00:01:06.450> a<00:01:06.630> lot<00:01:06.780> more<00:01:06.930> time<00:01:07.170> for

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
they'll also leaves a lot more time for

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.490 
they'll also leaves a lot more time for
their<00:01:09.210> armor<00:01:09.420> to<00:01:09.540> be<00:01:09.659> weakened<00:01:10.020> to<00:01:10.140> take<00:01:10.320> more

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
their armor to be weakened to take more

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.179 
their armor to be weakened to take more
damage<00:01:10.650> and<00:01:10.950> to<00:01:11.549> combo<00:01:12.540> off<00:01:12.689> more<00:01:13.500> attacks

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
damage and to combo off more attacks

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.600 
damage and to combo off more attacks
together<00:01:14.640> like<00:01:15.119> with<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.560> poll<00:01:16.799> ability<00:01:17.250> warp

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
together like with the poll ability warp

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.840 
together like with the poll ability warp
and<00:01:17.790> pull<00:01:17.970> great<00:01:19.189> recombination<00:01:20.189> to<00:01:20.610> take

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
and pull great recombination to take

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.120 
and pull great recombination to take
down<00:01:21.000> armored<00:01:21.450> units<00:01:21.810> especially<00:01:22.590> like<00:01:23.009> the

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
down armored units especially like the

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.630 
down armored units especially like the

goth in the Atlas and the brute and a
benji<00:01:27.000> and<00:01:27.380> the<00:01:28.380> Ravagers<00:01:29.130> that's<00:01:30.060> so<00:01:30.299> plenty

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
benji and the Ravagers that's so plenty

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.730 
benji and the Ravagers that's so plenty
of<00:01:31.350> reasons<00:01:31.920> to<00:01:31.979> get<00:01:32.220> that<00:01:32.400> ability<00:01:32.820> and

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
of reasons to get that ability and

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.039 
of reasons to get that ability and
detonate<00:01:34.740> that<00:01:35.070> will<00:01:35.790> do<00:01:35.909> more<00:01:36.210> damage<00:01:36.390> in

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
detonate that will do more damage in

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.719 
detonate that will do more damage in
general<00:01:37.470> and<00:01:38.540> hurt<00:01:39.540> any<00:01:39.869> enemies<00:01:40.320> that<00:01:40.729> that

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
general and hurt any enemies that that

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.380 
general and hurt any enemies that that
the<00:01:42.600> that<00:01:42.950> d<00:01:43.950> combination<00:01:44.670> gets<00:01:44.820> that<00:01:45.030> nated

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
the that d combination gets that nated

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.240 
the that d combination gets that nated
on<00:01:47.210> throw<00:01:48.210> I<00:01:48.240> didn't<00:01:48.509> really<00:01:48.630> put<00:01:48.899> any<00:01:49.250> points

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
on throw I didn't really put any points

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.370 
on throw I didn't really put any points
as<00:01:50.369> much<00:01:50.520> into<00:01:50.790> that<00:01:50.909> mainly<00:01:51.750> just<00:01:51.930> got<00:01:52.200> this

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
as much into that mainly just got this

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.319 
as much into that mainly just got this
one<00:01:52.649> for<00:01:52.860> crowd<00:01:53.159> control<00:01:53.189> both<00:01:53.820> hit<00:01:54.000> multiple

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
one for crowd control both hit multiple

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:59.120 
one for crowd control both hit multiple
targets<00:01:54.479> with<00:01:54.840> it<00:01:57.320> so<00:01:58.320> with<00:01:58.560> this<00:01:58.680> one<00:01:58.860> I<00:01:58.890> went

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
targets with it so with this one I went

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.310 
targets with it so with this one I went
for<00:01:59.430> more<00:02:00.060> power<00:02:00.270> and<00:02:00.570> force<00:02:00.840> damage<00:02:01.170> because

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
for more power and force damage because

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.639 
for more power and force damage because
use<00:02:01.469> my<00:02:01.649> abilities<00:02:02.009> more<00:02:02.189> and<00:02:03.290> went<00:02:04.290> for<00:02:04.500> more

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
use my abilities more and went for more

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.160 
use my abilities more and went for more
weight<00:02:04.890> because<00:02:05.640> more<00:02:06.210> better<00:02:06.570> weapons<00:02:06.960> and

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
weight because more better weapons and

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.320 
weight because more better weapons and
higher<00:02:07.409> recharge<00:02:07.890> rate

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
higher recharge rate

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.410 
higher recharge rate
so<00:02:08.420> I<00:02:08.450> can<00:02:08.600> use<00:02:08.690> my<00:02:08.720> abilities<00:02:09.200> more<00:02:10.420> fitness

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
so I can use my abilities more fitness

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:12.760 
so I can use my abilities more fitness
