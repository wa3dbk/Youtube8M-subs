this house till you know it doesn't my

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:26.440 
this house till you know it doesn't my
truth<00:05:23.270> of<00:05:23.390> what<00:05:23.510> he's<00:05:23.630> saying<00:05:23.840> so<00:05:25.270> but<00:05:26.270> I'm

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:26.450 
truth of what he's saying so but I'm

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:28.450 
truth of what he's saying so but I'm
kind<00:05:26.630> of<00:05:26.690> torn<00:05:26.930> and<00:05:27.590> I'm<00:05:27.710> kind<00:05:27.950> of<00:05:27.980> not<00:05:28.130> so<00:05:28.430> I

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:28.460 
kind of torn and I'm kind of not so I

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:31.780 
kind of torn and I'm kind of not so I
think<00:05:28.730> it's<00:05:28.850> truth<00:05:30.130> because<00:05:31.130> people<00:05:31.400> respect

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:31.790 
think it's truth because people respect

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:35.230 
think it's truth because people respect
degrees<00:05:32.240> right<00:05:32.990> you<00:05:33.860> know<00:05:33.950> once<00:05:34.160> you<00:05:34.400> have<00:05:35.210> a

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:35.240 
degrees right you know once you have a

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.210 
degrees right you know once you have a
degree<00:05:35.450> you're<00:05:35.990> respected<00:05:36.560> they'll<00:05:36.710> take<00:05:37.010> you

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:37.220 
degree you're respected they'll take you

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:39.070 
degree you're respected they'll take you
and<00:05:37.640> they'll<00:05:38.060> take<00:05:38.330> you<00:05:38.720> into<00:05:38.870> consideration

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:39.080 
and they'll take you into consideration

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:41.080 
and they'll take you into consideration
more<00:05:39.950> they'll<00:05:40.160> take<00:05:40.400> someone<00:05:40.669> who<00:05:40.820> doesn't

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:41.090 
more they'll take someone who doesn't

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:43.659 
more they'll take someone who doesn't
have<00:05:41.180> a<00:05:41.240> degree<00:05:41.890> so<00:05:42.890> I<00:05:42.919> think<00:05:43.280> the<00:05:43.370> reasons<00:05:43.640> are

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:43.669 
have a degree so I think the reasons are

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:45.490 
have a degree so I think the reasons are
important<00:05:44.060> I<00:05:44.150> think<00:05:44.210> people<00:05:44.840> should<00:05:44.990> work<00:05:45.230> for

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:45.500 
important I think people should work for
