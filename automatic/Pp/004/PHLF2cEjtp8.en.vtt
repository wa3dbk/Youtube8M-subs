00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:05.250
 in the middle of the body is in progress 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.740
 that's why it's not strange that in the middle of this paradise called colombia with this 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:10.539
 summer 

00:00:10.539 --> 00:00:15.119
 that in the middle of a country quintero was blessed if you find a triangle 

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:15.859
 perfect 

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:18.859
 made up of earth even more critical 

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:21.480
 caldas quindÃ­o and risaralda 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.750
 three departments the gypsies looked at with eyes of love 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:29.159
 a place where the earth is dressed in all colors 

00:00:29.159 --> 00:00:31.599
 and adorned himself of all times 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:33.570
 three departments that unintentionally 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.480
 they look like a geography class 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.500
 the range 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:44.570
 the valley the mountains the mountain the snowed the rivers join in 13 thousand 873 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.290
 square kilometers 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:48.150
 as if it were his 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:49.730
 as if it were easy 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.730
 as if they did not know that it is a 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.179
 maybe that's why in that place 

00:00:56.179 --> 00:00:57.940
 people do not speak 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:59.300
 listen to what he says 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:00.590
 noli city 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:02.360
 without the terroir 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.420
 maybe that's why the family here 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:05.760
 remains 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.760
 and the houses retain the endearing the winners 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.390
 Maybe that's why Colombian coffee decided a while ago that it was going to 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.760
 be great on this earth 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:21.290
 still that we are a balcony and then I understand why it was what the 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:22.960
 he chose her 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.320
 today the same men dressed in dark still walk around 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.860
 today they still shake your hand 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.899
 and they look at you frankly, those who made the lands prosperous, nobody wants 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:35.790
 today and that's how heaven is 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.690
 you can still live life and customs 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:40.430
 of a land 15% 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.530
 world knew the true taste of a whole country 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:45.720
 in that place 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.720
 they're here 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.430
 that place 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:54.370
 it covers us
