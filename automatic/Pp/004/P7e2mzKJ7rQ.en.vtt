00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.510
 tutorial that I find great for 

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:36.930
 all those that you like to destroy 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:39.720
 things you will love is a cannon a 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.070
 dynamite-firing cannon is a 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:44.879
 authentic barbarity look for that 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:47.190
 we need obsidian reddish stone 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:51.269
 we need stone slabs a lever 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:54.000
 we need what is water repeaters and 

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:57.089
 dynamite more let's be able to look three 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.610
 obsidian stones and as you see and 

00:00:57.089 --> 00:01:06.260
 in the form of a 6 more over here 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:08.300
 and six more 1 2 3 4 5 6 alright let's 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.580
 put another one right in the beginning 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:13.160
 separated very well there is 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.630
 and let's put the lever on this 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:18.020
 it's going to be the one that's going to make it work 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:20.360
 the cannon well now the next thing that 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.620
 let's put it going to be the slabs of 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.180
 good stone I put them in stone but 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:26.390
 they can be from another thing the law of stone 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:29.180
 I put one and two on the right side and 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:32.630
 four on the left side and then two 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:34.550
 more perfect there are separated one vais to 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.619
 give an account of why you have to 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:39.170
 put and all those slabs worth stone 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:41.360
 reddish that attach the lever with the 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.610
 obsidian and on the left side what 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.280
 led to the end without touching the stone 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:49.970
 ok and there I put it on the stone above 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.990
 down one plus another plus there and there starts 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:54.570
 to put repeaters 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:56.760
 there are six repeaters that I have to put 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.010
 the repeaters is so that always for 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.659
 that the action of 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:02.520
 throw the dynamite you will not see now there's 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:07.170
 six repeaters and I have to put him 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:10.569
 I will have three clicks three clicks 3 3 and 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:14.819
 these last two two only worth 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:17.739
 and reddish foot joining it with the lever 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:19.389
 let's do a little review of the 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:22.420
 what you see there is bet the 

00:02:19.389 --> 00:02:24.909
 repeaters reddish feet that joins with the 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.439
 lever that what you do go see there 

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:27.790
 you see the repeaters that have a 

00:02:26.439 --> 00:02:30.519
 little bit more than the signal at the end 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:33.519
 on the right side well there we place 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:35.230
 the water right at the start that's going to go 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:38.650
 until the end and it will be on the verge of 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:40.989
 the stone slab and you're ready to 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:43.180
 to do again is to place the dynamite on 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:44.620
 fundamental order first dynamite that 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.500
 it is put in which is going to launch that is 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:51.909
 that one there and in the water we put the rest 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:53.799
 until leaving one of water well now 

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:56.349
 it's ready we just stand 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:03:00.159
 a high zone to see how it is launched 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:03:03.879
 we activate the lever and the dynamite goes to 

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:05.829
 go out and you'll see by a 

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:07.150

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.989
 try another one is worth it for you to see 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.190
 we remember we put the dynamite in the 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:18.070
 high part and then 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:21.720
 in the water until there is only one 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:25.080
 of water we activate the lever 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:27.810
