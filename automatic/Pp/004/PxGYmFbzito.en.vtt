00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:52.969 

bringing<00:04:50.969> these<00:04:51.089> sections<00:04:51.599> in<00:04:51.869> so<00:04:52.679> I'm<00:04:52.769> just

00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:52.979 
bringing these sections in so I'm just

00:04:52.979 --> 00:05:03.439 
bringing these sections in so I'm just
going<00:04:53.219> to<00:04:53.339> take<00:04:53.869> inch

00:05:03.439 --> 00:05:03.449

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:07.460 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:11.150 

and<00:05:08.480> you<00:05:09.480> really<00:05:09.690> already<00:05:10.440> cut<00:05:10.710> these<00:05:10.890> layers

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:11.160 
and you really already cut these layers

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.920 
and you really already cut these layers
through<00:05:11.520> here<00:05:11.880> so<00:05:12.210> you<00:05:12.270> shouldn't<00:05:12.750> really

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:12.930 
through here so you shouldn't really

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:16.820 
through here so you shouldn't really
have<00:05:13.760> much<00:05:14.760> more<00:05:15.030> to<00:05:15.150> cut<00:05:15.420> up<00:05:16.110> here<00:05:16.620> you<00:05:16.770> just

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:16.830 
have much more to cut up here you just

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:21.500 
have much more to cut up here you just
want<00:05:17.160> to<00:05:17.220> make<00:05:17.370> sure<00:05:17.430> that<00:05:17.610> it's<00:05:17.970> even<00:05:20.360> so<00:05:21.360> I'm

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:21.510 
want to make sure that it's even so I'm

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:26.420 
want to make sure that it's even so I'm
bringing<00:05:21.900> it<00:05:22.020> forward<00:05:24.080> and<00:05:25.080> I'm<00:05:25.920> going<00:05:26.250> to

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:26.430 
bringing it forward and I'm going to

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:29.810 
bringing it forward and I'm going to
trim<00:05:26.820> it

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:29.820 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:37.350 

it<00:05:31.070> then<00:05:32.070> you<00:05:32.940> want<00:05:33.210> to<00:05:33.270> just<00:05:33.600> keep

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:37.360 

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:42.330 

bringing<00:05:38.169> it<00:05:38.319> forward<00:05:40.319> so<00:05:41.319> basically<00:05:42.009> what's

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:42.340 
bringing it forward so basically what's

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:47.010 
bringing it forward so basically what's
going<00:05:42.610> to<00:05:42.759> happen<00:05:43.270> is<00:05:45.629> I'm<00:05:46.629> going<00:05:46.810> to<00:05:46.870> have

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:47.020 
going to happen is I'm going to have

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:50.070 
going to happen is I'm going to have
some<00:05:47.229> face-framing<00:05:48.099> layers<00:05:48.659> I'm<00:05:49.659> not<00:05:49.870> going

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:50.080 
some face-framing layers I'm not going

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:52.080 
some face-framing layers I'm not going
to<00:05:50.139> have<00:05:50.319> many<00:05:50.830> layers<00:05:51.189> through<00:05:51.669> the<00:05:51.849> back

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:52.090 
to have many layers through the back

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:57.390 
to have many layers through the back
right<00:05:52.629> now<00:05:52.770> although<00:05:53.770> I<00:05:53.800> already<00:05:54.099> do<00:05:55.530> but<00:05:56.530> this

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:57.400 
right now although I already do but this

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:00.300 
right now although I already do but this

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:00.310 
is going to give you long face-framing

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:07.159 
is going to give you long face-framing
layers<00:06:04.560> just<00:06:05.560> making<00:06:06.159> sure<00:06:06.189> everything's

00:06:07.159 --> 00:06:07.169 
layers just making sure everything's
