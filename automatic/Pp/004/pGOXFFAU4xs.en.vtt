00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:08.840
 car racing and start a little time after the birth of the 

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:10.159
 car 

00:00:10.159 --> 00:00:11.999
 at the beginning of the 20th century 

00:00:11.999 --> 00:00:15.329
 his glamor attracted the attention of the boldest, reckless drivers 

00:00:15.329 --> 00:00:17.089
 designers 

00:00:17.089 --> 00:00:18.900
 in 1910 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.189
 augusto david millar had the best of those two worlds 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:25.699
 by hiring a brilliant young man who was the same time supply broker 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:26.859
 and designed 

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:29.019
 ferdinand porsche 

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:33.140
 porsche built his first car in 1900 had two electric motors 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.140
 placed on the axes of each front wheel 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.430
 although it was not a racing car 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.550
 Well, it earned him a great reputation as a brilliant and original designer 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.329
 the fascination of porsche for electricity 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.710
 did not have much influence on the evolution of the motor car 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:52.879
 but his ideas 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:56.610
 including that of the electric motors installed on the front axles 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.289
 had great impact on mass transportation 

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:02.289
 from trams to machines 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:07.470
 Jorge was a workaholic 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.880
 his genius for engineering combined with a great creative mind 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:11.940
 independence 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:15.630
 almost derailed his promising career in the German car industry 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.840
 qureshi had strong disputes with daimler 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.430
 and denounced in 1923 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.410
 he left austria to join the company tangled to study germany 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.530
 design ideas per se did not differ too much from those in 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:39.450
 The time 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.620
 but still 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:44.510
 managed to make a few enemies in the conservative auto industry 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:47.150
 german 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:49.970
 in 1928 due to a disagreement 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:51.480
 porsche will leave daimler 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:55.090
 and when a new company of yours went bankrupt in austria after a black Monday of 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:56.110
 monster 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.370
 porsche decided that his best option would be to establish a design team 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:02.570
 independent in germany 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.659
 the way that would become the post pay beetle made its 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.080
 first appearances in a series of porsche designs from the beginning of the 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.379
 decade of the 30 

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:14.869
 on positive 12 in the year 1932 

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:19.109
 another element that would come to be part of the well design pay 

00:02:19.109 --> 00:02:19.929
 beetle 

00:02:19.929 --> 00:02:21.939
 the suspension torsion bar 

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:24.939
 It was also the product of the first years of the 1930s 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:30.979
 in 1933 

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:35.289
 pons this car was designed type 12 for the motorcycle manufacturer 

00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:38.289
 German I started a 

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:42.560
 only three of these cars were built before being abandoned on 

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:43.469
 draft 

00:02:43.469 --> 00:02:44.939
 but type 32 

00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:49.090
 with its rear engine with air cooling and its original body shape 

00:02:49.089 --> 00:02:52.309
 I know that the elche pay the town car to Lima 

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:59.619
 shot to death Fritzler took office in 1933 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:03.869
 because in the construction of a new highway system known as the 

00:03:03.869 --> 00:03:05.239
 control 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:08.029
 I also wanted a car that could be produced in large 

00:03:08.029 --> 00:03:08.870
 amounts 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.650
 and sold at a very low price for members of the German working class 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:22.320
 Hitler summoned porsche to a meeting in 1933 

00:03:22.999 --> 00:03:26.209
 there he established his parameters for the construction of a car 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:26.990
 family 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:31.130
 of air cooling that could be produced for less than a thousand marks ana 

00:03:36.639 --> 00:03:39.119
 Hitler knew exactly what he wanted 

00:03:39.119 --> 00:03:42.819
 In subsequent meetings he presented his own schemes for modifying the 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:45.559
 plans of the porsche type 32 

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:46.849
 used to say 

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:48.769
 It must look like a beetle 

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:52.019
 you just need to take a look at nature to realize what 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:55.139
 it really means aerodynamics 

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:56.419
 jc cahe 

00:03:56.419 --> 00:04:00.039
 but the construction project jb the electoral turn to see 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:02.149
 the torcal lopez 

00:04:02.149 --> 00:04:07.049
 but the card in case the crowd types their interests and signed a contract 

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:09.829
 for its development in 1934 

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:14.879
 for February of 1935 cycle it resigned with optimism that the phase of test would be 

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:20.189
 completed by mid-year the sword or not 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:27.729
 two prototypes were built in the garage of the house of the punch 

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:31.510
 one of them was a two-door convertible model 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:32.199
 the other 

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:35.199
 a closed model with four doors 

00:04:37.499 --> 00:04:40.849
 Porsche's main problem was to design a cooling engine for 

00:04:40.849 --> 00:04:42.939
 simple air and low cost 

00:04:42.939 --> 00:04:47.309
 testing different formats including a two-cylinder version before 

00:04:47.309 --> 00:04:50.389
 get to the four-cylinder model that would move more than 20 million 

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:55.429
 death beetle this was called the m engine with a capacity of a little 

00:04:55.429 --> 00:04:58.429
 less than a liter 

00:05:05.689 --> 00:05:08.610
 gitler's specifications were strict 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:11.789
 the car had to have great fuel efficiency 

00:05:11.789 --> 00:05:15.839
 should be able to travel 100 kilometers with only 7 liters of fuel 

00:05:15.839 --> 00:05:18.839
 of the tank installed in the front 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:29.960
 in 1936 three other experimental prototypes were built 

00:05:31.069 --> 00:05:34.919
 were prepared by porsche to withstand severe testing programs 

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:38.459
 It dropped to 2 out at the German carmakers association 

00:05:42.349 --> 00:05:46.029
 cars should cover thousands of kilometers from the black forest 

00:05:46.029 --> 00:05:49.029
 up to the Alps and through the new autobahn 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:57.180
 the tests on the models revealed certain weaknesses 

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:00.439
 but the reports were generally favorable 

00:06:00.439 --> 00:06:03.569
 manufacturers doubted that the car could be produced on 

00:06:03.569 --> 00:06:05.479
 price planned by gitler 

00:06:05.479 --> 00:06:08.789
 chicha took the project and took it to the German labor front 

00:06:08.789 --> 00:06:12.190
 the front commissioned the tanner mendes company to produce 30 

00:06:12.189 --> 00:06:15.189
 Cars for the Nazi SS 

00:06:23.529 --> 00:06:27.020
 Hitler had received a great influence of g 

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:30.800
 I knew that Ford had built factories near rivers, canals and 

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:31.550
 ports 

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:34.479
 and decided to install a factory north of germany 

00:06:34.479 --> 00:06:37.479
 close rim of the great canals 

00:06:39.039 --> 00:06:41.289
 in May 1938 

00:06:41.289 --> 00:06:45.229
 a majestic celebration took place in the vicinity of Spain is slight 

00:06:45.229 --> 00:06:48.319
 at the ceremony of placing the first stone of a factory with the 

00:06:48.319 --> 00:06:51.580
 that gitler pretended to rival the drug giant 

00:06:54.279 --> 00:06:58.449
 in the same celebration announcement for surprise of ferdinand porsche that the 

00:06:58.449 --> 00:07:01.800
 automobiles would be called Cadiz and Pakistan 

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:04.699
 sibila scabin Meaning in German 

00:07:04.699 --> 00:07:06.860
 force through pleasure 

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:10.919
 and even worse the town where the factory would be established would be called 

00:07:10.919 --> 00:07:12.529
 cadiz state 

00:07:12.529 --> 00:07:15.529
 the city of cars of force through pleasure 

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:25.610
 the task of taking gitler by car when leaving the factory was entrusted to 

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:28.719
 make 3% son of ferdinand 

00:07:28.719 --> 00:07:30.500
 a similar convertible car 

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:34.270
 this car was offered for his 50th birthday 

00:07:34.270 --> 00:07:35.960
 Hitler never learned to drive
