00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
and this video is about close calls and

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.730 
and this video is about close calls and
i<00:01:26.159> suppose<00:01:26.460> that<00:01:26.490> everybody<00:01:27.119> knows<00:01:27.500> the<00:01:28.500> the

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
i suppose that everybody knows the the

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.679 
i suppose that everybody knows the the
main<00:01:29.009> thing<00:01:29.280> about<00:01:29.460> close<00:01:29.880> calls<00:01:30.299> is<00:01:30.540> that

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
main thing about close calls is that

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.450 
main thing about close calls is that
they<00:01:30.810> are<00:01:30.840> well<00:01:31.259> first<00:01:31.500> of<00:01:31.619> all<00:01:31.680> very<00:01:31.740> close<00:01:32.220> of

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
they are well first of all very close of

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.600 
they are well first of all very close of
course<00:01:32.700> but<00:01:33.270> so<00:01:33.600> bloody<00:01:34.350> frustrating<00:01:34.890> and<00:01:35.460> i

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
course but so bloody frustrating and i

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.910 
course but so bloody frustrating and i
think<00:01:35.820> i<00:01:36.000> think<00:01:36.780> in<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.470> whole<00:01:37.770> of<00:01:38.070> tf2<00:01:38.549> as<00:01:39.920> the

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
think i think in the whole of tf2 as the

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.770 
think i think in the whole of tf2 as the
whole<00:01:41.100> game<00:01:41.400> like<00:01:41.640> since<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.299> moment<00:01:42.540> it

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
whole game like since the moment it

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.160 
whole game like since the moment it
started<00:01:43.110> to<00:01:43.229> exist<00:01:43.740> as<00:01:44.009> well<00:01:44.820> as<00:01:45.000> right<00:01:45.540> now<00:01:45.840> or

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170

calls anybody can have in tf2 I think if

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.390 
calls anybody can have in tf2 I think if
you<00:02:31.390> are<00:02:31.420> having<00:02:31.780> a<00:02:31.930> close<00:02:32.230> call<00:02:32.590> because<00:02:33.040> you

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
you are having a close call because you

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.400 
you are having a close call because you
should<00:02:33.580> have<00:02:33.670> rock<00:02:33.910> it<00:02:34.060> too<00:02:34.240> late<00:02:34.450> and<00:02:34.720> you<00:02:35.170> die

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
should have rock it too late and you die

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.500 
should have rock it too late and you die
because<00:02:35.770> of<00:02:35.800> a<00:02:35.980> new<00:02:36.280> shell<00:02:36.580> for<00:02:36.760> example<00:02:37.209> and

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
because of a new shell for example and

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.360 
because of a new shell for example and
your<00:02:38.260> rocket<00:02:38.590> doesn't<00:02:38.680> go<00:02:38.920> further<00:02:39.190> because

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
your rocket doesn't go further because

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.220 
your rocket doesn't go further because
the<00:02:39.640> moment<00:02:39.820> you<00:02:40.000> die<00:02:40.270> your<00:02:40.510> rocket<00:02:40.840> disappear

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
the moment you die your rocket disappear

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.350 
the moment you die your rocket disappear
so<00:02:41.350> you<00:02:41.440> don't<00:02:41.590> get<00:02:41.650> a<00:02:41.709> kill<00:02:42.040> as<00:02:42.250> a<00:02:42.280> revenge<00:02:42.670> and

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
so you don't get a kill as a revenge and

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.000 
so you don't get a kill as a revenge and
I<00:02:43.840> didn't<00:02:44.110> see<00:02:44.170> the<00:02:44.290> de<00:02:44.380> century<00:02:44.620> by<00:02:44.770> the<00:02:44.800> way

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:37.330 
health and managed to shoot me first

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.240 
health and managed to shoot me first
before<00:03:37.660> my<00:03:37.900> rocket<00:03:38.320> actually<00:03:38.440> explosion<00:03:39.160> the

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
before my rocket actually explosion the

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.900 
before my rocket actually explosion the
floor<00:03:39.519> it<00:03:40.480> just<00:03:41.290> so<00:03:41.560> very<00:03:41.830> frustrated<00:03:42.550> I<00:03:42.610> don't

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
floor it just so very frustrated I don't

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.810 
floor it just so very frustrated I don't
actually<00:03:43.230> get<00:03:44.230> the<00:03:44.440> kill<00:03:44.800> then<00:03:45.130> because<00:03:45.700> my
