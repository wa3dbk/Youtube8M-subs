00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:40.830 
choices as as the loop cut does so i'll
decide<00:02:38.379> it<00:02:38.560> on<00:02:38.620> this<00:02:38.890> here<00:02:39.250> and<00:02:39.400> the<00:02:40.030> i<00:02:40.269> only

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
decide it on this here and the i only

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.809 
decide it on this here and the i only
want<00:02:41.019> to<00:02:41.640> subdivide<00:02:42.640> the<00:02:43.650> across<00:02:44.650> edges<00:02:45.130> i'll

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:45.819 
want to subdivide the across edges i'll

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:48.509 
want to subdivide the across edges i'll
have<00:02:46.239> to<00:02:46.269> go<00:02:46.540> in<00:02:46.660> to<00:02:46.690> edge<00:02:46.989> mode<00:02:47.290> and<00:02:47.650> press<00:02:48.130> alt

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:48.519 
have to go in to edge mode and press alt

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:52.130

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
the edges to go around the loop and

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.440 
the edges to go around the loop and
because<00:02:56.890> there<00:02:57.099> are<00:02:57.160> other<00:02:57.310> complications<00:02:58.299> to

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
because there are other complications to

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.130 
because there are other complications to
the<00:02:58.569> mesh<00:02:58.810> in<00:02:59.530> the<00:03:00.250> this<00:03:00.910> inner<00:03:01.180> part<00:03:01.690> i'll

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
the mesh in the this inner part i'll

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.690 
the mesh in the this inner part i'll
have<00:03:02.530> to<00:03:02.739> manually<00:03:03.129> go<00:03:03.250> around<00:03:03.730> and<00:03:05.340> d<00:03:06.340> select

have to manually go around and d select

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.059 
have to manually go around and d select
sections<00:03:07.000> of<00:03:07.420> it<00:03:07.540> and<00:03:08.170> i<00:03:08.560> want<00:03:08.769> to<00:03:08.829> make<00:03:08.950> sure

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:09.069 
sections of it and i want to make sure

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:13.309 
sections of it and i want to make sure
they<00:03:09.459> don't<00:03:09.489> get<00:03:09.849> any<00:03:10.410> unintentional

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:13.319 
they don't get any unintentional

they don't get any unintentional
selected<00:03:14.549> excuse<00:03:15.549> me<00:03:15.760> selected<00:03:16.510> edges<00:03:17.609> left

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:18.609 
selected excuse me selected edges left

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:22.259 
selected excuse me selected edges left
because<00:03:19.299> then<00:03:19.450> i'll<00:03:19.569> get<00:03:20.340> cuts<00:03:21.340> that<00:03:21.670> will

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:22.269 
because then i'll get cuts that will

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:32.660 
because then i'll get cuts that will
just<00:03:22.510> complicate<00:03:22.750> the<00:03:23.170> mesh

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:35.809 

also<00:03:33.480> just<00:03:33.959> before<00:03:34.319> we<00:03:34.440> continually<00:03:35.099> going<00:03:35.520> to

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:35.819 
also just before we continually going to

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:39.010 
also just before we continually going to

rotate around selection that helps

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.790 
rotate around selection that helps
somewhat<00:03:42.180> with<00:03:42.360> the<00:03:42.450> navigation<00:03:43.080> because

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:43.800 
somewhat with the navigation because

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.250 
somewhat with the navigation because
you'll<00:03:44.010> your<00:03:44.640> navigation<00:03:45.300> your<00:03:45.420> rotation<00:03:46.140> in

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
you'll your navigation your rotation in

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.229 
you'll your navigation your rotation in
3d<00:03:46.560> space<00:03:46.680> will<00:03:47.040> be<00:03:47.069> relative<00:03:47.670> to<00:03:47.700> what<00:03:48.090> you

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
3d space will be relative to what you

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:52.190 
3d space will be relative to what you
have<00:03:48.360> selected<00:03:49.250> so<00:03:50.510> here's<00:03:51.510> that<00:03:51.569> and<00:03:51.959> then

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
have selected so here's that and then

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:56.750 
have selected so here's that and then
i'll<00:03:52.350> do<00:03:52.770> w<00:03:54.020> subdivide<00:03:55.020> and<00:03:55.340> I<00:03:56.340> can<00:03:56.550> hear

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
i'll do w subdivide and I can hear

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.430 
i'll do w subdivide and I can hear
choose<00:03:57.030> the<00:03:57.209> number<00:03:57.330> of<00:03:57.510> cuts<00:03:57.720> either<00:03:58.170> by

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
choose the number of cuts either by

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.630 
choose the number of cuts either by
arrow<00:03:58.680> or<00:03:58.890> by<00:03:59.130> entry<00:03:59.989> so<00:04:00.989> I'll<00:04:01.170> do<00:04:01.410> three<00:04:02.370> cuts

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 
arrow or by entry so I'll do three cuts

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.690 
arrow or by entry so I'll do three cuts
is<00:04:02.849> good<00:04:03.060> and<00:04:03.269> now<00:04:04.140> to<00:04:04.830> accomplish<00:04:05.340> the<00:04:05.550> same

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
is good and now to accomplish the same

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.250 
is good and now to accomplish the same
the<00:04:06.090> good<00:04:06.269> thing<00:04:06.510> with<00:04:06.660> this<00:04:06.840> tool<00:04:07.050> is<00:04:07.170> that

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
the good thing with this tool is that

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:08.870 
the good thing with this tool is that
you<00:04:07.410> can<00:04:07.560> still<00:04:07.739> navigate<00:04:07.950> the<00:04:08.489> tool<00:04:08.700> is

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
you can still navigate the tool is

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.930 
you can still navigate the tool is
active<00:04:09.090> you<00:04:09.540> can<00:04:10.440> still<00:04:10.680> navigate<00:04:10.860> and<00:04:11.549> look

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
active you can still navigate and look

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.080 
active you can still navigate and look
at<00:04:12.120> what<00:04:12.239> you're<00:04:12.420> getting<00:04:13.370> so<00:04:14.370> that's<00:04:14.610> that's

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
at what you're getting so that's that's

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:23.450 
at what you're getting so that's that's
a<00:04:15.239> good<00:04:15.390> thing<00:04:15.630> and<00:04:20.690> you<00:04:21.690> can<00:04:21.870> also<00:04:22.019> do<00:04:22.860> what<00:04:23.430> I

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:23.460 
a good thing and you can also do what I

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.159 
a good thing and you can also do what I
did<00:04:23.669> with<00:04:23.970> it<00:04:24.000> all<00:04:24.210> tests<00:04:24.540> you<00:04:24.660> can<00:04:24.720> do<00:04:24.930> that<00:04:25.110> in

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:25.169 
did with it all tests you can do that in

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:29.450 
did with it all tests you can do that in
that<00:04:25.560> tools<00:04:26.010> I<00:04:26.220> can<00:04:26.250> add<00:04:26.580> one<00:04:27.260> to<00:04:28.260> get<00:04:28.440> a<00:04:28.620> more

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 
that tools I can add one to get a more

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:34.000 
that tools I can add one to get a more
arched<00:04:30.120> look<00:04:30.389> here<00:04:30.660> and<00:04:31.370> I<00:04:32.370> can<00:04:32.550> use<00:04:32.729> the

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.010 
arched look here and I can use the

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:36.800 
arched look here and I can use the
arrows<00:04:35.010> to<00:04:35.040> increase<00:04:35.729> or<00:04:35.910> decrease<00:04:36.000> only<00:04:36.690> up

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
arrows to increase or decrease only up

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:38.750 
arrows to increase or decrease only up
to<00:04:37.020> one<00:04:37.260> but<00:04:37.500> over<00:04:37.800> one<00:04:38.039> I<00:04:38.070> can<00:04:38.340> enter<00:04:38.640> in

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:38.760 
to one but over one I can enter in

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:44.120 
to one but over one I can enter in
numbers<00:04:39.090> i<00:04:39.300> do<00:04:39.360> too<00:04:42.020> and<00:04:43.020> I'm<00:04:43.710> good<00:04:43.919> with<00:04:44.070> that

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:44.130 
numbers i do too and I'm good with that

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:47.150 
numbers i do too and I'm good with that
so<00:04:44.550> I'll<00:04:44.669> just<00:04:44.729> press<00:04:45.180> a<00:04:45.530> then<00:04:46.530> the<00:04:46.680> tool<00:04:46.890> goes

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:47.160 
so I'll just press a then the tool goes

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:51.409 
so I'll just press a then the tool goes
away<00:04:49.160> so<00:04:50.160> these<00:04:50.310> are<00:04:50.490> two<00:04:50.520> different<00:04:50.729> ways<00:04:51.240> of

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:51.419 
away so these are two different ways of

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:52.760 
away so these are two different ways of
accomplishing<00:04:51.660> basically<00:04:52.440> the<00:04:52.530> same<00:04:52.710> thing

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:52.770 
accomplishing basically the same thing

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:56.870 
accomplishing basically the same thing
and<00:04:54.470> what<00:04:55.470> I<00:04:55.500> would<00:04:55.620> like<00:04:55.860> to<00:04:55.890> do<00:04:56.130> more<00:04:56.160> is<00:04:56.700> I

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880 
and what I would like to do more is I

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.540 
and what I would like to do more is I
would<00:04:57.060> like<00:04:57.210> to<00:04:57.360> give<00:04:57.919> Suzanne<00:04:58.919> since<00:04:59.400> this

00:04:59.540 --> 00:04:59.550 
would like to give Suzanne since this

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:02.690 
would like to give Suzanne since this
monkeys<00:05:00.030> called<00:05:00.300> Suzanne<00:05:00.780> also<00:05:01.200> a<00:05:01.550> haircut<00:05:02.550> or

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:02.700 
monkeys called Suzanne also a haircut or

cuts<00:05:15.600> here<00:05:15.930> i'll<00:05:16.770> just<00:05:17.010> show<00:05:17.640> this<00:05:17.880> i<00:05:18.289> get<00:05:19.289> all

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:19.470 
cuts here i'll just show this i get all

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:21.409 
cuts here i'll just show this i get all
these<00:05:19.620> extra<00:05:19.979> cuts<00:05:20.280> that<00:05:20.490> are<00:05:20.520> really<00:05:21.300> not

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:21.419 
these extra cuts that are really not

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:24.620 
these extra cuts that are really not
interested<00:05:21.810> in<00:05:22.760> so<00:05:23.760> how<00:05:23.910> can<00:05:24.210> i<00:05:24.270> accomplish

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:24.630 
interested in so how can i accomplish

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:27.770 
interested in so how can i accomplish
this<00:05:25.160> because<00:05:26.160> hold<00:05:26.820> ctrl<00:05:27.060> z<00:05:27.390> out<00:05:27.539> of<00:05:27.690> this

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:27.780 
this because hold ctrl z out of this

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:32.240 
this because hold ctrl z out of this
because<00:05:28.289> if<00:05:28.770> i<00:05:28.919> go<00:05:29.070> into<00:05:29.220> face<00:05:29.520> mode<00:05:31.010> like<00:05:32.010> this

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:32.250 
because if i go into face mode like this

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:35.300 
because if i go into face mode like this
then<00:05:32.729> i'll<00:05:33.060> get<00:05:33.300> the<00:05:33.389> same<00:05:33.570> scenario<00:05:34.110> well<00:05:35.070> of

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:35.310 
then i'll get the same scenario well of

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:37.250 
then i'll get the same scenario well of
course<00:05:35.340> the<00:05:35.700> cure<00:05:35.910> for<00:05:36.150> this<00:05:36.300> is<00:05:36.630> be<00:05:36.990> an<00:05:37.080> edge

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:37.260 
course the cure for this is be an edge

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:40.250 
course the cure for this is be an edge
mode<00:05:37.530> a<00:05:37.830> and<00:05:38.370> then<00:05:39.060> say<00:05:39.270> ok<00:05:39.600> well<00:05:39.840> here's<00:05:40.139> the

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:40.260 
mode a and then say ok well here's the

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.380 
mode a and then say ok well here's the
loop<00:05:40.560> this<00:05:41.010> is<00:05:41.130> where<00:05:41.280> it<00:05:41.370> went<00:05:41.490> and<00:05:41.789> I<00:05:42.210> feel

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:42.390 
loop this is where it went and I feel

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:44.029 
loop this is where it went and I feel
like<00:05:42.419> an<00:05:42.630> end<00:05:42.870> it<00:05:43.020> right<00:05:43.200> here<00:05:43.260> because<00:05:43.830> if<00:05:43.950> I

00:05:44.029 --> 00:05:44.039 
like an end it right here because if I

00:05:44.039 --> 00:05:46.100 
like an end it right here because if I
get<00:05:44.190> some<00:05:44.430> triangles<00:05:44.880> or<00:05:45.120> something

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:46.110 
get some triangles or something

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:47.930 
get some triangles or something
I<00:05:46.140> can<00:05:46.380> take<00:05:46.830> care<00:05:46.860> of<00:05:47.070> that<00:05:47.160> here<00:05:47.640> so<00:05:47.850> i'll

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:47.940 
I can take care of that here so i'll

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:51.380 
I can take care of that here so i'll
just<00:05:48.000> do<00:05:48.450> this<00:05:49.220> i'll<00:05:50.220> go<00:05:50.430> from<00:05:50.640> there<00:05:50.910> and<00:05:51.150> just

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:51.390 
just do this i'll go from there and just

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:55.990 
just do this i'll go from there and just
manually<00:05:51.780> select<00:05:52.320> these<00:05:52.500> rather<00:05:53.220> few<00:05:53.870> edges

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:56.000 
manually select these rather few edges

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.860 
manually select these rather few edges
won't<00:05:57.000> take<00:05:57.240> that<00:05:57.270> much<00:05:57.510> time<00:05:58.580> and<00:05:59.720> i<00:06:00.720> have

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:00.870 
won't take that much time and i have

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:02.570 
won't take that much time and i have
control<00:06:01.230> exactly<00:06:01.500> where<00:06:02.070> it's<00:06:02.220> going<00:06:02.340> to<00:06:02.430> be

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:02.580 
control exactly where it's going to be

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:05.450 
control exactly where it's going to be
and<00:06:02.820> then<00:06:03.210> I<00:06:03.240> can<00:06:03.480> use<00:06:03.630> the<00:06:03.810> W<00:06:04.170> tool<00:06:04.350> w<00:06:05.340> the

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:05.460 
and then I can use the W tool w the

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:08.540 
and then I can use the W tool w the
subdivide<00:06:05.940> tool<00:06:06.150> and<00:06:06.480> I'm<00:06:07.110> going<00:06:07.170> to<00:06:07.350> use<00:06:07.550> for

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:08.550 
subdivide tool and I'm going to use for

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:15.920 
subdivide tool and I'm going to use for
cuts<00:06:08.850> in<00:06:08.970> this<00:06:09.120> case<00:06:12.860> and<00:06:13.860> I<00:06:14.580> wanted<00:06:15.000> to<00:06:15.300> get

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:15.930 
cuts in this case and I wanted to get

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:19.760 
cuts in this case and I wanted to get
this<00:06:16.220> you<00:06:17.220> know<00:06:17.340> arch<00:06:17.610> thing<00:06:18.060> here<00:06:18.420> so<00:06:18.680> I<00:06:19.680> can

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:19.770 
this you know arch thing here so I can

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:22.160 
this you know arch thing here so I can
just<00:06:19.920> add<00:06:20.430> a<00:06:20.490> really<00:06:21.150> large<00:06:21.330> number<00:06:21.690> like<00:06:21.870> 10

00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:22.170 
just add a really large number like 10

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:33.250 
just add a really large number like 10
and<00:06:22.850> it<00:06:23.850> makes<00:06:24.060> this<00:06:24.270> this<00:06:25.170> arch<00:06:28.340> like<00:06:29.340> that<00:06:29.610> I

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:33.260 

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.020 

have<00:06:34.260> the<00:06:34.500> remaining<00:06:34.980> problem<00:06:35.400> is<00:06:35.580> that<00:06:35.850> i

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:36.030 
have the remaining problem is that i

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:37.970 
have the remaining problem is that i
have<00:06:36.270> triangles<00:06:36.660> here<00:06:37.020> and<00:06:37.230> they<00:06:37.590> may<00:06:37.740> or<00:06:37.890> may

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:37.980 
have triangles here and they may or may

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:39.890 
have triangles here and they may or may
not<00:06:38.010> cause<00:06:38.430> a<00:06:38.460> problem<00:06:38.790> in<00:06:39.060> rendering<00:06:39.630> but

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:39.900 
not cause a problem in rendering but

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:41.990 
not cause a problem in rendering but
just<00:06:40.200> to<00:06:40.290> make<00:06:40.440> sure<00:06:40.470> i'll<00:06:41.430> just<00:06:41.640> convert

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:42.000 
just to make sure i'll just convert

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.260 
just to make sure i'll just convert
these<00:06:42.210> to<00:06:42.510> alt<00:06:43.500> J<00:06:43.950> or<00:06:44.280> just<00:06:44.520> right<00:06:45.030> mouse<00:06:45.240> click

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:45.270 
these to alt J or just right mouse click

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:47.210 
these to alt J or just right mouse click
on<00:06:45.690> them<00:06:45.900> to<00:06:45.930> select<00:06:46.380> them<00:06:46.530> and<00:06:46.620> then<00:06:46.770> all<00:06:46.920> J<00:06:47.160> to

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:47.220 
on them to select them and then all J to

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:51.980 
on them to select them and then all J to
convert<00:06:48.180> into<00:06:48.480> quads<00:06:49.130> and<00:06:50.780> now<00:06:51.780> we're

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:51.990 
convert into quads and now we're

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:53.780 
convert into quads and now we're
rotating<00:06:52.200> around<00:06:52.650> that<00:06:53.040> point<00:06:53.250> because<00:06:53.430> it's

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:53.790 
rotating around that point because it's

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:55.700 
rotating around that point because it's
the<00:06:54.120> selection<00:06:54.600> which<00:06:54.810> is<00:06:54.960> fine<00:06:55.170> in<00:06:55.350> this<00:06:55.500> case

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:55.710 
the selection which is fine in this case

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:58.880 
the selection which is fine in this case
and<00:06:56.120> then<00:06:57.120> I'll<00:06:57.300> right<00:06:58.110> mouse<00:06:58.380> click<00:06:58.410> and

00:06:58.880 --> 00:06:58.890 
and then I'll right mouse click and

00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:06.620 
and then I'll right mouse click and
shift<00:06:59.280> right<00:06:59.580> mouse<00:06:59.850> click<00:06:59.880> and<00:07:00.650> alt<00:07:01.650> J<00:07:05.630> so

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:06.630 
shift right mouse click and alt J so

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:07.880 
shift right mouse click and alt J so
these<00:07:06.750> are<00:07:06.810> three<00:07:06.990> different<00:07:07.440> ways<00:07:07.740> of

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:07.890 
these are three different ways of

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:11.630 
these are three different ways of
accomplishing<00:07:08.540> the<00:07:09.540> same<00:07:09.980> kind<00:07:10.980> of<00:07:11.130> thing<00:07:11.340> in

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:11.640 
accomplishing the same kind of thing in

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:13.280 
accomplishing the same kind of thing in
other<00:07:11.790> words<00:07:12.000> you're<00:07:12.120> refining<00:07:12.720> the<00:07:12.900> mass<00:07:13.080> you

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:13.290 
other words you're refining the mass you

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:16.790 
other words you're refining the mass you
can<00:07:14.060> so<00:07:15.060> to<00:07:15.120> speak<00:07:15.330> make<00:07:15.630> it<00:07:15.750> more<00:07:15.930> convex<00:07:16.440> in

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:16.800 
can so to speak make it more convex in

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:20.630 
can so to speak make it more convex in
that<00:07:17.580> selection<00:07:18.230> and<00:07:19.230> then<00:07:20.100> you'll<00:07:20.280> have<00:07:20.460> to

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:20.640 
that selection and then you'll have to

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:22.310 
that selection and then you'll have to
deal<00:07:20.820> with<00:07:21.030> you<00:07:21.420> know<00:07:21.510> the<00:07:21.540> problems<00:07:22.080> that<00:07:22.110> can

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:22.320 
deal with you know the problems that can

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:24.170 
deal with you know the problems that can
happen<00:07:22.500> you<00:07:22.710> can<00:07:22.920> get<00:07:23.100> you<00:07:23.610> know<00:07:23.700> this<00:07:23.880> kind<00:07:24.120> of

00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:24.180 
happen you can get you know this kind of

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:26.120 
happen you can get you know this kind of
problem<00:07:24.420> or<00:07:24.750> that<00:07:24.780> you're<00:07:25.140> getting<00:07:25.320> too<00:07:25.950> much

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:26.130 
problem or that you're getting too much

00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:28.880 
problem or that you're getting too much
selection<00:07:26.670> so<00:07:27.390> that's<00:07:27.570> just<00:07:27.720> a<00:07:28.050> decision<00:07:28.770> you

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:28.890 
selection so that's just a decision you

00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:31.610 
selection so that's just a decision you
have<00:07:29.040> to<00:07:29.070> make<00:07:29.660> how<00:07:30.660> you<00:07:30.720> want<00:07:30.990> your<00:07:31.050> mesh<00:07:31.410> to

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:31.620 
have to make how you want your mesh to

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:35.150 
have to make how you want your mesh to
what<00:07:32.280> you<00:07:32.690> what<00:07:33.690> you<00:07:33.720> want<00:07:34.140> your<00:07:34.320> topology<00:07:34.740> to

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:35.160 
what you what you want your topology to

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:38.270 
what you what you want your topology to
look<00:07:35.340> like<00:07:35.580> and<00:07:36.270> I'm<00:07:36.930> going<00:07:37.110> to<00:07:37.170> go<00:07:37.320> back<00:07:37.530> sorry

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:38.280 
look like and I'm going to go back sorry

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:40.040 
look like and I'm going to go back sorry
I'm<00:07:38.430> going<00:07:38.580> to<00:07:38.670> go<00:07:38.730> back<00:07:38.880> to<00:07:38.910> object<00:07:39.330> mode<00:07:39.660> and

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:40.050 
I'm going to go back to object mode and

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:42.590 
I'm going to go back to object mode and
I'll<00:07:40.260> right<00:07:41.130> click<00:07:41.160> mouse<00:07:41.670> on<00:07:41.880> the<00:07:41.970> camera<00:07:42.420> and

00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:42.600 
I'll right click mouse on the camera and

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:48.140 
I'll right click mouse on the camera and
then<00:07:43.290> I'll<00:07:43.590> do<00:07:44.480> g<00:07:45.480> +<00:07:45.750> ZZ<00:07:46.470> and<00:07:47.100> then<00:07:47.550> I<00:07:47.700> can<00:07:47.910> be

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:48.150 
then I'll do g + ZZ and then I can be

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:51.770 
then I'll do g + ZZ and then I can be
the<00:07:48.300> mouse<00:07:49.170> moving<00:07:49.680> closer<00:07:50.130> than<00:07:51.060> G<00:07:51.330> I<00:07:51.360> can

00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:51.780 
the mouse moving closer than G I can

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:54.800 
the mouse moving closer than G I can
just<00:07:51.930> move<00:07:52.320> the<00:07:52.560> camera<00:07:52.800> like<00:07:53.100> this<00:07:53.130> and<00:07:54.120> the

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:54.810 
just move the camera like this and the

00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:57.200 
just move the camera like this and the
render<00:07:55.110> it

00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:57.210 
render it

00:07:57.210 --> 00:08:03.219 
render it
and<00:07:57.660> this<00:07:58.229> is<00:07:58.430> you<00:07:59.430> know<00:07:59.460> the<00:07:59.669> mesh<00:07:59.850> we<00:08:00.060> got<00:08:01.850> so

00:08:03.219 --> 00:08:03.229 
and this is you know the mesh we got so

00:08:03.229 --> 00:08:08.570 
and this is you know the mesh we got so
this<00:08:04.229> concludes<00:08:04.560> this<00:08:05.160> tutorial<00:08:05.960> and<00:08:07.550> I<00:08:08.550> hope

00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:08.580 
this concludes this tutorial and I hope
