00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:05.500 
leg and then torn arm and then we have

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.789 
leg and then torn arm and then we have
back<00:01:06.039> leg<00:01:06.340> and<00:01:06.640> back<00:01:07.329> arm<00:01:07.570> and<00:01:07.810> those<00:01:08.500> are

back leg and back arm and those are

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:12.359 
back leg and back arm and those are
visible<00:01:09.250> so<00:01:10.149> on<00:01:10.420> the<00:01:10.630> next<00:01:10.780> frame<00:01:11.049> you<00:01:11.979> can<00:01:12.100> see

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:12.369 
visible so on the next frame you can see

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:16.109 
visible so on the next frame you can see
now<00:01:12.579> that<00:01:13.109> back<00:01:14.109> arm<00:01:14.409> is<00:01:14.560> hidden<00:01:14.890> torn<00:01:15.670> arm<00:01:15.969> is

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:16.119 
now that back arm is hidden torn arm is

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:18.389 
now that back arm is hidden torn arm is
visible<00:01:16.479> the<00:01:17.170> reason<00:01:17.530> for<00:01:17.679> this<00:01:17.859> is<00:01:18.130> because

00:01:18.389 --> 00:01:18.399 
visible the reason for this is because

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:22.200 
visible the reason for this is because
back<00:01:19.149> arm<00:01:19.450> if<00:01:20.170> I<00:01:20.350> go<00:01:20.530> back<00:01:20.710> and<00:01:21.039> I<00:01:21.880> use<00:01:22.030> my

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.210 
back arm if I go back and I use my

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.289 
back arm if I go back and I use my
transform<00:01:22.810> bone<00:01:23.049> tool<00:01:23.289> is<00:01:23.909> still<00:01:24.909> linked<00:01:25.270> to

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:25.299 
transform bone tool is still linked to

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:31.230 
transform bone tool is still linked to
that<00:01:25.509> arm<00:01:26.820> then<00:01:27.820> the<00:01:28.119> next<00:01:28.600> frame<00:01:29.310> if<00:01:30.310> we<00:01:31.060> move

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
that arm then the next frame if we move

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.050 
that arm then the next frame if we move
the<00:01:31.390> bone<00:01:31.539> now<00:01:31.780> you<00:01:32.259> can<00:01:32.439> see<00:01:32.679> that<00:01:32.950> since<00:01:33.670> that

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060 
the bone now you can see that since that

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.989 
the bone now you can see that since that
back<00:01:34.299> arm<00:01:34.569> is<00:01:34.749> hidden<00:01:35.079> this<00:01:35.890> new<00:01:36.130> torn<00:01:36.490> arm<00:01:36.789> is

00:01:36.989 --> 00:01:36.999 
back arm is hidden this new torn arm is

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:39.510 
back arm is hidden this new torn arm is
actually<00:01:37.509> not<00:01:37.659> linked<00:01:38.170> to<00:01:38.289> those<00:01:38.560> bones<00:01:38.829> it's

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
actually not linked to those bones it's

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.969 
actually not linked to those bones it's
independent<00:01:40.270> so<00:01:41.109> that's<00:01:41.259> how<00:01:41.409> we<00:01:41.469> were<00:01:41.679> able

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:41.979 
independent so that's how we were able

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:44.459 
independent so that's how we were able
to<00:01:42.009> pull<00:01:42.280> this<00:01:42.429> off<00:01:42.640> but<00:01:43.630> with<00:01:44.170> the<00:01:44.319> new

now<00:02:12.330> it's<00:02:13.330> going<00:02:13.570> to<00:02:13.600> look<00:02:13.780> a<00:02:13.840> little<00:02:14.110> bit

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319 
now it's going to look a little bit

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:16.410 
now it's going to look a little bit
because<00:02:14.920> it<00:02:15.040> wasn't<00:02:15.400> meant<00:02:15.579> to<00:02:15.670> operate<00:02:15.939> this

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
because it wasn't meant to operate this

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.509 
because it wasn't meant to operate this
way<00:02:16.659> as<00:02:16.900> you<00:02:17.230> can<00:02:17.260> see<00:02:17.590> we<00:02:17.890> have<00:02:18.040> some<00:02:18.249> things

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:18.519 
way as you can see we have some things

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:20.250 
way as you can see we have some things
kind<00:02:18.700> of<00:02:18.790> occurring<00:02:19.150> where<00:02:19.329> we<00:02:19.989> have<00:02:20.139> the

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
kind of occurring where we have the

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:22.920 
kind of occurring where we have the
sleeve<00:02:20.499> in<00:02:20.590> the<00:02:20.680> arm<00:02:20.859> doing<00:02:21.519> this<00:02:21.700> but<00:02:22.569> my

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
sleeve in the arm doing this but my

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.129 
sleeve in the arm doing this but my
focus<00:02:23.590> here<00:02:24.040> is<00:02:24.450> after<00:02:25.450> it<00:02:25.569> falls<00:02:25.810> into<00:02:26.049> the

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:26.139 
focus here is after it falls into the

00:02:26.139 --> 00:02:30.119 
focus here is after it falls into the
basket<00:02:26.790> when<00:02:27.790> the<00:02:27.969> farmer<00:02:28.599> moves<00:02:28.900> again<00:02:29.290> you

00:02:30.119 --> 00:02:30.129 
basket when the farmer moves again you

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:32.459 
basket when the farmer moves again you
can<00:02:30.280> see<00:02:30.430> it<00:02:30.519> happens<00:02:30.760> right<00:02:30.909> here<00:02:31.150> the<00:02:31.959> arms

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:32.469 
can see it happens right here the arms

00:02:32.469 --> 00:02:34.679 
can see it happens right here the arms
move<00:02:32.799> along<00:02:33.040> with<00:02:33.609> him<00:02:33.939> and<00:02:34.180> that's<00:02:34.329> because

00:02:34.679 --> 00:02:34.689 
move along with him and that's because

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:37.619 
move along with him and that's because
this<00:02:35.200> bones<00:02:35.469> moving<00:02:35.889> and<00:02:36.069> this<00:02:37.030> bone<00:02:37.359> is

00:02:37.619 --> 00:02:37.629 
this bones moving and this bone is

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:39.809 
this bones moving and this bone is
linked<00:02:37.870> to<00:02:37.959> that<00:02:38.079> bone<00:02:38.349> and<00:02:38.379> this<00:02:39.310> arm<00:02:39.639> is

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:39.819 
linked to that bone and this arm is

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:42.030 
linked to that bone and this arm is
linked<00:02:40.120> to<00:02:40.209> that<00:02:40.389> bone<00:02:40.629> so<00:02:41.079> you're<00:02:41.620> gonna<00:02:41.799> have

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
linked to that bone so you're gonna have

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.409 
linked to that bone so you're gonna have
the<00:02:42.189> hierarchy<00:02:42.639> you<00:02:42.669> come<00:02:42.849> into<00:02:43.000> play<00:02:43.209> and

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:43.419 
the hierarchy you come into play and

00:02:43.419 --> 00:02:45.059 
the hierarchy you come into play and
it's<00:02:43.540> gonna<00:02:43.629> move<00:02:43.870> your<00:02:44.019> bones<00:02:44.230> around<00:02:44.439> when

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:45.069 
it's gonna move your bones around when

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:48.780 
it's gonna move your bones around when
you<00:02:45.159> don't<00:02:45.340> want<00:02:45.519> them<00:02:45.700> to<00:02:46.139> but<00:02:47.139> now<00:02:47.400> if<00:02:48.400> I<00:02:48.579> were

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
you don't want them to but now if I were

you don't want them to but now if I were
to<00:02:49.000> reintroduce<00:02:49.629> bone<00:02:50.290> parenting<00:02:50.889> here<00:02:51.099> come

00:02:51.869 --> 00:02:51.879 
to reintroduce bone parenting here come

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:54.869 
to reintroduce bone parenting here come
in<00:02:52.000> like<00:02:52.150> this<00:02:52.359> and<00:02:52.949> let's<00:02:53.949> say<00:02:54.159> right<00:02:54.579> about

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
see we have a new keyframe that appears

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:20.789 
see we have a new keyframe that appears
right<00:03:20.079> down<00:03:20.290> here

00:03:20.789 --> 00:03:20.799 
right down here

right down here
the<00:03:21.159> reparent<00:03:21.729> bone<00:03:22.239> tool<00:03:22.620> channel<00:03:23.620> and<00:03:23.859> this

00:03:24.719 --> 00:03:24.729 
the reparent bone tool channel and this

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:26.699 
the reparent bone tool channel and this
is<00:03:24.879> indicating<00:03:25.359> that<00:03:25.389> there<00:03:25.900> is<00:03:26.019> a<00:03:26.049> change<00:03:26.439> now

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
is indicating that there is a change now

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:28.469 
is indicating that there is a change now
with<00:03:27.069> that<00:03:27.310> bone<00:03:27.519> something<00:03:28.120> is<00:03:28.269> being

00:03:28.469 --> 00:03:28.479 
with that bone something is being

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:30.809 
with that bone something is being
repented<00:03:29.009> halfway<00:03:30.009> through<00:03:30.189> the<00:03:30.250> animation

00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:30.819 
repented halfway through the animation

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:33.629 
repented halfway through the animation
now<00:03:31.379> if<00:03:32.379> I<00:03:32.439> continue<00:03:32.919> on<00:03:32.949> here<00:03:33.430> you're<00:03:33.549> gonna

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:35.049 
see some movement and that's because

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:37.349 
see some movement and that's because
this<00:03:35.319> bone<00:03:35.680> right<00:03:35.979> now<00:03:36.579> is<00:03:36.879> moving

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:37.359 
this bone right now is moving

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:40.319 
this bone right now is moving
independently<00:03:38.259> as<00:03:38.470> you<00:03:38.680> can<00:03:38.799> see<00:03:39.040> and<00:03:39.280> we<00:03:40.150> have

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:40.329 
independently as you can see and we have

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:42.689 
independently as you can see and we have
the<00:03:40.479> arm<00:03:40.629> still<00:03:40.959> attached<00:03:41.229> to<00:03:41.379> that<00:03:41.500> bone<00:03:41.769> so

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:42.699 
the arm still attached to that bone so

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:44.039 
the arm still attached to that bone so
if<00:03:42.790> I<00:03:42.849> come<00:03:43.030> down<00:03:43.209> here<00:03:43.239> just<00:03:43.810> to<00:03:43.900> demonstrate

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:44.049 
if I come down here just to demonstrate

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:47.819 
if I come down here just to demonstrate
I'm<00:03:44.709> going<00:03:45.579> to<00:03:45.790> remove<00:03:46.299> all<00:03:46.780> these<00:03:47.259> keyframes

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:47.829 
I'm going to remove all these keyframes

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:50.789 
I'm going to remove all these keyframes
right<00:03:48.069> here<00:03:48.280> for<00:03:48.459> that<00:03:48.489> bone<00:03:49.470> just<00:03:50.470> remove

00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:50.799 
right here for that bone just remove

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:52.649 
right here for that bone just remove
them<00:03:50.859> like<00:03:51.009> that<00:03:51.220> and<00:03:51.489> we<00:03:52.180> just<00:03:52.209> come<00:03:52.540> over

00:03:52.649 --> 00:03:52.659 
them like that and we just come over

00:03:52.659 --> 00:03:53.939 
them like that and we just come over
make<00:03:53.109> sure<00:03:53.290> there's<00:03:53.470> no<00:03:53.590> more<00:03:53.739> other

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:53.949 
make sure there's no more other

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:56.189 
make sure there's no more other
keyframes<00:03:54.519> that<00:03:54.849> could<00:03:55.030> be<00:03:55.199> potentially

00:03:56.189 --> 00:03:56.199 
keyframes that could be potentially

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:58.399 
keyframes that could be potentially
messing<00:03:56.470> with<00:03:56.650> this<00:03:56.949> and<00:03:57.219> I<00:03:57.250> think<00:03:57.340> we're<00:03:57.699> okay

00:03:58.399 --> 00:03:58.409 
messing with this and I think we're okay

00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:04.490 
messing with this and I think we're okay
so<00:03:59.409> now<00:03:59.560> as<00:04:00.069> you<00:04:00.129> can<00:04:00.310> see<00:04:00.870> the<00:04:01.870> body<00:04:02.579> can<00:04:03.579> move

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
so now as you can see the body can move

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.249 
so now as you can see the body can move
any<00:04:05.500> way<00:04:05.620> it<00:04:05.799> wants<00:04:06.060> but<00:04:07.060> these<00:04:07.269> arm<00:04:07.599> pieces

00:04:08.249 --> 00:04:08.259 
any way it wants but these arm pieces

00:04:08.259 --> 00:04:11.129 
any way it wants but these arm pieces
are<00:04:08.530> not<00:04:08.979> moving<00:04:09.250> along<00:04:09.549> with<00:04:09.729> it<00:04:09.969> and<00:04:10.209> now<00:04:10.959> in

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:11.139 
are not moving along with it and now in

00:04:11.139 --> 00:04:12.929 
are not moving along with it and now in
this<00:04:11.259> case<00:04:11.500> when<00:04:12.069> it<00:04:12.189> comes<00:04:12.370> to<00:04:12.489> the<00:04:12.609> actual

00:04:12.929 --> 00:04:12.939 
this case when it comes to the actual

00:04:12.939 --> 00:04:15.420 
this case when it comes to the actual
arm<00:04:13.150> animation<00:04:13.659> I<00:04:13.829> could<00:04:14.829> go<00:04:14.949> into<00:04:15.099> the<00:04:15.280> arm

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
arm animation I could go into the arm

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:18.599 
arm animation I could go into the arm
itself<00:04:15.879> and<00:04:16.560> you<00:04:17.560> can<00:04:17.709> see<00:04:17.889> now<00:04:18.039> we<00:04:18.099> have<00:04:18.370> some

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:18.609 
itself and you can see now we have some

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:20.849 
itself and you can see now we have some
issues<00:04:18.940> occurring<00:04:19.269> just<00:04:19.840> with<00:04:19.989> how<00:04:20.139> it<00:04:20.289> comes

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:20.859 
issues occurring just with how it comes

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:22.860 
issues occurring just with how it comes
up<00:04:21.070> like<00:04:21.280> this<00:04:21.519> and<00:04:21.820> that<00:04:22.360> has<00:04:22.479> to<00:04:22.570> do<00:04:22.690> with<00:04:22.779> the

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:22.870 
up like this and that has to do with the

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:24.420 
up like this and that has to do with the
fact<00:04:23.080> I<00:04:23.199> have<00:04:23.409> all<00:04:23.560> these<00:04:23.710> different<00:04:23.770> channels

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
fact I have all these different channels

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:25.740 
fact I have all these different channels
so<00:04:24.699> I<00:04:24.760> could<00:04:24.909> go<00:04:24.969> in<00:04:25.120> there<00:04:25.300> and<00:04:25.510> try<00:04:25.719> to

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
so I could go in there and try to

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:28.080 
so I could go in there and try to
rearrange<00:04:26.320> that<00:04:26.740> so<00:04:27.070> this<00:04:27.310> makes

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.090 
rearrange that so this makes

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:30.720 
rearrange that so this makes
but<00:04:28.630> the<00:04:28.750> focus<00:04:29.020> here<00:04:29.500> is<00:04:29.650> a<00:04:29.920> fact<00:04:30.250> now<00:04:30.430> that<00:04:30.460> I

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:30.730 
but the focus here is a fact now that I

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:33.210 
but the focus here is a fact now that I
can<00:04:30.910> reparent<00:04:31.510> these<00:04:32.140> layers<00:04:32.560> halfway

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:33.220 
can reparent these layers halfway

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:37.290 
can reparent these layers halfway
through<00:04:33.520> without<00:04:34.360> any<00:04:34.720> issue<00:04:35.400> if<00:04:36.400> you'd<00:04:37.210> like

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:37.300 
through without any issue if you'd like
