and<00:00:16.230> the<00:00:16.410> MSMC<00:00:16.980> and<00:00:17.520> going<00:00:18.359> into<00:00:18.570> a<00:00:18.600> bit<00:00:18.750> about

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
and the MSMC and going into a bit about

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.330 
and the MSMC and going into a bit about
attachments<00:00:19.560> and<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:19.740> way<00:00:19.830> I<00:00:19.859> do<00:00:19.980> weapon

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
attachments and the way I do weapon

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.130 
attachments and the way I do weapon
breakdowns<00:00:20.760> is<00:00:20.939> based<00:00:21.119> off<00:00:21.270> experience<00:00:21.900> and

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
breakdowns is based off experience and

the attachments and preferred play
styles<00:00:24.869> of<00:00:25.019> what<00:00:25.320> I<00:00:25.350> think<00:00:25.650> actually<00:00:25.859> go<00:00:26.099> best

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
styles of what I think actually go best

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.580 
styles of what I think actually go best
with<00:00:26.550> the<00:00:26.730> weapon<00:00:27.029> so<00:00:27.990> let's<00:00:28.140> get<00:00:28.260> quickly

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
with the weapon so let's get quickly

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.560 
with the weapon so let's get quickly
into<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:28.980> stats<00:00:29.369> of<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.640> m27<00:00:30.060> before<00:00:30.480> we

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
into the stats of the m27 before we

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.330 
into the stats of the m27 before we
start<00:00:30.779> off<00:00:30.900> to<00:00:31.080> my<00:00:31.230> uh<00:00:31.260> my<00:00:31.560> personal<00:00:32.130> play

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
start off to my uh my personal play

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.459 
start off to my uh my personal play
style<00:00:32.669> and<00:00:32.880> why<00:00:32.969> I<00:00:33.000> think<00:00:33.149> this<00:00:33.390> gun<00:00:33.719> or<00:00:34.200> what<00:00:34.440> I

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
style and why I think this gun or what I

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.170 
style and why I think this gun or what I
think<00:00:34.710> this<00:00:34.800> gun<00:00:35.010> can<00:00:35.280> be<00:00:35.309> used<00:00:35.640> for<00:00:35.760> in<00:00:36.090> the

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
think this gun can be used for in the

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.959 
think this gun can be used for in the
best<00:00:36.360> of<00:00:36.450> situations<00:00:36.630> so<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.710> m27<00:00:38.219> generally

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
best of situations so the m27 generally

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.600 
best of situations so the m27 generally
from<00:00:39.270> a<00:00:39.450> close-range<00:00:40.260> distance<00:00:40.800> is<00:00:40.980> going<00:00:41.550> to

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
from a close-range distance is going to

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.670 
from a close-range distance is going to
do<00:00:41.700> about<00:00:41.850> 33<00:00:42.570> points<00:00:42.930> of<00:00:43.050> damage<00:00:43.230> from

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
do about 33 points of damage from

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.819 
do about 33 points of damage from
closest<00:00:44.370> range<00:00:44.640> and<00:00:44.910> about<00:00:45.180> 22<00:00:45.690> from<00:00:46.110> minimum

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
closest range and about 22 from minimum

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.950 
closest range and about 22 from minimum
damage<00:00:47.070> at<00:00:47.309> long<00:00:47.489> range<00:00:47.789> that<00:00:48.480> means<00:00:48.690> that<00:00:48.870> the

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
damage at long range that means that the

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.439 
damage at long range that means that the
m27<00:00:49.469> no<00:00:49.739> matter<00:00:49.950> what<00:00:50.309> depending<00:00:50.940> on<00:00:51.059> whatever

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
m27 no matter what depending on whatever

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.240 
m27 no matter what depending on whatever
distance<00:00:51.870> you<00:00:52.140> add<00:00:52.260> or<00:00:52.469> how<00:00:52.559> close<00:00:52.860> you<00:00:53.070> get

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
distance you add or how close you get

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.860 
distance you add or how close you get
unless<00:00:53.850> you're<00:00:54.000> eating<00:00:54.180> people<00:00:54.390> in<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.629> head

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
unless you're eating people in the head

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.930 
unless you're eating people in the head
you're<00:00:55.379> doing<00:00:55.590> 33<00:00:56.070> points<00:00:56.340> of<00:00:56.430> damage<00:00:56.579> and

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
you're doing 33 points of damage and

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.420 
you're doing 33 points of damage and
that<00:00:57.210> is<00:00:57.449> still<00:00:57.750> full<00:00:58.140> points<00:00:58.590> or<00:00:58.859> four<00:00:59.160> shots

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
that is still full points or four shots

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.819 
that is still full points or four shots
to<00:00:59.640> go<00:00:59.820> when<00:01:00.690> it<00:01:00.780> comes<00:01:00.960> to<00:01:01.109> minimum<00:01:01.410> damage<00:01:01.559> it

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
to go when it comes to minimum damage it

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.070 
to go when it comes to minimum damage it
is<00:01:01.949> 22<00:01:02.550> that<00:01:03.210> means<00:01:03.390> it's<00:01:03.510> going<00:01:03.629> to<00:01:03.750> take<00:01:03.899> you

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
is 22 that means it's going to take you

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.250 
is 22 that means it's going to take you
about<00:01:04.350> five<00:01:04.860> bullets<00:01:05.309> to<00:01:05.430> kill<00:01:05.460> somebody<00:01:05.850> um

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:06.260 
about five bullets to kill somebody um

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.690 
about five bullets to kill somebody um
this<00:01:07.260> is<00:01:07.439> actually<00:01:07.770> quite<00:01:07.890> a<00:01:08.010> bit<00:01:08.220> so<00:01:08.430> but

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
this is actually quite a bit so but

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.520 
this is actually quite a bit so but
what's<00:01:09.060> nice<00:01:09.180> is<00:01:09.240> it<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.540> jump<00:01:09.810> between<00:01:09.960> close

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
what's nice is it the jump between close

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.219 
what's nice is it the jump between close
range<00:01:10.830> distance<00:01:11.070> close<00:01:11.970> range<00:01:12.270> close<00:01:12.900> range

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
range distance close range close range

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.740 
range distance close range close range
deaths<00:01:13.530> to<00:01:13.890> long<00:01:14.220> range<00:01:14.460> deaths<00:01:14.790> are<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.509> fact

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
deaths to long range deaths are the fact

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.179 
deaths to long range deaths are the fact
that<00:01:15.840> you<00:01:16.049> just<00:01:16.080> have<00:01:16.350> one<00:01:16.619> extra<00:01:16.890> bullet

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
that you just have one extra bullet

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.490 
that you just have one extra bullet
which<00:01:17.310> isn't<00:01:17.580> bad<00:01:17.610> because<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.540> m27<00:01:19.140> when<00:01:19.409> it

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
which isn't bad because the m27 when it

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.899 
which isn't bad because the m27 when it
comes<00:01:19.710> to<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:19.920> majority<00:01:20.250> of<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.759> other

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
comes to the majority of the other

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.490 
comes to the majority of the other
assault<00:01:21.210> rifles<00:01:21.270> in<00:01:21.630> this<00:01:21.750> game<00:01:21.960> tends<00:01:22.320> to

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
assault rifles in this game tends to

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.070 
assault rifles in this game tends to
kick<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:23.130> least<00:01:23.460> of<00:01:23.729> any<00:01:24.119> of<00:01:24.299> them<00:01:24.420> there's

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
kick the least of any of them there's

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.810 
kick the least of any of them there's
this<00:01:25.259> odd<00:01:25.500> conversation<00:01:26.009> that<00:01:26.430> you<00:01:26.549> can<00:01:26.670> have

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
this odd conversation that you can have

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.179 
this odd conversation that you can have
about<00:01:26.970> weapons<00:01:27.540> that<00:01:27.720> visually<00:01:28.439> kick<00:01:28.740> and<00:01:28.979> how

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
about weapons that visually kick and how

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.819 
about weapons that visually kick and how
spattered<00:01:30.150> the<00:01:30.299> fire<00:01:30.570> actually<00:01:30.900> is<00:01:31.470> but<00:01:31.680> the

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
spattered the fire actually is but the

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.219 
spattered the fire actually is but the
m47<00:01:32.369> doesn't<00:01:33.119> kick<00:01:33.270> very<00:01:33.509> much<00:01:33.720> and<00:01:33.930> the

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
m47 doesn't kick very much and the

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.319 
m47 doesn't kick very much and the
gunfire<00:01:34.710> itself<00:01:35.250> actually<00:01:35.490> doesn't<00:01:36.060> spatter

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
gunfire itself actually doesn't spatter

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:37.819 
gunfire itself actually doesn't spatter
very<00:01:36.600> much<00:01:36.780> either<00:01:36.960> so<00:01:37.259> most<00:01:37.439> of<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.619> shots

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
very much either so most of the shots

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.350 
very much either so most of the shots
that<00:01:37.979> you<00:01:38.159> put<00:01:38.340> up<00:01:38.460> with<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.700> gun<00:01:38.880> even<00:01:39.150> from<00:01:39.299> a

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
that you put up with the gun even from a

that you put up with the gun even from a
long<00:01:39.570> range<00:01:39.810> are<00:01:40.409> going<00:01:40.590> to<00:01:40.650> do<00:01:40.710> fairly<00:01:40.950> good

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
long range are going to do fairly good

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:42.770 
long range are going to do fairly good
damage<00:01:41.549> because<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.210> difference<00:01:42.540> is<00:01:42.630> only

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
damage because the difference is only

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.990 
damage because the difference is only

running ghost or not but it's just one

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
of those things that definitely

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.260

definitely you find yourself using an

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
alone in the long run like a lot of

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.620 
alone in the long run like a lot of
weapons<00:02:05.100> I<00:02:05.399> end<00:02:05.520> up<00:02:05.579> going<00:02:05.939> the<00:02:05.969> most<00:02:06.299> to<00:02:06.479> the

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
weapons I end up going the most to the

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:07.940 
weapons I end up going the most to the
guns<00:02:06.810> that<00:02:06.899> actually<00:02:07.350> work<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:07.649> best<00:02:07.829> with

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
guns that actually work the best with

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.919 
guns that actually work the best with
silencers<00:02:08.700> because<00:02:09.479> you<00:02:09.569> just<00:02:09.750> find<00:02:09.899> that

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
silencers because you just find that

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.540 
silencers because you just find that
your<00:02:10.110> performance<00:02:10.530> works<00:02:10.770> the<00:02:10.979> most<00:02:11.190> with

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
your performance works the most with

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.580 
your performance works the most with
those<00:02:11.670> guns<00:02:12.030> now<00:02:12.720> when<00:02:12.990> it<00:02:13.110> comes<00:02:13.140> to<00:02:13.560> a

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
those guns now when it comes to a

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.320 
those guns now when it comes to a
certain<00:02:14.250> other<00:02:14.430> aspects<00:02:14.970> since<00:02:15.150> the

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
certain other aspects since the

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.120 
certain other aspects since the
concentrated<00:02:15.960> fire<00:02:16.200> is<00:02:16.440> kind<00:02:16.680> of<00:02:16.770> similar<00:02:16.950> to

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
concentrated fire is kind of similar to

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:18.830 
concentrated fire is kind of similar to
some<00:02:17.400> previous<00:02:17.820> weapons<00:02:18.150> it's<00:02:18.330> not<00:02:18.480> as<00:02:18.630> good

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
some previous weapons it's not as good

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.020 
some previous weapons it's not as good
as<00:02:19.050> like<00:02:19.200> the<00:02:19.320> ACR<00:02:19.860> for<00:02:20.100> modern<00:02:20.340> warfare<00:02:20.490> 3<00:02:20.670> or

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
as like the ACR for modern warfare 3 or

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.510 
as like the ACR for modern warfare 3 or
the<00:02:21.150> ACR<00:02:21.600> laser<00:02:21.990> gun<00:02:22.170> from<00:02:22.440> modern<00:02:23.070> warfare<00:02:23.220> 2

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
the ACR laser gun from modern warfare 2

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.160 
the ACR laser gun from modern warfare 2
it's<00:02:23.730> not<00:02:23.910> quite<00:02:24.120> on<00:02:24.240> board<00:02:24.450> a<00:02:24.510> laser<00:02:24.780> but<00:02:25.080> it

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
it's not quite on board a laser but it

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.860 
it's not quite on board a laser but it
is<00:02:25.320> the<00:02:25.530> equivalent<00:02:25.920> in<00:02:26.370> this<00:02:26.640> game<00:02:26.880> now<00:02:27.840> to

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
is the equivalent in this game now to

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.570 
is the equivalent in this game now to
use<00:02:28.110> it<00:02:28.290> in<00:02:28.410> certain<00:02:28.650> situations<00:02:28.800> this<00:02:29.370> means

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
use it in certain situations this means

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.430 
use it in certain situations this means
that<00:02:29.670> it's<00:02:30.330> probably<00:02:30.540> the<00:02:30.780> best<00:02:30.990> between<00:02:31.410> a

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
that it's probably the best between a

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.820 
that it's probably the best between a
short<00:02:31.860> range<00:02:32.100> to<00:02:32.430> a<00:02:32.460> long<00:02:33.180> range<00:02:33.530> I'm<00:02:34.530> sorry<00:02:34.770> a

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
short range to a long range I'm sorry a

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.440 
short range to a long range I'm sorry a
short<00:02:35.070> range<00:02:35.220> to<00:02:35.370> like<00:02:35.490> a<00:02:35.520> medium<00:02:35.940> range<00:02:36.210> I

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
short range to like a medium range I

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:37.880 
short range to like a medium range I
actually<00:02:36.690> don't<00:02:36.960> like<00:02:37.080> this<00:02:37.350> weapon<00:02:37.710> from

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
actually don't like this weapon from

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.270 
actually don't like this weapon from
super<00:02:38.850> long<00:02:39.180> range<00:02:39.630> too<00:02:40.500> much<00:02:40.710> but<00:02:40.950> if<00:02:41.070> you

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
super long range too much but if you

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.250 
super long range too much but if you
keep<00:02:41.490> on<00:02:41.670> your<00:02:41.820> target<00:02:42.090> it<00:02:42.450> can<00:02:42.780> still<00:02:43.230> work

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
keep on your target it can still work

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.470 
keep on your target it can still work
out<00:02:43.800> five<00:02:44.160> bullets<00:02:44.520> to<00:02:44.640> put<00:02:44.790> a<00:02:44.820> guy<00:02:45.000> down<00:02:45.210> does

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
out five bullets to put a guy down does

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.870 
out five bullets to put a guy down does
take<00:02:45.720> quite<00:02:45.900> a<00:02:45.990> while<00:02:46.080> sometimes<00:02:46.590> but<00:02:47.100> in<00:02:47.280> some

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
take quite a while sometimes but in some

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.210 
take quite a while sometimes but in some
situations<00:02:48.480> because<00:02:48.840> of<00:02:48.990> that<00:02:49.140> distance<00:02:49.740> gap

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
situations because of that distance gap

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.820 
situations because of that distance gap
I<00:02:50.430> think<00:02:50.700> a<00:02:50.790> silencer<00:02:51.300> still<00:02:51.570> kind<00:02:51.990> of<00:02:52.110> work<00:02:52.440> so

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
I think a silencer still kind of work so

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.590 
I think a silencer still kind of work so
in<00:02:53.070> my<00:02:53.180> recommendation<00:02:54.180> I<00:02:54.270> would<00:02:54.300> use<00:02:54.570> a

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
in my recommendation I would use a

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.540 
in my recommendation I would use a
silencer<00:02:54.870> on<00:02:55.170> this<00:02:55.410> gun<00:02:55.620> in<00:02:55.800> this<00:02:56.250> situation

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
silencer on this gun in this situation

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.280 
silencer on this gun in this situation
here<00:02:56.940> I<00:02:57.000> had<00:02:57.120> not<00:02:57.360> used<00:02:57.600> the<00:02:57.780> target<00:02:58.080> finder

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
here I had not used the target finder

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.260 
here I had not used the target finder
much<00:02:58.530> when<00:02:58.860> I<00:02:58.890> actually<00:02:59.100> go<00:02:59.490> through<00:02:59.520> a<00:02:59.970> lot<00:03:00.240> of

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 
much when I actually go through a lot of

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:02.210 
much when I actually go through a lot of
weapons<00:03:00.540> I<00:03:00.840> try<00:03:01.050> to<00:03:01.080> see<00:03:01.320> what<00:03:01.500> just<00:03:01.650> works<00:03:01.980> out

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
weapons I try to see what just works out

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.700 
weapons I try to see what just works out
the<00:03:02.790> target<00:03:03.090> finder<00:03:03.270> isn't<00:03:03.690> that<00:03:03.900> bad<00:03:04.200> on<00:03:04.410> this

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:04.710 
the target finder isn't that bad on this

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:07.220 
the target finder isn't that bad on this
gun<00:03:04.950> because<00:03:05.190> it<00:03:05.370> holds<00:03:05.670> its<00:03:05.910> fire<00:03:06.360> within<00:03:06.810> the

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
gun because it holds its fire within the

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.310 
gun because it holds its fire within the
reticle<00:03:07.620> fairly<00:03:08.250> well<00:03:08.520> I<00:03:09.450> don't<00:03:10.020> recommend

the<00:03:29.130> iron<00:03:29.370> sights<00:03:29.550> on<00:03:29.730> this<00:03:29.820> gun<00:03:30.000> to<00:03:30.150> be<00:03:30.270> one<00:03:30.480> of

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
the iron sights on this gun to be one of

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.930 
the iron sights on this gun to be one of
the<00:03:30.630> best<00:03:30.870> of<00:03:31.110> all<00:03:31.440> the<00:03:31.920> all<00:03:32.430> the<00:03:32.489> assault

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
the best of all the all the assault

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.460 
the best of all the all the assault
rifles<00:03:33.270> so<00:03:33.810> i<00:03:33.870> don't<00:03:34.050> think<00:03:34.200> that's<00:03:34.290> exactly

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
rifles so i don't think that's exactly

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:37.340 
rifles so i don't think that's exactly
necessary<00:03:35.370> i<00:03:35.459> think<00:03:35.760> other<00:03:35.940> things<00:03:36.060> like<00:03:36.570> fast

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
necessary i think other things like fast

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.170 
necessary i think other things like fast
mags<00:03:37.680> are<00:03:37.890> actually<00:03:38.220> pretty<00:03:38.430> good<00:03:38.820> for<00:03:39.090> this

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
mags are actually pretty good for this

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.300 
mags are actually pretty good for this
weapon<00:03:39.720> the<00:03:40.110> reason<00:03:40.470> being<00:03:40.500> is<00:03:40.830> that<00:03:40.860> it<00:03:41.100> spits

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
weapon the reason being is that it spits

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.340 
weapon the reason being is that it spits
out<00:03:41.430> well<00:03:41.670> it's<00:03:41.820> fairly<00:03:42.300> fast<00:03:42.750> it's<00:03:43.080> not<00:03:43.230> the

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
out well it's fairly fast it's not the

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:44.840 
out well it's fairly fast it's not the
fastest<00:03:43.890> shooting<00:03:44.160> oh<00:03:44.250> I<00:03:44.280> thought<00:03:44.700> the

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
fastest shooting oh I thought the

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:46.400 
fastest shooting oh I thought the
fastest<00:03:45.239> shooting<00:03:45.510> one<00:03:45.630> by<00:03:45.750> any<00:03:45.930> means<00:03:46.170> but<00:03:46.290> it

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
fastest shooting one by any means but it

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:47.750 
fastest shooting one by any means but it
does<00:03:46.440> do<00:03:46.680> a<00:03:46.709> fairly<00:03:47.160> good<00:03:47.310> job<00:03:47.340> of<00:03:47.520> putting

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
does do a fairly good job of putting

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.360 
does do a fairly good job of putting
people<00:03:48.120> down<00:03:48.150> even<00:03:49.080> from<00:03:49.260> close<00:03:49.470> range<00:03:49.650> to

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
people down even from close range to

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.030 
people down even from close range to
give<00:03:50.459> you<00:03:50.550> a<00:03:50.610> quick<00:03:50.790> example<00:03:50.820> it's<00:03:51.450> RPM<00:03:51.900> is<00:03:52.080> 720

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
give you a quick example it's RPM is 720

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.550 
give you a quick example it's RPM is 720
making<00:03:53.580> it<00:03:53.670> similar<00:03:54.090> to<00:03:54.120> the<00:03:54.360> tar<00:03:54.750> and<00:03:55.410> that

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
making it similar to the tar and that

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:56.750 
making it similar to the tar and that
weapon<00:03:55.830> gets<00:03:56.010> a<00:03:56.070> lot<00:03:56.190> of<00:03:56.370> a<00:03:56.400> lot<00:03:56.670> of

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
weapon gets a lot of a lot of

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.180 
weapon gets a lot of a lot of
comparisons<00:03:57.180> to<00:03:57.480> the<00:03:57.660> m27<00:03:58.230> because<00:03:58.650> I<00:03:58.770> felt

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
comparisons to the m27 because I felt

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.190 
comparisons to the m27 because I felt
like<00:03:59.310> the<00:03:59.489> tar<00:03:59.790> in<00:03:59.910> the<00:04:00.000> m27<00:04:00.510> Ramos<00:04:00.900> like<00:04:01.050> the

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
like the tar in the m27 Ramos like the

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.440 
like the tar in the m27 Ramos like the
exact<00:04:01.560> same<00:04:02.250> gun<00:04:02.580> and<00:04:02.790> a<00:04:02.820> lot<00:04:02.940> of<00:04:02.970> regards

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
exact same gun and a lot of regards

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:04.880 
exact same gun and a lot of regards
because<00:04:03.720> they<00:04:03.840> had<00:04:03.930> this<00:04:04.080> similar<00:04:04.410> fire<00:04:04.680> rate

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
because they had this similar fire rate

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:07.040 
because they had this similar fire rate
they<00:04:05.040> had<00:04:05.190> similar<00:04:05.970> bullets<00:04:06.330> to<00:04:06.480> kill<00:04:06.510> in<00:04:06.870> some

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:07.050 
they had similar bullets to kill in some

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:09.050 
they had similar bullets to kill in some
situations<00:04:07.650> so<00:04:07.890> it's<00:04:08.160> it's<00:04:08.790> one<00:04:08.910> of<00:04:09.000> those

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
situations so it's it's one of those

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:10.250 
situations so it's it's one of those
things<00:04:09.120> where<00:04:09.300> you<00:04:09.420> just<00:04:09.450> got<00:04:09.660> to<00:04:09.690> figure<00:04:10.050> out

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
things where you just got to figure out

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.440 
things where you just got to figure out
and<00:04:10.560> what<00:04:10.800> you<00:04:10.830> want<00:04:11.310> out<00:04:11.489> of<00:04:11.580> your<00:04:11.850> weapon<00:04:12.300> and

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
and what you want out of your weapon and

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.240 
and what you want out of your weapon and
because<00:04:12.840> this<00:04:13.050> weapon<00:04:13.350> can<00:04:13.380> put<00:04:13.800> out<00:04:13.890> a<00:04:13.920> lot<00:04:14.160> of

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
because this weapon can put out a lot of

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:16.610 
because this weapon can put out a lot of
ammunition<00:04:14.519> kind<00:04:15.390> of<00:04:15.510> fast<00:04:15.750> with<00:04:16.019> its<00:04:16.200> 30<00:04:16.440> mm

30 round magazine I think fast mags can
be<00:04:18.930> pretty<00:04:19.109> good<00:04:19.320> um<00:04:19.530> silencer<00:04:20.430> absolutely

over<00:04:35.230> you<00:04:36.010> know<00:04:36.130> the<00:04:36.280> past<00:04:36.490> four<00:04:36.880> games<00:04:36.910> that

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:37.450 
over you know the past four games that

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:38.940 
over you know the past four games that
we've<00:04:37.570> been<00:04:37.720> playing<00:04:38.020> picking<00:04:38.680> out<00:04:38.800> the

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:38.950 
we've been playing picking out the

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:40.650 
we've been playing picking out the
targets<00:04:39.310> immediately<00:04:39.760> and<00:04:39.910> focusing<00:04:40.390> on<00:04:40.510> that

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:40.660 
targets immediately and focusing on that

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:42.090 
targets immediately and focusing on that
target<00:04:40.990> while<00:04:41.140> the<00:04:41.230> game<00:04:41.380> kind<00:04:41.590> of<00:04:41.710> just<00:04:41.830> does

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:42.100 
target while the game kind of just does

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.250 
target while the game kind of just does
it<00:04:42.280> for<00:04:42.310> you<00:04:42.700> the<00:04:43.150> way<00:04:43.300> it<00:04:43.360> kind<00:04:43.600> of<00:04:43.660> bugs<00:04:43.900> me<00:04:44.050> it

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:44.260 
it for you the way it kind of bugs me it

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:45.930 
it for you the way it kind of bugs me it
kind<00:04:44.440> of<00:04:44.470> makes<00:04:44.650> simplifies<00:04:45.430> it<00:04:45.640> to<00:04:45.700> the<00:04:45.790> point

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:45.940 
kind of makes simplifies it to the point

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:47.370 
kind of makes simplifies it to the point
of<00:04:46.060> which<00:04:46.210> that's<00:04:46.390> very<00:04:46.660> easy<00:04:46.750> but<00:04:47.200> if<00:04:47.320> you

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:47.380 
of which that's very easy but if you

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:49.200 
of which that's very easy but if you
have<00:04:47.500> difficulty<00:04:47.860> doing<00:04:48.040> that<00:04:48.340> by<00:04:48.790> all<00:04:48.970> means

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.210 
have difficulty doing that by all means

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:50.940 
have difficulty doing that by all means
use<00:04:49.450> it<00:04:49.630> I<00:04:49.810> kind<00:04:50.260> of<00:04:50.290> think<00:04:50.440> something<00:04:50.800> else

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:50.950 
use it I kind of think something else

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:53.580 
use it I kind of think something else
more<00:04:51.490> valuable<00:04:52.060> like<00:04:52.450> fast<00:04:52.720> mags<00:04:53.050> or<00:04:53.290> even

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:53.590 
more valuable like fast mags or even

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:55.530 
more valuable like fast mags or even
extended<00:04:54.040> mag<00:04:54.220> can<00:04:54.760> be<00:04:54.910> used<00:04:55.120> to<00:04:55.210> fill<00:04:55.510> that

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:55.540 
extended mag can be used to fill that

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:58.440 
extended mag can be used to fill that
slot<00:04:55.930> a<00:04:56.080> little<00:04:56.470> bit<00:04:56.590> better<00:04:56.710> overall<00:04:57.700> the<00:04:57.940> m27

00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:58.450 
slot a little bit better overall the m27

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:01.200 
slot a little bit better overall the m27
is<00:04:58.690> a<00:04:58.720> fairly<00:04:59.230> decent<00:04:59.610> assault<00:05:00.610> rifle<00:05:01.030> it's

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:01.210 
is a fairly decent assault rifle it's

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:02.850 
is a fairly decent assault rifle it's
not<00:05:01.390> it's<00:05:01.660> not<00:05:01.780> one<00:05:02.020> of<00:05:02.050> the<00:05:02.170> better<00:05:02.410> ones<00:05:02.500> I

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:02.860 
not it's not one of the better ones I

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:05.040 
not it's not one of the better ones I
think<00:05:03.160> on<00:05:03.400> this<00:05:03.640> is<00:05:03.790> the<00:05:03.910> equivalent<00:05:04.180> of<00:05:04.600> the

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:05.050 
think on this is the equivalent of the

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:07.290 
think on this is the equivalent of the
carbine<00:05:05.650> from<00:05:06.010> previous<00:05:06.430> Call<00:05:06.670> of<00:05:06.700> Duty's<00:05:07.090> and

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:07.300 
carbine from previous Call of Duty's and

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.230 
carbine from previous Call of Duty's and
I<00:05:08.170> think<00:05:08.650> that<00:05:08.890> it<00:05:09.100> kind<00:05:09.370> of<00:05:09.460> fits<00:05:09.670> in<00:05:09.850> the<00:05:09.940> same

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:10.240 
I think that it kind of fits in the same

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.180 
I think that it kind of fits in the same
category<00:05:10.870> as<00:05:11.050> previous<00:05:11.560> Call<00:05:11.740> of<00:05:11.770> Duty's<00:05:12.070> like

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:12.190 
category as previous Call of Duty's like

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:13.860 
category as previous Call of Duty's like
in<00:05:12.310> call<00:05:12.490> of<00:05:12.520> duty<00:05:12.610> for<00:05:12.940> the<00:05:12.970> carbine<00:05:13.450> wasn't

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:13.870 
in call of duty for the carbine wasn't

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:15.930 
in call of duty for the carbine wasn't
that<00:05:13.960> fantastic<00:05:14.170> it<00:05:15.040> lost<00:05:15.490> to<00:05:15.669> some<00:05:15.850> other

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:15.940 
that fantastic it lost to some other

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:19.380 
that fantastic it lost to some other
guns<00:05:16.210> maybe<00:05:16.480> round<00:05:16.750> like<00:05:16.990> the<00:05:17.140> g<00:05:17.290> 36<00:05:17.650> or<00:05:18.390> ak-47

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:19.390 
guns maybe round like the g 36 or ak-47

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:21.960 
guns maybe round like the g 36 or ak-47
stuff<00:05:19.600> like<00:05:19.780> that<00:05:19.810> and<00:05:20.169> in<00:05:20.800> modern<00:05:21.250> warfare<00:05:21.460> 2

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:21.970 
stuff like that and in modern warfare 2

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:23.790 
stuff like that and in modern warfare 2
is<00:05:22.210> kind<00:05:22.390> of<00:05:22.480> like<00:05:22.540> my<00:05:22.720> fun<00:05:22.960> weapon<00:05:23.290> carbines

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:23.800 
is kind of like my fun weapon carbines

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.440 
is kind of like my fun weapon carbines
always<00:05:24.040> looked<00:05:24.280> really<00:05:24.520> cool<00:05:24.820> which<00:05:25.150> is<00:05:25.300> why<00:05:25.419> I

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:25.450 
always looked really cool which is why I

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:27.659 
always looked really cool which is why I
like<00:05:26.290> using<00:05:26.590> it<00:05:26.830> the<00:05:26.919> most<00:05:27.100> and<00:05:27.220> it's<00:05:27.370> kind<00:05:27.610> of

00:05:27.659 --> 00:05:27.669 
like using it the most and it's kind of

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:29.010 
like using it the most and it's kind of
the<00:05:27.760> same<00:05:27.940> in<00:05:28.120> this<00:05:28.300> game<00:05:28.510> even<00:05:28.780> though<00:05:28.870> it's

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:29.020 
the same in this game even though it's

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:30.720 
the same in this game even though it's
got<00:05:29.169> a<00:05:29.380> different<00:05:29.410> name<00:05:30.040> so<00:05:30.280> what<00:05:30.490> do<00:05:30.550> you<00:05:30.640> guys

think<00:05:30.790> about<00:05:31.090> the<00:05:31.270> m27<00:05:31.750> do<00:05:32.260> you<00:05:32.320> think<00:05:32.470> it's<00:05:32.590> a

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:32.650 
think about the m27 do you think it's a

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:34.050 
think about the m27 do you think it's a
really<00:05:32.830> good<00:05:32.980> assault<00:05:33.460> rifle<00:05:33.760> or<00:05:33.790> do<00:05:34.000> you

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:35.680 
think you get strung by a lot of the

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.170 
think you get strung by a lot of the
other<00:05:35.830> burst<00:05:36.070> fire<00:05:36.340> guns<00:05:36.640> or<00:05:36.880> even<00:05:37.090> though
