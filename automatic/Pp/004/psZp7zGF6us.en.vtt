 0.6 and hairs cars it staff does not 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:18.400
 even model because we are going to leave the singles 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.070
 seeing with stores are things you go with 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.950
 can sleep and bet and then 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.510
 without heat I now shape to my color 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:27.580
 gets a really nice color from it 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:30.250
 it's on facebook though she wanted clips 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:32.860
 show but now a whole head 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.239
 full and then also a long hair 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.480
 her 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:41.100
 you start in layers there are life and work 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.100
 you turn to cerro mar 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:51.850

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:52.719

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.969
 beautiful 

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:56.589
 the point is that it is haram to be so 

00:00:54.969 --> 00:01:00.129
 actually should do it more conveniently 

00:00:56.589 --> 00:01:02.379
 A true love does not exist 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:03.819
 just not inferior to the world 

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:06.670
 traveling over 

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:08.470
 so I play it as wet as you want 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.810
 the curls last longer 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:13.180
 We will we pure force this way 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:18.000
 it was even longer she wants 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:18.000
 little foam steven freeze 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:32.400
 don't take a piece of hair the week now 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.400
 to do 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:38.950
 then I turn it under I then it 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:42.580
 easier and you get it 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:44.200
 a hook and so it's those two moles on it 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:46.060
 walk on photos to see how that goes on 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.410
 so see that you can on the website 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.750
 recover 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:53.140
 here I put the hair through 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:57.040
 I put it over the hair and then I pull 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:02:02.560
 the hair through it 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:05.110
 then you will show back again 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.510
 dress you grab a tuft of hair 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:10.810
 run well because all the hair has to 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:13.720
 end up in the hook for us now the 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.630
 hook around it and if you do that 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.960
 more worries that 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:23.940
 where the ends up then you pull it 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:26.510
 by do and if I want to back yourself 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.510

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:42.410
 Give a moment orange so the other side 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:42.410

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:48.150

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:53.040

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.920
 they wish we didn't have it in the shower 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:59.670
 never came so layman 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:01.080
 and orange and then turn again guilders 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:04.220
 the other way as you see should really 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.220
 all the hair in the hook 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:10.670
 not over the hair so through 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:16.410
 well we will repeat this for a while 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:19.440
 show the end result anyway 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:21.210
 so now all the twingles are in it 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.980
 wholesale orange runs both one 

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:24.960
 different color 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.150
 This just leaves you dry and up to the hair 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:30.270
 dry and if you're going to like him 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.620
 We thus show that we are back 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:34.440

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:36.450

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:40.950

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:48.960

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:51.050
 You have more open and you pull the hair there 

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:51.050
 from 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:04:02.730
 one more time I hope to pull myself 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:05.850

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:16.890
 I squeeze little and you pull it 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:18.930

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:21.120

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:23.880

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:27.060
