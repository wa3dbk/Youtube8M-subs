this next step because it not involves
one<00:00:35.640> flash<00:00:35.940> but<00:00:36.420> two<00:00:36.750> so<00:00:37.620> imagine<00:00:38.370> that<00:00:38.399> you're

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
one flash but two so imagine that you're

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.190 
one flash but two so imagine that you're
getting<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:39.059> biggest<00:00:39.300> bang<00:00:39.480> out<00:00:39.870> of<00:00:40.020> one

getting the biggest bang out of one
we're<00:00:40.469> going<00:00:40.559> to<00:00:40.649> double<00:00:40.980> that<00:00:41.010> bang<00:00:41.370> by<00:00:41.550> using

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
we're going to double that bang by using

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.209 
we're going to double that bang by using
two<00:00:41.969> flashes<00:00:42.510> as<00:00:42.719> well<00:00:43.140> as<00:00:43.379> a<00:00:43.410> couple<00:00:43.770> of<00:00:43.980> color

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
and that takes care of one flash now

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:32.440 
and that takes care of one flash now
you're<00:01:31.189> probably<00:01:31.340> thinking<00:01:31.520> well<00:01:31.970> that's<00:01:32.240> one

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
you're probably thinking well that's one

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:33.880 
you're probably thinking well that's one
but<00:01:32.689> what's<00:01:33.110> it<00:01:33.170> going<00:01:33.259> to<00:01:33.350> do<00:01:33.439> it<00:01:33.500> the<00:01:33.560> second

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
but what's it going to do it the second

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.210 
but what's it going to do it the second
flash<00:01:34.040> here<00:01:34.729> it<00:01:34.850> is<00:01:35.000> being<00:01:35.450> held<00:01:35.689> by<00:01:35.990> the

flash here it is being held by the

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.230 
flash here it is being held by the
wonderful<00:01:37.220> assistant<00:01:37.729> Amanda<00:01:38.090> who's

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
wonderful assistant Amanda who's

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.030 
wonderful assistant Amanda who's
participating<00:01:39.080> in<00:01:39.170> the<00:01:39.290> Seattle<00:01:39.680> workshop

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.040 
participating in the Seattle workshop

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.859 
participating in the Seattle workshop
which<00:01:40.549> happens<00:01:40.970> to<00:01:41.060> be<00:01:41.090> where<00:01:41.299> we<00:01:41.509> are<00:01:41.540> right

00:01:41.859 --> 00:01:41.869 
which happens to be where we are right

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:44.020 
which happens to be where we are right
now<00:01:41.930> near<00:01:42.320> Boeing<00:01:42.710> Field<00:01:42.920> I<00:01:43.220> bring<00:01:43.850> this<00:01:43.970> up

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
now near Boeing Field I bring this up

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:45.789 
now near Boeing Field I bring this up
because<00:01:44.240> there<00:01:44.810> is<00:01:44.960> a<00:01:44.990> certain<00:01:45.500> degree<00:01:45.619> of

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:45.799 
because there is a certain degree of

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:47.889 
because there is a certain degree of
airplane<00:01:46.220> activity<00:01:46.759> going<00:01:47.060> on<00:01:47.180> in<00:01:47.420> the

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:47.899 
airplane activity going on in the

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:49.389 
airplane activity going on in the
background<00:01:48.320> so<00:01:48.560> that<00:01:48.590> accounts<00:01:49.100> for<00:01:49.250> the

00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:49.399 
background so that accounts for the

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:51.940 
background so that accounts for the
airplane<00:01:49.789> noise<00:01:50.000> so<00:01:50.539> we've<00:01:50.869> got<00:01:51.049> a<00:01:51.080> flash<00:01:51.590> here
