 There are other people's minds and there are 0 0 

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:19.750
 Oh, just one is not coming from the mirror 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:24.220
 As according to the behavior of others as sokedo our brains and think of others 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:27.940
 There is a special part of emulating the same imitation. 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:31.450
 It's like watching a mirror up to an elevator. 

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:37.030
 Mirror 

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:41.410
 There are many , such as the nose and the situation of the person, and the good thing 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:44.830
 Not only that, but I came out of experiment to believe in the enemy . 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:49.750
 It's called the brain that make people see that the same biochemical doedeo 10 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:55.030
 So, this is a phenomenon to some higher animals. 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:58.870
 Well , you humans are good enough to live like this. 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:01.530
 Even though the other going the distance or time and live the truth of these things 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:01.530
 I'm talking. 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:08.860
 hoover but I'll try to interesting experiments 

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:15.150
 It's a chair test. 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:15.150
 In fact, two of them to learn the girl in a yellow suit me test-born 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:22.979
 After a while, the third actor with crutches is sick. 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.979
 There are no empty chairs. 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:31.680
 tei 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:36.299
 co woman concedes chair after worry 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:40.070
 I have problems to be solved in an hour, but give me a little sick while another Moran 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.070
 I got a point for a guy . 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.740
 Of course , there may be some other behavior. 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:56.329
 I chose to focus on the very guy instead of giving up the men's chair . 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:06.270
 woo 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:12.270
 The more people give up the chair because of the 0 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:16.520
 I tasted the rare sensor. It was an account test that I noticed the difference between the two. 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:16.520
 He's got a lot of relationship with religion. 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:25.900
 too 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:27.550
 This experiment is actually coming from the person who the picture I want to try the 310 palms together 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:32.070
 This gave me more compassion 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:32.070
 The result is that the chair yields more words 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:42.640
 Meditation, peace and comfort, 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:48.790
 Since rattling naedorok custom there be approximately in the activation of these that 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:54.610
 You can see that there is more space because it can not be saved. 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:57.000
 But it's strange. If faith is a survival stick, it 's not milk time. 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:57.000
 I will
