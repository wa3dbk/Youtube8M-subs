him<00:01:47.729> because<00:01:48.149> he<00:01:48.420> is<00:01:48.570> not<00:01:48.920> useful<00:01:49.920> pulling<00:01:50.930> in

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
him because he is not useful pulling in

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.560 
him because he is not useful pulling in
this<00:01:52.140> way<00:01:52.350> he<00:01:52.770> always<00:01:53.039> gets<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:53.850> advantage<00:01:54.060> to
