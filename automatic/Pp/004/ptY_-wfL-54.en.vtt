00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:14.570
 today we will talk about the stapling of the 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:17.029
 maples we find ourselves in the spring already 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:20.419
 started now with an advance also 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:24.470
 on the usual season some plants of 

00:00:20.419 --> 00:00:26.329
 we already had to think about maple but 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.849
 today he would be able to show the 

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:32.840
 staple red maple debut in 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:35.090
 particular way we are presented here 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:38.030
 some varieties this I'm pointing to 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:40.640
 it is a Sicilian cina that is lacero cresco 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:44.420
 a very particular truth that it does 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.460
 very short internodes and therefore variety 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.379
 who really like it 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:52.129
 this is a maple of arakawa and varieties 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:54.050
 the only Japanese maple he builds 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:56.739
 slowly over time a bark 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:01:00.739
 stiff similar to that of an oak 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:02.420
 this is a shapely maple na is a maple 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:04.840
 trilobed as you see the leaves are 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:07.490
 different from the other archers they are 

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:09.100
 made to five points like those of a 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.810
 instead these have 3 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.490
 exactly the feature of this 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:17.090
 acer is that of being able to make some 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:19.580
 very important this is the maple 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.950
 red praise spring makes colors 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.830
 beautiful though you must also know that 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.780
 afterwards as it goes on 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:28.280
 season the leaves turn green like 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.550
 all the other archers beauty is 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:34.460
 just that moment before showing 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:37.640
 how to staple it is 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:40.970
 need to make a ragged clarification 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:43.340
 or the acers in general are plants 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.800
 which in spring are very exuberant and 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.200
 therefore they reproduce carry out of the 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:51.230
 of the very long hunts that the 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:53.000
 scholarship holder must know how to contain to make yes 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:53.840
 that it tears remains in its form 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.090
 predetermined 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:01.250
 not only but doing so we also do 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:03.170
 so that from the inner branches are born 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.540
 new gems that will help us 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:08.060
 thicken the vegetation of the plant 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:12.260
 then this kind of intervention that me 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:14.659
 I'm doing this while I 'm talking about this 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:17.329
 variety is an intervention that must be done 

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:19.069
 indistinctly on all types of maple 

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:21.860
 because the characteristics of the family 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:24.470
 they are always those opposite leaves 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:27.349
 internodes that stretch and therefore the 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:29.780
 the same application technique 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:32.840
 us to keep the shape of the plant 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:36.049
 we must necessarily exclude the 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:38.989
 kicked out of the shape of the 

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:40.970
 bonsai cutting where it is cut off 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:44.480
 first pair of leaves the inter knot is 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:47.299
 this part that goes from here to here then 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:49.370
 these are longer and less ragged 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:51.260
 it will be beautiful the leaflets must be 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.730
 all very close then 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.459
 the operation we do is of 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:57.709
 export this too long part 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:59.209
 and forcing lacere to issue some 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:02.590
 new hunts among the first two 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:05.030
 leaflets can be done with a small scissors 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:07.489
 it can be done simply with 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:09.799
 the manual removal here you see that 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:11.629
 we left only one copy of 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:14.629
 leaves what will happen now 

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:17.569
 it will happen that this central part does not 

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:19.940
 having more leaves that draw sap cissÃ¨ 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:23.060
 that was and to the armpits of these two 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:25.730
 leaves will be born two buds in this 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:28.220
 prst in this direction in which 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:30.739
 they will put new facades there too 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:33.230
 when we arrive at three pairs of 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:36.079
 leaves we will necessarily remove the 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:38.239
 first 2 leaving the last pair between 

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:41.000
 them here we have another case then 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:44.090
 you see that here we have the first pair 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.340
 of leaflets is at the center of the 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:50.150
 leaflets there is the new hunt for the 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:54.079
 second pair if I intervene here and 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:56.269
 I remove the central bud with my fingernail 

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:59.120
 I did the most correct operation 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:04:01.250
 possible and from the inside will grow a 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.560
 other inter knot than if i pincer them 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:06.260
 correctly as of will give me a shape 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:08.090
 in the most compact plant well 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:10.069
 the stapling operation on this one 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:12.590
 plant is finished this does not mean 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:14.109
 that the work is exhausted because if 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:16.430
 let's look at the plant the next day 

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:19.010
 we will find new hunts that 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:21.200
 plant will also have issued during the day 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:21.570
 today and tomorrow morning if not 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.670
 working 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:26.100
 we live and therefore tomorrow we will think about the 

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:29.070
 new shoots that will be retained 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:31.340
 excessively long and so on for 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:35.520
 all the vegetative season 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:37.620
 finished the first wave of hunting the 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.990
 plant will have a period of stasis and then of it 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:42.420
 will put less new less obvious ones 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:44.280
 strong but there will be a second expulsion a 

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:47.180
 that point we will operate as we have 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.180
 operated for the first
