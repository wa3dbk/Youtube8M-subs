00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:12.300
 very good to all people how are you 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.920
 I am anonymous and I bring a new video 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.410
 more for my channel this time we are in a 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.970
 call of duty advanced warfare voucher people 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.170
 we are in a private party not 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.270
 We are in public games if 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.560
 ask because good people like yourself 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.359
 live in the title as you have been able 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.710
 see also in the thumbnail of the video if 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.590
 is that he has given me time to put some 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.170
 is that this video is the challenge of golf 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.450
 channel alpha 097 you know who is the 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.190
 Alpha men promoted more than six 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.170
 months so many of you from 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.489
 polis instructors from your channel and the 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.050
 truth is that I 'm always grateful 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.820
 why not and that's why I tried to do 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.500
 this challenge but I want to tell you that 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.320
 employ you think it's impossible to overcome 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.629
 the 135 casualties as he asks the future 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.100
 always if you are looking at the 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.600
 sound action and nariÃ±o when I breathe 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.010
 but I do not know why I'm 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.390
 breathing harder was usual not what 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.600
 I understand but good but 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.129
 to part what he was saying is a 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.660
 very difficult challenge for players of 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.309
 play 3 because we can not play 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.470
 against 9 bots ie us at 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.360
 maximum of bots against which we can 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.159
 play at the same time is against 6 and 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.619
 telling us howard against more than 6 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.840
 bots enemies the time and therefore it is 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.240
 much more difficult to reach the 135 casualties 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.190
 so much that it is so difficult that it is 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.110
 impossible it is really impossible what 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.909
 you are watching is a game of 105 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.409
 low to two deaths is worth the truth is 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.930
 which is a pretty good game with 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.190
 laden pump included and I was using 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.140
 for the alpha challenge 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:30.060
 some gusts very different from 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.550
 those who use their video in use for 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.830
 the turret used the paladin and bear 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:37.890
 salazar the writing and the by the wow by 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:40.020
 the bomber although the truth is that the 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.850
 wow is quite important because 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.220
 taking you out in google after chains 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.080
 all the other streaks and therefore 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.580
 all more people lower 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.830
 I think it's the famous and used was 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.929
 driving to harrows will surely be 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.759
 I would have taken the patient subject more 

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:55.590
 vacancies and has brought us out above all more 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.270
 low still does not know that meat is 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.700
 the truth is that it's a pretty challenge 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.439
 good teacher 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.329
 entertaining to do if you want it 

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:04.670
 you try to try it if you are from 

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:07.759
 play 4 so if you use this race overcome 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.590
 easy style 35 cows because the votes 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:11.569
 they have a record it's pretty easy to beat them 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.160
 and the truth is that I think it 's a 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:15.410
 quite easy challenge for users of 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.110
 clicks on 4 and xbox one the new ones 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:20.480
 generation since they can play against 9 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.950
 bots and that the truth is that it gives you 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.900
 a lot more glasses than if you're 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.670
 playing alone against 6 the truth is that 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.799
 I was playing a few games 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:31.549
 ok before I got this one and it made me 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:33.410
 games from 93 to 0 99 to 0 game of 102 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:35.810
 to 3 games of many casualties but 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.220
 more than 57 casualties I think I do not 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.200
 I got to do no game I've 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.459
 made some pieces like that and the truth is that 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.230
 is the one that convinced him the most because 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:44.630
 Apart from taking out more than 100 casualties 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:47.049
 I took the gum out of DNA so I think that 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:49.579
 that's why I upload this game and not another one 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:51.739
 the truth is that to tell you that I have not 

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:53.450
 done what I could in projectors not 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:56.930
 we can do more in three that is in 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:59.750
 five minutes more than 100 105 110 casualties 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:02.209
 I think it's quite difficult, I'm worth 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.310
 I think it 's because of difficult stature because 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:05.900
 that reason why we do not sell 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.060
 play against new players but 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.560
 against 6 alone and the truth is that I was 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.020
 playing with the m 11 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:15.830
 in the recovery map as alpha did in 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:17.390
 your challenge and I think that play 3 we can not 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:18.080
 and us for the same reason the 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:19.880
 there was 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:22.190
 this game if it had not been done 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:24.500
 70 low party so split is that ni 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:25.970
 even in play 3 they would be good because 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.380
 I would have raised them but not from 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.030
 of more than 100 casualties in five minutes 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:31.400
 against bots was I think it's 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:32.930
 pretty good to be five minutes is 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.160
 pretty frenetic I think you're going to 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.560
 Enjoy above all by action the same 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:38.090
 of the game and the truth is that to say 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.470
 is that it was good for a little part of 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.180
 this matter 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.740
 I wanted to talk about that I'm a bit messed up 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.100
 ok it went down a little bit messed up this 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:47.110
 video you are probably watching it 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:49.270
 about six thirty in the afternoon what 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:52.120
 safer because I do not have much time 

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:54.010
 I'm going to spend all afternoon reading 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.960
 Completely reading a book is worth today 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:58.600
 on page 123 and has some 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:00.430
 two hundred twenty and milton end crisis 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.780
 and make a single one about her so today 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:03.520
 they will be reading everything in the afternoon with 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:05.560
 assured so you already know that afternoon light 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:07.120
 for me, sure you are a person 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.320
 it's a lot more entertaining 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.120
 you can leave it with comments has 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:11.920
 poured that the tablet deteriorates os 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.540
 you have to go to soccer or do training 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.190
 or doing homework or anything 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:17.110
 locate the comments already 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:18.660
 perfectly media read I 'm worth 

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:20.770
 you also decide on sweet times 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:23.230
 some comments that you stop today 

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:24.640
 this day you do not answer comments like this 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:26.140
 there are many comments and no context 

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:27.850
 just answer those that I think that 

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:29.410
 they have relevance for comments 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:30.700
 for example with the like crack because 4 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:32.950
 he answered with a smiling face but 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:34.480
 nothing more and not always not but always 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:36.340
 there is a comment so what to do is 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:37.780
 a question if they were not questions and 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:39.970
 answers evidently by itself that no 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:41.770
 just answer read our read everything 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:43.450
 that is to put them is something else because 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:45.400
 the truth is that at the beginning when the 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:47.800
 video replaces an agreement against all 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:49.710
 but it will be quite easy to respond to 

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:52.710
 all and the pretty 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:54.390
 but it was not so much work to say nothing 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:55.830
 So much work and answering one by one 

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:57.390
 because I commented in twenty thirty 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:59.850
 people to get where where 

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:03.120
 the same in a video they tell me 80 to 100 

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:03.900
 150 people such as streaming 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.340
 that arrives 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.900
 I have all of them streaming more than 2,000 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:09.180
 comments and obviously I can not 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:10.470
 answer them all answers those that 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:11.880
 I believe that more advances him tina the 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:13.410
 study I think that may result the 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:15.000
 useful for everyone always had a 

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:17.250
 question can illustrate useful programs 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.660
 from other people and good people is from 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:20.790
 the dangers in the video that the games 

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:23.220
 Surely you have another video if it's not going 

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:27.110
 well if I have time on everything and up 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:27.110
 the next kids goodbye
