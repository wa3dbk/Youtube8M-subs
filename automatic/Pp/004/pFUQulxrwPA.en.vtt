00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270 
wondering again you know iron ingots are

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.429 
wondering again you know iron ingots are
probably<00:02:00.270> very<00:02:00.360> useful<00:02:00.990> you<00:02:01.140> don't<00:02:01.259> want<00:02:01.380> to

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
probably very useful you don't want to

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.469 
probably very useful you don't want to
waste<00:02:01.560> them<00:02:01.770> all<00:02:01.950> so<00:02:02.640> yeah<00:02:03.090> you<00:02:03.149> can<00:02:03.360> use

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
waste them all so yeah you can use

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.120 
waste them all so yeah you can use
obsidian<00:02:04.229> and<00:02:04.380> you<00:02:04.649> might<00:02:04.770> be<00:02:04.799> wondering

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
obsidian and you might be wondering

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.800 
obsidian and you might be wondering
where<00:02:05.549> in<00:02:05.729> the<00:02:05.820> world<00:02:05.939> do<00:02:06.149> I<00:02:06.180> get<00:02:06.390> up<00:02:06.479> see<00:02:06.630> then

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
where in the world do I get up see then

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.389 
where in the world do I get up see then
well<00:02:07.350> if<00:02:07.469> you<00:02:07.530> have<00:02:07.619> a<00:02:07.649> quarry<00:02:07.950> running<00:02:08.280> in

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
well if you have a quarry running in

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.070 
well if you have a quarry running in
your<00:02:08.580> world<00:02:08.789> you<00:02:09.119> would<00:02:09.330> be<00:02:09.479> getting<00:02:09.810> a<00:02:09.899> lot<00:02:10.050> of

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
your world you would be getting a lot of

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.530 
your world you would be getting a lot of
obsidian<00:02:10.649> so<00:02:10.920> if<00:02:11.400> you<00:02:11.580> have<00:02:11.670> a<00:02:11.700> quarry<00:02:11.970> you

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
have to do is arrange obsidian in this

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.940 
have to do is arrange obsidian in this
manner<00:02:17.220> and<00:02:17.720> I've<00:02:18.720> got<00:02:18.930> four<00:02:19.170> sacks<00:02:19.409> of<00:02:19.560> seed

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
manner and I've got four sacks of seed

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.619 
manner and I've got four sacks of seed
in<00:02:20.069> here<00:02:20.280> let's<00:02:20.459> see<00:02:20.549> how<00:02:20.640> many<00:02:20.790> iron<00:02:21.269> ingots<00:02:21.540> I

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:21.629 
in here let's see how many iron ingots I

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:23.660 
in here let's see how many iron ingots I
can<00:02:21.810> get<00:02:22.019> I've<00:02:22.500> got<00:02:22.739> one<00:02:22.980> stack<00:02:23.280> of<00:02:23.430> iron

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
can get I've got one stack of iron

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.339 
can get I've got one stack of iron
ingots<00:02:23.970> let's<00:02:24.239> arrange<00:02:24.510> that<00:02:24.810> they're<00:02:25.110> like

00:02:25.339 --> 00:02:25.349 
ingots let's arrange that they're like

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:31.039 
ingots let's arrange that they're like
that<00:02:25.769> so<00:02:26.730> I've<00:02:27.060> gotten<00:02:27.599> eight<00:02:29.599> gold<00:02:30.599> ingots

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:31.049 
that so I've gotten eight gold ingots

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:33.080 
that so I've gotten eight gold ingots
which<00:02:31.260> means<00:02:31.530> i<00:02:31.620> can<00:02:31.799> get<00:02:31.980> 2<00:02:32.250> so<00:02:32.459> 4<00:02:32.670> stack<00:02:32.939> of

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
which means i can get 2 so 4 stack of

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.920 
which means i can get 2 so 4 stack of
obsidian<00:02:33.599> give<00:02:34.200> me<00:02:34.650> two<00:02:35.040> diamonds<00:02:35.900> which<00:02:36.900> is

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
obsidian give me two diamonds which is

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.830 
obsidian give me two diamonds which is
which<00:02:37.620> is<00:02:37.769> a<00:02:37.950> fair<00:02:38.220> trade<00:02:38.700> actually<00:02:39.209> all<00:02:39.689> right

anything but you know you can get
obsidian<00:03:47.280> from<00:03:47.549> quarry<00:03:47.879> but<00:03:48.209> I<00:03:48.269> thought<00:03:48.780> I

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
obsidian from quarry but I thought I

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.240 
obsidian from quarry but I thought I
could<00:03:49.079> make<00:03:49.109> up<00:03:49.409> see<00:03:49.530> them<00:03:49.680> from<00:03:49.769> awkward

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
could make up see them from awkward

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.939 
could make up see them from awkward
apparently<00:03:50.849> I<00:03:51.090> cannot<00:03:51.629> anymore<00:03:52.109> it<00:03:52.530> must<00:03:52.709> have
