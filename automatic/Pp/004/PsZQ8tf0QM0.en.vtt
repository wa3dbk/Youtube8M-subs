00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:06.220
 Y 

00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:09.160
 I can not sleep miss them a lot 

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:10.959
 we also wanted to take the train 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:13.599
 tomorrow after the meeting I will reach 

00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:15.010
 home to dinner poor otan alone 

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:17.920
 that hotel 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:20.500
 if it's very boring but I'll see if 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:23.820
 I find something to read that you admire there 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.820
 a bible on the night table 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.180
 like every normal guy feels it without 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:33.250
 got one of those magazines again 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:36.489
 of bikinis I do not know where you find those 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:42.989
 things he was playing behind the tank 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:42.989
 of the bathroom not because you ask or appointment 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.150
 it will be better 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:54.400
 I thought before going to bed you're 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:56.500
 doing what is not too late so that 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:59.140
 be awake you should already be in the 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:01.120
 bed yes I know but has trouble 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.550
 falling asleep when you're not at home 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.979
 it can appease itself and because it does not read it is 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:08.700
 a story if the sound of my voice can 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:08.700
 I calmed him down 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:13.429
 of water 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.040
 I tell him 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:32.030
 this closes the eyes that you are going to do to me 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:34.300
 you'd better be afraid of what you 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:38.150
 I will do if you fill our eyes 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:42.000
 the child opens you start to feel sleepy not 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:43.770
 good and if I read you something if there is a 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.140
 Miss June's article on that 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.140
 magazine did not have that in mind 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:54.939
 there was once a very small child who 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:58.570
 he lived with his grandpa and his great-grandfather and 

00:01:54.939 --> 00:02:02.220
 his great- great- grandfather and his great tátara tátara 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.220
 it's a little bit with grandpa 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:14.480
 and that book put me to sleep 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:18.360
 there are also swells sleep well 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:20.100
 little heart looks so innocent that it's 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:24.050
 Hard to believe that it is the same one that filled 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.050
 my new bag with a raw hamburger 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.320
 It will be better if I also fall asleep 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:38.200
 ah 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:42.250

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:44.880

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.880

00:02:55.210 --> 00:03:00.270
 This child is driving me crazy 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:08.620
 they ask me what will be dreaming 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:11.440
 my mom can not get into those 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:15.700
 pants so narrow again placate 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:18.930

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:38.819

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.819

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:50.610

 what a fresh breeze comes from the sea 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:41.349
 I can read the smell of the sea 

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:47.350

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:47.350
