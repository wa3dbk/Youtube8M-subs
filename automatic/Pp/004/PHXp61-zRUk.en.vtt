00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.100 

you<00:01:35.980> can<00:01:36.130> see<00:01:36.310> it's<00:01:36.430> made<00:01:36.610> 214<00:01:37.600> kilowatts

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.110 
you can see it's made 214 kilowatts

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.320 
you can see it's made 214 kilowatts
we'll<00:01:38.260> go<00:01:38.410> into<00:01:38.680> the<00:01:38.830> handle<00:01:39.730> I<00:01:39.820> squint<00:01:40.210> and

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:40.330 
we'll go into the handle I squint and

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.850 
we'll go into the handle I squint and
analyze<00:01:40.690> some<00:01:40.930> of<00:01:40.960> the<00:01:41.140> data<00:01:42.180> and<00:01:43.590> if<00:01:44.590> you<00:01:44.710> have

a look at here you have each talk was

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.580 
a look at here you have each talk was
475<00:01:47.950> meters<00:01:48.580> gone<00:01:48.790> up<00:01:48.910> to<00:01:49.000> 536<00:01:49.810> and<00:01:50.080> the
