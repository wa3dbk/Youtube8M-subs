00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
you want to count every pattern 27 so 1

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:42.319 
you want to count every pattern 27 so 1
2<00:00:35.010> 3<00:00:35.370> 4<00:00:35.579> 5<00:00:36.480> 6<00:00:36.809> 7<00:00:37.200> 1<00:00:37.829> 2<00:00:38.520> 3<00:00:39.030> 4<00:00:39.690> 5<00:00:40.290> 6<00:00:40.620> 7<00:00:41.059> and<00:00:42.059> you<00:00:42.090> want

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
2 3 4 5 6 7 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 and you want

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.380 
2 3 4 5 6 7 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 and you want
to<00:00:42.390> do<00:00:42.510> each<00:00:42.780> pattern<00:00:43.140> twice<00:00:43.590> and<00:00:44.340> then<00:00:45.149> the

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
to do each pattern twice and then the

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:52.010 
to do each pattern twice and then the
second<00:00:45.809> pattern<00:00:46.200> is<00:00:46.460> 1<00:00:47.460> 2<00:00:47.879> 3<00:00:47.910> 4<00:00:48.420> 5<00:00:49.230> 6<00:00:49.620> 7<00:00:49.920> 1<00:00:50.460> 2<00:00:51.090> 3<00:00:51.510> 4

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
second pattern is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 1 2 3 4

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:58.099 
second pattern is 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 1 2 3 4
5<00:00:52.860> 6<00:00:52.890> 7<00:00:53.730> and<00:00:55.850> see<00:00:56.850> it<00:00:57.149> was<00:00:57.300> like<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.600> same<00:00:57.809> thing

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
5 6 7 and see it was like the same thing

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.130 
5 6 7 and see it was like the same thing
but<00:00:58.440> just<00:00:58.710> you<00:00:59.100> added<00:00:59.489> clapping<00:00:59.969> so<00:01:00.840> now<00:01:00.989> we're

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
but just you added clapping so now we're

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:09.080 
but just you added clapping so now we're
adding<00:01:01.289> snapping<00:01:02.129> 1<00:01:02.879> 2<00:01:03.329> 3<00:01:03.500> 4<00:01:04.500> 5<00:01:04.949> 6<00:01:04.979> 7<00:01:05.939> 1<00:01:06.360> 2<00:01:07.260> 3<00:01:07.890> 4<00:01:08.610> 5

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
adding snapping 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 1 2 3 4 5

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.310 
adding snapping 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 1 2 3 4 5
6<00:01:09.119> 7<00:01:09.930> and<00:01:10.670> every<00:01:11.670> pattern<00:01:11.939> you<00:01:12.240> do<00:01:12.450> you<00:01:13.049> want<00:01:13.229> to

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
6 7 and every pattern you do you want to

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.730 
6 7 and every pattern you do you want to
go<00:01:13.470> you<00:01:13.770> want<00:01:14.729> to<00:01:15.000> hit<00:01:15.210> it<00:01:15.270> first<00:01:15.930> because<00:01:16.590> if

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
go you want to hit it first because if

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.140 
go you want to hit it first because if
you're<00:01:16.890> starting<00:01:17.159> with<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.549> snap<00:01:17.820> you<00:01:17.970> don't

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
you're starting with the snap you don't

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.469 
you're starting with the snap you don't
want<00:01:18.299> to<00:01:18.360> do<00:01:18.479> one<00:01:19.320> two<00:01:19.740> three<00:01:20.040> four<00:01:20.280> five<00:01:21.090> six

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
want to do one two three four five six

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.950 
want to do one two three four five six
seven<00:01:21.869> then<00:01:22.860> it<00:01:23.040> doesn't<00:01:23.280> end<00:01:23.670> you<00:01:24.420> started

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
seven then it doesn't end you started

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:31.899 
seven then it doesn't end you started
well<00:01:25.439> it<00:01:25.979> does<00:01:26.490> but<00:01:26.820> you<00:01:27.570> want<00:01:27.750> to<00:01:27.810> end<00:01:30.409> cutting

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:31.909 
well it does but you want to end cutting

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:38.300 
well it does but you want to end cutting
so<00:01:32.909> then<00:01:33.590> the<00:01:34.590> fourth<00:01:35.280> is<00:01:35.900> kind<00:01:36.900> of<00:01:37.049> hard<00:01:37.310> and

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
so then the fourth is kind of hard and

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:48.289 
so then the fourth is kind of hard and
it<00:01:38.460> goes<00:01:38.640> 1<00:01:39.180> 2<00:01:39.500> 3<00:01:41.390> 4<00:01:42.390> 5<00:01:43.380> 6<00:01:43.860> 7<00:01:45.140> and<00:01:46.140> you<00:01:46.310> go

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
it goes 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 and you go

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:56.359 
it goes 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 and you go
switch<00:01:49.200> hit<00:01:50.009> flap<00:01:50.939> snap<00:01:51.720> clap<00:01:52.590> it<00:01:54.380> so<00:01:55.380> let's<00:01:55.590> do

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
switch hit flap snap clap it so let's do

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.959 
switch hit flap snap clap it so let's do
what<00:01:56.610> we<00:01:56.729> have<00:01:56.939> so<00:01:57.149> far<00:01:57.180> I'll<00:01:57.689> go<00:01:57.719> slow<00:01:58.140> 1<00:01:59.040> 2<00:01:59.460> 3<00:01:59.670> 4

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
what we have so far I'll go slow 1 2 3 4

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:09.690 
what we have so far I'll go slow 1 2 3 4

this<00:02:30.700> is<00:02:30.910> this<00:02:31.300> move<00:02:32.580> pretty<00:02:33.580> hard<00:02:34.050> um<00:02:35.050> so<00:02:35.830> you

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
this is this move pretty hard um so you

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.890 
this is this move pretty hard um so you
go<00:02:36.040> one<00:02:36.670> two<00:02:37.950> three<00:02:39.450> like<00:02:40.450> the<00:02:40.599> hoedown

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
go one two three like the hoedown

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:53.430 
go one two three like the hoedown
throwdown<00:02:43.650> so<00:02:44.650> it<00:02:44.799> goes<00:02:45.120> 1<00:02:46.120> 2<00:02:46.470> 3<00:02:48.269> 4<00:02:49.319> 5<00:02:50.319> 6<00:02:51.630> and<00:02:52.630> the

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
throwdown so it goes 1 2 3 4 5 6 and the

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.949 
throwdown so it goes 1 2 3 4 5 6 and the
last<00:02:53.680> two<00:02:53.950> patterns<00:02:54.250> i<00:02:54.549> just<00:02:54.790> showed<00:02:54.970> you<00:02:55.180> they

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
last two patterns i just showed you they

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:59.190 
last two patterns i just showed you they
were<00:02:56.190> dumb<00:02:57.190> you<00:02:57.849> had<00:02:58.090> it<00:02:58.269> you<00:02:58.510> didn't<00:02:58.870> have<00:02:59.019> to

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
were dumb you had it you didn't have to

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.640 
were dumb you had it you didn't have to
do<00:02:59.349> like<00:02:59.829> it<00:03:00.489> was<00:03:00.700> all<00:03:01.000> the<00:03:01.690> pattern<00:03:02.110> injured

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
do like it was all the pattern injured

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:09.800 
do like it was all the pattern injured
seven<00:03:03.540> some<00:03:05.010> seconds<00:03:06.180> so<00:03:07.180> like<00:03:07.959> I<00:03:08.140> didn't<00:03:08.380> do

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
seven some seconds so like I didn't do

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:18.590 
seven some seconds so like I didn't do
