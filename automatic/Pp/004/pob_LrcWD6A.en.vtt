00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
hell is this uploading a video on my

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.350 
hell is this uploading a video on my
cell<00:00:07.379> phones<00:00:07.560> making<00:00:08.040> a<00:00:08.099> video<00:00:08.250> trying<00:00:09.240> to

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
cell phones making a video trying to

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.209 
cell phones making a video trying to
explain<00:00:09.780> why<00:00:10.139> I<00:00:10.170> haven't<00:00:10.349> made<00:00:10.800> a<00:00:10.860> video<00:00:11.010> in

explain why I haven't made a video in
six<00:00:11.670> months<00:00:11.820> and<00:00:12.179> the<00:00:12.240> reason<00:00:12.450> for<00:00:12.480> that<00:00:12.630> is

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
six months and the reason for that is

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.499 
six months and the reason for that is
because<00:00:13.259> i'm<00:00:14.040> lazy<00:00:14.250> as<00:00:14.519> and<00:00:15.240> you're

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
because i'm lazy as and you're

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:16.670 
because i'm lazy as and you're
probably<00:00:15.630> looking<00:00:15.990> my<00:00:16.080> stats<00:00:16.470> and<00:00:16.590> you're

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
probably looking my stats and you're

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.500 
probably looking my stats and you're
like<00:00:16.800> wow<00:00:16.980> in<00:00:17.220> this<00:00:17.400> game<00:00:17.640> since<00:00:18.210> it's<00:00:18.330> been<00:00:18.420> on

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
like wow in this game since it's been on

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.359 
like wow in this game since it's been on
for<00:00:18.539> so<00:00:18.810> long<00:00:18.840> this<00:00:19.170> is<00:00:19.350> terrible<00:00:19.710> but<00:00:20.310> I

actually quit back in March I think two

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.400 
actually quit back in March I think two

months after the game came out or so and

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.349 
months after the game came out or so and
yeah<00:00:26.070> this<00:00:26.189> is<00:00:26.250> all<00:00:26.430> like<00:00:26.550> really<00:00:26.939> got<00:00:27.119> to<00:00:27.330> I

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
yeah this is all like really got to I

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:28.880 
yeah this is all like really got to I
just<00:00:27.750> ended<00:00:27.960> up<00:00:28.080> slaying<00:00:28.470> way<00:00:28.650> too<00:00:28.710> many

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
just ended up slaying way too many

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.429 
just ended up slaying way too many
dragons<00:00:29.400> and<00:00:29.730> I<00:00:30.179> never<00:00:30.359> really<00:00:30.599> did<00:00:30.720> Slayer<00:00:31.019> if

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
dragons and I never really did Slayer if

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:32.749 
dragons and I never really did Slayer if
I<00:00:31.619> had<00:00:31.710> started<00:00:31.890> out<00:00:32.070> doing<00:00:32.219> Slayer<00:00:32.550> I

i might make videos up in the future

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.790 
i might make videos up in the future
depending<00:02:10.950> on<00:02:11.040> the<00:02:11.100> reaction<00:02:11.460> to<00:02:11.550> the<00:02:11.670> stream

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
depending on the reaction to the stream

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.950 
depending on the reaction to the stream
i'm<00:02:13.800> not<00:02:13.980> i'm<00:02:14.310> not<00:02:14.370> a<00:02:14.910> professional<00:02:15.120> player<00:02:15.720> at

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
i'm not i'm not a professional player at

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:19.520 
i'm not i'm not a professional player at
the<00:02:15.990> game<00:02:16.230> or<00:02:16.380> anything<00:02:16.650> I'm<00:02:16.830> just<00:02:18.200> although<00:02:19.200> I

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
the game or anything I'm just although I

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.710 
the game or anything I'm just although I
think<00:02:19.800> that<00:02:20.130> it<00:02:21.060> would<00:02:21.150> be<00:02:21.330> pretty

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
think that it would be pretty

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:22.850 
think that it would be pretty
interesting<00:02:22.170> to<00:02:22.260> stream<00:02:22.470> and<00:02:22.650> see<00:02:22.740> what

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
interesting to stream and see what

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.920 
interesting to stream and see what
happen<00:02:23.100> but<00:02:23.330> this<00:02:24.330> is<00:02:24.450> probably<00:02:24.660> the<00:02:24.780> last

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
happen but this is probably the last

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.070 
happen but this is probably the last
