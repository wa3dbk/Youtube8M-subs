00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.900 
we decided that we wanted to open a
restaurant<00:00:29.760> that<00:00:30.560> was<00:00:32.030> southern<00:00:33.030> and<00:00:34.820> told<00:00:35.820> a

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
restaurant that was southern and told a

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.330 
restaurant that was southern and told a
story<00:00:36.180> of<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.510> south<00:00:36.750> we<00:00:37.590> decided<00:00:38.040> that<00:00:38.070> in

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
story of the south we decided that in

story of the south we decided that in
order<00:00:38.640> to<00:00:39.379> move<00:00:40.379> forward<00:00:40.890> we<00:00:41.040> really<00:00:41.250> needed

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
order to move forward we really needed

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.819 
order to move forward we really needed
to<00:00:41.670> define<00:00:42.000> what<00:00:42.690> is<00:00:42.840> Southern<00:00:43.170> cuisine<00:00:43.379> or

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
to define what is Southern cuisine or

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.830 
to define what is Southern cuisine or
what<00:00:43.950> is<00:00:44.070> cuisine<00:00:44.520> period<00:00:45.480> what<00:00:45.600> does<00:00:45.690> that

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
what is cuisine period what does that

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.660 
what is cuisine period what does that
word<00:00:46.020> mean<00:00:46.050> and<00:00:46.410> how<00:00:46.500> does<00:00:46.649> it<00:00:46.770> come<00:00:46.860> about<00:00:46.980> the

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
word mean and how does it come about the

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.160 
word mean and how does it come about the
cuisine<00:00:47.910> certainly<00:00:48.539> just<00:00:48.750> doesn't<00:00:49.020> fall<00:00:49.110> out

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
cuisine certainly just doesn't fall out

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.520 
cuisine certainly just doesn't fall out
of<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:49.469> sky<00:00:49.760> and<00:00:50.760> so<00:00:51.030> we<00:00:51.660> decided<00:00:51.989> that<00:00:52.140> the

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
of the sky and so we decided that the

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.610 
of the sky and so we decided that the
word<00:00:52.680> cuisine<00:00:53.160> was<00:00:53.610> based<00:00:53.850> on<00:00:54.000> two<00:00:54.239> things<00:00:54.620> one

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
word cuisine was based on two things one

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.569 
word cuisine was based on two things one
the<00:00:56.370> cultural<00:00:56.730> influences<00:00:57.270> and<00:00:57.539> two<00:00:58.579> the

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
the cultural influences and two the

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.279 
the cultural influences and two the
ingredients<00:01:00.270> that<00:01:00.420> are<00:01:00.629> available<00:01:01.170> at

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
ingredients that are available at

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.500 
ingredients that are available at
arms-length<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:02.219> ingredients<00:01:02.760> that<00:01:02.940> thrive

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
arms-length the ingredients that thrive

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.109 
arms-length the ingredients that thrive
within<00:01:04.290> a<00:01:04.439> specific<00:01:04.920> area<00:01:05.189> based<00:01:05.880> on<00:01:06.030> the

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
within a specific area based on the

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.649 
within a specific area based on the
geography<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.960> climate<00:01:07.409> and<00:01:08.270> once<00:01:09.270> you<00:01:09.450> sort

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
geography the climate and once you sort

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.480 
geography the climate and once you sort
of<00:01:09.750> understand<00:01:10.229> that<00:01:10.320> then<00:01:10.979> you<00:01:11.100> can<00:01:11.250> break

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
of understand that then you can break

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.429 
of understand that then you can break
apart<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:12.000> different<00:01:12.510> little<00:01:12.720> micro<00:01:13.049> regions

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
apart the different little micro regions

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:14.480 
apart the different little micro regions
all<00:01:13.590> throughout<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:13.979> south

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
all throughout the south

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.730 
all throughout the south
