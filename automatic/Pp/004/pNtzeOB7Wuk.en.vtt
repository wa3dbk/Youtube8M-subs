justice<00:00:01.800> a<00:00:03.529> tick<00:00:04.529> over

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:10.890 

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:13.040 

see<00:00:11.490> them<00:00:11.640> back<00:00:11.790> in<00:00:12.000> the<00:00:12.090> front<00:00:12.330> wheels<00:00:12.540> are<00:00:12.870> up

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:13.050 
see them back in the front wheels are up

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:18.410 
see them back in the front wheels are up
down<00:00:14.780> a<00:00:16.370> little<00:00:17.370> bit<00:00:17.550> of<00:00:17.700> wheel<00:00:17.820> snip<00:00:18.180> at<00:00:18.330> the

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
down a little bit of wheel snip at the

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.600 
down a little bit of wheel snip at the
front<00:00:18.660> there<00:00:18.810> so<00:00:19.110> initially<00:00:19.950> look<00:00:20.160> at<00:00:20.340> stick

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:20.610 
front there so initially look at stick

front there so initially look at stick
over<00:00:20.940> he's<00:00:21.300> not<00:00:21.330> going<00:00:21.480> feet<00:00:21.900> on<00:00:22.080> anything<00:00:22.320> you

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:22.860 
over he's not going feet on anything you

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:24.560 
over he's not going feet on anything you
can<00:00:23.010> see<00:00:23.160> it's<00:00:23.279> just<00:00:23.340> turning<00:00:23.970> the<00:00:24.090> front<00:00:24.390> and

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
can see it's just turning the front and

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.750 
can see it's just turning the front and
the<00:00:24.720> rear<00:00:24.750> wheel<00:00:25.290> on<00:00:25.500> opposite<00:00:25.890> corners<00:00:26.070> and

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
the rear wheel on opposite corners and

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.310 
the rear wheel on opposite corners and
all<00:00:26.939> they'll<00:00:27.150> need<00:00:27.330> to<00:00:27.360> do<00:00:27.660> is<00:00:27.930> just<00:00:28.169> the

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
all they'll need to do is just the

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.920 
all they'll need to do is just the
tiniest<00:00:28.710> of<00:00:29.250> touches<00:00:29.759> on<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.119> throttle<00:00:30.329> and

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:30.930 
tiniest of touches on the throttle and

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:32.600 
tiniest of touches on the throttle and
that<00:00:31.110> is<00:00:31.230> enough<00:00:31.560> to<00:00:31.800> give<00:00:31.950> the<00:00:32.070> car<00:00:32.340> the

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
that is enough to give the car the

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.819 
that is enough to give the car the
signal<00:00:33.060> that<00:00:33.600> we<00:00:33.780> don't<00:00:33.930> like<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.350> wheel<00:00:34.500> spin

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
signal that we don't like the wheel spin

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.470 
signal that we don't like the wheel spin
we<00:00:35.040> want<00:00:35.220> to<00:00:35.400> move<00:00:35.550> forward<00:00:35.610> and<00:00:36.180> you'll<00:00:36.300> see

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
we want to move forward and you'll see

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.600 
we want to move forward and you'll see
the<00:00:36.600> moment<00:00:36.750> he<00:00:36.960> does<00:00:37.170> it<00:00:37.380> you<00:00:37.980> know<00:00:38.070> get<00:00:38.340> it

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
the moment he does it you know get it

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.700 
the moment he does it you know get it
will<00:00:38.700> get<00:00:38.850> virtually<00:00:39.690> instantly<00:00:40.230> it'll<00:00:40.680> just

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
will get virtually instantly it'll just

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.080 
will get virtually instantly it'll just
roll<00:00:41.100> off<00:00:41.310> so<00:00:41.460> you<00:00:41.520> can<00:00:41.610> see<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:41.850> brakes

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
roll off so you can see the brakes

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.790 
roll off so you can see the brakes
coming<00:00:42.360> on<00:00:42.510> on<00:00:42.630> the<00:00:42.720> front<00:00:42.930> wheel<00:00:43.109> there<00:00:43.739> you

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
coming on on the front wheel there you

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.110 
coming on on the front wheel there you
go<00:00:43.949> pennies<00:00:44.250> off<00:00:46.280> and<00:00:47.280> that<00:00:47.430> that's<00:00:47.640> it<00:00:47.879> I<00:00:47.910> mean

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
go pennies off and that that's it I mean

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.360 
go pennies off and that that's it I mean
no<00:00:48.270> no<00:00:48.600> discernible<00:00:49.199> revving<00:00:49.620> it's<00:00:49.859> just<00:00:50.129> just

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
no no discernible revving it's just just

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.279 
no no discernible revving it's just just
just<00:00:50.670> tickling<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.359> throttles<00:00:51.780> just<00:00:52.019> enough

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
just tickling the throttles just enough

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.380 
just tickling the throttles just enough
to<00:00:52.440> remind<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.859> car<00:00:53.100> but<00:00:53.640> yet<00:00:53.879> you<00:00:53.910> need<00:00:54.210> to

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
to remind the car but yet you need to

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.250 
to remind the car but yet you need to
help<00:00:55.699> and<00:00:56.699> if<00:00:56.820> one<00:00:57.059> is<00:00:57.300> through<00:00:57.570> quite<00:00:57.899> happily

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
help and if one is through quite happily

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:22.399 
help and if one is through quite happily
oh<00:01:00.019> yeah

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:28.410 

hope<00:01:23.409> you<00:01:23.530> don't<00:01:23.650> mind<00:01:23.770> an<00:01:24.070> audience<00:01:27.420> it's

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420 
hope you don't mind an audience it's

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:37.590 
hope you don't mind an audience it's
been<00:01:28.600> beautifully<00:01:29.260> driven<00:01:29.590> so<00:01:29.800> far<00:01:36.330> down<00:01:37.330> it

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
been beautifully driven so far down it

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.980 
been beautifully driven so far down it
go<00:01:39.119> bright<00:01:40.119> lights<00:01:40.150> come<00:01:40.570> on<00:01:40.659> because<00:01:40.810> the

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:40.990 
go bright lights come on because the

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:42.740 
go bright lights come on because the
hill<00:01:41.110> descent<00:01:41.320> control<00:01:41.440> comes<00:01:41.950> on<00:01:42.100> oh<00:01:42.220> right

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
hill descent control comes on oh right

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.660 
hill descent control comes on oh right
if<00:01:43.750> the<00:01:43.869> cars<00:01:44.080> applying<00:01:44.409> the<00:01:44.560> brakes<00:01:44.649> then<00:01:45.070> it

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:45.670 
if the cars applying the brakes then it

00:01:45.670 --> 00:02:10.170 
if the cars applying the brakes then it
puts<00:01:45.909> the<00:01:45.970> right<00:01:46.180> lights<00:01:46.360> on

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:10.180 

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:13.539 

so<00:02:11.180> the<00:02:11.299> next<00:02:11.450> bit<00:02:11.719> is<00:02:11.930> two<00:02:12.650> obstacles<00:02:12.950> in<00:02:13.370> one

00:02:13.539 --> 00:02:13.549 
so the next bit is two obstacles in one

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:15.940 
so the next bit is two obstacles in one
it's<00:02:13.760> going<00:02:13.939> into<00:02:14.299> a<00:02:14.329> side<00:02:14.599> slope<00:02:14.959> yes<00:02:15.500> but<00:02:15.829> as

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
it's going into a side slope yes but as

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.069 
it's going into a side slope yes but as
to<00:02:16.129> go<00:02:16.280> into<00:02:16.459> the<00:02:16.730> side<00:02:16.909> slope<00:02:17.150> you

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:18.079 
to go into the side slope you

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:20.080 
to go into the side slope you
effectively<00:02:18.560> get<00:02:18.829> that<00:02:19.010> same<00:02:19.280> scenario<00:02:19.819> again

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
effectively get that same scenario again

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:21.880 
effectively get that same scenario again
you<00:02:20.299> get<00:02:20.450> that<00:02:20.540> cross<00:02:20.840> axle<00:02:21.230> situations

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
you get that cross axle situations

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.800 
you get that cross axle situations
you'll<00:02:22.159> see<00:02:22.400> as<00:02:22.519> he<00:02:22.640> goes<00:02:22.670> in<00:02:23.090> now<00:02:23.359> the<00:02:23.420> front

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
you'll see as he goes in now the front

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.440 
you'll see as he goes in now the front
wheel<00:02:24.019> starts<00:02:24.469> to<00:02:24.560> droop<00:02:24.829> in<00:02:25.069> the<00:02:25.909> sort<00:02:26.420> of

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
wheel starts to droop in the sort of

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.449 
wheel starts to droop in the sort of
front<00:02:26.720> last<00:02:26.900> the<00:02:27.230> others<00:02:27.650> are<00:02:27.829> still<00:02:28.040> still<00:02:28.340> up

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:28.459 
front last the others are still still up

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:31.810 
front last the others are still still up
high<00:02:28.640> and<00:02:28.970> the<00:02:29.120> rear<00:02:29.510> right
