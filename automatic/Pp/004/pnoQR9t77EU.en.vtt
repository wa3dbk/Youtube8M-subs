 very good goals coaches and 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.530
 level of goalkeepers 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:01:00.539

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:02.280
 among the things you do well that you try 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.120
 to do it well that you want 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.120
 as well 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:14.600
 I learn, above all, a lot of technique 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:17.650
 with coaches who have been when 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.650
 all his life to soccer 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:25.450
 I learned a lot of technicians that there are not 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:27.310
 there's a lot there but here is there being 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.850
 world champions there's a lot that 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:29.850
 to take advantage of 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.310
 Well man, I really like the 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.350
 interceptions and also the world against 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.510
 one because that I'm not very good at 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.710
 however the one against him 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:43.230
 we go up practicing it 's a long time 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:46.050
 bartual contest hurt and with all the 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:49.070
 monitors well we go well so much and good 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.070
 Well that's what I liked the most 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:54.290
 I take a very pleasant experience of 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.090
 true that he had not had the 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:58.730
 opportunity to have worked with 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:03.140
 guys I respect the responsibility the 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:04.580
 discipline that I think this is about 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.680
 to have a lot of discipline and 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:11.290
 responsibility is a position that is 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.290
 you need a lot of responsibility 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.590
 simply the best I think that this is 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.720
 the mecca of the doormen if someone 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.629
 wants to learn practical technique 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:37.769
