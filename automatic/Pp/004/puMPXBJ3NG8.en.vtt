00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
because i was recently looking at my log

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.740 
because i was recently looking at my log
of<00:00:12.540> my<00:00:12.630> Nintendo<00:00:13.049> 3ds<00:00:13.290> and<00:00:13.860> it<00:00:14.519> is<00:00:14.700> the<00:00:15.509> most

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
of my Nintendo 3ds and it is the most

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.429 
of my Nintendo 3ds and it is the most
played<00:00:16.260> game<00:00:16.670> right<00:00:17.670> now<00:00:17.699> on<00:00:18.029> my<00:00:18.180> system<00:00:18.600> so<00:00:19.410> I

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
played game right now on my system so I

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:20.929 
played game right now on my system so I
thought<00:00:19.710> that<00:00:19.949> if<00:00:20.070> I<00:00:20.189> have<00:00:20.279> invested<00:00:20.789> this

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
thought that if I have invested this

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.939 
thought that if I have invested this
much<00:00:21.119> time<00:00:21.390> into<00:00:21.660> it<00:00:21.840> I<00:00:22.109> must<00:00:22.560> have<00:00:22.650> really

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
much time into it I must have really

much time into it I must have really
enjoyed<00:00:23.130> it<00:00:23.369> or<00:00:23.730> I<00:00:23.970> could<00:00:24.420> at<00:00:24.510> least<00:00:24.630> describe

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:08.670 
american version didn't have that so i

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:12.380 
american version didn't have that so i
thought<00:06:08.850> i<00:06:08.910> would<00:06:09.000> point<00:06:09.300> that<00:06:09.390> out<00:06:10.220> but<00:06:11.390> short

of that antenna did a really good job it
is<00:06:14.640> what<00:06:14.820> it<00:06:14.850> is<00:06:14.970> it's<00:06:15.330> not<00:06:15.450> going<00:06:15.600> to<00:06:15.690> be<00:06:15.780> much

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:15.960 
is what it is it's not going to be much

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:18.290 
is what it is it's not going to be much
more<00:06:16.020> than<00:06:16.440> a<00:06:16.470> pet<00:06:16.680> simulator<00:06:17.130> it<00:06:17.880> does<00:06:18.090> have

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:18.300 
more than a pet simulator it does have

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:20.270 
more than a pet simulator it does have
its<00:06:18.450> place<00:06:18.630> I<00:06:19.020> know<00:06:19.500> there<00:06:19.770> were<00:06:19.830> people<00:06:20.160> that

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:20.280 
its place I know there were people that

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:21.770 
its place I know there were people that
very<00:06:20.550> much<00:06:20.790> enjoy<00:06:21.090> these<00:06:21.210> games<00:06:21.480> they<00:06:21.660> can

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:21.780 
very much enjoy these games they can

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:23.180 
very much enjoy these games they can
play<00:06:21.930> them<00:06:22.080> for<00:06:22.230> hours<00:06:22.530> and<00:06:22.650> hours<00:06:22.740> and<00:06:23.040> hours

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:23.190 
play them for hours and hours and hours

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:25.160 
play them for hours and hours and hours
on<00:06:23.490> end<00:06:23.700> and<00:06:23.940> it<00:06:24.180> is<00:06:24.300> a<00:06:24.330> game<00:06:24.540> that<00:06:24.600> doesn't<00:06:24.930> end

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:25.170 
on end and it is a game that doesn't end

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:27.230 
on end and it is a game that doesn't end
so<00:06:25.860> it<00:06:26.010> makes<00:06:26.220> it<00:06:26.370> a<00:06:26.460> little<00:06:26.580> bit<00:06:26.760> difficult<00:06:26.970> to

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:27.240 
so it makes it a little bit difficult to

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:30.800 
so it makes it a little bit difficult to
review<00:06:28.400> if<00:06:29.400> you<00:06:29.640> like<00:06:29.850> pets<00:06:30.240> emulators<00:06:30.780> and
