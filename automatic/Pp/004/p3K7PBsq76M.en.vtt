00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
little lip is pointing forward you slide

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.090 
little lip is pointing forward you slide

hot glue gun and put a little bit glue

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
hot glue gun and put a little bit glue
in<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:44.220> back<00:01:44.400> support<00:01:45.860> each<00:01:46.860> of<00:01:47.009> these<00:01:47.100> little

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
in the back support each of these little

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.520 
in the back support each of these little
holes<00:01:49.460> then<00:01:50.460> you're<00:01:50.580> going<00:01:50.670> to<00:01:50.759> place<00:01:50.910> it

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
holes then you're going to place it

holes then you're going to place it
firmly<00:01:53.509> onto<00:01:55.759> the<00:01:56.759> back<00:01:57.080> of<00:01:58.080> the<00:01:58.770> guide<00:02:00.710> and

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
firmly onto the back of the guide and

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.219 
firmly onto the back of the guide and
that's<00:02:01.770> all<00:02:01.979> glued<00:02:02.190> together

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
that's all glued together

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:06.740 
that's all glued together
we<00:02:04.229> were<00:02:04.320> then<00:02:04.530> going<00:02:04.740> to<00:02:05.039> take<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.509> release

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
we were then going to take the release

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.590 
we were then going to take the release
mechanism<00:02:07.550> place<00:02:08.550> it<00:02:08.789> inside<00:02:09.649> of<00:02:10.649> its<00:02:11.160> holder

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
mechanism place it inside of its holder

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.850 
mechanism place it inside of its holder
and<00:02:12.860> then<00:02:13.860> you're<00:02:13.980> going<00:02:14.130> to<00:02:14.459> put<00:02:14.760> one<00:02:15.860> rubber

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
and then you're going to put one rubber

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.690 
and then you're going to put one rubber
band<00:02:18.560> around<00:02:19.560> it<00:02:19.709> to<00:02:19.860> kind<00:02:20.070> of<00:02:20.130> hold<00:02:20.370> it<00:02:20.489> in

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
band around it to kind of hold it in

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:32.740 
band around it to kind of hold it in
place<00:02:21.800> so

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.479 

you'll<00:02:33.750> see<00:02:33.930> why<00:02:34.049> I<00:02:34.079> do<00:02:34.200> that<00:02:34.409> later<00:02:34.590> so<00:02:35.370> that's

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
you'll see why I do that later so that's

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:39.140 
you'll see why I do that later so that's
basically<00:02:35.909> the<00:02:36.030> pusher<00:02:36.450> to<00:02:36.480> the<00:02:36.689> holder<00:02:38.150> okay

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
basically the pusher to the holder okay

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.569 
basically the pusher to the holder okay
now<00:02:39.510> we<00:02:39.569> have<00:02:39.840> that<00:02:39.989> in<00:02:40.049> place<00:02:40.280> we're<00:02:41.280> going<00:02:41.489> to

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:41.579 
now we have that in place we're going to

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:49.309 
now we have that in place we're going to
glue<00:02:41.730> this<00:02:42.019> to<00:02:43.019> the<00:02:43.200> foundation<00:02:47.060> next<00:02:48.319> we're

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:49.319 
glue this to the foundation next we're

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:51.080 
glue this to the foundation next we're
going<00:02:49.409> to<00:02:49.469> put<00:02:49.650> a<00:02:49.920> little<00:02:50.400> bit<00:02:50.519> of<00:02:50.609> glue<00:02:50.819> on

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
going to put a little bit of glue on

00:02:51.090 --> 00:03:01.190 
going to put a little bit of glue on
each<00:02:52.049> of<00:02:52.379> these<00:02:52.469> bottoms<00:02:57.349> and<00:02:58.349> place<00:02:58.590> them

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:07.780 

like<00:03:02.200> so

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.600 

next<00:03:08.540> we're<00:03:09.470> going<00:03:09.560> to<00:03:09.680> use<00:03:09.769> these<00:03:09.980> wings<00:03:10.280> and

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610 
next we're going to use these wings and

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:14.589 
next we're going to use these wings and
they<00:03:11.360> go<00:03:11.510> together<00:03:11.659> like<00:03:11.900> this<00:03:13.480> and<00:03:14.480> you're

00:03:14.589 --> 00:03:14.599 
they go together like this and you're

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:17.740 
they go together like this and you're
going<00:03:14.720> to<00:03:14.750> place<00:03:14.959> a<00:03:15.290> part<00:03:16.220> that<00:03:16.489> has<00:03:16.750> the

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
going to place a part that has the

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.170 
going to place a part that has the
longer<00:03:18.110> end<00:03:18.290> on<00:03:18.500> it<00:03:18.650> up<00:03:19.400> through<00:03:19.730> this<00:03:19.879> hole

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:20.180 
longer end on it up through this hole

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.410 
longer end on it up through this hole
and<00:03:20.510> you<00:03:21.379> replace<00:03:21.680> this<00:03:21.950> part<00:03:22.220> so<00:03:23.060> that<00:03:23.239> is

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:23.420 
and you replace this part so that is

00:03:23.420 --> 00:04:02.330 
and you replace this part so that is
exactly<00:03:23.599> 180<00:03:24.290> degrees<00:03:24.409> off

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:05.460 

so<00:04:02.849> now<00:04:03.000> you<00:04:03.060> have<00:04:03.300> them<00:04:03.390> set<00:04:03.630> up<00:04:03.660> like<00:04:03.900> so

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:05.470 
so now you have them set up like so

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:15.650 
so now you have them set up like so
next<00:04:08.940> you<00:04:09.940> install<00:04:11.100> our<00:04:12.100> band<00:04:12.600> going<00:04:13.600> from

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
next you install our band going from

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:20.009 
next you install our band going from
this<00:04:16.660> back<00:04:16.900> part<00:04:17.790> right<00:04:18.790> here<00:04:19.030> to<00:04:19.540> this<00:04:19.690> and

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:20.019 
this back part right here to this and

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:21.750 
this back part right here to this and
they're<00:04:20.620> going<00:04:20.799> to<00:04:20.980> install<00:04:21.220> a<00:04:21.280> number<00:04:21.610> of<00:04:21.700> our

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:21.760 
they're going to install a number of our

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.890 
they're going to install a number of our
band<00:04:22.030> from<00:04:22.540> these<00:04:22.720> two<00:04:22.900> holes<00:04:23.080> to<00:04:23.740> this<00:04:23.890> hole

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
band from these two holes to this hole

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.030 
band from these two holes to this hole
when<00:04:25.900> I<00:04:25.930> do<00:04:26.050> the<00:04:26.200> launch<00:04:26.410> of<00:04:26.500> video<00:04:26.740> I'll<00:04:26.860> show

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040 
when I do the launch of video I'll show

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.650 
when I do the launch of video I'll show
you<00:04:27.130> exactly<00:04:27.460> how<00:04:27.640> the<00:04:27.790> rubber<00:04:28.030> bands<00:04:28.300> set<00:04:28.540> up

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:28.660 
you exactly how the rubber bands set up

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:30.750 
you exactly how the rubber bands set up
since<00:04:29.500> there's<00:04:29.830> a<00:04:29.920> couple<00:04:30.190> of<00:04:30.340> ways<00:04:30.490> you<00:04:30.520> can

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:30.760 
since there's a couple of ways you can

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.400 
since there's a couple of ways you can
do<00:04:30.940> it<00:04:30.970> because<00:04:31.390> you<00:04:31.540> want<00:04:31.720> the<00:04:31.840> tension<00:04:32.200> on

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:32.410 
do it because you want the tension on

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:33.780 
do it because you want the tension on
these<00:04:32.710> two<00:04:32.950> to<00:04:33.130> be<00:04:33.250> much<00:04:33.460> higher<00:04:33.730> than

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:33.790 
these two to be much higher than

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:35.760 
these two to be much higher than
attention<00:04:34.390> on<00:04:34.450> these<00:04:34.570> two<00:04:34.810> so<00:04:35.320> that<00:04:35.410> it<00:04:35.530> pulls

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:35.770 
attention on these two so that it pulls

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:38.550 
attention on these two so that it pulls
it<00:04:35.890> back<00:04:35.920> I<00:04:36.430> get<00:04:37.150> to<00:04:37.240> that<00:04:37.360> video<00:04:37.600> you'll<00:04:38.530> see

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
it back I get to that video you'll see

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:41.070 
it back I get to that video you'll see
exactly
