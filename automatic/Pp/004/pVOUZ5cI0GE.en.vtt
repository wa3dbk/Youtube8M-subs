00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.059
 As for the National Assembly accident, what a major nuclear accident happened in Japan in the technological powers of the world 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.570
 People were shocked 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:17.920
 Fukushima nuclear accident remains in the history of the world 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:23.020
 It was a serious accident 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:27.460
 Conduct a thorough investigation because it was an accident that made a big sacrifice 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:36.910
 Even if it does not make use in the future, this is very difficult 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:37.910
 Both TEPCO and the government issued a report on the accident, but TEPCO and the government both operate nuclear power plants 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:41.360
 Accident response 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:49.190
 It was a party of the nuclear accident in the form of 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:57.930
 You can not gain the trust of the people with this, but you are the representative of the people there and have the power to make the law 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:01:02.160
 The National Assembly has a strong power to investigate according to the Constitution and set up an independent investigative committee 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:05.790
 If there is a serious problem except this kind of thing will do well 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:12.930
 But it was the first time in history in Japan 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:17.920
 The 10 well- supported staff were people who had nothing to do with the government or TEPCO 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:21.760
 People who had various opinions about nuclear power were also independent 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:26.680
 From TEPCO and the government in the sense that sex 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:29.620
 From the private sector in terms of investigation authority 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:38.590
 It was a more ideal form 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:44.250
 Kurokawa, who served as the chairman towards this and the world to cherish the people's point of view, which listed the three pillars 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:48.640
 It stated that it originates and those facing the future 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.640
 The hearing over 1167 people 900 hours 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.130
 More than 1000 cases 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:56.800
 10 Requested data 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:02:02.890
 And completed the National Assembly accident report 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:10.200
 As many as 592 pages in the easy-to-understand project Diet Jikocho sides 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:10.200
 I will summarize the important points from this report and explain the outline.
