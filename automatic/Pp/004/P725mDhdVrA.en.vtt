 known on the motherboard all 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:25.400
 video for you because he is 

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:29.599
 showing with a motherboard for the 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:33.289
 subject ok inform formed but also 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:37.039
 for cram schools and work with it the 

00:00:33.289 --> 00:00:41.929
 internet provider that is the motherboard 

00:00:37.039 --> 00:00:43.670
 with a motherboard and also a what is the 

00:00:41.929 --> 00:00:46.390
 store computer with a difference of 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:54.379
 store 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:58.519
 I asked what makes it different from a 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:01:02.179
 from store to store and this one is 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:09.230
 The assembled store is the difference 

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:11.120
 size that is very you all a 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:17.270
 It's just that now I 'm going back to 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:20.660
 Here for the old board explain you partner. 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:24.890
 that only wants and only that soon to whom only 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:26.870
 You want to chase this black man here? 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.780
 that black beer here is the pci 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:35.480
 express black attack that works with 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:38.630
 video card also before you know that the 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:44.780
 gt but it is the most current expression in 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:46.940
 version 2.0 and 3.0 is this wrong me me 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:51.530
 Correct there but no one is there 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:53.120
 guys here that this step here is x1

 know that here O 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:02:11.940
 the high speed entrance the kiss 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:16.010
 these two here only hd 3d apa entries 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:19.970
 sorry , that's where the front panel comes from 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:22.170
 for you see here is the contraction panel comes 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:26.070
 the source pin 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:28.860
 here comes the spirit in front here was 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:31.920
 for 2012 it's but you get younger 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:35.280
 do not come here only is this one O 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:37.770
 the memory stock exists ddr memory 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:41.340
 wave of r 2 and r 30 return with a 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:43.590
 old model is now here is the 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.740
 only the processor is interesting 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:55.020
 there are several only qat is intel and amd that 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:59.100
 I know there's a game here I get to 11 5 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:02.100

 earth maybe people there, you want 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:18.900
 I have a list on the internet with 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:20.790
 several specific socket models 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.670
 is the 2011 which is something with my 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.800
 own hotel 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.540
 this here is a motherboard should be 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:35.670
 mounted you can see that the port bp 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:37.590
 and the sturdy bug and it comes the 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:47.130
 net home here twice here in 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:49.320
 other two usb and jean to mouse and keyboard 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:51.720
 that's what the motherboard to talk 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:53.430
 you have you ever known el this is a 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.840
 video very fast too 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.680
 I also have a little time you have 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:00.030

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.260
 shop with a big difference 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:08.610
 there is only one motherboard of store is 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:10.440
 this here 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:12.450
 it only comes with a memory socket that the 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.160
 another comes from milk comes 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:17.340
 The idea is that she is not in a hurry anymore. 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:20.820
 oldest two apa abnormal in three or 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:23.090
 four is the sun from the spring that is 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.090
 hence 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:29.580
 the processor is one of the main 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:32.160
 greeted on the board itself, translating 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:34.590
 that the processor that the board aok galera 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.700
 that those on board the processor by 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:37.560
 What is a buy advice? 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.250
 store computer because it has that right 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.690
 the reason 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:41.490
 It is worth remembering that it is not all 

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:45.030
 store computers that comes with this 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:47.430

 the two usb and here the usb inputs have 

00:04:53.100 --> 00:05:04.530
 the two ideas without the source pin 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:06.570
 I only have there jack of the memory that she 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:09.180
 It has 23 and only has one 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:13.190
 here is a processor adventure that is 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:15.990
 very little you are seeing here 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:21.680
 here takes place when the battery I took 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:26.430
 the battery here has keyboard and mouse 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:28.290
 serial canteen is also come vg that 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:32.700
 sbt video 

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:33.870
 come rj45 internet it twice and 

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:35.790
 seaweed plate 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:38.670
 this here is a computer motherboard 

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:40.260
 from the shop that is very grumpy now 

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:46.740

 to show who it was that came with 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:56.820
 socket to exchange the case process that 

00:05:54.300 --> 00:06:02.180
 This one does not come here, it has two sockets. 

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:02.180
 here's only one for life and death for death 

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:07.110

 there are also some people who arrive 

00:06:13.919 --> 00:06:17.580
 more than this is the most perfect 

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:21.480
 in which you can see that these 24 

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:23.640
