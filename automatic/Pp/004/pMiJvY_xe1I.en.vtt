00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:06.139
 and well, today I'm going to talk to you about this 

00:00:02.509 --> 00:00:09.980
 the problem of 8 the failure to have 

00:00:06.139 --> 00:00:12.810
 that did not start because of the march 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:15.000
 but it did not start 

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:20.280
 the distributor stage was changed 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:23.010
 cable guides moved him time and 

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:25.950
 I was not told what was to be 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.630
 thermometers 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:31.470
 good for air temperature 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:34.610
 temperature but neither is there a 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.170
 I started sometimes 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:37.829
 the operation of the engine was 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.260
 unstable 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:42.710
 the biggest regulations went up 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.710
 I went down 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:49.180
 and I'm going to say as it was what 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:52.180
 the fault was detected with the scanner 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.920
 seat and the technology seat that 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.160
 has a power failure 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:01:00.260
 tension towards the computer 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.260
 and the failure will be 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:10.510
 the voltage regulator so is not 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:14.380
 made firm contact with those terminals 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:16.440
 it's terminals the originals were very 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:19.800
 loose 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:21.990
 so it did not have a good voltage and 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.090
 made false contacts caused the 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.870
 regulator will heat up until 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.420
 finally throne 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:31.270
 and it did not start it discharged the battery and 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:33.560
 there was dead everything I did was 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.260
 change these terminals 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:39.720
 these 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:39.720
 so that they had a firm contact 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.890
 and with that the entire fault was solved 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:51.360
 they changed this this terminal this is 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.730
 I also did it so they had 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:57.990
 all a firm contact did not have false 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:59.710
 contacts and there would be no more fights that 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.930
 It was all I had 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.840
 but they did not find the baby with two 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:07.210
 months searching among several mechanics and 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.050
 they did not find the fault they removed the 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:12.750
 time I 'm not staying 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:16.500
 and as always there are several mechanics 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:18.440
 that started out the lottery I say 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.990
 why 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:23.480
 they started to guess and get more and more 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:28.560
 things even tell me that it could be 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:32.130
 an age fault with this we have here 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:35.430
 but the simple fault was this and so 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:38.870
 Now the first one has started 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:42.569
 there are failures of any kind 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:46.290
 and this I want to do for 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:49.990
 for those who have a lot of this model 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:54.300
 93 previous to those who still use 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:56.370
 generator have this type of regulator 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.770
 and that they can be presented with a stripe 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.450
 Check your terminals well 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:03.270
 they have to have a firm contact there 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.700
 they have to be loose for nothing 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:08.670
 that the entire electronic system works 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:12.730
 100% and electronic cancer 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:15.099
 any failure then go all 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:19.360
 and it is a recommendation that they do check 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:20.970
 this so that they do not pass what they have 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:25.910
 what to spend 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:25.910
 unnecessary money chicken stop 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:32.210
 I hope your comments some doubt that 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:35.560
 have and can be solved 

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:35.560
 I will try to help them
