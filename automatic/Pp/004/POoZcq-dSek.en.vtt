box

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:17.349 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:20.819 

I<00:02:17.379> think<00:02:18.959> one<00:02:19.959> of<00:02:19.989> the<00:02:20.170> great<00:02:20.379> things<00:02:20.680> about

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:20.829 
I think one of the great things about

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:23.339 
I think one of the great things about
the<00:02:21.099> sticks<00:02:21.400> you<00:02:21.849> know<00:02:22.689> something<00:02:23.079> like<00:02:23.170> this

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:23.349 
the sticks you know something like this

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:28.280 
the sticks you know something like this
one<00:02:23.560> I<00:02:24.489> can<00:02:25.420> get<00:02:25.540> fantastic<00:02:25.799> textures<00:02:27.120> and<00:02:28.120> now

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
one I can get fantastic textures and now

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:35.339 
one I can get fantastic textures and now
with<00:02:29.290> the<00:02:31.379> with<00:02:32.379> these<00:02:32.590> pens<00:02:33.549> I<00:02:34.060> think<00:02:34.719> the<00:02:35.079> joy

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:35.349 
with the with these pens I think the joy

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:37.949 
with the with these pens I think the joy
is<00:02:35.769> being<00:02:35.799> able<00:02:36.129> to<00:02:36.310> be<00:02:37.269> able<00:02:37.359> to<00:02:37.450> write<00:02:37.689> with

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
is being able to be able to write with

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:43.589 
is being able to be able to write with
them<00:02:38.170> and<00:02:38.799> also<00:02:40.230> use<00:02:41.230> a<00:02:41.260> ruler<00:02:42.299> but<00:02:43.299> I've<00:02:43.419> also

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:43.599 
them and also use a ruler but I've also

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:46.979 
them and also use a ruler but I've also
noticed<00:02:43.930> with<00:02:44.290> these<00:02:44.439> pens<00:02:44.799> you<00:02:45.219> can<00:02:45.840> use<00:02:46.840> them

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
noticed with these pens you can use them

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:52.830 
noticed with these pens you can use them
in<00:02:47.079> a<00:02:47.560> flexible<00:02:47.980> way<00:02:48.129> too<00:02:48.450> so<00:02:50.159> you<00:02:51.159> can<00:02:51.840> sponge

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
in a flexible way too so you can sponge

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.830 
in a flexible way too so you can sponge
out<00:02:53.310> some<00:02:54.310> of<00:02:54.430> the<00:02:54.489> color<00:02:54.700> and<00:02:55.389> start<00:02:55.569> creating

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
out some of the color and start creating

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.030 
out some of the color and start creating
texture<00:02:56.439> as<00:02:56.590> well<00:02:56.909> I<00:02:58.709> mean<00:02:59.709> they're<00:02:59.859> an

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
texture as well I mean they're an

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:01.500 
texture as well I mean they're an
incredible<00:03:00.579> shortcut<00:03:01.120> in<00:03:01.269> a<00:03:01.329> way

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
incredible shortcut in a way

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.569 
incredible shortcut in a way

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:21.059 
precision is essential you're going to
be<00:03:11.889> able<00:03:11.949> to<00:03:12.040> create<00:03:12.280> it<00:03:12.459> with<00:03:13.239> these<00:03:13.389> pens

00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:21.069 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:28.199 

so<00:03:21.670> I<00:03:21.700> used<00:03:22.890> one<00:03:23.890> of<00:03:24.040> the<00:03:25.049> pens<00:03:26.049> to<00:03:26.650> write<00:03:27.209> all

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:28.209 
so I used one of the pens to write all

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:31.800 
so I used one of the pens to write all
the<00:03:28.689> lettering<00:03:29.170> and<00:03:29.790> I<00:03:30.790> also<00:03:30.969> used<00:03:31.269> a<00:03:31.390> ruler

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
the lettering and I also used a ruler

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.899 
the lettering and I also used a ruler
with<00:03:32.049> the<00:03:32.799> pen<00:03:33.269> to<00:03:34.269> get<00:03:34.599> these<00:03:34.780> straight<00:03:35.140> lines

00:03:35.899 --> 00:03:35.909 
with the pen to get these straight lines

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:40.380 
with the pen to get these straight lines
nothing<00:03:36.909> smudged<00:03:37.269> and<00:03:37.709> it<00:03:38.709> was<00:03:38.859> really<00:03:39.459> easy

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390 
nothing smudged and it was really easy

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:45.119 
nothing smudged and it was really easy
to<00:03:42.599> draw<00:03:43.599> the<00:03:43.659> rest<00:03:43.930> ring<00:03:44.200> I<00:03:44.439> didn't<00:03:44.829> have<00:03:44.980> to

00:03:45.119 --> 00:03:45.129 
to draw the rest ring I didn't have to

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:48.270 
to draw the rest ring I didn't have to
use<00:03:45.340> a<00:03:45.370> paintbrush<00:03:45.819> and<00:03:46.269> a<00:03:46.629> paintbrush<00:03:47.280> well

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
use a paintbrush and a paintbrush well

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.020 
use a paintbrush and a paintbrush well
it<00:03:48.459> would<00:03:48.579> have<00:03:48.670> taken<00:03:48.909> me<00:03:50.459> days<00:03:51.459> if<00:03:51.909> not

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
it would have taken me days if not

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.059 
it would have taken me days if not
months<00:03:52.420> and<00:03:52.750> I'm<00:03:53.139> not<00:03:53.319> sure<00:03:53.500> actually<00:03:53.920> with

00:03:54.059 --> 00:03:54.069 
months and I'm not sure actually with

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:55.770 
months and I'm not sure actually with
the<00:03:54.159> paintbrush<00:03:54.459> whether<00:03:55.150> I<00:03:55.239> could<00:03:55.629> have

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
the paintbrush whether I could have

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.830 
the paintbrush whether I could have
achieved<00:03:56.470> the<00:03:56.590> same<00:03:56.970> precision<00:03:57.970> I<00:03:58.359> have<00:03:58.810> a

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
achieved the same precision I have a

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.039 
achieved the same precision I have a
feeling<00:03:59.169> I<00:03:59.260> couldn't<00:03:59.590> have<00:03:59.680> done<00:04:00.299> and<00:04:01.299> then<00:04:02.019> I

00:04:02.039 --> 00:04:02.049 
feeling I couldn't have done and then I

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:06.319 
feeling I couldn't have done and then I
had<00:04:02.200> the<00:04:02.290> joy<00:04:02.500> of<00:04:02.739> being<00:04:02.889> able<00:04:03.040> to<00:04:04.260> smudge<00:04:05.260> the

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:06.329 
had the joy of being able to smudge the

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:08.909 
had the joy of being able to smudge the
some<00:04:07.329> of<00:04:07.359> the<00:04:07.480> areas<00:04:07.810> when<00:04:08.230> I<00:04:08.260> wanted<00:04:08.709> to

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:08.919 
some of the areas when I wanted to

00:04:08.919 --> 00:04:11.490 
some of the areas when I wanted to
should<00:04:09.549> create<00:04:10.060> this<00:04:10.209> idea<00:04:10.480> of<00:04:10.689> this<00:04:11.019> this

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500 
should create this idea of this this

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.369 
should create this idea of this this
object<00:04:11.859> being<00:04:11.980> very<00:04:12.220> very<00:04:12.489> old<00:04:12.760> and<00:04:13.209> maybe<00:04:13.989> you

00:04:14.369 --> 00:04:14.379 
object being very very old and maybe you

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:16.830 
object being very very old and maybe you
know<00:04:14.579> put<00:04:15.579> a<00:04:15.609> bit<00:04:15.819> of<00:04:15.879> rain<00:04:16.060> on<00:04:16.090> at<00:04:16.389> some<00:04:16.570> point

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 
know put a bit of rain on at some point

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:23.339 
know put a bit of rain on at some point
or<00:04:17.079> coffeeCup<00:04:17.739> stain<00:04:18.579> or<00:04:18.789> whatever<00:04:21.330> so<00:04:22.349> some

00:04:23.339 --> 00:04:23.349 
or coffeeCup stain or whatever so some

00:04:23.349 --> 00:04:27.529 
or coffeeCup stain or whatever so some
of<00:04:23.380> these<00:04:23.650> are<00:04:25.560> with<00:04:26.560> me<00:04:26.740> using<00:04:26.919> a<00:04:27.190> traditional

00:04:27.529 --> 00:04:27.539 
of these are with me using a traditional

00:04:27.539 --> 00:04:31.589 
of these are with me using a traditional
paint<00:04:28.539> brush<00:04:28.750> and<00:04:29.370> unpainted<00:04:30.370> but<00:04:31.360> I<00:04:31.389> think

00:04:31.589 --> 00:04:31.599 
paint brush and unpainted but I think

00:04:31.599 --> 00:04:34.140 
paint brush and unpainted but I think
it's<00:04:31.750> important<00:04:32.260> to<00:04:32.440> give<00:04:32.620> it<00:04:32.770> this<00:04:33.030> sort<00:04:34.030> of

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.150 
it's important to give it this sort of

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:39.659 
it's important to give it this sort of
atmosphere<00:04:35.110> and<00:04:37.860> then<00:04:38.860> it<00:04:38.949> becomes<00:04:39.250> a<00:04:39.370> work<00:04:39.520> of

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:39.669 
atmosphere and then it becomes a work of

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:42.120 
atmosphere and then it becomes a work of
art<00:04:39.789> rather<00:04:40.090> than<00:04:40.419> just<00:04:40.630> a<00:04:40.780> some<00:04:41.740> sort<00:04:41.979> of

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.130 
art rather than just a some sort of

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:52.610 
art rather than just a some sort of
Xerox<00:04:43.000> copy<00:04:43.360> of<00:04:43.870> the<00:04:44.620> original

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.660 

yesterday<00:04:53.620> I<00:04:53.650> was<00:04:53.800> working<00:04:54.160> on<00:04:54.220> this<00:04:54.370> chess

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:54.670 
yesterday I was working on this chess

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:56.580 
yesterday I was working on this chess
set<00:04:54.700> this<00:04:55.150> was<00:04:55.330> a<00:04:55.510> chess<00:04:55.840> set<00:04:55.870> and<00:04:56.350> I<00:04:56.410> actually

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:56.590 
set this was a chess set and I actually

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:00.660 
set this was a chess set and I actually
used<00:04:57.040> the<00:04:58.230> these<00:04:59.230> sticks<00:04:59.770> for<00:05:00.100> this<00:05:00.250> because

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:00.670 
used the these sticks for this because

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:02.880 
used the these sticks for this because
they<00:05:00.790> give<00:05:00.940> a<00:05:00.970> lovely<00:05:01.210> texture<00:05:01.750> and<00:05:02.110> I<00:05:02.590> wanted

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:02.890 
they give a lovely texture and I wanted

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:06.150 
they give a lovely texture and I wanted
to<00:05:02.950> capture<00:05:03.130> the<00:05:03.370> texture<00:05:03.850> of<00:05:03.910> wood<00:05:04.920> and<00:05:05.920> I<00:05:06.010> was

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:06.160 
to capture the texture of wood and I was

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:10.530 
to capture the texture of wood and I was
able<00:05:06.250> to<00:05:06.460> use<00:05:06.640> to<00:05:07.020> two<00:05:08.020> of<00:05:08.140> the<00:05:08.230> sticks<00:05:09.540> working

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:10.540 
able to use to two of the sticks working

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:15.270 
able to use to two of the sticks working
in<00:05:10.630> a<00:05:10.660> horizontal<00:05:10.900> manner

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:15.280 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:17.540 

I<00:05:15.340> mean<00:05:15.910> it's<00:05:16.180> quite<00:05:16.420> interesting<00:05:17.020> because

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:17.550 
I mean it's quite interesting because

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:20.070 
I mean it's quite interesting because
one<00:05:18.550> of<00:05:18.580> the<00:05:18.700> reasons<00:05:18.970> why<00:05:19.090> I<00:05:19.120> don't<00:05:19.270> take

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:20.080 
one of the reasons why I don't take

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.800 
one of the reasons why I don't take
watercolours<00:05:20.889> out<00:05:21.070> on<00:05:21.310> to<00:05:21.550> hamster<00:05:21.880> teeth<00:05:22.060> is

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:22.810 
watercolours out on to hamster teeth is

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:25.530 
watercolours out on to hamster teeth is
that<00:05:23.020> I<00:05:23.050> can't<00:05:23.320> really<00:05:23.770> cope<00:05:24.160> with<00:05:24.580> with<00:05:25.419> all

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:25.540 
that I can't really cope with with all

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:27.480 
that I can't really cope with with all
the<00:05:25.630> water<00:05:25.810> and<00:05:26.380> the<00:05:26.470> equipment<00:05:27.010> and<00:05:27.310> having

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:27.490 
the water and the equipment and having

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:28.500 
the water and the equipment and having
knows<00:05:27.580> what<00:05:27.760> else<00:05:27.910> because<00:05:28.180> I<00:05:28.240> what<00:05:28.389> I'm

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:28.510 
knows what else because I what I'm

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:29.940 
knows what else because I what I'm
trying<00:05:28.750> to<00:05:28.840> do<00:05:28.930> is<00:05:29.050> capture<00:05:29.290> something<00:05:29.620> quite

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:29.950 
trying to do is capture something quite

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:32.490 
trying to do is capture something quite
quickly<00:05:30.220> I<00:05:30.580> mean<00:05:31.360> I<00:05:31.570> have<00:05:31.810> no<00:05:31.960> idea<00:05:32.260> what<00:05:32.410> I'm

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:32.500 
quickly I mean I have no idea what I'm

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:34.290 
quickly I mean I have no idea what I'm
gonna<00:05:32.620> come<00:05:32.830> across<00:05:33.190> that<00:05:33.430> that<00:05:33.760> inspires<00:05:34.180> me

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:34.300 
gonna come across that that inspires me

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.300 
gonna come across that that inspires me
so<00:05:34.660> if<00:05:35.110> I<00:05:35.200> see<00:05:35.320> a<00:05:35.350> foxglove<00:05:35.860> I<00:05:35.950> want<00:05:36.130> to<00:05:36.190> be<00:05:36.250> able

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:36.310 
so if I see a foxglove I want to be able

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:38.370 
so if I see a foxglove I want to be able
to<00:05:36.430> catch<00:05:36.580> it<00:05:36.610> immediately<00:05:37.090> no<00:05:37.840> literally

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:38.380 
to catch it immediately no literally

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:41.550 
to catch it immediately no literally
with<00:05:38.680> my<00:05:38.710> pencil<00:05:39.070> with<00:05:39.669> the<00:05:39.820> book<00:05:40.350> and<00:05:41.350> then

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:41.560 
with my pencil with the book and then

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:44.159 
with my pencil with the book and then
home<00:05:41.850> but<00:05:42.850> of<00:05:42.940> course<00:05:43.210> now<00:05:43.480> I've<00:05:43.600> got<00:05:43.780> sticks

00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:44.169 
home but of course now I've got sticks

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:47.159 
home but of course now I've got sticks
and<00:05:44.889> I've<00:05:45.100> got<00:05:45.340> the<00:05:45.490> pens<00:05:45.760> it<00:05:46.210> might<00:05:46.450> be<00:05:46.690> that<00:05:46.900> I

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:47.169 
and I've got the pens it might be that I

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:49.020 
and I've got the pens it might be that I
could<00:05:47.620> just<00:05:47.800> literally<00:05:48.340> you<00:05:48.490> know<00:05:48.669> put<00:05:49.000> a

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:49.030 
could just literally you know put a

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:52.380 
could just literally you know put a
couple<00:05:49.330> in<00:05:49.419> my<00:05:49.450> pocket<00:05:49.930> if<00:05:50.800> I<00:05:51.160> go<00:05:51.340> no<00:05:51.940> problem

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:52.390 
couple in my pocket if I go no problem

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:55.260 
couple in my pocket if I go no problem
so<00:05:53.140> it'll<00:05:53.350> be<00:05:53.440> very<00:05:53.470> interesting<00:05:54.070> to<00:05:54.100> see<00:05:54.270> see

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:55.270 
so it'll be very interesting to see see

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:59.659 
so it'll be very interesting to see see
how<00:05:55.419> my<00:05:55.570> work<00:05:55.750> changes<00:05:56.410> as<00:05:56.620> a<00:05:56.770> result

00:05:59.659 --> 00:05:59.669 

00:05:59.669 --> 00:06:03.619 

I<00:06:00.229> mean<00:06:01.229> if<00:06:01.499> you<00:06:01.800> were<00:06:02.669> going<00:06:02.849> to<00:06:03.030> ask<00:06:03.210> me<00:06:03.599> to

00:06:03.619 --> 00:06:03.629 
I mean if you were going to ask me to

00:06:03.629 --> 00:06:06.529 
I mean if you were going to ask me to
describe<00:06:03.840> my<00:06:04.349> style<00:06:04.610> I'd<00:06:05.610> say<00:06:05.969> that<00:06:06.150> I<00:06:06.180> come

00:06:06.529 --> 00:06:06.539 
describe my style I'd say that I come

00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:10.399 
describe my style I'd say that I come
out<00:06:06.599> of<00:06:07.080> an<00:06:07.439> interest<00:06:07.800> in<00:06:08.039> realism<00:06:09.029> a<00:06:09.389> love<00:06:10.229> of

00:06:10.399 --> 00:06:10.409 
out of an interest in realism a love of

00:06:10.409 --> 00:06:13.159 
out of an interest in realism a love of
early<00:06:10.710> Renaissance<00:06:11.509> painting<00:06:12.509> particularly

juror and I spent many years painting in
a<00:06:18.060> very<00:06:18.270> precise<00:06:18.810> way<00:06:19.580> trying<00:06:20.580> to<00:06:20.669> capture

00:06:21.909 --> 00:06:21.919 
a very precise way trying to capture

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:27.230 
a very precise way trying to capture
nature<00:06:23.840> looking<00:06:24.840> at<00:06:24.990> the<00:06:25.080> particular<00:06:26.240> rather

would<00:06:33.629> be<00:06:33.689> my<00:06:33.930> hero<00:06:34.520> if<00:06:35.520> I<00:06:35.879> had<00:06:36.240> to<00:06:36.360> name<00:06:36.509> anyone

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:38.180 
would be my hero if I had to name anyone

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:41.620 
would be my hero if I had to name anyone
I<00:06:38.800> use<00:06:39.800> watercolor<00:06:40.340> because<00:06:40.639> I<00:06:40.759> love<00:06:41.240> the

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:41.630 
I use watercolor because I love the

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:45.310 
I use watercolor because I love the
aqueous<00:06:42.610> quality<00:06:43.610> of<00:06:43.789> it<00:06:44.000> I<00:06:44.240> love<00:06:44.960> the

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:45.320 
aqueous quality of it I love the

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:48.640 
aqueous quality of it I love the
luminosity<00:06:45.800> of<00:06:46.130> it<00:06:46.550> and<00:06:47.210> I<00:06:47.419> love<00:06:47.780> the<00:06:48.110> pure

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:48.650 
luminosity of it and I love the pure

luminosity of it and I love the pure
color<00:06:49.490> and<00:06:49.880> the<00:06:50.810> fact<00:06:51.020> that<00:06:51.259> one<00:06:51.770> can<00:06:52.070> work<00:06:53.030> in

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:53.360 
color and the fact that one can work in

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:57.670 
color and the fact that one can work in
a<00:06:53.449> very<00:06:54.280> precise<00:06:55.280> way<00:06:55.780> but<00:06:56.780> also<00:06:56.960> allow<00:06:57.620> the

00:06:57.670 --> 00:06:57.680 
a very precise way but also allow the

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:00.249 
a very precise way but also allow the
watercolor<00:06:58.400> to<00:06:58.669> become<00:06:59.090> very<00:06:59.300> fluid<00:06:59.990> and

00:07:00.249 --> 00:07:00.259 
watercolor to become very fluid and

00:07:00.259 --> 00:07:02.879 
watercolor to become very fluid and
messy<00:07:00.860> and<00:07:01.100> make<00:07:01.699> very<00:07:01.910> beautiful<00:07:02.060> patterns

00:07:02.879 --> 00:07:02.889 
messy and make very beautiful patterns

00:07:02.889 --> 00:07:08.290 
messy and make very beautiful patterns
for<00:07:03.889> me<00:07:04.039> it's<00:07:04.250> the<00:07:04.990> it's<00:07:05.990> the<00:07:06.320> most<00:07:07.300> beautiful

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:08.300 
for me it's the it's the most beautiful

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:19.420 
for me it's the it's the most beautiful
medium<00:07:08.960> of<00:07:09.080> all
