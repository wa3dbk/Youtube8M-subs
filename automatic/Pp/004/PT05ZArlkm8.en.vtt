be sympathetic simplistic and say what
you<00:02:42.220> wear<00:02:42.550> but<00:02:43.000> in<00:02:43.150> effect<00:02:43.300> I<00:02:43.780> think<00:02:43.810> that's

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
you wear but in effect I think that's

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.330 
you wear but in effect I think that's
how<00:02:44.290> most<00:02:44.320> people<00:02:44.790> view<00:02:45.790> it<00:02:45.820> whereas<00:02:46.600> fashions

how most people view it whereas fashions

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.340 
how most people view it whereas fashions
characteristic<00:02:48.340> is<00:02:48.610> that<00:02:48.640> it's<00:02:49.630> a<00:02:50.020> taste

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
characteristic is that it's a taste

characteristic is that it's a taste
chaired<00:02:50.830> by<00:02:50.950> many<00:02:51.400> people<00:02:51.940> for<00:02:52.600> a<00:02:52.630> short

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:52.960 
chaired by many people for a short

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.890 
chaired by many people for a short
period<00:02:53.380> of<00:02:53.620> time<00:02:53.680> and<00:02:54.370> it<00:02:54.580> changes<00:02:55.180> and<00:02:55.390> that's

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
period of time and it changes and that's

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.350 
period of time and it changes and that's
the<00:02:56.260> key<00:02:56.530> element<00:02:57.040> of<00:02:57.130> fashion<00:02:57.670> is<00:02:57.850> the<00:02:58.030> change

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
the key element of fashion is the change

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:04.020 
the key element of fashion is the change
part

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:09.990 

well<00:03:05.030> that's<00:03:05.210> a<00:03:05.330> rather<00:03:05.480> complex<00:03:06.520> question

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.200 

because<00:03:11.000> I<00:03:11.420> think<00:03:11.660> the<00:03:12.140> study<00:03:12.410> of<00:03:12.500> dress<00:03:12.950> is<00:03:13.880> so

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:14.210 
because I think the study of dress is so

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:18.550 
because I think the study of dress is so
interdisciplinary<00:03:15.580> that<00:03:17.110> it<00:03:18.110> has<00:03:18.350> been

if<00:03:50.720> you're<00:03:50.870> talking<00:03:51.110> about<00:03:51.530> people<00:03:51.910> studying

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910 
if you're talking about people studying

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:56.020 
if you're talking about people studying
fashion<00:03:53.890> then<00:03:54.890> you<00:03:54.920> have<00:03:55.250> some<00:03:55.490> people<00:03:55.670> who've

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.030 
fashion then you have some people who've

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:58.930 
fashion then you have some people who've
studied<00:03:56.360> design<00:03:57.350> you<00:03:58.130> have<00:03:58.160> other<00:03:58.490> people<00:03:58.910> who

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
studied design you have other people who

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:00.660 
studied design you have other people who
study<00:03:59.330> meaning<00:03:59.810> so<00:04:00.290> if<00:04:00.380> you<00:04:00.470> have

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670 
study meaning so if you have

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:02.890 
study meaning so if you have
anthropologists<00:04:01.670> they've<00:04:02.360> always<00:04:02.570> been

some<00:04:09.950> other<00:04:10.100> comments<00:04:10.790> about<00:04:10.910> this<00:04:11.270> well<00:04:11.480> I

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:11.510 
some other comments about this well I

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:13.660 
some other comments about this well I
would<00:04:11.930> focus<00:04:12.170> on<00:04:12.500> a<00:04:12.560> slightly<00:04:12.920> different<00:04:13.430> area

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:13.670 
would focus on a slightly different area

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:16.930 
would focus on a slightly different area
and<00:04:14.150> that<00:04:14.300> is<00:04:14.600> today<00:04:15.080> there's<00:04:15.950> also<00:04:16.220> the

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
and that is today there's also the

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:21.190 
and that is today there's also the
professional<00:04:17.660> aspect<00:04:18.380> of<00:04:19.030> where<00:04:20.030> people<00:04:20.450> want

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:21.200 
professional aspect of where people want

00:04:50.689 --> 00:04:56.039 

I<00:04:50.779> think<00:04:51.649> one<00:04:51.889> of<00:04:51.919> the<00:04:53.409> most<00:04:54.489> interesting

00:04:56.039 --> 00:04:56.049 
I think one of the most interesting

00:04:56.049 --> 00:05:00.639 
I think one of the most interesting
parts<00:04:57.049> of<00:04:57.379> this<00:04:57.769> particular<00:04:58.459> ten-volume<00:04:59.649> you

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:00.649 
parts of this particular ten-volume you

00:05:00.649 --> 00:05:02.679 
parts of this particular ten-volume you
know<00:05:00.799> project<00:05:01.399> is<00:05:01.610> the<00:05:01.789> fact<00:05:02.059> that<00:05:02.209> it's

00:05:02.679 --> 00:05:02.689 
know project is the fact that it's

00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:07.149 
know project is the fact that it's
organized<00:05:03.409> geographically<00:05:04.360> so<00:05:05.360> that<00:05:06.159> the

00:05:07.149 --> 00:05:07.159 
organized geographically so that the

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:10.659 
organized geographically so that the
range<00:05:08.029> of<00:05:08.449> the<00:05:08.809> way<00:05:09.019> people<00:05:09.379> dress<00:05:09.889> around<00:05:10.519> the

have<00:05:12.769> a<00:05:13.269> Western<00:05:14.269> bias<00:05:15.009> because<00:05:16.009> if<00:05:16.219> you<00:05:16.339> look

00:05:16.509 --> 00:05:16.519 
have a Western bias because if you look

00:05:16.519 --> 00:05:18.579 
have a Western bias because if you look

of<00:05:51.110> the<00:05:51.229> world<00:05:51.259> and<00:05:51.949> so<00:05:52.879> we're<00:05:53.389> covering<00:05:53.659> a

00:05:54.009 --> 00:05:54.019 
of the world and so we're covering a

00:05:54.019 --> 00:05:58.719 
of the world and so we're covering a
much<00:05:54.229> broader<00:05:54.649> range<00:05:55.689> than<00:05:56.689> is<00:05:57.550> covered<00:05:58.550> in

00:05:58.719 --> 00:05:58.729 
much broader range than is covered in

00:05:58.729 --> 00:06:00.879 
much broader range than is covered in
most<00:05:59.179> of<00:05:59.389> the<00:05:59.479> other<00:05:59.719> kinds<00:06:00.409> of<00:06:00.469> works<00:06:00.709> that

00:06:00.879 --> 00:06:00.889 
most of the other kinds of works that

00:06:00.889 --> 00:06:03.429 
most of the other kinds of works that
deal<00:06:01.219> with<00:06:01.489> the<00:06:01.639> history<00:06:01.729> of<00:06:02.059> dress<00:06:02.629> I<00:06:02.989> think

00:06:03.429 --> 00:06:03.439 
deal with the history of dress I think

00:06:03.439 --> 00:06:07.659 
deal with the history of dress I think
that<00:06:04.009> that<00:06:04.759> the<00:06:05.019> encyclopedia<00:06:06.019> is<00:06:06.229> unique<00:06:06.800> we

00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:07.669 
that that the encyclopedia is unique we

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:10.359 
that that the encyclopedia is unique we
have<00:06:07.699> Joanne<00:06:08.209> to<00:06:08.449> thank<00:06:08.719> for<00:06:09.289> that<00:06:09.369> because

00:06:10.359 --> 00:06:10.369 
have Joanne to thank for that because

00:06:10.369 --> 00:06:13.299 
have Joanne to thank for that because
her<00:06:11.300> focus<00:06:11.869> for<00:06:12.529> as<00:06:12.619> long<00:06:12.769> as<00:06:12.949> I<00:06:13.099> have<00:06:13.279> known

00:06:13.299 --> 00:06:13.309 
her focus for as long as I have known

00:06:13.309 --> 00:06:17.499 
her focus for as long as I have known
her<00:06:13.819> has<00:06:14.209> always<00:06:14.599> been<00:06:15.319> worldwide<00:06:16.099> and<00:06:16.579> I

00:06:17.499 --> 00:06:17.509 
her has always been worldwide and I

00:06:17.509 --> 00:06:20.559 
her has always been worldwide and I
think<00:06:17.929> the<00:06:18.229> idea<00:06:18.469> of<00:06:19.099> bringing<00:06:19.399> together<00:06:20.089> in

00:06:20.559 --> 00:06:20.569 
think the idea of bringing together in

00:06:20.569 --> 00:06:24.639 
think the idea of bringing together in
one<00:06:21.019> collection<00:06:21.529> of<00:06:22.099> volumes<00:06:23.110> works<00:06:24.110> about
