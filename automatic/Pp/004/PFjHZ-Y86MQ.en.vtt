diorama movie set you know that kind of
thing<00:00:13.530> and<00:00:13.860> it's<00:00:14.340> real<00:00:14.670> easy<00:00:14.910> and<00:00:15.949> there's

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
thing and it's real easy and there's

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.099 
thing and it's real easy and there's
only<00:00:17.070> really<00:00:17.340> two<00:00:17.789> things<00:00:18.240> you'll<00:00:18.510> need<00:00:18.720> to

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
only really two things you'll need to

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.900 
only really two things you'll need to
build<00:00:20.070> it<00:00:20.310> so<00:00:21.270> what<00:00:21.420> you<00:00:21.539> see<00:00:21.720> right<00:00:21.750> now<00:00:21.990> is<00:00:22.170> a

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:22.910 
build it so what you see right now is a

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:26.500 
build it so what you see right now is a
360<00:00:23.910> degree<00:00:24.269> cockpit<00:00:24.930> for<00:00:25.170> the<00:00:25.260> Aqsa<00:00:25.619> gonna

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:26.510 
360 degree cockpit for the Aqsa gonna

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:33.620 
360 degree cockpit for the Aqsa gonna
pick<00:00:27.510> that<00:00:27.720> up<00:00:30.380> there's<00:00:31.380> shards<00:00:31.859> gun<00:00:32.219> them<00:00:32.630> you

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
pick that up there's shards gun them you

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.479 
pick that up there's shards gun them you
can<00:00:33.719> see<00:00:33.930> pretty<00:00:34.500> cool<00:00:34.829> little<00:00:35.219> background

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
can see pretty cool little background

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.990 
can see pretty cool little background
not<00:00:36.680> terribly<00:00:37.680> fancy<00:00:38.250> but<00:00:38.489> it's<00:00:38.579> got<00:00:38.760> some

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
not terribly fancy but it's got some

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.450 
not terribly fancy but it's got some
detail<00:00:39.480> to<00:00:39.840> it<00:00:42.290> so<00:00:43.290> this<00:00:43.530> is<00:00:43.590> where<00:00:43.980> you<00:00:44.250> can

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
detail to it so this is where you can

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.470 
detail to it so this is where you can
start<00:00:44.789> trying<00:00:45.000> to<00:00:45.090> figure<00:00:45.300> out<00:00:45.480> what<00:00:45.899> they<00:00:46.110> are

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:47.480 
start trying to figure out what they are

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.770 
start trying to figure out what they are
what<00:00:48.480> is<00:00:48.660> this<00:00:48.870> background<00:00:49.230> and<00:00:50.510> I<00:00:51.510> made<00:00:51.750> all

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
what is this background and I made all

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.260 
what is this background and I made all
this<00:00:52.170> out<00:00:52.410> of<00:00:52.500> them<00:00:52.649> and<00:00:53.370> truth<00:00:53.760> is<00:00:53.940> that<00:00:54.090> can

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
this out of them and truth is that can

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.330 
this out of them and truth is that can
apply<00:00:54.570> for<00:00:55.879> GI<00:00:56.879> Joes<00:00:57.270> as<00:00:57.570> well<00:00:57.870> and<00:00:58.559> truth<00:00:59.190> is

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
apply for GI Joes as well and truth is

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.889 
apply for GI Joes as well and truth is
you<00:00:59.550> could<00:00:59.850> make<00:01:00.329> it<00:01:00.449> any<00:01:00.570> color<00:01:00.870> you<00:01:01.050> want<00:01:01.829> to

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:02.899 
you could make it any color you want to

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:08.560 
you could make it any color you want to
basically<00:01:03.979> all<00:01:04.979> I<00:01:05.040> used<00:01:06.380> was<00:01:07.380> old<00:01:07.590> VHS<00:01:08.159> tapes

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570

that's right
well<00:01:10.710> VHS<00:01:11.369> tapes<00:01:11.729> remember<00:01:12.659> those<00:01:12.840> things

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
well VHS tapes remember those things

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.070 
well VHS tapes remember those things
they<00:01:13.470> used<00:01:13.650> to<00:01:13.799> put<00:01:13.979> in<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.310> VCR<00:01:14.909> and<00:01:15.080> watch

inside of a building or a space base
like<00:01:48.240> a<00:01:48.270> Bal<00:01:48.540> kou<00:01:48.930> um<00:01:49.860> I've<00:01:50.700> seen<00:01:50.810> stop-motion

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710

Gundam stop motions and others and I

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.649 
Gundam stop motions and others and I
like<00:02:02.189> to<00:02:02.340> learn<00:02:02.490> from<00:02:02.759> other<00:02:02.939> people<00:02:03.299> and<00:02:03.479> then

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
like to learn from other people and then

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.289 
like to learn from other people and then
I<00:02:03.750> like<00:02:03.960> to<00:02:03.990> take<00:02:04.290> it<00:02:04.439> a<00:02:04.469> step<00:02:04.710> further<00:02:04.790> so<00:02:05.790> yeah

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
I like to take it a step further so yeah

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.809 
I like to take it a step further so yeah
all<00:02:06.540> I<00:02:06.570> really<00:02:06.840> did<00:02:07.110> was

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:09.819 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:13.699 

took<00:02:10.209> one<00:02:10.390> of<00:02:10.420> these<00:02:10.599> and<00:02:11.170> I<00:02:11.290> spray-painted<00:02:11.650> it

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
took one of these and I spray-painted it

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:16.890 
took one of these and I spray-painted it
that's<00:02:14.709> all<00:02:14.829> I<00:02:15.010> did<00:02:15.069> pretty<00:02:16.000> much<00:02:16.209> avoid<00:02:16.510> using

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
that's all I did pretty much avoid using

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.420 
that's all I did pretty much avoid using
that<00:02:17.019> side<00:02:17.260> because<00:02:17.470> it's<00:02:17.590> got<00:02:17.739> the<00:02:17.860> holes<00:02:18.069> so

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
that side because it's got the holes so

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.500 
that side because it's got the holes so
I'm<00:02:19.180> just<00:02:19.329> pretty<00:02:19.629> much<00:02:19.780> using<00:02:20.110> that<00:02:20.260> side<00:02:21.510> but

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
I'm just pretty much using that side but

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.399 
I'm just pretty much using that side but
um<00:02:22.689> it<00:02:23.019> makes<00:02:23.319> a<00:02:23.470> good<00:02:23.650> little<00:02:24.579> background<00:02:25.409> it

00:02:26.399 --> 00:02:26.409 
um it makes a good little background it

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:29.490 
um it makes a good little background it
could<00:02:26.590> be<00:02:26.709> a<00:02:26.739> huge<00:02:27.099> metal<00:02:27.340> wall<00:02:27.730> or<00:02:28.299> the<00:02:29.110> inside

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
could be a huge metal wall or the inside

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:36.690 
could be a huge metal wall or the inside
of<00:02:29.620> a<00:02:29.709> base<00:02:29.920> or<00:02:30.489> kind<00:02:31.209> of<00:02:31.329> whatever<00:02:31.720> really<00:02:35.700> now

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
of a base or kind of whatever really now

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.410 
of a base or kind of whatever really now
my<00:02:37.030> recommendations<00:02:37.959> are<00:02:38.470> that<00:02:39.269> you<00:02:40.269> would

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
my recommendations are that you would

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:46.559 
my recommendations are that you would
get<00:02:40.659> ones<00:02:41.019> that<00:02:42.900> have<00:02:43.900> either<00:02:44.319> flat<00:02:45.359> but<00:02:46.359> don't

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:46.569 
get ones that have either flat but don't

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:47.339 
get ones that have either flat but don't
have<00:02:46.720> a<00:02:46.750> sticker

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:47.349 
have a sticker

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:50.789 
have a sticker

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:50.799 
it's either printed or blank and avoid

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:55.170 
it's either printed or blank and avoid

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
ones that have indented writing because

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.559 
ones that have indented writing because
that<00:02:55.389> does<00:02:55.629> show<00:02:55.900> up<00:02:56.109> you<00:02:57.069> see<00:02:57.459> right<00:02:58.180> there<00:02:58.209> it

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:17.920

but um yeah I think it looks pretty cool
I'm<00:04:18.920> hoping<00:04:19.250> to<00:04:19.370> use<00:04:19.550> them<00:04:19.760> for<00:04:19.970> stop-motion

animation that's the inside of a bass or
something<00:04:26.390> like<00:04:26.540> that<00:04:26.780> I<00:04:27.200> am<00:04:27.890> thinking<00:04:28.280> I'm

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.030 
something like that I am thinking I'm

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:31.420 
something like that I am thinking I'm
going<00:04:29.480> to<00:04:29.630> try<00:04:30.440> going<00:04:30.740> over<00:04:31.010> one<00:04:31.160> of<00:04:31.310> these

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.430 
going to try going over one of these

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:35.020 
going to try going over one of these
with<00:04:31.700> a<00:04:31.730> wash<00:04:32.030> and<00:04:33.310> see<00:04:34.310> if<00:04:34.430> it<00:04:34.550> brings<00:04:34.700> out

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030 
with a wash and see if it brings out

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:37.270 
with a wash and see if it brings out
more<00:04:35.240> of<00:04:35.300> the<00:04:35.450> detail<00:04:35.870> something<00:04:36.710> you<00:04:36.920> don't

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:37.280 
more of the detail something you don't

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.030 
more of the detail something you don't
really<00:04:37.580> notice<00:04:37.940> until<00:04:38.360> after<00:04:39.230> its<00:04:39.380> painted<00:04:39.890> is

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:40.040
