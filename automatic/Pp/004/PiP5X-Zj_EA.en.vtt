00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.389 
dip onto the lip of the pan I'll show
you<00:01:45.360> what<00:01:45.570> that<00:01:45.780> looks<00:01:46.079> like<00:01:46.170> here<00:01:46.680> just<00:01:47.250> a

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399

that<00:01:51.810> dopes<00:01:52.170> so<00:01:52.680> there<00:01:52.979> you<00:01:53.159> have<00:01:53.189> it<00:01:54.320> the<00:01:55.320> next

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
that dopes so there you have it the next

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.109 
that dopes so there you have it the next
thing<00:01:55.710> that<00:01:55.890> we're<00:01:56.130> going<00:01:56.310> to<00:01:56.399> do<00:01:56.670> is<00:01:56.880> we're

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
thing that we're going to do is we're

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.800 
thing that we're going to do is we're
going<00:01:57.149> to<00:01:57.360> take<00:01:57.570> about<00:01:57.719> two<00:01:58.110> tablespoons<00:01:58.649> of

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.720 

now<00:02:09.430> your<00:02:09.760> dough<00:02:09.940> might<00:02:10.300> start<00:02:11.370> shrinking<00:02:12.370> on

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
now your dough might start shrinking on

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.090 
now your dough might start shrinking on
you<00:02:13.030> and<00:02:13.390> as<00:02:13.510> mine<00:02:13.810> is<00:02:14.080> right<00:02:14.320> now<00:02:14.530> just<00:02:14.920> go

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.570 
back and push it back into place the

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:26.910 
back and push it back into place the
next<00:02:23.080> step<00:02:23.380> that<00:02:23.410> we're<00:02:23.860> going<00:02:24.190> to<00:02:24.400> do<00:02:25.110> is<00:02:26.110> to

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
next step that we're going to do is to

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.210 
next step that we're going to do is to
use<00:02:27.190> Tomatoes<00:02:28.060> I<00:02:28.360> like<00:02:29.050> to<00:02:29.260> use<00:02:29.500> actually
