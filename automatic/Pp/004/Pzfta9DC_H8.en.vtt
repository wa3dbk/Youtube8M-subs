00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
one that we use when we did the

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.499 
one that we use when we did the
photographs<00:01:53.040> of<00:01:53.220> lines<00:01:53.490> remember<00:01:54.000> that<00:01:54.270> shot

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.630 
this is a little less of a wide-angle
lens<00:01:57.509> so<00:01:58.020> it's<00:01:58.170> allowing<00:01:58.560> me<00:01:58.590> to<00:01:58.740> narrow<00:01:59.369> the

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
lens so it's allowing me to narrow the

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.209 
lens so it's allowing me to narrow the
angle<00:01:59.670> of<00:02:00.180> view<00:02:00.450> in<00:02:00.630> a<00:02:00.659> little<00:02:01.049> closer<00:02:01.259> and<00:02:01.649> the

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
angle of view in a little closer and the

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.160 
angle of view in a little closer and the
reason<00:02:02.549> for<00:02:02.729> that<00:02:02.820> is<00:02:03.060> in<00:02:03.329> the<00:02:03.479> background<00:02:03.750> of

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
reason for that is in the background of

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.530 
reason for that is in the background of
this<00:02:04.320> shot<00:02:04.619> there<00:02:05.310> is<00:02:05.430> a<00:02:05.460> bright<00:02:05.790> sky<00:02:06.119> above

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
this shot there is a bright sky above

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.960 
this shot there is a bright sky above
the<00:02:06.719> trees<00:02:07.049> and<00:02:07.380> I<00:02:07.890> want<00:02:08.160> to<00:02:08.310> eliminate<00:02:08.640> that

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
the trees and I want to eliminate that

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.330 
the trees and I want to eliminate that
from<00:02:09.720> the<00:02:09.899> shot<00:02:10.140> so<00:02:10.440> I've<00:02:10.590> made<00:02:10.979> it<00:02:11.099> tighter

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
from the shot so I've made it tighter

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.730 
from the shot so I've made it tighter
I've<00:02:12.090> come<00:02:12.390> in<00:02:12.540> on<00:02:12.690> these<00:02:12.900> two<00:02:13.170> varied

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
I've come in on these two varied

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.240 
I've come in on these two varied
stinked<00:02:15.200> tombstones<00:02:16.200> in<00:02:16.350> the<00:02:16.470> foreground<00:02:16.830> and

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
stinked tombstones in the foreground and

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.580 
stinked tombstones in the foreground and
then<00:02:17.370> you<00:02:17.490> can<00:02:17.670> see<00:02:17.940> many<00:02:18.630> of<00:02:18.780> the<00:02:18.930> very<00:02:19.320> old

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
then you can see many of the very old

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.500 
then you can see many of the very old
tombstones<00:02:20.160> with<00:02:20.490> their<00:02:20.670> etchings<00:02:21.090> on<00:02:21.300> them

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
tombstones with their etchings on them

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:22.970 
tombstones with their etchings on them
in<00:02:21.630> the<00:02:21.720> background<00:02:22.170> and<00:02:22.380> then<00:02:22.500> the<00:02:22.530> trees

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
in the background and then the trees

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.160 
in the background and then the trees
beyond<00:02:23.460> that<00:02:23.700> this<00:02:24.120> is<00:02:24.330> the<00:02:24.480> joy<00:02:24.690> of<00:02:25.020> doing

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
beyond that this is the joy of doing

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.170 
beyond that this is the joy of doing
this<00:02:25.380> kind<00:02:25.440> of<00:02:25.680> work<00:02:25.740> coming<00:02:26.220> out<00:02:26.460> being<00:02:27.030> out

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
this kind of work coming out being out

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.450 
this kind of work coming out being out
in<00:02:27.330> the<00:02:27.450> outdoors<00:02:27.920> seeing<00:02:28.920> interesting

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:29.460 
in the outdoors seeing interesting

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:31.070 
in the outdoors seeing interesting
things<00:02:29.730> and<00:02:30.030> making<00:02:30.210> photographs<00:02:30.810> and

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
things and making photographs and

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.260 
things and making photographs and
working<00:02:31.950> the<00:02:32.070> subject<00:02:32.550> until<00:02:32.700> you<00:02:32.970> get<00:02:33.120> the

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
working the subject until you get the

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.690 
working the subject until you get the
photograph<00:02:33.660> that<00:02:33.870> you<00:02:33.930> really<00:02:34.260> want<00:02:34.500> and<00:02:34.710> if

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
photograph that you really want and if

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.910 
photograph that you really want and if
you<00:02:35.940> can<00:02:36.120> go<00:02:36.300> by<00:02:36.540> a<00:02:36.900> special<00:02:37.440> place<00:02:37.680> to<00:02:37.800> your

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
you can go by a special place to your

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.220 
you can go by a special place to your
family<00:02:38.340> it<00:02:38.430> makes<00:02:38.610> it<00:02:38.730> even<00:02:38.850> better<00:02:39.200> one<00:02:40.200> of

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
family it makes it even better one of

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.050 
family it makes it even better one of
the<00:02:40.440> things<00:02:40.710> that<00:02:40.920> I'm<00:02:41.040> attempting<00:02:41.430> to<00:02:41.700> do<00:02:41.880> in

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
the things that I'm attempting to do in

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.900 
the things that I'm attempting to do in
this<00:02:42.210> shot<00:02:42.450> is<00:02:42.920> get<00:02:43.920> as<00:02:44.070> much<00:02:44.280> depth<00:02:44.610> of<00:02:44.730> field

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
this shot is get as much depth of field

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.910 
this shot is get as much depth of field
as<00:02:45.060> possible<00:02:45.510> so<00:02:45.660> that<00:02:45.690> the<00:02:45.990> trees<00:02:46.380> all<00:02:46.860> the

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
as possible so that the trees all the

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.920 
as possible so that the trees all the
way<00:02:47.190> in<00:02:47.310> the<00:02:47.400> background<00:02:47.820> of<00:02:47.970> sharp<00:02:48.180> and<00:02:48.420> the

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
way in the background of sharp and the

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.780 
way in the background of sharp and the
tombstones<00:02:49.440> closest<00:02:50.010> to<00:02:50.130> me<00:02:50.250> which<00:02:50.490> are<00:02:50.640> only

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
tombstones closest to me which are only

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.750 
tombstones closest to me which are only
about<00:02:51.000> 15<00:02:51.630> feet<00:02:51.810> away<00:02:51.960> or<00:02:52.110> sharp<00:02:52.530> so<00:02:53.370> I've

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
about 15 feet away or sharp so I've

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.120 
about 15 feet away or sharp so I've
stopped<00:02:54.180> the<00:02:54.330> lens<00:02:54.510> down<00:02:54.720> to<00:02:54.960> about<00:02:55.080> f11<00:02:55.710> and<00:02:55.920> I

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
stopped the lens down to about f11 and I

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:57.740 
stopped the lens down to about f11 and I
focused<00:02:56.610> a<00:02:56.730> third<00:02:57.060> of<00:02:57.240> the<00:02:57.300> way<00:02:57.420> into<00:02:57.660> the

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
focused a third of the way into the

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.920 
focused a third of the way into the
frame<00:02:58.110> now<00:02:58.890> it's<00:02:59.790> not<00:03:00.030> a<00:03:00.090> third<00:03:00.450> of<00:03:00.600> the<00:03:00.660> way<00:03:00.780> in

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
frame now it's not a third of the way in

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.140 
frame now it's not a third of the way in
terms<00:03:01.110> of<00:03:01.290> if<00:03:01.470> we<00:03:01.620> measured<00:03:02.220> a<00:03:02.430> third<00:03:02.970> of<00:03:03.090> the

terms of if we measured a third of the
way<00:03:03.300> in<00:03:03.540> but<00:03:04.140> we<00:03:04.380> want<00:03:04.620> to<00:03:04.740> get<00:03:04.890> far<00:03:05.220> enough

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
way in but we want to get far enough

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.420 
way in but we want to get far enough
into<00:03:05.640> the<00:03:05.730> frame<00:03:06.150> so<00:03:06.810> that<00:03:06.840> that's<00:03:07.380> area<00:03:08.310> and

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
into the frame so that that's area and

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:09.960 
the Front's going to be sharp but we

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.380 
the Front's going to be sharp but we

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
of field works kind of crazy it's two

thirds<00:03:15.450> of<00:03:15.810> your<00:03:16.170> sharpness<00:03:16.650> is<00:03:16.800> behind<00:03:17.190> where

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:17.490 
thirds of your sharpness is behind where

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:19.790 
thirds of your sharpness is behind where
you<00:03:17.610> focus<00:03:17.880> one<00:03:18.690> third<00:03:18.960> is<00:03:19.170> in<00:03:19.320> front<00:03:19.560> of<00:03:19.680> where

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:19.800 
you focus one third is in front of where

you focus one third is in front of where
you<00:03:19.920> focus<00:03:20.160> that's<00:03:20.760> why<00:03:20.940> if<00:03:21.060> you<00:03:21.180> go<00:03:21.210> a<00:03:21.330> third

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
you focus that's why if you go a third

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.080 
you focus that's why if you go a third
in<00:03:21.960> everything<00:03:22.920> from<00:03:23.040> a<00:03:23.220> third<00:03:23.430> end<00:03:23.670> back<00:03:23.910> is

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
in everything from a third end back is

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.000 
in everything from a third end back is
going<00:03:24.270> to<00:03:24.330> be<00:03:24.420> sharp<00:03:24.660> and<00:03:24.930> then<00:03:25.440> it<00:03:25.740> should<00:03:25.950> be

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
going to be sharp and then it should be

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.100 
going to be sharp and then it should be
sharp<00:03:26.370> to<00:03:26.580> infinity<00:03:27.090> and<00:03:27.300> we<00:03:27.750> use<00:03:27.930> this

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
sharp to infinity and we use this

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:29.720 
sharp to infinity and we use this
technique<00:03:28.560> for<00:03:28.710> landscape<00:03:29.160> photography<00:03:29.190> a

lot in the old days we had an actual

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:37.740 
your f-stop settings would be for

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:39.440 
your f-stop settings would be for
infinity<00:03:38.310> and<00:03:38.490> the<00:03:38.580> closest<00:03:39.000> focusing

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
infinity and the closest focusing

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:40.760 
infinity and the closest focusing
distance<00:03:39.780> and<00:03:39.900> you<00:03:39.990> it<00:03:40.170> was<00:03:40.290> called<00:03:40.500> hyper

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:40.770 
distance and you it was called hyper

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:43.070 
distance and you it was called hyper
focal<00:03:41.280> distance<00:03:41.700> you<00:03:42.150> could<00:03:42.300> actually<00:03:42.480> set<00:03:42.930> it

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:43.080 
focal distance you could actually set it

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:46.130 
focal distance you could actually set it
that<00:03:43.110> way<00:03:43.470> today<00:03:44.330> because<00:03:45.330> the<00:03:45.660> lenses<00:03:45.990> are

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
that way today because the lenses are

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:47.480 
that way today because the lenses are
made<00:03:46.320> differently<00:03:46.530> we<00:03:46.980> don't<00:03:47.160> have<00:03:47.340> those

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:47.490 
made differently we don't have those

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:49.760 
made differently we don't have those
scales<00:03:47.790> anymore<00:03:48.300> but<00:03:48.900> we<00:03:49.020> can<00:03:49.230> still<00:03:49.440> guess

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:49.770 
scales anymore but we can still guess

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:51.470 
scales anymore but we can still guess
and<00:03:50.130> for<00:03:50.430> the<00:03:50.520> most<00:03:50.670> part<00:03:50.970> it<00:03:51.120> works<00:03:51.300> pretty

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
and for the most part it works pretty

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.250 
and for the most part it works pretty
well<00:03:52.850> while<00:03:53.850> I<00:03:53.880> was<00:03:54.000> working<00:03:54.390> on<00:03:54.750> the

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
well while I was working on the

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.860 
well while I was working on the
photograph<00:03:55.980> of<00:03:56.160> the<00:03:56.280> tombstones<00:03:56.820> I<00:03:57.180> turned

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
photograph of the tombstones I turned

00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.360 
photograph of the tombstones I turned
around<00:03:57.990> to<00:03:58.140> walk<00:03:58.350> away<00:03:58.500> and<00:03:58.800> here<00:03:59.130> it's<00:03:59.250> a

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
around to walk away and here it's a

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.520 
around to walk away and here it's a
great<00:03:59.550> lesson<00:03:59.910> about<00:04:00.360> the<00:04:00.660> intimate

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
great lesson about the intimate

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.790 
great lesson about the intimate
landscape<00:04:02.510> always<00:04:03.510> look<00:04:03.810> behind<00:04:03.990> you<00:04:04.500> because

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:04.800 
landscape always look behind you because

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.200 
landscape always look behind you because
you<00:04:05.130> never<00:04:05.310> know<00:04:05.550> when<00:04:05.700> you're<00:04:05.820> gonna<00:04:05.880> see<00:04:06.180> a

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:06.210 
you never know when you're gonna see a

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:08.810 
you never know when you're gonna see a
shot<00:04:06.510> that<00:04:06.870> you<00:04:06.930> really<00:04:07.320> like<00:04:07.530> as<00:04:07.860> I<00:04:08.640> was

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820 
shot that you really like as I was

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:10.370 
shot that you really like as I was
turning<00:04:09.060> to<00:04:09.270> walk<00:04:09.480> away<00:04:09.720> I<00:04:09.750> looked<00:04:10.140> at<00:04:10.260> the

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380 
turning to walk away I looked at the

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.530 
turning to walk away I looked at the
side<00:04:10.590> of<00:04:10.740> the<00:04:10.830> church<00:04:11.070> and<00:04:11.459> noticed<00:04:12.240> that<00:04:12.330> the

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
side of the church and noticed that the

side of the church and noticed that the
very<00:04:12.840> late<00:04:13.110> light<00:04:13.320> coming<00:04:13.740> through<00:04:13.890> the<00:04:13.980> trees

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
very late light coming through the trees

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.280 
very late light coming through the trees
was<00:04:14.910> right<00:04:15.180> on<00:04:15.209> the<00:04:15.510> board's<00:04:15.900> that<00:04:16.049> had<00:04:16.140> been

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:16.290 
was right on the board's that had been

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:18.440 
was right on the board's that had been
painted<00:04:16.530> over<00:04:16.859> and<00:04:17.100> over<00:04:17.400> a<00:04:17.430> lot<00:04:17.670> of<00:04:17.820> texture

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
painted over and over a lot of texture

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:20.360 
painted over and over a lot of texture
and<00:04:18.959> we<00:04:19.080> want<00:04:19.320> to<00:04:19.380> talk<00:04:19.530> about<00:04:19.770> texture<00:04:20.160> and

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
and we want to talk about texture and

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:23.030 
and we want to talk about texture and
shapes<00:04:20.670> here's<00:04:21.480> a<00:04:21.540> great<00:04:21.810> example<00:04:21.919> there<00:04:22.919> was

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.040 
shapes here's a great example there was

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.520 
shapes here's a great example there was
a<00:04:23.070> window<00:04:23.460> with<00:04:23.610> reflections<00:04:24.530> wonderful

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
a window with reflections wonderful

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.320 
a window with reflections wonderful
shape<00:04:25.800> and<00:04:26.130> there<00:04:26.250> was<00:04:26.370> wonderful<00:04:26.760> texture<00:04:27.210> in

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
shape and there was wonderful texture in

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:27.470 
shape and there was wonderful texture in
the

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:27.480 
the

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.410 
the
paint<00:04:27.720> on<00:04:27.930> the<00:04:28.050> church<00:04:28.290> so<00:04:29.070> I<00:04:29.460> simply<00:04:30.120> turned

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:30.420 
paint on the church so I simply turned

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:33.080 
paint on the church so I simply turned
the<00:04:30.570> tripod<00:04:31.050> around<00:04:31.350> same<00:04:31.830> lens<00:04:32.160> same<00:04:32.790> setup

the tripod around same lens same setup

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:36.560 
the tripod around same lens same setup
and<00:04:33.480> got<00:04:34.380> a<00:04:34.610> composition<00:04:35.610> then<00:04:36.210> I<00:04:36.240> really

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.570 
and got a composition then I really

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:39.500 
and got a composition then I really
liked<00:04:36.810> and<00:04:37.250> popped<00:04:38.250> off<00:04:38.430> a<00:04:38.460> few<00:04:38.760> shots<00:04:38.910> this<00:04:39.330> is

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:39.510 
liked and popped off a few shots this is

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:41.510 
liked and popped off a few shots this is
the<00:04:39.630> kind<00:04:39.840> of<00:04:39.900> thing<00:04:40.110> that<00:04:40.500> you<00:04:40.860> have<00:04:41.070> to<00:04:41.220> make

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
the kind of thing that you have to make

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.120 
the kind of thing that you have to make

get to the next location but by simply

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.510 
get to the next location but by simply
observing<00:05:00.240> as<00:05:00.600> you<00:05:01.020> walk<00:05:01.230> around<00:05:01.410> you'll<00:05:02.280> come

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:02.520 
observing as you walk around you'll come

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.160 
observing as you walk around you'll come
upon<00:05:02.640> some<00:05:03.060> of<00:05:03.090> the<00:05:03.150> shots<00:05:03.390> that<00:05:03.570> you'll<00:05:03.990> like

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:06.540 
the best and honestly I think later when

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:08.090 
the best and honestly I think later when
I'm<00:05:06.690> working<00:05:07.110> on<00:05:07.200> these<00:05:07.380> images<00:05:07.770> I've<00:05:07.890> got<00:05:08.070> a

I'm working on these images I've got a

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:09.440 
I'm working on these images I've got a
feeling<00:05:08.520> this<00:05:08.610> is<00:05:08.760> going<00:05:08.880> to<00:05:08.970> be<00:05:09.120> one<00:05:09.240> of<00:05:09.270> my

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:09.450 
feeling this is going to be one of my

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:11.600 
feeling this is going to be one of my
favorite<00:05:09.810> images<00:05:09.900> the<00:05:10.680> lot<00:05:10.890> was<00:05:11.130> really<00:05:11.430> nice

texture<00:05:13.800> and<00:05:14.030> it<00:05:15.030> wasn't<00:05:15.210> a<00:05:15.390> difficult

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:15.570 
texture and it wasn't a difficult

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:17.270 
texture and it wasn't a difficult
photograph<00:05:16.140> to<00:05:16.260> make<00:05:16.470> and<00:05:16.830> I<00:05:16.920> didn't<00:05:17.190> even

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:20.570 
photograph to make and I didn't even
have<00:05:17.430> to<00:05:17.580> move<00:05:17.730> the<00:05:17.880> tripod<00:05:18.120> very<00:05:18.570> far<00:05:18.810> but<00:05:19.580> it

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:20.580 
have to move the tripod very far but it

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:22.280 
have to move the tripod very far but it
was<00:05:20.790> worth<00:05:21.000> doing<00:05:21.060> now<00:05:21.750> we're<00:05:21.900> going<00:05:21.990> to<00:05:22.050> look

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:22.290 
was worth doing now we're going to look

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:23.780 
was worth doing now we're going to look
inside<00:05:22.470> the<00:05:22.860> church<00:05:23.100> and<00:05:23.280> see<00:05:23.430> if<00:05:23.520> there's<00:05:23.700> a

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:23.790 
inside the church and see if there's a

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:26.150 
inside the church and see if there's a
shot<00:05:24.000> there<00:05:24.240> we'll<00:05:25.170> see<00:05:25.200> what<00:05:25.500> the<00:05:25.620> lots<00:05:25.800> doing

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:26.160 
shot there we'll see what the lots doing

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.550 
shot there we'll see what the lots doing
for<00:05:26.370> us<00:05:26.520> it's<00:05:26.820> at<00:05:26.970> a<00:05:27.000> good<00:05:27.240> angle<00:05:27.380> though<00:05:28.380> it's

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:28.560 
for us it's at a good angle though it's

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.500 
for us it's at a good angle though it's
not<00:05:28.710> that<00:05:28.920> strong<00:05:29.250> so<00:05:29.490> we'll<00:05:29.670> see<00:05:29.880> what<00:05:30.090> we'll

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:30.510 
not that strong so we'll see what we'll

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:32.750 
not that strong so we'll see what we'll
see<00:05:30.660> what<00:05:30.810> it<00:05:30.900> looks<00:05:31.080> like<00:05:31.230> I'm<00:05:31.980> about<00:05:32.370> to<00:05:32.430> make

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:32.760 
see what it looks like I'm about to make

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:36.020 
see what it looks like I'm about to make
an<00:05:33.060> intimate<00:05:34.020> landscape<00:05:34.620> photograph<00:05:35.160> that

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:36.030 
an intimate landscape photograph that

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:38.120 
an intimate landscape photograph that
could<00:05:36.240> have<00:05:36.330> never<00:05:36.570> been<00:05:36.870> made<00:05:37.110> before<00:05:37.170> and

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:38.130 
could have never been made before and

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:41.600 
could have never been made before and
that's<00:05:38.970> because<00:05:39.330> today<00:05:39.650> we<00:05:40.650> have<00:05:40.860> technology

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:41.610 
that's because today we have technology

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:42.160 
that's because today we have technology
called

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:42.170 
called

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:46.100 
called
HDR<00:05:43.170> high<00:05:43.500> dynamic<00:05:43.800> range<00:05:44.640> and<00:05:45.000> what<00:05:45.600> we<00:05:45.750> do<00:05:45.900> is

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:46.110 
HDR high dynamic range and what we do is

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:49.340 
HDR high dynamic range and what we do is
we<00:05:46.290> make<00:05:46.500> several<00:05:47.490> photographs<00:05:48.080> one<00:05:49.080> stop

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:49.350 
we make several photographs one stop

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:53.060 
we make several photographs one stop
apart<00:05:49.800> and<00:05:50.100> then<00:05:50.820> with<00:05:51.060> special<00:05:51.600> software<00:05:52.590> we

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:53.070 
apart and then with special software we

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:55.400 
apart and then with special software we
can<00:05:53.250> put<00:05:53.460> those<00:05:53.610> images<00:05:53.820> together<00:05:54.210> and<00:05:54.540> we<00:05:55.230> can

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:55.410 
can put those images together and we can

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:57.830 
can put those images together and we can
have<00:05:55.620> from<00:05:56.190> the<00:05:56.340> brightest<00:05:56.880> area<00:05:57.420> to<00:05:57.720> the

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:57.840 
have from the brightest area to the

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:00.800 
have from the brightest area to the
darkest<00:05:58.320> area<00:05:58.710> still<00:05:59.190> holding<00:05:59.700> detail<00:06:00.060> now<00:06:00.690> in

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:00.810 
darkest area still holding detail now in

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:03.230 
darkest area still holding detail now in
the<00:06:00.900> old<00:06:01.080> days<00:06:01.290> when<00:06:01.830> we<00:06:01.980> shot<00:06:02.190> film<00:06:02.460> we<00:06:03.150> had

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:03.240 
the old days when we shot film we had

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:06.380 
the old days when we shot film we had
about<00:06:03.420> a<00:06:03.480> five<00:06:03.780> stop<00:06:04.140> range<00:06:04.500> and<00:06:04.860> if<00:06:05.850> you

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:06.390 
about a five stop range and if you

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:07.910 
about a five stop range and if you
couldn't<00:06:06.690> fit<00:06:06.870> your<00:06:07.050> photograph<00:06:07.470> into<00:06:07.680> five

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:07.920 
couldn't fit your photograph into five

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:09.470 
couldn't fit your photograph into five
stops<00:06:08.250> you<00:06:08.730> were<00:06:08.850> going<00:06:08.970> to<00:06:09.030> lose<00:06:09.240> either

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:09.480 
stops you were going to lose either

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:13.040 
stops you were going to lose either
highlights<00:06:10.050> or<00:06:10.710> shadows<00:06:10.910> in<00:06:11.910> this<00:06:12.420> particular

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:13.050 
highlights or shadows in this particular

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:15.800 
highlights or shadows in this particular
scene<00:06:13.350> we're<00:06:13.740> looking<00:06:14.100> at<00:06:14.220> windows<00:06:14.880> where<00:06:15.690> the

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:15.810 
scene we're looking at windows where the

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:18.470 
scene we're looking at windows where the
light<00:06:15.990> is<00:06:16.070> lighting<00:06:17.070> the<00:06:17.310> trees<00:06:17.610> outside<00:06:18.120> and

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:18.480 
light is lighting the trees outside and

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:21.830 
light is lighting the trees outside and
yet<00:06:19.260> we<00:06:19.410> have<00:06:19.620> very<00:06:20.160> dark<00:06:20.430> walls<00:06:20.820> inside<00:06:21.450> and

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:21.840 
yet we have very dark walls inside and

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:24.890 
yet we have very dark walls inside and
we<00:06:22.380> have<00:06:22.560> dark<00:06:22.860> pews<00:06:23.370> and<00:06:23.640> yet<00:06:24.360> there's<00:06:24.600> light

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:24.900 
we have dark pews and yet there's light

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:26.600 
we have dark pews and yet there's light
coming<00:06:25.650> through<00:06:25.680> the<00:06:25.920> window<00:06:26.220> hitting<00:06:26.430> the

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:26.610 
coming through the window hitting the

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:29.090 
coming through the window hitting the
tops<00:06:26.880> of<00:06:27.060> the<00:06:27.180> pews<00:06:27.480> now<00:06:27.690> the<00:06:28.260> goal<00:06:28.500> here<00:06:28.530> is<00:06:29.070> to

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:29.100 
tops of the pews now the goal here is to

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:31.910 
tops of the pews now the goal here is to
make<00:06:29.370> a<00:06:29.400> photograph<00:06:29.910> where<00:06:30.210> you<00:06:31.050> can<00:06:31.290> see<00:06:31.560> some

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:31.920 
make a photograph where you can see some

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:35.810 
make a photograph where you can see some
detail<00:06:32.430> in<00:06:32.730> the<00:06:32.970> pews<00:06:33.300> and<00:06:34.130> still<00:06:35.130> have<00:06:35.370> detail

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:35.820 
detail in the pews and still have detail

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:37.790 
detail in the pews and still have detail
out<00:06:36.060> those<00:06:36.360> windows<00:06:36.780> like<00:06:37.140> I<00:06:37.290> say<00:06:37.470> that<00:06:37.650> would

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:37.800 
out those windows like I say that would

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:39.300 
out those windows like I say that would
have<00:06:37.890> been<00:06:38.010> impossible<00:06:38.310> in<00:06:38.730> the<00:06:38.850> past

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:39.310 
have been impossible in the past

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:42.480 
have been impossible in the past
what<00:06:40.120> I'm<00:06:40.270> going<00:06:40.420> to<00:06:40.480> do<00:06:40.720> is<00:06:40.990> shoot<00:06:41.260> a<00:06:41.560> non-stop

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:42.490 
what I'm going to do is shoot a non-stop

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:47.940 
what I'm going to do is shoot a non-stop
bracket<00:06:43.890> with<00:06:44.890> HDR<00:06:45.430> and<00:06:46.530> we're<00:06:47.530> going<00:06:47.680> to<00:06:47.710> get

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:47.950 
bracket with HDR and we're going to get

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:50.760 
bracket with HDR and we're going to get
a<00:06:48.100> shot<00:06:48.370> after<00:06:49.090> we<00:06:49.210> process<00:06:49.480> it<00:06:49.930> that<00:06:50.140> has<00:06:50.380> all

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:50.770 
a shot after we process it that has all

00:06:50.770 --> 00:07:04.440 
a shot after we process it that has all
the<00:06:50.950> detailed<00:06:51.340> information<00:07:02.970> you<00:07:03.970> notice<00:07:04.300> that

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:04.450 
the detailed information you notice that

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:06.210 
the detailed information you notice that
the<00:07:04.600> exposures<00:07:05.140> were<00:07:05.260> getting<00:07:05.530> longer<00:07:05.860> and

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:06.220 
the exposures were getting longer and

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:09.750 
the exposures were getting longer and
that's<00:07:06.970> because<00:07:07.450> we're<00:07:08.380> getting<00:07:08.530> more<00:07:09.520> and

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:09.760 
that's because we're getting more and

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:11.760 
that's because we're getting more and
more<00:07:09.820> shadow<00:07:10.330> detail<00:07:10.870> these<00:07:11.110> longest

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:11.770 
more shadow detail these longest

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:14.280 
more shadow detail these longest
exposures<00:07:12.370> will<00:07:13.060> allow<00:07:13.300> us<00:07:13.510> to<00:07:13.540> show<00:07:13.840> detail

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:14.290 
exposures will allow us to show detail

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:16.860 
exposures will allow us to show detail
in<00:07:14.590> the<00:07:15.130> pews<00:07:15.520> in<00:07:15.550> areas<00:07:16.270> that<00:07:16.450> you<00:07:16.540> couldn't

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:16.870 
in the pews in areas that you couldn't

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:19.440 
in the pews in areas that you couldn't
see<00:07:17.050> now<00:07:17.470> in<00:07:17.650> those<00:07:17.830> shots<00:07:18.100> the<00:07:18.790> windows<00:07:19.210> are

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:19.450 
see now in those shots the windows are

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:21.900 
see now in those shots the windows are
actually<00:07:19.870> blinking<00:07:20.500> black<00:07:20.770> on<00:07:21.100> the<00:07:21.550> highlight

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:21.910 
actually blinking black on the highlight

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:23.880 
actually blinking black on the highlight
indicator<00:07:22.330> on<00:07:22.510> the<00:07:22.540> camera<00:07:22.960> which<00:07:23.440> is<00:07:23.650> telling

00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:23.890 
indicator on the camera which is telling

00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:25.980 
indicator on the camera which is telling
us<00:07:24.160> there's<00:07:24.640> no<00:07:24.850> detail<00:07:25.270> at<00:07:25.450> all<00:07:25.570> in<00:07:25.870> the

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:25.990 
us there's no detail at all in the

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:28.200
