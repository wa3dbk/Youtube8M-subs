a sorority or watch the bar to make this

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.130 
a sorority or watch the bar to make this
cut<00:00:04.890> out<00:00:04.980> to<00:00:05.130> the<00:00:05.220> side<00:00:05.839> usually<00:00:06.839> when<00:00:06.990> you

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
cut out to the side usually when you

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.470 
cut out to the side usually when you
would<00:00:07.589> do<00:00:07.740> that<00:00:07.770> you<00:00:08.069> get<00:00:08.220> the<00:00:08.429> a<00:00:08.940> button<00:00:09.300> on

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
would do that you get the a button on

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.230 
would do that you get the a button on
the<00:00:09.570> xbox<00:00:09.960> controller<00:00:10.410> or<00:00:11.070> the<00:00:11.190> X<00:00:11.550> button<00:00:11.639> on

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
the xbox controller or the X button on

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.720 
the xbox controller or the X button on
the<00:00:12.420> ps3<00:00:12.660> it<00:00:13.440> would<00:00:13.559> just<00:00:13.679> be<00:00:13.860> like<00:00:13.889> a<00:00:14.009> wide

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
the ps3 it would just be like a wide

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.580 
the ps3 it would just be like a wide
swing<00:00:15.089> but<00:00:15.240> you<00:00:15.360> have<00:00:15.509> no<00:00:15.719> skating<00:00:16.109> movement

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
swing but you have no skating movement

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.029 
swing but you have no skating movement
watch<00:00:16.710> the<00:00:16.949> bards<00:00:17.220> feet<00:00:18.619> you<00:00:19.619> can<00:00:19.770> see<00:00:19.949> him

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
watch the bards feet you can see him

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.790 
watch the bards feet you can see him
skating<00:00:20.340> and<00:00:20.550> making<00:00:20.820> those<00:00:20.939> moves<00:00:21.320> as<00:00:22.320> it

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
skating and making those moves as it

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.160 
skating and making those moves as it
would<00:00:22.949> be<00:00:22.980> in<00:00:23.189> real<00:00:23.369> life<00:00:23.580> so<00:00:23.990> that's<00:00:24.990> another

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
would be in real life so that's another

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.390 
would be in real life so that's another
thing<00:00:25.410> with<00:00:25.560> the<00:00:25.650> physics<00:00:26.010> that<00:00:26.189> they've

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
thing with the physics that they've

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.880 
thing with the physics that they've
added<00:00:26.760> when<00:00:27.029> you're<00:00:27.150> making<00:00:27.420> those<00:00:27.539> uh<00:00:27.890> wide

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
added when you're making those uh wide

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.630 
added when you're making those uh wide
cuts<00:00:29.250> of<00:00:29.429> the<00:00:29.519> park

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.549

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:41.180 
watch out you know how far headman goes

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:42.550 
watch out you know how far headman goes
after<00:00:41.480> the<00:00:41.600> hit<00:00:41.750> but<00:00:41.900> something<00:00:42.230> you'd<00:00:42.350> see<00:00:42.530> in

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:42.560

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:05.940 
realistic gameplay Thomas Vanek knows

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.080 
realistic gameplay Thomas Vanek knows
the<00:01:06.300> AI<00:01:06.450> here<00:01:07.080> grow<00:01:07.650> a<00:01:07.680> I<00:01:07.830> he<00:01:08.460> knows<00:01:08.700> dumped

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
again the physics engine you're going to

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.380 
again the physics engine you're going to
get<00:01:49.920> a<00:01:49.979> like<00:01:50.250> it<00:01:50.399> says<00:01:50.610> in<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.820> trail<00:01:51.090> if<00:01:51.240> there

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
get a like it says in the trail if there

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.090 
get a like it says in the trail if there
is<00:01:51.510> a<00:01:51.540> wild<00:01:51.900> moment<00:01:52.049> every<00:01:52.500> time<00:01:52.680> you<00:01:52.920> go<00:01:53.040> to

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
is a wild moment every time you go to

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.250 
is a wild moment every time you go to

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:54.260 
hit something that's a different

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:58.899 
hit something that's a different
animation<00:01:55.260> every<00:01:55.770> time<00:01:55.979> so<00:01:57.320> that's<00:01:58.320> that

00:01:58.899 --> 00:01:58.909 
animation every time so that's that

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:11.320 
animation every time so that's that
here's<00:01:59.909> a<00:02:00.000> meal<00:02:00.180> I'm<00:02:00.270> lucci<00:02:00.600> chicas

see how the physics is really improved

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:25.559 
see how the physics is really improved
I'll<00:05:23.830> be<00:05:23.919> back<00:05:24.100> with<00:05:24.250> more

00:05:25.559 --> 00:05:25.569 
I'll be back with more

00:05:25.569 --> 00:05:27.820 
I'll be back with more
okay<00:05:26.569> back<00:05:26.780> with<00:05:26.930> more<00:05:27.110> action<00:05:27.289> you<00:05:27.530> guys<00:05:27.680> we

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:27.830 
okay back with more action you guys we

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:30.140 
okay back with more action you guys we
got

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:30.150 

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:32.750 

Raffi<00:05:30.990> Torres<00:05:31.020> and<00:05:31.530> Zdeno<00:05:31.770> Chara<00:05:31.830> here<00:05:32.460> doors

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:32.760 
Raffi Torres and Zdeno Chara here doors

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:34.340 
Raffi Torres and Zdeno Chara here doors
is<00:05:32.940> going<00:05:33.060> to<00:05:33.120> get<00:05:33.210> the<00:05:33.360> puck<00:05:33.540> going<00:05:33.960> into<00:05:34.200> the

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:34.350 
is going to get the puck going into the

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:36.410 
is going to get the puck going into the
attacking<00:05:35.010> zone<00:05:35.220> here's<00:05:35.610> char<00:05:35.910> gonna<00:05:36.180> size

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:36.420 
attacking zone here's char gonna size

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:40.520 
attacking zone here's char gonna size
them<00:05:36.660> up<00:05:36.750> here<00:05:37.110> and<00:05:38.360> boom<00:05:39.360> tours<00:05:40.140> just<00:05:40.410> get

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:40.530 
them up here and boom tours just get

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:42.170 
them up here and boom tours just get
smashed<00:05:40.860> into<00:05:41.040> the<00:05:41.100> boards<00:05:41.460> and<00:05:41.610> knocked<00:05:41.760> over

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:42.180 
smashed into the boards and knocked over

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:47.000 
smashed into the boards and knocked over
so<00:05:43.110> while<00:05:43.500> here's<00:05:43.740> an<00:05:43.860> and<00:05:44.640> normal<00:05:45.000> speed<00:05:46.010> see

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:47.010 
so while here's an and normal speed see

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:51.940 
so while here's an and normal speed see
that<00:05:47.190> again

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:51.950 

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:54.880 

so<00:05:52.550> yeah<00:05:52.700> the<00:05:52.820> physics<00:05:53.240> is<00:05:53.510> great<00:05:54.380> another

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:54.890 
so yeah the physics is great another

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:57.010 
so yeah the physics is great another
thing<00:05:55.160> I<00:05:55.250> want<00:05:55.490> to<00:05:55.610> notice<00:05:55.940> to<00:05:56.390> show<00:05:56.750> you<00:05:56.810> guys

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:57.020 
thing I want to notice to show you guys

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:59.170 
thing I want to notice to show you guys
is<00:05:57.350> the<00:05:57.680> skating<00:05:58.130> is<00:05:58.310> also<00:05:58.610> different<00:05:58.790> as<00:05:58.970> well

00:05:59.170 --> 00:05:59.180 
is the skating is also different as well

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:03.580 
is the skating is also different as well
watch<00:06:01.210> Nathan<00:06:02.210> Horton<00:06:02.510> here<00:06:02.780> is<00:06:03.200> he<00:06:03.380> makes

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:03.590 
watch Nathan Horton here is he makes

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:06.940 
watch Nathan Horton here is he makes
this<00:06:03.740> wide<00:06:04.040> swing<00:06:04.780> that's<00:06:05.780> also<00:06:06.170> realistic<00:06:06.560> is

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:06.950 
this wide swing that's also realistic is

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:08.650 
this wide swing that's also realistic is
he<00:06:07.160> makes<00:06:07.550> that<00:06:07.700> swing<00:06:08.030> and<00:06:08.150> it's<00:06:08.330> going<00:06:08.600> to

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:08.660 
he makes that swing and it's going to

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:11.800 
he makes that swing and it's going to
move<00:06:09.530> over<00:06:09.650> this<00:06:09.890> player<00:06:10.160> here<00:06:10.490> that<00:06:11.300> wasn't

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:11.810 
move over this player here that wasn't

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:13.480 
move over this player here that wasn't
an<00:06:11.870> NHL<00:06:12.320> 10<00:06:12.500> I<00:06:12.560> mean<00:06:12.890> he's<00:06:13.010> just<00:06:13.040> going<00:06:13.220> to<00:06:13.280> come

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:13.490 
an NHL 10 I mean he's just going to come

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:15.760 
an NHL 10 I mean he's just going to come
in<00:06:13.520> make<00:06:14.000> this<00:06:14.150> wide<00:06:14.390> swing<00:06:14.750> gets<00:06:15.200> the<00:06:15.440> cuts

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:15.770 
in make this wide swing gets the cuts

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:17.170 
in make this wide swing gets the cuts
the<00:06:15.890> corner<00:06:16.220> here<00:06:16.250> with<00:06:16.580> this<00:06:16.670> player<00:06:16.910> and

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:17.180 
the corner here with this player and

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:19.180 
the corner here with this player and
he's<00:06:17.270> back<00:06:17.450> on<00:06:17.600> his<00:06:17.660> route<00:06:17.960> so<00:06:18.620> the<00:06:18.740> skating

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:19.190 
he's back on his route so the skating

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:21.820 
he's back on his route so the skating
physics<00:06:19.580> has<00:06:19.670> also<00:06:19.910> changed<00:06:20.330> as<00:06:20.630> well<00:06:20.830> all

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:21.830 
physics has also changed as well all

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:25.600 
physics has also changed as well all
right<00:06:22.040> i'll<00:06:22.370> be<00:06:22.490> back<00:06:22.610> with<00:06:22.820> more<00:06:23.030> I'm<00:06:23.240> out<00:06:24.610> ok

parts here and not keep in mind them
preciate<00:06:32.120> it<00:06:32.150> might<00:06:32.540> be<00:06:32.660> a<00:06:32.690> GMO<00:06:33.050> we've<00:06:33.200> got

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:33.350 
preciate it might be a GMO we've got

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:35.260 
preciate it might be a GMO we've got
Johnny<00:06:33.590> Boychuk<00:06:34.160> over<00:06:34.460> here<00:06:34.610> on<00:06:34.700> this<00:06:34.820> end<00:06:35.060> and

Johnny Boychuk over here on this end and

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:37.060 
Johnny Boychuk over here on this end and
scott<00:06:35.990> parks<00:06:36.290> is<00:06:36.380> trying<00:06:36.590> to<00:06:36.650> carry<00:06:36.800> the<00:06:36.920> puck

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:37.070 
scott parks is trying to carry the puck

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:40.030 
scott parks is trying to carry the puck
out<00:06:37.220> of<00:06:37.400> his<00:06:37.610> own<00:06:37.820> blue<00:06:38.150> line<00:06:38.450> or<00:06:39.440> defensive

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:40.040 
out of his own blue line or defensive

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:41.710 
out of his own blue line or defensive
zone<00:06:40.070> across<00:06:40.790> the<00:06:41.000> red<00:06:41.150> line<00:06:41.330> and<00:06:41.360> you<00:06:41.570> got

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:41.720 
zone across the red line and you got

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:43.750 
zone across the red line and you got
Johnny<00:06:41.930> Boychuk<00:06:42.410> he's<00:06:42.620> gonna<00:06:42.770> shore<00:06:43.340> up<00:06:43.490> here

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:43.760 
Johnny Boychuk he's gonna shore up here

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:45.700 
Johnny Boychuk he's gonna shore up here
he's<00:06:44.330> I'm<00:06:44.480> just<00:06:44.600> gonna<00:06:44.720> nail<00:06:45.050> Scott<00:06:45.470> Paul

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:45.710 
he's I'm just gonna nail Scott Paul

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:47.740 
he's I'm just gonna nail Scott Paul
she's<00:06:45.890> gonna<00:06:46.010> stiff<00:06:46.310> arm<00:06:46.580> him<00:06:46.730> and<00:06:47.270> then<00:06:47.360> Lucic

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:47.750 
she's gonna stiff arm him and then Lucic

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:50.890 
she's gonna stiff arm him and then Lucic
takes<00:06:48.020> the<00:06:48.140> puck<00:06:48.320> so<00:06:49.360> that's<00:06:50.360> also<00:06:50.630> something

00:06:50.890 --> 00:06:50.900 
takes the puck so that's also something

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:53.020 
takes the puck so that's also something
else<00:06:51.170> you<00:06:51.410> didn't<00:06:51.650> see<00:06:51.740> any<00:06:51.920> chilton<00:06:52.400> it<00:06:52.850> was

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:53.030 
else you didn't see any chilton it was

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:55.900 
else you didn't see any chilton it was
in<00:06:53.240> real<00:06:53.630> time<00:06:54.130> he<00:06:55.130> just<00:06:55.310> gets<00:06:55.520> knocked<00:06:55.670> up

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:55.910 
in real time he just gets knocked up

00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:59.080 
in real time he just gets knocked up
like<00:06:56.240> that

00:06:59.080 --> 00:06:59.090 

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:02.740 

so<00:06:59.660> that's<00:06:59.840> more<00:07:00.080> of<00:07:00.139> the<00:07:00.199> physics<00:07:00.530> of<00:07:00.590> law
