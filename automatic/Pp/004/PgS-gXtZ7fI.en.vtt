00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:07.319
 Hello dear friends with you 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.410
 dragons 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.240
 today i will show you how to do 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:15.210
 crab crab bomber for his 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:19.289
 buildings you will need 100 8 blocks 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.970
 ordinary forty five blocks with helium 8 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.060
 prism 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:26.970
 18 trasters was one and two tractors l3 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.279
 well of course gun pilots debaucher Josh 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:37.500
 let's start to build a rectangle 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:42.290
 3 by 6 then take from the middle to 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.290
 square on each side 2 by 2 on 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:52.980
 corner lips that is from them to the right and 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:57.000
 left move the hair in three blocks bottom 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.390
 our robot is ready now let's start 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.440
 do 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:05.100
 the main part of our platform first 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:07.070
 construct a rectangle in this place 2 on 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.590
 3 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:13.159
 we will make constructions from it 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.159
 laps 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:30.860
 after which from each side to the right and 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:38.610
 to the left again let's take the lane now 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:40.020
 connect them further set with each 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:45.780
 parties in these places 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:46.680
 two more now from the corners of the resulting 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:52.220
 constructions 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:52.220
 leading four more blocks 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:04.800
 back doing exactly now 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:08.700
 finish making our frame so we 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:12.560
 made a score frame and put faith they 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.560
 will be fastened inside the structure 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:19.890
 we will continue to do the top of our robot 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:23.250
 first install the wing then it will 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:26.630
 sit in the center of the design and leather 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.630
 milk end helium 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:34.320
 Now we will add our frame with blocks 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:37.280
 first put the gel in front and behind 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.280
 5 blocks 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:45.180
 now the boards of our robot 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:57.420
 do as follows as shown in 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:03:00.540
 screen so the boards of our robot are ready 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.700
 now install the engine first 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:07.980
 install those that will push us 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:15.750
 doing different parts of another country 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:17.370
 all the same now install 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:21.060
 engine which will be only one 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:23.940
 death set them in front and behind 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:26.630
 along the center of the structure and along the edges 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.630
 way 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:36.520
 left to attach the engine which 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:40.960
 push us forward and paste in this 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:46.600
 The place washed down now three dog our 

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:48.880
 radar and how about live blocks with gel itself 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:51.790
 flying design ready left 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:55.150
 attach weapons what weapon will 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:58.540
 enjoy you it is already your choice for 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:00.520
 start i will show you a plasma gun with 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:03.480
 recent update became available 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:07.600
 installation of guns from below 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:09.340
 yes only from below 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:12.420
 put the most powerful gun 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:15.700
 but you can bet in your manners and 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:16.450
 above 2 weaker legs that fell 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:19.150
 opportunity 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:31.540
 fend off other flying robots 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:33.910
 the city will test them immediately say he 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:36.130
 gaining height very slowly and 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:39.870
 coming down too so it attaches 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:39.870
 some stability to our robot 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:44.680
 and here we see and then we try 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.680
 to shoot 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:54.000
 hover i shoot 

00:04:59.569 --> 00:05:03.129
 like a few more 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:10.520
 as you see we descend very 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:11.180
 slowly so it gives time 

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:14.030
 take aim 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:17.259
 it can also be controlled with ribbons 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:17.259
 on a few meters 

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:29.620
 if that face come on 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:40.980
 try one more 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:40.980
 and hang 

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:53.630
 he even knew how let's go away functions 

00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:56.110
 bomber i showed now i 

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:59.110
 show you the functions of the flying platform 

00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:02.180
 because I'm more used to using 

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:05.300
 lasers are best positioned so that 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:08.110
 they could shoot both over themselves and 

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:14.540
 entry itself therefore have them 

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:17.030
 the uneven fingers of the leaf gave 

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:19.910
 bomber you can take off on not 

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:22.130
 certain height and shoot with it on 

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:24.710
 robots that drives the earth with us 

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:27.920
 the laser doesn't work that way and they have 

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:28.520
 limited range when on you 

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:31.820
 worth 

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:34.610
 plasma you have to be afraid of flying 

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:38.870
 same as you and when you have 

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:41.110
 the laser and you have to be afraid of landmarks can 

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:41.110
 to give 

00:06:56.710 --> 00:07:03.390
 we see that our design 

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:03.390
 here it is also possible 

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:08.090
 neither will it crumble from one 

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:12.500
 hits 

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:12.500
 water crumbles 

00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:20.430
 what do you all very much was that Pasha 

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:21.810
 looked at all thanks at all see 

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:24.000
 me 

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:26.900
 put likes subscribe all good luck 

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.900
 bye everyone
