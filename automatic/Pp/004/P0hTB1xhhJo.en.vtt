with<00:02:17.079> the<00:02:17.200> ear<00:02:17.379> infection<00:02:17.530> or<00:02:17.890> an<00:02:18.010> eye

00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:18.129 
with the ear infection or an eye

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:19.710 
with the ear infection or an eye
infection<00:02:18.340> that's<00:02:18.760> going<00:02:18.909> to<00:02:18.970> require<00:02:19.120> drops

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
that's a little uncomfortable then the

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.979 
that's a little uncomfortable then the
dog<00:02:21.549> will<00:02:21.730> develop<00:02:22.030> a<00:02:22.090> negative<00:02:22.420> association

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
dog will develop a negative association

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:24.679 
dog will develop a negative association
with<00:02:23.110> it<00:02:23.230> so<00:02:23.349> this<00:02:23.470> is<00:02:23.620> something<00:02:23.920> that's<00:02:24.069> just

00:02:24.679 --> 00:02:24.689 
with it so this is something that's just

00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:27.179 
with it so this is something that's just
something<00:02:25.689> the<00:02:25.780> dog<00:02:25.959> does<00:02:26.230> and<00:02:26.470> they<00:02:27.010> don't

00:02:27.179 --> 00:02:27.189 
something the dog does and they don't

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:28.979 
something the dog does and they don't
think<00:02:27.370> twice<00:02:27.489> about<00:02:27.610> it<00:02:27.970> and<00:02:28.180> that<00:02:28.599> is<00:02:28.810> how<00:02:28.840> you

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:28.989 
think twice about it and that is how you

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:30.839 
think twice about it and that is how you
would<00:02:29.200> care<00:02:29.439> through<00:02:29.950> your<00:02:30.099> dog's<00:02:30.280> eyes<00:02:30.609> and

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:30.849 
would care through your dog's eyes and

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:33.000 
would care through your dog's eyes and
ears
