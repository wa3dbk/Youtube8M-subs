never<00:00:12.079> heard<00:00:12.259> of<00:00:12.349> motion<00:00:12.650> computing<00:00:13.039> before

00:00:13.149 --> 00:00:13.159 
never heard of motion computing before

00:00:13.159 --> 00:00:14.680 
never heard of motion computing before
and<00:00:13.639> they're<00:00:13.969> always<00:00:14.089> looking<00:00:14.419> to<00:00:14.509> buy<00:00:14.659> a

let me tell you a little bit about

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.320 
let me tell you a little bit about
motion<00:00:21.110> computing<00:00:21.770> first<00:00:22.070> of<00:00:22.280> all<00:00:22.430> all<00:00:22.970> they

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:23.330 
motion computing first of all all they

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.140 
motion computing first of all all they
do<00:00:23.390> is<00:00:23.690> build<00:00:23.870> tablet<00:00:24.320> PCs<00:00:24.770> that's<00:00:25.280> it<00:00:25.670> they

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:26.150 
do is build tablet PCs that's it they

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.120 
do is build tablet PCs that's it they
don't<00:00:26.300> build<00:00:26.390> anything<00:00:26.840> else<00:00:27.020> Toshiba<00:00:27.710> HP<00:00:28.100> a

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:28.130 
don't build anything else Toshiba HP a

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:31.670 
build so many different products they

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:33.130 
build so many different products they
concentrate<00:00:32.210> on<00:00:32.329> so<00:00:32.509> many<00:00:32.599> different<00:00:33.020> things

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:33.140 
concentrate on so many different things

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.340 
concentrate on so many different things
all<00:00:33.470> motion<00:00:33.890> concentrates<00:00:34.430> on<00:00:34.610> is<00:00:35.000> tablet<00:00:35.750> PCs

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:36.350 
all motion concentrates on is tablet PCs

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.550 
all motion concentrates on is tablet PCs
that's<00:00:36.800> it<00:00:37.100> and<00:00:37.760> you<00:00:38.300> know<00:00:38.420> what<00:00:38.630> I've<00:00:38.900> been<00:00:39.440> to

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:39.560 
that's it and you know what I've been to

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.260 
that's it and you know what I've been to
Austin<00:00:39.920> Texas<00:00:40.070> where<00:00:40.400> motion<00:00:40.730> computing<00:00:41.150> is

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:41.270 
Austin Texas where motion computing is

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.050 
Austin Texas where motion computing is
located<00:00:41.750> I<00:00:41.930> don't<00:00:42.620> have<00:00:42.710> to<00:00:42.829> tell<00:00:43.010> you<00:00:43.160> I<00:00:43.340> saw<00:00:44.030> a

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:44.060 
located I don't have to tell you I saw a

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:45.639 
located I don't have to tell you I saw a
room<00:00:44.329> with<00:00:44.540> a<00:00:44.570> lot<00:00:44.750> of<00:00:44.780> engineers<00:00:45.290> sitting<00:00:45.500> in

00:00:45.639 --> 00:00:45.649 
room with a lot of engineers sitting in

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:48.490 
room with a lot of engineers sitting in
there<00:00:45.829> and<00:00:45.980> I<00:00:46.630> didn't<00:00:47.630> see<00:00:47.750> the<00:00:47.870> door<00:00:48.140> open

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:48.500 
there and I didn't see the door open

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.229 
there and I didn't see the door open
though<00:00:48.649> so<00:00:48.950> I'm<00:00:49.190> assuming<00:00:49.550> that<00:00:49.760> what<00:00:50.030> they<00:00:50.180> do

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:50.239 
though so I'm assuming that what they do

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:52.720 
though so I'm assuming that what they do
is<00:00:50.600> these<00:00:51.050> guys<00:00:51.230> don't<00:00:51.500> eat<00:00:51.829> unless<00:00:52.220> they<00:00:52.399> feed

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:52.730 
is these guys don't eat unless they feed

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:54.520 
is these guys don't eat unless they feed
them<00:00:52.880> so<00:00:53.420> they<00:00:53.540> stay<00:00:53.600> in<00:00:53.809> this<00:00:53.930> room<00:00:54.110> all<00:00:54.380> the

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530 
them so they stay in this room all the

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:54.760 
them so they stay in this room all the
time

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:54.770 
time

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:56.260 
time
I<00:00:54.980> think<00:00:55.220> they<00:00:55.309> slide<00:00:55.579> pizzas<00:00:55.940> under<00:00:56.059> the<00:00:56.180> door

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:56.270 
I think they slide pizzas under the door

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:58.060 
I think they slide pizzas under the door
and<00:00:56.630> that's<00:00:57.140> all<00:00:57.290> these<00:00:57.410> guys<00:00:57.620> eat<00:00:57.890> all

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070 
and that's all these guys eat all

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.069 
and that's all these guys eat all
they're<00:00:58.579> doing<00:00:58.880> is<00:00:59.030> working<00:00:59.239> on<00:00:59.480> how<00:00:59.750> to<00:00:59.809> make

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:00.079 
they're doing is working on how to make

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:02.380 
they're doing is working on how to make
this<00:01:00.260> particular<00:01:00.590> product<00:01:00.950> better<00:01:01.340> that's<00:01:02.000> it

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
this particular product better that's it

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:04.960 
this particular product better that's it
okay<00:01:03.110> so<00:01:03.890> let<00:01:04.070> me<00:01:04.129> show<00:01:04.309> you<00:01:04.370> a<00:01:04.460> little<00:01:04.670> a<00:01:04.729> few

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 
okay so let me show you a little a few

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:07.090 
okay so let me show you a little a few
features<00:01:05.390> about<00:01:05.630> this<00:01:05.810> tablet<00:01:05.990> PC<00:01:06.500> first<00:01:06.890> of

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
features about this tablet PC first of

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.760 
features about this tablet PC first of
all<00:01:07.450> it's<00:01:08.450> as<00:01:08.840> you<00:01:08.930> can<00:01:09.110> see<00:01:09.290> it's<00:01:09.470> really
