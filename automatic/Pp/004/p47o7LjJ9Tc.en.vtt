00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
or the top of the main so its first look

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.429 
or the top of the main so its first look
up<00:00:29.970> and<00:00:30.210> make<00:00:30.510> sure<00:00:30.720> that<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:31.050> higher<00:00:31.260> it

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:47.149 
make sure our boom bang is loose we also
want<00:01:44.250> to<00:01:44.369> release<00:01:44.640> our<00:01:44.850> mainsheet<00:01:45.979> so<00:01:46.979> that

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
want to release our mainsheet so that

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.460 
want to release our mainsheet so that
the<00:01:47.280> sail<00:01:47.490> can<00:01:47.729> orient<00:01:48.240> itself<00:01:48.750> into<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.259> wind

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
the sail can orient itself into the wind

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.139 
the sail can orient itself into the wind
that<00:01:49.710> will<00:01:49.829> make<00:01:49.979> bring<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:50.460> sail<00:01:50.640> up<00:01:50.850> a<00:01:50.970> lot

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
that will make bring the sail up a lot

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.630 
that will make bring the sail up a lot
easier<00:01:51.570> I<00:01:51.840> have<00:01:52.380> some<00:01:52.649> blue<00:01:52.860> straps<00:01:53.280> that<00:01:53.549> are

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
easier I have some blue straps that are

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.139 
easier I have some blue straps that are
holding<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:54.180> sail<00:01:54.659> on<00:01:54.899> to<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.320> boom<00:01:56.090> but<00:01:57.090> I'm

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
going to take these straps off and then

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.110
