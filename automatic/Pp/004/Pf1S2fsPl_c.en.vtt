see<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.649> align<00:00:47.280> goes<00:00:47.520> up<00:00:47.670> the<00:00:47.789> top<00:00:47.969> here<00:00:48.739> to

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
see the align goes up the top here to

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:50.930 
see the align goes up the top here to
the<00:00:49.829> hot<00:00:49.980> streak<00:00:50.219> where<00:00:50.399> it<00:00:50.520> actually<00:00:50.640> goes

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
the hot streak where it actually goes

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.869 
the hot streak where it actually goes
into<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.239> combustion<00:00:51.510> chamber<00:00:52.670> globe<00:00:53.670> plug

into the combustion chamber globe plug
connector<00:00:54.270> here<00:00:55.489> obviously<00:00:56.489> a<00:00:56.520> thermocouple

00:00:58.029 --> 00:00:58.039 
connector here obviously a thermocouple

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:03.950 
connector here obviously a thermocouple
we<00:00:59.039> have<00:00:59.160> a<00:00:59.190> power<00:00:59.430> supply<00:00:59.640> for<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:02.960> solenoid

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
we have a power supply for the solenoid

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.710 
we have a power supply for the solenoid
which<00:01:04.199> powers<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.619> hot<00:01:05.070> streak<00:01:05.369> after<00:01:06.330> burn<00:01:06.689> a

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
which powers the hot streak after burn a

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.280 
which powers the hot streak after burn a
fuel<00:01:07.020> tank<00:01:07.939> here<00:01:08.939> we<00:01:09.000> have<00:01:09.119> a<00:01:09.150> a<00:01:09.540> check<00:01:10.110> valve

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
fuel tank here we have a a check valve

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.440 
fuel tank here we have a a check valve
which<00:01:10.619> stops<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.010> burner<00:01:11.490> can<00:01:11.760> pressure<00:01:12.090> from

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
which stops the burner can pressure from

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.330 
which stops the burner can pressure from
forcing<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.140> fuel<00:01:13.350> back<00:01:13.530> down<00:01:13.710> into<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.070> tank

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
forcing the fuel back down into the tank

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.880 
forcing the fuel back down into the tank
and<00:01:15.270> just<00:01:15.930> over<00:01:16.140> here<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.470> nobody<00:01:16.710> you<00:01:16.740> can

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
and just over here the nobody you can

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.219 
and just over here the nobody you can
see<00:01:17.070> we<00:01:17.220> have<00:01:17.250> a<00:01:17.580> restrictor<00:01:18.299> which<00:01:18.659> limits

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
see we have a restrictor which limits

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.450 
see we have a restrictor which limits
the<00:01:19.380> amount<00:01:19.470> of<00:01:19.650> fuel<00:01:19.710> going<00:01:20.100> to<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.340> hot

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
the amount of fuel going to the hot

about<00:01:27.720> 30<00:01:28.200> seconds<00:01:28.710> ok<00:01:29.450> here<00:01:30.450> we<00:01:30.479> have<00:01:30.689> the

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
about 30 seconds ok here we have the

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.960 
about 30 seconds ok here we have the
afterburner<00:01:31.200> fuel<00:01:31.470> pump<00:01:31.770> I<00:01:32.070> found<00:01:32.729> at<00:01:32.820> the

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
afterburner fuel pump I found at the

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.330 
afterburner fuel pump I found at the
normal<00:01:33.570> size<00:01:34.009> fuel<00:01:35.009> pump<00:01:35.189> for<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:37.189> engine<00:01:38.189> is

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
normal size fuel pump for the engine is

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.399 
normal size fuel pump for the engine is
just<00:01:38.750> inadequate<00:01:39.750> it<00:01:39.840> just<00:01:40.020> didn't<00:01:40.259> have<00:01:40.380> the

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
just inadequate it just didn't have the

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.740 
just inadequate it just didn't have the
pressure<00:01:40.650> or<00:01:40.920> flow<00:01:41.420> here<00:01:42.420> we<00:01:42.479> have<00:01:42.600> the

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
pressure or flow here we have the

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.719 
pressure or flow here we have the
afterburner<00:01:43.229> supply<00:01:43.649> line<00:01:43.860> it's<00:01:44.549> a

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
afterburner supply line it's a

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.330 
afterburner supply line it's a
temperature<00:01:45.180> resistant<00:01:46.490> flexible<00:01:47.490> line

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
temperature resistant flexible line

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.190 
temperature resistant flexible line
this<00:01:50.179> is<00:01:50.329> where<00:01:50.420> the<00:01:50.509> fuel<00:01:50.719> actually<00:01:51.020> goes

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
this is where the fuel actually goes

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.819 
this is where the fuel actually goes
into<00:01:51.710> the<00:01:51.859> afterburner<00:01:52.369> ignored<00:01:52.909> a<00:01:53.000> ring<00:01:53.829> okay

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:54.829 
into the afterburner ignored a ring okay

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:56.139 
into the afterburner ignored a ring okay
and<00:01:54.979> so<00:01:55.100> we<00:01:55.159> have<00:01:55.280> a<00:01:55.310> look<00:01:55.460> down<00:01:55.609> its<00:01:55.789> backside

00:01:56.139 --> 00:01:56.149 
and so we have a look down its backside

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:59.620 
and so we have a look down its backside
here<00:01:56.590> very<00:01:57.590> poorly<00:01:57.920> lit<00:01:58.189> bit<00:01:58.399> and<00:01:59.000> see<00:01:59.299> a<00:01:59.329> flame
