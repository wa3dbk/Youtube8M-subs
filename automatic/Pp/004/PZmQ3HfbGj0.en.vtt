00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:05.229
 in this video we will continue to talk 

00:00:02.889 --> 00:00:08.560
 of the creation of roofs within 

00:00:05.229 --> 00:00:11.470
 revit in particular say of another 

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:12.820
 typology for the creation of roofs 

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:16.839
 in the previous video we saw 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:19.179
 in fact, how to create the roofs with this one 

00:00:16.839 --> 00:00:22.240
 then the perimeter type of roof 

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:26.609
 then drawing the perimeter precisely 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:30.009
 of a roof and then defining them we say 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.810
 flaps and inclinations 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:33.910
 in this video we will instead see the saying 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:38.230
 from exclusion that another typology 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:40.810
 precisely because the network roofs in this 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.790
 case while we first have 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:44.740
 excluding a perimeter that we have 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:47.920
 drawn by the plant 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:50.050
 so we practically drew 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.910
 this perimeter and then we extruded it 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.620
 this time the extrusion will take place a 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:57.310
 installation but in prospectus then 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:01:01.210
 we delete this roof and position us 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:03.400
 in the statement that we can say most can 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:06.159
 so in this case we can serve 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.920
 use the south elevation or the 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:12.270
 north elevation 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:16.570
 ok so we click inside 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:18.370
 this token we say of the del 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.460
 prospectus we find ourselves in 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:24.580
 south elevation 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:28.900
 let's check that our view is 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:30.909
 cropped ok is not cropped ea 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:33.490
 this point we draw the. directly 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:36.070
 our wall in profile what 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:39.670
 means that we must point to this 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:42.549
 case no longer to mark the perimeter of the 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:45.880
 wall but just like we see the wall of 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:47.619
 profile so let's create a 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:51.450
 floor 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:54.880
 but sorry said he said from extrusion 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.350
 and when he asks us for a plan of 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.740
 work 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:02.770
 let's say we can select 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:05.229
 just select a plan or 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.790
 select a line and use the plan of 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:09.009
 work on those this was designed 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:10.220
 but actually in this specific 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.530
 breaker 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.870
 we should use this option 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.210
 then select a plan 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.400
 ok and when he asks us to 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:22.070
 select a plan we make so of 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.080
 select a plan that we succeed in 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:26.570
 see frontally then in this 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:29.840
 in case I can use this side of the 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:33.440
 pillar or here I can move a 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:37.060
 little within this design e 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:39.680
 try to find in any 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:42.860
 let's say any face of a 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.270
 element that however is oriented in the 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.100
 right way then for example too 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:49.540
 this wall could be used 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:54.850
 but let's use this face 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:54.850
 precisely the pillar ok attention
