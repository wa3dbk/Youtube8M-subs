00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.570 
go and open another table let's do that

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.210 
go and open another table let's do that
here<00:01:46.060> it<00:01:47.060> will<00:01:47.270> just<00:01:47.510> open<00:01:47.659> up<00:01:48.110> another<00:01:48.290> panel

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220 
here it will just open up another panel

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.160 
here it will just open up another panel

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
fast it's just gonna go and

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.130 
fast it's just gonna go and
automatically<00:01:56.540> do<00:01:56.630> that<00:01:56.659> you<00:01:56.869> don't<00:01:57.020> even

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140
