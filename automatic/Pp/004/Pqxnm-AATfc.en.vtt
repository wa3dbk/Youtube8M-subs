track and of course use motion control

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.800 
track and of course use motion control
so<00:00:28.439> basically<00:00:28.920> accelerator<00:00:29.810> brake

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
so basically accelerator brake

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.510 
so basically accelerator brake
deceleration<00:00:31.619> and<00:00:31.740> basically<00:00:32.099> this<00:00:32.279> is<00:00:32.340> like

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
deceleration and basically this is like

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.680 
deceleration and basically this is like
an<00:00:32.610> ex<00:00:32.759> I<00:00:32.910> bike<00:00:33.180> type<00:00:33.570> game<00:00:34.460> so<00:00:35.460> you<00:00:36.450> can<00:00:36.570> see

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
an ex I bike type game so you can see

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.500 
an ex I bike type game so you can see
the<00:00:36.780> graphics<00:00:37.260> some<00:00:37.559> mall<00:00:38.550> this<00:00:38.850> is<00:00:39.180> probably

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
the graphics some mall this is probably

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.350 
the graphics some mall this is probably
game<00:00:39.690> that's<00:00:39.840> not<00:00:39.989> well<00:00:40.200> optimized<00:00:40.649> for<00:00:41.360> the

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
game that's not well optimized for the

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:48.560 
game that's not well optimized for the
system<00:00:44.000> but<00:00:45.000> it<00:00:45.840> does<00:00:46.050> play<00:00:46.289> well<00:00:47.090> no<00:00:48.090> main

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
system but it does play well no main

00:00:48.570 --> 00:01:03.319 
system but it does play well no main
issues

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.719 

so<00:01:03.929> you<00:01:04.019> can<00:01:04.140> see<00:01:04.290> that<00:01:04.439> that's<00:01:04.710> one<00:01:05.309> game<00:01:05.549> and

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
so you can see that that's one game and

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:11.510 
so you can see that that's one game and
switch<00:01:06.270> out<00:01:06.479> and<00:01:07.759> we're<00:01:08.759> going<00:01:08.909> to<00:01:08.970> try<00:01:10.520> the

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
switch out and we're going to try the

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.060 
switch out and we're going to try the
last<00:01:11.790> I<00:01:12.720> came<00:01:13.110> over<00:01:13.259> the<00:01:13.350> name<00:01:13.439> of<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.619> game<00:01:13.740> I

last I came over the name of the game I

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.100 
last I came over the name of the game I

can use the last offense I'm not

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.170 
can use the last offense I'm not
mistaken<00:01:18.830> this<00:01:19.830> is<00:01:19.890> just<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.340> live<00:01:20.700> version<00:01:20.909> I

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
mistaken this is just the live version I

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.560 
mistaken this is just the live version I
could<00:01:21.360> switch<00:01:21.539> to<00:01:21.750> English<00:01:22.020> of<00:01:22.140> course<00:01:23.570> don't

check that out see the games actually
looked<00:01:40.200> for<00:01:40.350> you<00:01:40.380> faster<00:01:40.860> with<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.009> ipad<00:01:41.459> 2

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:42.259 
looked for you faster with the ipad 2

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:45.529 
looked for you faster with the ipad 2
again<00:01:43.259> these<00:01:44.039> are<00:01:44.100> motion<00:01:44.459> control<00:01:44.940> based

00:01:45.529 --> 00:01:45.539 
again these are motion control based

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:58.880 
again these are motion control based
games<00:01:51.020> skips<00:01:52.020> role<00:01:52.259> that<00:01:52.440> basically<00:01:53.280> fire

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:30.020 

switch<00:01:59.890> guns

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.580 

so<00:02:31.030> you<00:02:31.120> get<00:02:31.270> the<00:02:31.360> general<00:02:31.540> idea<00:02:31.780> you<00:02:32.230> can<00:02:32.380> see

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
so you get the general idea you can see

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.380 
so you get the general idea you can see
how<00:02:32.709> everything<00:02:33.490> looks<00:02:33.520> like<00:02:33.940> of<00:02:34.180> course

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
how everything looks like of course

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.440 
how everything looks like of course
these<00:02:34.480> are<00:02:34.540> not<00:02:34.750> optimized<00:02:35.110> games<00:02:35.440> for<00:02:36.450> the

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
these are not optimized games for the

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.589 
these are not optimized games for the
ipad<00:02:37.870> but<00:02:38.170> it<00:02:38.319> just<00:02:38.500> worked<00:02:39.069> very<00:02:39.340> well<00:02:39.599> game

00:02:40.589 --> 00:02:40.599 
ipad but it just worked very well game

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:42.240 
ipad but it just worked very well game
runs<00:02:40.780> pretty<00:02:41.050> smoothly<00:02:41.410> so<00:02:41.739> with<00:02:41.890> jump<00:02:42.099> out<00:02:42.220> of

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
runs pretty smoothly so with jump out of

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.030 
runs pretty smoothly so with jump out of
their<00:02:42.720> jump<00:02:43.720> it's<00:02:43.840> a<00:02:43.900> gunner<00:02:44.170> which<00:02:44.860> were

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
their jump it's a gunner which were

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.309 
their jump it's a gunner which were
playing<00:02:45.310> before<00:02:45.660> it's<00:02:46.660> pretty<00:02:46.870> much<00:02:46.989> like<00:02:47.050> an

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:47.319 
playing before it's pretty much like an

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:49.860 
playing before it's pretty much like an
asteroid<00:02:47.770> game<00:02:48.069> I'm<00:02:48.520> one<00:02:49.090> nice<00:02:49.330> version<00:02:49.600> of

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
asteroid game I'm one nice version of

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.510 
asteroid game I'm one nice version of
asteroid<00:02:50.350> if<00:02:50.560> you<00:02:50.680> will<00:02:50.890> so<00:02:51.580> basically<00:02:51.970> I<00:02:52.090> can

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
asteroid if you will so basically I can

00:02:53.520 --> 00:03:12.780 
asteroid if you will so basically I can
as<00:02:54.520> you<00:02:54.760> can<00:02:54.880> see<00:02:55.120> here<00:03:11.310> I'm<00:03:12.310> just<00:03:12.459> been<00:03:12.640> the

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
as you can see here I'm just been the

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:24.150 
as you can see here I'm just been the
easiest<00:03:13.090> level<00:03:13.269> so<00:03:13.660> it's<00:03:13.810> pretty<00:03:13.959> easy<00:03:14.200> basic

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.250 

you<00:03:25.160> get<00:03:25.310> the<00:03:25.400> general<00:03:25.550> idea<00:03:25.790> and<00:03:26.390> you<00:03:26.959> can<00:03:27.110> see

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
you get the general idea and you can see

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.170 
you get the general idea and you can see
how<00:03:27.290> the<00:03:27.440> game<00:03:27.680> plays<00:03:27.709> looks<00:03:28.580> pretty<00:03:28.819> smooth

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
how the game plays looks pretty smooth

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:34.240 
how the game plays looks pretty smooth
very<00:03:29.540> crisp<00:03:31.840> pretty<00:03:32.840> clear<00:03:33.170> basic<00:03:33.830> functions

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
very crisp pretty clear basic functions
