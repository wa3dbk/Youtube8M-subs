00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 Now we make out a cat like that 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.600
 peri is five weeks old and what they 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.690
 not everything experienced in this 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.130
 Just live a good month 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.080
 they come from southeastern europe 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.839
 probably arrived in the middle of a 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.609
 scrap delivery so came perry to one 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.439
 disposal company to bergkamen 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.150
 There she was found and therefore gives 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.340
 it was there now, then no 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.289
 junkyard shepherd dog but peri 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:29.150
 a junk cat but not 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.150
 outside but very comfortable in the office 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:35.520
 allow clarification barely 800 grams 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.370
 and already pretty curious no 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:41.160
 Office supplies are safe and available before 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.700
 especially not the staff like Andreas 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.340
 haase 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.260
 she has one with five colleagues constantly 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.140
 Eye on the five weeks old cat 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.030
 Together they pull puree for the big one 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.620
 Progress is a gift because 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:59.280
 almost peri would not have survived at all 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:02.250
 but also with the colleagues and 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.830
 Colleagues and you experience that together 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.390
 actually nice too 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:09.270
 Actually, animals are at the disposal company yes 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.869
 not allowed but perry is one 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.869
 exception 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.729
 her way to bergkamen was piri 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:21.729
 one of these industry bags with scrap 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:23.710
 a delivery from southeastern Europe like 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:25.690
 always had the disposal experts 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.850
 the bags are unloaded with machines 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:29.050
 actually a miracle that she meow that 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:34.020
 ever heard 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:34.020
 but they heard it and looked 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:46.720
 they found two little cats which was 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:49.460
 the wanted warm jackets and a crate 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:52.070
 a colleague who also owns two dogs 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.690
 has and here is a resident one 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.810
 you could be vet immediately 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:02:00.790
 really started without thinking 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:02.930
 that we spontaneously and to the vet 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:03.620
 helped cats are first there 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.500
 remained 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:08.720
 the first day, both survived the 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:11.210
 spotted eating from the start well the 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.340
 others, however, not the strains 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:14.270
 The trip was probably too big for them 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.700
 did not survive 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.670
 the other one was bursting with energy and energy 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.440
 needed after her successful 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:24.190
 fight for survival a new home here 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.190
 in the office 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:28.889
 Mom said that we are actually beautiful 

00:02:26.249 --> 00:02:33.269
 what everyone does in turn so alternate 

00:02:28.889 --> 00:02:34.769
 then it is not as stressful are 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:37.069
 Of course, every night until two 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:39.359
 three hours had to get the bottle 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:42.209
 after three weeks around the clock 

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:43.769
 Care was a good night's sleep 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:51.480
 Yesterday she is flitting 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:53.669
 Curious about wheelchair with the game 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.230
 continue to hold in the beginning was already a 

00:02:53.669 --> 00:02:58.230
 a bit strange but meanwhile 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:00.659
 is already part of the office and hermann 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.090
 get used to it in any case the 

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:04.560
 boss even took over the 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.629
 vet bills as slow as 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.730
 piri no longer the full care of 

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:10.680
 Offices need to say goodbye 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:16.739
 because as said pets are 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:18.959
 actually not allowed one can 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:20.969
 do not forbid it and eventually it will 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:22.530
 then out of control so we too 

00:03:20.969 --> 00:03:24.469
 because of the company size there 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.230
 have to comply with certain rules and 

00:03:24.469 --> 00:03:29.670
 pets indeed exceptions 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:31.830
 allowed 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.770
 vampire is strong enough she has to 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:35.459
 Therefore, the small one gets accused 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:37.890
 survival artist for a couple 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:38.580
 have a private room for hours 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.890
 test 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:42.959
 next week will andreas h they are 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:50.060

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:50.060
 house cat super
