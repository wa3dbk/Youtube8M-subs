feel<00:02:21.460> is<00:02:21.640> this<00:02:29.700> as<00:02:30.700> you<00:02:30.940> can<00:02:31.120> see<00:02:31.300> here<00:02:31.840> I<00:02:31.870> have

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:31.990 
feel is this as you can see here I have

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:35.610 
feel is this as you can see here I have
a<00:02:32.230> swoosh<00:02:32.890> so<00:02:33.850> I'm<00:02:33.940> just<00:02:34.180> gonna<00:02:35.020> overlay<00:02:35.590> a

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
a swoosh so I'm just gonna overlay a

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.420 
a swoosh so I'm just gonna overlay a
huge<00:02:36.190> piece<00:02:36.700> of<00:02:36.910> tape<00:02:37.150> over<00:02:37.420> that<00:02:37.570> and<00:02:38.290> I<00:02:38.430> find

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
huge piece of tape over that and I find

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
huge piece of tape over that and I find
the<00:02:39.580> outline<00:02:40.320> and<00:02:41.320> then<00:02:42.250> just<00:02:42.640> start<00:02:42.940> trimming

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
the outline and then just start trimming

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.990 
the outline and then just start trimming
and<00:02:46.470> then<00:02:47.470> these<00:02:47.650> pieces<00:02:48.040> of<00:02:48.400> the<00:02:48.490> shoe<00:02:48.820> are

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
and then these pieces of the shoe are

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.420 
and then these pieces of the shoe are
pretty<00:02:49.330> well<00:02:49.540> defined<00:02:50.020> so<00:02:50.500> you<00:02:51.130> don't<00:02:51.280> really

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
pretty well defined so you don't really

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.990 
pretty well defined so you don't really
have<00:02:51.550> to<00:02:51.820> cut<00:02:52.120> too<00:02:52.390> deep<00:02:52.660> at<00:02:52.900> all<00:02:53.140> and<00:02:53.700> the<00:02:54.700> tape

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
have to cut too deep at all and the tape

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.440 
have to cut too deep at all and the tape
cuts<00:02:55.390> very<00:02:55.600> easily<00:02:55.960> so<00:02:56.290> you<00:02:56.380> just<00:02:57.090> barely<00:02:58.090> go

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
cuts very easily so you just barely go

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:04.170 
cuts very easily so you just barely go
over<00:02:58.750> it<00:02:59.460> cut<00:03:00.460> right<00:03:02.430> and<00:03:03.430> just<00:03:03.580> kind<00:03:03.790> of<00:03:03.880> fish

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
over it cut right and just kind of fish

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:08.130 
over it cut right and just kind of fish
the<00:03:04.530> the<00:03:05.530> pointed<00:03:06.130> edge<00:03:06.490> of<00:03:06.970> the<00:03:07.090> blade<00:03:07.390> up<00:03:07.750> and

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
the the pointed edge of the blade up and

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.390 
the the pointed edge of the blade up and
over<00:03:08.440> and<00:03:08.820> it'll<00:03:09.820> kind<00:03:10.060> of<00:03:10.500> pull<00:03:11.500> up<00:03:11.530> those<00:03:12.010> new

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
over and it'll kind of pull up those new

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:23.430 
over and it'll kind of pull up those new
pieces<00:03:20.430> and<00:03:21.430> now<00:03:22.090> as<00:03:22.330> you<00:03:22.480> can<00:03:22.660> see<00:03:22.720> I've<00:03:23.230> got

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
pieces and now as you can see I've got

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.310 
pieces and now as you can see I've got
one<00:03:23.500> of<00:03:23.860> the<00:03:24.040> major<00:03:24.820> parts<00:03:25.420> of<00:03:25.570> the<00:03:25.750> shoe<00:03:26.020> done

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:26.320 
one of the major parts of the shoe done

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.550 
one of the major parts of the shoe done
which<00:03:27.190> is<00:03:27.430> the<00:03:27.459> Nike<00:03:28.150> swoosh<00:03:28.660> one<00:03:29.170> of<00:03:29.260> the<00:03:29.350> most

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
which is the Nike swoosh one of the most

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.199 
which is the Nike swoosh one of the most
important<00:03:30.010> things<00:03:30.250> that<00:03:30.400> I<00:03:30.550> really<00:03:30.910> want<00:03:31.120> to

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
important things that I really want to

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:33.630 
important things that I really want to
protect<00:03:31.560> next<00:03:32.560> I'm<00:03:32.709> gonna<00:03:32.920> go<00:03:33.130> ahead<00:03:33.220> and<00:03:33.489> do

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:33.640 
protect next I'm gonna go ahead and do

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.920 
protect next I'm gonna go ahead and do
the<00:03:33.850> eye<00:03:33.880> stage<00:03:34.450> and<00:03:35.790> the<00:03:36.790> Nike<00:03:37.030> swoosh<00:03:37.510> on<00:03:37.810> the

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
the eye stage and the Nike swoosh on the

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.350 
the eye stage and the Nike swoosh on the
other<00:03:38.110> side<00:03:38.530> and<00:03:38.950> then<00:03:39.550> after<00:03:40.000> that<00:03:40.150> I'm

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:40.360 
other side and then after that I'm

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.620 
other side and then after that I'm
pretty<00:03:40.570> much<00:03:40.810> done<00:03:41.230> and<00:03:41.950> I'm<00:03:42.040> good<00:03:42.340> to<00:03:42.519> go

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
pretty much done and I'm good to go

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:45.240 
pretty much done and I'm good to go
because<00:03:43.630> the<00:03:43.780> midsole<00:03:44.200> is<00:03:44.260> black<00:03:44.739> I<00:03:44.950> really

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
because the midsole is black I really

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.130 
because the midsole is black I really
don't<00:03:45.430> have<00:03:45.459> anything<00:03:45.910> to<00:03:46.300> worry<00:03:46.540> about<00:03:46.630> as

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.140 
don't have anything to worry about as

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.920 
don't have anything to worry about as
well<00:03:48.040> because<00:03:48.489> soap<00:03:49.090> and<00:03:49.300> water<00:03:49.540> would<00:03:49.900> just

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
well because soap and water would just

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.540 
well because soap and water would just
get<00:03:50.860> off<00:03:51.040> that<00:03:51.310> a<00:03:51.660> residue<00:03:52.660> from<00:03:53.440> the<00:03:53.500> dock<00:03:54.010> as

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:54.550 
get off that a residue from the dock as

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:56.460 
get off that a residue from the dock as
you<00:03:54.790> can<00:03:54.940> see<00:03:55.150> I<00:03:55.180> now<00:03:55.510> have<00:03:55.540> the<00:03:55.870> whole<00:03:56.140> shoe

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.470 
you can see I now have the whole shoe

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:00.930 
you can see I now have the whole shoe
taped<00:03:56.830> up<00:03:57.100> the<00:03:57.480> swoosh<00:03:58.620> the<00:03:59.620> I<00:03:59.650> stays<00:04:00.220> and

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:00.940 
taped up the swoosh the I stays and

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.150 
taped up the swoosh the I stays and
around<00:04:01.420> on<00:04:01.630> to<00:04:01.840> the<00:04:01.930> other<00:04:02.110> side<00:04:02.470> I<00:04:02.830> have<00:04:02.980> the

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:03.160 
around on to the other side I have the

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.790 
around on to the other side I have the
same<00:04:03.430> thing<00:04:03.760> as<00:04:04.060> you<00:04:04.720> can<00:04:04.870> see<00:04:05.110> there<00:04:05.350> are<00:04:05.530> a

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:05.800 
same thing as you can see there are a

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.940 
same thing as you can see there are a
few<00:04:06.190> flaws<00:04:06.640> and<00:04:07.090> the<00:04:07.410> taping<00:04:08.410> that<00:04:08.620> I<00:04:08.680> have

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:08.950 
few flaws and the taping that I have

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:12.570 
few flaws and the taping that I have
done<00:04:09.310> as<00:04:09.940> far<00:04:10.269> as<00:04:10.300> cutting<00:04:10.750> goes<00:04:11.140> a<00:04:11.530> few<00:04:12.250> areas

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:12.580 
done as far as cutting goes a few areas

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:15.150 
done as far as cutting goes a few areas
are<00:04:13.030> open<00:04:13.209> but<00:04:13.780> I'm<00:04:13.930> not<00:04:14.110> really<00:04:14.350> too<00:04:14.680> worried

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:15.160 
are open but I'm not really too worried

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:19.140 
are open but I'm not really too worried
because<00:04:15.790> actually<00:04:16.419> applying<00:04:16.930> the<00:04:17.859> suede<00:04:18.489> is

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.150 
because actually applying the suede is

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:23.650 
because actually applying the suede is
just<00:04:19.479> like<00:04:19.810> painting<00:04:20.440> as<00:04:20.680> I<00:04:21.370> open<00:04:21.760> up<00:04:21.850> the<00:04:22.090> box

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:23.660 
just like painting as I open up the box

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:28.159 
just like painting as I open up the box
here<00:04:24.660> I<00:04:24.690> have<00:04:25.020> my<00:04:25.199> bottle<00:04:25.710> of<00:04:25.919> suede<00:04:26.789> dye<00:04:27.180> and<00:04:28.110> I

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:32.100 
also have this little swab on a metal

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.969 
also have this little swab on a metal
stick<00:04:32.370> a<00:04:32.639> better<00:04:32.940> rod<00:04:33.289> and<00:04:34.289> then<00:04:34.410> all<00:04:34.650> I<00:04:34.680> have

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:34.979 
stick a better rod and then all I have

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:37.370 
stick a better rod and then all I have
to<00:04:35.160> do<00:04:35.400> is<00:04:36.030> go<00:04:36.330> ahead<00:04:36.419> and<00:04:36.570> spread<00:04:37.020> out<00:04:37.199> my

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380 
to do is go ahead and spread out my

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:44.150 
to do is go ahead and spread out my
towels<00:04:37.970> my<00:04:38.970> rags<00:04:42.199> to<00:04:43.199> do<00:04:43.410> the<00:04:43.590> trick

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 
towels my rags to do the trick

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.270 
towels my rags to do the trick
not<00:04:44.310> too<00:04:44.550> much<00:04:44.789> and<00:04:45.479> it's<00:04:46.169> just<00:04:46.440> as<00:04:46.620> simple<00:04:47.070> as

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 
not too much and it's just as simple as

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:54.950 
not too much and it's just as simple as
painting<00:04:48.090> go<00:04:48.900> ahead<00:04:49.550> shake<00:04:50.550> it<00:04:50.729> up<00:04:53.840> open<00:04:54.840> the

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 
painting go ahead shake it up open the

00:04:54.960 --> 00:05:02.570 
painting go ahead shake it up open the
cap<00:04:58.820> go<00:04:59.820> ahead<00:05:00.090> and<00:05:00.360> dip<00:05:00.720> in<00:05:01.340> just<00:05:02.340> a<00:05:02.550> little

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 
cap go ahead and dip in just a little

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:07.400 
cap go ahead and dip in just a little
bit<00:05:04.220> too<00:05:05.220> much<00:05:05.400> because<00:05:05.940> this<00:05:06.150> does<00:05:07.110> get

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:07.410 
bit too much because this does get

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:12.080 
bit too much because this does get
