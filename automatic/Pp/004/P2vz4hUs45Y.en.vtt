it's perverted moments with probably

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.960 
it's perverted moments with probably
every<00:02:15.850> single<00:02:15.910> episode<00:02:16.440> so<00:02:17.520> it's<00:02:18.520> definitely

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
every single episode so it's definitely

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.100 
every single episode so it's definitely
on<00:02:19.150> a<00:02:19.180> more<00:02:19.780> mature<00:02:20.260> level<00:02:21.190> and<00:02:21.730> what<00:02:22.630> else<00:02:22.840> the

is that it is not only an animated or an

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:22.590 
is that it is not only an animated or an
anime<00:03:20.350> but<00:03:20.860> they<00:03:21.220> also<00:03:21.430> made<00:03:21.850> a<00:03:22.060> live-action

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:22.600

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:26.830 
Japanese version of the show but way

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:30.210 
Japanese version of the show but way
more<00:03:27.030> condensed<00:03:28.030> it<00:03:28.180> might<00:03:28.600> even<00:03:28.960> be<00:03:29.560> possibly

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
more condensed it might even be possibly

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:33.630 
more condensed it might even be possibly
less<00:03:30.610> than<00:03:30.910> 23<00:03:31.570> episodes<00:03:32.050> or<00:03:32.170> one<00:03:32.620> season<00:03:33.010> but

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:33.640 
less than 23 episodes or one season but
