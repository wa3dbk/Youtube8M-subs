this bike well we increase the travel
this<00:00:51.750> year<00:00:51.809> from<00:00:52.170> 120<00:00:52.829> ml<00:00:52.980> last<00:00:53.250> year<00:00:53.520> to<00:00:53.670> 140

this year from 120 ml last year to 140

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.119 
this year from 120 ml last year to 140
millimeters<00:00:54.539> this<00:00:54.870> year<00:00:55.079> front<00:00:55.410> and<00:00:55.469> rear<00:00:55.559> so

millimeters this year front and rear so

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.709 
millimeters this year front and rear so
with<00:00:56.460> the<00:00:56.520> increase<00:00:56.850> to<00:00:56.969> travel<00:00:57.360> that's<00:00:57.600> going

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
with the increase to travel that's going

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.119 
with the increase to travel that's going
to<00:00:57.809> allow<00:00:57.870> them<00:00:58.109> to<00:00:58.199> just<00:00:58.379> rip<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.680> descents

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
to allow them to just rip the descents

the<00:01:39.090> small<00:01:39.329> bumps<00:01:39.570> I<00:01:39.840> can<00:01:39.990> use<00:01:40.079> my<00:01:40.110> arms<00:01:40.500> and

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
the small bumps I can use my arms and

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.010 
the small bumps I can use my arms and
legs<00:01:40.680> they<00:01:41.310> can<00:01:41.520> dial<00:01:41.790> it<00:01:41.939> in<00:01:42.119> so<00:01:42.750> that<00:01:42.899> the

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
legs they can dial it in so that the

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.510 
legs they can dial it in so that the
suspension<00:01:43.829> is<00:01:43.860> going<00:01:44.009> to<00:01:44.070> have<00:01:44.189> a<00:01:44.220> firmer

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
suspension is going to have a firmer

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.880 
suspension is going to have a firmer
feel<00:01:44.850> so<00:01:45.360> it's<00:01:45.509> a<00:01:45.570> huge<00:01:45.600> range<00:01:46.259> of<00:01:46.380> attachment

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
feel so it's a huge range of attachment

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.940 
feel so it's a huge range of attachment
from<00:01:47.009> either<00:01:47.220> a<00:01:47.490> very<00:01:48.000> soft<00:01:48.360> plush<00:01:48.899> feeling<00:01:49.470> to

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
from either a very soft plush feeling to

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.240 
from either a very soft plush feeling to
a<00:01:49.979> much<00:01:50.159> firmer<00:01:50.460> more<00:01:50.970> race<00:01:51.270> bike<00:01:51.509> feel

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
a much firmer more race bike feel

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.109 
a much firmer more race bike feel
speaking<00:01:53.250> of<00:01:53.280> a<00:01:53.369> race<00:01:53.490> bike<00:01:53.700> feel<00:01:53.909> I<00:01:53.939> was

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
speaking of a race bike feel I was

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.749 
speaking of a race bike feel I was
looking<00:01:54.570> at<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:55.020> frame<00:01:55.439> it's<00:01:55.829> a<00:01:56.040> it's<00:01:56.340> a

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
looking at the frame it's a it's a

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.020 
looking at the frame it's a it's a
carbon<00:01:57.180> fiber<00:01:57.390> frame<00:01:57.810> but<00:01:58.590> i<00:01:58.619> notice<00:01:58.979> you<00:01:59.820> see

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
carbon fiber frame but i notice you see

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.609 
carbon fiber frame but i notice you see
a<00:02:00.060> lot<00:02:00.360> more<00:02:00.390> of<00:02:00.719> the<00:02:00.869> construction<00:02:01.409> of<00:02:01.469> this

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
a lot more of the construction of this

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:02.780 
a lot more of the construction of this
frame<00:02:01.799> than<00:02:01.950> you<00:02:02.040> do<00:02:02.130> in<00:02:02.250> some<00:02:02.430> other<00:02:02.520> bikes

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
frame than you do in some other bikes

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.539 
frame than you do in some other bikes
yeah<00:02:03.509> we<00:02:03.810> keep<00:02:04.200> it<00:02:04.350> like<00:02:04.469> a<00:02:04.500> roll<00:02:04.829> finish<00:02:05.280> and

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
yeah we keep it like a roll finish and

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.789 
yeah we keep it like a roll finish and
is<00:02:06.090> what<00:02:06.270> we<00:02:06.390> call<00:02:06.600> it<00:02:06.780> so<00:02:07.229> yeah<00:02:07.560> it's<00:02:07.710> the

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
is what we call it so yeah it's the

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.680 
is what we call it so yeah it's the
carbon<00:02:08.160> mainframe<00:02:08.670> we<00:02:08.940> have<00:02:09.030> a<00:02:09.060> carbon<00:02:09.450> seats

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
carbon mainframe we have a carbon seats

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:10.410 
carbon mainframe we have a carbon seats
day

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
day

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.720 
day
but<00:02:10.990> we<00:02:11.080> haven't<00:02:11.319> put<00:02:11.620> the<00:02:12.069> over<00:02:12.370> wrap<00:02:12.550> the

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
but we haven't put the over wrap the

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.640 
but we haven't put the over wrap the
classic<00:02:13.180> sort<00:02:13.390> of<00:02:13.510> carbon<00:02:14.140> weave<00:02:14.290> that<00:02:14.530> you

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
classic sort of carbon weave that you

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:15.780 
classic sort of carbon weave that you
see<00:02:14.890> in<00:02:14.980> here<00:02:15.220> these<00:02:15.310> people<00:02:15.550> talking<00:02:15.730> about

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
see in here these people talking about

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.510 
see in here these people talking about
12k<00:02:16.780> we<00:02:17.050> even<00:02:17.380> 1k<00:02:17.770> weave<00:02:17.950> and<00:02:18.220> things<00:02:18.400> like

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
12k we even 1k weave and things like

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.610 
12k we even 1k weave and things like
that<00:02:18.580> so<00:02:18.940> we<00:02:19.390> leave<00:02:19.540> it<00:02:19.690> off<00:02:19.810> this<00:02:20.050> bike<00:02:20.260> it's<00:02:20.560> a

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
that so we leave it off this bike it's a

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.890 
that so we leave it off this bike it's a
little<00:02:20.860> bit<00:02:20.950> of<00:02:21.040> weight<00:02:21.190> saving<00:02:21.750> but<00:02:22.750> you'll

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
little bit of weight saving but you'll

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.510 
little bit of weight saving but you'll
see<00:02:23.110> it<00:02:23.200> on<00:02:23.290> some<00:02:23.530> of<00:02:23.620> the<00:02:23.680> other<00:02:23.830> ranges<00:02:24.459> that

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:24.520 
see it on some of the other ranges that

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.910 
see it on some of the other ranges that
come<00:02:24.819> down<00:02:25.030> in<00:02:25.239> price<00:02:25.270> point<00:02:25.840> so<00:02:25.930> yeah<00:02:26.770> it's

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
come down in price point so yeah it's

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.410 
come down in price point so yeah it's
just<00:02:27.040> a<00:02:27.100> little<00:02:27.220> weight<00:02:27.430> saving<00:02:27.850> so<00:02:28.270> it<00:02:28.330> was

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
just a little weight saving so it was

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.390 
just a little weight saving so it was
that<00:02:28.540> carbon<00:02:28.900> we've<00:02:29.050> really<00:02:29.319> an<00:02:29.500> aesthetic<00:02:30.250> or

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
that carbon we've really an aesthetic or

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.180 
that carbon we've really an aesthetic or
does<00:02:30.520> it<00:02:30.550> provide<00:02:31.120> any<00:02:31.330> additional<00:02:31.510> strength

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
does it provide any additional strength

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.130 
does it provide any additional strength
a<00:02:33.190> little<00:02:33.640> bit<00:02:33.760> of<00:02:33.850> us<00:02:34.000> I<00:02:34.270> mean<00:02:34.720> a<00:02:34.780> lot<00:02:34.930> of<00:02:34.959> it

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
a little bit of us I mean a lot of it

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.170 
a little bit of us I mean a lot of it
it's<00:02:35.319> a<00:02:35.500> cosmetic<00:02:36.340> thing<00:02:36.370> that's<00:02:36.670> what<00:02:36.850> people

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
it's a cosmetic thing that's what people

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.470 
it's a cosmetic thing that's what people
imagine<00:02:37.300> carbon<00:02:38.080> looks<00:02:38.830> like<00:02:39.150> but<00:02:40.150> then<00:02:40.300> you

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
imagine carbon looks like but then you

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.210 
imagine carbon looks like but then you
can<00:02:40.630> see<00:02:40.840> here<00:02:41.110> the<00:02:41.290> roar<00:02:41.530> you<00:02:41.739> can<00:02:41.860> see<00:02:42.040> where

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
can see here the roar you can see where

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:43.620 
can see here the roar you can see where
the<00:02:42.340> layup<00:02:42.670> is<00:02:42.880> and<00:02:43.060> everything<00:02:43.300> like<00:02:43.390> that<00:02:43.450> so

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
the layup is and everything like that so

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:45.900 
the layup is and everything like that so
a<00:02:44.170> little<00:02:44.920> bit<00:02:45.100> of<00:02:45.130> both<00:02:45.280> depending<00:02:45.700> on<00:02:45.790> how

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:45.910 
a little bit of both depending on how

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:47.729 
a little bit of both depending on how
you<00:02:45.970> use<00:02:46.090> it<00:02:46.269> I<00:02:46.600> was<00:02:47.050> looking<00:02:47.230> at<00:02:47.290> the<00:02:47.410> head

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:47.739 
you use it I was looking at the head

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:49.020 
you use it I was looking at the head
tube<00:02:47.920> area<00:02:48.190> as<00:02:48.280> well<00:02:48.400> and<00:02:48.580> I<00:02:48.640> see<00:02:48.790> that<00:02:48.910> you're

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
tube area as well and I see that you're

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.240 
tube area as well and I see that you're
using<00:02:49.180> the<00:02:49.420> asymmetrical<00:02:50.110> design<00:02:50.440> there<00:02:50.620> yeah

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
using the asymmetrical design there yeah

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:52.890 
using the asymmetrical design there yeah
we<00:02:51.549> use<00:02:51.700> the<00:02:51.880> inch<00:02:52.150> and<00:02:52.299> a<00:02:52.330> half<00:02:52.360> on<00:02:52.660> the<00:02:52.720> lower

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
we use the inch and a half on the lower

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.840 
we use the inch and a half on the lower
bearing<00:02:53.170> in<00:02:53.530> generates<00:02:54.010> on<00:02:54.190> the<00:02:54.280> top<00:02:54.459> bearing

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:54.850 
bearing in generates on the top bearing

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.410 
bearing in generates on the top bearing
and<00:02:55.030> what<00:02:55.930> that<00:02:56.080> allows<00:02:56.200> us<00:02:56.380> to<00:02:56.680> do<00:02:56.890> is<00:02:57.420> give

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
and what that allows us to do is give

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.539 
and what that allows us to do is give
you<00:02:58.510> a<00:02:58.540> nice<00:02:58.750> stiff<00:02:59.170> front<00:02:59.410> end<00:02:59.650> but<00:03:00.069> also<00:03:00.220> save

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:00.549 
you a nice stiff front end but also save

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:02.370 
you a nice stiff front end but also save
weight<00:03:00.819> so<00:03:01.060> you've<00:03:01.330> got<00:03:01.360> a<00:03:01.480> very<00:03:01.690> responsive

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.380 
weight so you've got a very responsive

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.020 
weight so you've got a very responsive
front<00:03:03.010> end<00:03:03.190> for<00:03:03.400> the<00:03:03.519> steering<00:03:03.910> and

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
front end for the steering and

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.949 
front end for the steering and
everything<00:03:04.239> like<00:03:04.330> that<00:03:04.390> and<00:03:04.569> that<00:03:04.750> kind<00:03:04.930> of

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
everything like that and that kind of

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:06.990 
everything like that and that kind of
technology<00:03:05.140> is<00:03:05.620> trickled<00:03:06.459> down<00:03:06.489> from<00:03:06.880> the

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
technology is trickled down from the

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.490 
technology is trickled down from the
