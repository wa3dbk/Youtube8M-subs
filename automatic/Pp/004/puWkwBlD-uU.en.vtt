00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.509
 and not 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:17.699
 hello very good to all and welcome to 

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:19.800
 this little surprise video for all 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.539
 those who play in poque I piss and 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.869
 it's about nothing more and nothing less than the 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.189
 second draw of the channel 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:28.290
 this time good as you are seeing in 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.809
 screen is up to a PhD guy who 

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:32.250
 is beautiful before anything else I'm going to 

00:00:30.809 --> 00:00:34.590
 teach the change between youtube 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.660
 normal and youtube without and how good it is 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.699
 appreciates not quite as you are seeing 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.039
 basically because youtube if neither is 

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:42.960
 golden is not beautiful I love it 

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:45.570
 apart I am going to tell you a small 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.430
 anecdote not that I have with youtube that 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.550
 so I think it's one of the 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:53.520
 what I like most when I played in the 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.680
 pokémon version or do it already a fabric 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.140
 of years but a fabric of years me there 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.210
 I played rather well because I did not get very 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.030
 Well, not me, as the kids I played 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.829
 to play and it turns out that I got a 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.350
 serious to read without and that back then 

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:10.320
 in pokémon gold was red was not not 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.420
 not golden and I innocent I killed him no longer 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.640
 Over the years you say uncles 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.740
 it came out to me a serious les red was the 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.420
 first trustee and it came out this time I do not know 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.180
 has escaped me from here this is not serious 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.940
 but youtube is the same 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:27.210
 and the truth that I do not know was there that 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:29.310
 I killed my first sign I still remember 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.950
 of that moment and that they aimed to have 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.200
 caught not I clear that season 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.690
 of breeding that was I say then a luxury something 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:40.730
 no but it will stay but good at 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:43.580

 Well, I 'm not going to explain them a bit 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:08.950
 so you understand, imagine that 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.600

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.260

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:16.090
 Well you guys sign up and put

 name this put your name this 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.800
 that will do that when it comes to doing 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.840
 draw I'm going to do with the from 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:31.300
 the raffle page as in the 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.670
 Previous draw at the time of sign up 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:35.500
 your name will appear twice 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:37.390
 so you will have a little bit more 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:40.690
 probability that this that the sinn and 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:43.150
 if you pass on the video to someone and you 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:45.550
 you say put your name on the 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:48.280
 extra is good now questions that you 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:50.740
 can cause this many times 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:53.350
 someone may appear on the list 

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:55.990
 as much 2 is worth so that the one that does not 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:57.330
 can pass the video to anyone because no 

00:03:55.990 --> 00:04:00.270
 have 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:02.520
 both 800 thousand names in the list by 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:04.950
 as it were worth as much if you 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:08.190
 put four friends in extra as much 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:10.230
 you're going to look like twice is worth another case 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:12.240
 you can give is for example if I 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:14.550
 it aims is worth imagine you name 

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:17.910
 inside the game, gift and extra name 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:21.330
 borja and it happens that the 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:24.510
 pokemon without touches to borja is worth 

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:26.070
 borja has not posted a comment in plan 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:27.889
 saying that he wants to point to the 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:30.199
 draw 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:32.479
 would be null and would be done again 

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:35.180
 draw until someone came out who did 

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:37.669
 that has been scored is worth so good 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:39.919
 as last wish a lot of luck to 

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:41.689
 all of you who sign up we are going to do 

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:44.509
 a little review is worth a maximum 

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:46.879
 there will be until Sunday 26 for 

00:04:44.509 --> 00:04:49.159
 sign up to sign up you have to 

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:50.599
 be subscribed to the channel and put a 

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:54.830
 comment with the structure that I have 

00:04:50.599 --> 00:04:57.590
 explained and little better so much 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:58.699
 Really good luck to everyone and if you thought 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:02.360
 that this was all 

00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:05.090
 Well not after this draw when 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:08.449
 finish on Sunday is worth along that 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:10.969
 week I'm going to prepare another new meeting 

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:14.300
 it's worth the first one was quite 

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:17.599
 well we go a burrada of people already 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:19.879
 people said to plan the PCE 

00:05:17.599 --> 00:05:22.669
 he was going to explode, not the ones they had 

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:25.400
 so to speak so well I'm going to 

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:27.960
 ride as I say another new fit is worth 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:30.479
 after said draw 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:31.410
 do not worry and go up when finished 

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:33.419

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:36.150
 I will upload a new video with the information 

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:38.190

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:40.169

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:42.389

 your daily support to the channel the truth 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:53.639
