when<00:00:42.989> he's<00:00:43.140> singing<00:00:43.320> I<00:00:43.590> assume<00:00:43.920> he's<00:00:44.100> thinking

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
when he's singing I assume he's thinking

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.310 
when he's singing I assume he's thinking
about<00:00:44.579> this<00:00:44.730> actually<00:00:45.120> as<00:00:45.300> an<00:00:45.420> E<00:00:45.600> flat<00:00:45.780> 7<00:00:46.230> which

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
about this actually as an E flat 7 which

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.350 
about this actually as an E flat 7 which
is<00:00:46.379> anaconda<00:00:46.980> this<00:00:47.879> is<00:00:48.000> a<00:00:48.030> regular

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
is anaconda this is a regular

substitution<00:00:49.110> for<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.440> d7<00:00:49.920> you've<00:00:50.039> heard

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
substitution for the d7 you've heard

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:57.939 
substitution for the d7 you've heard
that<00:00:50.370> sound<00:00:55.610> so<00:00:56.610> he's<00:00:56.789> gonna<00:00:56.910> start<00:00:57.210> on<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.539> 9

00:00:57.939 --> 00:00:57.949 
that sound so he's gonna start on the 9

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:02.330 
that sound so he's gonna start on the 9
and<00:00:58.949> go<00:00:59.370> down<00:00:59.550> to<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.969> root<00:01:00.829> he's<00:01:01.829> gonna<00:01:02.039> start

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
and go down to the root he's gonna start

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:10.300 
and go down to the root he's gonna start
on<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.670> 7<00:01:03.329> 6<00:01:05.030> he's<00:01:06.030> gonna<00:01:06.150> go<00:01:06.299> from<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.570> root

he's<00:01:21.180> thinking<00:01:21.210> about<00:01:21.689> it<00:01:21.840> but<00:01:21.960> he's<00:01:22.049> gonna<00:01:22.170> go

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
he's thinking about it but he's gonna go

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.749 
he's thinking about it but he's gonna go
from<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.680> C<00:01:23.270> down<00:01:24.270> to<00:01:24.479> a<00:01:24.509> b-flat<00:01:25.580> he's<00:01:26.580> gonna

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
from the C down to a b-flat he's gonna

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:32.179 
from the C down to a b-flat he's gonna
go<00:01:26.939> from<00:01:27.150> a<00:01:27.330> G<00:01:28.200> f-sharp<00:01:30.650> but<00:01:31.650> he<00:01:31.710> does<00:01:31.920> a<00:01:31.950> little

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
go from a G f-sharp but he does a little

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:40.880 
go from a G f-sharp but he does a little
sort<00:01:32.490> of<00:01:32.520> diminish<00:01:32.939> sing<00:01:33.180> from<00:01:39.439> the<00:01:40.439> first<00:01:40.680> two

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
sort of diminish sing from the first two

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.130 
sort of diminish sing from the first two
sections<00:01:41.310> are<00:01:41.549> our<00:01:41.670> triplet<00:01:42.030> rhythm

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:50.120 

swing<00:01:46.140> swing<00:01:46.560> a<00:01:46.770> swan<00:01:46.979> game<00:01:48.170> and<00:01:49.170> then<00:01:50.009> of

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
swing swing a swan game and then of

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.330 
swing swing a swan game and then of
course<00:01:50.159> that<00:01:50.460> leads<00:01:50.670> very<00:01:50.909> nicely

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.890 

again<00:01:54.340> the<00:01:54.490> whole<00:01:54.610> lick<00:01:54.820> let's<00:01:55.540> see<00:01:55.630> if<00:01:55.720> I<00:01:55.780> can

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:55.900 
again the whole lick let's see if I can

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:59.250 
again the whole lick let's see if I can
play<00:01:56.110> it<00:01:57.600> some<00:01:58.600> reason<00:01:58.840> this<00:01:58.900> one<00:01:59.080> always

00:01:59.250 --> 00:01:59.260 
play it some reason this one always

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:07.320 
play it some reason this one always
gives<00:01:59.560> me<00:01:59.740> a<00:01:59.770> little<00:02:00.070> loop<00:02:05.730> now<00:02:06.730> that<00:02:07.180> little

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.330 
gives me a little loop now that little

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:08.580 
gives me a little loop now that little
section<00:02:07.840> on<00:02:07.900> the<00:02:08.020> end<00:02:08.170> that's<00:02:08.320> just<00:02:08.470> how<00:02:08.560> I

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
section on the end that's just how I

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.020 
section on the end that's just how I
like<00:02:08.830> to<00:02:08.860> end<00:02:09.130> it<00:02:09.280> that's<00:02:09.490> not<00:02:09.640> really

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
like to end it that's not really

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:17.760 
like to end it that's not really
probably<00:02:10.509> he<00:02:10.600> does<00:02:10.780> in<00:02:11.080> his<00:02:11.140> tune<00:02:16.560> so<00:02:17.560> whenever

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
probably he does in his tune so whenever

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:19.440 
probably he does in his tune so whenever
you're<00:02:18.220> wanting<00:02:18.550> to<00:02:18.730> add<00:02:18.850> this<00:02:19.000> to<00:02:19.150> your<00:02:19.180> solo

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
you're wanting to add this to your solo

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:20.700 
you're wanting to add this to your solo
so<00:02:19.690> let's<00:02:19.870> say<00:02:19.960> you<00:02:20.020> want<00:02:20.230> to<00:02:20.260> do<00:02:20.380> this<00:02:20.560> on

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:20.710 
so let's say you want to do this on

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:24.450 
so let's say you want to do this on
minor<00:02:21.010> swing<00:02:21.370> which<00:02:21.580> is<00:02:21.730> a<00:02:21.820> minor<00:02:22.390> instead<00:02:23.460> so

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:24.460 
minor swing which is a minor instead so

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:26.370 
minor swing which is a minor instead so
the<00:02:24.700> five<00:02:24.910> chord<00:02:25.180> is<00:02:25.300> e<00:02:25.450> so<00:02:25.840> we're<00:02:25.959> gonna<00:02:26.050> think

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
the five chord is e so we're gonna think

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:33.840 
the five chord is e so we're gonna think
of<00:02:26.500> this<00:02:26.680> again<00:02:27.100> one<00:02:28.530> half<00:02:29.530> so<00:02:29.920> from<00:02:30.730> the<00:02:32.850> can't

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
of this again one half so from the can't

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:37.770 
of this again one half so from the can't
do<00:02:34.000> the<00:02:34.150> harmonics<00:02:34.780> you<00:02:35.020> can<00:02:35.590> do<00:02:35.740> sort<00:02:35.950> of<00:02:36.780> some

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
do the harmonics you can do sort of some

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:44.670 
do the harmonics you can do sort of some
very<00:02:37.959> unnatural<00:02:38.350> harmonics<00:02:43.350> or<00:02:44.350> you<00:02:44.440> can<00:02:44.530> just

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
very unnatural harmonics or you can just

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.620 
very unnatural harmonics or you can just
do<00:02:44.830> the<00:02:44.980> notes<00:02:45.190> doesn't<00:02:45.700> quite<00:02:45.820> sound<00:02:46.030> as<00:02:46.390> nice

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630 
do the notes doesn't quite sound as nice

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.449 
do the notes doesn't quite sound as nice
just<00:02:46.989> think<00:02:47.140> of<00:02:47.260> whatever<00:02:47.500> something<00:02:48.220> else

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
just think of whatever something else

00:02:48.459 --> 00:03:04.920 
just think of whatever something else
that<00:02:48.610> you<00:02:48.670> want<00:02:48.700> to<00:02:48.880> do<00:03:03.330> enjoy<00:03:04.330> and<00:03:04.600> we'll<00:03:04.780> see

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
that you want to do enjoy and we'll see

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.290 
that you want to do enjoy and we'll see
you<00:03:05.019> tomorrow
