00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
it's the challenge of the unknown is

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.910 
it's the challenge of the unknown is
what<00:00:28.500> drives<00:00:29.040> me<00:00:29.310> to<00:00:29.490> keep<00:00:29.880> coming<00:00:30.180> back<00:00:30.920> he's

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
topography of this valley I bought this

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.790 
topography of this valley I bought this
property<00:00:45.510> because<00:00:46.050> of<00:00:46.230> that<00:00:46.320> valley<00:00:46.559> right

there<00:00:47.040> I've<00:00:47.250> been<00:00:47.550> hearing<00:00:47.820> about<00:00:47.879> this<00:00:48.180> for

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
there I've been hearing about this for

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.780 
there I've been hearing about this for
like<00:00:48.540> ten<00:00:48.809> years<00:00:49.070> but<00:00:50.070> I<00:00:50.100> never<00:00:50.340> doubted<00:00:50.550> it

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:50.790 
like ten years but I never doubted it

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:51.950 
like ten years but I never doubted it
would<00:00:50.820> happen<00:00:51.030> it<00:00:51.360> was<00:00:51.449> just<00:00:51.629> when<00:00:51.809> it<00:00:51.930> was

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
would happen it was just when it was

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.240 
would happen it was just when it was
gonna<00:00:52.140> happen<00:00:52.500> not<00:00:52.620> if<00:00:52.800> it<00:00:52.920> was<00:00:53.040> gonna<00:00:53.159> happen

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
gonna happen not if it was gonna happen

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.520 
gonna happen not if it was gonna happen
I<00:00:53.729> mean<00:00:54.089> we<00:00:54.239> could<00:00:54.390> build<00:00:54.510> anything<00:00:54.960> not<00:00:55.409> to

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
I mean we could build anything not to

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.290 
I mean we could build anything not to
pat<00:00:56.129> yourself<00:00:56.250> on<00:00:56.519> the<00:00:56.580> back<00:00:56.670> planes<00:00:57.089> are

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
pat yourself on the back planes are

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.640 
pat yourself on the back planes are
built<00:00:57.479> you<00:00:57.690> know<00:00:57.720> that's<00:00:58.080> not<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.320> hardest

00:00:58.640 --> 00:00:58.650 
built you know that's not the hardest

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.610 
built you know that's not the hardest
part<00:00:58.920> I'm<00:00:59.280> always<00:00:59.519> worried<00:01:00.120> about<00:01:00.210> him<00:01:00.750> you

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
part I'm always worried about him you

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.140 
part I'm always worried about him you
know<00:01:01.650> I<00:01:02.010> mean<00:01:02.309> even<00:01:02.339> though<00:01:02.640> he's<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:03.030> one

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:03.150 
know I mean even though he's the one

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:04.910 
know I mean even though he's the one
confident<00:01:03.659> in<00:01:03.720> doing<00:01:03.870> this<00:01:04.140> I<00:01:04.320> don't<00:01:04.470> want<00:01:04.830> to

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
confident in doing this I don't want to

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.440 
confident in doing this I don't want to
build<00:01:05.070> something<00:01:05.430> that's<00:01:05.729> ultimately<00:01:05.909> gonna

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
build something that's ultimately gonna

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.740 
build something that's ultimately gonna
get<00:01:07.020> him<00:01:07.200> hurt<00:01:07.729> all<00:01:08.729> those<00:01:09.030> structures<00:01:09.570> right

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
get him hurt all those structures right

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.780 
get him hurt all those structures right
there<00:01:09.960> are<00:01:10.080> gonna<00:01:10.229> be<00:01:10.409> gone<00:01:10.680> and<00:01:11.490> it's<00:01:11.640> gonna

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
there are gonna be gone and it's gonna

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.649 
there are gonna be gone and it's gonna
be<00:01:12.000> treacherously<00:01:12.930> dangerous<00:01:14.330> that's<00:01:15.330> the

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
be treacherously dangerous that's the

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.890 
be treacherously dangerous that's the
mind<00:01:15.930> of<00:01:16.110> Dani<00:01:16.350> right<00:01:16.620> there<00:01:17.600> he's<00:01:18.600> always

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
mind of Dani right there he's always

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.450 
mind of Dani right there he's always
looking<00:01:19.290> for<00:01:19.350> that<00:01:19.530> next<00:01:19.590> new<00:01:19.979> thing<00:01:20.010> it's

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
looking for that next new thing it's

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.910 
looking for that next new thing it's
like<00:01:20.640> you<00:01:21.119> know<00:01:21.270> like<00:01:21.510> the<00:01:21.930> mega<00:01:22.140> ramp<00:01:22.440> was

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
like you know like the mega ramp was

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.890 
like you know like the mega ramp was
just<00:01:23.130> a<00:01:23.220> ramp<00:01:23.430> then<00:01:24.240> he<00:01:24.330> turned<00:01:24.540> it<00:01:24.660> into<00:01:24.750> the

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
just a ramp then he turned it into the

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.930 
just a ramp then he turned it into the
gap<00:01:25.110> then<00:01:25.650> he<00:01:25.740> put<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.370> bar<00:01:26.580> until

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:26.940 
gap then he put the bar until

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:28.970 
gap then he put the bar until
just<00:01:27.450> like<00:01:27.570> every<00:01:27.960> structure<00:01:28.410> that<00:01:28.590> Danny's

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:28.980 
just like every structure that Danny's

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:31.250 
just like every structure that Danny's
built<00:01:29.190> before<00:01:29.660> you<00:01:30.660> know<00:01:30.780> there's<00:01:30.930> something

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:31.260 
built before you know there's something

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.380 
built before you know there's something
inside<00:01:31.560> of<00:01:31.620> him<00:01:31.920> that<00:01:31.950> that<00:01:32.400> needs<00:01:32.790> to<00:01:33.180> build

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
inside of him that that needs to build

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.480 
inside of him that that needs to build
it<00:01:33.630> that<00:01:33.660> needs<00:01:34.050> to<00:01:34.230> do<00:01:34.470> it<00:01:34.620> that<00:01:34.770> needs<00:01:35.010> to<00:01:35.220> do

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
it that needs to do it that needs to do

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.180 
it that needs to do it that needs to do
something<00:01:35.820> on<00:01:36.240> it<00:01:36.450> you<00:01:36.630> watch<00:01:37.440> what<00:01:37.800> he's<00:01:37.950> done

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:38.190 
something on it you watch what he's done

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.760 
something on it you watch what he's done
and<00:01:38.400> how<00:01:38.550> he's<00:01:38.760> evolved<00:01:39.330> and<00:01:39.510> you<00:01:40.200> just<00:01:40.380> wonder

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
and how he's evolved and you just wonder

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.890 
and how he's evolved and you just wonder
what's<00:01:41.160> next<00:01:41.310> what<00:01:41.970> could<00:01:42.150> he<00:01:42.210> possibly<00:01:42.450> be

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:42.900 
what's next what could he possibly be

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.600 
what's next what could he possibly be
next<00:01:43.470> and<00:01:43.620> it's<00:01:43.740> it<00:01:44.010> gets<00:01:44.280> kind<00:01:44.520> of<00:01:44.550> scary

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
next and it's it gets kind of scary

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.790 
next and it's it gets kind of scary
sometimes<00:01:45.180> to<00:01:45.720> see<00:01:45.930> what<00:01:46.200> this<00:01:46.650> is

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:46.800 
sometimes to see what this is
