00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:18.810
 Then I was able to complete the Gundam 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:21.560
 It was also when it was soother but it was a little bit extra 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.560
 I want to raise corruption 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:29.770
 Of Flings 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.770
 When I knew it was classic p, I ate as well as b 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:37.450
 I hope Canaan 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:40.230
 Then I drink glass with today 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:40.230
 Two point mall is after 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.100
 It is Lummus 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:48.300
 35% alcohol content Russia 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.640
 What solder 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.899
 Straight 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.899
 I would like to below 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.140
 Gundam 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:04.680
 A song that could be completed 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.680
 cheers 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.420
 Oh 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:12.170
 Previous 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.170
 Do not you 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.130
 Takada meet you 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:28.180
 shop 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:28.180
 This classic Pillars first abbreviation 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.370
 Decoction softening 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:43.070
 But it is not there that you have to eat in or dot 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:45.770
 Now i know 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:51.859
 Even if I worship, I make that one 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:54.130
 For coating trying in ink on the frame of the first failed but it had been in that leg 

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:57.490
 Glossy spray was applied 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:59.550
 It doesn't work well and I 've got a bald 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:02.210
 Say to erosion in the 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.210
 I think there was 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:11.210
 After all, it is good when using the paint that is a little paint solvent called acrylic solvent 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:17.350
 Is that 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:22.210
 I think you'll again and I wonder do and not do while thinking Toka place to use 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:23.270
 It is in a state of being made parallel to this first Gundam though 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:26.010
 Also 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:28.420
 If the highest-ri 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:31.980
 Without applying gloss spray 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:33.480
 I'm doing it next time 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.730
 this 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.300
 This 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:44.020
 Acrylic pro too 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:44.680
 I am doing this and in the same sister , I apply the gloss spray to this Gundam and do the coating 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:46.630
 From above 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.870
 this 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:55.370
 If it is packed , let's try a dragon 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:03:00.100
 Then Kedomo I What is the shape Tteyuu blow the evil spirits spray 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:02.790
 I'm to put ink in this directly are acrylic also thanks Saikozaku 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:08.760
 In it also that 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:15.299
 If it does not work where the hair seems to be strong or where the public part 2 does not apply too much 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:17.340
 Hey it is a place Toka little tiny thin parts doing it so doing such a place or 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:21.390
 Somewhere 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.080
 Where is it going to work a bit? 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:25.890
 U 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:28.290
 I think I'm think that I wonder if you will requires over a glossy spray in the same way 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:32.430
 Quite well 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:35.080
 Kamasei what Well also the Tteyuu apply only to capture spray for dad coating 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:40.770
 It's a little too good 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:43.820
 It's also possible to say that it has to be mixed until it gets dry 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:43.820
 Pretty 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:50.600
 They are fine 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:56.030
 But how to say this is I do not at the moment 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:04:01.330
 By coating Te be I do not may gloss spray for not only proceed in the current manner 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:06.090
 The E-mail directly at the Sumiri to or another first plane of the parts 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:11.270
 After all thanks for this real grade this is still parts 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:15.960
 I thought that I want to paint because it is tiny 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:19.280
 It is okay to divide the study parts so far 

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:19.280
 Even with color spray 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:29.560
 The easy and the do's by I-mer Sting the deep think true even if he increasingly without belly 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:31.520
 Since parts are divided , it is better to do tofu for each part 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:36.550
 Because it is a feeling 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:41.280
 If there is a little more variety of technology or if you can use an airbrush 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:44.370
 I think that I can make it more interesting 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:50.090
 It's amazing it's a great grade 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:50.090
 The height of precision is great I made it pink together 

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:54.360
 After all cool 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:05.450
 After all I say something from this original love 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:05.450
 You are not 

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:15.300
 There is something deep this time 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:17.070
 The parts are over or a. It is possible to complete high properly without such an accident. 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:21.280
 It was really good to be able 

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:24.470
 Have you really watch the video and write in various comments and more 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:28.760
 Thank you very much 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:32.120
 Pro Armor Gundam then comes 

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:34.129
 First Gundam also would be to complete 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:40.099
 Thank you very much 

00:05:34.129 --> 00:05:43.009

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:47.440
 of rx becomes supposed-to- 

00:05:45.689 --> 00:05:51.510
 Kansai
