00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.950 
plastic mold you can see that it's
somewhat<00:01:44.579> shiny<00:01:44.880> so<00:01:45.149> that's<00:01:45.329> why<00:01:45.540> this<00:01:45.600> piece

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
somewhat shiny so that's why this piece

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.710 
somewhat shiny so that's why this piece
is<00:01:46.200> somewhat<00:01:46.560> shiny<00:01:46.850> so<00:01:47.850> one<00:01:48.240> awesome<00:01:48.689> thing

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
is somewhat shiny so one awesome thing

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.039 
is somewhat shiny so one awesome thing
about<00:01:49.110> this<00:01:49.439> is<00:01:49.770> on<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.700> molding<00:01:51.090> Sodhi

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
about this is on the molding Sodhi

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.810 
about this is on the molding Sodhi
molding<00:01:52.380> was<00:01:52.470> super<00:01:52.770> easy<00:01:52.890> because<00:01:53.250> I<00:01:53.460> could

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
molding was super easy because I could

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.359 
molding was super easy because I could
just<00:01:54.000> flip<00:01:54.149> it<00:01:54.299> out<00:01:54.390> like<00:01:54.570> that<00:01:54.600> and<00:01:55.140> then<00:01:56.130> this

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
just flip it out like that and then this

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.130 
just flip it out like that and then this
just<00:01:56.610> kind<00:01:56.790> of<00:01:56.850> came<00:01:57.030> out<00:01:57.240> so<00:01:57.450> before<00:01:57.930> it<00:01:58.020> kind

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
just kind of came out so before it kind

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:58.730 
just kind of came out so before it kind
of<00:01:58.290> look<00:01:58.409> like

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
of look like

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.230 
of look like
that<00:01:58.860> I<00:01:59.159> can't<00:01:59.369> really<00:01:59.520> push<00:01:59.700> it<00:01:59.820> another<00:02:00.030> way

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
that I can't really push it another way

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.050 
that I can't really push it another way
anymore<00:02:01.409> and<00:02:01.680> I<00:02:01.890> just<00:02:02.070> pulled<00:02:02.340> it<00:02:02.490> out<00:02:02.610> so

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
anymore and I just pulled it out so

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.370 
anymore and I just pulled it out so
that's<00:02:03.540> pretty<00:02:03.780> cool<00:02:05.869> if<00:02:06.869> you<00:02:06.930> guys<00:02:07.080> are

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
that's pretty cool if you guys are

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.710 
that's pretty cool if you guys are
interested<00:02:07.560> in<00:02:08.130> me<00:02:08.429> going<00:02:08.819> into<00:02:09.060> talking

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
interested in me going into talking

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.880 
interested in me going into talking
about<00:02:10.130> silicone<00:02:11.130> mold<00:02:11.569> versus<00:02:12.569> plastic<00:02:13.260> molds

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
about silicone mold versus plastic molds

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.610 
about silicone mold versus plastic molds
like<00:02:13.950> this<00:02:14.370> which<00:02:14.760> is<00:02:14.880> also<00:02:15.060> another<00:02:15.620> trinket

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
like this which is also another trinket

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.290 
like this which is also another trinket
box<00:02:16.890> mold<00:02:17.220> I<00:02:17.400> would<00:02:17.550> be<00:02:17.640> more<00:02:17.849> than<00:02:17.970> happy<00:02:18.180> to

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
box mold I would be more than happy to

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.080 
box mold I would be more than happy to
do<00:02:18.510> another<00:02:18.750> video<00:02:19.140> about<00:02:19.890> it<00:02:20.400> just<00:02:20.790> let<00:02:21.030> me

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
do another video about it just let me

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.690 
do another video about it just let me
know<00:02:21.330> so<00:02:21.650> these<00:02:22.650> are<00:02:22.830> the<00:02:22.920> silicone<00:02:23.370> molds

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
know so these are the silicone molds

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.850 
know so these are the silicone molds
that<00:02:23.790> are<00:02:23.970> very<00:02:24.330> very<00:02:24.540> flexible<00:02:24.660> and<00:02:25.620> these

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
that are very very flexible and these

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.160 
that are very very flexible and these
are<00:02:25.980> the<00:02:26.069> plastic<00:02:26.519> molds<00:02:26.849> so<00:02:27.599> that's<00:02:27.900> pretty

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
are the plastic molds so that's pretty

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.350 
are the plastic molds so that's pretty
much<00:02:28.349> it<00:02:28.560> for<00:02:28.860> the<00:02:28.980> trinket<00:02:29.519> spotlight<00:02:30.030> or<00:02:30.269> the

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
much it for the trinket spotlight or the

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.320 
much it for the trinket spotlight or the
resin<00:02:30.690> spotlight<00:02:31.140> I<00:02:31.850> really<00:02:32.850> like<00:02:33.000> how<00:02:33.150> this

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330
