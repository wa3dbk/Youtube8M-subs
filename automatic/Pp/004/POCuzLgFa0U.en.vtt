00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.520 
creature on the board in the red space
and<00:02:17.300> you<00:02:18.300> can<00:02:18.450> see<00:02:18.569> there's<00:02:18.750> two<00:02:18.959> spots<00:02:19.140> here

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
and you can see there's two spots here

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.170 
and you can see there's two spots here
to<00:02:19.620> take<00:02:19.770> ritas<00:02:20.099> start<00:02:20.310> so<00:02:20.459> it<00:02:20.550> would<00:02:20.670> draw<00:02:20.879> one

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
to take ritas start so it would draw one

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.839 
to take ritas start so it would draw one
and<00:02:21.390> here's<00:02:22.200> a<00:02:22.260> creature<00:02:22.530> that's<00:02:22.890> worth<00:02:23.280> six

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
and here's a creature that's worth six

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:27.740 
and here's a creature that's worth six
points<00:02:23.970> so<00:02:24.959> I<00:02:24.989> put<00:02:25.200> that<00:02:25.349> there<00:02:25.560> and<00:02:26.390> then<00:02:27.390> the

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
points so I put that there and then the

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.809 
points so I put that there and then the
next<00:02:27.780> person<00:02:28.140> goes<00:02:28.500> now<00:02:29.160> what<00:02:29.370> you're<00:02:29.520> trying

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
here one of the red cards eventually

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.820 
here one of the red cards eventually
will<00:02:52.590> say<00:02:52.920> the<00:02:53.849> dragon<00:02:54.330> awakes<00:02:54.660> at<00:02:55.260> this<00:02:55.500> point

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
will say the dragon awakes at this point

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.850 
will say the dragon awakes at this point
the<00:02:56.459> dragon<00:02:56.849> awakes<00:02:57.120> and<00:02:57.379> the<00:02:58.379> dragon<00:02:58.620> is

next<00:03:03.959> to<00:03:04.379> the<00:03:04.439> cup<00:03:04.739> and<00:03:04.980> you<00:03:05.069> can't<00:03:05.310> take<00:03:05.459> any

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:05.609 
next to the cup and you can't take any

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:06.709 
next to the cup and you can't take any
more<00:03:05.640> creatures<00:03:05.939> out<00:03:06.180> of<00:03:06.239> the<00:03:06.299> cup<00:03:06.450> until<00:03:06.569> you

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:06.719 
more creatures out of the cup until you

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:08.509 
more creatures out of the cup until you
move<00:03:06.870> in<00:03:07.049> but<00:03:07.920> you'll<00:03:08.099> have<00:03:08.219> a<00:03:08.280> lot<00:03:08.489> of

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
move in but you'll have a lot of

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:10.080 
move in but you'll have a lot of
opportunities<00:03:09.180> whenever<00:03:09.450> you<00:03:09.540> go<00:03:09.599> to<00:03:09.659> a

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
opportunities whenever you go to a

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.330 
opportunities whenever you go to a
space<00:03:10.269> where<00:03:11.019> there's<00:03:11.200> no<00:03:11.319> longer<00:03:11.530> any<00:03:11.680> cards

space where there's no longer any cards

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.180 
space where there's no longer any cards
because<00:03:12.610> many<00:03:13.300> of<00:03:13.390> these<00:03:13.569> spaces<00:03:13.959> have<00:03:14.800> only<00:03:15.069> a

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
because many of these spaces have only a

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.580 
because many of these spaces have only a
few<00:03:15.400> cards<00:03:15.790> at<00:03:16.000> them<00:03:16.269> then<00:03:17.080> once<00:03:17.349> you<00:03:17.440> land

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
few cards at them then once you land

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.080 
few cards at them then once you land
there<00:03:17.769> you<00:03:17.920> can<00:03:18.040> move<00:03:18.190> the<00:03:18.280> Dragons<00:03:18.640> any<00:03:18.760> zone

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
there you can move the Dragons any zone

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:21.300 
there you can move the Dragons any zone

they carry them in the cart then they

here<00:05:36.150> on<00:05:36.240> the<00:05:36.330> box<00:05:36.540> that<00:05:36.690> it's<00:05:36.870> 47<00:05:37.440> and<00:05:37.560> up<00:05:37.680> and
