00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
how we do it and I believe there's been

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.350 
how we do it and I believe there's been
a<00:00:43.680> lot<00:00:43.890> of<00:00:43.920> ease<00:00:44.100> on<00:00:44.280> this<00:00:44.430> particular<00:00:44.820> spot

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
a lot of ease on this particular spot

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.160 
a lot of ease on this particular spot

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
but not the way I do it and they tried

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.840 
but not the way I do it and they tried
to<00:00:49.200> patch<00:00:49.469> it<00:00:49.680> in<00:00:49.800> but<00:00:50.100> they<00:00:50.250> kind<00:00:50.520> of<00:00:50.579> didn't

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
thing I believe there's only legionaries

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.030 
thing I believe there's only legionaries
and<00:02:24.370> that's<00:02:24.489> it<00:02:24.930> and<00:02:25.930> that's<00:02:26.230> all<00:02:26.770> you<00:02:26.890> gotta

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
and that's it and that's all you gotta

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.390

worry about and so I'll just pump your a

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.440 
worry about and so I'll just pump your a
little<00:02:30.580> bit<00:02:30.670> just<00:02:30.790> to<00:02:30.880> show<00:02:31.090> you<00:02:31.120> more<00:02:31.390> a

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
little bit just to show you more a

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.830 
little bit just to show you more a
concept<00:02:32.260> like<00:02:32.380> a<00:02:32.500> loss<00:02:32.770> where<00:02:32.980> to<00:02:33.070> go<00:02:33.190> okay<00:02:33.840> and

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
concept like a loss where to go okay and

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.170 
concept like a loss where to go okay and
right<00:02:35.080> over<00:02:35.110> here<00:02:35.380> um<00:02:35.670> people<00:02:36.670> might<00:02:36.910> disrupt

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
right over here um people might disrupt

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:38.820 
right over here um people might disrupt
it<00:02:37.450> but<00:02:37.600> I<00:02:37.660> believe<00:02:37.900> that<00:02:37.959> as<00:02:38.350> long<00:02:38.440> as<00:02:38.709> they're

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
it but I believe that as long as they're

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:40.860 
it but I believe that as long as they're
on<00:02:38.890> outside<00:02:39.220> of<00:02:39.280> the<00:02:39.340> rock<00:02:39.520> they<00:02:40.420> should<00:02:40.690> be

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
on outside of the rock they should be

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.130 
on outside of the rock they should be
able<00:02:40.959> to<00:02:42.090> you<00:02:43.090> know<00:02:43.209> hurt<00:02:43.390> my<00:02:43.510> progress<00:02:43.810> of

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
able to you know hurt my progress of

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.650 
able to you know hurt my progress of
doing<00:02:44.290> this<00:02:44.380> oh<00:02:44.620> we<00:02:45.549> got<00:02:45.670> more<00:02:45.820> red<00:02:46.000> dots<00:02:46.269> and

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
doing this oh we got more red dots and

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.470 
doing this oh we got more red dots and
just<00:02:46.810> aim<00:02:47.019> right<00:02:47.350> in<00:02:47.470> there<00:02:47.650> and<00:02:48.480> sometimes

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
just aim right in there and sometimes

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.449 
just aim right in there and sometimes
they<00:02:49.780> will<00:02:49.900> teleport<00:02:50.170> out<00:02:50.440> it's<00:02:50.709> you<00:02:51.370> know

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
they will teleport out it's you know

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:53.699 
they will teleport out it's you know
it's<00:02:51.489> not<00:02:51.760> uncommon<00:02:52.239> that<00:02:52.450> they<00:02:52.660> won't<00:02:52.870> they

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
it's not uncommon that they won't they

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:56.400 
it's not uncommon that they won't they
will<00:02:54.060> but<00:02:55.060> as<00:02:55.450> long<00:02:55.570> as<00:02:55.630> you<00:02:55.750> got<00:02:55.840> a<00:02:55.900> quick<00:02:56.260> way
