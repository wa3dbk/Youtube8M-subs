00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:21.859 
lessons on hand technique I'm playing

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:25.630 
lessons on hand technique I'm playing
quicker<00:00:22.820> notes<00:00:23.119> and<00:00:23.840> then<00:00:24.830> going<00:00:25.160> to<00:00:25.340> slower

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:25.640 
quicker notes and then going to slower

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.929 
quicker notes and then going to slower
tempos<00:00:26.890> but<00:00:27.890> making<00:00:28.310> sure<00:00:28.550> that<00:00:28.699> when<00:00:28.820> I<00:00:28.849> do

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:28.939 
tempos but making sure that when I do

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:32.260 
tempos but making sure that when I do
that<00:00:29.269> I<00:00:29.539> don't<00:00:29.750> stop<00:00:30.349> here<00:00:30.769> and<00:00:30.949> then<00:00:31.820> be<00:00:32.029> stuck

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:32.270 
that I don't stop here and then be stuck

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:33.970 
that I don't stop here and then be stuck
and<00:00:32.450> have<00:00:32.570> to<00:00:32.660> lift<00:00:32.840> it<00:00:32.990> up<00:00:33.080> so<00:00:33.320> basically<00:00:33.770> from

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:33.980 
and have to lift it up so basically from

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.970 
and have to lift it up so basically from
these<00:00:34.130> quick<00:00:34.340> and<00:00:34.370> notes<00:00:34.670> click<00:00:35.420> away<00:00:35.950> when<00:00:36.950> I

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:36.980 
these quick and notes click away when I

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:38.139 
these quick and notes click away when I
want<00:00:37.160> to<00:00:37.220> slow<00:00:37.370> down<00:00:37.579> I've<00:00:37.760> got<00:00:37.789> to<00:00:38.000> let<00:00:38.090> the

00:00:38.139 --> 00:00:38.149 
want to slow down I've got to let the

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:39.549 
want to slow down I've got to let the
fingers<00:00:38.510> out<00:00:38.629> and<00:00:38.809> let<00:00:38.960> the<00:00:39.079> stick<00:00:39.320> bounce

00:00:39.549 --> 00:00:39.559 
fingers out and let the stick bounce

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:50.139 
fingers out and let the stick bounce
higher<00:00:47.649> and<00:00:48.649> so<00:00:48.980> I'm<00:00:49.039> doing<00:00:49.280> that<00:00:49.399> French

00:00:50.139 --> 00:00:50.149 
higher and so I'm doing that French

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:52.439 
higher and so I'm doing that French
company<00:00:51.050> grip<00:00:51.289> of<00:00:51.440> the<00:00:51.469> thumb<00:00:51.710> on<00:00:51.800> top<00:00:51.829> and

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:00.790 
German grip with on the side and things
underneath<00:00:58.989> so<00:00:59.989> again<00:01:00.260> check<00:01:00.530> out<00:01:00.649> the

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800 
underneath so again check out the

previous blog articles for more thoughts
on<00:01:03.410> those<00:01:03.739> and<00:01:04.100> so<00:01:05.090> what<00:01:05.239> I'm<00:01:05.330> did<00:01:05.480> today<00:01:05.720> is<00:01:06.050> I

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
on those and so what I'm did today is I

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.870 
on those and so what I'm did today is I
have<00:01:06.580> pyramid<00:01:07.580> here<00:01:08.000> on<00:01:08.300> my<00:01:08.860> laptop<00:01:09.860> and<00:01:10.310> I'm

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:10.880 
have pyramid here on my laptop and I'm

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.249 
have pyramid here on my laptop and I'm
just<00:01:11.119> working<00:01:11.570> at<00:01:11.689> switching<00:01:11.960> between

00:01:12.249 --> 00:01:12.259 
just working at switching between

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:16.109 
just working at switching between
different<00:01:13.040> rates<00:01:13.280> so<00:01:13.759> for<00:01:14.630> example<00:01:14.659> if<00:01:15.380> i

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:16.119 
different rates so for example if i

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:20.490 
different rates so for example if i
switch<00:01:17.119> between<00:01:17.299> a<00:01:17.479> rate<00:01:17.720> of<00:01:17.750> four<00:01:18.200> and<00:01:18.590> six<00:01:19.390> at

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:20.500 
switch between a rate of four and six at

00:01:20.500 --> 00:02:11.900 
switch between a rate of four and six at
300

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:42.090 

bolton<00:02:12.910> I<00:02:13.000> house<00:02:23.549> this<00:02:24.549> way<00:02:24.790> i<00:02:27.090> would<00:02:41.100> your

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
bolton I house this way i would your

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:53.220 
bolton I house this way i would your
feet<00:02:50.910> so<00:02:51.910> I'm<00:02:52.000> gonna<00:02:52.150> work<00:02:52.329> my<00:02:52.389> off<00:02:52.840> leash<00:02:53.049> too

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
feet so I'm gonna work my off leash too

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.680 
feet so I'm gonna work my off leash too
but<00:02:53.440> so<00:02:53.650> i'm<00:02:53.739> going<00:02:53.920> to<00:02:53.980> put<00:02:54.040> 14<00:02:54.970> and<00:02:55.239> then<00:02:55.420> two

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
but so i'm going to put 14 and then two

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:24.470 
but so i'm going to put 14 and then two
sixes<00:02:56.260> and

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.000 

and<00:03:25.480> then<00:03:25.990> you<00:03:26.230> can<00:03:26.380> put<00:03:26.590> whatever<00:03:26.710> you<00:03:26.920> want

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
and then you can put whatever you want

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.640 
and then you can put whatever you want
in<00:03:27.280> here<00:03:27.520> so<00:03:27.790> you<00:03:27.850> could<00:03:28.060> put<00:03:28.270> in<00:03:28.360> a<00:03:28.420> random<00:03:28.870> set

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
in here so you could put in a random set

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:36.570 
in here so you could put in a random set
of<00:03:29.710> number<00:03:30.160> let's<00:03:30.430> go<00:03:30.750> 35<00:03:31.830> for<00:03:34.200> 25<00:03:35.520> so<00:03:36.520> I'm

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:36.580 
of number let's go 35 for 25 so I'm

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:38.100 
of number let's go 35 for 25 so I'm
going<00:03:36.640> to<00:03:36.790> look<00:03:37.060> at<00:03:37.210> this<00:03:37.390> psych<00:03:37.720> and<00:03:37.930> see

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:38.110 
going to look at this psych and see

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:55.080 
going to look at this psych and see
what's<00:03:38.320> coming<00:03:38.530> so<00:03:39.340> we've<00:03:39.490> got<00:03:53.580> you<00:03:54.580> just<00:03:54.910> go

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:55.090 
what's coming so we've got you just go

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:57.840 
what's coming so we've got you just go
between<00:03:55.510> say<00:03:55.960> six<00:03:56.560> and<00:03:56.830> seven<00:03:57.340> or<00:03:57.460> something

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:57.850 
between say six and seven or something

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:01.530 
between say six and seven or something
like<00:03:57.970> that<00:03:58.740> to<00:03:59.740> give<00:04:00.010> you<00:04:00.130> practicing<00:04:00.850> smaller

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
like that to give you practicing smaller

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:21.680 
like that to give you practicing smaller
rate<00:04:01.870> changes

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:26.490 

quite<00:04:22.690> difficult<00:04:24.840> so<00:04:25.840> all<00:04:26.110> sorts<00:04:26.410> of

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500 
quite difficult so all sorts of

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.050 
quite difficult so all sorts of
different<00:04:26.740> rates<00:04:27.100> you<00:04:27.430> know<00:04:27.520> big<00:04:27.790> jobs

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
different rates you know big jobs

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:29.700 
different rates you know big jobs
smaller<00:04:28.690> jobs<00:04:28.960> the<00:04:29.080> smaller<00:04:29.320> jumps<00:04:29.530> are

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
smaller jobs the smaller jumps are

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:31.530 
smaller jobs the smaller jumps are
harder<00:04:30.040> I<00:04:30.220> always<00:04:30.460> think<00:04:30.700> go<00:04:30.910> between<00:04:31.240> three

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:31.540 
harder I always think go between three

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:32.880 
harder I always think go between three
and<00:04:31.570> four<00:04:31.990> can<00:04:32.320> be<00:04:32.410> quite<00:04:32.650> difficult

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:32.890 
and four can be quite difficult

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:36.750 
and four can be quite difficult
especially<00:04:33.370> high<00:04:33.880> tempo<00:04:35.250> so<00:04:36.250> maybe<00:04:36.580> I'll

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:36.760 
especially high tempo so maybe I'll

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:56.250 
especially high tempo so maybe I'll
service<00:04:37.060> inform<00:04:53.160> make<00:04:54.160> it<00:04:54.340> go<00:04:54.490> higher<00:04:55.260> maybe

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:56.260 
service inform make it go higher maybe

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:57.390 
service inform make it go higher maybe
I'll<00:04:56.380> be<00:04:56.470> like<00:04:56.590> the<00:04:56.710> next<00:04:56.920> version<00:04:57.040> i'm<00:04:57.250> going

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:57.400 
I'll be like the next version i'm going

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.300 
I'll be like the next version i'm going
to<00:04:57.460> go<00:04:57.550> between<00:04:58.000> and<00:04:58.290> six<00:04:59.290> and<00:04:59.620> eight<00:04:59.860> which<00:05:00.160> is

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:00.310 
to go between and six and eight which is

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:16.479 
to go between and six and eight which is
a<00:05:00.340> similar<00:05:00.610> things<00:05:01.060> like<00:05:01.330> two<00:05:01.570> lots<00:05:01.780> of<00:05:01.930> each

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:16.489 

00:05:16.489 --> 00:05:31.309 

250<00:05:28.429> so<00:05:29.429> all<00:05:30.089> these<00:05:30.269> really<00:05:30.689> good<00:05:30.809> exercise
