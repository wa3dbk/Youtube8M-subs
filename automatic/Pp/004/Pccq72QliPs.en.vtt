00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.440
 gospels and said he did not want to discuss 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.330
 with the best but anyway I did the 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.820
 answer here in respect to your 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:12.800
 viewers were the people who 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.800
 We will eventually cover your child. 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:22.740
 the galera is is to unify a video of i 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.269
 robbery of the saints on consumption of 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.970
 meat type 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:30.269
 I 'm not a mechanic today . 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:33.030
 medical biological health view but 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.340
 So I'll see if things do not work here. 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.980
 intentional not to speak directly from the 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.829
 medical and biological fashion of his son 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.140
 I make a point of saying that I lived 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.059
 very technical questions about health and 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.910
 animal foods whose 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:51.329
 source navigation had a lot of technical 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.309
 and difficult understanding for laypeople should 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.289
 be answered with people 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.320
 specialists will see those who have 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:00.149
 experience with health professionals 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:04.530
 supporters of diets 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:06.450
 described in this is the son of 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.369
 related to food consumption 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.659
 of animal origin and health 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:14.100
 I only stop when the argument is easy to 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.479
 mess with p 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.700
 when it is easy to find evidence in 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:21.270
 but contrary videos with the book 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.009
 gospel that are very technical and requires 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.180
 a response to the height of a professional 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.720
 of health 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:31.920
 I did not understand and talk about aspects 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:34.890
 technicians is biological but I could 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:42.390
 find several arguments in his river 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:43.560
 and I'll answer here and get there, I'll go 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:48.060
 reply here 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:50.549
 this time is not for me and arguments of the 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.530
 edital appears in the video I answered 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:55.890
 then you can make a general overview 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:59.939
 because from argument or I can 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:02.790
 Reply is very small it uses in the video 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:04.920
 him a fallacious fallacy with 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:08.610
 just a myth that older advocates 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.830
 Dragon health life is not true 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.620
 from non- human animals of the 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:16.770
 series of sentient beings and not life in 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:19.680
 other bands including the matters that do not 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:21.090
 environmental wine that is only one 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.490
 environmental vision 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.230
 he also uses a fallacy from the 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:28.620
 tradition when saying that humanity 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:30.870
 always with my car and it's not because the 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.720
 mankind always with my car that 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:36.270
 we are now allowed to continue 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.820
 eating human flesh has always been a 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:42.600
 hunter when he wants us to go 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:46.260
 to depend on chance we will hunt in a 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:48.750
 kills standing at home and say nothing again 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:51.660
 he did not know all the 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.260
 We play to say that everyone respects me. 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.630
 vacation 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:57.420
 other categories of taxonomic animals 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:03:00.860
 but not insects well people who consider 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:04.380
 uncertain top 5 shopping mall of our morale 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:07.680
 there are other people who say that in 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:10.200
 certain science does not have a complex 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:14.010
 good tone that suited her well and 7 when 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:16.769
 pose a threat to our 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.780
 our integrity to our life 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:21.269
 there he talks about the requirement of 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:24.390
 perfection to demand that every year 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:27.570
 in the bush and a half soon more dangerous threat 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:30.299
 I did not know it was and more ahead. 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:32.190
 he uses an abominable we have a 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:36.959
 against parents of children 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:40.320
 vegetarians to try a bit in peace 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:42.150
 and two to their children to eat meat and 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:46.260
 then in the grass here are the vegetarians 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:47.790
 and vegans who are imposters to consume 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.239
 food of animal origin 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:53.640
 he is also aware of the sun and 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:54.989
 when saying that some fatty acids only 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.750
 they exist in the flesh 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:04:01.140
 You can find simone fat yes omega 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:04.110
 3 and omega 6 and foods such as flaxseed 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:06.450
 some vegetable oils type of economy 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:08.640
 I think and since then we've come here to talk 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:11.250
 survival on the back mixed with the 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:14.430
 terrorism and the threat to speak of a mother 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:17.549
 whose daughter was poorly fed and 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:19.349
 mother he did not recommend but imposed better 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:20.670
 that itches consume meat 

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:23.880
 This is something for me. 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:25.920
 ethics because it does not mention that 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:28.560
 may fall on a power supply. 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:30.390
 unbalanced eating person and yes 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.340
 that the absence of meat consumption 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:35.250
 this was extremely irresponsible of the 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.870
 part of it and it's worse than his video 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:40.170
 as others have mentioned 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:42.900
 accessible strength in link studies 

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:45.090
 he says that some studies the person has 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:47.910
 what to look for in his blog plus one blog 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:50.460
 So I'm not well 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:52.830
 organized does not have an easy way 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:55.410
 find this link outside the bar 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:57.930
 research for example of the law to go to 

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:59.070
 the previous, realistic page of 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:01.260
 posts 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:03.600
 the person needs to type in the search 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:06.540
 meat or saturated fat 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:09.950
 but still I find nothing followed 

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:14.310
 inspired by the studies but rather a case of 

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:16.800
 light he talks about and saturated fat is 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:19.830
 tolls and leaves the faces to me precious 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:22.260
 that although there were use of vicious samples 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:23.910
 mixes to sink connections with the 

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:26.880
 dangerousness of excess fat 

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:30.450
 saturated and cholesterol in the bush and not 

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:32.490
 proves that eating meat is better than 

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:35.850
 be vegetarian 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:38.930
 in this he uses many difficult arguments 

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:42.650
 that the so-called fallacy 

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:45.750
 verbose argument that in Latin type 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:49.680
 a verbal argument that with this 

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:52.380
 the same thing and uses and sources evidence 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:55.050
 very difficult to verify if 

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:57.530
 that there really wanted 

00:05:55.050 --> 00:06:01.890
 I would report being more honest first 

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:04.740
 sketch in his video and actually uses it 

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:06.780
 not only to health but also to the time for 

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:10.020
 to defend a certain type of food 

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:11.970
 that advances the load in the second he 

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:14.910
 not healthy 

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:17.249
 It's the day he'll start wanting by 

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:21.359
 recommend for him to eat human flesh 

00:06:17.249 --> 00:06:22.589
 dog face run fast to have 

00:06:21.359 --> 00:06:24.869
 good health 

00:06:22.589 --> 00:06:26.899
 I really do not expect him to go to me. 

00:06:24.869 --> 00:06:29.339
 reply jaqueline spoke explicitly 

00:06:26.899 --> 00:06:32.429
 Who does not want to talk with better years? 

00:06:29.339 --> 00:06:35.009
 but following as vice in the beginning in 

00:06:32.429 --> 00:06:37.859
 respect to who was the Basque that the video 

00:06:35.009 --> 00:06:41.249
 it 's basically that if you liked it 

00:06:37.859 --> 00:06:43.799
 of the video on the favorite video clip 

00:06:41.249 --> 00:06:46.049
 subscribe to the channel and fight this video 

00:06:43.799 --> 00:06:47.549
 here on facebook on twitter on google + 

00:06:46.049 --> 00:06:50.239
 other social networks 

00:06:47.549 --> 00:06:50.239
 thanks
