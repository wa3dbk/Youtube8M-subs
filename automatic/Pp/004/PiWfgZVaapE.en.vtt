an internal SD card and somewhere I did

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:34.810 
an internal SD card and somewhere I did
see<00:03:32.150> from<00:03:32.690> one<00:03:32.959> of<00:03:33.080> the<00:03:33.250> some<00:03:34.250> other<00:03:34.280> review

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:34.820 
see from one of the some other review

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:36.729 
see from one of the some other review
some<00:03:35.090> spec<00:03:35.330> review<00:03:35.660> where<00:03:36.350> they<00:03:36.560> actually

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:36.739 
some spec review where they actually

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:39.370 
some spec review where they actually
have<00:03:37.220> it<00:03:37.370> labeled<00:03:37.670> as<00:03:37.940> an<00:03:38.180> internal<00:03:38.510> sd<00:03:39.350> card

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:39.380 
have it labeled as an internal sd card

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.170 
have it labeled as an internal sd card
but<00:03:39.680> it's<00:03:39.830> you'll<00:03:40.220> see<00:03:40.519> it<00:03:40.610> says<00:03:40.760> internal

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 
but it's you'll see it says internal

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.630 
but it's you'll see it says internal
memory<00:03:41.390> four<00:03:41.690> gigabytes<00:03:42.110> now<00:03:42.709> that's<00:03:42.920> set<00:03:43.519> up

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:43.640 
memory four gigabytes now that's set up

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.820 
memory four gigabytes now that's set up
so<00:03:43.790> you<00:03:43.850> can<00:03:44.090> transfer<00:03:44.570> files<00:03:45.260> that's<00:03:45.680> where

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:45.830 
so you can transfer files that's where

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:48.330

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 
get installed so what I asked again was

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.949 
get installed so what I asked again was
that<00:03:53.720> um<00:03:54.489> it's<00:03:55.489> in<00:03:55.700> fact<00:03:55.910> 8<00:03:56.120> gigabytes<00:03:56.480> with

use it like an SD card the other gig gig

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:05.960 
use it like an SD card the other gig gig
and<00:07:01.800> a<00:07:01.860> half<00:07:01.980> is<00:07:02.330> used<00:07:04.370> just<00:07:05.370> to<00:07:05.490> store<00:07:05.760> apps

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:05.970

contacts and things but still

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:09.620 
contacts and things but still
information<00:07:08.340> viewers<00:07:08.670> so<00:07:09.060> they<00:07:09.180> consider<00:07:09.510> it

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:09.630 
information viewers so they consider it

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:12.080 
information viewers so they consider it
being<00:07:09.810> available<00:07:10.200> to<00:07:10.410> you<00:07:10.640> that<00:07:11.640> is<00:07:11.850> how<00:07:12.060> it

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:12.090 
being available to you that is how it

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:16.220 
being available to you that is how it
breaks<00:07:12.390> down<00:07:12.770> so<00:07:13.770> the<00:07:13.980> 8<00:07:14.190> gigabytes<00:07:14.640> on<00:07:15.230> the

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:16.230 
breaks down so the 8 gigabytes on the
