the type of the vehicle the éclairs is
usually<00:02:20.879> allow<00:02:21.780> for<00:02:22.049> every<00:02:22.230> 5,000<00:02:22.769> miles<00:02:22.890> a

00:02:23.149 --> 00:02:23.159 
usually allow for every 5,000 miles a

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:24.530 
usually allow for every 5,000 miles a
lot<00:02:23.370> of<00:02:23.430> people<00:02:23.640> are<00:02:23.700> putting<00:02:23.819> synthetic<00:02:24.420> in

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
lot of people are putting synthetic in

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.570 
lot of people are putting synthetic in
their<00:02:24.659> vehicles<00:02:25.049> so<00:02:25.200> they<00:02:25.290> can<00:02:25.440> go<00:02:25.560> longer<00:02:25.890> the

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
their vehicles so they can go longer the

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.059 
their vehicles so they can go longer the
cost<00:02:26.879> of<00:02:27.090> synthetic<00:02:27.330> fluid<00:02:28.290> versus<00:02:28.769> the

cost of synthetic fluid versus the

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:32.540 
cost of synthetic fluid versus the
standard<00:02:29.280> petroleum-based<00:02:30.000> oil<00:02:30.420> is<00:02:31.220> the<00:02:32.220> cost

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
standard petroleum-based oil is the cost

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.580 
standard petroleum-based oil is the cost
difference<00:02:32.880> is<00:02:33.000> huge<00:02:33.240> so<00:02:33.750> if<00:02:34.050> you're<00:02:34.200> doing<00:02:34.470> an

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
difference is huge so if you're doing an

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:35.210 
difference is huge so if you're doing an
oil<00:02:34.709> change

three to five thousand miles that's

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.330 
three to five thousand miles that's
sufficient<00:02:37.410> anything<00:02:37.860> over<00:02:38.040> a<00:02:38.100> hundred

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:41.460 
every three thousand miles and just

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.580 
every three thousand miles and just
doing<00:02:42.000> a<00:02:42.150> regular<00:02:42.270> oil<00:02:42.510> change<00:02:42.930> versus<00:02:43.380> going

with<00:02:43.740> this<00:02:43.860> synthetic<00:02:44.340> synthetic<00:02:44.820> is<00:02:45.210> great

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
with this synthetic synthetic is great

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.660 
with this synthetic synthetic is great
for<00:02:45.690> a<00:02:45.720> vehicle<00:02:45.960> that<00:02:46.230> is<00:02:46.680> using<00:02:47.460> a<00:02:47.520> lot<00:02:47.640> more

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
for a vehicle that is using a lot more

for a vehicle that is using a lot more
heat<00:02:48.000> where<00:02:48.240> there's<00:02:48.390> pulling<00:02:48.810> trailers<00:02:49.440> or

if<00:02:50.130> you<00:02:50.250> have<00:02:50.460> a<00:02:51.050> tool<00:02:52.050> truck<00:02:52.320> behind<00:02:52.680> it<00:02:52.920> or

if you have a tool truck behind it or

if you have a tool truck behind it or
tool<00:02:53.340> trailer<00:02:53.760> you<00:02:54.630> can<00:02:54.660> use<00:02:54.900> that<00:02:55.050> and<00:02:55.530> can

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
tool trailer you can use that and can

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.190 
tool trailer you can use that and can
you<00:02:55.920> just<00:02:56.090> say<00:02:57.090> I'm<00:02:57.480> gonna<00:02:57.630> switch<00:02:57.900> from<00:02:58.140> a

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
you just say I'm gonna switch from a

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.140 
you just say I'm gonna switch from a
petroleum<00:02:58.710> base<00:02:58.860> to<00:02:59.070> a<00:02:59.100> synthetic<00:02:59.430> based<00:02:59.850> oil

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
petroleum base to a synthetic based oil

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.780 
petroleum base to a synthetic based oil
and<00:03:00.480> just<00:03:00.780> do<00:03:00.930> it<00:03:00.960> just<00:03:01.590> like<00:03:01.770> that<00:03:01.830> you<00:03:02.760> can

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
and just do it just like that you can

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.060 
and just do it just like that you can
but<00:03:03.360> if<00:03:03.570> you<00:03:03.660> go<00:03:03.990> to<00:03:04.050> a<00:03:04.200> synthetic<00:03:04.470> base<00:03:04.830> you

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.070 
but if you go to a synthetic base you

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:06.470 
but if you go to a synthetic base you
want<00:03:05.250> to<00:03:05.340> keep<00:03:05.460> with<00:03:05.670> the<00:03:05.760> synthetic<00:03:05.970> base<00:03:06.270> you

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
want to keep with the synthetic base you

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:07.730 
want to keep with the synthetic base you
don't<00:03:06.630> want<00:03:06.750> to<00:03:06.840> go<00:03:06.930> to<00:03:06.990> a<00:03:07.140> petroleum-based

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:07.740 
don't want to go to a petroleum-based

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:09.710 
don't want to go to a petroleum-based
oil<00:03:08.100> then<00:03:08.400> a<00:03:08.430> synthetic<00:03:08.670> the<00:03:09.030> next<00:03:09.240> oil<00:03:09.390> change

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
oil then a synthetic the next oil change

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.080 
oil then a synthetic the next oil change
and<00:03:09.870> then<00:03:09.959> back<00:03:10.170> to<00:03:10.320> a<00:03:10.350> petroleum<00:03:10.980> base<00:03:11.130> you

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
and then back to a petroleum base you

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:13.430 
and then back to a petroleum base you
don't<00:03:12.270> want<00:03:12.420> to<00:03:12.510> switch<00:03:12.750> them<00:03:12.900> back<00:03:12.930> and<00:03:13.260> forth

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
don't want to switch them back and forth

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.430 
don't want to switch them back and forth
the<00:03:13.620> engines<00:03:13.950> don't<00:03:14.100> like<00:03:14.760> that<00:03:14.940> very<00:03:15.180> well

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
the engines don't like that very well

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.840 
the engines don't like that very well
they<00:03:16.440> get<00:03:16.620> pretty<00:03:16.740> particular<00:03:17.130> about<00:03:17.190> that

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
they get pretty particular about that

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:21.290 
they get pretty particular about that
but<00:03:18.480> an<00:03:19.230> oil<00:03:19.590> change<00:03:19.620> was<00:03:19.980> like<00:03:20.130> fast<00:03:20.400> food<00:03:20.490> you

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:21.300 
but an oil change was like fast food you

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.090 
but an oil change was like fast food you
want<00:03:21.450> to<00:03:21.510> do<00:03:21.630> it<00:03:21.750> often<00:03:22.110> enough<00:03:22.380> but<00:03:22.740> just<00:03:22.920> a

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
want to do it often enough but just a

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.010 
want to do it often enough but just a
regular<00:03:23.430> diet<00:03:23.640> of<00:03:23.820> the<00:03:23.970> quickie<00:03:24.240> lubes<00:03:24.480> isn't

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:25.020 
regular diet of the quickie lubes isn't

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:26.210 
regular diet of the quickie lubes isn't
the<00:03:25.110> best<00:03:25.260> thing<00:03:25.470> you<00:03:25.620> want<00:03:25.770> to<00:03:25.830> take<00:03:25.980> it<00:03:26.100> into

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
the best thing you want to take it into

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.790 
the best thing you want to take it into
a<00:03:26.450> technician<00:03:27.450> they<00:03:27.840> can<00:03:28.050> really<00:03:28.200> look<00:03:28.470> at<00:03:28.650> it

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:28.800 
a technician they can really look at it

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.530 
a technician they can really look at it
and<00:03:29.010> catch<00:03:29.520> some<00:03:29.730> of<00:03:29.760> those<00:03:29.880> problems<00:03:30.330> before

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
and catch some of those problems before

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.120 
and catch some of those problems before
they<00:03:30.780> happen<00:03:30.810> so<00:03:31.560> what<00:03:31.709> are<00:03:31.860> some<00:03:31.890> of<00:03:32.010> the

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
they happen so what are some of the

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:33.740 
they happen so what are some of the
worst<00:03:32.250> cases<00:03:32.490> you've<00:03:32.850> seen<00:03:33.060> as<00:03:33.240> far<00:03:33.420> as<00:03:33.540> people

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
worst cases you've seen as far as people

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.920 
worst cases you've seen as far as people
going<00:03:34.050> too<00:03:34.260> long<00:03:34.440> on<00:03:34.680> a<00:03:34.709> oil<00:03:35.190> change<00:03:35.930> actually

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930

going too long on a oil change actually
I<00:03:36.959> had<00:03:37.290> a<00:03:37.590> customer<00:03:38.190> that<00:03:38.340> came<00:03:38.459> in<00:03:38.670> with<00:03:38.910> a

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
I had a customer that came in with a

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.870 
I had a customer that came in with a
noise<00:03:39.900> that<00:03:40.200> their<00:03:40.350> vehicle<00:03:41.130> was<00:03:41.160> making<00:03:41.640> and

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
noise that their vehicle was making and

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.970 
noise that their vehicle was making and
it<00:03:42.030> was<00:03:42.180> nearly<00:03:42.570> totally<00:03:43.230> out<00:03:43.380> of<00:03:43.530> engine<00:03:43.890> oil

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
it was nearly totally out of engine oil

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.009 
it was nearly totally out of engine oil
luckily<00:03:44.880> we<00:03:45.000> filled<00:03:45.300> it<00:03:45.420> full<00:03:45.540> of<00:03:45.600> engine<00:03:45.959> oil

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
luckily we filled it full of engine oil

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:49.100 
luckily we filled it full of engine oil
changed<00:03:46.650> it<00:03:46.860> flushed<00:03:47.160> it<00:03:47.370> a<00:03:47.459> few<00:03:47.670> times<00:03:48.110> and

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110 
changed it flushed it a few times and

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.140 
changed it flushed it a few times and
ran<00:03:49.500> it<00:03:49.769> it<00:03:50.010> doesn't<00:03:50.430> seem<00:03:50.580> to<00:03:50.670> be<00:03:50.730> making<00:03:50.880> any
