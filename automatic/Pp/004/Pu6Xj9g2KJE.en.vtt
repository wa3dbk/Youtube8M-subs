there's always a little problem that
needs<00:01:00.820> to<00:01:01.030> be<00:01:01.059> figured<00:01:01.540> out<00:01:01.689> so<00:01:02.470> I<00:01:02.860> feel<00:01:03.670> like

needs to be figured out so I feel like

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:07.590 
needs to be figured out so I feel like

this stuff paint the stuff you know that
I<00:01:21.310> basically<00:01:23.550> understand<00:01:25.110> on<00:01:26.110> some<00:01:26.530> level<00:01:27.240> you

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.240 
I basically understand on some level you

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.590 
I basically understand on some level you
could<00:01:28.600> garnish<00:01:29.590> it<00:01:29.830> with<00:01:29.860> all<00:01:30.190> kinds<00:01:30.909> of<00:01:31.120> of

could garnish it with all kinds of of

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.790 
could garnish it with all kinds of of
theoretical<00:01:32.530> constructs<00:01:33.100> but<00:01:33.820> it's<00:01:34.620> it's<00:01:35.620> a

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:35.800 
theoretical constructs but it's it's a

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:41.280 
theoretical constructs but it's it's a
person<00:01:36.400> alone<00:01:37.330> in<00:01:37.750> a<00:01:38.260> room<00:01:39.780> making<00:01:40.780> things

with their hands and I like to keep it
that<00:01:46.510> simple<00:01:46.540> a<00:01:47.290> lot<00:01:47.890> of<00:01:48.040> days<00:01:48.280> and<00:01:48.700> when

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:49.510 
that simple a lot of days and when

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:52.950 
that simple a lot of days and when
you're<00:01:49.659> making<00:01:49.810> things<00:01:51.300> and<00:01:52.300> when<00:01:52.659> you<00:01:52.750> have

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960 
you're making things and when you have

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.910 
you're making things and when you have
your<00:01:53.110> little<00:01:53.290> cottage<00:01:53.860> industry<00:01:55.920> there's

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
your little cottage industry there's

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.250 
your little cottage industry there's
always<00:01:57.130> something<00:01:57.700> to<00:01:57.729> do<00:01:58.000> when<00:01:58.750> I<00:01:58.840> go<00:01:59.020> to<00:01:59.080> my

00:01:59.250 --> 00:01:59.260 
always something to do when I go to my

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.710 
always something to do when I go to my
studio<00:01:59.560> I<00:02:00.100> start<00:02:00.640> out<00:02:00.760> by<00:02:00.909> sweeping<00:02:01.180> the<00:02:01.360> floor

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 
studio I start out by sweeping the floor

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.360 
studio I start out by sweeping the floor
I<00:02:03.270> start<00:02:04.270> out<00:02:04.479> by<00:02:05.020> making<00:02:05.590> sure<00:02:05.920> everything's

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:06.370 
I start out by making sure everything's

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.810 
I start out by making sure everything's
in<00:02:06.490> order

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:06.820 
in order

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.809 
in order
I<00:02:07.379> start<00:02:08.379> out<00:02:08.530> by<00:02:08.769> trying<00:02:09.099> to<00:02:09.250> make<00:02:09.399> sure<00:02:09.610> my

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:09.819 
I start out by trying to make sure my

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:16.020 
I start out by trying to make sure my
mind<00:02:10.119> is<00:02:10.330> clear<00:02:10.840> and<00:02:13.620> then<00:02:14.620> I<00:02:14.920> think<00:02:15.400> about<00:02:15.549> the

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
mind is clear and then I think about the

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.680 
mind is clear and then I think about the
problem<00:02:16.629> that<00:02:17.140> didn't<00:02:17.650> get<00:02:17.799> solved<00:02:18.220> yesterday

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
problem that didn't get solved yesterday

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:25.199 
problem that didn't get solved yesterday
and<00:02:20.760> that<00:02:21.760> opens<00:02:22.719> it<00:02:22.870> up<00:02:22.959> for<00:02:23.170> me

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
and that opens it up for me

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:29.459 
and that opens it up for me
so<00:02:25.870> I<00:02:25.930> think<00:02:25.989> that's<00:02:26.379> the<00:02:27.040> process<00:02:28.170> what's<00:02:29.170> the

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:29.469 
so I think that's the process what's the

00:02:29.469 --> 00:02:31.770 
so I think that's the process what's the
problem<00:02:29.890> today<00:02:30.189> is<00:02:30.579> the<00:02:31.150> question<00:02:31.480> I<00:02:31.569> ask

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
problem today is the question I ask

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
problem today is the question I ask
myself<00:02:34.920> the<00:02:35.920> Roey<00:02:36.099> seems<00:02:36.459> to<00:02:36.640> be<00:02:36.760> something

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:39.800 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:52.600 

I'm<00:02:40.550> most<00:02:40.850> happy<00:02:43.570> when<00:02:44.570> I<00:02:50.530> I'm<00:02:51.530> not<00:02:51.860> distracted

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
I'm most happy when I I'm not distracted

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:54.700 
I'm most happy when I I'm not distracted
when<00:02:53.180> I'm<00:02:53.300> working<00:02:53.750> when<00:02:54.020> I<00:02:54.050> could<00:02:54.350> go<00:02:54.470> to<00:02:54.530> my

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:54.710 
when I'm working when I could go to my

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:57.660 
when I'm working when I could go to my
studio<00:02:55.010> when<00:02:55.640> I<00:02:55.930> somehow<00:02:56.930> could<00:02:57.110> live<00:02:57.260> in<00:02:57.380> that

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
studio when I somehow could live in that

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.420 
studio when I somehow could live in that
presence<00:02:58.670> that<00:02:59.410> presence<00:03:00.410> and<00:03:00.590> the<00:03:00.920> present

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
presence that presence and the present

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:07.110 
presence that presence and the present
and<00:03:02.390> I<00:03:03.020> could<00:03:03.170> do<00:03:03.290> it<00:03:03.380> repetitively<00:03:04.930> so<00:03:05.930> that

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
and I could do it repetitively so that

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.300 
and I could do it repetitively so that
you<00:03:08.120> kind<00:03:08.390> of<00:03:08.450> build<00:03:08.630> up<00:03:08.870> a<00:03:08.990> steam<00:03:09.380> you<00:03:10.220> know

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
you kind of build up a steam you know

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:11.830 
you kind of build up a steam you know
it's<00:03:10.460> like<00:03:10.550> a<00:03:10.670> it's<00:03:10.970> like<00:03:11.060> an<00:03:11.270> engine<00:03:11.450> it's

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
it's like a it's like an engine it's

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.020 
it's like a it's like an engine it's
like<00:03:11.990> a<00:03:12.110> it's<00:03:13.010> like<00:03:13.160> a<00:03:13.340> percolator<00:03:14.150> and

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
like a it's like a percolator and

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:21.250 
like a it's like a percolator and
sometimes<00:03:17.030> it<00:03:17.210> just<00:03:17.360> becomes<00:03:18.400> you<00:03:19.400> know<00:03:20.260> it

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
sometimes it just becomes you know it

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:26.680 
sometimes it just becomes you know it
really<00:03:21.650> becomes<00:03:22.400> a<00:03:24.550> kind<00:03:25.550> of<00:03:25.760> a<00:03:25.880> concentration

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
really becomes a kind of a concentration

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:32.710 
really becomes a kind of a concentration
that's<00:03:26.930> so<00:03:27.590> pure<00:03:29.410> that<00:03:30.410> I<00:03:30.440> think<00:03:30.980> is<00:03:31.720> both

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
that's so pure that I think is both

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.950 
that's so pure that I think is both
playful<00:03:33.170> and<00:03:33.680> imaginative<00:03:34.310> and<00:03:34.850> opens<00:03:35.660> up<00:03:35.810> all

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:35.960 
playful and imaginative and opens up all

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:39.820 
playful and imaginative and opens up all
kinds<00:03:35.990> of<00:03:36.410> new<00:03:36.820> possibilities
