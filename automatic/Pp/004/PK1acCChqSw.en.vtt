00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:41.290 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:48.570 

okay<00:01:42.290> now<00:01:42.680> unplugging<00:01:43.340> that<00:01:43.580> throttle

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:48.580 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.560 

plugging<00:01:49.580> in<00:01:51.220> the<00:01:52.220> ningke<00:01:52.640> progressive

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 
plugging in the ningke progressive

00:01:53.570 --> 00:02:00.450 
plugging in the ningke progressive
trottle<00:01:54.460> to<00:01:55.460> use<00:01:55.670> with<00:01:55.970> the<00:01:56.120> same<00:01:56.360> cart<00:01:57.190> with

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.990 

the<00:02:01.460> ningke<00:02:02.650> progressive<00:02:03.650> pot<00:02:04.130> thing<00:02:04.490> turned

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
the ningke progressive pot thing turned

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.320 
the ningke progressive pot thing turned
down<00:02:05.740> to<00:02:06.740> its<00:02:06.890> lowest<00:02:07.130> setting<00:02:07.640> that<00:02:08.149> is

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
down to its lowest setting that is

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:29.740 
down to its lowest setting that is
around<00:02:08.840> that<00:02:09.170> way<00:02:09.730> okay

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:40.240 

with<00:02:30.750> the<00:02:34.520> in<00:02:35.520> the<00:02:35.640> position<00:02:36.150> that<00:02:36.360> might

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.830 

that's<00:02:41.250> it<00:02:41.460> that<00:02:42.150> keeps<00:02:42.420> you<00:02:42.480> one<00:02:42.660> of<00:02:42.750> the

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
that's it that keeps you one of the

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:54.110 
that's it that keeps you one of the
missing<00:02:43.200> law<00:02:43.380> steps

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:00.440 

so<00:02:54.870> that's<00:02:55.019> just<00:02:55.319> up<00:02:58.370> from<00:02:59.370> the<00:02:59.450> lowest

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
so that's just up from the lowest

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:08.000 
so that's just up from the lowest
setting<00:03:05.690> switching<00:03:06.690> through<00:03:06.870> now<00:03:07.170> to<00:03:07.440> the

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
setting switching through now to the

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.199 
setting switching through now to the
highest<00:03:08.250> setting<00:03:08.700> screwing<00:03:09.480> it<00:03:09.629> up<00:03:09.720> that<00:03:10.680> way

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
highest setting screwing it up that way

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:31.690 
highest setting screwing it up that way
that<00:03:12.209> way<00:03:12.450> to<00:03:12.810> the<00:03:12.930> highest<00:03:13.110> city

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:43.910 

okay<00:03:32.840> once<00:03:33.840> again<00:03:35.000> stand<00:03:36.000> it<00:03:36.150> throttle<00:03:42.920> stand

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
okay once again stand it throttle stand

00:03:43.920 --> 00:04:27.350 
okay once again stand it throttle stand
it<00:03:44.040> throttle<00:03:54.560> and<00:03:56.900> Scorpius

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:27.360 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.350 

you<00:04:28.360> can<00:04:28.540> decide<00:04:28.840> for<00:04:29.020> yourselves
