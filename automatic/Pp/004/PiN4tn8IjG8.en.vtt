00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:07.649
 today is the seventeenth of april somehow on and 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:12.380
 no plans included 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:15.420
 take on today's search but 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:19.439
 what happened now what happened i 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:21.900
 I am again in my fishing line where with 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.640
 civil war many ammo i'm still 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.439
 still legs large numbers 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.980
 find 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:29.939
 here are the cartridges and the whole cartridge settled 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:39.870
 there was a fight 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:49.620
 many every possible many many 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:56.719
 all kinds of comes across me across 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:59.820
 the visibility of things well, I'll post it now 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:06.350
 I do not yet scatter the whole thing 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:06.350
 these ones 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:14.910
 it is from the shape well touched by a lot here 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:18.690
 okay this is all nonsense 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:23.160
 Now I have passed the signal of 30 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:26.150
 attention did not pay him what I fell 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:35.000
 until it looked all 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:35.000
 here but in my opinion it is something 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:44.550
 standing really standing here in place 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:52.440
 modern fights no walkers here 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:55.880
 no, you know, you can dig 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:59.690
 will tell you what it is but it 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:06.540
 this is from civil war some kind of mark 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:08.840
 anchor and here before the St. Andrew flag and 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.840
 flag 

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:15.390
 Russian armed forces Moscow 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.520
 here so here is young nonsense now I'm her 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:26.750
 cleaned up 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:30.410
 I look in detail what is a little bit I 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:34.020
 cleaned it up a little 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:37.850
 have no idea what it is because 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:41.430
 I've never seen anything like it before 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:43.880
 a man like that won't tell what it is 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.880
 may be 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.709
 so above the system 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:06.330
 Well, everything will continue to search possible 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.330
 what else is interesting is having a fall
