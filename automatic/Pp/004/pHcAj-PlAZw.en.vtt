honestly my whole pistol like how I

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:35.080 
honestly my whole pistol like how I
approach<00:05:32.720> it<00:05:32.930> I<00:05:33.110> go<00:05:33.740> about<00:05:33.880> more<00:05:34.880> of<00:05:35.060> a

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:35.090 
approach it I go about more of a

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:38.890 
approach it I go about more of a
strategy<00:05:36.190> than<00:05:37.190> actual<00:05:37.640> gun<00:05:38.210> skill<00:05:38.540> with<00:05:38.870> the

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:38.900 
strategy than actual gun skill with the

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:42.360 
strategy than actual gun skill with the
pistol<00:05:39.910> I've<00:05:40.910> pretty<00:05:41.480> decent<00:05:41.810> accuracy

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:42.370 
pistol I've pretty decent accuracy

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:45.370 
pistol I've pretty decent accuracy
definitely<00:05:43.370> better<00:05:43.550> than<00:05:43.610> guns<00:05:44.080> just<00:05:45.080> a<00:05:45.170> joke

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:45.380 
definitely better than guns just a joke

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:48.100 
definitely better than guns just a joke
but<00:05:46.010> spending<00:05:46.730> plenty<00:05:46.880> of<00:05:47.030> their<00:05:47.120> guns<00:05:47.330> but<00:05:47.930> uh

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:48.110 
but spending plenty of their guns but uh

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:52.320 
but spending plenty of their guns but uh
it's<00:05:48.650> true<00:05:49.400> I<00:05:49.940> think<00:05:50.720> my<00:05:50.870> accuracy<00:05:51.170> is<00:05:51.560> a

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:52.330 
it's true I think my accuracy is a

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:54.700 
it's true I think my accuracy is a
pretty<00:05:53.330> good<00:05:53.630> I'm<00:05:54.140> not<00:05:54.320> gonna<00:05:54.440> say<00:05:54.590> I'm<00:05:54.680> the

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:54.710 
pretty good I'm not gonna say I'm the

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:57.760 
pretty good I'm not gonna say I'm the
best<00:05:54.980> because<00:05:55.640> I<00:05:55.760> don't<00:05:55.970> want<00:05:56.000> to<00:05:56.210> over<00:05:56.770> boast

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:57.770 
best because I don't want to over boast

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:59.980 
best because I don't want to over boast
myself<00:05:57.950> because<00:05:58.670> then<00:05:58.850> cops<00:05:59.510> are<00:05:59.720> gonna<00:05:59.810> get

00:05:59.980 --> 00:05:59.990 
myself because then cops are gonna get

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:03.010 
myself because then cops are gonna get
some<00:06:00.170> haters<00:06:00.560> but<00:06:01.040> I<00:06:01.390> think<00:06:02.390> my<00:06:02.570> actually

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:03.020 
some haters but I think my actually

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:04.480 
some haters but I think my actually
pretty<00:06:03.230> good<00:06:03.440> but<00:06:03.740> my<00:06:03.920> trigger<00:06:04.160> finger<00:06:04.310> is

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:04.490 
pretty good but my trigger finger is

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:07.420 
pretty good but my trigger finger is
probably<00:06:05.120> my<00:06:05.210> only<00:06:05.360> downfall<00:06:06.010> but<00:06:07.010> when<00:06:07.340> it

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:07.430 
probably my only downfall but when it

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:10.450 
probably my only downfall but when it
comes<00:06:07.610> to<00:06:07.850> overall<00:06:08.330> I<00:06:09.020> think<00:06:09.320> strategy<00:06:10.190> will

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:10.460 
comes to overall I think strategy will

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:13.450 
comes to overall I think strategy will
become<00:06:11.090> skilled<00:06:11.390> anyways<00:06:11.990> and<00:06:12.370> you<00:06:13.370> don't

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:13.460 
become skilled anyways and you don't

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:17.590 
become skilled anyways and you don't
really<00:06:13.640> in<00:06:13.940> my<00:06:14.180> opinion<00:06:14.410> obviously<00:06:16.300> how<00:06:17.300> guns

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:17.600 
really in my opinion obviously how guns

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.570 
really in my opinion obviously how guns
is<00:06:17.780> approaching<00:06:18.380> the<00:06:18.410> tryouts<00:06:18.830> whatever<00:06:19.220> it's

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:19.580 
is approaching the tryouts whatever it's

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:21.460 
is approaching the tryouts whatever it's
if<00:06:20.000> you<00:06:20.120> got<00:06:20.360> a<00:06:20.390> fast<00:06:20.630> trigger<00:06:20.870> finger<00:06:21.230> you<00:06:21.320> got

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:21.470 
if you got a fast trigger finger you got

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:22.720 
if you got a fast trigger finger you got
a<00:06:21.500> good<00:06:21.680> chance<00:06:21.860> you're<00:06:22.040> gonna<00:06:22.100> make<00:06:22.400> it<00:06:22.580> as

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:22.730 
a good chance you're gonna make it as

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:24.330 
a good chance you're gonna make it as
long<00:06:22.970> as<00:06:23.150> it's<00:06:23.270> mixed<00:06:23.570> with<00:06:23.600> some<00:06:23.870> goods<00:06:24.110> gun

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:24.340 
long as it's mixed with some goods gun

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:27.730 
long as it's mixed with some goods gun
good<00:06:25.340> strategy<00:06:25.790> and<00:06:25.820> good<00:06:26.000> gun<00:06:26.210> skills<00:06:26.740> but

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:27.740 
good strategy and good gun skills but

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:32.050 
good strategy and good gun skills but
what<00:06:28.640> my<00:06:28.880> personal<00:06:29.480> approach<00:06:29.690> to<00:06:29.930> the<00:06:31.060> pistols

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:32.060 
what my personal approach to the pistols

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:34.240 
what my personal approach to the pistols
is<00:06:32.330> um<00:06:32.630> don't<00:06:33.410> really<00:06:33.590> need<00:06:33.740> a<00:06:33.800> fast<00:06:34.040> trigger

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:34.250 
is um don't really need a fast trigger

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:37.360 
is um don't really need a fast trigger

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:37.370 
finger like I said it's more about the

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:38.950 
finger like I said it's more about the

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:38.960 
strategy when it comes to just pistols

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:41.890 
strategy when it comes to just pistols
it's<00:06:39.470> like<00:06:39.560> using<00:06:39.710> a<00:06:39.890> gun<00:06:40.480> it<00:06:41.480> really<00:06:41.660> does<00:06:41.870> not

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:41.900 
it's like using a gun it really does not

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:44.350 
it's like using a gun it really does not
matter<00:06:42.050> what<00:06:42.380> gun<00:06:42.620> you're<00:06:42.770> using<00:06:43.360> obviously

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:52.100 
that's what she said but anyways using a

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:54.490 
that's what she said but anyways using a
better<00:06:52.280> gun<00:06:52.520> obviously<00:06:53.240> like<00:06:53.360> tar<00:06:53.570> 21<00:06:53.720> after

00:07:45.279 --> 00:07:45.289 
a us kids I guess and their base

00:07:45.289 --> 00:07:49.460 
a us kids I guess and their base
performance-wise<00:07:46.289> is<00:07:47.270> all<00:07:48.270> on<00:07:48.570> tragedy<00:07:49.110> which

and they're very good so as you see

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:55.240 
and they're very good so as you see
