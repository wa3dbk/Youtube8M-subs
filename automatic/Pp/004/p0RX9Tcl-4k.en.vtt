00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.360
 how they were congratulations on another one 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.309
 point in the league 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.429
 well thank you it doesn't really feel like 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:16.199
 a profit to that one point because seen 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.230
 the match picture have much more 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:21.330
 deserves and as a PhD student I like 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.660
 your parents choose and behind pressure behind 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:27.029
 really find three points a lot 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.590
 more films unfortunately it was he 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.760
 missed many opportunities 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.410
 you have a well out of the fire 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.750
 must he drag that whole point yes that 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.430
 That's right that has really been difficult with 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.989
 fall and rise 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.670
 the boys who scared those 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.469
 actually from that 2 0 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.090
 and that is actually a moment of that 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.309
 pay attention and then you get to the 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.570
 ears and then playing was actually it 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:45.989
 game what they go against me lines 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.690
 play 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.219
 wherever we are trained to pay attention 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.750
 the canters are going to make them small and then 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.390
 wish she can counter 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.329
 very good it was a very heavy one 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.770
 difficult delivery which he had goals of HR 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.300
 CV also caught just the right moments and 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.739
 just before rest and just after rest that is 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.690
 then a big bang indeed that she 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.150
 can hand out well so look it 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.830
 it is an annoying moment because you 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.299
 then at some point just before resting 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.369
 you have no more time 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.799
 in the first half to correct and 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.830
 yes you can still go to rest 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.270
 correct the and moments but then 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.909
 rise and then you have to go twice as fast 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.720
 I always say if you work one or for 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.159
 state 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.290
 they must go double heart and go 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.700
 walk let them walk and then they can 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.170
 We take it easy but now it was 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.520
 inverted world 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.860
 yes one thing you say it was all 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.450
 not effective but about hard work 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.040
 spoken that he wants it done yes 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.140
 that comes that is these guys look it is 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.579
 a very talented group really a whole 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.810
 good group I give my compliments 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.670
 to them all 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.420
 his fantastically driven train well 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.909
 and it sometimes there is just a lot of fun 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.009
 actually against marline even if you are with 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.770
 sees his images where we take them here 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.119
 also on and then think of all those that 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.470
 miss opportunities 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.330
 yes it's just getting used to I think 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:02.140
 the moment we score, they will stay 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:03.700
 Rolls do you see against Jessica yes 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.170
 it is a very nice fun club 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.730
 have each other with all the youngest 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.979
 on almost from Eindhoven 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:12.490
 yes that's right yes that's our vision as 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:14.200
 as an association we just want no 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:15.640
 boys from the region 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.040
 we are not a club that is all together 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.810
 is going to buy 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:24.220
 we just want a nice team of guys 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:26.170
 and next to it the friendship 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.330
 we try to put something sporty here 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.650
 and maybe there is a lot 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.300
 guys around here called themselves 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.560
 feel like animals in both of us in the 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:36.040
 youth go football so with this one 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.870
 Call the coach there for them today 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.160
 yes who who wrote it 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.480
 case booklet 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.550
 I would not know I think one of the 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.470
 I am very happy that he is 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:46.810
 he comes it is also a sign for us 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:49.470
 that he is interested 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:53.170
 perhaps in one of our players and 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:55.030
 yes it and of course has something on it 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.890
 eye and he must go to them supplements 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.940
 and I think it's one of them 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:00.700
 the youngsters are, I would perhaps 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.019
 goalkeeper who are going to sit down 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.670
 yes you now have four matches again 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:04.840
 played 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:07.810
 what do you think about being introduced to 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.310
 with Mr. the vision and the level 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.959
 well i must i must honestly say i 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.690
 I had it and we had a whole 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:16.390
 expect a heavy initial phase and surprise 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:18.850
 and thought of a spring as home quite 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:21.459
 strong and we have them happy 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:23.440
 then you get caught marlÃ¨ne 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:26.380
 and we actually have too much respect for that 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.940
 and yes what should I say 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.350
 I actually had more from van der lende 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.989
 we should have had them in the cold earlier 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:33.519
 and then a two-part but so 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:35.230
 for now you will see the difference 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:37.630
 a very dirty one between the first division 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:39.250
 the brands that guys also notice that it is entering 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:39.580
 his three and four steps are there 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.400
 between 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:43.420
 and here is the real work for this 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.820
 these guys that's just 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.080
 nice to keep working hard and and 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:49.180
 exploiting the opportunities that is perhaps 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:51.160
 the credo for the coming week yes certainly 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:52.060
 finish well until the legs are hard 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.560
 to become 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:57.060
 and then hope they are within the 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.060
 coming weeks or therein case
