think it's really important because you

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.390 
think it's really important because you
don't<00:01:16.110> have<00:01:16.170> to<00:01:16.320> apply<00:01:16.680> like<00:01:16.920> a<00:01:17.100> little<00:01:17.280> ball

darker on extra number 1 4g its bearing

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.010 
darker on extra number 1 4g its bearing
me<00:03:17.080> looks<00:03:17.530> like<00:03:17.680> that<00:03:17.890> in<00:03:18.070> the<00:03:18.190> back<00:03:18.459> and

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:21.020 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:25.510 

like<00:03:21.710> this<00:03:22.570> so<00:03:23.570> this<00:03:23.750> is<00:03:23.900> like<00:03:24.050> brown<00:03:24.710> but<00:03:25.220> with

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:08.090 
really pretty very um yeah I think I've

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:12.370 
really pretty very um yeah I think I've
designed<00:05:08.450> and<00:05:09.730> an<00:05:10.730> only<00:05:11.150> problem<00:05:11.660> is<00:05:11.840> with

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:12.380 
designed and an only problem is with

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:15.190 
designed and an only problem is with
this<00:05:12.650> um<00:05:13.000> what<00:05:14.000> I<00:05:14.030> think<00:05:14.300> everyone<00:05:14.750> has<00:05:14.990> that

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:15.200 
this um what I think everyone has that

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:18.880 
this um what I think everyone has that
with<00:05:15.440> lipsticks<00:05:15.950> for<00:05:16.610> example<00:05:17.120> if<00:05:17.330> you<00:05:17.890> use

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:18.890 
with lipsticks for example if you use

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:21.100 
with lipsticks for example if you use
this<00:05:19.100> color<00:05:19.400> you<00:05:19.910> see<00:05:20.180> this<00:05:20.480> color<00:05:20.840> at<00:05:21.080> the

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:21.110 
this color you see this color at the

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:23.409 
this color you see this color at the
back<00:05:21.530> and<00:05:21.800> it's<00:05:22.220> a<00:05:22.310> totally<00:05:22.760> different<00:05:23.180> color

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:23.419 
back and it's a totally different color

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:25.839 
back and it's a totally different color
do<00:05:23.660> i<00:05:23.690> put<00:05:24.050> it<00:05:24.140> on<00:05:24.320> of<00:05:24.530> like<00:05:24.830> open<00:05:25.250> it<00:05:25.340> and<00:05:25.490> just

but<00:05:26.689> there<00:05:26.899> are<00:05:26.929> tests<00:05:27.409> and<00:05:27.589> so<00:05:27.679> you<00:05:27.740> can<00:05:27.949> just

00:05:27.999 --> 00:05:28.009 
but there are tests and so you can just

00:05:28.009 --> 00:05:30.999 
but there are tests and so you can just
yet<00:05:28.490> tested<00:05:28.699> out<00:05:28.969> in<00:05:28.999> the<00:05:29.209> drugstore<00:05:29.509> but<00:05:30.469> like
