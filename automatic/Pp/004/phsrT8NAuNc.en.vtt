00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.430
 practice at home seven times and once 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:11.820
 do it right in the campaign I am Alexey 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:14.130
 talk about the rope about the ropes we will 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.859
 speak a little bit differently 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:20.070
 a review of the ropes is not a review of their composition as their 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:22.320
 do and so on it later in the meantime I want 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.699
 tell and show about very comfortable and 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.130
 the right way 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:29.010
 picking up the rope and this way 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.529
 suitable for almost any rope 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.079
 well, at least here I have everything at home 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.600
 ropes rap cord and thin even me 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.719
 the wires from the extension cords are stored exactly 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.530
 in this way I don't remember I won't lie 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:45.300
 how exactly is this method called 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.460
 rutting how exactly this node is called 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.250
 well release about sightings 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:55.710
 write without preparation here but 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:59.760
 it looks like this 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:07.530
 then the moon bay ropes squid so 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:11.970
 called here 's the advantage of such 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:14.850
 the bay wasted them in vain like this: 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.560
 the advantage of such a bay she holds 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.240
 the rope 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.490
 correct right half rings 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.250
 so you just need to throw this one 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.810
 part and the rope itself is discharged that is 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.170
 you can't throw somewhere in 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:30.119
 cave oak canyon off a cliff and she doesn't 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.119
 will get confused in flight times will return in 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:42.990
 full rope now i will try 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:45.450
 I show him a coil and a rope 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.520
 unwind at least a searched 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.130
 I hope that on the video she does not unwind 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:53.009
 confuses in general it gets confused very 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:57.590
 rarely it if it stripped wrong 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:02:00.740
 this is an important point we have a rope 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:05.790
 rushed the noose 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:07.710
 unfolded deliver if the length 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:11.240
 there was more you would see as a rope 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.240
 would completely turn around 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.850
 There are two ways to collect this. 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:24.100
 the rope 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:27.090
 i'm right handed so shown on right hand 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:30.250
 method 1 cove into it on hand 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:32.890
 you need to decide how long 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:35.070
 snot at squid you need me 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:39.520
 I prefer to do something along the length of the arm 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:42.670
 take the rope pull on elongated 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:46.420
 we begin to fold the arm in this way 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.280
 I rub not specifically long tail 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:50.230
 ropes 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.360
 it is better to do it in gloves but 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.610
 in principle and without gloves if not 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:03:01.030
 hurry rope hands burn not 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:03.850
 will be at a certain skill level you 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:08.050
 it can be done very quickly and 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:13.180
 most importantly all the rings legs will lie 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:20.280
 exactly and so did not stay a small tail 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:24.120
 that's what we do next we take 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:28.390
 squid and suga 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:30.670
 we wrap further we have better 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:31.239
 two or three turns are no longer necessary 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:36.120
 this 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:39.570
 that's enough further we miss 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:43.570
 tail loop 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:50.780
 inside the ring here I have my fingers 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:53.780
 and pushing now I'll come over here 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:57.910
 it turned out that we have a loop from the tail 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.910
 I will push you into the loop from the squid rings 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:04.240
 Throw in and tighten all the bay is ready 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:12.590
 one ring is crooked a little all the rest 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:14.660
 exactly well get up here and again 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:16.010
 very convenient if you require 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:18.139
 hang this rope 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:20.840
 for example on a nail you can safely 

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:23.300
 hang here either tie 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:25.970
 originally the eight at the end and 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:29.000
 administer for eight the second way 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:31.370
 slipping which is called self 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.110
 The advantages of this method are that you 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:36.860
 how can a sedan to wind much 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:39.110
 more rope than 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:41.660
 hand but my hand turns out 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:44.150
 collect 1 bay of 100 meters one hundred 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:46.100
 Twenty longer hands would not suffice 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:48.290
 plus there is such a decent weight and 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:50.870
 constantly pulls it hard and 

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:53.450
 inconvenient for yourself you can at least three hundred 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:55.400
 half a kilometer wind up nothing 

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:58.910
 you especially will not but minus this 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:03.979
 ways if the rope is dirty you are 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:05.960
 will be dirty actually well I 

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:11.160
 I will say right away that I rarely use it 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:16.890
 way therefore 

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:21.150
 I have much less skill given 

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:25.920
 ways of picking up the rope i just don't 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:30.530
 I love here therefore most likely rings at 

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:34.130
 I do not get at all though here they are 

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:34.130
 much easier to control 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:45.150
 Well, in principle, here's a straight rope gay 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:56.280
 me rings turned out squid groom 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:58.140
 I sew what I wind like before 

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:04.100
 the island's big tail therefore had to 

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:07.230
 do a lot of turnover push the loop 

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:14.910
 throw a loop in the loop 

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:17.160
 and tighten squid ready it is extremely 

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:19.740
 convenient way to coil rope 

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:22.200
 all other ways that I 

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:23.820
 tried no less comfortable less 

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:26.450
 safer and rope most often 

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:30.020
 confused strongly recommend 

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:33.240
 use this way 

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:34.710
 work out his home for training with 

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:36.180
 in time you will do it 

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:39.540
 automatically view 

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:41.310
 saw the rope coiled subscribe 

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:46.220
 on the channel put huskies tell 

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:46.220
 friends i'm alexey your 

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:54.710
 this 

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:57.810
 not
