00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.870
Hello wwwhatsnew family! In the video
Today we will make a small compilation

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:10.180
the latest and juiciest rumors
one of the most anticipated end of this 2015

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:12.860
Samsung Galaxy S6
Here we go!

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:19.760
First we must talk about its design,
something that is taking much interest in

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.410
last days and even more since leaked
that at CES 2015 just was shown to

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:28.610
a small group of partners. It is said that
have incorporated many metal components

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:34.710
Outdoor design and even mentioned
it would be possible to move to a housing unybody,

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.339
something I see as unlikely lose
very valued by users, the fact

00:00:39.339 --> 00:00:44.010
remove the battery power. Furthermore,
as to the possible inclusion of materials

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.989
metal, it may not be done in all
the back cover, but simply be added

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.089
some decorative parts, as in the case
adding them to the entire lid could harm

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:57.089
both chilling and its coverage.

00:00:57.089 --> 00:01:01.949
Secondly we need to talk performance,
which seems to be quite standardized

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.420
terms of performance for high-end
this year. 64-bit processor snapdragon

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:14.200
810 that incorporates 8-core 2.8GHz, accompanied
a RAM that is likely to remain

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:19.990
in 3GB more than enough. Some say
could reach if 4GB

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.619
eventually incorporate some technology
that requires such a screen

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:28.350
4K, but seems not too likely.

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.880
Precisely on the screen we can say
with great confidence that will stay in the

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.280
more than enough 5.5 "and a resolution
of QuadHD.

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.000
And we continue discussing his camera. In this
case seems to be a logical evolution

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.509
and 20MP rear camera is mounted
and a 5MP front. Surely keep

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:52.700
its Ultrafast approach will improve
sensor, principally in

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.710
low light, and provide opportunities for
record with more frames per second. Of

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.590
thus allow better slow motions.

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.119
As for the battery, has not said anything
as often happens when the first are uncovered

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:11.120
rumors, but hopefully this year
Big brands give a significant leap and start

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.420
see terminal with 3 or 4 days of autonomy,
will have to wait ...

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.470
And pass last one aspect
it has cheered more we know. TouchWiz has

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:26.870
been redesigned from scratch. Finally Samsung
has realized that overloading the terminal

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.830
with its interface, limiting performance
its top devices. It seems that this

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.780
new customization so pretty released
and we can finally see corrected one of the

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.420
biggest complaints from users.

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:43.640
And before we parted, commenting that in total
Galaxy S6 security will be presented in

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.870
Mobile World Congress and we we will
there and cover in Samsung event in

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.570
first person, so if you are not yet
signed, do not hesitate to do so to be

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:58.190
attentive to everything that has to do with this
terminal and other technological innovations.

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.260
And that's it, forget not give the like
and share this video with your friends.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:03.480
Until next time!

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:05.820
