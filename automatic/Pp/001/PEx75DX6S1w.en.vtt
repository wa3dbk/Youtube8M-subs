that last question it takes
investigation<00:01:36.150> it<00:01:37.020> takes<00:01:37.259> a<00:01:37.350> neurologist<00:01:37.890> and

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
investigation it takes a neurologist and

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.640 
investigation it takes a neurologist and
it<00:01:38.220> takes<00:01:38.400> a<00:01:38.520> psychiatrist<00:01:39.240> or<00:01:39.329> psychologist

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:39.650 
it takes a psychiatrist or psychologist

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.050 
it takes a psychiatrist or psychologist
to<00:01:40.650> determine<00:01:41.130> whether<00:01:41.159> somebody<00:01:41.759> is<00:01:41.820> like

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
to determine whether somebody is like

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.490 
to determine whether somebody is like
committing<00:01:42.450> a<00:01:42.540> crime<00:01:42.840> whether<00:01:43.290> they're

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
committing a crime whether they're

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.830 
committing a crime whether they're

they just cannot help themselves and

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.240 
they just cannot help themselves and
they<00:01:49.170> have<00:01:49.290> a<00:01:49.320> genuine<00:01:49.799> psychological

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.280 
boils down to whether something it's not
a<00:03:43.660> moral<00:03:43.989> issue<00:03:44.140> it's<00:03:44.320> one<00:03:44.470> of<00:03:44.590> empathy<00:03:45.070> um<00:03:46.290> so

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
a moral issue it's one of empathy um so

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:52.500 
a moral issue it's one of empathy um so
for<00:03:47.800> example<00:03:50.250> being<00:03:51.250> gay<00:03:51.670> requires<00:03:52.270> no

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
for example being gay requires no

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:54.780 
for example being gay requires no
empathy<00:03:52.870> because<00:03:53.320> it<00:03:53.770> does<00:03:53.980> not<00:03:54.010> if<00:03:54.370> I<00:03:54.489> choose

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
empathy because it does not if I choose

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:56.460 
empathy because it does not if I choose
to<00:03:54.910> be<00:03:55.030> gay<00:03:55.060> that<00:03:55.450> does<00:03:55.600> not<00:03:55.750> affect<00:03:56.200> other

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.470 
to be gay that does not affect other

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:59.370 
to be gay that does not affect other
people<00:03:57.420> if<00:03:58.420> I<00:03:58.600> genetically<00:03:59.200> have<00:03:59.350> a

00:03:59.370 --> 00:03:59.380 
people if I genetically have a

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:01.949 
people if I genetically have a
predisposition<00:03:59.769> to<00:04:00.640> like<00:04:00.850> broccoli<00:04:01.300> whereas

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:01.959 
predisposition to like broccoli whereas

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:03.630 
predisposition to like broccoli whereas
some<00:04:02.200> people<00:04:02.470> taste<00:04:02.709> in<00:04:02.860> like<00:04:02.980> oh<00:04:03.100> god<00:04:03.340> I<00:04:03.370> can't

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:03.640 
some people taste in like oh god I can't

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.759 
some people taste in like oh god I can't
handle<00:04:04.000> it<00:04:04.090> again<00:04:04.330> that<00:04:04.540> no<00:04:04.780> one's<00:04:04.959> dying<00:04:05.290> or

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:05.769 
handle it again that no one's dying or

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:07.259 
handle it again that no one's dying or
being<00:04:05.800> hurt<00:04:06.250> because<00:04:06.430> of<00:04:06.610> that<00:04:06.820> and<00:04:06.970> another

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:07.269 
being hurt because of that and another

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:09.120 
being hurt because of that and another
perfect<00:04:07.810> example<00:04:07.900> even<00:04:08.739> though<00:04:08.830> this<00:04:08.950> has

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.130 
perfect example even though this has

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:10.259 
perfect example even though this has
nothing<00:04:09.459> to<00:04:09.519> do<00:04:09.640> with<00:04:09.760> the<00:04:09.850> choice<00:04:10.060> or

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:10.269 
nothing to do with the choice or

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:13.080 
nothing to do with the choice or
preference<00:04:10.690> or<00:04:10.840> even<00:04:11.830> taste<00:04:12.100> um<00:04:12.340> asparagus

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.090 
preference or even taste um asparagus

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:15.660 
preference or even taste um asparagus
for<00:04:13.660> some<00:04:13.870> reason<00:04:14.350> people<00:04:14.950> not<00:04:15.220> to<00:04:15.310> be<00:04:15.430> crass

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:15.670 
for some reason people not to be crass

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:18.000 
for some reason people not to be crass
but<00:04:16.419> if<00:04:16.660> you<00:04:16.780> eat<00:04:17.019> asparagus<00:04:17.560> there's<00:04:17.950> a

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.010 
but if you eat asparagus there's a

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:19.440 
but if you eat asparagus there's a
percentage<00:04:18.459> of<00:04:18.549> the<00:04:18.609> population<00:04:19.000> that<00:04:19.269> when

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:19.450 
percentage of the population that when

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:22.080 
percentage of the population that when
they<00:04:19.570> urinate<00:04:19.750> later<00:04:20.320> it<00:04:21.190> smells<00:04:21.640> like<00:04:21.820> sulfur

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
they urinate later it smells like sulfur

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:24.120 
they urinate later it smells like sulfur
and<00:04:22.330> I<00:04:22.510> probably<00:04:23.140> one<00:04:23.500> of<00:04:23.530> those<00:04:23.680> people<00:04:24.040> I'm

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
and I probably one of those people I'm

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:25.440 
and I probably one of those people I'm
like<00:04:24.250> what<00:04:24.430> the<00:04:24.460> hell<00:04:24.790> is<00:04:24.880> that<00:04:24.910> I<00:04:25.120> looked<00:04:25.360> it

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:25.450 
like what the hell is that I looked it

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:26.880 
like what the hell is that I looked it
up<00:04:25.510> on<00:04:25.630> my<00:04:25.720> god<00:04:25.960> there's<00:04:26.320> like<00:04:26.500> a<00:04:26.530> certain

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:26.890 
up on my god there's like a certain

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:28.860 
up on my god there's like a certain
percentage<00:04:27.370> again<00:04:28.090> I<00:04:28.180> didn't<00:04:28.419> choose<00:04:28.660> this

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:28.870 
percentage again I didn't choose this

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:30.960 
percentage again I didn't choose this
but<00:04:29.290> you<00:04:29.380> know<00:04:29.500> ain't<00:04:29.860> nobody<00:04:30.070> dying<00:04:30.640> because

not affect other people and then this
gets<00:04:56.449> back<00:04:56.690> to<00:04:56.750> the<00:04:56.900> original<00:04:57.349> debate<00:04:57.650> of

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:57.800 
gets back to the original debate of

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:59.559 
gets back to the original debate of
whether<00:04:57.889> it<00:04:58.159> was<00:04:58.280> on<00:04:58.460> purpose<00:04:58.669> or<00:04:59.060> was<00:04:59.240> it<00:04:59.419> were

00:04:59.559 --> 00:04:59.569 
whether it was on purpose or was it were

00:04:59.569 --> 00:05:01.689 
whether it was on purpose or was it were
they<00:04:59.720> really<00:05:00.110> compelled<00:05:00.590> by<00:05:00.800> voices<00:05:01.400> in<00:05:01.580> their

00:05:01.689 --> 00:05:01.699 
they really compelled by voices in their

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:05.950 
they really compelled by voices in their
heads<00:05:03.250> so<00:05:04.250> that's<00:05:04.550> that's<00:05:04.940> the<00:05:05.419> the<00:05:05.720> drawing

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:05.960 
heads so that's that's the the drawing

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:07.839 
heads so that's that's the the drawing
line<00:05:06.169> so<00:05:06.379> it's<00:05:07.009> one<00:05:07.250> thing<00:05:07.460> where<00:05:07.729> your
