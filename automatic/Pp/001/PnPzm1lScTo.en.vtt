00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
design it all together and then we check

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.589 
design it all together and then we check
it<00:02:48.989> performance-based<00:02:49.980> design<00:02:50.220> allows<00:02:50.970> us<00:02:51.269> if

so<00:04:34.230> significant<00:04:35.040> that<00:04:35.310> it<00:04:35.850> really<00:04:36.060> makes<00:04:36.360> you

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:36.510 
so significant that it really makes you

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:38.780 
so significant that it really makes you
think<00:04:36.540> twice<00:04:37.050> about<00:04:37.130> what<00:04:38.130> you<00:04:38.250> put<00:04:38.400> down<00:04:38.580> on

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:38.790 
think twice about what you put down on

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:54.550 
think twice about what you put down on
paper

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:54.560 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.140 

everything<00:04:55.560> in<00:04:55.710> at<00:04:55.830> work<00:04:56.010> there's<00:04:56.910> minimal

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:57.150 
everything in at work there's minimal

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:58.640 
everything in at work there's minimal
damage<00:04:57.360> to<00:04:57.750> the<00:04:57.960> inside<00:04:58.320> of<00:04:58.440> the<00:04:58.500> building

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:58.650 
damage to the inside of the building

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:00.379 
damage to the inside of the building
minimal<00:04:59.370> damage<00:04:59.520> to<00:04:59.760> the<00:04:59.850> outside<00:04:59.970> of<00:05:00.240> the

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:00.389 
minimal damage to the outside of the

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:04.340 
minimal damage to the outside of the
building<00:05:00.540> I<00:05:02.360> would<00:05:03.360> say<00:05:03.540> that<00:05:03.750> this<00:05:03.870> testing

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:04.350 
building I would say that this testing

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:05.750 
building I would say that this testing
really<00:05:04.800> does<00:05:04.979> validate<00:05:05.550> the

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:05.760 
really does validate the

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:07.640 
really does validate the
performance-based<00:05:06.240> design<00:05:06.650> concept

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:07.650

involved<00:05:10.979> in<00:05:11.070> this<00:05:11.160> project<00:05:11.430> it's<00:05:12.180> phenomenal

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:12.930 
involved in this project it's phenomenal

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:14.870 
involved in this project it's phenomenal
that<00:05:12.960> we<00:05:13.229> can<00:05:13.380> have<00:05:13.560> a<00:05:13.590> test<00:05:13.949> of<00:05:14.130> this<00:05:14.250> size<00:05:14.550> and

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:14.880 
that we can have a test of this size and

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.760 
that we can have a test of this size and
magnitude<00:05:15.060> of<00:05:15.540> a<00:05:15.600> building<00:05:15.960> like<00:05:16.110> this<00:05:16.320> and

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:16.770 
magnitude of a building like this and

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:19.010 
magnitude of a building like this and
actually<00:05:16.889> get<00:05:17.220> some<00:05:17.460> real<00:05:17.669> test<00:05:18.060> data<00:05:18.360> since

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:19.020 
actually get some real test data since

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:20.240 
actually get some real test data since
you<00:05:19.139> never<00:05:19.260> forgets<00:05:19.710> and<00:05:19.949> they're<00:05:20.040> always

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:20.250 
you never forgets and they're always

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:22.760 
you never forgets and they're always
trying<00:05:20.910> to<00:05:21.090> make<00:05:21.240> sure<00:05:21.270> that<00:05:21.570> they're<00:05:21.780> really

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:22.770 
trying to make sure that they're really

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:24.770 
trying to make sure that they're really
providing<00:05:23.699> what<00:05:24.389> the<00:05:24.479> structural

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:24.780 
providing what the structural

with<00:05:28.500> taking<00:05:29.280> that<00:05:29.370> extra<00:05:29.580> step<00:05:29.729> to<00:05:30.000> really

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:30.150 
with taking that extra step to really

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:32.510 
with taking that extra step to really
know<00:05:30.540> that<00:05:30.570> the<00:05:31.110> science<00:05:31.500> part<00:05:31.710> of<00:05:32.040> what<00:05:32.190> we<00:05:32.310> do

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:32.520 
know that the science part of what we do

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.930 
know that the science part of what we do
it's<00:05:33.180> truly<00:05:33.630> unprecedented<00:05:34.080> what<00:05:34.680> they've

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:34.940 
it's truly unprecedented what they've

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:38.090 
it's truly unprecedented what they've
done<00:05:35.940> today<00:05:36.180> I<00:05:36.540> think<00:05:36.990> this<00:05:37.229> is<00:05:37.410> really<00:05:37.530> it's

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:38.100 
done today I think this is really it's

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:40.879 
done today I think this is really it's
truly<00:05:38.430> about<00:05:38.490> saving<00:05:39.030> lives<00:05:39.210> and<00:05:39.889> information

00:05:40.879 --> 00:05:40.889 
truly about saving lives and information

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:42.710 
truly about saving lives and information
that's<00:05:41.040> been<00:05:41.310> generated<00:05:42.030> as<00:05:42.180> a<00:05:42.210> result<00:05:42.570> of
