guys<00:01:45.560> use<00:01:46.560> in<00:01:47.040> German<00:01:47.460> volume<00:01:47.640> training

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
guys use in German volume training

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.139 
guys use in German volume training
systems<00:01:48.960> there<00:01:49.680> are<00:01:49.860> a<00:01:49.920> couple<00:01:50.130> things<00:01:50.520> that<00:01:51.000> I

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
systems there are a couple things that I

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.260 
systems there are a couple things that I
have<00:01:51.450> seen<00:01:51.689> that<00:01:51.750> cause<00:01:52.200> guys<00:01:52.590> to<00:01:53.009> file<00:01:53.640> a<00:01:53.880> fall

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
have seen that cause guys to file a fall

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.300 
have seen that cause guys to file a fall
away<00:01:54.479> from<00:01:54.659> German<00:01:55.320> volume<00:01:55.439> training<00:01:55.649> very

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
away from German volume training very

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.870 
away from German volume training very
quickly<00:01:56.670> that<00:01:57.600> has<00:01:57.869> caused<00:01:58.200> me<00:01:58.619> or<00:01:59.070> inspired

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
quickly that has caused me or inspired

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.450 
quickly that has caused me or inspired
me<00:02:00.119> to<00:02:00.360> create<00:02:00.570> my<00:02:01.049> own<00:02:01.079> variation<00:02:01.829> called

me to create my own variation called
massive<00:02:03.030> volume<00:02:03.420> training<00:02:03.840> now<00:02:04.710> I'm<00:02:04.829> not

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
massive volume training now I'm not

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.429

shoulder traps and calves day so you

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.180 
shoulder traps and calves day so you

sixty seconds of rest in between sets so

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:47.820 
sixty seconds of rest in between sets so
it's<00:04:46.449> a<00:04:46.570> it's<00:04:46.840> a<00:04:46.960> little<00:04:47.139> bit<00:04:47.289> different<00:04:47.740> from

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:47.830 
it's a it's a little bit different from

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:50.790 
it's a it's a little bit different from
German<00:04:48.250> volume<00:04:48.370> training<00:04:48.610> the<00:04:49.479> basically<00:04:50.080> my

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:57.060 
variation I try to I try to try to
create<00:04:55.150> a<00:04:55.240> system<00:04:55.479> that<00:04:55.690> would<00:04:56.020> minimize<00:04:56.710> the

the<00:05:00.669> muscle<00:05:01.030> building<00:05:01.300> impact<00:05:01.870> I<00:05:02.199> wanted<00:05:03.070> to

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:03.130 
the muscle building impact I wanted to

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:04.320 
the muscle building impact I wanted to
create<00:05:03.310> a<00:05:03.340> system<00:05:03.580> that<00:05:03.880> would<00:05:04.000> still<00:05:04.300> allow

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:04.330 
create a system that would still allow

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:07.200 
create a system that would still allow
you<00:05:04.570> to<00:05:04.810> build<00:05:05.229> a<00:05:05.410> lot<00:05:05.590> of<00:05:05.770> muscle<00:05:06.160> reduce<00:05:06.940> the

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:07.210 
you to build a lot of muscle reduce the

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:09.680 
you to build a lot of muscle reduce the
Dom's<00:05:07.479> or<00:05:07.780> muscle<00:05:08.169> soreness<00:05:08.410> a<00:05:08.710> little<00:05:09.070> bit

Dom's or muscle soreness a little bit

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:13.430 
Dom's or muscle soreness a little bit
and<00:05:10.690> just<00:05:11.620> insert<00:05:12.280> a<00:05:12.340> little<00:05:12.580> bit<00:05:12.789> of<00:05:12.910> exercise

and just insert a little bit of exercise

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:16.320 
and just insert a little bit of exercise
variation<00:05:14.490> basically<00:05:15.490> I<00:05:15.520> wanted<00:05:15.940> to<00:05:16.030> create<00:05:16.270> a

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:16.330 
variation basically I wanted to create a

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.960 
variation basically I wanted to create a
program<00:05:16.630> that<00:05:17.020> would<00:05:17.199> allow<00:05:17.530> you<00:05:17.590> to<00:05:18.010> to<00:05:18.610> run

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:18.970 
program that would allow you to to run

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:22.290 
program that would allow you to to run
it<00:05:19.180> a<00:05:19.360> little<00:05:19.660> bit<00:05:19.840> longer<00:05:20.340> than<00:05:21.340> German

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:22.300 
it a little bit longer than German

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:23.969 
it a little bit longer than German
volume<00:05:22.419> training<00:05:22.690> some<00:05:23.320> program<00:05:23.680> you<00:05:23.830> could

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:23.979 
volume training some program you could

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:26.129 
volume training some program you could
stay<00:05:24.190> on<00:05:24.340> as<00:05:24.550> long<00:05:24.849> as<00:05:24.880> you<00:05:25.180> wanted<00:05:25.690> to<00:05:25.870> if<00:05:26.080> you

00:05:26.129 --> 00:05:26.139 
stay on as long as you wanted to if you

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:29.189 
stay on as long as you wanted to if you
liked<00:05:26.770> this<00:05:26.979> style<00:05:27.250> of<00:05:27.460> training<00:05:27.759> and<00:05:28.599> I<00:05:28.930> also

00:05:29.189 --> 00:05:29.199 
liked this style of training and I also

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:32.159 
liked this style of training and I also
I<00:05:29.710> also<00:05:30.520> tried<00:05:31.030> to<00:05:31.060> infuse<00:05:31.419> a<00:05:31.479> little<00:05:31.660> bit<00:05:31.900> more

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:32.169 
I also tried to infuse a little bit more

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:36.390 
I also tried to infuse a little bit more
exercise<00:05:32.789> variation<00:05:33.789> so<00:05:34.570> you<00:05:35.349> know<00:05:35.470> you<00:05:36.010> you

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:36.400 
exercise variation so you know you you

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:38.520 
exercise variation so you know you you
wouldn't<00:05:36.639> get<00:05:36.820> as<00:05:36.970> bored<00:05:37.360> as<00:05:37.630> quickly<00:05:38.080> running

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:38.530 
wouldn't get as bored as quickly running

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:40.710 
wouldn't get as bored as quickly running

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:57.550 
something like squats and hack squats so

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:59.909 
something like squats and hack squats so
you<00:05:57.639> alternate<00:05:58.240> the<00:05:58.270> secondary<00:05:59.229> movement<00:05:59.740> in

00:05:59.909 --> 00:05:59.919 
you alternate the secondary movement in

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:02.040 
you alternate the secondary movement in
