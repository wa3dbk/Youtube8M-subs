00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.900
 let's see the features speak 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.990
 main good we're still going to see 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.960
 how the phone looks 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.720
 we're going to take it out of its plastic sleeve 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:23.140
 protective and let's see the main 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.850
 characteristics 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.860
 at the top we have the 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:30.040
 connector for headphones 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:33.340
 on the right side we have the button 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:35.110
 large that is the volume the button of the 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.240
 medium that is worth so much to turn off and 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.670
 turn on the phone to lock 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.360
 the screen and the last button that is 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.910
 to connect the camera 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:48.510
 in the bottom part we have the connector 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:51.330
 for micro usb and speaker 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:53.550
 and now we are going to enter the team 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.270
 and while we say some features 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:57.700
 in the zone tone 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:01.030
 we have the 8 megapixel camera with 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:05.350
 Carl Zeiss screen 4.2 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:09.489

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:18.150
 8 GB expandable with micro SD 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.860
 and now let's make a comparison 

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:26.300
 with the 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:30.170
 rain 800 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:31.750
 The Lumia 800 has a 3.7 screen 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:35.290
 inches 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:38.590
 and the 820 of 4.3 inches as we have already 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:42.450
 said before the new model also 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:46.150
 has an nfc chip and dlna technology 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:48.390
 and the possibility of activating the load 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.390
 wireless 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:54.080
 as the camera in both models in the 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.840
 the difference itself 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:59.590
 he has it in the video recording the 820 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.590
 h 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:10.940
 he does it in full hd and the 720 did it to 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:10.940
 720p is 700 800 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:20.990
 I continue with feature 800 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:24.500
 dual-core processor at 1.5 gb in 

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:26.930
 change of the 800 the descendant s the 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:32.049
 120 births 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:32.049
 it does so with a core of 1.4 gigabytes 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:49.700
 this feature will what 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:52.770
 we go as far as the 800 memory 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:58.800
 has an internal memory of 16 gb 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:04:01.440
 the 800 in the three hundred and one 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:04.070
 16 GB memory without being able to expand with 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:07.620
 memory cards instead the 820 

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:09.420
 It has 8 gigs and if it has a slot for 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:12.080
 memory card that can put 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.080
 up to 30 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:18.660
 the operating system that will give you the 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:21.570
 800 number that will be as much the 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:25.800
 windows phone 7 with 8 while with 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:28.650
 the 820 is already incorporated windows 8 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:30.840
 and good until here the characteristics 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:35.300
 principal of the two teams are very 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:35.300
 good but the 820 much more modern 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:40.460
 and really all friends 

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:48.630
 I forgot you can follow us in the 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:52.770
 facebook and twitter social networks 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:55.970
 youtube and on our web gmail.com up 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:55.970
 the next stop 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:09.650
 the new Nokia Lumia 220 of the 520 plus 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:23.940
 beige has the edges very well and good 

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:27.380
 The main features are not 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:27.380
 let's see what they bring home 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:53.240
 these are the indications of how 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:53.240
 they talk about headphones 

00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:00.409
 and he 

00:05:57.409 --> 00:06:00.409
 transformed 

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:08.090
 and besides I do not look for more because although 

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:10.960
 I'm reviewing more and there you have the 

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:10.960
 network horse 

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:15.720
 and the charger
