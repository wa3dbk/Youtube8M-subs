00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
was rated 87 now 86 and I thought well

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:43.980 
was rated 87 now 86 and I thought well
he's<00:02:42.670> played<00:02:42.910> great<00:02:43.120> i'm<00:02:43.270> not<00:02:43.300> gonna<00:02:43.540> lie<00:02:43.750> but

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:43.990 
he's played great i'm not gonna lie but

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:45.990 
he's played great i'm not gonna lie but
he's<00:02:44.140> not<00:02:44.410> really<00:02:44.710> worth<00:02:45.130> a<00:02:45.340> he<00:02:45.490> said<00:02:45.820> when<00:02:45.940> I

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
he's not really worth a he said when I

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.520 
he's not really worth a he said when I
don't<00:02:46.210> think<00:02:46.480> I<00:02:46.600> think<00:02:46.750> that's<00:02:46.900> maybe<00:02:47.080> just<00:02:47.440> a

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
don't think I think that's maybe just a

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.230 
don't think I think that's maybe just a
little<00:02:47.740> bit<00:02:47.920> too<00:02:48.130> far<00:02:48.340> you<00:02:48.760> don't<00:02:48.940> see<00:02:49.090> any

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:49.240 
little bit too far you don't see any

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.030 
little bit too far you don't see any
right<00:02:49.480> back<00:02:49.660> to<00:02:49.810> even<00:02:49.990> competing<00:02:50.740> with<00:02:50.890> him

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 
right back to even competing with him

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.620 
right back to even competing with him
and<00:02:51.280> those<00:02:51.490> ratings<00:02:51.880> and<00:02:52.090> I<00:02:52.180> think<00:02:52.390> some

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
and those ratings and I think some

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.020 
and those ratings and I think some
robots<00:02:53.290> can<00:02:53.560> compete<00:02:53.920> with<00:02:53.980> him<00:02:54.220> on<00:02:54.430> actual

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
robots can compete with him on actual

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:57.120 
robots can compete with him on actual
class<00:02:55.270> in<00:02:55.570> real<00:02:55.750> words<00:02:55.960> were<00:02:56.200> real<00:02:56.770> world

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
class in real words were real world

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:59.280 
class in real words were real world
