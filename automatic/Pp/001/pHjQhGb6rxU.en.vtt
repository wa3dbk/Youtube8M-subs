00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:13.080
 ah 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.029
 hello friends i am the underworld as are the 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.579
 today we are going to analyze the picture 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.550
 most famous more emblematic but also 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:38.629
 most mysterious of the famous painter 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.629
 Diego Velazquez 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.379
 and hype 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.600
 Diego Velásquez was a Spanish painter 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:50.600
 Baroque with many paintings to his credit 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.729
 but the best known of all is the one 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.409
 let's see today the meninas also 

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:57.530
 known as the family of felipe 

00:00:54.409 --> 00:01:00.350
 fourth is his most emblematic painting but 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:02.299
 also the most mysterious of all the 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.000
 mastery of the painter is revealed 

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:06.740
 immediately however this picture 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.720
 is more known than the rest of his 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.869
 creations because it holds many 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.850
 questions that have no answer this 

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:15.830
 is perhaps one of the paintings that has 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.259
 been more times analyzed by the 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:20.179
 critics along with the mona lisa from 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:23.210
 leonardo da vinci the picture of the 

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:25.640
 meninas was completed in 1659 and in 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:27.830
 simple sight does not suggest anything but let's go 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.350
 to analyze the first thing that we all should 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.929
 understand that all the people who 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.789
 they are portrayed in this painting 

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:38.179
 they really existed are characters 

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:40.399
 historical except one this sir that 

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:42.440
 is here is the only one that has not been 

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:45.470
 found any record nor is 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:47.660
 identified simply you do not know 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.360
 who is it enough just to look at the 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:50.130
 picture 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.560
 realize that the scene turns on 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.510
 around the infanta margarita the girl 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.970
 small that is in the center of interest 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:59.820
 daughter of king felipe fourth and in that 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:02.880
 heiress moment of the crown exist at 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.530
 minus two interpretations of what is it 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.800
 that the woman on the left is 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:10.170
 making the infanta a theory affirms 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:13.020
 that the girl has just asked for water and is 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:15.690
 point of receiving it and another says that it is 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:18.450
 pointing his hands in clay to alleviate 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.730
 a disease that suffered but beyond 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.670
 of what the Infanta does the critics 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.200
 they do not agree to decide what 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.570
 is what is happening in the scene 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.959
 first we see that there is a back 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:33.360
 rectangle that contains two people 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:35.610
 they are fourth and mariana felipe 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.130
 austria the parents of the infanta 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.350
 daisy however you do not know with 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.840
 accuracy if that which is there is a 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:45.510
 picture or a mirror in the event that 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.280
 outside a mirror then velázquez and 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.770
 who is to the left of the box 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.290
 because it was included painting 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:54.840
 I would be portraying the kings that are 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.730
 posing and the infanta daisy is 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.890
 painter's workshop looking while you 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.110
 they serve water next to their hands in gredos 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.569
 another theory says that candles that is being 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.099
 painting something unknown and that 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:07.950
 Kings have just arrived 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:09.900
 That's why the Infanta looks towards us and 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.970
 only some characters do the 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.730
 reverence to kings because others 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:16.920
 they have not yet seen us arrive 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.920
 this theory has a big problem 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.720
 felipe and mariana are the same as 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.690
 Velazquez painted them in other works 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:27.150
 with the hairstyles in the same position if 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:29.459
 outside this one mirror should not be 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.440
 the other way around that's why another 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:34.019
 theory that says what you see back 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:36.810
 is a painting and that Velásquez is 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:39.209
 painting the same picture that we are 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.650
 seeing if it was like this and candles that is being 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:43.379
 painting the same picture that we are 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.849
 watching then he would be looking at 

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:47.760
 himself in the painting he is going to paint 

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:50.220
 again and again like when you put a 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:53.519
 mirror in front of another and you can see 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.989
 infinite times inception however 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:57.180
 the critics who are very people 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:58.410
 observer so they devote their lives to 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.300
 analyze pictures 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:02.760
 they noticed a very small 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:04.680
 detail that returns the validity to the 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.650
 theory they say that what is behind 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.870
 It is a mirror and not a painting if they are fixed 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.790
 in the infanta daisy and compare it 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:14.340
 with other paintings where she appears 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:16.530
 same those by Velázquez may be 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:19.540
 realize that you have the part of the 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:22.540
 Upside down hair 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:24.880
 and that tiny detail means that 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:26.920
 Velázquez is looking forward where 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:29.500
 are we because he is looking 

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:31.810
 towards a mirror and that's also why 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:34.620
 the infanta daisy is looking towards 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:34.620
 we also 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:40.550
 could not 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:48.730
 therefore absolutely all the 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.810
 picture that we have been analyzing 

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:53.780
 absolutely the whole picture that we are 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:57.620
 watching is inverted because the scene 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:59.390
 original should be upside down is for 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:01.970
 that the characters in the mirror of 

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:04.100
 back they did not look reversed because 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:06.740
 they have the effect of a mirror but two 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:09.350
 times therefore the image becomes 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:11.510
 right now the valid question that 

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:14.360
 we are doing is because candles that 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:16.490
 is it would paint everything inverted was only 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:19.250
 because he wanted to be included in the picture 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:22.190
 painting there are critics who claim 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:24.470
 that Velázquez painted the inverted picture 

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:26.960
 intentionally so that your arm 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:29.090
 appear upside down and be able to hide the 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:31.360
 fact that he was left-handed since in that 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:34.520
 time only for that characteristic 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:36.290
 they would have killed him well friends I hope that 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:38.510
 you liked this delivery and that 

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:41.180
 have learned something new about this 

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:42.950
 great painter if you have your own 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:44.660
 theory or do you want to contribute with some 

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:46.600
 comment or want to say something wants 

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:49.780
 know your opinion regarding this 

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:52.090
 you can do it down here in the box 

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:55.030
 comments at the same time I thank you 

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:57.310
 enormously your thumb up because the 

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:59.380
 truth is that it helps too much to this 

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:01.420
 channel with no more to say I send you a 

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:05.400
 hug and as always we see each other
