to get right now but yes you see here
there's<00:03:56.680> this<00:03:56.849> about<00:03:57.849> the<00:03:57.939> same<00:03:58.120> size<00:03:58.329> and

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:58.780 
there's this about the same size and

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.119 
there's this about the same size and
shape<00:03:59.290> as<00:04:00.280> the<00:04:00.340> standard<00:04:01.049> USB<00:04:02.049> mini<00:04:02.650> or<00:04:03.069> micro

00:04:03.119 --> 00:04:03.129 
shape as the standard USB mini or micro

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:05.219 
shape as the standard USB mini or micro
USB<00:04:03.849> that<00:04:04.030> you'll<00:04:04.150> plug<00:04:04.359> into<00:04:04.540> a<00:04:04.659> smart<00:04:04.959> phone

00:04:05.219 --> 00:04:05.229 
USB that you'll plug into a smart phone

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:08.969 
USB that you'll plug into a smart phone
and<00:04:05.470> on<00:04:06.280> the<00:04:06.370> side<00:04:06.609> you<00:04:06.790> have<00:04:06.879> an<00:04:06.970> extra<00:04:07.979> I'm

00:04:08.969 --> 00:04:08.979 
and on the side you have an extra I'm

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:11.339 
and on the side you have an extra I'm
guessing<00:04:09.639> it's<00:04:09.790> to<00:04:10.030> facilitate<00:04:10.659> the<00:04:10.840> extra

00:04:11.339 --> 00:04:11.349 
guessing it's to facilitate the extra

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:15.119 
guessing it's to facilitate the extra
four<00:04:11.650> pins<00:04:11.919> that<00:04:12.159> a<00:04:12.220> USB<00:04:12.930> 3<00:04:13.930> connector<00:04:14.470> has<00:04:14.650> so

00:04:15.119 --> 00:04:15.129 
four pins that a USB 3 connector has so

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:18.390 
four pins that a USB 3 connector has so
this<00:04:15.669> is<00:04:15.790> a<00:04:15.819> blue<00:04:16.060> USB<00:04:16.239> 3<00:04:16.659> connector<00:04:17.049> here<00:04:17.400> that

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 
this is a blue USB 3 connector here that

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.759 
this is a blue USB 3 connector here that
would<00:04:18.519> go<00:04:18.669> along<00:04:18.789> with<00:04:19.180> this<00:04:19.900> power<00:04:20.200> adapter

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:20.769 
would go along with this power adapter

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:22.709 
would go along with this power adapter
this<00:04:21.070> power<00:04:21.279> brick<00:04:21.609> that<00:04:21.880> will<00:04:22.060> go<00:04:22.240> on<00:04:22.419> the

00:04:22.709 --> 00:04:22.719 
this power brick that will go on the

00:04:22.719 --> 00:04:24.360 
this power brick that will go on the
back<00:04:22.960> of<00:04:23.200> the

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370 
back of the

indicator light in the front and yeah
it's<00:05:30.430> pretty<00:05:30.610> nice<00:05:30.820> Drive<00:05:31.180> it's<00:05:31.570> a<00:05:31.720> matte

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:31.960 
it's pretty nice Drive it's a matte

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:36.000 
it's pretty nice Drive it's a matte
finish<00:05:32.440> so<00:05:32.710> it's<00:05:33.490> not<00:05:33.610> like<00:05:33.849> the<00:05:34.030> old<00:05:34.680> USB<00:05:35.680> 2.0

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:36.010 
finish so it's not like the old USB 2.0

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:37.860 
finish so it's not like the old USB 2.0
seagate<00:05:36.729> drives<00:05:37.030> where<00:05:37.300> you<00:05:37.419> have<00:05:37.539> a<00:05:37.570> very

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:37.870 
seagate drives where you have a very

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:40.500 
seagate drives where you have a very
shiny<00:05:38.200> finish<00:05:39.160> that<00:05:39.610> very<00:05:39.849> shiny<00:05:40.090> finish<00:05:40.330> is

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:40.510 
shiny finish that very shiny finish is

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:43.409 
shiny finish that very shiny finish is
actually<00:05:40.660> not<00:05:40.960> very<00:05:41.200> good<00:05:41.770> because<00:05:42.360> from<00:05:43.360> my

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:43.419 
actually not very good because from my

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:45.690 
actually not very good because from my
own<00:05:43.690> experience<00:05:44.229> that<00:05:44.410> usually<00:05:44.889> attracts<00:05:45.610> a

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:45.700 
own experience that usually attracts a

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:47.219 
own experience that usually attracts a
lot<00:05:45.880> of<00:05:45.910> fingerprints<00:05:46.479> and<00:05:46.570> gets<00:05:46.750> scratched<00:05:47.020> a

00:05:47.219 --> 00:05:47.229 
lot of fingerprints and gets scratched a

00:05:47.229 --> 00:05:51.529 
lot of fingerprints and gets scratched a
