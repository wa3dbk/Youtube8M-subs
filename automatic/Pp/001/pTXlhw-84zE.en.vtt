dive into this I want to make one thing
perfectly<00:00:41.790> clear<00:00:42.239> for<00:00:43.079> my<00:00:43.170> personal<00:00:43.559> taste<00:00:43.620> I

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
perfectly clear for my personal taste I

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.470 
perfectly clear for my personal taste I
don't<00:00:44.309> have<00:00:44.399> a<00:00:44.489> single<00:00:44.760> problem<00:00:44.940> with<00:00:45.210> any<00:00:45.360> of

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
don't have a single problem with any of

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.639 
don't have a single problem with any of
the<00:00:45.570> light<00:00:45.719> sources<00:00:46.050> that<00:00:46.230> are<00:00:46.350> currently

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
the light sources that are currently

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.440 
the light sources that are currently
active<00:00:46.860> so<00:00:47.579> what<00:00:47.730> I'll<00:00:47.820> be<00:00:47.850> showing<00:00:48.120> you<00:00:48.329> is

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
active so what I'll be showing you is

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.660 
active so what I'll be showing you is
basically<00:00:48.660> both<00:00:49.079> sides<00:00:49.410> of<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.649> coin<00:00:49.860> this<00:00:50.489> is

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
basically both sides of the coin this is

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:51.950 
basically both sides of the coin this is
pretty<00:00:50.820> much<00:00:51.030> so<00:00:51.239> you<00:00:51.329> can<00:00:51.449> get<00:00:51.539> an<00:00:51.600> idea<00:00:51.660> of

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
pretty much so you can get an idea of

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.110 
pretty much so you can get an idea of
what<00:00:52.110> you<00:00:52.230> might<00:00:52.260> want<00:00:52.789> let's<00:00:53.789> start<00:00:54.030> by

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
what you might want let's start by

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.420 
what you might want let's start by
adjusting<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.660> torch<00:00:54.899> light<00:00:55.079> by<00:00:55.890> default<00:00:56.280> the

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
adjusting the torch light by default the

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.599 
adjusting the torch light by default the
value<00:00:56.550> is<00:00:56.820> set<00:00:57.000> to<00:00:57.030> 5.0<00:00:57.989> F<00:00:58.289> and<00:00:58.920> well<00:00:59.129> let's

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
value is set to 5.0 F and well let's

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:00.950 
value is set to 5.0 F and well let's
just<00:00:59.789> say<00:00:59.910> you<00:00:59.969> want<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.359> torches<00:01:00.719> to<00:01:00.840> be<00:01:00.930> a

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
just say you want the torches to be a

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.260 
just say you want the torches to be a
little<00:01:01.289> brighter<00:01:01.559> so<00:01:02.219> to<00:01:02.489> make<00:01:02.640> that<00:01:02.760> happen

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
little brighter so to make that happen

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.149 
little brighter so to make that happen
just<00:01:03.570> apply<00:01:03.809> a<00:01:03.840> higher<00:01:04.080> number<00:01:04.320> which<00:01:04.949> could

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
just apply a higher number which could

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:26.100 
just apply a higher number which could
be<00:01:05.280> something<00:01:05.580> like<00:01:05.610> 10.0<00:01:06.450> F

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.110 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:28.510 

all<00:01:27.110> right<00:01:27.229> let's<00:01:27.469> move<00:01:27.590> on<00:01:27.740> to<00:01:27.770> lava<00:01:28.039> by

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
all right let's move on to lava by

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.060 
all right let's move on to lava by
default<00:01:28.880> the<00:01:29.030> value<00:01:29.119> was<00:01:29.390> set<00:01:29.509> to<00:01:29.659> 2.6<00:01:30.380> F<00:01:30.649> which

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
default the value was set to 2.6 F which

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:32.499 
default the value was set to 2.6 F which
some<00:01:31.310> of<00:01:31.340> you<00:01:31.460> may<00:01:31.610> consider<00:01:31.909> a<00:01:32.060> little<00:01:32.360> too

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:32.509 
some of you may consider a little too

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:34.719 
some of you may consider a little too
bright<00:01:32.810> so<00:01:33.049> to<00:01:33.350> fix<00:01:33.560> this<00:01:33.740> just<00:01:33.950> apply<00:01:34.430> a<00:01:34.460> lower

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:34.729 
bright so to fix this just apply a lower

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:57.390 
bright so to fix this just apply a lower
number<00:01:35.149> of<00:01:35.299> which<00:01:35.630> will<00:01:35.840> use<00:01:36.020> 1.6<00:01:36.680> F

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:57.400 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.760 

want<00:01:57.970> to<00:01:58.060> glowstone<00:01:58.450> my<00:01:58.990> default<00:01:59.380> the<00:01:59.530> value

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
want to glowstone my default the value

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.760 
want to glowstone my default the value
is<00:01:59.890> set<00:02:00.010> to<00:02:00.040> 5.1<00:02:00.940> F<00:02:01.210> which<00:02:01.990> can<00:02:02.230> be<00:02:02.380> considered

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
is set to 5.1 F which can be considered

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.100 
is set to 5.1 F which can be considered
rather<00:02:02.890> bright<00:02:03.190> so<00:02:03.850> you<00:02:04.090> know<00:02:04.390> the<00:02:04.480> drill<00:02:04.690> is

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
rather bright so you know the drill is

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:06.930 
rather bright so you know the drill is
to<00:02:05.170> buy<00:02:05.410> a<00:02:05.440> lower<00:02:05.740> number<00:02:05.980> for<00:02:06.490> this<00:02:06.610> example

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:06.940 
to buy a lower number for this example

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:30.820 
to buy a lower number for this example
we'll<00:02:07.420> be<00:02:07.450> using<00:02:07.770> 2.1<00:02:08.770> f

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.070 

okay<00:02:31.830> on<00:02:32.069> to<00:02:32.250> fire<00:02:32.430> by<00:02:33.060> default<00:02:33.480> the<00:02:33.660> value<00:02:33.780> is

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
okay on to fire by default the value is

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.640 
okay on to fire by default the value is
set<00:02:34.260> to<00:02:34.790> 0.025<00:02:35.790> F<00:02:36.390> which<00:02:36.810> can't<00:02:37.080> be<00:02:37.230> considered

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
set to 0.025 F which can't be considered

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.470 
set to 0.025 F which can't be considered
not<00:02:37.860> bright<00:02:38.130> enough<00:02:38.160> so<00:02:38.790> let's<00:02:39.000> add<00:02:39.180> some<00:02:39.209> more

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
not bright enough so let's add some more

00:02:39.480 --> 00:03:02.780 
not bright enough so let's add some more
glow<00:02:39.930> for<00:02:40.410> this<00:02:40.560> example<00:02:40.890> we'll<00:02:41.400> use<00:02:41.600> 0.2<00:02:42.600> F

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.179 

for<00:03:03.540> this<00:03:03.659> one<00:03:03.900> will<00:03:04.200> we<00:03:04.319> adjust<00:03:04.650> in<00:03:04.769> the<00:03:04.860> glow

00:03:05.179 --> 00:03:05.189 
for this one will we adjust in the glow

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:06.979 
for this one will we adjust in the glow
of<00:03:05.220> the<00:03:05.459> torches<00:03:05.849> which<00:03:06.450> is<00:03:06.599> different<00:03:06.930> from

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
of the torches which is different from

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:09.110 
of the torches which is different from
adjusting<00:03:07.290> the<00:03:07.650> light<00:03:07.860> of<00:03:08.040> the<00:03:08.159> torches<00:03:08.400> by

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
adjusting the light of the torches by

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.229 
adjusting the light of the torches by
default<00:03:09.540> the<00:03:09.689> glow<00:03:09.870> is<00:03:10.079> set<00:03:10.260> to<00:03:10.430> 1.15<00:03:11.430> F<00:03:11.730> so

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
default the glow is set to 1.15 F so

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:13.970 
default the glow is set to 1.15 F so
might<00:03:12.420> as<00:03:12.510> well<00:03:12.629> give<00:03:12.810> it<00:03:12.840> more<00:03:13.079> light<00:03:13.290> I'm

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
might as well give it more light I'm

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:25.610 
might as well give it more light I'm
gonna<00:03:14.129> change<00:03:14.340> the<00:03:14.519> value<00:03:14.760> to<00:03:14.970> 1<00:03:15.180> point<00:03:15.540> 9<00:03:15.629> F
