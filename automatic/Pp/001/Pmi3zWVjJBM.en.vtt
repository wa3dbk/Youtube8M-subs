00:01:47.769 --> 00:01:47.779 
to the snare drum note as possible and

00:01:47.779 --> 00:01:49.989 
to the snare drum note as possible and
it<00:01:47.869> falls<00:01:48.170> in<00:01:48.469> between<00:01:48.770> the<00:01:49.249> high<00:01:49.399> hats<00:01:49.700> on

00:01:49.989 --> 00:01:49.999

three<00:01:50.779> and<00:01:51.049> then<00:01:51.529> four<00:01:51.889> so<00:01:52.159> it<00:01:52.279> falls<00:01:52.700> in

00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:52.969 
three and then four so it falls in

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:56.169 
three and then four so it falls in
between<00:01:53.209> the<00:01:54.079> three<00:01:54.380> and<00:01:54.409> the<00:01:54.590> four<00:01:54.880> so<00:01:55.880> we<00:01:55.969> get

00:01:56.169 --> 00:01:56.179 
between the three and the four so we get

00:01:56.179 --> 00:02:54.180 
between the three and the four so we get
like<00:01:56.899> this

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:04:05.509 

now<00:02:55.190> here<00:02:55.940> we<00:02:56.030> go<00:02:56.180> I<00:02:56.420> think

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:16.550 

really<00:04:06.650> spacious<00:04:07.650> its<00:04:08.420> raucous<00:04:09.420> time

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560
