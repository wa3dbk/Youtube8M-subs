00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:13.370
 how about you guys in this video I bring you 

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:15.799
 a definition diet a lot 6 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:19.130
 asked for a diet to lose weight for 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:21.800
 burn fat and here I bring you a diet 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:24.500
 of six meals but before all this 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.970
 have to say four important things that 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.880
 must be taken into account at the same time 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:31.420
 define the first time we maintain a 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:34.060
 caloric deficit 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:36.490
 the amount of food 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:39.340
 consequently the amount of 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:41.680
 kilocalories will have a lot that 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.660
 see in our fat burning in addition 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.940
 we have to fit all these 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.670
 kilocalories that we are going to consume inside 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:50.680
 of macro macronutrients 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.270
 carbohydrates proteins and fats in addition 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.370
 we have to keep in mind that we want 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:56.410
 keep the muscle is that the 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:58.390
 muscle is the metabolic furnace of 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:00.610
 body and is the one that is going to make you 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:03.070
 we want more calories because they form 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:04.530
 fundamental part of the metabolism 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.440
 basal 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.690
 the day has 24 hours we are going to 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.710
 be training on average one hour at 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.409
 day 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.540
 then the other 23 hours a day that 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.610
 we are going to have are going to be very important 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.250
 for that fat burning and definition 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.200
 muscle so the more muscle 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.659
 we have and the more muscle 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.330
 keep better are going to be our 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:31.140
 results when defining 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:33.180
 then we will see the meals I have 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.970
 gone putting has the slate that enjoys 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.830
 this diet and I have not put amounts 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.790
 because every person is a world every 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:40.500
 person 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.870
 one has can have a lot of mass 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:46.200
 muscle others more short more 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:48.220
 high constitutions I take background 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.500
 morpho month or dead 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:53.260
 each person must also have 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.570
 a few different macros and you have to 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:57.370
 adjust this diet within each 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:58.870
 That person did not put amounts 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:00.880
 and yes 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:04.240
 it seems more an idea the meals that 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:08.140
 we would put on this diet in the first 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:11.530
 chosen food does we just leave them with 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:14.980

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:41.260
 with water it cooks even we can 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:44.110

 chicken breast although we have to 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:08.600
 keep the muscle do not stop 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:11.870
 pass within the proteins either in 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:13.730
 the number 4 natural tuna food one or 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:17.540

 in the food 5 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:38.549
 more I have put it because it would be the 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:41.250
 food 5 my food then I train then 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:44.010
 I put a protein shake with a 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.730
 room ratified creatine and a 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:48.840
 teaspoon of honey 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:53.050
 for people who do not train because 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:55.090
 I do not want to consume supplements 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:58.060
 can eat that is a skim with 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:00.610
 honey the quantities equal depends on 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:03.450
 each and finally the food of 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:09.440
 number 6 cooked vegetables 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:09.440
 white fish and fresh cheese 0% fat 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:17.250
 here you see that I have put green tea and coffee 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:20.040
 the green tea of ​​coffee are drinks there 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.660
 to do between meals and I like 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:24.330
 alone between meals all green tea 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:27.060
 because green tea if you take it together 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:30.270
 a meal with protein assimilation 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:32.720
 of iron is going to be much worse like that 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:35.270
 that I prefer to eat 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:38.480
 any food of these waiting for a 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:42.110
 hang an hour even and put the tea 

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:45.310
 green states states drinks what we 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:48.790
 will give is that with us we define 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:52.370
 more and more we have the metabolism more 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:54.470
 reduced lower then the more 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:56.080
 high we have it faster we are going to go 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:58.000
 burning fat 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:02.590
 been drinking us will help them 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:04.180
 because thermogenesis increases and the 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:05.590
 metabolism so with everything you see 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:07.000
 here you can go planning our 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:09.640

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:20.410
 dried or even here at the last meal 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:23.140
 white fish instead of fish 

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:25.630
 white blue fish removes a sherwell 

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:27.790
 the egg white the yolk as 

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:31.030
 you want is more or less an idea for
