00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.640
 captiva is one of the most deserved 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:24.100
 chevrolet models on the Russian market 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:26.320
 appeared in 2006 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:28.570
 quickly conquered and start dear 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.550
 reliable and roomy family 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:33.370
 the crossover is not so long ago 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:35.680
 restyling and finally version appeared 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:39.540
 with turbodiesel or rather she was before 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:42.430
 Only in Russia and supply and feared and 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.199
 did the right thing they decided exactly 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:46.480
 I like the diesel capture version 

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:47.559
 most and even more than 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:51.100
 popova 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:53.680
 equipped with a petrol 3-liter v6 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:56.649
 the kids themselves are dynamics and the names are much worse 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:59.940
 but on one tank diesel captiva can 

00:00:56.649 --> 00:00:59.940
 drive thousands of miles 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:06.729
 design extended models become several 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:08.470
 more aggressive appeared characteristic 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:10.810
 two - story grille 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.820
 trendy lights but that's not the xenon not 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:16.830
 maybe no LEDs even for 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:18.900
 surcharge is simple but tasteful 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:22.050
 but the front bumper is low 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.730
 sports cars why aerodynamics but to 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:26.400
 scary driving up pavements 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:28.440
 Salon after restyling has not changed 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.720
 badly added metallized 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:33.000
 jewelry slightly smoothed out the shape of plastic 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.070
 but the central display which is long 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.710
 it's time to replace the navigation screen and 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.260
 callus eyes to all passengers from other 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.870
 weird huge steering wheel exactly the same 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:46.070
 It should be x but in ergonomics claims 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:48.210
 no comfortable though rustic 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:51.210
 impression of the car can be expressed in 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.200
 in a nutshell and to the salon is 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.390
 applies to the full 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.390
 simple at heart 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:02.470
 single - zone climate control but powerful in 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:04.869
 the heat cools the sun-heated interior 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:09.190
 a couple of minutes seat and front and rear 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:11.230
 full trunk almost 480 liters in Europe 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.600
 there are versions with three rows of seats 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:16.569
 however we have more respect for two rows 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:19.150
 but there are tanks under the floor if you fold 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:22.330
 rear seats trunk volume will triple 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.520
 In general, everything is like in the best houses in Europe and 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:29.190
 Philadelphia only here to mount a spare tire 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:29.190
 under the bottom it is already beyond good and evil 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:37.360
 but still the main dish is the motor 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:39.790
 power 184 force moment 400 newton 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.800
 meters and that is enough to 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.550
 very dynamic move in 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.769
 space 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:47.260
 Acceleration from a spot to a hundred does not seem to 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:49.690
 and quickly 10 seconds but the main thing is not this 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:52.320
 the nicest thing is that under the gas pedal 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:55.019
 there is always a solid stock of traction 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:58.120
 start abruptly with a traffic light in the city 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:03:01.870
 please overtake the truck on the track 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:04.769
 there is nothing against such a captiva on 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:07.540
 heavy fuel is rustic but pull 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:09.880
 when you consider how much in recent years 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.450
 increased prices from competitors can safely 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.610
 to tell 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.610
 great option for your money
