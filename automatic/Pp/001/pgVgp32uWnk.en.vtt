00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.109 
and here's the lesson hi and welcome to
my<00:00:18.539> lesson<00:00:18.779> on<00:00:19.080> editing<00:00:19.650> stroke<00:00:20.160> styles<00:00:20.850> I

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
my lesson on editing stroke styles I

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:22.880 
my lesson on editing stroke styles I
thought<00:00:21.779> I'd<00:00:21.900> just<00:00:22.050> go<00:00:22.199> through<00:00:22.470> some<00:00:22.680> of<00:00:22.740> the

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
thought I'd just go through some of the

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.029 
thought I'd just go through some of the
options<00:00:23.279> you<00:00:23.400> can<00:00:23.550> get<00:00:24.350> to<00:00:25.350> make<00:00:25.529> your<00:00:25.560> strokes

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
options you can get to make your strokes

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.550 
options you can get to make your strokes
look<00:00:26.550> a<00:00:26.640> bit<00:00:26.789> more<00:00:26.970> interesting<00:00:27.539> if<00:00:28.230> I<00:00:28.349> draw<00:00:28.500> a

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
look a bit more interesting if I draw a

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.769 
look a bit more interesting if I draw a
stroke<00:00:28.890> pencil<00:00:29.400> tool<00:00:29.580> like<00:00:29.970> so<00:00:30.240> you<00:00:30.599> can<00:00:30.630> see

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
stroke pencil tool like so you can see

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.810 
stroke pencil tool like so you can see
that<00:00:31.080> that's<00:00:31.230> a<00:00:31.529> pretty<00:00:31.769> solid<00:00:32.040> line<00:00:32.520> there

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
that that's a pretty solid line there

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.420 
that that's a pretty solid line there
it's<00:00:33.390> relatively<00:00:33.809> thin<00:00:34.170> so<00:00:34.800> I<00:00:34.829> double<00:00:35.219> click

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
it's relatively thin so I double click

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.970 
it's relatively thin so I double click
on<00:00:35.550> that<00:00:35.660> you<00:00:36.660> pull<00:00:36.870> up<00:00:36.960> my<00:00:37.110> properties<00:00:37.680> you

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
on that you pull up my properties you

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.709 
on that you pull up my properties you
can<00:00:38.100> see<00:00:38.280> I<00:00:38.309> get<00:00:38.520> a<00:00:38.550> whole<00:00:38.820> load<00:00:39.120> of<00:00:39.149> options

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
can see I get a whole load of options

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.220 
can see I get a whole load of options
down<00:00:40.020> here<00:00:40.290> so<00:00:41.129> where<00:00:41.399> it<00:00:41.460> says<00:00:41.520> stroke<00:00:42.230> like

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
down here so where it says stroke like

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.819 
down here so where it says stroke like
so<00:00:43.760> that's<00:00:44.760> how<00:00:45.059> I<00:00:45.090> control<00:00:46.050> the<00:00:46.289> stroke<00:00:46.530> size

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
so that's how I control the stroke size

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.490 
so that's how I control the stroke size
so<00:00:47.309> if<00:00:47.399> I<00:00:47.489> pull<00:00:47.760> this<00:00:48.120> all<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.539> way<00:00:48.629> up<00:00:48.750> get<00:00:49.440> a

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
so if I pull this all the way up get a

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.290 
so if I pull this all the way up get a
really<00:00:49.710> thick<00:00:49.980> stroke<00:00:50.309> or<00:00:50.850> pull<00:00:51.090> it<00:00:51.120> all<00:00:51.270> the

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
really thick stroke or pull it all the

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.779 
really thick stroke or pull it all the
way<00:00:51.390> down<00:00:51.690> to<00:00:51.989> get<00:00:52.170> a<00:00:52.199> really<00:00:52.440> thin<00:00:52.649> one<00:00:52.860> so

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
way down to get a really thin one so

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.910 
way down to get a really thin one so
let's<00:00:54.270> leave<00:00:54.420> it<00:00:54.480> relatively<00:00:55.079> thin<00:00:55.320> and<00:00:55.500> then

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
let's leave it relatively thin and then

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.939 
let's leave it relatively thin and then
explore<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:57.390> styles<00:00:57.870> down<00:00:58.170> here<00:00:58.440> and<00:00:58.680> say<00:00:58.890> so

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
explore the styles down here and say so

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.340 
explore the styles down here and say so
you<00:00:59.370> can<00:00:59.550> see<00:00:59.730> it<00:00:59.850> says<00:01:00.000> solid<00:01:00.480> at<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.020> moment

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
you can see it says solid at the moment

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.969 
you can see it says solid at the moment
if<00:01:01.440> I<00:01:01.530> change<00:01:01.800> it<00:01:01.920> from<00:01:02.039> solid<00:01:02.460> to<00:01:03.229> dotted<00:01:04.229> you

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
if I change it from solid to dotted you

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.670 
if I change it from solid to dotted you
can<00:01:05.100> see<00:01:05.339> we<00:01:05.670> get<00:01:05.790> a<00:01:05.850> dotted<00:01:06.299> line<00:01:06.350> zoom<00:01:07.350> in<00:01:07.560> on

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
can see we get a dotted line zoom in on

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:08.920 
can see we get a dotted line zoom in on
that

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:08.930 
that

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:15.590 
that
there<00:01:09.930> you<00:01:09.990> go<00:01:10.909> and<00:01:13.070> as<00:01:14.070> well<00:01:14.369> as<00:01:14.610> dotted<00:01:15.180> lines

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
there you go and as well as dotted lines

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:23.300 
there you go and as well as dotted lines
we<00:01:16.229> can<00:01:16.409> have<00:01:16.710> dashed<00:01:20.450> stippled<00:01:22.250> kind<00:01:23.250> of

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
we can have dashed stippled kind of

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.170 
we can have dashed stippled kind of
paintbrush<00:01:23.700> effect

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
paintbrush effect

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.039 
paintbrush effect
ragged<00:01:25.850> and<00:01:26.850> even<00:01:27.390> if<00:01:27.479> you've<00:01:27.659> got<00:01:27.689> it<00:01:27.930> on

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
ragged and even if you've got it on

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.370 
ragged and even if you've got it on
something<00:01:28.290> like<00:01:29.090> dotted<00:01:30.090> it'll<00:01:31.079> still<00:01:31.350> work

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
something like dotted it'll still work

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.310 
something like dotted it'll still work
in<00:01:31.950> exactly<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.640> same<00:01:32.850> way<00:01:33.030> so<00:01:33.090> you<00:01:33.390> can<00:01:33.659> pull

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
in exactly the same way so you can pull

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.770 
in exactly the same way so you can pull
it<00:01:34.350> out<00:01:34.590> and<00:01:34.770> edit<00:01:35.100> it<00:01:35.280> and<00:01:35.400> add<00:01:35.549> corners<00:01:36.240> and

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
it out and edit it and add corners and

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.020 
it out and edit it and add corners and
the<00:01:36.960> way<00:01:37.079> that<00:01:37.259> I<00:01:37.320> showed<00:01:37.530> you<00:01:37.590> in<00:01:38.070> my<00:01:38.670> lesson

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
the way that I showed you in my lesson

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.490 
the way that I showed you in my lesson
on<00:01:39.150> editing<00:01:39.689> strokes<00:01:40.590> and<00:01:40.710> fills<00:01:40.770> and<00:01:42.500> equally

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
on editing strokes and fills and equally

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.130 
on editing strokes and fills and equally
if<00:01:43.860> you<00:01:44.009> don't<00:01:44.189> click<00:01:44.430> on<00:01:44.640> it<00:01:44.700> you<00:01:45.509> can<00:01:45.540> make<00:01:45.990> it

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
if you don't click on it you can make it

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.710 
if you don't click on it you can make it
bigger<00:01:46.500> and<00:01:46.619> smaller<00:01:47.240> so<00:01:48.240> you<00:01:48.270> can<00:01:48.450> maybe<00:01:48.600> even

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
bigger and smaller so you can maybe even

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.440 
bigger and smaller so you can maybe even
do<00:01:49.020> an<00:01:49.140> animation<00:01:49.530> of<00:01:49.909> that<00:01:50.909> I<00:01:51.030> mean<00:01:51.299> that

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
do an animation of that I mean that

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.020 
do an animation of that I mean that
looks<00:01:51.630> quite<00:01:51.810> strange

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
looks quite strange

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.660 
looks quite strange
and<00:01:54.750> you<00:01:54.930> can<00:01:55.080> edit<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.410> color<00:01:55.650> either<00:01:56.280> up

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
and you can edit the color either up

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.800 
and you can edit the color either up
here<00:01:56.940> or<00:01:57.350> here<00:01:59.180> change<00:02:00.180> the<00:02:00.300> color<00:02:00.510> of<00:02:00.570> your

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
here or here change the color of your

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.500 
here or here change the color of your
stroke<00:02:01.310> so<00:02:02.310> give<00:02:02.490> it<00:02:02.520> a<00:02:02.640> go<00:02:02.820> and<00:02:03.030> make<00:02:03.360> your

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:03.510 
stroke so give it a go and make your

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:04.969 
stroke so give it a go and make your
strokes<00:02:03.870> look<00:02:04.200> a<00:02:04.320> little<00:02:04.500> bit<00:02:04.710> more

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
strokes look a little bit more

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.790 
strokes look a little bit more
interesting<00:02:05.610> I'll<00:02:05.940> see<00:02:06.120> you<00:02:06.210> next<00:02:06.270> time<00:02:06.800> hey

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:07.800 
interesting I'll see you next time hey
