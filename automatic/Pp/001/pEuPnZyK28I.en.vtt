as you talk with type and the duties
which<00:00:06.720> is<00:00:06.960> obviously<00:00:07.290> the<00:00:07.410> best<00:00:07.589> one<00:00:07.830> to<00:00:07.950> use

00:00:08.049 --> 00:00:08.059 
which is obviously the best one to use

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:10.070 
which is obviously the best one to use

make it nice and short out you go to

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.509 
make it nice and short out you go to
your<00:00:22.380> inbound<00:00:22.769> rules<00:00:23.130> and<00:00:23.550> you'll<00:00:24.359> find<00:00:24.720> your

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:25.519 
your inbound rules and you'll find your

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:27.769 
your inbound rules and you'll find your
program<00:00:26.519> should<00:00:26.789> already<00:00:27.000> be<00:00:27.090> listed<00:00:27.599> because

program should already be listed because

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.810 
program should already be listed because
it's<00:00:28.080> obviously<00:00:28.710> security<00:00:29.099> risk<00:00:29.490> and<00:00:29.640> the

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
it's obviously security risk and the

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.420 
it's obviously security risk and the
firewall<00:00:30.179> um<00:00:30.420> will<00:00:30.869> update<00:00:31.619> automatically

go to the program and you want to go to

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.790 
go to the program and you want to go to
its<00:00:35.610> properties<00:00:36.410> you<00:00:37.410> want<00:00:37.590> to<00:00:37.680> go<00:00:37.739> to

the connection what this will do is

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.720 
the connection what this will do is
it'll<00:00:50.579> block<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:50.879> UM<00:00:51.649> look<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:52.800> uploads<00:00:53.219> so

it'll block the UM look the uploads so

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.340 
it'll block the UM look the uploads so
that<00:00:53.969> no<00:00:54.600> one<00:00:54.750> will<00:00:54.840> be<00:00:54.960> able<00:00:55.079> to<00:00:57.170> see<00:00:58.170> it<00:00:58.230> off
