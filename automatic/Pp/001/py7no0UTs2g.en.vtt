map but much less on the parts ready

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:15.240 
map but much less on the parts ready
could<00:02:13.390> easily<00:02:13.810> locate<00:02:14.170> your<00:02:14.320> people<00:02:14.709> without

could easily locate your people without

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:16.970 
could easily locate your people without
getting<00:02:15.640> in<00:02:15.730> a<00:02:15.790> way<00:02:15.940> of<00:02:16.090> mining<00:02:16.540> and<00:02:16.660> drilling

getting in a way of mining and drilling
so<00:02:17.980> it<00:02:18.070> may<00:02:18.220> be<00:02:18.250> a<00:02:18.400> question<00:02:18.610> of<00:02:18.910> priorities<00:02:19.209> if

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
so it may be a question of priorities if

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.449 
so it may be a question of priorities if
you<00:02:20.050> didn't<00:02:20.320> want<00:02:20.470> to<00:02:20.590> situate<00:02:20.769> your<00:02:21.160> water

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
you didn't want to situate your water

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:23.340 
you didn't want to situate your water
right<00:02:21.730> at<00:02:21.760> the<00:02:21.970> spot<00:02:22.180> but<00:02:22.810> will<00:02:22.959> be<00:02:23.080> clean<00:02:23.320> for

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
facts about the two cities is that they

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.599 
facts about the two cities is that they
are<00:03:07.030> almost<00:03:07.480> identical<00:03:07.920> not<00:03:08.920> so<00:03:09.069> much<00:03:09.250> that<00:03:09.459> it

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:09.609 
are almost identical not so much that it

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:12.000 
are almost identical not so much that it
would<00:03:09.790> be<00:03:09.940> boring<00:03:10.150> to<00:03:10.359> play<00:03:10.510> on<00:03:10.810> hope<00:03:11.019> but<00:03:11.829> so

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
would be boring to play on hope but so

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:13.830 
would be boring to play on hope but so
close<00:03:12.310> to<00:03:12.519> it<00:03:12.579> it<00:03:13.120> might<00:03:13.390> be<00:03:13.540> the<00:03:13.629> perfect
