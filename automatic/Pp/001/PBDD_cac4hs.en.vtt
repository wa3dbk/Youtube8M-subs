00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
but anyway a great figure never thought

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.060 
but anyway a great figure never thought
much<00:01:06.510> about<00:01:06.540> it<00:01:06.869> wasn't<00:01:07.229> a<00:01:07.409> big<00:01:07.560> fan<00:01:07.770> of<00:01:07.799> this

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
much about it wasn't a big fan of this

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.920

he were the clone if you want I'm sure a

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.649 
he were the clone if you want I'm sure a
lot<00:01:27.990> of<00:01:28.020> you<00:01:28.200> watched<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.680> movie<00:01:29.210> he<00:01:30.210> was<00:01:30.450> the

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
articulation limited accessories but I

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.179 
articulation limited accessories but I
think<00:01:57.390> I<00:01:57.570> think<00:01:57.600> by<00:01:57.930> far<00:01:57.960> this<00:01:58.500> is<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:58.740> best

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:05.350 
connected to his to the elbow swivel so

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:11.160 
connected to his to the elbow swivel so
he's<00:06:05.530> easily<00:06:05.770> he's<00:06:06.780> he's<00:06:07.780> uh<00:06:09.600> he's<00:06:10.600> got<00:06:10.870> some

he's easily he's he's uh he's got some

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:13.440 
he's easily he's he's uh he's got some
molding<00:06:11.620> which<00:06:11.800> hinders<00:06:12.580> the<00:06:12.730> articulation<00:06:13.360> a

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:13.450 
molding which hinders the articulation a

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:15.090 
molding which hinders the articulation a
little<00:06:13.720> bit<00:06:13.900> but<00:06:14.170> but<00:06:14.350> it's<00:06:14.500> fine<00:06:14.740> it<00:06:15.070> is

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:15.100 
little bit but but it's fine it is

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:17.640 
little bit but but it's fine it is
absolutely<00:06:15.910> necessary<00:06:16.240> I<00:06:16.780> think<00:06:16.960> for<00:06:17.560> the

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:17.650 
absolutely necessary I think for the

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:19.860 
absolutely necessary I think for the
figure<00:06:18.340> to<00:06:18.490> have<00:06:18.640> that<00:06:18.910> it<00:06:19.090> to<00:06:19.210> make<00:06:19.360> it<00:06:19.510> very

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:19.870 
figure to have that it to make it very

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:23.340 
figure to have that it to make it very
realistic<00:06:20.680> to<00:06:20.710> the<00:06:20.860> movie<00:06:21.900> but<00:06:22.900> it's<00:06:23.140> it

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:23.350 
realistic to the movie but it's it

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:25.430 
realistic to the movie but it's it
doesn't<00:06:23.650> hinder<00:06:23.800> the<00:06:24.070> articulation<00:06:24.610> as<00:06:24.730> much

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:25.440 
doesn't hinder the articulation as much

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:27.090 
doesn't hinder the articulation as much
that's<00:06:26.440> pretty<00:06:26.710> cool

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:27.100 
that's pretty cool

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:29.190
