hi<00:00:06.240> I'd<00:00:06.599> like<00:00:06.689> to<00:00:07.109> talk<00:00:07.500> to<00:00:07.769> you<00:00:07.889> today<00:00:08.219> about<00:00:08.250> a

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
hi I'd like to talk to you today about a

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.810 
hi I'd like to talk to you today about a
concept<00:00:09.209> called<00:00:09.389> a<00:00:09.930> mouth<00:00:10.260> compression<00:00:10.920> but

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
concept called a mouth compression but

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.849 
concept called a mouth compression but
before<00:00:12.119> I<00:00:12.150> do<00:00:12.379> had<00:00:13.379> an<00:00:13.469> interesting

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:13.859 
before I do had an interesting

00:00:13.859 --> 00:00:15.470 
before I do had an interesting
experience<00:00:14.279> this<00:00:14.580> morning<00:00:14.850> I<00:00:15.059> had<00:00:15.209> finally

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
experience this morning I had finally

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.330 
experience this morning I had finally
got<00:00:15.840> back<00:00:16.049> into<00:00:16.230> Bikram<00:00:16.740> yoga

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
got back into Bikram yoga

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:18.800 
got back into Bikram yoga
now<00:00:17.490> that's<00:00:17.670> yoga<00:00:18.060> that<00:00:18.180> goes<00:00:18.420> for<00:00:18.630> an<00:00:18.689> hour

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
now that's yoga that goes for an hour

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.480 
now that's yoga that goes for an hour
and<00:00:18.960> a<00:00:18.990> half<00:00:19.170> in<00:00:19.380> a<00:00:19.470> room<00:00:19.650> that's<00:00:19.769> 40<00:00:20.189> degrees

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
and a half in a room that's 40 degrees

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.989 
and a half in a room that's 40 degrees
Celsius<00:00:21.029> so<00:00:21.240> that's<00:00:21.419> over<00:00:22.169> 100<00:00:22.529> degrees

00:00:22.989 --> 00:00:22.999 
Celsius so that's over 100 degrees

00:00:22.999 --> 00:00:24.620 
Celsius so that's over 100 degrees
Fahrenheit

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
Fahrenheit

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.099 
Fahrenheit
fantastic<00:00:25.499> makes<00:00:25.679> you<00:00:25.800> feel<00:00:26.029> unbelievable

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:27.109 
fantastic makes you feel unbelievable

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:30.499 
fantastic makes you feel unbelievable
but<00:00:28.109> I<00:00:28.140> hadn't<00:00:28.409> been<00:00:28.529> for<00:00:28.909> 12<00:00:29.909> months<00:00:30.210> actually

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:30.509 
but I hadn't been for 12 months actually

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:33.950 
but I hadn't been for 12 months actually
to<00:00:30.659> the<00:00:30.749> day<00:00:30.929> and<00:00:32.030> finally<00:00:33.030> I'm<00:00:33.420> excited<00:00:33.870> to

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
to the day and finally I'm excited to

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.120 
to the day and finally I'm excited to
get<00:00:34.079> back<00:00:34.290> into<00:00:34.470> it<00:00:34.590> but<00:00:34.860> it's<00:00:34.980> interesting

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
get back into it but it's interesting

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.880 
get back into it but it's interesting
just<00:00:35.579> to<00:00:35.670> notice<00:00:36.030> how<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.239> I<00:00:36.630> I<00:00:37.200> did<00:00:37.620> it<00:00:37.710> for<00:00:37.830> a

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
just to notice how the I I did it for a

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.470 
just to notice how the I I did it for a
couple<00:00:38.130> of<00:00:38.160> years<00:00:38.400> and<00:00:38.730> so<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.030> brain<00:00:39.240> knows

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
couple of years and so the brain knows

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.000 
couple of years and so the brain knows
what<00:00:39.660> to<00:00:39.810> do<00:00:39.930> when<00:00:40.080> it's<00:00:40.260> programmed<00:00:40.740> to<00:00:40.830> do

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
what to do when it's programmed to do

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.590 
what to do when it's programmed to do
something<00:00:41.340> but<00:00:41.490> then<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:41.730> body<00:00:41.910> can't<00:00:42.210> do<00:00:42.450> it

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
something but then the body can't do it

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.470 
something but then the body can't do it
and<00:00:43.470> the<00:00:43.800> similarities<00:00:44.460> between<00:00:44.490> that<00:00:45.270> and

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
and the similarities between that and

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.470 
and the similarities between that and
maybe<00:00:45.600> taking<00:00:45.930> some<00:00:46.200> time<00:00:46.380> off<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.710> trumpet

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:47.480 
maybe taking some time off the trumpet

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:53.360 
maybe taking some time off the trumpet
very<00:00:48.480> act<00:00:48.900> so<00:00:50.390> experiencing<00:00:51.390> that<00:00:52.160> come<00:00:53.160> back

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
very act so experiencing that come back

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.220 
very act so experiencing that come back
and<00:00:53.610> trying<00:00:53.970> to<00:00:54.180> get<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.600> body<00:00:54.780> to<00:00:54.870> do<00:00:55.080> what

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
and trying to get the body to do what

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.530 
and trying to get the body to do what
the<00:00:55.350> brain<00:00:55.560> wants<00:00:55.890> it<00:00:56.010> to<00:00:56.130> do<00:00:56.280> is<00:00:56.490> a

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:56.540 
the brain wants it to do is a

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.970 
the brain wants it to do is a
interesting<00:00:57.540> task<00:00:57.780> that<00:00:58.140> no<00:00:58.380> doubt<00:00:58.560> over<00:00:58.770> the

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
interesting task that no doubt over the

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.830 
interesting task that no doubt over the
next<00:00:59.190> weeks<00:00:59.610> and<00:00:59.820> months<00:01:00.060> will<00:01:01.460> hopefully

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:02.840 
next weeks and months will hopefully

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.590 
next weeks and months will hopefully
prove<00:01:03.840> to<00:01:04.140> be<00:01:04.170> beneficial<00:01:04.409> now<00:01:05.600> math

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
prove to be beneficial now math

compression<00:01:07.259> often<00:01:08.070> you<00:01:08.189> probably<00:01:08.760> have<00:01:08.880> seen

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
compression often you probably have seen

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.410 
compression often you probably have seen
the<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.780> windbag<00:01:10.170> video<00:01:10.560> where<00:01:11.490> I'm<00:01:11.700> talking

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
the the windbag video where I'm talking

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.380 
the the windbag video where I'm talking
about<00:01:12.450> getting<00:01:12.690> the<00:01:12.930> air<00:01:13.050> in<00:01:13.230> and<00:01:13.760> why<00:01:14.760> it's<00:01:14.940> so

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
about getting the air in and why it's so

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.310 
about getting the air in and why it's so
important<00:01:15.930> now<00:01:16.530> I've<00:01:17.070> for<00:01:18.060> years<00:01:18.540> had<00:01:18.930> real

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
important now I've for years had real

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.930 
important now I've for years had real
trouble<00:01:19.530> understanding<00:01:20.010> how<00:01:20.490> to<00:01:20.550> incorporate

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:20.940 
trouble understanding how to incorporate

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.680 
trouble understanding how to incorporate
a<00:01:21.270> big<00:01:21.540> breath<00:01:22.070> into<00:01:23.070> playing<00:01:23.340> because<00:01:23.670> it<00:01:23.970> can

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:24.690 
a big breath into playing because it can

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.640 
a big breath into playing because it can
if<00:01:24.900> you<00:01:24.930> really<00:01:25.970> feel<00:01:26.970> up<00:01:27.150> as<00:01:27.300> much<00:01:27.479> as<00:01:27.659> you<00:01:27.690> can

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
if you really feel up as much as you can

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.980 
if you really feel up as much as you can
it<00:01:28.860> creates<00:01:29.280> tension<00:01:30.060> now<00:01:30.270> that's<00:01:30.479> not<00:01:30.960> what

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
it creates tension now that's not what

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.140 
it creates tension now that's not what
it's<00:01:31.409> about

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:32.150 
it's about

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.210 
it's about
we<00:01:33.150> want<00:01:33.360> to<00:01:33.450> get<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.860> comfortable<00:01:34.860> amount<00:01:35.130> of

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
we want to get the comfortable amount of

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.000 
we want to get the comfortable amount of
compression<00:01:35.549> into<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.060> body<00:01:36.799> and<00:01:37.799> then<00:01:37.950> we

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:38.010 
compression into the body and then we

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.550 
compression into the body and then we
want<00:01:38.159> to<00:01:38.250> release<00:01:39.000> it<00:01:39.030> now<00:01:39.690> how<00:01:40.110> do<00:01:40.170> we<00:01:40.320> make

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
want to release it now how do we make

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.520 
want to release it now how do we make
that<00:01:40.740> conversion<00:01:41.340> between<00:01:42.330> that<00:01:42.960> air<00:01:43.229> in<00:01:43.409> the

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
that conversion between that air in the

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.670 
that conversion between that air in the
body<00:01:43.740> and<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.970> instrument<00:01:45.510> because<00:01:46.049> you<00:01:46.409> feel

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
body and the instrument because you feel

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.039 
body and the instrument because you feel
like<00:01:46.710> you've<00:01:47.010> got<00:01:47.130> so<00:01:47.400> much<00:01:47.549> air<00:01:47.820> in<00:01:48.060> then<00:01:48.840> what

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
like you've got so much air in then what

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.580 
like you've got so much air in then what
you<00:01:49.170> do<00:01:49.409> is<00:01:50.450> instinctively<00:01:51.450> try<00:01:51.900> and<00:01:52.080> blow<00:01:52.380> all

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
you do is instinctively try and blow all

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.680 
you do is instinctively try and blow all
that<00:01:52.619> area<00:01:53.100> and<00:01:53.340> push<00:01:53.549> it<00:01:53.729> now<00:01:53.760> as<00:01:54.060> it<00:01:54.270> we've

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:54.690 
that area and push it now as it we've

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:57.770 
that area and push it now as it we've
discussed<00:01:55.140> quite<00:01:55.409> a<00:01:55.470> bit<00:01:55.680> now<00:01:56.390> that's<00:01:57.390> way<00:01:57.750> too

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
discussed quite a bit now that's way too

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.410 
discussed quite a bit now that's way too
much<00:01:58.110> energy<00:01:58.320> for<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:58.770> instrument<00:01:59.280> okay<00:01:59.850> way

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
much energy for the instrument okay way

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.840 
much energy for the instrument okay way
too<00:02:00.479> much<00:02:00.780> so<00:02:01.049> we<00:02:01.560> need<00:02:01.740> to<00:02:01.950> understand<00:02:02.520> that

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
too much so we need to understand that

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.640 
too much so we need to understand that
like<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.240> slingshot<00:02:03.780> we've<00:02:03.960> got<00:02:04.380> the<00:02:04.530> energy

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:04.650 
like the slingshot we've got the energy

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:07.490 
like the slingshot we've got the energy
in<00:02:05.010> and<00:02:05.250> nearly<00:02:05.640> release<00:02:06.170> so<00:02:07.170> it's<00:02:07.350> the

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
in and nearly release so it's the

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.289 
in and nearly release so it's the
release<00:02:07.799> that<00:02:08.399> I<00:02:08.429> want<00:02:08.640> to<00:02:08.700> talk<00:02:08.849> about<00:02:09.000> with

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:09.299 
release that I want to talk about with

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:11.059 
release that I want to talk about with
mouths<00:02:09.569> compression<00:02:10.170> now<00:02:10.289> it<00:02:10.439> might<00:02:10.649> look<00:02:10.950> a

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
mouths compression now it might look a

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.210 
mouths compression now it might look a
little<00:02:11.099> weird<00:02:11.340> but<00:02:11.819> you'll<00:02:12.120> get<00:02:12.330> the<00:02:12.480> point<00:02:12.690> is

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
little weird but you'll get the point is

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.150 
little weird but you'll get the point is
that<00:02:14.220> I<00:02:14.970> want<00:02:15.480> you<00:02:15.540> to<00:02:15.630> experience<00:02:16.110> so<00:02:16.950> next

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
that I want you to experience so next

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.410 
that I want you to experience so next
time<00:02:17.340> you're<00:02:17.520> in<00:02:17.580> the<00:02:17.700> shower

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
time you're in the shower

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.930 
time you're in the shower
get<00:02:18.900> a<00:02:18.930> mouthful<00:02:19.260> of<00:02:19.320> water<00:02:19.620> and<00:02:20.250> squirt<00:02:20.760> the

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
get a mouthful of water and squirt the

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.360 
get a mouthful of water and squirt the
water<00:02:20.970> as<00:02:21.390> far<00:02:22.020> as<00:02:22.200> you<00:02:22.320> can<00:02:22.500> now<00:02:22.770> I<00:02:22.980> didn't

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
water as far as you can now I didn't

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:24.680 
water as far as you can now I didn't
want<00:02:23.400> to<00:02:23.550> bring<00:02:23.670> the<00:02:23.790> camera<00:02:24.120> into<00:02:24.390> the<00:02:24.420> shower

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
want to bring the camera into the shower

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.780 
want to bring the camera into the shower
so<00:02:25.020> I<00:02:25.050> bought<00:02:25.560> a<00:02:25.590> glass<00:02:25.830> of<00:02:25.980> water<00:02:26.220> to

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
so I bought a glass of water to

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:35.080 
so I bought a glass of water to
demonstrate<00:02:27.270> what<00:02:27.390> I<00:02:27.420> mean

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.790 

okay<00:02:36.090> so<00:02:36.480> that<00:02:36.870> might<00:02:37.050> be<00:02:37.080> a<00:02:37.200> little<00:02:37.290> gross<00:02:37.440> I'm

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
okay so that might be a little gross I'm

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.220 
okay so that might be a little gross I'm
sorry<00:02:37.830> about<00:02:38.160> that<00:02:38.480> but<00:02:39.480> what<00:02:39.720> I'm<00:02:39.840> getting<00:02:39.960> at

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
sorry about that but what I'm getting at

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.790 
sorry about that but what I'm getting at
is<00:02:41.090> below<00:02:42.090> the<00:02:42.360> the<00:02:42.870> neck<00:02:43.080> or<00:02:43.290> behind<00:02:43.650> the

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
is below the the neck or behind the

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.050 
is below the the neck or behind the
mouth<00:02:43.980> there's<00:02:44.280> nothing<00:02:44.700> going<00:02:44.880> on

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
mouth there's nothing going on

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.040 
mouth there's nothing going on
whatsoever<00:02:45.600> it's<00:02:46.290> purely<00:02:46.890> squeezing<00:02:47.610> the<00:02:47.760> air

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.050 
whatsoever it's purely squeezing the air

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:52.280 
whatsoever it's purely squeezing the air
out<00:02:49.050> of<00:02:49.700> the<00:02:50.700> sorry<00:02:51.180> squeezing<00:02:51.660> the<00:02:51.690> water<00:02:51.780> out

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
out of the sorry squeezing the water out

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.920 
out of the sorry squeezing the water out
from<00:02:52.620> the<00:02:52.800> mouth<00:02:53.010> without<00:02:53.820> any<00:02:54.240> kind<00:02:54.600> of<00:02:54.750> push

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
from the mouth without any kind of push

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.710 
from the mouth without any kind of push
I'm<00:02:55.110> not<00:02:55.260> sort<00:02:55.500> of<00:02:55.590> trying<00:02:55.920> to<00:02:56.010> go<00:02:56.450> each<00:02:57.450> time

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
I'm not sort of trying to go each time

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.350 
I'm not sort of trying to go each time
it's<00:02:57.870> just<00:02:57.930> a<00:02:58.110> it's<00:02:59.100> a<00:02:59.220> little<00:02:59.459> squirt<00:03:00.000> of<00:03:00.150> air

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
it's just a it's a little squirt of air

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.020 
it's just a it's a little squirt of air
now<00:03:01.170> you<00:03:01.230> imagine<00:03:01.380> this<00:03:01.770> for<00:03:01.950> a<00:03:02.010> minute<00:03:02.220> you've

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
now you imagine this for a minute you've

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.620 
now you imagine this for a minute you've
got<00:03:03.300> a<00:03:03.330> you've<00:03:04.110> taken<00:03:04.350> a<00:03:04.530> big<00:03:04.770> deep<00:03:04.980> breath<00:03:05.630> and

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
got a you've taken a big deep breath and

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.490 
got a you've taken a big deep breath and
it<00:03:06.840> is<00:03:06.959> in<00:03:07.080> the<00:03:07.170> body<00:03:07.520> then<00:03:09.200> you're<00:03:10.200> going<00:03:10.410> to

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
it is in the body then you're going to

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.229 
it is in the body then you're going to
use<00:03:10.739> the<00:03:10.920> compression<00:03:11.430> in<00:03:11.520> the<00:03:11.610> body<00:03:11.820> behind

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
use the compression in the body behind

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:15.080 
use the compression in the body behind
the<00:03:12.630> tongue<00:03:12.959> so<00:03:13.709> in<00:03:13.860> a<00:03:13.890> way<00:03:14.160> do<00:03:14.489> exactly<00:03:14.910> the

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
the tongue so in a way do exactly the

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:16.430 
the tongue so in a way do exactly the
sailors<00:03:15.450> in<00:03:15.570> there<00:03:15.840> you're<00:03:16.050> not<00:03:16.080> going<00:03:16.380> to

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
sailors in there you're not going to

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.320 
sailors in there you're not going to
engage<00:03:16.590> the<00:03:17.220> air<00:03:17.400> and<00:03:17.580> try<00:03:17.760> and<00:03:17.910> push<00:03:18.150> it

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 
engage the air and try and push it

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:19.820 
engage the air and try and push it
you're<00:03:18.540> merely<00:03:18.870> going<00:03:19.200> to<00:03:19.290> release<00:03:19.620> the

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
you're merely going to release the

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:26.120 
you're merely going to release the
compression<00:03:20.340> from<00:03:20.489> in<00:03:20.640> the<00:03:20.700> mouth<00:03:24.530> okay<00:03:25.530> this

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
compression from in the mouth okay this

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.490 
compression from in the mouth okay this
is<00:03:26.280> the<00:03:26.430> way<00:03:26.580> to<00:03:26.640> start<00:03:27.150> and<00:03:27.330> discover<00:03:27.840> higher

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
is the way to start and discover higher

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.199 
is the way to start and discover higher
harmonics<00:03:29.160> on<00:03:29.310> the<00:03:29.430> instrument<00:03:29.850> you're<00:03:30.060> going

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
harmonics on the instrument you're going

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:33.080 
harmonics on the instrument you're going
to<00:03:30.269> do<00:03:30.360> it<00:03:30.510> really<00:03:31.049> really<00:03:31.410> softly<00:03:32.250> and<00:03:32.549> the

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
to do it really really softly and the

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:34.880 
to do it really really softly and the
sound<00:03:33.360> doesn't<00:03:33.780> have<00:03:33.900> to<00:03:34.049> be<00:03:34.140> great<00:03:34.440> it<00:03:34.620> can<00:03:34.769> be

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
sound doesn't have to be great it can be

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.310 
sound doesn't have to be great it can be
really<00:03:35.160> scratchy<00:03:35.580> in<00:03:35.850> fact<00:03:36.090> remember<00:03:36.600> we're

the frequencies at the start they might

you know Sam terrible sound good sound
the<00:03:51.900> three<00:03:52.110> steps<00:03:52.380> to<00:03:52.470> the<00:03:52.530> sound<00:03:52.799> production

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 
the three steps to the sound production

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.060 
the three steps to the sound production
firstly<00:03:54.120> no<00:03:54.330> note<00:03:54.570> will<00:03:54.690> come<00:03:54.840> out<00:03:55.070> then

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:56.070 
firstly no note will come out then

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:58.699 
firstly no note will come out then
you'll<00:03:57.060> hear<00:03:57.450> the<00:03:57.510> frequency<00:03:57.989> that<00:03:58.440> it<00:03:58.530> might

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
you'll hear the frequency that it might

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:01.400 
you'll hear the frequency that it might
sound<00:03:59.010> awful<00:03:59.730> but<00:04:00.420> then<00:04:00.630> as<00:04:00.750> you<00:04:00.780> start<00:04:01.049> and

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
sound awful but then as you start and

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:04.630 
sound awful but then as you start and
get<00:04:01.530> used<00:04:01.769> to<00:04:01.920> the<00:04:02.040> shape<00:04:02.400> of<00:04:02.610> that<00:04:03.600> frequency

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:04.640 
get used to the shape of that frequency

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.949 
get used to the shape of that frequency
you'll<00:04:05.640> be<00:04:05.790> able<00:04:05.850> to<00:04:06.030> start<00:04:06.269> and<00:04:06.450> hold<00:04:06.750> the

open the the aperture itself up to get
more<00:04:12.540> volume<00:04:12.810> and<00:04:13.049> resonance<00:04:13.500> now<00:04:14.010> this<00:04:14.250> is

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
more volume and resonance now this is

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.909 
more volume and resonance now this is

that choking sensation so what we need
to<00:04:40.870> do<00:04:41.050> is<00:04:41.830> practice<00:04:42.070> the<00:04:42.430> backswing<00:04:42.910> and<00:04:43.150> then

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:43.840 
to do is practice the backswing and then

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:47.430 
to do is practice the backswing and then
practice<00:04:44.169> the<00:04:44.560> sensation<00:04:45.990> the<00:04:46.990> joys<00:04:47.229> of

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
we have the compression in the body then

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:03.210 
we have the compression in the body then
we're<00:05:00.009> discovering<00:05:00.460> shape<00:05:01.530> you<00:05:02.530> don't<00:05:02.919> need

to blow much at all I hate that word you

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:11.810 
to blow much at all I hate that word you

notes he has a pretty strong upper
register<00:05:23.889> trust<00:05:24.490> me<00:05:24.669> you'd<00:05:24.940> know<00:05:25.860> so<00:05:27.270> you<00:05:28.270> want

00:05:28.439 --> 00:05:28.449 
register trust me you'd know so you want

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:29.999 
register trust me you'd know so you want
to<00:05:28.509> have<00:05:28.630> the<00:05:28.750> compression<00:05:29.289> in<00:05:29.410> the<00:05:29.500> body<00:05:29.710> and

00:05:29.999 --> 00:05:30.009 
to have the compression in the body and

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:33.390 
to have the compression in the body and
then<00:05:30.849> just<00:05:31.270> using<00:05:31.660> the<00:05:31.840> tongue<00:05:32.229> just<00:05:32.740> release

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:33.400 
then just using the tongue just release

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:37.469 
then just using the tongue just release
the<00:05:33.729> smallest<00:05:34.389> amount<00:05:34.750> of<00:05:34.840> air<00:05:35.050> and<00:05:35.430> learn<00:05:36.479> to

00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:37.479 
the smallest amount of air and learn to

00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:40.320 
the smallest amount of air and learn to
just<00:05:38.080> let<00:05:38.500> the<00:05:38.680> aperture<00:05:39.070> go<00:05:39.250> an<00:05:39.520> experiment

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:40.330 
just let the aperture go an experiment

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:44.310 
just let the aperture go an experiment
and<00:05:40.570> you'll<00:05:41.050> see<00:05:41.669> results<00:05:42.669> the<00:05:43.570> result<00:05:44.020> might

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:44.320 
and you'll see results the result might

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:45.719 
and you'll see results the result might
be<00:05:44.590> no<00:05:44.800> sound<00:05:45.159> at<00:05:45.340> all

00:05:45.719 --> 00:05:45.729 
be no sound at all

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:48.899 
be no sound at all
great<00:05:46.240> there's<00:05:46.990> step<00:05:47.320> one<00:05:47.560> all<00:05:47.860> right<00:05:48.099> then

00:05:48.899 --> 00:05:48.909 
great there's step one all right then

00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:52.439 
great there's step one all right then
you<00:05:49.210> might<00:05:49.710> have<00:05:50.710> a<00:05:51.460> weird<00:05:51.729> squeak<00:05:52.210> and<00:05:52.360> a

00:05:52.439 --> 00:05:52.449 
you might have a weird squeak and a

00:05:52.449 --> 00:05:54.870 
you might have a weird squeak and a
ridiculous<00:05:53.080> high<00:05:53.380> harmonic<00:05:53.949> that<00:05:54.460> is<00:05:54.520> the

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:54.880 
ridiculous high harmonic that is the

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.399 
ridiculous high harmonic that is the
seed<00:05:55.120> of<00:05:55.150> a<00:05:55.330> note<00:05:55.539> okay

00:05:56.399 --> 00:05:56.409 
seed of a note okay

00:05:56.409 --> 00:05:59.040 
seed of a note okay
just<00:05:56.889> become<00:05:57.220> aware<00:05:57.520> of<00:05:57.580> it<00:05:57.820> now<00:05:58.510> your

00:05:59.040 --> 00:05:59.050 
just become aware of it now your

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:01.050 
just become aware of it now your
tendency<00:05:59.889> and<00:06:00.039> your<00:06:00.159> instinct<00:06:00.639> will<00:06:00.729> say<00:06:00.880> oh

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:01.060 
tendency and your instinct will say oh

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:02.640 
tendency and your instinct will say oh
well<00:06:01.570> I'll<00:06:01.690> check<00:06:01.720> that<00:06:01.990> out<00:06:02.229> now<00:06:02.409> I'm<00:06:02.500> going
