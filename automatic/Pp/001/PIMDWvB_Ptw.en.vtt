00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.590 

start<00:00:01.260> by<00:00:01.469> making<00:00:01.680> a<00:00:01.979> base<00:00:02.159> of<00:00:02.190> eight<00:00:02.639> so<00:00:03.570> you

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:03.600 
start by making a base of eight so you

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.309 
start by making a base of eight so you
take<00:00:03.899> two<00:00:04.230> pieces<00:00:05.240> and<00:00:06.240> connect<00:00:06.960> them<00:00:07.140> like

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
take two pieces and connect them like

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:24.900 
take two pieces and connect them like
this<00:00:10.460> so<00:00:11.460> you<00:00:11.550> make<00:00:11.730> eight<00:00:11.969> of<00:00:12.240> this

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:24.910 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.589 

so<00:00:25.599> now<00:00:25.810> you<00:00:25.869> have<00:00:26.050> eight<00:00:26.410> of<00:00:26.740> this<00:00:27.130> and<00:00:27.759> you

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:28.599 
so now you have eight of this and you

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:48.610 
so now you have eight of this and you
can<00:00:28.900> attend<00:00:29.259> a<00:00:29.529> circle

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:48.620 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.520 

now<00:00:49.190> you<00:00:49.280> have<00:00:49.490> to<00:00:49.640> increase<00:00:50.150> the<00:00:50.720> circle<00:00:51.260> from

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:51.530 
now you have to increase the circle from

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.990 
now you have to increase the circle from
eight<00:00:51.950> to<00:00:52.610> sixteen<00:00:53.150> pieces<00:00:53.330> in<00:00:53.780> a<00:00:53.930> row<00:00:55.000> should

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.000 
eight to sixteen pieces in a row should

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.190 
eight to sixteen pieces in a row should
increase<00:00:56.480> you<00:00:57.380> take<00:00:57.620> one<00:00:57.800> pieces<00:00:58.220> and<00:00:58.520> add<00:00:59.450> one

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:00.200 
increase you take one pieces and add one

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.860 
increase you take one pieces and add one
between<00:01:00.620> two<00:01:00.980> pieces<00:01:01.190> so<00:01:01.370> this<00:01:01.660> the<00:01:02.660> two

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:02.870 
between two pieces so this the two

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:11.440 
between two pieces so this the two
pieces<00:01:03.140> and<00:01:03.590> that<00:01:04.220> one<00:01:04.460> piece<00:01:04.729> in<00:01:05.089> the<00:01:05.150> middle

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.289 

can<00:01:12.450> you<00:01:12.540> add<00:01:12.720> two<00:01:12.990> pieces<00:01:13.470> on<00:01:14.130> top<00:01:14.820> of<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.119> one

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
can you add two pieces on top of the one

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.410 
can you add two pieces on top of the one
you're<00:01:15.479> inside<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:15.990> middle<00:01:16.140> so<00:01:16.880> one<00:01:17.880> go<00:01:18.119> over

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
you're inside the middle so one go over

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:31.649 
you're inside the middle so one go over
this<00:01:18.750> point<00:01:22.100> and<00:01:23.100> one<00:01:23.670> go<00:01:23.880> over<00:01:24.090> this<00:01:24.270> point

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
so you do this to the whole row so you

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:42.050 
so you do this to the whole row so you
know<00:01:37.090> someone<00:01:37.479> in<00:01:37.630> a<00:01:37.659> minute<00:01:40.170> and<00:01:41.170> you<00:01:41.350> add<00:01:41.470> two

in this world now on top after seven

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:41.030 
in this world now on top after seven
pieces<00:03:37.550> add<00:03:38.550> tagar<00:03:38.940> upwards<00:03:39.720> say<00:03:40.380> as<00:03:40.680> six

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
pieces add tagar upwards say as six

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.890 
pieces add tagar upwards say as six
pieces<00:03:41.340> on<00:03:41.640> top<00:03:42.170> so<00:03:43.170> on<00:03:43.380> this<00:03:43.650> so<00:03:44.130> many<00:03:44.190> pieces

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
pieces on top so on this so many pieces

00:03:44.900 --> 00:04:07.120 
pieces on top so on this so many pieces
us<00:03:45.900> six<00:03:46.170> pieces

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:07.130 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:19.400 

then<00:04:07.730> five<00:04:08.150> pieces<00:04:08.570> on<00:04:08.900> top

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:38.650 

and<00:04:19.890> four<00:04:20.250> pieces<00:04:20.520> on<00:04:20.850> top

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:38.660 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:42.490 

now<00:04:39.230> do<00:04:39.290> the<00:04:39.560> same<00:04:39.590> here<00:04:40.280> for<00:04:40.430> this<00:04:40.970> seven<00:04:41.500> red

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:42.500 
now do the same here for this seven red

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:56.129 
now do the same here for this seven red
pieces<00:04:42.740> so<00:04:43.070> you're<00:04:43.220> a<00:04:43.250> sixth<00:04:43.670> on<00:04:43.820> it

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:56.139 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:05:00.059 

so<00:04:56.770> a<00:04:56.800> new<00:04:57.069> finish<00:04:57.550> you<00:04:58.150> should<00:04:58.360> have<00:04:58.509> this<00:04:59.069> so

00:05:00.059 --> 00:05:00.069 
so a new finish you should have this so

00:05:00.069 --> 00:05:04.290 
so a new finish you should have this so
remote<00:05:00.430> it<00:05:02.490> sort<00:05:03.490> of<00:05:03.520> more<00:05:03.729> like<00:05:03.759> a<00:05:04.000> round

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:04.300 
remote it sort of more like a round

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:10.890 
remote it sort of more like a round
shape

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:10.900 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:12.590 

No

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:12.600 
No

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:16.160 
No
you<00:05:13.170> turn<00:05:13.440> it<00:05:13.650> to<00:05:13.830> the<00:05:14.100> button<00:05:14.540> you<00:05:15.540> act<00:05:15.750> one

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:16.170 
you turn it to the button you act one

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:19.820 
you turn it to the button you act one
more<00:05:16.500> row<00:05:17.660> underneath<00:05:18.660> there's<00:05:19.170> no<00:05:19.410> more<00:05:19.620> not

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:19.830 
more row underneath there's no more not

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:21.910 
more row underneath there's no more not
so<00:05:20.190> the<00:05:20.370> pump<00:05:20.580> is<00:05:20.700> like<00:05:20.850> chasing<00:05:21.150> you

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:21.920 
so the pump is like chasing you
