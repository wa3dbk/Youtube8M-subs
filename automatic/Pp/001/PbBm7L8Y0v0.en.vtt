the<00:01:17.580> trick<00:01:17.790> to<00:01:17.939> riding<00:01:18.090> this<00:01:18.450> bike<00:01:18.689> is<00:01:18.900> to<00:01:19.020> keep

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
the trick to riding this bike is to keep

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.890 
the trick to riding this bike is to keep
it<00:01:19.380> wound<00:01:19.710> up<00:01:20.100> you<00:01:20.520> got<00:01:20.640> to<00:01:20.759> keep<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.030> RPMs<00:01:21.570> way

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
it wound up you got to keep the RPMs way

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.170 
it wound up you got to keep the RPMs way
up<00:01:22.140> high<00:01:22.380> and<00:01:22.650> stir<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.250> gearbox<00:01:23.670> a<00:01:23.850> lot<00:01:24.030> to

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
up high and stir the gearbox a lot to

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.670 
up high and stir the gearbox a lot to
keep<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.540> revs<00:01:24.780> up<00:01:25.049> they<00:01:25.229> don't<00:01:25.409> have<00:01:25.590> the

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
keep the revs up they don't have the

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.920 
keep the revs up they don't have the
torque<00:01:26.040> of<00:01:26.189> the<00:01:26.310> 250s<00:01:26.970> so<00:01:27.299> you<00:01:27.360> got<00:01:27.570> to<00:01:27.659> rely<00:01:27.900> on

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
torque of the 250s so you got to rely on

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.319 
torque of the 250s so you got to rely on
rpms<00:01:28.680> to<00:01:28.890> get<00:01:29.040> your<00:01:29.250> rent<00:01:29.490> that<00:01:29.939> means<00:01:30.180> you've

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
rpms to get your rent that means you've

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.510 
rpms to get your rent that means you've
got<00:01:30.360> to<00:01:30.479> be<00:01:30.659> real<00:01:30.869> smooth<00:01:31.320> and<00:01:31.710> ty<00:01:31.920> Davis<00:01:32.369> is

down at funny angles it could be the

one way or another and that's enough to

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.600 
one way or another and that's enough to

to<00:03:27.730> do<00:03:27.880> is<00:03:28.030> push<00:03:28.360> that<00:03:28.630> much<00:03:28.840> harder<00:03:28.900> to<00:03:29.350> try<00:03:29.530> to

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
to do is push that much harder to try to

him however I don't think that he even
