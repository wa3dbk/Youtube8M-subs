00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:12.840
 let's get to know the new staff of 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:16.590
 walter mazzarri today we present you 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:19.560
 giuseppe pondrelli who works with the 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.359
 mister how long the site col 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.410
 mister we are known at the time of 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:29.359
 spring of bologna therefore season 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:31.650
 2000 2000 2001 so this is the 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:36.140
 thirteenth season if I'm not mistaken one 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:38.430
 life yes in the end that is had been 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:41.700
 definitely my luck because later 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:44.070
 the mister always asked me in common 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:48.390
 to follow all teams where han 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.440
 since they were in the order after the 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.870
 bologna spring 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.719
 the acireale in series c2 the Pistoiese in 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.820
 c1 the livorno in series b 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:59.520
 then three years at the Reggina in two years 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.910
 to the sampdoria and four years in Naples 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.939
 more if bolognese god and accent 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:08.100
 betrays a slight Emilian accent not 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.560
 so light it is common to be bolognese 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.990
 because they say behind a great man there is 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.200
 a great wife need to find again 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:19.940
 the coach dinners to the trainer 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:21.600
 no I do not agree I believe behind 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.979
 we say that we believe ours 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:28.440
 according to us the luck of our staff 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:33.060
 it's about being a very good coach 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:35.880
 which I think makes it look a little bit 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:39.690
 better all of us footballers and staff 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.460
 that is the best are beautiful beautiful though 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.659
 then they are not interested together 20 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.700
 for a long time therefore recognized 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:48.000
 very well how the work works 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.580
 here in pinzolo with this group of 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.170
 guys you are starting to know 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.869
 of training session in 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:58.289
 training is yes after having the first 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.880
 introductory days to appear between with 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:03.450
 shooting workouts and athletic tests 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:07.619
 we started double training i 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:09.940
 classic pre-season preparation 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.530
 here 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.790
 nothing we work in a way 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:17.920
 enough can be said traditional with 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:22.260
 double sessions where there is a part 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.260
 tactical technician that an athletics 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:29.820
 clearly the athletic part in this 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:32.770
 period is a little more voluminous 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:35.500
 even if in any case the ball is immediately 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:36.730
 present as you have seen and then after col 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.460
 weeks go by 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.740
 clearly not less than the volume yes 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:43.840
 will go more on quality for that 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:46.420
 which concerns athletic work perhaps 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.730
 we will increase the jobs with ball we have 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:51.340
 noticed so much physical work 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.320
 above all for example the great race 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:56.350
 and the great post workout work of 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:58.690
 yesterday the boys arrive tired 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:02.350
 rightly they are the good signals when 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:06.940
 there is the fatigue that clearly has 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:08.890
 worked well is not really one could 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.300
 enter the field to run for two hours i 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.090
 football players from start to finish 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.650
 training would end up dead but 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.050
 clearly it would not be a struggle to 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:19.330
 run to soccer if that's right 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:22.540
 are tired after doing 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:25.450
 workouts however functional to the 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:27.280
 sports that they must practice then there is the 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:30.310
 rhyme is tired from work 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:32.620
 dry and sit down from work anyway 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:34.420
 Tactical Ball has done 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.920
 play by the coach not only not 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:38.830
 they are only for what concerns to 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.959
 runner's running work there 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:42.670
 it would be a world to come back maybe in 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:44.320
 course of the season in details with 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:45.489
 what are the reasons why 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:48.070
 we have seen that the work really is 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:49.780
 very widespread very articulated very 

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:52.870
 also identified because today's football 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:54.820
 obviously, there is a dress 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.280
 ad hoc for each and every athlete who has 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:59.170
 roles and physicality and football history 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.540
 different the Corriere della Sera has 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:04.959
 titrated can go to the muscle magician 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:06.910
 they put the label they saw us 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:08.230
 the short story of these few 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:11.050
 injuries of these players that 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:13.690
 they always play perhaps because of this renunciation 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:14.950
 senses I may have exaggerated a little in the sense 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:16.630
 that 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:21.549
 we have a training methodology 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:23.680
 which up until now I believe is with the means 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:26.770
 who uses the coach both with i 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:28.960
 ours is always enough 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:32.470
 benefits both from the point of view there 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:34.210
 performance ie of the physical state of the 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:36.460
 footballer both from the point of view of the 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:40.650
 injury prevention then if the 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:45.400
 end a physical contact sport of di 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:45.900
 clash of high speed and so many 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.610
 times 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:52.510
 the injury is not always always 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:56.889
 predictable but for now we have been 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:59.979
 let's say good lucky fingers with a 

00:04:56.889 --> 00:05:00.760
 level and performance that 

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:02.590
 accidents 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:05.650
 in short, on the daily work the method 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:07.180
 that is to say against the trauma zero you can yes no 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:08.440
 but not only as also against the trauma 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:12.930
 also against accidents 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:15.400
 muscles clearly all try to 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:18.460
 to work best at the end a 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:21.070
 staff work from the staff 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:24.010
 technician passes for the medical staff and 

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:26.440
 also passes for the good life of an athlete 

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:29.050
 who must anyway 

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:30.970
 to keep a good life regime that must 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:36.370
 keep a professional athlete then 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:39.630
 a set of things that can help 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:41.860
 reduce let's say the number of injuries 

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:43.450
