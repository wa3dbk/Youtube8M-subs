00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.009
 good your fears to a good new video 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.710
 it seems that the producer of fall 4 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:10.590
 game no more or less than 400 400 hours 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.570
 playing the game itself and seems to be 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.460
 that according to the lion or in his words 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.750
 has made the following played as 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.069
 probably about four hundred hours and 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.649
 I'm still discovering new things 

00:00:17.069 --> 00:00:20.880
 that I had not seen the truth so far 

00:00:19.649 --> 00:00:22.619
 is that good those are some words 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.390
 pretty good for all 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.249
 followers of the fallout saga and for 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.649
 especially for all the followers of 

00:00:26.249 --> 00:00:30.599
 long and good games you always have left 

00:00:28.649 --> 00:00:33.329
 the odd thing to discover and 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.859
 that how good you feel pretty good 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.260
 when they have discovered then things 

00:00:34.859 --> 00:00:38.730
 new little by little that good when 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.589
 you arrive has waves of fierce that 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.780
 there is still more game and more game and more 

00:00:40.589 --> 00:00:44.670
 games the games that as I say then no 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.489
 they do not need a bit of multiplayer 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.859
 because I already really campaign mode mode 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.440
 you already have everything you need to 

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:55.499
 throw them out and hours and hours and hours and hours 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.539
 and we're going to lose you there in your vast world 

00:00:55.499 --> 00:01:00.210
 and I really do not know which one will be big 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.399
 games or 400 hours because I do not think that 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.460
 make many people, it will last 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.850
 400 hours probably because there are people 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.320
 who plays and there are other people who play 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.810
 we could say two sectors not people 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.210
 who is trying to discover a little 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.640
 of the world others and then there are people 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.590
 that is absorbed within the world 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.229
 of the game there are not two ways of 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.780
 enjoy this title and good of the 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.549
 role titles in general there are not several 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.549
 ways always enjoy the debut of 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:31.560
 open world and others in these issues 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.430
 always therefore exploring everything 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:37.289
 exploring exploring the vast majority 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:40.320
 trying to finish the end 

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:41.610
 game and good to make you a high percentage 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.369
 I think four hundred hours is not going to 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.229
 last really I hope but yes it's going to 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.780
 be very close to the best if in 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.670
 complete almost everything and about 200 then 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:55.579
 they are already with everything one hundred percent 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.579
 and I think it's time 400 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:02.009
 try to look and every yesterday under each 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.539
 thing every stereo and all this but yes yes 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.340
 besides those 200 hours that I said 

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:08.970
 more or less that could last longer 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.019
 Going well seeing and others we add the 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.180
 possibility that we will be able to 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:14.879
 install the mods that I'm going to do in the 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.010
 pc and so on, it will be published a bit 

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:18.840
 the balls or the possibilities are 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.000
 unique to be able to create your house of the 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.250
 way I want to then also create 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.709
 your own weapons good to include your 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.209
 own weapons do not create so modify 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:29.459
 your own weapons and others catching 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:31.110
 objects out there and others and good 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:32.910
 armor and all this is going to be a 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:35.400
 immense and tremendously big game 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.920
 really for these words and so on 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.750
 We are filled with hope that this 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.310
 is going to be one of the games of the year like this 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.980
