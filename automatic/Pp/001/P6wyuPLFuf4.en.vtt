00:00:02.439 --> 00:00:06.649
 hello to all that such today I bring you this 

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:09.290
 makeup that is inspired by the 

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:10.820
 summer and in the heat I used a series 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:13.130
 of products that are perfect for the 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:15.830
 summer because they can stand the heat 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:17.990
 moisture and water we always have to 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:20.390
 Bring skin clean and hydrated to 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:22.130
 go to sunbathe or exercise but 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:23.270
 there are always occasions in summer at 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.920
 we need a makeup that 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:27.500
 we know that I will hold on either 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.150
 Party in a pool or at a wedding 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:32.029
 makeup that we know will be 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.710
 impeccable all day you are interested 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:36.500
 to see what kind of products I use 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.540
 for a makeup that resists all the 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.640
 day under the sun I hope that you stay 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:43.070
 watch the video first and foremost 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.890
 is to protect our skin from the sun usually 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.630
 be very white use factor 50 for the 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.280
 base I will use the fisa in mac body 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:50.989
 that apart from being water prof 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.719
 it's very very light and it does not show in the 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:56.410
 skin use several layers to get the 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:56.410
 desired coverage 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:09.630
 the pronoun is a fantastic proofreader 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.760
 because it holds everything all day though 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.460
 It does not have waterproof properties as if 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:17.160
 they have the face and mobile I feel 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.660
 that endures a lot despite the heat 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.130
 of the manicured ones he applied it with his fingers 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:24.080
 because there is also a very important project 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:26.730
 nice and I do not want to put instrumental 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.530
 excessive in that sense my way 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:30.840
 favorite to apply the prolong is with 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.030
 lips and blender ok and the base face and 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.060
 body this concealer go perfect with 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.580
 the re where we could also apply 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.530
 the body or dies in areas where 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.900
 we want a little more coverage as 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.390
 blusher I'm going to use this one here that is 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:49.310
 of taste in a special texture to me already 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.630
 which is like almost dust on the skin 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.020
 I will apply it also with the 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.020
 fingers 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.439
 and this is the result of rouge 

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:01.210
 although I do not think it looks good on 

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:03.250
 camera in person so it 's very 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:08.830
 strong and I'm going to chop France the skin with 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:10.890
 the bronx kings first of course to the downside 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.840
 of the cheekbone 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.430
 this is a product that is fantastic 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.220
 to use it with your fingers since it is 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.110
 super we believe 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:21.470
 pineapple that we're going to balance a 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:25.060
 little skin and applied by the parties 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.060
 where the sun would give us 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.970
 with a synthetic brush I'll go over it 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:33.010
 everything so that the cream products that 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.209
 they see well integrated blends 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.120
 I'm going to apply some powder 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:38.739
 translucent as they are products between 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.579
 hands I want to sit well on the skin 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:41.579
 so that it lasts longer 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:50.970
 for the eyes my favorite product in 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.920
 summer is the tattoo color of miguelín or 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.960
 the mango ping-pong took him out to the weather 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.270
 of make up forever any product 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:59.850
 that is how creams should be very fixed 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:02.420
 and they resist heat enough humidity 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.420
 and the water 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.709
 and with a synthetic brush I'll 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.470
 blur so there is no cut 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:16.480
 with the flat side of the broach I will 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:18.959
 apply a little on the bottom of 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.959
 tabs 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:24.770
 I'm going to use a bit of this mica end 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:29.050
 forever that is knowing one and I'm going 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:29.050
 to apply like this to flush lashes 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:39.050
 I'm going to outline the eye a little 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.850
 mark it more I will use the door line in 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:43.760
 English gel for me this eyeliner 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:48.220
 angel is the hardest of all with 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.220
 difference and the one that most resists water 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.959
 and how is the product in cream also 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:08.330
 we can blur a little before 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:10.640
 that has just been fixed 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:13.850
 for mascara I'm going to use this 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:16.630
 here that is the great illusion of revlon and 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:16.630
 It is waterproof 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:24.030
 and that would be all eye makeup 

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:25.530
 complete since for the friends there is no 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:27.990
 nothing that is really waterproof 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.879
 waterproof I prefer a balm that 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:32.220
 will keep the lips hydrated and in 

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:35.810
 good conditions throughout the day and 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.810
 you can replicate it several times 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:39.400
 to add a little more color to the 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:41.170
 cheeks I'm going to use a powder product 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.700
 that we could apply throughout the day 

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:44.680
 I'm going to use a new blusher 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:47.230
 flamenco collection by vélez plus that is 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:49.300
 this color so tan and summery I'm going 

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:52.650
 to mix a little the two colors and what 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:52.650
 I apply for all the cheeks 

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:58.920
 the tiny sparkles that the 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:01.440
 sides more lightness apart will help 

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:03.570
 to fix the official the rouge where 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:05.700
 we have put it this couple are 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:07.140
 perfectly compact to carry it in 

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:09.570
 the bag and being able to touch up along 

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:11.850
 day if you have problems with skins 

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:13.890
 I would recommend you to bring a 

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:16.110
 dust re pronounced to re apply 

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:18.660
 We carry the color I would recommend a 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:20.100
 Matifying powder to keep the skin 

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:22.680
 well mate since although we will use a 

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:24.630
 make-up base waterproof and 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:26.430
 that holds the heat quite well 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:28.650
 we can always get shine 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:30.840
 so I would take some powder with a 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:32.280
 small soldering iron brush and good 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.990
 girls this is all for today's video 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:35.970
 not because it's hot or we're going to 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:37.530
 tarnishing the pool means no 

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:39.720
 we can enjoy the makeup in 

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:41.670
 Summer let me know in the comments 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:43.350
 what is our infallible product that 

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:45.390
 never fails despite the summer heat 

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:47.730
 I hope you liked it if it's like that 

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:51.290
