underneath<00:01:33.509> you<00:01:33.750> so<00:01:34.290> you<00:01:34.380> can<00:01:34.500> have<00:01:34.680> something

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
underneath you so you can have something

power trying to turn into a one joint

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.459 
power trying to turn into a one joint
motion<00:01:55.439> as<00:01:55.680> much<00:01:55.829> as<00:01:55.950> we<00:01:56.070> can<00:01:56.219> so<00:01:57.000> maro<00:01:57.630> thank
