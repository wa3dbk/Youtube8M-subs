00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:24.580 
two-part lesson and this is actually

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:27.089 
two-part lesson and this is actually
very<00:00:25.020> special<00:00:26.020> I'm<00:00:26.169> doing<00:00:26.740> something

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:27.099 
very special I'm doing something

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:29.550 
very special I'm doing something
completely<00:00:27.910> different<00:00:28.570> on<00:00:28.990> this<00:00:29.169> lesson<00:00:29.529> that

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:29.560 
completely different on this lesson that

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.119 
completely different on this lesson that
I've<00:00:29.800> done<00:00:30.130> on<00:00:30.430> any<00:00:30.789> of<00:00:31.119> my<00:00:31.330> other<00:00:32.129> standards

00:00:33.119 --> 00:00:33.129 
I've done on any of my other standards

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:36.810 
I've done on any of my other standards
series<00:00:34.120> lessons<00:00:34.949> so<00:00:35.949> typically<00:00:36.400> in<00:00:36.519> a<00:00:36.610> lot<00:00:36.790> of

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:36.820 
series lessons so typically in a lot of

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.580 
series lessons so typically in a lot of
the<00:00:36.970> other<00:00:37.150> standards<00:00:37.780> lessons<00:00:38.260> I've<00:00:38.410> gone

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:38.590 
the other standards lessons I've gone

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:43.610 
the other standards lessons I've gone
through<00:00:39.040> on<00:00:39.879> you<00:00:40.660> know<00:00:41.580> basically<00:00:42.580> one<00:00:43.239> whole

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
through on you know basically one whole

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.979 
through on you know basically one whole
permutation<00:00:44.620> using<00:00:45.010> just<00:00:45.220> one<00:00:46.210> technique<00:00:46.510> and

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:46.989 
permutation using just one technique and

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:48.600 
permutation using just one technique and
I<00:00:47.050> would<00:00:47.230> do<00:00:47.350> another<00:00:47.680> technique<00:00:48.219> and<00:00:48.520> another

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:48.610 
I would do another technique and another

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:50.490 
I would do another technique and another
technique<00:00:49.329> I<00:00:49.540> would<00:00:49.899> go<00:00:50.020> through<00:00:50.230> the<00:00:50.350> whole

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:50.500 
technique I would go through the whole

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.950 
technique I would go through the whole
song<00:00:50.920> that<00:00:51.280> way<00:00:51.489> this<00:00:52.120> time<00:00:52.390> what<00:00:52.570> I'm<00:00:52.690> doing

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:52.960 
song that way this time what I'm doing

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:44.670 

have<00:01:35.290> a<00:01:35.320> third<00:01:35.649> option<00:01:35.979> here<00:01:43.530> all<00:01:44.530> right<00:01:44.619> so

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:44.680 
have a third option here all right so

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.560 
have a third option here all right so
we're<00:01:45.280> gonna<00:01:45.340> go<00:01:45.610> through<00:01:45.820> each<00:01:46.119> one<00:01:46.330> of<00:01:46.390> these

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 
we're gonna go through each one of these

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:48.660 
we're gonna go through each one of these
options<00:01:46.810> I'm<00:01:47.110> going<00:01:47.320> to<00:01:47.409> explain<00:01:47.950> how<00:01:48.009> I'm

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
options I'm going to explain how I'm

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.570 
options I'm going to explain how I'm
adding<00:01:49.180> on<00:01:49.330> so<00:01:49.960> option<00:01:50.289> one<00:01:50.560> is<00:01:51.130> you<00:01:51.430> know<00:01:51.549> the

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:51.580 
adding on so option one is you know the

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:56.190 
adding on so option one is you know the
basic<00:01:53.340> arrangement<00:01:54.360> option<00:01:55.360> two<00:01:55.569> adds<00:01:55.869> a

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
basic arrangement option two adds a

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.169 
basic arrangement option two adds a
little<00:01:56.350> bit<00:01:56.470> more<00:01:56.590> option<00:01:57.369> three<00:01:57.640> adds<00:01:57.880> a

00:01:58.169 --> 00:01:58.179 
little bit more option three adds a

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:00.330 
little bit more option three adds a
little<00:01:58.360> bit<00:01:58.479> more<00:01:58.630> than<00:01:59.050> that<00:01:59.170> here's<00:01:59.679> a<00:01:59.920> line

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
little bit more than that here's a line

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:08.719 
little bit more than that here's a line
to<00:02:00.580> option<00:02:01.090> two

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.940 

Hey<00:02:09.970> so<00:02:10.209> you<00:02:10.629> can<00:02:10.780> hear<00:02:11.140> that<00:02:11.379> wow<00:02:11.709> we're

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
Hey so you can hear that wow we're

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.309 
Hey so you can hear that wow we're
really<00:02:12.040> gonna<00:02:12.250> get<00:02:12.610> some<00:02:12.940> active<00:02:13.569> left-hand

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319 
really gonna get some active left-hand

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:18.809 
really gonna get some active left-hand
going<00:02:14.910> and<00:02:16.200> what<00:02:17.200> what<00:02:17.920> really<00:02:18.040> excites<00:02:18.610> me

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:18.819 
going and what what really excites me

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:20.100 
going and what what really excites me
about<00:02:18.849> this<00:02:19.150> lesson<00:02:19.599> and<00:02:19.720> I<00:02:19.750> think<00:02:19.989> it<00:02:20.050> will

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
about this lesson and I think it will

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.559 
about this lesson and I think it will
excite<00:02:20.440> you<00:02:20.650> as<00:02:20.800> well<00:02:21.069> learning<00:02:21.790> it<00:02:22.060> is<00:02:22.239> that

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:22.569 
excite you as well learning it is that

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:25.830 
excite you as well learning it is that
you<00:02:23.110> can<00:02:23.319> kind<00:02:23.590> of<00:02:23.680> see<00:02:24.040> this<00:02:24.430> process<00:02:25.420> of<00:02:25.599> how

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
you can kind of see this process of how

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.430 
you can kind of see this process of how
you<00:02:25.900> can<00:02:26.260> go<00:02:26.470> through<00:02:27.069> these<00:02:27.220> three<00:02:27.760> different

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
you can go through these three different

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.650 
you can go through these three different
permutations<00:02:29.440> for<00:02:29.650> each<00:02:30.400> line<00:02:30.819> and<00:02:31.150> what's

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
permutations for each line and what's

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.039 
permutations for each line and what's
cool<00:02:31.930> about<00:02:31.959> that<00:02:32.319> is<00:02:32.680> let's<00:02:33.099> say<00:02:33.190> I<00:02:33.310> take<00:02:33.700> this

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:34.049 
cool about that is let's say I take this

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:37.979 
cool about that is let's say I take this
line<00:02:35.049> one<00:02:35.489> option<00:02:36.489> well<00:02:37.360> let<00:02:37.540> me<00:02:37.569> take<00:02:37.750> line

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:37.989 
line one option well let me take line

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:40.080 
line one option well let me take line
one<00:02:38.230> option<00:02:38.769> three<00:02:39.010> so<00:02:39.190> I<00:02:39.280> have<00:02:39.489> here<00:02:39.700> here

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
one option three so I have here here

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:52.229 
one option three so I have here here
this<00:02:49.380> and<00:02:50.380> now<00:02:50.620> here<00:02:50.950> I<00:02:50.980> can<00:02:51.130> go<00:02:51.400> into<00:02:51.549> line<00:02:51.849> two

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 
this and now here I can go into line two

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:54.300 
this and now here I can go into line two
rather<00:02:52.900> than<00:02:53.019> having<00:02:53.349> to<00:02:53.470> do<00:02:53.620> option<00:02:54.069> three<00:02:54.280> I

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
rather than having to do option three I

00:02:54.310 --> 00:03:05.089 
rather than having to do option three I
can<00:02:54.519> do<00:02:54.610> option<00:02:55.180> number<00:02:55.329> two

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:05.099 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:07.550 

alright<00:03:05.670> here's<00:03:05.969> my<00:03:06.060> three<00:03:06.629> option<00:03:07.109> one<00:03:07.319> a

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
alright here's my three option one a

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:12.170 
alright here's my three option one a
little<00:03:08.459> bit<00:03:08.670> similar<00:03:10.909> right

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
little bit similar right

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.619 
little bit similar right
so<00:03:12.569> for<00:03:12.870> each<00:03:13.260> line<00:03:13.859> of<00:03:13.969> music<00:03:14.969> there<00:03:15.420> are

00:03:15.619 --> 00:03:15.629 
so for each line of music there are

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:18.199 
so for each line of music there are
three<00:03:16.200> different<00:03:16.829> variations<00:03:17.219> that<00:03:17.939> I've

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
three different variations that I've

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:20.479 
three different variations that I've
created<00:03:19.019> for<00:03:19.319> you<00:03:19.590> or<00:03:19.769> three<00:03:20.069> different

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
created for you or three different

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:23.720 
created for you or three different
options<00:03:20.849> as<00:03:21.599> I<00:03:21.719> call<00:03:21.989> them<00:03:22.200> okay<00:03:22.530> so<00:03:22.980> line<00:03:23.370> one

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
options as I call them okay so line one

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.970 
options as I call them okay so line one
has<00:03:24.180> option<00:03:24.599> one<00:03:24.810> option<00:03:25.049> two<00:03:25.290> or<00:03:25.650> option

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
has option one option two or option

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:27.649 
has option one option two or option
three<00:03:26.219> I've<00:03:26.549> written<00:03:26.819> them<00:03:27.000> all<00:03:27.150> out<00:03:27.329> for<00:03:27.569> you

00:03:27.649 --> 00:03:27.659 
three I've written them all out for you

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:29.360 
three I've written them all out for you
we<00:03:27.780> go<00:03:27.900> through<00:03:28.109> and<00:03:28.260> I<00:03:28.319> explain<00:03:28.739> each<00:03:28.980> one<00:03:29.010> of

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
we go through and I explain each one of

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.970 
we go through and I explain each one of
them<00:03:29.489> to<00:03:29.519> you<00:03:29.639> line<00:03:30.389> two<00:03:30.840> of<00:03:31.079> the<00:03:31.230> music<00:03:31.709> has

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
them to you line two of the music has

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.429 
them to you line two of the music has
three<00:03:32.639> different<00:03:32.849> options<00:03:33.510> so<00:03:34.109> what<00:03:34.319> you

00:03:34.429 --> 00:03:34.439 
three different options so what you

00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:36.339 
three different options so what you
could<00:03:34.590> do<00:03:34.680> is<00:03:34.799> you<00:03:34.889> can<00:03:34.980> go<00:03:35.129> from<00:03:35.370> line<00:03:35.999> one

00:03:36.339 --> 00:03:36.349 
could do is you can go from line one

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:40.009 
could do is you can go from line one
option<00:03:37.349> number<00:03:37.500> one<00:03:37.889> into<00:03:38.760> line<00:03:39.120> two<00:03:39.450> option

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 
option number one into line two option

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:41.990 
option number one into line two option
one<00:03:40.200> option<00:03:40.469> two<00:03:40.709> option<00:03:40.889> three<00:03:41.579> so<00:03:41.760> you<00:03:41.849> see

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
one option two option three so you see

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.439 
one option two option three so you see
how<00:03:42.150> you<00:03:42.209> could<00:03:42.510> start<00:03:42.719> to<00:03:42.900> create<00:03:43.199> your<00:03:43.680> own

00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:44.449 
how you could start to create your own

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:47.689 
how you could start to create your own
special<00:03:45.449> arrangement<00:03:46.230> okay<00:03:46.620> so<00:03:47.069> you<00:03:47.459> could<00:03:47.579> do

00:03:47.689 --> 00:03:47.699 
special arrangement okay so you could do

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:49.819 
special arrangement okay so you could do
all<00:03:47.879> the<00:03:48.299> option<00:03:48.750> ones<00:03:48.959> you<00:03:49.169> could<00:03:49.319> do<00:03:49.409> all<00:03:49.590> the

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:49.829 
all the option ones you could do all the

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:51.800 
all the option ones you could do all the
option<00:03:50.219> twos<00:03:50.459> all<00:03:50.790> the<00:03:51.000> option<00:03:51.449> threes

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
option twos all the option threes

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.379 
option twos all the option threes
alright<00:03:52.560> but<00:03:52.949> what<00:03:53.159> it<00:03:53.310> allows<00:03:53.639> you<00:03:53.879> to<00:03:54.000> do<00:03:54.180> is

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:54.389 
alright but what it allows you to do is

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:56.479 
alright but what it allows you to do is
kind<00:03:54.599> of<00:03:54.750> mix<00:03:55.109> and<00:03:55.349> mingle<00:03:55.620> and<00:03:55.949> take<00:03:56.189> what<00:03:56.370> you

00:03:59.119 --> 00:03:59.129 
like and leave the rest right so that

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:01.789 
like and leave the rest right so that
now<00:03:59.400> you<00:03:59.430> can<00:03:59.909> create<00:04:00.090> your<00:04:00.329> own<00:04:00.930> arrangement

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:01.799 
now you can create your own arrangement

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:05.330 
now you can create your own arrangement
and<00:04:01.919> most<00:04:02.549> important<00:04:03.409> what<00:04:04.409> this<00:04:04.620> technique

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
and most important what this technique

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.270 
and most important what this technique
should<00:04:06.030> start<00:04:06.329> to<00:04:06.480> show<00:04:06.780> you<00:04:06.840> is<00:04:07.199> that<00:04:07.230> oh<00:04:07.620> I

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
should start to show you is that oh I

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.490 
should start to show you is that oh I
have<00:04:08.370> different<00:04:08.969> variations<00:04:09.720> I<00:04:09.840> can<00:04:09.989> have<00:04:10.199> for

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
have different variations I can have for

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.920 
have different variations I can have for
each<00:04:10.680> different<00:04:11.220> line<00:04:11.459> of<00:04:11.489> music<00:04:12.000> right<00:04:12.689> and

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
each different line of music right and

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.430 
each different line of music right and
it<00:04:13.379> it's<00:04:13.769> it<00:04:14.159> it's<00:04:14.939> beneficial<00:04:15.930> to<00:04:16.259> you

it it's it it's beneficial to you
alright<00:04:16.889> so<00:04:17.250> write<00:04:17.639> out<00:04:17.669> or<00:04:18.180> to<00:04:18.329> have<00:04:18.570> these

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
alright so write out or to have these

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.289 
alright so write out or to have these
different<00:04:19.349> variations<00:04:20.070> right<00:04:20.190> teachers<00:04:21.180> that

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 
different variations right teachers that

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:22.879 
different variations right teachers that
I've<00:04:21.419> studied<00:04:21.690> with<00:04:21.959> we<00:04:22.349> would<00:04:22.530> write<00:04:22.710> out

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:22.889 
I've studied with we would write out

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:25.610 
I've studied with we would write out
different<00:04:23.509> harmonic<00:04:24.509> variations<00:04:25.169> for<00:04:25.440> each

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
different harmonic variations for each

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.339 
different harmonic variations for each
line<00:04:25.979> of<00:04:26.220> music<00:04:26.520> okay<00:04:27.090> and<00:04:27.300> we<00:04:27.630> kind<00:04:27.960> of<00:04:27.990> move

00:04:28.339 --> 00:04:28.349 
line of music okay and we kind of move

00:04:28.349 --> 00:04:29.930 
line of music okay and we kind of move
in<00:04:28.680> between<00:04:28.830> all<00:04:29.400> of<00:04:29.430> them

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 
in between all of them

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.240 
in between all of them
right<00:04:30.210> now<00:04:30.599> this<00:04:30.810> typically<00:04:31.289> for<00:04:31.380> a<00:04:31.680> musician

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:32.250 
right now this typically for a musician

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:34.520 
right now this typically for a musician
happens<00:04:32.940> boom<00:04:33.300> right<00:04:33.630> on<00:04:33.750> the<00:04:33.840> spot<00:04:34.080> on<00:04:34.320> the

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
happens boom right on the spot on the

reharmonization and new to this kind of

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:42.950 
reharmonization and new to this kind of
stuff<00:04:41.490> it's<00:04:41.820> kind<00:04:42.000> of<00:04:42.030> hard<00:04:42.300> to<00:04:42.360> do<00:04:42.570> it<00:04:42.690> right

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 
stuff it's kind of hard to do it right
