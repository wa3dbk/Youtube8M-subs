 hi beat you do not want to ride in a platoon 

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:13.900
 hi scott self- righteousness but unfortunately 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:16.740
 we have a big difference in levels 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:19.630
 maybe I should look for another one 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.670
 great idea beat but before you do it 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.750
 do i tell you about what 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:25.330
 there are platoons 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:30.270
 let's go 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:36.860
 I do not know and I do not know 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:36.860
 I don't know to do it and I don't know 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.210
 don't you accidentally know how he is 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.190

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:46.309
 square centimeter solidified 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:48.800
 lead in one second legally 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:51.230
 stefan-boltzmann energy radiated from 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.670
 absolutely black body on a certain 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.160
 plot for a certain amount 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.640
 time is directly proportional to the fourth 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:02.780
 degree of thermodynamic temperature 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:05.440
 the room is all you know I do not know that's not 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.440
