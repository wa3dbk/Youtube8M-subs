 advantages of weight and height despite the fact that 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.890
 judicial decisions have raised many questions 

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:26.860
 Specialists report by Anton 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:29.320

 not warming up a duel not a sea of ​​light 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:37.360
 sound and video 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.730
 Olympic was interested in only one 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.840
 Will the Russian knight stand and survive? 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:42.820
 alexander povetkin 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.980
 against the rest of Bulat Vladimir 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:49.870
 Klitschko and most importantly when they appear 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:51.550
 the heroes of this evening were greeted standing victories 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.309

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:58.510
 heart and eyes with the move went ahead and 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:00.820
 vomited and metal in the ring sometimes even 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.660
 Klitschko seemed confused with 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.119
 this attitude 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:06.549
 Russian could be a step away from victory but he 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:08.650
 there was not enough centimeters giant 

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:10.479
 Klitschko kept his opponent at a distance 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.520
 so he has it all worked out 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:16.770
 what he 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:19.079
 beats her immediately as it piles on the forest.

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.940

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.230
 all unwashed faces 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:30.480
 I understand why the referee did so much 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:32.220
 warning took one point but all 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.790
 Equal Klitschko Povetkin crushed his 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.590
 by hands 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.840
 is a violation of the rules of lean heavily 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.580

 sometimes he is one the other among others such 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:47.580
 get mad and even struggle 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.950

 Vladimir is better today 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.550
 Alexander Povetkin's achievement is not 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.649
 justified the predictions of most skeptics 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.690
 defeatists no knockout they 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.850

 I know that he was not just in the ring 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.820
 but despite everything to the very last 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.550
 seconds he tried to make a decisive blow 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:36.260
