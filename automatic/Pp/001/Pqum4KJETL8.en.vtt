00:00:59.280 --> 00:00:59.290 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:01.810 

well<00:01:00.290> the<00:01:00.440> causes<00:01:01.010> of<00:01:01.040> psoriasis<00:01:01.370> are

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 
well the causes of psoriasis are

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.180 
well the causes of psoriasis are
interesting<00:01:02.390> I<00:01:02.570> think<00:01:02.660> the<00:01:03.470> one<00:01:03.649> basic<00:01:04.159> thing

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:04.190 
interesting I think the one basic thing

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.520 
interesting I think the one basic thing
you<00:01:04.489> can<00:01:04.670> say<00:01:04.879> is<00:01:05.089> the<00:01:05.269> genetics<00:01:05.960> are<00:01:06.200> very

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
you can say is the genetics are very

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.790 
you can say is the genetics are very
important<00:01:07.159> and<00:01:07.430> in<00:01:08.420> any<00:01:08.750> individual<00:01:09.320> who<00:01:09.560> has

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:09.800 
important and in any individual who has

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.420 
important and in any individual who has
psoriasis<00:01:10.840> there<00:01:11.840> is<00:01:12.080> in<00:01:12.470> one<00:01:12.860> third<00:01:13.190> of

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430 
psoriasis there is in one third of

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.440 
psoriasis there is in one third of
people<00:01:13.640> a<00:01:14.000> family<00:01:14.540> history<00:01:14.780> of<00:01:15.290> psoriasis<00:01:16.450> now

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
people a family history of psoriasis now

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.859 
people a family history of psoriasis now
if<00:01:17.630> one<00:01:17.900> parent<00:01:18.410> has<00:01:19.070> psoriasis<00:01:19.360> the<00:01:20.360> chances

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:20.869 
if one parent has psoriasis the chances

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:23.530 
if one parent has psoriasis the chances
of<00:01:20.900> that<00:01:21.140> person's<00:01:21.710> children<00:01:22.280> having<00:01:23.180> the

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:23.540 
of that person's children having the

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.719 
of that person's children having the
same<00:01:23.780> condition<00:01:24.380> would<00:01:24.530> be<00:01:24.650> one<00:01:24.830> and<00:01:24.860> four<00:01:25.250> if

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:25.729 
same condition would be one and four if

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:29.530 
same condition would be one and four if
both<00:01:26.540> parents<00:01:26.869> have<00:01:27.740> psoriasis<00:01:28.070> the<00:01:29.060> chances

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540 
both parents have psoriasis the chances

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.960 
both parents have psoriasis the chances
increase<00:01:30.110> to<00:01:30.530> two<00:01:30.830> out<00:01:31.070> of<00:01:31.100> three<00:01:31.610> of<00:01:31.820> the

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:31.970 
increase to two out of three of the

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.650 
increase to two out of three of the
children<00:01:33.340> so<00:01:34.340> genetics<00:01:34.850> would<00:01:35.270> be<00:01:35.420> fairly

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:35.660 
children so genetics would be fairly

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:38.529 
children so genetics would be fairly
basic<00:01:36.190> there<00:01:37.190> are<00:01:37.369> other<00:01:37.550> factors<00:01:37.789> which<00:01:38.030> then

00:01:38.529 --> 00:01:38.539 
basic there are other factors which then

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:41.170 
basic there are other factors which then
can<00:01:38.780> be<00:01:38.899> superimposed<00:01:39.610> for<00:01:40.610> example

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:41.180 
can be superimposed for example

can be superimposed for example
psoriasis<00:01:42.080> can<00:01:42.259> be<00:01:42.410> precipitated<00:01:43.160> by<00:01:43.240> throat

psoriasis can be precipitated by throat

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.810 
psoriasis can be precipitated by throat

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:49.910 
infection and that can lead to a type of

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.120 
infection and that can lead to a type of
psoriasis<00:01:50.240> a<00:01:50.720> spotty<00:01:51.080> type<00:01:51.470> of<00:01:51.619> psoriasis

completely miserable you could have

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:01.330 
completely miserable you could have
localized<00:03:59.060> psoriasis<00:03:59.810> in<00:04:00.019> a<00:04:00.590> visible<00:04:00.919> site

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:01.340 
localized psoriasis in a visible site

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.819 
localized psoriasis in a visible site
that<00:04:01.909> was<00:04:02.030> very<00:04:02.299> disabling<00:04:02.900> for<00:04:03.139> example<00:04:03.650> on

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:03.829 
that was very disabling for example on

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:06.939 
that was very disabling for example on
fingers<00:04:04.549> and<00:04:04.879> it<00:04:05.569> might<00:04:05.750> stop<00:04:06.109> you<00:04:06.139> doing<00:04:06.799> your

00:04:06.939 --> 00:04:06.949

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:09.610 
fingers and it might stop you doing your
job<00:04:07.280> so<00:04:07.549> I<00:04:08.000> think<00:04:08.180> you'd<00:04:08.659> have<00:04:08.840> to<00:04:09.019> really<00:04:09.260> take

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:09.620 
job so I think you'd have to really take

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.589 
job so I think you'd have to really take
the<00:04:09.799> personal<00:04:10.299> circumstances<00:04:11.299> of<00:04:11.449> each

the personal circumstances of each

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:13.809 
the personal circumstances of each
person<00:04:12.139> into<00:04:12.409> account<00:04:12.769> before<00:04:13.519> making<00:04:13.760> a

00:04:13.809 --> 00:04:13.819 
person into account before making a

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:16.390 
person into account before making a
judgement<00:04:14.329> about<00:04:14.479> how<00:04:15.229> much<00:04:15.439> that<00:04:15.769> individual

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
judgement about how much that individual

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.219 
judgement about how much that individual
psoriasis<00:04:16.849> will<00:04:17.030> impact<00:04:17.299> on<00:04:17.539> their<00:04:17.720> lives<00:04:17.959> I

00:04:18.219 --> 00:04:18.229 
psoriasis will impact on their lives I

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:20.039 
psoriasis will impact on their lives I
think<00:04:18.889> it's<00:04:19.190> important<00:04:19.609> to<00:04:19.669> say<00:04:19.880> that

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049 
think it's important to say that

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:24.849 
think it's important to say that
psoriasis<00:04:21.049> is<00:04:21.229> not<00:04:21.380> an<00:04:21.530> infectious<00:04:22.130> condition
