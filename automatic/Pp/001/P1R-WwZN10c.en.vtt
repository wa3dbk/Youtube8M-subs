00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.059

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:28.069 
rest of my makeup and first of all I

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:31.089 
rest of my makeup and first of all I
think<00:02:28.130> the<00:02:28.670> shade<00:02:28.940> is<00:02:29.269> too<00:02:29.690> light<00:02:29.930> for<00:02:29.959> me<00:02:30.230> but

00:02:31.089 --> 00:02:31.099 
think the shade is too light for me but

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:34.720 
think the shade is too light for me but
moving<00:02:32.030> on<00:02:32.120> to<00:02:32.989> me<00:02:33.170> the<00:02:33.380> finish<00:02:33.799> is<00:02:33.950> not<00:02:33.980> 2.we<00:02:34.519> I

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
moving on to me the finish is not 2.we I

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.509 
moving on to me the finish is not 2.we I
think<00:02:35.090> this<00:02:35.209> is<00:02:35.360> a<00:02:35.390> semi<00:02:35.780> matte<00:02:36.079> finish<00:02:36.620> but<00:02:37.280> I

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:37.519

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:39.220 
think this is a semi matte finish but I
don't<00:02:37.790> think<00:02:38.000> it<00:02:38.090> claims<00:02:38.420> to<00:02:38.630> give<00:02:38.810> you<00:02:38.900> a<00:02:38.930> dewy

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
don't think it claims to give you a dewy

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.710 
don't think it claims to give you a dewy
finish<00:02:39.410> as<00:02:40.040> well<00:02:40.340> so<00:02:41.180> it<00:02:41.329> gives<00:02:41.569> you

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
finish as well so it gives you

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.900 
finish as well so it gives you
flawlessly<00:02:42.230> healthy<00:02:42.799> radiance<00:02:43.250> with<00:02:43.519> perfect

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
flawlessly healthy radiance with perfect

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.300 
flawlessly healthy radiance with perfect
coverage<00:02:44.359> and<00:02:44.569> long-lasting<00:02:45.139> hydration<00:02:45.350> so

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
coverage and long-lasting hydration so

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:48.370 
coverage and long-lasting hydration so
it<00:02:46.430> does<00:02:46.670> give<00:02:46.940> me<00:02:46.970> this<00:02:47.329> flawless<00:02:47.630> finish<00:02:48.079> and

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380 
it does give me this flawless finish and

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.890 
it does give me this flawless finish and
I<00:02:49.069> think<00:02:49.280> the<00:02:49.400> coverage<00:02:49.850> is<00:02:50.000> pretty<00:02:50.209> excellent

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
I think the coverage is pretty excellent

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.900 
I think the coverage is pretty excellent
as<00:02:51.049> well<00:02:51.079> so<00:02:51.470> it<00:02:51.590> was<00:02:51.739> really<00:02:52.130> easy<00:02:52.310> to<00:02:52.609> apply<00:02:52.819> I

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
as well so it was really easy to apply I

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:54.940 
as well so it was really easy to apply I
think<00:02:53.299> I<00:02:53.389> applied<00:02:53.750> too<00:02:53.989> much<00:02:54.230> so<00:02:54.560> keep<00:02:54.799> in<00:02:54.920> mind

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
think I applied too much so keep in mind

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.430 
think I applied too much so keep in mind
that<00:02:55.370> a<00:02:55.519> little<00:02:55.970> goes<00:02:56.150> a<00:02:56.180> long<00:02:56.480> way<00:02:56.750> if<00:02:57.200> you're

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
that a little goes a long way if you're

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:58.900 
that a little goes a long way if you're
someone<00:02:57.769> who's<00:02:57.920> sensitive<00:02:58.220> to<00:02:58.489> scents<00:02:58.700> like

me<00:02:59.239> keep<00:02:59.690> in<00:02:59.840> mind<00:03:00.049> that<00:03:00.170> this<00:03:00.350> one<00:03:00.530> diction

hi guys so it's now about 9:30 p.m. so
I've<00:03:39.680> had<00:03:39.920> this<00:03:40.040> foundation<00:03:40.460> on<00:03:40.550> for<00:03:40.940> almost

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:41.270 
I've had this foundation on for almost

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:44.020 
I've had this foundation on for almost
12<00:03:41.810> hours<00:03:41.990> so<00:03:42.950> the<00:03:43.160> foundation<00:03:43.670> still<00:03:43.880> looks

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030 
12 hours so the foundation still looks

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:46.300 
12 hours so the foundation still looks
the<00:03:44.270> same<00:03:44.570> I<00:03:44.900> have<00:03:45.320> dry<00:03:45.620> skin<00:03:45.650> and<00:03:46.130> most

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:46.310 
the same I have dry skin and most

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.400 
the same I have dry skin and most
foundations<00:03:46.910> say<00:03:47.120> exactly<00:03:47.750> the<00:03:47.870> same<00:03:48.110> on<00:03:48.260> my

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:48.410 
foundations say exactly the same on my

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:51.100 
foundations say exactly the same on my
skin<00:03:48.740> even<00:03:48.860> after<00:03:49.430> long<00:03:49.640> hours<00:03:49.880> because<00:03:50.750> I

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:51.110 
skin even after long hours because I

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:54.250 
skin even after long hours because I
don't<00:03:51.440> get<00:03:51.620> oily<00:03:52.100> I<00:03:52.340> wish<00:03:52.790> I<00:03:53.150> expected<00:03:54.110> this

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
don't get oily I wish I expected this

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:55.840 
don't get oily I wish I expected this
foundation<00:03:54.740> to<00:03:54.890> look<00:03:55.040> more<00:03:55.190> dewy<00:03:55.459> and

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:55.850 
foundation to look more dewy and

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:57.880 
foundation to look more dewy and
luminous<00:03:56.330> throughout<00:03:56.570> the<00:03:56.750> day<00:03:57.020> but<00:03:57.709> it

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:57.890 
luminous throughout the day but it

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:59.710 
luminous throughout the day but it
didn't<00:03:58.459> but<00:03:58.970> I<00:03:59.000> guess<00:03:59.209> that's<00:03:59.390> a<00:03:59.510> good<00:03:59.660> thing

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
didn't but I guess that's a good thing

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:01.480 
didn't but I guess that's a good thing
for<00:04:00.050> some<00:04:00.260> people<00:04:00.590> especially<00:04:00.680> if<00:04:01.190> you<00:04:01.280> have

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:01.490 
for some people especially if you have

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:03.850 
for some people especially if you have
oily<00:04:01.910> skin<00:04:01.940> but<00:04:02.780> because<00:04:03.050> I<00:04:03.170> have<00:04:03.320> dry<00:04:03.530> skin<00:04:03.560> I

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:03.860 
oily skin but because I have dry skin I

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:05.590 
oily skin but because I have dry skin I
expect<00:04:04.310> my<00:04:04.459> foundation<00:04:05.000> to<00:04:05.030> give<00:04:05.270> me<00:04:05.450> that

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:05.600 
expect my foundation to give me that

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.020 
expect my foundation to give me that

I'm wearing makeup maybe because the

definitely<00:04:24.410> use<00:04:25.010> this<00:04:25.250> for<00:04:25.520> special

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:25.700 
definitely use this for special

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:27.670 
definitely use this for special
occasions<00:04:26.510> where<00:04:26.750> I<00:04:26.780> need<00:04:27.080> to<00:04:27.110> look<00:04:27.410> more

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 
occasions where I need to look more

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:30.040 
occasions where I need to look more
made-up<00:04:28.220> okay<00:04:28.760> so<00:04:28.820> the<00:04:29.090> question<00:04:29.480> is<00:04:29.600> is<00:04:29.810> this

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 
made-up okay so the question is is this

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.110 
made-up okay so the question is is this
better<00:04:30.500> than<00:04:30.620> the<00:04:30.830> longish<00:04:31.280> one<00:04:31.520> because

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120 
better than the longish one because

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.970 
better than the longish one because
price-wise<00:04:32.690> there<00:04:33.080> is<00:04:33.200> a<00:04:33.230> huge<00:04:33.620> difference

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:33.980 
price-wise there is a huge difference

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.159 
price-wise there is a huge difference
between<00:04:34.400> these<00:04:34.880> two<00:04:35.150> well<00:04:35.570> personally<00:04:36.140> I

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:36.169 
between these two well personally I

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:37.659 
between these two well personally I
would<00:04:36.440> choose<00:04:36.560> an<00:04:36.740> aged<00:04:36.950> for<00:04:37.220> a<00:04:37.250> day-to-day

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:37.669 
would choose an aged for a day-to-day

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:40.030 
would choose an aged for a day-to-day
basis<00:04:38.360> because<00:04:38.720> it's<00:04:38.900> so<00:04:39.169> lightweight<00:04:39.470> it<00:04:40.010> has

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:40.040 
basis because it's so lightweight it has

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.400 
basis because it's so lightweight it has
a<00:04:40.220> light<00:04:40.580> to<00:04:40.760> medium<00:04:40.910> coverage<00:04:41.060> and<00:04:41.720> it<00:04:42.140> gives

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:42.410 
a light to medium coverage and it gives

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:44.710 
a light to medium coverage and it gives
me<00:04:42.650> that<00:04:42.680> nice<00:04:43.130> glowy<00:04:43.490> dewy<00:04:43.820> finish<00:04:44.180> that<00:04:44.600> I'm

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720 
me that nice glowy dewy finish that I'm

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.870 
me that nice glowy dewy finish that I'm
looking<00:04:44.900> for<00:04:45.080> so<00:04:45.560> for<00:04:46.100> me<00:04:46.250> this<00:04:46.400> also

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:46.880 
looking for so for me this also

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:48.190 
looking for so for me this also
perfecting<00:04:47.360> Christian<00:04:47.750> I<00:04:47.840> would<00:04:47.900> use<00:04:48.169> for

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:48.200 
perfecting Christian I would use for

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.440 
perfecting Christian I would use for
special<00:04:48.650> occasions<00:04:49.340> only<00:04:49.520> as<00:04:49.850> I<00:04:50.000> mentioned

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:50.450 
special occasions only as I mentioned

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:52.570 
special occasions only as I mentioned
before<00:04:50.660> so<00:04:51.530> I<00:04:51.560> don't<00:04:51.979> think<00:04:52.190> I<00:04:52.370> would

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:52.580 
before so I don't think I would

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:54.909 
before so I don't think I would
repurchase<00:04:52.750> but<00:04:53.750> it<00:04:54.020> really<00:04:54.229> depends<00:04:54.650> on<00:04:54.860> your

00:04:54.909 --> 00:04:54.919 
repurchase but it really depends on your

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:57.070 
repurchase but it really depends on your
preference<00:04:55.310> and<00:04:55.760> needs<00:04:56.120> I<00:04:56.419> think<00:04:56.540> if<00:04:56.840> you<00:04:56.930> have

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:57.080 
preference and needs I think if you have

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:58.840 
preference and needs I think if you have
mature<00:04:57.470> skin<00:04:57.500> you<00:04:57.830> will<00:04:58.040> benefit<00:04:58.520> more<00:04:58.790> from
