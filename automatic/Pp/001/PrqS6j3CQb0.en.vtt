00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.980
 do you think that you will exceed just a few speed limits in 

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:07.859
 Roads no problem so now you're going to change your mind mostly 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.190
 when we talk about trucks it's what we'll see now in another one 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:16.970
 special report on freight transport is a busy highway and 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.830
 similar to cars at the same speed sometimes 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:24.859
 engine technology allows trucks and trucks to 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:29.240
 not be so agile that often whoever is behind the wheel just remembers that 

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:31.329
 is carrying a pilot my name 

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:35.810
 all need to brake if you have to zarema side of gum and magazines and hold by 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:39.670
 the small excess speed may present a long period of time 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.870
 to prove it we twisted the vehicle that has a test track and who goes 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:45.510
 help us in this test 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.720
 I certainly will on Tuesday 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.200
 anyone you want can show 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.520
 we're going to show you exactly what for seven more 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.470
 whether at small speeds this speed at acceleration does not 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:00.150
 represents very much however with the problem is the time you need to stop 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:04.430
 the idea is to maintain the speed of 30 kilometers per hour 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.180
 I'm going to hit the brake, simulating an emergency situation 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:13.110
 let's go thirty miles an hour three horses laugh 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.780
 It was exactly here so let's go 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.020
 2 3 4 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.439
 4 steps 

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:26.710
 the truck stop let's signal that 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:29.880
 where the truck 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.579
 now I'm going to double my speed or turn 60 miles per hour 

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:35.070
 I only took four parts 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.229
 I should take it now 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:38.690
 four more and we'll signal that point 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:39.619
 Let's see what's going to happen. 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:43.420
 about veracity now I'm up to 60 miles per hour 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.420
 3 2 of the world 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.140
 we saw that we spent the one with the Nikkei we waited still much we will see 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:55.250
 how much 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.880
 the first was at already happened here thirty miles per hour 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.110
 I ran 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.800
 4 meters to stop the car 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.580
 we decided to change the speed to debut at the same point 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.330
 in theory should stop another four meters double 

00:02:11.929 --> 00:02:18.019
 however what happened was to stop 25 meters if there was a wall 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:19.539
 the truck would have entered 

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:20.380
 claudinho 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.110
 among the obstacles truck driver for more than 20 years each São Paulo 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:30.710
 accompanied every test I was impressed by the weather junino a defendant people 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:33.040
 this would take all this distance can stop 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.450
 you can fool 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.400
 the law in transit when ten points more you will never love me 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:47.319
 in a closed room the door is with us has seen an impressive scene 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:49.139
 where it accompanies explanation 

00:02:49.139 --> 00:02:52.749
 friedel plans anemia that we have to imagine speeding up 

00:02:52.749 --> 00:02:56.689
 of 160 kilometers per hour now imagine if we won three with a 

00:02:56.689 --> 00:03:00.029
 The science truck that 10 per hour as we have seen has already 

00:03:00.029 --> 00:03:03.690
 I did not want to do that would be too much trouble. 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.569
 for him to our team until the truck 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:10.879
 it's impressive even blow it doubled speed from 30 to 60 pounds per 

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:14.460
 hour, but the distance covered was six times 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:18.810
 ie the progression is avatar of these increases progressively now is 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.870
 important to remember is that the weight on the truck and should be distributed days 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.939
 and so it also distributed 

00:03:24.939 --> 00:03:28.099
 this is even verified in the scales that we find 

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:28.860
 highways 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.330
 to talk about this subject or reporters crecêncio is in a 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:36.000
 carrier are unloading a truck companies as to what to do to 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.619
 know the truck 

00:03:37.619 --> 00:03:41.319
 with a well distributed price the spurious ps how is that done 

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:45.700
 This was indeed an important logistical work. 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.059
 have a strategy that we show now we are here in a terminal 

00:03:49.059 --> 00:03:52.389
 avoid discharges from a carrier 

00:03:52.389 --> 00:03:57.229
 the inside of the chain of a lorry that has the capacity to 

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:59.250
 carry up to six tonnes 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.769
 the mantra here asks you the first one is true 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:06.309
 this is not all summoned so randomly serve the team 

00:04:07.059 --> 00:04:10.469
 and that big block here resulted there in the beginning 

00:04:10.469 --> 00:04:14.499
 in fact in the bodywork distributed within the local union 

00:04:14.499 --> 00:04:18.769
 of the weight being distributed with the trash on the sidewalk of the simple 

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:23.709
 is overweight on the scale the project is a person who works 

00:04:23.709 --> 00:04:25.120
 specifically 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.190
 close to the closing to deal with this issue enters the 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:33.719
 we have a manager of 

00:04:33.719 --> 00:04:38.059
 and it commands the entire charging system and it loads 

00:04:38.059 --> 00:04:42.479
 who accompanies the station trajectory and puts the earth changed place 

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:45.930
 bangcoc 8 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:48.120
 pressing the team will know 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.880
 the task of knowing the following how they do it as well as a company 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:55.500
 to talk about surveillance when a police officer for example opens for travel 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:57.290
 comments on the situation inside the truck 

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:00.340
 he finally managed to identify, he said, adding that the new 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:04.310
 willingness to attack to accept put the ball in the balance throwing it 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:08.500
 can not be sure that the situation will not be repeated 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:10.889
 mainly of finding 

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:14.059
 the difference if it's a fall 

00:05:14.059 --> 00:05:17.189
 forget would find it trickier to get - yes 

00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:20.169
 there is the possibility of cpi 

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:22.249
 those housed in the information 

00:05:22.249 --> 00:05:23.930
 we grew from campinas 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:26.539
 Thank you, thank you for the animation with your presence with 

00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:28.389
 people here in the studio 

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:32.999
 and the lowest fine for an excess of 85 reais but it can reach 

00:05:33.789 --> 00:05:37.799
 ten thousand reais depending on the price registered now Eduardo
