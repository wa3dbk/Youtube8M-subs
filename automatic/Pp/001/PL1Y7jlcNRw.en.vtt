00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:30.680
 very famous cube 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.880

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.430
 to one of the eligible characters 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.790
 what you have to do 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.360
 to the best style 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.360
 dt the almost gerardo we had armed 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.520
 but without objects 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.520
 grabbing him to hit as we can see here 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:14.370
 hitting enemies that do not come to Spain 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.570
 as you can see 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.570
 there are different types of grip and all that 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.690
 that we can continue perfecting throughout the game 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.810
 the young man comes up with several scenes like these 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.560
 do not speak 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.899
 ciudad condal a bit the story of a newborn girl 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:35.350
 Pretty good 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.400
 for what the console 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.910
 and well also has eta murdered I do not get out of using weapons 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:42.710
 which are very limited 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.890
 but they will not sweat enough 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:47.760
 as I also told to empower vicens 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.220
 like these wells that will give you a little life 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.730
 the way we see it 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:56.470
 up to the left 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:58.850
 a little lower 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.969
 is the life of our enemies that we are attacking at this moment 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.310
 to the left but on the side below we have the grenades 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:07.810
 what we have 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.810
 and susan with the button 

00:02:12.429 --> 00:02:15.829
 the amount we have 

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:18.539
 come for example came knife appeared knife 

00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:20.339
 and in the center above 

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:23.339
 we have the time that we have left 

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:26.679
 it happened to explain a bit the buttons 

00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:29.679
 with it we grab the objects 

00:02:30.399 --> 00:02:33.189
 united where there is just to follow 

00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:36.189
 but wait for the scene to pass while we see it 

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:44.129
 buenavista we approach the final enemy 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:48.069

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:54.339
 and I'm going to show you the NATO 

00:02:54.339 --> 00:02:55.379
 with her 

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:58.379
 we stick and grab the objects that are on the floor 

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:02.409
 with the plan and what we can do is high 

00:03:03.749 --> 00:03:06.569
 and just as it was very classic in games 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:09.989
 if we jump and hit a flying kick in the air 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:13.869
 Nicolas is what we are going to do 

00:03:13.869 --> 00:03:15.069
 stretched 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:18.069

 penn that a camacho are are complicating 

00:03:35.469 --> 00:03:37.279
 this radar 

00:03:37.279 --> 00:03:40.379
 with this we will be able to escape some complicated enemies 

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:44.399
 isidro while we were running we pressed the button to hope that in this case 

00:03:44.399 --> 00:03:45.929
 it would be the 

00:03:45.929 --> 00:03:48.999
 what we can do this year a kick 

00:03:48.999 --> 00:03:51.999
 that goes forward i will not simplify 

00:03:52.619 --> 00:03:56.049
 Don Juan Mazatlan and many enemies at once 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:59.079

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:02.699
 meanwhile in the background as the bet 

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:03.719
 wanted 

00:04:03.719 --> 00:04:06.719
 in a couple of reports to such I was commenting 

00:04:08.279 --> 00:04:09.569
 what are we 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:12.259
 well, better said, estoril 

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:16.389
 doing in the official website good and we won the official website of level zeta 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:22.720
 that there are going to be able to download the videos or watch them download to body or photovoltaics 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:23.449

 of honey was carved the shell of the parrot 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:32.029
 the amb how is 

00:04:32.029 --> 00:04:34.379
 the common story stack 

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:37.379
 without focusing on the idea as we were doing 

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:41.150
 it's good, everything has its part not 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:42.169
 they are going to moderate 

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:45.169
 get off on practically everything related to the program 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:49.479
 by blind year 

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:50.719
 as well 

00:04:50.719 --> 00:04:53.659
 not obviously through the web advance 

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:55.270
 I'm doing 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:58.330
 different 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:01.330
 in different types of lasers such as could be a future 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:05.490
 a master and it is only what comes to mind 

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:09.959
 also keep a good club to comment Chinese team soon a 

00:05:09.959 --> 00:05:10.689
 background 

00:05:10.689 --> 00:05:14.209
 later when the page is completely finished there more or less 

00:05:14.209 --> 00:05:15.479
 visitable 

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:19.430
 I'll pass the address so you can communicate with us or fuck a 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:20.939
 just fucking 

00:05:20.939 --> 00:05:24.429
 whatever happens to them while they train in whatever they come up 

00:05:25.499 --> 00:05:28.989
 good going back to the game perhaps we advance level as you will see 

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:32.210
 we went out to a pool 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:35.379
 to enter the house of santa ticket and kill him 

00:05:35.379 --> 00:05:38.839
 it's not in the movie here I do not know if they are travolta I do not think but good 

00:05:40.069 --> 00:05:44.550
 the fire has several varied enemies especially the finals are pretty 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:45.360
 original 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:48.360
 and always following the fidelity of the comic 

00:05:50.219 --> 00:05:52.259
 time is running out 

00:05:52.259 --> 00:05:56.560
 I recommend you not see upcoming reports because we will continue to see 

00:05:56.559 --> 00:05:59.279
 how the game develops 

00:05:59.279 --> 00:06:01.689
 i a couple of more concepts 

00:06:01.689 --> 00:06:04.199
 so you can take the flow 

00:06:04.199 --> 00:06:05.290
 good guys 

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:07.589
 this was the initial tipal 

00:06:07.589 --> 00:06:09.360
