00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
to make this exhibit I think it's not

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.680 
to make this exhibit I think it's not
just<00:02:09.850> significant<00:02:12.120> the<00:02:13.120> entire<00:02:13.390> world

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
just significant the entire world

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:27.180 
just significant the entire world
abruptly<00:02:22.050> South<00:02:23.050> Africa<00:02:23.500> is<00:02:25.950> the<00:02:26.950> leading

multi-nation having just wanna walk up
and<00:02:30.450> I<00:02:31.450> think<00:02:32.380> that<00:02:32.790> you<00:02:33.790> look<00:02:33.820> at<00:02:34.030> the<00:02:34.120> leading

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
and I think that you look at the leading

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:38.910 
and I think that you look at the leading
