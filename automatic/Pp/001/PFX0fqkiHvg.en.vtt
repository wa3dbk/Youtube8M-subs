00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:33.130 
block as engines really hot I've just
worked<00:01:27.200> it<00:01:27.470> good<00:01:29.410> but<00:01:30.410> it<00:01:30.530> it<00:01:31.070> broke<00:01:31.430> off<00:01:32.140> right

very surprised how powerful this little
sparkplug<00:03:13.670> made<00:03:14.570> it<00:03:14.800> I<00:03:15.800> got<00:03:16.550> it<00:03:16.700> for<00:03:16.850> this<00:03:17.060> kit

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
sparkplug made it I got it for this kit

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.560 
sparkplug made it I got it for this kit
well<00:03:18.230> I<00:03:18.530> will<00:03:19.220> happen<00:03:19.580> to<00:03:19.670> look<00:03:19.820> online<00:03:20.030> and<00:03:20.420> I

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 
that on the spark very hot spark plug

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:46.140 
that on the spark very hot spark plug
two<00:03:41.050> says<00:03:42.050> it<00:03:42.230> right<00:03:42.650> there<00:03:43.390> wow<00:03:44.390> it's<00:03:44.600> melting

two says it right there wow it's melting
it<00:03:47.150> uh<00:03:48.070> it<00:03:49.070> puts<00:03:49.370> out<00:03:49.520> a<00:03:49.550> very<00:03:50.030> good<00:03:50.420> amount<00:03:50.720> of

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
it uh it puts out a very good amount of

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.340 
it uh it puts out a very good amount of
torque<00:03:51.170> I<00:03:51.470> can<00:03:52.100> now<00:03:53.060> I<00:03:53.540> can<00:03:53.750> just<00:03:53.990> sit<00:03:54.170> in<00:03:54.260> the

snow and take off the thing that car
will<00:03:57.230> just<00:03:57.440> spin<00:03:57.770> out<00:03:58.210> it's<00:03:59.210> very<00:03:59.390> powerful

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.200 
will just spin out it's very powerful

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:13.870 
thing I have done I break get that away
from<00:04:12.709> the<00:04:12.800> cylinder<00:04:13.070> head<00:04:13.250> before<00:04:13.430> it<00:04:13.640> melts

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:13.880 
from the cylinder head before it melts

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:22.660 
from the cylinder head before it melts
it<00:04:16.750> is<00:04:18.790> that's<00:04:20.109> actually<00:04:21.109> the<00:04:21.859> only<00:04:22.100> reason<00:04:22.370> it

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:22.670 
it is that's actually the only reason it

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:25.450 
it is that's actually the only reason it
sounds<00:04:22.790> a<00:04:23.000> little<00:04:23.090> different<00:04:23.300> is<00:04:23.720> uh<00:04:24.460> because

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
sounds a little different is uh because

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:28.900 
sounds a little different is uh because
I<00:04:25.790> took<00:04:26.570> the<00:04:26.870> baffle<00:04:27.860> knocked<00:04:28.250> the<00:04:28.340> baffle<00:04:28.730> but

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:28.910 
I took the baffle knocked the baffle but

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:34.500 
I took the baffle knocked the baffle but
the<00:04:29.230> bottom<00:04:30.230> end<00:04:30.470> of<00:04:30.620> the<00:04:31.130> muffler<00:04:31.340> out<00:04:32.290> no

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:34.510 
the bottom end of the muffler out no

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:39.040 
the bottom end of the muffler out no
it's<00:04:35.510> very<00:04:36.260> good<00:04:36.650> now<00:04:37.310> I'm<00:04:38.270> very<00:04:38.330> happy<00:04:38.870> with

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.050 
it's very good now I'm very happy with

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:44.850 
it's very good now I'm very happy with
it<00:04:39.520> my<00:04:41.380> speedometer<00:04:42.380> told<00:04:43.310> me<00:04:43.490> I<00:04:43.520> was<00:04:43.760> going<00:04:43.940> in

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:44.860 
it my speedometer told me I was going in

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:50.680 
it my speedometer told me I was going in
34<00:04:46.450> close<00:04:47.450> to<00:04:47.600> 35<00:04:48.050> ish<00:04:48.290> if<00:04:48.890> I<00:04:49.070> uh<00:04:49.100> if<00:04:49.760> I<00:04:50.330> throttle

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:50.690 
34 close to 35 ish if I uh if I throttle

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:52.480 
34 close to 35 ish if I uh if I throttle
it<00:04:50.780> just<00:04:51.020> right<00:04:51.230> yeah<00:04:51.560> it's<00:04:51.860> getting<00:04:52.040> too<00:04:52.280> hot

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:52.490 
it just right yeah it's getting too hot

00:04:52.490 --> 00:05:01.000 
it just right yeah it's getting too hot
you<00:04:52.850> can<00:04:53.060> see<00:04:53.270> it<00:04:54.940> it<00:04:55.940> is<00:04:56.180> getting<00:04:56.480> hot<00:04:59.350> it<00:05:00.350> it

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:01.010 
you can see it it is getting hot it it

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:03.220 
you can see it it is getting hot it it
puts<00:05:01.400> out<00:05:01.550> a<00:05:01.820> very<00:05:02.090> powerful<00:05:02.300> spark<00:05:02.870> it<00:05:03.080> was

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:03.230 
puts out a very powerful spark it was

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:05.280 
puts out a very powerful spark it was
getting<00:05:03.530> red<00:05:03.740> I<00:05:04.010> know<00:05:04.340> it<00:05:04.610> was<00:05:04.730> getting<00:05:05.030> red

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:05.290 
getting red I know it was getting red

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:10.030 
getting red I know it was getting red
I'm<00:05:06.290> gonna<00:05:06.500> have<00:05:06.710> to<00:05:08.380> have<00:05:09.380> to<00:05:09.500> do<00:05:09.620> something

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:10.040 
I'm gonna have to have to do something

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:12.790 
I'm gonna have to have to do something
because<00:05:10.850> it<00:05:11.240> you<00:05:11.600> can<00:05:11.780> eat<00:05:12.140> I<00:05:12.320> know<00:05:12.380> you<00:05:12.560> guys

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:12.800 
because it you can eat I know you guys

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:17.020 
because it you can eat I know you guys
can<00:05:13.040> see<00:05:13.220> it's<00:05:13.490> very<00:05:13.610> fuzzy<00:05:14.210> but<00:05:14.630> it<00:05:15.470> is<00:05:16.220> it<00:05:16.820> was

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:17.030 
can see it's very fuzzy but it is it was

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:19.390 
can see it's very fuzzy but it is it was
it<00:05:17.479> was<00:05:17.690> red<00:05:17.930> it<00:05:18.650> was<00:05:18.830> putting<00:05:19.100> out<00:05:19.220> some

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:19.400 
it was red it was putting out some

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.059 
it was red it was putting out some
serious<00:05:19.729> power<00:05:20.050> it<00:05:21.050> was<00:05:21.229> using

00:05:22.059 --> 00:05:22.069 
serious power it was using

00:05:22.069 --> 00:05:24.219 
serious power it was using
it<00:05:22.550> was<00:05:22.699> taking<00:05:23.089> all<00:05:23.240> the<00:05:23.389> powers<00:05:23.719> I<00:05:23.869> think<00:05:24.110> was

00:05:24.219 --> 00:05:24.229 
it was taking all the powers I think was

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:26.379 
it was taking all the powers I think was
given<00:05:24.559> out<00:05:24.680> and<00:05:24.949> it<00:05:25.159> must<00:05:25.369> have<00:05:25.430> been<00:05:25.520> quite<00:05:26.150> a

00:05:26.379 --> 00:05:26.389 
given out and it must have been quite a

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:29.679 
given out and it must have been quite a
bit<00:05:26.719> because<00:05:27.909> that's<00:05:28.909> probably<00:05:29.119> we're<00:05:29.659> in

00:05:29.679 --> 00:05:29.689 
bit because that's probably we're in

00:05:29.689 --> 00:05:31.629 
bit because that's probably we're in
really<00:05:29.990> high<00:05:30.259> I<00:05:30.619> need<00:05:30.800> to<00:05:30.949> I<00:05:31.129> need<00:05:31.219> to<00:05:31.399> do

00:05:31.629 --> 00:05:31.639 
really high I need to I need to do

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:32.649 
really high I need to I need to do
something<00:05:32.029> about<00:05:32.119> that

00:05:32.649 --> 00:05:32.659 
something about that

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:39.129 
something about that
well<00:05:34.659> so<00:05:35.659> far<00:05:35.839> runs<00:05:36.289> very<00:05:36.889> good<00:05:38.139> it's

00:05:39.129 --> 00:05:39.139 
well so far runs very good it's

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:40.929 
well so far runs very good it's
tremendous<00:05:39.800> amount<00:05:40.069> of<00:05:40.099> torque<00:05:40.399> I<00:05:40.610> just<00:05:40.789> got

00:05:40.929 --> 00:05:40.939 
tremendous amount of torque I just got

00:05:40.939 --> 00:05:42.339 
tremendous amount of torque I just got
to<00:05:41.029> fix<00:05:41.210> that<00:05:41.330> problem<00:05:41.389> before<00:05:41.749> it<00:05:41.960> turns<00:05:42.139> into

00:05:42.339 --> 00:05:42.349 
to fix that problem before it turns into

00:05:42.349 --> 00:05:42.999 
to fix that problem before it turns into
a<00:05:42.469> big<00:05:42.649> one

00:05:42.999 --> 00:05:43.009 
a big one

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:47.439 
a big one
because<00:05:43.729> I<00:05:44.389> don't<00:05:45.259> want<00:05:45.439> I<00:05:45.649> don't<00:05:46.129> want<00:05:46.449> this

00:05:47.439 --> 00:05:47.449 
because I don't want I don't want this

00:05:47.449 --> 00:05:50.589 
because I don't want I don't want this
sparkplug<00:05:48.050> to<00:05:48.169> go<00:05:48.289> bad<00:05:48.469> but<00:05:48.770> it<00:05:49.129> has<00:05:49.569> avert<00:05:50.569> it

00:05:50.589 --> 00:05:50.599 
sparkplug to go bad but it has avert it

00:05:50.599 --> 00:05:54.760 
sparkplug to go bad but it has avert it
has<00:05:50.869> a<00:05:51.129> warranty<00:05:52.129> on<00:05:52.159> it<00:05:52.490> so<00:05:52.999> if<00:05:53.869> it<00:05:53.990> goes<00:05:54.110> bad<00:05:54.439> I
