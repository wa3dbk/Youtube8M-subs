00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:16.230 
all and also you need a little bit of

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:19.490 
all and also you need a little bit of
weight<00:01:17.420> so<00:01:18.420> you<00:01:18.510> need<00:01:18.630> to<00:01:18.870> like<00:01:19.140> it's<00:01:19.320> like<00:01:19.470> a

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
weight so you need to like it's like a

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.310 
weight so you need to like it's like a
sandwich<00:01:19.980> now<00:01:20.580> you<00:01:20.640> put<00:01:20.970> it<00:01:21.000> down<00:01:21.240> and<00:01:21.540> make
