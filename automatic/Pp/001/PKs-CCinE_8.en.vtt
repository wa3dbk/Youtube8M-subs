 Adam inherited the psalmist 

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:14.840
 God understands perfectly what you 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:17.340
 you have spent us not so much because if 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:20.700

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.020
 well maybe I did not open my mouth or do not know 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.910
 they understood well the words that I 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.189
 I was saying but I know that God of 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:30.470
 heart understood what was coming 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.470
 from my mouth they are both in piety 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.699
 I have been praying Lord Jesus Christ that I 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.590
 help and get to the final and then look 

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:40.230

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.360

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.460
 I dare to ask the Lord to help me 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.559
 succeed whatever it is to succeed in 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.199
 this grand finale I already feel winner 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.210
 I feel victorious because from the 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:53.280
 The goal was to reach the 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.309
 end singing to God and then here 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:00.079
 I'm already in the final and if God wants 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.079
 that I win is more than a blessing 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:06.799
