talked about in previous episodes that's
the<00:00:08.670> trade<00:00:09.599> growing<00:00:09.840> wheatgrass<00:00:10.050> which<00:00:10.620> has

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
spring with spring wheat grass but we

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.560 
spring with spring wheat grass but we
prefer<00:00:35.070> it<00:00:35.130> tines<00:00:35.430> to<00:00:35.700> grow<00:00:35.910> winter<00:00:36.239> wheat

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
prefer it tines to grow winter wheat

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.780 
prefer it tines to grow winter wheat
grass<00:00:36.780> so<00:00:37.500> it's<00:00:37.620> planted<00:00:37.860> in<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.010> fall<00:00:38.040> when

grass and the long roots carries it

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.950 
grass and the long roots carries it
through<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.800> winter<00:00:59.129> it<00:00:59.850> snows<00:01:00.210> it's<00:01:00.690> cold

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
through the winter it snows it's cold

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.020 
through the winter it snows it's cold
it's<00:01:01.320> freezing<00:01:01.379> most<00:01:01.949> days<00:01:02.219> and<00:01:02.520> then<00:01:02.910> the

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
it's freezing most days and then the

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.899 
it's freezing most days and then the
spring<00:01:03.359> is<00:01:04.140> slowly<00:01:04.439> but<00:01:04.619> surely<00:01:04.650> a<00:01:05.189> week<00:01:05.610> after

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
spring is slowly but surely a week after

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.510 
spring is slowly but surely a week after
week<00:01:06.090> and<00:01:06.240> gets<00:01:06.390> greener<00:01:06.659> lusher<00:01:07.560> doesn't

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
week and gets greener lusher doesn't

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.859 
week and gets greener lusher doesn't
grow<00:01:08.610> too<00:01:08.670> much<00:01:08.820> in<00:01:09.119> height<00:01:09.299> but<00:01:09.510> it<00:01:09.630> just<00:01:09.720> gets

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
grow too much in height but it just gets

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.929 
grow too much in height but it just gets
greener<00:01:10.229> and<00:01:10.439> greener<00:01:10.500> so<00:01:11.189> finally<00:01:11.610> it<00:01:11.760> is<00:01:11.909> a

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
greener and greener so finally it is a

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.420 
greener and greener so finally it is a
ready<00:01:12.659> to<00:01:12.810> be<00:01:12.900> harvested<00:01:13.140> as<00:01:13.560> far<00:01:14.100> as<00:01:14.220> we<00:01:14.400> are

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
ready to be harvested as far as we are

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.310 
ready to be harvested as far as we are
concerned<00:01:14.549> this<00:01:15.509> is<00:01:15.570> where<00:01:15.869> you<00:01:15.990> get<00:01:16.140> into

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
concerned this is where you get into

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.530 
concerned this is where you get into
this<00:01:16.560> distinction<00:01:17.280> between<00:01:17.850> true<00:01:18.330> wheat

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
this distinction between true wheat

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.170 
this distinction between true wheat
grass<00:01:18.750> such<00:01:19.110> as<00:01:19.259> we<00:01:19.409> grow<00:01:19.650> at<00:01:19.920> pines<00:01:20.340> and<00:01:20.640> what

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
grass such as we grow at pines and what

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.510 
grass such as we grow at pines and what
they<00:01:21.299> call<00:01:21.509> flag<00:01:21.720> grass<00:01:22.229> which<00:01:22.560> is<00:01:22.590> really<00:01:23.400> not

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
they call flag grass which is really not

flag<00:01:46.950> grass<00:01:47.670> which<00:01:48.000> is<00:01:48.149> really<00:01:48.360> not<00:01:48.509> wheat

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
flag grass which is really not wheat

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.780 
flag grass which is really not wheat
grass<00:01:48.869> at<00:01:49.049> all<00:01:49.170> it's<00:01:49.320> a<00:01:49.470> it's<00:01:49.920> after<00:01:50.430> the

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
grass at all it's a it's after the

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.850 
grass at all it's a it's after the
jointing<00:01:51.149> stage<00:01:51.210> it's<00:01:52.020> after<00:01:52.409> it<00:01:52.500> starts<00:01:52.770> to

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
jointing stage it's after it starts to

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.679 
jointing stage it's after it starts to
grow<00:01:53.040> now<00:01:53.490> as<00:01:53.729> you<00:01:53.880> can<00:01:54.000> see<00:01:54.180> on<00:01:54.299> the<00:01:54.390> ruler

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
grow now as you can see on the ruler

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.230 
grow now as you can see on the ruler
here<00:01:54.899> there's<00:01:55.470> about<00:01:55.649> five<00:01:56.640> times<00:01:56.969> more

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
here there's about five times more

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.690 
here there's about five times more
growth<00:01:57.570> here<00:01:58.380> than<00:01:58.860> there<00:01:59.009> is<00:01:59.070> in<00:01:59.130> true<00:01:59.460> blue

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
growth here than there is in true blue

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.179 
growth here than there is in true blue
wheat<00:01:59.969> grass<00:02:00.180> so<00:02:00.750> what<00:02:01.229> happens<00:02:01.619> is<00:02:01.799> that<00:02:02.009> most

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
wheat grass so what happens is that most

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.389 
wheat grass so what happens is that most
companies<00:02:02.310> are<00:02:03.350> dehydrating<00:02:04.350> and<00:02:04.439> harvesting

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
companies are dehydrating and harvesting

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.520 
companies are dehydrating and harvesting
flag<00:02:05.729> grass<00:02:06.060> and<00:02:06.420> calling<00:02:07.140> it<00:02:07.229> wheatgrass

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
flag grass and calling it wheatgrass

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.619 
flag grass and calling it wheatgrass
which<00:02:07.860> it<00:02:08.009> really<00:02:08.160> isn't<00:02:08.369> it's<00:02:08.700> really<00:02:09.090> flat

it it's just lush in this picture you

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.880 
it it's just lush in this picture you
can<00:02:19.209> see<00:02:19.239> here's<00:02:19.870> a<00:02:19.930> wider<00:02:20.200> place<00:02:20.560> on<00:02:20.769> the

can see here's a wider place on the

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.399 
can see here's a wider place on the
stalks<00:02:21.189> where<00:02:21.519> the<00:02:21.640> seed<00:02:21.879> head<00:02:22.120> is<00:02:22.359> and<00:02:22.719> then

00:02:23.399 --> 00:02:23.409 
stalks where the seed head is and then

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:25.289 
stalks where the seed head is and then
this<00:02:23.560> other<00:02:23.739> picture<00:02:24.099> we<00:02:24.219> cut<00:02:24.609> that<00:02:24.819> seed

00:02:25.289 --> 00:02:25.299 
this other picture we cut that seed

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:27.720 
this other picture we cut that seed
that's<00:02:25.959> wide<00:02:26.439> place<00:02:26.769> with<00:02:27.010> our<00:02:27.040> fingernail<00:02:27.549> to

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
that's wide place with our fingernail to

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.869 
that's wide place with our fingernail to
show<00:02:27.939> inside<00:02:28.780> that<00:02:28.989> stalk<00:02:29.379> is<00:02:29.709> the<00:02:30.370> seed<00:02:30.609> head

00:02:30.869 --> 00:02:30.879 
show inside that stalk is the seed head

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:33.420 
show inside that stalk is the seed head
now<00:02:31.239> this<00:02:31.450> seed<00:02:31.720> head<00:02:31.959> was<00:02:32.500> created<00:02:33.250> because

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
now this seed head was created because

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:34.949 
now this seed head was created because
of<00:02:33.790> nutrition<00:02:34.269> in<00:02:34.420> the<00:02:34.540> wheat<00:02:34.689> grass

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
of nutrition in the wheat grass

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:37.140 
of nutrition in the wheat grass
but<00:02:35.739> since<00:02:35.980> the<00:02:36.189> wheat<00:02:36.340> grass<00:02:36.459> is<00:02:36.730> no<00:02:36.879> longer

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
but since the wheat grass is no longer

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.050 
but since the wheat grass is no longer
there<00:02:37.450> it<00:02:38.079> is<00:02:38.260> actually<00:02:38.470> gone<00:02:39.370> to<00:02:39.639> make<00:02:39.819> the

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
there it is actually gone to make the

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.030 
there it is actually gone to make the
seat<00:02:40.299> so<00:02:40.840> you're<00:02:40.989> getting<00:02:41.230> five<00:02:41.470> times<00:02:41.799> more

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
seat so you're getting five times more

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.129 
seat so you're getting five times more
product<00:02:42.519> per<00:02:42.639> acre<00:02:42.849> with<00:02:43.480> the<00:02:43.569> flag<00:02:43.810> grass

product per acre with the flag grass

00:02:44.139 --> 00:02:45.720 
product per acre with the flag grass
than<00:02:44.379> you<00:02:44.469> are<00:02:44.650> with<00:02:44.829> the<00:02:44.950> wheat<00:02:45.099> grass<00:02:45.280> that's

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
than you are with the wheat grass that's

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.429 
than you are with the wheat grass that's
why<00:02:45.970> most<00:02:46.299> of<00:02:46.569> the<00:02:46.659> products<00:02:47.230> that<00:02:47.290> are<00:02:47.349> sold

00:02:47.429 --> 00:02:47.439 
why most of the products that are sold

00:02:47.439 --> 00:02:49.399 
why most of the products that are sold
on<00:02:47.799> the<00:02:47.889> market<00:02:47.920> that<00:02:48.310> they<00:02:48.430> are<00:02:48.700> flag<00:02:49.060> grass

let's look at some products and so you

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.399 
let's look at some products and so you
can<00:03:09.519> get<00:03:09.639> a<00:03:09.669> better<00:03:09.819> idea<00:03:09.909> of<00:03:10.329> the<00:03:10.989> difference

00:03:11.399 --> 00:03:11.409 
can get a better idea of the difference

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:13.319 
can get a better idea of the difference
between<00:03:11.470> for<00:03:12.159> the<00:03:12.189> color<00:03:12.489> of<00:03:12.819> true<00:03:13.120> wheat

darker<00:04:48.500> but<00:04:48.919> it's<00:04:49.220> mostly<00:04:49.729> because<00:04:49.940> the

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:50.210 
darker but it's mostly because the

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:51.850 
darker but it's mostly because the
humidity<00:04:50.630> has<00:04:50.720> gotten<00:04:51.080> into<00:04:51.289> this<00:04:51.410> product

like Pines wheatgrass one way we can

00:06:26.419 --> 00:06:29.290 
like Pines wheatgrass one way we can
test<00:06:26.630> the<00:06:26.949> true<00:06:27.949> color<00:06:28.219> is<00:06:28.490> to<00:06:28.849> add<00:06:28.969> a<00:06:29.000> little

bit of water we'll add a milliliter of
water<00:06:31.039> teach<00:06:31.820> one<00:06:32.060> of<00:06:32.150> these<00:06:32.330> I<00:06:32.659> made<00:06:33.529> a<00:06:33.589> little

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:33.740 
water teach one of these I made a little

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:35.150 
water teach one of these I made a little
dent<00:06:34.039> in<00:06:34.159> each<00:06:34.339> one

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:35.160 
dent in each one

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:47.780 
dent in each one
to<00:06:36.160> deal<00:06:36.370> with<00:06:36.520> that

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:47.790 

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:50.830 

now<00:06:48.360> you<00:06:48.420> can<00:06:48.630> see<00:06:48.840> that<00:06:49.020> Pines<00:06:49.320> wheatgrass

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:50.840 
now you can see that Pines wheatgrass

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:53.300 
now you can see that Pines wheatgrass
this<00:06:51.840> particular<00:06:52.320> one<00:06:52.470> here<00:06:52.770> the<00:06:53.070> water

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:53.310 
this particular one here the water

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:55.760 
this particular one here the water
absorbed<00:06:53.790> very<00:06:53.910> quickly<00:06:54.240> which<00:06:54.960> is<00:06:54.990> good<00:06:55.200> and

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:55.770 
absorbed very quickly which is good and

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:58.610 
absorbed very quickly which is good and
it's<00:06:56.280> a<00:06:56.370> very<00:06:56.610> dark<00:06:56.850> green<00:06:57.260> this<00:06:58.260> one<00:06:58.470> has

00:06:58.610 --> 00:06:58.620 
it's a very dark green this one has

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:02.030 
it's a very dark green this one has
become<00:06:58.920> a<00:06:59.520> more<00:07:00.030> of<00:07:00.090> a<00:07:00.180> dark<00:07:00.450> brown<00:07:00.800> this<00:07:01.800> one

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:03.140 
become a more of a dark brown this one
that<00:07:02.250> we<00:07:02.310> had<00:07:02.460> turned<00:07:02.640> a<00:07:02.700> darker<00:07:02.970> color

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:03.150 
that we had turned a darker color

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:05.240 
that we had turned a darker color
because<00:07:03.390> humidity<00:07:03.870> isn't<00:07:04.200> as<00:07:04.530> it<00:07:04.800> turns<00:07:05.010> out

because humidity isn't as it turns out

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:06.800
