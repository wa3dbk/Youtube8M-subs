00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
these tutorial thingies but let's just

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.679 
these tutorial thingies but let's just
get<00:01:22.830> right<00:01:23.189> into<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.700> actual<00:01:24.119> gameplay

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
get right into the actual gameplay

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.210 
get right into the actual gameplay
mechanics<00:01:25.470> just<00:01:25.710> because<00:01:25.860> you<00:01:25.979> know<00:01:26.070> it's

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
mechanics just because you know it's

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.280 
mechanics just because you know it's
relatively<00:01:26.549> easy<00:01:26.689> so<00:01:27.689> since<00:01:27.960> we<00:01:28.049> have<00:01:28.140> a<00:01:28.170> new

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
relatively easy so since we have a new

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.560 
relatively easy so since we have a new
hero<00:01:28.619> I<00:01:28.710> think<00:01:29.009> I<00:01:29.100> might<00:01:29.220> replace<00:01:29.579> this<00:01:29.909> person

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
hero I think I might replace this person

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.060 
hero I think I might replace this person
with<00:01:30.930> what<00:01:31.470> is<00:01:31.590> Leia

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
with what is Leia

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.300 
with what is Leia
she<00:01:32.460> is<00:01:32.610> a<00:01:32.640> he's<00:01:33.509> a<00:01:33.540> mid<00:01:34.020> Ranger<00:01:34.500> okay<00:01:34.979> so<00:01:35.040> I

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
she is a he's a mid Ranger okay so I

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.160 
she is a he's a mid Ranger okay so I
guess<00:01:35.520> that<00:01:35.700> should<00:01:36.030> be<00:01:36.180> okay<00:01:36.630> don't<00:01:36.960> really

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
guess that should be okay don't really

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.600 
guess that should be okay don't really
know<00:01:37.229> if<00:01:37.290> that's<00:01:37.439> a<00:01:37.530> good<00:01:37.650> idea<00:01:37.950> but<00:01:38.189> she's

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
know if that's a good idea but she's

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.580 
know if that's a good idea but she's
three<00:01:38.880> stars<00:01:39.210> so<00:01:39.450> that's<00:01:40.020> definitely<00:01:40.290> good

three stars so that's definitely good

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:41.960

is<00:02:18.740> pretty<00:02:19.070> cool<00:02:19.600> I<00:02:20.600> mean<00:02:21.080> it's<00:02:21.410> it's<00:02:22.190> a<00:02:22.340> pretty

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
is pretty cool I mean it's it's a pretty

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.600 
is pretty cool I mean it's it's a pretty
simple<00:02:23.090> concept<00:02:23.570> but<00:02:24.160> don't<00:02:25.160> worry<00:02:25.310> this<00:02:25.430> game

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
simple concept but don't worry this game

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.010 
simple concept but don't worry this game
has<00:02:25.760> a<00:02:25.790> lot<00:02:26.030> of<00:02:26.090> other<00:02:26.360> functions<00:02:26.870> and

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020 
has a lot of other functions and

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.110 
has a lot of other functions and
features<00:02:27.170> as<00:02:27.740> well<00:02:28.190> as<00:02:28.310> I'm<00:02:28.430> concerned<00:02:28.910> that

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
features as well as I'm concerned that

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.140 
features as well as I'm concerned that
is<00:02:29.450> really<00:02:29.900> fun<00:02:30.230> so<00:02:31.070> there's<00:02:31.700> also<00:02:31.820> some<00:02:32.000> cool

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
is really fun so there's also some cool

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.230 
is really fun so there's also some cool
dialogue<00:02:32.600> that<00:02:32.870> the<00:02:32.990> story<00:02:33.230> has<00:02:33.410> as<00:02:33.590> well<00:02:33.770> but

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:34.240 
dialogue that the story has as well but

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.120 
dialogue that the story has as well but
typically<00:02:35.240> it's<00:02:35.480> nothing<00:02:35.990> to<00:02:36.200> -<00:02:36.470> I<00:02:36.800> guess

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
typically it's nothing to - I guess

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:38.490 
typically it's nothing to - I guess
super<00:02:37.790> crazy

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
super crazy

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.980 
super crazy
so<00:02:39.500> really<00:02:39.800> it's<00:02:40.280> it<00:02:40.730> just<00:02:40.810> consists<00:02:41.810> of

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:41.990 
so really it's it just consists of

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:44.950 
so really it's it just consists of
spamming<00:02:42.650> both<00:02:43.340> the<00:02:43.730> abilities<00:02:44.420> button<00:02:44.750> as

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:44.960 
spamming both the abilities button as

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.930 
spamming both the abilities button as
well<00:02:45.260> as<00:02:45.470> just<00:02:45.710> watching<00:02:46.190> your<00:02:46.310> heroes<00:02:46.640> making

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
well as just watching your heroes making

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.270 
well as just watching your heroes making
sure<00:02:47.060> that<00:02:47.180> they<00:02:47.300> don't<00:02:47.480> die<00:02:47.780> just<00:02:48.650> so<00:02:48.860> just<00:02:49.190> to

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
sure that they don't die just so just to

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.060 
sure that they don't die just so just to
keep<00:02:49.400> things<00:02:49.640> awesome<00:02:50.420> so<00:02:51.110> let's<00:02:51.530> just<00:02:51.890> get

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.470 
take like centuries for me to actually
explain<00:03:27.950> the<00:03:28.040> mechanics<00:03:28.190> and<00:03:29.060> I<00:03:29.180> know<00:03:29.270> you

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
explain the mechanics and I know you

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:30.880 
explain the mechanics and I know you
guys<00:03:29.630> like<00:03:29.900> it<00:03:30.050> you<00:03:30.140> know<00:03:30.170> you<00:03:30.620> don't<00:03:30.709> like
