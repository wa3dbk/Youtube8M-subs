00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:27.800

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:32.060

 this is not possible in rare 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:42.859
 exceptions is not possible 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.469

00:00:42.859 --> 00:00:47.719
 The next one, you know? 

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:52.070

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:52.969
 and tests the power station and 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.859
 eletric central 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:58.039

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.650
 Right now 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.780
 along with that we get the 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:17.870
 improvisation is a tool and in this 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:20.020

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:20.020

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:29.150
 Then we pull the other pulls. 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:33.320
 appliance 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:36.620

 things can happen 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:09.239
 is a reversal of polarity that could 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:12.000
 have caused a huge loss to the team 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.920
 We have played a module can arrive 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:19.010

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:21.150
 the very burning of a fuse including 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.220

 position to be able to remove the radio if 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.680
