00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
little plastic container I can

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.640 
little plastic container I can
understand<00:01:39.030> why<00:01:39.150> it's<00:01:39.329> not<00:01:39.420> toasted<00:01:39.930> but<00:01:40.500> it

understand why it's not toasted but it

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:41.899 
understand why it's not toasted but it
should<00:01:40.799> have<00:01:40.890> been<00:01:41.009> toasted<00:01:41.460> because<00:01:41.700> it's<00:01:41.820> a

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
should have been toasted because it's a

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.249 
should have been toasted because it's a
s'mores<00:01:42.240> otherwise<00:01:42.720> it's<00:01:42.960> just<00:01:43.020> chocolate

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
s'mores otherwise it's just chocolate

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.170 
s'mores otherwise it's just chocolate
and<00:01:43.590> marshmallows<00:01:44.070> so<00:01:44.340> let's<00:01:44.670> try<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:44.909> churro

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
and marshmallows so let's try the churro

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.340 
and marshmallows so let's try the churro
by<00:01:45.420> itself<00:01:45.720> and<00:01:46.140> see<00:01:46.320> how<00:01:46.500> it<00:01:46.680> tastes<00:01:48.350> the

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
by itself and see how it tastes the

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.230 
by itself and see how it tastes the
churro<00:01:49.590> has<00:01:50.130> a<00:01:50.159> little<00:01:50.670> crust<00:01:50.970> on<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.210> outside

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
churro has a little crust on the outside

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.630 
churro has a little crust on the outside
it's<00:01:51.810> not<00:01:51.899> really<00:01:52.470> crispy<00:01:52.890> so<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.430> first

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
it's not really crispy so the first

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.670 
it's not really crispy so the first
thing<00:01:53.759> I<00:01:53.850> tasted<00:01:54.149> right<00:01:54.299> away<00:01:54.540> was<00:01:54.869> some<00:01:55.320> sugar

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
thing I tasted right away was some sugar

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.190 
thing I tasted right away was some sugar
but<00:01:56.100> sadly<00:01:56.399> there<00:01:56.759> was<00:01:56.820> no<00:01:57.060> cinnamon<00:01:57.540> I<00:01:57.869> wish

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
but sadly there was no cinnamon I wish

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.660 
but sadly there was no cinnamon I wish
there<00:01:58.380> was<00:01:58.439> some<00:01:58.619> cinnamon<00:01:59.009> so<00:01:59.460> they<00:01:59.579> are

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
there was some cinnamon so they are

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.459 
there was some cinnamon so they are
still<00:01:59.850> a<00:01:59.909> little<00:01:59.969> hot<00:02:00.360> they're<00:02:00.659> not<00:02:00.810> as<00:02:00.960> crispy

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
still a little hot they're not as crispy

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.020 
still a little hot they're not as crispy
as<00:02:01.500> I<00:02:01.740> imagined<00:02:02.189> whenever<00:02:02.369> I<00:02:02.399> get<00:02:02.520> a<00:02:02.579> churro<00:02:02.880> I

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
as I imagined whenever I get a churro I

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.539 
as I imagined whenever I get a churro I
imagine<00:02:03.570> it<00:02:03.659> that<00:02:03.689> it's<00:02:04.110> really<00:02:04.530> crispy<00:02:04.950> a<00:02:05.100> lot

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
imagine it that it's really crispy a lot

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.969 
imagine it that it's really crispy a lot
of<00:02:05.670> cinnamon<00:02:06.060> sugar<00:02:06.090> and<00:02:06.509> this<00:02:07.140> is<00:02:07.409> really

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
of cinnamon sugar and this is really

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.589 
of cinnamon sugar and this is really
lacking<00:02:08.129> what<00:02:08.610> I<00:02:08.640> imagined<00:02:09.149> to<00:02:09.209> be<00:02:09.239> a<00:02:09.360> churro

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
lacking what I imagined to be a churro

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.660 
lacking what I imagined to be a churro
and<00:02:09.959> this<00:02:10.410> sauce<00:02:10.649> looks<00:02:10.679> really<00:02:11.430> really<00:02:11.760> runny

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:12.670 
and this sauce looks really really runny

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.790 
and this sauce looks really really runny
I<00:02:12.730> don't<00:02:12.940> know<00:02:13.060> if<00:02:13.120> you<00:02:13.240> could<00:02:13.420> see<00:02:13.630> oh<00:02:13.840> just

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
I don't know if you could see oh just

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.380 
I don't know if you could see oh just
got<00:02:14.920> some<00:02:15.160> on<00:02:15.310> the<00:02:15.430> floor<00:02:15.580> so<00:02:15.910> the<00:02:16.030> sauce<00:02:16.240> is

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
got some on the floor so the sauce is

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:17.070 
got some on the floor so the sauce is
really<00:02:16.569> runny

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
really runny

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.199 
really runny
I<00:02:17.110> think<00:02:17.680> it's<00:02:17.890> Hershey's<00:02:18.520> chocolate<00:02:18.550> sauce

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
I think it's Hershey's chocolate sauce

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:21.300 
I think it's Hershey's chocolate sauce
probably<00:02:19.750> so<00:02:20.260> I'm<00:02:20.440> assuming<00:02:20.860> this<00:02:20.950> probably

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
probably so I'm assuming this probably

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:22.559 
probably so I'm assuming this probably
ain't<00:02:21.430> gonna<00:02:21.520> taste<00:02:21.760> all<00:02:21.910> that<00:02:22.090> great<00:02:22.330> all

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:22.569 
ain't gonna taste all that great all

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:23.820 
ain't gonna taste all that great all
right<00:02:22.720> so<00:02:22.870> let's<00:02:23.140> try<00:02:23.349> it<00:02:23.410> in<00:02:23.530> the<00:02:23.620> sauce

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
right so let's try it in the sauce

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:25.530 
right so let's try it in the sauce
together<00:02:24.190> and<00:02:24.459> hopefully<00:02:24.700> it<00:02:25.060> tastes<00:02:25.390> like<00:02:25.420> a

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
together and hopefully it tastes like a

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.690 
together and hopefully it tastes like a
s'more<00:02:25.959> and<00:02:26.349> we<00:02:26.440> both<00:02:26.590> know<00:02:26.830> it<00:02:26.980> won't<00:02:27.160> listen

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
s'more and we both know it won't listen

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.210 
s'more and we both know it won't listen
so<00:02:28.090> this<00:02:28.450> is<00:02:28.599> kind<00:02:28.840> of<00:02:28.930> hard<00:02:29.230> to<00:02:29.530> dip<00:02:29.920> it<00:02:30.069> and

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
so this is kind of hard to dip it and

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:31.860 
so this is kind of hard to dip it and
then<00:02:30.370> try<00:02:30.580> to<00:02:30.640> get<00:02:30.790> a<00:02:30.850> marshmallow<00:02:31.390> on<00:02:31.690> it<00:02:31.780> at

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
then try to get a marshmallow on it at

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:37.350 
then try to get a marshmallow on it at
the<00:02:31.989> same<00:02:32.140> time<00:02:32.310> Oh<00:02:36.120> God

not gonna taste good
whoever<00:02:53.350> taste<00:02:53.709> tested<00:02:54.100> this<00:02:54.190> in<00:02:54.340> the<00:02:54.430> kitchen

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:54.610 
whoever taste tested this in the kitchen

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.370
