don't<00:06:10.600> find<00:06:10.810> that<00:06:10.900> accurate<00:06:11.670> because

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:12.670 
don't find that accurate because

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:14.880 
don't find that accurate because
Ravenclaw's<00:06:13.450> are<00:06:13.750> often<00:06:14.200> treated<00:06:14.320> similarly

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:19.270 
and yet our grades are excellent I think
