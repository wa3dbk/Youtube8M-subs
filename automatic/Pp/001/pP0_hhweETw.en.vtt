00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.089
 not 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.910
 I'm coming out of which you are responsible 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.799
 of product at crown you are 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:14.690
 also crown importer of the brand 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:16.350
 hello in france and introduce yourself to 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:17.640
 grass salon 1 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.190
 without denner a little bit particular 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.470
 those aero in henner v-twin is this 

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:24.210
 that you can present it to us so 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.220
 it's about the aero have nerves is 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.750
 a 6 year old here six meters width of 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.369
 work in front hitch that we 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.110
 can also have rear hitch 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.500
 always on this same width of 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:32.790
 job 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.080
 Can you describe to us the 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.340
 mode of operation the principle of 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.500
 operation of landéda roe v twin 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.809
 then seven to erode north to a 600 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.790
 residents the unique kinematics of 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.559
 system there with the teeth that are 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.449
 projected that will allow to lift 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.309
 drilling up inside until 

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:49.110
 center of the machine what are the 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.909
 seven-year strengths of the leaders of this 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.100
 to erode north from the point of view of respect 

00:00:50.909 --> 00:00:54.360
 of the quality of the forage or that makes the 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.070
 forage quality it's just 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.510
 in the transport of the material until 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.970
 center of the machine since the forage 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.440
 and rl literally raised up until 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:03.659
 center of the machine there is no 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.979
 contact with the floor of the teeth since 

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:07.320
 the teeth are hydraulically driven 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.570
 she movement and the kinematics of 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.490
 the whole thing makes you raise the fodder 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.070
 and there are more these phenomena of 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.690
 raking and freud friction of the 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.610
 drilling on the ground so is that with 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.530
 the v-twin we have a respect for quality 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.420
 more important than with 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.659
 spinning top or at sun completely 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.430
 in the sense that there is no risk 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.350
 to bring earth or pebbles 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.369
 to the center of the machine until 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.689
 in land art that you can despite 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.439
 the whole site is a disadvantage of this 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.030
 type of material 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.320
 the disadvantage that we can see in 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.520
 front hitch that could be the 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.740
 overhang that we can have a 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.180
 lack of visibility to transport is 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.909
 what you have done tests 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.719
 demonstrating the qualitative impact of this 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.340
 type of material 

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:45.869
 studies were removed from the holidays by 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.909
 Finnish universities that have 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:51.240
 shown that the impact on spores 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:53.009
 butyric was to have four times 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.600
 less butyric spores in the 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.789
 forage what are the combinations 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.560
 possible front back and width of 

00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:00.570
 work allowed by the aero 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.729
 resigns with a 600 hitch 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.619
 before we have the opportunity to have the 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.240
 same system in rear hitch on 6 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.859
 meters wide one also has a 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.110
 another model of 7 meters fifty of 

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:11.700
 width in version drag crown 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.270
 also present at the salon de l'herbe 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.960
 a news 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:20.020
 including my f150 5 it's a press to 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:21.640
 fixed chamber and variable adja m of what 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.080
 is it mister claude years it's a 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.300
 unique concept actually this 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.790
 understood 1955 in the sense that we are on 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:30.310
 the concept of a fixed chamber with the 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:31.930
 forming a bullet in a volume at 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.460
 inside the press and we will tighten 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.350
 drilling from outside to 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:38.260
 the inside of the ball so 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:39.880
 to be able to create a kingdom where el niño has 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.440
 wandered in a star in the center of the ball 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.260
 how to optimize the conversion 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.640
 forage conservation and concept 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.160
 is unique in the sense that from 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:50.020
 a fixed pressing chamber we go 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.880
 have the opportunity to do different 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:54.850
 diameters from 1 m 25 up to one meter 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:57.190
 fifty and that in increments of 5 cm with 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:58.390
 a machine of this type there we will have the 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:00.670
 possibility of making balls of a 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.260
 meter 25 up to one meter fifty is 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.340
 of power in the straw for example 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.080
 able to make one-meter balls 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.520
 fifty and optimize the transport or 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.080
 to make balls of one meter 25 or to 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.060
 put 30 in the street bà nà plays in the 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.620
 background the press that can integrate all 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.400
 the possible products is a machine 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.380
 very versatile 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.660
 actually in the sense that we are ensuring 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:18.250
 this included my carpet or a fund of 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:20.620
 pressing which is also unique to 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.900
 straps and barrett is what this 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.750
 press integrates a hash system 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:28.180
 here we have two models in those of 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:30.400
 live range 155 model models with a 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.560
 rotating leader or models with return of 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.959
 cut 17 or 26 knife where we will be able 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:38.500
 select the number of knife is 0 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:41.290
 8 9 or 10 7 knife per seven places 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.550
 understood 1155 I believe can be combined 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.800
 wrapping a home 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:46.060
 indeed we have developed since 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:49.120
 launch of the range included but 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:50.500
 also the compressed acf 155 xcode so 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.959
 there we are on the basis of this understood 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.430
 1955 with cutting rotor so simple 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:56.410
 systematically since it is a 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:58.120
 machine that is dedicated to doing in their 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:00.640
 luggage since it is coupled with a 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.080
 two ribbons on the integrated system 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:05.320
 same chassis so at the same time that one 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:07.060
 will squeeze the previous ball is going to be 

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.690
 wrapped on the same machine and everything is 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.000
 does it automatically 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:11.530
 the driver only has to drive to 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.180
 follow the Andean so this press 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:14.140
 also with this understood my it is 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:17.620
 possible 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:19.630
 to replace the binding nets by a bed 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.930
 polyethylene film agents before cold 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:21.220
 commonplace 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:23.530
 what is the interest of this technique has 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.910
 actually the interest of the film h bed 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:27.430
 that we developed and launched everything 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:29.200
 recently on the range understood my finds 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:30.430
 his interest in the oruzgan only has 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:32.470
 in their luggage as he goes 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:35.500
 really optimize the conservation of the 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:37.630
 fodder in the sense that the film does not have 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.650
 this spring effect when it comes out of 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:40.330
 the pressing chamber 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:41.560
 so there will be less air to 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:43.270
 inside the room we go 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:45.100
 imprisoned - air during their antics 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:47.669
 swim I come close which I thank you 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:47.669
 thank you
