00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:09.269
 tanks with a conical bottom 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:11.759
 for the production of beer class for for 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.160
 conti precipitate tion in the production of 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:20.100
 the blame 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:26.250
 I am writing letters 230 liters with two shirts 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:28.970
 cooling 1 on the back of the u-shaped 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:33.530
 covering types 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:37.790
 almost half capacity rei shirt 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.790
 installed directly on the cone 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:46.020
 noggin is designed for 2 and a half 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:52.640
 atmospheres and has an input output 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:52.640
 a corresponding outlet for complete drainage 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:01:01.500
 just as well on the bottom shirt that 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:05.729
 installed on a cone capacity calculated 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:10.170
 on pressure 0 5 atmospheres and above 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:13.440
 pressure valve is also installed in 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.659
 The kit includes a breather valve for 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:19.729
 fermentation at atmospheric pressure targets 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.729
 goes about wine but also for such send 

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:31.050
 capacity to 380 liters 

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:38.960
 all the same on the cone installed 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:43.789
 shirt shirt 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.789
 the rear of the tank is also U-shaped 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:01.380
 next to the capacity of 460 liters, too, with two 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.360
 shirts that counted pressure 0 5 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.350
 atmospheres and the thickness of the metal and a half 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:10.860
 millimeter of all his bones 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:15.450
 presented here exactly like 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:18.140
 thickness of the jacket has all the capacity 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.140
 the same package 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:27.220
 Well, respectively, a different volume 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:34.050
 Capacities also available 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:34.050
 lower volume by 120 liters by 60 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:40.960
 made on the same principle with two 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:43.470
 shirts also calculated under 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:43.470
 pressure 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:54.720
 light airtight among compacted 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:08.380
 confining pressure inside 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:11.260
 capacity surface polished on 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:15.849
 the video is not very good seen as all 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:18.480
 very reflected all seams are processed and 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:18.480
 cleaned up 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:37.910
 According to the pressure can be removed 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.710
 guest not to restore the hunter 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:44.320
 breathing valve for atmospheric 

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:44.320
 pressure which comes with
