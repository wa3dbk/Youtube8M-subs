00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 this video to the source offering 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.429
 choose master x 2 fonts with five 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.019
 years warranty in brazil 

00:00:07.429 --> 00:00:14.340
 My personal talk is beauty and I'm going today. 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:16.470
 test the r9 290 xa then already 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:20.100
 now we will take the bench and here we are with 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:23.310
 our r 9 290 x model gigabyte 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:27.359
 force 113 your ultra beré review with 8 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:29.880
 gb memory and core i7 and 4790 k is ok 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.949
 let's see here already face in grand theft 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.440
 here are the settings that 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.510
 we are using graphical options 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:40.710
 in full hd 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:54.059
 Eight off 4 times 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:55.949
 look is just off High smooth all 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.960
 OK 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.600
 remember that the game had already pulled 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.739
 this setting as the default setting 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.439
 thing that changed is that he pulled the 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:07.020
 need a pattern and I took and put 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.970
 me sometimes four ok 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.939
 Advanced graphics is everything 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.460
 Off, I'm going to leave five games. 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:17.460
 show this configuration and 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.290
 left very high and that's what I want 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.960
 show you 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.119
 comparing board with no other board 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.490
 something like that because each plate that 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:30.060
 we tested on grand theft auto 5 or 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.950
 gt so it was with a well setup 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.710
 different from the other 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.900
 It's worth remembering that we're going to do gala or 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.390
 Do not take it with you, how are you? 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.420
 then we will have a fixed configuration and 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.979
 and we're going to make a video of 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.930
 methodology because we have already told you 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:53.630
 will be the test methodology will be 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:57.119
 there in place 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:59.310
 I never saw that never though Grandpa 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:03.719
 do not pay business 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:06.540
 the methodology then you will see her 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:10.709
 in the next few days ok let's see if I 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:12.120
 I got the 1 before it got to be in the 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.710
 internet jumping from some places but 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:22.680
 it was not here in the moral 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:26.370
 the river is certain the fox had the small 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:31.260
 car inside is just to win was monte galão 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:32.880
 gasoline, then this is good 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.670
 Of course we 're always putting 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.140
 the boards here showing the playable level 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.600
 that they stay in full HD resolution 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.410
 in a little while stirring a little 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.000
 configuration 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:45.540
 according to what the ice sheet in the 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.270
 Provides but do not be aware that 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.640
 we will have the bottleneck at the gala and explaining 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:53.940
 tintim for how we will do 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:57.030
 the comparisons are up to you if you 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:03:00.450
 want to leave us comments we 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.830
 we can make a specific video ned 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.780
 grand theft auto testing so 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:06.210
 comparing performance with different 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.730
 video cards so if you want 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:10.650
 with a test like this leaves without andré 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.900
 we want to test with five and all 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.090
 I want to test and 13 for 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.770
 video card makes 7 all the 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.520
 video cards we can sit here 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:21.990
 we make mendes marques fixed for you 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:24.510
 within the methodology we have already mentioned 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:26.580
 and show you any the best 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.860
 and how do you get each of the 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:31.500
 Plates on gta5 I think would be fine 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:33.120
 interesting interesting to show this 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:36.780
 for you to leave home obviously 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:38.130
 focusing on full HD resolution, let's 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.780
 take a walk they are seeing 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:43.710
 that the number of fronts is 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:04:22.590
 extremely high it is hard to lift the 

00:03:43.710 --> 00:04:24.720
 better face amd board we have some 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:27.040
 considerations to make because the game was 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:29.800
 released in partnership with nvidia 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:31.990
 only the nvidia cards have there 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.640
 when it launched the new driver relationship game 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:36.790
 in the house the same day that I do not play 

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:38.920
 I'm nvidia's drivers to improve the 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:40.270
 performance we know that theoretically 

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:42.790
 it would not be fair with this to stay 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:45.040
 amd we've waited a long time 

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:46.930
 the signs and me thinking that maybe he 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:49.150
 to launch a driver in fact not 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:52.390
 launch last we are here 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:54.570
 version omega 11 point something omega 

00:04:52.390 --> 00:05:01.620
 that driver there I do not know which version 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:05:01.620
 correct today 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:06.850
 today on April 28 the driver of the 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:08.950
 April 28th downloaded directly to 

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:10.690
 windows 8 point system itself 

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:12.730
 operating where we are doing with 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:57.180
 our tests directly on the 

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:57.180
 nvidia we lowered the then it is already a car 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:02.770
 It also helps to remember that if you 

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:07.480
 Do you want to build a computer game? 

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:08.920
 can access the link that we do the 

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:10.900
 work of assembling your computer 

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:21.280
 We ship to any 

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:25.050
 Brazil and make it clear that only the 

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:25.050
 hd face scramble 

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:45.610
 It's worth remembering that I'm going to make a non- 

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:47.170
 I know if it's already on the air if it's gone now 

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:48.910
 in the sub 20 selection was not aired in the 

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:51.160
 coming days is leaving where he would make a 

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:53.530
 video captured with the screen and everything 

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:56.170
 full hd all right showing what 

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:58.660
 each of the effects of grand theft auto 

00:06:56.170 --> 00:07:00.700
 and what is the difference between them in your 

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:03.340
 gameplay with effect what I found 

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:05.470
 need to turn it off when you turn it on 

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:09.400
 it you end up losing a lot of 

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:11.950
 friends and does not have a real one real gain 

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:14.020
 in the game in relation to quality and this 

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:16.180
 Be very clear then let's make a 

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:17.650
 tutorial completion for you to leave 

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:21.430
 home for everyone to know exactly 

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:24.370
 how to configure your gta5 and extract the 

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:25.690
 best of your video card thanks 

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:27.280
 You watched this video is a 

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:31.290
 Big hug, a kiss on your heart.
