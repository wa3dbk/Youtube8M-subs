00:01:58.599 --> 00:02:00.120 
with aiming of your external antennas
we've<00:01:58.869> created<00:01:59.140> an<00:01:59.410> app<00:01:59.649> on<00:02:00.009> the<00:02:00.099> Google

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
we've created an app on the Google

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.370 
we've created an app on the Google
Android<00:02:00.700> Market<00:02:01.179> here<00:02:01.660> you<00:02:01.810> see<00:02:01.989> we<00:02:02.140> have<00:02:02.170> it

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
Android Market here you see we have it

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.320 
Android Market here you see we have it
already<00:02:02.530> open<00:02:03.459> here<00:02:03.640> and<00:02:03.759> it's<00:02:04.179> actually

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
already open here and it's actually

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:05.880 
already open here and it's actually
reading<00:02:04.780> where<00:02:04.929> the<00:02:05.050> strongest<00:02:05.470> signal<00:02:05.619> is

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
reading where the strongest signal is

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:07.499 
reading where the strongest signal is
coming<00:02:06.069> from<00:02:06.250> so<00:02:06.789> this<00:02:06.910> is<00:02:07.030> a<00:02:07.060> great<00:02:07.300> tool<00:02:07.479> to

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:07.509 
coming from so this is a great tool to

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:09.359 
coming from so this is a great tool to
help<00:02:07.780> out<00:02:07.929> when<00:02:08.080> you're<00:02:08.200> outside<00:02:08.380> or<00:02:08.979> up<00:02:09.160> in

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
help out when you're outside or up in

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:10.979 
help out when you're outside or up in
your<00:02:09.489> attic<00:02:09.789> trying<00:02:10.000> to<00:02:10.060> decide<00:02:10.420> which<00:02:10.780> way<00:02:10.959> to

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:10.989 
your attic trying to decide which way to

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:13.470

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
aim your external high gain directional

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.690 
aim your external high gain directional
antenna<00:02:13.599> as<00:02:14.020> you<00:02:14.380> can<00:02:14.530> see<00:02:14.680> here<00:02:14.950> we<00:02:15.400> have<00:02:15.550> the

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
antenna as you can see here we have the

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:16.949 
antenna as you can see here we have the
direction<00:02:15.970> of<00:02:16.090> where<00:02:16.209> it's<00:02:16.360> coming<00:02:16.569> from<00:02:16.660> we

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 
direction of where it's coming from we

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:18.449 
direction of where it's coming from we
would<00:02:17.080> simply<00:02:17.260> need<00:02:17.560> a<00:02:17.590> mount<00:02:17.890> and<00:02:18.069> aim<00:02:18.250> our

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 
would simply need a mount and aim our

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:20.010 
would simply need a mount and aim our
antenna<00:02:18.760> in<00:02:18.880> that<00:02:19.000> direction<00:02:19.180> to<00:02:19.780> get<00:02:19.930> the

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.020 
antenna in that direction to get the

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.110 
antenna in that direction to get the
maximum<00:02:20.560> benefit<00:02:20.890> of<00:02:21.099> the<00:02:21.190> Z<00:02:21.370> boost<00:02:21.580> booster

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
maximum benefit of the Z boost booster

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.729 
maximum benefit of the Z boost booster
indoors<00:02:22.660> where<00:02:22.930> we<00:02:23.020> have<00:02:23.170> our<00:02:23.319> internal

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
distribution is

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.490

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
internal distribution antenna if you

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.300 
internal distribution antenna if you
have<00:02:34.990> the<00:02:35.110> two<00:02:35.260> configured<00:02:35.710> you<00:02:35.830> are<00:02:35.980> able<00:02:36.160> to

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
have the two configured you are able to

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.280 
have the two configured you are able to
use<00:02:36.430> a<00:02:36.460> signal<00:02:37.240> combiner<00:02:37.570> so<00:02:37.810> you<00:02:37.870> only<00:02:38.050> have

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
use a signal combiner so you only have

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.290 
use a signal combiner so you only have
to<00:02:38.410> have<00:02:38.530> one<00:02:38.590> cable<00:02:39.190> length<00:02:39.460> run<00:02:39.700> down<00:02:39.940> to<00:02:40.180> the

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
to have one cable length run down to the

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.540 
to have one cable length run down to the
base<00:02:40.480> unit<00:02:40.690> amplifier<00:02:41.200> and<00:02:41.530> the<00:02:42.190> reason<00:02:42.460> why

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
base unit amplifier and the reason why

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:43.800 
base unit amplifier and the reason why
they<00:02:42.700> have<00:02:42.880> the<00:02:43.030> combiner<00:02:43.360> here<00:02:43.600> in<00:02:43.690> two

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
they have the combiner here in two

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:45.330 
they have the combiner here in two
empires<00:02:44.170> is<00:02:44.320> because<00:02:44.530> these<00:02:44.620> are<00:02:44.680> single<00:02:45.160> band

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
empires is because these are single band

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
signal when it's being broadcasted so

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:19.500 
signal when it's being broadcasted so
these<00:03:18.280> are<00:03:18.459> a<00:03:18.489> great<00:03:18.700> alternative<00:03:19.120> to<00:03:19.150> omni

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
these are a great alternative to omni

these are a great alternative to omni
mounts<00:03:19.810> antennas<00:03:20.290> we<00:03:21.130> also<00:03:21.310> have<00:03:21.670> the<00:03:22.150> dome

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:22.330 
mounts antennas we also have the dome

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:23.580 
mounts antennas we also have the dome
ceiling<00:03:22.600> mount<00:03:22.930> so<00:03:23.080> these<00:03:23.170> are<00:03:23.320> a<00:03:23.380> great

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
ceiling mount so these are a great

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:25.229 
ceiling mount so these are a great
option<00:03:23.830> and<00:03:24.040> commercial<00:03:24.489> applications<00:03:25.090> or

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:25.239 
option and commercial applications or

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:27.210 
option and commercial applications or
maybe<00:03:25.390> basements<00:03:25.959> that<00:03:26.230> have<00:03:26.410> drop<00:03:26.739> ceilings

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
maybe basements that have drop ceilings

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:28.650 
maybe basements that have drop ceilings
so<00:03:27.640> you<00:03:27.730> can<00:03:27.850> just<00:03:28.030> run<00:03:28.150> the<00:03:28.270> coax<00:03:28.570> cable

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
so you can just run the coax cable

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.570 
so you can just run the coax cable
simply<00:03:29.049> right<00:03:29.260> there<00:03:29.470> and<00:03:29.650> it's<00:03:30.010> a<00:03:30.100> great<00:03:30.310> for

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:30.580 
simply right there and it's a great for
