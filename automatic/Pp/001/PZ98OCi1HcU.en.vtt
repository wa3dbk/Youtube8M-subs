00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.399
 Everything about the new imac you will learn now 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:18.210
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.910
 new edition of apple like today goes 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.070
 it's about the new imac's next to the 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.470
 ipad mini presented on the keynote 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.779
 was and also some interesting 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.640
 once Apple has clearly the 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:34.200
 hardware upgraded a bit again 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:37.950
 now with a 2 7 ghz processor of 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:40.410
 intel i5 processors installed and from 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.379
 Bouquet of 8 gb RAM and 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.360
 a terabyte hard drive partially 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.610
 graphics card would warmed up a bit 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.050
 basically everything stayed the same 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.860
 at the connection has a lot 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:55.230
 now four usb 3.0 plugs will be changed 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.530
 Building 2 sander clearly offered 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:02.070
 ethernet cable 1 card slot and 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.750
 headphone jack no cd and dvd drive 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.210
 for some probably annoying though 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:10.290
 clearly the train is driving the apple now 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:12.000
 away from the dvd drive otherwise is in the basics 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.159
 everything stayed the same with the hardware 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.960
 The design has a lot to do with it 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.060
 changed even if there is no activist rida 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.610
 its been a lot thinner 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:24.840
 become housing and design of 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:26.700
 new imac it goes on loan back 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.840
 a bit thicker but the edges 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.520
 are really very very thin 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.530
 as wise as the cinema the apple 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.509
 extra turned so synonymous that thin 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:37.799
 but it looks very clear 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:39.630
 a little thicker in the width but it is 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:44.150
 really a very very thin desktop 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.150
 computer for this performance 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:50.030
 Price has not been that much 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:53.700
 it is supposed to change states at the price of 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:56.189
 1350 euro up to the top model of 250 euro 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:59.070
 if they are still detailed 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:01.860
 can adjust as I said up to 32 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.310
 gigabyte of memory was possible 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.170
 already a lot is 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.640
 yes, that's about it 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.380
