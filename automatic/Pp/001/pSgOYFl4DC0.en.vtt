00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
an in-game video that I recorded off my

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.959 
an in-game video that I recorded off my
ps3<00:00:09.809> that<00:00:10.620> someone<00:00:11.070> has<00:00:11.160> put<00:00:11.340> together<00:00:11.460> and

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
ps3 that someone has put together and

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.089 
ps3 that someone has put together and
because<00:00:12.809> I'm<00:00:12.900> actually<00:00:13.139> viewing<00:00:13.679> it<00:00:13.920> through

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
because I'm actually viewing it through

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.400 
because I'm actually viewing it through
black<00:00:14.639> ops<00:00:14.849> 2<00:00:15.089> in<00:00:15.330> the<00:00:15.450> theater<00:00:15.809> mode<00:00:15.929> on

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
black ops 2 in the theater mode on

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.470 
black ops 2 in the theater mode on
someone's<00:00:16.800> account<00:00:17.039> really<00:00:17.970> I<00:00:18.000> don't<00:00:18.300> think

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
someone's account really I don't think

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:55.360 
someone's account really I don't think
you<00:00:18.570> can<00:00:18.720> even<00:00:18.810> fake<00:00:19.140> that<00:00:19.260> kind<00:00:19.320> of<00:00:19.560> stuff<00:00:41.780> so

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
messaged me with this binary code right

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.030 
messaged me with this binary code right
here<00:01:05.549> I<00:01:06.240> didn't<00:01:06.659> understand<00:01:07.020> it<00:01:07.229> so<00:01:07.890> I<00:01:07.920> just

here I didn't understand it so I just
put<00:01:08.580> it<00:01:08.610> into<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.000> binary<00:01:09.330> text<00:01:09.990> decoder<00:01:10.290> and

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
put it into the binary text decoder and

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.660 
put it into the binary text decoder and
it<00:01:10.860> came<00:01:11.010> up<00:01:11.070> with<00:01:11.340> relays<00:01:12.210> 1<00:01:12.510> 1<00:01:12.689> 6<00:01:12.960> 16<00:01:13.670> 1914

right now is what I was seen in his fire
ship<00:01:47.680> so<00:01:48.160> I<00:01:48.640> couldn't<00:01:49.120> believe<00:01:49.300> it<00:01:49.540> I<00:01:49.660> said

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:49.870 
ship so I couldn't believe it I said

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:51.300 
ship so I couldn't believe it I said
okay<00:01:50.230> so<00:01:50.260> it<00:01:50.530> looks<00:01:50.680> real<00:01:50.860> but<00:01:51.010> I<00:01:51.070> don't

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
okay so it looks real but I don't

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:52.890 
okay so it looks real but I don't
understand<00:01:51.670> the<00:01:52.090> peaches<00:01:52.330> at<00:01:52.570> the<00:01:52.660> start

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:52.900 
understand the peaches at the start

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:53.940 
understand the peaches at the start
makes<00:01:53.110> it<00:01:53.200> look<00:01:53.380> like<00:01:53.500> there<00:01:53.650> are<00:01:53.710> steps

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
makes it look like there are steps

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:55.500 
makes it look like there are steps
before<00:01:54.130> the<00:01:54.400> Hades<00:01:54.640> part<00:01:54.880> why<00:01:55.060> not<00:01:55.240> just<00:01:55.390> show

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:55.510 
before the Hades part why not just show

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:56.580 
before the Hades part why not just show
these<00:01:55.690> parts<00:01:55.960> and<00:01:56.080> include<00:01:56.320> them<00:01:56.440> in<00:01:56.530> these

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
I was just wrong to admit it because I

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.170 
I was just wrong to admit it because I
don't<00:02:50.320> think<00:02:50.530> you<00:02:50.920> can<00:02:51.100> make<00:02:51.130> hack<00:02:51.640> that<00:02:51.910> kind

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
don't think you can make hack that kind

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.390 
don't think you can make hack that kind
of<00:02:52.239> stuff<00:02:52.480> the<00:02:52.840> portal<00:02:53.290> that's<00:02:53.709> the<00:02:53.950> portal<00:02:54.280> is

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400

the<00:02:54.520> thing<00:02:54.730> that<00:02:54.760> is<00:02:55.000> guessing<00:02:55.360> me<00:02:55.720> now<00:02:56.350> I

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
the thing that is guessing me now I

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.140 
the thing that is guessing me now I
thought<00:02:56.950> it's<00:02:57.400> gotta<00:02:57.640> be<00:02:57.790> something<00:02:57.970> to<00:02:58.090> do

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.009 
bowie knife is not on the wall and I
don't<00:03:42.640> know<00:03:42.700> why<00:03:42.880> if<00:03:43.330> that's<00:03:43.570> a<00:03:43.660> glitch<00:03:43.930> or

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:44.019 
don't know why if that's a glitch or

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:45.300 
don't know why if that's a glitch or
something<00:03:44.380> like<00:03:44.500> that<00:03:44.560> because<00:03:44.860> if<00:03:45.040> you<00:03:45.130> look

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
something like that because if you look

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.280 
something like that because if you look
at<00:03:45.430> the<00:03:45.519> pictures<00:03:46.000> there's<00:03:46.810> like<00:03:46.989> black

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
at the pictures there's like black

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.259 
at the pictures there's like black
squares<00:03:47.709> and<00:03:48.100> that's<00:03:48.550> because<00:03:48.820> the<00:03:49.000> level

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:49.269 
squares and that's because the level

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:51.870 
squares and that's because the level
hasn't<00:03:49.600> loaded<00:03:49.810> properly<00:03:50.290> and<00:03:50.740> they<00:03:51.520> kind<00:03:51.850> of

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:51.880 
hasn't loaded properly and they kind of

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:53.580 
hasn't loaded properly and they kind of
appear<00:03:52.180> after<00:03:52.270> it<00:03:52.480> but<00:03:52.600> the<00:03:52.750> one<00:03:52.900> in<00:03:53.200> the<00:03:53.350> power

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
appear after it but the one in the power

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:54.520 
appear after it but the one in the power
plant<00:03:53.890> that<00:03:53.980> doesn't

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
plant that doesn't

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.110 
plant that doesn't
load<00:03:54.650> it<00:03:54.830> all<00:03:54.950> for<00:03:55.100> some<00:03:55.280> reason<00:03:55.310> I<00:03:55.790> don't<00:03:56.000> know

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
load it all for some reason I don't know

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.460 
load it all for some reason I don't know
why<00:03:56.300> if<00:03:56.690> that's<00:03:56.900> because<00:03:57.050> he<00:03:57.200> took<00:03:57.319> the

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
why if that's because he took the

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:59.170 
why if that's because he took the
picture<00:03:57.709> as<00:03:57.860> it<00:03:58.040> was<00:03:58.130> loading<00:03:58.550> or<00:03:58.910> it's<00:03:59.150> just

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
picture as it was loading or it's just

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.510 
picture as it was loading or it's just
remarried<00:03:59.750> or<00:04:00.020> whatever<00:04:00.620> I<00:04:00.709> don't<00:04:00.830> know<00:04:01.010> so

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:01.520 
remarried or whatever I don't know so

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:03.010 
remarried or whatever I don't know so
