00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:05.500
 very good people good today I bring you a 

00:00:03.489 --> 00:00:09.219
 Minecraft tutorial is worth a mechanism 

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:13.150
 of rest watch and well I'm going to 

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:15.519
 teach that it is a clock system a 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:18.010
 clock system is that the signal of the 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:21.429
 restaurant vale moves in the form of 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:24.820
 clock and it sends impulses every X 

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:27.939
 time when it reaches this point that 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:32.560
 do that because you can make it blink 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:35.830
 a lamp like javier now 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:37.980
 or just move pistons all the 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:37.980
 little while 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:44.950
 or he dispenses for us to launch 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:47.300
 things all the time like arrows for a 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:51.379
 trap or whatever 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:53.680
 Well now I will explain how 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:57.990
 does this clock mechanism 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:01:00.940
 first we put here we're going to stop what 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:05.520
 first we put here 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:09.040
 we travel every three we put a block 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:12.940
 we put the block one of the rest 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:16.479
 we leave two spaces here 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:19.620
 another block another the rest we went through 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:22.710
 here the signal towards this block 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:24.380
 and then we go back that is the 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:29.899
 block 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:33.159
 a reston torch and so and all the 

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:37.290
 Repetitive time until this lamp 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:41.640
 send the signal over here 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:45.030
 and go back to your routine as a clock 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:48.750
 and then from here it's worth we get a 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:53.060
 signal for all these things so that 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.060
 here the clock system as we see now 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:59.760
 well now I'm going to show you another 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:02.190
 clock system other than this one 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:05.310
 what is this same that this will remain 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:07.040
 will pass the clock system that will give 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:12.350
 turns like this 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:14.360
 and will send impulses to this torch as 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:17.670
 this is activated as this is activated 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:20.310
 putting a lamp 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:24.980
 a torch of remains and once 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:27.560
 we prepare the subtraction 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:30.500
 and we have to break this block here 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.799
 and put it quickly as I am going to 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.799
 do now 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:39.769
 it was like that I gave it again 

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:43.269
 new and we see that the signal then it 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:43.269
 repeat very quickly 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:50.200
 and well this would be the signal of the rest 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:53.319
 that we have here then there is another 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.930
 mechanism is worth restÃ³n that you can 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:58.780
 give it when you want with a lever 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.440
 and above will be able to regulate the time 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.430
 make the signal 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.430
 as now 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:12.070
 the signal is given from time to time and 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.070
 when we modify state 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.180
 repeat then 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:22.850
 by fa faster 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:25.730
 wait we're going to 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:29.890
 now we see that it goes a lot faster 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.890
 it depends on you roll more you're repeating 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:35.870
 it was slower or less 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:39.739
 that yes when we regulate we have to 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:43.420
 stop it and give it back once you have 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:43.420
 configured to go well 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:49.790
 how this is done because it becomes a 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:52.740
 3 x 3 platform here 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:57.340
 we leave here in the middle 

00:03:52.740 --> 00:04:01.100
 with nothing and we put you repeat 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:04.610
 here we are doing 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:07.070
 like in the form of a clock the signal like this and 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:08.830
 we put the rest here here also and 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:11.530
 here 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:14.050
 here we do not put it because what it does is 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:17.070
 that when we give the lever is going to 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:17.070
 send the signal here 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:24.370
 up to this piston and when activated 

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:28.110
 it passes the signal through the block this 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:31.540
 send here and it will stick 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:35.140
 and it's making you relax all the time 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:38.160
 good and here this function of this 

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:38.160
 torch subtracts you 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:45.490
 is that it gives you the spark for the start if 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:49.689
 it was not then well we would not have 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:51.909
 nothing and when I want to function as 

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:55.689
 a spark of subtract to begin the 

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:58.979
 pony mechanism would work but if the 

00:04:55.689 --> 00:04:58.979
 it works 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:05.000
 and nobody has to turn it off because 

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:06.849
 if it would not bother and the 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.689
 system 

00:05:06.849 --> 00:05:09.689
 we paid for it 

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:15.300
 would stay on all the time and not 

00:05:12.129 --> 00:05:18.419
 this would not work 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:21.509
 although the gentlemen put another 

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:23.970
 sign for here back and you're here 

00:05:21.509 --> 00:05:26.430
 to do this is a basis also of 

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:28.560
 three by three and put these blocks 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:31.420
 how do we see if to read 

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:34.760
 and here the torch 

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:38.690
 well we would have this system 

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:40.730
 for this little light or we can do it 

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:43.550
 for pistons or dispensed or what 

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:46.730
 we want then we have the same system 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:48.710
 ok we have devised here but more 

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:52.550
 great for what this larger one serves 

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:53.840
 it serves to slow it down 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:56.510
 signal 

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:59.080
 by putting more timers so that 

00:05:56.510 --> 00:06:02.460
 the signal arrives later 

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:05.240
 because this will light more slowly 

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:07.440
 well, let's see it 

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:10.080
 we plugged it 

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:11.820
 it lights up and now until it gives all 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:13.970
 the return to the signal does not return to 

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:13.970
 turn on 

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:22.530
 like here and none of this would be 

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:25.060
 as a speed regulator even 

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:28.610
 we could do it 

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:32.639
 smaller as this 

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:37.400
 or even bigger than late 

00:06:32.639 --> 00:06:41.509
 therefore time to give the impulse 

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:43.940
 these are the systems that there are 

00:06:41.509 --> 00:06:46.389
 then there are more clock systems but 

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:46.389
 good what 

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:52.580
 that with this they are more than efficient 

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:56.960
 to do any circuit that 

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:59.000
 you want to clock system then nothing 

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:01.460
 people I hope you have to do video 

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:06.190
 of this tutorial and nothing subscribe or if 

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:06.190
 we go in another video come from the USA
