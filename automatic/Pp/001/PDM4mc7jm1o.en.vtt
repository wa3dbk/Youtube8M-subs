paper the best way to do that is to

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.950 
paper the best way to do that is to
start<00:00:37.680> at<00:00:37.830> 25<00:00:38.280> yards<00:00:38.640> a<00:00:38.940> lot<00:00:39.390> of<00:00:39.510> times<00:00:39.720> guys

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
start at 25 yards a lot of times guys

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.110 
start at 25 yards a lot of times guys
will<00:00:40.019> shoot<00:00:40.470> paper<00:00:40.710> at<00:00:40.890> 100<00:00:41.280> they'll<00:00:41.879> miss

will shoot paper at 100 they'll miss

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.579 
will shoot paper at 100 they'll miss
they'll<00:00:42.449> start<00:00:42.720> chasing<00:00:42.900> around<00:00:43.140> and<00:00:43.500> before

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:43.589 
they'll start chasing around and before

00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:44.780 
they'll start chasing around and before
you<00:00:43.800> know<00:00:43.920> it<00:00:43.949> they're<00:00:44.159> through<00:00:44.339> a<00:00:44.400> box<00:00:44.610> of

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:44.790 
you know it they're through a box of

ammo bring that back to 25 get your
bullets<00:00:48.180> dead-on<00:00:48.629> at<00:00:48.839> 25<00:00:49.290> right<00:00:49.470> in<00:00:49.559> the

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:49.619 
bullets dead-on at 25 right in the

00:00:49.619 --> 00:00:51.710 
bullets dead-on at 25 right in the
bullseye<00:00:49.769> then<00:00:50.640> move<00:00:50.850> out<00:00:51.030> to<00:00:51.239> a<00:00:51.269> hundred<00:00:51.629> that

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:51.720 
bullseye then move out to a hundred that

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.240 
bullseye then move out to a hundred that
will<00:00:51.869> see<00:00:52.019> the<00:00:52.170> ammunition<00:00:52.440> time<00:00:53.070> and

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
will see the ammunition time and

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.109 
will see the ammunition time and
aggravation<00:00:55.519> so<00:00:56.519> the<00:00:56.640> first<00:00:56.850> step<00:00:57.089> to

00:00:57.109 --> 00:00:57.119 
aggravation so the first step to

00:00:57.119 --> 00:00:58.969 
aggravation so the first step to
sighting<00:00:57.629> in<00:00:57.780> is<00:00:58.170> we'll<00:00:58.350> take<00:00:58.470> our<00:00:58.650> turret

00:00:58.969 --> 00:00:58.979 
sighting in is we'll take our turret

00:00:58.979 --> 00:01:04.670 
sighting in is we'll take our turret
caps<00:00:59.220> off<00:00:59.489> it's<00:01:00.390> easy<00:01:00.570> enough<00:01:03.500> so<00:01:04.500> now<00:01:04.619> that

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
caps off it's easy enough so now that

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.310 
caps off it's easy enough so now that
you're<00:01:04.920> on<00:01:05.010> paper<00:01:05.309> at<00:01:05.880> 100<00:01:06.270> yards<00:01:06.450> say<00:01:07.140> your

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
you're on paper at 100 yards say your

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.740 
you're on paper at 100 yards say your
group<00:01:07.560> is<00:01:07.770> 1<00:01:08.310> inch<00:01:08.520> high<00:01:08.729> and<00:01:09.060> 1<00:01:09.299> inch<00:01:09.479> right

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
group is 1 inch high and 1 inch right

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.780 
group is 1 inch high and 1 inch right
look<00:01:10.560> at<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:10.710> top<00:01:10.950> of<00:01:11.100> your<00:01:11.159> turret<00:01:11.580> and

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
look at the top of your turret and

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.640 
look at the top of your turret and
manufacturers<00:01:12.720> are<00:01:12.750> usually<00:01:13.170> put<00:01:13.350> on<00:01:13.409> there

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
manufacturers are usually put on there

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.080 
manufacturers are usually put on there
the<00:01:13.680> measurements<00:01:14.250> what<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.490> clicks<00:01:14.790> are<00:01:14.970> at

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
the measurements what the clicks are at

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.880 
the measurements what the clicks are at
100<00:01:15.450> yards<00:01:15.630> in<00:01:15.869> this<00:01:16.020> case<00:01:16.260> it's<00:01:16.470> a<00:01:16.560> quarter

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
100 yards in this case it's a quarter

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.180 
100 yards in this case it's a quarter
inch<00:01:17.420> more<00:01:18.420> times<00:01:18.750> than<00:01:19.020> not<00:01:19.230> that's<00:01:19.650> inside

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:20.190 
inch more times than not that's inside

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
the realm of human error so doing one

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.450 
the realm of human error so doing one
click<00:01:22.290> at<00:01:22.410> a<00:01:22.470> time<00:01:22.710> you<00:01:22.890> won't<00:01:23.040> see<00:01:23.190> any

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
click at a time you won't see any

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.790 
click at a time you won't see any
visible<00:01:23.670> difference<00:01:24.300> 3<00:01:24.960> or<00:01:25.080> 4<00:01:25.290> clicks<00:01:25.590> at<00:01:25.710> a

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:25.800 
visible difference 3 or 4 clicks at a

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.350 
visible difference 3 or 4 clicks at a
time<00:01:25.980> is<00:01:26.160> more<00:01:26.340> like<00:01:26.520> it<00:01:26.730> so<00:01:26.880> if<00:01:26.970> we<00:01:27.090> want<00:01:27.270> to

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
time is more like it so if we want to

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.180 
time is more like it so if we want to
bring<00:01:27.480> our<00:01:27.630> group<00:01:27.840> to<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.110> left<00:01:28.140> and<00:01:28.860> down
