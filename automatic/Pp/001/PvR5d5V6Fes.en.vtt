the sales number sales order number

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:11.950 
the sales number sales order number
because<00:01:10.070> that<00:01:10.180> this<00:01:11.180> sales<00:01:11.450> order<00:01:11.689> number<00:01:11.719> is

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
because that this sales order number is

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.110 
going to be on each page so so then we

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.080 
going to be on each page so so then we
can<00:01:15.229> make<00:01:15.409> it<00:01:15.530> look<00:01:15.710> a<00:01:15.799> little<00:01:15.920> better<00:01:16.100> here

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090
