00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
one side of my loaf of bread and then I

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.870 
one side of my loaf of bread and then I
will<00:03:14.760> cover<00:03:15.060> it<00:03:15.300> with<00:03:15.570> the<00:03:15.690> second<00:03:16.050> piece<00:03:16.880> so

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
will cover it with the second piece so

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.670 
will cover it with the second piece so
it's<00:03:18.030> basically<00:03:18.390> like<00:03:18.600> making<00:03:18.959> any<00:03:19.170> sandwich

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
and I'm kind of trying to put most of it

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.790 
and I'm kind of trying to put most of it
in<00:03:24.090> the<00:03:24.209> middle<00:03:24.510> because<00:03:24.690> when<00:03:25.350> you<00:03:25.470> put<00:03:25.650> on

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800 
in the middle because when you put on

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.010 
in the middle because when you put on
the<00:03:26.280> other<00:03:26.520> slice<00:03:27.120> of<00:03:27.150> bread<00:03:27.450> you<00:03:27.660> don't<00:03:27.840> want

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:28.020 
the other slice of bread you don't want

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:36.520 
the other slice of bread you don't want
all<00:03:28.200> the<00:03:28.320> cream<00:03:28.500> cheese<00:03:28.530> to<00:03:28.709> spread<00:03:29.160> out

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
minutes on each side so once it's been

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.620 
minutes on each side so once it's been
three<00:03:47.580> minutes<00:03:47.700> on<00:03:47.970> this<00:03:48.090> side<00:03:48.150> I'm<00:03:48.480> just
