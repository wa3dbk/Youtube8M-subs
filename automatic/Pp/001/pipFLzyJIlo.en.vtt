00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:08.370
 breaking news from ea on her 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.490
 have announced that press conference 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:14.010
 battlefield hotline right away 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.960
 playing is available in the exact 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:16.320
 closed beta you get few places 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.759
 still free 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.939
 You can register in it like that 

00:00:17.759 --> 00:00:22.740
 long there is still four on offer 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.380
 classes can be seen here and the same 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.150
 well - known screen from battlefield 4 so 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.419
 About how you know him you can 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.949
 So for points for money that one 

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:33.239
 You can earn money within the game 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.230
 unlock weapons just because etc 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:41.520
 we all know that everything is flying here 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:43.110
 go into the mode blood money in blood 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.970
 money is important for both groups 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.950
 to get money 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:49.470
 the gangsters have to steal money 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.290
 And the police have to pay the money then 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:53.370
 get back or save next 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.780
 to back up 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.640
 such a small helicopter 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.730
 chase because in the battlefield 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.370
 for a long time battlefield is typical 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.270
 also the helicopters and the vehicles 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.009
 has the consequence that you actually 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.140
 risky actions has as here just 

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:10.230
 there is probably nothing to see 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.060
 will end well but i can also help you 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:13.290
 if the cut should come right now 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.530
 Can I tell you we are always 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.960
 come out again in good health 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:21.170
 battlefield battlefield hotline is 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:26.030
 like yes, like battlefield 4 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.030
 maybe similar to klaus j 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.060
 I should say it looks incredible 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.729
 Similarly, it feels right too 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.170
 So that's that's that after that 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.490
 I have many playing hours now 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.370
 I have to play with the game 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.860
 also say it is not so of course 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:45.060
 bad but it is not 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.790
 really good that it is really 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.530
 feels the same as the 54 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.150
 I also have the occasional over the 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.540
 shoulder looked games themselves very much 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.930
 a lot of 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.400
 Battlefield 4 and then I already have 12 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.760
 try it and make it here 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.869
 melee as it were the opponents arrested 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.450
 you and you did not hear but they are 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.159
 still dead exactly 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.630
 they are virtually turned off 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.310
 Bit weird when 1000 gangsters around 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.560
 ballert and just the one then knife 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.440
 in quotes are then the 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.120
 im only arrested that this 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.640
 The situation basically shows how 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.580
 that goes off at battlefield leyen too 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.170
 because it is not quite as authentic 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.849
 such as a pay day 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.280
 it feels more like a battlefield 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:28.040
 We have just seen dlc 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.209
 how to collect the money then just 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.220
 You can do it in several stages ever 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:33.180
 After how you think how different 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.980
 you can take more money or 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.510
 less and you take it faster too 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.700
 when there are more people around you 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.860
 but then it goes back to the 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.690
 own base succeeded own safe and 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.160
 we have a very close one 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.870
 scene a bit pretended not around 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.890
 to be bored 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.360
 In the end, you have to pay the money 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.890
 lonely with then bring back 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.660
 if someone shoots you on the way 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:54.360
 then you can pick up the money and 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.770
 can thus also collect the money what you 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.630
 needed to win the round 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:00.450
 without taking this point, so to speak 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.620
 just like that 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.290
 So if we also have a vehicle 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.330
 used there are some and at this 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.580
 year brings us closer to that 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.930
 enemy point where we are then 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.120
 can steal money 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.489
 it is the same principle as the 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:17.069
 neutral vases or the money, so to speak 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:20.220
 take on time and not at once 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:23.970
 that's the way it looks like so send one 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:26.489
 Blood money round with a small stream 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.920
 the one in the beta ladder where unfortunately 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:31.470
 not around it comes you exploded stop 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.730
 just know it is cycling 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.700
 is a beta and there is 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:39.000
 still a few things so just this 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:40.920
 famous battlefield is killed in action 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.390
 which suddenly comes from somewhere 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.760
 and you do not really know what's going on 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:47.640
 is that still there are these 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:49.319
 whole net code-like stories the 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.120
 are not represented here so often 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:53.610
 However, one must say that it 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.230
 then everything is not so extensive in 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:56.940
 accordingly , maybe there too 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.260
 therefore less mistakes the weidmann 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.420
 it will just look like that at the 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:02.329
 will be final version so still 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:04.709
 the whole thing is really damn good and 

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:07.310
 plays fast and there is 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:09.630
 few mistakes as well as none at all 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:12.900
 and now here we come to the new one 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:14.400
 It's called mode and there's more to it 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.160
 tell a little more 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.359
 only the second player mode of offerers 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.310
 So this is just about it 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:24.660
 again capture the flag modification 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:26.570
 it's about these money cases 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:30.120
 steal 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:32.250
 and that's exactly what you have on the right 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:34.590
 that this great explosion the 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:36.240
 the money vehicle just blown away 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:38.460
 that's it works but is free 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:40.440
 scripted it happens in every round 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:41.130
 the same way to start 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:44.130
 every round 

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:45.780
 So here in a truck on the road 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:47.760
 So you have to get this one 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:49.889
 safe to say only the cash 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:51.330
 point can then just a bit the 

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:53.400
 safe crack what you do not 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:55.050
 Great staged gets so synonymous 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.450
 it is not all that complex 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:58.979
 at pay day where you really compare 

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:02.310
 must act tactically but in the first place 

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:03.960
 is it so you have battlefield 4 one 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:06.470
 mask put on in the case the 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:08.750
 gangster and policeman mask and 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:12.200
 accumulates thereby the area around 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:16.610
 money and this capture the flag little 

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:20.050
 gameplay goals so here it is 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:23.600
 that you that we all know very well 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:26.330
 occurs and I already have some 

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:28.370
 this effect had absolutely 2 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:30.770
 So best example of these car parks 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:34.840
 or the city feel it on this 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:37.880
 For example, shanghai map is accurate 

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:39.170
 right at the citÃ© shanghai was mine 

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:41.000
 now also in the first in the sense 

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:44.300
 came when I saw this map 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.250
 but then something different is the goal 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:49.850
 maybe a bit rebuilt 

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:52.310
 but not great as English already 

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:53.540
 it's pretty much 32 players 

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:55.790
 by the way, on the map on the way 

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:56.840
 The cards are quite small 

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:59.120
 and that is also one at a time 

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:01.550
 problem with the hai game mode because 

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:04.010
 if you have this purse and 

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:05.690
 So you have to support the museums 

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:08.030
 Protect then it is mostly like that 

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:09.530
 He travels to more or less circular 

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:10.970
 in the block and not like in the trailer too 

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:12.440
 somehow it was a big view 

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:14.990
 track pursued by police and such 

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:16.010
 It could be a bit difficult 

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:17.570
 then you would need one already 

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:21.380
 space and so it is just one 

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:22.490
 be whole lot he well it is then 

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:23.600
 it must in any case yet optimized 

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:24.260
 and you will see if we can do that 

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:26.270
 to create 

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:28.450
 He remains to be seen in any case 

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:31.580
 personally the maps are too small for me 

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:34.130
 his final conclusion to this 

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:36.460
 new battlefield we'll see if 

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:39.260
 battlefield row of this dlc 

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:41.150
 can remove status impression and then 

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:42.740
 really this standalone title 

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:44.570
 deserves it is a singleplayer will 

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:47.150
 give it and then hopefully 

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:48.979
 bigger multiplayer cards and something 

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:51.350
 what kind of play a bit more 

00:06:48.979 --> 00:06:55.330
 gangster and police pro maybe 

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:55.330
 more than that played so far
