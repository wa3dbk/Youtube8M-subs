00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:27.629 
might start with just body weight I have

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:31.190 
might start with just body weight I have
a<00:02:27.659> lot<00:02:27.930> more<00:02:28.140> range<00:02:28.590> of<00:02:28.799> motion<00:02:29.220> on<00:02:29.870> this<00:02:30.870> arm

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
a lot more range of motion on this arm

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.860 
a lot more range of motion on this arm
that<00:02:31.500> I<00:02:32.159> do<00:02:32.220> my<00:02:32.459> right<00:02:32.700> arm<00:02:32.909> that<00:02:33.510> right<00:02:33.690> arm

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
that I do my right arm that right arm

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.690 
that I do my right arm that right arm
has<00:02:34.019> got<00:02:34.170> some<00:02:34.379> funk<00:02:34.620> up<00:02:34.799> in<00:02:34.920> the<00:02:35.010> shoulder<00:02:35.370> so

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
has got some funk up in the shoulder so

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.699 
has got some funk up in the shoulder so
I've<00:02:36.239> got<00:02:36.450> it<00:02:36.569> shortened<00:02:37.140> the<00:02:37.319> range<00:02:37.530> of

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
I've got it shortened the range of

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:42.770 
I've got it shortened the range of
motion<00:02:38.129> do<00:02:38.730> a<00:02:38.760> bit<00:02:39.000> smaller<00:02:39.480> circle<00:02:41.780> because

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
motion do a bit smaller circle because

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.149 
motion do a bit smaller circle because
it<00:02:42.900> starts<00:02:43.170> getting<00:02:43.349> a<00:02:43.379> little<00:02:43.440> grumpy<00:02:43.980> as<00:02:44.040> I

00:02:44.149 --> 00:02:44.159 
it starts getting a little grumpy as I

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:45.949 
it starts getting a little grumpy as I
come<00:02:44.370> out<00:02:44.459> longer<00:02:44.970> I'll<00:02:45.540> get<00:02:45.810> there

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
come out longer I'll get there

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:47.059 
come out longer I'll get there
eventually<00:02:46.230> it's<00:02:46.560> just<00:02:46.680> a<00:02:46.739> matter<00:02:46.890> of<00:02:46.980> getting

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 
eventually it's just a matter of getting

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:53.539 
eventually it's just a matter of getting
stronger<00:02:47.489> so<00:02:47.819> again<00:02:51.799> not<00:02:52.799> ease<00:02:53.010> controlled

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:53.549 
stronger so again not ease controlled

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:59.949 
stronger so again not ease controlled
