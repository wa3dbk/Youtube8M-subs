to<00:01:06.120> it<00:01:06.330> that<00:01:06.360> need<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:06.720> be<00:01:06.750> finalized<00:01:07.710> how

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
to it that need to be finalized how

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.160 
to it that need to be finalized how
difficult<00:01:08.520> was<00:01:08.910> it<00:01:08.970> to<00:01:09.120> get<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.480> 13-year

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
difficult was it to get the 13-year

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.200 
difficult was it to get the 13-year
granting<00:01:10.830> of<00:01:10.950> rights<00:01:11.220> because<00:01:11.940> that

granting of rights because that

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.420 
granting of rights because that
obviously<00:01:12.660> is<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:13.020> cement<00:01:13.410> that<00:01:13.740> that<00:01:14.160> holds

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
obviously is the cement that that holds

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.070 
obviously is the cement that that holds
the<00:01:14.550> big<00:01:14.700> 12<00:01:14.940> together<00:01:15.210> well<00:01:15.750> you<00:01:15.960> know<00:01:16.050> I

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
the big 12 together well you know I

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.260 
the big 12 together well you know I
don't<00:01:16.440> think<00:01:16.830> you<00:01:16.950> can<00:01:17.130> put<00:01:17.520> words<00:01:17.760> on<00:01:17.970> paper

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
don't think you can put words on paper

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.320 
don't think you can put words on paper
that<00:01:18.630> that<00:01:19.020> necessarily<00:01:19.710> bind<00:01:20.610> people<00:01:20.880> in

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
that that necessarily bind people in

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.320 
that that necessarily bind people in
perpetuity<00:01:21.870> I<00:01:22.250> really<00:01:23.250> think<00:01:23.460> that<00:01:23.730> as<00:01:24.210> a

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
perpetuity I really think that as a

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.210 
perpetuity I really think that as a
conference<00:01:24.810> office<00:01:25.140> staff<00:01:25.560> and<00:01:25.890> as<00:01:26.010> an

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
conference office staff and as an

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.950 
conference office staff and as an

aggregation of members what we need to

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.890 
aggregation of members what we need to
do<00:01:28.110> together<00:01:28.290> is<00:01:28.740> we<00:01:29.280> need<00:01:29.430> to<00:01:29.610> build<00:01:30.150> things

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900

better can it work with a school that

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.180 
better can it work with a school that

would not be a football member well I'm

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:30.850 
would not be a football member well I'm
not<00:03:28.850> going<00:03:29.030> to<00:03:29.120> speculate<00:03:29.480> on<00:03:29.690> whether<00:03:30.530> they'd

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:30.860 
not going to speculate on whether they'd

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:32.350 
not going to speculate on whether they'd
be<00:03:31.040> a<00:03:31.070> football<00:03:31.490> member<00:03:31.850> wouldn't<00:03:32.240> be<00:03:32.330> a

be a football member wouldn't be a

be a football member wouldn't be a
football<00:03:32.750> member<00:03:33.110> or<00:03:33.230> whether<00:03:33.440> they're<00:03:33.680> even

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
football member or whether they're even

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:36.490 
football member or whether they're even
in<00:03:34.100> the<00:03:34.220> mix<00:03:34.430> I<00:03:34.670> I<00:03:34.700> just<00:03:35.150> think<00:03:35.390> we<00:03:35.959> need<00:03:36.230> to

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
in the mix I I just think we need to

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.160 
in the mix I I just think we need to
make<00:03:36.680> an<00:03:36.800> assessment<00:03:37.130> of<00:03:37.520> what<00:03:38.450> it<00:03:38.570> takes<00:03:38.840> to

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
make an assessment of what it takes to

as far as the the champions ball this is

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:06.010 
as far as the the champions ball this is

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 
the Southeastern Conference why is this

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.630 
the Southeastern Conference why is this
significant<00:04:09.350> obviously<00:04:09.650> the<00:04:09.770> money<00:04:10.010> will<00:04:10.489> be

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:10.640 
significant obviously the money will be

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:12.729 
significant obviously the money will be
there<00:04:10.910> and<00:04:11.420> the<00:04:11.540> television<00:04:12.080> partners<00:04:12.470> and

there and the television partners and

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:15.370 
there and the television partners and
that<00:04:12.890> but<00:04:13.610> why<00:04:13.820> is<00:04:13.880> this<00:04:14.270> so<00:04:14.690> significant<00:04:15.320> for

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:15.380 
that but why is this so significant for

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.740 
that but why is this so significant for
the<00:04:15.500> big<00:04:15.650> 12<00:04:15.860> well<00:04:16.760> I<00:04:16.790> think<00:04:16.970> it<00:04:17.209> allows<00:04:17.390> us<00:04:17.450> to

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
the big 12 well I think it allows us to

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:19.390 
the big 12 well I think it allows us to
compete<00:04:18.080> at<00:04:18.230> the<00:04:18.320> very<00:04:18.500> highest<00:04:18.739> level<00:04:19.280> of

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 
compete at the very highest level of

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.030 
compete at the very highest level of
competition<00:04:20.299> I<00:04:20.660> think<00:04:21.109> it<00:04:21.200> also<00:04:21.350> puts<00:04:21.739> us<00:04:21.890> on

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:22.040 
competition I think it also puts us on

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:24.400 
competition I think it also puts us on
an<00:04:22.730> even<00:04:23.000> playing<00:04:23.270> field<00:04:23.390> with<00:04:23.840> the<00:04:23.990> rose<00:04:24.140> bowl

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:24.410 
an even playing field with the rose bowl

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:25.090 
an even playing field with the rose bowl
and<00:04:24.710> the

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:25.100 
and the

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.790 
and the
the<00:04:25.250> pac-12<00:04:25.670> in<00:04:25.940> the<00:04:26.030> Big<00:04:26.180> Ten<00:04:26.440> it's<00:04:27.440> certainly

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:27.800 
the pac-12 in the Big Ten it's certainly

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.590 
the pac-12 in the Big Ten it's certainly
going<00:04:28.010> to<00:04:28.130> give<00:04:28.250> us<00:04:28.400> a<00:04:28.520> platform<00:04:28.790> on<00:04:29.360> New

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:29.600 
going to give us a platform on New

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.810 
going to give us a platform on New
Year's<00:04:29.780> Day<00:04:30.080> that<00:04:30.440> is<00:04:30.590> is<00:04:30.890> significant<00:04:31.670> I

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:31.820 
Year's Day that is is significant I

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:33.430 
Year's Day that is is significant I
think<00:04:32.480> that's<00:04:32.690> the<00:04:32.810> greatest<00:04:33.110> thing<00:04:33.320> about

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 
think that's the greatest thing about

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.460 
think that's the greatest thing about
the<00:04:33.830> playoff<00:04:34.190> process<00:04:35.000> is<00:04:35.570> that<00:04:35.930> we're<00:04:36.380> going

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:36.470 
the playoff process is that we're going

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:38.500 
the playoff process is that we're going
to<00:04:36.530> recapture<00:04:37.040> New<00:04:37.670> Year's<00:04:37.880> Eve<00:04:38.090> and<00:04:38.390> New

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:38.510 
to recapture New Year's Eve and New

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:40.300 
to recapture New Year's Eve and New
Year's<00:04:38.540> Day<00:04:38.930> and<00:04:39.230> it<00:04:39.650> really<00:04:39.860> is<00:04:40.010> going<00:04:40.100> to<00:04:40.190> be

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:40.310 
Year's Day and it really is going to be

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:42.850 
Year's Day and it really is going to be
a<00:04:40.340> celebration<00:04:40.580> of<00:04:41.060> football<00:04:41.420> and<00:04:41.620> the<00:04:42.620> fact

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
a celebration of football and the fact

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:44.770 
a celebration of football and the fact
that<00:04:42.950> we're<00:04:43.640> going<00:04:43.790> to<00:04:43.880> be<00:04:44.060> at<00:04:44.330> the<00:04:44.600> table

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:44.780 
that we're going to be at the table

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:47.380 
that we're going to be at the table
early<00:04:45.320> and<00:04:45.470> often<00:04:45.650> is<00:04:46.070> a<00:04:46.640> great<00:04:46.940> thing<00:04:47.150> for<00:04:47.180> our

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:47.390 
early and often is a great thing for our

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:50.320 
early and often is a great thing for our
league<00:04:47.690> and<00:04:47.930> I<00:04:48.350> just<00:04:49.160> think<00:04:49.430> the<00:04:50.000> sky's<00:04:50.300> the

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:50.330 
league and I just think the sky's the

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.270 
league and I just think the sky's the
limit<00:04:50.510> its<00:04:50.990> it's<00:04:51.290> you<00:04:51.590> know<00:04:51.710> it's<00:04:51.740> easy<00:04:52.070> to

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:52.280 
limit its it's you know it's easy to

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.400 
limit its it's you know it's easy to
forget<00:04:52.460> that<00:04:53.180> even<00:04:53.450> during<00:04:53.780> a<00:04:54.020> period<00:04:54.200> of

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:54.410 
forget that even during a period of

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:56.320 
forget that even during a period of
great<00:04:54.470> turmoil<00:04:55.100> our<00:04:55.430> league<00:04:55.760> had<00:04:55.970> terrific

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:56.330 
great turmoil our league had terrific

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.960 
great turmoil our league had terrific
success<00:04:56.990> over<00:04:57.290> the<00:04:57.350> last<00:04:57.410> 24<00:04:58.130> months<00:04:58.160> and

00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:58.970 
success over the last 24 months and

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:00.340 
success over the last 24 months and
there<00:04:59.090> would<00:04:59.210> be<00:04:59.240> nothing<00:04:59.510> in<00:04:59.900> that<00:04:59.930> agreement

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:00.350 
there would be nothing in that agreement

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:02.440 
there would be nothing in that agreement
that<00:05:00.800> would<00:05:00.890> stipulate<00:05:01.370> that<00:05:01.550> the<00:05:01.790> big<00:05:02.000> 12<00:05:02.240> has

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:02.450 
that would stipulate that the big 12 has

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:05.110 
that would stipulate that the big 12 has
