00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.640 
first I got the injector connector in my
hand<00:02:18.930> I'm<00:02:19.050> going<00:02:19.170> to<00:02:19.230> take<00:02:19.380> this<00:02:19.680> connector

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
hand I'm going to take this connector

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.550 
hand I'm going to take this connector
we're<00:02:22.650> gonna<00:02:22.740> plug<00:02:23.160> it<00:02:23.280> right<00:02:23.430> into<00:02:23.670> there

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
we're gonna plug it right into there

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:32.600 
we're gonna plug it right into there
just<00:02:25.560> like<00:02:25.770> so<00:02:26.040> then<00:02:30.980> this<00:02:31.980> is<00:02:32.190> going<00:02:32.310> to<00:02:32.370> go<00:02:32.550> to

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
just like so then this is going to go to

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:38.560 
just like so then this is going to go to
the<00:02:32.820> injector<00:02:35.780> just<00:02:36.780> get<00:02:36.990> it<00:02:37.110> down<00:02:37.320> on<00:02:37.350> there

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:38.570 
the injector just get it down on there

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:40.760 
the injector just get it down on there
press<00:02:39.570> it<00:02:39.780> down<00:02:39.900> on<00:02:40.110> until<00:02:40.380> you<00:02:40.470> hear<00:02:40.560> that

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
press it down on until you hear that

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:46.760 
press it down on until you hear that
magic<00:02:41.280> click<00:02:44.780> there's<00:02:45.780> the<00:02:46.140> snap<00:02:46.350> that<00:02:46.680> we

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
magic click there's the snap that we

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:50.890 
magic click there's the snap that we
want<00:02:46.980> to<00:02:47.070> hear<00:02:48.350> your<00:02:49.350> ear<00:02:49.560> cylinders<00:02:50.130> done

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
want to hear your ear cylinders done

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.720 
want to hear your ear cylinders done
front<00:02:51.900> cylinder<00:02:52.140> we<00:02:52.950> got<00:02:53.160> to<00:02:53.280> get<00:02:53.370> a<00:02:53.430> hold<00:02:53.640> of

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
front cylinder we got to get a hold of

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.000 
front cylinder we got to get a hold of
that<00:02:53.880> injector<00:02:54.390> connector<00:02:54.870> again<00:02:55.200> there<00:02:55.800> it

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
that injector connector again there it

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:01.370 
that injector connector again there it
is<00:02:57.170> put<00:02:58.170> them<00:02:58.290> together<00:03:00.050> then<00:03:01.050> we're<00:03:01.200> gonna

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
is put them together then we're gonna

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:06.590 
is put them together then we're gonna
click<00:03:01.770> this<00:03:02.010> down<00:03:02.340> on<00:03:02.550> the<00:03:02.760> injector<00:03:05.600> there

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
click this down on the injector there

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.580 
click this down on the injector there
again<00:03:06.960> with<00:03:07.170> the<00:03:07.320> old<00:03:07.440> long<00:03:08.270> nose<00:03:09.270> pliers<00:03:09.720> you

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
again with the old long nose pliers you

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.690 
again with the old long nose pliers you
can<00:03:10.740> get<00:03:10.860> a<00:03:10.890> hold<00:03:11.100> a<00:03:11.280> lot<00:03:11.430> easier<00:03:11.850> than<00:03:12.000> I<00:03:12.120> can

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
can get a hold a lot easier than I can

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:18.080 
can get a hold a lot easier than I can
there<00:03:14.700> it<00:03:14.880> is<00:03:15.830> then<00:03:16.830> I<00:03:16.860> can<00:03:17.010> pull<00:03:17.400> all<00:03:17.580> my<00:03:17.790> slack

there it is then I can pull all my slack

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.140 
there it is then I can pull all my slack
back<00:03:18.420> through<00:03:19.700> and<00:03:20.700> they<00:03:20.790> don't<00:03:20.940> want<00:03:21.060> all

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
that stuff hanging on the head there we

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:26.930 
that stuff hanging on the head there we
go<00:03:25.500> now<00:03:25.800> we're<00:03:25.980> not<00:03:26.130> touching<00:03:26.520> the<00:03:26.640> head<00:03:26.760> it's

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
go now we're not touching the head it's

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.580 
go now we're not touching the head it's
pretty<00:03:27.150> clean<00:03:27.450> in<00:03:27.690> there<00:03:27.870> I<00:03:30.200> can<00:03:31.200> come<00:03:31.380> right

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
pretty clean in there I can come right

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
nice and neat tidy now we're gonna take

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.140 
nice and neat tidy now we're gonna take
a<00:03:44.370> pair<00:03:44.700> of<00:03:45.590> snippers<00:03:46.590> and<00:03:46.620> cut<00:03:47.430> this<00:03:47.700> dang

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
a pair of snippers and cut this dang

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.229 
a pair of snippers and cut this dang
ground<00:03:48.660> loop<00:03:48.930> connector<00:03:49.970> because<00:03:50.970> I<00:03:51.060> don't

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
ground loop connector because I don't

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:54.699 
ground loop connector because I don't
want<00:03:51.360> to<00:03:51.420> take<00:03:51.540> the<00:03:51.660> bolt<00:03:51.870> all<00:03:52.110> the<00:03:52.140> way<00:03:52.320> out

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:57.310 

I'm<00:03:55.709> gonna<00:03:55.920> cheat<00:03:56.220> a<00:03:56.250> little<00:03:56.430> bit

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:57.320

and<00:04:02.970> then<00:04:03.180> I'm<00:04:03.239> gonna<00:04:03.330> put<00:04:03.630> our<00:04:04.370> ground<00:04:05.370> loop

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
and then I'm gonna put our ground loop

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:07.400 
and then I'm gonna put our ground loop
that<00:04:05.790> we<00:04:05.880> just<00:04:06.090> snipped<00:04:06.450> a<00:04:06.600> little<00:04:06.840> bit<00:04:06.959> to<00:04:07.200> fit

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
that we just snipped a little bit to fit

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:12.110 
that we just snipped a little bit to fit
right<00:04:07.650> down<00:04:07.709> in<00:04:08.310> there<00:04:09.080> there<00:04:10.080> we<00:04:10.320> go<00:04:11.060> and<00:04:12.060> now

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
right down in there there we go and now

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.070 
right down in there there we go and now
we<00:04:12.239> got<00:04:12.450> the<00:04:12.570> ground<00:04:12.780> loop<00:04:13.019> installed<00:04:14.930> this<00:04:15.930> is

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:16.080 
we got the ground loop installed this is

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.849 
we got the ground loop installed this is
pretty<00:04:16.320> simple

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:16.859 
pretty simple

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:20.930 
pretty simple
I<00:04:18.229> think<00:04:19.229> even<00:04:19.440> my<00:04:19.710> little<00:04:20.160> brother<00:04:20.489> could<00:04:20.729> do

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
I think even my little brother could do

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.210 
I think even my little brother could do
it<00:04:21.060> he's<00:04:21.239> only<00:04:21.450> in<00:04:21.660> first<00:04:21.960> grade

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 
it he's only in first grade

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:26.939 
it he's only in first grade
some<00:04:24.220> of<00:04:24.400> you<00:04:24.780> still<00:04:25.780> have<00:04:25.960> a<00:04:25.990> stock<00:04:26.319> seat<00:04:26.680> like

00:04:26.939 --> 00:04:26.949 
some of you still have a stock seat like

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:33.080 
some of you still have a stock seat like
this<00:04:29.009> you<00:04:30.009> can<00:04:30.190> smelt<00:04:30.490> the<00:04:30.639> TFI<00:04:31.090> right<00:04:31.389> there

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.090 
this you can smelt the TFI right there

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.969 
this you can smelt the TFI right there
if<00:04:34.090> you<00:04:34.360> don't<00:04:34.690> have<00:04:34.960> a<00:04:34.990> stock<00:04:35.349> seat<00:04:35.680> if<00:04:35.860> it's

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:35.979 
if you don't have a stock seat if it's

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:37.790 
if you don't have a stock seat if it's
just<00:04:36.280> a<00:04:36.400> single<00:04:36.639> seat

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
just a single seat

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.860 
just a single seat
we<00:04:38.800> suggest<00:04:39.280> mounting<00:04:39.610> the<00:04:39.669> TFI<00:04:40.180> right<00:04:40.479> up<00:04:40.659> in

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:40.870 
we suggest mounting the TFI right up in

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:45.210 
we suggest mounting the TFI right up in
here<00:04:41.849> now<00:04:42.849> I'm<00:04:42.909> gonna<00:04:43.030> turn<00:04:43.900> the<00:04:44.080> key<00:04:44.259> on<00:04:44.289> sure

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:45.220 
here now I'm gonna turn the key on sure

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:47.820 
here now I'm gonna turn the key on sure
she's<00:04:45.490> in<00:04:45.639> neutral

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:47.830

00:04:49.589 --> 00:04:49.599 
make sure your buttons in the run

00:04:49.599 --> 00:04:54.920 
make sure your buttons in the run
position<00:04:49.629> and<00:04:50.349> hit<00:04:50.470> start<00:04:50.740> fire<00:04:51.280> it<00:04:51.460> up

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:58.740 

we're<00:04:55.930> gonna<00:04:56.080> see<00:04:56.319> some<00:04:56.560> lights<00:04:56.830> now<00:04:57.750> that

00:04:58.740 --> 00:04:58.750 
we're gonna see some lights now that

00:04:58.750 --> 00:04:59.939 
we're gonna see some lights now that
just<00:04:59.020> means<00:04:59.229> it's<00:04:59.440> going<00:04:59.620> through<00:04:59.830> its
