00:00:39.859 --> 00:00:41.889 
actually decompress the spine which will
allow<00:00:40.100> for<00:00:40.489> the<00:00:40.670> cartilage<00:00:41.179> in<00:00:41.420> between<00:00:41.479> the

00:00:41.889 --> 00:00:41.899 
allow for the cartilage in between the

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:45.129 
allow for the cartilage in between the
vertebrae<00:00:42.409> to<00:00:42.949> thicken<00:00:43.479> under<00:00:44.479> the<00:00:44.569> duration

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:45.139

going to do four sets of hanging we're

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.790 
going to do four sets of hanging we're
going<00:01:48.830> to<00:01:48.920> do<00:01:49.040> it<00:01:49.220> quite<00:01:49.910> a<00:01:49.940> close<00:01:50.330> grip<00:01:50.800> start

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:51.800 
going to do it quite a close grip start

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:58.090 
going to do it quite a close grip start
with<00:01:52.010> so<00:01:52.220> we'll<00:01:52.370> do<00:01:52.520> one<00:01:53.680> two<00:01:54.880> three<00:01:55.960> four<00:01:57.100> the

with so we'll do one two three four the

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.800 
with so we'll do one two three four the
reason<00:01:58.400> why<00:01:58.490> we<00:01:58.610> alternate<00:01:59.000> is<00:01:59.180> it<00:01:59.360> just<00:01:59.570> gives

you<00:01:59.930> a<00:01:59.960> bit<00:02:00.140> more<00:02:00.350> bit<00:02:00.650> more<00:02:00.800> freedom<00:02:01.130> a<00:02:01.490> bit

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:01.760 
you a bit more bit more freedom a bit

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.969 
you a bit more bit more freedom a bit
more<00:02:01.940> of<00:02:02.060> a<00:02:02.180> body<00:02:02.810> mechanics<00:02:02.990> point<00:02:03.650> of<00:02:03.800> view

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
more of a body mechanics point of view

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:06.370 
more of a body mechanics point of view
so<00:02:04.250> not<00:02:04.490> only<00:02:04.640> stretching<00:02:05.420> this<00:02:05.570> part<00:02:05.930> but

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
so not only stretching this part but

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.919 
so not only stretching this part but
then<00:02:06.530> you<00:02:06.650> also<00:02:06.740> step<00:02:07.100> up<00:02:07.400> as<00:02:07.610> well<00:02:07.790> it<00:02:08.720> just

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
then you also step up as well it just

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:11.440 
then you also step up as well it just
gives<00:02:09.110> you<00:02:09.140> more<00:02:09.350> of<00:02:09.410> a<00:02:09.590> balanced<00:02:10.580> hand

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
gives you more of a balanced hand

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.290 
gives you more of a balanced hand
basically<00:02:12.700> and<00:02:13.700> you're<00:02:13.820> going<00:02:13.940> to<00:02:14.000> do<00:02:14.090> that

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
basically and you're going to do that

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.230 
basically and you're going to do that
for<00:02:14.600> thirty<00:02:15.170> seconds<00:02:15.650> each<00:02:15.680> time<00:02:16.040> with<00:02:16.790> about

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:17.240 
for thirty seconds each time with about

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.060 
for thirty seconds each time with about
a<00:02:17.270> minutes<00:02:17.630> rest<00:02:17.840> in<00:02:18.080> between<00:02:18.170> each<00:02:18.590> obviously

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.070 
a minutes rest in between each obviously

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:20.500 
a minutes rest in between each obviously
as<00:02:19.190> you<00:02:19.280> get<00:02:19.430> more<00:02:19.580> advanced<00:02:20.090> you're<00:02:20.240> going<00:02:20.300> to

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
as you get more advanced you're going to

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.080 
as you get more advanced you're going to
find<00:02:20.810> it<00:02:20.990> a<00:02:21.170> lot<00:02:21.770> easier<00:02:22.160> and<00:02:22.340> you<00:02:22.400> can<00:02:22.850> do

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
find it a lot easier and you can do

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.230 
find it a lot easier and you can do
anything<00:02:23.360> from<00:02:23.750> up<00:02:23.990> to<00:02:24.490> just<00:02:25.490> two<00:02:25.790> minutes<00:02:26.090> of

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:26.240 
anything from up to just two minutes of

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:27.490 
anything from up to just two minutes of
pure<00:02:26.450> hanging<00:02:26.930> which<00:02:27.080> is<00:02:27.170> what<00:02:27.350> we'll<00:02:27.470> be

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
pure hanging which is what we'll be

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.150 
pure hanging which is what we'll be
doing<00:02:27.709> today<00:02:27.800> up<00:02:28.520> to<00:02:28.910> ten<00:02:29.330> minutes<00:02:29.630> a<00:02:29.720> day<00:02:30.160> so

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
doing today up to ten minutes a day so

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.030 
doing today up to ten minutes a day so
we're<00:02:31.250> just<00:02:31.280> going<00:02:31.490> to<00:02:31.520> start<00:02:31.790> off<00:02:32.000> by<00:02:32.030> the<00:02:32.240> way

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
we're just going to start off by the way

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.770 
we're just going to start off by the way
roughly<00:02:34.750> shoulder-width<00:02:35.750> apart

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
roughly shoulder-width apart

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.920 
roughly shoulder-width apart
hopefully<00:02:38.590> be<00:02:38.740> able<00:02:38.830> to<00:02:38.920> see<00:02:39.100> my<00:02:39.220> hands

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.070 

they<00:02:42.500> just<00:02:42.739> get<00:02:42.920> at<00:02:43.040> home

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
they just get at home

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.110 
they just get at home
obviously<00:02:45.860> at<00:02:45.950> this<00:02:46.070> point<00:02:46.130> I<00:02:46.520> can't<00:02:46.760> actually

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
obviously at this point I can't actually

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.880 
obviously at this point I can't actually
let<00:02:47.360> my<00:02:47.480> legs<00:02:47.690> drop<00:02:47.990> because<00:02:48.560> of<00:02:48.590> a<00:02:48.740> lot<00:02:48.860> of

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
let my legs drop because of a lot of

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:56.690 
let my legs drop because of a lot of
taller

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.960 

so<00:02:57.240> you<00:02:57.300> can<00:02:57.480> use<00:02:57.569> that<00:02:57.840> one<00:02:58.050> for<00:02:58.970> three

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
so you can use that one for three

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.570 
so you can use that one for three
seconds<00:03:00.540> have<00:03:01.319> a<00:03:01.349> little<00:03:01.620> breather<00:03:01.830> it's

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
seconds have a little breather it's

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:03.860 
seconds have a little breather it's
going<00:03:02.849> to<00:03:02.970> this<00:03:03.060> bar<00:03:03.300> is<00:03:03.420> a<00:03:03.480> little<00:03:03.630> bit

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
going to this bar is a little bit

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.479 
going to this bar is a little bit
slippery<00:03:04.230> so<00:03:04.349> what<00:03:04.650> you<00:03:04.709> might<00:03:04.860> find<00:03:05.099> is<00:03:05.370> you

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
slippery so what you might find is you

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:08.870 
slippery so what you might find is you
might<00:03:05.640> need<00:03:05.790> to<00:03:05.940> get<00:03:06.090> some<00:03:06.530> gloves<00:03:07.580> maybe<00:03:08.580> some

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
might need to get some gloves maybe some

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.790 
might need to get some gloves maybe some
lightweight<00:03:09.060> gloves<00:03:09.599> that<00:03:09.780> really<00:03:10.230> grip<00:03:10.530> this

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
lightweight gloves that really grip this

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.699 
lightweight gloves that really grip this
bar<00:03:11.040> is<00:03:11.280> a<00:03:11.840> metal<00:03:12.840> and<00:03:13.080> obviously<00:03:13.350> like<00:03:13.440> with

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
bar is a metal and obviously like with

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:15.620 
bar is a metal and obviously like with
it<00:03:13.800> being<00:03:13.980> too<00:03:14.580> hot<00:03:14.760> quickly<00:03:15.030> it's<00:03:15.330> like<00:03:15.600> I

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
it being too hot quickly it's like I

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.360 
it being too hot quickly it's like I
have<00:03:15.930> this<00:03:16.050> looking<00:03:16.290> a<00:03:16.440> little<00:03:16.560> bit

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
have this looking a little bit

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:19.979 
have this looking a little bit
