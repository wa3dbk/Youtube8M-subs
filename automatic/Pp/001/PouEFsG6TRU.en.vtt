think it's if people know the technique
and<00:03:57.799> what<00:03:57.980> goes<00:03:58.190> into<00:03:58.489> something<00:03:58.970> like<00:03:59.090> this

00:03:59.319 --> 00:03:59.329 
and what goes into something like this

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:01.000 
and what goes into something like this
and<00:03:59.599> and<00:03:59.780> it's<00:04:00.049> just<00:04:00.379> amazing<00:04:00.890> to<00:04:00.920> watch

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:01.010

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:31.070 
something happened you know and I think

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:32.530 
something happened you know and I think
maybe<00:04:31.250> I<00:04:31.370> didn't<00:04:31.640> love<00:04:31.670> this<00:04:31.940> routine<00:04:32.270> as<00:04:32.390> much

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:32.540

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:36.200 
maybe in the house there was sort of a

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.890 
maybe in the house there was sort of a
lull<00:04:36.710> in<00:04:36.740> the<00:04:36.950> energy<00:04:37.340> when<00:04:37.520> Mel<00:04:37.700> goes<00:04:37.910> ah<00:04:38.240> I

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:38.900

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:41.450 
don't know if that's necessarily good so

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:43.600
