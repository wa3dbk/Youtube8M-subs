00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.360 
just blow a little bit of air from our
nose<00:00:32.399> so<00:00:33.270> we<00:00:33.390> can<00:00:33.680> equalize<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:34.890> pressure<00:00:35.070> so

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
nose so we can equalize the pressure so

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.310 
nose so we can equalize the pressure so
we<00:00:35.520> changed<00:00:35.940> it<00:00:36.030> to<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.420> surrounding<00:00:37.020> press

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
we changed it to the surrounding press

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.819 
we changed it to the surrounding press
yes<00:00:37.620> yeah<00:00:38.540> when<00:00:39.540> we're<00:00:39.719> going<00:00:39.930> up<00:00:40.200> in<00:00:40.410> II<00:00:40.530> don't

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
yes yeah when we're going up in II don't

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.160 
yes yeah when we're going up in II don't
need<00:00:41.070> to<00:00:41.280> worry<00:00:41.489> about<00:00:41.610> resn<00:00:42.480> Hamas<00:00:42.780> because

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
need to worry about resn Hamas because

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.500 
need to worry about resn Hamas because
then<00:00:43.379> they<00:00:43.559> I<00:00:43.590> can<00:00:43.920> easily<00:00:44.370> escape<00:00:44.640> through

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
then they I can easily escape through

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.470 
then they I can easily escape through
the<00:00:45.629> side<00:00:45.870> of<00:00:45.899> our<00:00:46.170> mosque<00:00:46.410> and<00:00:47.270> the<00:00:48.270> ones

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
the side of our mosque and the ones

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.600 
the side of our mosque and the ones
inside<00:00:48.780> I<00:00:49.050> yeah<00:00:49.410> it<00:00:49.469> just<00:00:49.739> goes<00:00:50.129> through<00:00:50.190> our

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
inside I yeah it just goes through our

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.639 
inside I yeah it just goes through our
breathing<00:00:51.000> but<00:00:51.570> that's<00:00:51.719> also<00:00:51.960> one<00:00:52.410> of<00:00:52.440> the

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
breathing but that's also one of the

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.950 
breathing but that's also one of the
reason<00:00:52.949> why<00:00:53.100> it's<00:00:53.250> always<00:00:53.930> important<00:00:54.930> to

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
reason why it's always important to

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:08.030 
reason why it's always important to
breathe<00:00:55.379> yeah<00:00:56.160> both<00:00:56.489> to<00:00:56.730> equalize<00:01:06.110> and<00:01:07.110> then

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
breathe yeah both to equalize and then

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.859 
breathe yeah both to equalize and then
we're<00:01:08.280> just<00:01:08.310> gonna<00:01:08.760> practice<00:01:09.119> a<00:01:09.510> little<00:01:09.659> bit

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
we're just gonna practice a little bit

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.789 
we're just gonna practice a little bit
of<00:01:10.020> breathing<00:01:10.409> give<00:01:11.010> you<00:01:11.540> yeah<00:01:12.570> later<00:01:13.229> on<00:01:13.380> in

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
of breathing give you yeah later on in

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.230 
of breathing give you yeah later on in
the<00:01:13.920> beginning<00:01:14.070> we're<00:01:14.460> just<00:01:14.729> gonna<00:01:14.909> breathe

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240

yeah<00:02:14.069> then<00:02:14.700> you<00:02:14.819> get<00:02:15.000> it<00:02:15.090> a<00:02:15.180> lot<00:02:15.330> of<00:02:15.480> time

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
yeah then you get it a lot of time

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.270 
yeah then you get it a lot of time
because<00:02:15.840> now<00:02:17.840> yeah<00:02:18.840> you<00:02:19.290> can<00:02:19.440> take<00:02:19.650> that<00:02:19.830> one<00:02:20.069> I

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
because now yeah you can take that one I

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.460 
because now yeah you can take that one I
will<00:02:20.700> give<00:02:20.910> you<00:02:21.030> plenty<00:02:21.300> of<00:02:21.510> time<00:02:21.600> to<00:02:21.810> find<00:02:22.170> the

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
will give you plenty of time to find the

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.620 
will give you plenty of time to find the
other<00:02:22.680> one<00:02:22.800> if<00:02:23.069> you<00:02:23.190> have<00:02:23.280> a<00:02:23.310> bit<00:02:23.550> of<00:02:23.670> hard<00:02:24.360> time

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
other one if you have a bit of hard time

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.900 
other one if you have a bit of hard time
finding<00:02:24.930> it<00:02:25.140> but<00:02:25.620> normally<00:02:25.830> if<00:02:26.280> you<00:02:26.400> swim<00:02:26.730> in

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
finding it but normally if you swim in

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.760 
finding it but normally if you swim in
big<00:02:27.120> open<00:02:27.270> water<00:02:27.660> you<00:02:27.930> can<00:02:28.080> just<00:02:28.290> do<00:02:28.440> this<00:02:28.590> we

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
big open water you can just do this we

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.740 
big open water you can just do this we
for<00:02:29.010> the<00:02:29.100> region<00:02:29.459> shouldn't<00:02:29.880> be<00:02:29.940> a<00:02:29.970> problem

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
for the region shouldn't be a problem

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.250 
for the region shouldn't be a problem
yeah<00:02:31.640> so<00:02:32.640> we'll<00:02:32.819> practice<00:02:33.120> these<00:02:33.569> two<00:02:33.870> then

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
yeah so we'll practice these two then

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.940 
yeah so we'll practice these two then
we'll<00:02:34.380> practice<00:02:34.590> how<00:02:34.980> to<00:02:35.040> clear<00:02:35.580> all<00:02:36.360> mass<00:02:36.950> put

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
we'll practice how to clear all mass put

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.240 
we'll practice how to clear all mass put
a<00:02:37.980> little<00:02:38.280> bit<00:02:38.370> of<00:02:38.489> water<00:02:39.560> put<00:02:40.560> pressure<00:02:40.980> on

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
a little bit of water put pressure on

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.030 
a little bit of water put pressure on
top<00:02:41.550> of<00:02:41.610> the<00:02:41.880> mouth<00:02:42.060> and<00:02:42.360> then<00:02:42.650> just<00:02:43.650> blow<00:02:44.010> out

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
top of the mouth and then just blow out

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.910 
top of the mouth and then just blow out
through<00:02:44.580> our<00:02:44.730> nose<00:02:45.000> and<00:02:45.590> therefore<00:02:46.590> my<00:02:46.680> nose

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
through our nose and therefore my nose

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.260 
through our nose and therefore my nose
go<00:02:47.160> into<00:02:47.489> a<00:02:47.519> mask<00:02:47.820> and<00:02:48.150> it<00:02:48.269> push<00:02:48.540> out<00:02:48.780> the<00:02:49.019> water
