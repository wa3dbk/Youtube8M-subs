00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.539 
jokes with child in the manga I found
them<00:00:13.139> a<00:00:13.200> little<00:00:13.410> bit<00:00:13.530> funny<00:00:13.799> kind<00:00:14.160> of<00:00:14.280> looking

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
them a little bit funny kind of looking

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:15.890 
them a little bit funny kind of looking
back<00:00:14.730> at<00:00:14.910> it<00:00:14.940> it<00:00:15.150> felt<00:00:15.330> a<00:00:15.360> little<00:00:15.480> bit<00:00:15.660> childish

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
back at it it felt a little bit childish

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.260 
back at it it felt a little bit childish
but<00:00:16.289> it<00:00:16.410> also<00:00:16.560> raises<00:00:17.279> a<00:00:17.490> couple<00:00:17.820> of<00:00:17.910> questions

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
but it also raises a couple of questions

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.510 
but it also raises a couple of questions
because<00:00:18.420> we<00:00:18.750> do<00:00:18.930> know<00:00:19.170> that<00:00:19.560> the<00:00:19.800> design<00:00:20.220> of

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
because we do know that the design of

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.120 
because we do know that the design of
the<00:00:20.730> spiral<00:00:21.330> zetsu<00:00:21.810> is<00:00:22.080> similar<00:00:22.590> to<00:00:22.740> the<00:00:22.859> mask

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
the spiral zetsu is similar to the mask

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:23.870 
the spiral zetsu is similar to the mask
that<00:00:23.490> later

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
that later

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.210 
that later
Obito<00:00:24.480> dons<00:00:24.900> when<00:00:25.170> it<00:00:25.260> becomes<00:00:25.529> Toby<00:00:25.920> but<00:00:26.039> it's

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
Obito dons when it becomes Toby but it's

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.740 
Obito dons when it becomes Toby but it's
orange<00:00:26.699> and<00:00:26.910> it<00:00:27.000> kind<00:00:27.180> of<00:00:27.210> makes<00:00:27.359> you<00:00:27.449> wonder

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
orange and it kind of makes you wonder

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.259 
orange and it kind of makes you wonder
like<00:00:28.080> does<00:00:28.830> that<00:00:28.890> spirals<00:00:29.519> that<00:00:29.670> so<00:00:29.849> actually

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
like does that spirals that so actually

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.540 
like does that spirals that so actually
still<00:00:30.510> live<00:00:30.720> on<00:00:30.750> and<00:00:31.289> when<00:00:31.650> he's<00:00:31.920> and<00:00:32.160> that

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
still live on and when he's and that

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.790 
still live on and when he's and that
Toby<00:00:33.030> mode<00:00:33.300> you<00:00:33.750> know<00:00:33.840> when<00:00:33.989> he<00:00:34.050> first<00:00:34.079> shows

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
Toby mode you know when he first shows

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.680 
Toby mode you know when he first shows
up<00:00:35.070> is<00:00:35.219> that<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.640> spirals<00:00:36.149> and<00:00:36.329> so<00:00:36.510> actually

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
up is that the spirals and so actually

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.240 
up is that the spirals and so actually
controlling<00:00:37.290> Obito<00:00:37.739> so<00:00:38.070> it<00:00:38.129> definitely

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
controlling Obito so it definitely

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.280 
controlling Obito so it definitely
raises<00:00:38.790> some<00:00:38.969> interesting<00:00:39.629> questions

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
raises some interesting questions

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.619 
raises some interesting questions
regarding<00:00:40.950> like<00:00:41.100> you<00:00:41.219> know<00:00:41.340> we<00:00:41.579> chose<00:00:41.790> wacky

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
regarding like you know we chose wacky

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.360 
regarding like you know we chose wacky
personality<00:00:43.379> when<00:00:43.500> he<00:00:43.559> first<00:00:43.770> shows<00:00:44.010> up<00:00:44.190> if

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
personality when he first shows up if

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.100 
personality when he first shows up if
it's<00:00:44.579> indeed<00:00:44.910> that<00:00:45.090> spirals<00:00:45.600> that<00:00:45.780> so<00:00:45.930> that's

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
it's indeed that spirals that so that's

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.810 
it's indeed that spirals that so that's
controlling<00:00:46.500> him<00:00:46.800> did<00:00:47.160> he<00:00:47.280> get<00:00:47.489> it<00:00:47.579> from<00:00:47.700> that

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
controlling him did he get it from that

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.549 
controlling him did he get it from that
far<00:00:48.090> as<00:00:48.210> that<00:00:48.360> someone<00:00:48.600> just<00:00:48.780> reacted<00:00:49.410> how

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
far as that someone just reacted how

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.619 
far as that someone just reacted how
that<00:00:49.950> spiral<00:00:50.399> zetsu<00:00:50.850> used<00:00:51.090> to<00:00:51.210> act<00:00:51.390> and

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
that spiral zetsu used to act and

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.180 
that spiral zetsu used to act and
whatnot<00:00:51.930> or<00:00:52.110> you<00:00:52.379> know<00:00:52.500> it<00:00:52.680> kind<00:00:52.920> of<00:00:52.949> makes<00:00:53.070> you

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
whatnot or you know it kind of makes you

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.010 
whatnot or you know it kind of makes you
wonder<00:00:53.309> whatever<00:00:54.090> happens<00:00:54.510> to<00:00:54.660> that<00:00:54.690> sprite

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
wonder whatever happens to that sprite

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.689 
wonder whatever happens to that sprite
was<00:00:55.170> that<00:00:55.320> so<00:00:55.469> later<00:00:55.680> on<00:00:55.890> but<00:00:56.250> overall<00:00:56.370> the

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
was that so later on but overall the

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.220 
was that so later on but overall the
first<00:00:56.879> half<00:00:57.120> was<00:00:57.300> mainly<00:00:57.510> just<00:00:57.809> kind<00:00:58.050> of<00:00:58.140> a

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
first half was mainly just kind of a

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.139 
first half was mainly just kind of a
little<00:00:58.410> bit<00:00:58.590> of<00:00:58.710> setup<00:00:58.980> like<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.609> calm<00:00:59.879> before

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
little bit of setup like the calm before

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.090 
little bit of setup like the calm before
the<00:01:00.420> storm<00:01:00.570> it<00:01:01.109> was<00:01:01.199> a<00:01:01.260> little<00:01:01.469> bit<00:01:01.590> slow<00:01:01.829> paced

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
the storm it was a little bit slow paced

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.529 
the storm it was a little bit slow paced
and<00:01:02.280> kind<00:01:02.489> of<00:01:02.579> boring<00:01:02.789> in<00:01:02.969> certain<00:01:03.270> parts

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
and kind of boring in certain parts

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.090 
and kind of boring in certain parts
because<00:01:03.690> it<00:01:03.780> just<00:01:03.960> made<00:01:04.080> me<00:01:04.199> like<00:01:04.350> over<00:01:04.739> to

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
because it just made me like over to

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.740 
because it just made me like over to
laying<00:01:05.339> in<00:01:05.519> better<00:01:05.729> than<00:01:06.000> trying<00:01:06.299> to<00:01:06.390> train

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
laying in better than trying to train

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.140 
laying in better than trying to train
and<00:01:07.110> a<00:01:07.229> lot<00:01:07.470> of<00:01:07.500> Ren<00:01:07.860> talked<00:01:08.189> a<00:01:08.400> lot<00:01:08.640> of<00:01:08.909> Ren

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
and a lot of Ren talked a lot of Ren

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.690 
and a lot of Ren talked a lot of Ren
talk<00:01:09.420> but<00:01:09.689> that<00:01:09.869> there's<00:01:10.710> still<00:01:10.920> way<00:01:11.159> more<00:01:11.520> to

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
talk but that there's still way more to

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.520 
talk but that there's still way more to
go<00:01:11.909> then<00:01:12.299> we<00:01:12.360> get<00:01:12.479> to<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.720> second<00:01:13.080> half<00:01:13.229> and<00:01:13.439> I

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
go then we get to the second half and I

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.230 
go then we get to the second half and I
believe<00:01:13.770> this<00:01:13.950> episode<00:01:14.340> animated<00:01:14.880> three

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
believe this episode animated three

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.270 
believe this episode animated three
chapters<00:01:15.869> so<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.170> pacing<00:01:16.590> was<00:01:16.619> actually<00:01:17.130> very

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
chapters so the pacing was actually very

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.490 
chapters so the pacing was actually very
good<00:01:17.610> in<00:01:17.850> a<00:01:17.939> sense<00:01:18.119> because<00:01:18.570> first<00:01:18.990> of<00:01:19.140> all<00:01:19.229> it

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
good in a sense because first of all it

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.469 
good in a sense because first of all it
went<00:01:19.770> through<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.070> Kakashi<00:01:20.850> standing<00:01:21.330> to

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
went through the Kakashi standing to

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.980 
went through the Kakashi standing to
rinse<00:01:21.780> stuff<00:01:22.020> which<00:01:22.259> oh<00:01:22.439> my<00:01:22.590> god<00:01:22.770> that<00:01:22.920> scene

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990 
rinse stuff which oh my god that scene

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.719 
rinse stuff which oh my god that scene
fucking<00:01:24.990> crazy<00:01:25.380> shit<00:01:25.830> and<00:01:26.070> then<00:01:26.159> it<00:01:26.280> goes<00:01:26.430> even

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
fucking crazy shit and then it goes even

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.580 
fucking crazy shit and then it goes even
to<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.000> other<00:01:27.180> part<00:01:27.600> where<00:01:27.720> he's<00:01:27.990> like<00:01:28.170> I'm<00:01:28.409> in

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
to the other part where he's like I'm in

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.530 
to the other part where he's like I'm in
hell<00:01:28.860> so<00:01:29.130> it<00:01:29.250> did<00:01:29.369> three<00:01:29.700> chapters<00:01:30.329> and

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
hell so it did three chapters and

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.270 
hell so it did three chapters and
definitely<00:01:31.110> I<00:01:31.170> gotta<00:01:31.350> say<00:01:31.590> from<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:31.890> midway

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
definitely I gotta say from the midway

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.730 
definitely I gotta say from the midway
point<00:01:32.520> on<00:01:32.820> it<00:01:33.270> was<00:01:33.479> just<00:01:33.659> cake<00:01:34.049> this<00:01:34.350> episode

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
point on it was just cake this episode

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:35.899 
point on it was just cake this episode

was really fucking awesome for the

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.690 
was really fucking awesome for the
midway<00:01:36.210> point<00:01:36.240> it<00:01:36.840> really<00:01:37.170> just<00:01:37.380> it<00:01:38.070> makes<00:01:38.460> me

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
midway point it really just it makes me

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.609 
midway point it really just it makes me
feel<00:01:39.030> something<00:01:39.630> that<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:39.960> manga<00:01:40.290> doesn't

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
feel something that the manga doesn't

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.109 
feel something that the manga doesn't
feel<00:01:40.799> and<00:01:41.009> I<00:01:41.070> guess<00:01:41.220> that<00:01:41.400> studio<00:01:41.640> period<00:01:42.090> I

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
this is a feeling that I got slightly

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.459 
this is a feeling that I got slightly
from<00:02:03.119> the<00:02:03.210> manga<00:02:03.570> but<00:02:03.600> I<00:02:03.750> wasn't<00:02:03.960> really<00:02:04.170> too

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
from the manga but I wasn't really too

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.620 
from the manga but I wasn't really too
into<00:02:04.770> it<00:02:04.829> but<00:02:05.040> with<00:02:05.460> the<00:02:05.610> anime<00:02:06.090> it's<00:02:06.390> really

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
into it but with the anime it's really

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.270 
into it but with the anime it's really
making<00:02:06.810> you<00:02:07.049> feel<00:02:07.259> like<00:02:07.320> you're<00:02:07.560> hearing<00:02:08.009> him

00:03:47.919 --> 00:03:48.509 
people were getting destroyed Obito was
going<00:03:48.129> crazy

going crazy

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:50.159 
going crazy
it<00:03:48.579> was<00:03:48.669> just<00:03:48.879> pounding<00:03:49.629> people<00:03:49.959> onto<00:03:50.139> the

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:50.169 
it was just pounding people onto the

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:51.990 
it was just pounding people onto the
ground<00:03:50.829> I<00:03:50.859> think<00:03:51.129> the<00:03:51.220> ending<00:03:51.609> is<00:03:51.729> very

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
ground I think the ending is very

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.580 
ground I think the ending is very
appropriate<00:03:52.479> while<00:03:52.840> the<00:03:52.959> opening<00:03:53.290> doesn't

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
appropriate while the opening doesn't

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:54.809 
appropriate while the opening doesn't
necessarily<00:03:54.099> fit<00:03:54.280> an<00:03:54.370> episode<00:03:54.699> like<00:03:54.759> this

00:03:54.809 --> 00:03:54.819 
necessarily fit an episode like this

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:57.179 
necessarily fit an episode like this
ending<00:03:55.419> it<00:03:55.599> just<00:03:55.930> leads<00:03:56.199> from<00:03:56.590> the<00:03:56.650> episode

00:03:57.179 --> 00:03:57.189 
ending it just leads from the episode

00:03:57.189 --> 00:03:58.860 
ending it just leads from the episode
into<00:03:57.519> the<00:03:57.609> ending<00:03:57.909> if<00:03:58.000> anything<00:03:58.359> this<00:03:58.449> episode

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
into the ending if anything this episode

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:00.509
