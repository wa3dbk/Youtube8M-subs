00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:14.440
 in this video we present the 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:16.950
 foundations and knowledge on 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.950
 bomb of void 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.699
 the vacuum is used in many vehicles 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.800
 for the assistance of the force of 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.539
 braking and to power devices 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.699
 tires 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.619
 for example in the brake booster 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.660
 through the void the 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.480
 force applied by the foot on the 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.700
 brake pedal 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.860
 Depression boxes are used to 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.400
 regular butterflies valves and others 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.400
 components 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.910
 some examples are 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:48.420
 the recirculation valves of the 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:48.420
 exhaust gases 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.609
 the switches of the suction tube 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:02.420
 the butterflies of the escape 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:08.109
 the control of the turbo charger 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:15.910
 vacuum pumps are installed in 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.240
 vehicles that do not have enough 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:18.240
 empty 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.940
 conventional diesel engines are 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.280
 equipped as standard with a pump 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.500
 empty since they do not have a valve 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.750
 of butterfly and therefore it is not generated 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.640
 empty 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.530
 also in gasoline engines in the 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:35.390
 that the vacuum is insufficient in the 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:38.120
 suction pipe behind the 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:40.940
 Butterfly valve increases diffusion 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:42.830
 of vacuum pumps for these reasons 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:45.200
 and due to the diesel boom in the 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:48.320
 recent years are currently installed more 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.000
 vacuum pumps that never in some 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.010
 markets in the engine compartment 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.060
 is prescribed a scheme of the 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:55.060
 pipes depression 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:59.480
 Vacuum pumps as they are 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:02.720
 placed in the vehicles generate a 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:05.240
 empty of approximately between 07 and 09 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.159
 pubs 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.750
 they have to be designed so that 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:10.819
 even with brake maneuvers 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:14.920
 frequent there's enough empty 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:14.920
 available for braking booster 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:18.950
 the vacuum pumps in which a piston 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:22.840
 or a membrane moves from one side to 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.840
 another have a long tradition 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.489
 a more recent development are the 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.420
 rotary vane vacuum pumps 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:33.180
 using a rotor with one or several 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.799
 pallets generate work zones whose 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.250
 size changes during the cycle of 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:37.250
 work 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:44.799
 a vacuum pump can be operated by 

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:47.010
 medium of cam attacks straps chains or 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:49.140
 cam discs 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.689
 the latest technological advance are the 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.700
 Vacuum pumps mono palette that in 

00:02:51.689 --> 00:02:55.829
 many cases are mounted on the cylinder head 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.439
 of the cylinder and are driven by the 

00:02:55.829 --> 00:03:00.120
 camshaft in general air 

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:02.629
 Aspiration is conducted to the butt of the 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.629
 cylinder 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.730
 this recording the ultra-fast speed 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:09.830
 inside of a mono vacuum pump 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.450
 pallet offers an impression of the 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:13.200
 charges that occur during the 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.090
 functioning 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.459
 for the interior hard chair the 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.140
 thermal dissipation of lubrication the 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:21.260
 vacuum pumps need oil 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.260
 lubricant 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:26.439
 the supply of lubricating oil to 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.719
 often takes place through channels 

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:30.819
 in the cylinder head or in the tree 

00:03:28.719 --> 00:03:32.950
 of cams oil lubricants 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:36.159
 led back to the engine along with the air 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:38.590
 of escape in so-called tandem pumps 

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:42.420
 Vacuum pumps are combined with other 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:45.000
 feeding pumps on a common axis 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.830
 as an empty fuel pump or as 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.920
 here in combination with a pump 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:48.920
 oil 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.550
 future developments in particular in 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:55.379
 regarding alternative driving systems 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:57.400
 they go to the vacuum pumps 

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:59.260
 electric 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.540
 you can start when 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:04.090
 necessary and independently of the engine 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:06.099
 of the vehicle in hybrid vehicles 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.629
 maintain the assistance of the force of 

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:10.510
 braking when the combustion engine 

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:12.970
 the systems provider is off 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:14.920
