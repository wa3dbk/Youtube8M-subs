00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.350
Beneath an unspeaking moon, in a quiet bamboo garden

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:34.090
The wind’s song rustles, making itself known

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:39.500
Where a shower of moonlight illuminates a single girl

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:44.820
Clothed in flame her dripping blood melts,

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.330
A scarlet heat mirage all about her – without a thought, “…”

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:03.710
『I came this way because I smelled blood』

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.480
Her wounded cheek distorts in a scowl, and

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:11.890
Her crimson eyes sway in emptiness, before collapsing

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:17.180
…I think about it even now, that day, that night

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:22.120
With such a great and painful karma held upon such tiny shoulders.

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:33.240
Always looking far away, always searching for someone

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.670
Ah, with such a clear night as this

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.590
All might burn away in conflagration..

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:49.470
O bird of the immortal flame, descending from the heavens

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.810
Your life flame burns, exhausts, and ignites anew

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:00.080
Rising pulse and insanity, give me a reason to live!

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:05.750
My time, far too long, has destroyed me… eaten me away..

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.180
Before, you were alone; tomorrow again you will be alone

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.930
If you say you don’t need anyone

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:27.180
Then don’t look at me with such sad eyes!

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:32.760
Your silver hair is cut very nicely, I say and laugh;

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.960
『That’s only an imprint, proof that I’m still alive, so I don’t forget』

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:48.850
I was human once too! A time stolen, lost, that we can’t return to

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:59.270
I’ve also been alone, but I don’t want to hurt you anymore!

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:05.010
From the sky rains burning tears of blood

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:10.320
I scream in fear of nothingness, in a shining night that shakes my heart

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:15.770
Even if I search for a place to die, I can’t die

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:21.130
Even if I want to return, I can’t find anywhere to return to anymore

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:07.070
This pain in living and joy in exhaustion

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:12.380
If my end won’t ever come for all eternity

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:17.540
Then is my revenge no more than a game?

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:55.280
Called by a nostalgic voice, she turns around

00:04:55.540 --> 00:05:00.930
Only the gentle wind, wiping away her overflowing tears, disappeared

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:05.900
The crazed moonlight, will change you into a monster

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:11.790
The ones I have to protect have increased “I won’t let anyone lay a finger on you.”

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:21.900
Carrying Eternity
