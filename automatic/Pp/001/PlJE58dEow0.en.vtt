00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.580 
it continued again it'll tell you this
will<00:02:10.709> create<00:02:10.860> a<00:02:11.039> custom<00:02:11.489> ipsw<00:02:11.910> file<00:02:12.629> so<00:02:13.170> if<00:02:13.500> you

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
will create a custom ipsw file so if you

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:14.360 
will create a custom ipsw file so if you
don't<00:02:13.800> know<00:02:13.860> what<00:02:14.010> the<00:02:14.040> job

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
don't know what the job

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:15.530 
don't know what the job
making<00:02:14.549> process<00:02:14.909> does<00:02:15.120> is<00:02:15.330> it<00:02:15.420> basically

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
making process does is it basically

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.539 
making process does is it basically
modifies<00:02:16.319> a<00:02:16.349> few<00:02:16.680> files<00:02:16.920> within<00:02:17.280> your

00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:17.549 
modifies a few files within your

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:20.539 
modifies a few files within your
firmware<00:02:17.790> file<00:02:18.209> and<00:02:18.739> then<00:02:19.739> it<00:02:19.920> uploads<00:02:20.370> that

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:20.549 
firmware file and then it uploads that

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:25.039 
firmware file and then it uploads that
custom<00:02:21.000> firmware<00:02:21.420> into<00:02:21.780> your<00:02:22.280> device<00:02:24.049> alright

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:25.049 
custom firmware into your device alright

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:27.199 
custom firmware into your device alright
so<00:02:25.349> this<00:02:25.709> step<00:02:26.129> is<00:02:26.340> probably<00:02:26.790> going<00:02:26.909> to<00:02:26.970> take<00:02:27.150> a

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
so this step is probably going to take a

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.020 
so this step is probably going to take a
while<00:02:27.330> so<00:02:28.099> might<00:02:29.099> cut<00:02:29.340> the<00:02:29.459> video<00:02:29.549> short<00:02:29.970> for

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
while so might cut the video short for

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:35.089 
while so might cut the video short for
this<00:02:30.330> for<00:02:30.870> the<00:02:30.959> duration<00:02:31.230> here<00:02:31.760> and<00:02:33.890> you<00:02:34.890> have

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:35.099 
this for the duration here and you have

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:38.809 
this for the duration here and you have
an<00:02:35.280> iphone<00:02:35.579> 3gs<00:02:36.090> or<00:02:36.420> 3g<00:02:36.540> or<00:02:37.409> 3gs<00:02:37.489> contact<00:02:38.489> that

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
an iphone 3gs or 3g or 3gs contact that

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:40.520 
an iphone 3gs or 3g or 3gs contact that
you<00:02:38.970> would<00:02:39.120> not<00:02:39.329> activate<00:02:39.870> normally<00:02:40.260> through

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
you would not activate normally through

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.740 
you would not activate normally through
itunes<00:02:41.220> so<00:02:41.489> did<00:02:41.700> you<00:02:41.819> get<00:02:41.970> your<00:02:42.000> iPhone<00:02:42.450> from

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
itunes so did you get your iPhone from

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.280 
itunes so did you get your iPhone from
AT&amp;T<00:02:43.170> in<00:02:43.590> our<00:02:43.709> case<00:02:43.920> yes<00:02:44.190> we<00:02:44.489> did<00:02:44.640> so<00:02:45.450> we're

AT&amp;T in our case yes we did so we're

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.280 
AT&amp;T in our case yes we did so we're
going<00:02:46.379> to<00:02:46.500> hit<00:02:46.620> yes<00:02:48.019> it's<00:02:49.019> going<00:02:49.140> to<00:02:49.170> be

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
going to hit yes it's going to be

00:02:49.290 --> 00:03:02.589 
going to hit yes it's going to be
building<00:02:49.500> so<00:02:50.250> we'll<00:02:51.090> cut<00:02:51.269> out<00:02:51.390> right<00:02:51.569> now

00:03:02.589 --> 00:03:02.599 

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:06.470 

alright<00:03:03.599> so<00:03:04.140> it's<00:03:05.069> done<00:03:05.459> and<00:03:05.700> you'll<00:03:06.180> get<00:03:06.299> this

alright so it's done and you'll get this

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.559 
alright so it's done and you'll get this
message<00:03:06.859> and<00:03:07.859> ask<00:03:08.099> you<00:03:08.340> how's<00:03:08.640> your<00:03:08.790> iphone<00:03:09.120> 3g

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
unsure just click no and in our case it

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
unsure just click no and in our case it
actually<00:03:15.510> hasn't<00:03:16.049> been<00:03:16.379> so<00:03:16.680> no<00:03:18.200> alright<00:03:19.200> this

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
actually hasn't been so no alright this

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.640 
actually hasn't been so no alright this
step<00:03:20.280> teaches<00:03:20.700> you<00:03:20.849> how<00:03:21.030> to<00:03:21.090> put<00:03:21.450> the<00:03:21.959> device

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
step teaches you how to put the device

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.879 
step teaches you how to put the device
into<00:03:23.040> dfu<00:03:23.549> mode<00:03:23.630> dfu<00:03:24.630> mode<00:03:24.690> is<00:03:25.109> basically<00:03:25.650> the

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:25.889 
into dfu mode dfu mode is basically the

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:28.940 
into dfu mode dfu mode is basically the
mode<00:03:26.099> in<00:03:26.370> which<00:03:26.819> the<00:03:27.660> iphone<00:03:28.049> can<00:03:28.410> have<00:03:28.739> its

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
mode in which the iphone can have its

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.449 
mode in which the iphone can have its
firmware<00:03:29.220> changed<00:03:30.090> it's<00:03:30.810> called<00:03:30.989> device<00:03:31.919> file

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
firmware changed it's called device file

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:35.629 
firmware changed it's called device file
upload<00:03:33.060> something<00:03:33.540> like<00:03:33.780> that<00:03:33.989> forget<00:03:34.829> but<00:03:35.160> at

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:35.639 
upload something like that forget but at

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:36.920 
upload something like that forget but at
this<00:03:35.849> step<00:03:36.090> if<00:03:36.239> you<00:03:36.329> don't<00:03:36.510> if<00:03:36.690> you've<00:03:36.810> never

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
this step if you don't if you've never

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.869 
this step if you don't if you've never
done<00:03:37.139> this<00:03:37.260> before<00:03:37.440> I<00:03:37.889> suggest<00:03:38.459> you<00:03:38.519> watch<00:03:38.669> our

00:03:38.869 --> 00:03:38.879 
done this before I suggest you watch our

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:41.030 
done this before I suggest you watch our
video<00:03:39.150> on<00:03:39.389> how<00:03:39.599> to<00:03:39.629> put<00:03:39.930> your<00:03:40.079> device<00:03:40.290> into<00:03:40.500> dfu

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
video on how to put your device into dfu

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.970 
video on how to put your device into dfu
mode<00:03:41.069> and<00:03:41.750> but<00:03:42.750> if<00:03:43.169> you<00:03:43.410> think<00:03:43.590> you<00:03:43.680> can<00:03:43.799> get<00:03:43.859> it

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
mode and but if you think you can get it

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:45.439 
mode and but if you think you can get it
the<00:03:44.069> first<00:03:44.190> time<00:03:44.310> through<00:03:44.669> this<00:03:45.209> will<00:03:45.359> just

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:45.449 
the first time through this will just

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:46.789 
the first time through this will just
teacher<00:03:45.690> it's<00:03:45.900> pretty<00:03:46.109> it's<00:03:46.379> pretty<00:03:46.470> basic

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 
teacher it's pretty it's pretty basic

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:50.300 
teacher it's pretty it's pretty basic
process<00:03:47.010> I<00:03:48.440> won't<00:03:49.440> go<00:03:49.560> over<00:03:49.739> that<00:03:49.859> again<00:03:49.919> this

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
process I won't go over that again this

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.339 
process I won't go over that again this
time<00:03:50.489> around<00:03:50.639> so<00:03:51.449> I'm<00:03:51.900> just<00:03:52.019> going<00:03:52.139> to<00:03:52.199> go

00:03:52.339 --> 00:03:52.349 
time around so I'm just going to go

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:59.330 
time around so I'm just going to go
ahead<00:03:52.440> and<00:03:52.530> turn<00:03:52.739> my<00:03:52.949> device<00:03:53.220> off<00:03:58.250> taking<00:03:59.250> a

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
ahead and turn my device off taking a

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:25.659 
ahead and turn my device off taking a
while<00:03:59.489> holding
