is a lot better than that more expensive
to<00:00:29.060> this<00:00:30.060> was<00:00:31.880> twenty<00:00:32.960> twenty<00:00:33.960> two<00:00:34.110> dollars<00:00:34.410> i

think<00:00:34.710> at<00:00:34.829> toys<00:00:35.010> r<00:00:35.130> us<00:00:36.980> this<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.399> sword<00:00:38.700> comes

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969

in<00:00:39.120> red<00:00:39.420> and<00:00:39.750> this<00:00:40.230> color<00:00:40.500> i<00:00:40.620> think<00:00:40.920> that's<00:00:41.070> the

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
in red and this color i think that's the

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.020 
in red and this color i think that's the
only<00:00:41.280> color<00:00:41.610> it<00:00:41.820> comes<00:00:42.059> in<00:00:43.850> unlike<00:00:44.850> those

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.040 
other two a three for me swords that are
really<00:00:49.350> small<00:00:49.680> and<00:00:50.039> ours<00:00:50.340> because<00:00:50.579> it<00:00:50.760> is<00:00:51.050> this

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
really small and ours because it is this

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:59.209 
really small and ours because it is this
is<00:00:53.660> it's<00:00:54.660> hard<00:00:55.050> foam<00:00:55.350> inside<00:00:56.149> and<00:00:57.680> it's<00:00:58.680> part

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
is it's hard foam inside and it's part

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.849 
is it's hard foam inside and it's part
it's<00:00:59.579> got<00:01:00.030> some<00:01:00.270> sort<00:01:00.539> it's<00:01:00.719> like<00:01:00.960> covering

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
it's got some sort it's like covering

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.039 
it's got some sort it's like covering
some<00:01:02.160> sort<00:01:02.370> of<00:01:02.460> hardened<00:01:03.030> liquid<00:01:03.690> or

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
some sort of hardened liquid or

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.940 
some sort of hardened liquid or
something<00:01:04.500> like<00:01:04.589> that<00:01:04.650> that<00:01:05.010> hardens<00:01:05.930> so<00:01:06.950> it

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
something like that that hardens so it

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.450 
something like that that hardens so it
makes<00:01:08.250> it<00:01:08.460> even<00:01:08.729> more<00:01:09.770> hard<00:01:10.770> like<00:01:11.100> it<00:01:11.250> won't

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
makes it even more hard like it won't

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:17.800 
makes it even more hard like it won't
break<00:01:11.840> as<00:01:12.840> easily<00:01:14.570> and<00:01:15.570> ya<00:01:16.280> can't<00:01:17.280> really<00:01:17.460> do

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
break as easily and ya can't really do

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:27.130 
break as easily and ya can't really do
better<00:01:18.810> if<00:01:18.990> you<00:01:19.110> on<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.290> store<00:01:19.560> anyways<00:01:20.720> um<00:01:23.450> we
