00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:12.540
 good night that one that you are here that 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:15.299
 I want to say if I'm growing you this 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.520
 video of what vitamins are that 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.070
 amount right now because you need right now 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.210
 let's talk about what the notebook 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.210
 cleans collagen bbva 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:34.170
 good the collagen of youth 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.560
 the collagen is lost with the passing 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.080
 of time in a natural way 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:43.690
 so it is important to consume them 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:43.690
 The loss of collagen manifests itself in 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.830
 the wrinkles 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.640
 in what is the lack of activity 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:57.579
 fragile in fragility forgiveness of what 

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:59.969
 is the hair like that also when 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:00:59.969
 nail 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:05.979
 that you break in that is represented 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:11.190
 what is the lack of collagen in the 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:11.190
 ligaments also in the knees 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:16.710
 it is elasticity 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:20.380
 well then why is this important 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:22.930
 what are the elasticity in the skin 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:25.690
 that is the ease lost in the 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.310
 stretch and return to its natural form 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:30.750
 What are we doing right now? 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.750
 doing that at the moment 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.000
 we assume what we go up there is a 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.500
 stretch depending on greater weight 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.140
 for greater the style 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:44.640
 at the moment it is compact so that 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:47.220
 there is no flaccidity so that there is no 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.710
 in a way our skin badly because 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.060
 that's the importance of collagen for 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.630
 what 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.399
 together with the vitamin in the complex 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.149
 shape in a natural way our 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:02.610
 food as our tissues 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:06.360
 again have that firmness this 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:09.239
 compact and then our skin suffers what 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.959
 less possible because possibly if you 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.959
 there will be one 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:20.100
 not force our body but also 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:22.470
 we help them in a way 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:27.470
 with what is the collagen that the 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.470
 Collagen helps decrease what is 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:33.209
 so that the fat does not come out and 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:36.450
 do not have that orange- skinned look 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:38.160
 then if you no longer have the decreases and 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.770
 if you do not have it is also a constant 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.220
 because it helps you not so also the 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.220
 fading 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.120
 the ligaments the muscles 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.110
 7 help enormously 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:54.650
 I feel that collagen 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:57.970
 this is something like main right now 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.800
 because it's what we're working on the most 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.920
 and all that and that goes we're going down 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:05.250
 also that is going to go contacting not 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.250
 as well 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.909
 and it continued very good I am 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:10.050
 building I'm getting what 

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:13.680
 is 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:18.320
 this and what is the complex determines 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.320
 what am i saying is not expensive 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:27.950
 a thousand meters or 38 pesos depends fasts 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.950
 some also composed this school g 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:35.689
 38 pesos what in dollars are being 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:35.689
 equal 14 dollars 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.569
 So, well, I hope you liked it 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:43.409
 this 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:45.239
 of what vitamins are and then as 

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:48.910
 I tell you the important one in what it is 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:53.110
 our diet of fruits vegetables 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:55.860
 cereal proteins and also because no 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:59.080
 what are vitamin supplements 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:02.350
 to have as I tell you something 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:04.990
 complete is not to remove one or the other 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:07.690
 but help us and thus have energy 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:11.460
 take care of our skin our body give 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:13.830
 elasticity support so that 

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:16.830
 let's all go together towards what is 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:19.780
 our goal is to have our weight 

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:23.139
 ideal in a healthier way 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:25.900
 so that's good thanks for attention and
