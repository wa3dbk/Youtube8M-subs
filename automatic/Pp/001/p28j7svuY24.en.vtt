and they will rot out the bottom floor a
lot<00:00:58.530> of<00:00:58.620> people<00:00:58.829> don't<00:00:58.949> think<00:00:59.010> about<00:00:59.190> it

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489

I bought a dowel jig from Harbor Freight
which<00:05:03.740> mind<00:05:04.400> you<00:05:04.580> I<00:05:04.910> would<00:05:05.360> never<00:05:05.510> do<00:05:05.690> again

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:05.990 
which mind you I would never do again

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:09.340 
which mind you I would never do again
because<00:05:06.500> it<00:05:06.950> is<00:05:07.070> off<00:05:07.340> by<00:05:07.910> just<00:05:08.510> under<00:05:09.080> an

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:09.350 
because it is off by just under an

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:11.320 
because it is off by just under an
eighth<00:05:09.470> of<00:05:09.650> an<00:05:09.710> inch<00:05:09.890> on<00:05:10.190> all<00:05:10.310> the<00:05:10.490> lines<00:05:10.700> so<00:05:11.300> I

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:11.330 
eighth of an inch on all the lines so I

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.960 
eighth of an inch on all the lines so I
had<00:05:11.720> to<00:05:11.810> re<00:05:12.050> measure<00:05:12.560> all<00:05:12.920> the<00:05:13.070> lines<00:05:13.310> using<00:05:13.940> a

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:13.970 
had to re measure all the lines using a

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:16.170 
had to re measure all the lines using a
miter<00:05:14.180> and<00:05:14.450> now<00:05:15.080> that<00:05:15.260> I've<00:05:15.380> got<00:05:15.560> that

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:16.180 
miter and now that I've got that

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:19.240 
miter and now that I've got that
measured<00:05:17.180> properly<00:05:17.540> they<00:05:18.080> actually<00:05:18.590> drill

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:19.250 
measured properly they actually drill

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:21.460 
measured properly they actually drill
holes<00:05:19.520> properly<00:05:20.150> and<00:05:20.450> line<00:05:20.690> up<00:05:20.900> properly<00:05:21.080> like

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:21.470 
holes properly and line up properly like

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:24.280 
holes properly and line up properly like
they're<00:05:21.620> supposed<00:05:21.950> to<00:05:22.070> and<00:05:22.900> now<00:05:23.900> I<00:05:23.930> can

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:24.290 
they're supposed to and now I can

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:27.070 
they're supposed to and now I can
actually<00:05:24.470> use<00:05:24.860> it<00:05:25.100> to<00:05:25.130> build<00:05:25.820> this<00:05:26.000> is<00:05:26.300> that's

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:27.080 
actually use it to build this is that's

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:28.720 
actually use it to build this is that's
the<00:05:27.200> bigger<00:05:27.380> that<00:05:27.860> was<00:05:27.980> my<00:05:28.100> bigger<00:05:28.280> problem

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:28.730 
the bigger that was my bigger problem

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:31.830 
the bigger that was my bigger problem
you<00:05:29.660> know<00:05:29.750> was<00:05:29.930> that<00:05:29.960> I<00:05:30.110> could<00:05:30.410> not<00:05:30.620> drill

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:31.840 
you know was that I could not drill

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:34.810 
you know was that I could not drill
holes<00:05:32.840> to<00:05:33.050> do<00:05:33.170> dowling<00:05:33.620> so<00:05:34.310> that<00:05:34.430> I<00:05:34.460> could<00:05:34.640> hide

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:34.820 
holes to do dowling so that I could hide

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:36.940 
holes to do dowling so that I could hide
this<00:05:35.060> cut<00:05:35.300> I<00:05:35.510> didn't<00:05:35.840> want<00:05:35.990> to<00:05:36.050> do<00:05:36.200> you<00:05:36.830> know

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:36.950 
this cut I didn't want to do you know

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:38.320 
this cut I didn't want to do you know
the<00:05:37.040> Craig<00:05:37.250> jigs<00:05:37.580> where<00:05:37.820> you<00:05:37.910> would<00:05:38.030> see<00:05:38.210> the

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:38.330 
the Craig jigs where you would see the

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:40.270 
the Craig jigs where you would see the
screws<00:05:38.600> and<00:05:39.230> they<00:05:39.440> don't<00:05:39.620> make<00:05:39.740> moldings<00:05:40.160> that

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:40.280 
screws and they don't make moldings that

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:42.400 
screws and they don't make moldings that
cover<00:05:40.550> every<00:05:40.910> piece<00:05:41.120> of<00:05:41.360> this<00:05:41.480> and<00:05:41.810> the<00:05:42.260> right

cover every piece of this and the right

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:44.770 
cover every piece of this and the right
width<00:05:42.620> so<00:05:43.180> you<00:05:44.180> know<00:05:44.300> and<00:05:44.390> I<00:05:44.420> didn't<00:05:44.600> want<00:05:44.720> to

and there'll be a little cute little
cedar<00:05:57.650> door<00:05:57.920> that<00:05:58.130> flips<00:05:58.370> open<00:05:58.730> for<00:05:59.390> the

00:05:59.440 --> 00:05:59.450 
cedar door that flips open for the

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:01.480 
cedar door that flips open for the
pass-through<00:05:59.890> so<00:06:00.890> that<00:06:01.040> you<00:06:01.100> can<00:06:01.220> open<00:06:01.340> and

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:01.490 
pass-through so that you can open and

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:03.730 
pass-through so that you can open and
close<00:06:01.700> the<00:06:01.880> other<00:06:02.000> door<00:06:02.300> and<00:06:02.540> then<00:06:03.440> the<00:06:03.560> rest

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:03.740 
close the other door and then the rest

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:05.470 
close the other door and then the rest
of<00:06:03.830> this<00:06:03.920> is<00:06:04.070> all<00:06:04.190> going<00:06:04.310> to<00:06:04.400> be<00:06:04.520> screened<00:06:05.240> and

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:05.480 
of this is all going to be screened and

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:07.060 
of this is all going to be screened and
then<00:06:05.840> there's<00:06:05.990> a<00:06:06.050> kick<00:06:06.260> plate<00:06:06.530> that's<00:06:06.710> cedar

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:07.070 
then there's a kick plate that's cedar

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:09.850 
then there's a kick plate that's cedar
on<00:06:07.190> the<00:06:07.340> bottom<00:06:07.640> of<00:06:07.790> it<00:06:07.960> try<00:06:08.960> and<00:06:08.990> protect<00:06:09.350> the

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:09.860 
on the bottom of it try and protect the

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:11.590 
on the bottom of it try and protect the
bottom<00:06:10.010> under<00:06:10.310> the<00:06:10.430> door<00:06:10.580> and<00:06:10.760> keep<00:06:11.000> the<00:06:11.150> frame

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:11.600 
bottom under the door and keep the frame

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:15.760 
bottom under the door and keep the frame
relatively<00:06:12.590> square<00:06:13.720> this<00:06:14.720> where<00:06:15.020> is<00:06:15.170> what<00:06:15.650> I'm

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:15.770 
relatively square this where is what I'm

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:19.030 
relatively square this where is what I'm
capable<00:06:15.950> of<00:06:16.430> which<00:06:16.730> is<00:06:17.500> hit<00:06:18.500> or<00:06:18.620> miss<00:06:18.650> some

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:19.040 
capable of which is hit or miss some

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:22.690 
capable of which is hit or miss some
days<00:06:19.220> I<00:06:19.520> don't<00:06:19.580> know<00:06:20.140> but<00:06:21.250> I'm<00:06:22.250> doing<00:06:22.520> the<00:06:22.580> best

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:22.700 
days I don't know but I'm doing the best

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:25.330 
days I don't know but I'm doing the best
I<00:06:22.880> can<00:06:22.910> I<00:06:23.090> guess<00:06:23.330> with<00:06:23.570> what<00:06:23.600> I<00:06:23.720> got<00:06:23.900> so<00:06:24.340> that's

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:25.340 
I can I guess with what I got so that's

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:27.070 
I can I guess with what I got so that's
where<00:06:25.580> I'm<00:06:25.669> at<00:06:25.760> having<00:06:26.270> one<00:06:26.480> for<00:06:26.750> the<00:06:26.840> floor

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:27.080 
where I'm at having one for the floor

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:29.040 
where I'm at having one for the floor
I'm<00:06:27.440> just<00:06:27.650> going<00:06:27.770> to<00:06:27.800> finish<00:06:27.980> that<00:06:28.280> up

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:29.050 
I'm just going to finish that up

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:32.879 
I'm just going to finish that up
and<00:06:30.120> that's<00:06:31.120> the<00:06:31.330> update<00:06:31.449> I<00:06:31.930> guess<00:06:32.560> I<00:06:32.740> haven't

00:06:32.879 --> 00:06:32.889 
and that's the update I guess I haven't

00:06:32.889 --> 00:06:35.730 
and that's the update I guess I haven't
other<00:06:33.490> than<00:06:33.729> I<00:06:33.970> need<00:06:34.300> I<00:06:34.599> need<00:06:35.259> to<00:06:35.349> get<00:06:35.440> hold<00:06:35.650> of

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:35.740 
other than I need I need to get hold of

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:38.309 
other than I need I need to get hold of
somebody<00:06:35.949> who<00:06:36.250> knows<00:06:36.460> how<00:06:36.639> to<00:06:36.699> copper<00:06:37.690> flaring

00:06:38.309 --> 00:06:38.319 
somebody who knows how to copper flaring

00:06:38.319 --> 00:06:40.890 
somebody who knows how to copper flaring
because<00:06:38.590> I<00:06:38.830> can't<00:06:39.520> do<00:06:39.789> it<00:06:39.970> it's<00:06:40.120> obvious<00:06:40.629> I

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:40.900 
because I can't do it it's obvious I

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:43.559 
because I can't do it it's obvious I
tested<00:06:41.860> it<00:06:41.949> at<00:06:42.340> least<00:06:42.580> like<00:06:42.849> sieve<00:06:43.210> all<00:06:43.449> the

00:06:43.559 --> 00:06:43.569 
tested it at least like sieve all the

00:06:43.569 --> 00:06:45.029 
tested it at least like sieve all the
fittings<00:06:43.900> I<00:06:44.050> did<00:06:44.259> leak<00:06:44.470> like<00:06:44.650> a<00:06:44.710> sieve<00:06:44.979> a

00:06:45.029 --> 00:06:45.039 
fittings I did leak like a sieve a

00:06:45.039 --> 00:06:49.529 
fittings I did leak like a sieve a
separate<00:06:45.490> one<00:06:45.659> so<00:06:46.659> I<00:06:47.789> put<00:06:48.789> feelers<00:06:49.000> out<00:06:49.330> we'll

00:06:49.529 --> 00:06:49.539 
separate one so I put feelers out we'll

00:06:49.539 --> 00:06:50.999 
separate one so I put feelers out we'll
see<00:06:49.720> what<00:06:49.870> happens<00:06:50.229> hopefully<00:06:50.680> I'll<00:06:50.770> find

00:06:50.999 --> 00:06:51.009 
see what happens hopefully I'll find

00:06:51.009 --> 00:06:52.230 
see what happens hopefully I'll find
somebody<00:06:51.220> they<00:06:51.520> can<00:06:51.580> do<00:06:51.789> that<00:06:52.000> in<00:06:52.180> the

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:52.240 
somebody they can do that in the

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:53.610 
somebody they can do that in the
meantime<00:06:52.419> I'm<00:06:52.840> just<00:06:52.870> gonna<00:06:53.110> keep<00:06:53.289> plugging

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:53.620 
meantime I'm just gonna keep plugging

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:55.379 
meantime I'm just gonna keep plugging
along<00:06:53.710> until<00:06:54.129> she's<00:06:54.310> done<00:06:54.490> but<00:06:55.150> here's<00:06:55.360> my

00:06:55.379 --> 00:06:55.389 
along until she's done but here's my

00:06:55.389 --> 00:06:59.190 
along until she's done but here's my
update<00:06:55.780> thanks<00:06:56.680> for<00:06:56.710> tuning<00:06:56.949> in
