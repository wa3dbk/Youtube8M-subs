00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:06.130
 hello that such friends otakus today I come to you 

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:09.820
 to bring information that is not going to 

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:12.070
 Like as good as a month ago 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:15.130
 we were excited about the return from 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:16.540
 unam and in Latin America it seems that everything 

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:20.500
 it was going to be lost but it's still not 

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:23.860
 safe and good and when this campaign 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:26.470
 was made and banderalÃ³ of facebook 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:28.980
 the official campaign began to create 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:31.230
 a fake page 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.450
 for that reason the original page 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.400
 of the Latin America campaign that was going 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.840
 directed as administrator on facebook 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.930
 by 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.840
 jesus guadalupe sandoval I took care of 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.030
 of in that campaign make the group the 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.040
 group on facebook was commissioned to make it 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:51.210
 to be one of the administrator of the 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:53.579
 good page turner and how we know that 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:57.089
 the cartoon network company 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:01:00.989
 I believe that together with cnn cartoon the war 

00:00:57.089 --> 00:01:03.479
 Latin America had tried to have already 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:07.130
 a quantity of law of the ics that of likes 

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:10.310
 that were 38 thousand good through that 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:12.350
 for creating false page 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.899
 I can create makes fake pages of this 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.700
 campaign of a friend team or america to nm 

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:20.960
 TV anime manga and television decided 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:22.700
 close this page since it was the one that 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.039
 main organizer of this infant 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.990
 I was going to have problems with turns because 

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:28.970
 because there were some pages that were not the 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.549
 officers for this campaign were 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.200
 being created also surely many 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:36.220
 they are wondering the reason for the 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:40.759
 elimination of page 1 for that but 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:42.619
 I know the guy who took care of 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:44.270
 do this because I was the group of 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:45.870
 shot of Latin America that he had in 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.660
 Facebook 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:51.870
 I approved it in not knowing that he was 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:54.450
 he the owner of that easy page of those 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:56.880
 false pages and he put there he started to 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.320
 put that he was the creator of that 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.990
 page what do you want to achieve 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:04.350
 it was more lie and that's definitely a 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:06.060
 act of brutality so that to us to 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.700
 Latin Americans I continue to grant 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.410
 in that case because if it 's in a 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.150
 campaign of the same team or america for 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.190
 that comes because we have to create another 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.720
 if it is the original and the one that was not going to 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.220
 bring the channel back because we 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.380
 we have to put to create another while 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.360
 that we are taking away like the other 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:24.000
 official page that's an act of all 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:26.010
 the whole anyway I already know 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.160
 already the results were sent to 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:31.080
 cartoon network I do not know if the same 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.400
 go back as much as possible is that no 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.770
 for these kinds of things that are 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.290
 presented here in our region 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:40.650
 Latin America unfortunately good as 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.990
 I told them and here I am going to show them is 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.060
 the first time I have radio they give so much 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:46.730
 rage against a subject especially here 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:51.300
 we have it 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:54.480
 let's finish sandoval guadalupe that was 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:56.700
 I even say a manucho and if the boys 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:00.810
 says the other page of your ship because 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:02.880
 his started asking for 30 380 thousand light with 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:06.150
 that many people find an impossible 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:08.040
 here is your also Latin America 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:11.730
 that's not the real one do not support me but 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:14.310
 when we have more than 30,000 nm 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:17.310
 that is an expense of all brutality it 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:21.210
 assumes that if it is endorsed the page 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:22.770
 the official page so that you create another if 

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:24.480
 they want to join the conversation of 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:26.730
 these pages and that can be searched 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.680
 this of the trial group the one that was of a 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:32.820
 melate in america de unam and in 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:36.450
 Latin America group and I direct it I am and 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:39.810
 my son reads less than on youtube and 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:41.790
 the creator of the official page of this 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.850
 campaign was jesus guadalupe sandoval that 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:47.400
 was made by a nm tv anime brand and 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:49.350
 television but it seems that everything has fallen 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:53.310
 and it seems that your friendship will not return 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:55.260
 I show everything he does on facebook and 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.209
 everything supremely 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:00.120
 like this with this guy who starts 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:03.810
 make these pages to take away the 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:06.209
 likes what he did was make things worse 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:08.220
 so I'm going to let you read the link in 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:10.020
 the description of this guy and I'm going to 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.910
 leave the link of the page so that the 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:14.250
 report because what he did was damage 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:17.400
 all our dreams of what I had 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:19.709
 what to do with a good Latin America honey 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:22.410
 Citizen friends I hope it's good 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:24.630
 I hope this information will not have them 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:27.300
 liked because this information does not 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:31.400
 pleases in nothing simply so that 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:32.940
 know and that kind of thing 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:35.600
 good 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.600
 goodbye
