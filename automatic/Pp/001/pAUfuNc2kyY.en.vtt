unfamiliar with the term a ninja track
is<00:00:15.420> similar<00:00:15.990> to<00:00:16.199> an<00:00:16.320> extreme<00:00:16.710> track<00:00:17.010> but<00:00:17.580> even

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
is similar to an extreme track but even

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.540 
is similar to an extreme track but even
more<00:00:18.390> difficult<00:00:19.109> the<00:00:19.590> term<00:00:19.859> originates<00:00:20.430> from

more difficult the term originates from

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.040 
more difficult the term originates from
the<00:00:20.820> track<00:00:21.029> central<00:00:21.449> builders<00:00:21.779> who<00:00:21.930> were

the track central builders who were

the track central builders who were
making<00:00:22.230> tracks<00:00:22.710> that<00:00:22.920> were<00:00:23.100> even<00:00:23.820> harder<00:00:24.150> than

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330

making tracks that were even harder than
extreme<00:00:24.720> tracks<00:00:25.019> and<00:00:25.260> needed<00:00:25.470> something<00:00:25.800> to

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
extreme tracks and needed something to

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.679 
extreme tracks and needed something to
call<00:00:26.160> them<00:00:26.340> so<00:00:26.820> they<00:00:26.939> named<00:00:27.119> them<00:00:27.300> ninja

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
call them so they named them ninja

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.019 
call them so they named them ninja
tracks<00:00:27.990> and<00:00:28.349> they're<00:00:28.949> also<00:00:29.099> usually<00:00:29.429> tiered

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
tracks and they're also usually tiered

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.820 
tracks and they're also usually tiered
from<00:00:30.330> like<00:00:30.510> 1<00:00:30.779> to<00:00:30.960> 6<00:00:31.260> depending<00:00:31.439> on<00:00:31.710> how

them<00:00:38.700> and<00:00:38.940> then<00:00:39.540> there's<00:00:40.050> obviously<00:00:40.230> some

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
them and then there's obviously some

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.880 
them and then there's obviously some
easier<00:00:41.610> variants<00:00:42.090> as<00:00:42.210> well<00:00:42.270> so<00:00:43.260> if<00:00:43.500> you're<00:00:43.680> not

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
easier variants as well so if you're not

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.279 
easier variants as well so if you're not

order to make it way harder and it is a

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.499 
order to make it way harder and it is a

faults<00:01:47.340> i<00:01:47.520> get<00:01:48.149> three<00:01:48.479> hundred<00:01:48.750> and<00:01:49.140> fifteen

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
faults i get three hundred and fifteen

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.730

faults<00:01:50.520> on<00:01:50.700> this<00:01:51.030> run<00:01:51.689> and<00:01:52.020> this<00:01:52.140> is<00:01:52.320> actually

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
faults on this run and this is actually

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.760 
faults on this run and this is actually
my<00:01:52.950> second<00:01:53.759> time<00:01:53.820> going<00:01:54.810> through<00:01:54.960> this<00:01:55.409> map

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
my second time going through this map

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.130 
my second time going through this map
now<00:01:56.520> to<00:01:57.060> put<00:01:57.240> that<00:01:57.390> into<00:01:57.540> a<00:01:57.659> little<00:01:57.930> bit<00:01:58.049> of

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
now to put that into a little bit of

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.069 
now to put that into a little bit of
perspective<00:01:58.469> I<00:01:59.100> did<00:01:59.640> Inferno<00:02:00.180> four<00:02:00.540> in<00:02:00.810> two

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
perspective I did Inferno four in two

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.469 
perspective I did Inferno four in two
hundred<00:02:01.229> faults<00:02:01.649> on<00:02:01.860> my<00:02:02.009> first<00:02:02.280> try<00:02:02.640> and<00:02:02.939> got<00:02:03.450> a

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
hundred faults on my first try and got a

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.230 
hundred faults on my first try and got a
gold<00:02:03.869> medal<00:02:04.229> at<00:02:04.380> forty<00:02:04.770> five<00:02:05.009> faults<00:02:05.579> on<00:02:05.729> my

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
gold medal at forty five faults on my

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.540 
gold medal at forty five faults on my
second<00:02:06.689> try<00:02:06.899> so<00:02:07.530> this<00:02:07.710> is<00:02:07.890> much<00:02:08.280> more

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
second try so this is much more

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:09.880 
second try so this is much more
difficult<00:02:09.060> than<00:02:09.119> even<00:02:09.539> in

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
difficult than even in

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.370 
difficult than even in
for<00:02:10.369> so<00:02:10.910> unless<00:02:11.360> you're<00:02:11.570> a<00:02:11.600> super<00:02:11.960> experienced

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
for so unless you're a super experienced

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.100 
for so unless you're a super experienced

time with the trial series I consider

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.890 
time with the trial series I consider
myself<00:02:27.190> decent<00:02:28.190> at<00:02:28.310> the<00:02:28.460> game<00:02:28.670> you<00:02:29.510> can<00:02:29.690> try

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
myself decent at the game you can try

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.810 
myself decent at the game you can try
this<00:02:29.960> they're<00:02:30.440> very<00:02:30.800> very<00:02:31.010> challenging<00:02:31.340> and

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
this they're very very challenging and

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:33.880 
this they're very very challenging and
as<00:02:31.910> you<00:02:32.090> see<00:02:32.270> here<00:02:32.540> they<00:02:32.750> do<00:02:32.810> involve<00:02:33.440> special

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
as you see here they do involve special

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.310 
as you see here they do involve special
ninja<00:02:34.370> tricks<00:02:34.670> that<00:02:34.880> a<00:02:34.910> lot<00:02:35.240> of<00:02:35.510> the<00:02:35.690> maps<00:02:35.959> in

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 
ninja tricks that a lot of the maps in

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.580 
ninja tricks that a lot of the maps in
the<00:02:36.860> regular<00:02:37.310> game<00:02:37.550> don't<00:02:38.380> necessarily<00:02:39.380> need

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
the regular game don't necessarily need

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.290 
the regular game don't necessarily need
now<00:02:40.220> you<00:02:40.280> might<00:02:40.730> be<00:02:40.760> wondering<00:02:40.850> what<00:02:41.270> are

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 
now you might be wondering what are

now you might be wondering what are
these<00:02:41.450> ninja<00:02:41.780> tricks<00:02:42.020> I'm<00:02:42.170> speaking<00:02:42.590> of

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709 
these ninja tricks I'm speaking of

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:44.770 
these ninja tricks I'm speaking of
you'll<00:02:43.130> see<00:02:43.400> me<00:02:43.550> do<00:02:43.670> them<00:02:43.850> a<00:02:43.970> few<00:02:44.180> times<00:02:44.360> here

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
you'll see me do them a few times here

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.590 
you'll see me do them a few times here
one<00:02:45.770> of<00:02:45.920> them<00:02:46.070> involves<00:02:46.760> getting<00:02:46.940> your<00:02:47.120> front

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
one of them involves getting your front

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.470 
one of them involves getting your front
wheel<00:02:47.780> onto<00:02:48.020> an<00:02:48.290> obstacle<00:02:48.709> and<00:02:49.070> then<00:02:49.610> spinning

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
wheel onto an obstacle and then spinning

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.240 
wheel onto an obstacle and then spinning
up<00:02:50.600> your<00:02:50.750> back<00:02:50.900> wheel<00:02:51.170> to<00:02:51.440> lift<00:02:51.739> up<00:02:51.950> your<00:02:51.980> back

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
up your back wheel to lift up your back

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.280 
up your back wheel to lift up your back
wheel<00:02:52.520> towards<00:02:53.090> you<00:02:53.239> so<00:02:53.720> I<00:02:53.750> think<00:02:53.900> you'll<00:02:54.260> see

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
wheel towards you so I think you'll see

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:55.990 
wheel towards you so I think you'll see
me<00:02:54.680> do<00:02:54.830> it<00:02:54.980> right<00:02:55.190> here<00:02:55.430> although<00:02:55.610> I<00:02:55.760> do<00:02:55.880> a

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
me do it right here although I do a

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.470 
me do it right here although I do a
pretty<00:02:56.360> small<00:02:56.720> version<00:02:57.200> of<00:02:57.290> it<00:02:57.470> so<00:02:58.239> no<00:02:59.239> not

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
pretty small version of it so no not

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.650 
pretty small version of it so no not
quite<00:02:59.780> but<00:03:00.580> that's<00:03:01.580> one<00:03:01.850> of<00:03:01.970> them<00:03:02.090> another<00:03:02.420> one

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
quite but that's one of them another one

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.180 
quite but that's one of them another one
of<00:03:02.810> them<00:03:02.930> you'll<00:03:03.110> see<00:03:03.170> me<00:03:03.380> do<00:03:03.500> twice<00:03:03.770> in<00:03:04.040> this

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
of them you'll see me do twice in this

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.100 
of them you'll see me do twice in this
run<00:03:04.430> it's<00:03:04.790> when<00:03:05.300> you<00:03:05.420> do<00:03:05.570> kind<00:03:05.840> of<00:03:05.900> like<00:03:06.020> a

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.110 
run it's when you do kind of like a

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:07.900 
run it's when you do kind of like a
front<00:03:06.410> flip<00:03:06.590> and<00:03:06.709> get<00:03:07.040> your<00:03:07.190> back<00:03:07.489> wheel

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
front flip and get your back wheel

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:11.199 
front flip and get your back wheel
hooked<00:03:08.480> onto<00:03:08.840> an<00:03:09.560> obstacle<00:03:10.190> and<00:03:10.520> then<00:03:10.940> you<00:03:11.060> can

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
hooked onto an obstacle and then you can

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:13.120 
hooked onto an obstacle and then you can
bring<00:03:11.420> yourself<00:03:11.570> kind<00:03:12.170> of<00:03:12.290> up<00:03:12.500> and<00:03:12.709> around

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.130 
bring yourself kind of up and around

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:14.890 
bring yourself kind of up and around
you'll<00:03:13.670> see<00:03:13.730> me<00:03:13.970> do<00:03:14.090> it<00:03:14.180> on<00:03:14.239> the<00:03:14.390> last<00:03:14.600> obstacle

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
you'll see me do it on the last obstacle

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.810 
you'll see me do it on the last obstacle
and<00:03:15.410> you<00:03:15.500> saw<00:03:15.680> me<00:03:15.830> do<00:03:15.980> it<00:03:16.130> on<00:03:16.220> one<00:03:16.519> of<00:03:16.670> the

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:16.820 
and you saw me do it on one of the

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:18.490 
and you saw me do it on one of the
middle<00:03:17.060> obstacle<00:03:17.480> I<00:03:17.600> think<00:03:17.810> around<00:03:18.019> fall<00:03:18.350> to

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
middle obstacle I think around fall to

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.259 
middle obstacle I think around fall to
15<00:03:18.950> is<00:03:19.190> when<00:03:19.310> I<00:03:19.370> did<00:03:19.459> it<00:03:19.549> for<00:03:19.760> the<00:03:19.820> first<00:03:19.970> time

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:20.269 
15 is when I did it for the first time

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:23.350 
15 is when I did it for the first time
that's<00:03:21.110> just<00:03:21.380> two<00:03:21.739> of<00:03:21.769> the<00:03:22.310> ninja<00:03:22.970> tricks<00:03:23.209> that

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:23.360 
that's just two of the ninja tricks that

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:24.820 
that's just two of the ninja tricks that
you<00:03:23.480> will<00:03:23.660> need<00:03:23.900> to<00:03:24.080> complete<00:03:24.470> some<00:03:24.620> of<00:03:24.650> these

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:24.830 
you will need to complete some of these

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:27.280 
you will need to complete some of these
maps<00:03:25.100> now<00:03:25.820> there's<00:03:26.060> also<00:03:26.330> some<00:03:26.750> really<00:03:26.780> really

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
maps now there's also some really really

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.740 
maps now there's also some really really
advanced<00:03:27.799> throttling<00:03:28.700> techniques<00:03:29.299> as<00:03:29.570> well

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:29.750 
advanced throttling techniques as well

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:31.630 
advanced throttling techniques as well
as<00:03:29.959> like<00:03:30.230> wheelie<00:03:30.620> and<00:03:30.830> leaning<00:03:31.190> techniques

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:31.640 
as like wheelie and leaning techniques

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.759 
as like wheelie and leaning techniques
you'll<00:03:32.239> see<00:03:32.480> one<00:03:32.660> coming<00:03:32.930> up<00:03:33.140> after<00:03:33.320> this

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:33.769 
you'll see one coming up after this

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:35.530 
you'll see one coming up after this
checkpoint<00:03:34.070> you<00:03:34.370> have<00:03:34.580> to<00:03:34.730> get<00:03:34.940> onto<00:03:35.090> the<00:03:35.330> log

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540 
checkpoint you have to get onto the log

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.330 
checkpoint you have to get onto the log
in<00:03:35.720> front<00:03:36.019> of<00:03:36.110> me<00:03:36.230> and<00:03:36.560> then<00:03:36.920> you<00:03:36.980> have<00:03:37.130> to<00:03:37.220> do

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
in front of me and then you have to do

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:38.979 
in front of me and then you have to do
like<00:03:37.489> this<00:03:37.670> small<00:03:37.940> bunnyhop<00:03:38.480> onto<00:03:38.870> these

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:38.989 
like this small bunnyhop onto these

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:41.770 
like this small bunnyhop onto these
crates<00:03:39.470> and<00:03:39.709> it<00:03:40.190> involves<00:03:40.700> a<00:03:40.880> lot<00:03:40.910> of<00:03:41.209> throttle

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
crates and it involves a lot of throttle

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.740 
crates and it involves a lot of throttle
and<00:03:42.110> a<00:03:42.230> lot<00:03:42.500> of<00:03:42.530> leaning<00:03:43.100> control<00:03:43.600> this<00:03:44.600> is

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
and a lot of leaning control this is

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:47.080 
and a lot of leaning control this is
really<00:03:45.080> not<00:03:45.260> for<00:03:45.590> on<00:03:45.680> inexperienced<00:03:46.610> riders

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
really not for on inexperienced riders

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.840 
really not for on inexperienced riders
now<00:03:47.750> I<00:03:48.170> believe<00:03:48.920> there<00:03:49.190> is<00:03:49.220> five<00:03:49.580> of<00:03:49.610> them

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:49.850 
now I believe there is five of them

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:51.970 
now I believe there is five of them
there's<00:03:50.269> very<00:03:50.690> little<00:03:50.989> information<00:03:51.530> about

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
there's very little information about

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:53.590 
there's very little information about
this<00:03:52.280> because<00:03:52.519> there's<00:03:52.700> honestly<00:03:53.299> not<00:03:53.540> that

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:53.600 
this because there's honestly not that

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.720 
this because there's honestly not that
many<00:03:54.170> people<00:03:54.440> who<00:03:54.769> are<00:03:54.799> good<00:03:55.130> enough<00:03:55.400> to<00:03:55.580> be

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730 
many people who are good enough to be

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:57.580 
many people who are good enough to be
able<00:03:55.820> to<00:03:56.030> be<00:03:56.150> getting<00:03:56.480> 0<00:03:56.510> fault<00:03:57.049> runs<00:03:57.320> on

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
able to be getting 0 fault runs on

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:01.570 
able to be getting 0 fault runs on
extreme<00:03:58.190> tracks<00:03:59.019> but<00:04:00.019> as<00:04:00.230> I<00:04:00.500> understand<00:04:01.220> there

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:01.580 
extreme tracks but as I understand there

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:04.900 
extreme tracks but as I understand there
is<00:04:01.760> a<00:04:02.060> ninja<00:04:02.540> variant<00:04:03.260> of<00:04:03.440> all<00:04:03.890> five<00:04:04.340> of<00:04:04.370> the

extreme maps available in the game this

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:08.870 
is eye of the storm

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:10.870 
is eye of the storm
now<00:04:09.290> I'm<00:04:09.500> not<00:04:09.739> unfortunately<00:04:10.160> good<00:04:10.519> enough<00:04:10.730> to

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:10.880 
now I'm not unfortunately good enough to

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.259 
now I'm not unfortunately good enough to

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:13.269 
get it on Rock of Ages like city-run

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:16.129 
get it on Rock of Ages like city-run

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
that is escaping me currently I have all

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.920 
that is escaping me currently I have all
of<00:04:19.199> the<00:04:19.379> maps<00:04:19.680> done<00:04:20.009> in<00:04:20.219> about<00:04:20.699> ten<00:04:21.180> faults<00:04:21.749> but

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
of the maps done in about ten faults but

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.559 
of the maps done in about ten faults but
I'm<00:04:22.109> pretty<00:04:22.949> much<00:04:23.189> a<00:04:23.490> far<00:04:23.789> away<00:04:23.999> from<00:04:24.060> getting

00:04:24.559 --> 00:04:24.569 
I'm pretty much a far away from getting

00:04:24.569 --> 00:04:26.239 
I'm pretty much a far away from getting
pretty<00:04:24.930> far<00:04:25.169> away<00:04:25.259> from<00:04:25.379> getting<00:04:25.740> zero<00:04:25.919> faults

00:04:26.239 --> 00:04:26.249 
pretty far away from getting zero faults

00:04:26.249 --> 00:04:28.369 
pretty far away from getting zero faults
on<00:04:26.340> some<00:04:26.490> of<00:04:26.580> the<00:04:26.639> remaining<00:04:26.999> tracks<00:04:27.240> now<00:04:28.080> as

00:04:28.369 --> 00:04:28.379 
on some of the remaining tracks now as

00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:30.260 
on some of the remaining tracks now as
you<00:04:28.620> see<00:04:28.830> here<00:04:29.099> I'm<00:04:29.340> at<00:04:29.639> the<00:04:29.759> last<00:04:29.969> checkpoint

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
you see here I'm at the last checkpoint

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:34.309 
you see here I'm at the last checkpoint
now<00:04:30.719> and<00:04:30.990> I'm<00:04:31.080> only<00:04:31.229> at<00:04:31.409> fifty<00:04:31.889> six<00:04:33.080> faults<00:04:34.080> now

00:04:34.309 --> 00:04:34.319 
now and I'm only at fifty six faults now

00:04:34.319 --> 00:04:36.409 
now and I'm only at fifty six faults now
unfortunately<00:04:34.740> this<00:04:35.159> one<00:04:35.370> took<00:04:35.550> me<00:04:35.729> over<00:04:35.849> 200

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:36.419 
unfortunately this one took me over 200

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:38.390 
unfortunately this one took me over 200
faults<00:04:36.689> and<00:04:36.870> I<00:04:36.960> don't<00:04:37.020> I<00:04:37.289> will<00:04:37.499> actually<00:04:37.710> do

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400 
faults and I don't I will actually do

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.119 
faults and I don't I will actually do
not<00:04:38.610> remember<00:04:38.969> the<00:04:39.689> last<00:04:39.930> obstacle<00:04:40.379> that<00:04:40.860> took

00:04:41.119 --> 00:04:41.129 
not remember the last obstacle that took

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:42.769 
not remember the last obstacle that took
me<00:04:41.279> two<00:04:41.400> hundred<00:04:41.520> faults<00:04:41.879> it<00:04:42.360> was<00:04:42.479> probably

00:04:42.769 --> 00:04:42.779 
me two hundred faults it was probably

00:04:42.779 --> 00:04:46.760 
me two hundred faults it was probably
all<00:04:42.930> the<00:04:43.050> way<00:04:43.169> back<00:04:43.439> in<00:04:43.770> like<00:04:44.069> Trials<00:04:44.550> HD<00:04:45.770> so

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:46.770 
all the way back in like Trials HD so

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:48.619 
all the way back in like Trials HD so
yeah<00:04:47.069> this<00:04:47.370> is<00:04:47.430> quite<00:04:47.969> difficult<00:04:48.180> this<00:04:48.569> is

00:04:48.619 --> 00:04:48.629 
yeah this is quite difficult this is

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:51.740 
yeah this is quite difficult this is
another<00:04:49.020> ninja<00:04:49.439> trick<00:04:49.710> and<00:04:50.120> one<00:04:51.120> thing<00:04:51.389> I<00:04:51.539> want

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:51.750 
another ninja trick and one thing I want

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:53.990 
another ninja trick and one thing I want
to<00:04:51.840> mention<00:04:51.960> to<00:04:52.379> you<00:04:52.469> guys<00:04:52.529> before<00:04:53.069> you<00:04:53.669> try

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 
to mention to you guys before you try

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.589 
to mention to you guys before you try
this<00:04:54.029> this<00:04:55.020> will<00:04:55.529> overwrite<00:04:56.490> your

00:04:56.589 --> 00:04:56.599 
this this will overwrite your

00:04:56.599 --> 00:04:59.360 
this this will overwrite your
leaderboard<00:04:57.599> position<00:04:58.439> so<00:04:58.979> if<00:04:59.129> you<00:04:59.219> have<00:04:59.310> a

00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.370 
leaderboard position so if you have a

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:02.089 
leaderboard position so if you have a
really<00:04:59.759> good<00:05:00.000> 0<00:05:00.509> fault<00:05:00.870> leaderboard<00:05:01.469> time<00:05:01.800> and

00:05:02.089 --> 00:05:02.099 
really good 0 fault leaderboard time and

00:05:02.099 --> 00:05:04.339 
really good 0 fault leaderboard time and
then<00:05:02.520> you<00:05:02.610> do<00:05:02.759> something<00:05:03.060> like<00:05:03.210> this<00:05:03.479> it<00:05:03.930> will

00:05:04.339 --> 00:05:04.349 
then you do something like this it will

00:05:04.349 --> 00:05:06.709 
then you do something like this it will
override<00:05:04.979> your<00:05:05.189> position<00:05:05.669> so<00:05:06.120> unfortunately

00:05:06.709 --> 00:05:06.719 
override your position so unfortunately

00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:08.779 
override your position so unfortunately
for<00:05:06.900> me<00:05:07.020> I<00:05:07.229> had<00:05:07.439> a<00:05:07.469> 0<00:05:07.800> fault<00:05:08.099> Platinum<00:05:08.490> run<00:05:08.639> in

00:05:08.779 --> 00:05:08.789 
for me I had a 0 fault Platinum run in

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:11.240 
for me I had a 0 fault Platinum run in
the<00:05:08.879> top<00:05:09.089> like<00:05:09.300> hundred<00:05:09.750> and<00:05:09.900> it<00:05:10.620> overrode<00:05:11.219> it

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:11.250 
the top like hundred and it overrode it

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:13.279 
the top like hundred and it overrode it
and<00:05:11.550> I<00:05:11.639> was<00:05:11.819> basically<00:05:12.270> I<00:05:12.389> got<00:05:12.629> a<00:05:12.689> bronze<00:05:12.990> medal

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:13.289 
and I was basically I got a bronze medal

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:16.279 
and I was basically I got a bronze medal
with<00:05:13.639> 315<00:05:14.639> faults<00:05:15.029> so<00:05:15.599> you<00:05:15.689> want<00:05:15.839> to<00:05:15.930> watch<00:05:16.050> out

00:05:16.279 --> 00:05:16.289 
with 315 faults so you want to watch out
