00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
Cup but to be honest with with you this

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.140 
Cup but to be honest with with you this
is<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:37.590> first<00:01:37.890> time<00:01:38.100> where<00:01:38.280> I<00:01:38.310> feel<00:01:38.579> like<00:01:38.640> it

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
is the first time where I feel like it

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.030 
is the first time where I feel like it
doesn't<00:01:39.540> matter<00:01:39.750> kind<00:01:40.200> of<00:01:40.290> like<00:01:40.439> in<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.829> mix

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
doesn't matter kind of like in the mix

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.440 
doesn't matter kind of like in the mix
that<00:01:41.189> we<00:01:41.280> have<00:01:41.430> right<00:01:41.579> now<00:01:41.640> doesn't<00:01:42.390> matter

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
that we have right now doesn't matter

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.600 
that we have right now doesn't matter
who<00:01:42.780> we<00:01:42.930> take<00:01:43.170> I<00:01:43.380> feel<00:01:43.560> like<00:01:43.710> any<00:01:43.979> one<00:01:44.399> of<00:01:44.430> those

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
who we take I feel like any one of those

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.880 
who we take I feel like any one of those
one<00:01:44.880> players<00:01:45.210> can<00:01:45.570> fill<00:01:45.810> that<00:01:45.840> slot<00:01:46.140> since

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
one players can fill that slot since

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.370 
one players can fill that slot since
2007<00:01:47.880> there's<00:01:48.240> been<00:01:48.420> a<00:01:48.450> core<00:01:48.750> group<00:01:48.930> of<00:01:49.140> about

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
2007 there's been a core group of about

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.800 
2007 there's been a core group of about
30<00:01:49.439> athletes<00:01:49.979> who<00:01:50.490> make<00:01:50.520> up<00:01:50.850> this<00:01:50.970> team<00:01:51.270> but

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
30 athletes who make up this team but

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.069 
30 athletes who make up this team but
not<00:01:51.990> all<00:01:52.229> of<00:01:52.409> them<00:01:52.560> will<00:01:52.799> go<00:01:52.950> to<00:01:53.009> the<00:01:53.250> World<00:01:53.399> Cup

not all of them will go to the World Cup
Barbara<00:01:55.079> Mervin<00:01:55.380> was<00:01:55.619> in<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:55.890> mix<00:01:56.070> for<00:01:56.250> the

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
Barbara Mervin was in the mix for the

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.660 
Barbara Mervin was in the mix for the
2006<00:01:57.090> squad<00:01:57.390> but<00:01:57.750> she<00:01:57.930> wasn't<00:01:58.140> selected<00:01:58.500> a<00:01:58.950> few

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
2006 squad but she wasn't selected a few

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.609 
2006 squad but she wasn't selected a few
things<00:01:59.909> that<00:02:00.210> not<00:02:00.689> making<00:02:01.049> that<00:02:01.170> team<00:02:01.350> did<00:02:01.590> I

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
things that not making that team did I

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.830 
things that not making that team did I
think<00:02:02.040> going<00:02:02.729> to<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:03.000> World<00:02:03.180> Cup<00:02:03.270> prep<00:02:03.630> camp

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
think going to the World Cup prep camp

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.370 
think going to the World Cup prep camp
which<00:02:04.200> was<00:02:04.850> one<00:02:05.850> of<00:02:05.969> the<00:02:06.659> toughest<00:02:06.990> camps<00:02:07.290> in

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
which was one of the toughest camps in

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.040 
which was one of the toughest camps in
my<00:02:07.469> life<00:02:07.649> where<00:02:07.890> I<00:02:07.950> basically<00:02:08.280> just<00:02:08.369> tackled

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
my life where I basically just tackled

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.990 
my life where I basically just tackled
Jillian<00:02:10.050> Florence<00:02:10.349> and<00:02:10.500> Karen's<00:02:10.709> carry<00:02:11.310> over

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
Jillian Florence and Karen's carry over

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.770 
Jillian Florence and Karen's carry over
and<00:02:12.090> over<00:02:12.330> again<00:02:12.420> made<00:02:13.349> me

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
and over again made me

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.370 
and over again made me
a<00:02:13.810> person<00:02:14.230> it<00:02:14.380> taught<00:02:14.620> me<00:02:14.800> a<00:02:14.980> lot<00:02:15.640> of<00:02:16.380> humility

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
a person it taught me a lot of humility

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.890 
a person it taught me a lot of humility
and<00:02:17.890> the<00:02:18.010> fact<00:02:18.220> that<00:02:18.340> I<00:02:18.730> then<00:02:19.180> understand<00:02:19.720> what

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
and the fact that I then understand what

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.630 
and the fact that I then understand what
people<00:02:20.440> go<00:02:20.650> through<00:02:20.890> and<00:02:21.390> so<00:02:22.390> I<00:02:23.400> also<00:02:24.400> had<00:02:24.610> a

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
people go through and so I also had a

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.010 
people go through and so I also had a
lot<00:02:24.850> of<00:02:24.880> support<00:02:25.330> when<00:02:25.480> I<00:02:25.510> didn't<00:02:25.870> make<00:02:25.900> that

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.020 
lot of support when I didn't make that

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.960 
lot of support when I didn't make that
team<00:02:26.380> and<00:02:26.650> other<00:02:26.830> coaches<00:02:27.040> like<00:02:27.370> Natasha<00:02:27.640> Ashe

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
team and other coaches like Natasha Ashe

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.449 
team and other coaches like Natasha Ashe
helped<00:02:28.270> me<00:02:28.410> find<00:02:29.410> my<00:02:29.590> way<00:02:29.620> and<00:02:29.800> find<00:02:30.220> what<00:02:30.430> I

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
helped me find my way and find what I

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:33.660 
helped me find my way and find what I
needed<00:02:30.700> to<00:02:30.910> do<00:02:31.060> and<00:02:31.739> and<00:02:32.739> that<00:02:32.950> was<00:02:33.040> rugby<00:02:33.430> and

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
needed to do and and that was rugby and

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.190 
needed to do and and that was rugby and
in<00:02:34.090> the<00:02:34.209> end<00:02:34.330> so<00:02:34.480> since<00:02:34.810> then<00:02:35.020> I've<00:02:35.170> just

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
in the end so since then I've just

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.680 
in the end so since then I've just
focused<00:02:36.010> on<00:02:36.220> playing<00:02:36.310> rugby<00:02:36.910> not<00:02:37.209> necessarily

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
focused on playing rugby not necessarily

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.190 
focused on playing rugby not necessarily
making<00:02:37.900> certain<00:02:38.200> teams<00:02:38.530> and<00:02:38.860> it's<00:02:39.959> been<00:02:40.959> a<00:02:40.989> lot

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
making certain teams and it's been a lot

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.650 
making certain teams and it's been a lot
better<00:02:41.470> and<00:02:42.130> more<00:02:42.430> balanced<00:02:42.790> in<00:02:42.940> my<00:02:43.030> life<00:02:43.209> too

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
better and more balanced in my life too

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.380 
better and more balanced in my life too
Mervin<00:02:44.650> learned<00:02:44.860> a<00:02:44.980> lot<00:02:45.160> but<00:02:45.760> she<00:02:45.940> admits<00:02:46.239> that

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
Mervin learned a lot but she admits that

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.090 
Mervin learned a lot but she admits that
not<00:02:46.690> getting<00:02:46.900> picked<00:02:47.200> was<00:02:47.680> really<00:02:47.950> tough

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
not getting picked was really tough

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.630 
not getting picked was really tough
you've<00:02:51.100> trained<00:02:51.459> so<00:02:51.730> hard<00:02:52.030> and<00:02:53.010> you<00:02:54.010> generally

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
you've trained so hard and you generally

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.120 
you've trained so hard and you generally
identify<00:02:55.150> yourself<00:02:55.510> so<00:02:55.720> much<00:02:55.870> as<00:02:56.170> I'm<00:02:56.800> a<00:02:56.860> rugby

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
identify yourself so much as I'm a rugby

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:00.059 
identify yourself so much as I'm a rugby
player<00:02:57.370> and<00:02:57.459> then<00:02:57.970> to<00:02:58.900> get<00:02:59.050> deeper<00:02:59.410> I'm<00:02:59.980> a

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:00.069 
player and then to get deeper I'm a

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:01.440 
player and then to get deeper I'm a
Canadian<00:03:00.459> rugby<00:03:00.880> player<00:03:01.060> and<00:03:01.180> I'm<00:03:01.239> on<00:03:01.390> the

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
Canadian rugby player and I'm on the

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.090 
Canadian rugby player and I'm on the
national<00:03:01.810> team<00:03:01.930> so<00:03:02.110> then<00:03:02.319> when<00:03:02.590> you're<00:03:03.069> not

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
national team so then when you're not

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.490 
national team so then when you're not
selected<00:03:03.940> for<00:03:03.970> that<00:03:04.090> World<00:03:04.390> Cup<00:03:04.540> you<00:03:05.319> go

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
selected for that World Cup you go

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.970 
selected for that World Cup you go
through<00:03:06.370> some<00:03:06.580> identity<00:03:07.480> like<00:03:07.900> Who<00:03:08.500> am<00:03:08.650> I<00:03:08.800> then

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
through some identity like Who am I then

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.000 
through some identity like Who am I then
if<00:03:09.700> I'm<00:03:09.880> not<00:03:09.910> this<00:03:10.300> and<00:03:10.630> it's<00:03:11.530> hard<00:03:11.769> because

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
if I'm not this and it's hard because

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:13.740 
if I'm not this and it's hard because
you<00:03:12.220> put<00:03:12.400> it<00:03:12.430> in<00:03:12.610> and<00:03:12.790> try<00:03:13.330> not<00:03:13.510> to<00:03:13.569> take<00:03:13.690> it

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
you put it in and try not to take it

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.770 
you put it in and try not to take it
personally<00:03:14.110> but<00:03:14.230> you<00:03:14.560> definitely<00:03:14.860> do<00:03:15.160> a

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
personally but you definitely do a

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.030 
personally but you definitely do a
handful<00:03:16.780> of<00:03:16.840> these<00:03:17.110> athletes<00:03:17.500> will<00:03:17.620> face<00:03:17.890> the

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
handful of these athletes will face the

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.850 
handful of these athletes will face the
exact<00:03:18.370> same<00:03:18.579> scenario<00:03:18.820> come<00:03:19.360> July

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
exact same scenario come July

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.410 
exact same scenario come July
compounding<00:03:20.860> the<00:03:20.950> issue<00:03:21.100> is<00:03:21.579> how<00:03:21.760> close<00:03:22.150> this

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
compounding the issue is how close this

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.300 
compounding the issue is how close this
team<00:03:22.720> has<00:03:22.959> become<00:03:23.320> over<00:03:23.709> the<00:03:23.739> past<00:03:24.040> three

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
team has become over the past three

but I think we're pretty we're pretty
friendly<00:03:47.950> off<00:03:48.190> the<00:03:48.400> field<00:03:48.670> which<00:03:48.850> I<00:03:49.000> think

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
friendly off the field which I think

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:51.420 
friendly off the field which I think
that's<00:03:49.359> going<00:03:49.540> to<00:03:49.600> help<00:03:49.780> when<00:03:50.140> you<00:03:51.070> know<00:03:51.160> kind

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 
know what it's going to be like and

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:19.860 
know what it's going to be like and
we're<00:04:18.549> very<00:04:18.729> fortunate<00:04:18.940> and<00:04:19.299> in<00:04:19.660> the<00:04:19.750> way<00:04:19.840> that

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 
we're very fortunate and in the way that

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.430 
we're very fortunate and in the way that
it's<00:04:20.140> turned<00:04:20.350> out<00:04:20.500> and<00:04:20.909> I<00:04:21.909> think<00:04:22.900> you<00:04:23.320> know

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 
it's turned out and I think you know

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.020 
it's turned out and I think you know
that<00:04:23.560> our<00:04:23.890> dynamic<00:04:24.370> is<00:04:24.460> one<00:04:24.490> of<00:04:24.700> our<00:04:24.820> greatest

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.030 
that our dynamic is one of our greatest

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:26.190 
that our dynamic is one of our greatest
strengths<00:04:25.450> and<00:04:25.599> it<00:04:25.690> definitely<00:04:25.930> translates

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:26.200 
strengths and it definitely translates

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.140 
strengths and it definitely translates
onto<00:04:26.830> the<00:04:26.919> field

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:28.150 
onto the field

you know with with that with that

00:04:30.249 --> 00:04:32.429 
you know with with that with that
closeness<00:04:30.789> and<00:04:31.210> support<00:04:31.599> comes<00:04:31.840> trust<00:04:32.169> and

00:04:32.429 --> 00:04:32.439 
closeness and support comes trust and

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:34.409 
closeness and support comes trust and
it's<00:04:33.069> that<00:04:33.159> thing<00:04:33.400> you<00:04:33.460> that<00:04:33.550> you<00:04:33.669> need<00:04:33.909> this

it's that thing you that you need this

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:37.080 
it's that thing you that you need this
unlikely<00:04:34.990> dynamic<00:04:35.680> actually<00:04:35.949> pushes<00:04:36.610> Canada
