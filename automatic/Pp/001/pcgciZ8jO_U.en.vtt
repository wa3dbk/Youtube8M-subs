00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:19.210
 yes I am and I wanted to show today 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:22.980
 as we know, magic and what 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:27.900
 you need it for is either one 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:31.810
 sword or armor 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:35.379
 that will end up looking like that 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:39.420
 them as the flashes and any 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:39.420
 region has a specific 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:45.810
 yes, a little something specific in itself 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.160
 for example firebug projects 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:49.800
 that is then that we are against fire 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.260
 several dances and not so much life 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.690
 loses and what she needs for it 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.000
 a level 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:01:03.510
 I'm 32 now and that's the book 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:07.770
 that's the engine table and you can 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:10.080
 you have no idea if you have that 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:15.890
 then you need this room with books 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:19.200
 Bookshelf put here once and 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:24.960
 if you then like a crafting table 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:30.350
 do you go up and lie something 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:32.600
 certain rhine for example armor 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:36.650
 or a sword 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:40.630
 I take it for such first take 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:43.970
 we just picked up 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:47.030
 they open and you open 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:50.750
 here are led for 19 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:54.200
 the highest is the style 19 who's on it 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:59.600
 then you just get something like that 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:05.060
 deaf object and yes how do you get 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:08.690
 best level you can join once 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:11.060
 so nibble at monsters or 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.769
 you go to saint portal 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:16.790
 I do not know how it cost to 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:21.100
 in any case, there is a dragon country thing 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:26.590
 and you can change the dragon 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:29.959
 defeat by having arrow and bow 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:32.540
 and there will be towers where he is 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:34.940
 that means that it heals on the top of the doors 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.130
 you have to do these weird cunts 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.870
 shoot away 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:42.320
 and he can not even do that there 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:45.560
 exploding and if you did that 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:48.530
 you can actually do that easily 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:51.890
 but only very strong at first 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:55.459
 you should do best in multiplayer 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:58.489
 go in and kill the in multiplayer 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:00.670
 because alone it's always shit 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:04.910
 went to fight a press 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:14.359
 and yes that's a buddy of me 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:16.549
 has killed the end urges yes and that 

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:22.040
 it was so if you have to ask 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:26.000
 Write me a comment and if he 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.720
 Help needs or vodka on the body 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.160
 to play 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:32.120
 then you can come and join us 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:36.819
 help build 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.819

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.650
 ciao
