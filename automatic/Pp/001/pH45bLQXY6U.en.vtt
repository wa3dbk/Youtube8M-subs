00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
we didn't deserve that today that we

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.090 
we didn't deserve that today that we
would<00:00:48.750> events<00:00:49.020> in<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.289> first<00:00:49.500> half<00:00:49.680> with<00:00:49.950> that

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
would events in the first half with that

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.360 
would events in the first half with that
war<00:00:50.280> would<00:00:50.399> compete<00:00:50.730> well<00:00:50.940> second<00:00:51.300> off<00:00:52.370> we

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
war would compete well second off we

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.619 
war would compete well second off we
just<00:00:53.550> got<00:00:53.670> analyze<00:00:54.030> and<00:00:54.239> see<00:00:54.360> where<00:00:54.539> we're

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
just got analyze and see where we're

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:55.639 
just got analyze and see where we're
going<00:00:54.660> to<00:00:54.809> go<00:00:54.870> from<00:00:55.020> me<00:00:55.170> because<00:00:55.260> it<00:00:55.440> was<00:00:55.469> it

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
going to go from me because it was it

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.000 
going to go from me because it was it
probably<00:00:56.129> a<00:00:56.309> good<00:00:56.489> goal<00:00:56.730> from<00:00:57.149> their<00:00:58.010> opinion

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
probably a good goal from their opinion

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.500 
probably a good goal from their opinion
but<00:00:59.190> from<00:00:59.430> our<00:00:59.579> opinion<00:00:59.910> maybe<00:01:00.030> we've<00:01:00.270> done

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
but from our opinion maybe we've done

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.510 
but from our opinion maybe we've done
but<00:01:01.109> overall<00:01:01.500> I<00:01:01.770> think<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.129> range<00:01:02.340> is<00:01:02.489> very

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
but overall I think the range is very

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.399 
but overall I think the range is very
very<00:01:02.910> pleased<00:01:03.149> at<00:01:03.300> worksource<00:01:03.660> today<00:01:03.870> it's
