00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.830
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:07.710
 further rescuer and tutorial resp 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.830
 tutorial I'm showing the war today 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:18.470
 I quickly give you 1 burgtor like no 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:18.470
 I need a goal for that 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:32.000
 and there I was first thought 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:34.710
 a castle burgtor 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.719
 there comes the burgtor 1 later 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:45.780
 You can do it as you can 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:49.200
 want the pesto stop flowing 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.469
 I will become one such masses page 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.469
 build a tower 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:04.010
 okay, come on now 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.810
 Oh, I could just leave that up 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.950
 right there I am again after the 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.410
 small card I have here now 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:28.360
 Just over two bonus ends 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:31.060
 Unequal outer doors there is nothing 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:33.830
 I'm still too dressed 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:36.110
 everything we do is I think so 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:40.030
 are so down that I have now 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:42.740
 simply the middle measured from and there 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:45.970
 it was even cleaned later 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:54.890
 burgtor is coming in here right now 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:02:03.590
 down you look for city ​​knowledge or 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:04.970
 Knef rule from out placed on it 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.149
 now something with what you stop that 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:12.530
 want to make gross no idea 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:20.660
 to be still bitter is a comedian me 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:22.840
 Yes , I can move that so 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:27.470
 half grid 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:31.030
 the our side there is no 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.989
 sleep because sound is higher than 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.680
 my block so that not over it 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:37.390
 can jump 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.390
 so you can not pull me 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:51.520
 so here you can see the toads and gitta 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:54.420
 can then placed here again 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.420
 freed 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:06.670
 So you are here , we are still there 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:10.000
 placed as the rule here and come 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:20.040
 Here imagine fence again can you 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:20.040
 through so happens just here 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.940
 keystone wise not 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:34.610
 that could take take up quite 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:37.110
 pull to the end 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:40.099
 I would do something like that 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:40.099
 girl chances 

00:03:48.079 --> 00:04:00.769
 Now we just need this 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.769
 here a hole 

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:07.220
 obviously better when you see the Sun. 

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:21.000
 But I have to do that on one side 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:28.620
 It's not necessary, but I do 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:30.050
 Metric is so from below you can see that 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:33.800
 Not 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:40.889
 Now let's go to the tower 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:45.800
 reinziehen here now and here comes 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:52.080
 also in stat world to show how peter 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:54.330
 Here are the down and stag lay 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:56.690
 the man in the village away with her if here 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:59.690
 fly out where are you this block 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:59.690
 is 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:05.900
 each on a hill from the inventory 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:09.110
 put out every block back on it 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:09.110
 here the lever 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:17.230
 Lucio and now we already have that 

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:23.610
 upper, of course we want too 

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:23.610
 historicize the bottom because they are not 

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:42.460
 and here we are once 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:46.950
 down here is the bedrock because of me 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:46.950
 stop on super flat games 

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:08.630
 we just have to do it from the top 

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:21.600
 So I the sound signal from here from 

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:25.310
 lever is just down here i do 

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:25.310
 me a repeater ring 

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:37.290
 no matter how he adjusts to what we do 

00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:39.900
 distances that should stop moving 

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:42.080
 It just can not be me myself 

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:42.080
 made 

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:55.080
 and now it's just like that now 

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:59.500
 is open and if it is so 

00:06:55.080 --> 00:07:02.280
 it is closed now i can do it 

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:02.280
 to open again 

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:07.090
 that's how it looks like relative 

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:09.510
 easy to build 

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:11.830
 but not many materials lead 

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:18.930
 I could do it now if you look more beautiful 

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:18.930
 also makes with glass or 

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:25.960
 paving stone but no longer show 

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:33.720
 something with each other lok things 

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:33.720
 which are just bigger than here a blog 

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:59.710
 and of course that too 

00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:05.050
 grid and then of course you can 

00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:06.639
 go through and that 's it 

00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:10.270
 my little tutorials is just now 

00:08:06.639 --> 00:08:14.250
 That is what they are now 

00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:14.250
 times be all right next
