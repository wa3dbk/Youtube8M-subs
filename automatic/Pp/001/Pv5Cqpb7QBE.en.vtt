we teach in the classroom Kansas best is
a<00:00:47.420> way<00:00:47.629> for<00:00:47.660> us<00:00:47.899> to<00:00:48.019> engage<00:00:48.290> with<00:00:48.769> students<00:00:49.190> and

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:49.340 
a way for us to engage with students and

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:50.560 
a way for us to engage with students and
keep<00:00:49.519> them<00:00:49.699> interested<00:00:50.059> in<00:00:50.420> engineering

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:50.570 
keep them interested in engineering

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.049 
keep them interested in engineering
related<00:00:51.230> activities<00:00:52.129> and<00:00:52.730> it's<00:00:52.879> not

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:53.059 
related activities and it's not

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:56.500 
related activities and it's not
something<00:00:53.629> that<00:00:53.659> makes<00:00:54.559> it<00:00:54.769> geeky<00:00:55.400> or<00:00:55.790> not<00:00:56.210> fun

the realm of sports and then the biggest
thing<00:01:30.409> is<00:01:30.530> just<00:01:30.560> problem-solving<00:01:31.810> working

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
thing is just problem-solving working

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.050 
thing is just problem-solving working
with<00:01:32.960> a<00:01:32.990> limited<00:01:33.740> amount<00:01:33.830> of<00:01:34.130> resources<00:01:34.190> they

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
with a limited amount of resources they

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.510 
with a limited amount of resources they
get<00:01:35.270> hands-on<00:01:35.750> experience<00:01:35.780> the<00:01:36.740> fun<00:01:36.920> activity

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
get hands-on experience the fun activity

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.540 
get hands-on experience the fun activity
of<00:01:37.610> the<00:01:37.700> contest<00:01:38.500> I<00:01:39.500> think<00:01:39.890> the<00:01:39.979> students<00:01:40.399> took

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:40.550 
of the contest I think the students took

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:43.749 
of the contest I think the students took
away<00:01:41.210> from<00:01:41.270> Kansas<00:01:41.840> best<00:01:42.110> is<00:01:42.439> learn<00:01:43.220> to

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:43.759 
away from Kansas best is learn to

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:46.359 
away from Kansas best is learn to
compromise<00:01:44.689> I've<00:01:45.409> learned<00:01:45.649> to<00:01:45.860> stand<00:01:46.159> up<00:01:46.340> for

00:01:46.359 --> 00:01:46.369 
compromise I've learned to stand up for

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:49.630 
compromise I've learned to stand up for
their<00:01:46.610> ideas<00:01:46.970> and<00:01:47.329> learn<00:01:47.600> how<00:01:47.659> to<00:01:48.640> work

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
their ideas and learn how to work

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:50.980 
their ideas and learn how to work
together<00:01:49.820> to<00:01:50.119> come<00:01:50.329> out<00:01:50.479> with<00:01:50.630> a<00:01:50.659> common<00:01:50.960> goal

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
together to come out with a common goal

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.580 
together to come out with a common goal
the<00:01:51.560> challenge<00:01:52.040> is<00:01:52.159> to<00:01:52.600> work<00:01:53.600> together<00:01:53.899> you

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
the challenge is to work together you

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.440 
the challenge is to work together you
have<00:01:54.740> to<00:01:54.860> communicate<00:01:55.100> almost<00:01:55.909> every<00:01:56.299> idea

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
have to communicate almost every idea

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.209 
have to communicate almost every idea
with<00:01:56.780> someone<00:01:57.079> else<00:01:57.259> they<00:01:57.590> are<00:01:57.740> not<00:01:57.920> allowed

00:01:58.209 --> 00:01:58.219 
with someone else they are not allowed

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:59.770 
with someone else they are not allowed
to<00:01:58.250> use<00:01:58.579> any<00:01:58.759> sort<00:01:59.149> of<00:01:59.299> electronic

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
to use any sort of electronic

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.320 
to use any sort of electronic

communications devices and

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.310 
communications devices and
as<00:02:02.690> you<00:02:02.930> saw<00:02:03.230> during<00:02:03.830> the<00:02:04.250> competition<00:02:05.320> it

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
as you saw during the competition it

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:15.850 
as you saw during the competition it
gets<00:02:06.560> noisy<00:02:06.770> in<00:02:07.190> the<00:02:07.310> arena<00:02:13.960> the<00:02:14.960> the<00:02:15.440> name<00:02:15.620> of

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
gets noisy in the arena the the name of

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:21.340 
gets noisy in the arena the the name of
the<00:02:16.070> 2013<00:02:16.850> competition<00:02:18.190> gatekeeper<00:02:19.190> and<00:02:20.350> they

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
the 2013 competition gatekeeper and they

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.420 
the 2013 competition gatekeeper and they
paralleled<00:02:22.040> the<00:02:22.250> process<00:02:22.940> of<00:02:23.120> building<00:02:23.390> a

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
paralleled the process of building a

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.430 
paralleled the process of building a
microprocessor<00:02:25.430> there's<00:02:25.850> always<00:02:26.120> a<00:02:26.480> every

year kind of a unique key characteristic

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.140 
year kind of a unique key characteristic
this<00:02:30.620> year<00:02:30.830> was<00:02:31.040> the<00:02:31.190> conveyor<00:02:31.580> belt<00:02:31.880> with<00:02:32.120> the

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
this year was the conveyor belt with the

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.710 
this year was the conveyor belt with the
robot<00:02:32.600> worldwide<00:02:33.370> the<00:02:34.370> coach<00:02:34.850> mostly<00:02:35.510> guide

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
robot worldwide the coach mostly guide

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.990 
robot worldwide the coach mostly guide
them<00:02:35.990> along<00:02:36.020> and<00:02:36.620> gives<00:02:36.950> them<00:02:37.100> the<00:02:37.250> basics<00:02:37.670> and

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
them along and gives them the basics and

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.210 
them along and gives them the basics and
I<00:02:38.630> really<00:02:39.020> thought<00:02:39.260> it<00:02:39.320> was<00:02:39.620> a<00:02:39.950> good

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 
I really thought it was a good

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.530 
I really thought it was a good
opportunity<00:02:40.280> to<00:02:40.970> take<00:02:41.890> building<00:02:43.030> and<00:02:44.030> putting

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
opportunity to take building and putting

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.710 
opportunity to take building and putting
the<00:02:44.630> science<00:02:44.870> with<00:02:45.350> the<00:02:45.470> actual<00:02:45.709> hands-on<00:02:46.720> us

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
the science with the actual hands-on us

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.410 
the science with the actual hands-on us
as<00:02:47.990> mentors<00:02:48.470> can<00:02:48.860> give<00:02:49.670> them<00:02:49.760> little<00:02:49.850> hints<00:02:50.300> on

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
as mentors can give them little hints on

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.410 
as mentors can give them little hints on
