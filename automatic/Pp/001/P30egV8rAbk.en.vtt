00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:18.130
 Welcome to my reading of the letters 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:23.550
 of the tarot for August with 15 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:25.970
 and this one who talks to them is more expensive 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.850
 Gemini 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:32.850
 we go immediately with your reading 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:38.210
 here we have the letter of the sun and here 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.210
 we have to it and the pot letter 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:48.030
 or since it is the only one that goes backwards 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.250
 comes talking about things that are 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.890
 stagnant that are not moving 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:56.440
 I know it's sun rise they 're the first ones 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:59.080
 So he is giving us to understand that 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.910
 at any time during this month or 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.980
 at any time in the future we are going 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:04.990
 to be seeing that everything that 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:07.680
 I was stuck going to start moving 

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:07.680
 will start 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:14.260
 to get out of their way they will see 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:19.090
 movements to say it so the 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:21.040
 things are going to start to mobilize they are going to 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:24.550
 flow is the word I'm looking for 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:26.830
 ok new things begin to emerge things 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:28.000
 new begin to come to your life that 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.700
 is what the letters are announcing 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.670
 to make new doors open for 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:37.750
 you new horizons are being 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:40.300
 expanding before my eyes my dear 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:44.500
 gemini so the letters start 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:48.100
 giving you that message 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:50.420
 however but we have here until the 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:54.110
 norberto 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:57.049
 the 6 of spades and sanmiguel in the letter 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.750
 of justice this can be seen as 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:01.740
 a warning 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.740
 as a suggestion 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:07.310
 the letters that are giving us 

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:09.410
 understand note that the 6 of swords 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.390
 this woman is walking in this 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.360
 address 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.740
 turning his back to the ports 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:19.220
 Alberto sold everything to follow the 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:21.360
 gospel technically he made a 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:25.560
 sacrifice 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:28.350
 here the letters are giving us that their 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.450
 attention my dear my darling is going 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:34.010
 is to leave behind what you had 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:37.800
 so much you fought so much wanted and believed 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.960
 to go in the direction of something else in the 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.300
 lifetime 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:43.830
 because here is a change of direction 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:48.380
 On your part 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:50.520
 ok again requires also 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:53.670
 sacrifices you have to beat certain 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:55.470
 obstacles but life is not this that 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.540
 is coming new his life is 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.490
 pushing to a new address where 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:03.150
 there are also new obstacles to overcome 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:06.659
 new things to face 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:08.280
 ok since that's how we're going to be 

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:10.710
 seeing that it is something relatively 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:13.590
 positive 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:17.080
 one of is pink colony in life 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:21.110
 unfortunately so new ones come 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:23.270
 paths that you have to do 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:25.490
 and that's what we're going to be seeing and 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:28.970
 these roads obviously bring 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:32.230
 I get their challenges their obstacles that 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.940
 you will be able to win 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.920
 what are more or less what the letters 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:37.390
 the letters are giving us to understand 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.640
 they are giving us to understand that all this 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:42.549
 is closely related to 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:45.970
 dreams with goals that you have things 

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:48.940
 that you aspire your goals your goals 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:50.940
 his vision here is a change of goal of 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:56.550
 vision objectives 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:04:00.420
 ok or you just want to continue 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:04.380
 after something new it can be a study go 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:06.310
 to college to school to school 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:08.200
 whatever you want to call 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:11.440
 or it simply means that you 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:14.470
 this has set the goal of doing something 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:17.620
 new and different explore something different 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:20.200
 in life that is what we are 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:23.470
 speaking here we see here in the letter from 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:26.260
 priest and the priestess the two 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:28.870
 they come out together so we're seeing 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:31.330
 the appearance of yin and yang and nothing 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:33.340
 surprise you are geminis the polarity 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.620
 duality what I call the 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:38.560
 bipolarity so we're seeing that 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:40.570
 manifestation here and everything goes backwards 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:43.240
 so here's a lot of introspection is 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:45.990
 that there is a lot of analysis on your part 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:49.600
 dear geminis is thinking analyzing 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:51.650
 ruminating brooding thinking it's going to be 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:54.350
 How will you do it 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:57.169
 ok you can be very sleepy many goals 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:05:00.940
 that I still want to reach and you're 

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:03.910
 presenting many opportunities 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:06.190
 ok we are presenting many but 

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:07.600
 many opportunities so you are going to 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:09.700
 to be 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:12.310
 thinking and analyzing as I said 

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:16.110
 previously on this this entails 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:19.060
 that you most likely have to 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:21.100
 become independent of some situation this 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:25.070
 it may mean that I have to leave 

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:29.150
 back something that had weighed 

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:32.330
 ok to go for something new something 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:33.830
 different something different in other 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:36.020
 words changes your mind as a 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:38.090
 good gemini and is coming towards another new 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:40.460
 course in a few words that what is going to 

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:43.430
 be doing ok that's what I have 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:47.980
 for you my dear, you see 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:47.980
 for August 2015
