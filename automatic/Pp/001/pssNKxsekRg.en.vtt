00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.830 
basically only the stock stuff that's on
your<00:03:12.010> device<00:03:12.280> it<00:03:12.850> does<00:03:13.090> have<00:03:13.300> Super<00:03:13.690> User

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.110 
that stays on there but everything else

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:24.570 
that stays on there but everything else
is<00:03:23.320> just<00:03:23.350> what<00:03:23.740> comes<00:03:23.980> stock<00:03:24.280> with<00:03:24.310> your

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
device so you can see that and then same

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.610 
device so you can see that and then same
with<00:03:28.030> your<00:03:28.330> widgets<00:03:28.630> all<00:03:28.840> you<00:03:29.020> have<00:03:29.200> is<00:03:29.380> stock

with your widgets all you have is stock

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.560 
with your widgets all you have is stock
widgets<00:03:30.010> here<00:03:30.160> now<00:03:30.340> because<00:03:30.760> you<00:03:30.910> are<00:03:31.060> in<00:03:31.240> safe

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:31.570 
widgets here now because you are in safe

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:36.150 
widgets here now because you are in safe
mode<00:03:31.890> okay<00:03:34.050> so<00:03:35.050> it<00:03:35.350> basically<00:03:35.470> keeps<00:03:35.980> all

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160

those<00:03:36.220> things<00:03:36.430> from<00:03:36.490> from<00:03:36.850> running<00:03:37.120> so<00:03:37.240> we<00:03:37.300> had

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
those things from from running so we had

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:38.820 
those things from from running so we had
something<00:03:37.660> that<00:03:37.780> was<00:03:37.870> constantly<00:03:38.380> crashing

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:38.830 
something that was constantly crashing

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:39.900 
something that was constantly crashing
or<00:03:38.920> something<00:03:39.220> like<00:03:39.280> that<00:03:39.340> you<00:03:39.580> go<00:03:39.760> in<00:03:39.850> the

or something like that you go in the

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:41.280 
or something like that you go in the
safe<00:03:40.120> mode<00:03:40.360> and<00:03:40.510> you<00:03:40.570> could<00:03:40.720> say<00:03:40.870> okay<00:03:41.110> well

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
safe mode and you could say okay well

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.980 
safe mode and you could say okay well
the<00:03:41.860> device<00:03:42.160> actually<00:03:42.400> works<00:03:42.760> fine<00:03:43.060> if<00:03:43.450> that

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:43.990 
the device actually works fine if that

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:46.980 
the device actually works fine if that

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
of your issue but safe mode just allows

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:59.550 
of your issue but safe mode just allows
you<00:03:57.880> to<00:03:57.910> get<00:03:58.090> your<00:03:58.300> system<00:03:58.630> running<00:03:58.810> and<00:03:59.140> it's

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
you to get your system running and it's

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.220 
you to get your system running and it's
just<00:03:59.740> running<00:03:59.950> stock<00:04:00.340> applications<00:04:01.120> only<00:04:01.300> so

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.230 
just running stock applications only so

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:04.230 
just running stock applications only so
it's<00:04:02.500> kind<00:04:02.680> of<00:04:02.710> a<00:04:02.800> test<00:04:03.040> thing<00:04:03.310> too<00:04:03.550> just<00:04:04.180> like

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:04.240 
it's kind of a test thing too just like

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:05.370 
it's kind of a test thing too just like
Windows<00:04:04.630> you<00:04:04.810> know<00:04:04.840> you<00:04:04.960> you're<00:04:05.200> afraid

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:05.380 
Windows you know you you're afraid

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:06.750 
Windows you know you you're afraid
something<00:04:05.770> kind<00:04:05.920> of<00:04:05.980> virus<00:04:06.250> or<00:04:06.370> someone's<00:04:06.670> in

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:06.760 
something kind of virus or someone's in

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:07.440 
something kind of virus or someone's in
your<00:04:06.880> system

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.450 
your system

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:08.640 
your system
you're<00:04:07.750> gonna<00:04:07.840> boot<00:04:08.080> into<00:04:08.200> safe<00:04:08.260> mode<00:04:08.440> and

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
you're gonna boot into safe mode and

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:10.230 
you're gonna boot into safe mode and
just<00:04:08.950> make<00:04:09.070> sure<00:04:09.220> it<00:04:09.280> can<00:04:09.430> Alysse<00:04:09.790> boot<00:04:10.030> in

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:10.240 
just make sure it can Alysse boot in

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:12.420 
just make sure it can Alysse boot in
safe<00:04:10.480> mode<00:04:10.720> this<00:04:11.560> is<00:04:11.590> the<00:04:11.740> same<00:04:12.040> same

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430 
safe mode this is the same same

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:16.729 
safe mode this is the same same
principle<00:04:12.910> as<00:04:13.720> like<00:04:14.350> I<00:04:14.380> said<00:04:14.620> as<00:04:14.710> Windows<00:04:15.210> so

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
principle as like I said as Windows so

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:18.960 
principle as like I said as Windows so
pretty<00:04:17.739> much<00:04:17.890> pretty<00:04:18.130> easy<00:04:18.400> and<00:04:18.670> then<00:04:18.790> all<00:04:18.880> you

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:18.970 
pretty much pretty easy and then all you

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:20.750 
pretty much pretty easy and then all you
got<00:04:19.090> to<00:04:19.210> do<00:04:19.299> to<00:04:19.450> get<00:04:19.540> out<00:04:19.690> of<00:04:19.810> safe<00:04:20.020> mode<00:04:20.049> is

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
got to do to get out of safe mode is

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.610 
got to do to get out of safe mode is
power<00:04:21.760> off<00:04:21.880> and<00:04:22.270> then<00:04:22.930> just<00:04:22.960> reboot<00:04:23.500> the

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
power off and then just reboot the

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:25.590 
power off and then just reboot the
device<00:04:23.850> so<00:04:24.850> I'm<00:04:25.000> going<00:04:25.150> to<00:04:25.180> show<00:04:25.330> you<00:04:25.390> just

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:01.960 
hard to read but safe mode down there

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.560
