ops 3 actual confirmation from
Activision<00:00:58.879> and<00:00:59.030> honestly<00:00:59.390> I<00:00:59.480> think<00:00:59.600> it<00:00:59.809> could

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:00.020 
Activision and honestly I think it could

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:01.510 
Activision and honestly I think it could
be<00:01:00.140> a<00:01:00.170> possibility<00:01:00.620> but<00:01:00.949> a<00:01:01.010> lot<00:01:01.160> of<00:01:01.190> people<00:01:01.280> are

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:01.520 
be a possibility but a lot of people are

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.069 
be a possibility but a lot of people are
also<00:01:01.610> saying<00:01:01.940> it<00:01:02.270> could<00:01:02.449> be<00:01:02.539> another<00:01:02.629> game

00:01:03.069 --> 00:01:03.079 
also saying it could be another game

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:04.929 
also saying it could be another game
like<00:01:03.320> spider-man<00:01:03.770> 3<00:01:04.189> or<00:01:04.309> something<00:01:04.640> of<00:01:04.759> that

00:01:04.929 --> 00:01:04.939 
like spider-man 3 or something of that

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:06.760 
like spider-man 3 or something of that
sort<00:01:05.089> I'm<00:01:05.779> not<00:01:06.020> exactly<00:01:06.229> sure<00:01:06.380> what

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
sort I'm not exactly sure what

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:08.289

Activision<00:01:07.219> they<00:01:07.369> are<00:01:07.490> a<00:01:07.520> publisher<00:01:07.939> and<00:01:08.209> they

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:08.299 
Activision they are a publisher and they

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:11.709 
Activision they are a publisher and they
do<00:01:08.569> a<00:01:08.600> lot<00:01:08.779> of<00:01:08.840> games<00:01:09.139> but<00:01:09.350> this<00:01:10.279> in<00:01:10.609> my<00:01:11.090> mind<00:01:11.479> it

00:01:11.709 --> 00:01:11.719 
do a lot of games but this in my mind it

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:13.480 
do a lot of games but this in my mind it
does<00:01:11.990> kind<00:01:12.409> of<00:01:12.529> make<00:01:12.740> sense<00:01:12.799> that<00:01:13.189> it<00:01:13.279> would<00:01:13.369> be

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
does kind of make sense that it would be

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.550 
does kind of make sense that it would be
for<00:01:13.670> black<00:01:13.909> ops<00:01:14.090> 3<00:01:14.509> but<00:01:15.139> it<00:01:15.259> is<00:01:15.380> interesting

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
for black ops 3 but it is interesting

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.199 
for black ops 3 but it is interesting
that<00:01:15.920> it<00:01:16.100> was<00:01:16.219> just<00:01:16.459> sent<00:01:16.639> to<00:01:16.700> German<00:01:17.090> people

00:01:17.199 --> 00:01:17.209 
that it was just sent to German people

00:01:17.209 --> 00:01:19.419 
that it was just sent to German people
in<00:01:17.659> German<00:01:18.349> and<00:01:18.439> there<00:01:18.529> was<00:01:18.619> nothing<00:01:18.770> else<00:01:19.130> in

00:01:19.419 --> 00:01:19.429 
in German and there was nothing else in

in German and there was nothing else in
like<00:01:19.700> the<00:01:19.849> description<00:01:20.420> or<00:01:20.539> anything<00:01:20.899> but<00:01:21.319> I

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380

just go on my channel and find they're
probably<00:02:40.970> really<00:02:41.300> pretty<00:02:41.600> fast<00:02:41.840> since<00:02:42.050> it's

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
probably really pretty fast since it's

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.130 
probably really pretty fast since it's
just<00:02:43.130> a<00:02:43.250> video<00:02:43.520> or<00:02:43.580> two<00:02:43.910> before<00:02:44.300> this<00:02:44.450> but<00:02:45.080> I

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
just a video or two before this but I

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.350 
just a video or two before this but I
already<00:02:45.650> told<00:02:45.890> you<00:02:46.100> I<00:02:46.130> don't<00:02:46.400> I'm<00:02:46.970> not<00:02:47.030> sure<00:02:47.270> if

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
already told you I don't I'm not sure if

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.270 
already told you I don't I'm not sure if
this<00:02:47.450> is<00:02:47.510> fake<00:02:47.780> or<00:02:47.959> real<00:02:47.990> but<00:02:48.320> this<00:02:48.560> does<00:02:48.800> also

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
this is fake or real but this does also

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.070 
this is fake or real but this does also
bring<00:02:49.520> up<00:02:49.610> another<00:02:49.730> subject<00:02:50.180> and<00:02:50.570> it's<00:02:50.959> a

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
bring up another subject and it's a

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.199 
bring up another subject and it's a
daisy<00:02:51.350> style<00:02:51.950> zombie<00:02:52.459> game<00:02:52.670> mode<00:02:52.850> that's<00:02:52.970> what

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:53.209 
daisy style zombie game mode that's what

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:55.030 
daisy style zombie game mode that's what
I'm<00:02:53.300> thinking<00:02:53.660> about<00:02:53.750> free-for-all<00:02:54.470> and<00:02:54.500> TDM

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
I'm thinking about free-for-all and TDM

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.340 
I'm thinking about free-for-all and TDM
I<00:02:55.280> just<00:02:55.910> see<00:02:56.300> it<00:02:56.450> as<00:02:56.630> something<00:02:56.690> that<00:02:57.110> would

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350 
I just see it as something that would

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:59.410 
I just see it as something that would
really<00:02:57.560> make<00:02:57.740> sense<00:02:57.980> like<00:02:58.310> think<00:02:58.820> about<00:02:59.060> just

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
really make sense like think about just

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.330 
really make sense like think about just
having<00:02:59.630> a<00:02:59.810> huge<00:03:00.110> open<00:03:00.470> world<00:03:00.500> setting<00:03:01.010> open

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:01.340 
having a huge open world setting open

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:02.920 
having a huge open world setting open
world<00:03:01.490> map<00:03:01.670> maybe<00:03:02.150> this<00:03:02.390> is<00:03:02.540> just<00:03:02.570> something

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
world map maybe this is just something

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:04.960 
world map maybe this is just something
for<00:03:03.350> next<00:03:03.920> gen<00:03:04.220> since<00:03:04.490> they'll<00:03:04.640> have<00:03:04.790> a<00:03:04.820> lot

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
for next gen since they'll have a lot

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.320 
for next gen since they'll have a lot

call the next gen i guess you can Stoke
well<00:03:09.950> you<00:03:10.040> should<00:03:10.430> be<00:03:10.520> calling<00:03:10.730> it<00:03:10.880> current

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
well you should be calling it current

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:13.630 
well you should be calling it current
gen<00:03:11.390> right<00:03:11.570> now<00:03:11.780> but<00:03:12.500> they<00:03:13.010> could<00:03:13.220> have<00:03:13.430> like<00:03:13.610> a

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:13.640 
gen right now but they could have like a

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.670 
gen right now but they could have like a
war<00:03:13.910> huge<00:03:14.390> map<00:03:14.690> and<00:03:14.990> you<00:03:15.020> just<00:03:15.290> scavenge

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
war huge map and you just scavenge

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.830 
war huge map and you just scavenge
around<00:03:15.740> and<00:03:16.220> it's<00:03:16.400> up<00:03:16.610> player<00:03:17.360> versus<00:03:17.810> player

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
around and it's up player versus player

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.870 
around and it's up player versus player
maybe<00:03:18.290> zombies<00:03:18.769> have<00:03:18.980> a<00:03:19.010> bigger<00:03:19.310> role<00:03:19.550> in<00:03:19.610> this

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:19.880 
maybe zombies have a bigger role in this

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.759 
maybe zombies have a bigger role in this
and<00:03:20.060> i'm<00:03:20.180> sure<00:03:20.360> you<00:03:20.930> can<00:03:21.019> also<00:03:21.200> just<00:03:21.590> have

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:21.769 
and i'm sure you can also just have

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:23.440 
and i'm sure you can also just have
weapons<00:03:22.100> hanging<00:03:22.370> around<00:03:22.610> and<00:03:22.730> stuff<00:03:22.940> but<00:03:23.239> I

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
weapons hanging around and stuff but I

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:25.300 
weapons hanging around and stuff but I
just<00:03:23.870> really<00:03:24.110> think<00:03:24.290> a<00:03:24.440> daisy<00:03:24.650> style<00:03:25.040> mode

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
just really think a daisy style mode

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.040 
just really think a daisy style mode
would<00:03:25.489> be<00:03:25.670> really<00:03:25.820> fun<00:03:26.180> and<00:03:26.420> something

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.050 
would be really fun and something

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:28.720 
would be really fun and something
innovative<00:03:27.380> that<00:03:27.830> we<00:03:27.950> haven't<00:03:28.220> seen<00:03:28.310> in<00:03:28.430> call

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
innovative that we haven't seen in call

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.790 
innovative that we haven't seen in call
of<00:03:28.760> duty<00:03:28.910> zombies<00:03:29.180> yet<00:03:29.989> that<00:03:30.440> a<00:03:30.470> lot<00:03:30.680> of<00:03:30.709> people

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:30.800 
of duty zombies yet that a lot of people

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.740 
of duty zombies yet that a lot of people
would<00:03:31.100> enjoy<00:03:31.280> and<00:03:31.790> I<00:03:32.150> think<00:03:32.239> it<00:03:32.480> would<00:03:32.630> be

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
would enjoy and I think it would be

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:34.000 
would enjoy and I think it would be
something<00:03:32.989> that<00:03:33.140> a<00:03:33.260> lot<00:03:33.350> of<00:03:33.470> people<00:03:33.560> would<00:03:33.830> be

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 
something that a lot of people would be

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:36.460 
something that a lot of people would be
playing<00:03:34.340> every<00:03:34.880> I<00:03:35.180> I<00:03:35.780> think<00:03:36.110> every<00:03:36.320> day

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
playing every I I think every day

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.100 
playing every I I think every day
honestly<00:03:36.650> I<00:03:37.070> just<00:03:37.370> I'm<00:03:37.880> a<00:03:38.239> huge<00:03:38.570> fan<00:03:38.600> of<00:03:38.810> Daisy

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:39.110 
honestly I just I'm a huge fan of Daisy

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:40.509 
honestly I just I'm a huge fan of Daisy
and<00:03:39.320> I<00:03:39.410> think<00:03:39.590> this<00:03:39.680> would<00:03:39.860> be<00:03:39.890> something<00:03:40.160> like

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:40.519 
and I think this would be something like

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:43.330 
and I think this would be something like
I<00:03:40.670> said<00:03:40.880> very<00:03:41.180> innovative<00:03:41.480> so<00:03:42.470> it<00:03:42.800> back<00:03:43.160> to

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
I said very innovative so it back to

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:07.150 
subject of the day and this is a teaser
image<00:04:05.150> that<00:04:05.660> was<00:04:05.870> supposedly<00:04:06.260> given<00:04:06.860> out<00:04:06.980> what

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.160 
image that was supposedly given out what

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.940 
image that was supposedly given out what
was<00:04:07.340> shown<00:04:07.640> by<00:04:07.700> treyarch<00:04:08.269> months<00:04:09.080> ago<00:04:09.320> but<00:04:09.830> it

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:09.950 
was shown by treyarch months ago but it

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:11.710 
was shown by treyarch months ago but it

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:20.060 
thing that you need to take out of this

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.960 
thing that you need to take out of this
is<00:04:20.299> that<00:04:20.330> has<00:04:20.660> two<00:04:21.169> countries<00:04:21.739> on<00:04:21.919> it<00:04:22.040> japan

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:32.410 
making the Assumption hey maybe we're

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:35.909 
making the Assumption hey maybe we're
going<00:04:32.500> to<00:04:32.590> get<00:04:32.740> actual<00:04:33.490> before<00:04:34.090> origins<00:04:34.919> for

going to get actual before origins for
this<00:04:36.070> I'm<00:04:36.280> not<00:04:36.310> exactly<00:04:36.669> sure<00:04:36.820> how<00:04:37.060> they<00:04:37.210> would

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:37.240 
this I'm not exactly sure how they would

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:38.879 
this I'm not exactly sure how they would
work<00:04:37.360> out<00:04:37.720> this<00:04:37.990> but<00:04:38.530> it<00:04:38.650> does<00:04:38.860> look

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:38.889 
work out this but it does look
