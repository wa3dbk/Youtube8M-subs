00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
to rotate towards the thumb we're going

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.399 
to rotate towards the thumb we're going
to<00:01:49.979> see<00:01:50.130> an<00:01:50.250> area<00:01:50.640> of<00:01:50.850> temper<00:01:51.570> foam<00:01:51.750> on<00:01:51.960> top<00:01:52.229> of

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
to see an area of temper foam on top of

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.560 
to see an area of temper foam on top of
each<00:01:52.590> knuckle<00:01:52.950> on<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.729> thumb<00:01:53.970> as<00:01:54.149> well<00:01:54.479> as

each knuckle on the thumb as well as

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.929 
each knuckle on the thumb as well as
another<00:01:54.810> elasticated<00:01:55.380> panel<00:01:55.770> and<00:01:55.920> we<00:01:56.310> do<00:01:56.610> have

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
another elasticated panel and we do have

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.550 
another elasticated panel and we do have
perforated<00:01:57.719> leather<00:01:57.840> on<00:01:58.079> the<00:01:58.170> back<00:01:58.350> of<00:01:58.500> the

thumb as well so what they've tried to
do<00:02:00.090> is<00:02:00.390> give<00:02:00.719> you<00:02:00.840> areas<00:02:01.320> of<00:02:01.469> breathability

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
do is give you areas of breathability

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.800 
do is give you areas of breathability
which<00:02:02.310> are<00:02:02.460> not<00:02:02.610> going<00:02:02.759> to<00:02:02.850> be<00:02:02.939> as<00:02:03.119> impact

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
which are not going to be as impact

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.780 
which are not going to be as impact
prone<00:02:04.110> as<00:02:04.290> some<00:02:04.710> of<00:02:04.799> the<00:02:04.890> areas<00:02:05.250> which<00:02:05.549> might

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
prone as some of the areas which might

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.459 
prone as some of the areas which might
be<00:02:05.939> a<00:02:05.969> little<00:02:06.030> bit<00:02:06.360> closer<00:02:06.659> to<00:02:06.869> areas<00:02:07.439> that

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
be a little bit closer to areas that

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.380 
be a little bit closer to areas that

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
really what this allows is these two

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.940 
really what this allows is these two
hard<00:02:39.150> part<00:02:39.390> sliders<00:02:39.900> here<00:02:40.140> at<00:02:40.560> the<00:02:40.710> base<00:02:40.920> of

smaller bones in your wrist that are
very<00:02:44.870> breakable<00:02:45.870> in<00:02:45.990> the<00:02:46.320> event<00:02:46.560> that<00:02:46.620> you'd

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
very breakable in the event that you'd

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:47.990 
very breakable in the event that you'd
have<00:02:47.010> it<00:02:47.130> get<00:02:47.220> off<00:02:47.340> on<00:02:47.460> the<00:02:47.550> track<00:02:47.730> and<00:02:47.880> put

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
your hands down like this so what

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:51.020 
your hands down like this so what
happens<00:02:49.410> your<00:02:49.800> hand<00:02:49.980> will<00:02:50.100> go<00:02:50.220> down<00:02:50.400> and<00:02:50.610> it'll

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
happens your hand will go down and it'll

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.970 
happens your hand will go down and it'll
allow<00:02:51.180> your<00:02:51.390> palm<00:02:51.600> to<00:02:51.780> slide<00:02:52.050> which<00:02:52.320> is<00:02:52.440> the
