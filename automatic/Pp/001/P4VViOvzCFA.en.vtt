Step<00:00:00.690> five<00:00:01.260> solving<00:00:01.890> the<00:00:02.040> remaining<00:00:02.520> yellow

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:02.909 
Step five solving the remaining yellow

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.700 
Step five solving the remaining yellow
pieces<00:00:05.060> the<00:00:06.060> fifth<00:00:06.330> step<00:00:06.600> is<00:00:06.899> to<00:00:07.109> orient<00:00:07.319> all

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
pieces the fifth step is to orient all

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.220 
pieces the fifth step is to orient all
the<00:00:07.980> remaining<00:00:08.280> corners<00:00:08.849> all<00:00:09.420> this<00:00:09.690> means<00:00:09.990> is

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
the remaining corners all this means is

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.080 
the remaining corners all this means is
to<00:00:10.410> basically<00:00:10.769> solve<00:00:11.130> the<00:00:11.400> remaining<00:00:11.639> yellow

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
to basically solve the remaining yellow

there are no headlights to be found on
the<00:05:19.170> cube<00:05:19.440> then<00:05:20.310> you<00:05:20.910> can<00:05:21.090> hold<00:05:21.270> a<00:05:21.450> cube<00:05:21.690> any

headlights on each of the sides from

headlights on each of the sides from
this<00:06:05.580> point<00:06:05.850> what<00:06:06.090> you<00:06:06.210> want<00:06:06.390> to<00:06:06.450> do<00:06:06.600> is<00:06:06.810> turn

00:06:07.159 --> 00:06:07.169 
this point what you want to do is turn

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:09.710 
this point what you want to do is turn
the<00:06:07.380> top<00:06:07.620> layer<00:06:07.890> until<00:06:08.490> these<00:06:08.880> colors<00:06:09.360> match

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:09.720 
the top layer until these colors match

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:14.450 
the top layer until these colors match
with<00:06:10.110> its<00:06:10.320> side<00:06:10.560> so<00:06:12.110> like<00:06:13.110> this<00:06:13.470> so<00:06:14.160> there's

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:14.460 
with its side so like this so there's

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:19.270 
with its side so like this so there's
orange<00:06:14.970> is<00:06:15.630> blue<00:06:16.100> red<00:06:17.100> and<00:06:17.340> green

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:19.280 
orange is blue red and green

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:22.610 
orange is blue red and green
step<00:06:20.280> 7<00:06:20.760> completing<00:06:21.540> the<00:06:21.690> rest<00:06:21.930> of<00:06:22.169> the<00:06:22.320> cube

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:22.620 
step 7 completing the rest of the cube

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:25.490 
step 7 completing the rest of the cube
so<00:06:23.210> from<00:06:24.210> this<00:06:24.360> point<00:06:24.600> you<00:06:24.990> want<00:06:25.169> to<00:06:25.260> see<00:06:25.410> if

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:25.500 
so from this point you want to see if

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:27.770 
so from this point you want to see if
you<00:06:25.650> have<00:06:25.830> any<00:06:26.010> solid<00:06:26.220> edges<00:06:26.700> so<00:06:27.360> you<00:06:27.390> turn

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:27.780 
you have any solid edges so you turn

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:30.460 
you have any solid edges so you turn
your<00:06:28.020> queue<00:06:28.289> to<00:06:28.979> see<00:06:29.010> if<00:06:29.280> there<00:06:29.460> are<00:06:29.490> any

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:30.470 
your queue to see if there are any

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:33.460 
your queue to see if there are any
and<00:06:31.040> I'll<00:06:31.670> mind<00:06:31.940> there<00:06:32.240> is<00:06:32.270> one<00:06:32.690> so<00:06:33.110> I<00:06:33.140> can<00:06:33.320> put

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:33.470 
and I'll mind there is one so I can put

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:34.690 
and I'll mind there is one so I can put
that<00:06:33.500> in<00:06:33.650> the<00:06:33.830> back<00:06:34.040> and<00:06:34.340> apply<00:06:34.640> this
