00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.940
 Exactly a year ago , LG launched its 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.260
 successful l series 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.480
 and now it's time for the second 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.759
 generation helps devices 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.770
 l3 the l5 and l6 just about the latter 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.390
 two we are going to have it for a while 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:22.740
 they start at the l5 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:24.210
 I am going to make it out of the middle ones 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.789
 the two and you can see so well in 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.189
 format and hopefully also in terms of price 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.050
 the lg l5 has a 4 inch screen and 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.219
 is equipped with a deployed single-core 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.480
 Processor 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.250
 say an overdressed specification 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.200
 of not so much known but facts 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.570
 as it runs on android jelly bean 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.800
 and that he got a pretty cool one over it 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.000
 has lg interface 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.020
 I especially think the lockscreen is very cool 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.090
 where it looks like you're up 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.530
 magnifying glass under your finger and have 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.809
 also when changing the start screen and 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.329
 another cool animation appears 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.469
 just like the lg optimus l3 this is also 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.489
 device again with a number 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.629
 nice lg own functions I now briefly 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.550
 take quick hear you on it 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.989
 home screen or whatever screen you like 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.510
 can draw it and then you can 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.580
 and also the smart LED below 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.479
 the home button is kind of blinking 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.439
 those in different colors 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.720
 depending on which reports 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.340
 receives and it is very convenient 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.260
 lives on a 5 megapixel camera 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.090
 with LED flash and it is in April 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.320
 available 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.520
 and we go to the following devices 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.520
 makes the fridge expire again 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.070
 house good cold because it is about the 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.040
 17 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.500
 and it is in my optimus l7 pocket 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.540
 it is the most high and version of this 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.340
 budget range of lg 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.020
 and that is also the largest and most significant 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.130
 probably also not sustainable extra 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.720
 every day in addition to a transparent 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:41.280
 screen so I put one for a moment 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:43.020
 cool animation on the lg optimus l7 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.939
 but well this is him so it's the 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.030
 largest with a 4.3 inch screen and 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.560
 ing reds dual-core processor 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.420
 just like his smaller brothers here too 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.110
 there all lg own functions in i as 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.049
 we mention about it 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.850
 click memo quick button smart led name 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.020
 but on but the most special about this 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.159
 device is that you will be here a little longer 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.689
 have to wait 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.710
 it is available in my pass 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.689
 in the Netherlands 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.270
 and the price that appears here below in 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.340
 statue 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.769
 the en lg line was a great success 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.140
 it was last year and the chance 

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:13.000
 does that exist with this second generation 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.560
 will not be anything else depends on 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.690
 the price of course because yes this kind 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.950
 appliances they were alderman was allowed to 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.950
 it doesn't cost him too much
