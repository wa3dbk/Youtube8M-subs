00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
you can see on camera here but I've

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.179 
you can see on camera here but I've
actually<00:01:41.430> bent<00:01:41.850> over<00:01:42.229> so<00:01:43.229> it's<00:01:43.380> not<00:01:43.500> sharp<00:01:43.860> and

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
actually bent over so it's not sharp and

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.069 
actually bent over so it's not sharp and
also<00:01:44.850> you<00:01:44.939> don't<00:01:45.149> have<00:01:45.270> to<00:01:45.570> just<00:01:45.750> use<00:01:45.930> your

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
also you don't have to just use your

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.690 
also you don't have to just use your
multi-tool<00:01:46.860> and<00:01:46.979> twist<00:01:47.189> it<00:01:47.310> if<00:01:47.430> you<00:01:47.520> have<00:01:47.670> a

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
multi-tool and twist it if you have a

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.069 
multi-tool and twist it if you have a
cutting<00:01:48.000> tool<00:01:48.240> that's<00:01:48.689> going<00:01:48.810> to<00:01:48.869> work<00:01:49.020> for

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
cutting tool that's going to work for

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.380 
cutting tool that's going to work for
this<00:01:49.380> obviously<00:01:49.560> use<00:01:50.009> a<00:01:50.040> more<00:01:50.909> efficient<00:01:51.270> tool

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
this obviously use a more efficient tool

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.120 
this obviously use a more efficient tool
but<00:01:52.320> for<00:01:52.350> those<00:01:52.560> things<00:01:52.740> you<00:01:52.799> don't<00:01:52.920> have<00:01:53.009> a

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
but for those things you don't have a

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.139 
but for those things you don't have a
cutting<00:01:53.369> tool<00:01:53.490> just<00:01:53.790> use<00:01:53.909> what<00:01:54.030> you<00:01:54.119> have

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
cutting tool just use what you have

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.420 
cutting tool just use what you have
available<00:01:54.439> pair<00:01:55.439> of<00:01:55.500> pliers<00:01:55.710> work<00:01:56.100> you'll

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
available pair of pliers work you'll

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.789 
available pair of pliers work you'll
notice<00:01:56.729> all<00:01:57.570> right<00:01:57.780> so<00:01:57.990> now<00:01:58.140> on<00:01:58.320> to<00:01:58.500> the<00:01:58.590> next

notice all right so now on to the next

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:04.310 
notice all right so now on to the next
step<00:02:01.490> the<00:02:02.490> next<00:02:02.520> step<00:02:02.759> is<00:02:03.119> to<00:02:03.270> tape<00:02:03.509> the<00:02:03.780> inside

okay so here's what it looks like after

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.080 
okay so here's what it looks like after
I<00:02:18.840> taped<00:02:19.080> it<00:02:19.230> basically<00:02:20.160> taping<00:02:20.850> it<00:02:20.940> just

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
I taped it basically taping it just

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.340 
I taped it basically taping it just
ensures<00:02:21.210> that<00:02:21.480> nothing<00:02:21.780> touches<00:02:22.230> the

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
ensures that nothing touches the

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:23.540 
ensures that nothing touches the
Middleton<00:02:22.710> that's<00:02:22.890> not<00:02:23.010> supposed<00:02:23.280> to

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
Middleton that's not supposed to

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.180 
Middleton that's not supposed to
I've<00:02:23.910> also<00:02:24.120> taped<00:02:24.480> the<00:02:24.780> edges<00:02:25.290> of<00:02:25.710> where<00:02:26.010> the

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
I've also taped the edges of where the

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:27.410 
I've also taped the edges of where the
USB<00:02:26.520> seemed<00:02:26.730> to<00:02:26.820> go<00:02:26.910> in<00:02:27.030> just<00:02:27.060> to<00:02:27.270> make<00:02:27.390> sure

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
USB seemed to go in just to make sure

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.210 
USB seemed to go in just to make sure
it's<00:02:27.630> not<00:02:27.750> sharp<00:02:27.990> let's<00:02:28.620> go<00:02:28.770> on<00:02:28.890> to<00:02:28.920> the<00:02:29.070> next

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
it's not sharp let's go on to the next

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.830 
it's not sharp let's go on to the next
step<00:02:29.400> so<00:02:29.850> the<00:02:29.970> next<00:02:30.150> step<00:02:30.360> is<00:02:30.480> to<00:02:30.570> take<00:02:30.690> apart

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
step so the next step is to take apart

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.740 
step so the next step is to take apart
