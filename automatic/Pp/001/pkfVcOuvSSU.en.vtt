00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:29.690 
about it I should have kept it outside

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:34.270 
about it I should have kept it outside
so<00:00:29.990> I<00:00:30.320> could<00:00:31.029> show<00:00:32.029> you<00:00:32.090> how<00:00:32.240> it<00:00:32.599> runs<00:00:32.930> but<00:00:33.380> what

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 
so I could show you how it runs but what

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.720 
so I could show you how it runs but what
it<00:00:34.370> sounds<00:00:34.640> like<00:00:34.700> but<00:00:35.500> if<00:00:36.500> my<00:00:37.160> pipe<00:00:37.400> needs<00:00:37.670> to

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:37.730 
it sounds like but if my pipe needs to

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.800 
it sounds like but if my pipe needs to
be<00:00:38.170> react<00:00:39.170> anyways<00:00:39.680> so<00:00:40.630> it'll<00:00:41.630> sound

guy<00:01:35.270> I<00:01:40.090> figured<00:01:41.090> everybody<00:01:41.539> makes<00:01:41.929> a

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:42.049 
guy I figured everybody makes a

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:44.770 
guy I figured everybody makes a
walk-around<00:01:42.259> of<00:01:42.830> their<00:01:43.220> bike<00:01:43.429> so<00:01:43.789> I<00:01:44.060> thought

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
walk-around of their bike so I thought

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:56.499 
walk-around of their bike so I thought
I'd<00:01:44.929> make<00:01:44.960> a<00:01:45.200> walk<00:01:45.470> around<00:01:55.149> kind<00:01:56.149> of<00:01:56.240> dirty

00:01:56.499 --> 00:01:56.509 
I'd make a walk around kind of dirty

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:05.169 
I'd make a walk around kind of dirty
because<00:01:56.750> I<00:01:56.899> just<00:01:57.110> got<00:01:57.259> done<00:01:57.470> riding<00:02:04.030> look<00:02:05.030> at

00:02:05.169 --> 00:02:05.179 
because I just got done riding look at

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:22.880 
because I just got done riding look at
the<00:02:05.299> pipe<00:02:05.539> in<00:02:05.780> there

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:28.140 

see<00:02:23.890> the<00:02:24.040> right<00:02:24.250> here<00:02:26.670> so<00:02:27.670> if<00:02:27.790> you're<00:02:27.910> looking

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:29.490 
see the right here so if you're looking
to<00:02:28.240> get<00:02:28.390> one<00:02:28.540> of<00:02:28.660> these<00:02:28.780> I<00:02:28.810> definitely

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
nothing that you know I can really

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.300 
nothing that you know I can really
notice<00:02:38.050> cuz<00:02:38.410> I've<00:02:38.500> written<00:02:38.710> some<00:02:39.130> of<00:02:39.160> the

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
notice cuz I've written some of the

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.420 
notice cuz I've written some of the
newer<00:02:39.490> ones<00:02:39.790> and<00:02:40.060> I<00:02:40.650> mean<00:02:41.650> it's<00:02:41.860> not<00:02:42.010> that<00:02:42.250> big

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
newer ones and I mean it's not that big

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.580 
newer ones and I mean it's not that big
of<00:02:42.490> a<00:02:42.640> difference<00:02:42.820> so<00:02:43.240> I<00:02:43.510> would<00:02:44.080> go<00:02:44.440> out<00:02:44.560> and

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:44.590 
of a difference so I would go out and

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.930 
of a difference so I would go out and
spend<00:02:44.860> the<00:02:45.160> money<00:02:45.190> on<00:02:45.640> a<00:02:45.790> brand<00:02:46.720> new<00:02:46.900> bike<00:02:47.290> just

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
spend the money on a brand new bike just

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.970 
spend the money on a brand new bike just
you<00:02:48.940> know<00:02:49.030> this<00:02:49.210> will<00:02:49.390> do<00:02:49.540> just<00:02:49.960> fine<00:02:50.050> I<00:02:50.560> think

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
you know this will do just fine I think

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.530 
you know this will do just fine I think
the<00:02:51.190> only<00:02:51.340> thing<00:02:51.550> I<00:02:51.640> noticed<00:02:52.000> differently

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
the only thing I noticed differently

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.330 
the only thing I noticed differently
from<00:02:52.720> this<00:02:52.870> bike<00:02:53.140> to<00:02:53.590> the<00:02:53.620> newer<00:02:53.860> ones<00:02:54.130> is

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
from this bike to the newer ones is

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.580 
from this bike to the newer ones is
probably<00:02:54.640> suspension<00:02:55.300> of<00:02:55.420> the<00:02:55.510> chassis<00:02:56.250> so

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
probably suspension of the chassis so

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:04.980 
probably suspension of the chassis so
yeah<00:02:59.590> that's<00:03:00.280> my<00:03:00.370> 2005<00:03:01.120> Kawasaki<00:03:01.900> KX<00:03:01.980> 250f
