00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.429 

just<00:02:03.270> listen<00:02:03.630> to<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:03.840> difference<00:02:04.229> when<00:02:04.409> you

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
just listen to the difference when you

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:11.660 
just listen to the difference when you
put<00:02:04.560> it<00:02:04.860> in<00:02:05.009> Corsa<00:02:05.189> mode<00:02:09.679> in<00:02:10.679> Corsa<00:02:11.160> mode<00:02:11.190> the

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
put it in Corsa mode in Corsa mode the

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.120 
put it in Corsa mode in Corsa mode the

gas flow the exhaust passes the silencer

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.190 
gas flow the exhaust passes the silencer
and<00:02:14.310> basically<00:02:14.790> it<00:02:15.090> becomes<00:02:15.510> straight<00:02:15.930> pipes

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
and basically it becomes straight pipes

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:22.100 
and basically it becomes straight pipes

the<00:02:22.860> engine<00:02:23.220> is<00:02:23.340> still<00:02:23.520> cold<00:02:23.790> so<00:02:24.210> let's<00:02:24.510> wait<00:02:24.660> a

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
the engine is still cold so let's wait a

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:33.080 
the engine is still cold so let's wait a
little<00:02:24.930> bit<00:02:25.200> before<00:02:25.410> to<00:02:26.010> rev<00:02:26.220> it<00:02:26.340> up

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.479 

okay<00:02:33.599> so<00:02:33.660> this<00:02:34.020> you<00:02:34.140> can<00:02:34.319> see<00:02:34.530> it<00:02:34.770> doesn't<00:02:35.130> have

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
okay so this you can see it doesn't have

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:38.630 
okay so this you can see it doesn't have

crackles<00:03:25.210> it<00:03:25.600> really<00:03:26.380> sounds<00:03:26.680> mean<00:03:26.890> AC<00:03:35.070> but<00:03:36.070> if

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
crackles it really sounds mean AC but if

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.340

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:38.350 
you want to travel the noise is not the

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:40.680 
you want to travel the noise is not the
real<00:03:38.530> problem<00:03:39.040> because<00:03:39.430> just<00:03:40.270> like<00:03:40.450> most

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
real problem because just like most

supercars<00:03:41.050> even<00:03:42.010> the<00:03:42.100> oricon<00:03:42.490> suffers<00:03:42.940> a<00:03:42.970> tiny

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:43.330

boot<00:03:43.570> I<00:03:43.840> don't<00:03:44.470> know<00:03:44.560> how<00:03:44.740> they<00:03:44.920> managed<00:03:45.340> but

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:45.520 
boot I don't know how they managed but

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:47.670 
boot I don't know how they managed but
actually<00:03:46.090> the<00:03:46.240> capacity<00:03:46.810> is<00:03:46.990> even<00:03:47.380> smaller

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
actually the capacity is even smaller

00:03:47.680 --> 00:04:09.140 
actually the capacity is even smaller
than<00:03:47.830> the<00:03:48.040> Gallardo's

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150
