and<00:00:59.040> it's<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.699> whole<00:00:59.850> right<00:01:00.089> side<00:01:00.120> is<00:01:00.659> can

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:00.900 
and it's the whole right side is can

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:04.759 
and it's the whole right side is can
offer<00:01:01.370> the<00:01:02.370> village<00:01:02.909> is<00:01:03.379> chronically<00:01:04.379> shortly

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
offer the village is chronically shortly

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.860 
offer the village is chronically shortly
yeah<00:01:05.250> so<00:01:05.460> right<00:01:05.940> now<00:01:05.970> what<00:01:06.299> I'm<00:01:06.450> doing<00:01:06.479> is

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
rather than focus on specific area where

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.730 
rather than focus on specific area where
I'm<00:01:09.450> going<00:01:09.570> to<00:01:09.659> try<00:01:09.750> to<00:01:09.780> open<00:01:10.020> up<00:01:10.260> a<00:01:10.380> little<00:01:10.500> try

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
I'm going to try to open up a little try

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.490 
I'm going to try to open up a little try
to<00:01:10.799> apply<00:01:11.130> this<00:01:11.369> entire<00:01:11.700> quadrant<00:01:12.030> yeah<00:01:12.659> this

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
to apply this entire quadrant yeah this

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.750 
to apply this entire quadrant yeah this
is<00:01:13.619> an<00:01:13.710> example<00:01:14.010> of<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.810> generic

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:16.760 
is an example of the generic

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.240 
is an example of the generic
degenerative<00:01:17.810> forces<00:01:18.920> what<00:01:19.920> we're<00:01:20.070> going<00:01:20.160> to

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
degenerative forces what we're going to

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.760 
degenerative forces what we're going to
do<00:01:20.400> is<00:01:20.520> I'm<00:01:20.640> going<00:01:20.850> to<00:01:20.940> just<00:01:21.150> practice

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
do is I'm going to just practice

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.130 
do is I'm going to just practice
alternately<00:01:22.770> moving<00:01:23.730> with<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.570> strike<00:01:24.870> and

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
alternately moving with the strike and

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.440 
alternately moving with the strike and
then<00:01:25.350> taking<00:01:25.650> a<00:01:25.860> strike<00:01:26.070> so<00:01:26.400> first<00:01:26.910> one<00:01:27.150> I<00:01:27.180> move

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
then taking a strike so first one I move

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.330 
then taking a strike so first one I move
with<00:01:27.690> whatever<00:01:27.960> strike<00:01:28.380> he<00:01:28.530> does<00:01:28.740> which<00:01:29.100> has

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
with whatever strike he does which has

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.360 
with whatever strike he does which has
to<00:01:29.520> hit<00:01:29.700> okay<00:01:30.450> i<00:01:30.480> hope<00:01:31.320> i<00:01:31.500> don't<00:01:31.680> die<00:01:31.800> but<00:01:32.160> right

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:32.370 
to hit okay i hope i don't die but right

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:35.090 
to hit okay i hope i don't die but right
second<00:01:33.150> what<00:01:33.240> I<00:01:33.270> have<00:01:33.420> to<00:01:33.570> take<00:01:33.950> next<00:01:34.950> one<00:01:35.070> I

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
second what I have to take next one I

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.090 
second what I have to take next one I
move<00:01:35.370> with<00:01:35.720> next<00:01:36.720> one<00:01:36.840> I<00:01:36.870> take<00:01:37.140> from<00:01:37.830> wherever

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
move with next one I take from wherever

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.530 
move with next one I take from wherever
I<00:01:38.280> end<00:01:38.400> up<00:01:38.700> you<00:01:38.970> want<00:01:39.150> to<00:01:39.240> be<00:01:39.330> able<00:01:39.390> to

I end up you want to be able to

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.440 
I end up you want to be able to
alternate<00:01:40.020> defensively<00:01:40.980> between<00:01:41.460> fu<00:01:42.090> which

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
alternate defensively between fu which

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.330 
alternate defensively between fu which
is<00:01:42.600> what<00:01:42.750> i<00:01:42.780> call<00:01:43.020> it<00:01:43.200> and<00:01:43.350> actually<00:01:43.980> I've

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
is what i call it and actually I've

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.390 
is what i call it and actually I've
better<00:01:44.580> off<00:01:44.790> getting<00:01:45.480> out<00:01:45.690> of<00:01:45.840> here<00:01:45.990> right

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:46.400 
better off getting out of here right

better off getting out of here right
sometimes<00:01:47.400> your<00:01:47.550> corner<00:01:47.940> you<00:01:48.270> don't<00:01:48.450> get<00:01:48.570> to

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
sometimes your corner you don't get to

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.200 
sometimes your corner you don't get to
be<00:01:48.780> all<00:01:49.080> sneaky<00:01:49.530> and<00:01:49.920> slippery<00:01:50.370> you<00:01:50.910> just<00:01:51.090> go
