now<00:00:26.150> NPV<00:00:26.660> theory<00:00:27.110> is<00:00:27.230> quite<00:00:27.470> simple<00:00:27.920> if<00:00:28.130> you

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:28.580 
now NPV theory is quite simple if you

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:30.790 
now NPV theory is quite simple if you
want<00:00:28.730> more<00:00:28.880> space<00:00:29.240> go<00:00:29.270> upwards<00:00:30.080> rather<00:00:30.500> than

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:30.800 
want more space go upwards rather than

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.979 
want more space go upwards rather than
outwards<00:00:31.310> does<00:00:32.059> it<00:00:32.210> give<00:00:32.329> a<00:00:32.360> lot<00:00:32.570> more<00:00:32.750> room

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:32.989 
outwards does it give a lot more room

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:35.260 
outwards does it give a lot more room
the<00:00:33.199> short<00:00:33.410> answer<00:00:33.770> is<00:00:33.800> yes<00:00:34.370> it<00:00:34.579> does<00:00:34.760> we'll

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:35.270 
the short answer is yes it does we'll

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.210 
the short answer is yes it does we'll
talk<00:00:35.450> more<00:00:35.630> about<00:00:35.690> that<00:00:35.900> later<00:00:36.079> first<00:00:36.980> of<00:00:37.160> all

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:37.220 
talk more about that later first of all

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:56.779 
talk more about that later first of all
let's<00:00:37.370> see<00:00:37.520> how<00:00:37.610> it<00:00:37.730> drives

it<00:01:04.180> makes<00:01:04.360> it<00:01:04.509> feel<00:01:04.899> probably<00:01:05.350> bigger<00:01:05.770> than<00:01:05.920> it

00:01:05.999 --> 00:01:06.009 
it makes it feel probably bigger than it
