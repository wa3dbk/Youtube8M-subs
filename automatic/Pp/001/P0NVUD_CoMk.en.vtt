00:00:00.799 --> 00:00:02.699
 hello this is a smartphone review from 

00:00:02.699 --> 00:00:03.830
 creepy butter 

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:06.100
 So I think that those who watched May 

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:08.709
 last year noticed that he p 

00:00:08.709 --> 00:00:11.169
 I became a plot game score 

00:00:11.169 --> 00:00:12.779
 which is ported 

00:00:12.779 --> 00:00:15.539
 and with more powerful smartphones with more 

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:17.550
 permission for a phone by which 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.730
 slam whose permission to remind 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.050
 480x320 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:26.779
 here and by the way these reviews will also 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:28.279
 very helpful to everyone 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:30.919
 who has a smartphone with about 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:32.210
 characteristics 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.580
 for example galaxy and chs 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.240
 Well let's get started 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:39.980
 What means 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:41.870
 and show games 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:43.200
 organ by the way 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.490
 another sparta grew and hammer 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:48.800
 on the way a line of crook 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.030
 many love this game on smartphones but to 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:52.910
 sorry 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.240
 percent long time this game was not on 

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:56.450
 paragraph maslik 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:57.930
 but now we can finally 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.950
 rejoice for my example was him m 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:03.950
 one of the main disadvantages of this too 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:05.830
 by phone 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:07.550
 permission does not allow to play 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.550
 most powerful games 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:14.270
 but it is now fortunately the situation is strong 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:15.300
 has changed 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.960
 here you will see here and the video goes but that 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.390
 similar as usual barriers one lot 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.810
 noticing that this is again the players can 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.810
 play them powerful 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.440
 not many obscure optimization plan 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.990
 so im here our neighbor read 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.829
 already seen that everything is under our crowns so nothing 

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:38.640
 as if everything goes fine 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.960
 so well, then let's start right away 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.340
 this game is already pc 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.210
 didnâ€™t play still 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:48.049
 here 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:51.049
 and now you see for yourself 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.990
 wonderful game or not and how it works on 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.040
 it is absurd 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.020
 In general, the garden but from such brakes I 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.270
 there is no 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.250
 generally works ok 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.200
 but not as smooth as possible 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.200
 well means 

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:15.479
 character 

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:20.219
 here means the body of the control panel as 

00:02:20.219 --> 00:02:21.479
 usually 

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:24.479
 in games of this type but there is a joystick here 

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:28.219
 only we can name ourselves a weapon 

00:02:28.219 --> 00:02:28.599
 there is 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:30.239
 this is an extra lesson 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:32.319
 buttons putin 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:33.169
 percent 

00:02:33.169 --> 00:02:35.959
 this is he a gift 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:39.249
 it's more powerful strike 

00:02:39.249 --> 00:02:41.899
 bounce 

00:02:41.899 --> 00:02:44.519
 here we have life 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:47.259
 seeing dorenko 

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:50.259
 no we can upgrade our weapons 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:53.829
 thats okay l 

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:56.609
 let's continue 

00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:59.609
 means the arrow shows us where to go 

00:03:01.899 --> 00:03:04.899
 that same very frequent occurrence 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:11.279
 and I think that many cb graphics game is everything 

00:03:11.279 --> 00:03:12.419
 still 

00:03:12.419 --> 00:03:15.239
 on smartphone 1 for no gaming 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:18.239
 prefix 

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:26.469
 so means to 

00:03:26.469 --> 00:03:28.849
 the truth is what technique and also remove 

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:30.729
 some cons 

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:32.709
 for example 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:34.809
 by the way 

00:03:34.809 --> 00:03:37.319
 mmm we will come to this 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:39.399
 appear to be against learning 

00:03:39.399 --> 00:03:40.639
 Moscow 

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:41.499
 percent 

00:03:41.499 --> 00:03:43.879
 as pragmatist 

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:45.959
 games of this type take quite 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:47.549
 a lot of memory 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:50.659
 otherwise, the Dniester may take hundreds in 

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:53.659
 much usual within a hundred 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:59.119
 the same situation with 

00:03:59.119 --> 00:04:01.929
 assassins creed 

00:04:01.929 --> 00:04:04.929
 so here comes the download again 

00:04:06.009 --> 00:04:06.970
 by the way here 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:09.349
 happens to be a tour 

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:11.799
 while loading 

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:13.899
 so she means 

00:04:13.899 --> 00:04:15.989
 here you can say everything like me in 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:17.949
 computer game 

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:19.919
 true top view 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:21.799
 not a third person 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:24.799
 but nonetheless 

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:33.039
 tons naturally as usual a lot of chatter 

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:36.939
 something like rollers 

00:04:36.939 --> 00:04:39.939
 although it is certainly not the rollers 

00:04:41.059 --> 00:04:44.059
 report effects rewound 

00:04:48.999 --> 00:04:52.090
 okay, let's completely miss 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:55.070
 all here is the basis of motion run way i think 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:57.199
 have you noticed that often here 

00:04:57.199 --> 00:05:00.540
 come across people to show us something 

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:02.279
 that this game is realistic 

00:05:02.279 --> 00:05:05.279
 and the people here are 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:08.169
 absolute he is normal they of course 

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:09.879
 not interpreted and goes 

00:05:09.879 --> 00:05:13.370
 However 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:16.370
 it looks no no very good 

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:18.409
 take a look 

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:21.409
 on this so-called realism 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.029
 but do not go there court but it 

00:05:25.029 --> 00:05:27.559
 it seems like nonsense 

00:05:27.559 --> 00:05:30.559
 what sensation creates 

00:05:30.559 --> 00:05:31.699
 so ok 

00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:34.699
 times 

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:38.870
 Now in the club house 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:40.240
 and begin 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:43.380
 in general, so we learned to run over 

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:46.380
 the walls 

00:05:50.309 --> 00:05:53.069
 so now do not need to resort 

00:05:53.069 --> 00:05:54.490
 I hope so 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:57.619
 get one hand 

00:05:57.619 --> 00:05:59.460
 receive 

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:01.710
 So 

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:04.460
 still that goes on 

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:07.710
 part of the amount did not fall 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:11.069
 very comfortable is that 

00:06:11.069 --> 00:06:12.599
 in the fall 

00:06:12.599 --> 00:06:15.599
 the character very often clings to the wall 

00:06:17.659 --> 00:06:20.499
 makes the shape more comfortable 

00:06:20.499 --> 00:06:21.340
 same way 

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:22.430
 and when losing 

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:23.949
 we are too much 

00:06:23.949 --> 00:06:27.389
 and not lost 

00:06:27.389 --> 00:06:30.389
 what we have now weighs in the world 

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:34.050
 let's remember still growing so 

00:06:39.729 --> 00:06:42.939
 This of course there are some incomprehensible 

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:45.710
 situations 

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:48.620
 that also morgue walk minus this by the way 

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:50.660
 sales are not necessary to give impassable 

00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:52.659
 a situation 

00:06:52.659 --> 00:06:54.430
 at the beginning of the newspaper 

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:57.529
 make a mistake 

00:06:57.529 --> 00:07:00.740
 cube you have an example you run a bridge 

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:02.189
 falling apart 

00:07:02.189 --> 00:07:04.199
 and this is all as 

00:07:04.199 --> 00:07:05.770
 loss can be said but fortunately 

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:07.599
 take a look 

00:07:07.599 --> 00:07:10.619
 which means this menu is a pause we can to 

00:07:10.619 --> 00:07:11.969
 for example 

00:07:11.969 --> 00:07:14.330
 restart the mission or window 

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:17.330
 appear from the last point since 

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:24.309
 well, it was all very basic 

00:07:24.309 --> 00:07:26.960
 here is her as usual i 

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:29.960
 I will say where you can download this game 

00:07:30.619 --> 00:07:34.219
 all on the same site of the p500 transit point 

00:07:34.219 --> 00:07:36.379
 RU 

00:07:36.379 --> 00:07:38.680
 it is of course very good there 

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:40.069
 got up under the water 

00:07:40.069 --> 00:07:43.080
 such games are a very big plus 

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:45.099
 but that's not all yet 

00:07:45.099 --> 00:07:48.099
 ported games I thought more will appear 

00:07:48.619 --> 00:07:51.159
 Well, it was expensive assassins creed on 

00:07:51.159 --> 00:07:52.780
 smartphone lg optimus one 

00:07:52.780 --> 00:07:53.949
 total during the meeting
