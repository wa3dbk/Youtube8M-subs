pretty<00:03:31.450> cool<00:03:31.750> like<00:03:31.959> the<00:03:31.989> physics<00:03:32.379> at<00:03:32.530> work<00:03:32.680> I

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
pretty cool like the physics at work I

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:38.220 
pretty cool like the physics at work I
mean<00:03:35.430> to<00:03:36.430> have<00:03:36.519> like<00:03:36.760> a<00:03:36.790> little<00:03:37.060> bit<00:03:37.239> forgetful

simplified<00:04:46.389> mechanics<00:04:46.930> and<00:04:47.169> stuff<00:04:47.410> but<00:04:47.770> I

00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:48.479 
simplified mechanics and stuff but I

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:50.670 
simplified mechanics and stuff but I
doesn't<00:04:49.479> necessarily<00:04:49.990> mean<00:04:50.110> that<00:04:50.169> you<00:04:50.530> know

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:50.680 
doesn't necessarily mean that you know

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.409 
doesn't necessarily mean that you know
you<00:04:51.160> can<00:04:51.280> actually<00:04:51.400> come<00:04:51.729> out<00:04:51.760> of<00:04:51.940> a<00:04:52.030> game<00:04:52.060> it

00:04:52.409 --> 00:04:52.419 
you can actually come out of a game it

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:54.740 
you can actually come out of a game it
does<00:04:52.599> have<00:04:52.810> like<00:04:53.050> some<00:04:53.320> challenge<00:04:53.770> or<00:04:54.099> summer

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750 
does have like some challenge or summer

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:58.200 
does have like some challenge or summer
progression<00:04:55.750> or<00:04:56.400> now<00:04:57.400> I<00:04:57.430> mean<00:04:57.639> this<00:04:57.880> is<00:04:58.030> this

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:58.210 
progression or now I mean this is this

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:01.020 
progression or now I mean this is this
is<00:04:58.389> quite<00:04:58.690> challenging<00:04:58.900> in<00:04:59.590> the<00:04:59.740> way<00:05:00.520> you<00:05:00.580> got

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:01.030 
is quite challenging in the way you got

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:02.520 
is quite challenging in the way you got
to<00:05:01.120> think<00:05:01.210> about<00:05:01.389> the<00:05:01.630> pitch<00:05:02.020> you<00:05:02.349> thought<00:05:02.470> you

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:02.530 
to think about the pitch you thought you

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:04.290 
to think about the pitch you thought you
said<00:05:02.740> it's<00:05:02.919> got<00:05:03.010> a<00:05:03.039> puzzle<00:05:03.370> basis<00:05:03.729> almost<00:05:03.880> it's

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:04.300 
said it's got a puzzle basis almost it's

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:06.240 
said it's got a puzzle basis almost it's
not<00:05:04.479> just<00:05:04.720> trying<00:05:05.320> to<00:05:05.380> bash<00:05:05.530> stuff<00:05:05.830> as<00:05:05.950> hard<00:05:06.099> as

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:06.250 
not just trying to bash stuff as hard as

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:09.750 
not just trying to bash stuff as hard as
you<00:05:06.340> can<00:05:06.520> or<00:05:06.700> as<00:05:06.820> fast<00:05:07.000> as<00:05:07.240> you<00:05:07.330> can<00:05:08.610> you<00:05:09.610> got

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:09.760 
you can or as fast as you can you got

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:11.040 
you can or as fast as you can you got
the<00:05:09.849> trajectories<00:05:10.450> and<00:05:10.479> you've<00:05:10.840> got<00:05:10.900> like

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:11.050 
the trajectories and you've got like

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:13.379 
the trajectories and you've got like
these<00:05:11.169> gravitational<00:05:11.470> fields<00:05:12.430> and<00:05:12.669> try<00:05:13.330> to

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:13.389 
these gravitational fields and try to

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:15.120 
these gravitational fields and try to
take<00:05:13.599> out<00:05:13.810> you<00:05:14.289> really<00:05:14.470> got<00:05:14.560> so<00:05:14.740> neat<00:05:14.950> like

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:15.130 
take out you really got so neat like

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:17.700 
take out you really got so neat like
shots<00:05:15.460> for<00:05:15.669> each<00:05:15.729> level<00:05:16.380> there's<00:05:17.380> quite<00:05:17.590> a<00:05:17.620> bit

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:17.710 
shots for each level there's quite a bit

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:19.350 
shots for each level there's quite a bit
of<00:05:17.830> replayability<00:05:18.280> too<00:05:18.760> because<00:05:19.060> well<00:05:19.240> you

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:19.360 
of replayability too because well you

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.300 
of replayability too because well you
can<00:05:19.510> finish<00:05:19.660> a<00:05:19.810> level<00:05:19.990> what<00:05:20.919> you<00:05:21.039> can<00:05:21.190> also

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:21.310 
can finish a level what you can also

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:23.460 
can finish a level what you can also
finish<00:05:21.550> a<00:05:21.729> level<00:05:21.820> with<00:05:22.120> free<00:05:22.330> stories<00:05:22.599> Andres

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:23.470 
finish a level with free stories Andres

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:25.879 
finish a level with free stories Andres
quite<00:05:23.680> a<00:05:23.710> bit<00:05:23.919> of<00:05:24.039> bonuses<00:05:24.520> and<00:05:24.669> easter<00:05:24.970> eggs

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:30.910 
hidden the golden eggs turn anything yea

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:35.150 
hidden the golden eggs turn anything yea
high<00:05:31.479> schools<00:05:31.840> and<00:05:32.110> stuff<00:05:32.289> always<00:05:32.530> there

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:35.160 

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.750 

it<00:05:36.150> has<00:05:36.390> a<00:05:36.420> very<00:05:36.720> high<00:05:37.080> fatigue<00:05:37.830> factor<00:05:38.070> which

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:38.760 
it has a very high fatigue factor which

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:40.460 
it has a very high fatigue factor which
yeah<00:05:39.030> always<00:05:39.510> a<00:05:39.600> good<00:05:39.840> thing<00:05:39.870> for<00:05:40.080> a<00:05:40.260> mobile

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:40.470 
yeah always a good thing for a mobile

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:43.340 
yeah always a good thing for a mobile
game<00:05:41.120> yeah<00:05:42.120> I<00:05:42.150> mean<00:05:42.210> that's<00:05:42.690> kind<00:05:43.020> of<00:05:43.140> I<00:05:43.320> guess

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:43.350 
game yeah I mean that's kind of I guess

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:45.560 
game yeah I mean that's kind of I guess
the<00:05:43.740> slip<00:05:44.280> well<00:05:44.490> the<00:05:44.970> main<00:05:45.120> design

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:45.570 
the slip well the main design

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:47.000 
the slip well the main design
differences<00:05:45.990> in<00:05:46.230> as<00:05:46.350> you<00:05:46.500> making<00:05:46.770> again

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:47.010 
differences in as you making again

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:48.530 
differences in as you making again
that's<00:05:47.220> designed<00:05:47.580> to<00:05:47.670> be<00:05:47.790> played<00:05:48.000> instead<00:05:48.450> of

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:48.540 
that's designed to be played instead of

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:50.660 
that's designed to be played instead of
three<00:05:48.990> to<00:05:49.140> five<00:05:49.320> minute<00:05:49.680> segments<00:05:50.250> are<00:05:50.370> up<00:05:50.460> and

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:50.670 
three to five minute segments are up and

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:52.610 
three to five minute segments are up and
again<00:05:50.880> it's<00:05:51.090> designed<00:05:51.540> to<00:05:51.630> played<00:05:51.870> in<00:05:52.080> three

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:52.620 
again it's designed to played in three

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:59.630 
again it's designed to played in three
two<00:05:52.740> 15-minute<00:05:53.280> segments<00:05:53.790> a<00:05:53.940> 30<00:05:54.480> to<00:05:54.630> 50<00:05:58.610> yeah<00:05:59.610> I

00:05:59.630 --> 00:05:59.640 
two 15-minute segments a 30 to 50 yeah I

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:01.430 
two 15-minute segments a 30 to 50 yeah I
mean<00:05:59.880> for<00:06:00.090> a<00:06:00.120> few<00:06:00.300> bucks<00:06:00.330> this<00:06:00.750> is<00:06:00.870> a<00:06:00.900> very<00:06:01.350> good

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:01.440 
mean for a few bucks this is a very good

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:03.800 
mean for a few bucks this is a very good
boy<00:06:01.710> it'll<00:06:02.520> definitely<00:06:02.700> be<00:06:03.030> entertained<00:06:03.630> for

boy it'll definitely be entertained for

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:07.670 
boy it'll definitely be entertained for
at<00:06:03.990> least<00:06:04.140> know<00:06:04.680> where<00:06:04.830> to<00:06:05.600> what<00:06:06.600> I<00:06:07.290> mean

coming soon not as many linear corridors

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:48.590 
coming soon not as many linear corridors
there<00:06:45.900> is<00:06:46.050> it<00:06:46.200> better<00:06:46.350> than<00:06:46.500> battle<00:06:46.860> chess<00:06:47.600> yes
