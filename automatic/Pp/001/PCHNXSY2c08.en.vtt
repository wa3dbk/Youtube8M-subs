00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 hello how about friends talking here with another 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:07.830
 video review and this time I bring you nothing 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:11.280
 more and nothing less than zero type 2 of 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:14.400
 mega man x men x depending on how 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.890
 purists be you of the arts of 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.390
 bands and this is friends forgive 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.789
 That I am here 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:25.220
 manipulating the box but then we can 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:28.080
 see that this 0 is an update of 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:30.660
 the version of diabetes that we had already 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.630
 seen previously because it does not 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.930
 different then simply that this is 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:39.450
 the version after the ex cons 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:41.399
 they were putting it together and they did some 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.860
 modifications 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:47.160
 to the original design of Dr. Willy 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:50.910
 true and good here we can see that 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:54.090
 mainly their differences are that 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:57.210
 already has some modifications to his 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:01.469
 armor and that brings his saber z truth 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:05.460
 this the well-known and characteristic 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.710
 sable z of the good friend 0 who turned 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.950
 a 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:15.170
 something holder of the character after 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:18.530
 megaman x2 that was the title in which 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:20.390
 he debuted in this incarnation already after 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.850
 he was made some other 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.490
 modifications like the mega man x4 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:28.320
 etcetera etcetera but good if you 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.130
 they want to see how different it is 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.610
 the 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:36.670
 first of arts that came out of zero here 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:40.380
 It is for you to see one 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:44.020
 comparison from side to side is 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:48.490
 now he has the cannon in another in the 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:50.799
 another hand because I made a display 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:54.100
 good in my room where I have them 

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:55.899
 exhibited this and there it is then the 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.689
 modifications are basically that has 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:02:01.390
 the shoulder pads that has the collar 

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:05.170
 yellow that is here has some 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:07.590
 ventilated instead of this one of these 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:11.380
 yellow lines yellow lines on your 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:14.560
 underpants this the yellow lines to 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:17.019
 who in their boots and well basically 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.420
 is everything and that apart it has the 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:22.510
 vents on his head shoulder pads 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:25.209
 etcetera the possibility is still the 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:27.579
 same the level of fun is still 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:28.460
 the same and you can exchange 

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:32.390
 the 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:35.180
 parts to make it more faithful 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:38.960
 some pose that you want and in addition 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:42.770
 brings the inclusion of your powerful and well 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:45.500
 there has been saber zeta that if you are a 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:48.350
 thing to say is that because in 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.420
 the joints coming off very very 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:54.020
 easily but if you want it 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:59.140
 zafar remove the tip 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:59.140
 and remove the saber 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:05.349
 all over here 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:08.890
 in this way is and besides you 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:10.930
 place the tip that comes with three 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:14.980
 different saber accessories if 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:19.269
 you notice this is pq of mowaa or 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:22.590
 be for collectors for whom 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:26.860
 they want to exhibit their zero with the sword 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:32.069
 growing I say this pointed and pointy 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:32.069
 that is to say with a Japanese sword 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:40.269
 wake went flying to the parties by 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:43.690
 all sides and also has a saber that 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:45.130
 it ends chatito finish round this 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:48.340
 it's still as pointed 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:49.810
 so I do not know what the point is but 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:51.790
 This is for example when it is more 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:55.299
 ready for battle and this is when 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:57.190
 is in a neutral position and so on 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:04:00.459
 come come in different little hands brings 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:03.459
 different expression expressions here 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:05.019
 are looking sideways is they are very 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:06.190
 similar to those that came with the 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:08.250
 First 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:11.260
 of diabetes 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:17.479
 here is screaming 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:19.970
 remembrando aa poor girlfriend iris and 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:23.360
 if you remember from the mega 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:26.120
 man x4 he also has a booster a 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:28.190
 booster cannon that is different to its 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:32.560
 first incarnation and right now I know 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:32.560
 we can put but also 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:40.090
 also what it brings is a sword 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:40.090
 growing 

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:48.440
 in this way that is how it is 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:50.660
 pulling the full hug is saying yes 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:53.350
 you can put it here this looks 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:59.960
 great but it's a little harder 

00:04:53.350 --> 00:05:03.740
 pass it with this one with the saber because 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:07.130
 precisely because it is a little heavier 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:10.580
 has more mass then that makes it a 

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:13.220
 little more difficult the possibility is the 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:15.530
 same level of fun is the same 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:18.260
 than the previous one of arts but I think that 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:21.140
 this one is very worthwhile because it is 

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:24.440
 very very good if you want yours 

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:28.100
 go with my friend come ask what 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:32.270

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:36.200
 your store like that is 23 points sites 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:39.110
 prodigy mx this is an incredible package 

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:41.090
 it's really worth it in any 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:43.520
 megaman collection and talking about 

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:47.680

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:08.810
 figures that are removed everything is done
