00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:41.389 
part of that and well I mean that is a

00:03:41.389 --> 00:03:43.270 
part of that and well I mean that is a
sort<00:03:41.660> of<00:03:41.690> satirical<00:03:42.169> topical<00:03:42.889> show<00:03:43.069> and

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
sort of satirical topical show and

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:44.559 
sort of satirical topical show and
radioactive<00:03:43.699> goes<00:03:43.940> more<00:03:44.209> for<00:03:44.389> sort<00:03:44.510> of

00:03:44.559 --> 00:03:44.569 
radioactive goes more for sort of

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:48.039 
radioactive goes more for sort of
general<00:03:44.959> social<00:03:45.379> chatter<00:03:45.970> and<00:03:46.970> but<00:03:47.359> it<00:03:47.480> can<00:03:47.930> be

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:48.049 
general social chatter and but it can be

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:49.900 
general social chatter and but it can be
it<00:03:48.230> can<00:03:48.290> be<00:03:48.500> quite<00:03:48.650> hard<00:03:48.859> I<00:03:49.040> think<00:03:49.220> so<00:03:49.730> how<00:03:49.849> do

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:49.910 
it can be quite hard I think so how do

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:52.119 
it can be quite hard I think so how do
you<00:03:50.139> jump<00:03:51.139> between<00:03:51.319> the<00:03:51.590> two<00:03:51.739> because<00:03:51.919> you<00:03:52.010> had

00:03:52.119 --> 00:03:52.129 
you jump between the two because you had

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:53.439 
you jump between the two because you had
to<00:03:52.160> tip<00:03:52.340> where<00:03:52.519> two<00:03:52.669> different<00:03:52.699> hats<00:03:53.120> don't

00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:53.449 
to tip where two different hats don't

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:55.990 
to tip where two different hats don't
you<00:03:53.620> well<00:03:54.620> we<00:03:54.709> did<00:03:54.829> do<00:03:55.010> at<00:03:55.099> the<00:03:55.190> same<00:03:55.370> time<00:03:55.609> so

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000

think<00:05:27.740> maybe<00:05:27.860> our<00:05:28.100> humor<00:05:28.400> is<00:05:28.520> just<00:05:28.700> different

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:28.850 
think maybe our humor is just different

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:30.250 
think maybe our humor is just different
and<00:05:29.030> it<00:05:29.150> just<00:05:29.300> doesn't<00:05:29.510> go<00:05:29.600> down<00:05:29.630> so<00:05:29.930> well<00:05:29.960> over

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:30.260

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:31.960 
and it just doesn't go down so well over
there<00:05:30.560> well<00:05:31.340> I<00:05:31.370> don't<00:05:31.520> think<00:05:31.640> that's<00:05:31.880> true

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:31.970 
there well I don't think that's true

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:33.550 
there well I don't think that's true

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:37.280 
as they did in london so there wasn't

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:38.830 
as they did in london so there wasn't
