00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
so you don't want to talk too much but

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.580 
so you don't want to talk too much but
if<00:01:05.309> you<00:01:05.430> push<00:01:05.670> a<00:01:05.700> directional<00:01:06.450> on<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.930> left<00:01:07.470> or

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
if you push a directional on the left or

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.789 
if you push a directional on the left or
right<00:01:07.619> on<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:07.950> analog<00:01:08.310> wall<00:01:08.689> pushing<00:01:09.689> our<00:01:10.229> 2rl

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
right on the analog wall pushing our 2rl

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.289 
right on the analog wall pushing our 2rl
to<00:01:11.010> you<00:01:11.130> can<00:01:11.250> see<00:01:11.369> I<00:01:11.430> can<00:01:11.460> do<00:01:11.729> left<00:01:12.000> and<00:01:12.180> right

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
to you can see I can do left and right

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.480 
to you can see I can do left and right
hooks<00:01:12.510> I<00:01:12.810> can<00:01:12.960> do<00:01:13.049> uppercuts<00:01:13.590> I<00:01:13.799> push<00:01:14.010> up<00:01:14.189> in

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
hooks I can do uppercuts I push up in

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.640 
hooks I can do uppercuts I push up in
the<00:01:14.610> l2<00:01:14.909> button<00:01:16.580> so<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:18.090> idea<00:01:18.240> is<00:01:18.540> to<00:01:19.049> do<00:01:19.409> some

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
the l2 button so the idea is to do some

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.590 
the l2 button so the idea is to do some
good<00:01:19.680> combos<00:01:20.280> and<00:01:20.549> then<00:01:20.759> follow<00:01:21.030> up<00:01:21.240> with<00:01:21.270> the

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
good combos and then follow up with the

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.359 
good combos and then follow up with the
heart<00:01:21.990> attack<00:01:22.229> so<00:01:22.470> you<00:01:22.560> can<00:01:22.680> see<00:01:22.860> there<00:01:23.040> it's

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
heart attack so you can see there it's

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:24.950 
heart attack so you can see there it's
almost<00:01:23.580> like<00:01:23.759> our<00:01:23.909> people<00:01:24.240> man<00:01:24.540> like<00:01:24.720> gloves

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:47.600 
you'll still take slight damage and your
stand<00:01:46.770> when<00:01:46.860> it<00:01:46.950> goes<00:01:47.100> down<00:01:47.130> when<00:01:47.490> you're

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
stand when it goes down when you're

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.240 
stand when it goes down when you're
blocking<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.899> best<00:01:49.170> I<00:01:49.350> found<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:49.799> best<00:01:49.979> way

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
blocking the best I found the best way

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.850 
blocking the best I found the best way
to<00:01:50.640> I<00:01:50.880> guess<00:01:51.060> avoid<00:01:51.450> getting<00:01:51.750> hit<00:01:52.020> or<00:01:52.259> the

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
to I guess avoid getting hit or the

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.710 
to I guess avoid getting hit or the
defense<00:01:53.250> is<00:01:53.490> just<00:01:53.670> literally<00:01:54.030> to<00:01:54.270> sidestep

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
defense is just literally to sidestep

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.440 
defense is just literally to sidestep
like<00:01:54.930> this<00:01:55.110> because<00:01:55.350> he<00:01:56.189> gets<00:01:56.340> left<00:01:56.579> open<00:01:57.030> so

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
like this because he gets left open so

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.010 
like this because he gets left open so
many<00:01:57.659> times<00:01:58.219> and<00:01:59.219> it's<00:01:59.820> way<00:02:00.060> easier<00:02:00.540> to<00:02:00.780> come

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
many times and it's way easier to come

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:07.060 
many times and it's way easier to come
in<00:02:01.170> and<00:02:01.320> do<00:02:01.740> some<00:02:01.920> damage<00:02:02.100> Oh

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.290 

so<00:02:08.070> you<00:02:08.130> actually<00:02:08.340> there's<00:02:08.880> a<00:02:08.940> little<00:02:09.090> bit<00:02:09.240> of

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800

just<00:02:35.010> as<00:02:35.130> strong<00:02:35.370> as<00:02:35.520> all<00:02:35.640> these<00:02:35.760> beasts<00:02:36.350> and

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
just as strong as all these beasts and

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.710 
just as strong as all these beasts and
graphically<00:02:38.700> the<00:02:38.730> game<00:02:38.820> looks<00:02:39.120> good<00:02:39.360> I<00:02:39.540> mean

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
graphically the game looks good I mean

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.449 
graphically the game looks good I mean
the<00:02:39.810> frame<00:02:40.020> rate<00:02:40.170> is<00:02:40.350> really<00:02:40.500> high<00:02:40.590> characters

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
the frame rate is really high characters

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:43.280 
the frame rate is really high characters
do<00:02:41.610> look<00:02:41.760> a<00:02:41.790> little<00:02:41.850> bit<00:02:42.090> blocky<00:02:42.270> so<00:02:42.720> there's

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
do look a little bit blocky so there's

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.080 
do look a little bit blocky so there's
not<00:02:43.440> too<00:02:43.590> much<00:02:43.739> as<00:02:43.950> far<00:02:44.130> as<00:02:44.310> I<00:02:44.489> guess<00:02:44.610> polygons

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
not too much as far as I guess polygons

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.900 
not too much as far as I guess polygons
but<00:02:45.989> the<00:02:46.739> textures<00:02:47.130> themselves<00:02:47.580> look<00:02:47.730> pretty

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
but the textures themselves look pretty

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.790 
but the textures themselves look pretty
cool<00:02:48.090> it's<00:02:48.330> like<00:02:48.450> all<00:02:48.660> hand-drawn<00:02:49.230> art<00:02:49.440> and<00:02:49.709> it

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
cool it's like all hand-drawn art and it

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.320 
cool it's like all hand-drawn art and it
looks<00:02:50.010> it<00:02:50.310> looks<00:02:50.400> really<00:02:50.670> really<00:02:50.910> nice<00:02:51.030> as<00:02:51.239> a
