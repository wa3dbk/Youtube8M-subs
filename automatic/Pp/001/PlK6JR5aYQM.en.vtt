00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:36.830 
going to do in this jump you can add the

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:39.430 
going to do in this jump you can add the
item<00:00:37.250> that<00:00:37.280> you<00:00:37.520> want<00:00:37.550> to<00:00:37.820> use<00:00:38.000> for<00:00:38.440> that

item that you want to use for that

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.049

you're going to sell in the shop and you
add<00:00:41.239> item<00:00:41.839> that<00:00:42.260> is<00:00:42.589> the<00:00:43.040> currency<00:00:43.370> according

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.530 
to me it's called a gift because that's

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.070 
to me it's called a gift because that's
more<00:00:45.769> reasonable<00:00:46.190> because<00:00:46.699> you<00:00:46.909> get<00:00:47.000> 49<00:00:47.510> out

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:48.080 
more reasonable because you get 49 out

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.939 
more reasonable because you get 49 out
of<00:00:48.110> one<00:00:48.500> gold<00:00:48.860> ingot<00:00:49.220> so<00:00:50.210> I'm<00:00:50.330> thinking<00:00:50.360> about

00:00:50.939 --> 00:00:50.949 
of one gold ingot so I'm thinking about

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:54.280 
of one gold ingot so I'm thinking about
the<00:00:51.949> multi-currency<00:00:52.790> you<00:00:53.479> can<00:00:53.659> use<00:00:53.839> how<00:00:54.229> many

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:54.290 
the multi-currency you can use how many

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:56.799 
the multi-currency you can use how many
items<00:00:54.559> you<00:00:54.830> wish<00:00:55.129> or<00:00:55.580> currency<00:00:56.299> but<00:00:56.479> there's

00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:56.809 
items you wish or currency but there's

00:00:56.809 --> 00:00:58.899 
items you wish or currency but there's
many<00:00:57.019> bugs<00:00:57.350> with<00:00:57.620> that<00:00:57.799> so<00:00:58.100> I<00:00:58.129> don't<00:00:58.489> get<00:00:58.760> it

00:00:58.899 --> 00:00:58.909 
many bugs with that so I don't get it

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:01.899 
many bugs with that so I don't get it
all<00:00:59.629> right<00:00:59.949> to<00:01:00.949> make<00:01:01.100> this<00:01:01.250> chap<00:01:01.519> is<00:01:01.670> very

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:01.909 
all right to make this chap is very

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:04.000 
all right to make this chap is very
fairly<00:01:02.510> simple<00:01:03.080> you're<00:01:03.409> going<00:01:03.559> to<00:01:03.620> place<00:01:03.799> two

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.010 
fairly simple you're going to place two

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.330 
fairly simple you're going to place two
blocks<00:01:04.159> or<00:01:04.610> have<00:01:05.299> a<00:01:05.330> wall<00:01:05.600> behind<00:01:06.220> depends<00:01:07.220> on

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
blocks or have a wall behind depends on

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.640 
blocks or have a wall behind depends on
where<00:01:07.670> you're<00:01:07.820> doing<00:01:08.210> this<00:01:08.360> face<00:01:09.170> your<00:01:09.350> chest

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:09.650 
where you're doing this face your chest

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:14.080 
where you're doing this face your chest
if<00:01:10.010> you<00:01:10.220> don't<00:01:10.430> want<00:01:10.700> a<00:01:10.880> a<00:01:12.550> item<00:01:13.550> shop<00:01:13.910> you
