everyone on my golden cube just arrived
in<00:00:05.759> the<00:00:05.910> mail<00:00:06.799> right<00:00:07.799> here<00:00:07.980> and<00:00:08.510> I'm<00:00:09.510> going<00:00:09.929> to

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
review of it and hopefully try to solve

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.260 
review of it and hopefully try to solve
it<00:00:14.910> before<00:00:15.030> the<00:00:15.570> days<00:00:15.780> over<00:00:15.990> which<00:00:16.949> is

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:17.270 
it before the days over which is

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:22.880 
it before the days over which is
unlikely<00:00:18.270> but<00:00:18.449> it<00:00:19.080> could<00:00:19.380> happen<00:00:19.609> so<00:00:21.769> here<00:00:22.769> we

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
unlikely but it could happen so here we

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:38.450 
unlikely but it could happen so here we
go<00:00:22.920> I<00:00:35.480> know<00:00:36.480> how<00:00:36.600> to<00:00:36.660> open<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.649> box<00:00:37.890> properly

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
go I know how to open the box properly

trying to take the plastic off move it
carefully<00:01:45.310> all<00:01:46.310> right<00:01:46.429> there<00:01:46.579> we<00:01:46.609> go<00:01:48.670> all

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
carefully all right there we go all

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.039 
carefully all right there we go all
right<00:01:49.849> so<00:01:50.709> yeah<00:01:51.709> this<00:01:51.920> is<00:01:52.129> big<00:01:52.879> hold<00:01:53.780> on<00:01:53.840> a<00:01:53.869> sec

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:54.049 
right so yeah this is big hold on a sec

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:56.350 
right so yeah this is big hold on a sec
let<00:01:54.079> me<00:01:54.229> go<00:01:54.439> get<00:01:54.979> mine<00:01:55.159> v<00:01:55.459> keep<00:01:55.640> seven<00:01:56.030> as<00:01:56.299> a

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
let me go get mine v keep seven as a

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:09.430 
let me go get mine v keep seven as a
comparison<00:02:01.450> all<00:02:02.450> right<00:02:02.629> so<00:02:05.619> yeah<00:02:07.149> it's<00:02:08.440> like

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
comparison all right so yeah it's like

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.199 
comparison all right so yeah it's like
if<00:02:09.560> you<00:02:09.679> thought<00:02:09.859> the<00:02:09.950> v-cube<00:02:10.190> 7<00:02:10.609> was<00:02:10.759> big<00:02:10.970> then

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:11.209 
if you thought the v-cube 7 was big then

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:13.300 
if you thought the v-cube 7 was big then
you<00:02:11.420> know<00:02:11.510> you<00:02:11.599> haven't<00:02:11.900> seen<00:02:12.049> anything<00:02:12.310> does

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
you know you haven't seen anything does

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.990 
you know you haven't seen anything does
this<00:02:13.489> looks<00:02:13.790> like<00:02:13.940> it's<00:02:14.120> a<00:02:14.180> full<00:02:14.480> layer<00:02:16.000> taller

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
this looks like it's a full layer taller

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.309 
this looks like it's a full layer taller
well<00:02:17.629> not<00:02:17.810> not<00:02:18.109> maybe<00:02:18.379> not<00:02:18.560> Ella<00:02:19.239> they're

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:20.319 
well not not maybe not Ella they're

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:23.650 
well not not maybe not Ella they're
comparable<00:02:21.849> but<00:02:22.849> i<00:02:22.880> still<00:02:23.239> think<00:02:23.299> just<00:02:23.569> a

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
comparable but i still think just a

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:24.940 
comparable but i still think just a
little<00:02:23.840> bit<00:02:23.930> bigger<00:02:24.170> just<00:02:24.349> cuz<00:02:24.500> the<00:02:24.680> cube

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
little bit bigger just cuz the cube

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:33.400 
little bit bigger just cuz the cube
shape<00:02:25.780> um<00:02:28.269> yeah<00:02:29.269> oh<00:02:31.720> yeah<00:02:32.720> this<00:02:32.900> looks<00:02:33.079> really

this is smooth this is puzzles supposed

00:03:51.630 --> 00:04:07.130 
this is smooth this is puzzles supposed
to<00:03:51.750> turn<00:03:51.930> like<00:04:05.480> all<00:04:06.480> right<00:04:06.660> I'm<00:04:06.810> going<00:04:06.900> to<00:04:06.989> mix

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
to turn like all right I'm going to mix

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:13.040 
to turn like all right I'm going to mix
it<00:04:07.290> up<00:04:07.380> right<00:04:07.620> here<00:04:07.830> and<00:04:09.500> then<00:04:11.360> I'll<00:04:12.360> finish

it up right here and then I'll finish
this<00:04:13.560> video<00:04:13.980> if<00:04:14.130> I<00:04:14.220> ever<00:04:14.340> get<00:04:14.580> this<00:04:14.730> thing

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
this video if I ever get this thing

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:21.830 
this video if I ever get this thing
solved<00:04:17.030> so<00:04:20.209> you<00:04:21.209> have<00:04:21.329> to<00:04:21.450> make<00:04:21.570> like<00:04:21.750> a

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
solved so you have to make like a

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.130 
solved so you have to make like a
half-turn<00:04:22.350> first<00:04:22.830> before<00:04:23.220> you<00:04:23.310> can<00:04:23.430> start

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:24.140 
half-turn first before you can start

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:51.540 
half-turn first before you can start
mixing<00:04:25.140> it<00:04:25.410> up

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.550 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:54.810 

this<00:04:52.210> is<00:04:52.420> going<00:04:52.630> to<00:04:52.690> be<00:04:52.810> interesting<00:04:53.740> to<00:04:54.670> try

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:54.820 
this is going to be interesting to try

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:59.940 
this is going to be interesting to try
and<00:04:55.000> figure<00:04:55.180> out<00:04:55.330> how<00:04:55.540> to<00:04:55.600> fix<00:04:56.440> this<00:04:58.560> so<00:04:59.560> I'm

00:04:59.940 --> 00:04:59.950 
and figure out how to fix this so I'm

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:01.530 
and figure out how to fix this so I'm
going<00:05:00.100> to<00:05:00.130> go<00:05:00.280> and<00:05:00.460> try<00:05:00.910> to<00:05:00.970> figure<00:05:01.240> this<00:05:01.390> out

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:01.540 
going to go and try to figure this out

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:04.950 
going to go and try to figure this out
right<00:05:01.720> now<00:05:02.910> alright<00:05:03.910> so<00:05:04.300> it's<00:05:04.390> been<00:05:04.600> a<00:05:04.630> little

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 
right now alright so it's been a little

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.340 
right now alright so it's been a little
over<00:05:05.170> three<00:05:05.530> and<00:05:05.560> a<00:05:05.650> half<00:05:05.680> hours<00:05:06.960> of<00:05:07.960> trying<00:05:08.200> to

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:08.350 
over three and a half hours of trying to

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:09.960 
over three and a half hours of trying to
figure<00:05:08.560> this<00:05:08.710> out<00:05:08.890> and<00:05:09.160> it<00:05:09.400> wasn't<00:05:09.580> three<00:05:09.880> and

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:09.970 
figure this out and it wasn't three and

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:12.810 
figure this out and it wasn't three and
a<00:05:10.000> half<00:05:10.030> hours<00:05:10.450> straight<00:05:11.010> it<00:05:12.010> was<00:05:12.220> about<00:05:12.490> an

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:12.820 
a half hours straight it was about an

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:15.930 
a half hours straight it was about an
hour<00:05:13.060> and<00:05:13.510> then<00:05:14.470> I<00:05:14.890> got<00:05:15.310> a<00:05:15.340> really<00:05:15.670> bad

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:15.940 
hour and then I got a really bad

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:17.310 
hour and then I got a really bad
headache<00:05:16.180> so<00:05:16.540> I<00:05:16.570> went<00:05:16.750> out<00:05:16.870> to<00:05:16.960> play<00:05:17.080> some

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:17.320 
headache so I went out to play some

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:20.490 
headache so I went out to play some
tennis<00:05:17.470> that's<00:05:17.830> one<00:05:18.150> in<00:05:19.150> this<00:05:19.660> and<00:05:19.960> kind<00:05:20.350> of

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:20.500 
tennis that's one in this and kind of

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:26.330 
tennis that's one in this and kind of
sweaty<00:05:20.740> um<00:05:21.930> and<00:05:22.930> then<00:05:23.620> I<00:05:23.710> got<00:05:23.860> home<00:05:24.130> and<00:05:24.190> about

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:26.340 
sweaty um and then I got home and about

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:31.800 
sweaty um and then I got home and about
30<00:05:27.340> minutes<00:05:27.640> after<00:05:27.790> that<00:05:28.120> I<00:05:28.410> finally<00:05:30.810> solved

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:31.810 
30 minutes after that I finally solved

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:40.320 
30 minutes after that I finally solved
it<00:05:32.370> um<00:05:33.480> I<00:05:35.250> will<00:05:36.250> go<00:05:37.110> into<00:05:38.110> saying<00:05:39.100> that<00:05:39.460> this<00:05:40.030> is

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:40.330 
it um I will go into saying that this is

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:42.840 
it um I will go into saying that this is
probably<00:05:40.720> the<00:05:40.990> hardest<00:05:41.050> puzzle<00:05:41.500> i<00:05:41.710> have<00:05:41.950> just

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:42.850 
probably the hardest puzzle i have just

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:47.520 
probably the hardest puzzle i have just
because<00:05:43.300> some<00:05:44.290> of<00:05:44.320> the<00:05:44.500> pieces<00:05:45.420> look<00:05:46.530> exactly

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:47.530 
because some of the pieces look exactly

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:49.530 
because some of the pieces look exactly
like<00:05:47.560> each<00:05:47.890> other<00:05:48.040> and<00:05:48.250> there's<00:05:48.460> like<00:05:48.970> little

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:49.540 
like each other and there's like little

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:54.870 
like each other and there's like little
miniscule<00:05:50.820> things<00:05:51.820> that<00:05:52.210> are<00:05:52.500> that<00:05:53.500> that<00:05:54.490> tell

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:54.880 
miniscule things that are that that tell

00:05:54.880 --> 00:06:00.000 
miniscule things that are that that tell
you<00:05:55.620> which<00:05:56.620> piece<00:05:57.010> is<00:05:57.040> which<00:05:57.490> and<00:05:58.500> i<00:05:59.500> had<00:05:59.890> to

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:00.010 
you which piece is which and i had to

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:03.090 
you which piece is which and i had to
refer<00:06:00.280> back<00:06:00.490> to<00:06:00.550> my<00:06:00.760> Scoob<00:06:01.090> ultimate<00:06:02.100> to

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:03.100 
refer back to my Scoob ultimate to

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:05.670 
refer back to my Scoob ultimate to
figure<00:06:04.030> out<00:06:04.150> how<00:06:04.240> to<00:06:04.300> solve<00:06:04.540> this<00:06:04.810> because<00:06:05.380> the

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:05.680 
figure out how to solve this because the

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:08.580 
figure out how to solve this because the
sku<00:06:05.950> ultimate<00:06:06.400> is<00:06:06.900> basically<00:06:07.900> the<00:06:08.020> base<00:06:08.230> of

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:08.590 
sku ultimate is basically the base of

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:10.410 
sku ultimate is basically the base of
solving<00:06:08.980> this<00:06:09.100> because<00:06:09.490> this<00:06:09.940> hue<00:06:10.210> and<00:06:10.360> the

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:10.420 
solving this because this hue and the

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:12.960 
solving this because this hue and the
skew<00:06:10.660> boldmann<00:06:10.990> the<00:06:11.350> golden<00:06:11.800> cube<00:06:12.100> have<00:06:12.790> the

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:12.970 
skew boldmann the golden cube have the

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:14.280 
skew boldmann the golden cube have the
same<00:06:13.150> mechanism<00:06:13.720> it's<00:06:13.840> all<00:06:13.960> the<00:06:14.050> ski

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:14.290 
same mechanism it's all the ski

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:18.030 
same mechanism it's all the ski
mechanism<00:06:15.300> but<00:06:16.300> this<00:06:17.200> is<00:06:17.380> more<00:06:17.530> like<00:06:17.590> the<00:06:17.830> skew

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:18.040 
mechanism but this is more like the skew

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:21.570 
mechanism but this is more like the skew
ultimate<00:06:18.460> than<00:06:18.610> the<00:06:18.700> ski<00:06:18.940> because<00:06:19.150> I<00:06:19.690> each<00:06:20.590> big

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:21.580 
ultimate than the ski because I each big

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:24.660 
ultimate than the ski because I each big
center<00:06:22.300> piece<00:06:22.740> has<00:06:23.740> to<00:06:23.890> be<00:06:23.950> oriented<00:06:24.250> properly

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:24.670 
center piece has to be oriented properly

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:27.930 
center piece has to be oriented properly
and<00:06:25.060> I<00:06:25.390> had<00:06:26.320> to<00:06:26.500> look<00:06:27.070> at<00:06:27.220> the<00:06:27.280> skew<00:06:27.520> ultimate

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:27.940 
and I had to look at the skew ultimate

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:29.670 
and I had to look at the skew ultimate
to<00:06:28.090> figure<00:06:28.630> out<00:06:28.690> how<00:06:28.780> to<00:06:28.840> flip<00:06:29.110> him<00:06:29.290> and<00:06:29.470> stuff

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:29.680 
to figure out how to flip him and stuff

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:34.020 
to figure out how to flip him and stuff
and<00:06:30.030> move<00:06:31.030> them<00:06:31.180> around<00:06:31.240> um<00:06:32.370> if<00:06:33.370> i<00:06:33.520> mix<00:06:33.730> this<00:06:33.880> up

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:34.030 
and move them around um if i mix this up

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:35.730 
and move them around um if i mix this up
again<00:06:34.330> I<00:06:34.540> don't<00:06:34.720> know<00:06:34.900> if<00:06:35.080> I'd<00:06:35.200> be<00:06:35.230> able<00:06:35.380> to<00:06:35.560> do

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:35.740 
again I don't know if I'd be able to do

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:40.410 
again I don't know if I'd be able to do
it<00:06:35.890> any<00:06:36.010> faster<00:06:36.900> um<00:06:38.400> I<00:06:39.400> got<00:06:39.880> a<00:06:39.910> little<00:06:40.210> bit

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:40.420 
it any faster um I got a little bit

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:43.320 
it any faster um I got a little bit
lucky<00:06:40.780> at<00:06:40.900> the<00:06:40.960> end<00:06:41.200> because<00:06:42.070> i<00:06:42.430> was<00:06:42.610> just<00:06:42.820> kind

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:43.330 
lucky at the end because i was just kind

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:46.860 
lucky at the end because i was just kind
of<00:06:43.510> guessing<00:06:43.810> a<00:06:44.170> little<00:06:44.620> bit<00:06:45.210> like<00:06:46.210> educated

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:46.870 
of guessing a little bit like educated

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:49.020 
of guessing a little bit like educated
guessing<00:06:47.350> guesstimating<00:06:48.070> what<00:06:48.670> are<00:06:48.760> going<00:06:48.970> to

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:49.030 
guessing guesstimating what are going to

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:56.790 
guessing guesstimating what are going to
call<00:06:49.180> it<00:06:49.410> but<00:06:50.610> yeah<00:06:51.780> so<00:06:53.310> um<00:06:54.750> if<00:06:55.750> you<00:06:56.440> want<00:06:56.680> a

00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:56.800 
call it but yeah so um if you want a

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.100 
call it but yeah so um if you want a
challenge<00:06:57.070> you<00:06:57.340> should<00:06:58.180> definitely<00:06:58.420> get<00:06:58.900> one

00:06:59.100 --> 00:06:59.110 
challenge you should definitely get one

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:02.480 
challenge you should definitely get one
of<00:06:59.200> these<00:06:59.290> because<00:06:59.980> they're<00:07:00.690> really<00:07:01.690> smooth

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:02.490 
of these because they're really smooth

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:04.260 
of these because they're really smooth
like

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:04.270 
like

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:06.840 
like
I'm<00:07:04.720> not<00:07:04.870> a<00:07:05.230> pain<00:07:05.740> to<00:07:05.980> move<00:07:06.430> around<00:07:06.580> or

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:06.850 
I'm not a pain to move around or

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:08.550 
I'm not a pain to move around or
anything<00:07:06.910> like<00:07:07.450> you<00:07:07.570> don't<00:07:07.750> feel<00:07:07.930> like<00:07:08.020> spring

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:08.560 
anything like you don't feel like spring

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:16.020 
anything like you don't feel like spring
your<00:07:08.980> arms<00:07:09.520> and<00:07:10.530> stuff<00:07:11.610> um<00:07:14.550> but<00:07:15.550> yeah<00:07:15.730> if<00:07:15.880> you

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:16.030 
your arms and stuff um but yeah if you

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:17.580 
your arms and stuff um but yeah if you
want<00:07:16.210> to<00:07:16.300> challenge<00:07:16.510> this<00:07:16.900> is<00:07:17.050> definitely<00:07:17.500> we

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:17.590 
want to challenge this is definitely we

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:21.900 
want to challenge this is definitely we
usually<00:07:17.860> get<00:07:18.010> because<00:07:18.310> this<00:07:18.610> is<00:07:18.880> a<00:07:19.680> hard<00:07:20.910> beast
