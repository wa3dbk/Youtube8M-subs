years<00:01:20.280> from<00:01:20.549> now<00:01:20.700> that<00:01:20.759> was<00:01:21.299> a<00:01:21.330> crazy<00:01:21.780> jump

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
years from now that was a crazy jump

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.940 
years from now that was a crazy jump
Leigh<00:01:23.600> they<00:01:24.600> expect<00:01:24.930> it<00:01:25.049> to<00:01:25.170> supernova<00:01:25.740> okay

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
Leigh they expect it to supernova okay

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.310 
Leigh they expect it to supernova okay
just<00:01:26.280> no<00:01:26.549> real<00:01:26.820> pinpoint<00:01:27.390> on<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.840> date<00:01:28.020> there

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
just no real pinpoint on the date there

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.600 
just no real pinpoint on the date there
but<00:01:28.590> it<00:01:28.680> could<00:01:28.710> be<00:01:28.829> any<00:01:28.950> time<00:01:29.159> within<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.460> next

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
but it could be any time within the next

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:30.950 
but it could be any time within the next
five<00:01:29.909> hundred<00:01:30.210> thousand<00:01:30.540> years<00:01:30.720> yeah

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
five hundred thousand years yeah

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.899 
five hundred thousand years yeah
terrifying<00:01:31.829> isn't<00:01:32.130> it<00:01:32.400> don't<00:01:32.579> you<00:01:32.700> mention

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
terrifying isn't it don't you mention

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.190 
terrifying isn't it don't you mention
we're<00:01:33.180> looking<00:01:33.420> at<00:01:33.540> a<00:01:33.570> star<00:01:33.840> about<00:01:34.020> eight

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
we're looking at a star about eight

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.810 
we're looking at a star about eight
thousand<00:01:34.650> light<00:01:34.799> years<00:01:34.829> away<00:01:35.130> pop<00:01:35.490> that<00:01:35.700> with

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
thousand light years away pop that with

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.370 
thousand light years away pop that with
gamma<00:01:36.090> rays<00:01:36.299> and<00:01:36.329> optical<00:01:36.840> photons<00:01:36.990> and

oh<00:02:03.270> but<00:02:03.719> if<00:02:03.840> it<00:02:04.020> does<00:02:04.259> gamma<00:02:04.829> ray<00:02:08.509> you<00:02:09.509> don't

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
oh but if it does gamma ray you don't

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.200 
oh but if it does gamma ray you don't
know<00:02:10.140> what<00:02:10.319> gamma<00:02:10.530> rays<00:02:10.770> are<00:02:10.800> doing
