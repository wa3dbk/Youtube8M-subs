00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
later will but the 56 later we'll still

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.049 
later will but the 56 later we'll still
have<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.620> age<00:00:49.829> pattern<00:00:50.219> you<00:00:50.640> can<00:00:50.820> buy<00:00:51.000> the

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
this shape right here is not going to be

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.049 
this shape right here is not going to be
there<00:00:55.559> it's<00:00:56.370> going<00:00:56.520> to<00:00:56.579> look<00:00:56.699> more<00:00:56.879> like<00:00:56.940> a

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
there it's going to look more like a

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.700 
there it's going to look more like a
later<00:00:57.300> bug<00:00:57.570> you're<00:00:58.140> not<00:00:58.230> gonna<00:00:58.320> have<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.530> H

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
later bug you're not gonna have the H

00:00:58.710 --> 00:00:59.840 
later bug you're not gonna have the H
pattern<00:00:59.010> and<00:00:59.280> it's<00:00:59.399> one<00:00:59.550> thing<00:00:59.730> that

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
pattern and it's one thing that

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.849 
pattern and it's one thing that
collectors<00:01:00.270> look<00:01:00.480> at<00:01:00.629> they<00:01:01.199> want<00:01:01.469> to<00:01:01.559> see<00:01:01.680> that

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
collectors look at they want to see that

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.340 
collectors look at they want to see that
H<00:01:02.010> pattern<00:01:02.280> and<00:01:03.270> even<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.600> catch<00:01:03.840> is<00:01:04.170> not

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
H pattern and even the catch is not

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.719 
H pattern and even the catch is not
gonna<00:01:04.500> be<00:01:04.680> there<00:01:04.920> so<00:01:05.960> what<00:01:06.960> I<00:01:06.990> do<00:01:07.430> for<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.549> most

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
gonna be there so what I do for the most

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.140 
gonna be there so what I do for the most
part<00:01:09.060> this<00:01:09.570> is<00:01:09.630> usually<00:01:10.080> in<00:01:10.470> good<00:01:10.680> shape<00:01:11.150> this

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
part this is usually in good shape this

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.940 
part this is usually in good shape this
H<00:01:12.360> pattern<00:01:12.630> this<00:01:12.930> as<00:01:13.200> you<00:01:13.380> can<00:01:13.530> see<00:01:13.680> here<00:01:13.830> like

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
H pattern this as you can see here like

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.820 
H pattern this as you can see here like
this<00:01:14.130> you<00:01:14.189> right<00:01:14.790> here<00:01:15.030> where<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.299> channel<00:01:15.659> is

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
new apron but then you use the old

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.510 
new apron but then you use the old
section<00:01:33.960> to<00:01:34.500> weld<00:01:34.680> on<00:01:34.829> to<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.070> new<00:01:35.220> section

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520

and<00:01:35.960> for<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.020> most<00:01:37.170> part<00:01:37.939> many<00:01:38.939> people<00:01:39.180> can't

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
and for the most part many people can't

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.710 
and for the most part many people can't
tell<00:01:39.540> if<00:01:39.810> you<00:01:39.960> have<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.590> 55<00:01:41.009> and<00:01:41.040> earlier<00:01:41.430> bugs

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
you can actually get some sheet metal to

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.219 
you can actually get some sheet metal to
cover<00:01:45.000> over<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.360> peashooters<00:01:45.960> if<00:01:46.110> you're

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
like I said even back here see that that

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.590 
like I said even back here see that that
actual<00:03:16.470> piece<00:03:16.740> is<00:03:16.950> pretty<00:03:17.220> good<00:03:17.460> here<00:03:17.820> but

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
actual piece is pretty good here but

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:20.150 
actual piece is pretty good here but
sometimes<00:03:18.990> it's<00:03:19.170> just<00:03:19.350> this<00:03:19.500> that's<00:03:19.770> right<00:03:19.920> it

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
sometimes it's just this that's right it

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:21.260 
sometimes it's just this that's right it
might<00:03:20.280> have<00:03:20.430> some<00:03:20.580> holes<00:03:20.790> in<00:03:20.970> it<00:03:21.030> you<00:03:21.150> can

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:21.270 
might have some holes in it you can

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:23.060 
might have some holes in it you can
actually<00:03:21.420> pry<00:03:21.720> off<00:03:21.900> that<00:03:22.080> piece<00:03:22.320> and<00:03:22.680> just<00:03:22.890> get

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
actually pry off that piece and just get

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:24.680 
actually pry off that piece and just get
that<00:03:23.220> piece<00:03:23.460> but<00:03:23.700> if<00:03:23.910> it's<00:03:24.090> really<00:03:24.330> bad<00:03:24.510> like

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
that piece but if it's really bad like

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.000 
that piece but if it's really bad like
we<00:03:24.810> saw<00:03:24.960> on<00:03:24.990> the<00:03:25.170> other<00:03:25.200> side<00:03:25.530> you<00:03:25.740> get<00:03:25.860> the

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
we saw on the other side you get the

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.910 
we saw on the other side you get the
whole<00:03:26.190> section<00:03:27.230> now<00:03:28.230> when<00:03:28.380> you<00:03:28.470> inspect<00:03:28.680> your

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
whole section now when you inspect your

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.370 
whole section now when you inspect your
heater<00:03:29.130> channels<00:03:29.580> you<00:03:30.300> know<00:03:30.330> sometimes<00:03:31.200> they

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
heater channels you know sometimes they

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.810 
heater channels you know sometimes they
might<00:03:31.620> be<00:03:31.800> nice<00:03:32.160> and<00:03:32.370> strong<00:03:32.640> on<00:03:32.940> the<00:03:33.540> inside

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:34.820 
might be nice and strong on the inside

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:37.520 
might be nice and strong on the inside
but<00:03:35.820> they're<00:03:36.210> kind<00:03:36.480> of<00:03:36.540> weak<00:03:36.750> on<00:03:36.990> the<00:03:37.110> outside

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
but they're kind of weak on the outside

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:38.960 
but they're kind of weak on the outside
here<00:03:37.770> where<00:03:38.010> the<00:03:38.100> running<00:03:38.370> board<00:03:38.550> bolts<00:03:38.820> into

here where the running board bolts into

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:40.460 
here where the running board bolts into
that's<00:03:39.600> why<00:03:39.750> we<00:03:39.870> want<00:03:40.020> to<00:03:40.080> take<00:03:40.230> off<00:03:40.380> our
