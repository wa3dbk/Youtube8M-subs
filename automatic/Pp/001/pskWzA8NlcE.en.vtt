00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 hi to everyone from word or the I am 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.710
 stefano poletti today I will talk about 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.260
 batteries in particular to get them 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.809
 batteries go which battery 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.610
 we'll talk about a today we can go to 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.789
 buy instead of the classic 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:22.010
 and ml 14 degrees with byrne and at 14 to 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.010
 battery that mount the Nikon SLRs 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:31.019
 d3100 of 3,200 5,100 5,200 and also the 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:38.399
 ultra compact or compact at all times 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:41.730
 nikon p7000 p7100 ep 7700 le n at 14 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:44.070
 to the battery very resistant both to 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.809
 environmental factors that use 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.539
 to intensive use 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.329
 I used it at very high temperatures 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.899
 low around at least 18 minus 20 degrees e 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.199
 I have not accused any reduction 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:56.910
 autonomy 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.430
 I have to say that I stayed a lot 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.949
 surprised by this I did not think that one 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:05.790
 battery mounted on the entry device 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.740
 level as they call it kasami with ie 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.960
 mine said the 1,200 would 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.369
 assisted in such an excellent manner 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:16.920
 such a low temperature 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:20.280
 more than a year allowed 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.140
 take more than 10 thousand photos and still not 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:27.479
 no problem no problem 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:29.640
 charging then talk of bacteria 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.290
 alternatives to the years at 14 in the 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.720
 easy question also because the 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.009
 expectations 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.979
 we say we expect to 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:40.799
 buy to buy a product on 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:44.850
 as similar as possible to the standards to which 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:46.259
 nikon has got used to it and like everyone else 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.320
 can imagine 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:51.090
 being able to find an object not of 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.490
 brand at a lower price than 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.770
 to the original which guarantees the same 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.070
 identical performance is almost a thing 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.370
 impossible 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:03.010
 however with this small battery a 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:04.930
 button a for an at 14 then small not 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:07.870
 it is true because it is exactly the same 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:11.980
 to the original nikon also in the 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:15.490
 size of course then I said with 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:17.020
 this battery i succeeded let's say 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:19.150
 only found satisfied 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:22.110
 it is the battery always at the shootings 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:25.390
 of lithium with even four times e 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:30.190
 1030 upper pins as the original of 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:33.690
 fan turns out to be a little bit more 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:38.260
 light compared to the original 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:40.420
 I don't think the price is bad 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.550
 all while lower ie I pay 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:46.300
 around 25 euros buying his 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:48.430
 amazon anyway to check too 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:52.480
 other sites the price remains fluctuating 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:55.390
 always around 25 26 euros while the 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.670
 nikon starts from 50 euros can get to 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:01.000
 60 euros if not even exceed them 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:03.220
 so still a nice saving in 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.590
 terms of performance the mistress does not know 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.630
 it must be said in the same identical 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.620
 battery life of the nikon 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.299
 nikon 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.850
 but it was to be expected anyway 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:18.820
 guarantees good work performances 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:21.930
 my tone I more or less shoot between 350 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:25.739
 and then 400 photos obviously also depends 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:28.810
 from the use of autofocus everyone knows 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:30.760
 that a machine with autofocus 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.459
 consumes much more energy than one 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.890
 machine in which auto focus on the fire 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:37.959
 manual fire you favor a 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:39.910
 just 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:43.209
 so let's say that if with the friend allo 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:45.850
 shooting around 500 photos more or less 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:49.180
 without autofocus of course with this 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:51.100
 I click a 100 150 less anyway for 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:56.030
 the price to those on offer 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:58.350
 I must say that it is excellent 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:00.840
 with this battery you will never have 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:03.000
 recognition problems from the various 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:08.520
 devices with as within it 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:10.770
 a chip designed specifically to go to 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:12.900
 turn anyway to be recognized 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:16.080
 nikon devices as a battery 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:17.820
 original may even be 

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:21.300
 used as primary battery on 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:23.010
 official battery grip with though 

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:26.160
 actually for the example for the 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:28.860
 model of 3.200 still nikon does not have 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:32.460
 no bacteria or more developed 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:36.540
 forward in the next videos so that 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:40.830
 say patona offers a product how much 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:43.500
 less good is not miraculous as it comes 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:46.830
 defined in the reviews of those who 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:48.420
 obviously sells it is rather 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:50.370
 satisfactory for the piece to which it comes 

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:50.790
 offered I don't think you can ask for 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:54.270
 better 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:56.790
 good stability good durability of the 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:58.970
 battery fully compatible with 

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:01.560
 various devices nikon devices 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:05.420
 same volt same times itself 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:08.100
 amperage system named maria f ie 

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:09.840
 as we use it 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:12.300
 we will recharge this andrea not battery 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:14.610
 they created annoying electrical memory 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:17.300
 he wouldn't know how to call her that 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:19.770
 leads to progressively exhausting the 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:22.310
 Battery pan a little thing gave us 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:22.310
 with old cell phones 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:31.080
 I would say that it's all patona for an 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:33.290
 at 14 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:36.390
 sorry for the video quality but mine 

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:37.470
 full hd digital camera that has 

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:39.840
 decided to die 

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:42.420
 so I find myself having to record how 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:43.710
 then a next webcam suck 

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:46.280
 appointment with the review of 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:48.240
