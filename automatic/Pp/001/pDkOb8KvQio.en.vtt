00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:13.769

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.870
 study because i am a people 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.980
 get contacted very important of it 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.609
 and i am also someone who has a lot 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.470
 variety you do not spend anything 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.960
 give yourself for having something 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.380
 can mean for dementia and also 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.019
 because 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.240
 anatomy and physiology human body 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.430
 just grows 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.989
 in fact i just started 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.440
 without knowing what to do with it 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.950
 was standing 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:40.739
 and almost always itunes gerarda 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.570
 a noble profession is mandatory and only if necessary 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.370
 We strive as a nurse 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.149
 that is the quality of care 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.100
 peak 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.860
 care is a part of also contemplates 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.480
 but nice management skills 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.890
 also communicative often went whole 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.469
 important when i start watching us 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.750
 training program we are one of the 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.579
 first started in 2008 to the 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.320
 generalistic training program 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.559
 that we now finally see a real pioneer 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.559
 goods 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.350
 so we are general nurse 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:12.550
 We can give you a different rights 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.690
 now two can be just as good 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:17.080
 we can become a social nurse 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.510
 you become hospital nursing 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:22.980
 always nursing because we art 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:22.980
 be trained very broadly 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.420
 paint a new internship on vacation then 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:29.310
 a perfect bond may be there 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.610
 lots of things on intensive care 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.740
 because i like beauty or all good 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.570
 theoretical base which actually now make 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.240
 quality can do a lot 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.830
 not all is new for now the knowledge 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.730
 to do with this on intensive that is 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.760
 very positive 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:45.830
 i'm someone who likes to be technical and 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:49.050
 fix the then this I can do a lot 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.760
 we can do technical things 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:54.130
 on my own 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:56.660
 day that my ambition explains you yes 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.670
 there is now an internship and IT and dialysis 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.560
 department as a very specific 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.840
 departments here become people who 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.090
 kidney problems have a realizes to 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.670
 point can go purification 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:10.940
 so that's not the case with those machines 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:14.600
 easy to set up all those machines 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:17.360
 and sign off to attract people 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.130
 pricks so it's 8 walid a big one 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.190
 responsibility 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:24.770
 bad me it is cruel technical 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:27.350

 training but practice is more than that 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.020
 also communication skills whole 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:34.970
 important in the multidisciplinary 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:37.570
 cooperate and set it up completely 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.570
 of some sort 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.620
 it is also international and why 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.910
 money the field and international week 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.950

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.050
 of our education 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:53.510
 edit more to the number of 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:55.819
 projects that actually make that 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.530
 student graduating peons tons to the 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:59.630
 coffee lift than other nurse 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.920
 and to the soldiers who do not have them 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:02.690
 call because nursing one 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.300
 bottleneck profession is we have 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:07.160
 different ages to everyone

 each other things than throne also happens 8 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.440
 times something 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:23.180
 and howest fridge really has mine 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.160
 drove a little on the horizon 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.660
 so click on it just before nursing 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.459
 also work very closely with the 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.349
 student of what do you think 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:32.660
 shortage in our training where you can find 

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:34.400
 who dares even more then for what 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:36.380
 you still uncertain and then you join that 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.720
 graduation with us that are going to look like 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:40.489
 specific service or regular service and 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.010
 the nurses who say of 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:45.260

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:48.070
 different vision on care and I think so 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.070
