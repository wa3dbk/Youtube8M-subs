00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:48.300 
it's a moment did the acting come

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.120 
it's a moment did the acting come
natural<00:01:48.660> to<00:01:48.810> you<00:01:48.900> or<00:01:48.990> was<00:01:49.470> it<00:01:49.590> challenging<00:01:49.740> at

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130

all<00:01:50.220> it<00:01:50.670> was<00:01:50.820> a<00:01:50.850> little<00:01:51.119> easier<00:01:51.420> for<00:01:51.479> me

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
all it was a little easier for me

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.150 
all it was a little easier for me
because<00:01:52.170> I've<00:01:52.350> I<00:01:54.380> know<00:01:55.380> my<00:01:55.500> angles<00:01:55.890> with<00:01:56.070> the

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:56.160 
because I've I know my angles with the

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.310 
because I've I know my angles with the
camera<00:01:56.520> that's<00:01:57.179> true<00:01:57.420> that's<00:01:57.780> part<00:01:58.140> of<00:01:58.200> it

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
camera that's true that's part of it

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.810 
camera that's true that's part of it
though<00:01:58.440> there<00:01:58.770> was<00:01:58.890> a<00:01:58.920> lot<00:01:59.009> of<00:01:59.160> challenging
