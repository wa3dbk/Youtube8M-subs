00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.730
 hello, there's another one coming 

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:11.139
 video here on the channel and I have it 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:13.059
 Carefully building a plate 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:15.550
 covers check called then it would have no 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:17.230
 the real check because it is not 

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:19.060
 established spot on deck is so it works 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.160
 today in small form but for the modern 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.170
 Format is quite cheap 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.760
 why it is so a bit of a 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:27.310
 Wilding without budget in the modern area 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.510
 So mix from the checks and have bab so 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:31.119
 I dared to dared to have one 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:33.250
 make a new list and wanted it 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:35.290
 actually on their own way 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.640
 build around the new card Beck and Co so 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:38.739
 gone is the new games of nature 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.180
 Of course they are very sensible 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:41.469
 eleventh deck therefore why 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:42.820
 eleven covers should actually build like that 

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:44.950
 to become a kind of infinity deck 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.379
 but now a bit different 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:48.820
 that elf's blanket and and Beck's head are coming 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:51.520
 then probably next Saturday 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:54.090
 and today you will see radio saw 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:57.160
 radio channel is I have all year 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.920
 Thankfully called and yes the costs are 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.600
 at about 150 euros on magic without postage 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.820
 Of course you can do it cheaper 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.199
 Without that, the money really does a lot 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.080
 worse than you can there 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:09.310
 certainly save 20 30 euros loose each 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.979
 after that maybe you have many 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.299
 cards, of course, so always 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:15.729
 a bit dependent on it like that 

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:17.470
 cards pool at home looks first yes 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:18.520
 What ever wanted to do in the deck 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.490
 yes I wanted to build discovered 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:23.770
 what plays so amusing radio in the radio 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:26.080
 is a flying legendary creature 11 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.490
 for two times and when in a train the 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.290
 fourth spell is played then 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.729
 she flies then she becomes one 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:32.890
 legendary enchantment after 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:34.869
 enchantment and that says the first 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.400
 magic in each train the one opponent 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:38.560
 plays has been known automatically 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.009
 Of course, pretty much so 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.659
 yourself 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:42.310
 It's not easy four games are 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:44.590
 to play a round but I have mine 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.170
 because of course but this is likely because 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.939
 the enchantment was not good enough for me 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.409
 I wanted to combine that and 

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:53.110
 Since then first want to know is therefore 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:54.909
 also know the name radius is and 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.759
 now also creature for two men 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:59.259
 also has 22 and every player of the 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:00.969
 Clean a non-artifact in one train 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:02.439
 has played in the train one 

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:03.100
 more non- artifact spells more 

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:05.140
 play 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.090
 yes, the core is the victory more on the 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.399
 sideboard of infinity effect 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.320
 finds the dexia are the battery and 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:12.430
 recognize it just fits in the 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:16.290
 deck and together with radio 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:18.719
 It's just a super energy because 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.980
 player does not play artifact magic 

00:02:18.719 --> 00:02:21.780
 the account has the can then anyway 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.459
 Do not play anymore it's a pretty 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.680
 more beautiful, the enemy lures nothing more 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:27.569
 can play neither stop as moodle 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.040
 on our creatures or on 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:30.959
 Of course , the whole thing has to be able to build up 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.340
 get on the board as fast as possible 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:34.530
 because if the opponent already a very 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.489
 Good board situation has brought us that 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.530
 nothing more if he does not 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:40.260
 more play if he is already miserably far 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.840
 front is yes that should only one 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.799
 bit of controller but if 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.269
 by holding it a bit 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:46.680
 slower we have at the beginning of the 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:48.480
 Missed creatures on the board and 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.090
 that's why I just got into one 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.829
 carpentry packed and just easy 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.760
 one is the complete the abo plan 

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:56.069
 actually play 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.359
 and yes, you combine that with this one 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:59.579
 very beautiful lures as I think 

00:02:57.359 --> 00:03:01.530
 how do you get over four magic in 

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:03.389
 a round course played usual 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.870
 suspicious movie ends 4 not synonymous whether 

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:08.639
 there and 14 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.629
 Of course, the two 40 men are clear 

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:12.510
 you can easily open it too 

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:12.989
 board super perfect at 14 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.720
 play 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:17.010
 the test costs only one so one 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.510
 a bit meager at all if you have the 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.859
 it's the other lying outside 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.720
 of course, already quite good of evil 

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:22.979
 to lie outside you know that 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.299
 you can also refill later 

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:26.310
 depending on to what you find 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:27.720
 Of course, playing and singing fits easily 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:29.489
 good because we have a lot 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.840
 having creatures on the board is that 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:33.569
 a nice point effect is on everyone 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.639
 case here very appropriate synergy of three 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:37.169
 I would say in order to 

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:37.949
 to be able to combine or this energy 

00:03:37.169 --> 00:03:39.690
 to start 

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:40.829
 then we have max opal and 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:41.970
 jump the tight mockshop and 

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:43.979
 Of course, one of the prize here 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.810
 extremely high are driving so are at 17 

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:47.819
 euro the piece in the moment and this 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.260
 just great awesome because for 0 painters 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:50.489
 Make painter keep on 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.599
 additional spell of me for 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:54.090
 Zero is just right 

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:56.220
 awesome spin de france not insignificant 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.750
 worse for a man can 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:59.220
 like a creature, most of the 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.169
 Use delays with us if we 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.129
 not explain it null and 

00:04:01.169 --> 00:04:04.349
 fly the screws can theirs 

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:06.299
 software again use papenmeier 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:07.680
 made ten test games so yes 

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:09.689
 then loose four space in a round 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:12.180
 His team was so easy with 

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:13.949
 the man-made artifacts and yes the problem 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:16.079
 what the thinking in the test phase 

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:17.849
 it was just you want the spreads 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:20.310
 keep on hand until mario lie down 

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:21.599
 But you also want to get spaceport 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:22.470
 to stop the opponent or already 

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:24.599
 attack 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.460
 yes I have so deal with circles 

00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:27.870
 recall is just a cool card for that 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.249
 deck you can actually play 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:31.439
 build up as you want 

00:04:29.249 --> 00:04:33.029
 if you absolutely india radio purely 

00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:34.379
 so the volts can go volt 

00:04:33.029 --> 00:04:35.759
 you play the recall on yourself 

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:36.989
 all artifacts back to the hand 

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:39.539
 take the controls you are there then 

00:04:36.989 --> 00:04:40.949
 stop if my single stuck and 

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:42.569
 now completely play again completely 

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:44.639
 and definitely a super strong one 

00:04:42.569 --> 00:04:45.059
 thing is not cool this only two times 

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:46.259
 in it 

00:04:45.059 --> 00:04:47.899
 Of course you can also use them as protection 

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:50.609
 to resent him when the enemy 

00:04:47.899 --> 00:04:52.379
 somehow somehow the board completely 

00:04:50.609 --> 00:04:54.029
 From the moment recall acknowledges everything on itself 

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:56.099
 take back to hand you take one 

00:04:54.029 --> 00:04:57.479
 also a country with once hard facts 

00:04:56.099 --> 00:04:58.649
 so that there are on hand then so 

00:04:57.479 --> 00:04:59.669
 things but it is actually general 

00:04:58.649 --> 00:05:01.559
 Better to take this with you 

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:03.539
 instead of losing the whole board though 

00:05:01.559 --> 00:05:04.799
 you lose 34 creatures then 

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:06.149
 recall on the spot in any case one 

00:05:04.799 --> 00:05:07.819
 very nice card fits in any case 

00:05:06.149 --> 00:05:09.689
 Great in my opinion 

00:05:07.819 --> 00:05:11.459
 which tours I was not yet 

00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:12.899
 finished has two wolz gerd strehle 

00:05:11.459 --> 00:05:14.639
 This one also has great players for two 

00:05:12.899 --> 00:05:16.619
 live and a colorless mana 11 fly 

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:18.119
 livelink that definitely top and 

00:05:16.619 --> 00:05:20.429
 style overzier and our creature still 

00:05:18.119 --> 00:05:22.289
 to give a bit of booms for 211 100 

00:05:20.429 --> 00:05:24.899
 abkriegt every facto had demonstrated 

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:26.459
 with +11 mark if we activated in two 

00:05:24.899 --> 00:05:27.989
 you can be pretty good on it 

00:05:26.459 --> 00:05:30.269
 a nice card you can get here on everyone 

00:05:27.989 --> 00:05:32.789
 So play should be a bit 

00:05:30.269 --> 00:05:34.379
 accessories here yes in every finity or 

00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:36.509
 artifacts here is little you will find 

00:05:34.379 --> 00:05:38.099
 no in this artifact now 

00:05:36.509 --> 00:05:40.019
 plating is easy must trigger 

00:05:38.099 --> 00:05:41.489
 creature plus 10 for each car fakt what 

00:05:40.019 --> 00:05:43.139
 we can control there as well 

00:05:41.489 --> 00:05:44.879
 Neat whether that is his ability to fly 

00:05:43.139 --> 00:05:47.759
 with which properly for 67 

00:05:44.879 --> 00:05:49.229
 on top of it sharp card must be three 

00:05:47.759 --> 00:05:50.819
 dispatch even if we ourselves very much 

00:05:49.229 --> 00:05:51.989
 creatures let yourself be you want 

00:05:50.819 --> 00:05:53.879
 certain creatures in the opponent not 

00:05:51.989 --> 00:05:54.809
 love lying have timo wolf or sofa 

00:05:53.879 --> 00:05:56.639
 if you do not necessarily take it 

00:05:54.809 --> 00:05:58.349
 be hewn display of the super it for 

00:05:56.639 --> 00:05:59.729
 once the tour is in exile 

00:05:58.349 --> 00:06:02.849
 you always have metalcraft 

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:04.139
 spiked map in the resort because we 

00:06:02.849 --> 00:06:06.360
 but we are also quite fast 

00:06:04.139 --> 00:06:07.979
 on the cards from what a mahner with 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:10.019
 definitely from mine you pull two 

00:06:07.979 --> 00:06:11.339
 cards after tips card super too 

00:06:10.019 --> 00:06:13.469
 if you 're fooling around in Rio welcome the 

00:06:11.339 --> 00:06:15.299
 Club play may end up ending 

00:06:13.469 --> 00:06:18.749
 go on and on in any case 

00:06:15.299 --> 00:06:21.149
 great cards to the countries 16 pieces only 

00:06:18.749 --> 00:06:22.799
 the monaco to infinity low and 

00:06:21.149 --> 00:06:24.659
 wehrmann artifacts 16 countries right 

00:06:22.799 --> 00:06:25.949
 only two of us really loose in construction 

00:06:24.659 --> 00:06:27.179
 of course, you might know 

00:06:25.949 --> 00:06:29.429
 and blue to produce the 

00:06:27.179 --> 00:06:31.979
 know it and he can play radio or 

00:06:29.429 --> 00:06:34.169
 podcast recall so the colored space 

00:06:31.979 --> 00:06:35.759
 bbc.com costly times done four pure 

00:06:34.169 --> 00:06:37.409
 not expensive from the money and comes in 

00:06:35.759 --> 00:06:39.360
 makes the first round getting tapped 

00:06:37.409 --> 00:06:42.389
 Both times both times what we need 

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:42.810
 Great that this model has four pieces of it 

00:06:42.389 --> 00:06:44.520
 still hold 

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:47.400
 artifact land in addition, which also stops 

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:49.050
 you do not have to play well 

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:51.180
 I think our play is good , our striker 

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:53.130
 In any case ne ne card 2 ct often 

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:55.500
 does not need to be bad 

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:56.700
 exactly what we always need makes 

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:58.110
 even if only a black banner 

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:59.370
 for wolfsburg you can get it 

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:02.910
 but it does not have to be two 

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:04.530
 Pay for sex if you stop that 

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:06.480
 just being open it's okay that too 

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:08.910
 use and a lot of glamor boy though that 

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:10.680
 best land for artifacts makes easy 

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:11.550
 every time you need it when you're on 

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:13.860
 too big no artifacts 

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:15.300
 you have to control the victims yes okay 

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:16.770
 is actually a bad effect 

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:18.389
 but if you want right now 

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:20.850
 You have to play the gema victim 

00:07:18.389 --> 00:07:22.800
 Anyway, he does not care anyway 

00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:25.169
 Two more in the nexus completes 

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:27.270
 cool creature alternative wins plan 

00:07:25.169 --> 00:07:28.950
 of course we can do an 11th for once 

00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:30.540
 transform flying infect creature 

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:32.190
 together with the trailer plating skin 

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:34.200
 the the opponents quiet times two trains of death 

00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:35.400
 salt is great even if someone can live 

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:37.500
 or something has it in any case one 

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:39.300
 really nice card and yes I think 

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:41.490
 the round in any case the whole 

00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:42.389
 nice, yes, that was it again 

00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:43.770
 for this video 

00:07:42.389 --> 00:07:44.790
 I hope you like the deck 

00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:46.800
 maybe he also wanted her online 

00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:49.680
 Antesten still has suggestions for that 

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:53.030

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:53.030
