00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:06.290
 when we have children under our care 

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:08.630
 Sometimes we do not know what to do to 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:10.579
 entertain them most of the time 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:12.980
 they may entertain themselves 

00:00:10.579 --> 00:00:15.559
 but for those moments when 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:18.230
 No toy calms them where they 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:21.530
 they say I get bored a thousand times 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:23.180
 minute in definite in the moments in 

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:25.790
 what the children what really 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.740
 they want is to share time with us 

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:30.560
 I leave this video with some singles 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:33.020
 tricks four ways to make puppets 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.699
 instantly with materials that sure 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.149
 you'll have on hand in almost any 

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:37.149
 situation 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.859
 first 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.769
 you're going to need a pair of gloves that 

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:51.179
 estiren you're going to wear one 

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:54.839
 want with the one you like most 

00:00:51.179 --> 00:00:57.030
 feel the finger heart bad the other 

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:59.269
 glove you are going to introduce as well as you 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.269
 I am saying 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:08.000
 between the middle finger and the rest of 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.010
 the fingers are going to put the glove leaving 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.960
 on one side the glove and the other the rest 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:15.049
 of the little fingers 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:19.100
 and then you have to put all the 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:22.729
 fingers of that glove inside what 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:27.110
 spare on the other side and thus make a 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:31.310
 kind of hat leaving out the 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:35.440
 tip of the finger as if it were a small 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.440
 nose you see cheesman monkey 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:43.250
 the little finger and the big toe you're going 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:46.900
 to put together and cover 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.900
 the other part of the glove 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:56.560
 and then we have a little body 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:59.350
 a head and little arms children 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.810
 will entertain a lot with this seems 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.729
 silly but they love to start 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.190
 that they see that he has a little head 

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:08.490
 begins to blow your imagination and you're 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:08.490
 all done 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:14.120
 number 2 for this you need a sock 

00:02:11.689 --> 00:02:16.519
 it does not matter what it is but it is a little 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.890
 long a cardboard or a cardboard 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:21.079
 scissors and glue stick and a 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:24.290
 pen or a pen something for 

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:27.859
 paint on the cardboard draw as a couple 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:32.420
 of eyes I'm going to do some in plan 

00:02:27.859 --> 00:02:35.359
 reptile or good cat well with the pupil 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.859
 very narrow and long but if you want 

00:02:35.359 --> 00:02:38.930
 you can also try to draw 

00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:42.349
 any eye style if you fancy 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:44.000
 with little more feminine lashes with the 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:47.629
 round pupil so that it is not so 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.689
 threatening then also that circle 

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:52.430
 it went wrong and those lashes are even worse 

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:54.379
 look let it let it cross it out 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.230
 try but because we stay with 

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:58.569
 we 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:01.569
 then you have to cut us out and then 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:03.549
 you put a drop of glue on them like 

00:03:01.569 --> 00:03:06.310
 It's glue stick with a droplet you 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:08.739
 will serve to just stick in the 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.480
 sock to play but not so that 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:12.670
 spoil is the sock then you can 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.860
 take off the wash them and you will continue 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:16.390
 having the sock as always with 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:19.750
 the two eyes eyes glued on the 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:21.879
 sock you put your hand and the typical 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:24.970
 you have a puppet has been a 

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:27.250
 kidding but the kids love it 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:29.829
 at the moment the sock has 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:32.170
 eyes and move your mouth even if it's a 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:35.140
 sock you talk next to him and the 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:39.569
 children talk to the sock no longer you 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:39.569
 they look at the mouth is magic 

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:43.830
 and please, how much love 

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:52.630
 ready we are going for the third thanks 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:55.690
 number 3 marker and paint the 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:58.480
 little fingers yes it's super basic but 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:00.970
 Sometimes with stress we do not remember 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:03.310
 what simple things like these for 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:05.560
 entertain the little ones the 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:07.980
 different faces one sad one happy 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:11.890
 another asleep 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:13.830
 whatever and a drink 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:15.720
 and with that 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:17.370
 very simple 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.110
 Be careful after you do not touch yourself 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:23.280
 much the face because it will be transferred to you 

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:25.120
 in the painting you have to see what a disaster 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:29.790
 of woman 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.790
 let's pass the next number 4 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:34.290
 again with the gloves in this case 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:38.409
 well you can use one you can use two 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:42.300
 index finger 

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:46.809
 and heart we put the rest of the fingers 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:49.779
 inside the rest of the glove and that's it 

00:04:46.809 --> 00:04:53.610
 we have a couple of successful feet that come out 

00:04:49.779 --> 00:04:56.860
 for a dress for a kit with you want 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:59.229
 another thing that is super simple but that 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:00.789
 helps to develop the imagination not 

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:03.580
 we need a toy we do not need 

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:06.580
 spend money simply with that look 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:09.519
 socially well what happens is is already 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:10.899
 with this you have a lot of things to 

00:05:09.519 --> 00:05:13.659
 develop the imagination of children 

00:05:10.899 --> 00:05:17.639
 develop yours enjoy all 

00:05:13.659 --> 00:05:17.639
