 here is no new title but 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.560
 it's more like a bond or a package of 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.529
 previous games as you see here is 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.210
 hello origins kindness is this 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.180
 well this was taken out by the gamestop page 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.279
 in the USA a couple of days ago and well what 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.470
 what is it is basically that they are going to 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.470
 include hello combative universal and the 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.780
 remake of halo combat and bold and halo 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.370
 reach the two games completely 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.050
 complete very well as you see here the 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.920
 price that they are putting us is 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:43.559
 29 dollars with 99 cents now we are going to 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:48.300
 see how much that is in Mexican pesos very 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:50.820
 ok 29.99 where it's typical not what you want 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.930
 be a very sharp conversion and range very 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:57.449
 well as you see here in pesos are 390 and 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:59.129
 2.15 Mexican pesos although I tell them 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.590
 the truth that I say that this one is going to 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.170
 cost 600 pesos if they bring it here to 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.269
 mexico I assure you totally that goes 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.670
 to cost that 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:10.759
 well then basically what is 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.229
 this is two games halo reach and halo 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:14.479
 combat and volve anniversary that the truth 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:16.429
 It is a very good promotion for all 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:19.250
 those who do not have these titles the 

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:20.899
 true if you already have them do not buy it 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.539
 they were nothing else you're going to spend money on 

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:26.119

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.849
