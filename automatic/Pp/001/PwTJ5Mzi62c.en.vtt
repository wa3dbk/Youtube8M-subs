00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:13.030
 very good sign if what the team 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.920
 is doing a lot of goals what 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:16.449
 it's good that many players have 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.300
 marked 

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:22.330
 we are front midfielders or 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:24.820
 defenses that everyone contributes in in 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:28.029
 that facet I think that speaks very well of 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:30.520
 team and it makes us so high up that 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:32.230
 it's man is not usual that 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:34.329
 how like this season because 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:36.579
 our defenses are being made 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:39.219
 so many goals but obviously that is 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:43.890
 it is very important that they also join 

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:43.890
 to attack are played with set pieces 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:51.250
 at stake in active and good that makes 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:54.130
 the team then thank you and you 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:57.010
 note not the first very good data for the 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:01:00.260
 team you can see that we are working 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:02.239
 well that we all carry in the 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.620
 same address we want the same and 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:06.150
 It is always important that 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:09.150
 that those who are not forwards also 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:12.000
 support because they take by surprise the 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.770
 rival defenses and that facilitates the 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.440
 work of them and also to us 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.200
 that people are already worried about 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:21.780
 all players and not just for one or 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.710
 two yes I think 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:28.049
 we have shown that we have a 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:30.299
 very good offensive potential and that 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:33.090
 our style of football is playing the 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.500
 ball wants to always win is giving 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.780
 its fruits and I think that 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.340
 it's good for the players for the 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.590
 trust and also for the people because 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:44.710
 we make a little more entertaining the 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:47.890
 party and people have fun watching 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:50.080
 the network without a doubt that is a fact to have 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.750
 certainly aware that one speaks 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:55.240
 good offensive ability and 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.800
 scout of this team and is what not 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.780
 is taking a little bit then pull to 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.479
 up and be in those positions above 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:04.510
 not for the fact that it is very 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:06.369
 distributed then one at the end that a lot 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:08.770
 people are making me critical too 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:11.560
 that we have put many and that one that 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:14.230
 they are all contributing offensively and it is 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.780
 one of the keys of this team 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:20.799
 the truth that very proud that everything 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:23.260
 the team is part of this great facet 

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:27.340
 scout of the team that we can all 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:30.310
 contribute with a goal with two or more and 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.890
 that talks about how good it is 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.989
 working at an offensive level and that 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.090
 they are always coming continuously not 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:39.280
 only to front but also in 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.680
 midfield and in still balls do 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:45.400
 see them the defense at the time of marking 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:48.420
 goals I think it makes difficult the 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:51.489
 rival the defensive approach 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:54.220
 knowing that any player is 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:56.349
 trained to mark and what 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.060
 important is the matches are won with 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:03:00.370
 goals and we are having it and we are 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.079
 getting and we are creating many 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:05.160
 goal chances that is also is 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:07.420
 be important to achieve is 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.310
 in front of the goal have the 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.019
 opportunity and we are also 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.810
 turning that is that the important thing of 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:14.650
 this in the team that they were more 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.270
 when we see our players 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.940
 different 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:21.520
 we miss some not yet but but 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.590
 good after all the goal is 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:26.950
 I do not care if the goal is not 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:29.830
 but hey if the three points because it 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:33.000
 I think we got it 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:36.730
 the goal is that if it's better at the end 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.610
 in case it lies only 1 goals then if it 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:43.240
 he has a madrid because we return our 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:49.360
 team gets as many also dabble 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:51.570
 not only 134 some even 67 and that's 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.570
 good
