00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
psychological to me I couldn't take it

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.770 
psychological to me I couldn't take it
anymore<00:02:10.920> two<00:02:11.250> months<00:02:11.580> was<00:02:11.730> more<00:02:12.000> than<00:02:12.150> was

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
anymore two months was more than was

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.210 
anymore two months was more than was
longer<00:02:13.049> than<00:02:13.230> I<00:02:13.319> really<00:02:13.560> needed<00:02:13.739> to<00:02:13.890> be<00:02:14.010> there

but<00:02:14.400> I<00:02:14.459> kept<00:02:14.760> hoping<00:02:14.970> that<00:02:15.480> maybe<00:02:15.660> this<00:02:16.080> was

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
but I kept hoping that maybe this was

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.920 
but I kept hoping that maybe this was
just<00:02:16.519> something<00:02:17.519> that<00:02:17.730> I'm<00:02:17.910> experiencing<00:02:18.720> for

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
just something that I'm experiencing for

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.210

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:31.339 
what's going on it's just nothing but
chaos<00:02:22.709> and<00:02:29.420> it's<00:02:30.420> psychologically<00:02:31.140> stressful

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:31.349

of the distance the key to this whole

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:09.370 
of the distance the key to this whole
thing<00:06:07.160> is<00:06:07.340> a<00:06:07.370> facility<00:06:08.090> where<00:06:08.750> these<00:06:08.930> animals
