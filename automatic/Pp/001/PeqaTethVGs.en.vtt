hill<00:00:55.879> you<00:00:56.879> can<00:00:57.090> actually<00:00:57.480> park<00:00:57.719> the

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
hill you can actually park the

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.450 
hill you can actually park the
helicopters<00:00:58.410> up<00:00:58.559> on<00:00:58.680> those<00:00:58.800> cranes<00:00:59.129> back

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
there but it kind of slides off

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.700 
there but it kind of slides off
eventually<00:01:02.370> so<00:01:02.820> it's<00:01:03.000> not<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.239> best<00:01:03.420> place

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710
