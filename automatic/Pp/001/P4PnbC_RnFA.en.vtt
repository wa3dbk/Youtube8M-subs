specifically some of the things that

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.060 
specifically some of the things that
that<00:00:21.150> we<00:00:21.539> should<00:00:21.750> keep<00:00:21.930> in<00:00:22.109> mind<00:00:22.170> as<00:00:22.650> we're

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
that we should keep in mind as we're

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.150

talking about quality scores or or

talking about quality scores or or
basically<00:00:26.730> how<00:00:27.000> they<00:00:27.210> influence<00:00:28.050> our

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:28.550 
basically how they influence our

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.970 
basically how they influence our
advertising<00:00:30.050> the<00:00:31.050> first<00:00:31.320> thing<00:00:31.500> to<00:00:31.619> keep<00:00:31.830> in

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
advertising the first thing to keep in

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.639 
advertising the first thing to keep in
mind<00:00:32.219> here<00:00:32.460> is<00:00:32.489> that<00:00:32.610> quality<00:00:32.969> scores<00:00:33.510> are<00:00:33.809> ad

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
mind here is that quality scores are ad

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.270 
mind here is that quality scores are ad
rank<00:00:34.980> multipliers<00:00:35.550> they<00:00:36.149> they<00:00:36.690> basically

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:37.280 
rank multipliers they they basically

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.490 
rank multipliers they they basically
they<00:00:38.280> act<00:00:38.520> as<00:00:38.790> a<00:00:38.820> multiplier<00:00:39.480> that<00:00:40.050> helps

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
they act as a multiplier that helps

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.490 
they act as a multiplier that helps
improve<00:00:41.280> either<00:00:41.489> your<00:00:41.700> position<00:00:42.149> or<00:00:42.390> or<00:00:42.899> what

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
improve either your position or or what

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.799 
improve either your position or or what
not<00:00:43.649> here's<00:00:43.980> an<00:00:44.070> example<00:00:44.309> of<00:00:44.520> this<00:00:44.809> advertiser

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
not here's an example of this advertiser

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.130 
not here's an example of this advertiser
one<00:00:46.170> has<00:00:46.530> a<00:00:46.559> maximum<00:00:47.340> bid<00:00:47.579> of<00:00:47.760> five<00:00:47.969> dollars<00:00:48.239> if

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
one has a maximum bid of five dollars if

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.139 
one has a maximum bid of five dollars if
you<00:00:49.500> multiply<00:00:50.010> that<00:00:50.160> maximum<00:00:50.610> bid<00:00:50.820> by<00:00:51.000> their

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
you multiply that maximum bid by their

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:52.970 
you multiply that maximum bid by their
quality<00:00:51.539> score<00:00:51.809> three<00:00:52.170> then<00:00:52.530> you<00:00:52.620> get<00:00:52.770> an<00:00:52.829> ad

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
quality score three then you get an ad

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.600 
quality score three then you get an ad
rank<00:00:53.219> of<00:00:53.370> 15<00:00:54.260> while<00:00:55.260> advertiser<00:00:55.800> two<00:00:56.129> maybe

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
rank of 15 while advertiser two maybe

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.119 
rank of 15 while advertiser two maybe
they<00:00:56.760> have<00:00:56.910> a<00:00:56.940> max<00:00:57.210> bid<00:00:57.420> of<00:00:57.600> 300<00:00:58.199> one<00:00:58.649> three

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
they have a max bid of 300 one three

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.500 
they have a max bid of 300 one three
dollars<00:00:59.399> one<00:00:59.640> cent

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
dollars one cent

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.660 
dollars one cent
and<00:01:00.719> their<00:01:01.379> quality<00:01:01.680> score<00:01:01.920> is<00:01:01.949> five<00:01:02.280> and<00:01:02.579> you

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
and their quality score is five and you

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.179 
and their quality score is five and you
notice<00:01:03.030> that<00:01:03.210> they<00:01:03.449> have<00:01:03.660> a<00:01:04.080> better<00:01:04.439> ad<00:01:04.739> rank

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
notice that they have a better ad rank

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.760 
notice that they have a better ad rank
even<00:01:05.700> though<00:01:06.090> they<00:01:06.510> they<00:01:07.170> are<00:01:07.350> definitely

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
even though they they are definitely

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.359 
even though they they are definitely
bidding<00:01:08.100> a<00:01:08.400> lot<00:01:08.670> less<00:01:09.119> an<00:01:09.630> advertiser<00:01:10.470> 3<00:01:10.860> is<00:01:11.040> in

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
bidding a lot less an advertiser 3 is in

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:12.740 
bidding a lot less an advertiser 3 is in
an<00:01:11.490> even<00:01:11.700> better<00:01:11.820> position<00:01:12.090> with<00:01:12.450> a<00:01:12.479> quality

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
an even better position with a quality

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:13.820 
an even better position with a quality
score<00:01:13.049> of<00:01:13.260> 8

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
score of 8

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.630 
score of 8
a<00:01:13.860> bid<00:01:14.400> of<00:01:14.430> two<00:01:14.880> beats<00:01:15.600> out<00:01:15.840> both<00:01:16.200> of<00:01:16.229> them<00:01:16.640> with

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
a bid of two beats out both of them with

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.330 
a bid of two beats out both of them with
an<00:01:17.790> ad<00:01:17.939> rank<00:01:18.210> of<00:01:18.390> 16<00:01:18.930> and<00:01:19.170> so<00:01:19.590> you<00:01:20.070> see<00:01:20.310> that

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
an ad rank of 16 and so you see that

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.399 
an ad rank of 16 and so you see that
this<00:01:20.640> multiplier<00:01:21.210> is<00:01:21.390> extremely<00:01:22.200> powerful

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
this multiplier is extremely powerful

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.640 
this multiplier is extremely powerful
you<00:01:23.189> can<00:01:23.369> spend<00:01:23.729> a<00:01:23.909> lot<00:01:23.939> less<00:01:24.240> advertiser<00:01:25.140> 3<00:01:25.530> is

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
you can spend a lot less advertiser 3 is

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.440 
you can spend a lot less advertiser 3 is
spending<00:01:26.130> less<00:01:26.310> than<00:01:26.640> half<00:01:27.090> of<00:01:27.270> what

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
spending less than half of what

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.450 
spending less than half of what
advertiser<00:01:27.869> 1<00:01:28.170> is<00:01:28.320> spending<00:01:28.770> and<00:01:28.979> is<00:01:29.280> in<00:01:29.400> a

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
advertiser 1 is spending and is in a

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.490 
advertiser 1 is spending and is in a
better<00:01:29.670> position<00:01:29.970> because<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:31.079> Quality

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
better position because the Quality

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.469 
better position because the Quality
Score<00:01:31.530> is<00:01:31.950> so<00:01:32.400> much<00:01:32.579> better<00:01:32.729> so<00:01:33.000> what<00:01:33.180> is<00:01:33.329> it

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
Score is so much better so what is it

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.560 
Score is so much better so what is it
the<00:01:33.570> makes<00:01:33.810> quality<00:01:34.200> score<00:01:34.530> actually<00:01:35.400> or<00:01:36.390> what

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
the makes quality score actually or what

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.690 
the makes quality score actually or what
is<00:01:36.689> it<00:01:36.810> that<00:01:36.840> composes<00:01:37.500> what<00:01:37.950> what<00:01:38.610> the

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
is it that composes what what the

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.649 
is it that composes what what the
quality<00:01:39.030> score<00:01:39.299> is<00:01:39.799> that<00:01:41.030> that's<00:01:42.030> basically

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
quality score is that that's basically

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.389 
quality score is that that's basically
this<00:01:42.869> third<00:01:43.110> point<00:01:43.380> here<00:01:43.560> and<00:01:43.710> that<00:01:43.770> is

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
this third point here and that is

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.300 
this third point here and that is
relevance<00:01:45.270> and<00:01:45.479> an<00:01:46.170> click-through<00:01:46.680> rate<00:01:46.860> at

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
relevance and an click-through rate at

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.069 
relevance and an click-through rate at
least<00:01:47.340> click-through<00:01:47.970> rate<00:01:48.090> as<00:01:48.240> a<00:01:48.270> measure<00:01:48.780> of

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
least click-through rate as a measure of

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.319 
least click-through rate as a measure of
relevance<00:01:49.829> okay

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
relevance okay

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.740 
relevance okay
the<00:01:52.100> the<00:01:53.100> relevance<00:01:53.610> actually<00:01:54.360> has<00:01:54.479> to<00:01:54.600> do

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
the the relevance actually has to do

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.350 
the the relevance actually has to do
with<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.799> I<00:01:56.130> guess<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:56.759> cohesiveness

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
with the the I guess the cohesiveness

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.010 
with the the I guess the cohesiveness

score<00:02:29.980> hey<00:02:30.980> the<00:02:31.130> other<00:02:31.220> thing<00:02:31.459> to<00:02:31.550> keep<00:02:31.670> in

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
score hey the other thing to keep in

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.030 
score hey the other thing to keep in
mind<00:02:31.850> is<00:02:32.120> the<00:02:32.240> quality<00:02:32.600> score<00:02:32.900> the<00:02:33.260> algorithm

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
mind is the quality score the algorithm

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:39.280 
mind is the quality score the algorithm
seems<00:02:34.400> linear<00:02:34.820> and<00:02:35.750> and<00:02:37.090> we<00:02:38.090> at<00:02:38.750> the<00:02:38.780> beginning

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
seems linear and and we at the beginning

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.620 
seems linear and and we at the beginning
we<00:02:39.470> were<00:02:39.680> we<00:02:40.310> were<00:02:40.400> fairly<00:02:40.820> certain<00:02:41.209> that<00:02:41.330> the

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
we were we were fairly certain that the

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.350 
we were we were fairly certain that the
the<00:02:42.170> algorithm<00:02:42.770> was<00:02:43.130> logarithmic<00:02:43.910> which

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
the algorithm was logarithmic which

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.170 
the algorithm was logarithmic which
means<00:02:44.709> if<00:02:45.709> it's<00:02:46.130> a<00:02:46.220> logarithmic<00:02:46.430> algorithm

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
means if it's a logarithmic algorithm

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.410 
means if it's a logarithmic algorithm
that<00:02:47.810> that<00:02:48.410> it's<00:02:48.530> harder<00:02:48.950> to<00:02:49.190> have<00:02:50.000> a<00:02:50.030> higher

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
that that it's harder to have a higher

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.090 
that that it's harder to have a higher
quality<00:02:50.450> score<00:02:50.989> or<00:02:51.290> there's<00:02:51.440> more<00:02:51.500> effort

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:52.100 
quality score or there's more effort

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.160 
quality score or there's more effort
that<00:02:52.250> you've<00:02:52.340> got<00:02:52.520> to<00:02:52.610> put<00:02:52.820> in<00:02:53.030> in<00:02:53.300> order<00:02:53.840> to

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
that you've got to put in in order to

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.140 
that you've got to put in in order to
increase<00:02:54.620> the<00:02:54.920> quality<00:02:55.130> score<00:02:55.610> and<00:02:55.730> so<00:02:56.120> a

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
increase the quality score and so a

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.420 
increase the quality score and so a
logarithmic<00:02:57.080> graph<00:02:57.680> would<00:02:58.160> have<00:02:58.280> looked

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
logarithmic graph would have looked

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:05.140 
logarithmic graph would have looked
something<00:02:58.610> like<00:02:58.940> this<00:03:01.120> at<00:03:02.120> the<00:03:02.270> onset<00:03:02.980> we<00:03:04.150> we

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
something like this at the onset we we

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:06.850 
something like this at the onset we we
ran<00:03:05.330> some<00:03:05.570> tests<00:03:06.020> here<00:03:06.200> recently<00:03:06.680> to

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
ran some tests here recently to

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.979 
ran some tests here recently to
determine<00:03:07.400> whether<00:03:07.910> whether<00:03:08.390> it<00:03:08.600> was<00:03:08.780> one

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
determine whether whether it was one

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:10.630 
determine whether whether it was one
where<00:03:09.140> the<00:03:09.260> other<00:03:09.410> end<00:03:09.470> it<00:03:09.769> appears<00:03:09.860> right<00:03:10.310> now

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
where the other end it appears right now

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.729 
where the other end it appears right now
to<00:03:10.700> be<00:03:10.880> linear<00:03:11.239> which<00:03:11.480> means<00:03:11.900> that<00:03:12.380> the<00:03:12.560> same

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:12.739 
to be linear which means that the same

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:14.800 
to be linear which means that the same
amount<00:03:12.890> of<00:03:13.130> effort<00:03:13.549> that<00:03:14.030> will<00:03:14.209> take<00:03:14.450> you<00:03:14.630> from

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
amount of effort that will take you from

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.800 
amount of effort that will take you from
a<00:03:14.959> 3<00:03:15.200> to<00:03:15.320> a<00:03:15.350> 5<00:03:15.650> will<00:03:15.890> take<00:03:16.070> you<00:03:16.190> from<00:03:16.310> a<00:03:16.459> 5<00:03:16.700> to<00:03:16.970> you

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
a 3 to a 5 will take you from a 5 to you

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:22.270 
a 3 to a 5 will take you from a 5 to you
know<00:03:17.930> to<00:03:17.989> an<00:03:18.290> 8<00:03:18.470> and<00:03:19.370> so<00:03:19.760> anyway<00:03:20.830> or<00:03:21.830> I<00:03:21.860> guess<00:03:22.010> 5

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
know to an 8 and so anyway or I guess 5

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.150 
know to an 8 and so anyway or I guess 5
to<00:03:22.459> a<00:03:22.489> 7<00:03:22.820> sorry<00:03:23.030> my<00:03:23.150> math<00:03:23.330> is<00:03:23.510> bad<00:03:23.720> here<00:03:23.930> today

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
to a 7 sorry my math is bad here today

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.220 
to a 7 sorry my math is bad here today
but<00:03:25.160> but<00:03:26.000> that's<00:03:26.390> the<00:03:26.540> same<00:03:26.750> amount<00:03:27.019> of<00:03:27.080> effort

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
but but that's the same amount of effort

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.410 
but but that's the same amount of effort
and<00:03:27.590> so<00:03:28.010> that's<00:03:28.700> that's<00:03:28.970> definitely

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:29.420 
and so that's that's definitely

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:30.640 
and so that's that's definitely
something<00:03:29.570> to<00:03:29.690> keep<00:03:29.870> in<00:03:30.049> mind<00:03:30.200> Wednesday

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
something to keep in mind Wednesday

something to keep in mind Wednesday
we'll<00:03:30.799> dive<00:03:30.950> into<00:03:30.980> quality<00:03:31.430> score<00:03:31.820> a<00:03:31.850> little

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 
we'll dive into quality score a little

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.300 
we'll dive into quality score a little
bit<00:03:32.180> more<00:03:32.420> in<00:03:32.540> detail<00:03:32.690> and<00:03:33.140> talk<00:03:33.769> about<00:03:34.070> how

bit more in detail and talk about how

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:36.460 
bit more in detail and talk about how

talk a little bit about how to influence

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.949 
talk a little bit about how to influence

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980 
things to keep in mind about quality

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:47.890 
things to keep in mind about quality
score<00:03:46.250> is<00:03:46.280> that<00:03:46.760> your<00:03:47.030> account<00:03:47.390> has<00:03:47.600> a<00:03:47.630> quality

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
score is that your account has a quality

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:49.960 
score is that your account has a quality
score<00:03:48.260> your<00:03:48.500> campaigns<00:03:49.040> have<00:03:49.280> quality<00:03:49.670> scores

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
score your campaigns have quality scores

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:52.270
