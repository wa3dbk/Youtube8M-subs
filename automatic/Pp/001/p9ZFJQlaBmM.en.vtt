00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.370 
I am absolutely horrible at cod um I

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:21.319 
I am absolutely horrible at cod um I
definitely<00:04:20.370> need<00:04:20.579> to<00:04:20.669> practice<00:04:21.000> more<00:04:21.180> I<00:04:21.239> think

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:21.329 
definitely need to practice more I think

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:23.240 
definitely need to practice more I think
that's<00:04:21.570> what<00:04:21.719> it<00:04:21.810> is<00:04:21.840> it's<00:04:22.229> a<00:04:22.320> matter<00:04:22.440> of

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
that's what it is it's a matter of

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.130 
that's what it is it's a matter of
you<00:04:23.940> die<00:04:24.120> a<00:04:24.150> lot<00:04:24.390> faster<00:04:24.630> than<00:04:24.870> this<00:04:24.960> one<00:04:25.110> and

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:25.140 
you die a lot faster than this one and

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:26.930 
you die a lot faster than this one and
it's<00:04:25.350> harder<00:04:25.590> to<00:04:25.620> rank<00:04:25.890> up<00:04:26.010> or<00:04:26.280> not<00:04:26.490> harder<00:04:26.850> it

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
it's harder to rank up or not harder it

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.120 
it's harder to rank up or not harder it
takes<00:04:27.090> longer<00:04:27.420> to<00:04:27.510> rank<00:04:27.690> up<00:04:27.840> so<00:04:28.170> it's<00:04:28.860> I<00:04:29.070> think

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.130 
takes longer to rank up so it's I think

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:31.070 
takes longer to rank up so it's I think
it's<00:04:29.280> a<00:04:29.400> matter<00:04:29.520> of<00:04:29.700> just<00:04:30.060> playing<00:04:30.900> the<00:04:30.990> game

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 
it's a matter of just playing the game

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.160 
it's a matter of just playing the game
long<00:04:31.860> enough<00:04:31.890> whereas<00:04:32.670> before<00:04:32.880> like<00:04:33.360> usually

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:34.170

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
I'd be able to jump into a cod game and

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.190 
I'd be able to jump into a cod game and
