00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
characters could be changed because we

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:55.939 
characters could be changed because we
had<00:00:54.750> these<00:00:54.870> characters<00:00:55.289> that<00:00:55.320> keep<00:00:55.620> popping

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949

had these characters that keep popping
up<00:00:56.010> over<00:00:56.190> and<00:00:56.460> over<00:00:56.550> again<00:00:56.760> with<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:56.969> same

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
up over and over again with the same

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.299 
up over and over again with the same
basic<00:00:57.750> template<00:00:58.140> if<00:00:58.440> things<00:00:58.739> changing<00:00:59.190> that

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
basic template if things changing that

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.979 
basic template if things changing that
could<00:00:59.670> lead<00:00:59.879> to<00:00:59.910> some<00:01:00.090> interesting<00:01:00.270> gameplay

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
could lead to some interesting gameplay

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.599 
could lead to some interesting gameplay
so<00:01:01.320> it<00:01:01.440> sounds<00:01:01.680> like<00:01:01.800> he<00:01:01.920> wants<00:01:02.010> to<00:01:02.160> mess<00:01:02.399> with

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
whole connection thing between Majora's

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.130 
whole connection thing between Majora's
Mask<00:01:12.000> and<00:01:12.210> a<00:01:12.330> link<00:01:12.510> between<00:01:12.630> worlds<00:01:14.990> so<00:01:15.990> it

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
Mask and a link between worlds so it

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.570 
Mask and a link between worlds so it
sounds<00:01:16.380> like<00:01:16.500> my<00:01:16.619> drawers<00:01:16.920> mass<00:01:17.100> is<00:01:17.280> gonna<00:01:17.520> be

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
sounds like my drawers mass is gonna be

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.130 
sounds like my drawers mass is gonna be
upfront<00:01:17.759> and<00:01:18.030> having<00:01:18.270> a<00:01:18.330> huge<00:01:18.509> integral<00:01:18.840> part

upfront and having a huge integral part

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.330 
upfront and having a huge integral part
in<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.350> story<00:01:19.530> like<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.830> link<00:01:19.979> happened<00:01:20.280> you

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
in the story like the link happened you

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.130 
in the story like the link happened you
use<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.729> mask<00:01:20.909> or<00:01:21.090> something<00:01:21.390> like<00:01:21.509> that<00:01:21.720> but

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140

these days it's gonna be something that

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.590 
these days it's gonna be something that
you<00:01:23.340> aren't<00:01:23.610> going<00:01:23.759> to<00:01:23.850> be<00:01:23.970> noticing<00:01:24.360> right

want but he went an elaborate further on
this<00:01:32.369> whole<00:01:32.640> thing<00:01:32.970> because<00:01:33.180> he<00:01:33.270> doesn't<00:01:33.420> want

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
this whole thing because he doesn't want

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:34.280 
this whole thing because he doesn't want
to<00:01:33.689> ruin<00:01:33.990> it

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290

and he wouldn't mention whether or not

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.620 
and he wouldn't mention whether or not
it's<00:01:35.670> just<00:01:35.790> gonna<00:01:35.880> be<00:01:36.000> like<00:01:36.060> a<00:01:36.150> whole<00:01:36.299> mint<00:01:36.540> or

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
it's just gonna be like a whole mint or

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:37.730

or if it's actually going to be a clue
to<00:01:39.210> something<00:01:39.240> so<00:01:39.900> we'll<00:01:40.049> just<00:01:40.200> have<00:01:40.320> to<00:01:40.380> wait

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
to something so we'll just have to wait

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.260 
to something so we'll just have to wait
for<00:01:40.650> November<00:01:41.159> 22nd<00:01:41.729> and<00:01:41.850> find<00:01:42.000> out<00:01:42.119> for

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
ourselves

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.359 
ourselves
but<00:01:42.899> moving<00:01:43.320> away<00:01:43.409> from<00:01:43.740> all<00:01:43.829> that<00:01:43.860> stuff<00:01:44.220> is

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
but moving away from all that stuff is

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:45.889 
but moving away from all that stuff is
that<00:01:44.520> some<00:01:44.670> unconfirmed<00:01:45.119> sales<00:01:45.360> figures<00:01:45.750> have

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899
