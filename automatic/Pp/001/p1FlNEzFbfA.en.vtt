recently but something like 3 and 4 and
it's<00:01:08.520> even<00:01:08.820> still<00:01:09.149> giving<00:01:09.509> me<00:01:09.540> masters<00:01:10.520> which

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
it's even still giving me masters which

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.030 
it's even still giving me masters which
is<00:01:11.790> not<00:01:12.090> really<00:01:12.119> great<00:01:12.930> if<00:01:13.200> you<00:01:13.229> lose<00:01:13.649> then

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040
