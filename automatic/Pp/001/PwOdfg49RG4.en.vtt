00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
really turn that baby figure all the way

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.770 
really turn that baby figure all the way
up<00:01:52.860> then<00:01:53.610> let's<00:01:53.820> try<00:01:53.880> to<00:01:54.000> turn<00:01:54.210> this<00:01:54.390> gumbo<00:01:54.600> to

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
up then let's try to turn this gumbo to

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:01.390 
up then let's try to turn this gumbo to
be<00:01:56.329> turn<00:01:57.329> that's<00:01:57.539> better

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:01.400

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:03.260 
the goal is to get the bicep as short as

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.140 
the goal is to get the bicep as short as
possible<00:02:03.290> by<00:02:04.010> doing<00:02:04.340> that<00:02:04.460> supination

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:05.150 
possible by doing that supination
