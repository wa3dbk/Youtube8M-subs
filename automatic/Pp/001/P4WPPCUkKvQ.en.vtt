traversing<00:01:18.590> the<00:01:18.680> rooftops<00:01:19.220> was<00:01:19.759> something

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
traversing the rooftops was something

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.030 
traversing the rooftops was something
that<00:01:20.090> seemed<00:01:20.540> a<00:01:20.600> lot<00:01:20.720> more<00:01:20.750> logical<00:01:21.409> jump<00:01:21.799> seem

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:22.040 
that seemed a lot more logical jump seem

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.010 
that seemed a lot more logical jump seem
to<00:01:22.189> be<00:01:22.460> the<00:01:22.640> jump<00:01:22.880> I<00:01:23.000> could<00:01:23.180> make<00:01:23.360> and<00:01:23.780> I<00:01:23.869> always

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
to be the jump I could make and I always

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:25.390 
to be the jump I could make and I always
seem<00:01:24.229> to<00:01:24.320> make<00:01:24.439> it<00:01:24.500> there's<00:01:24.799> always<00:01:25.159> some

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:25.400 
seem to make it there's always some

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.310 
seem to make it there's always some
climbing<00:01:25.880> opportunity<00:01:26.450> that<00:01:26.900> was<00:01:27.020> available

climbing opportunity that was available

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.070 
climbing opportunity that was available
there<00:01:28.000> that<00:01:29.000> addresses<00:01:29.390> I<00:01:29.420> think<00:01:29.689> some<00:01:29.869> of<00:01:29.900> the

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:30.080 
there that addresses I think some of the

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.929 
there that addresses I think some of the
issues<00:01:30.229> I<00:01:30.500> found<00:01:30.860> with<00:01:31.460> especially

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:31.939 
issues I found with especially

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:33.550 
issues I found with especially
Assassin's<00:01:32.390> Creed<00:01:32.600> 3<00:01:32.810> where<00:01:33.110> I<00:01:33.140> found<00:01:33.409> just

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
Assassin's Creed 3 where I found just

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.319 
Assassin's Creed 3 where I found just
running<00:01:33.950> down<00:01:34.130> the<00:01:34.310> street<00:01:34.490> it<00:01:34.939> was<00:01:35.060> a<00:01:35.090> more

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:35.329 
running down the street it was a more

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:36.490 
running down the street it was a more
effective<00:01:35.659> means<00:01:35.990> of<00:01:36.140> getting<00:01:36.259> where<00:01:36.470> I

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
effective means of getting where I

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.020 
effective means of getting where I
needed<00:01:36.710> to<00:01:36.799> go<00:01:36.920> even<00:01:37.280> though<00:01:37.490> the<00:01:37.610> game<00:01:37.820> is

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
needed to go even though the game is

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.240 
needed to go even though the game is
ostensibly<00:01:38.570> more<00:01:38.990> satisfying<00:01:39.500> when<00:01:40.130> you're

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 
ostensibly more satisfying when you're

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:41.260 
ostensibly more satisfying when you're
doing<00:01:40.490> things<00:01:40.610> that<00:01:40.790> most<00:01:40.909> human<00:01:41.240> beings
