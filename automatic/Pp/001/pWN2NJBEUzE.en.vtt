00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:12.230
 hello friends in my personal 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:16.010
 correspondence on youtube question was asked 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:21.350
 very interesting nishtyak deep question 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:24.260
 sounded like men refer to 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:29.630
 so that woman 1 showed to her 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:31.940
 attention interest and say thats that's 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:35.570
 man never marries them 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:40.280
 and marry no spurs that they 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:44.289
 yourself liked without manifestation means 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:47.089
 interest from what I want to say 

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:49.219
 here you can go very deep and far 

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:51.829
 Now if for example we are there at all 

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:55.059
 history we leave then we will see that woman 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:58.399
 always been active here let's say even 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:01:00.979
 bible times go here if there 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:03.049
 leave then look what they did these 

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:05.239
 women who seemed to be laid 

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:07.640
 to be completely clogged with him 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:11.330
 no just did not exist here 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.780
 look like let's say there rivka wife and 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.750
 with 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:17.600
 Isaac how does she mean a manipulated 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.520
 will start there sons who will get 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.260
 blessing and so on i mean 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.470
 women have always been very very 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:26.480
 are active but considering saying it with one 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:29.960
 hand on the other hand the very thought of 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:31.610
 that the girl she would not have to be 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.520
 show interest and 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:37.010
 and attention from something for the sake of but of course 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:40.250
 Soviet society created such 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:42.320
 image that's not only in the Soviet but there 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:46.400
 Turgenev girl if anyone read 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:48.860
 then this is not so all the sublime 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:52.820
 almost all experiences there 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:55.940
 something i'm i'm not knowing what shocking means 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:58.760
 if you show interest to the man and 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:01.880
 do that adequately house only 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:03.200
 God will be glad what joy like this 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.510
 you think you think a good girl 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.740
 pretty as if to her roll a 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:09.950
 suddenly she is touchy 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:12.290
 what if she is offended or in front of him 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.630
 suitable and burn out there what are you sitting here 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.860
 playing the fool will go some coffee here popem 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:20.630
 peace and lo and goodness 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:24.800
 so on this subject they pass you here 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:28.700
 but I wo n't be out anymore so here it is 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:32.570
 first about marrying impatiens 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:35.180
 and so on the same parade as if it 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:39.350
 It should be formed and she as they say on 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:42.380
 heaven is the truth therefore 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:44.840
 if there is harmony between two people and 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:48.250
 these are different people we all thank God different 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:53.630
 and each of us thank god there 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:55.880
 some half somewhere so if 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:58.190
 the promise is correct if your energy 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.960
 right if you are sincere 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:03.440
 interested in man i think that 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:05.690
 ashamed of this interest is not ashamed 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:08.020
 let your life go by itself and 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:10.780
 another person's life is shameful 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:13.760
 how and what a shame is that you 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.270
 but how did he arrange his whole life 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:19.520
 really 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:23.620
 and there is still a phrase I may already be 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:27.530
 talked about her but I will repeat myself once 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:30.380
 I heard it there in one seminar I told me 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:33.860
 I could not immediately take this one but 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:36.650
 sounded like the phrase can't be said for with 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:37.280
 I can not translate English 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:39.740
 to tell 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:43.340
 wrong thing wrong words 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:46.430
 right man you cant say is 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:49.100
 wrong thing to z get out if man 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:51.330
 right that you don't tell him he 

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:54.720
 will understand you correctly 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:56.070
 that is, if you show interest in 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.990
 wrong person 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:00.390
 and I want to say that both girls and 

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:02.370
 as a young man, this actually happens 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:05.520
 much more often than right 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.600
 to people so now if you show interest in 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:09.180
 wrong person 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.920
 he can perceive him completely not 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.080
 so how would you like it well and oh 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.850
 Nothing terrible but nothing terrible if 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:21.410
 you are not crossed any borders that 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:25.500
 the moment is all the way I think so 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:28.020
 dear girl woman who asked 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.030
 this question i want to say show to 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.590
 his interest 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:34.710
 show your interest and you 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:35.250
 see how joyfully they rush you 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:38.280
 to meet 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:40.740
 That's all I watched you know what let's 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:44.010
 I'll tell you one more story when 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:49.100
 I would also again in the girls learn 

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:50.250
 at school and then they go to work and 

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:53.160
 respectively 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:55.950
 but there are girls free and it happens that 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:58.830
 and married also happens to them but they 

00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:01.230
 get into the male team after all 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:03.710
 own company there in the guys 

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:03.710
 work and 

00:05:03.819 --> 00:05:09.710
 men are many like by nature 

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:11.750
 lazy or something 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:13.639
 let's sit at the computer and he's there 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:15.919
 the cat solves some of its problems there 

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:17.659
 writes there or something else and so to him 

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:21.530
 Of course I would like him to have 

00:05:17.659 --> 00:05:24.860
 love and relationships and the woman who is there 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:26.810
 waiting for him there and giving birth to children and so 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:29.120
 further, that is, he certainly would like to but 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:33.740
 here he is sitting at the computer will pass and that 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:35.930
 same young and sitting and suddenly she came on 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:39.560
 work in this organization went by itself 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:41.780
 here he comes this once and he has it 

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:44.030
 and the keyboard falls out of his hands and he 

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:47.060
 stare at her and here 

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:49.099
 in fact it's yours that's why i just 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:51.889
 What are you talking about ? I saw it very, very 

00:05:49.099 --> 00:05:54.050
 many girls who fell into such 

00:05:51.889 --> 00:05:55.879
 but how would the brain be a male collective and and 

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:59.030
 instantly no relationship there 

00:05:55.879 --> 00:06:00.979
 arise and so on in this case 

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:03.590
 the girl attracted attention not 

00:06:00.979 --> 00:06:05.210
 the fact that she somehow showed interest 

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:09.409
 note can be smiled why not 

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:11.419
 smile here and accordingly how are you 

00:06:09.409 --> 00:06:13.099
 can encouraging pi girls can 

00:06:11.419 --> 00:06:15.289
 hope actually neither have them 

00:06:13.099 --> 00:06:21.139
 there and a million tool for this 

00:06:15.289 --> 00:06:23.360
 there is and so on so ok yet 

00:06:21.139 --> 00:06:26.810
 what I want to say men need to pull 

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:28.909
 they need to be shown that you have 

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:30.289
 there is interest that's perfectly correct and 

00:06:28.909 --> 00:06:32.659
 very reasonable and 

00:06:30.289 --> 00:06:33.770
 such action but also from cases from 

00:06:32.659 --> 00:06:36.860
 life will tell funny 

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:39.800
 there was one uncle arrived well the same mine 

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:43.310
 years closer to my such poltinnichek him 

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:44.509
 was and it is literally there for 1 second 

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:46.930
 the day hit the cat 

00:06:44.509 --> 00:06:49.550
 Well, that is, in a coffee shop there with a friend and 

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:51.740
 then he comes up to me and where do you know 

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:54.560
 haiti in a coffee shop here were i'm talking about 

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:58.430
 harry there because before putting there girl after all 

00:06:54.560 --> 00:07:00.289
 coffee pour yeah well so smiled yaga 

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:02.090
 she likes to smile but now if she 

00:07:00.289 --> 00:07:03.889
 we did not smile at us from Belarus 

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:06.440
 thoughts on us so smiled it all 

00:07:03.889 --> 00:07:09.949
 year take off the apron went yummy here 

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:13.089
 so what am I saying that there is a smile 

00:07:09.949 --> 00:07:16.159
 not necessarily a man 

00:07:13.089 --> 00:07:18.289
 It means there to attract some words 

00:07:16.159 --> 00:07:20.240
 or decisive action there grabbing 

00:07:18.289 --> 00:07:22.460
 with his hands and then he smiled already 

00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:25.690
 God dreamed of a poor set 

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:28.699
 so here I am on this upbeat note 

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:30.820
 want to finish showing interest 

00:07:28.699 --> 00:07:33.820
 show them just that and wait 

00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:33.820
 is happy
