is too green tell me then discount for
red<00:02:11.959> in<00:02:12.079> it<00:02:12.230> you<00:02:12.950> can<00:02:13.099> also<00:02:13.340> use<00:02:13.970> the<00:02:14.299> colors

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
red in it you can also use the colors

red in it you can also use the colors
that<00:02:14.959> are<00:02:15.049> in<00:02:15.079> there<00:02:15.440> so<00:02:16.250> if<00:02:16.310> it's<00:02:16.489> too<00:02:16.730> blue

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
that are in there so if it's too blue

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.670 
that are in there so if it's too blue
and<00:02:18.110> it<00:02:18.260> needs<00:02:18.500> to<00:02:18.650> go<00:02:18.889> yellow<00:02:19.930> a<00:02:20.930> green<00:02:21.019> tone

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
and it needs to go yellow a green tone

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.660 
and it needs to go yellow a green tone
you<00:02:22.639> can<00:02:22.670> use<00:02:23.269> the<00:02:24.109> blue<00:02:24.319> that's<00:02:24.590> in<00:02:24.769> there<00:02:25.040> by

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
you can use the blue that's in there by

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:28.020 
you can use the blue that's in there by
adding<00:02:25.970> yellow<00:02:26.350> yellow<00:02:27.350> and<00:02:27.500> blue<00:02:27.799> together

by 1880
and<00:02:33.940> you<00:02:34.209> need<00:02:34.360> to<00:02:34.510> go<00:02:34.660> the<00:02:34.810> red<00:02:35.020> phone<00:02:35.319> you<00:02:35.890> can

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:36.099 
and you need to go the red phone you can

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:38.190 
and you need to go the red phone you can
use<00:02:36.130> one<00:02:36.610> that's<00:02:36.849> on<00:02:37.030> the<00:02:37.060> red<00:02:37.360> tone<00:02:37.660> of<00:02:37.959> the

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
other so with this basic method you're

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.670 
other so with this basic method you're
just<00:02:42.250> going<00:02:42.760> by<00:02:43.090> opposites<00:02:43.780> and<00:02:44.290> you<00:02:44.470> use

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
just going by opposites and you use

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.070 
just going by opposites and you use
what's<00:02:45.040> already<00:02:45.370> in<00:02:45.700> the<00:02:45.730> color<00:02:46.090> to<00:02:46.780> change

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
what's already in the color to change

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.070 
what's already in the color to change
the<00:02:47.290> color<00:02:47.530> so<00:02:48.489> here<00:02:48.520> we<00:02:48.790> go<00:02:49.000> my<00:02:49.450> car<00:02:49.690> is<00:02:49.810> a<00:02:49.900> bit

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
the color so here we go my car is a bit

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.290 
the color so here we go my car is a bit
gray<00:02:50.319> I'm<00:02:51.010> going<00:02:51.250> to<00:02:51.310> go<00:02:51.400> put<00:02:51.760> a<00:02:51.790> little<00:02:52.030> bit

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.300 
gray I'm going to go put a little bit

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:56.790 
gray I'm going to go put a little bit
ready<00:02:53.290> so<00:02:54.280> I've<00:02:54.400> decided<00:02:54.580> that<00:02:54.940> 5<00:02:55.510> 7<00:02:55.959> 6<00:02:56.200> is<00:02:56.530> the

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 
ready so I've decided that 5 7 6 is the

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.729 
ready so I've decided that 5 7 6 is the
tinta<00:02:57.130> that<00:02:57.250> I<00:02:57.310> wanted<00:02:57.580> to<00:02:57.730> use<00:02:57.970> it's<00:02:58.330> a

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
tinta that I wanted to use it's a

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:02.820 
tinta that I wanted to use it's a
magenta<00:02:59.739> so<00:03:00.370> it's<00:03:00.519> on<00:03:00.670> the<00:03:00.880> blue<00:03:01.720> side<00:03:02.140> of<00:03:02.440> the

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830 
magenta so it's on the blue side of the

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:06.509 
magenta so it's on the blue side of the
Reds<00:03:03.660> so<00:03:04.660> we're<00:03:05.200> only<00:03:05.350> going<00:03:05.709> to<00:03:05.860> put<00:03:06.340> the

Reds so we're only going to put the
color<00:03:06.880> the<00:03:07.720> color<00:03:07.930> match<00:03:08.170> into<00:03:08.799> our<00:03:09.160> base<00:03:09.459> coat

color you can never color match the
pearl<00:03:13.000> coat<00:03:13.269> color<00:03:13.569> when<00:03:13.750> you're<00:03:13.810> doing<00:03:14.049> three

so what I'm doing here is just giving
giving<00:03:30.640> myself<00:03:30.730> a<00:03:31.030> quick<00:03:31.799> idea<00:03:32.799> of<00:03:33.220> what<00:03:33.400> it's

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:33.519 
giving myself a quick idea of what it's

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:35.039 
giving myself a quick idea of what it's
going<00:03:33.640> to<00:03:33.700> look<00:03:33.849> like<00:03:33.910> because<00:03:34.480> the<00:03:34.599> old<00:03:34.750> color

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:35.049 
going to look like because the old color

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:36.839 
going to look like because the old color
is<00:03:35.170> still<00:03:35.410> in<00:03:35.500> the<00:03:35.620> spray<00:03:35.860> gun<00:03:36.040> I<00:03:36.250> then<00:03:36.730> just

00:03:36.839 --> 00:03:36.849 
is still in the spray gun I then just

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:39.210 
is still in the spray gun I then just
put<00:03:37.090> that<00:03:37.239> over<00:03:37.390> the<00:03:37.600> stick<00:03:37.870> and<00:03:38.140> we<00:03:38.560> can<00:03:38.769> get

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
put that over the stick and we can get

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.430 
put that over the stick and we can get
an<00:03:39.340> idea<00:03:39.670> where<00:03:39.940> it's<00:03:40.060> going<00:03:40.120> I'm<00:03:40.660> happy<00:03:41.320> with

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
an idea where it's going I'm happy with

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.289 
an idea where it's going I'm happy with
how<00:03:41.769> it<00:03:41.920> went<00:03:42.070> just<00:03:42.250> with<00:03:42.549> that<00:03:42.609> small<00:03:43.000> amount

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:43.299 
how it went just with that small amount

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:45.840 
how it went just with that small amount
so<00:03:43.840> I've<00:03:43.930> just<00:03:44.109> put<00:03:44.290> a<00:03:44.320> bit<00:03:44.500> of<00:03:44.530> reducer<00:03:45.459> back

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:45.850 
so I've just put a bit of reducer back

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:47.970 
so I've just put a bit of reducer back
into<00:03:46.030> the<00:03:46.120> spray<00:03:46.359> gun<00:03:46.540> to<00:03:46.750> flush<00:03:47.019> out<00:03:47.230> the<00:03:47.799> old

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
into the spray gun to flush out the old

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:49.470 
into the spray gun to flush out the old
color<00:03:48.250> so<00:03:48.730> that<00:03:48.819> we're<00:03:48.910> going<00:03:49.000> to<00:03:49.090> get<00:03:49.209> a<00:03:49.239> true

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
color so that we're going to get a true

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.059 
color so that we're going to get a true
reading<00:03:49.720> when<00:03:49.930> we<00:03:50.049> spray<00:03:50.260> out<00:03:50.470> the<00:03:50.620> next<00:03:50.799> coat

00:03:51.059 --> 00:03:51.069

the previous job which I'll then put

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:33.090 
the previous job which I'll then put
that<00:04:30.250> down<00:04:30.460> first<00:04:30.789> as<00:04:31.600> that's<00:04:32.260> why<00:04:32.680> I<00:04:32.710> didn't

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:33.100 
that down first as that's why I didn't

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:36.150 
that down first as that's why I didn't
have<00:04:33.220> to<00:04:33.370> mix<00:04:33.550> up<00:04:33.729> so<00:04:34.000> much<00:04:34.150> of<00:04:34.210> the<00:04:34.570> the<00:04:35.350> fresh

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:36.160 
have to mix up so much of the the fresh

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.760 
have to mix up so much of the the fresh
color<00:04:36.460> so<00:04:37.030> it's<00:04:37.810> a<00:04:37.900> way<00:04:38.020> of<00:04:38.050> saving<00:04:38.350> a<00:04:38.500> couple

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:38.770 
color so it's a way of saving a couple

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:42.510 
color so it's a way of saving a couple
of<00:04:38.830> under<00:04:39.010> mils<00:04:39.190> of<00:04:39.340> paint

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:42.520 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.089 

here<00:04:43.180> we<00:04:43.270> go<00:04:43.449> I'm<00:04:43.569> putting<00:04:43.900> the<00:04:44.080> new<00:04:44.830> color

00:04:45.089 --> 00:04:45.099 
here we go I'm putting the new color

00:04:45.099 --> 00:04:48.270 
here we go I'm putting the new color
over<00:04:45.789> the<00:04:45.910> top<00:04:45.940> of<00:04:46.300> the<00:04:46.449> old<00:04:46.599> card<00:04:46.960> so<00:04:47.740> as<00:04:48.129> you

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.280 
over the top of the old card so as you

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.760 
over the top of the old card so as you
can<00:04:48.370> see<00:04:48.430> I<00:04:48.669> grabbed<00:04:49.300> a<00:04:49.539> separate<00:04:50.440> sprayer

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:50.770 
can see I grabbed a separate sprayer

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.700 
can see I grabbed a separate sprayer
card<00:04:51.190> and<00:04:51.520> then<00:04:51.699> just<00:04:52.330> blocked<00:04:52.629> off<00:04:52.840> a<00:04:53.080> small

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:53.710 
card and then just blocked off a small

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:56.790 
card and then just blocked off a small
section<00:04:54.280> of<00:04:54.490> the<00:04:54.909> old<00:04:55.150> color<00:04:55.479> card<00:04:55.810> so<00:04:56.530> that

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:56.800 
section of the old color card so that

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.770 
section of the old color card so that
when<00:04:57.099> we<00:04:57.220> go<00:04:57.370> and<00:04:57.520> have<00:04:57.639> a<00:04:57.699> look<00:04:57.879> at<00:04:58.030> the<00:04:58.210> new

00:04:58.770 --> 00:04:58.780 
when we go and have a look at the new

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:01.409 
when we go and have a look at the new
color<00:04:59.050> we<00:04:59.349> can<00:04:59.560> actually<00:04:59.770> judge<00:05:00.190> how<00:05:00.490> far<00:05:00.520> that

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:01.419 
color we can actually judge how far that

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:03.960 
color we can actually judge how far that
color<00:05:02.110> that<00:05:02.319> I<00:05:02.409> put<00:05:02.440> in<00:05:02.830> went<00:05:03.310> and<00:05:03.550> whether<00:05:03.849> or

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:03.970 
color that I put in went and whether or

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:05.550 
color that I put in went and whether or
not<00:05:04.030> it<00:05:04.150> went<00:05:04.330> in<00:05:04.419> the<00:05:04.509> right<00:05:04.840> direction<00:05:05.050> so

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:05.560 
not it went in the right direction so

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.460 
not it went in the right direction so
you<00:05:06.159> know<00:05:06.430> for<00:05:07.090> next<00:05:07.210> time<00:05:07.389> well<00:05:07.810> that's<00:05:08.229> gone

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:08.470 
you know for next time well that's gone

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:10.529 
you know for next time well that's gone
too<00:05:08.740> far<00:05:09.009> that's<00:05:09.340> not<00:05:09.490> the<00:05:09.699> wrong<00:05:09.849> that's<00:05:10.360> not

00:05:10.529 --> 00:05:10.539 
too far that's not the wrong that's not

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:11.909 
too far that's not the wrong that's not
the<00:05:10.659> right<00:05:10.780> card<00:05:10.990> that<00:05:11.229> I<00:05:11.259> wanted<00:05:11.500> to<00:05:11.560> put<00:05:11.740> into

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:11.919 
the right card that I wanted to put into

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:15.510 
the right card that I wanted to put into
it<00:05:12.069> so<00:05:13.110> then<00:05:14.110> let<00:05:14.289> that<00:05:14.319> dry<00:05:14.710> off<00:05:14.770> then<00:05:15.099> put<00:05:15.310> the

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:15.520 
it so then let that dry off then put the

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:19.290 
it so then let that dry off then put the
pearl<00:05:15.880> coat<00:05:16.090> color<00:05:16.389> over<00:05:16.630> the<00:05:16.750> top<00:05:18.000> again<00:05:19.000> let

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:19.300 
pearl coat color over the top again let

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:22.770 
pearl coat color over the top again let
that<00:05:19.560> color<00:05:20.560> card<00:05:20.800> dry<00:05:21.069> down<00:05:21.130> and<00:05:22.000> take<00:05:22.630> it

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:22.780 
that color card dry down and take it

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:30.800 
that color card dry down and take it
over<00:05:22.870> and<00:05:23.020> have<00:05:23.139> a<00:05:23.169> look<00:05:23.349> at<00:05:23.470> the<00:05:23.560> car

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:30.810 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:33.920 

so<00:05:31.440> it's<00:05:32.010> a<00:05:32.490> little<00:05:33.000> bit<00:05:33.150> difficult<00:05:33.600> to<00:05:33.660> tell

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:33.930 
so it's a little bit difficult to tell

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:36.560 
so it's a little bit difficult to tell
on<00:05:34.320> the<00:05:34.590> camera<00:05:35.040> but<00:05:35.340> that<00:05:35.790> color<00:05:36.030> is<00:05:36.210> actually

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:36.570 
on the camera but that color is actually

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:38.780 
on the camera but that color is actually
quite<00:05:36.840> good<00:05:36.870> now<00:05:37.290> at<00:05:38.070> the<00:05:38.310> end<00:05:38.430> of<00:05:38.520> this<00:05:38.580> video

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:38.790 
quite good now at the end of this video

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:41.420 
quite good now at the end of this video

little<00:05:43.770> bit<00:05:43.860> dark<00:05:44.130> and<00:05:44.340> then<00:05:44.490> we've<00:05:44.639> also<00:05:44.730> got

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:44.970 
little bit dark and then we've also got

start<00:05:49.410> to<00:05:49.560> see<00:05:49.740> now<00:05:49.980> that<00:05:50.010> that<00:05:50.280> color<00:05:50.550> is

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:50.730 
start to see now that that color is

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:53.000 
start to see now that that color is
actually<00:05:51.060> quite<00:05:51.330> good<00:05:51.360> and<00:05:51.900> you<00:05:52.350> can<00:05:52.530> have<00:05:52.980> a

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:53.010 
actually quite good and you can have a

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:54.409 
actually quite good and you can have a
look<00:05:53.220> at<00:05:53.310> the<00:05:53.430> old<00:05:53.550> colour<00:05:53.910> which<00:05:54.180> was<00:05:54.389> a

00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:54.419 
look at the old colour which was a

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:56.480 
look at the old colour which was a
tagged<00:05:54.720> green<00:05:55.020> which<00:05:55.650> is<00:05:55.770> why<00:05:55.950> we<00:05:56.130> added<00:05:56.250> our

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:56.490 
tagged green which is why we added our

00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:59.659 
tagged green which is why we added our
red<00:05:56.730> so<00:05:57.620> I'm<00:05:58.620> quite<00:05:58.889> happy<00:05:59.070> with<00:05:59.250> that<00:05:59.430> but

00:05:59.659 --> 00:05:59.669 
red so I'm quite happy with that but

00:05:59.669 --> 00:06:01.909 
red so I'm quite happy with that but
it's<00:05:59.880> always<00:06:00.060> good<00:06:00.510> to<00:06:00.810> have<00:06:01.500> a<00:06:01.560> look<00:06:01.770> around

00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:01.919 
it's always good to have a look around

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:03.890 
it's always good to have a look around
the<00:06:02.220> rest<00:06:02.760> of<00:06:02.910> the<00:06:03.000> car<00:06:03.240> so<00:06:03.480> I'm<00:06:03.570> going<00:06:03.840> to

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:03.900 
the rest of the car so I'm going to

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:05.030 
the rest of the car so I'm going to
bring<00:06:04.020> it<00:06:04.140> up<00:06:04.230> here<00:06:04.410> and<00:06:04.560> have<00:06:04.650> a<00:06:04.710> look<00:06:04.860> at<00:06:04.950> the

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:05.040 
bring it up here and have a look at the

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:07.220 
bring it up here and have a look at the
door<00:06:05.280> as<00:06:05.460> well<00:06:05.700> because<00:06:06.360> sometimes<00:06:06.630> you'll

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:07.230 
door as well because sometimes you'll

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:08.840 
door as well because sometimes you'll
find<00:06:07.500> that<00:06:07.680> the<00:06:07.860> cars<00:06:08.100> may<00:06:08.370> have<00:06:08.460> been<00:06:08.610> done

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:08.850 
find that the cars may have been done

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:11.420 
find that the cars may have been done
twice<00:06:09.450> and<00:06:09.840> you<00:06:10.410> could<00:06:10.560> actually<00:06:10.860> only<00:06:11.250> have

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:11.430 
twice and you could actually only have

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:13.580 
twice and you could actually only have
two<00:06:12.000> different<00:06:12.180> colours<00:06:12.600> over<00:06:12.840> there<00:06:13.050> which

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:13.590 
two different colours over there which

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:16.820 
two different colours over there which
it's<00:06:13.980> not<00:06:14.220> the<00:06:14.370> case<00:06:14.550> on<00:06:14.790> this<00:06:14.970> car<00:06:15.240> but<00:06:15.830> so

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:16.830 
it's not the case on this car but so

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:19.760 
it's not the case on this car but so
I've<00:06:16.950> decided<00:06:17.160> to<00:06:17.490> paint<00:06:17.730> this<00:06:17.880> color<00:06:18.770> this

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:19.770 
I've decided to paint this color this

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:21.560 
I've decided to paint this color this
car<00:06:20.070> this<00:06:20.490> car<00:06:20.550> was<00:06:20.880> actually<00:06:21.180> quite<00:06:21.540> a
