00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:15.860
 I hope you have a nice nice day and 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:17.960
 today I'm going to show you my facial routine and 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:20.150
 also the makeup that I use on 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.310
 all because it makes like 5 videos of a 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.020
 girl I wonder what she put on me 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.550
 face what makeup used because 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:28.130
 obviously so that the skin is so 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:30.109
 so perfect she used makeup though 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.360
 if you have seen my videos for some time 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:34.250
 I mentioned that I had cnet and the 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.080
 principle was not so so much in my 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.540
 acne but it was when I started doing 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:41.629
 videos that started to get ugly on Friday 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:43.970
 and also in the ugliest and above all it was 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:45.379
 in this area here from the cheeks and 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.720
 on the right forehead that I 'm going to put 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:49.640
 a photo in fact has enough light that 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:52.699
 photo because according to me with the sun I do not know 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:55.519
 saw but still very very very large 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:57.619
 the granites and very red fortunately 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:59.659
 nowadays I no longer have acne but if 

00:00:57.619 --> 00:01:02.210
 were several months in which I did suffer 

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:04.129
 a lot because of my acne but in this 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.720
 I will talk about this subject if 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:07.549
 they want me to make a video about them 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.680
 products that I used then 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:12.229
 I did to make me take off 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.060
 granites and all that comments below if 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:15.380
 they want that video and first of all they 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:15.890
 I want to send some greetings to some 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.100
 people 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:21.800
 Carla take jimena lager until the 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:24.409
 gabriela zavala danna paola vargas la 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:27.380
 victory a huge kiss and a greeting 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:29.719
 also and let's start 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.880
 The first thing I do after 

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:33.799
 get up is to wash my face I use 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.810
 a soap that the dermatologist sent me 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:37.460
 since I had my skin problem and 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.380
 what this special soap has is 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.270
 that they call that is the brand of 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.399
 home which I use now I like 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.470
 a lot because there is not all the fat in your 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:47.299
 face simply controls it and that's what 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:49.189
 I like it very much because it does not dry out 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:50.960
 too much my skin and what I do is 

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:53.030
 Apply the soap with this sponge that 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.159
 He also sent me the dermatologist and 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.550
 I do in circles and very slowly to 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:59.500
 not hurt my skin 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:02.570
 and then simply at stake when a 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:04.490
 little bit of water and that's it 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.380
 and then to dry my little face at 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.330
 only use is this towel but not 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.640
 that of the stirrup will indicate if not 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.990
 applied with the fingers very gently and 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.700
 make it a towel that only 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:16.340
 use for your face and not for your 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.530
 hands also the next step that is 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.780
 plunder only I do one or two 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.400
 times per week I use this 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.530
 mile that I like a lot too 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.830
 this other exfoliant that I bought it in 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:29.660
 salisbury I believe yes and the only thing I do is 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.270
 apply very very little on my face and 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.100
 make little circles in my face this is going 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:36.110
 to help the dead skin to fall 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.280
 this is not necessary but I like it 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.220
 do it because my skin is very 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.050
 soft and then I just take it off 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.910
 with a little water now I'm going to 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.230
 use this nivea tonic that 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:47.780
 really like it because it helps control 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.940
 the grease on my face and he leaves it I do not know 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.800
 very very soft I love I love the 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.570
 effect that leaves and I will apply it with 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.560
 this cotton very gently and in 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:56.560
 circles in my face 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.750
 I'm not going to let it dry so that my 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.880
 carita absorbs it and the next step is 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.550
 hydration that is to use a theme 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:10.260
 this one of nivea that is special for skin 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:12.540
 fat because it magnifies and helps 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.920
 control the brightness of the face I like 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.959
 a lot and whether they have the skin 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:19.280
 oily or dry is important to all 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:19.280
 hydrate our face 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:26.019
 My face is perfect and ready to 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:28.260
 apply makeup before and 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:28.260
 after 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:31.709
 before you start with makeup 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:34.139
 I want to talk a little about the 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:35.849
 products that I use and how I do it 

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:38.069
 foundation that I now use is 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:39.670
 this distill see the album words time 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:43.150
 page make up 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:45.310
 Yes, it's quite expensive but it's totally worth it 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.560
 the penalty has very good coverage and left 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.750
 a quite natural effect but at the same time 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:52.000
 like that very perfect in the skin the base 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:54.459
 that I used before is this one of esae 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.150
 lauder has maximum coverage and in 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:04:00.580
 true full polka dot outfit all 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:02.410
 this base only uses it now 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:04.660
 for my circles and in fact I do not have 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:07.630
 many dark circles but I really like 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:09.340
 the covers are natural enough and 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:11.800
 also as it is a little clearer than me 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.930
 I took the skin as light 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:15.819
 under my eyes now what I use 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:17.410
 This is obviously still is 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:19.720
 rather lighter but at the same time 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:21.669
 It has very good coverage to apply 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.860
 the makeup the only thing he used this 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:25.570
 I have tried many sponges 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:27.610
 different brands but definitely 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:29.380
 this sponge is the best left one 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:31.060
 very nice finish on the skin very 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:32.800
 perfect and it's pretty easy to 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:34.270
 apply it simply if you want a 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.250
 little bit more coverage you have to 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:38.290
 press on your skin but for 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:40.570
 apply it really you can do it like this 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:42.639
 or pressing on your skin the dust that 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:44.080
 I use to make the base last longer and 

00:04:42.639 --> 00:04:46.659
 that is sealed very well 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:48.729
 is this powder of this melon material not 

00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:50.710
 I have mentioned trillions of millions of 

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:52.629
 times because I like it a lot for example 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:54.939
 for my skin type that is fat I 

00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:57.099
 leaves the skin very well masked but 

00:04:54.939 --> 00:04:59.900
 the time that effect on the natural skin 

00:04:57.099 --> 00:05:01.729
 It tastes a lot and smells delicious 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:03.560
 ok Now I'll show you how 

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:05.389
 I use my makeup to cover those 

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:07.370
 imperfections here you can realize 

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:10.820
 had a small outbreak a few days ago 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:12.380
 nothing serious everything is fine and the only thing 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:14.570
 I do is press very lightly the 

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:16.490
 sponge against my skin and if I want a 

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:18.710
 little bit more coverage simply 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:20.630
 I put a little more pressure but nothing 

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:22.820
 very strong and from this side I also had 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:24.860
 a little outbreak and I do exactly what 

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:26.810
 same pressure does not remove them in my skin 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:29.330
 and around my nose always had 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:30.979
 the redness that I do not like and 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:33.100
 instantly erases it can not be given 

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:33.100
 account 

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:42.070
 here 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:48.100
 and to cover my dark circles that in fact 

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:49.990
 I have a lot but I like to give like this 

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:51.790
 lighting as I told you I'm going to 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:54.160
 use this base I will apply it as 

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:55.780
 the little triangle under the eye and I'm going to 

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:58.150
 blur super super well with the 

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:59.320
 sponge that no edge is visible 

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:01.450
 everything has to be super good 

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:03.190
 blurred and what I like about this 

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:05.200
 base is that it is much clearer than my 

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:07.270
 skin tone then illuminates down 

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:09.490
 I already know that the eyes look more 

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:11.980
 wake up I also like to apply a 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:15.220
 little above the lips and in the 

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:17.890
 chin to illuminate also me 

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:20.140
 love how it looks and finally so that 

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:22.390
 last all the makeup and dry super 

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:24.640

 you know of rimmel london steinman and what 

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:28.360
 I'm going to apply to taps because if I 

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:30.550
 we do as well as it is so with force 

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:32.530
 is going to go the base is erased and you see but 

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:35.980
 that we do not want and this is the result 

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:39.100
 final already with all the makeup lasts me 

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:41.110

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:42.910
