for creating a zentangle drawing started

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.539 
for creating a zentangle drawing started
off<00:01:08.010> making<00:01:08.520> a<00:01:08.909> frame<00:01:09.479> out<00:01:09.869> of<00:01:10.260> pencil<00:01:10.710> as<00:01:10.860> well

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
off making a frame out of pencil as well

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.270 
off making a frame out of pencil as well
as<00:01:11.729> drawing<00:01:12.090> strings<00:01:12.689> or<00:01:13.049> containers<00:01:13.920> for<00:01:14.159> the

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
different patterns from any zentangle is

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.460 
different patterns from any zentangle is
a<00:01:22.380> very<00:01:22.740> relaxing<00:01:23.430> process<00:01:24.030> so<00:01:24.780> during<00:01:25.020> class

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
a very relaxing process so during class

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.520 
a very relaxing process so during class
I<00:01:25.799> notice<00:01:26.159> if<00:01:26.369> myself<00:01:27.000> or<00:01:27.420> if<00:01:27.570> my<00:01:27.780> students<00:01:28.409> are

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
I notice if myself or if my students are

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.910 
I notice if myself or if my students are
perhaps<00:01:28.740> clutching<00:01:29.549> their<00:01:29.700> pen<00:01:29.970> tightly<00:01:30.540> I

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
perhaps clutching their pen tightly I

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.830 
perhaps clutching their pen tightly I
suggest<00:01:31.920> that<00:01:32.100> they<00:01:32.310> hold<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.759> pen<00:01:33.030> like<00:01:33.810> a

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
suggest that they hold the pen like a

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.880 
suggest that they hold the pen like a
feather<00:01:35.210> we<00:01:36.210> pause<00:01:36.540> in<00:01:36.869> class<00:01:37.110> after<00:01:37.590> drawing

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
feather we pause in class after drawing

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.569 
feather we pause in class after drawing
each<00:01:38.280> pattern<00:01:38.750> to<00:01:39.750> savor<00:01:40.140> it<00:01:40.320> and<00:01:40.590> to<00:01:41.220> look<00:01:41.369> at

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
each pattern to savor it and to look at

00:01:41.579 --> 00:02:05.789

it<00:01:41.700> from<00:01:41.850> different<00:01:41.939> angles

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:05.799 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:09.249 

again<00:02:06.799> a<00:02:07.100> pause<00:02:07.759> when<00:02:08.390> a<00:02:08.420> process<00:02:09.050> is

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259
