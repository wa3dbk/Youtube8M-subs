00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.150 
Hospital we've sort of for the first
time<00:00:15.570> showed<00:00:15.900> that<00:00:16.080> there's<00:00:16.260> a<00:00:16.320> gene<00:00:16.619> that

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
time showed that there's a gene that

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.670 
time showed that there's a gene that
makes<00:00:17.369> you<00:00:17.640> insulin<00:00:18.180> sensitive<00:00:18.900> which<00:00:19.470> is<00:00:19.590> the

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
makes you insulin sensitive which is the

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.859 
makes you insulin sensitive which is the
opposite<00:00:20.160> case<00:00:20.490> to<00:00:20.789> diabetes<00:00:21.390> and<00:00:21.630> it's

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
opposite case to diabetes and it's

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.450 
opposite case to diabetes and it's
relevant<00:00:22.199> because<00:00:22.439> if<00:00:22.710> you<00:00:22.859> can<00:00:23.010> imagine<00:00:23.160> if

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
relevant because if you can imagine if

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.710 
relevant because if you can imagine if
you<00:00:23.640> could<00:00:24.080> design<00:00:25.080> a<00:00:25.260> drug<00:00:25.650> to<00:00:25.949> do<00:00:26.099> that<00:00:26.720> that

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
you could design a drug to do that that

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.019 
you could design a drug to do that that
would<00:00:27.869> be<00:00:28.050> really<00:00:28.439> desirable<00:00:29.279> to<00:00:29.490> treat<00:00:29.760> type

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
helped analyze our data and give us

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.249 
helped analyze our data and give us
feedback<00:01:29.850> and<00:01:30.360> then<00:01:30.750> it<00:01:30.869> helps<00:01:30.990> us<00:01:31.229> think

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
feedback and then it helps us think

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:32.810 
feedback and then it helps us think
about<00:01:31.470> future<00:01:31.950> experiments<00:01:32.250> we<00:01:32.549> would<00:01:32.670> like

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
to do as well in terms of knowing that

this analysis is it's what's required
there<00:01:38.670> are<00:01:38.759> those<00:01:38.850> moments<00:01:39.119> where<00:01:39.450> you<00:01:39.540> get

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
there are those moments where you get

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.200 
there are those moments where you get
like<00:01:40.049> that<00:01:40.590> great<00:01:40.860> bit<00:01:41.040> of<00:01:41.070> data<00:01:41.340> back<00:01:41.729> and

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
like that great bit of data back and

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.850 
like that great bit of data back and
it's<00:01:42.479> even<00:01:42.780> better<00:01:42.930> than<00:01:43.110> you<00:01:43.229> expect<00:01:43.649> to<00:01:43.770> get

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
it's even better than you expect to get

it's even better than you expect to get
to<00:01:44.009> me<00:01:44.159> those<00:01:44.939> moments<00:01:45.210> are<00:01:45.420> brilliant<00:01:46.070> one<00:01:47.070> of

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
to me those moments are brilliant one of

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.749 
to me those moments are brilliant one of
the<00:01:47.369> advantages<00:01:48.090> of<00:01:48.149> coming<00:01:48.329> to<00:01:48.780> Oxford<00:01:48.899> is

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:49.759 
the advantages of coming to Oxford is

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:52.910 
the advantages of coming to Oxford is
that<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:51.240> facilities<00:01:52.170> you<00:01:52.200> have<00:01:52.409> for

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
that the facilities you have for

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.469 
that the facilities you have for
research<00:01:53.369> are<00:01:54.119> I<00:01:54.869> would<00:01:55.860> say<00:01:56.149> second<00:01:57.149> to<00:01:57.329> none

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479

at the hospital also you find that there

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.590 
at the hospital also you find that there
are<00:02:05.460> other<00:02:05.579> people<00:02:05.790> who<00:02:06.030> visit<00:02:06.299> from<00:02:06.479> other

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
trees who bring expertise with them and

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.350 
trees who bring expertise with them and
there's<00:02:11.080> very<00:02:11.290> much<00:02:11.530> a<00:02:11.590> trading<00:02:12.190> of

very accessible Oxford has has changed

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.080 
very accessible Oxford has has changed
me<00:02:56.050> I<00:02:56.110> think<00:02:56.410> mainly<00:02:56.650> because<00:02:56.830> of<00:02:56.980> what<00:02:57.910> the

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
me I think mainly because of what the

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.480 
me I think mainly because of what the
DPhil<00:02:58.480> has<00:02:58.660> has<00:02:59.170> forced<00:02:59.530> me<00:02:59.620> to<00:02:59.650> do<00:02:59.920> and<00:03:00.130> the

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:00.490 
DPhil has has forced me to do and the

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:02.400 
DPhil has has forced me to do and the
things<00:03:00.820> I've<00:03:01.000> learnt<00:03:01.240> there<00:03:01.540> again<00:03:02.080> sort<00:03:02.380> of

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
things I've learnt there again sort of

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:04.949 
things I've learnt there again sort of
the<00:03:02.590> the<00:03:03.280> independence<00:03:03.910> and<00:03:04.780> so

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
the the independence and so

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:07.320 
the the independence and so
self-discipline<00:03:05.680> I've<00:03:05.890> had<00:03:06.070> to<00:03:06.280> improve<00:03:07.060> for

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
self-discipline I've had to improve for

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.180 
self-discipline I've had to improve for
my<00:03:07.480> default<00:03:07.780> studies<00:03:08.080> has<00:03:08.230> actually<00:03:08.590> spilled

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
my default studies has actually spilled

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.040 
my default studies has actually spilled
over<00:03:09.280> into<00:03:09.520> just<00:03:09.850> life<00:03:10.209> in<00:03:10.450> general<00:03:10.660> and<00:03:10.900> I

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:11.050 
over into just life in general and I

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:12.120 
over into just life in general and I
think<00:03:11.230> that<00:03:11.470> has<00:03:11.560> changed<00:03:11.740> my<00:03:11.920> character

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130 
think that has changed my character

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:15.150 
think that has changed my character
quite<00:03:12.519> a<00:03:12.550> bit<00:03:12.790> I<00:03:13.019> think<00:03:14.019> it's<00:03:14.200> a<00:03:14.410> place<00:03:14.830> that

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
quite a bit I think it's a place that

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.690 
quite a bit I think it's a place that
few<00:03:16.150> people<00:03:16.390> forget<00:03:16.930> and<00:03:17.290> lots<00:03:18.040> of<00:03:18.220> people<00:03:18.430> end

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
few people forget and lots of people end
