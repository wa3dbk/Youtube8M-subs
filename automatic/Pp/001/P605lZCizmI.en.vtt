me why because 20 years ago one of the
first<00:00:06.359> things<00:00:06.629> I<00:00:06.779> came<00:00:07.049> across<00:00:07.200> after<00:00:07.649> I<00:00:07.830> met

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
first things I came across after I met

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.230 
first things I came across after I met
that<00:00:08.160> psychic<00:00:08.670> and<00:00:09.000> a<00:00:09.710> constant<00:00:10.710> theme<00:00:11.059> was<00:00:12.059> of

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
that psychic and a constant theme was of

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.150 
that psychic and a constant theme was of
a<00:00:12.330> vibrational<00:00:13.049> change<00:00:13.320> that<00:00:13.650> was<00:00:13.769> coming

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
a vibrational change that was coming

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.580 
a vibrational change that was coming
that<00:00:14.910> was<00:00:15.059> going<00:00:15.299> to<00:00:15.389> wait<00:00:15.599> humanity<00:00:16.170> up<00:00:16.350> from

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
that was going to wait humanity up from

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.810 
that was going to wait humanity up from
its<00:00:16.740> coma<00:00:17.930> it's<00:00:18.930> sleeping<00:00:19.410> beauty<00:00:19.470> state<00:00:20.340> I'll

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
its coma it's sleeping beauty state I'll

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.929 
its coma it's sleeping beauty state I'll
give<00:00:20.970> people<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.330> sunglasses<00:00:21.720> yeah<00:00:22.529> and<00:00:22.939> and

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
give people the sunglasses yeah and and

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.660 
give people the sunglasses yeah and and
the<00:00:24.480> other<00:00:24.600> theme<00:00:24.930> was<00:00:25.140> that<00:00:25.320> this<00:00:25.670> energetic

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
the other theme was that this energetic

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.019 
the other theme was that this energetic
change<00:00:27.380> was<00:00:28.380> going<00:00:29.010> to<00:00:29.189> bring<00:00:29.460> to<00:00:29.699> the<00:00:29.820> surface

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
change was going to bring to the surface

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.420 
change was going to bring to the surface
all<00:00:30.510> that<00:00:30.869> had<00:00:30.990> been<00:00:31.170> hidden<00:00:31.410> from<00:00:31.679> humanity

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
all that had been hidden from humanity

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.200 
all that had been hidden from humanity
and<00:00:34.010> there<00:00:35.010> was<00:00:35.160> no<00:00:35.309> sign<00:00:35.579> of<00:00:35.760> either<00:00:35.880> at<00:00:36.120> the

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
and there was no sign of either at the

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.770 
and there was no sign of either at the
time<00:00:36.860> but<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:38.100> theme<00:00:38.430> was<00:00:38.670> so<00:00:38.850> powerful<00:00:39.149> that

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
time but the theme was so powerful that

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.910 
time but the theme was so powerful that
I<00:00:40.940> called<00:00:41.940> these<00:00:42.239> this<00:00:42.690> new<00:00:42.960> energetic<00:00:43.530> change

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
I called these this new energetic change

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.760 
I called these this new energetic change
the<00:00:44.340> truth<00:00:44.640> vibrations<00:00:45.390> in<00:00:45.600> fact<00:00:45.870> my<00:00:46.440> first

book I ever wrote after my awakening
mind<00:00:51.210> explosion<00:00:52.070> was<00:00:53.070> called<00:00:53.340> truth

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
mind explosion was called truth

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.459 
mind explosion was called truth
vibrations<00:00:54.239> after<00:00:54.690> this<00:00:54.840> energetic<00:00:55.170> change

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
vibrations after this energetic change

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.069 
vibrations after this energetic change
that's<00:00:55.710> 20<00:00:55.980> years<00:00:56.010> ago<00:00:56.190> right<00:00:56.399> at<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.579> start

00:00:57.069 --> 00:00:57.079 
that's 20 years ago right at the start

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:00.410 
that's 20 years ago right at the start
and<00:00:58.079> as<00:00:58.289> these<00:00:58.500> 20<00:00:58.800> years<00:00:58.980> have<00:00:59.100> passed<00:00:59.129> I<00:00:59.789> have

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
and as these 20 years have passed I have

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.460 
and as these 20 years have passed I have
seen<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:01.350> truth<00:01:01.710> vibrations<00:01:03.470> demonstrably

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
seen the truth vibrations demonstrably

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.060 
seen the truth vibrations demonstrably
more<00:01:04.949> and<00:01:05.159> more<00:01:05.369> with<00:01:05.610> every<00:01:05.640> passing<00:01:06.299> year

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
more and more with every passing year

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.429 
more and more with every passing year
awaken<00:01:08.070> more<00:01:08.610> and<00:01:08.790> more<00:01:08.939> and<00:01:09.119> more<00:01:09.180> people<00:01:09.510> to

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
awaken more and more and more people to

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.820 
awaken more and more and more people to
a<00:01:10.470> much<00:01:10.950> more<00:01:11.250> expanded<00:01:12.470> perception<00:01:13.470> of<00:01:13.530> self

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
a much more expanded perception of self

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.920 
a much more expanded perception of self
in<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.070> world<00:01:14.310> it's<00:01:14.970> happening<00:01:15.509> and<00:01:15.659> it's

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
in the world it's happening and it's

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.600 
in the world it's happening and it's
happening<00:01:15.990> faster<00:01:16.950> and<00:01:17.070> faster<00:01:17.250> on<00:01:17.520> an

happening faster and faster on an
exponential<00:01:18.119> curve<00:01:18.330> and<00:01:19.110> then<00:01:19.619> you<00:01:19.799> look<00:01:20.040> at

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
exponential curve and then you look at

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.330 
exponential curve and then you look at
what<00:01:20.310> we<00:01:20.610> new<00:01:20.850> feel<00:01:21.360> about<00:01:21.770> what<00:01:22.770> was<00:01:22.920> going<00:01:23.100> on

that's<00:01:32.939> all<00:01:33.750> this<00:01:33.960> remained<00:01:34.290> hidden<00:01:34.470> will<00:01:34.680> be

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
that's all this remained hidden will be

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.050 
that's all this remained hidden will be
brought<00:01:34.979> to<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.220> surface<00:01:35.250> that's<00:01:35.759> what<00:01:35.880> I<00:01:35.909> was

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
brought to the surface that's what I was

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.210 
brought to the surface that's what I was
told<00:01:36.180> twenty<00:01:36.509> years<00:01:36.659> ago<00:01:36.840> and<00:01:37.079> it's<00:01:37.320> and<00:01:38.070> it's

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
told twenty years ago and it's and it's

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.069 
told twenty years ago and it's and it's
happening<00:01:38.640> and<00:01:39.090> what<00:01:39.390> I<00:01:39.420> suggest<00:01:39.540> is

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
happening and what I suggest is

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.050 
happening and what I suggest is
happening<00:01:40.409> I<00:01:40.439> mean<00:01:40.729> people<00:01:41.729> have<00:01:41.820> to<00:01:41.850> just

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
happening I mean people have to just

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.389 
happening I mean people have to just
feel<00:01:42.210> what<00:01:42.570> they<00:01:42.689> think<00:01:43.170> about<00:01:43.259> it<00:01:43.560> is<00:01:44.100> that

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
feel what they think about it is that

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.280 
feel what they think about it is that
what<00:01:44.610> we're<00:01:44.790> going<00:01:45.060> through<00:01:45.090> is<00:01:45.570> at<00:01:45.930> up<00:01:46.110> there

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
what we're going through is at up there

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.899 
what we're going through is at up there
about<00:01:46.470> this<00:01:46.649> vibrational<00:01:47.840> base<00:01:48.840> construct

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:49.909 
about this vibrational base construct

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:52.899 
about this vibrational base construct
which<00:01:50.909> is<00:01:51.119> coming<00:01:52.110> out<00:01:52.259> of<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.409> black<00:01:52.590> holes

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:52.909 
which is coming out of the black holes

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:56.840 
which is coming out of the black holes

a<00:02:13.530> kind<00:02:14.070> of<00:02:14.130> a<00:02:14.190> saturn<00:02:14.610> period<00:02:15.090> and<00:02:15.750> I<00:02:16.110> think

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
a kind of a saturn period and I think

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.510 
a kind of a saturn period and I think
that's<00:02:16.500> very<00:02:16.740> significant

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
that's very significant

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.310 
that's very significant
Saturn's<00:02:18.030> very<00:02:18.270> much<00:02:18.450> involved<00:02:18.870> in<00:02:18.990> this<00:02:19.110> and

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
Saturn's very much involved in this and

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:20.930 
Saturn's very much involved in this and
this<00:02:19.380> this<00:02:19.800> keep<00:02:20.070> up<00:02:20.250> we're<00:02:20.400> coming<00:02:20.670> out<00:02:20.790> of

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
this this keep up we're coming out of

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.300 
this this keep up we're coming out of
Saturn<00:02:21.930> yeah<00:02:22.140> and<00:02:22.350> and<00:02:22.560> and<00:02:22.740> we're<00:02:23.070> going<00:02:23.220> to

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
Saturn yeah and and and we're going to

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.620 
Saturn yeah and and and we're going to
find<00:02:23.550> out<00:02:23.840> why<00:02:24.840> Saturn<00:02:25.380> has<00:02:25.530> so<00:02:25.740> many<00:02:25.890> moons<00:02:26.630> as

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
find out why Saturn has so many moons as

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.570 
find out why Saturn has so many moons as
we<00:02:27.900> go<00:02:28.050> along<00:02:28.200> anyway<00:02:28.800> and<00:02:29.160> that's<00:02:29.280> there<00:02:29.460> for

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
we go along anyway and that's there for

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.350 
we go along anyway and that's there for
another<00:02:29.820> day<00:02:30.140> so<00:02:31.140> as<00:02:31.350> this<00:02:31.650> energy<00:02:32.360> changes

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
another day so as this energy changes

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.910 
another day so as this energy changes
it's<00:02:33.750> triggering<00:02:34.680> different<00:02:35.780> photon

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
it's triggering different photon

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.120 
it's triggering different photon
information<00:02:38.600> from<00:02:39.600> from<00:02:39.990> the<00:02:40.140> Suns<00:02:40.440> in<00:02:40.770> this

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
information from from the Suns in this

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.390 
information from from the Suns in this
case<00:02:41.370> our<00:02:41.640> Sun<00:02:42.090> and<00:02:42.360> so<00:02:42.990> people<00:02:43.680> are<00:02:43.920> starting

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
case our Sun and so people are starting

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.000 
case our Sun and so people are starting
to<00:02:44.430> those<00:02:45.360> more<00:02:45.660> open<00:02:45.990> to<00:02:46.080> it<00:02:46.110> first<00:02:46.530> are

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
to those more open to it first are

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.650 
to those more open to it first are
starting<00:02:47.640> to<00:02:47.850> decode<00:02:48.480> a<00:02:48.750> different<00:02:50.660> base

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
starting to decode a different base

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.560 
starting to decode a different base
information<00:02:52.459> construct<00:02:53.459> and<00:02:53.970> what<00:02:54.240> that's

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
information construct and what that's

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.920 
information construct and what that's
doing<00:02:54.959> is<00:02:55.320> changing<00:02:55.860> their<00:02:56.430> perception<00:02:57.330> as<00:02:57.510> we

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
doing is changing their perception as we

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.550 
doing is changing their perception as we
decode<00:02:58.890> it<00:02:59.070> and<00:02:59.760> move<00:03:00.090> into<00:03:00.420> a<00:03:00.600> different<00:03:00.870> era

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
decode it and move into a different era

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:07.400 
decode it and move into a different era
if<00:03:02.250> you<00:03:03.590> put<00:03:05.630> information<00:03:06.630> on<00:03:06.780> a<00:03:06.810> software

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
if you put information on a software

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:10.130 
if you put information on a software
disk<00:03:07.740> it<00:03:08.459> will<00:03:08.640> manifest<00:03:08.880> that<00:03:09.420> on<00:03:09.660> the<00:03:09.870> screen

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
disk it will manifest that on the screen

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.580 
disk it will manifest that on the screen
if<00:03:10.590> you<00:03:11.430> change<00:03:12.180> the<00:03:12.750> information<00:03:13.380> on<00:03:13.470> the

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
if you change the information on the

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.620 
if you change the information on the
software<00:03:14.010> disk<00:03:14.310> is<00:03:14.550> no<00:03:14.790> way<00:03:15.120> it's<00:03:15.360> going<00:03:15.510> to

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
software disk is no way it's going to

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:17.780 
software disk is no way it's going to
manifest<00:03:15.810> the<00:03:16.560> same<00:03:16.860> stuff<00:03:17.160> on<00:03:17.340> the<00:03:17.489> screen

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
manifest the same stuff on the screen

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.550 
manifest the same stuff on the screen
you've<00:03:18.060> just<00:03:18.330> changed<00:03:19.200> the<00:03:19.350> basic

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
you've just changed the basic

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.250 
you've just changed the basic
information<00:03:20.430> construct<00:03:21.420> of<00:03:21.570> which<00:03:22.019> that

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
information construct of which that

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.500 
information construct of which that
screen<00:03:22.620> is<00:03:22.769> a<00:03:22.800> projection<00:03:23.430> so<00:03:23.850> what's<00:03:24.269> on<00:03:24.480> the

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
screen is a projection so what's on the

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.750 
screen is a projection so what's on the
screen<00:03:24.780> must<00:03:25.140> change<00:03:25.440> and<00:03:25.709> and<00:03:26.280> what<00:03:26.580> we're

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
screen must change and and what we're

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.160 
screen must change and and what we're
doing<00:03:26.790> is<00:03:27.180> we're<00:03:27.330> going<00:03:27.480> through<00:03:27.780> this<00:03:27.930> period

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
doing is we're going through this period

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.759 
doing is we're going through this period
now<00:03:28.560> of<00:03:28.830> fantastic<00:03:30.140> energetic<00:03:31.140> change<00:03:31.440> and

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769 
now of fantastic energetic change and

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:34.670 
now of fantastic energetic change and
we're<00:03:32.040> moving<00:03:32.670> more<00:03:33.150> and<00:03:33.180> more<00:03:33.450> into<00:03:33.810> a<00:03:34.320> new

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
we're moving more and more into a new

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.979 
we're moving more and more into a new
epoch<00:03:35.040> of<00:03:35.660> expansion<00:03:36.660> of<00:03:37.400> harmony<00:03:38.400> of<00:03:38.600> love<00:03:39.600> of

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
epoch of expansion of harmony of love of

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:42.410 
epoch of expansion of harmony of love of
understanding<00:03:40.320> of<00:03:41.220> awareness<00:03:41.670> all<00:03:42.060> the

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
understanding of awareness all the

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.810 
understanding of awareness all the
things<00:03:42.720> that<00:03:43.080> people<00:03:43.410> call<00:03:43.680> utopia<00:03:44.340> we're

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
things that people call utopia we're

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:47.449 
things that people call utopia we're
moving<00:03:45.330> into<00:03:45.600> it<00:03:45.930> and<00:03:46.140> this<00:03:46.560> is<00:03:46.709> why<00:03:46.890> I<00:03:46.920> say<00:03:47.280> and

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
moving into it and this is why I say and

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:48.470 
moving into it and this is why I say and
they<00:03:47.640> say<00:03:47.880> in<00:03:47.940> the<00:03:48.030> book<00:03:48.180> and<00:03:48.209> I've<00:03:48.390> been

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:48.480 
they say in the book and I've been

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.289 
they say in the book and I've been
saying<00:03:48.720> it<00:03:48.840> for<00:03:48.900> years<00:03:49.049> to<00:03:49.500> to<00:03:50.190> to<00:03:50.549> be<00:03:50.670> fair<00:03:50.940> is

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
saying it for years to to to be fair is

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:56.360 
saying it for years to to to be fair is
that<00:03:51.989> what<00:03:52.709> it's<00:03:53.519> no<00:03:54.049> coincidence<00:03:55.220> but<00:03:56.220> it's

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
that what it's no coincidence but it's

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.210 
that what it's no coincidence but it's
that<00:03:56.549> this<00:03:56.790> time<00:03:57.209> of<00:03:57.570> all<00:03:57.810> times<00:03:58.170> that<00:03:58.950> the

00:06:24.539 --> 00:06:26.570 
lid on this they can't they can't we are
now<00:06:24.870> at<00:06:25.020> a<00:06:25.080> cusp<00:06:25.380> and<00:06:25.620> therefore<00:06:26.039> there's<00:06:26.310> lots

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:26.580 
now at a cusp and therefore there's lots

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:28.850 
now at a cusp and therefore there's lots
of<00:06:26.759> this<00:06:26.970> because<00:06:27.659> this<00:06:27.840> is<00:06:27.900> now<00:06:28.259> fading<00:06:28.590> out

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:28.860 
of this because this is now fading out

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:30.290 
of this because this is now fading out
but<00:06:29.099> it's<00:06:29.220> still<00:06:29.310> there<00:06:29.699> and<00:06:29.849> trying<00:06:30.060> to<00:06:30.150> hang

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:30.300 
but it's still there and trying to hang

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:30.620 
but it's still there and trying to hang
on

this<00:06:30.930> is<00:06:31.110> coming<00:06:31.470> in<00:06:31.590> more<00:06:31.800> and<00:06:31.889> more<00:06:31.949> with

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:32.190 
this is coming in more and more with

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:33.499 
this is coming in more and more with
every<00:06:32.400> day<00:06:32.550> in<00:06:32.669> every<00:06:32.909> hour<00:06:33.060> she's<00:06:33.360> gonna

00:06:33.499 --> 00:06:33.509 
every day in every hour she's gonna

00:06:33.509 --> 00:06:35.899 
every day in every hour she's gonna
transfer<00:06:34.050> transform<00:06:34.710> this<00:06:34.830> reality<00:06:35.190> from<00:06:35.849> a

00:06:35.899 --> 00:06:35.909 
transfer transform this reality from a

00:06:35.909 --> 00:06:38.269 
transfer transform this reality from a
prison<00:06:36.210> to<00:06:36.300> a<00:06:36.330> paradise<00:06:36.870> and<00:06:37.110> we<00:06:37.919> are<00:06:38.070> going<00:06:38.219> to

00:06:38.269 --> 00:06:38.279 
prison to a paradise and we are going to

see<00:06:38.550> this<00:06:39.330> control<00:06:39.870> system

00:06:40.879 --> 00:06:40.889 
see this control system

00:06:40.889 --> 00:06:43.159 
see this control system
coming<00:06:41.189> down<00:06:41.400> uh<00:06:41.819> you<00:06:42.629> know<00:06:42.749> people<00:06:43.050> talk

00:06:43.159 --> 00:06:43.169 
coming down uh you know people talk

00:06:43.169 --> 00:06:45.649 
coming down uh you know people talk
about<00:06:43.289> 2012<00:06:43.979> again<00:06:44.490> 2012<00:06:45.090> kind<00:06:45.240> of<00:06:45.330> comes<00:06:45.479> into

00:06:45.649 --> 00:06:45.659 
about 2012 again 2012 kind of comes into

00:06:45.659 --> 00:06:47.029 
about 2012 again 2012 kind of comes into
this<00:06:45.870> in<00:06:45.990> the<00:06:46.080> sense<00:06:46.289> of<00:06:46.439> the<00:06:46.560> talk<00:06:46.710> about<00:06:46.919> an

00:06:47.029 --> 00:06:47.039 
this in the sense of the talk about an

00:06:47.039 --> 00:06:47.869 
this in the sense of the talk about an
epoch<00:06:47.310> change

00:06:47.869 --> 00:06:47.879 
epoch change

00:06:47.879 --> 00:06:50.300 
epoch change
I<00:06:47.909> think<00:06:48.419> 2012<00:06:48.960> is<00:06:49.050> much<00:06:49.379> overrated<00:06:49.830> I<00:06:50.069> think

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:50.310 
I think 2012 is much overrated I think

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:52.010 
I think 2012 is much overrated I think
it's<00:06:50.729> greatest<00:06:51.150> importance<00:06:51.629> is<00:06:51.749> it's<00:06:51.930> not

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:52.020 
it's greatest importance is it's not

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:55.100 
it's greatest importance is it's not
2011<00:06:52.740> but<00:06:53.639> 2013<00:06:54.360> is<00:06:54.479> even<00:06:54.629> more<00:06:54.749> important

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:55.110 
2011 but 2013 is even more important

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:56.719 
2011 but 2013 is even more important
than<00:06:55.139> 2012<00:06:55.650> because<00:06:55.860> this<00:06:56.009> energetic<00:06:56.370> change

00:06:56.719 --> 00:06:56.729 
than 2012 because this energetic change

00:06:56.729 --> 00:06:59.749 
than 2012 because this energetic change
is<00:06:56.879> gathering<00:06:57.569> pace<00:06:57.840> and<00:06:58.259> and<00:06:58.680> and<00:06:58.919> impact<00:06:59.550> all

00:06:59.749 --> 00:06:59.759 
is gathering pace and and and impact all

00:06:59.759 --> 00:07:01.969 
is gathering pace and and and impact all
the<00:06:59.849> time<00:07:00.090> and<00:07:00.509> are<00:07:01.259> you<00:07:01.379> saying<00:07:01.680> that<00:07:01.770> when<00:07:01.919> I

00:07:01.969 --> 00:07:01.979 
the time and are you saying that when I

say by 2016-17 mate this control systems
coming<00:07:05.550> down<00:07:05.879> we're<00:07:06.509> going<00:07:06.749> to<00:07:06.840> start<00:07:07.139> to<00:07:07.379> see

00:07:07.399 --> 00:07:07.409 
coming down we're going to start to see

00:07:07.409 --> 00:07:10.219 
coming down we're going to start to see
a<00:07:07.889> completely<00:07:08.639> different<00:07:08.849> world<00:07:09.300> because<00:07:10.020> we

00:07:10.219 --> 00:07:10.229 
a completely different world because we

00:07:10.229 --> 00:07:12.409 
a completely different world because we
will<00:07:10.409> be<00:07:10.560> manifesting<00:07:11.279> and<00:07:11.400> decoding<00:07:12.029> into

will be manifesting and decoding into

00:07:12.419 --> 00:07:14.839 
will be manifesting and decoding into

00:07:17.119 --> 00:07:17.129 
control system doomed you're saying this

00:07:17.129 --> 00:07:19.339

is<00:07:17.279> the<00:07:17.310> end<00:07:17.430> game<00:07:17.969> and<00:07:18.000> we<00:07:18.449> need<00:07:18.479> to<00:07:18.810> be<00:07:18.930> awake

00:07:19.339 --> 00:07:19.349 
is the end game and we need to be awake

00:07:19.349 --> 00:07:21.649 
is the end game and we need to be awake
enough<00:07:19.770> to<00:07:19.830> take<00:07:20.400> advantage<00:07:20.939> of<00:07:21.120> the<00:07:21.479> good

00:07:21.649 --> 00:07:21.659 
enough to take advantage of the good

00:07:21.659 --> 00:07:23.420 
enough to take advantage of the good
stuff<00:07:21.900> that's<00:07:22.110> happening<00:07:22.590> yeah<00:07:22.860> the<00:07:23.099> thing<00:07:23.310> is

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:23.430 
stuff that's happening yeah the thing is

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:25.969 
stuff that's happening yeah the thing is
I<00:07:23.550> overthrow<00:07:24.210> the<00:07:24.719> tyranny<00:07:24.930> if<00:07:25.409> you<00:07:25.560> like<00:07:25.740> is

00:07:25.969 --> 00:07:25.979 
I overthrow the tyranny if you like is

00:07:25.979 --> 00:07:27.080 
I overthrow the tyranny if you like is
that<00:07:26.039> what<00:07:26.219> you're<00:07:26.340> saying<00:07:26.610> we've<00:07:26.819> got<00:07:26.969> pretty

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:27.090 
that what you're saying we've got pretty

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:29.420 
that what you're saying we've got pretty
words<00:07:27.300> in<00:07:27.389> your<00:07:27.449> mouth<00:07:27.599> well<00:07:28.080> no<00:07:28.259> I<00:07:28.590> use<00:07:29.250> this

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:29.430 
words in your mouth well no I use this

00:07:29.430 --> 00:07:30.860 
words in your mouth well no I use this
this<00:07:29.729> analogy<00:07:30.090> all<00:07:30.270> the<00:07:30.360> time<00:07:30.539> we're<00:07:30.750> at<00:07:30.810> a

this analogy all the time we're at a

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:33.379 
this analogy all the time we're at a
fork<00:07:31.050> in<00:07:31.199> the<00:07:31.259> road<00:07:31.349> and<00:07:31.939> people<00:07:32.939> can<00:07:33.120> choose

00:07:33.379 --> 00:07:33.389 
fork in the road and people can choose

00:07:33.389 --> 00:07:35.839 
fork in the road and people can choose
to<00:07:33.629> stay<00:07:34.169> in<00:07:34.349> this<00:07:34.469> epoch<00:07:34.680> which<00:07:35.310> is<00:07:35.460> a<00:07:35.490> dying

00:07:35.839 --> 00:07:35.849 
to stay in this epoch which is a dying

00:07:35.849 --> 00:07:38.659 
to stay in this epoch which is a dying

epoch it's energetic construct is being
dismantled<00:07:38.999> and<00:07:39.689> like<00:07:39.870> I<00:07:39.900> say<00:07:40.169> when<00:07:40.379> that

00:07:40.489 --> 00:07:40.499 
dismantled and like I say when that

00:07:40.499 --> 00:07:42.409 
dismantled and like I say when that
