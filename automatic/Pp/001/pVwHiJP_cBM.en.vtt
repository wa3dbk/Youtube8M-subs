00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:14.300
 ga the chrom was a proto draco of 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:15.980
 oversize proportions its size was 

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:19.010
 greater than that of all aspects 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:21.680
 together and his roar could be heard at 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:24.230
 miles around while the 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:27.640
 flapping its wings generated great 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:30.230
 winds with the passage of time 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:33.590
 mutations such as limbs and eyes 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:36.110
 they grew all over his body since 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.850
 originally his body was not like that is believed 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:40.160
 that these mutations are caused by 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:43.519
 the cannibalism that he practiced towards his 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:45.050
 congeners also as a result of the 

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:47.989
 absorption of the essence of life from 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:51.440
 the products their victims returned to 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:53.540
 life as undead the proto dragos 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:56.629
 they were frightened by the presence of 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:59.180
 gala chrome one day when a dozen 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:00.909
 they left hunting gala cron 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:04.820
 appeared and took his prey 

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:07.310
 terrorizing the present husbands a 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.780
 proto draco blue and white wondered 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.850
 why the gigantic proto draco 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:14.119
 I would hunt in an area where never before 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:16.549
 had been in the tsar jon his new 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:20.240
 friend replied that he had gone to look 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:22.880
 more food however that answer does not 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.700
 liked to Mali Goss who pointed out that the 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.740
 food that cron had gone to look for 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.990
 it was his 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.720
 when the proto drakos started to 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.950
 die brutally and converted 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:36.979
 subsequently in skin shells and 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.979
 bones bad figs suspected that gala 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:41.840
 Gronda had been related to it 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:45.049
 a terrified proto violet drake 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:48.229
 cried inconsolably that his friends 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:50.390
 they had been swallowed which reinforced 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:52.720
 the theories of the dragon in which a 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:55.130
 future would be the appearance of the blue flight 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.590
 it took a while until gala chrome 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:00.950
 began to devour the proto dragos by 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:03.649
 dozens nobody understood why gala cron 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.810
 he ate his kind but 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:07.009
 refusing to live with fear and with 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.470
 possibility of being your next 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:13.470
 victims confronted him 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.870
 galleys that sent this era through 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.780
 Malian eyes gosh realized that 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:21.720
 the chrome gala neck was swollen 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:23.730
 the gigantic terror finally mutated 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.220
 drowned thanks to that bad figs in 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:29.280
 the tsar john managed to put a rock in 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.110
 the throat of the same the remains of gala 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.110
 chrome are currently in the 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:36.720
 graveyard of dragons during the war 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:39.120
 against the exanimate king the great black 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:42.560
 Mr. Antioch tried to return the 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:44.580
 life as not dead but without success 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.100
 later after the cataclysm 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.900
 caused by death the hammer 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.270
 Twilight used the remains of the proto 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:54.240
 fallen grain to jump towards their 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:56.440
 companions as they headed towards the 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:58.870
 Temple of the Rest of the Dragon 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:03.070
 it is said that said temple was built 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:05.470
 in his memory which was also the 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:08.070
 place where the aspects were 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.070
 blessed
