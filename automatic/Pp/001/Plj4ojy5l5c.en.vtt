00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.740
 bit of another that I already had because 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.960
 we are in you are baking one and 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.000
 we go then to level or less the 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.029
 first we have biscuit maria mújica 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.699
 Díaz and Gwyneth and Maria's is Maria's 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.199
 of uploading not exactly how much it will weigh 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.240
 more or less one this is how it feels 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.000
 will be revenge because two try a 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.250
 little tube is going to go out for two countries 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
 guys or one big one back then already 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.400
 that we have the humanity magazine 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.180
 we put in a mold you give me the 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.730
 creature is little 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.220
 melted butter I put them melting 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.870
 in the microwave in a pot what is 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:46.710
 make them more practical 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.200
 Yes and a splash of milk is not 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.540
 exists 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:53.030
 more or less like a teaspoon more 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:55.520
 Aradillas exactly if they need 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.770
 cookie we can put a little more 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:01.060
 detail 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:01.060
 if we revolve it very well 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:09.220
 very well to integrate all all the 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:09.220
 ingredients very well 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:16.160
 and then we make a little ball since 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:21.910
 we have the little ball in the middle with our 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:21.910
 palm we're not crushing the sword 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:27.909
 that everything in our mold is already covered 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:30.170
 that we have it covered with the three 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:33.049
 We will raise your fingers 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:35.450
 no matter that they are little eyes because it is 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:38.600
 again we crush him again and he 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:41.979
 returns to make more uniform returns to be 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.979
 uniform very well 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:50.060
 madridismo that easy is coming 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:54.190

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.190
 Learning from you maribel sleeves mug 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.590
 although not a little bit far from living 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.540

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:04.950

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:25.850
 when they need those parts 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:30.360
 of marivent and then in the blender 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:34.560
 we have a condensed milk very well 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:43.130

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:43.130
 low of 293 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.880

00:02:54.330 --> 00:03:00.610
 please a teaspoon of extract of 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:02.980
 vanilla very well you give here I believe 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:05.730
 that you can see that it is frozen and a 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.730
 teaspoonful 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:12.330
 of corn starch 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.490
 and my singing changed hands I loved it 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:16.550

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:16.550
 all right 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:22.459
 that is all 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.459
 as Christians 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.800
 parking lot 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.670
 we look at all the ingredients 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:53.340
 are well mixed 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:56.250
 if not then a little group stays around 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:58.590
 of wanting to omit the starch all then 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:01.230
 since we have our mixture well 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:05.569
 What I tell you is like 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:05.569
 our base for two parents but good 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:15.830

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:15.830
