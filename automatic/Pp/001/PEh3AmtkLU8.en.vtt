00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:18.450
 let's see how to communicate the program 

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:22.850
 styps 7 the plc that is a foundation 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:24.680
 systematic is the 7 200 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:26.430
 the components that we are going to you 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:30.320
 plc 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:35.680
 Your pp communication cable 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:35.680
 a rs232 communication cable 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.190
 7 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.530
 then we are going to make a 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:47.559
 program in this 7 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:50.050
 to be able to communicate with the plc has 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:52.079
 created our work window and the 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:54.820
 left side we can have what it is 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.010
 our functions our operations 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:00.190
 which are like arithmetic of how fixed 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:02.769
 string comparisons and for example in 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.699
 logical operations converts in this 

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:07.540
 small program 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:10.869
 let's use a switch and a 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:14.619
 coil our inputs our 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:17.640
 Departures are made through the entrance 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:20.479
 and 0.20 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.479
 how are we going to do next 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:30.580
 paint 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:34.950
 and 0.0 so an entry is marked 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.950
 and the output is placed q 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.040
 0.0 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.840
 Once the program is done, we turn to 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.630
 communicate the psm to the computer 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:52.380
 using the pp cable and connect 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:55.350
 towards asia the plc and from here the 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:58.429
 pp input and connect the cable 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.429
 Resolution 32 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:05.700
 and already by this we comment it by the 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:09.500
 USB port to the computer 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.500
 and we went to do the configuration 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.069
 already on the computer we minimize our 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.459
 Program 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:21.030
 and we look for the connection we get to my 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:23.189
 pc complete right and properties we 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:26.209
 we go to the hardware administration of 

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:29.879
 devices and there we look for the cable 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:33.209
 rs232 we can see there in ports com 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:35.430
 and there he is in the harbor with three already 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:40.159
 searched and knowing where is it closed 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:40.159
 the little window and we return it to the program 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.010
 already in our program and previously 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:46.590
 on the plc we are going to 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:51.240
 communication later we go to the 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:53.670
 part of psc pp and address and already there 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.830
 we go on properties by selecting psc 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.660
 pp and we give to local connection 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:01.940
 we select the port com where 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.940
 we had the cable of the 32 previously 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.480
 after those double click to 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:10.550
 update him 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.550
 the plc and look for it and find it 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:25.850
 After this, the 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:28.130
 plc address let's accept 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:30.770
 once configured the connections we 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:34.960
 we are going to compile the program and load 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:34.960
 the cpu plc program 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:38.180
 we load 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.510
 and after loading and finalized 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:50.040
 to accept 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:52.709
 once the program is loaded we go to 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:57.170
 plc and in it is the switch we give 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:59.870
 the stop to rom 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:02.280
 we have a push button connected 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:06.109
 normally open connected 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.109
 directly towards an asia 

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:13.409
 do not 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:15.159
 we open the button and you should tell them 

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:17.500
 through the program previously 

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:20.670
 in charge 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.670
 as we can see below 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:27.520
 and we can see in the plc 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:33.310
 the entrance but it's hitting the exit 

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:36.310
 0 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:36.310
 i 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:43.920
 This completes the tutorial 

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:45.420
 work in plc we say 

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:47.310
 with this we do not go with our 

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:50.360
 connection was successful 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:54.140
 the program and only initial points 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:54.140
 it would be all things
