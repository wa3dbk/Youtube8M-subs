00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.699 

here's<00:00:00.450> the<00:00:00.630> little<00:00:00.870> tiny<00:00:01.079> urinary<00:00:01.620> bladder

00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:01.709 
here's the little tiny urinary bladder

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:03.500 
here's the little tiny urinary bladder
so<00:00:02.370> there's<00:00:02.550> the<00:00:02.669> bladder<00:00:02.879> with<00:00:03.120> some<00:00:03.270> fat

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510 
so there's the bladder with some fat

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.660 
so there's the bladder with some fat
surrounding<00:00:03.780> it<00:00:04.170> you<00:00:05.009> can<00:00:05.130> see<00:00:05.279> this<00:00:05.400> bladder

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670 
surrounding it you can see this bladder

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.210 
surrounding it you can see this bladder
is<00:00:05.940> roughly<00:00:06.480> I<00:00:06.509> mean<00:00:06.750> most<00:00:07.109> half<00:00:07.470> the<00:00:07.680> size<00:00:07.919> the

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
is roughly I mean most half the size the

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:09.709 
is roughly I mean most half the size the
bladder<00:00:08.400> we<00:00:08.610> saw<00:00:08.820> on<00:00:09.120> the<00:00:09.240> male<00:00:09.420> me

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
bladder we saw on the male me

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:11.390 
bladder we saw on the male me
remember<00:00:10.139> we<00:00:10.260> said<00:00:10.440> even<00:00:10.679> in<00:00:10.769> humans<00:00:11.160> you<00:00:11.280> know

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
remember we said even in humans you know

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.009 
remember we said even in humans you know
on<00:00:11.580> average<00:00:11.790> now<00:00:12.150> the<00:00:12.210> female<00:00:12.570> bladder<00:00:12.840> is

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
on average now the female bladder is

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:14.839 
on average now the female bladder is
roughly<00:00:13.320> one-third<00:00:13.950> smaller<00:00:14.370> than<00:00:14.610> the<00:00:14.670> male

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
roughly one-third smaller than the male

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:16.310 
roughly one-third smaller than the male
bladder<00:00:15.089> so<00:00:15.330> you<00:00:15.450> hold<00:00:15.660> you<00:00:15.839> know<00:00:15.960> less<00:00:16.139> you

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
bladder so you hold you know less you

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.470 
bladder so you hold you know less you
order<00:00:16.500> can<00:00:16.650> store<00:00:16.890> less<00:00:17.100> you<00:00:17.279> want<00:00:17.460> that's<00:00:18.240> the

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
order can store less you want that's the

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:19.640 
order can store less you want that's the
bladder<00:00:18.720> and<00:00:18.960> they're<00:00:19.050> going<00:00:19.170> to<00:00:19.289> see<00:00:19.439> these

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
bladder and they're going to see these

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.320 
bladder and they're going to see these
structures<00:00:20.189> right<00:00:20.400> here<00:00:20.609> see<00:00:20.880> this<00:00:21.000> brown

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
structures right here see this brown

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.859 
structures right here see this brown
thing<00:00:21.359> kind<00:00:22.109> of<00:00:22.199> shaped<00:00:22.380> like<00:00:22.439> a<00:00:22.529> big<00:00:22.710> why<00:00:23.010> here

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:23.869 
thing kind of shaped like a big why here

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:25.910 
thing kind of shaped like a big why here
that's<00:00:24.869> actually<00:00:25.109> the<00:00:25.350> minks<00:00:25.560> uterus

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
that's actually the minks uterus

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.019 
that's actually the minks uterus
everything<00:00:26.039> that<00:00:26.310> I'm<00:00:26.400> kind<00:00:26.550> of<00:00:26.580> stretching

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
everything that I'm kind of stretching

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.790 
everything that I'm kind of stretching
out<00:00:27.150> there<00:00:27.359> what<00:00:27.990> I'm<00:00:28.080> holding<00:00:28.349> here<00:00:28.650> at<00:00:28.740> the

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
out there what I'm holding here at the

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.769 
out there what I'm holding here at the
very<00:00:28.949> ends<00:00:29.189> are<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:29.400> ovaries<00:00:29.880> but<00:00:30.330> these<00:00:30.539> long

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
very ends are the ovaries but these long

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.389 
very ends are the ovaries but these long
tubes<00:00:31.109> you<00:00:31.320> might<00:00:31.500> think<00:00:31.710> fallopian<00:00:31.949> tubes

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
tubes you might think fallopian tubes

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.700 
tubes you might think fallopian tubes
that's<00:00:32.759> incorrect<00:00:33.329> those<00:00:33.630> are<00:00:33.840> the<00:00:34.020> horns<00:00:34.559> of

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
that's incorrect those are the horns of

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.139 
that's incorrect those are the horns of
the<00:00:34.739> uterus<00:00:34.829> we<00:00:35.250> were<00:00:35.340> talking<00:00:35.670> about<00:00:35.760> earlier

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
the uterus we were talking about earlier

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.690 
the uterus we were talking about earlier
so<00:00:36.420> you<00:00:37.020> have<00:00:37.170> a<00:00:37.200> left<00:00:37.649> horn<00:00:38.010> and<00:00:38.250> a<00:00:38.280> right<00:00:38.430> horn

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
so you have a left horn and a right horn

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:39.860 
so you have a left horn and a right horn
where<00:00:38.820> they<00:00:38.879> come<00:00:39.030> together<00:00:39.180> right<00:00:39.570> here<00:00:39.750> in

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
where they come together right here in

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.600 
where they come together right here in
the<00:00:39.930> middle<00:00:40.200> that's<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.920> body<00:00:41.250> of<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.520> uterus

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
the middle that's the body of the uterus

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.000 
the middle that's the body of the uterus
that's<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.570> part<00:00:42.780> that<00:00:42.809> resembles<00:00:43.350> what<00:00:43.410> your

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
that's the part that resembles what your

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.340 
that's the part that resembles what your
uterus<00:00:44.489> would<00:00:44.640> look<00:00:44.820> like<00:00:44.969> remember<00:00:45.960> we<00:00:46.079> said

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
uterus would look like remember we said

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.779 
uterus would look like remember we said
that<00:00:46.379> animals<00:00:46.950> like<00:00:47.160> means<00:00:47.430> that<00:00:47.640> have

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
that animals like means that have

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.029 
that animals like means that have
litters<00:00:48.329> of<00:00:48.480> offspring<00:00:48.870> they<00:00:49.680> have<00:00:49.890> these

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
litters of offspring they have these

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.979 
litters of offspring they have these
horns<00:00:50.430> and<00:00:50.700> little<00:00:51.030> minks<00:00:51.329> will<00:00:51.480> develop<00:00:51.809> all

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
horns and little minks will develop all

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.869 
horns and little minks will develop all
on<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.469> length<00:00:52.710> of<00:00:53.280> performance<00:00:53.730> of<00:00:53.820> the

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
on the length of performance of the

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.639 
on the length of performance of the
uterus<00:00:54.120> that's<00:00:54.270> how<00:00:54.420> they<00:00:54.539> can<00:00:54.690> have<00:00:54.960> multiple

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
uterus that's how they can have multiple

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.250 
uterus that's how they can have multiple
offspring<00:00:56.430> several<00:00:56.910> at<00:00:57.000> one<00:00:57.180> time<00:00:57.449> so<00:00:58.199> two

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
offspring several at one time so two

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.709 
offspring several at one time so two
horns<00:00:59.039> of<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.219> uterus<00:00:59.280> the<00:01:00.059> unite<00:01:00.420> right

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
horns of the uterus the unite right

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.260 
horns of the uterus the unite right
there<00:01:00.960> at<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.410> body<00:01:01.680> of<00:01:01.920> uterus<00:01:02.309> then<00:01:03.120> right

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
there at the body of uterus then right

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.880 
there at the body of uterus then right
here<00:01:03.390> at<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.570> very<00:01:03.690> end<00:01:03.899> you<00:01:04.199> see<00:01:04.379> this<00:01:04.500> little

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
here at the very end you see this little

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.230 
here at the very end you see this little
tiny<00:01:05.189> structure<00:01:05.760> you<00:01:05.850> can<00:01:05.939> kind<00:01:06.060> of<00:01:06.090> see

at the very very end one of those horns
the<00:01:19.020> fallopian<00:01:19.320> tubes<00:01:19.740> actually<00:01:19.920> are<00:01:20.310> very

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
the fallopian tubes actually are very

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.310 
the fallopian tubes actually are very
short<00:01:20.939> kind<00:01:21.150> of<00:01:21.210> Wiggly<00:01:21.570> tubes<00:01:21.810> you<00:01:21.960> can<00:01:22.020> see

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
short kind of Wiggly tubes you can see

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.560 
short kind of Wiggly tubes you can see
right<00:01:22.530> on<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:23.009> ovary<00:01:23.310> they're<00:01:23.790> so<00:01:24.090> tiny<00:01:24.390> you

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
right on the ovary they're so tiny you

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:25.730 
right on the ovary they're so tiny you
can't<00:01:24.840> put<00:01:24.960> them<00:01:25.020> on<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.200> practical<00:01:25.560> that's

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
can't put them on the practical that's

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:26.810 
can't put them on the practical that's
why<00:01:25.830> I<00:01:25.890> don't<00:01:26.070> have<00:01:26.220> them<00:01:26.369> on<00:01:26.490> your<00:01:26.640> list

that structure right at the very end of
the<00:01:30.780> floor<00:01:31.049> would<00:01:31.320> be<00:01:31.350> an<00:01:31.619> ovary<00:01:32.040> it's<00:01:32.159> a

here as well very very tiny vessels so

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.620 
here as well very very tiny vessels so
we<00:01:55.259> have<00:01:55.380> two<00:01:55.680> horns<00:01:56.280> to<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:56.579> uterus<00:01:56.880> one<00:01:57.329> horn

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
we have two horns to the uterus one horn

we have two horns to the uterus one horn
here<00:01:57.869> another<00:01:58.020> horn<00:01:58.350> they<00:01:59.040> met<00:01:59.310> right<00:01:59.340> here<00:01:59.610> at

here another horn they met right here at
the<00:02:00.270> body<00:02:00.509> a<00:02:00.780> little<00:02:01.439> bit<00:02:01.560> further<00:02:01.979> down

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909 
the body a little bit further down

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:05.789 
the body a little bit further down
kind<00:02:04.840> of<00:02:04.899> tough<00:02:05.049> to<00:02:05.229> see<00:02:05.439> but<00:02:05.469> there's<00:02:05.740> a

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:05.799 
kind of tough to see but there's a

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:07.620 
kind of tough to see but there's a
little<00:02:05.920> indentation<00:02:06.490> you<00:02:06.850> see<00:02:07.030> right<00:02:07.240> there

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
little indentation you see right there

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.660 
little indentation you see right there
that's<00:02:08.229> the<00:02:08.500> end<00:02:08.770> of<00:02:08.860> the<00:02:08.950> uterus<00:02:09.280> that's<00:02:09.459> kind

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
that's the end of the uterus that's kind

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:10.919 
that's the end of the uterus that's kind
of<00:02:09.700> like<00:02:09.819> where<00:02:10.000> the<00:02:10.119> cervix<00:02:10.509> would<00:02:10.660> be<00:02:10.780> from

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
of like where the cervix would be from

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:13.680 
of like where the cervix would be from
this<00:02:11.020> point<00:02:11.349> downward<00:02:12.180> that's<00:02:13.180> a<00:02:13.390> view<00:02:13.540> the

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
this point downward that's a view the

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.320 
this point downward that's a view the
outer<00:02:13.900> wall<00:02:14.319> of<00:02:14.590> the<00:02:14.680> means<00:02:14.950> vagina<00:02:15.209> so<00:02:16.209> the

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
outer wall of the means vagina so the

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.000 
outer wall of the means vagina so the
body<00:02:16.510> of<00:02:16.660> uterus<00:02:16.989> ends<00:02:17.380> again<00:02:17.620> we<00:02:17.769> could<00:02:17.890> say

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
body of uterus ends again we could say

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:19.920 
body of uterus ends again we could say
kind<00:02:18.130> of<00:02:18.220> right<00:02:18.940> here<00:02:18.970> the<00:02:19.300> cervix<00:02:19.630> is<00:02:19.720> on<00:02:19.840> the

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
kind of right here the cervix is on the

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.150 
kind of right here the cervix is on the
bottom<00:02:20.260> everything<00:02:20.530> below<00:02:20.739> that<00:02:20.950> little

bottom everything below that little

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.160 
bottom everything below that little
indentation<00:02:21.730> would<00:02:22.239> be<00:02:22.390> vagina<00:02:22.750> looking<00:02:23.080> at

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
indentation would be vagina looking at

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.949 
indentation would be vagina looking at
it<00:02:23.260> from<00:02:23.349> an<00:02:23.500> internal<00:02:23.950> aspect<00:02:24.660> so<00:02:25.660> those
