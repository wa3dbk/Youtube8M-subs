up here it's got a start button that's a

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.780 
up here it's got a start button that's a
pretty<00:02:46.799> light<00:02:47.190> sort<00:02:47.580> of<00:02:47.640> gun

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
it's made of hard plastic so it's really

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.070 
it's made of hard plastic so it's really
solid<00:02:53.000> it's<00:02:54.000> not<00:02:54.060> really<00:02:54.360> heavy<00:02:54.599> at<00:02:54.750> all<00:02:54.840> but

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
not too light and not too heavy so it's

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:02.330 
not too light and not too heavy so it's
you<00:02:59.940> know<00:03:00.060> it's<00:03:00.090> fair<00:03:00.480> for<00:03:00.739> its<00:03:01.739> time<00:03:01.920> anyway

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:31.320 
that's just mainly due to the different

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:34.010 
that's just mainly due to the different
systems<00:05:31.500> and<00:05:31.920> everything<00:05:32.250> like<00:05:32.340> that<00:05:33.020> now

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:34.020 
systems and everything like that now
