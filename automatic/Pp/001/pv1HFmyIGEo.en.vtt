of memory in the computer the CPU speed
we<00:00:30.539> actually<00:00:30.810> have<00:00:30.900> several<00:00:31.080> of<00:00:31.230> these<00:00:31.349> on

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
we actually have several of these on

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.630 
we actually have several of these on
option<00:00:32.009> 2<00:00:32.369> gigahertz<00:00:32.669> and<00:00:33.030> up<00:00:33.829> so<00:00:34.829> refer<00:00:35.489> the

individual option to see what speed it

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.830 
individual option to see what speed it
is<00:00:37.410> you<00:00:37.590> want<00:00:37.770> to<00:00:37.829> bid<00:00:38.040> on<00:00:38.390> as<00:00:39.390> you<00:00:39.510> can<00:00:39.660> see

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
is you want to bid on as you can see

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.270 
is you want to bid on as you can see
it's<00:00:39.989> already<00:00:40.140> starting<00:00:40.649> to<00:00:40.680> boot<00:00:40.860> up<00:00:41.010> into

it's already starting to boot up into

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.850 
it's already starting to boot up into
Windows<00:00:41.550> XP<00:00:42.030> Professional<00:00:42.649> that's<00:00:43.649> another

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
Windows XP Professional that's another

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.360 
Windows XP Professional that's another
plus<00:00:44.190> for<00:00:44.250> this<00:00:44.610> system<00:00:45.000> and<00:00:45.660> we<00:00:46.320> also<00:00:46.500> have

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
plus for this system and we also have

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.819 
plus for this system and we also have
installed<00:00:47.789> service<00:00:48.420> pack<00:00:48.629> 3<00:00:48.930> so<00:00:49.350> it's<00:00:49.590> ready

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
installed service pack 3 so it's ready

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.130 
installed service pack 3 so it's ready
to<00:00:49.950> go<00:00:50.010> nothing<00:00:50.700> to<00:00:50.789> add<00:00:50.969> no<00:00:51.360> drivers<00:00:51.809> to<00:00:51.989> look

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
to go nothing to add no drivers to look

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.840 
to go nothing to add no drivers to look
for<00:00:52.379> anything<00:00:52.620> like<00:00:52.829> that

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:55.850 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.090 

it<00:00:56.269> takes<00:00:56.960> about<00:00:57.079> 40<00:00:57.440> seconds<00:00:57.769> to<00:00:57.859> boot<00:00:57.980> up

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100 
it takes about 40 seconds to boot up

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.340 
it takes about 40 seconds to boot up
it's<00:00:58.460> already<00:00:58.730> there<00:00:58.879> so<00:00:59.570> let's<00:00:59.989> take<00:01:00.140> a<00:01:00.170> look

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 
it's already there so let's take a look

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:01.930 
it's already there so let's take a look
at<00:01:00.440> some<00:01:00.589> of<00:01:00.649> the<00:01:00.739> software<00:01:01.219> that<00:01:01.399> we<00:01:01.640> have

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:01.940 
at some of the software that we have

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.200

first<00:01:02.539> of<00:01:02.629> all<00:01:02.750> it<00:01:03.050> is<00:01:03.199> a<00:01:03.230> CD<00:01:03.680> writer<00:01:04.009> and<00:01:04.400> so<00:01:05.059> it

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
first of all it is a CD writer and so it

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.810
