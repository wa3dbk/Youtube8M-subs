00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:06.810
 now we are stupid 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.480
 by nature because the normal attitude in front of study of us is that 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:17.369
 they want to hide it feeling like a bit ashamed listen to the voice of the police 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.830
 interior of the interior judge who criticizes him 1 and 2 with the declan workshop 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:24.409
 therapeutic we try 

00:00:24.409 --> 00:00:26.300
 give a place to his stupidity 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.009
 ok otherwise that part child with lines of each 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:33.060
 the game of the nose in a workshop claure expose 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:37.100
 it's the smallest mask in the world so that's when I get side 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.680
 the nose is more expensive one way this one is vetoing to understand that I'm 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.980
 entering a different code 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.660
 that the thing is not serious what kind of network and that you can not look 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.150
 then in the nose little xirgu to show why this is 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.150
 I'm not that important 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.420
 fire 3 important to learn to develop attention 

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:07.890
 it is important to work in a team 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.659
 also the game can make people stronger because there are people who 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:11.870
 it's a bit soft 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:15.050
 then he's doing well a little bit of force issues so he took a picture of 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:17.150
 exposure to appliances issue of character 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.150
 Although the game can also awaken you 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.880
 in a therapeutic claun workshop as I focus it there is a part of the process 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.880
 That has to do with 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.230
 live peace ap therefore the king would be the same 

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:50.180
 If you go out to the street showing your criticism, I get smiles because 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.560
 of god and doing liposuction are we going doing I mean with that 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.020
 do not have to start that sense what the pain is feeling 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.810
 also one can feel pain that I felt sadness 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.140
 there is also a poetry 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.070
 spot on the actor 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.810
 in that neighborhood walls 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.180
 the street work is very interesting because it can get to say 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:11.759
 and do things that 

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:12.770
 otherwise 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.139
 they would not be so 

00:02:15.139 --> 00:02:19.329
 acceptable you start feeling the ridiculous suddenly you realize 

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:22.329
 that what was ridiculous become pleasure 

00:02:26.429 --> 00:02:28.369
 I was wrong 

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:31.459
 the therapeutic effect for me and above all is 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:33.039
 laugh at yourself 

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:37.709
 greater self-esteem based on greater spontaneity and feeling in your body to 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:38.559
 taste 

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:40.449
 of having taken a series of steps 

00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:42.219
 to see you dare to do something 

00:02:42.219 --> 00:02:43.329
 what did it cost you? 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:45.620
 it helps you to have more friendship with yourself
