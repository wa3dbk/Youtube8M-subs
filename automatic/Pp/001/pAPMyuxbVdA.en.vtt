00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.030
 hello dear viewers and welcome to one 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:04.650
 new episode of large columbia and 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.330
 I'm a bit late with the people with 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.620
 appointment not fulfilled but I can 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.960
 actually do nothing about it because I had one 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.099
 all day Amsterdam was a little tiring 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.540
 that I actually had first instance 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.590
 so thought then really no 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.330
 attacked may experience 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.070
 on thursday we got them to cook that 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.869
 also takes a long noise for money 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.090
 it also ge and fear of money attempt that 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.710
 can take so long so 3 along the 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.000
 bottom out I get I've won so 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.529
 that is of course about 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.180
 but if you kiss me check the 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.710
 description vive coach come point nl en 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.869
 if the code prevail brought with all 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.009
 lower case turkey 5% discount 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.390
 also its the price if can previous 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.040
 video said also went down again 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.329
 so if you ate look up then cage is sun 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.860
 probably the best moment now 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.899
 now they are a lot cheaper than 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.340
 first were the gameplay 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.110
 that's why he starts the match pretty well 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.789
 and one or follow must come but luckily 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.260
 come back on equal hear because you 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.910
 here my people see my games running 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.200
 and then eventually martinez and 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.969
 I will of course buy it 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.350
 level the score 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.670
 eventually i will also hornet hef 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.160
 take it in your hands because you see that that 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.539
 palmer and is and I want bodycote too 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.190
 lots of grain on david i so much pace 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.539
 and the scene the shoe is fine 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.550
 from both keepers that I finally got it 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.930
 the score that score on two input 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.729
 so was pretty good after that 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.590
 goes it all photo rijnmond and pass 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.030
 more jurisdiction I also have one about 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.560
 game of martinus and finally comes 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.119
 there is a little something by you though 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.960
 can say i was lucky to get that 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.400
 three one score 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.439
 in the end he had enough 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.909
 contact 5 and to golf in 5 minutes 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.439
 He doesn't gimp so much later 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.909
 it really is difficult for me 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.500
 way of not very much later then and 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.000
 geeske that and so I know this competition 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.430
 with three one he sat I want a whole 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.780
 excellent climatic will arose cunt sucking and 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.310
 I can visit and second game 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.750
 of course there is both of these then 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.640
 our team actually remember quite well 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.530
 a great red team they hardly have a lot 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.900
 be bought and I am going to think so 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.310
 for all players of consecutive but 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.540
 of course the first one was lace 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.000
 leads me to comfort even look at it 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.439
 the team plain are very well intact really 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.299
 I didn't know what was going on 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.280
 team or to see and I found him on and 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.689
 which three they are signed with each 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.640
 such sick teams I really couldn't 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.869
 believe but will see the good 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.430
 team doesn't have to mean you 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.140
 once you get used to play as 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.310
 actually something very good and that ensured 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.079
 sure i was pretty good at the game 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.310
 on a lead can but not why 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.750
 and change to all I can 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.000
 probably all players still 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.350
 and the first my list of pitfalls 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.790
 I then first he is quite slow 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.310
 is not as good as everyone else would 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.110
 certainly for a 90 general player I have 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.209
 A few reviews to look at too 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.050
 titanium so from all other playful ones 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:14.640
 comes out well 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.050
 live here already said that the games really 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.450
 actually very good that it is 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.370
 really a 90 knows the top is it like 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.870
 at such a will i will best order from the 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.220
 glass stands out with such a good player 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.960
 so I'm very curious about the 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.400
 use temporary so it is 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:27.990
 finnebasses prime with ibarbo 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.790
 and another space martinez for that 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:31.680
 really score a production line here you see 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.600
 she also added a golfer martinus to this 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.190
 keeper couldn't do anything about it and me 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.420
 can also be used continuously 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.460
 every football actually went short 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.750
 through my pairing is possible 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.220
 me was the match could 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.440
 tip top so your channel i could say that 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.150
 I have quite a lot of aids with me but so 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.500
 also that these tips are not really whole 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.580
 very good play that also explains 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.590
 probably that in such a low 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.330
 division because there was not much heaven 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.340
 good player and thanks for it really is already 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.540
 by which is the 1st half was for it 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.680
 me again 6 one 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.750
 and then start the second half of cloths 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.970
 kees article at martinez and that kind 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.220
 is volte 7 was a well-founded already broken 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.570
 And I could or if guarantee that the many 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.300
 could fall and so probably 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:07.680
 iphone see how sick he can each be 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.430
 have not finished but I find it there 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.750
 smarter fun 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.160
 not to make anyone but I think 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.960
 I especially like that 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.490
 youth teams I come how many single team 

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:16.050
 exactly a team and that i also good 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:17.760
 against in his pump against is sick 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:20.670
 teams at the ibrahimovic for example 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.989
 so it or without many other abnormal 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.100
 teams come and we have to 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:24.750
 beat groups better with us 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.820
 maybe someone from Colombia 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.770
 excluding our computer scientist of course 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.610
 maybe 15 them so maybe even 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:31.470
 even less 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:33.060
 reval i feel the summer sky nice fine 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.230
 he looks back on just talking because 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.820
 and look at a good stock 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.470
 But I'll tell you those two goals 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:39.239
 name the only two shots where he 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:41.310
 on target released so it wasn't real 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:42.900
 that it peels a lot because how it 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.310
 party does well where both goals 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.810
 so yes it's about clarity the two 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:47.489
 counter goals ultimately home boot 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.810
 none with 11 2 or bessel a great one 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:49.470
 I actually have to say monster scores 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.360
 because 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.590
 it should never be able to make it that bad 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.910
 with such a sick team 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.380
 not only you do not hear me complain because 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:57.060
 we want to throw with 11 second like 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.290
 natural with extra coins and on it 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:59.400
 sign that in again a new victory 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.660
 the bag is 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.040
 and so we can now just take one last 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.380
 competition over and in the latter 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.090
 competition can handle me more 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:08.310
 dessel good team coming against tiels 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:10.140
 a gignac of heroes per couple large 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.950
 players to just about dionysus erica team 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:12.239
 as well 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:13.830
 but then he was not a very 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:15.870
 good player and gignac is direct and 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:17.519
 press spire of all that to hiss and 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.019
 the next 15 minutes will be on an angel 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:20.580
 ahead of that was a good one and not 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:22.410
 we leave this home score extensively 

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:24.060
 but that ball comes the 1 on 1 and y night 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:25.889
 and full a total or but eventually had 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.240
 still play to pick him up 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:28.919
 which thus follow back on the ball 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.360
 you don't miss a thick order for all of it 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:32.610
 two zero so she was pretty good 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.960
 prima go telecom the score on two to 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:35.219
 but there was stayed there 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.629
 of course not with he got you 

00:04:35.219 --> 00:04:38.939
 meanwhile, house a chance with sally 

00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:40.259
 chat and chat can shoot hard so that 

00:04:38.939 --> 00:04:42.150
 also show here and in schiedam whole 

00:04:40.259 --> 00:04:44.310
 nice and besseler vicious shot on the 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.360
 ground the two one in it easy i may 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:46.830
 it is very much mine because I 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.180
 the one went on the avellana here you see 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.770
 so that it pays to be a teenager 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:51.539
 shoot here and I am lucky with it 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:53.639
 what dokkum in the second instance as 

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:55.349
 yet no shooting and they like good 

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:56.909
 until late, otherwise one will arrive 

00:04:55.349 --> 00:04:58.439
 the city we will now see us through 

00:04:56.909 --> 00:04:59.699
 a one-way ticket that is also for 

00:04:58.439 --> 00:05:01.139
 my side because here you see martinus 

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:03.060
 run and he may just like that 

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:04.289
 Feyenoord was off busy time again 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:06.029
 with the four a win what is 

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:07.680
 means that we are doing quite well 

00:05:06.029 --> 00:05:09.419
 in this vision so far and therefore have 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.009
 also quite long series of victories 

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:11.550
 but it is fun from the art of living 

00:05:11.009 --> 00:05:12.960
 found 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:14.340
 don't find it to like it took 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:15.659
 huge if not how when we got it 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:17.490
 sure what i make one every day 

00:05:15.659 --> 00:05:18.779
 video please this week because i am now 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:20.219
 busy with finland 

00:05:18.779 --> 00:05:21.479
 and of course i can take that caption too 

00:05:20.219 --> 00:05:22.770
 Protect are on until once 

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:25.039
 and so deny it centrally 

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:25.039
 audio
