00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:05.609
 skin care routine 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.290
 and let sunny xiv was whole again 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:09.090
 very much requested despite him 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.500
 not really much has changed much with 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.570
 the last parking that in 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.769
 have done skin care routine and 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.849
 so i hope you may still 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.070
 can appreciate 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.410
 very often the question do you want to hear me how 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.760
 does your skin still so beautiful but what 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.560
 you see a camera that is natural 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.539
 not what my skin really looks like 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.830
 camera is often very sweet to us 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.300
 the equalizes then a nice one 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.439
 foundation concealer also became one 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.539
 many 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.719
 but below you can see my skin shop 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.800
 really looks like without makeup and 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.430
 then you see that it is still pretty good 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.840
 a lot of 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.140
 redness still have quite a bit 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.670
 pimples still occasionally and some spots 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:44.700
 for all my chin epic you 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.890
 pimples spots and redness on my 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.480
 cheek it is really a lot 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.000
 less belt a few years ago then 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.760
 I still have other skincare routine 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.870
 and his team is much better 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.530
 but my skin has never been 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.690
 totally acne be a writer 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.489
 my skin is completely sensitive so that 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.010
 means that I respond to a sensitivity 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.900
 quick on touches 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.799
 temperature fluctuations products yet 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.180
 kind of stuff 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.369
 this must be very careful what i am 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.979
 use and I use therefore almost 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.090
 the same products for two years 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.090
 all very middle ones contain none 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.030
 clock perfume no irritating alcohols 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.170
 there is no other in leather and the 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.970
 Ingredients I use Jetske Ultee 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.689
 always taste products like me 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.100
 to do 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.900
 so I am very much a fan of the theory 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.430
 from jetske ultee i will post her blog here 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.140
 link in the article below 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.159
 you know what it means through 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.240
 all of them 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.520
 I think many of you will 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.930
 know what that means and what the beginning 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.340
 what it's about but for when you get it 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.850
 don't know yet you could do that 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.850
 read 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.520
 we switch to morning in the evening 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.590
 I'll just show you 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.479
 did not look in between what is in between 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.939
 to show because I stand up 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.840
 and then I wash my face with tepid 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.850
 water 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.049
 the buyer cleanser for the normal tot 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.979
 fat skin 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:00.450
 this is a cleanser that is super mild and 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:02.100
 he just does his job i use one 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.719
 pump I do with such a bottle 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.819
 half a year that is really very long 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:07.350
 for 25 euros I think it is 

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:09.239
 not very expensive at all because you do 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.860
 it lasted quite a long time 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.900
 i wash my face i this my face 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.780
 dry and then I use 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.910
 cream and I have two I use the 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.890
 olaz total effect seven in a perfume 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.860
 Friday and I have the clinic 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.239
 super defense with spf 20 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.400
 and lately my skin is free 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:29.130
 so dry then first a layer of oh 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.380
 lasso and then I apply a layer of 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.790
 clinique the superdefense if you have one 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.709
 exfoliant use then it is very bad 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.410
 important that you use player there and 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:39.720
 that's why I use it when I do 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.000
 only the olas sieves in a marvel 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.560
 use knitting night cream then I use 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.660
 also a separate one 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.610
 sunscreen and that brand differs 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:52.079
 very often it is more the mold for the 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:53.459
 sensitive skin to cover the scene 

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:56.010
 without handbrake from jetske ultee itself 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:57.989
 I prefer to use the clinic 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.780
 superb defense and Allah's 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:01.859
 seven in a day cream together so first 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.010
 this and then this 

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:06.750
 that's what i'm currently using 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.420
 continue to the evening in which I go 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:12.269
 showing you what I do now is me 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.769
 remove my makeup with the mac 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:16.019
 plans or judge this used product 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:17.790
 I really use it for years 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:20.250
 I massaged in on dry skin like 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:23.040
 you can see and 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.780
 but very good at all places 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.900
 run over my eyes with my 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:30.180
 finger so that we properly loosen the damage 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.470
 and then I go with a little lukewarm 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.910
 water 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:35.010
 yes foam up because I am not ashamed 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:37.079
 really on mark being a kind of milk 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.480
 and then I will massage it in again and 

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:41.700
 then I rinse it well then 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.889
 my face beautiful clean lack there still 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:46.380
 a pump in the same cleanser again 

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:48.769
 namely from the anne cover limits of 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.769
 jetske ultee 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.579
 and then its done anyway 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.379
 face washed along my face 

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:54.760
 completely clean 

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:56.620
 very occasionally get hit with one 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.090
 cotton pad over it to get some 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:01.900

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:04.030

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:15.129

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:16.959

00:04:15.129 --> 00:04:18.759
