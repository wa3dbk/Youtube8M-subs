00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.720
 hello to all your greetings to all 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:21.370
 gabriel forfender android 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.210
 found for an unpacking of samsung 

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:24.670
 galaxy note 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:27.190
 edge is the smartphone that is actually 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:29.200
 the fake twins of another 4 you go 

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:30.280
 see he has a peculiarity it's his 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:32.289
 curved screen 

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:34.089
 but before coming back to that, we're going 

00:00:32.289 --> 00:00:35.999
 immediately start unpacking 

00:00:34.089 --> 00:00:38.019
 so we're on a cardboard box 

00:00:35.999 --> 00:00:39.309
 recyclable is the box we are 

00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:40.929
 used to seeing since now 

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:44.859
 some time on smartphones and 

00:00:40.929 --> 00:00:46.809
 the tablets of the galaxy range so at 

00:00:44.859 --> 00:00:47.829
 the stop we have the logo with all the 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:49.300
 technical characteristics of 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:52.569
 the device you are going to see it there is 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:54.339
 really very upscale and we're not going 

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:57.489
 soon we will open immediately the 

00:00:54.339 --> 00:01:00.789
 box we obviously find the 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:02.559
 phone with again the 

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:05.710
 main features so we're going 

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:09.250
 remove this screen protector as you 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:11.259
 can see it it takes over the design or 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.780
 almost from another cats with the 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:15.820
 main difference which is this screen 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.479
 curve so we'll go back over 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:21.840
 a little bit later I will finish 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:25.630
 I network the box 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.280
 the quick start guide so 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:31.240
 always present and I imagine that you 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:34.829
 said it did not was of course 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:41.829
 the battery of 3000 millan father hours 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:43.929
 all in length one to the micro usb jack 

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:46.780
 usb 2.0 for the computer connected 

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:48.759
 but also recharge it for the 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.259
 reload you will need the plug 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:51.759
 sector 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:54.789
 then on the mains plug was specified 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:55.630
 that he has charting glamor so all and 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:57.609
 all technology that helps 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.690
 recharge much faster his 

00:01:57.609 --> 00:02:01.600
 phone 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:03.480
 namely about 40% in the space of 30 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:07.330
 minutes 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:10.330
 there is also intra headphones 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:12.880
 ear headphones you see 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:15.130
 intra with so the ski kit 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.850
 hands-free a little button mic 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:21.520
 to increase and decrease the volume 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:26.320
 here the tips to adapt to 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:30.760
 different sizes of ears and finally 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:32.440
 a hook with dice small dot 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.500
 interchangeable which are actually the 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:37.330
 interchangeable tips of the pen or 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.340
 stylet and spain that is present on his 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.950
 note el haj as is the case on the 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.760
 ours 4 so here is force of wear if 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:45.730
 you have a problem you can 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:48.150
 change his spikes using this little 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:52.500
 hook and therefore spare parts 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.500
 so that's the box 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.580
 will now be looked after all of 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:03:00.940
 a little bit the design of the phone so 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:04.500
 we are on a screen always great 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:08.020
 amoled with a full hd definition of 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:10.060
 2560 by mika 240 pixels for that 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:12.690
 this one is 5.6 inches ie 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:14.590
 0.1 inches less than ours cat 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.690
 frankly it's not seen on the other hand 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:19.150
 we won a little bit in width 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:22.300
 is 4 mm wider than the 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:27.250
 ours 4 is due to this screen 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:28.989
 curved here we also about the logo 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.400
 samsung speakers the sensor of 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:32.830
 brightness and proximity 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.570
 the front camera that makes 3,7 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:37.060
 megapixels and that takes very good of 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:39.310
 the girl below the home button 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.989
 who also has a fingerprint reader 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:43.170
 digital so as is the case on the 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:46.180
 s5 or ours cat 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.140
 here the multitasking key here the tuft 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.120
 back so these are touch keys 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:52.720
 there it does not show because I have not 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.040
 still turned on the smartphone on the 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.550
 slice then you see on the slice 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.670
 right 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:04:00.820
 so we have this curved screen a frame in 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:01.600
 aluminum then on ours because I know 

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:04.660
 not if you remember 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:06.519
 here we had the start button 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:09.300
 now the start button has been 

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:10.650
 deported above that's for 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:12.120
 just to make way for that 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:14.190
 short screen so we have the button 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.470
 boot on top what is not 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.580
 necessarily finally more convenient after 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.320
 it's according to taste but it's not 

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:21.330
 necessarily more convenient for 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:26.250
 turn it on or off 

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:28.110
 we also have 3.5mm headphone jack 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:30.930
 the infrared bridge here is a microphone for 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:32.550
 noise reduction especially in 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:34.080
 below so we still find the two 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:36.990
 to the microphones so we have in all three 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.380
 microphones that serve my quality of 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.650
 call 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:43.290
 we also have micro USB 2.0 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:45.720
 here is the location for the style and 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:47.360
 espen who of course is always of the 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:50.640
 part 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:51.350
 finally left the control button the 

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:53.130
 volume 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:55.320
 in terms of getting started 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:57.210
 so there present in good after 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:59.190
 must admit that it's big enough we have 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:03.030
 trouble here with the push to go 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:04.170
 look at the top left 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:06.180
 that was already the case and that our four 

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:09.630
 it's still a little bit accentuated 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:13.080
 with the width so that is more 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:15.480
 important here the back and always this 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:18.120
 faux leather effect that is really not bad 

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:19.440
 who really wants very miom there we have the 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:23.310
 black version but it's our help 

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:26.880
 also exists in white just here the 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:28.440
 16 megapixel sony photo sensor that 

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:30.300
 takes very good shots just in 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:32.700
 below the led flash and the 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:35.010
 heart rate monitor so the player's 

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:37.980
 heart rate or you're going to have to 

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:41.280
 ask your finger to calculate 

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:43.230
 all this here the samsung logo the unique 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:45.360
 speakers at the back then we 

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:47.940
 were we going to say one of the faults of a 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:49.440
 other 4 the sound is not necessarily 

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:50.370
 excellent is not bad either 

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:51.810
 but it's true that on the guy 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:53.130
 now we are used to finding 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:54.990
 front speakers that we see 

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:56.280
 really good sound so I you 

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:59.460
 advise going through the headphone jack 

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:01.320
 3.5 mm if you ever want to enjoy at 

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:03.960
 better of the sound experience of this no 

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:07.770
 age as I said already on ours 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:08.870
 You have to know that the back is a 

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:11.640
 mobile 

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:14.730
 so I withdraw that we will enjoy it for 

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:16.110
 insert the battery directly so the 

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:19.400
 battery I remember 3000 

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:21.060
 millan scared go here all in length 

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:24.510
 you see it we also have a 

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:26.610
 location for the micro sim is here a 

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:28.200
 location for a micro SD card so 

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:30.390
 to expand the storage memory 

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:31.560
 storage memory says noted hadji's 

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:34.260
 32 gigabytes 

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:36.810
 but we can add a sd card 

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:39.720
 up to 128 gigabytes so largely from 

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:40.110
 what to store a lot of movies and 

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:42.870
 music 

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:45.210
 that was the unpacking and a 

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:47.160
 first grip of the galaxy note 

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:49.020
 edge and we find ourselves right away 

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:50.910
 after in another video for the test 

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:53.390
 including the interface and 

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:55.260
 peculiarities of this curved screen 

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:56.880
 thank you all for watching this video 

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:58.680
 I hope you enjoyed it and do not hesitate 

00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:00.930
 not to subscribe to youtube channel 2 

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:01.950
 x from android to see more and we get 

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:04.550
 find again very quickly 

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:04.550
 Hi everybody
