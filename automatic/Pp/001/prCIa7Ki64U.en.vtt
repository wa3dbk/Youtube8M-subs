probably<00:01:07.470> happen<00:01:08.750> closer<00:01:09.750> to<00:01:10.229> now<00:01:10.530> then

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
probably happen closer to now then

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.450 
probably happen closer to now then
closer<00:01:11.850> to<00:01:12.299> say<00:01:13.110> a<00:01:13.140> year<00:01:13.590> or<00:01:13.770> two<00:01:14.010> in<00:01:14.250> the

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
closer to say a year or two in the

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:23.120 
closer to say a year or two in the
future<00:01:16.939> injured<00:01:17.939> means<00:01:18.619> hurt<00:01:20.299> so<00:01:21.299> if<00:01:21.750> I<00:01:22.650> got

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
future injured means hurt so if I got

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.130 
future injured means hurt so if I got
injured<00:01:23.790> it<00:01:24.030> means<00:01:24.299> I<00:01:24.570> got<00:01:24.810> hurt<00:01:26.780> so<00:01:27.780> we'll<00:01:27.990> do

ground floor we need to get in on the

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:17.920 
ground floor we need to get in on the
ground<00:02:16.920> floor

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
ground floor

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.740 
ground floor
this<00:02:18.930> saying<00:02:19.769> means<00:02:20.190> we<00:02:21.030> need<00:02:21.209> to<00:02:21.269> be<00:02:21.600> the

this saying means we need to be the

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:29.720 
this saying means we need to be the
first<00:02:22.019> to<00:02:22.350> do<00:02:22.530> this<00:02:24.799> so<00:02:27.500> the<00:02:28.500> the<00:02:28.860> origin<00:02:29.580> of

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
first to do this so the the origin of

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.660 
first to do this so the the origin of
this<00:02:30.150> getting<00:02:30.569> on<00:02:30.810> the<00:02:30.900> ground<00:02:31.049> floor<00:02:31.670> this

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
this getting on the ground floor this

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.090 
this getting on the ground floor this
came<00:02:33.030> from<00:02:33.239> when<00:02:33.810> you're<00:02:33.989> building<00:02:34.230> a<00:02:34.590> house

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
came from when you're building a house

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.620 
came from when you're building a house
so<00:02:35.250> when<00:02:35.660> building<00:02:36.660> a<00:02:36.780> house<00:02:37.140> first<00:02:38.330> put<00:02:39.330> the

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
so when building a house first put the

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:46.759 
so when building a house first put the
ground<00:02:40.370> floor<00:02:42.200> then<00:02:43.200> put<00:02:43.950> the<00:02:44.549> walls<00:02:45.470> then<00:02:46.470> the

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
ground floor then put the walls then the

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:49.039 
ground floor then put the walls then the
roof<00:02:47.040> right<00:02:47.519> so<00:02:48.180> first<00:02:48.420> you<00:02:48.540> put<00:02:48.690> the<00:02:48.810> ground

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.049 
roof right so first you put the ground

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:52.340 
roof right so first you put the ground
floor<00:02:49.440> the<00:02:50.100> walls<00:02:50.430> and<00:02:50.760> then<00:02:50.910> the<00:02:51.030> roof<00:02:51.350> so

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
floor the walls and then the roof so

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.819 
floor the walls and then the roof so
that's<00:02:52.650> how<00:02:52.920> we<00:02:52.980> get<00:02:53.370> this<00:02:53.579> statement<00:02:54.060> but<00:02:54.829> for

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:55.829 
that's how we get this statement but for

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:58.849 
that's how we get this statement but for
this<00:02:55.950> example<00:02:56.130> we'll<00:02:56.489> say<00:02:56.790> rusty<00:02:57.269> says<00:02:57.859> our

00:02:58.849 --> 00:02:58.859 
this example we'll say rusty says our

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:03.140 
this example we'll say rusty says our
company<00:03:00.530> needs<00:03:01.530> more<00:03:02.370> sales

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
company needs more sales

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:10.910 
company needs more sales
so<00:03:04.079> I<00:03:04.109> say<00:03:04.560> wow<00:03:07.489> we<00:03:08.489> need<00:03:08.940> to<00:03:09.510> get<00:03:09.840> in<00:03:10.140> on<00:03:10.530> the

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
so I say wow we need to get in on the

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:17.000 
so I say wow we need to get in on the
ground<00:03:11.100> floor<00:03:11.640> of<00:03:13.280> anymore<00:03:14.280> space<00:03:15.859> we<00:03:16.859> need<00:03:16.950> to

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
ground floor of anymore space we need to

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.569 
ground floor of anymore space we need to
get<00:03:17.160> in<00:03:17.340> on<00:03:18.030> the<00:03:18.239> ground<00:03:18.329> floor<00:03:18.540> of<00:03:19.109> the<00:03:19.980> cell

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:20.579 
get in on the ground floor of the cell

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:25.759 
get in on the ground floor of the cell
phone<00:03:21.299> market<00:03:22.230> for<00:03:22.709> example<00:03:24.290> so<00:03:25.290> let's<00:03:25.500> say

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
phone market for example so let's say

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:29.539 
phone market for example so let's say
this<00:03:26.010> is<00:03:26.480> a<00:03:27.480> country<00:03:27.900> where<00:03:28.739> there's<00:03:28.980> no<00:03:29.250> cell

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 
this is a country where there's no cell

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:31.520 
this is a country where there's no cell
phones<00:03:29.819> so<00:03:30.329> we<00:03:30.480> need<00:03:30.630> to<00:03:30.780> get<00:03:31.049> in<00:03:31.290> on<00:03:31.410> the

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
phones so we need to get in on the

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.580 
phones so we need to get in on the
