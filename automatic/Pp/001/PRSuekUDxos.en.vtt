like<00:00:48.930> that<00:00:49.020> I<00:00:49.170> try<00:00:49.410> to<00:00:49.469> make<00:00:49.590> it<00:00:49.620> realistic

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
like that I try to make it realistic

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.810

what<00:00:53.820> I<00:00:54.030> want<00:00:55.039> this<00:00:56.039> is<00:00:56.250> why<00:00:56.370> when<00:00:56.610> I<00:00:56.640> do<00:00:57.180> live

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
what I want this is why when I do live

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.299

streams<00:00:57.690> of<00:00:57.870> kings<00:00:58.410> a<00:00:58.530> Coliseum<00:00:58.800> if<00:00:59.190> I

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
streams of kings a Coliseum if I

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.510 
streams of kings a Coliseum if I
probably<00:00:59.579> more<00:00:59.910> realistic<00:01:00.390> because<00:01:01.020> they<00:01:01.520> do

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
probably more realistic because they do

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.130 
probably more realistic because they do
small<00:01:02.850> moves<00:01:03.059> build<00:01:03.390> it<00:01:03.539> up<00:01:03.629> stuff<00:01:03.960> like<00:01:04.019> that

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
small moves build it up stuff like that

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.620
