needs to happen to make this dish

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.759 
needs to happen to make this dish
successful<00:00:12.849> is<00:00:13.059> cold<00:00:13.750> chicken<00:00:14.110> and<00:00:14.440> cold

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:14.769 
successful is cold chicken and cold

cream<00:00:15.900> when<00:00:16.900> they<00:00:17.050> go<00:00:17.140> into<00:00:17.349> the<00:00:17.439> mixer<00:00:17.619> we'll

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:17.950 
cream when they go into the mixer we'll

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:20.490 
cream when they go into the mixer we'll
start<00:00:18.189> to<00:00:18.340> create<00:00:18.610> heat<00:00:18.939> if<00:00:19.210> I<00:00:19.450> heat<00:00:19.779> starts<00:00:20.290> to

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:20.500 
start to create heat if I heat starts to

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.070 
start to create heat if I heat starts to
increase<00:00:21.029> cream<00:00:22.029> won't<00:00:22.270> be<00:00:22.539> able<00:00:22.660> to<00:00:22.810> emulsify

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:23.080 
increase cream won't be able to emulsify

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.680 
increase cream won't be able to emulsify
into<00:00:23.500> the<00:00:23.590> protein<00:00:24.010> above<00:00:24.699> about<00:00:24.940> 20<00:00:25.390> degrees

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:25.690 
into the protein above about 20 degrees

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:27.330 
into the protein above about 20 degrees
so<00:00:26.199> it's<00:00:26.350> key<00:00:26.619> that<00:00:26.650> these<00:00:26.920> are<00:00:27.070> kept<00:00:27.279> very

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:27.340 
so it's key that these are kept very

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:28.439 
so it's key that these are kept very
very<00:00:27.730> cold

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:28.449 
very cold

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:31.679 
very cold
so<00:00:28.900> the<00:00:28.990> first<00:00:29.170> thing<00:00:29.289> we<00:00:29.380> do<00:00:29.760> add<00:00:30.760> the<00:00:31.449> chicken

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:31.689 
so the first thing we do add the chicken

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:35.460 
so the first thing we do add the chicken
into<00:00:31.930> the<00:00:31.990> mixer<00:00:33.330> puree<00:00:34.330> it<00:00:34.570> down<00:00:34.809> now<00:00:35.199> at<00:00:35.350> this

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:35.470 
into the mixer puree it down now at this

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:37.350 
into the mixer puree it down now at this
point<00:00:35.739> no<00:00:36.220> salt<00:00:36.519> needs<00:00:36.699> to<00:00:36.850> be<00:00:36.940> added<00:00:37.180> if<00:00:37.269> we

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:37.360 
point no salt needs to be added if we

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.210 
point no salt needs to be added if we
add<00:00:37.449> salt<00:00:37.720> now<00:00:37.839> it<00:00:38.320> starts<00:00:38.680> to<00:00:38.739> tighten<00:00:39.070> the

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:39.220 
add salt now it starts to tighten the

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.009 
add salt now it starts to tighten the
proteins<00:00:39.670> too<00:00:39.940> much<00:00:40.150> and<00:00:40.360> it<00:00:40.449> turns<00:00:40.839> them

00:00:41.009 --> 00:00:41.019 
proteins too much and it turns them

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:50.520 
proteins too much and it turns them
instead<00:00:41.290> of<00:00:41.350> purees<00:00:41.800> them<00:00:48.900> so<00:00:49.900> now<00:00:50.080> as<00:00:50.229> you<00:00:50.260> can

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:50.530 
instead of purees them so now as you can

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:56.509 
instead of purees them so now as you can
see<00:00:50.739> the<00:00:51.339> chickens<00:00:51.729> been<00:00:51.850> nicely<00:00:52.150> pureed<00:00:52.690> a

00:00:56.509 --> 00:00:56.519 

00:00:56.519 --> 00:01:07.980 

pinch<00:00:57.519> of<00:00:57.670> salt<00:01:00.900> back<00:01:01.900> on<00:01:02.080> with<00:01:02.199> the<00:01:02.229> lid<00:01:06.990> ok

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:07.990 
pinch of salt back on with the lid ok

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:09.420 
pinch of salt back on with the lid ok
the<00:01:08.110> next<00:01:08.320> stage<00:01:08.469> is<00:01:08.649> to<00:01:08.770> slowly<00:01:08.979> add<00:01:09.189> the<00:01:09.340> egg

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:09.430 
the next stage is to slowly add the egg

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:35.670 
the next stage is to slowly add the egg
whites

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:35.680 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.930 

now<00:01:36.680> the<00:01:36.740> egg<00:01:36.890> whites<00:01:37.070> a<00:01:37.159> bit<00:01:37.280> emulsified<00:01:37.729> into

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:37.940 
now the egg whites a bit emulsified into

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:39.340 
now the egg whites a bit emulsified into
the<00:01:38.090> chicken<00:01:38.390> mousse<00:01:38.540> you've<00:01:38.870> got<00:01:38.990> a<00:01:39.020> full<00:01:39.260> of

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
the chicken mousse you've got a full of

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:49.690 

turn<00:01:47.869> the<00:01:47.960> mixer<00:01:48.229> on<00:01:48.290> and<00:01:48.590> steadily<00:01:49.250> pour<00:01:49.580> in

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
turn the mixer on and steadily pour in

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.580 
turn the mixer on and steadily pour in
the<00:01:49.790> cream<00:01:49.940> not<00:01:50.390> too<00:01:50.780> slowly<00:01:51.110> because<00:01:51.500> you're

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 
the cream not too slowly because you're

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.080 
the cream not too slowly because you're
going<00:01:51.680> to<00:01:51.740> allow<00:01:51.920> that<00:01:51.950> heat<00:01:52.340> to<00:01:52.490> build<00:01:52.640> up<00:01:52.880> a

going to allow that heat to build up a

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.810 
going to allow that heat to build up a

nice steady stream not too much just

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.240 
nice steady stream not too much just
enough<00:01:55.970> so<00:01:56.450> it<00:01:56.600> starts<00:01:57.259> to<00:01:57.320> emulsify<00:01:57.590> not

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
enough so it starts to emulsify not

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:59.620 
enough so it starts to emulsify not
dissimilar<00:01:58.550> to<00:01:58.759> a<00:01:58.850> hollandaise<00:01:59.360> or<00:01:59.600> a

obviously<00:02:36.750> you<00:02:37.230> should<00:02:37.380> be<00:02:37.500> tasting<00:02:37.950> raw

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
obviously you should be tasting raw

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.460 
obviously you should be tasting raw
chicken<00:02:38.520> this<00:02:39.000> will<00:02:39.180> allow<00:02:39.390> you<00:02:39.450> to<00:02:39.690> taste<00:02:39.990> the
