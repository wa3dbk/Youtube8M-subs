00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:38.720 
in basic design lots of bits of geometry

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.480 
in basic design lots of bits of geometry
and<00:01:38.750> shapes<00:01:39.080> and<00:01:39.290> things<00:01:39.530> normally<00:01:40.400> the

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
and shapes and things normally the

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.880 
and shapes and things normally the
shapes<00:01:40.760> are<00:01:41.090> done<00:01:41.420> with<00:01:42.110> some<00:01:42.410> sort<00:01:42.650> of<00:01:42.680> box

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
shapes are done with some sort of box

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.800 
shapes are done with some sort of box
hedging<00:01:43.310> in<00:01:43.400> this<00:01:43.490> case<00:01:43.729> it's<00:01:43.970> Japanese<00:01:44.450> box

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
hedging in this case it's Japanese box

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:46.600 
hedging in this case it's Japanese box
hedging<00:01:45.260> and<00:01:45.350> then<00:01:45.500> English<00:01:45.860> box<00:01:46.340> for<00:01:46.550> the

pointy of bits in the middle of all
those<00:01:49.100> lines<00:01:49.490> you<00:01:49.760> have<00:01:49.940> seasonal<00:01:50.360> color<00:01:51.050> and

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
those lines you have seasonal color and

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:52.750 
those lines you have seasonal color and
that's<00:01:51.410> the<00:01:51.650> whole<00:01:51.830> idea<00:01:51.860> of<00:01:52.280> this<00:01:52.460> sort<00:01:52.520> of

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:52.760 
that's the whole idea of this sort of

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.150 
that's the whole idea of this sort of
garden<00:01:53.150> is<00:01:53.270> that<00:01:53.630> at<00:01:54.410> a<00:01:54.470> certain<00:01:54.500> time<00:01:54.950> the

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:55.160 
garden is that at a certain time the

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:56.800 
garden is that at a certain time the
year<00:01:55.310> when<00:01:55.550> the<00:01:55.790> color<00:01:56.030> for<00:01:56.240> that<00:01:56.330> season<00:01:56.630> has

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
year when the color for that season has

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.060 
year when the color for that season has
looking<00:01:56.990> a<00:01:57.050> bit<00:01:57.170> ratty<00:01:57.350> and<00:01:57.530> horrible<00:01:57.800> you<00:01:57.920> rip

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.070 
looking a bit ratty and horrible you rip

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:59.800 
looking a bit ratty and horrible you rip
that<00:01:58.100> out<00:01:58.250> put<00:01:58.610> in<00:01:58.700> some<00:01:58.880> new<00:01:59.000> stuff<00:01:59.270> and<00:01:59.630> we're

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
that out put in some new stuff and we're

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.420 
that out put in some new stuff and we're
at<00:01:59.960> that<00:01:59.990> stage<00:02:00.200> at<00:02:00.680> the<00:02:00.740> moment<00:02:00.800> really<00:02:01.160> where

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.430 
at that stage at the moment really where

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:02.859 
at that stage at the moment really where
they've<00:02:01.580> ripped<00:02:01.820> out<00:02:02.000> the<00:02:02.180> old<00:02:02.330> stuff<00:02:02.479> and<00:02:02.810> the
