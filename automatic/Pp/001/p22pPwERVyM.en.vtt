00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
the bolts off the studs as we showed you

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.260 
the bolts off the studs as we showed you
earlier<00:02:56.230> on<00:02:56.650> the<00:02:56.740> stock<00:02:56.980> system<00:02:57.220> it's<00:02:57.910> just<00:02:58.150> a

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:58.270 
earlier on the stock system it's just a

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:00.840 
earlier on the stock system it's just a
quick<00:02:58.570> release<00:02:58.810> setup<00:02:59.200> a<00:03:00.010> lot<00:03:00.340> of<00:03:00.460> people<00:03:00.580> like

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 
quick release setup a lot of people like

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:02.970 
quick release setup a lot of people like
that<00:03:01.060> that<00:03:01.390> put<00:03:01.930> a<00:03:01.960> lot<00:03:02.080> of<00:03:02.110> time<00:03:02.350> in<00:03:02.530> racing<00:03:02.890> it

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
that that put a lot of time in racing it

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.140 
that that put a lot of time in racing it
just<00:03:03.190> makes<00:03:03.370> maintenance<00:03:03.790> a<00:03:03.880> little<00:03:04.060> bit

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
just makes maintenance a little bit

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.030 
just makes maintenance a little bit
easier<00:03:04.270> so<00:03:05.230> what<00:03:05.350> we'll<00:03:05.470> do<00:03:05.560> is<00:03:05.650> we'll<00:03:05.770> put<00:03:05.950> the

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
easier so what we'll do is we'll put the

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.350 
easier so what we'll do is we'll put the
two<00:03:06.190> bolts<00:03:06.400> on<00:03:06.670> those<00:03:06.880> studs<00:03:08.340> loosely<00:03:09.340> and<00:03:10.210> we

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 
two bolts on those studs loosely and we

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:11.790 
two bolts on those studs loosely and we
won't<00:03:10.480> tighten<00:03:10.750> up<00:03:10.900> anything<00:03:11.200> until<00:03:11.560> we<00:03:11.650> have

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:11.800 
won't tighten up anything until we have

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.010 
won't tighten up anything until we have
the<00:03:11.890> entire<00:03:12.160> system<00:03:12.460> on<00:03:12.730> the<00:03:12.850> bike<00:03:13.060> make<00:03:13.810> sense

flying<00:04:29.940> W<00:04:30.419> and<00:04:30.600> the<00:04:30.630> pipe<00:04:31.350> hits<00:04:31.560> the<00:04:31.740> dirt<00:04:31.919> that

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:33.200 
flying W and the pipe hits the dirt that

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.990 
flying W and the pipe hits the dirt that
spacer<00:04:34.200> the<00:04:34.350> spacers<00:04:34.770> that<00:04:34.800> are<00:04:35.070> rounded<00:04:35.639> will

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
spacer the spacers that are rounded will

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.180 
spacer the spacers that are rounded will
allow<00:04:36.240> the<00:04:36.300> pipe<00:04:36.690> to<00:04:36.930> take<00:04:37.139> the<00:04:37.289> hit<00:04:37.500> and<00:04:37.650> move

00:04:58.909 --> 00:04:58.919 
or break something on the bike so we

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:00.920 
or break something on the bike so we
