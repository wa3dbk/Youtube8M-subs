00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:09.520 

okay<00:00:08.189> we're<00:00:08.550> looking<00:00:08.670> at<00:00:08.880> the

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:09.530 
okay we're looking at the

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:16.470 
okay we're looking at the
Lesly<00:00:10.100> 760<00:00:10.910> organ

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:16.480 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.880 

you're<00:00:17.480> looking<00:00:17.870> at<00:00:17.960> the<00:00:18.050> amplifier<00:00:18.560> there

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:18.890 
you're looking at the amplifier there

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:22.660 
you're looking at the amplifier there
and<00:00:19.570> in<00:00:20.570> this<00:00:20.990> case<00:00:21.320> the<00:00:21.860> Leslie<00:00:22.250> was<00:00:22.369> built<00:00:22.580> in

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:22.670 
and in this case the Leslie was built in

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:25.690 
and in this case the Leslie was built in
the<00:00:22.700> 1970s<00:00:23.360> so<00:00:24.170> this<00:00:24.470> is<00:00:24.619> solid-state<00:00:25.340> which

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:25.700 
the 1970s so this is solid-state which

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.359 
the 1970s so this is solid-state which
means<00:00:26.000> that<00:00:26.240> it<00:00:26.330> has<00:00:26.800> the<00:00:27.800> printed<00:00:28.189> circuit

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:28.369 
means that it has the printed circuit

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:32.140 
means that it has the printed circuit
board<00:00:28.550> and<00:00:28.970> and<00:00:30.220> it<00:00:31.220> was<00:00:31.369> considered<00:00:31.759> modern

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:32.150 
board and and it was considered modern

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:35.490 
board and and it was considered modern
at<00:00:32.300> the<00:00:32.390> time<00:00:32.630> the<00:00:33.320> organ<00:00:33.829> built<00:00:34.610> in<00:00:34.700> 1950

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:35.500 
at the time the organ built in 1950

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.440 
at the time the organ built in 1950
whatever<00:00:36.500> 50s

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:38.450 
whatever 50s

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:40.479 
whatever 50s
it<00:00:38.870> actually<00:00:39.050> has<00:00:39.320> tubes<00:00:39.649> in<00:00:39.860> the<00:00:39.950> back<00:00:40.130> of<00:00:40.370> it

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:40.489 
it actually has tubes in the back of it

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:45.370 
it actually has tubes in the back of it
and<00:00:40.610> if<00:00:41.450> you<00:00:42.020> can<00:00:42.170> hear<00:00:42.380> this

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:45.380 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.620 

sort<00:00:46.100> of<00:00:46.160> like<00:00:46.280> the<00:00:46.430> hum<00:00:46.640> of<00:00:46.820> the<00:00:46.940> tubes<00:00:47.210> or

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:47.630 
sort of like the hum of the tubes or

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:49.210 
sort of like the hum of the tubes or
maybe<00:00:47.990> it's<00:00:48.140> just<00:00:48.320> the<00:00:48.410> age<00:00:48.440> of<00:00:48.710> the<00:00:48.800> unit<00:00:49.070> or

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:49.220 
maybe it's just the age of the unit or

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:50.590 
maybe it's just the age of the unit or
maybe<00:00:49.430> I<00:00:49.520> always<00:00:49.790> had<00:00:49.940> that<00:00:50.060> sound<00:00:50.240> I'm<00:00:50.450> not

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600 
maybe I always had that sound I'm not

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.810 
maybe I always had that sound I'm not
sure<00:00:51.010> you<00:00:52.010> really<00:00:52.220> can't<00:00:52.430> hear<00:00:52.640> it<00:00:52.730> when

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:52.820 
sure you really can't hear it when

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.980 
sure you really can't hear it when
you're<00:00:52.940> playing<00:00:53.590> and<00:00:54.790> the<00:00:55.790> noise<00:00:56.000> kind<00:00:56.210> of<00:00:56.300> you

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:56.990 
you're playing and the noise kind of you

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:58.900 
you're playing and the noise kind of you
know<00:00:57.080> that<00:00:57.260> dead<00:00:57.440> space<00:00:57.740> like<00:00:57.980> that<00:00:58.010> helps<00:00:58.760> me

00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:58.910 
know that dead space like that helps me

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:05.890 
know that dead space like that helps me
to<00:00:59.150> communicate<00:00:59.840> with<00:01:00.110> the<00:01:00.410> dead<00:01:00.590> now<00:01:04.720> that<00:01:05.720> is

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:05.900 
to communicate with the dead now that is

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.210 
to communicate with the dead now that is

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.120 
all of its sound is coming out of that
that<00:01:31.430> scoop<00:01:31.850> and<00:01:32.119> when<00:01:32.690> the<00:01:32.979> motors<00:01:33.979> are

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
that scoop and when the motors are

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.650 
that scoop and when the motors are
running<00:01:36.640> that<00:01:37.640> scoop<00:01:37.970> is<00:01:38.150> spinning<00:01:38.540> around

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:38.660 
running that scoop is spinning around

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:44.710 
running that scoop is spinning around
and<00:01:39.200> it<00:01:40.420> makes<00:01:41.420> a<00:01:41.690> heavy<00:01:42.560> wobble<00:01:43.100> noise<00:01:43.720> that's

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
and it makes a heavy wobble noise that's

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.499 
and it makes a heavy wobble noise that's
kind<00:01:45.290> of<00:01:45.380> popular<00:01:46.040> with<00:01:46.250> speaker<00:01:47.030> or<00:01:47.210> with

see those spinning around doing the same
thing<00:02:13.069> as<00:02:13.280> they're<00:02:13.459> blowing<00:02:13.760> their<00:02:13.880> sound

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
thing as they're blowing their sound

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.199 
thing as they're blowing their sound
through<00:02:14.420> the<00:02:14.540> vent<00:02:14.720> holes<00:02:14.959> in<00:02:15.200> the<00:02:16.209> wooden

through the vent holes in the wooden

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:34.770 
through the vent holes in the wooden
case<00:02:17.569> of<00:02:17.870> the<00:02:18.380> speaker<00:02:19.270> let's<00:02:20.270> see

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:41.650 

and<00:02:35.780> here<00:02:36.439> it<00:02:36.680> is<00:02:36.739> on<00:02:37.099> high

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:03:03.619 

you're<00:02:42.230> actually<00:02:42.560> seeing<00:02:42.800> a<00:02:42.920> blur<00:02:43.190> there

00:03:03.619 --> 00:03:03.629 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:07.500

having the organ with or the speaker
with<00:03:07.689> no<00:03:07.870> motion<00:03:08.260> at<00:03:08.319> all<00:03:08.470> gives<00:03:09.069> you<00:03:09.189> a

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
with no motion at all gives you a

with no motion at all gives you a
certain<00:03:09.610> sound<00:03:09.970> and<00:03:10.239> then<00:03:10.989> this<00:03:11.379> right<00:03:11.709> now<00:03:11.920> at

00:03:12.149 --> 00:03:12.159 
certain sound and then this right now at

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:13.589 
certain sound and then this right now at
slow<00:03:12.400> speed<00:03:12.700> gives<00:03:13.150> you<00:03:13.209> a<00:03:13.269> slightly

00:03:13.589 --> 00:03:13.599 
slow speed gives you a slightly

high speed it gives you the heavy

00:03:17.939 --> 00:03:21.539 
high speed it gives you the heavy
vibrato<00:03:18.939> now<00:03:19.840> I'm<00:03:20.560> not<00:03:20.920> playing<00:03:21.099> this<00:03:21.340> like<00:03:21.489> a
