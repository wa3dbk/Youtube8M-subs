everything a playground a mother a
protector<00:01:43.530> a<00:01:43.770> guy<00:01:46.159> the<00:01:47.159> issue<00:01:47.310> was<00:01:47.759> the

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
protector a guy the issue was the

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.300 
protector a guy the issue was the
quality<00:01:48.450> is<00:01:48.509> important<00:01:49.259> because<00:01:49.859> it

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
quality is important because it

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.940 
quality is important because it
determines<00:01:50.369> whether<00:01:51.299> we<00:01:51.539> can<00:01:51.719> use<00:01:52.140> our<00:01:52.500> water

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
determines whether we can use our water

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.539 
determines whether we can use our water
or<00:01:53.399> not<00:01:53.840> everyone<00:01:54.840> is<00:01:55.049> dirty<00:01:55.530> or<00:01:55.740> polluted

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
or not everyone is dirty or polluted

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.870 
or not everyone is dirty or polluted
then<00:01:57.060> that<00:01:57.270> means<00:01:57.450> it's<00:01:57.750> not<00:01:57.840> usable

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
then that means it's not usable

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.969 
then that means it's not usable
therefore<00:01:59.880> the<00:01:59.969> water<00:02:00.149> quality<00:02:00.450> is<00:02:00.750> poor<00:02:01.229> if

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
therefore the water quality is poor if

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.940 
therefore the water quality is poor if
the<00:02:02.369> water<00:02:02.640> is<00:02:03.060> nice<00:02:03.390> and<00:02:03.810> clean<00:02:04.229> and<00:02:04.259> healthy

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
the water is nice and clean and healthy

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.359 
the water is nice and clean and healthy
then<00:02:05.909> we<00:02:06.090> can<00:02:06.299> use<00:02:06.329> our<00:02:06.749> water<00:02:07.109> now<00:02:07.560> in<00:02:07.950> this

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
then we can use our water now in this

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:09.919 
then we can use our water now in this
instance<00:02:08.789> you're<00:02:09.000> not<00:02:09.149> talking<00:02:09.509> about<00:02:09.630> what

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
instance you're not talking about what

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.810 
instance you're not talking about what
they<00:02:10.019> called<00:02:10.259> possible<00:02:10.920> water<00:02:11.160> which<00:02:11.519> is<00:02:11.549> what

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:11.820 
they called possible water which is what

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.170 
they called possible water which is what
we<00:02:11.940> used<00:02:12.180> to<00:02:12.359> drink<00:02:12.660> we're<00:02:13.500> talking<00:02:13.680> about

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
we used to drink we're talking about

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.509 
we used to drink we're talking about
recreational<00:02:15.180> water<00:02:15.600> quality<00:02:16.049> how<00:02:16.980> we<00:02:17.040> go

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:17.519 
recreational water quality how we go

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:20.599 
recreational water quality how we go
like<00:02:17.790> what<00:02:18.060> so<00:02:18.239> we<00:02:18.390> used<00:02:18.660> to<00:02:18.900> play<00:02:19.200> one<00:02:20.100> use<00:02:20.370> the

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:20.609 
like what so we used to play one use the

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:24.259 
like what so we used to play one use the
sports<00:02:21.090> when<00:02:21.390> we<00:02:21.510> go<00:02:21.660> to<00:02:21.690> the<00:02:21.930> beach<00:02:23.120> we<00:02:24.120> have

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:24.269 
sports when we go to the beach we have

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:26.840 
sports when we go to the beach we have
stripped<00:02:24.690> off<00:02:25.019> cover<00:02:25.350> better<00:02:26.340> to<00:02:26.730> the

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.710 

the<00:02:53.390> soil<00:02:53.720> is<00:02:54.079> supposed<00:02:54.590> to<00:02:54.739> be<00:02:54.829> on<00:02:55.250> the<00:02:55.459> land

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
the soil is supposed to be on the land

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.600 
the soil is supposed to be on the land
rather<00:02:56.720> than<00:02:56.959> there<00:02:57.140> in<00:02:57.230> the<00:02:57.349> river<00:02:57.500> in<00:02:58.310> the

rather than there in the river in the

rather than there in the river in the
river<00:02:59.500> soil<00:03:00.500> loss<00:03:01.010> is<00:03:01.489> like<00:03:01.819> a<00:03:01.849> double

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:02.329 
river soil loss is like a double

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:05.110 
river soil loss is like a double
jeopardy<00:03:02.750> because<00:03:03.560> in<00:03:03.920> the<00:03:04.069> river<00:03:04.250> it<00:03:04.700> will

jeopardy because in the river it will

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.619 
jeopardy because in the river it will
reduces<00:03:05.870> the<00:03:06.769> quality<00:03:06.980> and<00:03:07.579> quantity<00:03:07.670> of

you put tractor and you put a tractor

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.250 
you put tractor and you put a tractor
you'll<00:03:49.760> have<00:03:49.970> what<00:03:50.150> is<00:03:50.269> called<00:03:50.329> a<00:03:50.720> hard<00:03:50.989> pan

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 
you'll have what is called a hard pan

you'll have what is called a hard pan
you<00:03:52.099> will<00:03:52.220> also<00:03:52.370> have<00:03:52.699> the<00:03:52.760> tractor<00:03:53.859> creating

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:54.859 
you will also have the tractor creating

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:56.890 
you will also have the tractor creating
some<00:03:55.190> lines<00:03:55.819> that<00:03:55.970> can<00:03:56.269> cause<00:03:56.569> further

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900 
some lines that can cause further
