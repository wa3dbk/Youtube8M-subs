since each face is an equilateral

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:22.320 
since each face is an equilateral
triangle<00:00:20.830> we<00:00:21.190> need<00:00:21.340> to<00:00:21.430> work<00:00:21.610> out<00:00:21.820> the<00:00:21.970> area<00:00:22.150> of

saij triangle has side lengths for one
in<00:00:30.220> order<00:00:30.430> to<00:00:30.610> work<00:00:30.760> out<00:00:30.940> the<00:00:31.090> area<00:00:31.119> of<00:00:31.780> this<00:00:32.079> we

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:32.770 
in order to work out the area of this we

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:34.829 
in order to work out the area of this we
can<00:00:32.920> think<00:00:33.070> about<00:00:33.429> cutting<00:00:33.969> the<00:00:34.329> triangle

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:34.839 
can think about cutting the triangle

00:00:34.839 --> 00:00:37.590 
can think about cutting the triangle
than<00:00:35.079> the<00:00:35.289> middle<00:00:35.589> and<00:00:36.300> placing<00:00:37.300> them<00:00:37.420> like

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:37.600 
than the middle and placing them like

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.380 
than the middle and placing them like
this<00:00:37.839> in<00:00:38.140> order<00:00:38.350> to<00:00:38.440> make<00:00:38.589> a<00:00:38.620> rectangle<00:00:39.390> we

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:40.390 
this in order to make a rectangle we

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.290 
this in order to make a rectangle we
know<00:00:40.539> area<00:00:41.019> is<00:00:41.170> simply<00:00:41.499> defined<00:00:41.649> as<00:00:42.129> one<00:00:42.969> side

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:43.300 
know area is simply defined as one side

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.719 
know area is simply defined as one side
multiplied<00:00:43.870> by<00:00:44.019> the<00:00:44.079> other<00:00:44.319> the<00:00:45.219> bottom<00:00:45.550> edge

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:45.729 
multiplied by the other the bottom edge

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:47.849 
multiplied by the other the bottom edge
is<00:00:45.940> half<00:00:46.300> the<00:00:46.479> base<00:00:46.659> length<00:00:46.960> and<00:00:47.319> the<00:00:47.589> side

00:00:47.849 --> 00:00:47.859 
is half the base length and the side

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:50.790 
is half the base length and the side
edge<00:00:48.129> is<00:00:48.399> the<00:00:48.609> height<00:00:48.850> of<00:00:49.059> the<00:00:49.179> triangle<00:00:49.800> and

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:50.800 
edge is the height of the triangle and

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.799 
edge is the height of the triangle and
so<00:00:50.979> the<00:00:51.100> area<00:00:51.519> of<00:00:51.609> our<00:00:51.729> triangle<00:00:52.030> is<00:00:52.449> 1/2<00:00:52.600> base

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:52.809 
so the area of our triangle is 1/2 base

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:56.459 
so the area of our triangle is 1/2 base
times<00:00:53.499> height<00:00:54.420> but<00:00:55.420> what<00:00:55.629> is<00:00:55.780> the<00:00:55.960> height<00:00:56.139> it's

00:00:56.459 --> 00:00:56.469 
times height but what is the height it's

00:00:56.469 --> 00:00:59.189 
times height but what is the height it's
not<00:00:56.710> one<00:00:56.979> that's<00:00:57.280> the<00:00:57.429> side<00:00:57.699> length<00:00:57.969> if<00:00:58.300> we

00:00:59.189 --> 00:00:59.199 
not one that's the side length if we

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:01.229 
not one that's the side length if we
draw<00:00:59.379> a<00:00:59.409> line<00:00:59.649> perpendicular<00:01:00.100> to<00:01:00.609> the<00:01:00.729> base<00:01:00.940> up

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:01.239 
draw a line perpendicular to the base up

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:03.299 
draw a line perpendicular to the base up
to<00:01:01.329> the<00:01:01.420> top<00:01:01.719> and<00:01:01.989> then<00:01:02.559> only<00:01:02.829> consider<00:01:03.159> the

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:03.309 
to the top and then only consider the

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:05.369 
to the top and then only consider the
left<00:01:03.549> hand<00:01:03.819> side<00:01:04.059> we<00:01:04.600> have<00:01:04.629> a<00:01:04.750> right-angled

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:05.379 
left hand side we have a right-angled

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:06.870 
left hand side we have a right-angled
triangle<00:01:05.830> where<00:01:06.340> the<00:01:06.460> height<00:01:06.640> of<00:01:06.790> our

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:13.240 
sides by using pythagoras theorem we

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.540 
sides by using pythagoras theorem we

know that the square of the two sides is

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:17.820 
know that the square of the two sides is
equal<00:01:15.610> to<00:01:16.060> the<00:01:16.210> square<00:01:16.540> of<00:01:16.570> the<00:01:16.840> hypotenuse<00:01:17.590> or

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:17.830 
equal to the square of the hypotenuse or

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:20.160 
equal to the square of the hypotenuse or

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.170 
a squared plus B squared equals C

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.990 
a squared plus B squared equals C
squared<00:01:20.290> a<00:01:22.350> in<00:01:23.350> this<00:01:23.560> case<00:01:23.830> is<00:01:24.190> a<00:01:24.250> half<00:01:24.640> of<00:01:24.880> the

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:35.820 
air collateral triangle and C is just
one<00:01:34.330> side<00:01:34.600> of<00:01:34.780> our<00:01:34.840> air<00:01:34.990> collateral<00:01:35.410> triangle

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:35.830 
one side of our air collateral triangle

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:41.010 
one side of our air collateral triangle
or<00:01:36.010> 1<00:01:36.520> and<00:01:37.260> so<00:01:38.260> we<00:01:38.470> have<00:01:38.710> 1/2<00:01:39.250> squared<00:01:39.880> plus<00:01:40.570> h

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
or 1 and so we have 1/2 squared plus h

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.610 
or 1 and so we have 1/2 squared plus h
squared<00:01:41.440> equals<00:01:42.160> 1<00:01:42.400> squared<00:01:43.590> rearranging<00:01:44.590> we

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:44.620 
squared equals 1 squared rearranging we

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:49.070 
squared equals 1 squared rearranging we
get<00:01:44.860> h<00:01:45.130> squared<00:01:45.520> equals<00:01:46.090> 1<00:01:46.390> minus<00:01:46.750> 1/4<00:01:47.610> 3/4

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:49.080 
get h squared equals 1 minus 1/4 3/4

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.110 
get h squared equals 1 minus 1/4 3/4
then<00:01:50.080> taking<00:01:50.440> the<00:01:50.530> positive<00:01:50.950> square<00:01:51.130> root<00:01:51.490> h

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:52.120 
then taking the positive square root h

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:56.280 
then taking the positive square root h
equals<00:01:52.570> root<00:01:53.080> 3<00:01:53.380> over<00:01:53.530> 2<00:01:54.660> so<00:01:55.660> returning<00:01:56.050> to<00:01:56.260> our

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.290 
equals root 3 over 2 so returning to our

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:58.200 
equals root 3 over 2 so returning to our
formula<00:01:56.740> for<00:01:57.010> the<00:01:57.100> area<00:01:57.250> of<00:01:57.520> a<00:01:57.640> neck<00:01:57.820> radical

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:11.340 
the height H which is root 3 over 2 as
we<00:02:09.100> just<00:02:09.310> figured<00:02:09.580> out<00:02:09.729> so<00:02:10.630> the<00:02:10.750> area<00:02:11.170> of<00:02:11.290> a

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350 
we just figured out so the area of a

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:14.850 
we just figured out so the area of a
triangle<00:02:11.650> is<00:02:12.040> root<00:02:12.340> 3<00:02:12.670> over<00:02:13.060> 4

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
triangle is root 3 over 4

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.679 
triangle is root 3 over 4
the<00:02:15.860> tetrahedron<00:02:16.519> has<00:02:16.670> four<00:02:17.000> of<00:02:17.150> these<00:02:17.360> sides

00:02:17.679 --> 00:02:17.689 
the tetrahedron has four of these sides

00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:20.110 
the tetrahedron has four of these sides
and<00:02:18.079> so<00:02:18.530> the<00:02:18.650> surface<00:02:18.860> area<00:02:19.370> is<00:02:19.489> simply<00:02:19.700> four

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
and so the surface area is simply four

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.460 
and so the surface area is simply four
times<00:02:20.510> the<00:02:20.750> area<00:02:20.930> of<00:02:21.230> an<00:02:21.409> equilateral

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
times the area of an equilateral

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:22.920 
times the area of an equilateral
triangle

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
triangle

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.020 
triangle
thus<00:02:23.930> the<00:02:24.200> surface<00:02:24.560> area<00:02:25.010> of<00:02:25.069> our<00:02:25.280> tetrahedron

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
thus the surface area of our tetrahedron

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:31.200 
thus the surface area of our tetrahedron
reviewnit<00:02:26.420> side<00:02:26.780> length<00:02:27.049> is<00:02:27.319> root<00:02:27.650> free

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:31.210 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:33.120
