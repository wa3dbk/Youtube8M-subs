00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 hi girls and guys how are you 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:05.009
 I hope you are great in the video 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.170
 and I'm going to make a special collaboration 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.150
 with jim and going from the blog to Friday poles 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.070
 talk about it and we have decided the 2 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.230
 challenge us a bit and take as a reference 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.299
 to the burberry resort collection 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.490
 prorsum then we really liked the 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.990
 two and we saw as quite potential for 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.430
 make us water and then I'm going to 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.260
 do my own interpretation I do not know what 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.510
 that you already have prepared in any case 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.789
 I'll leave a link to the video here to your 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.910
 own video or below in the description 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:33.470
 of youtube and I will start as I say 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.470
 with the materials that we need 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.540
 we are going to need some stones 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.970
 special to decorate that garment a 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:45.190
 special glue for metals and ones 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:46.480
 chopsticks to help us in the process and 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.550
 the particular garment that I decide 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.260
 customizar s was bardina and a garment 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:51.850
 that I love about burberry that is in 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:54.220
 general the raincoats the garments of 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.080
 coat and good chosen this one that had in 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.940
 house that I find very cute and very easy 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.440
 to customize then what I'm going to 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.000
 do is going to be what we have seen in your 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.980
 own collection that consisted of 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.580
 I'll let you find here pictures 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:08.950
 in embedding or beautifying a garment with 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.840
 help of small stones stones more 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.310
 large and create small nuclei of 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.450
 stones along that garment 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.640
 so what I'm going to do basically 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.140
 I'm going to take this sweep I'm creating 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.729
 small areas that I will fill in 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.350
 stones the stones that I will use 

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:21.910
 I commented that he has commanded me a 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.110
 store that I already told you that is called one 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:24.759
 the gang hunt that is where you can 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.649
 find materials to make cool 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:28.180
 and I have to tell you honestly that they are 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:29.770
 the best stones that counted 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.840
 I found in what I've been doing 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.580
 of cool for a lot of times it 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.259
 they were still as madrid as I give you 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.520
 now and I always find stones of 

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:38.259
 these that you have seen more in my 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.630
 ten cool ones that are totally from 

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:41.800
 plastic a base that no no no no they are 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.570
 good stones 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.310
 for example I wanted to show how 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.170
 come structures seem more crystals 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.820
 although obviously it's plastic but they're 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.260
 very well taken care of and then apart it has 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.330
 a base as you see here below that can 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.770
 Serve very well for sewing or gluing 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.420
 well I did not want to mention because 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.370
 good as always to find 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.630
 materials when they are ones of 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:01.180
 good quality well worth it 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.560
 You also see it from the side, highlight it 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.510
 there are many colors animates 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.460
 Also send in this super box 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:08.619
 organized once I had also 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.270
 has organized the materials and never and 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:11.890
 nothing, let's start little by little with the 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.360
 new design that we are going to give to that 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.000
 gabardine the first thing I'm going to do is 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.590
 to be put the raincoat is on a 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.840
 flat surface and then put 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.130
 a piece of leaf below it so 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.360
 what I'm going to do is going to be with the help of a 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.510
 ballpoint pen that is what I have done is 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.740
 silhouette and the shape of the raincoat 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.210
 gabardine collar with a place 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:30.100
 where I'm going to add those details to you 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:31.360
 be in the peak the raincoat because I do 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.460
 this is good because first I have to 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.470
 decide what will be the way you 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:36.940
 I'm going to give these to this design wanted 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.980
 doing it on the raincoat itself is very 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:40.360
 complicated because if we do not hit it, it 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.010
 is moving all I prefer first 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.600
 create a design on a surface 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.550
 totally flat I will be creating 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.270
 that flower that I will go seeing how 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:50.360
 I do because really as you see 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:52.370
 totally on the fly with my style 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.810
 usual here you can see 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.340
 close how is that small 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.200
 design that I'm going to do on the flap of 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.420
 the raincoat as you see is a game of 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.100
 flowers as with petals a central area 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.570
 and petals next we are going to 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.800
 use this special glue to 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:05.030
 metals that is what is called more than one 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.080
 once around here and let's go the cap 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.420
 continuation on a surface 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.010
 metallic as it can be a role of 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:13.430
 these aluminum we throw a little bit of 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:15.560
 both of us and we closed quickly because if 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.450
 it does not overflow everything and we enrich 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.160
 with the help of a stick we are mixing 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.870
 As you can see, I'm doing 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.460
 mixing that mixture because the two 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.140
 glues work together and you have to 

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:26.150
 mix them previously taking as 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:28.580
 show the design here I will go putting 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.750
 the little things on their opposite side then 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:31.550
 simply with the help of a toothpick 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:33.530
 at this moment you have to be pretty 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:36.080
 careful let's apply in the part of 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:38.000
 back a bit of glue with care 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:39.200
 that we are not going to overflow the 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.670
 first stone that we have placed was 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.230
 pretty big and we could easily 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:43.880
 with your hand, however, use 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:45.620
 following are going to be smaller as 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:47.030
 is that I am teaching you here with what 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:50.580
 which is very convenient for you to help 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:52.560
 of one of a pliers 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:56.400
 place the can you just take the 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:58.200
 stick you take a little bit of product and 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.240
 apply here on the back of 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.220
 the stone you see next what 

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:03.900
 place on the corresponding side of the 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.340
 design directly apply the 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.050
 glue no longer with the stick but 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.000
 putting it directly on the paper 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:10.170
 is that I'm doing to take a 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.990
 little bit of glue on the part of 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.430
 back you see like this and the following we remove 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:16.500
 a bit too much so that we do not know 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:18.660
 Stain everything and place it in the 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.760
 next beige design point already 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:22.530
 then we make a slight pressure 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.750
 you put this technique very simple but 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:27.350
 good is like Chinese in the sense of 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:28.910
 that you have to be very careful 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:30.890
 at the time of placing the stone of 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:32.450
 apply the glue as you can 

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:33.920
 observe I already have the first part of 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:35.780
 design that is exactly like the 

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:38.770
 that I had designed but applies 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:38.770
 directly the raincoat 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:25.720
 once the first one is done, 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:27.789
 designs simply the game consists of 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:29.500
 let them dry a good time you can 

00:05:27.789 --> 00:05:31.330
 help with some heavy books for 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:33.130
 place on top and make it easy to dry 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:34.930
 as soon as and until here we have arrived 

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:36.310
 what is access to the hoisting the part of 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:37.660
 the collars this raincoat I want 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:39.160
 show you up close so you can see a 

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:40.720
 little as the detail remains, I think 

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:42.759
 that gives you a detail really very 

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:44.259
 pretty original and now the next 

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:46.840
 question is where to continue putting 

00:05:44.259 --> 00:05:48.280
 these little stones along the 

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:50.680
 belly it has occurred to me that the best 

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:52.300
 way is the classic that is access to 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:54.069
 hoisting the pockets as views are the 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:55.479
 for this pocket is what I'm going to do 

00:05:54.069 --> 00:05:57.190
 in the next step we will continue 

00:05:55.479 --> 00:05:58.479
 I'm just going to place a sheet by 

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:00.550
 ahead to do the same thing that we have 

00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:02.910
 done before plotting a little design 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:02.910
 previous 

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:07.480
 and the next thing I'm going to do is with the 

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:09.100
 lapel design this paper I 

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:11.500
 go imagining how I would like 

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:12.880
 outside the design of this other part here 

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:14.800
 you can see how the 

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:16.449
 design of that pocket as you have done 

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:18.699
 also hwan little with the flowers creating 

00:06:16.449 --> 00:06:20.110
 small flowers or small petals already 

00:06:18.699 --> 00:06:21.580
 then the most part comes 

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:22.900
 complicated that is also not 

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:24.340
 so complicated to paste this 

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:27.460
 precisely in the gabardine what 

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:29.800
 we remove the mixture that we are going to place 

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:32.500
 first the stone is big because 

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:35.080
 let's have reference will come 

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:37.120
 very well to place after the others 

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:38.860
 As you can see we put it here in the center 

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:41.800
 and then we are going to place the 

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:44.760
 rest of stones passing the previously 

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:47.650
 as we are constantly doing for 

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:49.389
 glue and here you have the second of 

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:50.979
 the pockets that I'm going to leave to dry and 

00:06:49.389 --> 00:06:52.150
 So far we have arrived with the day of 

00:06:50.979 --> 00:06:52.990
 Today, as you can see, I am wearing 

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:54.880
 gabardine and I think it has been 

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:57.039
 really very cool I want to get closer to 

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:58.660
 you so you can see the details 

00:06:57.039 --> 00:07:01.060
 you see here the pockets stay 

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:02.470
 really very very nice I think it is 

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:04.449
 a very simple detail and that makes 

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:05.409
 a very normal garment you're really going to 

00:07:04.449 --> 00:07:07.479
 have more 

00:07:05.409 --> 00:07:10.089
 it's very simple the whole process is what 

00:07:07.479 --> 00:07:12.959
 I assure you I always tell you what happens 

00:07:10.089 --> 00:07:16.389
 at the moment no unforeseen
