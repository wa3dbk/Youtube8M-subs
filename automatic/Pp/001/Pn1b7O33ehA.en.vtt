flames<00:01:38.179> they're<00:01:38.599> quite<00:01:38.810> cool<00:01:39.020> that<00:01:39.229> they're

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
flames they're quite cool that they're

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.349 
flames they're quite cool that they're
the<00:01:39.920> best<00:01:40.099> bit<00:01:40.340> probably<00:01:41.439> and<00:01:42.439> I<00:01:43.340> had<00:01:43.759> a<00:01:43.999> lot<00:01:44.329> of

00:01:44.349 --> 00:01:44.359 
the best bit probably and I had a lot of

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:47.620 
the best bit probably and I had a lot of
trouble<00:01:44.810> with<00:01:44.899> this<00:01:45.049> because<00:01:45.499> I<00:01:46.479> didn't<00:01:47.479> have

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
trouble with this because I didn't have

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.050 
trouble with this because I didn't have
enough<00:01:47.899> room<00:01:48.169> to<00:01:48.619> make<00:01:49.399> them<00:01:49.700> all<00:01:49.849> the<00:01:49.880> same

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
enough room to make them all the same

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.440 
enough room to make them all the same
size<00:01:50.299> as<00:01:50.840> the<00:01:51.020> E<00:01:51.049> and<00:01:51.619> then<00:01:52.579> when<00:01:52.849> I<00:01:52.880> got<00:01:53.119> to<00:01:53.299> the

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
size as the E and then when I got to the

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:59.830 
size as the E and then when I got to the
elde<00:01:53.749> on<00:01:54.049> the<00:01:54.380> Liverpool<00:01:55.599> I<00:01:58.719> didn't<00:01:59.719> have

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
elde on the Liverpool I didn't have

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.589 
elde on the Liverpool I didn't have
enough<00:02:00.079> room<00:02:00.380> so<00:02:01.249> I<00:02:01.279> had<00:02:01.520> to<00:02:01.639> make<00:02:01.849> these<00:02:02.239> owes

00:02:02.589 --> 00:02:02.599 
enough room so I had to make these owes

00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:05.620 
enough room so I had to make these owes
a<00:02:03.139> lot<00:02:03.469> smaller<00:02:03.859> than<00:02:04.159> all<00:02:04.369> of<00:02:04.520> them<00:02:04.700> so<00:02:05.539> it

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
a lot smaller than all of them so it

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:12.440 
a lot smaller than all of them so it
could<00:02:05.779> fit<00:02:05.959> in<00:02:07.330> so<00:02:08.330> yeah

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:18.770
