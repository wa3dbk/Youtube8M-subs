00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:50.289 

maybe<00:01:46.610> what<00:01:47.450> made<00:01:47.719> this<00:01:47.960> trip<00:01:48.829> unique<00:01:49.369> was<00:01:50.270> the

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:50.299 
maybe what made this trip unique was the

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:54.279 
maybe what made this trip unique was the
photography<00:01:51.219> we<00:01:52.219> were<00:01:53.210> filmed<00:01:53.719> both

00:01:54.279 --> 00:01:54.289 
photography we were filmed both

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:58.600 
photography we were filmed both
underwater<00:01:55.070> and<00:01:55.990> overwater<00:01:57.219> and<00:01:58.219> that's

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
underwater and overwater and that's

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.300 
underwater and overwater and that's
where<00:01:59.210> the<00:01:59.360> crucial<00:01:59.869> difference<00:02:00.049> is<00:02:00.920> made

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
where the crucial difference is made

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.700 
where the crucial difference is made
because<00:02:02.259> the<00:02:03.259> swimming<00:02:03.710> was<00:02:04.280> analyzed<00:02:05.030> by

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
because the swimming was analyzed by

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.440 
because the swimming was analyzed by
clearly<00:02:06.710> people<00:02:07.250> who<00:02:07.610> are<00:02:07.759> a<00:02:07.789> very<00:02:08.030> talented

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.860 
clearly people who are a very talented
level<00:02:09.080> and<00:02:09.289> we<00:02:09.470> could<00:02:09.649> clearly<00:02:10.130> see<00:02:10.660> where<00:02:11.660> we

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
level and we could clearly see where we

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.699 
level and we could clearly see where we
were<00:02:11.989> going<00:02:12.019> wrong

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:20.059 

we've<00:02:17.189> eaten<00:02:17.310> lots<00:02:17.519> of<00:02:17.670> fish<00:02:18.319> the<00:02:19.319> hotel<00:02:19.739> food
