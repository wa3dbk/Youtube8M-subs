00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.860 
honest it's not surprising considering
that<00:03:52.260> it's<00:03:52.500> a<00:03:52.620> low<00:03:53.160> wattage<00:03:53.389> low-cost<00:03:54.389> power

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
that it's a low wattage low-cost power

that it's a low wattage low-cost power
supply<00:03:55.290> option<00:03:55.769> finally<00:03:56.220> get<00:03:56.370> a<00:03:56.400> power<00:03:56.669> supply

00:03:56.839 --> 00:03:56.849 
supply option finally get a power supply

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:59.089 
supply option finally get a power supply
that<00:03:57.239> has<00:03:57.419> enough<00:03:57.840> leads<00:03:58.139> for<00:03:58.470> your<00:03:58.739> setup

00:03:59.089 --> 00:03:59.099 
that has enough leads for your setup

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:00.920 
that has enough leads for your setup
also<00:03:59.519> consider<00:03:59.880> a<00:03:59.940> power<00:04:00.180> supply<00:04:00.569> that<00:04:00.720> has<00:04:00.780> a

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
also consider a power supply that has a

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.870 
also consider a power supply that has a
modular<00:04:01.530> design<00:04:01.560> because<00:04:02.280> it<00:04:02.400> reduces<00:04:02.819> the

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
modular design because it reduces the

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.330 
modular design because it reduces the
cable<00:04:03.329> mess<00:04:03.510> inside<00:04:03.959> of<00:04:04.109> the<00:04:04.200> case<00:04:04.440> also<00:04:04.919> it's

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
cable mess inside of the case also it's

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.069 
cable mess inside of the case also it's
important<00:04:05.790> to<00:04:05.819> get<00:04:05.970> a<00:04:06.000> power<00:04:06.269> supply<00:04:06.480> with<00:04:06.930> an

supply<00:04:41.830> is<00:04:42.280> not<00:04:42.789> modular<00:04:43.539> now<00:04:43.690> personally<00:04:44.409> I

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 
supply is not modular now personally I

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.430 
supply is not modular now personally I
prefer<00:04:44.879> modular<00:04:45.879> power<00:04:46.180> supplies<00:04:46.690> but<00:04:47.169> in

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
prefer modular power supplies but in

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.369 
prefer modular power supplies but in
this<00:04:48.009> range<00:04:48.340> it<00:04:48.699> really<00:04:49.180> doesn't<00:04:49.750> matter<00:04:50.229> a

00:04:50.369 --> 00:04:50.379 
this range it really doesn't matter a

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:52.559 
this range it really doesn't matter a
whole<00:04:50.470> lot<00:04:51.039> because<00:04:51.190> first<00:04:51.580> of<00:04:51.759> all<00:04:51.879> you<00:04:52.300> don't

00:04:52.559 --> 00:04:52.569 
whole lot because first of all you don't

00:04:52.569 --> 00:04:54.990 
whole lot because first of all you don't
have<00:04:52.840> a<00:04:53.020> lot<00:04:53.500> of<00:04:53.530> leads<00:04:53.860> to<00:04:54.099> start<00:04:54.400> with<00:04:54.580> higher

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:55.000 
have a lot of leads to start with higher

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.879 
have a lot of leads to start with higher
wattage<00:04:55.419> power<00:04:55.690> supplies<00:04:56.139> that<00:04:56.470> are<00:04:56.620> not

00:04:56.879 --> 00:04:56.889 
wattage power supplies that are not

00:04:56.889 --> 00:04:59.249 
wattage power supplies that are not
modular<00:04:57.460> can<00:04:57.759> be<00:04:57.940> a<00:04:57.970> real<00:04:58.270> problem<00:04:58.569> because

00:04:59.249 --> 00:04:59.259 
modular can be a real problem because

00:04:59.259 --> 00:05:02.279 
modular can be a real problem because
they<00:04:59.409> have<00:04:59.440> a<00:04:59.560> ton<00:05:00.009> of<00:05:00.250> leads<00:05:00.909> they<00:05:01.389> look<00:05:01.840> bad

00:05:02.279 --> 00:05:02.289 
they have a ton of leads they look bad

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:04.620 
they have a ton of leads they look bad
and<00:05:02.590> they<00:05:03.009> really<00:05:03.370> hinder<00:05:03.880> your<00:05:04.000> flow<00:05:04.210> all<00:05:04.449> of

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:04.630 
and they really hinder your flow all of

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:06.300 
and they really hinder your flow all of
the<00:05:04.720> leads<00:05:04.930> are<00:05:05.139> a<00:05:05.199> sleeve<00:05:05.650> quite<00:05:06.039> a<00:05:06.069> good<00:05:06.280> job

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:06.310 
the leads are a sleeve quite a good job

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:08.939 
the leads are a sleeve quite a good job
it<00:05:06.819> looks<00:05:06.849> good<00:05:07.389> and<00:05:07.750> it<00:05:08.020> should<00:05:08.199> last<00:05:08.409> a<00:05:08.710> while

power supplies in this wattage range are

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:49.080 
power supplies in this wattage range are
very<00:05:46.780> popular<00:05:47.139> because<00:05:47.620> they<00:05:48.460> are<00:05:48.610> affordable
