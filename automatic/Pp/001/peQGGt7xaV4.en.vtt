Herbert from cagayan there is a video of
that<00:03:07.930> was<00:03:08.110> quite<00:03:08.350> a<00:03:08.410> stunning<00:03:09.150> celebration

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
that was quite a stunning celebration

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.540 
that was quite a stunning celebration
very<00:03:10.570> unusual<00:03:10.810> when<00:03:11.320> you<00:03:11.440> hear<00:03:11.680> the<00:03:12.070> Gregorian

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:12.550 
very unusual when you hear the Gregorian

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:14.360 
very unusual when you hear the Gregorian
chant<00:03:12.880> and<00:03:13.090> then<00:03:13.210> it<00:03:13.300> starts<00:03:13.630> with<00:03:13.690> this

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
chant and then it starts with this

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.710 
chant and then it starts with this
grandeur<00:03:15.370> of<00:03:15.400> the<00:03:15.640> curious<00:03:16.240> something<00:03:16.570> like

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
grandeur of the curious something like

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.650 
grandeur of the curious something like
that<00:03:16.990> at<00:03:17.290> the<00:03:17.590> mass<00:03:17.800> the<00:03:17.830> space<00:03:18.280> yes<00:03:18.730> and<00:03:19.510> I

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
that at the mass the space yes and I

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.170 
that at the mass the space yes and I
think<00:03:19.720> it's<00:03:20.050> an<00:03:20.230> example<00:03:20.860> it<00:03:21.190> may<00:03:21.850> not<00:03:22.120> be

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
think it's an example it may not be

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.920 
think it's an example it may not be
exactly<00:03:22.950> everybody's<00:03:23.950> taste<00:03:24.330> but<00:03:25.330> there<00:03:25.810> is

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
exactly everybody's taste but there is

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 
we have to really have a mindset for

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.839 
we have to really have a mindset for
that<00:04:34.210> music<00:04:34.720> and<00:04:34.960> you<00:04:35.770> have<00:04:35.889> to<00:04:35.979> be<00:04:36.099> a<00:04:36.129> I<00:04:36.370> mean

00:04:38.249 --> 00:04:38.259 
if you don't like Mozart you probably

00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:40.409 
if you don't like Mozart you probably

00:04:42.819 --> 00:04:44.459 
loves months ago not that it's not that
way<00:04:42.969> through<00:04:43.120> actually<00:04:43.360> I<00:04:43.389> was<00:04:43.659> not<00:04:43.840> a<00:04:43.870> great

00:04:44.459 --> 00:04:44.469 
way through actually I was not a great

00:04:44.469 --> 00:04:47.700 
way through actually I was not a great
fan<00:04:44.710> of<00:04:44.770> Mozart<00:04:45.340> when<00:04:45.520> I<00:04:45.669> was<00:04:45.879> 20<00:04:46.840> or<00:04:46.960> 21<00:04:47.319> years

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:47.710 
fan of Mozart when I was 20 or 21 years

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:50.179 
fan of Mozart when I was 20 or 21 years
old<00:04:47.830> about<00:04:48.430> much<00:04:48.879> more<00:04:48.909> than<00:04:49.120> dramatic

00:04:50.179 --> 00:04:50.189 
old about much more than dramatic

00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:53.670 
old about much more than dramatic
romantic<00:04:51.189> pieces<00:04:52.000> and<00:04:52.210> then<00:04:52.389> I<00:04:52.750> found<00:04:53.169> most<00:04:53.500> of

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 
romantic pieces and then I found most of

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:58.520 
romantic pieces and then I found most of
them<00:04:53.860> later

00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:58.530 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:01.470 

usually<00:04:59.530> the<00:04:59.680> Sanctus<00:05:00.250> ends<00:05:00.730> with<00:05:00.940> a<00:05:00.970> rather

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:01.480 
usually the Sanctus ends with a rather

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:04.770 
usually the Sanctus ends with a rather
jubilant<00:05:02.169> awesome<00:05:03.160> ionic<00:05:03.520> charges<00:05:03.880> and<00:05:04.120> then

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:04.780 
jubilant awesome ionic charges and then

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:09.920 
jubilant awesome ionic charges and then
the<00:05:05.169> Benedictus<00:05:05.680> very<00:05:06.070> often<00:05:06.669> in<00:05:06.880> this

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:09.930 

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:12.200 

metaphysical<00:05:10.930> tone<00:05:11.560> I<00:05:11.590> mean<00:05:11.979> there's<00:05:12.160> a

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:12.210 
metaphysical tone I mean there's a

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:15.900 
metaphysical tone I mean there's a
adagio<00:05:13.210> s<00:05:13.870> perceive<00:05:14.440> or<00:05:14.710> so<00:05:14.979> of<00:05:15.160> course<00:05:15.610> that

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:15.910 
adagio s perceive or so of course that

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:17.879 
adagio s perceive or so of course that
only<00:05:16.120> makes<00:05:16.449> sense<00:05:16.750> because<00:05:17.139> it<00:05:17.470> was<00:05:17.650> written

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:17.889 
only makes sense because it was written

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:21.080 
only makes sense because it was written
to<00:05:18.280> be<00:05:18.790> performed<00:05:19.449> after<00:05:20.110> the<00:05:20.530> consecration

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:21.090 
to be performed after the consecration

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:24.510 
to be performed after the consecration
so<00:05:22.090> the<00:05:22.210> separation<00:05:22.840> of<00:05:22.990> the<00:05:23.310> Benedictus<00:05:24.310> and

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:24.520 
so the separation of the Benedictus and

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:28.350 
so the separation of the Benedictus and
Sanctus<00:05:25.000> is<00:05:25.990> something<00:05:26.740> that<00:05:27.160> the<00:05:27.910> music

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:28.360 
Sanctus is something that the music

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:39.300 
Sanctus is something that the music
simply<00:05:28.780> demands

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:39.310 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:41.370
