00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:12.730 

bottom<00:02:00.930> for<00:02:01.200> first

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:23.949 

right<00:02:15.080> on<00:02:16.080> the<00:02:16.260> top<00:02:18.860> and<00:02:20.090> bottom<00:02:21.890> that's<00:02:22.890> all

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:31.070 
right on the top and bottom that's all
let's<00:02:24.959> put<00:02:25.200> this<00:02:25.320> in<00:02:25.380> bond<00:02:26.690> that<00:02:27.709> believe<00:02:30.080> 100

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
let's put this in bond that believe 100

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:37.220 
let's put this in bond that believe 100
times<00:02:31.380> better<00:02:31.830> than<00:02:31.980> previous<00:02:32.730> one<00:02:36.080> from<00:02:37.080> the

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
times better than previous one from the

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.570 
times better than previous one from the
front<00:02:37.410> side<00:02:38.209> this<00:02:39.209> orange<00:02:39.660> colors<00:02:40.370> looks<00:02:41.370> like

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
front side this orange colors looks like

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.620 
front side this orange colors looks like
a<00:02:41.610> little<00:02:42.000> bit<00:02:42.150> reddish<00:02:43.250> brown<00:02:44.250> color<00:02:44.630> this

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
a little bit reddish brown color this

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:50.920 
a little bit reddish brown color this
you<00:02:46.410> know<00:02:46.500> light<00:02:47.160> reflect<00:02:47.820> from<00:02:49.040> disparate

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
you know light reflect from disparate

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:57.500 
you know light reflect from disparate
hmm<00:02:52.550> looks<00:02:53.550> like<00:02:53.640> a<00:02:53.940> total<00:02:54.630> share<00:02:55.140> Collins<00:02:56.510> but

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
hmm looks like a total share Collins but

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.620 
hmm looks like a total share Collins but
am<00:02:57.690> on<00:02:57.930> you<00:02:58.140> can<00:02:58.380> clearly<00:02:58.800> see<00:02:59.010> the<00:02:59.940> pattern<00:03:00.540> of

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
am on you can clearly see the pattern of

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:06.410 
am on you can clearly see the pattern of
it<00:03:01.160> or<00:03:02.160> so<00:03:02.700> I<00:03:02.730> told<00:03:03.600> you<00:03:03.950> that<00:03:04.950> my<00:03:05.820> quo<00:03:06.150> is

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
it or so I told you that my quo is

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.440 
it or so I told you that my quo is
perfectly<00:03:06.989> match<00:03:07.260> I<00:03:07.620> think<00:03:08.400> so<00:03:08.549> all<00:03:08.820> verizon

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
perfectly match I think so all verizon

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:16.130 
perfectly match I think so all verizon
all<00:03:11.750> carriers<00:03:12.750> versions<00:03:13.320> match<00:03:13.830> with<00:03:14.160> it<00:03:15.140> the

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
all carriers versions match with it the
