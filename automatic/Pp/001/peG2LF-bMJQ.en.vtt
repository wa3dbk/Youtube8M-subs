how<00:03:30.790> these<00:03:31.269> gates<00:03:31.629> are<00:03:31.840> opened<00:03:32.319> I'm<00:03:33.040> afraid<00:03:33.489> I

00:03:33.839 --> 00:03:33.849 
how these gates are opened I'm afraid I

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:38.429 
how these gates are opened I'm afraid I
do<00:03:34.090> not<00:03:34.449> know<00:03:35.669> however<00:03:36.669> the<00:03:37.180> Keyblade<00:03:37.900> will

attempting<00:04:22.270> to<00:04:22.449> link<00:04:22.780> these<00:04:23.050> dark<00:04:23.440> pathways

00:04:24.089 --> 00:04:24.099 
attempting to link these dark pathways

00:04:24.099 --> 00:04:27.480 
attempting to link these dark pathways
to<00:04:24.430> the<00:04:24.460> gates<00:04:24.820> between<00:04:25.180> the<00:04:25.630> worlds<00:04:26.490> yeah

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
to the gates between the worlds yeah

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:31.240 
to the gates between the worlds yeah
that's<00:04:28.060> fun

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:31.250 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:35.540
