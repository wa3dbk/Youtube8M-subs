a lot of light they use smell to get
around<00:00:42.540> they<00:00:42.809> use<00:00:43.140> it<00:00:43.320> to<00:00:43.410> find<00:00:43.620> each<00:00:43.739> other

around they use it to find each other
they<00:00:44.190> use<00:00:44.340> it<00:00:44.489> to<00:00:44.579> find<00:00:44.789> food<00:00:45.030> like<00:00:45.480> carcasses

they use it to find food like carcasses

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.540 
they use it to find food like carcasses
so<00:00:46.469> they<00:00:46.590> have<00:00:46.680> a<00:00:46.739> greatly<00:00:47.070> expanded

so they have a greatly expanded
olfactory<00:00:47.910> lobe<00:00:48.090> and<00:00:48.420> there's<00:00:48.840> a<00:00:48.899> lot<00:00:49.110> of

that<00:01:43.200> far<00:01:43.259> are<00:01:43.649> blue<00:01:43.950> and<00:01:44.240> they're<00:01:45.240> also

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
that far are blue and they're also

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.870 
that far are blue and they're also
bioluminescent<00:01:46.920> bacteria<00:01:46.950> that<00:01:47.579> are<00:01:47.700> blue

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
bioluminescent bacteria that are blue

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.060 
bioluminescent bacteria that are blue
that<00:01:47.909> are<00:01:48.180> often<00:01:48.509> found<00:01:48.659> on<00:01:48.930> decaying<00:01:49.649> food

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
that are often found on decaying food

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.100 
that are often found on decaying food
items<00:01:50.430> or<00:01:50.610> food<00:01:50.970> items<00:01:51.210> for<00:01:51.390> a<00:01:51.420> Nautilus<00:01:51.780> so<00:01:51.990> we

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
items or food items for a Nautilus so we

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.319 
items or food items for a Nautilus so we
thought<00:01:52.320> okay<00:01:53.009> why<00:01:53.610> don't<00:01:53.820> we<00:01:53.880> see<00:01:54.060> if<00:01:54.090> they

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
thought okay why don't we see if they

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:57.350 
thought okay why don't we see if they
can<00:01:54.479> associate<00:01:54.990> a<00:01:55.110> blue<00:01:55.470> light<00:01:55.710> with<00:01:56.610> the

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
can associate a blue light with the

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.109 
can associate a blue light with the
smell<00:01:57.570> of<00:01:57.719> food<00:01:57.899> and<00:01:58.530> so<00:01:59.520> what<00:01:59.670> we<00:01:59.759> did<00:01:59.909> was<00:02:00.090> we

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
smell of food and so what we did was we

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.030 
smell of food and so what we did was we
put<00:02:00.299> them<00:02:00.450> into<00:02:00.570> a<00:02:00.810> little<00:02:00.960> Nautilus<00:02:01.530> car<00:02:01.770> seat

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
put them into a little Nautilus car seat

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.249 
put them into a little Nautilus car seat
you<00:02:02.219> flashed<00:02:02.640> a<00:02:02.820> light<00:02:03.000> and<00:02:03.210> then<00:02:03.570> just<00:02:04.200> a

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
you flashed a light and then just a

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.709 
you flashed a light and then just a
second<00:02:04.619> later<00:02:04.799> we<00:02:05.520> released<00:02:05.939> some<00:02:06.090> odor<00:02:06.390> and

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
second later we released some odor and

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.690 
second later we released some odor and
then<00:02:07.140> we<00:02:07.770> wanted<00:02:08.039> to<00:02:08.099> see<00:02:08.190> did<00:02:08.399> they<00:02:08.520> learn

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
then we wanted to see did they learn

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.699 
then we wanted to see did they learn
that<00:02:09.060> blue<00:02:09.780> light<00:02:09.959> means<00:02:10.170> food<00:02:10.349> is<00:02:10.530> coming

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
that blue light means food is coming

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.740 
that blue light means food is coming
similar<00:02:11.610> study<00:02:11.910> maybe<00:02:12.150> will<00:02:12.420> ring

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
similar study maybe will ring

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.750 
similar study maybe will ring
now<00:02:12.870> so<00:02:13.260> this<00:02:13.590> conditioning<00:02:14.070> experiment<00:02:14.640> is

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
now so this conditioning experiment is

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:15.800 
now so this conditioning experiment is
very<00:02:14.970> much<00:02:15.120> like<00:02:15.270> what<00:02:15.450> they<00:02:15.570> did<00:02:15.690> with

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
very much like what they did with

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.390 
very much like what they did with
Pavlov's<00:02:16.170> dog<00:02:16.440> where<00:02:16.680> you<00:02:16.770> ring<00:02:16.950> a<00:02:17.010> bell<00:02:17.160> and<00:02:17.370> I

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
Pavlov's dog where you ring a bell and I

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.220 
Pavlov's dog where you ring a bell and I
meant<00:02:17.610> food<00:02:17.820> is<00:02:17.970> coming<00:02:18.210> the<00:02:18.600> dog<00:02:18.780> salivates

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
meant food is coming the dog salivates

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.110 
meant food is coming the dog salivates
and<00:02:19.770> then<00:02:20.070> after<00:02:20.310> a<00:02:20.340> while<00:02:20.370> all<00:02:20.790> you<00:02:20.910> have<00:02:21.030> to

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
and then after a while all you have to

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.250 
and then after a while all you have to
do<00:02:21.210> is<00:02:21.300> ring<00:02:21.450> the<00:02:21.480> bell<00:02:21.690> and<00:02:22.020> the<00:02:22.140> dog

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
do is ring the bell and the dog

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.440 
do is ring the bell and the dog
salivates<00:02:22.620> in<00:02:23.040> the<00:02:23.250> case<00:02:23.460> of<00:02:23.640> the<00:02:23.760> Nautilus<00:02:24.030> a

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
salivates in the case of the Nautilus a

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.720 
salivates in the case of the Nautilus a
nicole's<00:02:24.840> will<00:02:24.960> come<00:02:25.080> out<00:02:25.200> like<00:02:25.350> this<00:02:25.730> they

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
nicole's will come out like this they

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.010 
nicole's will come out like this they
say<00:02:26.880> oh<00:02:26.910> there's<00:02:27.270> food<00:02:27.450> around<00:02:27.570> somewhere

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
say oh there's food around somewhere

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.300 
say oh there's food around somewhere
food<00:02:28.200> around<00:02:28.440> somewhere<00:02:28.770> and<00:02:28.890> we<00:02:28.950> always<00:02:29.070> fed

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
food around somewhere and we always fed

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:30.800 
food around somewhere and we always fed
them<00:02:29.490> after<00:02:29.730> the<00:02:29.850> experiment<00:02:30.330> so<00:02:30.480> they<00:02:30.690> got

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
them after the experiment so they got

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.570 
them after the experiment so they got
their<00:02:30.930> food<00:02:31.110> but<00:02:31.470> we<00:02:31.560> tested<00:02:31.890> it<00:02:32.010> from<00:02:32.190> half<00:02:32.459> an

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
their food but we tested it from half an

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.900 
their food but we tested it from half an
hour

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
hour

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.270 
hour
up<00:02:33.090> to<00:02:33.209> 24<00:02:33.660> hours<00:02:33.690> later<00:02:34.170> and<00:02:34.470> so<00:02:35.010> what<00:02:35.160> we

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
up to 24 hours later and so what we

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.730 
up to 24 hours later and so what we
found<00:02:35.430> was<00:02:35.700> that<00:02:35.730> up<00:02:36.360> to<00:02:36.570> about<00:02:36.720> an<00:02:36.870> hour<00:02:37.020> if

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
found was that up to about an hour if

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.290 
found was that up to about an hour if
you<00:02:37.890> flash<00:02:38.130> a<00:02:38.160> light<00:02:38.430> at<00:02:38.610> them<00:02:38.760> their

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
you flash a light at them their

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:40.430 
you flash a light at them their
tentacles<00:02:39.540> come<00:02:39.840> out<00:02:39.959> like<00:02:40.080> where<00:02:40.290> is<00:02:40.380> he

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
tentacles come out like where is he

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.440 
tentacles come out like where is he
where's<00:02:40.800> my<00:02:40.980> food<00:02:41.340> reward<00:02:41.760> and<00:02:42.000> then<00:02:42.300> there's

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
where's my food reward and then there's

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.120 
where's my food reward and then there's
a<00:02:42.510> period<00:02:42.810> of<00:02:42.959> time<00:02:43.140> where<00:02:43.350> they<00:02:43.470> don't<00:02:43.650> react

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
a period of time where they don't react

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.570 
a period of time where they don't react
at<00:02:44.280> all

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
at all

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.580 
at all
after<00:02:44.910> an<00:02:45.180> hour<00:02:45.330> called<00:02:45.930> memory

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
after an hour called memory

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.920 
after an hour called memory
consolidation<00:02:47.150> where<00:02:48.150> the<00:02:48.300> Nautilus<00:02:48.750> is

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
consolidation where the Nautilus is

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.840 
consolidation where the Nautilus is
filing<00:02:49.560> the<00:02:49.650> memory<00:02:49.920> away<00:02:50.070> for<00:02:50.430> long<00:02:50.580> term<00:02:50.820> use

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
filing the memory away for long term use

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.990 
filing the memory away for long term use
and<00:02:51.390> then<00:02:51.570> finally<00:02:52.080> after<00:02:52.830> after<00:02:53.610> about<00:02:53.760> six

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
and then finally after after about six

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.580 
and then finally after after about six
hours<00:02:54.180> or<00:02:54.450> so<00:02:54.630> and<00:02:54.840> the<00:02:54.959> animals<00:02:55.260> started

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
hours or so and the animals started

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.050 
hours or so and the animals started
responding<00:02:55.920> again<00:02:56.340> at<00:02:56.459> the<00:02:56.550> expression<00:02:56.970> of

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
responding again at the expression of

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.610 
responding again at the expression of
long-term<00:02:57.270> memory<00:02:57.510> so<00:02:57.900> they<00:02:58.020> have<00:02:58.200> short-term

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
long-term memory so they have short-term

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.080 
long-term memory so they have short-term
memory<00:02:58.800> and<00:02:59.190> long-term<00:02:59.370> memory

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
memory and long-term memory

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:01.370 
memory and long-term memory
they<00:03:00.300> then<00:03:00.480> tested<00:03:00.930> to<00:03:01.020> see<00:03:01.050> if<00:03:01.260> this

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
they then tested to see if this

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.440 
they then tested to see if this
demonstration<00:03:02.100> of<00:03:02.190> learning<00:03:02.550> also<00:03:03.150> applied

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
demonstration of learning also applied

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.300 
demonstration of learning also applied
to<00:03:03.480> spatial<00:03:03.870> awareness<00:03:04.200> the<00:03:04.950> goal<00:03:05.130> was<00:03:05.280> for

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
to spatial awareness the goal was for

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.400 
to spatial awareness the goal was for
them<00:03:05.580> to<00:03:05.610> find<00:03:05.880> a<00:03:06.000> hole<00:03:06.239> that<00:03:06.660> led<00:03:06.930> to<00:03:06.959> deeper

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
them to find a hole that led to deeper

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.470 
them to find a hole that led to deeper
waters<00:03:07.800> we<00:03:08.130> trained<00:03:08.459> them<00:03:08.580> to<00:03:08.760> find<00:03:09.000> it<00:03:09.180> put

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
waters we trained them to find it put

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:10.729 
waters we trained them to find it put
them<00:03:09.600> into<00:03:09.720> the<00:03:09.870> maze<00:03:10.050> when<00:03:10.320> they<00:03:10.380> hadn't<00:03:10.680> been

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
them into the maze when they hadn't been
