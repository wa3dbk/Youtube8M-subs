 I'm going to show you an important part 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.410
 important thing that is for history 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:50.480
 of zombies that is this relationship there 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.429

 put in the water we can swim in 

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:02.030
 multiplayer already in black ops 3 is a 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:04.159
 last as you see the water as you see 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:07.370
 those bubbles how can we submerge 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:10.520
 swim and with a lot of agility we can not go 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:13.280
 we are not going slow we are super agile the 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.190
 movements are very fast returns another 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.040
 time 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:19.320
 black ops' in the pure state my friends 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.850
 all the clues all the clues that 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.790
 they took us from the story of zombies 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.470
 they took us to a map on the water in the 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.290
 Verdú wall that was drawn with 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:31.200
 that shark letter and that sea those waves 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.210
 then look here now in multiplayer 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.460
 for the first time we have this we can 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.670
 we have the possibility to swim what 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:42.840
 means therefore that this is a 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:46.020
 Biggest track one more giant step 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.480
 towards that possible zombie map that 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.610
 we can be under the submerged water that 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:53.250
 we can swim that we can be 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.470
 making a stress that is a map 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.840
 important in the history underwater and 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.180

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.410
 we saw there but we were left with this map of 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.500
 multiplayer in which we can 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:13.940
