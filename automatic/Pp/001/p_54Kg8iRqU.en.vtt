00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
threw up and downs which is totally

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.310 
threw up and downs which is totally
normal<00:03:32.340> so<00:03:33.000> when<00:03:33.150> a<00:03:33.180> down<00:03:33.450> period<00:03:33.690> comes<00:03:34.080> and

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:34.320 
normal so when a down period comes and

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:35.780 
normal so when a down period comes and
maybe<00:03:34.470> I<00:03:34.560> leave<00:03:34.770> him<00:03:34.890> out<00:03:35.010> of<00:03:35.040> roster<00:03:35.610> that's

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
maybe I leave him out of roster that's

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.580 
maybe I leave him out of roster that's
not<00:03:35.940> at<00:03:36.000> the<00:03:36.060> end<00:03:36.120> of<00:03:36.270> the<00:03:36.390> world<00:03:36.540> so<00:03:37.200> but<00:03:37.470> it

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
not at the end of the world so but it

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.199 
not at the end of the world so but it
also<00:03:37.800> is<00:03:38.010> a<00:03:38.040> little<00:03:38.340> signal<00:03:38.520> hate<00:03:38.850> you<00:03:39.090> know

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
also is a little signal hate you know

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:40.670 
also is a little signal hate you know
Josie<00:03:39.570> maybe<00:03:39.780> there<00:03:39.989> was<00:03:40.110> something<00:03:40.350> that<00:03:40.500> we

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
Josie maybe there was something that we

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.770 
Josie maybe there was something that we
didn't<00:03:40.920> like<00:03:41.040> before<00:03:41.520> so<00:03:42.060> now<00:03:42.239> we<00:03:42.300> can<00:03:42.540> catch

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
didn't like before so now we can catch

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.060 
didn't like before so now we can catch
up<00:03:42.989> and<00:03:43.230> and<00:03:43.560> and<00:03:44.270> and<00:03:45.270> and<00:03:45.750> see<00:03:46.680> how<00:03:46.920> it<00:03:47.040> goes

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.070 
up and and and and and see how it goes

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:49.610 
up and and and and and see how it goes
goes<00:03:47.700> on<00:03:48.030> then<00:03:48.270> I<00:03:48.450> think<00:03:48.900> we<00:03:48.989> can<00:03:49.110> take<00:03:49.290> a<00:03:49.350> lot<00:03:49.560> a

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
goes on then I think we can take a lot a

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.100 
goes on then I think we can take a lot a
lot<00:03:49.860> of<00:03:50.010> positives<00:03:50.459> from<00:03:50.610> this<00:03:50.850> year<00:03:51.209> um<00:03:51.390> it's

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.110 
lot of positives from this year um it's

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:56.510 
lot of positives from this year um it's
been<00:03:52.340> very<00:03:53.340> successful<00:03:53.550> year<00:03:54.290> but<00:03:55.290> also<00:03:55.890> a

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
you know we have a bit of a different

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:06.220
