00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:13.590
 we help in inter and I was already 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.049
 talking to you about the redhead 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.090
 mysterious author cleiton 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.520
 I received this type of partnership from 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.710
 universe of books and I did not know that 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.960
 if it was the I asked him practically 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.670
 so from the catalog looking through the cover and 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.710
 by the synopsis that I found legal 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.279
 and then I did not know he had a 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.350
 strong footprint yes it 's great it's good for the 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.630
 side of the gray ones out there 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.860
 so I had no concept and it's not a 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.110
 genre that I usually wear law 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.600
 so I stayed like this after page 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.870
 70 80 so I got my start 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.629
 I stay not know it was right on it 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:52.140
 but in the end I really liked the 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:56.010
 book because I ended up giving 4 4 stars 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.989
 in the dark because it is the construction of 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.629
 narrative of the plot and the characters 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.699
 very good very deep so I ended up 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.909
 really enjoying the story the story 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:08.189
 of this book is talking about a woman already 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:12.479
 its 33 thirties call 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:15.420
 Grace and only her life is to be famous. 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:18.420
 she is an actress she sings also only as 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.400
 She's too old for that to start. 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.439
 to start her career she finishes 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.570
 discouraging her a little she does others 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.520
 courses and ends up working with another 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.530
 Another thing is how to freelancer 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.689
 only she has a friend of mine. 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.869
 friend leaves the college that's called 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:36.659
 rolim and roni she will get you actors 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:39.180

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.250
 she started getting very famous in 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:46.530
 career then embrace she resolves to live 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.120
 with the family in los angeles and then 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.250
 again 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:52.290
 tests for some papers to see if 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.120
 finally she can not even perform 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.610
 This dream wanted to be famous and actress. 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:02:00.240
 in los angeles she ends up knowing the 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:04.080
 Jack is already Milton who is one of the actors is 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:06.390
 that her friend who runs the agency and 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:09.030
 where is he about to stay? 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.950
 very famous because he will act there is 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.530
 play a very important role in the film 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:16.500
 is that it is based on a book called 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.690
 time is so it will get very famous 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.210
 there are a lot of people so many girls 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.970
 around him and he is very young he has 24 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:28.080
 years and water itself and he simply 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:31.980
 so it is because chemistry it finds itself 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:35.760
 and can not play more and in this way 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:39.900
 It all ends up doing a lot of tests to 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:41.250
 some theater roles in films and she 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.840
 is hoping to achieve a 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.740
 very important role that will change the 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.410
 her life 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:47.520
 only to get this role so that 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.460
 everything works, she's going to have to move 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:53.190
 to new york and her relationship 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:55.350
 with jack is starting is engaged and she 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.239
 Do not know what to do and have all this 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:00.300
 also question her being older than 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:02.010
 it her all neurotic means receiving days 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:05.040
 so this book has a lot of humor 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:08.370
 because of this theme in her 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:10.500
 old that a peace but so is beyond this 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.390
 has many other things that 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.030
 end up making the book a lot of fun 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:16.650
 very good humored and that was I think 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:20.370
 I liked this book better 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:22.500
 in this sense of humor is 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:26.130
 middle-aged woman already know 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:28.440
 finally hopeless but trying to resume 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:30.090
 life this is also a song 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.930
 Beautiful, that's why I have four 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.480
 stars 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:36.510
 now talking a little bit about this little 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:39.239
 erotic and I do not particularly like 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:41.790
 of this genre I do not usually read but in this 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:44.400
 The book is that I did not find it so heavy. 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:46.290
 sinicon judge how much I expected 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.000
 maybe it was not 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.760
 I did not get so scared I think I just 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.860
 so well I started like I did not know 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.260
 that he treated it like this 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:57.630
 I started to read when it came to these 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.640
 because it's a bit like that, I'm lost in 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:02.549
 bottom I believe it is for the victory here is 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:04.950
 fbi this is because really the house 

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:07.079
 by the synopsis so I would not say I did not 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:09.570
 I came to review or sell resende 

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:11.220
 no one expected it free but at the end of 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:12.780
 I really liked the accounts so I guess 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:15.690
 for those who like this theme 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:18.389
 genius also who likes one with 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:19.850
