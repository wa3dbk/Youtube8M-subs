00:02:04.349 --> 00:02:04.359 
you this goes on top of your fermenter

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:08.580 
you this goes on top of your fermenter
it<00:02:05.079> keeps<00:02:05.979> air<00:02:06.280> from<00:02:06.670> going<00:02:06.999> inside<00:02:07.840> but

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
it keeps air from going inside but

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.650 
it keeps air from going inside but
allows<00:02:09.069> the<00:02:09.460> carbon<00:02:09.850> dioxide<00:02:10.420> during

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
allows the carbon dioxide during

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.470 
allows the carbon dioxide during
fermentation<00:02:10.960> to<00:02:11.620> escape<00:02:12.130> I<00:02:12.600> like<00:02:13.600> this<00:02:14.200> style

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
fermentation to escape I like this style

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.980 
fermentation to escape I like this style
versus<00:02:16.480> something<00:02:17.470> of<00:02:17.650> this<00:02:18.010> type<00:02:18.720> you'll<00:02:19.720> see

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:19.990 
versus something of this type you'll see

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:22.860 
versus something of this type you'll see
them<00:02:20.080> both<00:02:20.490> this<00:02:21.490> one<00:02:21.670> just<00:02:21.970> like<00:02:22.300> it<00:02:22.360> better<00:02:22.569> I

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
them both this one just like it better I

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.309 
them both this one just like it better I
think<00:02:23.350> it's<00:02:23.470> easier<00:02:23.800> to<00:02:23.950> clean<00:02:25.290> along<00:02:26.290> with

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:26.319 
think it's easier to clean along with

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:28.800 
think it's easier to clean along with
that<00:02:26.530> you're<00:02:27.220> going<00:02:27.340> to<00:02:27.430> need<00:02:27.580> a<00:02:27.790> brush<00:02:28.540> that

this<00:02:49.599> little<00:02:49.989> piece<00:02:50.200> is<00:02:50.410> what<00:02:51.010> is<00:02:51.130> used<00:02:51.310> for

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
this little piece is what is used for

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.510 
this little piece is what is used for
that<00:02:51.790> it<00:02:52.599> has<00:02:52.780> a<00:02:52.810> valve<00:02:53.260> at<00:02:53.470> the<00:02:53.530> bottom<00:02:53.980> so<00:02:54.160> you

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:54.520 
that it has a valve at the bottom so you

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.300 
that it has a valve at the bottom so you
slide<00:02:55.030> it<00:02:55.209> into<00:02:55.420> a<00:02:55.660> bottle<00:02:56.140> when<00:02:56.680> it<00:02:56.830> reaches

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
slide it into a bottle when it reaches

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.090 
slide it into a bottle when it reaches
the<00:02:57.430> bottom<00:02:57.580> of<00:02:57.760> the<00:02:57.850> bottle<00:02:58.150> it<00:02:58.330> opens<00:02:59.170> up<00:02:59.410> the

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
the bottom of the bottle it opens up the

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.030 
the bottom of the bottle it opens up the
valve<00:03:00.340> allowing<00:03:01.120> it<00:03:01.450> to<00:03:01.480> fill<00:03:01.959> this<00:03:02.680> keeps

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
valve allowing it to fill this keeps

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.540 
valve allowing it to fill this keeps
oxygen<00:03:03.910> out<00:03:04.120> of<00:03:04.269> your<00:03:05.140> brew<00:03:05.440> so<00:03:06.130> it<00:03:06.280> stays

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:06.550 
oxygen out of your brew so it stays

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:12.120 
oxygen out of your brew so it stays
better<00:03:09.030> you<00:03:10.030> will<00:03:10.150> have<00:03:10.330> to<00:03:10.450> have<00:03:10.800> caps<00:03:11.800> and

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130 
better you will have to have caps and

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:16.440 
better you will have to have caps and
most<00:03:12.519> kits<00:03:12.790> come<00:03:13.120> with<00:03:13.150> about<00:03:13.530> 144<00:03:14.530> caps<00:03:14.980> and<00:03:15.450> a

understand<00:04:06.730> why<00:04:06.940> we<00:04:07.150> can<00:04:07.329> use<00:04:07.540> this<00:04:07.870> so<00:04:08.739> we've

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:08.950 
understand why we can use this so we've

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:12.259

set<00:06:03.800> me<00:06:03.949> off<00:06:03.979> with<00:06:04.400> dry<00:06:05.210> yeast<00:06:05.539> which<00:06:06.289> works

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:06.590 
set me off with dry yeast which works

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:09.250 
set me off with dry yeast which works
just<00:06:06.889> fine<00:06:07.510> particularly<00:06:08.510> for<00:06:08.570> your<00:06:08.930> first
