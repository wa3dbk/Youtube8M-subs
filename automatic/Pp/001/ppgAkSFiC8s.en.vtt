out<00:00:49.540> of<00:00:49.600> this<00:00:49.750> format<00:00:50.199> like<00:00:50.379> I<00:00:50.470> said<00:00:50.650> we're

00:00:50.759 --> 00:00:50.769 
out of this format like I said we're

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:51.899 
out of this format like I said we're
going<00:00:50.890> to<00:00:50.949> be<00:00:51.010> mixing<00:00:51.309> it<00:00:51.430> up<00:00:51.519> with<00:00:51.580> major

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:51.909 
going to be mixing it up with major

00:00:51.909 --> 00:00:53.460 
going to be mixing it up with major
minor<00:00:52.239> scales<00:00:52.629> you'll<00:00:52.900> notice<00:00:53.170> that<00:00:53.199> we<00:00:53.350> have

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:53.470 
minor scales you'll notice that we have

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:55.350 
minor scales you'll notice that we have
the<00:00:53.559> five-string<00:00:54.159> out<00:00:54.309> this<00:00:54.820> doesn't<00:00:55.239> show

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:55.360 
the five-string out this doesn't show

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.630 
the five-string out this doesn't show
the<00:00:55.390> dots<00:00:55.780> but<00:00:56.110> if<00:00:56.229> you<00:00:56.350> solve<00:00:56.710> the<00:00:56.769> previous

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:57.640 
the dots but if you solve the previous

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.399 
the dots but if you solve the previous
videos<00:00:58.000> you<00:00:58.479> already<00:00:58.659> know<00:00:58.870> what's<00:00:59.080> going<00:00:59.290> on

00:00:59.399 --> 00:00:59.409 
videos you already know what's going on

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:07.410

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420 
so really quick major scale of G go down

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:12.170 
so really quick major scale of G go down
a<00:01:07.450> hole
