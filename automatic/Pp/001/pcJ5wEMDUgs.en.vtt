 and if you want to buy the whole thing 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.540
 then you go to nick software.com there 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.309
 you find in the demo version and you 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.670

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.960
 this filter namely the hdr efex pro 2 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.200
 Let's go right after that 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.200
 intro 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.989
 yes i have this in photoshop again 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.370
 picture opens from the photokina and us 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:01.430
 Now we want to look at how we do that 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:03.530
 turn here into a hdr hatch 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.180
 with this filter from the google with 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.690
 We will do the collection again 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:11.840
 a new level with apple j and walk 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:14.390
 These can be in a smart object around you 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.190
 So all filters of this collection as 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.080
 Martha Weg uses it at any time 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:21.440
 can return and again something 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:23.750
 hdr efex pro 2 can change that 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:27.170
 we have click on the filters 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:29.030
 collection opens and the whole is 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:32.060
 rebuilt on the 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:34.460
 left side have all presets that is 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.710
 the whole comes with some 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.990
 different presets you 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.869
 you can easily select some here 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.009
 good, some less good 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:46.729
 and you have the possibility here too 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:49.130
 to the right of things to be determined by 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:51.289
 hand what you like in the end 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:54.920
 Wanted it is still very dull 

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:57.020
 the contrast arm that means I would 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:00.800
 here in any case still contrast 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:02.479
 Add that and you can do that here 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:05.599
 do everything by hand 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:08.899
 but I would like to have a filter here 

00:02:05.599 --> 00:02:11.750
 select in the area of ​​the group 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:14.060
 realistic like it now only 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.640
 times quite well here this deep one to 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.450
 Let's click on the whole regulator 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.040
 customized 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.250
 So it's nothing but one 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.750
 storing this regulator setting 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.400
 which I do not like now 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.370
 down here the area with this 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.590
 vignette and now I would like to 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.250
 just here a selective adjustments 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.720
 carry out 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.000
 namely the so-called youporn 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.670
 technology that is called click once 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.120
 here in this area with this 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:42.950
 checkpoint rhine pull us then 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.840
 this regulator has a radius here in 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:48.980
 where the change should take effect 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:51.560
 how different that something else and 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:54.140
 can now here with this point 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.640
 all this just here 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.880
 I would like to carry out the adjustments 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.410
 Exposure like to lift something and you 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.980
 See, that works fine here 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:06.980
 that was a tick too much 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:10.700
 so i think that suits that and i want to 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:15.760
 also like here the white point something 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:18.920
 lift and the black point also 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.420
 so and I like that one is already 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.550
 Of course we can do it now 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:25.640
 here are several other adjustments 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:28.569
 but make that I think is obligatory 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:30.590
 and is completely logical 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:33.739
 You can then also different here 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:36.560
 apply other effects to the picture like 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:40.340
 for example vignette or a neutral one 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:42.170
 filled the levels and curse so 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.239
 Here's how a coalition curve can be 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:45.530
 adjust here 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:49.730
 everything is in this preset finds 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:51.950
 saved and so you can do this here 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:53.569
 then you can do the whole picture 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:55.160
 try a nice fathers 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:57.920
 put together and if you something 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:00.560
 you like the whole thing too 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:02.120
 of course, save user-defined 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.209
 here in your favorites 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.799
 We confirm the whole is ok 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:09.410
 and you will see after all this 

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:12.910
 calculated you will find then synonymous 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:16.310
 this filter at level 1 here 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:17.600
 displayed as a smart object so that 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:20.359
 So we double click 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.829
 this entry at any time in the filter 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:25.660
 can return and again 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:27.830
 could make adjustments 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:30.110
 Of course you have the ones here, too 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:32.600
 possibility then with a brush on 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:35.630
 this masked to work and you 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:38.570
 Old areas of the origin professional 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:41.500
 just to fade in here again 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:44.479
 to selectively apply the filter 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:46.970
 yes it should have been from this 

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:48.410
 hdr efex pro 2 filters as I said though 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:49.760
 you also filter something to the others 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:52.310
 just want to see it click above 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:54.740
 you can see it on the link 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:56.389
 as I said for review video and 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:58.700
 You can also fall on everyone else 

00:04:56.389 --> 00:05:01.310
 access to when you video this one 

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:03.729

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:06.830
 I like the video 

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:08.660
 and of course do not forget the channel 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:10.610
 Subscribing may also help 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:12.380
 video on facebook and I'm happy 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:13.520
