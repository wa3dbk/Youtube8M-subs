I<00:02:44.890> always<00:02:45.040> get<00:02:45.310> questions<00:02:45.790> why<00:02:46.420> I<00:02:46.450> like<00:02:46.840> to<00:02:46.990> use

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
I always get questions why I like to use

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.560 
I always get questions why I like to use
unsalted<00:02:47.620> butter<00:02:47.770> because<00:02:48.340> I<00:02:48.550> use<00:02:48.730> salt

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
unsalted butter because I use salt

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.720 
unsalted butter because I use salt
anyway<00:02:49.930> in<00:02:50.110> my<00:02:50.200> recipes<00:02:50.680> and<00:02:50.890> that's<00:02:51.340> because

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
anyway in my recipes and that's because

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.990 
anyway in my recipes and that's because
salted<00:02:52.510> butter<00:02:52.780> is<00:02:53.050> really<00:02:53.890> really<00:02:54.190> salty

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
salted butter is really really salty

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.690 
salted butter is really really salty
so<00:02:55.330> by<00:02:55.900> always<00:02:56.320> using<00:02:56.680> unsalted<00:02:57.010> butter<00:02:57.250> and

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
so by always using unsalted butter and

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.020 
so by always using unsalted butter and
me<00:02:58.180> adding<00:02:58.750> insult<00:02:59.290> always<00:03:00.010> control<00:03:00.460> how<00:03:00.880> much

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
me adding insult always control how much

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.120 
me adding insult always control how much
salt<00:03:01.090> goes<00:03:01.540> into<00:03:01.750> my<00:03:01.840> baking<00:03:02.350> and<00:03:02.620> my<00:03:02.710> savory

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
salt goes into my baking and my savory

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:05.250 
salt goes into my baking and my savory
dishes<00:03:03.310> so<00:03:03.880> that's<00:03:04.090> why<00:03:04.300> I<00:03:04.570> choose<00:03:05.050> to<00:03:05.230> use

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
dishes so that's why I choose to use

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.920 
dishes so that's why I choose to use
unsalted<00:03:05.980> butter<00:03:06.190> always<00:03:06.910> so<00:03:07.540> I'm<00:03:07.690> going<00:03:07.840> to

dunk again and I know it seems like a

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:09.450 
dunk again and I know it seems like a
bit<00:06:06.820> of<00:06:06.849> a<00:06:06.970> procedure<00:06:07.389> but<00:06:07.919> that's<00:06:08.919> just<00:06:09.250> the

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:09.460 
bit of a procedure but that's just the

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:12.540

way it's done and you really should wait

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:14.190 
way it's done and you really should wait
till<00:06:12.729> it<00:06:12.820> cool<00:06:13.060> bit<00:06:13.270> more<00:06:13.510> but<00:06:13.720> as<00:06:13.870> you<00:06:14.050> know
