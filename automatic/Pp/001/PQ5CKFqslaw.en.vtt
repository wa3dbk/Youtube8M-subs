background<00:00:45.480> color<00:00:51.500> you<00:00:52.500> can<00:00:52.649> take<00:00:52.860> a<00:00:52.890> break<00:00:53.100> it

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
background color you can take a break it

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.439 
background color you can take a break it
kind<00:00:53.699> of<00:00:53.760> helps<00:00:54.030> move<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.300> color<00:00:54.690> around<00:00:55.309> and

00:00:56.439 --> 00:00:56.449 
kind of helps move the color around and

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:01.090 
kind of helps move the color around and
push<00:00:57.449> it<00:00:57.660> into<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:58.469> paper<00:00:59.100> mache<00:00:59.550> letters

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100 
push it into the paper mache letters

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.509 
push it into the paper mache letters
back<00:01:02.100> and<00:01:02.250> forth<00:01:02.550> here<00:01:03.149> I<00:01:04.010> take<00:01:05.010> a<00:01:05.040> little<00:01:05.280> bit

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
back and forth here I take a little bit

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.570 
back and forth here I take a little bit
of<00:01:05.580> time<00:01:05.880> to<00:01:06.119> dry<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.720> more<00:01:07.229> you<00:01:07.409> use<00:01:07.580> because

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
of time to dry the more you use because

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.609 
of time to dry the more you use because
remember<00:01:09.000> there's<00:01:09.450> no<00:01:09.689> such<00:01:09.930> thing<00:01:09.960> as<00:01:10.350> too

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
remember there's no such thing as too

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.350 
remember there's no such thing as too
much<00:01:12.170> okay<00:01:13.170> just<00:01:14.040> keep<00:01:14.250> adding<00:01:14.549> until<00:01:14.820> you<00:01:15.180> get

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
much okay just keep adding until you get

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.020 
much okay just keep adding until you get
the<00:01:15.540> intensity<00:01:16.259> of<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.470> color<00:01:16.590> you<00:01:16.979> want<00:01:17.189> we

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
the intensity of the color you want we

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.170 
the intensity of the color you want we
want<00:01:18.210> to<00:01:18.299> keep<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.600> background<00:01:19.080> fairly<00:01:19.770> light

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180 
want to keep the background fairly light

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:27.499 
want to keep the background fairly light
so<00:01:21.180> that<00:01:21.509> way<00:01:22.290> you<00:01:24.830> add<00:01:25.830> your<00:01:26.520> glimmer<00:01:26.850> screen

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
so that way you add your glimmer screen

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.270 
so that way you add your glimmer screen
which<00:01:28.140> we're<00:01:28.350> going<00:01:28.500> to<00:01:28.560> do<00:01:28.740> next<00:01:30.259> it<00:01:31.259> shows<00:01:32.100> up

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
which we're going to do next it shows up

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.270 
which we're going to do next it shows up
really<00:01:32.520> nicely<00:01:33.229> using<00:01:34.229> a<00:01:34.290> darker<00:01:34.650> color<00:01:34.890> over

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
really nicely using a darker color over

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
really nicely using a darker color over
the<00:01:35.400> top

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:49.300 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.600 

I<00:01:49.360> like<00:01:50.020> to<00:01:50.050> just<00:01:50.320> kind<00:01:50.620> of<00:01:50.680> blood<00:01:50.980> off<00:01:51.160> the<00:01:51.400> big

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610

I like to just kind of blood off the big
cooled<00:01:51.940> areas<00:01:52.570> and<00:01:52.810> it<00:01:52.930> cuts<00:01:53.200> down<00:01:53.440> on<00:01:53.650> the

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
cooled areas and it cuts down on the

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:00.120 
cooled areas and it cuts down on the
drying<00:01:55.630> time<00:01:58.290> okay<00:01:59.290> so<00:01:59.350> now<00:01:59.620> we<00:01:59.770> have<00:01:59.890> a<00:01:59.920> nice
