then the app will work the third thing

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.270 
then the app will work the third thing
is<00:00:56.879> you<00:00:57.360> need<00:00:57.480> to<00:00:57.510> make<00:00:57.629> sure<00:00:57.960> that<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.680> TV<00:00:59.100> is

that the TV is connected to otherwise it

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.530 
that the TV is connected to otherwise it
won't<00:01:10.770> recognize<00:01:11.130> it<00:01:11.159> okay<00:01:12.060> so<00:01:12.240> let's<00:01:12.390> jump

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
won't recognize it okay so let's jump

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.210 
won't recognize it okay so let's jump
into<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.869> market<00:01:13.020> and<00:01:13.290> to<00:01:13.710> look<00:01:13.860> for<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.100> app

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:16.180 
but since like that's 3d built I'm like

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.180 
but since like that's 3d built I'm like
right<00:03:16.450> yeah<00:03:17.290> there's<00:03:17.530> a<00:03:17.590> there's<00:03:17.799> about<00:03:18.159> a

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
right yeah there's a there's about a

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:19.830 
right yeah there's a there's about a
half<00:03:18.400> a<00:03:18.489> second<00:03:18.819> time<00:03:18.970> lag<00:03:19.180> that's<00:03:19.480> due<00:03:19.599> to<00:03:19.720> the

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
half a second time lag that's due to the

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.350 
half a second time lag that's due to the
network<00:03:20.110> connection<00:03:20.440> obviously<00:03:20.620> if<00:03:21.040> you<00:03:21.129> have

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:21.360 
network connection obviously if you have

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.699 
network connection obviously if you have
the<00:03:22.360> the<00:03:22.659> faster<00:03:22.989> the<00:03:23.080> network<00:03:23.349> connection

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
the the faster the network connection

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:25.710 
the the faster the network connection
you<00:03:23.799> have<00:03:23.980> the<00:03:24.760> shorter<00:03:25.060> the<00:03:25.180> lag<00:03:25.330> time<00:03:25.360> it

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
you have the shorter the lag time it

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.449 
you have the shorter the lag time it
will<00:03:25.840> be<00:03:25.989> but<00:03:26.379> as<00:03:26.500> you<00:03:26.650> can<00:03:26.799> see<00:03:27.010> it's<00:03:27.340> a

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
will be but as you can see it's a

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:30.479
