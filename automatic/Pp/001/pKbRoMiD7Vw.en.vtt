00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:09.559
 ten things that you consider as a rogue 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:11.090
 should congratulation with the 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:13.970
 Character creation is the way to go 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:15.860
 successful villains of the script 

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:17.660
 video with linkin park music and 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:18.860
 black and white intro soon on the 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.230
 download servers to find this world 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:21.890
 is already almost entirely 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.290
 paved 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:26.300
 but really to creme de la creme 

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:29.540
 to belong to it is ten points too 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:31.730
 First of all , pay attention to shock in general 

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:32.450
 and you in particular are arttu and b 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:33.980
 Possibly 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.780
 therefore the name should be one 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.809
 combination of the following words exist 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:41.899
 may if envy shadow killer master 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:43.339
 devil's island or ss in there on 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:44.719
 commercial wow server 

00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:46.160
 stupidly common all 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:47.960
 combinations of these words already 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.920
 forgiven are also doing a wrong one 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:54.199
 spell-wise leeds peak or ax songs 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:56.059
 second, you are damage dealer ergo 

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:57.769
 The trainer only buys skills 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:59.390
 the damages make kipling breaks 

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:01.820
 example is for girls and takes place 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:04.070
 if I'm liter at all 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:07.010
 anyway, everything you have in the maximum case 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:09.009
 in two strikes but only if 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:12.079
 it is elite and four levels above that 

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:14.630
 Third, your skill is the best 

00:01:12.079 --> 00:01:15.590
 point you in rogue forum and 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.390
 ask for opinions 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.850
 if someone is not your opinion for 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.290
 him or his mother generally helpful 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.509
 is the following rule of thumb 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.430
 each of a higher level or pvp 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:27.469
 Fight as you had a hard-core receiver 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:30.979
 everyone including 1 kapmug anyway 

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:33.439
 no fourth place if you agree 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:35.149
 deigns any respective clubs 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:36.590
 in instances with a highly holy one 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:37.969
 presence is to be happy 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.920
 anyway times all sloot so 

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:42.079
 that you can use and that is true 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.939
 also for green trousers of the whale 

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:45.770
 Furthermore, all have to the 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:47.619
 to hold instructions even if 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.969
 you have never been this instance 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:52.310
 important note if you are with 

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:53.990
 primitive cold blood ambush of the day 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:57.259
 the preparation-carbon placebos crete 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.520
 kocin should be the tank guilt come 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:00.079
 not on the idea now if it is too 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.060
 use that you need for that 

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:03.469
 next ambush infight what gives 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.359
 finally healer but what do a lot 

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:08.780
 money 5 

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:11.120
 everyone wants to know your kriz the only one 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.560
 valid communication form to communicate 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.160
 chris starts with either the 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.590
 traffic sale or order the grid then 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.890
 and 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.360
 again with many beginners 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.670
 just forgot her in often 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.300
 Report a critic via teamspeak no 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.550
 wrong shy 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:30.180
 By the way, there is also a scrolling page 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:32.190
 Stand alone six blocks in wow them 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.319
 not only funny out of it they stand on the 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.819
 utility scale whose upper end you 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.629
 Of course , you still represent yourself 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:38.910
 available 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:40.500
 blogs are there called a well 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.010
 to do and soul stones on you 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.760
 put 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:47.220
 remember her seventh regularly 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.780
 if any of this guy parnaz 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.430
 someone come up with the familiar idea 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:52.920
 should give the blessing of the rescue 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:55.200
 the ass feast has improved blessings 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.120
 it makes the bottom of the bargaining 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.190
 base otherwise to the trainer and 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.569
 adjust 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:03.299
 Eighth, you can not do it often enough 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:05.040
 say only use this applies to 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:08.069
 a given amount of energy iks the 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:10.769
 maximum harm y generate kick does it 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:12.599
 not and should not blind you too 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:14.640
 anyone after any 

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:16.280
 crude luke talents such as in checks 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.989
 sap questions, you just answer 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:23.220
 mittelalter your mother that applies in 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:24.750
 process no formula in wow is like that 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.180
 reliably a feeling again 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.130
 Allow yourself a value like 50 percent 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.209
 chance does not fool him 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:32.790
 would only be in half of all cases 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:35.250
 Quitten for any discussion too 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:37.769
 the subject of pvp tactics is your attacks 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.959
 third, almost always if that 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:40.650
 Anyone else should be down 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:41.880
 to play 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.950
 By the way, that helps too 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.660
 tactical discussions are your opponents 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.760
 dead after a maximum of ten seconds 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:50.190
 including dev teams with schillers 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.410
 dance &amp; life win gm via ambush 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:54.540
 baxter baxter or despite that 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:56.010
 Thaksin is also just tactics of 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.410
 People simply do not plan 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:00.030
 have how to do right harm and 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:02.840
 about elvis great below 4k 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:05.760
 we do not discuss thermally here 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:08.370
 each class in the pvp longer than 50 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.319
 frames living against you is in cash and you 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.060
 only your absolutely elitist 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:14.609
 due to the game, because of the fight 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:16.410
 yet the rogue important win 

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:17.549
 class is from the principle of all others 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:19.590
 hopelessly inferior 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:21.870
 it is only your sublimity that you are in 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:24.330
 makes pvp playable at all and anyway 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:26.039
 new blizzard what are you actually paying for 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:28.229
 13 euro a month if your class the 

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:30.129
 the only one she constantly gets annoyed is maria 

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:32.139
 make default 10 k 

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:34.449
 instant piero blaster ideas have 90 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:35.860
 worried and palas three signs in a row 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:37.529
 for the whole party and everyone can 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.239
 lend five minutes to the team 

00:04:37.529 --> 00:04:41.739
 if you can observe these ten points 

00:04:40.239 --> 00:04:43.749
 nothing more can go wrong 

00:04:41.739 --> 00:04:46.139
 Have fun with a rogue 

00:04:43.749 --> 00:04:46.139
