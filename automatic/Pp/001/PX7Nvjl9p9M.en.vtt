that is same color here now you could do

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.770 
that is same color here now you could do
one<00:01:28.470> of<00:01:28.560> two<00:01:28.680> things<00:01:28.710> you<00:01:29.280> could<00:01:29.400> either<00:01:29.780> if

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
one of two things you could either if

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:31.969 
one of two things you could either if
you're<00:01:30.930> gonna<00:01:31.049> plan<00:01:31.380> on<00:01:31.530> having<00:01:31.740> any

you're gonna plan on having any
animation<00:01:32.640> with<00:01:32.790> tie<00:01:33.090> inside<00:01:33.540> here<00:01:34.070> then<00:01:35.070> you

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
animation with tie inside here then you

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.359 
animation with tie inside here then you
could<00:01:35.369> just<00:01:35.400> go<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:35.790> duplicate<00:01:36.210> again<00:01:36.420> or<00:01:37.369> you

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
could just go and duplicate again or you

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.340 
could just go and duplicate again or you
can<00:01:38.490> just<00:01:38.729> have<00:01:38.970> if<00:01:39.540> you're<00:01:39.750> not<00:01:39.869> gonna<00:01:39.960> have

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
can just have if you're not gonna have

can just have if you're not gonna have
the<00:01:40.560> tie<00:01:40.740> in<00:01:40.920> I<00:01:40.950> mean<00:01:41.100> at<00:01:41.250> all<00:01:41.369> you<00:01:41.549> could<00:01:41.640> just

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
the tie in I mean at all you could just

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.550 
the tie in I mean at all you could just
have<00:01:41.909> it<00:01:41.939> as<00:01:42.119> different<00:01:42.570> frames<00:01:43.170> with<00:01:43.470> the

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
have it as different frames with the

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.399 
have it as different frames with the
different<00:01:43.829> colors<00:01:44.159> and<00:01:44.460> just<00:01:45.000> have<00:01:45.240> like<00:01:45.659> so

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
different colors and just have like so

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.319 
different colors and just have like so
it's<00:01:46.560> one<00:01:46.770> less<00:01:46.979> symbol<00:01:47.369> but<00:01:47.579> it's<00:01:48.060> all<00:01:48.210> up<00:01:48.270> to

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
it's one less symbol but it's all up to

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.330 
it's one less symbol but it's all up to
you<00:01:48.570> I<00:01:48.750> would<00:01:49.259> probably<00:01:49.500> do<00:01:49.860> a<00:01:49.890> duplicate

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
you I would probably do a duplicate

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.010 
you I would probably do a duplicate
symbol<00:01:50.610> here<00:01:50.790> in<00:01:50.909> case<00:01:51.090> you<00:01:51.119> want<00:01:51.270> to<00:01:51.479> add<00:01:51.600> some

symbol here in case you want to add some

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.460 
symbol here in case you want to add some
sway<00:01:52.590> to<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:53.210> the<00:01:54.210> tie<00:01:54.420> or<00:01:54.659> any<00:01:54.869> animation

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
sway to the the tie or any animation

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.280 
sway to the the tie or any animation
just<00:01:56.189> for<00:01:56.369> something<00:01:56.719> future<00:01:57.719> that<00:01:58.049> you<00:01:58.140> might

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
just for something future that you might

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.800 
just for something future that you might
end<00:01:58.409> up<00:01:58.500> doing<00:01:59.210> so<00:02:00.210> now<00:02:00.360> if<00:02:00.509> we<00:02:00.540> end<00:02:00.719> up

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
end up doing so now if we end up

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.630 
end up doing so now if we end up
changing<00:02:02.540> the<00:02:03.540> color<00:02:03.780> here<00:02:04.229> it<00:02:04.890> shouldn't

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
changing the color here it shouldn't

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.969 
changing the color here it shouldn't
affect<00:02:06.200> the<00:02:07.200> other<00:02:07.380> color<00:02:09.170> yes

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
affect the other color yes

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.050 
affect the other color yes
if<00:02:11.069> it's<00:02:11.220> something<00:02:11.430> different<00:02:13.909> so<00:02:14.909> now

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
if it's something different so now

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.899 
if it's something different so now
whatever<00:02:15.420> animation<00:02:16.110> you<00:02:16.260> do<00:02:16.409> if<00:02:17.400> you<00:02:17.640> wanted

00:02:17.899 --> 00:02:17.909 
whatever animation you do if you wanted

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:19.369 
whatever animation you do if you wanted
to<00:02:18.090> actually<00:02:18.269> them<00:02:18.780> all<00:02:18.959> to<00:02:19.110> have<00:02:19.230> the<00:02:19.349> same

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:19.379 
to actually them all to have the same

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:20.570 
to actually them all to have the same
type<00:02:19.680> of<00:02:19.769> animation<00:02:20.040> I<00:02:20.310> would<00:02:20.400> suggest

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
type of animation I would suggest

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.399 
type of animation I would suggest
animating<00:02:21.299> first<00:02:21.510> before<00:02:21.930> actually<00:02:22.379> doing

00:02:22.399 --> 00:02:22.409 
animating first before actually doing

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:25.759 
animating first before actually doing
the<00:02:22.709> duplicate<00:02:23.099> thing<00:02:24.379> it<00:02:25.379> just<00:02:25.409> makes<00:02:25.709> your

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:25.769 
the duplicate thing it just makes your

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:26.930 
the duplicate thing it just makes your
life<00:02:25.830> a<00:02:26.040> little<00:02:26.129> bit<00:02:26.220> easier<00:02:26.340> in<00:02:26.610> a<00:02:26.640> long<00:02:26.819> run

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
life a little bit easier in a long run

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:34.820 
life a little bit easier in a long run

control D right click duplicate symbol

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:55.400 
control D right click duplicate symbol
you<00:02:46.200> know<00:02:46.290> -<00:02:46.650> 3<00:02:48.680> do<00:02:49.680> it<00:02:49.920> symbol<00:02:51.739> 3<00:02:54.410> duplicate

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
you know - 3 do it symbol 3 duplicate

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:02.180 
you know - 3 do it symbol 3 duplicate
symbol<00:02:56.840> 3<00:02:58.849> and<00:03:00.140> we'll<00:03:01.140> toss<00:03:01.560> this<00:03:01.739> one<00:03:01.890> is<00:03:02.010> this

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
have to keep on duplicating symbols all

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:14.569 
have to keep on duplicating symbols all
the<00:03:11.579> way<00:03:11.670> down<00:03:11.879> to<00:03:12.269> its<00:03:12.299> raw<00:03:12.720> artwork<00:03:13.109> and<00:03:13.579> that

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:14.579 
the way down to its raw artwork and that

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:16.789 
the way down to its raw artwork and that
way<00:03:14.760> when<00:03:14.940> you<00:03:15.030> if<00:03:15.329> change<00:03:16.019> their<00:03:16.169> artwork<00:03:16.590> it

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799 
way when you if change their artwork it

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:18.259 
way when you if change their artwork it
won't<00:03:16.950> change<00:03:17.190> the<00:03:17.579> raw<00:03:17.700> artwork<00:03:18.090> of<00:03:18.239> the

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:18.269 
won't change the raw artwork of the

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:22.220 
won't change the raw artwork of the
other<00:03:18.870> symbols<00:03:19.459> your<00:03:20.459> originals<00:03:20.880> and<00:03:21.230> you

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
other symbols your originals and you

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.110 
other symbols your originals and you
still<00:03:22.440> get<00:03:22.620> the<00:03:22.829> same<00:03:22.980> effect<00:03:23.099> hopefully<00:03:24.000> that

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
still get the same effect hopefully that

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.629 
still get the same effect hopefully that
helps<00:03:24.419> out<00:03:24.569> let<00:03:25.319> me<00:03:25.349> know<00:03:25.440> if<00:03:25.889> you<00:03:26.250> run<00:03:26.370> to<00:03:26.519> any

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
other of troubles I'll try to get on to

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.890 
other of troubles I'll try to get on to
doing<00:03:28.859> videos<00:03:29.669> like<00:03:29.880> this<00:03:30.120> it'll<00:03:30.480> just<00:03:30.660> make

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
doing videos like this it'll just make

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.509 
doing videos like this it'll just make
life<00:03:31.230> a<00:03:31.349> lot<00:03:31.440> easier<00:03:31.500> you<00:03:31.919> could<00:03:32.099> visually<00:03:32.489> see

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
life a lot easier you could visually see

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:36.530 
life a lot easier you could visually see
the<00:03:33.060> changes<00:03:34.049> and<00:03:34.669> see<00:03:35.669> exactly<00:03:35.910> what<00:03:36.180> I<00:03:36.209> press

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
the changes and see exactly what I press

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.559 
the changes and see exactly what I press
and<00:03:36.840> do<00:03:36.989> and<00:03:37.230> I<00:03:37.950> think<00:03:38.579> it's<00:03:38.790> a<00:03:38.849> lot<00:03:39.030> clearer

00:03:39.559 --> 00:03:39.569 
and do and I think it's a lot clearer

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:43.069 
and do and I think it's a lot clearer
that<00:03:39.780> way<00:03:40.069> cool
