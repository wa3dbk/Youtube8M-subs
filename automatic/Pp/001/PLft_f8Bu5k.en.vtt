walkthrough<00:00:08.269> video<00:00:08.629> and<00:00:08.959> now<00:00:09.950> we're<00:00:10.129> starting

00:00:10.449 --> 00:00:10.459 
walkthrough video and now we're starting

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:15.640 
walkthrough video and now we're starting
on<00:00:10.610> level<00:00:11.510> 16<00:00:13.000> so<00:00:14.000> I'm<00:00:14.870> fast-forwarding<00:00:15.349> a

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:15.650 
on level 16 so I'm fast-forwarding a

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:17.200 
on level 16 so I'm fast-forwarding a
little<00:00:15.950> bit<00:00:16.070> quicker<00:00:16.309> just<00:00:16.669> so<00:00:16.880> the<00:00:17.000> video

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:17.210 
little bit quicker just so the video

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:18.790 
little bit quicker just so the video
goes<00:00:17.390> slightly<00:00:17.630> faster<00:00:18.020> because<00:00:18.380> this<00:00:18.619> one

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:18.800 
goes slightly faster because this one

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.589 
goes slightly faster because this one
did<00:00:19.279> take<00:00:19.490> me<00:00:19.520> a<00:00:19.970> little<00:00:20.300> bit<00:00:20.419> longer<00:00:20.630> to<00:00:20.960> do<00:00:22.599> so

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:23.599

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
door you won't be able to get in you

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.129 
door you won't be able to get in you
have<00:01:46.159> to<00:01:46.310> retry<00:01:46.789> so<00:01:47.600> that<00:01:47.749> one's<00:01:47.929> a<00:01:48.020> little

00:01:48.129 --> 00:01:48.139 
have to retry so that one's a little

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:49.989 
have to retry so that one's a little
tough<00:01:48.409> to<00:01:48.439> get<00:01:48.679> but<00:01:49.280> if<00:01:49.460> you<00:01:49.639> know<00:01:49.759> what<00:01:49.789> you're

00:01:49.989 --> 00:01:49.999 
tough to get but if you know what you're

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:53.980 
tough to get but if you know what you're
doing<00:01:50.329> then<00:01:51.189> right<00:01:52.189> right<00:01:52.490> away<00:01:52.759> just<00:01:52.929> blow<00:01:53.929> up

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
doing then right right away just blow up

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:55.179 
doing then right right away just blow up
the<00:01:54.109> green<00:01:54.259> barrel<00:01:54.530> and<00:01:54.590> you<00:01:54.679> can<00:01:54.799> do<00:01:54.889> it<00:01:55.009> no

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:55.189 
the green barrel and you can do it no

00:01:55.189 --> 00:02:04.760 
the green barrel and you can do it no
problem

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:10.790 

this<00:02:05.340> one<00:02:05.609> is<00:02:08.720> fairly<00:02:09.720> easy<00:02:09.929> I<00:02:10.259> guess<00:02:10.349> it'll

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
this one is fairly easy I guess it'll

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.309 
this one is fairly easy I guess it'll
let<00:02:11.430> the<00:02:11.640> 10<00:02:11.879> one<00:02:12.090> the<00:02:12.330> last<00:02:12.569> one<00:02:12.780> took<00:02:13.170> me

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
let the 10 one the last one took me

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.770 
let the 10 one the last one took me
forever<00:02:13.470> to<00:02:13.769> find<00:02:13.860> but<00:02:14.340> this<00:02:15.180> wasn't<00:02:15.390> wasn't

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
forever to find but this wasn't wasn't

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.660 
forever to find but this wasn't wasn't
so<00:02:16.110> difficult<00:02:16.260> i<00:02:16.530> think<00:02:16.709> i<00:02:16.739> found<00:02:16.920> this<00:02:17.129> my

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
so difficult i think i found this my

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:23.300 
so difficult i think i found this my
first<00:02:17.819> run-through<00:02:18.180> so<00:02:21.709> yeah<00:02:22.709> that's<00:02:23.160> me

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
first run-through so yeah that's me

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:24.920 
first run-through so yeah that's me
looking<00:02:23.640> around<00:02:23.849> for<00:02:24.180> i<00:02:24.239> think<00:02:24.569> i<00:02:24.629> already<00:02:24.720> got

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
looking around for i think i already got

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.729 
looking around for i think i already got
it<00:02:25.140> though<00:02:26.900> all<00:02:27.900> right<00:02:28.049> as<00:02:28.290> soon<00:02:28.410> as<00:02:28.530> you<00:02:28.590> go<00:02:28.709> up

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
it though all right as soon as you go up

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:31.190 
it though all right as soon as you go up
here<00:02:29.250> you<00:02:29.430> want<00:02:29.610> to<00:02:29.700> just<00:02:29.900> get<00:02:30.900> rid<00:02:30.959> of<00:02:31.140> that

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
here you want to just get rid of that

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.050 
here you want to just get rid of that
scientist<00:02:31.709> yeah<00:02:31.920> this<00:02:32.069> okay<00:02:32.519> no<00:02:32.670> nevermind

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
scientist yeah this okay no nevermind

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.190 
scientist yeah this okay no nevermind
this<00:02:33.180> one<00:02:33.330> was<00:02:33.510> a<00:02:33.540> little<00:02:33.660> bit<00:02:33.900> more<00:02:34.049> difficult

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
this one was a little bit more difficult

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.199 
this one was a little bit more difficult
i'm<00:02:34.470> thinking<00:02:34.709> another<00:02:34.890> one<00:02:35.099> yeah<00:02:35.970> i<00:02:36.000> see

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
i'm thinking another one yeah i see

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:37.520 
i'm thinking another one yeah i see
there<00:02:36.420> it<00:02:36.480> is<00:02:36.569> on<00:02:36.690> that<00:02:36.810> platform<00:02:37.079> you<00:02:37.319> can't

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
there it is on that platform you can't

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.350 
there it is on that platform you can't
get<00:02:37.650> it<00:02:37.769> yet<00:02:37.980> I<00:02:38.280> think<00:02:38.760> there's<00:02:38.910> me<00:02:39.090> trying<00:02:39.329> to

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
get it yet I think there's me trying to

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.470 
get it yet I think there's me trying to
get<00:02:39.540> it<00:02:39.630> I<00:02:39.690> think<00:02:39.750> yeah<00:02:40.880> you<00:02:41.880> can't<00:02:42.120> do<00:02:42.239> it<00:02:42.360> like

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
get it I think yeah you can't do it like

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.390 
get it I think yeah you can't do it like
that<00:02:42.510> just<00:02:43.170> a<00:02:43.290> little<00:02:43.470> demonstration<00:02:43.680> of<00:02:44.250> what

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
that just a little demonstration of what

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:57.400 
that just a little demonstration of what
not<00:02:44.549> to<00:02:44.610> do<00:02:44.849> so<00:02:45.120> you<00:02:45.180> go<00:02:45.450> up<00:02:45.540> here<00:02:45.750> again
