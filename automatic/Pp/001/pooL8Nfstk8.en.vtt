00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:08.309
 People you see again mg tv and today 

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:11.090
 I once have the unboxing to mine 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.090
 new laptop 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.930
 my age the total damage one has the 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.620
 I just had insurance there 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:40.989
 given a little money 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.730
 and yes, did not submit from 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:46.300
 because the laptop was already four years old 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:47.920
 Of course, now I have the other day 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.769
 actually wanted to my old 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.480
 make laptop video where I show yes that 

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:54.280
 I had before I got my 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.589
 Computers have assembled a gaming 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.720
 but he has no more 

00:00:56.589 --> 00:01:02.320
 works because the thing of scrap 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:03.850
 I was gonna join you then 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.110
 make video where I tell you something 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.810
 I have before then you need it 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:10.330
 a new pc show but now first 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:19.000
 this in addition to the unboxing that is a 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:23.350
 toshiba satellite l 70 143 look at the 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:27.000
 packaging at actually quite strictly 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.000
 kept it similar to the old one 

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:37.320
 you can actually see what you do 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:39.750
 always sees toshiba recommends office pkv 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.430
 skype and ebay 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.920
 What's funny is they always do this 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.270
 mcaffee on it, I have to do it there 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.960
 That does not really want that at all 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.640
 no matter 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:53.280
 You can always do that down again 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.280
 make someone just look to open 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:04.780
 dot quality seal that can indeed 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:08.619
 nor the house everywhere did not contribute 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:15.570
 through or at least let's have a look 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:22.209
 but oh yes to the technical data 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:26.829
 will be your intel core i7 4700 mq with 2 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:31.930
 4 gigahertz in turbo 3.4 has the laptop 

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:34.390
 Incidentally, 858 euros cost otherwise 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:37.540
 we still have twelve gigabytes of ram and 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:40.260
 Although the 1600 gram is not 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:44.220
 alarms we have a 1600 megawatt 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:48.489
 yes, I say that extra stupid right now 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:52.060
 43 9 cm in the diagonal so the 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:57.370
 screen has 43 9 cm is a full hd 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:03:00.849
 of course as 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:04.030
 graphics card comes because the geforce gt 740 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:09.130
 m to use for use if god my 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:11.650
 German with two gigabytes of RAM 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:14.400
 Ram does not share it somehow takes it 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.400
 not from the main memory 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:18.150
 otherwise you can still have a 750 gb 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.590
 hard disk 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:24.069
 The battery should be about four hours 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:24.940
 keep my old laptop had one 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:28.120
 hour 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.470
 that was pretty bad good now 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.989
 not quite as great as mine 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:33.760
 old we do not have any in here 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:35.530
 cable and I had with my old one 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.720
 So that's a speaker for the people 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:39.269
 they did not know the squad 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:44.160
 boxing evil good 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:46.630
 here are only boxes 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:50.069
 whatever that is for a company 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:50.069
 I had never heard before 

00:03:52.109 --> 00:04:02.200
 But let's move on to the laptop 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:06.459
 very noble here with silver behind with 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:09.700
 black dts sound we have here 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:16.060
 toshiba logo went a bit far 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:20.760
 away i find beautiful size more beautiful 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:22.479
 laptop that is right there is the button 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.700
 Keys are beautiful 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:26.800
 We have a nice place in between 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:28.330
 we have the last year here 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:31.720
 a little bit close together you get up 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:35.800
 then we make a mistake again the 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:37.030
 logos intel inside core i7 geforce and 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:42.400
 energy star 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:46.590
 there you can see satellite then looks like 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.590
 from the top practically 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:59.400
 Rear hamburg on the website we have 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:05:02.660
 here for a moment that she totally 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:04.490
 shit but next to this blue usb 3.0 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:06.750
 We have connections here once 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:09.900
 then we have microphones and headset 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:12.780
 here hdmi vga gigabit lan and was called the 

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:15.300
 ventilation slot and here to secure 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:19.200
 that is also very bad for me now 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:22.680
 is so that the part is not stolen 

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:25.470
 I think you know that we have the lead 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:27.990
 here's a sd card slot where you 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:30.570
 Now, too, maybe not 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:34.880
 little bit in any case there is 

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:39.450
 one on the back we have again 

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:42.570
 Model name when the camera is now 

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:46.860
 time would adam what was there 

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:49.580
 the windows 8 logo otherwise we have 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:51.990
 there still the battery 

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:55.710
 yes I think there's the frame 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:57.560
 however to such a small ram sign is what 

00:05:55.710 --> 00:06:02.300
 Maybe you can see it a bit 

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:05.130
 on the side we have the drive 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:06.180
 By the way, only normal dvd drive 

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:08.250
 actually I would not need any 

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:10.740
 drive more but good that's it 

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:15.150
 Ladies still a very bad recognizable 

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:18.240
 USB 2.0 ports and the charging port that 

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:22.440
 the charging port that the usb 2 0 port 

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:26.120
 that drive then let's see 

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:26.120
 what else was left in the box 

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:34.270
 Of course what charger exact 

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:36.520
 same connection and what has all 

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:38.200
 looks just like my last, the 

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:40.830
 I find that very interesting because only 

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:44.800
 What have changed 

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:45.460
 we had a normal here before 

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:49.560
 attracts 

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:52.180
 Here we had your power cable 

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:54.670
 yes that was it with the unboxing 

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:55.390
 and with the very short presentation of 

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:57.970
 this laptop 

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:59.440
 I hope you liked it 

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:01.450
 It's nice if you thumb me up 

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:05.170
 would leave an abo would leave 

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:07.930
 if they did not do that and yes 

00:07:05.170 --> 00:07:10.360
 See you again at the next video 

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:13.870
 I would say I have another one 

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:15.580
 to upload some videos 

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:17.470
 to cut and so on is yes 

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:20.800
 like that is weekly follow videos 

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:23.230
 as well as sometimes more often 

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:24.670
 and then we'll see each other the next 

00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:26.910
 video as already mentioned 

00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:26.910
 Yes
