00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:33.660 
in recent history I believe it really is
bigger<00:03:32.260> than<00:03:32.440> just<00:03:32.590> the<00:03:33.070> fight<00:03:33.310> of<00:03:33.460> the<00:03:33.640> year

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
bigger than just the fight of the year

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:35.190 
bigger than just the fight of the year
so<00:03:34.090> I<00:03:34.120> really<00:03:34.450> think<00:03:34.600> it's<00:03:34.810> one<00:03:34.960> of<00:03:35.080> the

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
so I really think it's one of the

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.930 
so I really think it's one of the
biggest<00:03:35.350> showdowns<00:03:35.950> it's<00:03:36.610> a<00:03:36.730> showdown

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
biggest showdowns it's a showdown

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:39.150 
biggest showdowns it's a showdown
between<00:03:37.300> two<00:03:37.800> african-americans<00:03:38.800> as<00:03:38.980> well

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
between two african-americans as well

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:40.680 
between two african-americans as well
and<00:03:39.370> I<00:03:39.430> think<00:03:39.460> it's<00:03:39.790> growing<00:03:40.150> back<00:03:40.180> to<00:03:40.570> the

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
and I think it's growing back to the

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:43.500 
and I think it's growing back to the
Leonard<00:03:41.020> Hurons<00:03:41.350> days<00:03:41.700> you<00:03:42.700> know<00:03:42.820> when<00:03:43.120> when
