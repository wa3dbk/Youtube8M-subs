 healthy to all with you channel maximum games 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:08.220
 my name is max and today I will show you 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:11.309
 how to play co-op games dying light 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:15.179
 on pirates for this we need 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:17.699
 the game itself and the program hamachi and because 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.410
 that other programs I have not tried and 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.470
 Basically, I'm not going to try 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.570
 but the problem is hamachi is that more 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.420
 two players at least we have with 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:30.119
 friends could not play as 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.669
 3 players already throws out of the game but about 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:36.270
 this later what to start us 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:38.070
 I would basically need a game like this 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.200
 say the official website hamachi 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:44.070
 which is called hamachi dot ru 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:47.120
 soft tonic dot com just make money 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.829
 download button then download again and 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.989
 the program will automatically download and 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.750
 it is installed without any problems 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.690
 after that we run this 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.579
 the program 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:02.609
 see that we are thanked here for 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.860
 install hamachi and to enable us 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:08.430
 you need to click this button by clicking on 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.670
 her and we are offered to either enter or 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:14.430
 sign up but since i already have 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:17.070
 all the data is, I now just go in and 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.950
 those who do not have to click registration she 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.570
 here in general it is not so long you 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.659
 enter your e-mail 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:27.990
 two times the password and everything is generally more 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:31.229
 nothing to do here is not necessary so after 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.810
 We went to this program to us 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.390
 here offer either create a new network 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.869
 either connect to an existing network and 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.960
 let's create a new one here too 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.850
 we are offered to enter 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:50.990
 network id and password let's 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:53.329
 let's call it my channel max Egor 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:56.659
 do not let it be. 

00:01:53.329 --> 00:02:00.180
 enter the password let's say 1 2 3 4 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:02.009
 confirm it and create your network here 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:05.899
 she is our network which can 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:08.819
 join as I understood it was 5 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:11.310
 users and your friend you just 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.750
 say your id which 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.440
 let's say in this case 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:20.040
 called a maximum of games with a dot and give 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:22.800
 he has his password and in the meantime he enters 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.840
 him either click here to connect 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.420
 to an existing network either as you saw 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.020
 When you first start it clicks not to create 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:33.680
 your network and connect to the existing 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:36.390
 enters your ID and password 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.070
 joins you successfully and should he 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.880
 will appear in this list 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:44.250
 with a blue one this circle and after 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:48.209
 this you can already safely run the game 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:54.180
 and now let her run and explain what to do 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:56.489
 further and so here we are in the game and us as 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:03:00.300
 Create sure to let the game 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:04.170
 be already in the game itself and after that 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:06.810
 press escape and see a button c here 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:09.060
 which is responsible for session parameters 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:12.870
 if you play pirates and you have there 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:16.620
 at first there will be one player for you 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:22.670
 need to put on the local network after 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:22.670
 what your friend can even change in 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:28.640
 in the tab selection of players you have already 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:31.849
 will find you there will be shown your 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:34.099
 game progress and what is the name of the mission 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:37.370
 which you stopped after which he to 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:39.409
 you join you will appear here 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.870
 such a notice that such and such 

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:44.150
 the player joins the game and will appear 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:48.470
 he is next to you then you can 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:51.379
 feel free to play the dying light game 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:53.120
 cooperative but if you're going there 

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:56.239
 connect to someone 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:58.939
 to the one who creates this whole game again 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:02.989
 I will repeat be sure to be already in the gameplay 

00:03:58.939 --> 00:04:05.120
 in general, that's all I think you all 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:07.489
