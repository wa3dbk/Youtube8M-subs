00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
like this you'd have Robredo back up if

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.010 
like this you'd have Robredo back up if
necessary<00:01:41.490> so<00:01:41.670> he<00:01:41.850> would<00:01:41.970> cede<00:01:42.299> some<00:01:42.689> court

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020

necessary so he would cede some court
positioning<00:01:43.470> in<00:01:43.560> terms<00:01:43.590> of<00:01:43.829> his<00:01:43.920> vertical

positioning in terms of his vertical
court<00:01:44.579> position<00:01:44.850> he<00:01:44.970> would<00:01:45.060> back<00:01:45.329> up<00:01:45.630> and<00:01:45.930> then

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
court position he would back up and then

wide the smart play typically and the

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.109 
wide the smart play typically and the
play<00:02:07.350> Rafa<00:02:07.619> will<00:02:07.920> make<00:02:08.069> is<00:02:08.220> to<00:02:08.250> go<00:02:08.459> cross-court

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
play Rafa will make is to go cross-court

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.790 
play Rafa will make is to go cross-court
into<00:02:09.690> the<00:02:09.750> open<00:02:09.989> court<00:02:10.170> particularly<00:02:10.500> for

into the open court particularly for

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.860 
into the open court particularly for
burritos<00:02:11.069> way<00:02:11.220> over<00:02:11.400> here<00:02:11.610> so<00:02:12.209> Rafa<00:02:12.480> would<00:02:12.750> do

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
burritos way over here so Rafa would do

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.460 
burritos way over here so Rafa would do
that

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
that

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.620 
that
and<00:02:14.130> then<00:02:14.280> you<00:02:14.370> get<00:02:14.520> Robredo<00:02:14.940> moving<00:02:15.360> over

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
and then you get Robredo moving over

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.450 
and then you get Robredo moving over
sometimes<00:02:16.200> depending<00:02:16.650> on<00:02:16.770> the<00:02:16.830> shot<00:02:17.040> he<00:02:17.280> would

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
sometimes depending on the shot he would

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:20.000 
sometimes depending on the shot he would
send<00:02:18.180> it<00:02:18.330> back<00:02:18.450> cross-court<00:02:19.110> to<00:02:19.140> rafas<00:02:19.650> back

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
send it back cross-court to rafas back

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.490 
send it back cross-court to rafas back
end<00:02:20.340> but<00:02:20.970> other<00:02:21.120> times<00:02:21.450> he<00:02:21.840> would<00:02:21.990> then<00:02:22.110> rip

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
end but other times he would then rip

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.040 
end but other times he would then rip
the<00:02:22.830> ensuing<00:02:23.250> so<00:02:23.520> here's<00:02:23.730> Rafa's<00:02:24.210> backhand

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
the ensuing so here's Rafa's backhand

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.110 
the ensuing so here's Rafa's backhand
for<00:02:25.650> bread<00:02:25.860> oh<00:02:25.890> then<00:02:26.160> rip<00:02:26.400> it<00:02:26.430> down<00:02:26.610> the<00:02:26.910> line

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
for bread oh then rip it down the line

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.900 
for bread oh then rip it down the line
back<00:02:27.510> to<00:02:27.750> rafas<00:02:28.170> forehand<00:02:28.800> but<00:02:29.430> now<00:02:29.580> Rauf<00:02:29.880> is

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
back to rafas forehand but now Rauf is

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.430 
back to rafas forehand but now Rauf is
on<00:02:30.300> the<00:02:30.510> run<00:02:31.250> so<00:02:32.250> in<00:02:32.430> other<00:02:32.550> words<00:02:33.260> Robredo<00:02:34.260> was

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
on the run so in other words Robredo was

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.010 
on the run so in other words Robredo was
playing<00:02:34.710> extremely<00:02:34.980> high-risk<00:02:35.700> tennis<00:02:36.240> in

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
playing extremely high-risk tennis in

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
playing extremely high-risk tennis in
terms<00:02:37.290> of<00:02:37.410> his<00:02:37.470> changes<00:02:37.890> of<00:02:38.010> direction

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
terms of his changes of direction

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.980 
terms of his changes of direction
because<00:02:38.670> he<00:02:38.970> said<00:02:39.180> to<00:02:39.270> himself<00:02:39.390> well<00:02:39.810> I'm

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
because he said to himself well I'm

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:41.900 
because he said to himself well I'm
going<00:02:40.080> to<00:02:40.170> beat<00:02:40.770> rafa<00:02:41.130> I<00:02:41.160> have<00:02:41.370> to<00:02:41.490> move<00:02:41.670> him

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
going to beat rafa I have to move him

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.450 
going to beat rafa I have to move him
around<00:02:42.090> the<00:02:42.330> court<00:02:42.600> and<00:02:43.010> ultimately<00:02:44.010> wait<00:02:44.280> for

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:44.460 
around the court and ultimately wait for

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:45.920 
around the court and ultimately wait for
Rafa<00:02:44.640> to<00:02:44.820> give<00:02:44.940> me<00:02:45.060> something<00:02:45.300> short<00:02:45.600> so<00:02:45.720> I<00:02:45.780> can

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
Rafa to give me something short so I can

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.500 
Rafa to give me something short so I can
step<00:02:46.170> up<00:02:46.380> and<00:02:46.590> then<00:02:46.709> take<00:02:46.920> control<00:02:47.280> and<00:02:47.640> that's

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
step up and then take control and that's

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.150 
step up and then take control and that's
what<00:02:48.750> happened<00:02:49.110> Roberto<00:02:49.380> was<00:02:49.620> coming<00:02:49.920> to<00:02:49.980> Ned

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
what happened Roberto was coming to Ned

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.370 
what happened Roberto was coming to Ned
he<00:02:50.190> was<00:02:50.400> attacking<00:02:50.700> short<00:02:51.060> balls<00:02:51.380> interesting

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
he was attacking short balls interesting

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.230 
he was attacking short balls interesting
to<00:02:52.500> see<00:02:52.650> that's<00:02:52.980> not<00:02:53.130> typically<00:02:53.610> the<00:02:53.730> type<00:02:54.090> of

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.240 
to see that's not typically the type of

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.140 
to see that's not typically the type of
game<00:02:54.540> plan<00:02:54.810> you<00:02:54.990> expect<00:02:55.470> out<00:02:55.680> of<00:02:55.770> out<00:02:56.730> of<00:02:56.790> a<00:02:56.970> guy

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
game plan you expect out of out of a guy

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.030 
game plan you expect out of out of a guy
like<00:02:57.390> Robredo<00:02:57.870> who<00:02:58.200> you<00:02:58.530> certainly<00:02:58.830> wouldn't

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
like Robredo who you certainly wouldn't

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.860 
like Robredo who you certainly wouldn't
characterize<00:02:59.310> is<00:02:59.790> the<00:02:59.910> most<00:03:00.150> aggressive

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
characterize is the most aggressive

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.030 
characterize is the most aggressive
player<00:03:01.320> on<00:03:01.860> the<00:03:02.580> on<00:03:02.940> the<00:03:03.000> Pro<00:03:03.450> Tour<00:03:03.950> so<00:03:04.950> the

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
player on the on the Pro Tour so the

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.770 
player on the on the Pro Tour so the
reason<00:03:05.220> I<00:03:05.430> talked<00:03:05.700> about<00:03:05.850> that<00:03:06.209> example<00:03:06.570> of

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
reason I talked about that example of

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.690 
reason I talked about that example of
because<00:03:07.140> I<00:03:07.350> anticipate<00:03:09.590> Roberto<00:03:10.590> to<00:03:11.040> do<00:03:11.490> the

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
because I anticipate Roberto to do the

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.820 
because I anticipate Roberto to do the
same<00:03:11.940> thing<00:03:12.240> against<00:03:12.990> Federer<00:03:13.410> if<00:03:13.530> we<00:03:13.650> put

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
same thing against Federer if we put

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.820 
same thing against Federer if we put
them<00:03:13.920> back<00:03:14.070> here<00:03:15.320> something's<00:03:16.320> you<00:03:16.440> have<00:03:16.680> to

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
them back here something's you have to

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:17.750 
them back here something's you have to
do<00:03:16.980> and<00:03:17.130> he's<00:03:17.220> going<00:03:17.340> to<00:03:17.400> have<00:03:17.519> to<00:03:17.580> do

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
do and he's going to have to do

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.460 
do and he's going to have to do
obviously<00:03:18.180> over<00:03:18.480> the<00:03:18.570> course<00:03:18.780> of<00:03:18.900> a<00:03:19.019> five-set

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
obviously over the course of a five-set

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.070 
obviously over the course of a five-set
match<00:03:19.680> if<00:03:20.000> if<00:03:21.000> he<00:03:21.209> wants<00:03:21.480> to<00:03:21.540> win<00:03:21.750> this<00:03:21.930> he

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 
match if if he wants to win this he

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.070 
match if if he wants to win this he
needs<00:03:22.260> to<00:03:22.410> move<00:03:22.620> Federer<00:03:23.100> around<00:03:23.610> and<00:03:24.080> prevent

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 
needs to move Federer around and prevent

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.880 
needs to move Federer around and prevent
federal<00:03:25.260> from<00:03:25.940> from<00:03:26.940> getting<00:03:27.180> on<00:03:27.300> balance<00:03:27.890> the

federal from from getting on balance the

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.070 
federal from from getting on balance the
right<00:03:29.820> now<00:03:30.000> this<00:03:30.209> would<00:03:30.269> be<00:03:30.570> because<00:03:30.840> we<00:03:30.870> have

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
right now this would be because we have

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.259 
right now this would be because we have
a<00:03:31.110> writing<00:03:31.590> down<00:03:31.800> here<00:03:32.040> with<00:03:32.160> Federer<00:03:32.459> this<00:03:33.120> is

a writing down here with Federer this is

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:35.540 
a writing down here with Federer this is
now<00:03:33.450> you're<00:03:33.690> just<00:03:33.810> typical<00:03:34.230> backhand<00:03:34.830> to

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:35.550 
now you're just typical backhand to

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:38.180 
now you're just typical backhand to
backhand<00:03:36.120> exchange<00:03:36.959> but<00:03:37.709> we<00:03:37.830> all<00:03:37.950> know<00:03:38.160> that

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
backhand exchange but we all know that

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.370 
backhand exchange but we all know that
federal<00:03:38.850> loves<00:03:39.150> to<00:03:39.330> move<00:03:39.510> around<00:03:39.660> these<00:03:40.080> balls

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
federal loves to move around these balls

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:44.270 
federal loves to move around these balls
and<00:03:40.850> either<00:03:41.850> go<00:03:42.269> inside<00:03:43.019> out<00:03:43.049> over<00:03:43.709> here<00:03:44.040> or

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
and either go inside out over here or

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.140 
and either go inside out over here or
inside<00:03:45.060> in<00:03:45.739> so<00:03:46.739> I<00:03:46.769> don't<00:03:47.160> think<00:03:47.340> Roberto<00:03:47.580> can

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
inside in so I don't think Roberto can

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.780 
inside in so I don't think Roberto can
just<00:03:48.750> get<00:03:48.930> content<00:03:49.320> to<00:03:49.500> try<00:03:49.739> and<00:03:49.890> you<00:03:50.730> know

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
just get content to try and you know

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.030 
just get content to try and you know

final the other thing to look for I

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:43.580

mentioned<00:04:42.030> this<00:04:42.090> in<00:04:42.150> a<00:04:42.300> previous<00:04:42.330> video<00:04:42.780> deuce

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 
mentioned this in a previous video deuce

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:49.999 
court the the out wide kind of slider
he's<00:04:48.419> been<00:04:48.630> using<00:04:48.930> that<00:04:49.050> the<00:04:49.229> last<00:04:49.440> couple

00:04:49.999 --> 00:04:50.009 
he's been using that the last couple

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:51.950 
he's been using that the last couple
matches<00:04:50.520> is<00:04:50.669> he<00:04:50.789> going<00:04:50.940> to<00:04:50.970> continue<00:04:51.509> to<00:04:51.780> use

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:51.960 
matches is he going to continue to use

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.170 
matches is he going to continue to use
that<00:04:52.229> this<00:04:52.889> would<00:04:53.039> be<00:04:53.160> very<00:04:53.340> effective<00:04:53.669> and<00:04:54.090> it

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.180 
that this would be very effective and it

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.990 
that this would be very effective and it
was<00:04:54.330> effective<00:04:54.780> against<00:04:55.050> the<00:04:55.139> doll<00:04:55.320> so<00:04:56.100> so

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.000 
was effective against the doll so so

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.670 
was effective against the doll so so
we'll<00:04:57.060> see<00:04:57.270> if<00:04:57.300> that's<00:04:57.570> in<00:04:57.780> there<00:04:57.990> we'll<00:04:58.530> see

00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:58.680 
we'll see if that's in there we'll see

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.260 
we'll see if that's in there we'll see
if<00:04:58.800> Roger<00:04:59.009> just<00:04:59.250> comes<00:04:59.490> that<00:04:59.669> net<00:04:59.820> in<00:04:59.940> general

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:00.270 
if Roger just comes that net in general

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:03.770 
if Roger just comes that net in general
and<00:05:00.360> tries<00:05:00.509> to<00:05:00.539> keep<00:05:00.780> point<00:05:01.080> short<00:05:01.639> so<00:05:02.750> so<00:05:03.750> I

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:03.780 
and tries to keep point short so so I

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:05.510 
and tries to keep point short so so I
think<00:05:03.840> there's<00:05:04.349> going<00:05:04.440> to<00:05:04.530> be<00:05:04.560> some<00:05:04.770> the

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:05.520 
think there's going to be some the

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:06.710 
think there's going to be some the
protect<00:05:05.910> the<00:05:06.060> potential<00:05:06.449> for<00:05:06.539> some

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:06.720 
protect the potential for some

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:08.570 
protect the potential for some
interesting<00:05:06.960> dynamics<00:05:07.620> interesting<00:05:08.130> tactics

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:08.580

from<00:05:08.699> this<00:05:08.880> match<00:05:09.060> my<00:05:10.020> prediction<00:05:10.259> is<00:05:11.389> Federer

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:12.389 
from this match my prediction is Federer

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:15.290 
from this match my prediction is Federer
in<00:05:12.599> four<00:05:13.199> sets<00:05:13.470> Robredo<00:05:14.099> is<00:05:14.849> certainly<00:05:15.210> a

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.300 
in four sets Robredo is certainly a

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.990 
in four sets Robredo is certainly a
crafty<00:05:15.780> and<00:05:15.900> a<00:05:15.990> tough<00:05:16.680> player<00:05:16.979> so<00:05:17.669> I<00:05:17.699> think

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:18.000 
crafty and a tough player so I think

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.350 
crafty and a tough player so I think
he'll<00:05:18.389> pull<00:05:18.570> a<00:05:18.599> set<00:05:18.900> he'll<00:05:19.440> get<00:05:19.650> a<00:05:19.680> set<00:05:20.360> but

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:21.360 
he'll pull a set he'll get a set but

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.110 
he'll pull a set he'll get a set but
yeah<00:05:21.479> Federer<00:05:21.810> in<00:05:21.900> four<00:05:22.320> sets<00:05:22.560> so<00:05:23.340> so<00:05:23.910> let<00:05:24.090> me

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:24.120 
yeah Federer in four sets so so let me

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.790 
yeah Federer in four sets so so let me
know<00:05:24.330> what<00:05:24.509> you<00:05:24.570> think<00:05:24.720> of<00:05:24.960> this<00:05:25.259> analysis
