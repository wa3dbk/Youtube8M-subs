00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.589 
guys in a second and this list of 10 is
a<00:02:49.590> pretty<00:02:49.980> realistic<00:02:50.310> list<00:02:50.790> it's<00:02:51.419> actually

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:51.599 
a pretty realistic list it's actually

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:53.720 
a pretty realistic list it's actually
wrestlers<00:02:52.319> we've<00:02:52.500> seen<00:02:52.709> on<00:02:52.829> previous<00:02:53.159> games<00:02:53.459> I

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
wrestlers we've seen on previous games I

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.490 
wrestlers we've seen on previous games I
think<00:02:54.299> actually<00:02:54.419> most<00:02:54.810> of<00:02:54.900> these<00:02:55.019> guys<00:02:55.260> have

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
think actually most of these guys have

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.740 
think actually most of these guys have
all<00:02:55.620> been<00:02:55.650> on<00:02:55.950> legends<00:02:56.849> of<00:02:56.909> wrestlemania<00:02:57.180> so

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
all been on legends of wrestlemania so

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.750 
all been on legends of wrestlemania so
you<00:02:58.290> know<00:02:58.439> from<00:02:58.590> a<00:02:58.680> contract<00:02:59.099> standpoint<00:02:59.579> it

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
you know from a contract standpoint it

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.759 
you know from a contract standpoint it
shouldn't<00:03:00.060> be<00:03:00.150> much<00:03:00.269> of<00:03:00.329> an<00:03:00.540> issue<00:03:00.599> to<00:03:01.409> have

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769 
shouldn't be much of an issue to have

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:04.069 
shouldn't be much of an issue to have
these<00:03:01.919> guys<00:03:02.159> on<00:03:02.340> the<00:03:02.430> game<00:03:02.639> so<00:03:03.299> this<00:03:03.510> list<00:03:03.810> like
