00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.160
 January and that he was following 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:26.340
 stay in the j-bay tent any amount 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:27.900
 help in the carioca championship teresa rola 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.359
 Hey guys, what radio stations are bringing 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.669
 another video for rice and this time 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.739
 showing something that many like to see 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:38.280
 in games mainly in the gta franchise 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:40.770
 it is not even molds but there is only 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.530
 cream knows the funniest and bizarre 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.780
 those that you stop and think are serious 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.940
 This is for good and for bad, right? 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.309
 of course we still have few ways by which 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.140
 gta5 at the end of the scripts universe 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.850
 was hardly explored, but the 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.520
 few are all heading for 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.980
 in a while we have millions and 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.590
 ridiculous bizarre motorcycles millions 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.019
 illegal - gta5 just as it was in gta 4 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.339
 that sandy used gta san andreas 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.530
 heger after the rains 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.630
 after just over a month that the gta5 of 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.549
 pc is there but nevertheless have arisen 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.439
 some cool and bizarre ways to 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.880
 you have more fun than the game already 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.700
 that makes it possible 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.070
 see there are only two sides of this coin the 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.320
 good anyway these modes greatly increase the 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.240
 game life left gta san andreas 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.920
 To prove this , there is a side 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.509
 bad too old that will get too much 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:32.340
 people trying to use motorbikes to 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:35.610
 benefit in the online mode is attentive and 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.049
 You're sure to ban these cheaters. 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.270
 but I do not want to get into this 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.189
 it's also what matters is today's video 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.530
 where you will check a selection of 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.420
 wonders of modelers in years 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.430
 programmers independent of our 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.920
 internet channels is one 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.680
 the world's computer network goes like 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.270
 many know gta fire scripts are 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.149
 encrypted so for now 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.520
 skins cars buildings modeled objects 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.020
 are appearing very slowly but 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.180
 anyway you can do some 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.040
 cool things with which the game that 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.079
 offers these first molds that 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:10.200
 The 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:12.569
 existing scripts ie they 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.459
 modify the game with what already exists 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:16.349
 in it so it already appears in those molds 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:18.510
 that allow you to switch between 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:20.549
 have a speedometer to control 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.530
 speed is always important for 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:24.959
 not to impose fines on the possibility of 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.609
 the arrows or the native trainer that sends 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:28.319
 Youtube already said so I'm not going 

00:02:26.609 --> 00:02:30.540
 I go deeper into this subject more 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:32.609
 summarizing with this motto you can ride 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.680
 to schin the characters and play with 

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:37.079
 any player of the game or even 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.599
 to spread cars teleport change the weather 

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:41.579
 among many other functions within this 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:43.499
 concept comes out a very cool way 

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:45.659
 maybe more bizarre so far 

00:02:43.499 --> 00:02:48.329
 in his weapons instead of firing 

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:51.000
 bullets fires a vehicle 

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:52.769
 It's funny because he's so bizarre. 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.930
 each of the weapons that have already been 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:57.569
 exist in the arsenal to change their 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.250
 ammunition by vehicles type machine guns 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:01.260
 They fired small cars all over 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.419
 speed obviously while rifles of 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.379
 accuracy trigger larger and larger 

00:03:03.419 --> 00:03:06.329
 heavier 

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:08.040
 the only problem is to use a milligan 

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:09.810
 final with so many speed out 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.689
 cars some of them end up coming back 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:15.150
 against yourself and can kill you 

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:17.159
 out but I run well you have one 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:21.739
 beautiful pyrotechnic show since when the 

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:21.739
 cars crash on the others they explode 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:29.250
 in this same style there is another way that 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:31.019
 replaces bullets with animals is old 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.780
 when you think they have reached the 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:35.759
 Bizarre limit everything gets worse or better 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.560
 on the issue of perspective 

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:39.569
 but I installed this template in my 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.790
 way and even because I'm not much fan 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:45.090
 of deaths must be very cool to face 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:46.919
 policemen with pigs the shark arms 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:50.549
 wheel should still be hunting animals 

00:03:46.919 --> 00:03:53.790
 obviously not throwing animals half 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:55.229
 ironic but funny, nice, cool 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.969
 has in the square is one that you have to 

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:59.819
 possibility of becoming a carrier 

00:03:56.969 --> 00:04:01.769
 the car does not understand the spirit 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:03.930
 Did you ever think if your character was 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:06.329
 carrier of a lethal virus where only 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:09.329
 he was monitors around him dying 

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:11.269
 yes, breathing the same air is exactly 

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:14.099
 this you can do with the mold 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:16.289
 infection, your character is with 

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:19.169
 unknown virus where everyone at your 

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:22.480
 died within a radius of 50 meters but 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:24.550
 excellent tool to help you 

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:26.890
 police approach mom if you 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:28.930
 want to play the script in the city 

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:30.880
 another very simple modification 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:32.950
 been successful is helping some 

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.540
 youtube terrorists who want to see the 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:37.060
 which has inside the mountains building and 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:38.560
 tetra is the long clip that allows 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:41.410
 You navigate the whole game. 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:43.570
 horizontally and vertically upwards 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:46.390
 down all directions 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:48.430
 exploring where what you want your 

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:50.710
 character is a crazy puppet'm 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:53.380
 connected and becomes paralyzed and the whole game 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:55.060
 it seems that it loses its applied physics the 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:56.890
 which allows you to go to the 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:59.790
 subsoil in case you want between mountains 

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:01.000
 buildings as I said at last is everything 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:04.090
 judged 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.890
 it seems but it is not place and this way is a 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:08.290
 in the face of the society who said that 

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:10.630
 only Rosberg who was not holding us 5 

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:13.000
 in two years right 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:15.280
 It's actually he's not really into that. 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.260
 death this change change skindo 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:19.000
 trevor from the left the only one 

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:21.370
 The only problem is that everything is half 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.590
 out of context is but for who 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:25.660
 puts the modification in a game with 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:27.520
 Text is what matters least is even 

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:29.980
 another problem is the facial expressions 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:31.570
 which do not exist since the motto is only 

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:33.220
 a model made on top of the 

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:35.680
 true character right? 

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:37.630
 Trevor is still worth your while 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.410
 install if you just want to 

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:40.150
 dirt right 

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:43.030
 in this branch of corners we already have 

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:43.840
 a useful foot skind with the same problem as 

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:45.910
 nircco né 

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:47.770
 But for those who enjoy death, you're happy. 

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:50.290
 to know that this is the beginning of 

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:52.090
 modeling in gt so in a few 

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:53.890
 months we will have Brazilian cars and all 

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:56.080
 that fairy galley we saw in the others 

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:57.700
 mainly in the Senate and only 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:59.830
 to see and analyze and give a taste of 

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:03.040
 tosquice things to come have a way of 

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:04.450
 dragon but it is not a dragon that you 

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:06.640
 puts in the car game 

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:09.580
 This mole your character can spit. 

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:11.080
 fire and left destroying everything around you 

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:13.780
 I believe this is the first motto 

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:15.850
 more joke that left by gta5 right? 

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:18.370
 but within a few months we will have 

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:20.710
 I already said millions of deaths 

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:23.020
 joking for you to have fun leaving the 

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:24.300
 your game looking like a crazy rave party 

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:26.890
 chapter 

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:28.690
 good guys this video today if you guys 

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:30.640
 like you already know who is the 

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:32.260
 favorite to strengthen the work of the 

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:34.000
 Tag Fight 

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:35.860
 if you like my channel and not yet 

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.570
 are enrolled if you sign up there 

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:39.040

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:41.020
 is going out and gives a 

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:43.750
 previous videos will also enjoy 

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:45.550
 It was worth a minute to determine this video. 

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:46.510
 I want to indicate two channels every two 

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:48.640
 My friends 

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:51.130
 the first is the xingu the channel channel 

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:53.470
 out a study without his name is the chin 

00:06:51.130 --> 00:06:55.930
 name of transvestite but not 

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:56.710
 I do not think he does not do it during 

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:59.230
 Night I do not know 

00:06:56.710 --> 00:07:01.240
 and the second is the channel of the Julian channel 

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:03.820
 nerd game hack has a lot of content about 

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:05.920
 Two channel games are two very 

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:07.780
 good content for you that is 

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:10.030
 tired of this sameness you see in the 

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:12.400
 youtube beauty then I'll leave the links 

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:14.110
 of their channels here in the description you 

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:16.150
 click on one checked if you like 

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:17.710
 of the content of those 

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:20.350
 they are fucking foul 

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:23.700
 Okay, this is it, thanks. 

00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:23.700
 even them
