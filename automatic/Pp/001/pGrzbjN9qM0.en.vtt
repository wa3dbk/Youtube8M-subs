00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
contraband or a lot of the ride bindings

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:08.780 
contraband or a lot of the ride bindings
they're<00:00:07.200> gonna<00:00:07.319> have<00:00:07.560> an<00:00:07.770> anodized<00:00:08.219> aluminum

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
they're gonna have an anodized aluminum

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.360 
they're gonna have an anodized aluminum
base<00:00:08.940> plate<00:00:09.349> obviously<00:00:10.349> your<00:00:10.710> weight<00:00:10.889> saving

base plate obviously your weight saving

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:12.680 
base plate obviously your weight saving
there's<00:00:11.580> gonna<00:00:11.730> be<00:00:11.880> really<00:00:12.120> really<00:00:12.330> good

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
there's gonna be really really good

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:14.900 
there's gonna be really really good
your<00:00:13.200> rigidity<00:00:13.740> response<00:00:14.309> is<00:00:14.549> gonna<00:00:14.730> be

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
your rigidity response is gonna be

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.540 
your rigidity response is gonna be
really<00:00:15.120> really<00:00:15.360> good<00:00:15.660> and<00:00:16.650> the<00:00:16.890> durability<00:00:17.279> is

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
really really good and the durability is

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.700 
really really good and the durability is
on<00:00:17.880> point<00:00:18.210> but<00:00:18.449> you<00:00:19.050> shouldn't<00:00:19.289> be<00:00:19.350> scared

on point but you shouldn't be scared
away<00:00:19.830> by<00:00:20.160> a<00:00:20.190> plastic<00:00:20.730> binding<00:00:21.090> used<00:00:21.720> to<00:00:21.779> be

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
away by a plastic binding used to be

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.390 
away by a plastic binding used to be
more<00:00:22.050> of<00:00:22.109> a<00:00:22.170> separating<00:00:22.619> factor<00:00:23.010> between<00:00:23.189> the

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
more of a separating factor between the

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.130 
more of a separating factor between the
durability<00:00:23.699> of<00:00:23.910> plastic<00:00:24.390> versus<00:00:24.689> metal<00:00:24.869> but

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
durability of plastic versus metal but

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.509 
durability of plastic versus metal but
nowadays<00:00:25.529> that<00:00:25.769> difference<00:00:26.070> is<00:00:26.220> really

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
nowadays that difference is really

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.250 
nowadays that difference is really
really<00:00:27.269> nil<00:00:28.910> from<00:00:29.910> their<00:00:30.119> baseplate<00:00:30.810> padding

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
really nil from their baseplate padding

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.389 
really nil from their baseplate padding
you'll<00:00:32.099> see<00:00:32.340> both<00:00:33.269> on<00:00:33.510> top<00:00:33.840> and<00:00:34.290> on<00:00:35.219> the<00:00:35.250> bottom

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
you'll see both on top and on the bottom

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.840 
you'll see both on top and on the bottom
of<00:00:35.910> most<00:00:36.239> bindings<00:00:37.130> you<00:00:38.130> know<00:00:38.219> obviously<00:00:38.760> as

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
of most bindings you know obviously as

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.340 
of most bindings you know obviously as
you<00:00:39.000> go<00:00:39.120> up<00:00:39.149> higher<00:00:39.480> you're<00:00:39.780> gonna<00:00:39.899> get<00:00:40.110> more

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
you go up higher you're gonna get more

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.920 
you go up higher you're gonna get more
padding<00:00:41.100> in<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.520> baseplate<00:00:41.940> and<00:00:42.629> you<00:00:42.719> got<00:00:42.840> to

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
padding in the baseplate and you got to

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.030 
padding in the baseplate and you got to
think<00:00:42.989> of<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.170> padding<00:00:43.559> it's<00:00:43.710> kind<00:00:43.860> of<00:00:43.890> like

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
think of the padding it's kind of like

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.709 
think of the padding it's kind of like
your<00:00:44.160> shock<00:00:44.399> absorbers<00:00:45.000> for<00:00:45.210> this<00:00:45.360> system

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
your shock absorbers for this system

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.569 
your shock absorbers for this system
obviously<00:00:46.590> if<00:00:46.680> you're<00:00:46.800> riding<00:00:46.950> a<00:00:47.070> lot<00:00:47.219> of<00:00:47.280> icy

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
obviously if you're riding a lot of icy

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.369 
obviously if you're riding a lot of icy

hard packed rain figure out do you know

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.080 
hard packed rain figure out do you know
a<00:00:49.410> lot<00:00:49.530> of<00:00:49.590> big<00:00:49.890> jumps<00:00:50.280> you<00:00:50.579> know<00:00:50.670> with<00:00:50.910> you

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
a lot of big jumps you know with you

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.970 
a lot of big jumps you know with you

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
know impact on the landing you're gonna

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.290 
know impact on the landing you're gonna
want<00:00:53.219> to<00:00:53.250> look<00:00:53.370> for<00:00:53.610> something<00:00:53.940> that's<00:00:54.120> got

you know some more padding to the

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.189 
you know some more padding to the
baseplate<00:00:56.640> maybe<00:00:57.329> looking<00:00:57.660> for<00:00:57.840> something

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199

traditional mounting system which most
of<00:05:02.270> the<00:05:02.330> industry<00:05:02.810> still<00:05:03.199> uses<00:05:03.620> it's<00:05:04.129> gonna

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:04.280 
of the industry still uses it's gonna

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.939 
of the industry still uses it's gonna
have<00:05:04.580> a<00:05:04.849> whole<00:05:05.210> Center<00:05:05.659> so<00:05:06.229> the<00:05:06.349> disc<00:05:06.590> is<00:05:06.770> gonna

00:05:06.939 --> 00:05:06.949 
have a whole Center so the disc is gonna

00:05:06.949 --> 00:05:09.100 
have a whole Center so the disc is gonna
go<00:05:07.099> into<00:05:07.280> this<00:05:07.819> attaches<00:05:08.330> via<00:05:08.479> three<00:05:08.780> or<00:05:08.900> four

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:09.110 
go into this attaches via three or four

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:12.129 
go into this attaches via three or four
screws<00:05:09.500> and<00:05:10.240> with<00:05:11.240> that<00:05:11.449> disc<00:05:11.719> you'll<00:05:11.930> be<00:05:12.050> able

00:05:12.129 --> 00:05:12.139 
screws and with that disc you'll be able

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:14.589 
screws and with that disc you'll be able
to<00:05:12.319> determine<00:05:12.590> your<00:05:12.860> rotation<00:05:13.550> the<00:05:14.210> what

00:05:14.589 --> 00:05:14.599 
to determine your rotation the what

00:05:14.599 --> 00:05:16.240 
to determine your rotation the what
insert<00:05:14.990> you<00:05:15.110> line<00:05:15.289> it<00:05:15.440> up<00:05:15.530> on<00:05:15.680> will<00:05:15.919> determine

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:16.250 
insert you line it up on will determine

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:18.399 
insert you line it up on will determine
the<00:05:16.490> width<00:05:16.789> of<00:05:17.000> the<00:05:17.180> setup<00:05:17.509> and<00:05:17.750> then<00:05:18.199> you<00:05:18.289> can

00:05:18.399 --> 00:05:18.409 
the width of the setup and then you can

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:20.439 
the width of the setup and then you can
also<00:05:18.590> orientate<00:05:19.340> the<00:05:19.520> slots<00:05:19.819> of<00:05:19.969> the<00:05:20.030> disc<00:05:20.300> to

00:05:20.439 --> 00:05:20.449 
also orientate the slots of the disc to

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:23.409 
also orientate the slots of the disc to
fine-tune<00:05:20.930> for<00:05:21.199> a<00:05:21.229> toe<00:05:21.440> to<00:05:21.500> heel<00:05:21.889> or<00:05:22.240> nose<00:05:23.240> the

I mentioned dead spots previously in the
board<00:05:48.770> this<00:05:49.279> one<00:05:49.490> is<00:05:49.580> gonna<00:05:49.699> be<00:05:49.909> the<00:05:49.940> best<00:05:50.210> as

00:05:50.469 --> 00:05:50.479 
board this one is gonna be the best as

00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:52.209 
board this one is gonna be the best as
far<00:05:50.690> as<00:05:50.779> allow<00:05:50.960> the<00:05:51.319> board<00:05:51.529> to<00:05:51.620> flex<00:05:51.949> really

00:05:52.209 --> 00:05:52.219 
far as allow the board to flex really

00:05:52.219 --> 00:05:54.909 
far as allow the board to flex really
smoothly<00:05:52.669> underneath<00:05:53.500> obviously<00:05:54.500> unique<00:05:54.800> it

00:05:54.909 --> 00:05:54.919 
smoothly underneath obviously unique it

00:05:54.919 --> 00:05:58.119 
smoothly underneath obviously unique it
is<00:05:55.360> substantial<00:05:56.360> weight<00:05:56.569> savings<00:05:57.080> not<00:05:57.680> having

00:05:58.119 --> 00:05:58.129 
is substantial weight savings not having

00:05:58.129 --> 00:06:00.550 
is substantial weight savings not having
all<00:05:58.430> that<00:05:58.610> hard<00:05:58.819> plastic<00:05:59.000> there<00:05:59.539> and<00:06:00.289> you've

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:00.560 
all that hard plastic there and you've

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.230 
all that hard plastic there and you've
increased<00:06:00.860> your<00:06:01.069> cushion<00:06:01.550> having<00:06:01.879> it<00:06:01.969> all<00:06:02.090> be

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:02.240 
increased your cushion having it all be

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:04.360 
increased your cushion having it all be
foam<00:06:02.479> and<00:06:02.810> at<00:06:02.990> the<00:06:03.080> same<00:06:03.229> time<00:06:03.560> you<00:06:04.129> get<00:06:04.190> way

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:04.370 
foam and at the same time you get way

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:06.790 
foam and at the same time you get way
better<00:06:04.550> board<00:06:04.909> feel<00:06:05.270> you<00:06:05.930> can<00:06:06.050> feel<00:06:06.319> the<00:06:06.560> snow

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:06.800 
better board feel you can feel the snow

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.200 
better board feel you can feel the snow
through<00:06:07.159> the<00:06:07.310> board<00:06:07.520> you<00:06:07.610> can<00:06:07.729> feel<00:06:07.940> what<00:06:08.090> the

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:08.210 
through the board you can feel what the

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:09.999 
through the board you can feel what the
board<00:06:08.419> is<00:06:08.449> doing<00:06:08.569> a<00:06:08.930> little<00:06:09.469> bit<00:06:09.650> better<00:06:09.770> than

00:06:09.999 --> 00:06:10.009 
board is doing a little bit better than

00:06:10.009 --> 00:06:11.379 
board is doing a little bit better than
the<00:06:10.069> system<00:06:10.279> like<00:06:10.550> this<00:06:10.759> where<00:06:11.000> that<00:06:11.120> hard

00:06:11.379 --> 00:06:11.389 
the system like this where that hard

00:06:11.389 --> 00:06:13.450 
the system like this where that hard
plastic<00:06:11.569> is<00:06:12.020> really<00:06:12.050> kind<00:06:12.440> of<00:06:12.529> dampening<00:06:13.250> that

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:13.460 
plastic is really kind of dampening that

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:17.200 
plastic is really kind of dampening that
feel<00:06:13.819> another<00:06:14.810> great<00:06:15.080> thing<00:06:15.289> about<00:06:15.440> the<00:06:16.210> est

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:17.210 
feel another great thing about the est

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:19.600 
feel another great thing about the est
bindings<00:06:17.599> is<00:06:17.779> their<00:06:18.110> adjustability<00:06:18.710> while

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:19.610 
bindings is their adjustability while

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:22.029 
bindings is their adjustability while
your<00:06:19.789> foot<00:06:20.060> is<00:06:20.240> in<00:06:20.479> the<00:06:20.629> binding<00:06:21.050> you<00:06:21.860> can

00:07:02.219 --> 00:07:02.229 
right now these are pretty much the two

00:07:02.229 --> 00:07:04.439 
right now these are pretty much the two
options<00:07:02.860> you<00:07:03.009> have<00:07:03.190> but<00:07:03.490> with<00:07:03.940> the<00:07:04.030> popularity

00:07:04.439 --> 00:07:04.449 
options you have but with the popularity

00:07:04.449 --> 00:07:05.909 
options you have but with the popularity
of<00:07:04.630> this<00:07:04.840> system<00:07:05.199> I<00:07:05.289> wouldn't<00:07:05.500> be<00:07:05.560> surprised

00:07:05.909 --> 00:07:05.919 
of this system I wouldn't be surprised

00:07:05.919 --> 00:07:08.279 
of this system I wouldn't be surprised
if<00:07:06.039> other<00:07:06.220> companies<00:07:06.539> jump<00:07:07.539> into<00:07:07.870> it<00:07:07.900> later<00:07:08.110> on

00:07:08.279 --> 00:07:08.289 
if other companies jump into it later on

00:07:08.289 --> 00:07:11.730 
if other companies jump into it later on
but<00:07:09.100> same<00:07:10.030> kind<00:07:10.270> of<00:07:10.300> thing<00:07:10.509> follows<00:07:11.199> two<00:07:11.440> for

00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:11.740 
but same kind of thing follows two for
