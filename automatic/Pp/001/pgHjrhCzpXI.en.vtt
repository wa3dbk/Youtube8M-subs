apple but right when you go up here it's

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.080 
apple but right when you go up here it's
the<00:00:54.300> top<00:00:54.570> of<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:54.989> nether<00:00:55.230> you<00:00:55.590> could<00:00:55.769> call<00:00:56.010> it

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:56.090 
the top of the nether you could call it

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.180 
the top of the nether you could call it
I<00:00:57.090> don't<00:00:57.510> know<00:00:57.600> if<00:00:57.929> mugging<00:00:58.440> attention<00:00:59.039> this

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
I don't know if mugging attention this

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.369 
I don't know if mugging attention this
to<00:00:59.399> be<00:00:59.550> here<00:00:59.820> but<00:01:00.390> if<00:01:00.570> they<00:01:00.719> did<00:01:00.929> it<00:01:01.170> is<00:01:01.350> a

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
to be here but if they did it is a

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.770 
to be here but if they did it is a
pretty<00:01:01.829> cool<00:01:02.460> easter<00:01:02.969> egg<00:01:03.059> you<00:01:03.359> could<00:01:03.539> call<00:01:03.750> it

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
pretty cool easter egg you could call it

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.990 
pretty cool easter egg you could call it
I<00:01:04.019> guess<00:01:04.940> this<00:01:05.960> miss<00:01:06.960> way<00:01:07.200> it<00:01:07.830> resets<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.700> sky

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
I guess this miss way it resets the sky

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.270 
I guess this miss way it resets the sky
limit<00:01:09.360> so<00:01:09.540> you<00:01:09.630> can<00:01:09.750> actually<00:01:09.900> build<00:01:10.280> 256

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
limit so you can actually build 256

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.000 
limit so you can actually build 256
blocks<00:01:11.580> up<00:01:11.850> from<00:01:12.180> this<00:01:12.480> bed<00:01:12.960> rock<00:01:13.680> right<00:01:13.980> here

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
blocks up from this bed rock right here

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.150 
blocks up from this bed rock right here
and<00:01:14.580> I'll<00:01:15.030> be<00:01:15.210> example<00:01:15.750> in<00:01:15.870> that<00:01:15.900> in<00:01:16.770> a<00:01:17.040> little

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:17.160 
and I'll be example in that in a little

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.600 
and I'll be example in that in a little
bit<00:01:17.340> but<00:01:18.110> you<00:01:19.110> can<00:01:19.350> use<00:01:20.130> this<00:01:20.280> to<00:01:20.490> your

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
bit but you can use this to your

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.550 
bit but you can use this to your
advantage<00:01:20.670> you<00:01:21.330> can<00:01:21.360> make<00:01:21.690> bases<00:01:22.170> up<00:01:22.320> here

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
advantage you can make bases up here

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.070 
advantage you can make bases up here
most<00:01:23.130> people<00:01:23.430> don't<00:01:23.550> know<00:01:23.730> about<00:01:23.760> this<00:01:24.120> that

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
most people don't know about this that

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.650 
most people don't know about this that
i'll<00:01:25.200> give<00:01:25.350> you<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.740> hidden<00:01:26.280> edge<00:01:26.660> when

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:27.660 
i'll give you the hidden edge when

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:29.720 
i'll give you the hidden edge when
you're<00:01:27.780> building<00:01:27.930> a<00:01:28.140> base<00:01:28.290> what<00:01:28.830> if<00:01:29.430> it's<00:01:29.670> like

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:29.730 
you're building a base what if it's like

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:32.240 
you're building a base what if it's like
a<00:01:29.850> survival<00:01:30.510> or<00:01:30.720> its<00:01:31.110> factions<00:01:31.680> or<00:01:31.860> whatever

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
a survival or its factions or whatever

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.500 
a survival or its factions or whatever
it<00:01:32.400> is<00:01:32.550> but<00:01:33.380> it's<00:01:34.380> basically<00:01:34.590> all<00:01:35.300> to<00:01:36.300> this

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:36.510 
it is but it's basically all to this

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:40.340 
it is but it's basically all to this
video<00:01:37.820> not<00:01:38.820> really<00:01:38.880> much<00:01:39.450> more<00:01:39.720> to<00:01:39.900> explain

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
video not really much more to explain

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.450 
video not really much more to explain
not<00:01:40.650> more<00:01:40.860> too

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
not more too
