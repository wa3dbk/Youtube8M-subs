00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
so the result was that the pivot

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.070 
so the result was that the pivot
frog<00:01:27.840> so<00:01:28.200> people<00:01:28.650> frog<00:01:29.180> basically<00:01:30.180> use<00:01:30.900> the

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:31.080 
frog so people frog basically use the

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.750 
frog so people frog basically use the
gravity<00:01:31.290> hook<00:01:31.650> system<00:01:32.070> we<00:01:32.280> have<00:01:32.370> already<00:01:32.520> on

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:32.760 
gravity hook system we have already on

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.270 
gravity hook system we have already on
the<00:01:32.850> DNS<00:01:33.119> crank<00:01:33.479> that<00:01:33.659> means<00:01:33.840> when<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.680> bus<00:01:34.860> or

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
the DNS crank that means when the bus or

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.250 
the DNS crank that means when the bus or
I<00:01:35.340> never<00:01:35.640> fish<00:01:35.909> you<00:01:36.119> can<00:01:36.299> try<00:01:36.479> that<00:01:36.630> on<00:01:36.690> calicos

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:37.260 
I never fish you can try that on calicos
