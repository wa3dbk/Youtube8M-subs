00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:28.280 
because these things are probably good
for<00:03:22.610> 10<00:03:23.610> years<00:03:23.910> to<00:03:24.120> be<00:03:24.239> honest<00:03:25.160> so<00:03:26.989> you<00:03:27.989> can<00:03:28.140> get

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
for 10 years to be honest so you can get

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.289 
for 10 years to be honest so you can get
these<00:03:28.410> at<00:03:28.470> Walmart<00:03:29.040> I<00:03:29.190> haven't<00:03:29.730> seen<00:03:29.970> them<00:03:30.060> any

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
these at Walmart I haven't seen them any

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:32.660 
these at Walmart I haven't seen them any
other<00:03:30.540> stores<00:03:30.840> so<00:03:31.170> far<00:03:31.500> I'm<00:03:31.890> sure<00:03:32.310> they're<00:03:32.519> out

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
other stores so far I'm sure they're out

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:34.910 
other stores so far I'm sure they're out
there<00:03:32.880> are<00:03:32.940> other<00:03:33.090> places<00:03:33.390> but<00:03:33.870> I<00:03:34.170> think<00:03:34.829> these

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
there are other places but I think these

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.479 
there are other places but I think these
are<00:03:34.980> definitely<00:03:35.220> a<00:03:35.489> good<00:03:35.910> replacement<00:03:36.299> for

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:37.489 
are definitely a good replacement for

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:40.190 
are definitely a good replacement for
