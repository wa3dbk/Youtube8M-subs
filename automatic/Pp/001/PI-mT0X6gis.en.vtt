00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 hola soy Montse Maria del Rio post 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:05.819
 personal training today I'm going to teach you 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.470
 four very simple exercises for 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:08.970
 Buttocks so you can work on 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.240
 your house in the first exercise 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:14.519
 we are going to use some weights that we have 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.379
 by house some dumbbells or any 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.350
 reduces if the exercise is to consist 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.960
 in performing a squat or a flex 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.760
 on your knees let's start keeping 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.340
 the feet shoulder width a 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.960
 little separated between them once 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.720
 I hope before new placed we will begin 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.099
 to go down gently down 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.660
 flexing the knees by tilting a 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.790
 little bit of back forwards to 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.440
 maintain balance once you 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.220
 There is how the position has been reached 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.430
 horizontal 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:45.410
 we will go back to the beginning and repeat the 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.270
 sequence well you see that it is a 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:48.710
 very easy exercise well then now 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.130
 what we are going to worry about is 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:54.110
 perform three sets of 15 repetitions 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:57.190
 with a rest interval of about 20 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.190
 to 30 seconds 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:09.890
 for exercise number 2 only 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.450
 we need a wall we are going to make 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.600
 a gluteal flexion we're going to 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:16.340
 work well we will place ourselves in the middle 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.280
 wall meter supporting both hands 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:22.790
 in it the support leg we are going to 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.860
 keep on bending well and leg with 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.960
 the one that we're going to work in the air a 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.240
 once we have the leg raised 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.710
 we will perform an evolution flex 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.740
 well the tour does not have to be very 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.110
 long 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:39.720
 we go back to the starting position and 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:42.540
 we repeat this exercise is going to have a 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:45.720
 work of three series of 15 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:49.610
 repetitions with each leg with a 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.610
 rest from 20 to 30 seconds 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.910
 in the third exercise we are going to make a 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.830
 composite series for the work of 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:03.930
 gluteus which is a composite series let's 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:06.590
 let's see 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.850
 well we start kneeling on the floor 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.590
 with hands or elbows 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:13.739
 supported 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.599
 and what we are going to do is a flexion of 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:17.819
 gluteus let's start with the first 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:21.200
 movement we raise the leg 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:24.110
 flexing the gluteus let's go up 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.880
 and we reintroduce the knee 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:29.920
 under the chest 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:32.680
 we go up and reintroduce 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:35.230
 I go back up and I stay up 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.910
 we reflect the knee and now we are going to 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:41.099
 perform very short movements 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:41.099
 but very strong for blond work 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.860
 and here we made the series composed of 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:50.520
 two exercises 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:53.220
 raised from the knee stretched subway 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:56.400
 under the chest stretch put under the 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:59.360
 chest that sweat flexes knee and 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.360
 three small strokes 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.420
 and down 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:07.450
 we have to be able to perform three 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:10.569
 series of 20 repetitions between the two 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:14.010
 Exercises already know each other as a series 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:14.010
 a 30- second rest 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.250
 we go in the fourth and last 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:28.010
 exercise in this exercise we are going to 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:30.320
 work pelvic lifts for this 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:32.840
 exercise we need a mat or 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:35.870
 We put a towel on the floor and 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:38.300
 we start from lying down we will support 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:40.520
 hands stretched on the ground we support 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:42.160
 the soles of the feet and knees and 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:44.120
 very important that you look towards the ceiling 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:46.370
 here we will start doing what 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.740
 next we take off the gluteus from the floor 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:49.370
 and we lift the pelvis all that we 

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:51.950
 may be possible 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.709
 up we hold two seconds and 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:56.090
 we return to the initial position 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:59.010
 important that we do not touch the 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:04.799
 soil and we repeat them 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:07.019
 going down and repeating well for the latter 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:09.780
 exercise what we are going to work on are 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:11.640
 three sets of 20 repetitions with one 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:13.670
 rest interval of about 30 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.670
 seconds 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.980
 well you 've seen four singles 

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:26.430
