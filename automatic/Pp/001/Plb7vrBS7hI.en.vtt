00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.560
 very good and that we are not in the case 

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:15.030
 what happens w21 

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:16.920
 and we're going to present you with a new map for 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.500
 this version called spend interest a 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.600
 superchule map consisting of painting 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.939
 to the zombie that we have right behind 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.590
 mine and it's going to be in a very 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.660
 special first of all everything is done 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.980
 with commands and most for the 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.900
 last in nachos so I 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.290
 I recommend that the last one in the 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.699
 21 b since good because it will give less 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.920
 mistakes and there's everything much better not 

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:39.330
 so here we have apart from the 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.120
 commands that we will not look at because they are 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:44.010
 very advanced for me because we have the 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.750
 layers that are going to make clones and so on and 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.820
 I have to paint zombie in this way 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.170
 then as you can see here we have all 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.080
 the possible layers that are going to be 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.120
 comparisons and everything else and here 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:56.790
 we have the colors is worth then how 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.409
 the way to paint this works 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:01.470
 we're just going to give it a color 

00:00:58.409 --> 00:01:04.890
 Right click and it will not lose a load 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:06.720
 super large ethnic group and above we have the 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.979
 piece of color nothing that we 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.780
 let's paint then for example 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.400
 we give you left click and what 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.430
 we throw to where we want this 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.870
 case we're going to throw it towards the zombie and 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.330
 let's paint it in the way that 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:18.670
 we 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.380
 we can do it as the face gives us 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.960
 really as if for example we want 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:25.360
 do it like that and we painted the face of 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:28.060
 blue we paint him, I do not know, let's see 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:31.000
 I hate you this is broken the button I'm going to 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:33.880
 give it is but I will give it to you with the 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.920
 wool is in the arm for example here come 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:39.700
 that we already have a social arm we have 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:42.460
 for example the other gray arm and 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:46.240
 legs full green I'll give you to see 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:48.130
 yes I can perfect good more or less and you 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.130
 I have given the shirt should give 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:55.180
 also to gray and finally to the boots 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:02:00.250
 for blue not one there and the other 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:02:02.110
 towards to see if I can there perfect good 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.210
 As you can see, this is totally wrong 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:07.150
 zombie is not like this therefore we have not 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:09.100
 won this game or minigame as 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:10.270
 you want to call him but if we paint him 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.390
 well you are going to see what is going to 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.390
 occur 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.500
 ok guys we owe our zombie already 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.110
 practically finished only us 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.960
 head missing and we will paint the 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:29.660
 so you can see when I give him what 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:32.000
 it's going to happen then we paint it out 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:35.060
 two rockets and finally we won like that 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.640
 is how you finish painting the zombie in 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.950
 this mini game and I think it's pretty 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.630
 cool, I think the way to 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.860
 what have they done coloring the zombie 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.710
 we can do it the way we 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.870
 please and can expand to many 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:50.000
 other minigames and others I think it's 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.800
 pretty cool because being like this the 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.630
 be as is really complete 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.130
 you can activate the signal of the rest that 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.690
 can activate any other 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.580
 therefore, it can be useful for a 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.200
 map of mini - games and many things 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.940
 more then I hope you liked it 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.640
 I think it's a pass even if it's 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.840
 only this and we liked to press 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:10.120
 the favorite x see you in the 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.120
 next video and see you later 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.000
 to 

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:24.210
