00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:18.189 
that a concern but yeah this fit t is a

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:20.849 
that a concern but yeah this fit t is a
blend<00:01:18.549> of<00:01:18.729> all<00:01:19.090> natural<00:01:19.569> ingredients<00:01:19.689> I<00:01:20.350> have

00:01:20.849 --> 00:01:20.859 
blend of all natural ingredients I have

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:24.029 
blend of all natural ingredients I have
to<00:01:21.009> be<00:01:21.159> very<00:01:21.399> careful<00:01:21.759> of<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:23.560> things<00:01:23.829> that<00:01:24.009> I

00:01:24.029 --> 00:01:24.039 
to be very careful of the things that I

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:25.889 
to be very careful of the things that I
take<00:01:24.429> like<00:01:24.759> the<00:01:24.909> different<00:01:25.270> teas<00:01:25.479> because<00:01:25.779> I

00:01:25.889 --> 00:01:25.899 
take like the different teas because I

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:28.440 
take like the different teas because I
can<00:01:26.229> have<00:01:26.469> any<00:01:26.740> caffeine<00:01:27.100> at<00:01:27.609> all<00:01:27.759> although

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450 
can have any caffeine at all although

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.449 
can have any caffeine at all although
sometimes<00:01:28.779> I<00:01:29.170> do<00:01:29.229> push<00:01:29.619> the<00:01:29.649> ticket<00:01:30.219> and<00:01:30.369> I

00:01:30.449 --> 00:01:30.459 
sometimes I do push the ticket and I

00:01:30.459 --> 00:01:32.370 
sometimes I do push the ticket and I
have<00:01:30.670> some<00:01:30.999> and<00:01:31.270> believe<00:01:31.600> me<00:01:31.749> I<00:01:31.779> feel<00:01:32.170> the

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
have some and believe me I feel the

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.129 
have some and believe me I feel the
effects<00:01:33.029> afterwards<00:01:34.029> of<00:01:34.209> having<00:01:34.539> caffeine<00:01:34.749> it

00:01:35.129 --> 00:01:35.139 
effects afterwards of having caffeine it

00:01:35.139 --> 00:01:36.899 
effects afterwards of having caffeine it
gives<00:01:35.319> me<00:01:35.439> like<00:01:35.590> a<00:01:35.619> little<00:01:35.829> palpitations<00:01:36.759> and

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:36.909 
gives me like a little palpitations and

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:39.029 
gives me like a little palpitations and
things<00:01:37.179> like<00:01:37.329> that<00:01:37.389> so<00:01:38.170> I<00:01:38.200> wanted<00:01:38.590> to<00:01:38.649> try<00:01:39.009> a

00:01:39.029 --> 00:01:39.039 
things like that so I wanted to try a

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:43.260 
things like that so I wanted to try a
tea<00:01:39.369> that<00:01:39.399> I<00:01:39.789> could<00:01:40.380> hopefully<00:01:41.939> not<00:01:42.939> have

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
tea that I could hopefully not have

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.410 
tea that I could hopefully not have
those<00:01:43.599> side<00:01:43.869> effects<00:01:44.229> because<00:01:44.619> even<00:01:44.979> though

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
those side effects because even though

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.089 
those side effects because even though
products<00:01:46.420> are<00:01:46.539> all-natural<00:01:47.049> sometimes<00:01:47.889> all

00:01:48.089 --> 00:01:48.099 
products are all-natural sometimes all

00:01:48.099 --> 00:01:49.830 
products are all-natural sometimes all
natural<00:01:48.549> ingredients<00:01:48.609> will<00:01:49.240> also<00:01:49.599> give<00:01:49.810> you

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
natural ingredients will also give you

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.289 
natural ingredients will also give you
those<00:01:50.200> little<00:01:50.439> palpitations<00:01:51.369> or<00:01:51.579> little

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:52.299 
those little palpitations or little

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:54.089 
those little palpitations or little
heart<00:01:52.630> racing<00:01:53.109> feelings<00:01:53.560> and<00:01:53.740> things<00:01:53.889> like

00:01:54.089 --> 00:01:54.099 
heart racing feelings and things like

00:01:54.099 --> 00:01:56.580 
heart racing feelings and things like
that<00:01:54.159> but<00:01:54.549> I<00:01:54.819> can<00:01:55.119> honestly<00:01:55.299> say<00:01:55.899> the<00:01:56.109> fit<00:01:56.349> tee

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590
