all<00:00:11.519> right<00:00:11.759> well<00:00:12.030> the<00:00:12.420> exhaust<00:00:12.780> systems<00:00:13.259> next

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
all right well the exhaust systems next

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.200 
all right well the exhaust systems next
we'll<00:00:14.130> put<00:00:14.340> the<00:00:14.429> vehicle<00:00:14.580> up<00:00:14.820> on<00:00:14.940> the<00:00:15.000> hoist

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
we'll put the vehicle up on the hoist

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:16.550 
we'll put the vehicle up on the hoist
and<00:00:15.570> have<00:00:15.780> a<00:00:15.809> look<00:00:15.990> underneath<00:00:16.260> of<00:00:16.529> that

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
and have a look underneath of that

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.769 
and have a look underneath of that
standard<00:00:17.190> exhaust<00:00:17.490> looks<00:00:18.180> like<00:00:18.420> it's<00:00:18.600> sitting

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
standard exhaust looks like it's sitting

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.779 
standard exhaust looks like it's sitting
pretty<00:00:19.109> low<00:00:19.350> that's<00:00:19.890> probably<00:00:20.220> not<00:00:20.400> too<00:00:20.609> good

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
pretty low that's probably not too good

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.820 
pretty low that's probably not too good
for<00:00:20.850> offroad<00:00:21.480> so<00:00:22.140> we'll<00:00:22.380> try<00:00:22.590> and<00:00:22.619> keep

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
for offroad so we'll try and keep

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.950 
for offroad so we'll try and keep
everything<00:00:23.010> as<00:00:23.369> high<00:00:23.580> as<00:00:23.640> we<00:00:23.910> can<00:00:24.180> we've<00:00:24.750> got<00:00:24.930> a

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
everything as high as we can we've got a

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.779 
everything as high as we can we've got a
pretty<00:00:25.199> big<00:00:25.289> three-inch<00:00:25.980> system<00:00:26.369> to<00:00:26.460> put<00:00:26.670> in

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
pretty big three-inch system to put in

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:27.230 
pretty big three-inch system to put in
there

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
there

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.790 
there
but<00:00:27.630> we're<00:00:27.930> sure<00:00:28.170> it<00:00:28.289> will<00:00:28.349> fit<00:00:28.529> in<00:00:28.650> there

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
but we're sure it will fit in there

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.070 
but we're sure it will fit in there
quite<00:00:29.010> nicely<00:00:29.699> the<00:00:30.240> section<00:00:30.630> I'm<00:00:30.720> holding

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
quite nicely the section I'm holding

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.569 
quite nicely the section I'm holding
here<00:00:31.199> pretty<00:00:31.439> much<00:00:31.529> comes<00:00:31.920> from<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.250> back<00:00:32.399> of

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
here pretty much comes from the back of

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.940 
here pretty much comes from the back of
the<00:00:32.640> turbocharger<00:00:33.510> so<00:00:34.079> we<00:00:34.649> have<00:00:34.800> their

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
the turbocharger so we have their

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.500 
the turbocharger so we have their
initial<00:00:35.160> sort<00:00:35.550> of<00:00:35.610> dump<00:00:35.880> pipe<00:00:36.090> as<00:00:36.300> it's

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
initial sort of dump pipe as it's

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.420 
initial sort of dump pipe as it's
commonly<00:00:36.660> called<00:00:37.200> we<00:00:37.890> have<00:00:37.980> a<00:00:38.010> catalytic

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
commonly called we have a catalytic

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.369 
commonly called we have a catalytic
converter<00:00:38.550> which<00:00:39.300> is<00:00:39.480> this<00:00:39.570> device<00:00:39.930> here<00:00:40.200> we

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
converter which is this device here we

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.080 
converter which is this device here we
keep<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.739> cat<00:00:40.950> in<00:00:41.100> so<00:00:41.280> we<00:00:41.399> keep<00:00:41.550> things<00:00:41.820> fairly

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
keep the cat in so we keep things fairly

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.020 
keep the cat in so we keep things fairly
legal<00:00:42.510> and<00:00:42.710> then<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:43.860> pipe<00:00:44.100> goes<00:00:44.370> down<00:00:44.670> into

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
legal and then the pipe goes down into

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.819 
legal and then the pipe goes down into
the<00:00:45.210> sort<00:00:45.510> of<00:00:45.570> a<00:00:45.660> resonator<00:00:46.140> which<00:00:46.379> is<00:00:46.530> just<00:00:46.710> a

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
the sort of a resonator which is just a

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.470 
the sort of a resonator which is just a
straight<00:00:47.070> through<00:00:47.309> system<00:00:47.760> to<00:00:47.879> capture<00:00:48.090> some

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
straight through system to capture some

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.450 
straight through system to capture some
more<00:00:48.690> noise<00:00:48.930> but<00:00:49.649> the<00:00:49.710> time<00:00:49.890> it<00:00:50.039> gets<00:00:50.129> out<00:00:50.340> the

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
more noise but the time it gets out the

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.670 
more noise but the time it gets out the
tailpipe<00:00:50.700> will<00:00:51.480> be<00:00:51.600> just<00:00:51.809> a<00:00:51.930> bit<00:00:51.960> of<00:00:52.170> a<00:00:52.199> low<00:00:52.379> hum

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
tailpipe will be just a bit of a low hum

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.380 
tailpipe will be just a bit of a low hum
and<00:00:52.860> after<00:00:53.100> that<00:00:53.219> all<00:00:53.340> you'll<00:00:53.489> be<00:00:53.579> getting<00:00:53.910> so

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
and after that all you'll be getting so

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.240 
and after that all you'll be getting so
there's<00:00:54.600> really<00:00:54.840> no<00:00:55.050> more<00:00:55.260> noise<00:00:55.469> effectively

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
there's really no more noise effectively

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.040 
there's really no more noise effectively
just<00:00:56.789> a<00:00:57.000> little<00:00:57.180> bit<00:00:57.270> of<00:00:57.329> low<00:00:57.480> drumming<00:00:57.930> that

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
just a little bit of low drumming that

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.510 
just a little bit of low drumming that
you<00:00:58.140> hear<00:00:58.320> outside<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.859> car<00:00:59.070> a<00:00:59.100> little<00:00:59.399> bit

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
you hear outside the car a little bit

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.389 
you hear outside the car a little bit
more<00:00:59.670> notes<00:00:59.969> I<00:01:00.149> guess<00:01:00.359> as<00:01:00.539> you<00:01:00.570> could<00:01:00.780> say

00:01:01.389 --> 00:01:01.399 
more notes I guess as you could say

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:03.740 
more notes I guess as you could say
we've<00:01:02.399> got<00:01:02.579> both<00:01:02.760> systems<00:01:03.239> here<00:01:03.449> we've<00:01:03.629> got

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
we've got both systems here we've got

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.140 
we've got both systems here we've got
the<00:01:03.899> Colorado<00:01:04.320> and<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.619> Colorado<00:01:05.010> seven<00:01:05.519> so

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
the Colorado and the Colorado seven so

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.240 
the Colorado and the Colorado seven so
Scott<00:01:06.479> at<00:01:06.600> Scott's<00:01:06.869> rods<00:01:07.140> came<00:01:07.439> round<00:01:07.710> and<00:01:08.040> saw

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
Scott at Scott's rods came round and saw

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.440 
Scott at Scott's rods came round and saw
us<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.460> other<00:01:08.520> week<00:01:08.790> and<00:01:08.970> dropped<00:01:09.119> them<00:01:09.299> off

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
us the other week and dropped them off

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.780 
us the other week and dropped them off
so<00:01:10.020> they<00:01:10.049> custom<00:01:10.560> build<00:01:10.770> systems<00:01:11.189> for<00:01:11.400> us<00:01:11.520> and

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
so they custom build systems for us and

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.340 
so they custom build systems for us and
here's<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.420> outcome<00:01:12.780> we'll<00:01:12.990> see<00:01:13.140> when<00:01:13.260> it

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
here's the outcome we'll see when it

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.090 
here's the outcome we'll see when it
comes<00:01:13.380> up<00:01:13.680> today

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.100 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.530 

okay<00:01:19.100> well<00:01:19.340> here<00:01:19.580> we<00:01:19.700> are<00:01:19.730> the<00:01:20.000> exhaust<00:01:20.330> is

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:20.540 
okay well here we are the exhaust is

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.150 
okay well here we are the exhaust is
finished<00:01:20.900> put<00:01:21.410> it<00:01:21.500> up<00:01:21.590> on<00:01:21.710> the<00:01:21.800> hoist<00:01:21.950> it

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:22.160 
finished put it up on the hoist it

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:23.680 
finished put it up on the hoist it
didn't<00:01:22.430> take<00:01:22.550> all<00:01:22.730> that<00:01:22.850> long<00:01:23.120> of<00:01:23.270> course<00:01:23.330> the

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:23.690 
didn't take all that long of course the

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:26.080 
didn't take all that long of course the
hardest<00:01:24.170> area<00:01:24.560> to<00:01:24.650> get<00:01:24.830> to<00:01:25.010> is<00:01:25.460> on<00:01:25.700> the<00:01:25.790> back<00:01:25.940> of

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
hardest area to get to is on the back of

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.110 
hardest area to get to is on the back of
the<00:01:26.180> turbo<00:01:26.570> very<00:01:27.320> very<00:01:27.560> tight<00:01:27.860> in<00:01:28.010> there<00:01:28.250> but

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:29.120 
the turbo very very tight in there but

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:30.790 
the turbo very very tight in there but
pretty<00:01:29.270> much<00:01:29.390> the<00:01:29.720> system<00:01:29.930> bolts<00:01:30.350> straight<00:01:30.650> on

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:30.800 
pretty much the system bolts straight on

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.440 
pretty much the system bolts straight on
to<00:01:30.890> the<00:01:30.980> back<00:01:31.130> of<00:01:31.280> the<00:01:31.370> turbo<00:01:31.700> charger<00:01:32.210> with<00:01:32.420> a

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
to the back of the turbo charger with a

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.420 
to the back of the turbo charger with a
special<00:01:32.870> flange<00:01:33.230> so<00:01:33.500> it's<00:01:33.620> a<00:01:33.680> nice<00:01:33.860> neat<00:01:34.190> fit

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 
special flange so it's a nice neat fit

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.700 
special flange so it's a nice neat fit
it<00:01:35.120> comes<00:01:35.360> down<00:01:35.630> through<00:01:36.050> to<00:01:36.230> a<00:01:36.260> catalytic

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
it comes down through to a catalytic

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.530 
it comes down through to a catalytic
converter<00:01:36.830> which<00:01:37.430> is<00:01:37.610> a<00:01:37.640> higher<00:01:37.880> flow<00:01:38.240> type

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:38.540 
converter which is a higher flow type

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.360 
converter which is a higher flow type
and<00:01:38.990> then<00:01:39.260> just<00:01:39.530> after<00:01:39.710> that<00:01:40.010> we've<00:01:40.190> got<00:01:40.340> a

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:40.370 
and then just after that we've got a

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:42.280 
and then just after that we've got a
nice<00:01:40.640> bracket<00:01:41.150> to<00:01:41.390> actually<00:01:41.720> hold<00:01:41.960> it<00:01:42.140> onto

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:42.290 
nice bracket to actually hold it onto

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:43.960 
nice bracket to actually hold it onto
the<00:01:42.470> engine<00:01:42.800> so<00:01:42.950> we<00:01:42.980> use<00:01:43.250> all<00:01:43.430> the<00:01:43.580> original

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
the engine so we use all the original

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.150 
the engine so we use all the original
brackets<00:01:44.420> bolt<00:01:45.290> back<00:01:45.500> onto<00:01:45.740> those<00:01:45.860> same

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:46.160 
brackets bolt back onto those same

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:47.770 
brackets bolt back onto those same
mounting<00:01:46.550> brackets<00:01:46.910> again<00:01:47.030> for<00:01:47.390> durability

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
mounting brackets again for durability

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.380 
mounting brackets again for durability
we've<00:01:48.710> got<00:01:48.890> very<00:01:49.130> heavy<00:01:49.310> corrugations<00:01:50.150> and

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
we've got very heavy corrugations and

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.660 
we've got very heavy corrugations and
roads<00:01:50.600> that<00:01:50.720> we<00:01:50.840> drive<00:01:51.110> on<00:01:51.290> in<00:01:51.410> Australia<00:01:52.010> we

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
roads that we drive on in Australia we

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.160 
roads that we drive on in Australia we
know<00:01:52.910> that<00:01:53.150> because<00:01:53.510> we've<00:01:53.690> been<00:01:53.900> out<00:01:54.140> in

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
know that because we've been out in

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:55.480 
know that because we've been out in
those<00:01:54.410> places<00:01:54.740> and<00:01:55.040> that's<00:01:55.190> one<00:01:55.340> of<00:01:55.430> the

chopped off and when they get chopped
off<00:02:38.540> they<00:02:38.690> don't<00:02:38.900> come<00:02:39.080> out<00:02:39.110> as<00:02:39.380> noisy

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
off they don't come out as noisy

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.650 
off they don't come out as noisy
remember<00:02:40.700> though<00:02:40.850> we've<00:02:41.180> been<00:02:41.360> through<00:02:41.600> a

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
remember though we've been through a

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.680 
remember though we've been through a
turbo<00:02:42.170> which<00:02:42.860> is<00:02:43.010> basically<00:02:43.430> like<00:02:43.730> a<00:02:43.760> meat

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
turbo which is basically like a meat

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.960 
turbo which is basically like a meat
mincer<00:02:45.140> all<00:02:45.620> the<00:02:45.860> exhaust<00:02:46.070> gases<00:02:46.610> come<00:02:46.820> to<00:02:46.940> a

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
mincer all the exhaust gases come to a

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
grinding halt and have to squeeze past

grinding halt and have to squeeze past
that<00:02:49.040> that<00:02:49.190> already<00:02:49.340> slows<00:02:49.760> the<00:02:50.450> exhaust

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
that that already slows the exhaust

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.440 
that that already slows the exhaust

further<00:02:55.550> again<00:02:55.970> well<00:02:56.540> the<00:02:56.630> time<00:02:56.840> it<00:02:56.959> gets<00:02:57.080> to

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
further again well the time it gets to

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.650 
further again well the time it gets to
here<00:02:57.590> it's<00:02:57.980> just<00:02:58.310> a<00:02:58.459> last<00:02:58.670> tail<00:02:59.030> in<00:02:59.269> that<00:02:59.570> we

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
here it's just a last tail in that we

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.600 
here it's just a last tail in that we
want<00:02:59.780> to<00:02:59.870> get<00:03:00.019> rid<00:03:00.200> of<00:03:00.230> so<00:03:00.890> again<00:03:00.920> out<00:03:01.310> the<00:03:01.459> back

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
want to get rid of so again out the back

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:03.640 
want to get rid of so again out the back
will<00:03:01.820> end<00:03:01.940> up<00:03:02.060> just<00:03:02.090> with<00:03:02.390> a<00:03:02.420> nice<00:03:02.750> note<00:03:03.110> but

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
will end up just with a nice note but

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.710 
will end up just with a nice note but
nothing<00:03:04.100> inside<00:03:04.459> droning<00:03:05.090> our<00:03:05.209> head<00:03:05.360> off<00:03:05.540> we

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
nothing inside droning our head off we

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.860 
nothing inside droning our head off we
definitely<00:03:06.140> don't<00:03:06.200> want<00:03:06.350> that<00:03:07.840> one<00:03:08.840> thing

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
definitely don't want that one thing

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:10.000 
definitely don't want that one thing
that<00:03:09.200> people<00:03:09.440> do<00:03:09.560> get<00:03:09.709> a<00:03:09.769> little<00:03:09.920> bit

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
that people do get a little bit

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:11.440 
that people do get a little bit
concerned<00:03:10.459> with<00:03:10.640> sometimes<00:03:11.090> with<00:03:11.239> a<00:03:11.269> new

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
concerned with sometimes with a new

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.020 
concerned with sometimes with a new
exhaust<00:03:11.780> it<00:03:12.080> is<00:03:12.260> bigger<00:03:12.560> it<00:03:12.860> does<00:03:13.340> flow<00:03:13.670> things

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
exhaust it is bigger it does flow things

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.630 
exhaust it is bigger it does flow things
a<00:03:14.150> little<00:03:14.239> bit<00:03:14.450> quicker<00:03:14.720> so<00:03:15.130> when<00:03:16.130> it's<00:03:16.310> new

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
a little bit quicker so when it's new
