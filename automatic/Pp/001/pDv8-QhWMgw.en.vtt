68<00:04:07.740> summoning<00:04:08.220> I<00:04:08.280> believe<00:04:08.520> and<00:04:10.040> but<00:04:11.040> he'll

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
68 summoning I believe and but he'll

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:15.170 
68 summoning I believe and but he'll
stir<00:04:11.490> HP<00:04:11.970> every<00:04:12.270> once<00:04:12.510> a<00:04:12.840> while<00:04:13.700> so<00:04:14.700> if<00:04:14.910> you<00:04:15.030> get

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
stir HP every once a while so if you get

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.150 
stir HP every once a while so if you get
hit<00:04:15.390> you<00:04:15.840> know<00:04:15.870> you<00:04:16.410> don't<00:04:16.590> have<00:04:16.709> really<00:04:16.920> to

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
hit you know you don't have really to

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.580 
hit you know you don't have really to
worry<00:04:17.370> about<00:04:17.520> it<00:04:17.850> you<00:04:18.030> get<00:04:18.480> healed<00:04:18.870> your<00:04:19.140> HP

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:22.350 
but this plane ship and I believe it

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:24.380 
but this plane ship and I believe it
makes<00:04:22.590> like<00:04:22.800> a<00:04:22.830> wrong<00:04:23.100> raw<00:04:23.490> food<00:04:23.850> it<00:04:24.060> makes<00:04:24.240> it

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:24.390 
makes like a wrong raw food it makes it

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:26.840 
makes like a wrong raw food it makes it
like<00:04:24.510> cooked<00:04:24.780> as<00:04:24.930> well<00:04:25.130> I'd<00:04:26.130> mind<00:04:26.340> they<00:04:26.490> added
