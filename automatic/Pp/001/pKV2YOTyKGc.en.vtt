00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.179 

I'm<00:01:31.729> not<00:01:31.939> going

I'm not going

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:39.899 
I'm not going
because<00:01:34.700> the<00:01:34.880> point<00:01:35.149> is<00:01:35.390> that

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:39.909 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:42.510 

and<00:01:40.360> if<00:01:40.869> I've<00:01:41.049> already<00:01:41.200> got<00:01:41.710> stuck<00:01:42.250> without

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 
and if I've already got stuck without

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.910 
and if I've already got stuck without
being

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.160 

cell

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:02:35.160 

just<00:01:52.650> do<00:01:52.770> a<00:01:52.799> real<00:01:53.070> quick<00:01:53.310> vacuuming

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:38.840 

okay<00:02:36.010> that<00:02:36.820> really<00:02:37.150> didn't<00:02:37.420> take<00:02:37.600> that<00:02:37.810> long

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
okay that really didn't take that long

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.810 
okay that really didn't take that long
so<00:02:39.850> let's<00:02:40.030> open<00:02:40.210> up<00:02:40.450> the<00:02:40.630> canister<00:02:41.260> and<00:02:41.820> see

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:42.820 
so let's open up the canister and see

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:51.690 
so let's open up the canister and see
why<00:02:43.060> I<00:02:43.090> pick<00:02:43.360> up<00:02:48.540> and<00:02:49.540> there's<00:02:49.900> actually<00:02:50.700> again

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
why I pick up and there's actually again

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.460 
why I pick up and there's actually again
a<00:02:51.730> stuff<00:02:52.180> around<00:02:52.360> the<00:02:52.540> edge<00:02:52.630> of<00:02:52.810> the<00:02:52.870> canister

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
a stuff around the edge of the canister

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.910 
a stuff around the edge of the canister
so<00:02:53.830> I'm<00:02:53.890> gonna<00:02:54.070> tap<00:02:54.340> it<00:02:54.550> a<00:02:54.580> little<00:02:54.700> bit<00:02:54.970> more

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
so I'm gonna tap it a little bit more

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:06.000 
so I'm gonna tap it a little bit more

the<00:03:18.850> carb<00:03:19.060> after<00:03:19.420> the<00:03:19.510> crosswind<00:03:20.430> just<00:03:21.430> goes

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:21.580 
the carb after the crosswind just goes

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:25.760 
the carb after the crosswind just goes
to<00:03:21.730> show<00:03:21.910> you<00:03:21.970> not<00:03:22.150> all<00:03:22.360> phantoms<00:03:22.870> are<00:03:23.320> equal

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:25.770 
to show you not all phantoms are equal

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:30.690 
to show you not all phantoms are equal
but<00:03:27.930> still<00:03:28.930> the<00:03:29.200> crosswind<00:03:29.770> I<00:03:29.890> like<00:03:30.130> it<00:03:30.400> even

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
but still the crosswind I like it even

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.180 
but still the crosswind I like it even
though<00:03:30.850> it's<00:03:31.530> yeah<00:03:32.530> I<00:03:32.560> got<00:03:32.890> it<00:03:33.040> as<00:03:33.130> a
