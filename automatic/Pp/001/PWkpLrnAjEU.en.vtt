transmission<00:00:06.420> for<00:00:06.870> carts<00:00:07.379> tests<00:00:08.280> that<00:00:08.910> we<00:00:09.030> did

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:09.710 
transmission for carts tests that we did

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:13.280 
transmission for carts tests that we did
CVT<00:00:10.710> for<00:00:10.980> carts<00:00:11.750> we<00:00:12.750> could<00:00:12.900> be<00:00:12.990> a<00:00:13.019> kit

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
CVT for carts we could be a kit

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.799 
CVT for carts we could be a kit
basically<00:00:14.009> means<00:00:14.790> you<00:00:14.910> can<00:00:15.059> run<00:00:15.240> your<00:00:15.450> engine

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
basically means you can run your engine

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.890 
basically means you can run your engine
at<00:00:15.900> maximum<00:00:16.289> power<00:00:16.470> constantly<00:00:17.310> and

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:17.900 
at maximum power constantly and

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.220 
at maximum power constantly and
constantly<00:00:18.980> varies<00:00:19.980> its<00:00:20.160> gear<00:00:20.369> ratio<00:00:20.869> so<00:00:21.869> your

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
constantly varies its gear ratio so your

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.630 
constantly varies its gear ratio so your
engine<00:00:22.500> lasts<00:00:22.680> ongoing<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.250> cart<00:00:23.460> goes

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
engine lasts ongoing the cart goes

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.780 
engine lasts ongoing the cart goes
faster

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:25.790

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:30.370

today<00:00:31.380> sees<00:00:31.590> Allen<00:00:31.860> I'm<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.250> one<00:00:32.400> that<00:00:32.520> drove

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
today sees Allen I'm the one that drove

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.870 
today sees Allen I'm the one that drove
the<00:00:32.970> cart<00:00:33.180> and<00:00:33.360> tested<00:00:33.690> it<00:00:33.810> and<00:00:34.130> my<00:00:35.130> first<00:00:35.550> time

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
the cart and tested it and my first time

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.400 
the cart and tested it and my first time
out<00:00:36.090> and<00:00:36.239> it<00:00:36.360> was<00:00:36.480> weirdest<00:00:36.900> experience

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
out and it was weirdest experience

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:38.630 
out and it was weirdest experience
because<00:00:37.620> when<00:00:37.710> you<00:00:37.830> put<00:00:37.950> your<00:00:38.010> foot<00:00:38.190> down<00:00:38.250> it's

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
because when you put your foot down it's

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.729 
because when you put your foot down it's
like<00:00:38.840> instant<00:00:39.840> power<00:00:40.020> sucking<00:00:40.380> all<00:00:40.470> off<00:00:40.559> but

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
like instant power sucking all off but

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.920 
like instant power sucking all off but
another<00:00:40.980> very<00:00:41.309> strange<00:00:42.210> and<00:00:42.390> then<00:00:42.510> when<00:00:42.840> you

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
another very strange and then when you

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.390 
another very strange and then when you
when<00:00:43.080> you<00:00:43.170> accelerate<00:00:43.470> in<00:00:43.800> these<00:00:44.040> sort<00:00:44.340> of

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:44.400 
when you accelerate in these sort of

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.270 
when you accelerate in these sort of
hits<00:00:45.330> the<00:00:45.420> mat<00:00:45.630> hits<00:00:45.930> we've<00:00:46.170> done<00:00:46.350> it<00:00:46.470> 11,000

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
hits the mat hits we've done it 11,000

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.490 
hits the mat hits we've done it 11,000
it<00:00:47.699> stays<00:00:47.970> there<00:00:48.300> living<00:00:49.020> enough<00:00:49.230> and<00:00:49.440> it

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
it stays there living enough and it

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.470 
it stays there living enough and it
stays<00:00:49.710> there<00:00:50.040> and<00:00:50.309> then<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.150> variable

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
stays there and then the variable

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.360 
stays there and then the variable
transmission<00:00:51.989> obviously<00:00:52.350> helps<00:00:52.860> makes<00:00:53.100> that

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
transmission obviously helps makes that

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.340 
transmission obviously helps makes that
that<00:00:53.520> accelerates<00:00:54.090> the<00:00:54.210> cut<00:00:54.420> and<00:00:54.629> he<00:00:54.930> said<00:00:55.110> it

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
that accelerates the cut and he said it

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:01.250 
that accelerates the cut and he said it
bit<00:00:55.559> weird<00:00:55.800> to<00:00:55.920> adjust<00:00:56.220> to<00:00:56.340> at<00:00:56.430> first<00:01:00.260> yeah

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
bit weird to adjust to at first yeah

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.990 
bit weird to adjust to at first yeah
yeah<00:01:01.620> sound<00:01:02.100> really<00:01:02.339> strange<00:01:02.489> shadow<00:01:02.850> right

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
yeah sound really strange shadow right

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.719 
yeah sound really strange shadow right
yeah<00:01:03.720> was<00:01:04.470> really<00:01:04.800> it<00:01:04.979> was<00:01:05.100> quite<00:01:05.220> we<00:01:05.430> changed

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
yeah was really it was quite we changed

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.160 
yeah was really it was quite we changed
when<00:01:05.880> she<00:01:05.909> got<00:01:06.060> used<00:01:06.300> to<00:01:06.420> it<00:01:06.570> it<00:01:06.690> was<00:01:06.810> it<00:01:07.080> was

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
when she got used to it it was it was

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.850 
when she got used to it it was it was
she<00:01:07.350> was<00:01:07.470> cool

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:11.960 

yeah<00:01:10.860> fast<00:01:11.190> step<00:01:11.490> because<00:01:11.670> there's<00:01:11.820> a<00:01:11.850> couple

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
yeah fast step because there's a couple

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.480 
yeah fast step because there's a couple
of<00:01:12.150> our<00:01:12.270> main<00:01:12.479> ones<00:01:12.690> they're<00:01:13.190> not<00:01:14.190> driven<00:01:14.370> by

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
of our main ones they're not driven by

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.580 
of our main ones they're not driven by
the<00:01:14.670> best<00:01:15.000> cars<00:01:15.570> in<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:15.930> world<00:01:16.110> but<00:01:16.320> it<00:01:16.500> was

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
the best cars in the world but it was

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.130 
the best cars in the world but it was
easily<00:01:17.180> excel<00:01:18.180> him<00:01:18.270> and<00:01:18.390> I<00:01:18.450> accelerating

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
easily excel him and I accelerating

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.350 
easily excel him and I accelerating
outer<00:01:19.290> corners<00:01:22.159> there<00:01:23.159> we<00:01:23.340> our<00:01:23.460> other<00:01:23.940> drivers

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
outer corners there we our other drivers

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.359 
outer corners there we our other drivers
of<00:01:24.450> Max<00:01:24.750> and<00:01:24.960> it<00:01:25.110> was<00:01:25.200> easily<00:01:25.530> quick<00:01:25.830> early<00:01:26.040> I

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
of Max and it was easily quick early I

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.580 
of Max and it was easily quick early I
think<00:01:27.090> on<00:01:27.210> paper<00:01:27.479> it's<00:01:27.720> about<00:01:27.930> a<00:01:27.990> second

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
think on paper it's about a second

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.050 
think on paper it's about a second
quicker<00:01:28.710> any<00:01:29.040> open<00:01:29.369> Georgia<00:01:29.700> Championship

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
quicker any open Georgia Championship

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.670 
quicker any open Georgia Championship
and<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.390> standard<00:01:30.810> rate<00:01:30.990> at<00:01:31.200> so<00:01:31.409> as<00:01:31.560> the

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
and the standard rate at so as the

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.920 
and the standard rate at so as the
performance<00:01:32.100> is<00:01:32.280> there

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
performance is there

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:41.330 
performance is there
