than just having a specific set program
which<00:01:07.159> I<00:01:07.280> don't<00:01:07.460> think<00:01:07.670> works<00:01:07.850> as<00:01:08.119> well<00:01:11.350> there

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
which I don't think works as well there

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:13.929 
which I don't think works as well there
are<00:01:12.500> programs<00:01:12.950> that<00:01:13.070> are<00:01:13.189> studying<00:01:13.670> the

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 
empathy and end up being criminals they

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:29.200 
empathy and end up being criminals they
can't<00:01:27.049> feel<00:01:27.740> for<00:01:28.040> anyone<00:01:28.430> else<00:01:28.640> because

00:01:32.139 --> 00:01:32.149 
they've been so let down in their life

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:35.109 
they've been so let down in their life
that<00:01:32.659> when<00:01:33.439> they<00:01:34.070> fall<00:01:34.369> in<00:01:34.549> love<00:01:34.579> with<00:01:34.789> this

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 
that when they fall in love with this

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:37.419 
that when they fall in love with this
horse<00:01:35.479> and<00:01:35.869> this<00:01:36.170> horse<00:01:36.499> falls<00:01:36.770> in<00:01:37.009> love<00:01:37.189> with

00:01:37.419 --> 00:01:37.429

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:40.660

them<00:01:37.670> then<00:01:38.299> they<00:01:38.570> can<00:01:38.600> learn<00:01:39.079> that<00:01:39.649> they<00:01:40.310> can

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
them then they can learn that they can

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.499

think that that's just something that we

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:50.570 
think that that's just something that we
can't<00:01:47.240> teach<00:01:47.479> them
