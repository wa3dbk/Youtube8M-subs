00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.639
 then ordered a section in the 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.830
 material commissioned men who 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.719
 have technical specialties but 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.490
 material section chief an aspect 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.369
 human resources 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:20.460
 human so he manages careers 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:24.869
 he takes care of the various exits that the 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:26.369
 section can can do the training to 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.559
 bourges his 11 months in division 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.840
 application and 11 months when we 

00:00:28.559 --> 00:00:33.420
 choose one learns concretely his 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.980
 occupation of section chief of the equipment and 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.230
 where one chooses among the three 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.199
 possible specialties so mechanical 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.070
 electronic electrical engineering and 

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:43.920
 supply is when we 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.579
 start we order a section by 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.890
 electronics 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.420
 there are more for example NCOs 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.339
 so more men a lot more 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.309
 qualified so the command is going to be 

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:56.429
 different for example from a section in 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:01:00.289
 mechanical so the choice of specialty 

00:00:56.429 --> 00:01:03.420
 is will be based on this feature 

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:06.930
 ordered the translated at the sections 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:09.750
 it is precisely to learn from our 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.120
 men to be soldiers more than 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.920
 the technical aspect that is learned by 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.450
 themselves so we made outings 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.890
 ground have made duty 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.210
 I have a course 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:23.240
 school at 7.6 pic since I left 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:27.049
 of a bep i ended up with a master in 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.469
 management of operations abroad in 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:29.840
 England 

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:31.039
 my career evolution four in two 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.979
 command time as that 

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:37.310
 sections then we move to grade 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:39.259
 captain as deputy or commissioned 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.969
 subsequently unit commander and 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:43.549
 then we can either renew ourselves 

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:45.740
 his contract either redirected to the 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:47.869
 civilian life during during the time of 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.780
 commandment that we alarmed 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:52.640
 for sure, we gain experience 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.560
 significant in terms of resources 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.329
 to manage its staff 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.500
 command and so if we go back into 

00:01:56.329 --> 00:01:59.509
 civil life it's obvious that it will be 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.700
 a plus for us to be folded under 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:03.979
 contract framework that wants to integrate 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.289
 holy cyr one must be having a will 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:07.549
 very strong it will be necessary faculty 

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:10.310
 quite important adaptation 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:12.519
 and then have to give thoroughly all the time 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.519
 what
