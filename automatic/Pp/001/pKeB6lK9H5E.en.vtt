a<00:00:56.579> battery<00:00:57.140> on<00:00:58.140> for<00:00:58.680> example<00:00:58.739> an<00:00:59.300> RV<00:01:00.300> that<00:01:00.329> you

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
a battery on for example an RV that you

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.060 
a battery on for example an RV that you
don't<00:01:00.809> use<00:01:01.140> every<00:01:02.070> day<00:01:02.100> so<00:01:03.090> that<00:01:03.239> your<00:01:03.449> battery

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
don't use every day so that your battery

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.060 
don't use every day so that your battery
doesn't<00:01:05.070> run<00:01:05.460> down<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:06.420> this<00:01:06.810> button<00:01:07.770> so<00:01:07.950> the

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
doesn't run down the this button so the

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.149 
doesn't run down the this button so the
power<00:01:08.220> it<00:01:08.460> maintains<00:01:09.119> your<00:01:09.540> battery<00:01:10.320> up<00:01:10.890> to

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
power it maintains your battery up to

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.270 
power it maintains your battery up to
where<00:01:11.369> it'll<00:01:11.850> start<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.360> vehicle<00:01:12.720> and<00:01:13.470> so

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
where it'll start the vehicle and so

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.820 
where it'll start the vehicle and so
that's<00:01:14.430> basically<00:01:14.549> what<00:01:14.880> it<00:01:14.909> is<00:01:15.360> and<00:01:15.710> do<00:01:16.710> you

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
that's basically what it is and do you

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.469 
that's basically what it is and do you
need<00:01:17.100> one<00:01:17.369> do<00:01:17.610> you<00:01:17.700> need<00:01:17.880> a<00:01:17.909> solar<00:01:18.180> battery

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
need one do you need a solar battery

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.649 
need one do you need a solar battery
maintainer<00:01:18.810> well<00:01:19.710> there's<00:01:20.100> some<00:01:20.659> situations
