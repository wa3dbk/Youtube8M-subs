00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:26.900
 hello girls when I would like to share 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:29.630
 with you a recipe that is of my 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.970
 favorite is simple and it is also very 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:34.910
 rich for it we will need two 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:37.940
 chicken breasts spices assorted two 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:40.489
 slices of lemon and salt pse de soya 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.140
 this time I 'm just going to use a 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:44.719
 breast because it's coming I have to eat 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.760
 and I'm not sure if the soy issue 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:48.920
 you will like it then with your hands 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.739
 well clean let's put pardon 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:54.409
 first of the lemon let's put two 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:57.320
 slices of lemon in the bowl that 

00:00:54.409 --> 00:00:59.380
 tns suitable for microwave we put the 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.110
 breast on top 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:04.570
 we throw the spices that we like to 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:06.490
 sometimes I have some spices that is a 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:07.750
 mixture of Provencal herbs but I was 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.830
 it's over so put a little bit of 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.830
 basil and rosemary 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:27.869
 and it gives a different touch to the chicken and 

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:27.869
 this recipe is also made in a moment 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.790
 I bought this soy in a store 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.430
 Chinese is very good 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:38.409
 and now we water the breast with the sauce 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.899
 of soy 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:43.359
 well I think there's enough 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:45.280
 we would treat it with the film 

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:49.060
 transparent and we would put it 6 minutes 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:51.310
 to the microwave then we uncover it on 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.170
 film we remove a little and we put it 3 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.929
 or 4 more minutes and you'll see how delicious that 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.459
 it's good now we make the kitchen of 

00:01:55.929 --> 00:02:00.490
 this pile of noise but it's because 

00:01:57.459 --> 00:02:05.130
 I have the star pot in motion 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.130
 we put the 633 we had seen 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.560
 and indeed the 6 minutes and now 

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:16.560
 we are going to remove them 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.260
 a little 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.890
 I think the combination of the favor of the 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.319
 soy with lemon is great 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:52.159
 the touch of spices still makes 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:52.159
 that is more the dish 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:09.220
 and now 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.220
 we put about three more minutes 

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:19.530
 the result you can accompany it with 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:20.790
 some patatitas some vegetables I 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:24.300
 now I have put two slices of lemon 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:27.000
 so that there is not only the cancel to 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:28.920
 the breast but good you'll see that in 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.020
 how much do you put it in the microwave right away 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.510
 orwell in the kitchen leaves a success 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:35.400
 super good and you will tell me if it has 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.380
 liked if you try that if you have 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.550
