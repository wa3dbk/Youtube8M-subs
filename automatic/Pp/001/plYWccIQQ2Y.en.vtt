00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:06.400
 I have shown this variety more than once 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.730
 one more time his 

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.730
 to push 

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:15.750
 this variety is notable because more 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:15.750
 abundant 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.430
 bloom 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.699
 I do not know a single sort of thing like this 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.980
 so he brought 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:29.099
 every peduncle every peduncle I 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:32.940
 Now here I will separate one show on 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.710
 Match is one flower spike on it now I 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:44.579
 counted 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:46.079
 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.539
 flowers 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.659
 this next flower spike is the same 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:54.899
 I shot some because they bloom and 

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:58.920
 apart from even those that I took 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:02.969
 one two three 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:06.860
 and here too these branches were about 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:10.380
 as much can take this flower 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:16.020
 it is a flower stalker if you take and count it 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:21.450
 there will be two times three 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:24.810
 11 12 13 14 flowers that is how we see 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:27.890
 on each then here is the love of any color of us 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.890
 Now here it is possible here 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:33.659
 here, too, more than ten 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:36.380
 here, too, more than ten, and here we are 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:39.719
 take just now just about 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:42.530
 gets out and you see what's on it too 

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:42.530
 whole festoon 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:50.880
 flora notable this variety is not 

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:53.959
 only that he has on each 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.609
 peduncle more than 10 on average 15 

00:01:53.959 --> 00:02:04.219
 butonchikov but also the fact that the flowers are held 

00:01:56.609 --> 00:02:11.879
 more than a month in bloom it is also perfectly 

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:13.430
 see the thick stems Sea this one 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:16.800
 desirable to plant 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:20.390
 add more he 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.390
 salt and sensitive 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.580
 In general, this variety is very, very 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:29.480
 happy 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:33.840
 Now I have a little color but myself 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:38.900
 I broke not torn actually 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:44.819
 peduncles very strong thickness they have 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:46.980
 they are very thick and i think this 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:52.440
 sort of a gamma 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:57.299
 but equal to him no he is perfect 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:59.069
 for growing think not only for 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:03.780
 exhibitions but also for industrial 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:06.420
 growing greece because i didn't see 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.930
 this variety that he was without a hat 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.930
 colors
