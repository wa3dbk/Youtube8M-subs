00:00:03.259 --> 00:00:08.670
 Hi Guys, I have to go straight, okay? 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.380
 you using the gps of your device already 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.460
 must have discovered that it serves as 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.309
 speedometer 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.450
 but that's how the speedometer video of the 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.520
 my gps 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.010
 I have a tip for you use the gps 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.750
 pedometer let's give it a touch it's a 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.060
 free program it has ads 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.859
 when you are connected to the internet the 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.500
 that he does specifically he has 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.890
 this speedometer interface is well 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.000
 interesting you will follow 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.399
 exactly what your gps is talking about 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.180
 of the speedometer at the time of 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.040
 reading 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.420
 in case we are at 0 per hour but you 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.640
 are knowing the device interface 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.379
 not the speed with which I run in a 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.000
 finally car 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.579
 here we have option that you select 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.100
 pedestrian you have fun while walking 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.440
 bicycle car and airplane 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.920
 The big question is why does this exist? 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.870
 watch the ram speedometer well it goes 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.579
 stay in the correct position this here we 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.770
 we have the maximum speed of 40 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.229
 miles an hour here on the bike 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.000
 this maximum speed goes to 80 in the 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.189
 car goes to 300 cars per hour in the 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.460
 plane goes to 1,500 kilometers per hour 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:13.650
 because this is quite simple when 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.780
 Are you walking the pointer, will you? 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.909
 move much more if your speed 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.280
 maximum was 40 per hour it will stay 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.900
 stirring here if I 'm young 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.500
 was 300 kilometers per hour equal to 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.180
 car 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.009
 The pointer will not even touch because it will 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.439
 very close to the scale for this 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.600
 program is great to play with 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.000
 you mark pedestrians you in the truck 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.400
 semac bikes and will bike 'ours 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.329
 absurd that you will do a session 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.329
 cycling 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:41.700
 finally you can stop the rotation here 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:45.409
 finally a cool good and you have option of 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:48.680
 change the colors let's choose one 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:52.399
 ferminio goes red we will not choose 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:55.649
 Orange does not have several options as well 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:57.450
 interesting our room with plenty of orange and 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.140
 debated come back never chose red 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.570
 huh 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.509
 but finally this option orange for you 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.399
 who likes orange the options paid me 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.890
 if I'm not mistaken it has to do with bust and 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.869
 everything else but I did not need to buy 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.740
 to amuse me miles per hour 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.840
 kilometers per hour and 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:16.180
 is this a personal victory if enough with 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.550
 this app sees its speed in the 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.930
 bus for example mark bicycle 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:22.480
 car and see the speed of the bus 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.010
 going out on the train, it's really cool that there are three 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.020
 What are you running and you do not? 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.060
 realize this is going to prove right 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:31.000
 this it marks the maximum speed that 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:33.520
 you have reached and mark the attitude that you 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.550
 is the thing that gps is also 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:39.130
 I am 787 meters above the level of 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:40.750
 really fun sea and GPS updates in 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.700
 real time only spending cheaper and 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.900
 while you're joking but when 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.780
 you do not leave 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:49.030
 just the problem of GPS pedometer it is 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.000
 the link in the description of the 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:54.100
 video the application of 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.020
