00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 who takes the bus in são paulo should already 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.720
 have noticed that some points of 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.460
 city buses were changed 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.920
 the company that will manage these locations 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.139
 promises four different structures with 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.940
 design that relates to the region in which 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.390
 the equipment was installed but the 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:21.390
 change already divides aspect views 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:24.180
 modernity was inspired by the 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.910
 the glass walls allow the view of the 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.570
 municipal theater and the historic center 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.710
 around 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:34.350
 the futuristic good the event is better the people 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:37.230
 already spoke treaty no-show 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:40.219
 by contract the consortium of companies 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:43.410
 who won the bid will have to renew 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:44.910
 6,500 shelters in three years in all 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.340
 city ​​regions 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.890
 the city ​​will not spend with the 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.710
 maintenance that is on the company's behalf 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.199
 dealer who will 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.660
 right to exploit the spaces of 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:01.170
 advertising at bus stops during 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:03.719
 25 years will sell ads that will be 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.680
 stamped on bottom panels 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.070
 illuminated 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:11.729
 the capital has 19,000 bus stops and 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:14.549
 less than half, only 7,000 have coverage 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.960
 often damaged as at this point 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.540
 on the Paulista Avenue 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.040
 the ravages were caused by the rain of 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.409
 Friday afternoon 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.229
 by contract, the Paulista Avenue will 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.689
 to win the model named high tech 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.100
 as well as other avenues in the centers 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.740
 of the city 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.700
 already on the fringes near bridges and 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.939
 viaducts 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:39.000
 the structure of the shelter will be in concrete 

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:41.310
 more than 40% of the total will be 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.280
 installed this model in which a 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.890
 structure of iron supports 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:50.670
 glass including the ceiling and got very 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:53.220
 beautiful but soft a bit behind caimans 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.560
 dripping on people's back but 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.469
 and it has happened to me I was Pelô 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.990
 george from there the gutter fell no one 

00:01:57.469 --> 00:02:01.970
 protects against the sun then 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.040
 I think it 's even a lady out 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.799
 protecting in the shade because it is not 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:09.200
 so others doubt the 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:11.870
 resistance of the material of the door 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.060
 stadium by the shelter something i think 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.860
 it is difficult to easy to break hear the 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.580
 someone rock builder or something 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.250
 on here 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:21.680
 The director of sp works the organ of 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:25.310
 prefecture that will manage the contract 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:27.890
 admits that adjustments can be made more 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:30.980
 technical studies have indicated the 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:33.560
 choice of models what happens if you 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.840
 remember well the old points in those 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.959
 They are replaced and health 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.790
 concrete or sheet metal heats up much more 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:43.340
 that the glass is clear we are in a country 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.049
 to a shield teaches in this 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:48.470
 video that does not allow full installation 

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:50.510
 but evidently that in a country 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:53.209
 blessed by taste and it's over 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:56.590
 happening given some points of 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:56.590
 sunshine and this will occur
