00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.139 
to where the survey team had set up but
I<00:01:27.740> fear<00:01:28.159> the<00:01:28.250> light<00:01:28.429> we<00:01:28.580> would<00:01:28.729> have<00:01:28.819> running

00:01:29.139 --> 00:01:29.149 
I fear the light we would have running

I fear the light we would have running
into<00:01:29.360> alien<00:01:29.690> creatures<00:01:30.170> is<00:01:30.440> very<00:01:30.799> high<00:01:31.039> once
