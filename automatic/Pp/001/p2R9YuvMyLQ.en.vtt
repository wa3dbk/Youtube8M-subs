gonna be done here but there's this not

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:07.410 
gonna be done here but there's this not
downside<00:03:04.750> downside<00:03:05.610> and<00:03:06.610> again<00:03:06.850> this<00:03:07.030> again

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
downside downside and again this again

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:08.760 
downside downside and again this again
this<00:03:07.600> map<00:03:07.810> that<00:03:07.840> I<00:03:08.050> can't<00:03:08.290> say<00:03:08.440> enough<00:03:08.560> about

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:08.770 
this map that I can't say enough about

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:09.980 
this map that I can't say enough about
it's<00:03:09.130> going<00:03:09.370> great

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:09.990 
it's going great

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:14.160 
it's going great
again<00:03:10.990> the<00:03:11.170> foam<00:03:12.300> foam<00:03:13.300> brush<00:03:13.630> takes<00:03:13.930> a<00:03:14.020> little

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
again the foam foam brush takes a little

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.700 
again the foam foam brush takes a little
getting<00:03:14.260> used<00:03:14.620> to<00:03:14.740> but<00:03:16.110> does<00:03:17.110> a<00:03:17.140> great<00:03:17.410> job<00:03:17.470> I

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:17.710 
getting used to but does a great job I

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:19.440 
getting used to but does a great job I
think<00:03:17.890> this<00:03:18.100> is<00:03:18.250> like<00:03:18.400> two<00:03:18.790> and<00:03:18.970> a<00:03:19.000> half<00:03:19.180> inch

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
think this is like two and a half inch

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:22.440 
think this is like two and a half inch
brush<00:03:20.010> they<00:03:21.010> have<00:03:21.100> smaller<00:03:21.430> ones<00:03:21.550> larger<00:03:22.240> ones

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
brush they have smaller ones larger ones

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:23.850 
brush they have smaller ones larger ones
whatever<00:03:22.900> you're<00:03:23.110> more<00:03:23.350> comfortable<00:03:23.410> with

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:23.860 
whatever you're more comfortable with

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:26.480 
whatever you're more comfortable with
but<00:03:24.250> again<00:03:24.910> I<00:03:24.940> can't<00:03:25.060> say<00:03:25.450> enough<00:03:25.600> about<00:03:25.780> it

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:26.490 
but again I can't say enough about it

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:31.290 
but again I can't say enough about it
