00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
going to lose a shot because of this but

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.449

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
have to turn to get a full negative so

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.309 
have to turn to get a full negative so
what<00:02:42.610> I<00:02:42.640> do<00:02:42.760> is<00:02:43.599> just<00:02:43.660> kind<00:02:43.840> of<00:02:43.989> hold<00:02:44.230> your

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:44.319

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
finger here and as you turn it just

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.630 
finger here and as you turn it just
count<00:02:48.970> like<00:02:49.180> a<00:02:49.209> normal<00:02:49.599> turn<00:02:49.810> like<00:02:50.019> you<00:02:50.140> would

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
count like a normal turn like you would

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:59.009 
count like a normal turn like you would
1<00:02:52.290> 2<00:02:54.720> 3<00:02:55.890> 4<00:02:56.890> so<00:02:57.760> I<00:02:57.790> know<00:02:57.880> I<00:02:58.209> just<00:02:58.510> have<00:02:58.660> to<00:02:58.750> crank

00:02:59.009 --> 00:02:59.019 
1 2 3 4 so I know I just have to crank

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:02.819 
1 2 3 4 so I know I just have to crank
this<00:02:59.200> thing<00:02:59.260> about<00:02:59.739> four<00:03:00.130> times<00:03:00.430> and<00:03:01.829> it's

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:02.829 
this thing about four times and it's

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:06.720 
this thing about four times and it's
going<00:03:03.070> to<00:03:03.130> be<00:03:03.310> to<00:03:03.670> the<00:03:03.790> next<00:03:04.090> frame<00:03:05.579> then<00:03:06.579> all

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
going to be to the next frame then all

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:07.830 
going to be to the next frame then all
you<00:03:06.790> got<00:03:06.940> to<00:03:07.000> do<00:03:07.090> is<00:03:07.209> remember<00:03:07.390> when<00:03:07.720> you're

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
you got to do is remember when you're

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.259 
you got to do is remember when you're
looking<00:03:08.260> through<00:03:08.319> your<00:03:08.650> viewfinder<00:03:09.269> your

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:10.269

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
film is only a little strip in the

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.569 
film is only a little strip in the
middle<00:03:12.459> so<00:03:12.579> you<00:03:12.640> can<00:03:12.790> kind<00:03:13.000> of<00:03:13.500> figure<00:03:14.579> you

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:15.579
