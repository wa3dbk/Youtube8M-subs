00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:45.819 
money back to the ropes and body

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:47.369 
money back to the ropes and body
punching<00:02:46.269> important<00:02:46.629> to<00:02:46.689> press<00:02:46.900> you<00:02:47.019> on<00:02:47.079> him<00:02:47.260> a

00:02:47.369 --> 00:02:47.379 
punching important to press you on him a

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:48.629 
punching important to press you on him a
me<00:02:47.439> he's<00:02:47.650> not<00:02:47.680> built<00:02:48.129> that<00:02:48.189> way<00:02:48.310> he's<00:02:48.609> a

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:48.639 
me he's not built that way he's a

00:02:48.639 --> 00:02:52.970 
me he's not built that way he's a
completely<00:02:49.150> different<00:02:49.540> fighter<00:02:49.750> to<00:02:50.049> me<00:02:50.230> so<00:02:51.129> I

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
completely different fighter to me so I

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.050 
completely different fighter to me so I
think<00:02:53.980> money<00:02:54.370> should<00:02:54.459> be<00:02:54.639> spending<00:02:54.939> with

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
think money should be spending with

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:56.039 
think money should be spending with
people<00:02:55.359> that<00:02:55.450> are<00:02:55.540> going<00:02:55.659> to<00:02:55.750> put<00:02:55.959> the

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:56.049 
people that are going to put the

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:57.270 
people that are going to put the
pressure<00:02:56.169> on<00:02:56.409> him<00:02:56.590> push<00:02:56.799> him<00:02:56.829> back<00:02:57.099> to<00:02:57.250> the

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
pressure on him push him back to the

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.949 
pressure on him push him back to the
ropes<00:02:57.549> not<00:02:57.760> somebody<00:02:58.180> like<00:02:58.209> him<00:02:58.510> here<00:02:58.719> who's
