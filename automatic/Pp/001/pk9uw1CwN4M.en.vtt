00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:00.999 
so this is like six to eight thousand
and<00:01:59.840> this<00:02:00.079> can't<00:02:00.289> be<00:02:00.380> attacked<00:02:00.679> if<00:02:00.859> there's

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:01.009 
and this can't be attacked if there's

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:02.139 
and this can't be attacked if there's
another<00:02:01.159> fiend<00:02:01.429> on<00:02:01.579> your<00:02:01.729> side<00:02:01.880> of<00:02:01.909> the<00:02:02.030> field

00:02:02.139 --> 00:02:02.149 
another fiend on your side of the field

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:04.840 
another fiend on your side of the field
so<00:02:03.020> basically<00:02:03.319> is<00:02:03.530> just<00:02:03.560> like<00:02:03.920> the<00:02:04.340> best<00:02:04.549> card
