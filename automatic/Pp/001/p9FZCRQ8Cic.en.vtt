00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
cable see if I can find the ends for

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.390 
cable see if I can find the ends for
one<00:02:15.930> thing<00:02:16.079> I<00:02:16.170> like<00:02:16.290> about<00:02:16.349> Samsung's<00:02:17.010> USB

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
one thing I like about Samsung's USB

one thing I like about Samsung's USB
cables<00:02:17.730> they've<00:02:17.909> got<00:02:18.090> this<00:02:18.180> little<00:02:18.510> flange<00:02:18.840> it

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
cables they've got this little flange it

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.949 
cables they've got this little flange it
makes<00:02:19.319> it<00:02:19.469> easier<00:02:19.920> to<00:02:19.980> pull<00:02:20.430> out<00:02:20.670> let<00:02:21.599> me<00:02:21.719> open

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
makes it easier to pull out let me open

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:25.339 
makes it easier to pull out let me open
that<00:02:22.260> up<00:02:22.379> so<00:02:22.739> you<00:02:22.769> can<00:02:23.219> see<00:02:23.909> it<00:02:24.170> you've<00:02:25.170> already

at the bottom let's crack this guy open
and<00:05:11.570> just<00:05:12.570> like<00:05:12.690> most<00:05:12.930> Samsung's<00:05:13.440> it's<00:05:13.620> a<00:05:13.740> peel

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:14.040 
and just like most Samsung's it's a peel

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.520 
and just like most Samsung's it's a peel
off<00:05:14.280> the<00:05:14.850> top<00:05:15.060> is<00:05:15.270> kind<00:05:15.450> of<00:05:15.570> tight<00:05:15.840> it's<00:05:16.350> got<00:05:16.500> a

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:18.480 
couple contact points down the sides and

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:21.020 
couple contact points down the sides and
then<00:05:18.600> the<00:05:18.630> bottom<00:05:19.020> just<00:05:19.170> toggles<00:05:20.040> or<00:05:20.280> pivots

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:21.030 
then the bottom just toggles or pivots

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:23.780 
then the bottom just toggles or pivots
right<00:05:21.090> up<00:05:21.360> move<00:05:22.050> that<00:05:22.230> off<00:05:22.380> to<00:05:22.530> the<00:05:22.560> side<00:05:22.790> now

what we've got over here a couple things
first<00:05:25.590> of<00:05:25.770> all<00:05:25.830> we've<00:05:26.130> got<00:05:26.400> this<00:05:26.640> micro<00:05:27.210> SD

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:27.570 
first of all we've got this micro SD

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:30.350 
first of all we've got this micro SD
slot<00:05:27.600> so<00:05:28.200> it<00:05:28.560> is<00:05:28.710> empty<00:05:29.060> doesn't<00:05:30.060> come<00:05:30.210> with
