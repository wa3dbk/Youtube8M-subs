00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:22.460
 hello love for any spectator 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:25.009
 families here with a test of 1000 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:27.080
 rolls at the title are 

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:29.300
 a classic tower defense title 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:31.250
 the brand new in the app store and in the 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.920
 Fantasy area is settled 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:38.710
 because as the name of the app indicates 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.710
 you fight here predominantly territory 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:09.380
 as usual with this type of title 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:12.650
 Do you have a basis to protect it? 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:14.659
 your defense towers are placed 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:18.020
 her as usual on the roadside 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:20.509
 every new tower costs gold that you get from 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:23.119
 the opponents receive in the course of the game 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:25.430
 you always get new and more powerful 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:27.560
 towers that are allowed to place on the way 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.960
 These are not only different in the 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:33.110
 Price but also in reach of fire 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:35.210
 frequency and shot though 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:38.000
 you are also allowed to build your existing towers 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:40.880
 upgrade what is often more gold-saving than 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.460
 a new tower is next to the towers 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:46.399
 You can also bomb extra weapons like that 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.619
 explosive barrels or poison gas against the 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:50.899
 use onslaughting enemies 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:52.700
 At the beginning of each level you have one 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:55.610
 certain number of extra weapons 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.920
 given you need more you have to 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.600
 use rare rubies which the 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.300
 sometimes leave enemies behind 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:05.539
 that in turn has deductions in the 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:07.939
 According to rating, enemies reach 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:09.229
 but your base is not the game 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:12.110
 directly to the end 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.980
 it will just be a lifetime 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.650
 withdrawn 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:18.560
 only when all life points have been used up 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:21.070
 are the level lost sometimes 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:24.070
 But the enemies also leave behind new ones 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:24.070
 live points 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:04.610
 1000 rolls offers around 30 levels 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.640
 six worlds are split 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.959
 the rushing enemy waves 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:12.290
 Generate at every level state 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:14.720
 new addition, the levels are rather small 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:17.690
 held because there is usually only about 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:20.420
 twelve falls so that after 20 to 30 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:21.739
 minutes usually one level longest 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.530
 if finished 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:26.209
 the graphics are nice but by far 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:29.209
 not too detailed like the tower 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:31.489
 Defense references sentinel 3 and celli 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:33.650
 the fans the easy light fantasy 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:35.569
 music fits quite well with the title 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:37.250
 could maybe something else 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:39.250
 be more varied 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:41.209
 Thorsten Schulz offers three 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:43.730
 degrees of difficulty so that also tower 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:46.010
 Defense newcomers should come clearly 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:48.319
 the later levels will also be added 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:50.959
 strategically interesting as you can do more 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:52.850
 as a base must protect and it so 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:55.280
 much more important is his gold 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:57.489
 to divide and the towers to properly 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.489
 place 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:43.070
 My conclusion 1000 rolls comes to me 

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:46.700
 compared to jelly the fans and sentinel 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:48.710
 3 a little like tower defense sorry 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:50.870
 because the strategic and playful 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:53.690
 possibilities are simply lower 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:56.120
 Add to that the title is not so good 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:58.070
 is balanced because it happens 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:00.110
 often enough that you actually quite 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:02.990
 Well positioned is the defense 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:05.510
 all waves copes easily and then 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:07.010
 but suddenly disproportionate 

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:09.170
 strong opponents emerge 

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:11.870
 but that should not be the case now 

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:14.360
 sound negative because 1000 rolls makes 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:15.050
 definitely fun and works very well 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:17.870
 play 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:20.570
 I forgive four out of five possible 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:23.000
 Star 1000 rolls is available in two variants 

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:26.810
 in the app store the version for 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:31.370
 ipod touch and iphone costs 32 hd 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:35.680
 variant for the ipad 3 990 feet and up to 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:35.680
 next time your fabian says
