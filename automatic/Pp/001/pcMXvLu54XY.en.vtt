00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:07.399
 hello guys that is Friday the day 

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:09.799
 today I've decided to do an update 

00:00:07.399 --> 00:00:11.990
 from one of the first videos I have 

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:14.570
 in the channel and do what kind of penalties to use 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:15.769
 according to our type of bodies is something 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:17.330
 that today we continue 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:19.400
 wondering and despite the fact that I have a 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:20.930
 video a bit soft everything decided 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.390
 do is collect the questions then 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:25.039
 more concrete that you do to me and go back to 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:28.390
 do this video then updating 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:28.390
 and speaking a little more about the subject 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:34.650
 so good the first question that I 

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:36.750
 pose is that there are many who are 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:38.460
 well short and you know it well 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.740
 Well, how do they seem higher or what kind 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.110
 of clothes to wear what kind of clothes to wear 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:45.030
 so not to disguise a bit 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.460
 the stature and well we would have got 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.600
 it's vertical lines and how do we do this 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.850
 pose and cops tricks 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.489
 the first one is monocolor ie dress 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.830
 of one color is worth anything is 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.080
 better to use more neutral colors more 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:59.850
 dark but we can also use it 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.309
 a white or a pink what you want but 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.830
 let's put for example the color black 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.509
 if we use clothes that are all black 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.750
 and very important that they are exactly 

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:11.580
 the same tone as we get a line 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.070
 vertical which makes us more 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.899
 optically high, the 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.910
 colors of the same range this consists 

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:20.040
 in wearing, for example, trousers 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:23.009
 chocolate brown color with a shirt 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.960
 a beige shirt and a cardigan 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.030
 also of a brown color he cited this 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.130
 makes us go the different color is not 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.259
 a new color but of the same range with 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.090
 which we also create straight lines what 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.979
 most important for this is to create 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.750
 always straight lines and now you are 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.120
 asking very boring posts 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.010
 is the same color is worth aburridÃ­simo 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.870
 this is a small type ie 7 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:44.790
 days that the week has a week day 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:47.190
 we can go monocolor another day 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.020
 week that we can do then without leaving 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.970
 to create vertical lines we can 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.770
 put on a trouser and a gray be of 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.540
 same color but the one color shirt 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.160
 different then we are breaking this 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.050
 in good color surrounds we can reach the 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.790
 trousers on the shirt the medium itself 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:01.229
 color but the play be of another color 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.700
 different breaking asylum in with another 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.470
 child will also go very well 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.970
 skinny pants and those when they 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.650
 pique we put them for example a 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.899
 stiletto or one with finite especially 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:12.000
 finite and will face pointed stylizing 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:14.070
 much more the figure we have to avoid the 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.640
 long skirts the skirts below 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:17.130
 knee 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.660
 wide trousers fabrics with 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.420
 volume and on all the accessories 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.040
 cut the color because imagine the 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.290
 that you are for example all in black and 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.770
 suddenly put a belt that is in 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:30.750
 red color this makes us break the 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.459
 linearity in terms of shoe is better 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.470
 that we avoid high boots like 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:36.900
 I would also avoid booties and 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.220
 Flat shoes and platform as 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.410
 It is obviously appropriate to take 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.570
 best finite heel point because it 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.560
 they investigate a lot more stiletto 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.450
 how do I continue commenting 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.709
 before the shoes escorted to the best 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.900
 many action are those that you will see 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:50.400
 the instep because they lengthen the foot in 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.680
 As for add-ons, we would also go 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.690
 very well who long muscle creating 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.310
 again straight lines also those 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.160
 necklaces and things that are hanging 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:01.230
 then summarizing straight straight pants 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.209
 Better than wide and patterned fabrics 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.489
 smooth better than textured fabrics 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:07.620
 neckline of peak instead of neckline 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:09.390
 round thin jackets and ready in 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.250
 place of jackets then a little more 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.080
 padded decrees a lead type that 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.310
 gives in volume and as I said before 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.810
 also to avoid a little bit what 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.239
 makes a skirt for example below 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.799
 knees or put on a cigarette and a 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:21.239
 high droplet or because because this does 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:22.769
 what are we creating lines 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:25.049
 horizontal on the leg then 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:28.970
 this cuts her a lot more and it will make 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:28.970
 optically because we are shorter 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:34.980
 and in all the things that I read a lot is 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.749
 that being thin, everything looks good 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.670
 but which one we have a few extra kilitos 

00:03:36.749 --> 00:03:40.439
 when we have a little hip 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:43.769
 that the garments do not look good anymore , 

00:03:40.439 --> 00:03:45.329
 they do so much and that you do not feel 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:48.090
 good what to do what to do when we have 

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:49.950
 his extra kilitos that we get good 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.510
 because first of all it favors 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.909
 these cases are straight pants 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:56.189
 the dark colors t-shirts and dresses 

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:58.439
 with 20- meter drop heels for 

00:03:56.189 --> 00:04:00.239
 stylize the figure avoid the cigarette 

00:03:58.439 --> 00:04:02.040
 avoid the skirt below the knee 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:03.689
 this makes that much more marked 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.969
 more then what is the hip the culete and 

00:04:03.689 --> 00:04:07.620
 all that is the leg the thigh what by 

00:04:05.969 --> 00:04:09.750
 example yes we can put a skirt 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.849
 because above the knee a dress 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:13.469
 that fits the body because then it 

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:15.959
 we put a few vertical lines 

00:04:13.469 --> 00:04:17.489
 for example a blazer that create lines and 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:19.320
 that is giving us a little bit of a scarf 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:20.910
 that creates line is what I was saying before 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:23.070
 and creating vertical ellis we arrange 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:25.880
 many things to avoid prints 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:29.310
 so they are post top post squares 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:31.470
 horizontal stripes and also what they are 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:32.900
 fantasy like when and scarves and 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:34.759
 some rhinestones 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:36.740
 of plays and things and things that shine 

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:38.720
 a lot and also very important but that 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:40.220
 it seems silly are the Texans and 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:42.740
 pants that carry pockets to the 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:44.270
 sides obviously this makes you have 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.770
 more volume on the hip then this 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:47.120
 is what we do not want then what 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:49.460
 will favor us more are they keep the 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.960
 readers we avoid prints and now I 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:52.580
 feel that it is a bit the orbit that 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.789
 cover us more or less below the 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:54.789
 ass 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:00.620
 that happens to us we have little chest that is 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.750
 what favors us more what we 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:04.340
 highlights more in these cases the best is 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:06.110
 get necklines in the shape of today and 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:08.240
 rounded and also works very well 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:09.590
 ons that go around 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:11.900
 this area like for example a 

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:14.960
 bag just above the chest or a 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:16.460
 brooch or a patch or something like that 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:18.860
 They will also work very well 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:20.389
 garments with prints except for 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:22.310
 vertical lines everything else we 

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:23.480
 would also serve the penalties that have a 

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:25.639
 volume for example that have 

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:27.680
 frills garments that have embroidery 

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:29.570
 that are draped everything that is to give 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:31.790
 volume in this area will seem like 

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:33.200
 optically yesterday more chest that is what 

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:35.270
 we wanted to avoid words of 

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:36.860
 new plunging necklines and lines 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:39.010
 straight as for example stamping 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:39.010
 stripes 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:45.050
 what happens if we otherwise have 

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:46.640
 too much chest we want to hide it 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:49.370
 well for this case the best is 

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:51.920
 Smooth and dark garments avoid everything 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:53.810
 what is the pattern except the 

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:56.090
 Straight lines wear necklines 

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:57.800
 pronounced in peak form by 

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:59.990
 example then to wear a shirt put 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:01.550
 a pashmina tarnished above 

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:03.320
 leaving it as well as half open giving 

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:05.000
 of a turn to leave them open or by 

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:06.740
 example, the shirt 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.780
 shopping network and leave it open for 

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:09.980
 create the straight lines and we will avoid 

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:12.140
 Well, the whole neck issue 

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:13.850
 round and closed patterns and everything 

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:16.010
 what is the theory of tiles everything 

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:17.180
 give volume to this area and this is all 

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:19.820
 these are the most frequently asked questions 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:21.530
 that I receive in what refers to 

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:23.390
 what kind of clothes are going according to the 

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:26.210
 body if you have anything else or 

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:27.800
 a more particular case that therefore not 

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:29.810
 is included in these four little things 

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:32.150
 form that comment about what you send 

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:33.890
 in a private message or email like os 

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:35.780
 go better to you and I will make you others 

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:37.430
 videos exposing these assigned whores 

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:38.690
 for today these all will all like us 

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:41.260
 have served and see you next 

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:41.260
 video
