 hello in today's video tutorial I will give you 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.280
 I'll tell you how to work with translated from 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.370
 Olga 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:15.929
 today we will need varnish of your choice 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:17.670
 base coat to protect your 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:21.869
 natural nails and of course 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:24.570
 transfer foil adhesive for transfer 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.930
 I have a foil from the Russian site here 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.179
 even in Russian written glue for 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.710
 metal film coating 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:34.160
 superstar 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:37.350
 valid until September 14 ups 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.309
 but it still works so Iâ€™ve already done 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.930
 the base 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.559
 el corazon lacquer number 272 is not black 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.680
 shade 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.899
 attack dark grayish and gave him 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.760
 I already have a good dry foil 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.309
 pre-cut into squares 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:01:03.690
 to make it easier to work 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:01:05.760
 apply any pattern with a thin brush and give 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.880
 glue to dry when the glue dries 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.250
 it becomes transparent glue dried up and 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.220
 Now we attach attention to the foil 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.770
 matte side to the nail 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:19.250
 brilliant upstairs put 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.250
 and took off 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:29.140
 get a picture 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.140
 look again 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:46.960
 if you are somewhere wrong and foil 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.420
 imprinted not where you wanted it 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:52.870
 you can always fix all the same 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:59.050
 long brush and in my case black 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:02:06.400
 lacquer but actually we all left 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:07.900
 only fix the design on my 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.760
