00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.860
 dear Thomas in 1977 had 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:23.360
 with the first program in Vienna premiere 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:25.880
 but rather awake again 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:28.789
 the onward tricks like walter matrix 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.980
 and as in the sky and chamber of Peter 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:32.419
 By the way, also a very good boxer came 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.030
 to me and said you gave it 

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:36.410
 Now it's the Cabaret if it's the one 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.750
 Right is sending the six years 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:41.320
 later and in 20 years 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.850
 Do you do the same with it then? 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:48.369
 Lukas the quasi monopoly 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.369
 destroy successfully succeeded 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:55.610
 Thomas Lucasarts has many young ones 

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:57.559
 selecting people in their job 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.930
 definitely influenced later one 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:03.199
 Cabaret career made then would be yes 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.189
 not what kind of job would you have 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:07.340
 well taken 

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:10.159
 I would have become a religion teacher without 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.600
 lukas resetarits but real estate im 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:13.460
 afterwards very grateful that he gave me 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:17.360
 of it one can have it over 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:19.220
 twelve people in the folk house develops this 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:22.130
 very first time that the live qualities 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.210
 that was in the lukas resetarits at twelve 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.000
 of course I do not have anything 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:29.090
 understood so politically at all 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.909
 fascinating customers that alan the 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:34.880
 Leitz lessons and can interpret these 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:36.470
 but this year's teacher and relatives 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.290
 definitely also an option 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.370
 but that's right so me 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:41.870
 am then still in the first 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:44.080
 arise like the server cabaretist 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:47.020
 is that he is in contrast to 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:49.370
 another geological occupation from the 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.680
 driver for example, yes that needs the 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:52.760
 2003 as the same program of bastian i 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.770
 change program 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:57.970
 that had to be the whole as a cabaret artist 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:00.710
 not in that sense is the wrong class 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.030
 but still nothing will work for you 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.890
 give you some time with alcohol in the service 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:08.149
 Cabaretists thank you 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:12.980

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:29.580

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.540
 already very cautious because 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.830
