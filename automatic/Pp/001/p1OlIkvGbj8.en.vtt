00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.490
 I have a version that is that 

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:07.170
 had just ruled the leadership 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.719
 of racing do not count anymore with toranzo and 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.250
 with brown booster is this information 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.590
 they had communicated it had not 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.839
 communicated with him seems a little fact 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.039
 not casual and try to intimidate a 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.070
 footballer because also for the mother 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.480
 you are this scared is sent to move and 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.109
 vote time to pay a lot of money 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.820
 for example it did not give being badly thought not 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.160
 I dare say it but it's one of 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.810
 the hypotheses the color did not confess to 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.700
 the boys racing the players 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.960
 who knows that he deals with them 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.880
 permanently that he was in 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.040
 conditions to handle the situation 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.110
 and strikingly far from handling it what 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.760
 what happens is another tightening not then 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.530
 I say look for information you drive to 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.110
 respect I had already communicated I have 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.520
 understood that they had already met technical 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.480
 and president who did not want to tell more 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.000
 with the 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:55.000
 this had not been officially communicated 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.820
 there are facts martín there are situations that 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.170
 they mark when there is no punctual interest 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:03.190
 of the coach for having giovanni 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:04.900
 brown the count of the matches and the 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:06.610
 the player's walk around began to 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.810
 mark that giovanni moreno was not going to 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.700
 have a lot of place in this team 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.710
 made in statements the day went up 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.360
 very clear and said the player other than 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.880
 my school is luis fariña a juvenile from 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.470
 real club without marking but what 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.450
 different than giovani moreno because he can 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:20.979
 be that you saw very low but do not know the 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.320
 quality player if you always have 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:25.780
 remarked now that they have done it 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.940
 official I do not have that information from 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.940
 fact 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:33.060
 yesterday chatting with a protagonist me 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:36.150
 the technician said he does not want it, I know that 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.040
 you can see it and I think you can 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.230
 base or you can search it on the side of 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.030
 understand that he had lost place in the 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:43.560
 team like the lost toranzo because 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.050
 we had the whole game because it turns out 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.300
 very rare it is very rare to be approached 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.880
 to giovanni moreno and grab him and 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:53.160
 tell him you have to go is very rare is 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.230
 very weird as if I basically do not play 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.640
 much is more plays little outside 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:58.800
 responsible for something more than the others 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.390
 then where I start to 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.030
 elucubrar some hypothesis that I 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.770
 lets believe that this was not a fact 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.270
 casual but good I see that the doors 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.920
 they are closed that journalists like 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.350
 they are always the ones who pay for the dishes 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.420
 broken so on the street to spend freshly 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.880
 after talking to us a patrolman 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.980
 of the province of buenos aires and the 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.300
 program today is tension with what is it 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.080
 that is lived out there at this time 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.960
 in the corbatta passage 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:26.020
 and here I do not want to exaggerate but not less 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:27.840
 of nine nine and a half press phones 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:30.590
 in the morning arrived giovanni moreno here 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:33.170
 accompanied by sergio marchi 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.640
 he showed up to train I imagine that the 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.720
 racing leadership is going to talk is going to 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.000
 put your face and will say something to 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:40.489
 Regarding all this situation your 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.730
 hypotheses martín are not mistaken by 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:45.349
 at least they are not invalid and I think that 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.239
 there are more hypotheses because today too 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:50.569
 is talking to colleagues there was talk of 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:51.920
 the possibility that the bars by 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:53.540
 call it somehow 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.879
 they have tightened the animals also because 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.230
 I change a shirt with viatri in the 

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:59.920
 party calls what seemed to me 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.920
 absolute madness
