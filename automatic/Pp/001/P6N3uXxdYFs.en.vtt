00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:06.059 
hi everyone Dennis Foley from acoustic
fields<00:00:05.150> today<00:00:05.330> we're<00:00:05.510> going<00:00:05.630> to<00:00:05.690> talk<00:00:05.899> about

00:00:06.059 --> 00:00:06.069 
fields today we're going to talk about

00:00:06.069 --> 00:00:09.670 
fields today we're going to talk about
SBI<00:00:07.069> II<00:00:07.309> it's<00:00:08.090> an<00:00:08.360> acronym<00:00:08.840> for<00:00:08.900> speaker

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:09.680 
SBI II it's an acronym for speaker

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:12.610 
SBI II it's an acronym for speaker
boundary<00:00:10.130> interference<00:00:10.269> effect<00:00:11.379> let's<00:00:12.379> look

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:12.620 
boundary interference effect let's look

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:15.280 
boundary interference effect let's look
at<00:00:12.769> the<00:00:12.889> definition<00:00:13.099> I<00:00:13.790> see<00:00:14.120> a<00:00:14.150> lot<00:00:14.419> of<00:00:14.450> this<00:00:14.780> in

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:15.290 
at the definition I see a lot of this in

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:19.030 
at the definition I see a lot of this in
the<00:00:15.530> photos<00:00:15.889> that<00:00:16.129> you<00:00:16.309> send<00:00:17.090> in<00:00:17.890> showing<00:00:18.890> me

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:19.040 
the photos that you send in showing me

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.820 
the photos that you send in showing me
your<00:00:19.400> room<00:00:20.030> layout<00:00:20.450> and<00:00:20.810> your<00:00:21.020> speaker<00:00:21.470> and

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:21.830 
your room layout and your speaker and

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:25.570 
your room layout and your speaker and
amplifier<00:00:22.820> and<00:00:23.240> listening<00:00:23.680> positions<00:00:24.680> and<00:00:25.040> I

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:25.580 
amplifier and listening positions and I

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:30.430 
amplifier and listening positions and I
see<00:00:25.790> a<00:00:25.820> lot<00:00:26.090> of<00:00:26.120> spie<00:00:26.960> going<00:00:27.650> on<00:00:28.360> it's<00:00:29.360> a<00:00:29.600> it's

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:30.440 
see a lot of spie going on it's a it's

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:34.020 
see a lot of spie going on it's a it's
crazy<00:00:30.830> I<00:00:31.010> just<00:00:31.760> I<00:00:31.970> don't<00:00:32.239> quite<00:00:32.930> understand

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:34.030 
crazy I just I don't quite understand

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.820 
crazy I just I don't quite understand
quite<00:00:35.030> understand<00:00:35.540> why<00:00:35.720> I<00:00:35.750> see<00:00:36.080> so<00:00:36.290> much<00:00:36.500> of<00:00:36.710> it

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:36.830 
quite understand why I see so much of it

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:39.790 
quite understand why I see so much of it
but<00:00:37.040> I<00:00:37.940> I<00:00:38.360> guess<00:00:38.780> I<00:00:38.930> can't<00:00:39.170> understand<00:00:39.590> why<00:00:39.740> you

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:39.800 
but I I guess I can't understand why you

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.920 
but I I guess I can't understand why you
can't<00:00:40.100> why<00:00:40.340> people<00:00:40.700> can't<00:00:40.940> hear<00:00:41.240> it<00:00:41.390> that's

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:41.930 
can't why people can't hear it that's

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.450 
can't why people can't hear it that's
the<00:00:42.200> thing<00:00:42.230> that<00:00:43.480> is<00:00:44.620> problematic<00:00:45.620> but<00:00:45.770> let's

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:46.460 
the thing that is problematic but let's

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.040 
the thing that is problematic but let's
start<00:00:46.700> with<00:00:46.850> the<00:00:46.940> definition<00:00:47.570> and<00:00:47.690> see<00:00:47.840> if<00:00:47.930> we

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.050 
start with the definition and see if we

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:51.580 
start with the definition and see if we
can<00:00:48.260> get<00:00:48.950> this<00:00:49.570> kind<00:00:50.570> of<00:00:50.720> nailed<00:00:50.960> down<00:00:51.200> because

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:51.590 
can get this kind of nailed down because

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:53.860 
can get this kind of nailed down because
it's<00:00:51.770> very<00:00:51.950> very<00:00:52.280> critical<00:00:52.460> so<00:00:53.390> you<00:00:53.450> have<00:00:53.690> your

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
it's very very critical so you have your

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:58.870 
it's very very critical so you have your
room<00:00:54.079> you<00:00:54.829> have<00:00:55.040> your<00:00:55.190> speakers<00:00:56.260> okay<00:00:57.640> we<00:00:58.640> know

00:00:58.870 --> 00:00:58.880 
room you have your speakers okay we know

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.080 
room you have your speakers okay we know
that<00:00:59.329> this<00:00:59.510> area<00:00:59.570> and<00:01:00.290> this<00:01:00.620> area<00:01:00.680> are<00:01:01.370> really

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:02.090 
that this area and this area are really

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.289 
that this area and this area are really
problematic<00:01:02.780> this<00:01:03.649> area<00:01:04.040> is<00:01:04.250> problematic<00:01:05.059> for

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:05.299 
problematic this area is problematic for

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:10.109 
problematic this area is problematic for
reflections<00:01:06.609> okay<00:01:07.609> and<00:01:08.170> this<00:01:09.170> area<00:01:09.499> here<00:01:10.009> is

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:10.119 
reflections okay and this area here is

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:14.200 
reflections okay and this area here is
problematic<00:01:11.119> for<00:01:11.149> pressure<00:01:12.670> so<00:01:13.670> we<00:01:13.789> have<00:01:13.939> two

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 
problematic for pressure so we have two

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:15.819 
problematic for pressure so we have two
issues<00:01:14.479> that<00:01:15.049> we<00:01:15.200> need<00:01:15.409> to<00:01:15.439> address

00:01:15.819 --> 00:01:15.829 
issues that we need to address

00:01:15.829 --> 00:01:19.270 
issues that we need to address
reflections<00:01:16.729> and<00:01:16.939> pressure<00:01:17.210> as<00:01:17.539> we<00:01:18.530> move<00:01:18.829> our

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
reflections and pressure as we move our

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:26.260 
reflections and pressure as we move our
speaker's<00:01:19.939> closer<00:01:21.310> to<00:01:22.310> the<00:01:22.490> wall<00:01:24.969> what<00:01:25.969> do<00:01:26.090> we

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
speaker's closer to the wall what do we

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.749 
speaker's closer to the wall what do we
have<00:01:26.509> we<00:01:26.929> shorten<00:01:27.439> this<00:01:27.619> distance<00:01:28.280> so<00:01:28.549> we

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:28.759 
have we shorten this distance so we

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:31.209 
have we shorten this distance so we
increase<00:01:29.450> both<00:01:29.899> of<00:01:30.170> these<00:01:30.350> issues

00:01:31.209 --> 00:01:31.219 
increase both of these issues

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:33.429 
increase both of these issues
exponentially<00:01:32.179> and<00:01:32.299> we<00:01:32.420> just<00:01:32.689> simply<00:01:32.929> can't

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:33.439 
exponentially and we just simply can't

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:35.800 
exponentially and we just simply can't
do<00:01:33.709> that<00:01:34.179> people<00:01:35.179> say<00:01:35.329> well<00:01:35.509> what's<00:01:35.719> the

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
do that people say well what's the

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.840 
do that people say well what's the
minimum<00:01:36.259> distance<00:01:36.469> between<00:01:36.950> the<00:01:37.340> side<00:01:37.579> walls

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
minimum distance between the side walls

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:39.999 
minimum distance between the side walls
and<00:01:38.060> I'm<00:01:38.299> going<00:01:38.479> to<00:01:38.509> tell<00:01:38.810> you<00:01:38.929> right<00:01:39.139> now<00:01:39.200> the

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:40.009 
and I'm going to tell you right now the

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:43.870 
and I'm going to tell you right now the
minimum<00:01:40.340> distance<00:01:40.639> is<00:01:41.149> 4<00:01:41.719> feet<00:01:42.639> let's<00:01:43.639> use

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
minimum distance is 4 feet let's use

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.120 
minimum distance is 4 feet let's use
that<00:01:44.090> as<00:01:44.329> our<00:01:44.509> benchmark<00:01:45.079> let's<00:01:45.380> don't<00:01:45.709> have

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
that as our benchmark let's don't have

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.279 
that as our benchmark let's don't have
speakers<00:01:46.490> any<00:01:47.060> closer<00:01:47.420> to<00:01:47.719> the<00:01:47.810> wall<00:01:47.990> any

00:01:48.279 --> 00:01:48.289 
speakers any closer to the wall any

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:50.199 
speakers any closer to the wall any
closer<00:01:48.649> than<00:01:48.889> 4<00:01:49.130> feet<00:01:49.369> here<00:01:49.670> to<00:01:49.849> the<00:01:49.969> front

00:01:50.199 --> 00:01:50.209 
closer than 4 feet here to the front

00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:52.929 
closer than 4 feet here to the front
wall<00:01:50.359> and<00:01:50.539> any<00:01:51.380> closer<00:01:51.740> than<00:01:52.069> 4<00:01:52.340> feet<00:01:52.369> to<00:01:52.819> the

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:52.939 
wall and any closer than 4 feet to the

wall and any closer than 4 feet to the
side<00:01:53.179> wall<00:01:53.389> what<00:01:54.170> happens<00:01:54.619> when<00:01:54.950> it<00:01:55.069> gets

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:55.189 
side wall what happens when it gets

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:58.289 
side wall what happens when it gets
closer<00:01:56.079> we<00:01:57.079> get<00:01:57.229> Distortion

00:01:58.289 --> 00:01:58.299 
closer we get Distortion

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:01.569 
closer we get Distortion
so<00:01:59.299> the<00:01:59.529> engineers<00:02:00.529> that<00:02:00.740> design<00:02:01.130> the<00:02:01.340> speaker

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:01.579 
so the engineers that design the speaker

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:04.629 
so the engineers that design the speaker
he<00:02:01.969> did<00:02:02.209> his<00:02:02.479> best<00:02:02.840> and<00:02:03.319> believe<00:02:04.130> me<00:02:04.279> they<00:02:04.459> do<00:02:04.520> a

00:02:04.629 --> 00:02:04.639 
he did his best and believe me they do a

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:07.870 
he did his best and believe me they do a
great<00:02:05.029> job<00:02:05.329> at<00:02:05.810> creating<00:02:06.740> an<00:02:06.859> instrument<00:02:07.639> that

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
great job at creating an instrument that

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.910 
great job at creating an instrument that
produces<00:02:08.030> sound<00:02:08.720> with<00:02:09.080> hardly<00:02:09.590> any

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
produces sound with hardly any

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.149 
produces sound with hardly any
distortion<00:02:10.840> produces<00:02:11.840> all<00:02:12.140> the<00:02:12.379> sounds<00:02:12.920> all

00:02:13.149 --> 00:02:13.159 
distortion produces all the sounds all

00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:16.150 
distortion produces all the sounds all
the<00:02:13.340> frequencies<00:02:13.909> without<00:02:14.230> Distortion

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
the frequencies without Distortion

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.190 
the frequencies without Distortion
or<00:02:16.250> distortion<00:02:16.970> solo<00:02:17.390> you'll<00:02:17.660> never<00:02:17.870> be<00:02:18.080> able

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
or distortion solo you'll never be able

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.440 
or distortion solo you'll never be able
to<00:02:18.350> hear<00:02:18.590> it<00:02:18.770> the<00:02:19.250> amplifier<00:02:19.760> will<00:02:20.000> never<00:02:20.240> be

to hear it the amplifier will never be
able<00:02:20.720> to<00:02:20.840> amplify<00:02:20.990> it<00:02:21.820> so<00:02:22.820> when<00:02:23.810> you<00:02:23.960> move<00:02:24.200> the

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
able to amplify it so when you move the

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.490 
able to amplify it so when you move the
speaker<00:02:24.770> close<00:02:25.310> to<00:02:25.520> the<00:02:25.670> wall<00:02:25.850> and<00:02:26.210> create<00:02:26.570> s<00:02:27.140> B

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
speaker close to the wall and create s B

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.150 
speaker close to the wall and create s B
ie<00:02:28.360> you<00:02:29.360> negate<00:02:29.810> everything<00:02:30.110> the<00:02:30.740> speaker

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
ie you negate everything the speaker

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.450 
ie you negate everything the speaker
engineer<00:02:31.730> did<00:02:32.000> to<00:02:32.270> the<00:02:32.390> speaker<00:02:32.980> you<00:02:33.980> create

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:34.460 
engineer did to the speaker you create

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:39.360 
engineer did to the speaker you create
this<00:02:35.090> area<00:02:35.690> of<00:02:36.850> reflections<00:02:37.850> here<00:02:38.330> or

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
this area of reflections here or

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.890 
this area of reflections here or
interference<00:02:40.370> boundary<00:02:41.000> effect<00:02:41.360> you're<00:02:41.630> so

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
interference boundary effect you're so

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.980 
interference boundary effect you're so
close<00:02:42.230> to<00:02:42.470> the<00:02:42.620> boundary<00:02:43.390> that<00:02:44.390> you<00:02:44.570> create

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:44.990 
close to the boundary that you create

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:48.610 
close to the boundary that you create
higher<00:02:45.470> pressure<00:02:45.920> areas<00:02:46.520> and<00:02:46.990> a<00:02:47.990> comb

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
higher pressure areas and a comb

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.510 
higher pressure areas and a comb
filtering<00:02:49.130> effect<00:02:50.530> between<00:02:51.530> the<00:02:51.800> speaker<00:02:52.370> and

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:52.520 
filtering effect between the speaker and

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.930 
filtering effect between the speaker and
the<00:02:53.030> wall<00:02:53.240> so<00:02:53.870> you<00:02:53.900> produce<00:02:54.380> distortion<00:02:55.220> what

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
the wall so you produce distortion what

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.870 
the wall so you produce distortion what
does<00:02:56.150> that<00:02:56.180> distortion<00:02:56.960> do<00:02:57.140> it<00:02:57.740> sounds<00:02:58.520> like

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
does that distortion do it sounds like

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.470 
does that distortion do it sounds like
another<00:02:59.090> speaker<00:03:00.280> it<00:03:01.280> produces<00:03:01.880> a<00:03:01.910> phantom

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
another speaker it produces a phantom

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.560 
another speaker it produces a phantom
image<00:03:02.930> so<00:03:03.410> now<00:03:03.440> you<00:03:03.680> have<00:03:04.160> a<00:03:04.460> speaker<00:03:04.760> that's

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:05.570 
image so now you have a speaker that's

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:08.500 
image so now you have a speaker that's
all<00:03:05.930> about<00:03:06.220> distortion<00:03:07.220> and<00:03:07.460> then<00:03:08.180> you<00:03:08.300> have<00:03:08.480> a

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
all about distortion and then you have a

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.750 
all about distortion and then you have a
speaker<00:03:09.050> here<00:03:09.350> that's<00:03:09.650> all<00:03:09.920> about<00:03:10.130> no

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
speaker here that's all about no

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.360 
speaker here that's all about no
distortion<00:03:11.600> and<00:03:11.810> producing<00:03:12.560> quality<00:03:12.770> sound

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
distortion and producing quality sound

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:17.380 
distortion and producing quality sound
so<00:03:14.180> then<00:03:14.450> these<00:03:14.720> two<00:03:15.190> the<00:03:16.190> phantom<00:03:16.670> image<00:03:17.120> and

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390 
so then these two the phantom image and

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:19.960 
so then these two the phantom image and
your<00:03:17.660> speaker<00:03:18.200> mix<00:03:18.500> together<00:03:18.800> so<00:03:19.670> at<00:03:19.820> the

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
your speaker mix together so at the

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:22.030 
your speaker mix together so at the
listing<00:03:20.360> position<00:03:20.959> you<00:03:21.500> get<00:03:21.680> a<00:03:21.740> combination

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
listing position you get a combination

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.940 
listing position you get a combination
of<00:03:22.670> both<00:03:22.820> and<00:03:23.209> that's<00:03:24.080> not<00:03:24.320> what<00:03:24.560> you<00:03:24.709> want

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
of both and that's not what you want

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.910 
of both and that's not what you want
your<00:03:25.790> your<00:03:26.240> room<00:03:26.540> then<00:03:26.870> is<00:03:27.050> really<00:03:27.500> working

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
your your room then is really working

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.699 
your your room then is really working
against<00:03:28.400> you<00:03:28.690> so<00:03:29.690> you<00:03:29.810> have<00:03:29.959> to<00:03:30.110> be<00:03:30.260> careful

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:30.709 
against you so you have to be careful

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:32.610 
against you so you have to be careful
because<00:03:30.800> it's<00:03:31.100> a<00:03:31.220> distortion<00:03:31.730> producing

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
because it's a distortion producing

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.710 
because it's a distortion producing
situation<00:03:33.620> I<00:03:34.280> see<00:03:34.550> some<00:03:34.820> situations<00:03:35.510> where

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:35.720 
situation I see some situations where

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.470 
situation I see some situations where
the<00:03:35.840> speaker<00:03:36.230> is<00:03:36.350> right<00:03:36.620> against<00:03:37.130> the<00:03:37.280> wall

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
the speaker is right against the wall

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.150 
the speaker is right against the wall
well<00:03:38.480> that's<00:03:38.660> you<00:03:38.990> just<00:03:39.200> can't<00:03:39.500> do<00:03:39.709> that

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.160 
well that's you just can't do that

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.580 
well that's you just can't do that
you<00:03:40.430> just<00:03:40.670> can't<00:03:40.880> produce<00:03:41.150> it<00:03:41.480> a<00:03:41.720> device

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
you just can't produce it a device

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:44.890 
you just can't produce it a device
that's<00:03:42.950> moving<00:03:43.340> and<00:03:43.730> vibrating<00:03:44.450> against

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
that's moving and vibrating against

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.600 
that's moving and vibrating against
another<00:03:45.200> structure<00:03:45.739> that<00:03:45.770> will<00:03:46.130> take<00:03:46.400> those

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:46.610 
another structure that will take those

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:49.720 
another structure that will take those
vibrations<00:03:47.120> and<00:03:47.540> move<00:03:47.750> also<00:03:48.260> so<00:03:49.250> you<00:03:49.310> have<00:03:49.550> to

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:49.730 
vibrations and move also so you have to

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:51.910 
vibrations and move also so you have to
be<00:03:49.850> very<00:03:50.120> very<00:03:50.360> careful<00:03:50.660> let's<00:03:51.110> use<00:03:51.380> four<00:03:51.680> feet

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:51.920 
be very very careful let's use four feet

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.150 
be very very careful let's use four feet
is<00:03:52.160> our<00:03:52.370> minimum<00:03:52.910> distance<00:03:53.480> between<00:03:54.440> the<00:03:54.920> side

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:55.160 
is our minimum distance between the side

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.400 
is our minimum distance between the side
wall<00:03:55.400> I<00:03:55.430> think<00:03:55.850> that's<00:03:56.030> a<00:03:56.180> good<00:03:56.450> benchmark<00:03:57.050> to

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410 
wall I think that's a good benchmark to

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:01.660 
wall I think that's a good benchmark to
shoot<00:03:57.650> for<00:03:58.390> not<00:03:59.390> six<00:03:59.989> inches<00:04:00.410> not<00:04:00.920> two<00:04:01.220> inches

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:01.670 
shoot for not six inches not two inches

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:03.850 
shoot for not six inches not two inches
not<00:04:01.970> right<00:04:02.270> against<00:04:02.720> the<00:04:02.840> wall<00:04:03.020> but<00:04:03.290> four<00:04:03.590> feet

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:03.860 
not right against the wall but four feet

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:05.949 
not right against the wall but four feet
forty<00:04:04.430> eight<00:04:04.550> inches<00:04:04.760> let's<00:04:05.180> use<00:04:05.420> that<00:04:05.600> as<00:04:05.780> our

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:05.959 
forty eight inches let's use that as our

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:08.890 
forty eight inches let's use that as our
benchmark<00:04:06.640> stay<00:04:07.640> away<00:04:07.910> from<00:04:07.970> the<00:04:08.300> phantom<00:04:08.720> in

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 
benchmark stay away from the phantom in

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.800 
benchmark stay away from the phantom in
images<00:04:09.560> and<00:04:09.590> we<00:04:10.489> don't<00:04:10.760> want<00:04:10.970> to<00:04:11.090> increase<00:04:11.420> the

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:11.810 
images and we don't want to increase the

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:13.810 
images and we don't want to increase the
pressure<00:04:12.080> here<00:04:12.770> our<00:04:13.010> goal<00:04:13.220> is<00:04:13.430> to<00:04:13.459> minimize

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:13.820 
pressure here our goal is to minimize

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:16.270 
pressure here our goal is to minimize
the<00:04:14.480> pressure<00:04:14.890> because<00:04:15.890> the<00:04:16.070> higher<00:04:16.250> the

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:16.280 
the pressure because the higher the

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:18.340 
the pressure because the higher the
pressure<00:04:16.820> in<00:04:17.120> this<00:04:17.239> area<00:04:17.630> the<00:04:17.780> higher<00:04:17.959> the

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:18.350 
pressure in this area the higher the

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:20.560 
pressure in this area the higher the
low-frequency<00:04:18.730> issues<00:04:19.730> and<00:04:19.970> distortions

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:20.570 
low-frequency issues and distortions

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:22.540 
low-frequency issues and distortions
become<00:04:20.930> the<00:04:21.440> more<00:04:21.650> treatment<00:04:22.190> we're<00:04:22.340> going<00:04:22.490> to

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:22.550 
become the more treatment we're going to

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:26.010 
become the more treatment we're going to
have<00:04:22.730> to<00:04:22.910> put<00:04:23.150> in<00:04:23.360> to<00:04:24.080> solve<00:04:24.350> those<00:04:24.620> issues<00:04:25.160> so

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
have to put in to solve those issues so

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.840 
have to put in to solve those issues so
keep<00:04:27.020> the<00:04:27.260> speaker<00:04:27.710> as<00:04:27.890> far<00:04:28.160> away<00:04:28.340> from<00:04:28.490> the

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:28.850 
keep the speaker as far away from the

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:29.890 
keep the speaker as far away from the
side<00:04:29.090> walls<00:04:29.450> in<00:04:29.750> the

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 
side walls in the

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.350 
side walls in the
front<00:04:30.110> wall<00:04:30.320> as<00:04:30.560> you<00:04:30.680> can<00:04:30.979> because<00:04:31.880> we<00:04:32.150> got

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 
front wall as you can because we got

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.900
