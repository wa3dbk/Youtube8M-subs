00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:06.450
 Hi, I'm Charlie and I come to 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:10.590
 show them a comparison between 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:14.320
 adidas f50 leonel messi boots and nike 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:18.820
 mercurial citrus 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:21.010
 first of all the boots in terms of 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:23.260
 design 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:26.580
 You can see that the adidas boots are 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.580
 much shorter 

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:32.940
 that the nike boots the nike boots that 

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:32.940
 they reach to cover a little more the foot 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.219
 that the boots to days 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:43.840
 as for the sole 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:47.680
 good different materials a plastic 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:50.530
 It is a different plastic alloy 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:53.530
 the material of the areas feels a 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:55.899
 both slightly lighter touch as 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:58.630
 when you have them on when you step on 

00:00:55.899 --> 00:01:00.300
 feels very very light 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:03.260
 And it is 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:07.310
 quite flexible 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:10.240
 the mercurial feel a little more 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.240
 hard to 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:16.490
 having them on the feet but they are 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.530
 quite flexible 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:21.500
 the botÃ³ has 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.810
 in the sole more coverage in the 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.170
 areas of the ankle and tip which although 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:29.600
 it seems to me that it generates more stability 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:32.710
 that the adidas boots which come 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.710
 totally flat 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:40.120
 touch is triangular of the squirrels 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:46.910
 they are acceptable more however I prefer 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:49.280
 I prefer the nike mix 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:52.310
 which is crossed and offers a greater 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:56.570
 grip when you're running or when 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:59.200
 you are static about to about 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:01.899
 finish a shot 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:05.409
 from the material part of the material 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:08.619
 in which the areas in this 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:11.240
 edition is the leonel messi are made 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:13.810
 synthetic leather 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:17.000
 you can get them in natural leather 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.710
 but not the edition of leo messi the 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.610
 limited edition of leo messi all comes 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:25.330
 in synthetic leather which is a bit 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.330
 uncomfortable as 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:31.320
 the shoes are too tight and 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.450
 it can become a problem since you 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:36.300
 they're going to tighten a lot when you're 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.760
 running since the design is very flat 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:41.330
 over the shoe the tip is fine 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.330
 adjusted 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:48.380
 and someone kill good do not you feel so 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:51.410
 soft the fact of receiving a ball 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:53.840
 control it or topping it strong or not 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:57.400
 you feel you do not feel a true 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.400
 addiction to the ball 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:05.100
 on the side of the mercury nike is a 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:08.069
 synthetic leather but includes some 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:10.540
 perforations which are seen in the 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:14.170
 detail 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:17.140
 the perforations what they have contributed is 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:20.260
 that give you a flexibility or 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:22.269
 elasticity to the material high enough 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:26.230
 something to do a demonstration this is the 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:30.050
 tongue and here you can see what elastic 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:32.490
 what happens to be this synthetic leather 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:34.500
 I do not really know the material with the 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:37.390
 which is mixed must be leather 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:41.340
 Synthetic and a plastic alloy 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:41.340
 but it has a softness 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:46.910
 which is far superior to the adidas since 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.650
 that the diaz is strong is a leather that 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:51.740
 you feel strong and you really can not 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:54.970
 to stretch 

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:54.970
 it's pretty hard 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:03.070
 by the sides of the spindle 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:07.290
 good if you like speed can 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:07.290
 use the wings 50 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:13.260
 They are light enough to run 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:16.590
 for shots and ball control I do not 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:20.250
 they seem so useful but they have the 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:21.930
 advantage that they have have the cavity 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:25.220
 in the sole to use the device 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:25.220
 from 10 michaels 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:32.560
 and so you can track their 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:39.289
 tours on the mercury side 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:40.729
 they have a much higher performance in 

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:45.500
 about ball control since the 

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:48.910
 softness so you really feel like 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.910
 a glove on the shoe 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:56.300
 that fits leather quite well to 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:05:01.449
 then your foot can handle the ball 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:04.240
 and fuck in a pretty good way 

00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:08.080
 for my part since I used the two 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:10.569
 models and I will always prefer the 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:14.660
 nike about them they seem a lot 

00:05:10.569 --> 00:05:16.880
 more comfortable and I think a shoe 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:21.080
 I think it's a superior shoe in terms of 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:24.390
 in terms of price and in terms of 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:28.920
 Nike performance 

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:32.610
 for me they are much more comfortable to use 

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:35.420
 that the squirrels and well I prefer 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:35.420
 sacrifice comfort 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:40.629
 have less speed but have more 

00:05:38.259 --> 00:05:43.900
 community to have greater speed but 

00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:46.780
 you can be uncomfortable all about 90 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:51.190
 minutes so you can if you have some 

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:52.930
 questions or have a few preferences I 

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:54.490
 I would like you to let me know in 

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:58.139
 the comments 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:58.139
 chau and bye bye hug goal
