00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:37.469

 aspects of the English verb and now 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:49.800
 it's time to talk about the structure 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:52.739
 English sentences in general I want 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:56.010

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.780
 special details got some kind of overview 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.359
 representation of all major 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.739
 component sentences from a height 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:06.510

 so say watching this movie you do not 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:12.450
 need to understand and remember 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:15.689
 absolutely all his goal is to help you better 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.780
 digest the details of english morphology in 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.700
 follow up lessons 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:23.240
 Further, as I have repeatedly said 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.740
 learn english versus russian 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.640
 necessary but only in one important 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.659
 perspective 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:34.290
 in pronunciation and grammar are best 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:37.640
 as soon as possible begin to study purely with 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:40.409
 point of view english english 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:43.799
 analytical language of the German group a 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:46.950
 Russian is not analytical Slavic 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.430
 groups of grammar and morphology of these 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.180
 languages 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:53.520
 too different therefore based on 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.490
 Russian grammatical mentality so 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.549
 say you'll just be too long and 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.469
 difficult to rebuild 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:02.579
 it is better to learn English grammar with 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.860
 clean slate 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:07.340
 forget all that you know about 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.570
 Grammar in Russian 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.990
 so I will try my best 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:13.820
 refer less to Russian grammar and 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:15.330
 use a lot of english 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.840
 grammatical terms 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:22.310

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.310
 frightened you get
