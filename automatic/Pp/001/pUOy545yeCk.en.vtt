good but you need that scavenger because

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:47.910 
good but you need that scavenger because
you<00:03:46.600> want<00:03:46.810> that<00:03:46.989> extra<00:03:47.200> couple<00:03:47.440> claymores

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.040 
in the long run but in certain destroy

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.020 
in the long run but in certain destroy
you're<00:03:51.190> not<00:03:51.310> going<00:03:51.430> to<00:03:51.489> want<00:03:51.579> that<00:03:51.760> scavenger

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
you're not going to want that scavenger

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:53.759 
you're not going to want that scavenger
because<00:03:52.630> you're<00:03:53.170> not<00:03:53.290> going<00:03:53.410> to<00:03:53.470> run<00:03:53.560> into<00:03:53.680> a

because you're not going to run into a

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:55.740 
because you're not going to run into a
clip<00:03:54.040> and<00:03:54.280> if<00:03:55.060> you're<00:03:55.239> only<00:03:55.329> going<00:03:55.480> to<00:03:55.540> kill

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
clip and if you're only going to kill

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:58.590 
clip and if you're only going to kill
one<00:03:55.989> to<00:03:56.170> two<00:03:56.739> people<00:03:57.130> maybe<00:03:57.700> more<00:03:57.820> people<00:03:58.180> max

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:58.600 
one to two people maybe more people max

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.770 
one to two people maybe more people max
around<00:03:59.430> you're<00:04:00.430> only<00:04:00.610> gonna<00:04:00.880> keep<00:04:01.090> up<00:04:01.209> pick<00:04:01.660> up

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:01.780 
around you're only gonna keep up pick up

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:03.810 
around you're only gonna keep up pick up
a<00:04:01.930> couple<00:04:02.079> of<00:04:02.230> scavenger<00:04:02.620> packs<00:04:02.860> right<00:04:03.130> so

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:03.820 
a couple of scavenger packs right so

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:05.280 
a couple of scavenger packs right so
what's<00:04:04.030> the<00:04:04.120> point<00:04:04.269> of<00:04:04.390> having<00:04:04.540> scavenger<00:04:05.079> I

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
what's the point of having scavenger I

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:08.220 
what's the point of having scavenger I
think<00:04:05.950> and<00:04:06.160> not<00:04:06.250> in<00:04:06.430> that<00:04:06.820> way<00:04:07.110> scavenger<00:04:08.110> is

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.230 
think and not in that way scavenger is

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:10.590 
think and not in that way scavenger is
probably<00:04:08.500> the<00:04:08.650> most<00:04:08.680> useless<00:04:09.100> perk<00:04:09.610> in<00:04:09.820> search

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:10.600 
probably the most useless perk in search

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.380 
probably the most useless perk in search
destroy<00:04:10.870> and<00:04:11.320> other<00:04:11.950> game<00:04:12.220> modes<00:04:12.370> just<00:04:12.640> one<00:04:13.329> of

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:13.390 
destroy and other game modes just one of

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:15.220 
destroy and other game modes just one of
my<00:04:13.450> favorite<00:04:13.900> but

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.230 
my favorite but

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:20.349 
my favorite but
that's<00:04:15.680> it<00:04:15.860> and<00:04:16.840> so<00:04:17.840> I<00:04:18.669> basically<00:04:19.669> cover<00:04:20.090> that

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:20.359 
that's it and so I basically cover that

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:22.060 
that's it and so I basically cover that
pretty<00:04:20.930> well<00:04:21.109> I<00:04:21.320> hope<00:04:21.440> you<00:04:21.590> guys<00:04:21.709> think<00:04:21.949> so

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.070 
pretty well I hope you guys think so

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:26.700 
pretty well I hope you guys think so

Tiffany objects so on to m16 and panics
that<00:04:27.710> is<00:04:28.010> a<00:04:28.669> very<00:04:29.180> debatable<00:04:29.870> pic<00:04:30.110> is<00:04:30.320> very

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:30.979 
that is a very debatable pic is very

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:33.219 
that is a very debatable pic is very
opinionated<00:04:31.570> when<00:04:32.570> people<00:04:32.930> are<00:04:33.020> picking

00:04:33.219 --> 00:04:33.229 
opinionated when people are picking

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:35.430 
opinionated when people are picking
between<00:04:33.500> each<00:04:33.800> gun<00:04:34.010> they're<00:04:34.729> both<00:04:34.850> rebirths

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:35.440 
between each gun they're both rebirths

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:40.090 
between each gun they're both rebirths
these<00:04:36.440> staffs<00:04:36.979> behind<00:04:37.400> it<00:04:37.550> the<00:04:38.389> m16<00:04:39.350> shoots

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:40.100 
these staffs behind it the m16 shoots

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.180 
these staffs behind it the m16 shoots
faster<00:04:41.000> you<00:04:41.270> can<00:04:41.449> shoot<00:04:41.660> the<00:04:42.010> between<00:04:43.010> each

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:43.190 
faster you can shoot the between each

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:48.159 
faster you can shoot the between each
three<00:04:44.120> round<00:04:44.360> burst<00:04:44.660> faster<00:04:45.290> um<00:04:46.360> the<00:04:47.360> m16<00:04:47.960> is

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:48.169 
three round burst faster um the m16 is

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:52.300 
three round burst faster um the m16 is
less<00:04:48.470> accurate<00:04:49.010> and<00:04:49.990> I<00:04:50.990> believe<00:04:51.860> the<00:04:52.130> famous

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:52.310 
less accurate and I believe the famous

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:55.510 
less accurate and I believe the famous
is<00:04:52.699> I<00:04:53.150> think<00:04:53.479> five<00:04:54.020> less<00:04:54.410> damage<00:04:54.860> it<00:04:55.070> says<00:04:55.310> in

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:55.520 
is I think five less damage it says in

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:57.760 
is I think five less damage it says in
the<00:04:55.550> game<00:04:55.820> that's<00:04:56.449> a<00:04:56.600> lot<00:04:56.780> that's<00:04:56.810> less<00:04:57.320> damage

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:57.770 
the game that's a lot that's less damage

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:00.550 
the game that's a lot that's less damage
but<00:04:58.010> don't<00:04:58.729> take<00:04:58.940> any<00:04:59.180> of<00:04:59.360> those<00:04:59.539> stats<00:05:00.080> for

asst it's talking about each bullet you
have<00:05:09.620> a<00:05:09.680> three<00:05:10.039> bullet<00:05:10.370> first<00:05:10.639> it's<00:05:11.270> gonna<00:05:11.510> be

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:11.750 
have a three bullet first it's gonna be

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:15.340 
have a three bullet first it's gonna be
pretty<00:05:12.260> good<00:05:12.590> right<00:05:13.600> it's<00:05:14.600> gonna<00:05:14.810> take<00:05:15.050> up<00:05:15.320> to

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:15.350 
pretty good right it's gonna take up to

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:18.490 
pretty good right it's gonna take up to
two<00:05:16.160> to<00:05:16.850> three<00:05:17.060> bullets<00:05:17.360> but<00:05:17.539> with<00:05:18.350> the

two to three bullets but with the

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.500 
two to three bullets but with the
families<00:05:19.000> you're<00:05:20.000> going<00:05:20.150> to<00:05:20.210> need<00:05:20.389> the

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:20.510 
families you're going to need the

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:22.659 
families you're going to need the
accuracy<00:05:21.110> not<00:05:21.560> give<00:05:21.830> an<00:05:21.950> accuracy<00:05:22.310> that<00:05:22.550> you

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:22.669 
accuracy not give an accuracy that you

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:24.760 
accuracy not give an accuracy that you
comes<00:05:22.880> with<00:05:23.240> the<00:05:23.360> fastest<00:05:23.750> and<00:05:23.990> not<00:05:24.110> the<00:05:24.229> m16

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:24.770 
comes with the fastest and not the m16

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:28.089 
comes with the fastest and not the m16
and<00:05:25.280> let's<00:05:25.430> use<00:05:25.610> holographic<00:05:26.330> and<00:05:26.800> if<00:05:27.800> you<00:05:27.919> put

00:05:28.089 --> 00:05:28.099 
and let's use holographic and if you put

00:05:28.099 --> 00:05:30.100 
and let's use holographic and if you put
a<00:05:28.130> holographic<00:05:28.610> on<00:05:28.849> a<00:05:28.880> feminist<00:05:29.389> holy<00:05:29.690> crap

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:30.110 
a holographic on a feminist holy crap

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:31.360 
a holographic on a feminist holy crap
it's<00:05:30.289> gonna<00:05:30.380> go<00:05:30.530> in<00:05:30.590> a<00:05:30.650> straight<00:05:30.830> line<00:05:30.919> it's

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:31.370 
it's gonna go in a straight line it's

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:32.800 
it's gonna go in a straight line it's
going<00:05:31.550> to<00:05:31.610> be<00:05:31.700> hook<00:05:32.000> line<00:05:32.030> and<00:05:32.389> sinker<00:05:32.419> right

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:32.810 
going to be hook line and sinker right

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:34.390 
going to be hook line and sinker right
there<00:05:33.020> it's<00:05:33.200> going<00:05:33.320> to<00:05:33.410> be<00:05:33.500> easy<00:05:33.710> kill<00:05:33.979> for<00:05:34.190> you

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:34.400 
there it's going to be easy kill for you

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:39.460 
there it's going to be easy kill for you
so<00:05:35.200> in<00:05:36.200> my<00:05:36.349> opinion<00:05:36.440> I'm<00:05:37.370> I'm<00:05:38.139> leaning<00:05:39.139> towards

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:39.470 
so in my opinion I'm I'm leaning towards

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:42.580 
so in my opinion I'm I'm leaning towards
the<00:05:39.560> famous<00:05:39.979> I've<00:05:40.250> used<00:05:40.280> both<00:05:40.729> guns<00:05:41.000> lots<00:05:41.590> not

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:42.590 
the famous I've used both guns lots not

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:44.860 
the famous I've used both guns lots not
Hans<00:05:42.979> I<00:05:43.160> haven't<00:05:43.430> hoard<00:05:43.669> them<00:05:43.789> out<00:05:43.910> but<00:05:44.419> I<00:05:44.630> like

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:44.870 
Hans I haven't hoard them out but I like

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:48.250 
Hans I haven't hoard them out but I like
both<00:05:45.289> guns<00:05:45.560> and<00:05:45.950> I<00:05:46.450> think<00:05:47.450> fast<00:05:47.660> is<00:05:47.900> the<00:05:48.020> best

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:48.260 
both guns and I think fast is the best

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:50.650 
both guns and I think fast is the best
and<00:05:48.560> I'm<00:05:49.340> usually<00:05:49.550> going<00:05:49.820> to<00:05:49.880> use<00:05:50.060> red<00:05:50.330> dot<00:05:50.510> in

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:50.660 
and I'm usually going to use red dot in

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:52.990 
and I'm usually going to use red dot in
the<00:05:50.720> famous<00:05:51.080> just<00:05:51.289> because<00:05:51.680> the<00:05:52.520> accuracy<00:05:52.970> is

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:53.000 
the famous just because the accuracy is

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.550 
the famous just because the accuracy is
already<00:05:53.330> good<00:05:53.479> I<00:05:53.750> don't<00:05:54.080> need<00:05:54.169> that<00:05:54.349> extra

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:54.560 
already good I don't need that extra

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:58.150 
already good I don't need that extra
five<00:05:54.830> percent<00:05:55.250> accuracy<00:05:55.669> and<00:05:56.470> the<00:05:57.470> red<00:05:57.680> dot<00:05:57.889> is

00:05:58.150 --> 00:05:58.160 
five percent accuracy and the red dot is

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.540 
five percent accuracy and the red dot is
so<00:05:58.520> small<00:05:58.849> in<00:05:59.150> modern<00:05:59.570> 42<00:05:59.930> that<00:06:00.710> is<00:06:01.039> just<00:06:01.220> so

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:01.550 
so small in modern 42 that is just so

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:03.969 
so small in modern 42 that is just so
beautiful<00:06:01.580> because<00:06:02.240> oh<00:06:02.660> it's<00:06:03.590> just<00:06:03.800> so

00:06:03.969 --> 00:06:03.979 
beautiful because oh it's just so

00:06:03.979 --> 00:06:07.150 
beautiful because oh it's just so
beautiful<00:06:04.330> it's<00:06:05.330> it<00:06:05.990> takes<00:06:06.200> up<00:06:06.410> so<00:06:06.740> little

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:07.160 
beautiful it's it takes up so little

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:08.770 
beautiful it's it takes up so little
just<00:06:07.550> I<00:06:07.639> went<00:06:07.789> to<00:06:07.880> shooting<00:06:08.150> is<00:06:08.240> so<00:06:08.389> precise

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:08.780 
just I went to shooting is so precise

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:10.870 
just I went to shooting is so precise
and<00:06:08.810> you<00:06:09.080> can<00:06:09.200> see<00:06:09.440> so<00:06:09.680> perfectly<00:06:10.190> and<00:06:10.700> it

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:10.880 
and you can see so perfectly and it

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:12.730 
and you can see so perfectly and it
doesn't<00:06:11.150> hog<00:06:11.330> up<00:06:11.539> your<00:06:11.750> whole<00:06:12.020> like<00:06:12.380> iron

00:06:17.439 --> 00:06:17.449 
around you and you're not missing out on

around you and you're not missing out on
the<00:06:17.720> opportunity<00:06:17.750> to<00:06:18.320> get<00:06:18.380> a<00:06:18.440> kill<00:06:18.729> especially

00:06:19.719 --> 00:06:19.729 
the opportunity to get a kill especially

00:06:19.729 --> 00:06:21.659 
the opportunity to get a kill especially
if<00:06:19.789> you<00:06:19.880> don't<00:06:20.060> have<00:06:20.210> a<00:06:20.419> slight<00:06:20.750> of<00:06:20.870> hand<00:06:20.900> on

if you don't have a slight of hand on

00:06:21.669 --> 00:06:24.969 
if you don't have a slight of hand on
use<00:06:22.669> a<00:06:22.699> red<00:06:22.970> dot<00:06:23.180> not<00:06:23.479> a<00:06:23.539> holographic<00:06:24.020> yes

00:06:24.969 --> 00:06:24.979 
use a red dot not a holographic yes

00:06:24.979 --> 00:06:26.320 
use a red dot not a holographic yes
because<00:06:25.310> it's<00:06:25.460> going<00:06:25.550> to<00:06:25.610> take<00:06:25.849> longer<00:06:26.060> time

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:26.330 
because it's going to take longer time

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:27.760 
because it's going to take longer time
to<00:06:26.390> pull<00:06:26.659> up<00:06:26.719> the<00:06:26.840> holographic<00:06:27.260> and<00:06:27.590> it's

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:27.770 
to pull up the holographic and it's

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:28.150 
to pull up the holographic and it's
covering

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:28.160 
covering
