00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
you actually make the drivers really

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.810 
you actually make the drivers really
compatible<00:03:45.900> like<00:03:46.530> we<00:03:47.370> don't<00:03:47.430> have<00:03:47.520> to<00:03:47.670> worry

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:47.820

really good for the most part feels
better<00:04:04.740> than<00:04:04.890> the<00:04:05.070> ps3<00:04:05.670> controller<00:04:06.060> in

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:06.270 
better than the ps3 controller in

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:08.720 
better than the ps3 controller in
journal<00:04:06.660> but<00:04:06.870> there's<00:04:07.710> a<00:04:07.770> few<00:04:07.890> things<00:04:08.100> I<00:04:08.340> you

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:13.890 
maybe control is really expensive to

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:15.350 
maybe control is really expensive to
make<00:04:14.040> I<00:04:14.160> wouldn't<00:04:14.400> be<00:04:14.490> surprised<00:04:14.880> but<00:04:15.120> not

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
part i really like in the controller the

the 360 gamepad the actual analytics i

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:36.430 
the 360 gamepad the actual analytics i
have<00:04:35.970> the<00:04:36.090> grooves

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.440 
have the grooves

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:39.490 
have the grooves
outside<00:04:36.860> which<00:04:37.010> was<00:04:37.130> really<00:04:37.370> nice<00:04:38.500> responsive

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:39.500

just<00:04:39.980> a<00:04:40.040> good<00:04:40.220> controller<00:04:40.580> I<00:04:40.820> like<00:04:41.330> the<00:04:41.540> actual

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.110 
just a good controller I like the actual

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:44.470 
just a good controller I like the actual
width<00:04:42.260> of<00:04:42.380> it<00:04:42.560> they<00:04:42.890> increased<00:04:43.280> it<00:04:43.400> by<00:04:43.940> a<00:04:44.150> few

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:44.480 
width of it they increased it by a few

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:47.260
