00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:03.379 

underneath<00:00:00.840> that<00:00:01.170> okay<00:00:01.860> I<00:00:02.010> don't<00:00:02.489> know<00:00:02.639> that's

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:03.389 
underneath that okay I don't know that's

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:10.650 
underneath that okay I don't know that's
until<00:00:03.719> this

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:10.660 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:13.360 

and<00:00:11.660> I<00:00:11.720> think<00:00:12.100> Isis<00:00:13.100> is<00:00:13.340> a

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:13.370 
and I think Isis is a

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:15.700 
and I think Isis is a
hundred-mile-an-hour<00:00:14.290> speedo<00:00:15.290> which<00:00:15.559> would

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:15.710 
hundred-mile-an-hour speedo which would

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:19.820 
hundred-mile-an-hour speedo which would
be<00:00:15.860> more<00:00:16.070> kilometres<00:00:16.640> presumably

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.490 

I<00:00:19.859> think<00:00:20.490> this<00:00:20.640> went<00:00:21.480> to<00:00:21.599> commit<00:00:21.869> more<00:00:22.230> on<00:00:22.349> the

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
I think this went to commit more on the

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
I think this went to commit more on the
Isis

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:24.520

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.200 
moon
used<00:02:03.110> to<00:02:03.200> be<00:02:03.320> nothing<00:02:04.070> hot<00:02:04.430> lights<00:02:04.730> top<00:02:04.970> of<00:02:05.120> the

hook

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.900 

this<00:02:13.630> is<00:02:13.780> an<00:02:14.290> export<00:02:14.710> model<00:02:15.010> so<00:02:15.640> it<00:02:15.760> has<00:02:15.880> a

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
this is an export model so it has a

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:17.640 
this is an export model so it has a
really<00:02:16.300> low<00:02:16.450> compression<00:02:16.870> engine<00:02:17.290> so<00:02:17.560> it

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
really low compression engine so it

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.490 
really low compression engine so it
hasn't<00:02:17.860> got<00:02:18.070> very<00:02:18.280> much<00:02:18.430> power<00:02:18.670> so<00:02:19.450> it's<00:02:20.350> going

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
hasn't got very much power so it's going

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:21.150 
hasn't got very much power so it's going
slow

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160

okay<00:03:27.040> more<00:03:27.340> that's<00:03:27.550> really<00:03:28.060> size<00:03:28.450> when<00:03:29.320> you

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
okay more that's really size when you

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:31.230 
okay more that's really size when you
come<00:03:29.620> to

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:31.240 
come to

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:34.260 
come to
in<00:03:31.900> high<00:03:32.260> speed<00:03:32.560> is<00:03:32.740> 20<00:03:33.370> meters<00:03:33.820> more<00:03:34.000> than<00:03:34.060> it

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:34.270 
in high speed is 20 meters more than it

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:36.330 
in high speed is 20 meters more than it
is<00:03:34.390> equally<00:03:35.020> slightly<00:03:35.500> inaccurate<00:03:35.710> I<00:03:36.010> think

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
is equally slightly inaccurate I think

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.620 
is equally slightly inaccurate I think
it's<00:03:36.490> not<00:03:36.640> far<00:03:36.880> off

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:38.630 
it's not far off

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:39.880 
it's not far off
I've<00:03:38.750> been<00:03:38.930> accused<00:03:39.170> of<00:03:39.380> going<00:03:39.500> too<00:03:39.710> fast

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:39.890 
I've been accused of going too fast

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:41.589 
I've been accused of going too fast
before

00:03:41.589 --> 00:03:41.599 
before

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:43.360 
before
but<00:03:42.079> you<00:03:42.170> can<00:03:42.290> tell<00:03:42.499> when<00:03:42.530> the<00:03:42.920> gear<00:03:43.099> change

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
but you can tell when the gear change

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.130 
but you can tell when the gear change
with<00:03:43.700> it<00:03:43.849> with<00:03:44.150> the<00:03:44.239> overdrive<00:03:44.719> it's<00:03:44.930> just

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.140 
with it with the overdrive it's just

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:47.199 
with it with the overdrive it's just
bizarre<00:03:45.499> because<00:03:46.189> the<00:03:46.280> three<00:03:46.549> wheel<00:03:46.760> which<00:03:47.060> is

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209 
bizarre because the three wheel which is

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:50.680 
bizarre because the three wheel which is
like<00:03:47.359> so<00:03:47.659> on

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:50.690 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:53.430 

UK<00:03:51.020> won't<00:03:51.320> change<00:03:51.590> it<00:03:51.830> automatically

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.440 
UK won't change it automatically

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.370 
UK won't change it automatically
we<00:03:53.590> have<00:03:53.740> to

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:57.380 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:59.260 

okay<00:03:57.680> back<00:03:57.950> off<00:03:58.070> of<00:03:58.280> them

00:03:59.260 --> 00:03:59.270 
okay back off of them

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:00.940 
okay back off of them
you're<00:03:59.420> letting<00:03:59.630> supercilious

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:00.950 
you're letting supercilious

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:04.309 
you're letting supercilious
just<00:04:01.310> just<00:04:01.580> lift<00:04:01.760> often

00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:04.319 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:07.190 

when<00:04:04.680> we<00:04:04.799> slow<00:04:05.010> down<00:04:05.390> there's<00:04:06.390> a<00:04:06.480> relay<00:04:06.900> the

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
when we slow down there's a relay the

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.319 
when we slow down there's a relay the
relay<00:04:07.500> on<00:04:07.650> that<00:04:07.799> on<00:04:08.069> the<00:04:08.189> dashboard<00:04:08.640> on<00:04:09.150> the

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:09.329 
relay on that on the dashboard on the

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:10.980 
relay on that on the dashboard on the
bulkhead

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:10.990 
bulkhead

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:14.280 
bulkhead
there's<00:04:11.560> a<00:04:11.680> speed<00:04:12.630> is<00:04:13.630> not<00:04:13.780> a<00:04:13.810> governor<00:04:14.260> with

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.290 
there's a speed is not a governor with

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:16.909 
there's a speed is not a governor with
the<00:04:14.470> speed<00:04:15.010> sensor<00:04:15.760> on

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
the speed sensor on

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:19.729 
the speed sensor on
speed<00:04:17.310> limiter<00:04:17.789> really<00:04:18.150> on<00:04:18.239> the<00:04:18.359> airbox<00:04:18.739> it

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
speed limiter really on the airbox it

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:22.149 
speed limiter really on the airbox it
operates<00:04:20.430> at<00:04:20.639> about<00:04:20.729> thirty<00:04:21.299> miles<00:04:21.599> an<00:04:21.749> hour

00:04:22.149 --> 00:04:22.159 
operates at about thirty miles an hour

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:25.219 
operates at about thirty miles an hour
so<00:04:23.159> you<00:04:23.219> can<00:04:23.340> engage<00:04:23.759> overdrive<00:04:24.389> above<00:04:24.960> stirs

00:04:25.219 --> 00:04:25.229 
so you can engage overdrive above stirs

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:27.290 
so you can engage overdrive above stirs
you<00:04:25.529> can<00:04:25.650> hear<00:04:25.770> the<00:04:25.889> relay<00:04:26.159> click

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
you can hear the relay click

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.229 
you can hear the relay click
my<00:04:27.539> name's<00:04:27.720> of<00:04:27.930> it<00:04:28.080> is
