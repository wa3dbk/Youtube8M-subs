00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.930

00:02:31.539 --> 00:02:31.549 
were in school but we all decided we

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:33.250 
were in school but we all decided we
were<00:02:31.700> going<00:02:31.849> to<00:02:31.940> work<00:02:32.120> for<00:02:32.420> the<00:02:32.540> church<00:02:32.780> and

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
when we decide to work for the church it

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.710 
when we decide to work for the church it
got<00:02:36.680> more<00:02:36.980> and<00:02:37.040> more<00:02:37.250> like<00:02:38.000> a<00:02:38.030> business

got more and more like a business

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.280

instead<00:02:39.319> of<00:02:39.560> a<00:02:39.829> church<00:02:40.489> and<00:02:40.880> then<00:02:41.420> it<00:02:41.840> started

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
instead of a church and then it started

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.530 
instead of a church and then it started
to<00:02:42.470> have<00:02:42.680> more<00:02:42.920> and<00:02:43.130> more<00:02:43.220> control<00:02:43.730> over<00:02:44.120> what

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540
