00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.310
 hello welcome to my game of the month as 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.750
 well you have seen in the introduction of 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.800
 last night the game that we are going to try 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.259
 during this month 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.349
 December year's xavi is to be in 

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:30.300
 wanderers a game published by ace 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:33.030
 model and maybe it's the game that 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.890
 most successful among most of 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.870
 the people that I know and that is 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.399
 as you say marta you have always seen 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.500
 change in it in the video introduction 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.260
 We do not know anyone who has tried 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.050
 seven wonders and did not like to be 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.850
 a wonders is a more light game more 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.770
 light of what the games that we come 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.900
 trying usually is a game of 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.690
 letters basically very fast very 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:56.640
 entertaining and also very addictive since 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.430
 When you play, you always want to go back to 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.920
 play not for nothing has all the 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.350
 prizes that you can see around here good in 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.420
 the one behind the box that looks like 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.009
 prizes of all of all types 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.290
 they take a lot of a lot of 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:11.820
 them and it is of course by something and that is 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.829
 it's a very complete game very fast very 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.659
 easy to understand and they also contain 

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:17.560
 tension to the players that it puts me 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:21.100
 of the nerves in wenders because 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:23.020
 it's a game where it's very simple very 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.220
 easy to be clear about what one wants 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.020
 do with the cards you have 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.250
 available but I can not do it until 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.630
 that others do not finish then 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.240
 we are in that tension of come from the 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.829
 black of finishing that I want to do my 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.759
 played to see what my 

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:38.110
 next hand of cards to be able 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.729
 continue and move towards the victory of 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.990
 the game is also a game that 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:42.789
 allows many players in fact 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.110
 allows these seven players and there 

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:46.630
 an expansion that we will talk about that 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.970
 allows us to expand eight players with 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.799
 which is not the problem when we have 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:53.200
 a large group tells us here that it is 

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:54.939
 for 10 years or more 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.890
 more than enough this is very simple 

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:58.990
 to play the rules you will see they learn 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.490
 very very easy and on the other hand it tells us 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.860
 that the departure time is half an hour 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.539
 well this is a bit moot when 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.789
 everyone knows the game and when 

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:08.500
 we are four or five players with all 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:10.660
 the things clear if we can play in 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.940
 half an hour but I think the time of 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.160
 starting extends over all 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.019
 first games where you have to understand 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.730
 well the rules have to know what to do 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:20.260
 and you have to go a little little by little 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.540
 teaching what we do each of 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:25.690
 our turn because it's a game in the 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.370
 It's very easy to play all at once 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.530
 and visualization cheating the 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.880
 we are all older and we are not going to 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:32.799
 cheating we play to win but 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:36.849
 we play by following the rules but it is 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:38.500
 absurd but I do not say it in a plan 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:40.510
 voluntary but we can be confused 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.400
 of something then at the beginning it's more 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.019
 normal to go little by little the one to one 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.900
 watching the turn and so we will do it during 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:48.430
 our recorded game will be a game 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.290
 maybe long slow because we will go 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.819
 demonstrating each one what we're going to 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.690
 do so that you can catch well as 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:56.120
 goes 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:58.310
 and you have only half an hour is a bit 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.769
 relative is not they are not in our 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.970
 our printed as soon as it goes as 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:04.069
 it said in addition this game has three 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.989
 expansions or rather two expansions and 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:09.709
 a mini expansion that we will talk to 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:12.409
 end of it and that is very very visual 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:14.239
 very very nice, it's not that I have a 

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:16.489
 board because I say they are like I say 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:18.500
 they are all letters almost everything and it is that you have 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:20.450
 miniature has appeared to him but 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.129
 they will follow the illustrations very very 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:23.840
 very cool interesting and on the other hand 

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:26.450
 dif and that second is only in 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:28.010
 Castilian but the fatal one is a 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:30.049
 game very independent of the language 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:32.720
 the manual itself we have it in 

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:34.819
 Spanish so we have it translated 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.829
 and it's a good quality manual but the 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:38.900
 letters are curiously not all 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:40.879
 in English they have the name in English 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.349
 it matters a lot because serious of the 

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:44.900
 letters so we will achieve in the next 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:46.519
 video are all with illustrations and 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.560
 only one that has written is the name that 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:50.030
 it can be the temple or the chapel 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.650
 they are buildings normally imposed 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.540
 commercial then even if you lend it 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:55.489
 in English does not affect us since the use of 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.379
 the letter is indicated with a series of 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:58.700
 icons follow the icons at the beginning 

00:03:57.379 --> 00:03:59.870
 they collide a little and we do not understand that there 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:02.030
 to be consulting the manual to 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:03.590
 know what each letter does 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:05.420
 that we take a bit the logic of the game 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:06.350
 we will see that they are very simple 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:07.590
 understand they are the truth they are very 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:09.390
 intuitive 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.700
 Well, nothing else, I do not tell you more about 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:13.830
 moment of seven wonders and let's see 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.239
 what is in store for us during this month and at the end 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:17.430
 of month and you will tell me if it is true or not 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:20.900
 that the game like 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.900
 thanks for your time
