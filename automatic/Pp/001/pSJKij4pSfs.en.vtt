00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
nobody will contest the point that it is

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.850 
nobody will contest the point that it is
with<00:00:48.149> that<00:00:48.300> question<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.899> best<00:00:49.170> way<00:00:49.440> to<00:00:49.469> lose

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.330 
with that question the best way to lose
weight<00:00:49.890> and<00:00:50.520> why<00:00:51.000> is<00:00:51.059> that<00:00:51.270> because

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:52.340 
weight and why is that because

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.350 
weight and why is that because
carbohydrates<00:00:53.340> are<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.579> first<00:00:53.820> fuel<00:00:54.149> the

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
carbohydrates are the first fuel the

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.840 
carbohydrates are the first fuel the
body<00:00:54.390> uses<00:00:55.079> and<00:00:56.039> if<00:00:56.160> it<00:00:56.250> doesn't<00:00:56.430> have<00:00:56.610> access

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
body uses and if it doesn't have access

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.840 
body uses and if it doesn't have access
to<00:00:57.739> carbohydrates<00:00:58.739> it<00:00:59.100> will<00:00:59.280> begin<00:00:59.430> to<00:00:59.609> burn

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
to carbohydrates it will begin to burn

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.450 
to carbohydrates it will begin to burn
fat<00:01:00.329> therefore<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.260> eat<00:01:01.440> foods<00:01:01.829> low<00:01:02.309> in
