00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:03.830 
although fellow summoners were players
today<00:00:02.220> we'll<00:00:02.490> be<00:00:02.639> going<00:00:02.669> over<00:00:03.120> the<00:00:03.480> drunken

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840 
today we'll be going over the drunken

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.639 
today we'll be going over the drunken
masters<00:00:04.370> so<00:00:05.370> these<00:00:05.670> guys<00:00:05.940> are<00:00:06.270> generally

00:00:06.639 --> 00:00:06.649 
masters so these guys are generally

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:09.080 
masters so these guys are generally
single<00:00:07.649> target<00:00:07.980> nucleus<00:00:08.340> and<00:00:08.580> they<00:00:08.940> have

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
single target nucleus and they have

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.890 
single target nucleus and they have
sustained<00:00:09.599> as<00:00:09.780> well<00:00:09.990> so<00:00:10.860> pretty<00:00:11.250> useful<00:00:11.900> the

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
sustained as well so pretty useful the

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.680 
sustained as well so pretty useful the
only<00:00:13.049> downside<00:00:13.500> I<00:00:13.679> would<00:00:13.830> say<00:00:14.009> it's<00:00:14.160> their

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:14.690 
only downside I would say it's their

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:17.450 
only downside I would say it's their
speed<00:00:15.710> they're<00:00:16.710> not<00:00:16.890> the<00:00:16.980> fastest<00:00:17.430> but

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
speed they're not the fastest but

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.000 
speed they're not the fastest but
they're<00:00:17.820> not<00:00:17.910> entirely<00:00:18.330> slow<00:00:18.779> either<00:00:19.020> so<00:00:19.439> you

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
they're not entirely slow either so you

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.349 
they're not entirely slow either so you
know<00:00:20.130> they<00:00:20.310> have<00:00:20.460> there's<00:00:20.880> a<00:00:20.939> trade-off<00:00:21.210> here

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
know they have there's a trade-off here

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.980 
know they have there's a trade-off here
so<00:00:22.289> a<00:00:22.320> fire<00:00:22.560> one<00:00:22.769> let's<00:00:22.949> look<00:00:22.980> at<00:00:23.189> it<00:00:23.279> all

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:23.990 
so a fire one let's look at it all

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.830 
so a fire one let's look at it all
drunken<00:00:24.990> masters<00:00:25.350> okay<00:00:26.310> so<00:00:26.369> they<00:00:26.699> can<00:00:26.939> attack

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
drunken masters okay so they can attack

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.189 
drunken masters okay so they can attack
and<00:00:28.279> reduce<00:00:29.279> somebody's<00:00:29.789> attack<00:00:30.779> power<00:00:30.990> for

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
and reduce somebody's attack power for

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.299 
and reduce somebody's attack power for
one<00:00:31.380> turn<00:00:31.560> with<00:00:32.009> 80<00:00:32.219> percent<00:00:32.430> chances<00:00:32.940> decent

00:00:34.299 --> 00:00:34.309 
one turn with 80 percent chances decent

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:37.880 
one turn with 80 percent chances decent
useful<00:00:35.690> if<00:00:36.690> only<00:00:37.050> was<00:00:37.140> two<00:00:37.380> turns<00:00:37.620> it<00:00:37.739> would<00:00:37.829> be

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
useful if only was two turns it would be

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.000 
useful if only was two turns it would be
better<00:00:38.070> but<00:00:38.370> one<00:00:38.550> turns<00:00:38.760> okay<00:00:39.800> with<00:00:40.800> this<00:00:40.950> -

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
better but one turns okay with this -

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.900 
better but one turns okay with this -
hundred<00:00:41.550> percent<00:00:41.850> then<00:00:42.090> it'll<00:00:42.719> be<00:00:42.809> worth<00:00:42.989> it

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:43.910 
hundred percent then it'll be worth it

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.160 
hundred percent then it'll be worth it
let's<00:00:44.910> look<00:00:45.090> at<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.360> hundred<00:00:45.719> percent<00:00:45.960> when<00:00:46.110> I

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
let's look at the hundred percent when I

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.479 
let's look at the hundred percent when I
say<00:00:46.320> hundred<00:00:46.559> percent<00:00:46.770> talking<00:00:46.980> 100<00:00:47.280> percent

two<00:02:10.649> terms<00:02:11.570> fairly<00:02:12.570> decent<00:02:13.020> he<00:02:13.590> has<00:02:13.710> sustained

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
two terms fairly decent he has sustained

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:20.540 
two terms fairly decent he has sustained
rates<00:02:16.110> play<00:02:16.380> it's<00:02:16.740> okay<00:02:18.050> but<00:02:19.050> you<00:02:19.860> a<00:02:20.190> much

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
rates play it's okay but you a much

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.090 
rates play it's okay but you a much
better<00:02:20.760> go<00:02:21.030> fail<00:02:21.390> blade<00:02:21.720> so<00:02:21.990> that<00:02:22.200> you<00:02:22.890> get<00:02:23.040> a

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
better go fail blade so that you get a

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:24.620 
better go fail blade so that you get a
little<00:02:23.370> bit<00:02:23.459> more<00:02:23.580> attack<00:02:23.820> power<00:02:23.970> so<00:02:24.300> he<00:02:24.420> heals

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
little bit more attack power so he heals

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.660 
little bit more attack power so he heals
for<00:02:24.780> a<00:02:24.810> little<00:02:24.959> bit<00:02:25.050> more<00:02:25.290> so<00:02:25.860> Fredo<00:02:26.100> blade<00:02:26.430> in

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
for a little bit more so Fredo blade in

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.600 
for a little bit more so Fredo blade in
an<00:02:26.910> attack<00:02:27.180> percent<00:02:27.709> quick<00:02:28.709> damage<00:02:28.920> percent

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
an attack percent quick damage percent

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:35.510 
an attack percent quick damage percent
an<00:02:30.270> attack<00:02:30.660> percent<00:02:31.050> onslaught<00:02:31.470> six<00:02:32.180> so<00:02:34.520> you

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
an attack percent onslaught six so you

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.370 
an attack percent onslaught six so you
you<00:02:35.760> want<00:02:35.910> to<00:02:36.090> build<00:02:36.300> him<00:02:36.480> that<00:02:36.870> way<00:02:37.080> so<00:02:37.140> that

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
you want to build him that way so that

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.740 
you want to build him that way so that
he<00:02:37.650> can<00:02:38.070> recover<00:02:38.310> more<00:02:38.670> and<00:02:38.940> still<00:02:39.270> do<00:02:39.420> decent

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
he can recover more and still do decent

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.140 
he can recover more and still do decent
damage

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
damage

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.660 
damage
so<00:02:42.150> I<00:02:42.180> recommend<00:02:42.510> fatal<00:02:43.260> blade<00:02:43.470> more<00:02:44.100> than<00:02:44.310> say

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
so I recommend fatal blade more than say

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:45.729 
so I recommend fatal blade more than say

for<00:02:46.739> this<00:02:47.550> reason<00:02:47.970> but<00:02:48.180> you<00:02:48.269> can<00:02:48.390> go<00:02:48.480> reach

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660

on<00:02:53.250> it<00:02:54.080> so<00:02:55.080> yeah<00:02:55.530> but<00:02:55.890> it's<00:02:56.010> hard<00:02:56.160> to<00:02:56.190> find

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.060 
on it so yeah but it's hard to find
though<00:02:56.640> so<00:02:56.880> that<00:02:57.150> that's<00:02:57.360> the<00:02:57.810> key<00:02:57.989> let's<00:02:58.890> look

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
though so that that's the key let's look

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:00.680 
though so that that's the key let's look
at<00:02:59.190> the<00:02:59.280> win<00:02:59.459> one<00:02:59.670> recently<00:03:00.330> they<00:03:00.540> just

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
at the win one recently they just

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.130 
at the win one recently they just
released<00:03:01.500> the<00:03:02.330> secret<00:03:03.330> dungeon<00:03:03.660> for<00:03:03.930> the<00:03:03.989> win

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
released the secret dungeon for the win

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.050 
released the secret dungeon for the win
one<00:03:04.320> so<00:03:04.560> I<00:03:04.590> guess<00:03:04.950> a<00:03:04.980> lot<00:03:05.190> of<00:03:05.250> people<00:03:05.340> happen<00:03:05.730> I

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
one so I guess a lot of people happen I

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.390 
one so I guess a lot of people happen I
can't<00:03:06.630> find<00:03:06.840> him<00:03:07.050> actually<00:03:07.560> didn't<00:03:07.950> get<00:03:08.070> him<00:03:08.250> I

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
can't find him actually didn't get him I

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.970 
can't find him actually didn't get him I
think<00:03:09.120> I<00:03:09.180> got<00:03:09.390> it<00:03:09.510> but<00:03:09.540> I<00:03:09.750> fed<00:03:10.320> him<00:03:10.440> to<00:03:10.620> somebody

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
think I got it but I fed him to somebody

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.110 
think I got it but I fed him to somebody
else<00:03:13.610> okay<00:03:14.610> there<00:03:14.850> you<00:03:14.880> go

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
else okay there you go

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:19.729 
else okay there you go

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
wand so very similar to the water one he

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:22.670

the<00:03:35.160> defence<00:03:35.489> is<00:03:35.610> increased<00:03:35.730> for<00:03:36.120> two<00:03:36.239> turns

when it's maxed out it's a hundred
percent<00:03:39.209> chance<00:03:39.450> so<00:03:39.930> he<00:03:39.959> has<00:03:40.140> a<00:03:40.170> debuff<00:03:40.790> but

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
percent chance so he has a debuff but

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:43.670 
percent chance so he has a debuff but
his<00:03:41.880> diva<00:03:42.209> is<00:03:42.390> you<00:03:42.840> know<00:03:42.959> a<00:03:42.989> high<00:03:43.260> cooldown<00:03:43.650> so

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
his diva is you know a high cooldown so

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.560 
his diva is you know a high cooldown so
it's<00:03:44.010> not<00:03:44.130> as<00:03:44.250> effective<00:03:44.700> as<00:03:45.000> you<00:03:45.060> want<00:03:45.360> it<00:03:45.450> to

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:45.570 
it's not as effective as you want it to

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:47.039 
it's not as effective as you want it to
be

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:47.049 
be

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:48.780 
be
for<00:03:47.500> him<00:03:47.650> though<00:03:47.890> I<00:03:48.129> will<00:03:48.250> also<00:03:48.489> go<00:03:48.610> further

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
for him though I will also go further

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.640 
for him though I will also go further
blade<00:03:49.090> so<00:03:49.510> you<00:03:49.540> can't<00:03:50.019> have<00:03:50.230> a<00:03:50.260> little<00:03:50.439> bit

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
blade so you can't have a little bit

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.479 
blade so you can't have a little bit
more<00:03:51.040> recovery<00:03:52.739> cuz<00:03:53.739> it<00:03:53.860> skills<00:03:54.099> up<00:03:54.250> attack

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:54.489 
more recovery cuz it skills up attack

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:56.309 
more recovery cuz it skills up attack
power<00:03:54.700> so<00:03:55.060> you'll<00:03:55.239> want<00:03:55.510> fatal<00:03:55.870> blade<00:03:56.049> and

00:03:56.309 --> 00:03:56.319 
power so you'll want fatal blade and

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:58.319 
power so you'll want fatal blade and
then<00:03:56.439> I<00:03:56.680> saw<00:03:56.920> two<00:03:56.950> four<00:03:57.310> six<00:03:57.459> eight<00:03:57.700> percent

00:03:58.319 --> 00:03:58.329 
then I saw two four six eight percent

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
it

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:08.910 
it
you<00:04:07.840> can't<00:04:08.019> go<00:04:08.110> quicker<00:04:08.379> eight<00:04:08.500> percent<00:04:08.829> if

wouldn't<00:04:49.690> mind<00:04:49.750> sacrificing<00:04:50.050> the<00:04:51.599> heal<00:04:52.599> for

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:53.020 
wouldn't mind sacrificing the heal for

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.770 
wouldn't mind sacrificing the heal for
more<00:04:53.380> dab<00:04:53.620> more<00:04:54.010> raw<00:04:54.190> power<00:04:54.460> so<00:04:55.270> rich<00:04:55.449> blade

more dab more raw power so rich blade
and<00:04:56.139> then<00:04:56.500> you<00:04:57.280> go<00:04:57.430> tech<00:04:57.639> purse<00:04:57.789> and<00:04:57.970> quick

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:58.180 
and then you go tech purse and quick

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:00.710 
and then you go tech purse and quick
damage<00:04:58.330> percent<00:04:58.780> attack<00:04:58.990> percent<00:04:59.349> so<00:04:59.530> all<00:04:59.830> the

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720 
damage percent attack percent so all the

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.140 
damage percent attack percent so all the
darker<00:05:01.720> masters<00:05:02.080> are<00:05:02.199> built<00:05:02.440> in<00:05:02.530> the<00:05:02.620> same<00:05:02.830> way

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:03.150 
darker masters are built in the same way

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:05.820 
darker masters are built in the same way
but<00:05:04.150> like<00:05:04.330> I<00:05:04.419> said<00:05:04.630> it<00:05:04.780> the<00:05:05.169> runes<00:05:05.410> are<00:05:05.710> the

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:05.830 
but like I said it the runes are the

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:08.520 
but like I said it the runes are the
ones<00:05:06.010> they're<00:05:06.220> hard<00:05:06.430> to<00:05:06.550> find<00:05:06.789> though<00:05:07.530> let's

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:08.530 
ones they're hard to find though let's

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:16.560 
ones they're hard to find though let's
look<00:05:08.710> at<00:05:08.830> the<00:05:10.139> dark<00:05:11.139> version<00:05:15.570> approaches

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:16.570 
look at the dark version approaches

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:19.140 
look at the dark version approaches
Tammy<00:05:16.840> like<00:05:17.020> a<00:05:17.050> drunkard<00:05:17.560> okay<00:05:18.130> and<00:05:18.520> pro<00:05:18.729> so

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:19.150 
Tammy like a drunkard okay and pro so

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:22.020 
Tammy like a drunkard okay and pro so
same<00:05:19.389> skill<00:05:20.010> kicks<00:05:21.010> enemy<00:05:21.280> unsteadily<00:05:21.699> and

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:22.030 
same skill kicks enemy unsteadily and

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:23.760 
same skill kicks enemy unsteadily and
gets<00:05:22.180> an<00:05:22.300> odd<00:05:22.419> turn<00:05:22.599> into<00:05:22.810> enemy<00:05:23.050> dies<00:05:23.260> not<00:05:23.650> the

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:23.770 
gets an odd turn into enemy dies not the

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:26.370 
gets an odd turn into enemy dies not the
best<00:05:23.949> skill<00:05:24.630> check<00:05:25.630> there<00:05:25.810> me<00:05:25.960> with<00:05:26.139> sharp

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:26.380 
best skill check there me with sharp

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:27.990 
best skill check there me with sharp
blow<00:05:26.620> and<00:05:26.830> Chris<00:05:27.070> a<00:05:27.099> Krueger<00:05:27.430> here<00:05:27.610> rid

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:28.000 
blow and Chris a Krueger here rid

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.750 
blow and Chris a Krueger here rid
critical<00:05:28.870> rate<00:05:29.110> for<00:05:29.380> 3<00:05:29.530> turns<00:05:29.680> I<00:05:30.039> don't<00:05:30.610> like

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:30.760 
critical rate for 3 turns I don't like

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:32.969 
critical rate for 3 turns I don't like
the<00:05:30.880> combo<00:05:31.270> because<00:05:31.960> first<00:05:32.470> of<00:05:32.560> all<00:05:32.680> you<00:05:32.889> do

00:05:32.969 --> 00:05:32.979 
the combo because first of all you do

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:34.290 
the combo because first of all you do
ready<00:05:33.190> to<00:05:33.280> plate<00:05:33.460> or<00:05:33.669> you<00:05:33.729> do<00:05:33.820> fatal<00:05:34.120> blade

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:34.300 
ready to plate or you do fatal blade

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.210 
ready to plate or you do fatal blade
you're<00:05:35.139> most<00:05:35.440> likely<00:05:35.620> gonna<00:05:35.800> get<00:05:35.979> hundred

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:36.220 
you're most likely gonna get hundred

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:41.939 
you're most likely gonna get hundred
percent<00:05:36.430> quickly<00:05:36.699> so<00:05:38.460> adding<00:05:39.460> this<00:05:39.610> means<00:05:40.949> you

00:05:41.939 --> 00:05:41.949 
percent quickly so adding this means you

00:05:41.949 --> 00:05:44.450 
percent quickly so adding this means you
have<00:05:41.979> to<00:05:42.099> use<00:05:42.220> this<00:05:42.490> on<00:05:42.669> your<00:05:43.000> first<00:05:43.210> turn<00:05:43.840> and

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:44.460 
have to use this on your first turn and

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:47.339 
have to use this on your first turn and
then<00:05:45.460> you're<00:05:45.880> gonna<00:05:46.000> get<00:05:46.210> the<00:05:46.539> critical<00:05:47.110> rate

00:05:47.339 --> 00:05:47.349 
then you're gonna get the critical rate

00:05:47.349 --> 00:05:50.670 
then you're gonna get the critical rate
for<00:05:47.530> three<00:05:47.680> turn<00:05:47.830> three<00:05:48.490> turns<00:05:49.139> Rach<00:05:50.139> play<00:05:50.409> is

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:50.680 
for three turn three turns Rach play is

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:53.820 
for three turn three turns Rach play is
obviously<00:05:51.070> the<00:05:51.220> most<00:05:51.340> optimal<00:05:51.820> choice<00:05:52.120> and<00:05:53.020> if

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:53.830 
obviously the most optimal choice and if

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:55.350 
obviously the most optimal choice and if
you<00:05:53.919> do<00:05:54.039> use<00:05:54.190> the<00:05:54.310> third<00:05:54.490> skill<00:05:54.789> on<00:05:54.969> the<00:05:55.000> first

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:55.360 
you do use the third skill on the first

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:59.399 
you do use the third skill on the first
round<00:05:55.889> then<00:05:56.940> you<00:05:57.940> only<00:05:58.150> need<00:05:58.300> 70<00:05:58.870> percentage

00:05:59.399 --> 00:05:59.409 
round then you only need 70 percentage

00:05:59.409 --> 00:06:00.060 
round then you only need 70 percentage
or

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:00.070 
or

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:03.150

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:03.160 
75% quit rate but like I said rich play

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:05.480 
75% quit rate but like I said rich play
it's<00:06:03.280> really<00:06:03.430> good<00:06:03.910> on<00:06:04.030> him<00:06:04.270> and<00:06:04.480> then<00:06:05.020> I

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:05.490 
it's really good on him and then I

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:08.250 
it's really good on him and then I
