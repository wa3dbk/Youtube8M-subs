00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.970
 that was already downloaded by the liquid week 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.100
 downloaded ok we go to the 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:53.979
 beginning since we are going to spend nothing 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.360
 more we put you see the license has been 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:57.880
 updated in the service has been 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.430
 transferred to licenses we put you 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.710
 again, that is, the licenses are already 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:05.049
 and we had what we wanted to think 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:07.590
 they are every five months every four I do not know 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:10.179
 when they are put back every three I think 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.620
 since we are there we are closing the 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:14.920
 session of the kind that happened to us 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.819
 licenses we open ours 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.440
 okay 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:22.400
 we open ours 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.959
 the second one is back 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.659
 and since we got to live all the 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:28.519
 since we can already check that 

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:30.170
 they passed us the same thing, I do not, I'm not going 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:32.150
 to open I'm not going to put the game and the 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.370
 software 3 to see it but then 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.880
 for those who did not know I hope that 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:39.190
 they have served the video 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.070
 it's very easy because many do not 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:44.480
 they knew they had told him how to spend 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:47.840
 I have already been asked 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:51.740
 since I can tell you more, I hope that 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:54.650
 has served and then 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:58.280
 we almost reached 600 I hope that 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:01.220
 we get to 600 a live video and 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:04.810
