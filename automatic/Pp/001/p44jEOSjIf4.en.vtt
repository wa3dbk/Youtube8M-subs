engineer 775 here with just another
little<00:00:08.960> tip<00:00:10.000> using<00:00:11.000> the<00:00:11.210> sawzall<00:00:11.690> I've<00:00:11.930> had<00:00:12.110> it

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:12.230 
little tip using the sawzall I've had it

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:14.230 
little tip using the sawzall I've had it
for<00:00:12.410> many<00:00:12.500> years<00:00:12.650> it's<00:00:13.340> pretty<00:00:13.790> rough-looking

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:14.240 
for many years it's pretty rough-looking

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.060 
for many years it's pretty rough-looking
because<00:00:14.720> I<00:00:14.840> use<00:00:15.050> it<00:00:15.170> in<00:00:15.260> the<00:00:15.349> dirt<00:00:15.530> a<00:00:15.740> lot<00:00:15.920> to

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:16.070 
because I use it in the dirt a lot to

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.660 
because I use it in the dirt a lot to
cut<00:00:16.250> roots<00:00:16.550> and<00:00:17.590> so<00:00:18.590> you<00:00:18.680> put<00:00:18.860> water<00:00:19.040> lines<00:00:19.340> in

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:19.670 
cut roots and so you put water lines in

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:21.550 
cut roots and so you put water lines in
and<00:00:20.000> I'm<00:00:20.090> going<00:00:20.300> through<00:00:20.480> the<00:00:20.570> woods<00:00:20.750> which

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:21.560 
and I'm going through the woods which

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:22.750 
and I'm going through the woods which
made<00:00:21.770> me<00:00:21.860> think<00:00:22.070> about<00:00:22.100> doing<00:00:22.369> this<00:00:22.520> little

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:22.760 
made me think about doing this little

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.840 
made me think about doing this little
video<00:00:22.910> to<00:00:23.570> share<00:00:23.750> with<00:00:23.930> you<00:00:24.140> another

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:24.850 
video to share with you another

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:28.060 
video to share with you another
sustainable<00:00:25.850> way<00:00:26.029> to<00:00:26.750> cut<00:00:26.930> some<00:00:27.109> wood<00:00:27.260> now<00:00:27.770> I

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:28.070 
sustainable way to cut some wood now I

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:30.040 
sustainable way to cut some wood now I
always<00:00:28.699> recommend<00:00:28.970> having<00:00:29.300> some<00:00:29.539> hand<00:00:29.779> saws

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.050 
always recommend having some hand saws

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:31.720 
always recommend having some hand saws
obviously<00:00:30.890> because<00:00:31.010> some<00:00:31.189> of<00:00:31.220> them<00:00:31.400> are<00:00:31.519> very

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:31.730 
obviously because some of them are very

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:33.939 
obviously because some of them are very
efficient<00:00:32.419> it's<00:00:33.110> also<00:00:33.230> nice<00:00:33.470> to<00:00:33.530> have<00:00:33.800> some

00:00:33.939 --> 00:00:33.949 
efficient it's also nice to have some

00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:36.329 
efficient it's also nice to have some
battery-operated<00:00:34.340> tools<00:00:35.120> like<00:00:35.930> a<00:00:35.960> sawzall

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:36.339 
battery-operated tools like a sawzall

drills you name it skillsawz back you
know<00:00:39.979> there's<00:00:40.339> a<00:00:40.400> loose<00:00:40.729> a<00:00:40.820> ton<00:00:41.000> of<00:00:41.500> tools<00:00:42.500> that

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:42.890 
know there's a loose a ton of tools that

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:44.649 
know there's a loose a ton of tools that
are<00:00:43.129> interchangeable<00:00:43.820> with<00:00:44.239> these<00:00:44.390> type<00:00:44.629> of

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:44.659 
are interchangeable with these type of

00:00:44.659 --> 00:00:47.740 
are interchangeable with these type of
battery<00:00:44.989> systems<00:00:45.760> flashlights<00:00:46.760> even<00:00:47.120> and<00:00:47.299> so

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:47.750 
battery systems flashlights even and so

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.170 
battery systems flashlights even and so
charging<00:00:48.440> the<00:00:48.530> batteries<00:00:48.949> with<00:00:49.460> a<00:00:49.489> solar<00:00:49.820> for

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:50.180 
charging the batteries with a solar for

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.719 
charging the batteries with a solar for
our<00:00:50.330> solar<00:00:50.720> generator<00:00:51.199> and<00:00:51.440> so<00:00:52.220> just<00:00:52.489> cutting

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:52.729 
our solar generator and so just cutting

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:59.800 
our solar generator and so just cutting
some<00:00:52.879> wood

00:00:59.800 --> 00:00:59.810 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:01.900

sustainable<00:02:32.610> so<00:02:32.880> from<00:02:33.150> basically<00:02:33.630> cutting

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
sustainable so from basically cutting

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:41.470 
sustainable so from basically cutting
wood<00:02:35.040> with<00:02:35.250> the<00:02:35.340> power<00:02:35.520> of<00:02:35.730> the<00:02:35.760> Sun

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.699 

okay<00:02:42.480> so<00:02:42.540> with<00:02:42.750> the<00:02:42.840> Sol's<00:02:43.080> off<00:02:43.349> when<00:02:43.620> an

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
okay so with the Sol's off when an

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:45.770 
okay so with the Sol's off when an
aggressive<00:02:44.129> would<00:02:44.310> blade<00:02:44.580> and<00:02:45.120> the<00:02:45.150> ability

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
aggressive would blade and the ability

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.979 
aggressive would blade and the ability
to<00:02:45.840> charge<00:02:46.110> batteries<00:02:46.940> using<00:02:47.940> solar<00:02:48.870> energy

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
to charge batteries using solar energy

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:51.380 
to charge batteries using solar energy
i'm<00:02:49.410> using<00:02:49.800> it<00:02:50.310> off<00:02:50.459> of<00:02:50.640> the<00:02:50.730> Sun<00:02:50.910> runner<00:02:51.120> right

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
i'm using it off of the Sun runner right

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.509 
i'm using it off of the Sun runner right
now<00:02:51.540> but<00:02:51.780> you<00:02:51.900> could<00:02:51.989> do<00:02:52.140> it<00:02:52.170> off<00:02:52.769> a<00:02:53.040> variety<00:02:53.489> of

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
now but you could do it off a variety of

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:55.490 
now but you could do it off a variety of
things<00:02:53.790> you<00:02:54.269> can<00:02:54.390> make<00:02:54.569> your<00:02:54.690> own<00:02:54.750> solar

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
things you can make your own solar

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.960 
things you can make your own solar
battery<00:02:56.010> charger<00:02:56.430> and<00:02:57.920> keep<00:02:58.920> this<00:02:59.069> going<00:02:59.790> have

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
battery charger and keep this going have

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.030 
battery charger and keep this going have
a<00:03:00.030> couple<00:03:00.330> batteries<00:03:00.480> a<00:03:00.900> couple<00:03:01.620> good<00:03:01.739> blades

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
a couple batteries a couple good blades

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.610 
a couple batteries a couple good blades
like<00:03:02.580> I<00:03:02.700> said<00:03:02.760> some<00:03:03.090> of<00:03:03.180> these<00:03:03.470> sawzalls<00:03:04.470> are

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
like I said some of these sawzalls are

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.130 
like I said some of these sawzalls are
just<00:03:04.800> tough<00:03:05.099> i've<00:03:05.280> had<00:03:05.430> it<00:03:05.580> for<00:03:05.610> a<00:03:05.730> long<00:03:05.790> time

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
just tough i've had it for a long time

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.559 
just tough i've had it for a long time
got<00:03:07.140> a<00:03:07.170> lot<00:03:07.260> of<00:03:07.319> roots<00:03:07.590> and<00:03:08.180> just<00:03:09.180> use<00:03:09.330> it<00:03:09.480> in

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 
got a lot of roots and just use it in

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:12.740 
got a lot of roots and just use it in
the<00:03:09.660> dirt<00:03:09.840> all<00:03:10.140> the<00:03:10.290> time<00:03:11.390> and<00:03:12.390> when<00:03:12.599> you're

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
the dirt all the time and when you're

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.330 
the dirt all the time and when you're
inching<00:03:13.319> through<00:03:13.560> the<00:03:13.709> woods<00:03:13.890> to<00:03:14.040> put<00:03:14.220> water

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
inching through the woods to put water

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.120 
inching through the woods to put water
system<00:03:14.849> is<00:03:14.970> water<00:03:15.540> systems<00:03:15.959> then<00:03:16.200> this<00:03:16.950> is<00:03:17.099> a

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
system is water systems then this is a

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.630 
system is water systems then this is a
great<00:03:17.459> tool<00:03:18.410> so<00:03:19.410> okay<00:03:19.950> just<00:03:20.220> charging

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
great tool so okay just charging

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:31.129 
great tool so okay just charging
batteries<00:03:21.030> so<00:03:21.630> we<00:03:21.720> can<00:03:21.840> cut<00:03:22.019> wood

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:31.139 

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:33.720 

ok<00:03:32.139> so<00:03:32.200> the<00:03:32.439> crank<00:03:32.650> away<00:03:32.799> you<00:03:33.099> can<00:03:33.249> also<00:03:33.400> charge

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
ok so the crank away you can also charge

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:39.119 
ok so the crank away you can also charge
batteries<00:03:34.709> and<00:03:35.709> I'm<00:03:36.040> the<00:03:37.409> charger<00:03:38.409> is<00:03:38.620> using

00:03:39.119 --> 00:03:39.129 
batteries and I'm the charger is using

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:43.540 
batteries and I'm the charger is using
about<00:03:39.280> 80<00:03:39.489> watts

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:43.550 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:45.400 

I'm<00:03:43.880> putting<00:03:44.270> about<00:03:44.390> 80<00:03:44.720> watts<00:03:44.960> into<00:03:45.230> the

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.410 
I'm putting about 80 watts into the

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:47.470 
I'm putting about 80 watts into the
system<00:03:45.830> now<00:03:45.980> so<00:03:46.220> we're<00:03:46.310> pretty<00:03:46.520> much<00:03:46.700> even<00:03:46.760> not

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
system now so we're pretty much even not

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.090 
system now so we're pretty much even not
pulling<00:03:47.810> a<00:03:47.900> load<00:03:48.050> out<00:03:48.200> of<00:03:48.380> battery<00:03:48.740> but

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:49.100 
pulling a load out of battery but

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:54.190 
pulling a load out of battery but
obviously<00:03:49.460> burning<00:03:49.670> off<00:03:49.910> the<00:03:49.940> battery<00:03:50.360> and<00:03:53.200> so

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:54.200 
obviously burning off the battery and so

00:03:54.200 --> 00:04:01.840 
obviously burning off the battery and so
we're<00:03:54.350> charging<00:04:00.100> and<00:04:01.100> at<00:04:01.220> the<00:04:01.310> same<00:04:01.430> time<00:04:01.490> you

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:01.850 
we're charging and at the same time you

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:13.800 
we're charging and at the same time you
can<00:04:01.970> have<00:04:02.090> a<00:04:02.120> solar<00:04:02.390> panel<00:04:02.660> helping<00:04:03.380> you<00:04:03.470> out

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:15.880 

I<00:04:14.810> like<00:04:15.080> having<00:04:15.319> these<00:04:15.379> little<00:04:15.620> portable

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:15.890 
I like having these little portable

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:19.060 
I like having these little portable
panels<00:04:16.449> not<00:04:17.449> fixed<00:04:17.840> any<00:04:17.989> things<00:04:18.260> come<00:04:18.560> on<00:04:18.620> take

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.070 
panels not fixed any things come on take

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:22.450 
panels not fixed any things come on take
advantage<00:04:19.489> of<00:04:19.609> more<00:04:19.790> Sun<00:04:20.530> put<00:04:21.530> it<00:04:21.650> directly<00:04:22.130> in

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:22.460 
advantage of more Sun put it directly in

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:33.460 
advantage of more Sun put it directly in
the<00:04:22.610> sun<00:04:26.530> get<00:04:27.530> some<00:04:27.710> power<00:04:29.380> what<00:04:30.380> does<00:04:32.470> every

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:33.470 
the sun get some power what does every

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:37.490 
the sun get some power what does every
little<00:04:33.680> bit<00:04:33.770> helps

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:43.010 

so<00:04:38.070> that's<00:04:38.280> pumping<00:04:38.760> that<00:04:38.910> in<00:04:39.120> there<00:04:42.020> well

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.020 
so that's pumping that in there well

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:44.750 
so that's pumping that in there well
that's<00:04:43.200> only<00:04:43.350> a<00:04:43.470> 20<00:04:43.770> watt<00:04:43.860> panel<00:04:44.370> I'm<00:04:44.460> pulling

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:44.760 
that's only a 20 watt panel I'm pulling

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.150 
that's only a 20 watt panel I'm pulling
AV<00:04:44.940> wats<00:04:45.210> out<00:04:45.480> so<00:04:46.230> now<00:04:46.380> it<00:04:46.530> only<00:04:46.650> have<00:04:46.890> to<00:04:47.010> make

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:47.160 
AV wats out so now it only have to make

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:54.170 
AV wats out so now it only have to make
this<00:04:47.910> right<00:04:48.980> here<00:04:51.470> which<00:04:52.470> is<00:04:52.620> real<00:04:52.770> easy<00:04:53.180> so

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.180 
this right here which is real easy so

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:57.350 
this right here which is real easy so
now<00:04:54.330> i<00:04:54.360> can<00:04:54.450> make<00:04:54.720> it<00:04:54.750> sustainable

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:57.360 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.510 

okay<00:04:58.080> so

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:01.520 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.129 

again<00:05:02.520> the<00:05:02.760> amount<00:05:02.910> of<00:05:02.970> energy<00:05:03.060> that<00:05:03.330> I<00:05:03.870> can

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:04.139 
again the amount of energy that I can

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:07.640 
again the amount of energy that I can
use<00:05:04.350> to<00:05:05.600> keep<00:05:06.600> that<00:05:06.750> Harry<00:05:07.020> chart<00:05:07.350> I<00:05:07.500> could

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:07.650 
use to keep that Harry chart I could

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:09.409 
use to keep that Harry chart I could
just<00:05:07.860> go<00:05:08.010> out<00:05:08.160> with<00:05:08.280> my<00:05:08.400> hands<00:05:08.730> on<00:05:08.910> cut<00:05:09.180> wood<00:05:09.389> I

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:09.419 
just go out with my hands on cut wood I

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:11.150 
just go out with my hands on cut wood I
understand<00:05:09.960> it<00:05:10.169> was<00:05:10.199> just<00:05:10.410> an<00:05:10.530> example<00:05:10.620> where

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:11.160 
understand it was just an example where

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.520 
understand it was just an example where
I<00:05:11.280> can<00:05:11.639> charge<00:05:12.449> batteries<00:05:12.930> with<00:05:13.139> this<00:05:13.290> crank

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:13.530 
I can charge batteries with this crank

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:19.280 
I can charge batteries with this crank
go<00:05:13.650> on<00:05:14.660> so<00:05:15.660> picture<00:05:15.960> this<00:05:16.080> being<00:05:17.150> a<00:05:18.290> battery

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:19.290 
go on so picture this being a battery

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:21.770 
go on so picture this being a battery
for<00:05:19.410> flashlights<00:05:19.979> or<00:05:20.760> any<00:05:21.030> other<00:05:21.240> device<00:05:21.389> that

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:21.780 
for flashlights or any other device that

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:27.110 
for flashlights or any other device that
you<00:05:21.900> need<00:05:22.050> to<00:05:22.199> run<00:05:25.460> again<00:05:26.460> some<00:05:26.699> of<00:05:26.729> you<00:05:27.000> know

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:27.120 
you need to run again some of you know

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.330 
you need to run again some of you know
the<00:05:27.240> harder<00:05:27.510> the<00:05:28.290> dryer<00:05:28.530> the<00:05:28.710> wood<00:05:28.860> the<00:05:29.040> harder

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:29.340 
the harder the dryer the wood the harder

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:32.150 
the harder the dryer the wood the harder
it<00:05:29.490> is<00:05:29.520> so<00:05:30.030> that's<00:05:30.930> a<00:05:31.080> that's<00:05:31.560> a<00:05:31.710> lot<00:05:31.830> of<00:05:31.860> fuel

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:32.160 
it is so that's a that's a lot of fuel

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.090 
it is so that's a that's a lot of fuel
right<00:05:32.280> there<00:05:32.550> I<00:05:32.780> wanted<00:05:33.780> to<00:05:33.840> take<00:05:34.020> me<00:05:34.169> to<00:05:34.290> cut

right there I wanted to take me to cut

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:37.370 
right there I wanted to take me to cut
that<00:05:35.310> a<00:05:35.580> couple<00:05:35.910> minutes<00:05:36.060> and<00:05:36.510> that's<00:05:36.960> plenty

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:37.380 
that a couple minutes and that's plenty

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:40.580 
that a couple minutes and that's plenty
to<00:05:37.620> cook<00:05:37.800> our<00:05:37.919> meal<00:05:38.570> or<00:05:39.570> just<00:05:39.630> to<00:05:40.260> get<00:05:40.380> a<00:05:40.410> lot<00:05:40.560> of

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:40.590 
to cook our meal or just to get a lot of

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:42.560 
to cook our meal or just to get a lot of
heat<00:05:40.800> out<00:05:40.950> of<00:05:41.100> it<00:05:41.220> so<00:05:41.610> and<00:05:41.970> the<00:05:42.060> battery<00:05:42.389> still

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:42.570 
heat out of it so and the battery still

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:58.330 
heat out of it so and the battery still
going

00:05:58.330 --> 00:05:58.340 

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:00.410 

obviously<00:05:59.340> if<00:05:59.430> you<00:05:59.550> set<00:05:59.790> up<00:05:59.910> some<00:06:00.090> saw<00:06:00.270> horses

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:00.420 
obviously if you set up some saw horses

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:02.840 
obviously if you set up some saw horses
and<00:06:01.050> have<00:06:01.800> somebody<00:06:02.040> feeding<00:06:02.490> you<00:06:02.580> the<00:06:02.700> wood

and have somebody feeding you the wood

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:05.810 
and have somebody feeding you the wood
