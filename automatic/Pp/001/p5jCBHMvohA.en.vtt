00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:45.080 
exhaust the way it is but I decided to

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.330 
exhaust the way it is but I decided to
because<00:01:46.630> that's<00:01:47.630> the<00:01:47.780> way<00:01:47.900> the<00:01:48.050> factory<00:01:48.530> made

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340

years<00:01:53.180> down<00:01:53.390> the<00:01:53.570> line<00:01:53.750> like<00:01:54.250> my<00:01:55.250> bike<00:01:55.430> stood

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
years down the line like my bike stood

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.960 
years down the line like my bike stood
feel<00:01:55.940> just<00:01:56.330> like<00:01:56.420> they<00:01:56.960> left<00:01:57.200> the<00:01:57.320> factory

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:57.970 
feel just like they left the factory

00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:59.860

so<00:01:58.970> that<00:01:59.150> I<00:01:59.240> won't<00:01:59.420> lose<00:01:59.540> any<00:01:59.720> of<00:01:59.780> the

00:01:59.860 --> 00:01:59.870 
so that I won't lose any of the

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:22.110 
so that I won't lose any of the
character

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:38.210 

all<00:02:22.629> right

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.200 

all<00:02:38.490> right<00:02:38.730> so<00:02:38.970> it's<00:02:39.090> not<00:02:39.210> the<00:02:39.420> loudest<00:02:39.780> bike

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:41.210 
all right so it's not the loudest bike

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:43.350 
all right so it's not the loudest bike
but

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
but

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.630 
but
keeps<00:02:43.960> the<00:02:44.110> neighbors<00:02:44.260> happy<00:02:45.630> and<00:02:46.630> I<00:02:46.750> think

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
keeps the neighbors happy and I think

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.840 
keeps the neighbors happy and I think
that<00:02:48.640> exhaust<00:02:48.970> system<00:02:49.300> is<00:02:49.390> just<00:02:49.600> fine<00:02:50.850> alright

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
that exhaust system is just fine alright

00:02:51.850 --> 00:03:01.460 
that exhaust system is just fine alright
let's<00:02:52.030> stop<00:02:52.210> wasting<00:02:52.330> gas

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.530
