shoot<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:30.270> I<00:01:30.810> didn't<00:01:31.200> reset<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.530> clock

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
shoot and I didn't reset the clock

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.830 
shoot and I didn't reset the clock
because<00:01:32.220> it's<00:01:32.579> really<00:01:32.880> a<00:01:33.060> pain<00:01:33.329> to<00:01:33.509> reset

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
because it's really a pain to reset

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.289 
because it's really a pain to reset
which<00:01:34.020> is<00:01:34.170> definitely<00:01:34.979> one<00:01:35.100> of<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.250> cons<00:01:35.460> to

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
which is definitely one of the cons to

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.810 
which is definitely one of the cons to
this<00:01:36.329> dock<00:01:36.780> now<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:37.890> speakers<00:01:38.369> are<00:01:38.520> great<00:01:38.670> the

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
this dock now the speakers are great the

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.969 
this dock now the speakers are great the
sound<00:01:39.060> quality<00:01:39.180> is<00:01:39.450> great<00:01:39.630> it<00:01:40.409> is<00:01:40.470> a<00:01:40.710> little

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
sound quality is great it is a little

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.819 
sound quality is great it is a little
bit<00:01:41.159> thick<00:01:41.549> as<00:01:41.850> you<00:01:42.060> can<00:01:42.210> see<00:01:42.530> she's<00:01:43.530> a<00:01:43.560> bit<00:01:43.740> of

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
bit thick as you can see she's a bit of

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.560 
bit thick as you can see she's a bit of
a<00:01:43.890> down<00:01:44.040> side<00:01:44.280> and<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.909> other<00:01:45.060> downside<00:01:45.540> that

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
a down side and the other downside that

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.840 
a down side and the other downside that
I<00:01:45.689> found<00:01:46.079> is<00:01:46.290> that<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.560> buttons<00:01:46.950> if<00:01:47.340> you<00:01:47.640> hear

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
I found is that the buttons if you hear

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.429 
I found is that the buttons if you hear
this<00:01:50.270> you<00:01:51.270> can<00:01:51.390> hear<00:01:51.509> that<00:01:51.570> right<00:01:51.869> it's<00:01:52.049> so

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
this you can hear that right it's so

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.560 
this you can hear that right it's so
loud<00:01:52.740> it's<00:01:53.070> like<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.670> loudest<00:01:54.030> buttons<00:01:54.390> I

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
loud it's like the loudest buttons I

another<00:02:02.969> problem<00:02:03.299> i<00:02:03.390> did<00:02:03.659> find<00:02:03.930> though<00:02:04.229> um<00:02:04.530> is

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
another problem i did find though um is

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.320 
another problem i did find though um is
that<00:02:05.490> you<00:02:05.880> are<00:02:06.590> you<00:02:07.590> cannot<00:02:08.069> see<00:02:08.310> the<00:02:08.819> volume

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
that you are you cannot see the volume

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.450 
that you are you cannot see the volume
settings<00:02:09.750> or<00:02:09.959> the

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:10.460 
settings or the

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:14.230 
settings or the
the<00:02:11.150> equalizer<00:02:11.660> settings<00:02:11.960> or<00:02:12.820> like<00:02:13.820> what<00:02:14.030> song

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:14.240 
the equalizer settings or like what song

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.120 
the equalizer settings or like what song
is<00:02:14.480> playing<00:02:14.510> on<00:02:14.930> the<00:02:15.050> clock<00:02:15.260> here<00:02:15.290> which<00:02:16.010> I

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
is playing on the clock here which I

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.580 
is playing on the clock here which I
think<00:02:16.310> would<00:02:16.460> have<00:02:16.580> been<00:02:16.670> a<00:02:16.700> cool<00:02:16.970> thing<00:02:17.590> that

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
think would have been a cool thing that

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.140 
think would have been a cool thing that
you<00:02:18.920> could<00:02:19.040> at<00:02:19.160> least<00:02:19.220> have<00:02:19.430> the<00:02:19.580> volume<00:02:19.820> on

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
you could at least have the volume on

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.180 
you could at least have the volume on
there<00:02:20.410> but<00:02:21.410> if<00:02:21.560> you<00:02:21.680> could<00:02:21.800> have<00:02:21.920> like<00:02:22.070> the

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
there but if you could have like the

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:23.680 
there but if you could have like the
scrolling<00:02:22.640> song<00:02:22.880> title<00:02:23.240> when<00:02:23.360> you're<00:02:23.510> playing

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
scrolling song title when you're playing

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.480 
scrolling song title when you're playing
a<00:02:23.780> song<00:02:23.960> I<00:02:24.140> think<00:02:24.350> that'd<00:02:24.440> be<00:02:24.560> pretty<00:02:24.680> cool<00:02:24.800> but

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:25.490 
a song I think that'd be pretty cool but

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:27.190 
a song I think that'd be pretty cool but
I<00:02:25.550> mean<00:02:25.640> it<00:02:25.880> is<00:02:25.970> a<00:02:26.000> nice<00:02:26.240> feature<00:02:26.750> to<00:02:26.900> have<00:02:26.990> the

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
I mean it is a nice feature to have the

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.630 
I mean it is a nice feature to have the
clock<00:02:27.410> there<00:02:27.680> and<00:02:27.920> it's<00:02:28.250> got<00:02:28.370> some<00:02:28.520> little

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
clock there and it's got some little

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.420 
clock there and it's got some little
LEDs<00:02:29.150> in<00:02:29.330> there<00:02:29.480> that<00:02:29.660> light<00:02:29.810> it<00:02:29.960> up<00:02:30.430> overall

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
LEDs in there that light it up overall

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.180 
LEDs in there that light it up overall
good<00:02:31.820> doc<00:02:32.120> good<00:02:32.660> sound<00:02:32.990> quality<00:02:33.110> from<00:02:33.740> the

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
good doc good sound quality from the

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.580 
good doc good sound quality from the
actual<00:02:34.460> device<00:02:34.790> as<00:02:35.060> I<00:02:35.840> said<00:02:36.020> you<00:02:36.140> can<00:02:36.170> put<00:02:36.470> in

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
actual device as I said you can put in

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.610 
actual device as I said you can put in

the 80 gig 30 gauge 16 gig or eight gig
models<00:02:40.010> and<00:02:40.220> again<00:02:40.430> I'm<00:02:40.550> not<00:02:40.580> sure<00:02:40.880> about<00:02:40.910> the

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
models and again I'm not sure about the

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:47.290 
models and again I'm not sure about the
zune<00:02:42.470> HD<00:02:43.900> it<00:02:44.900> does<00:02:45.710> have<00:02:46.130> which<00:02:46.880> I<00:02:47.090> was

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
zune HD it does have which I was

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.060 
zune HD it does have which I was
actually<00:02:47.480> a<00:02:47.630> little<00:02:47.720> bit<00:02:47.900> surprised<00:02:48.170> about<00:02:48.380> it

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
actually a little bit surprised about it

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:52.600 
actually a little bit surprised about it
has<00:02:49.370> a<00:02:49.810> exhilarate<00:02:50.810> in<00:02:50.960> auxiliary<00:02:51.500> out<00:02:51.740> and<00:02:52.100> a

has a exhilarate in auxiliary out and a
video<00:02:52.880> out<00:02:53.240> I'm<00:02:53.570> not<00:02:53.810> entirely<00:02:54.170> sure<00:02:54.350> what

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:54.740 
video out I'm not entirely sure what

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:59.830 
video out I'm not entirely sure what
that's<00:02:54.860> for<00:02:55.220> yet<00:02:56.620> so<00:02:57.620> this<00:02:58.340> is<00:02:58.370> the<00:02:58.670> Z<00:02:59.060> live<00:02:59.270> doc

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840

Z live amplified speaker system um and
i'm<00:03:03.170> pretty<00:03:04.160> sure<00:03:04.430> z<00:03:04.790> live<00:03:05.000> makes<00:03:05.300> it<00:03:05.540> but<00:03:05.720> i

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
i'm pretty sure z live makes it but i

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.350 
i'm pretty sure z live makes it but i
can't<00:03:06.290> find<00:03:06.500> an<00:03:07.040> actual<00:03:07.250> z<00:03:07.640> live<00:03:07.820> website
