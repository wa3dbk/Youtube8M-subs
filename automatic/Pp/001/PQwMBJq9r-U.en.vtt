we<00:00:03.419> asked<00:00:03.810> families<00:00:04.020> from<00:00:04.350> around<00:00:04.500> the

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:04.650 
we asked families from around the

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.950 
we asked families from around the
country<00:00:04.830> to<00:00:05.040> answer<00:00:05.339> the<00:00:05.460> question<00:00:08.960> Rokenbok

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
country to answer the question Rokenbok

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.770 
country to answer the question Rokenbok
is<00:00:10.170> a<00:00:10.200> modular<00:00:10.980> combination<00:00:11.940> of<00:00:12.120> construction

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
is a modular combination of construction

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.930 
is a modular combination of construction
toys<00:00:13.019> and<00:00:13.440> remote-controlled<00:00:14.190> vehicles<00:00:14.309> and

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
toys and remote-controlled vehicles and

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.730 
toys and remote-controlled vehicles and
you<00:00:15.299> can<00:00:15.509> build<00:00:15.780> so<00:00:16.199> many<00:00:16.379> things<00:00:18.740> build

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
you can build so many things build

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.689 
you can build so many things build
worlds<00:00:20.520> for<00:00:21.029> these<00:00:21.359> vehicles<00:00:22.199> to<00:00:22.769> operate<00:00:23.519> it

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
worlds for these vehicles to operate it

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.779 
worlds for these vehicles to operate it
it<00:00:24.300> allows<00:00:24.660> you<00:00:24.990> to<00:00:25.220> integrate<00:00:26.220> different

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
it allows you to integrate different

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.730 
it allows you to integrate different
elements<00:00:27.210> of<00:00:27.330> you<00:00:27.900> know<00:00:27.990> like<00:00:28.170> logic<00:00:28.560> based

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
elements of you know like logic based

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.880 
elements of you know like logic based
thinking<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.670> process<00:00:30.179> of<00:00:30.359> coming<00:00:30.570> up<00:00:30.840> with

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:30.890 
thinking the process of coming up with

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.040 
thinking the process of coming up with
what<00:00:31.890> you<00:00:32.009> want<00:00:32.189> to<00:00:32.279> build<00:00:32.690> taking<00:00:33.690> it<00:00:33.780> from<00:00:33.870> a

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
what you want to build taking it from a

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.150 
what you want to build taking it from a
design<00:00:34.200> state<00:00:35.100> into<00:00:36.500> actual<00:00:37.500> building<00:00:38.010> the

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
design state into actual building the

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.700 
design state into actual building the
thing<00:00:38.340> that<00:00:38.489> that<00:00:38.879> you<00:00:39.059> imagine<00:00:39.719> Rokenbok

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
thing that that you imagine Rokenbok

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.430 
thing that that you imagine Rokenbok
allows<00:00:41.070> us<00:00:41.370> to<00:00:41.930> play<00:00:42.930> together<00:00:43.140> my<00:00:43.649> son<00:00:43.890> and<00:00:44.070> I

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:45.440 
allows us to play together my son and I

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.990 
allows us to play together my son and I
obviously<00:00:46.440> it<00:00:46.920> holds<00:00:47.219> his<00:00:47.340> attention<00:00:47.850> he

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
obviously it holds his attention he

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.020 
obviously it holds his attention he
could<00:00:48.989> play<00:00:49.170> ours<00:00:49.500> with<00:00:49.739> it<00:00:49.890> but<00:00:50.370> also<00:00:50.550> is

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
could play ours with it but also is

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.709 
could play ours with it but also is
complex<00:00:51.570> enough<00:00:51.899> that<00:00:51.960> we<00:00:52.739> can<00:00:52.890> build<00:00:53.129> very

00:00:53.709 --> 00:00:53.719 
complex enough that we can build very

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:55.939 
complex enough that we can build very
complex<00:00:54.719> structures<00:00:55.199> and<00:00:55.469> it'll<00:00:55.620> keep<00:00:55.800> my

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
complex structures and it'll keep my

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:56.990 
complex structures and it'll keep my
attention<00:00:56.129> as<00:00:56.550> well

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
I like that all of my families can sit

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.360 
I like that all of my families can sit
down<00:00:59.100> and<00:00:59.340> play<00:00:59.399> with<00:00:59.550> it<00:01:00.350> and<00:01:01.350> it's<00:01:01.890> quiet

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
down and play with it and it's quiet

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.160 
down and play with it and it's quiet
there's<00:01:02.730> plenty<00:01:03.059> of<00:01:03.090> things<00:01:03.300> for<00:01:03.480> everyone<00:01:03.870> to
