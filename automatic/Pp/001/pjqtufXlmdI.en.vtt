difference<00:00:30.570> between<00:00:30.960> to<00:00:31.349> the<00:00:31.439> device<00:00:31.769> as<00:00:32.340> you

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
difference between to the device as you

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.490 
difference between to the device as you
can<00:00:32.730> see<00:00:32.970> if<00:00:33.300> you<00:00:33.449> compare<00:00:33.780> this<00:00:33.900> like<00:00:34.170> side<00:00:34.470> by

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
can see if you compare this like side by

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.209 
can see if you compare this like side by
side<00:00:35.480> there's<00:00:36.480> a<00:00:36.570> huge<00:00:36.840> difference<00:00:37.219> like

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
side there's a huge difference like

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.060 
side there's a huge difference like
about<00:00:38.870> almost<00:00:39.870> once<00:00:40.079> they<00:00:40.290> meet<00:00:40.500> is<00:00:40.649> different

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
about almost once they meet is different

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.920 
about almost once they meet is different
on<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.280> width<00:00:41.520> and<00:00:44.300> one<00:00:45.300> centimeter<00:00:45.809> is

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
on the width and one centimeter is

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.100 
on the width and one centimeter is
different<00:00:46.230> about<00:00:46.320> all<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.820> height<00:00:48.030> of<00:00:48.300> the

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
different about all the height of the

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.709 
different about all the height of the
device<00:00:49.379> okay<00:00:49.739> and<00:00:49.980> thickness<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.910> pub<00:00:51.600> is

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
device okay and thickness the pub is

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.389 
device okay and thickness the pub is
saying<00:00:51.930> it's<00:00:52.350> not<00:00:52.530> much<00:00:52.649> that<00:00:52.800> they<00:00:52.950> can<00:00:53.160> do<00:00:53.309> I

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
saying it's not much that they can do I

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:54.709 
saying it's not much that they can do I
think<00:00:53.489> this<00:00:53.640> is<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:53.910> best<00:00:54.120> that<00:00:54.329> they<00:00:54.450> can<00:00:54.510> see

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
think this is the best that they can see

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.950 
think this is the best that they can see
from<00:00:54.840> library<00:00:55.289> so<00:00:55.500> far<00:00:56.629> the<00:00:57.629> major<00:00:57.809> difference

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
from library so far the major difference

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.979 
from library so far the major difference
is<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.530> width<00:00:58.800> and<00:00:58.949> then<00:00:59.579> you<00:01:00.539> can<00:01:00.719> see<00:01:00.960> right

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
is the width and then you can see right

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.700 
is the width and then you can see right
now<00:01:01.199> to<00:01:02.090> the<00:01:03.090> trackpad<00:01:03.539> and<00:01:03.719> a<00:01:04.199> trackball<00:01:04.589> in

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
now to the trackpad and a trackball in

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.940 
now to the trackpad and a trackball in
the<00:01:04.770> boat<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.700> trackball<00:01:06.180> I<00:01:07.140> heard<00:01:07.649> that<00:01:07.770> like

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
the boat the trackball I heard that like

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.260 
the boat the trackball I heard that like
some<00:01:08.100> people<00:01:08.340> are<00:01:08.399> complaining<00:01:08.700> saying<00:01:08.970> those

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
some people are complaining saying those

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.350 
some people are complaining saying those
up<00:01:09.780> there<00:01:09.840> couple<00:01:10.110> times<00:01:10.350> with<00:01:10.439> huge<00:01:10.710> like<00:01:10.950> the

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:11.360 
up there couple times with huge like the

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.060 
up there couple times with huge like the
céline<00:01:12.360> that<00:01:12.659> Trev<00:01:12.960> inside<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.470> tripod<00:01:13.860> make

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
céline that Trev inside the tripod make

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.670 
céline that Trev inside the tripod make
it<00:01:14.189> hard<00:01:14.520> to<00:01:14.580> use<00:01:14.850> so<00:01:15.510> there's<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:16.229> optical

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
it hard to use so there's the optical

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.080 
it hard to use so there's the optical
trackpad<00:01:16.890> right<00:01:17.250> now<00:01:17.400> solve<00:01:17.700> this<00:01:17.820> issue

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
trackpad right now solve this issue

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.320 
trackpad right now solve this issue
completely<00:01:18.510> you<00:01:19.409> know<00:01:19.439> right<00:01:19.799> just<00:01:20.100> by
