you're going to add you're going to
surround<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.439> plant<00:01:40.680> with<00:01:40.860> it<00:01:40.979> again<00:01:41.189> so<00:01:42.090> it

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
surround the plant with it again so it

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.940 
surround the plant with it again so it
can<00:01:42.390> keep<00:01:42.570> on<00:01:42.780> holding<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.380> moisture<00:01:43.770> in<00:01:43.920> the

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
can keep on holding the moisture in the

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.580 
can keep on holding the moisture in the
soil<00:01:44.250> for<00:01:44.610> you<00:01:45.229> dig<00:01:46.229> a<00:01:46.259> hole<00:01:46.790> that<00:01:47.790> is<00:01:48.590> about

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
soil for you dig a hole that is about

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.300 
soil for you dig a hole that is about
twice<00:01:50.490> as<00:01:50.729> wide<00:01:50.909> as<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.960> plant<00:01:52.259> so<00:01:52.979> that<00:01:53.130> looks

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
twice as wide as the plant so that looks

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.310 
twice as wide as the plant so that looks
like<00:01:53.430> it's<00:01:53.640> about<00:01:53.729> four<00:01:54.420> or<00:01:54.540> five<00:01:54.720> inches<00:01:54.750> so

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
like it's about four or five inches so

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.609 
like it's about four or five inches so
we're<00:01:55.500> going<00:01:55.649> to<00:01:55.710> dig<00:01:56.219> a<00:01:56.490> foot<00:01:57.090> wide<00:01:57.930> hole<00:01:58.350> or

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.270 
so and it's going to be just as deep as
the<00:02:03.030> plant<00:02:03.329> is<00:02:03.600> tall

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280

we've<00:03:39.060> got<00:03:39.239> the<00:03:39.390> right<00:03:39.540> height<00:03:39.810> so<00:03:40.140> I'm<00:03:40.829> just

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
we've got the right height so I'm just
