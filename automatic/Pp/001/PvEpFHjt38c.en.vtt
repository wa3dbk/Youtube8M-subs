00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
beast so let's get this test ad so

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.270 
beast so let's get this test ad so
before<00:00:36.540> i<00:00:36.660> get<00:00:36.809> the<00:00:36.899> test<00:00:37.110> at<00:00:37.290> a<00:00:37.410> time<00:00:37.590> i'm<00:00:38.070> just

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
before i get the test at a time i'm just

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.560 
before i get the test at a time i'm just
going<00:00:38.489> to<00:00:38.550> make<00:00:38.640> sure<00:00:38.850> that<00:00:39.030> we<00:00:39.120> don't<00:00:39.239> have<00:00:39.390> no

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
going to make sure that we don't have no

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:50.600 
going to make sure that we don't have no
running<00:00:39.899> applications<00:00:44.930> ok<00:00:45.930> so<00:00:49.610> the

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
running applications ok so the

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.069 
running applications ok so the
application<00:00:51.090> i'm<00:00:51.180> using<00:00:51.480> to<00:00:51.600> perform<00:00:51.930> the

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
application i'm using to perform the

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.290 
application i'm using to perform the
testes<00:00:52.559> quadrant<00:00:53.190> standard<00:00:53.280> so<00:00:54.120> we're<00:00:54.270> just

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
testes quadrant standard so we're just

testes quadrant standard so we're just
going<00:00:54.510> to<00:00:54.570> run<00:00:54.719> a<00:00:54.750> full<00:00:54.960> benchmark<00:00:55.559> test

00:01:47.709 --> 00:01:47.719 

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:50.270 

okay<00:01:48.719> so<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:48.990> results<00:01:49.469> are<00:01:49.619> in<00:01:49.770> let's<00:01:50.070> have<00:01:50.219> a

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
okay so the results are in let's have a

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:57.410 
okay so the results are in let's have a
look<00:01:50.429> at<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.609> note<00:01:50.789> 2<00:01:51.090> first<00:01:55.880> so<00:01:56.880> on<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:57.240> note

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
look at the note 2 first so on the note

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.779 
look at the note 2 first so on the note
2<00:01:57.630> we've<00:01:57.840> scored<00:01:58.170> seven<00:01:58.950> thousand<00:01:59.610> and<00:01:59.850> six

let's<00:02:02.789> have<00:02:02.939> a<00:02:02.969> look<00:02:03.149> under<00:02:03.539> s<00:02:03.780> far<00:02:06.770> we've

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
let's have a look under s far we've

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.550 
let's have a look under s far we've
scored<00:02:08.039> twelve<00:02:08.610> thousand<00:02:09.450> four<00:02:10.080> hundred<00:02:10.110> and

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
scored twelve thousand four hundred and

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.720
