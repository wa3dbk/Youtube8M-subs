00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.779
 hi everyone knows that you know 

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:19.150
 today I have a new video for 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:20.560
 here you are episode 1 of a new 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.080
 series that I start on my channel so 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.369
 his tips overcharge kids that's it 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.890
 episode 1 it makes you talk about 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:28.750
 the importance of sound so what I have 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:29.260
 done I was in a melee match 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:30.869
 General 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:33.340
 I took a knife class 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.050
 obviously when happy only plays 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.090
 with a knife we â€‹â€‹do not have many options 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.730
 we need to remain calm and you need that 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.930
 we're just trying to listen to the enemies and 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:42.219
 to really not ten thousand ways to play 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:47.230
 with a knife it's really the only one 

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:50.620
 way we observe shown just in 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.250
 watching the video how much to what 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.989
 point it helps 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.000
 you often go all of a sudden 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:58.239
 I'm going to start moving from my little one 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.410
 campan spot and obviously I camp 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:01.510
 because I play football we can not 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:03.129
 start at rhj's everywhere and cut 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.000
 enemies do not work like that 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:08.460
 unfortunately I'm not a 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.810
 mad behemoth all the time but 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.549
 to use a helmet it's not necessary 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.770
 to be a game breaker it can be a 

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:17.080
 normal headphone me what that 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.900
 I use it's a bose headset for the 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.430
 So music is not a 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.750
 breakage but it's going very well 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.700
 to listen is not obviously so 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:26.740
 you do not use a game headset you 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.210
 do not be able to talk to friends and 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.100
 use the xbox live chat 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:33.340
 but good if you play solo often 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:37.600
 like me you just want to improve 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:39.670
 your your game by arriving to listen 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.930
 the not use just a headset that's going 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.210
 already help you enormously 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:47.740
 and as I really said the only 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:49.000
 advantage a game helmet it's power 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.630
 talk to your friends 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.310
 so I know that good case this beautiful 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.170
 it's still a headphone attached to his 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.299
 dear ones so would that the sound quality 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.799
 maybe a little better than on 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:01.869
 other helmets and if you want I 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:05.049
 advise you another headset for the 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:06.250
 game it would be turtle beach for those 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:08.110
 who do not want to spend too much money 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:15.280
 I would say there you are going to spend between 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:16.599
 60 and 100 euros I think and if ever 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.970
 you want to spend a little more 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:21.849
 money on your helmet I advise 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:25.900
 the astro or at the limit the turtle beach 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:28.830
 px5 so it's still helmets 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:31.000
 which will cost about 250 euros 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:35.349
 so it's still quite expensive but if 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.870
 you really want to have the advantage over 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:41.830
 sound level this is the case what I 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:43.330
 advise and for the assets so that 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:45.370
 that must be used to be able to 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.830
 correctly listen to the footsteps of enemies 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:50.440
 must use dead silence and 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:56.290
 amplification so death silence 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:59.319
 can reduce the sound you that that 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:01.629
 you do to the merchants and 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:03.760
 amplification allows you to listen more 

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:05.500
 strongly the pace of listening to enemies 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.760
 so these are the two strengths that I 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.890
 advise otherwise you can click 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.370
 on the screen will be able to go see a house 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:10.750
 or a video 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.129
 I thank you for watching this 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.989
 video guys and do not forget to 

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:16.440
 leave a little i like to the next 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:16.440
 bye
