00:00:01.399 --> 00:00:13.730
 as for you armed forces so much I'm 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:18.090
 congratulates most of the executives 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:22.910
 of the national army who serve with 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:28.140
 dedication with selflessness with zeal 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:32.219
 I still condemn the attitude of 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:35.309
 few tiny numbers of officers 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:37.980
 unfortunate who because they have to 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:41.850
 resume the action of nuc the colonel 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:44.420
 banza now it exists within 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.760
 the army someone one or two elements 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.770
 mediocre who makes the clever I would like 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.170
 invite journalists to be able to 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.649
 detect if he was able to 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.070
 detect 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:59.219
 do not wait until the day when the 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.320
 thing that went on at worst to come 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.550
 to say that the bokassa newspaper after the 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.680
 malignant he killed someone 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.229
 extract I want to invite the journalists 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.780
 who are used to clichés them and 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.970
 embassies that are used to 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:14.610
 foment false rumors to come tell me 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.409
 the opposite here because I say within 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.670
 armies farges there are one or two 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.070
 harmful elements 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.580
 so I still want foreign ones even 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.580
 prove otherwise 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:29.369
 personally I am advised 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.350
 I have been told a lot of the story of a 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.799
 slap colonel basa since taking 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.439
 power 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.880
 I did not have more but one day 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.189
 does not prevent April 10 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.380
 Lieutenant Colonel Banza had 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.930
 surrendered to calq assail and had invited 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.509
 the whole army coming to kill the 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.270
 general bokassa what the army 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:50.490
 had it answered no we can not 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.079
 killed the general Bokassa because it is the father 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.560
 of the army it is he who founded the army 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:56.219
 and rightly so because when I was 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.530
 transferred 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:00.570
 but facing the French armies with the 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.329
 captain's guy after 23 in 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.729
 review who knows that I had found here at 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:07.770
 bangui as officer lift the finger 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:11.069
 what is the officer who was before me 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:13.110
 to Bangui at Fort Lamy after the city at 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:15.810
 Gabon 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.490
 lift your finger this is me I'm 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:26.610
 arrived here as captain that's good 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:28.440
 missed that army so we say 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.540
 today we take the first soldier 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.280
 who created the hand we will kill him but 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.540
 whoever will kill the first soldier is 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.390
 what she will stand for him is what he 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.860
 rest there he will not stay they are 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.380
 located at it not turn and nothing 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:43.800
 else what's the point of subversion? 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.250
 there are some here that fall to us 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.860
 hints 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.209
 but this case is the push 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.680
 to the end and we will know a 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:51.390
 day the truth in front of the public 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.690
 now if we take someone who 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:56.430
 made of the situation I demens it I 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.350
 of what had announced but I do not dare 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.800
 I still keep the secret up to 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.800
 timely 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.550
 what did not I do for the 

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:14.670
 Central African Republic in the 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:18.120
 field of the army after creating 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:22.290
 this army this army that had a 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:28.290
 300-man squad in 1966 at the match 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:29.730
 january today all of 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:33.090
 public phases of the republic 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:36.150
 Central African exceeds five thousand men 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.590
 and what is it that reproaches me 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.690
 what is the comparison between 300 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.920
 people and 5000 people 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.720
 what is the difference between these two 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.760
 numbers is what you can me 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.349
 deny 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.480
 what did not I do I write 

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:50.069
 the arts school on the rise I still 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.970
 it's the Republican Guard and Reform 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:52.829
 the Republican Guard 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.720
 I reinforced the strength of the army of 

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:56.190
 land i write the navy 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.450
 I put together a squadron 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:00.420
 Saint-Affricain with the help of 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:02.340
 French jamie the genie on foot with the 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.690
 French contest I installed with 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.480
 the ambassador of israel contest 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:08.400
 the national pioneering youth and all 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.829
 lately I reformed this youth 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:13.500
 national pioneer I strengthen and 

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:15.599
 reform the national police 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:18.410
 I strengthened and developed 

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:18.410
 National Gendarmerie 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:26.340
 I think that on this plane we can not do anything 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:29.010
 blame me and I stand when 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:31.680
 some officers allow themselves to 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:33.889
 bring together the young officers coming out 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:36.930
 of the school jean bédel bokassa to drink 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:38.490
 to say you see the president 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:41.880
 bokassa he did this did it that 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:44.280
 because I do not tolerate that being of 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:46.919
 the same weapon being the iron of the army 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.960
 the officer to whom I handed the stripes 

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:51.360
 but disrespect is the case 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:53.550
 worthy of a nation the officers to whom 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.200
 I gave the stripes must respect me 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:56.190
 and obedience and owe me the 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:58.530
 military discipline 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:00.330
 that's what I'm saying here and that's 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:02.120
 like that we will beat the nation we do not 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:05.099
 can not build the nation into anarchy 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:07.020
 there are among the officers of the army of 

00:05:05.099 --> 00:05:08.789
 land of the officer I recruited 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:11.099
 in the national army as had to the 

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:13.949
 chief and who are today 

00:05:11.099 --> 00:05:15.930
 senior officers at this also me 

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:17.190
 gave eternal gratitude and that's 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:19.710
 like that we were leaving the republic 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:21.390
 african soon 

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:23.190
 you will see in the army of 

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:24.810
 general officers and well that would be 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:25.560
 lying but when the balloon and that's 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:28.410
 complitly normal 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:29.760
 I do not accept when throwing the 

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:32.790
 discredit of the mmm and ethical 

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:35.040
 in the bars in the bistros in the 

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:37.110
 homes by saying here you see the 

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:38.550
 kind of gaza he did that but if you 

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:40.650
 were in my place what are you 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:45.810
 would you do more than 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:48.570
 me or less how do I invite those who 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:50.280
 have the consciousness that their work to 

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:53.160
 come here in front of the microphone to get 

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:54.840
 justify to the people with me but 

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:56.490
 the one who told me come today if 

00:05:54.840 --> 00:06:12.750
 I'm waiting for a noise tomorrow 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:16.020
 will introduce to fire and kita attitude has 

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:19.460
 complete the national army with fake 

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:23.700
 title of citizen we will see later 

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:24.930
 I am this question of nearly as much I 

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:27.330
 pay tribute to all Central Africans 

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:28.530
 as full as I am 

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:31.440
 recognizing all these five Africans 

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:33.390
 for their united effort so much I condemn 

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:37.910
 some elements that camouflages and a 

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:37.910
 day the denunciation is rare 

00:06:42.339 --> 00:06:51.889
 an external policy I proclaim 

00:06:46.959 --> 00:06:55.119
 solemnly and antigua that our 

00:06:51.889 --> 00:06:58.159
 politics is a human politics 

00:06:55.119 --> 00:06:59.019

00:06:58.159 --> 00:07:01.819

00:06:59.019 --> 00:07:02.559
 we want friendship with the world 

00:07:01.819 --> 00:07:07.099

00:07:02.559 --> 00:07:08.269
 whoever accepts our principle of peace 

00:07:07.099 --> 00:07:11.509
 and friendship 

00:07:08.269 --> 00:07:12.079
 we stay friends with him until 

00:07:11.509 --> 00:07:14.719
 eternity 

00:07:12.079 --> 00:07:17.209
 whoever does not want he is free to 

00:07:14.719 --> 00:07:17.629
 refuse his friendship and denied fair 

00:07:17.209 --> 00:07:21.369
 value 

00:07:17.629 --> 00:07:21.369
