about<00:00:27.330> it<00:00:27.840> some<00:00:28.349> just<00:00:28.890> don't<00:00:29.189> know<00:00:29.460> when<00:00:29.699> to

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
about it some just don't know when to

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.100 
about it some just don't know when to
use<00:00:30.119> it<00:00:30.390> or<00:00:30.710> when<00:00:31.710> to<00:00:32.130> try<00:00:32.369> to<00:00:32.430> avoid<00:00:32.759> it<00:00:33.110> the

use it or when to try to avoid it the

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.740 
use it or when to try to avoid it the
thing<00:00:34.410> is<00:00:34.440> our<00:00:35.250> team<00:00:35.550> actually<00:00:36.090> gives<00:00:36.600> your

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
thing is our team actually gives your

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.770 
thing is our team actually gives your
hair<00:00:37.190> screen<00:00:38.190> and<00:00:39.290> structure<00:00:40.290> so<00:00:41.450> if<00:00:42.450> you're

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
hair screen and structure so if you're

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.750 
hair screen and structure so if you're
relaxed<00:00:43.410> most<00:00:43.770> likely<00:00:44.219> you're<00:00:44.399> going<00:00:44.579> to<00:00:44.670> be

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
relaxed most likely you're going to be

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.970 
relaxed most likely you're going to be
needing<00:00:44.789> proteins<00:00:45.510> I<00:00:45.780> know<00:00:46.079> a<00:00:46.230> lot<00:00:46.620> of<00:00:46.649> ladies

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
needing proteins I know a lot of ladies

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.479 
needing proteins I know a lot of ladies
have<00:00:47.370> to<00:00:47.520> actually<00:00:47.700> just<00:00:48.090> acts<00:00:48.360> themselves

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:49.489 
have to actually just acts themselves

have to actually just acts themselves
when<00:00:50.489> do<00:00:50.700> I<00:00:50.730> know<00:00:51.059> why<00:00:51.390> you<00:00:51.449> need<00:00:51.750> protein<00:00:52.050> I

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
when do I know why you need protein I

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.139 
when do I know why you need protein I
where<00:00:52.920> will<00:00:53.039> I<00:00:53.160> know<00:00:53.340> what<00:00:53.670> my<00:00:53.789> hair<00:00:53.969> needs

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
where will I know what my hair needs

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.770 
where will I know what my hair needs
moisture<00:00:54.680> well<00:00:55.680> I<00:00:56.070> do<00:00:56.460> a<00:00:56.489> strand<00:00:57.090> test<00:00:57.390> on<00:00:57.660> my

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
moisture well I do a strand test on my

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.680 
moisture well I do a strand test on my
hair<00:00:57.989> to<00:00:58.469> determine<00:00:59.070> what<00:00:59.219> I<00:00:59.250> mean<00:00:59.550> or<00:01:00.210> at

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
hair to determine what I mean or at

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.450 
hair to determine what I mean or at
least<00:01:00.719> I<00:01:01.020> did<00:01:01.289> do<00:01:01.530> that<00:01:01.590> at<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.039> beginning<00:01:02.160> of

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
least I did do that at the beginning of

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.219 
least I did do that at the beginning of
my<00:01:02.579> hair<00:01:02.730> journey<00:01:02.969> before<00:01:03.329> I<00:01:03.570> actually<00:01:03.780> had<00:01:04.110> to

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
my hair journey before I actually had to

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.500 
my hair journey before I actually had to
learn<00:01:04.409> my<00:01:04.680> hair<00:01:04.949> and<00:01:05.129> how<00:01:05.309> it<00:01:05.519> actually<00:01:05.729> felt<00:01:06.240> I

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
learn my hair and how it actually felt I

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.410 
learn my hair and how it actually felt I
take<00:01:07.320> a<00:01:07.350> strand<00:01:07.710> of<00:01:07.830> my<00:01:07.950> hair<00:01:07.979> I<00:01:08.520> dip<00:01:09.210> it<00:01:09.330> in

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
take a strand of my hair I dip it in

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:17.469 
take a strand of my hair I dip it in
water<00:01:09.619> pull<00:01:10.619> it<00:01:10.710> out<00:01:11.990> I<00:01:14.540> start<00:01:15.540> to<00:01:15.869> pull<00:01:16.200> it<00:01:16.380> and

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:17.479 
water pull it out I start to pull it and

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:21.560 
water pull it out I start to pull it and
if<00:01:18.479> it<00:01:18.750> appears<00:01:19.470> gummy<00:01:20.240> they're<00:01:21.240> most<00:01:21.479> likely

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
if it appears gummy they're most likely

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.460 
if it appears gummy they're most likely
i<00:01:21.869> need<00:01:22.110> a<00:01:22.140> protein<00:01:22.640> no<00:01:23.640> I<00:01:23.670> know<00:01:24.180> I<00:01:24.689> heard<00:01:25.080> funny

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
i need a protein no I know I heard funny

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.260 
i need a protein no I know I heard funny
terms<00:01:25.830> when<00:01:26.280> I<00:01:26.310> first<00:01:26.549> started<00:01:26.700> out<00:01:26.970> my<00:01:27.119> hair

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
terms when I first started out my hair

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.330 
terms when I first started out my hair
gel<00:01:27.479> like<00:01:27.720> what<00:01:27.900> is<00:01:28.020> gummy<00:01:28.380> what<00:01:28.890> does<00:01:29.040> gummy

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340

gel like what is gummy what does gummy
feel<00:01:29.670> like<00:01:29.939> well<00:01:30.900> it's<00:01:31.350> something<00:01:31.560> you<00:01:31.860> have<00:01:31.890> a

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
feel like well it's something you have a

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.310 
feel like well it's something you have a
piece<00:01:32.220> of<00:01:32.310> them<00:01:32.540> you<00:01:33.540> stressed<00:01:33.900> that<00:01:33.990> B<00:01:34.110> to

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
piece of them you stressed that B to

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.140 
piece of them you stressed that B to
them<00:01:34.530> it<00:01:34.829> never<00:01:35.100> goes<00:01:35.340> back<00:01:35.670> to<00:01:35.850> this<00:01:35.939> original

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
them it never goes back to this original

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.080 
them it never goes back to this original
state<00:01:37.049> is<00:01:37.290> kind<00:01:37.650> of<00:01:37.770> like<00:01:37.920> stringy<00:01:38.549> and<00:01:38.759> never

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
state is kind of like stringy and never

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.420 
state is kind of like stringy and never
it<00:01:39.600> probably<00:01:40.200> goes<00:01:40.350> back<00:01:40.409> but<00:01:40.950> it<00:01:41.040> doesn't<00:01:41.340> go

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
it probably goes back but it doesn't go

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.270 
it probably goes back but it doesn't go
back<00:01:41.640> to<00:01:41.840> where<00:01:42.840> it<00:01:42.869> was<00:01:43.200> before<00:01:43.409> you<00:01:44.009> start

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
back to where it was before you start

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.450 
back to where it was before you start
pulling<00:01:44.670> on<00:01:44.790> it<00:01:44.820> that's<00:01:45.509> gummy<00:01:45.899> so<00:01:46.409> most<00:01:47.250> life

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
pulling on it that's gummy so most life

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.789 
pulling on it that's gummy so most life
of<00:01:47.610> your<00:01:47.759> hair<00:01:47.970> will<00:01:48.119> need<00:01:48.329> protein<00:01:49.170> to

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
of your hair will need protein to

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.850 
of your hair will need protein to
strengthen<00:01:50.520> it<00:01:50.729> now<00:01:51.600> you<00:01:52.049> pull<00:01:52.290> that<00:01:52.530> string

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
strengthen it now you pull that string

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.670 
strengthen it now you pull that string
breaks<00:01:53.490> like<00:01:53.790> immediately<00:01:54.750> or<00:01:55.140> it<00:01:55.259> appears
