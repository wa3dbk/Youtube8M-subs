00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:37.400 
game kind of handlings a bit rough

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.860 
game kind of handlings a bit rough
that's<00:01:38.400> partly<00:01:38.790> me<00:01:39.030> being<00:01:39.300> new<00:01:39.450> to<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.690> games

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:39.870 
that's partly me being new to the games

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:42.740 
that's partly me being new to the games
the<00:01:40.080> handling<00:01:40.500> wasn't<00:01:40.950> great<00:01:41.280> overall<00:01:41.750> the

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
the handling wasn't great overall the

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.350 
the handling wasn't great overall the
traffic's<00:01:43.200> pretty<00:01:43.320> much<00:01:44.180> basic<00:01:45.180> issue

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
traffic's pretty much basic issue

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:56.530 
traffic's pretty much basic issue
looking<00:01:46.220> ok

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:04.609 

okay

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.779 

so<00:02:05.100> I'll<00:02:05.310> fight<00:02:05.520> it<00:02:05.640> going<00:02:05.970> along<00:02:06.180> here<00:02:07.789> and

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
so I'll fight it going along here and

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:13.850 
so I'll fight it going along here and
watch<00:02:08.970> it<00:02:09.119> anyone<00:02:09.450> watching<00:02:09.869> them<00:02:11.959> so<00:02:12.959> stop

that
I'll<00:02:16.310> go<00:02:16.430> get<00:02:16.610> something<00:02:16.940> to<00:02:17.330> drop<00:02:18.880> when<00:02:19.880> I

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
I'll go get something to drop when I

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.290 
I'll go get something to drop when I
stopped<00:02:20.780> again<00:02:21.460> just<00:02:22.460> the<00:02:22.640> kids<00:02:22.880> of<00:02:23.030> the<00:02:23.120> air

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:23.300 
stopped again just the kids of the air

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.240

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
position my right button from when I

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:32.080 
position my right button from when I
from<00:02:25.820> where<00:02:26.030> I<00:02:26.060> video<00:02:26.450> a<00:02:26.810> bit<00:02:27.410> about<00:02:27.590> a<00:02:31.060> bit<00:02:32.060> of

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
from where I video a bit about a bit of

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:40.600 
from where I video a bit about a bit of
a<00:02:32.240> B<00:02:32.420> basically<00:02:32.930> because<00:02:33.890> I'm<00:02:34.070> around<00:02:34.490> what<00:02:39.610> we

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
a B basically because I'm around what we

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.950 
a B basically because I'm around what we
see<00:02:40.910> what<00:02:42.550> I'm<00:02:43.550> sort<00:02:43.790> of<00:02:43.820> stable<00:02:44.480> so<00:02:44.720> it<00:02:44.750> just

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:44.960 
see what I'm sort of stable so it just

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:49.110 
see what I'm sort of stable so it just
makes<00:02:45.140> it<00:02:45.320> a<00:02:45.380> little<00:02:45.620> bit<00:02:46.100> difficult<00:02:46.340> right

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.630 

know<00:02:50.120> if<00:02:50.480> they're<00:02:50.660> gonna<00:02:50.840> make<00:02:51.080> that<00:02:51.260> corner

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
know if they're gonna make that corner

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.010 
know if they're gonna make that corner
never<00:02:52.640> gonna<00:02:52.880> make<00:02:53.060> that<00:02:53.120> corner<00:02:53.480> it's<00:02:53.780> never

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.020 
never gonna make that corner it's never

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.410 
never gonna make that corner it's never
gonna<00:02:54.200> make<00:02:54.290> it<00:02:54.820> survives<00:02:55.820> of<00:02:56.000> the<00:02:56.120> spheres

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
gonna make it survives of the spheres

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:01.000 
gonna make it survives of the spheres
and<00:02:56.510> if<00:02:56.660> I<00:02:56.780> will<00:02:56.990> survive

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.809 

so<00:03:02.010> this<00:03:02.219> is<00:03:02.400> pretty<00:03:02.700> fun

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:05.819 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:13.140 

some<00:03:06.819> yeah<00:03:07.950> they're<00:03:08.950> having<00:03:10.650> nice<00:03:11.730> abs<00:03:12.730> this

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
some yeah they're having nice abs this

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.930 
some yeah they're having nice abs this
my<00:03:13.330> controlling<00:03:14.190> kind<00:03:15.190> of<00:03:15.280> swaying<00:03:15.520> down<00:03:15.760> the

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
my controlling kind of swaying down the

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.300 
my controlling kind of swaying down the
corner<00:03:16.300> now<00:03:16.930> I<00:03:16.959> found<00:03:17.230> that<00:03:17.440> if<00:03:17.530> I<00:03:17.650> went<00:03:18.099> for<00:03:18.280> a

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
corner now I found that if I went for a

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:21.449 
corner now I found that if I went for a
drift<00:03:18.610> I<00:03:19.000> went<00:03:19.959> to<00:03:20.080> address<00:03:20.410> is<00:03:20.680> an<00:03:20.830> absolute

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
drift I went to address is an absolute

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:27.509 
drift I went to address is an absolute
nightmare<00:03:22.410> and<00:03:23.410> yeah<00:03:24.900> absolutely<00:03:26.519> completely

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:27.519 
nightmare and yeah absolutely completely

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:33.059
