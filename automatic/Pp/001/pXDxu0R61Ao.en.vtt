star<00:03:57.400> in<00:03:57.490> the<00:03:57.580> game<00:03:57.760> but<00:03:58.000> we<00:03:58.690> had<00:03:58.780> another<00:03:59.050> game

00:03:59.310 --> 00:03:59.320 
star in the game but we had another game

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.350 
star in the game but we had another game
and<00:03:59.530> this<00:03:59.650> game<00:03:59.710> was<00:04:00.250> actually<00:04:00.670> against<00:04:01.180> a

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:01.360 
and this game was actually against a

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.600 
and this game was actually against a
much<00:04:01.900> much<00:04:02.350> weaker<00:04:02.620> team<00:04:02.980> and<00:04:03.340> for<00:04:03.550> that

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:03.610 
much much weaker team and for that

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:05.160 
much much weaker team and for that
reason<00:04:03.670> i<00:04:04.060> made<00:04:04.210> some<00:04:04.360> substitutions<00:04:05.080> you

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:05.170 
reason i made some substitutions you

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:06.780 
reason i made some substitutions you
know<00:04:05.290> i<00:04:05.320> decided<00:04:05.740> not<00:04:05.770> to<00:04:06.130> play<00:04:06.250> a<00:04:06.310> few<00:04:06.580> the

know i decided not to play a few the
storm<00:04:07.480> players<00:04:07.780> so<00:04:07.960> for<00:04:08.260> example<00:04:08.320> i<00:04:08.650> managed

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920 
storm players so for example i managed

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.620 
storm players so for example i managed
to<00:04:08.950> take<00:04:09.160> off<00:04:09.280> storage<00:04:09.610> there<00:04:09.880> just<00:04:10.360> for<00:04:10.510> the

in<00:04:45.040> this<00:04:45.160> game<00:04:45.340> maybe<00:04:45.880> it<00:04:46.060> should<00:04:46.210> have<00:04:46.300> been<00:04:46.360> a

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:46.420 
in this game maybe it should have been a

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:48.240 
in this game maybe it should have been a
better<00:04:46.570> choice<00:04:46.720> to<00:04:47.140> play<00:04:47.290> yesil<00:04:47.800> or<00:04:47.980> something

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:56.710 
want to do well this season is it would

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:58.290 
want to do well this season is it would
be<00:04:56.830> very<00:04:56.980> typical<00:04:57.520> of<00:04:57.580> me<00:04:57.790> to<00:04:57.820> put<00:04:58.120> out<00:04:58.180> a

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:58.300 
be very typical of me to put out a

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.660 
be very typical of me to put out a
second<00:04:58.900> team<00:04:59.020> and<00:04:59.230> then<00:04:59.620> end<00:04:59.920> up<00:05:00.160> you<00:05:00.370> know<00:05:00.400> not

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:00.670 
second team and then end up you know not

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:02.010 
second team and then end up you know not
even<00:05:00.700> winning<00:05:01.090> the<00:05:01.300> game<00:05:01.450> so<00:05:01.690> it<00:05:01.900> was

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:02.020 
even winning the game so it was

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:03.690 
even winning the game so it was
important<00:05:02.470> i<00:05:02.560> managed<00:05:02.890> to<00:05:02.950> secure<00:05:03.400> the<00:05:03.580> win

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:03.700 
important i managed to secure the win

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:05.100 
important i managed to secure the win
first<00:05:04.060> and<00:05:04.270> then<00:05:04.630> i<00:05:04.750> can<00:05:04.900> make<00:05:05.020> those

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:05.110 
first and then i can make those

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:07.560 
first and then i can make those
substitutions<00:05:05.500> but<00:05:05.950> unfortunately<00:05:06.580> my<00:05:07.270> first

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:07.570 
substitutions but unfortunately my first

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:09.780 
substitutions but unfortunately my first
substitution<00:05:07.930> was<00:05:08.590> a<00:05:08.650> for<00:05:09.040> substitution

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:09.790 
substitution was a for substitution

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:11.550 
substitution was a for substitution
because<00:05:10.150> that<00:05:10.510> was<00:05:10.690> because<00:05:10.930> i<00:05:11.050> was<00:05:11.170> cody

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:11.560 
because that was because i was cody

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.170 
because that was because i was cody

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:24.070 
though it could have been it could have

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:25.260 
though it could have been it could have
been<00:05:24.130> worse<00:05:24.310> with<00:05:24.550> maybe<00:05:24.760> a<00:05:24.850> player<00:05:25.120> who

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:25.270 
been worse with maybe a player who

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:26.490 
been worse with maybe a player who
starts<00:05:25.600> a<00:05:25.690> little<00:05:25.900> bit<00:05:26.020> more<00:05:26.170> often

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:26.500
