we'll give you a quick demonstration on
how<00:03:10.950> this<00:03:11.160> work<00:03:11.310> so<00:03:11.430> I<00:03:11.490> have<00:03:11.760> him<00:03:12.000> set<00:03:12.240> as

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
how this work so I have him set as

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.470 
how this work so I have him set as
pretty<00:03:13.170> loud<00:03:13.470> and<00:03:13.800> complex<00:03:14.670> so<00:03:15.060> we'll<00:03:15.210> see<00:03:15.450> how

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
pretty loud and complex so we'll see how

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:34.700 
pretty loud and complex so we'll see how
that<00:03:15.690> sounds<00:03:16.680> is<00:03:16.860> ok<00:03:32.810> so<00:03:33.810> that's<00:03:34.110> a<00:03:34.320> little<00:03:34.590> bit

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:34.710 
that sounds is ok so that's a little bit

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:37.820 
that sounds is ok so that's a little bit
more<00:03:34.950> of<00:03:35.010> a<00:03:35.070> complex<00:03:35.610> and<00:03:36.090> loud<00:03:36.570> beat<00:03:36.960> and<00:03:37.170> you

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:37.830 
more of a complex and loud beat and you

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:38.960 
more of a complex and loud beat and you
know<00:03:37.950> on<00:03:38.040> the<00:03:38.130> opposite<00:03:38.550> end<00:03:38.640> of<00:03:38.790> the<00:03:38.910> spectrum

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
know on the opposite end of the spectrum

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:40.790 
know on the opposite end of the spectrum
what<00:03:39.480> if<00:03:39.540> we<00:03:39.630> wanted<00:03:39.810> to<00:03:39.870> play<00:03:40.080> somewhat<00:03:40.440> soft

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:40.800 
what if we wanted to play somewhat soft

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.220 
what if we wanted to play somewhat soft
and<00:03:41.130> simple<00:03:41.580> beats<00:03:42.030> would<00:03:42.270> be<00:03:42.450> something<00:03:42.810> like

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
and simple beats would be something like

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.680 
and simple beats would be something like
this<00:03:43.890> and<00:03:44.250> if<00:03:44.340> you<00:03:44.430> can<00:03:44.580> look<00:03:44.730> up<00:03:44.880> at<00:03:45.120> the<00:03:45.510> top

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
this and if you can look up at the top

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.210 
this and if you can look up at the top
here<00:03:45.750> you<00:03:45.960> could<00:03:46.110> actually<00:03:46.230> see<00:03:46.710> that<00:03:46.890> every

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
here you could actually see that every

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.590 
here you could actually see that every
time<00:03:47.430> I<00:03:47.460> make<00:03:47.670> these<00:03:47.910> small<00:03:48.240> changes<00:03:49.010> the<00:03:50.600> the

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
time I make these small changes the the

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.680 
time I make these small changes the the
song<00:03:51.930> or<00:03:52.260> the<00:03:52.290> drum<00:03:53.130> kit<00:03:53.430> actually<00:03:54.030> changes<00:03:54.570> as

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
well as you can see this line up here

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:57.490
