that he's to have to take in that

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:41.320 
that he's to have to take in that
injection<00:03:40.130> you<00:03:40.310> have<00:03:40.400> taped<00:03:40.670> is<00:03:40.850> only<00:03:41.030> phase

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:41.330 
injection you have taped is only phase

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:45.520 
injection you have taped is only phase
one<00:03:41.390> phase<00:03:42.459> one<00:03:43.459> of<00:03:43.670> six<00:03:44.510> phases<00:03:44.720> you<00:03:44.959> see<00:03:45.410> the

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
one phase one of six phases you see the

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:48.250 
one phase one of six phases you see the
red<00:03:45.680> line<00:03:45.890> the<00:03:46.430> red<00:03:46.610> line<00:03:46.850> shows<00:03:46.880> each<00:03:47.840> phase

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260 
red line the red line shows each phase

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.160 
red line the red line shows each phase
he<00:03:48.560> has<00:03:48.739> to<00:03:48.950> take<00:03:49.120> it<00:03:50.120> goes<00:03:50.300> from<00:03:50.480> phase<00:03:50.810> to

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.170 
he has to take it goes from phase to

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:54.160 
he has to take it goes from phase to
phase<00:03:51.200> 2<00:03:51.890> phase<00:03:52.100> 2<00:03:52.580> phase<00:03:52.760> 2<00:03:53.209> phase<00:03:53.390> so<00:03:53.780> this<00:03:53.989> is

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:54.170 
phase 2 phase 2 phase 2 phase so this is

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:56.970 
phase 2 phase 2 phase 2 phase so this is
pretty<00:03:54.380> much<00:03:55.120> process<00:03:56.120> that's<00:03:56.630> gonna<00:03:56.840> take

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
pretty much process that's gonna take

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:00.130 
pretty much process that's gonna take
six<00:03:57.980> months<00:03:58.130> and<00:03:58.550> I<00:03:59.450> have<00:03:59.600> to<00:03:59.750> keep<00:03:59.870> chase

has to hide then you go into shock and

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:10.360 
has to hide then you go into shock and
he<00:04:06.709> could<00:04:06.890> still<00:04:07.100> die<00:04:07.310> so<00:04:08.300> it's<00:04:08.720> just<00:04:08.870> like<00:04:09.370> so
