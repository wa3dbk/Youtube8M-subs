00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.180
 today we are going to talk about adam potter a 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.610
 scottish mountaineer from glasgow who 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:12.690
 he survived a fall of nothing more and 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:15.030
 nothing less than 300 meters something that is 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.670
 really unheard of and that left 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.130
 surprised thousands and thousands of people 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.220
 especially to the comrades who went with 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.369
 he who thought he had died this 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:29.670
 person was climbing the himalayas 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:32.840
 when suddenly he fell and fell 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:35.030
 several times because he first fell 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:39.200
 he said that the only thing he thought about that 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:42.080
 moment was to try to stop the fall it 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:44.510
 he dropped 100 meters first then he 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.240
 it fell again and then again 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.340
 plus 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:50.530
 was unconscious at the time the 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.570
 that he ended up falling and when he regained 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:55.780
 consciousness 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:58.570
 the man so only had three 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.879
 small lesions in the vertebrae and 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:03.970
 some scratches and scratches by the 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:06.940
 body apparently the backpack its huge 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:09.970
 backpack had muffled much of 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:12.700
 the incredible lucky falls the of is the 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:16.479
 of this mountaineer who says that under 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:18.310
 no concept is going to stop escalating and 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:20.250
 plans to climb the everest and 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.800
 other mountains 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:26.520
 more than anything because his life is his life 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:28.560
 Being a mountain climber is is tops 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.410
 it is the maximum to what it aspires to its maximum 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.479
 dream I was afraid of not going back to 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:35.490
 able to climb but with the scratches that 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.430
 has had what he can do without any 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:41.369
 type of complication what person is 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:44.760
 able to survive 300 meters from 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:47.460
 fall I think no one this man 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:49.770
 he simply did the impossible and more 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.119
 taking into account that that zone was zone 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.270
 of rocks that could have fallen 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:57.330
 perfectly on the peak of a rock and 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:00.060
 have gone through but did not have a 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:02.700
 awesome luck and today 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.580
 he's still alive and he's still climbing 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:08.369
 people who whatever happens will not 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:10.990
 they pull back and this person affirms 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:13.630
 that at no time thought 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:16.990
 that his life was in danger, the only thing 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:19.210
 he thought is that there was the possibility of 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:21.750
 that could not scale in the future the 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:21.750
 Everest
