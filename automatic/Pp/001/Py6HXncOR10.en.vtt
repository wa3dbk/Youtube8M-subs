hi everyone last time I showed you how

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:08.520 
hi everyone last time I showed you how
to<00:00:07.000> set<00:00:07.300> up<00:00:07.330> your<00:00:07.569> sous<00:00:07.779> machine<00:00:07.990> and<00:00:08.349> how<00:00:08.470> to

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:08.530 
to set up your sous machine and how to

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:11.520 
to set up your sous machine and how to
print<00:00:08.860> this<00:00:09.340> Aoki<00:00:10.090> chain<00:00:10.360> and<00:00:10.599> today<00:00:11.170> I<00:00:11.200> would

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:11.530 
print this Aoki chain and today I would

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:12.930 
print this Aoki chain and today I would
like<00:00:11.559> to<00:00:11.830> show<00:00:11.950> you<00:00:12.009> how<00:00:12.250> to<00:00:12.309> modify<00:00:12.759> this

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:12.940 
like to show you how to modify this

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:16.560 
like to show you how to modify this
keychain<00:00:13.299> and<00:00:13.780> to<00:00:14.740> double<00:00:15.009> its<00:00:15.129> size<00:00:15.190> and<00:00:15.669> this

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:16.570 
keychain and to double its size and this

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:18.210 
keychain and to double its size and this
can<00:00:16.780> all<00:00:16.960> be<00:00:17.020> accomplished<00:00:17.650> on<00:00:17.830> the<00:00:17.890> sous

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:18.220 
can all be accomplished on the sous

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.750 
can all be accomplished on the sous
machine<00:00:18.400> let's<00:00:19.000> get<00:00:19.180> it<00:00:19.300> started<00:00:19.510> and<00:00:20.580> this<00:00:21.580> is

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:21.760 
machine let's get it started and this is

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.939 
machine let's get it started and this is
the<00:00:21.939> screen<00:00:22.210> of<00:00:22.330> suits<00:00:22.630> and<00:00:22.929> today<00:00:23.289> we<00:00:23.769> look

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:23.949 
the screen of suits and today we look

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:27.089 
the screen of suits and today we look
again<00:00:24.820> into<00:00:25.179> print<00:00:25.449> so<00:00:26.320> I<00:00:26.349> click<00:00:26.679> the<00:00:26.830> print

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:27.099 
again into print so I click the print

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:29.579 
again into print so I click the print
button<00:00:27.160> and<00:00:27.670> here<00:00:27.820> you<00:00:27.970> see<00:00:28.179> the<00:00:28.210> file<00:00:29.050> menu<00:00:29.259> of

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:29.589 
button and here you see the file menu of

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:33.300 
button and here you see the file menu of
the<00:00:29.800> sous<00:00:30.210> and<00:00:31.210> today<00:00:31.929> we<00:00:32.200> look<00:00:32.439> into<00:00:32.740> the<00:00:32.830> STL

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:33.310 
the sous and today we look into the STL

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:37.230 
the sous and today we look into the STL
files<00:00:34.200> here<00:00:35.200> I<00:00:35.410> will<00:00:35.710> note<00:00:35.890> the<00:00:36.070> aio<00:00:36.370> keychain

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:37.240 
files here I will note the aio keychain

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:39.960 
files here I will note the aio keychain
file<00:00:37.860> here<00:00:38.860> we<00:00:39.040> can<00:00:39.220> look<00:00:39.340> at<00:00:39.490> it<00:00:39.520> from<00:00:39.790> all

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:39.970 
file here we can look at it from all

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:42.840 
file here we can look at it from all
sides<00:00:40.140> so<00:00:41.140> this<00:00:41.350> is<00:00:41.530> the<00:00:41.680> key<00:00:41.860> chain<00:00:42.160> that<00:00:42.640> we

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:42.850 
sides so this is the key chain that we

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:44.910 
sides so this is the key chain that we
printed<00:00:43.210> out<00:00:43.360> last<00:00:43.600> time<00:00:43.780> and<00:00:44.140> today<00:00:44.530> we<00:00:44.770> would

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:44.920 
printed out last time and today we would

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.370 
printed out last time and today we would
like<00:00:45.100> to<00:00:45.130> modify<00:00:45.610> it<00:00:45.820> so<00:00:46.630> we<00:00:46.750> click<00:00:46.960> the<00:00:47.110> edit

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:47.380 
like to modify it so we click the edit

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:51.180 
like to modify it so we click the edit
button<00:00:47.410> at<00:00:47.950> the<00:00:48.250> top<00:00:48.580> of<00:00:48.610> the<00:00:48.880> screen<00:00:50.190> here's

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.190 
button at the top of the screen here's

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.030 
button at the top of the screen here's
the<00:00:51.460> raw<00:00:51.700> file<00:00:52.230> and<00:00:53.230> what<00:00:53.440> we<00:00:53.590> would<00:00:53.740> like<00:00:53.860> to

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:54.040 
the raw file and what we would like to

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.460 
the raw file and what we would like to
do<00:00:54.220> changing<00:00:54.940> the<00:00:54.970> size<00:00:55.300> so<00:00:55.780> we<00:00:55.810> have<00:00:56.080> to<00:00:56.230> click

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:56.470 
do changing the size so we have to click

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:00.900 
do changing the size so we have to click
the<00:00:56.500> scale<00:00:57.480> menu<00:00:58.480> and<00:00:58.750> here<00:00:59.290> we<00:00:59.500> type<00:01:00.370> in<00:01:00.610> a<00:01:00.760> new

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:00.910 
the scale menu and here we type in a new

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:03.750 
the scale menu and here we type in a new
ratio<00:01:01.360> and<00:01:01.600> this<00:01:02.410> ratio<00:01:02.680> should<00:01:02.950> be<00:01:03.010> times<00:01:03.430> two

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:03.760 
ratio and this ratio should be times two

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.359 
ratio and this ratio should be times two
because<00:01:03.910> we<00:01:04.210> would<00:01:04.360> like<00:01:04.510> to<00:01:04.540> double<00:01:04.989> the<00:01:05.110> size

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
because we would like to double the size

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.870 
because we would like to double the size
next<00:01:06.369> step<00:01:06.610> we<00:01:06.790> click<00:01:07.060> OK<00:01:07.570> and<00:01:08.369> then<00:01:09.369> we<00:01:09.729> click

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
next step we click OK and then we click

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.179 
next step we click OK and then we click
the<00:01:10.060> scale<00:01:10.450> button<00:01:10.840> and<00:01:11.079> as<00:01:11.380> you<00:01:11.530> can<00:01:11.679> see<00:01:11.710> the

00:01:12.179 --> 00:01:12.189 
the scale button and as you can see the

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:14.459 
the scale button and as you can see the
chick<00:01:12.399> that<00:01:12.429> the<00:01:12.939> size<00:01:13.210> of<00:01:13.509> the<00:01:13.719> keychain

00:01:14.459 --> 00:01:14.469 
chick that the size of the keychain

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:18.989 
chick that the size of the keychain
changed<00:01:15.219> and<00:01:15.759> now<00:01:16.119> we<00:01:16.179> save<00:01:16.659> the<00:01:16.869> file<00:01:17.999> we

00:01:18.989 --> 00:01:18.999 
changed and now we save the file we

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:21.410 
changed and now we save the file we
store<00:01:19.630> it<00:01:19.719> under<00:01:19.960> a<00:01:19.990> new<00:01:20.259> name<00:01:20.289> we<00:01:21.009> call<00:01:21.219> it

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
store it under a new name we call it

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.899 
store it under a new name we call it
Aoki<00:01:22.420> chain<00:01:22.719> two<00:01:23.079> and<00:01:23.289> then<00:01:24.249> store<00:01:24.579> it<00:01:24.609> on<00:01:24.789> the

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:24.909 
Aoki chain two and then store it on the

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:28.499 
Aoki chain two and then store it on the
machine<00:01:25.030> and<00:01:26.280> when<00:01:27.280> we<00:01:27.429> are<00:01:27.520> ready<00:01:27.700> we<00:01:28.479> just
