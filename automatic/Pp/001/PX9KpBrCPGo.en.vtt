when<00:00:27.330> mr.<00:00:28.199> yomo<00:00:28.590> was<00:00:28.830> talking<00:00:29.189> to<00:00:29.310> her<00:00:29.400> and

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
when mr. yomo was talking to her and

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.490 
when mr. yomo was talking to her and

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
join the people out there so I can

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.250 
join the people out there so I can
understand<00:00:36.480> why<00:00:36.630> they<00:00:36.750> wouldn't<00:00:37.020> show<00:00:37.050> her

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
understand why they wouldn't show her

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.319 
understand why they wouldn't show her
doing<00:00:37.559> anything<00:00:37.649> this<00:00:38.399> episode<00:00:38.910> so<00:00:39.090> with<00:00:39.239> that

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
doing anything this episode so with that

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.869 
doing anything this episode so with that
being<00:00:39.540> said<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:40.410> fact<00:00:40.710> that<00:00:40.860> she's<00:00:41.219> in<00:00:41.520> this

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
being said the fact that she's in this

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.779 
being said the fact that she's in this
war<00:00:42.270> and<00:00:42.480> the<00:00:42.660> anime<00:00:43.260> and<00:00:43.590> not<00:00:44.309> in<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.460> manga

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.520 
war and the anime and not in the manga
this<00:00:45.210> leads<00:00:45.539> me<00:00:45.660> to<00:00:45.840> believe<00:00:45.870> that<00:00:46.320> she's

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
this leads me to believe that she's

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.500 
this leads me to believe that she's
going<00:00:46.739> to<00:00:46.920> die<00:00:47.100> like<00:00:47.370> I<00:00:47.579> have<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:47.969> strongest
