right away although there's this locked
chest<00:01:32.770> here<00:01:44.070> pick<00:01:45.070> it<00:01:45.250> and<00:01:45.400> see<00:01:45.610> what's<00:01:45.760> inside

trying to wait in the location that

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.140 
trying to wait in the location that
that's<00:02:20.350> not<00:02:20.590> a<00:02:20.620> good<00:02:20.830> idea<00:02:20.890> what<00:02:21.640> you<00:02:21.760> instead

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:49.580 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:54.050 

I'll<00:04:50.580> take<00:04:50.759> that<00:04:52.340> looks<00:04:53.340> like<00:04:53.460> a<00:04:53.520> skill<00:04:53.880> book

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060 
I'll take that looks like a skill book

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:57.020 
I'll take that looks like a skill book
was<00:04:54.270> on<00:04:54.360> him

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.030 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:03.320 

and<00:04:58.100> spend<00:04:59.100> it<00:04:59.220> third<00:05:01.670> yeah<00:05:02.670> not<00:05:03.000> that<00:05:03.030> much

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:03.330 
and spend it third yeah not that much

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:04.730 
and spend it third yeah not that much
all<00:05:03.630> right<00:05:03.660> let's<00:05:04.020> check<00:05:04.110> what<00:05:04.410> that<00:05:04.530> book

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:04.740 
all right let's check what that book

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:11.540 
all right let's check what that book
does<00:05:08.780> it's<00:05:09.780> that<00:05:10.200> might<00:05:10.410> be<00:05:10.620> destruction<00:05:11.400> but

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:11.550 
does it's that might be destruction but

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:13.130 
does it's that might be destruction but
I'm<00:05:11.640> not<00:05:11.790> sure<00:05:12.090> I<00:05:12.330> might<00:05:12.690> have<00:05:12.810> found<00:05:12.960> another

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:13.140 
I'm not sure I might have found another

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:14.800 
I'm not sure I might have found another
one<00:05:13.410> of<00:05:13.470> those<00:05:13.650> before

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:14.810 
one of those before

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:18.500 
one of those before
either<00:05:15.810> way<00:05:15.990> it's<00:05:16.640> from<00:05:17.640> the<00:05:17.760> price<00:05:18.000> value

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:18.510 
either way it's from the price value

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:20.960 
either way it's from the price value
it's<00:05:18.690> definitely<00:05:19.260> bound<00:05:19.470> to<00:05:19.680> wear<00:05:20.520> something

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:20.970 
it's definitely bound to wear something

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:23.050 
it's definitely bound to wear something
and<00:05:21.090> you<00:05:21.180> can<00:05:21.330> see<00:05:21.570> there's<00:05:21.960> this<00:05:22.260> trapdoor

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:23.060 
and you can see there's this trapdoor

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:27.740 
and you can see there's this trapdoor
now<00:05:24.060> we<00:05:24.120> can<00:05:24.420> go<00:05:24.600> through<00:05:26.210> then<00:05:27.210> we'll<00:05:27.420> find

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:27.750 
now we can go through then we'll find

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:32.990 
now we can go through then we'll find
this<00:05:30.680> coffin<00:05:31.680> and<00:05:31.950> imagine<00:05:32.310> it's<00:05:32.490> the<00:05:32.580> coffin

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:33.000 
this coffin and imagine it's the coffin

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.720 
this coffin and imagine it's the coffin
of<00:05:33.090> the<00:05:33.300> Nord<00:05:33.720> that<00:05:34.110> we<00:05:34.320> were<00:05:34.440> seeing<00:05:34.710> we<00:05:35.700> have

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:35.730 
of the Nord that we were seeing we have

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:40.070 
of the Nord that we were seeing we have
this<00:05:36.030> stuff<00:05:36.300> that<00:05:36.480> we<00:05:36.570> can<00:05:36.720> take<00:05:39.080> basically

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:40.080 
this stuff that we can take basically

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:44.390 
this stuff that we can take basically
it's<00:05:40.290> an<00:05:40.410> iron<00:05:40.590> shield<00:05:41.040> a<00:05:42.890> magical<00:05:43.890> weapon<00:05:44.040> is

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:44.400 
it's an iron shield a magical weapon is

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.750 
it's an iron shield a magical weapon is
apparently<00:05:45.000> it<00:05:45.150> can<00:05:45.390> be<00:05:45.540> random<00:05:45.960> what<00:05:46.140> it<00:05:46.260> is<00:05:46.410> I

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:46.760 
apparently it can be random what it is I

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:49.250 
apparently it can be random what it is I
don't<00:05:47.760> think<00:05:48.030> it's<00:05:48.180> necessary<00:05:48.690> always<00:05:48.960> the

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:49.260 
don't think it's necessary always the

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:53.690 
don't think it's necessary always the
staff<00:05:50.300> but<00:05:52.040> all<00:05:53.040> right<00:05:53.250> let's<00:05:53.430> get<00:05:53.550> out<00:05:53.669> of

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:53.700 
staff but all right let's get out of

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:55.900 
staff but all right let's get out of
here<00:05:54.410> there<00:05:55.410> you<00:05:55.500> got<00:05:55.680> it

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:55.910 
here there you got it

00:05:55.910 --> 00:06:02.730 
here there you got it
let's<00:05:56.910> check<00:05:57.150> out<00:05:57.300> what<00:05:57.450> this<00:05:57.570> stuff<00:05:57.720> can<00:05:57.870> do

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:02.740 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:04.960 

creatures<00:06:03.740> and<00:06:03.890> people<00:06:03.980> up<00:06:04.160> to<00:06:04.280> level<00:06:04.550> 12<00:06:04.730> flee

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:04.970 
creatures and people up to level 12 flee

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:08.790 
creatures and people up to level 12 flee
from<00:06:05.120> combat<00:06:05.390> for<00:06:05.660> 30<00:06:05.840> seconds<00:06:06.380> yeah<00:06:07.010> I

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:08.800 
from combat for 30 seconds yeah I

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:10.780 
from combat for 30 seconds yeah I
wouldn't<00:06:09.800> probably<00:06:09.890> make<00:06:10.220> much<00:06:10.460> use<00:06:10.640> to<00:06:10.670> the

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:10.790 
wouldn't probably make much use to the

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:13.030 
wouldn't probably make much use to the
staff<00:06:11.120> but<00:06:11.360> it's<00:06:11.510> worth<00:06:11.780> 1,800<00:06:12.380> gold<00:06:12.620> which<00:06:12.860> is

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:13.040 
staff but it's worth 1,800 gold which is

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:16.720 
staff but it's worth 1,800 gold which is
still<00:06:13.280> pretty<00:06:13.460> decent<00:06:14.470> all<00:06:15.470> right<00:06:15.680> so<00:06:16.160> that

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:16.730 
still pretty decent all right so that

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:18.550 
still pretty decent all right so that
trapdoor<00:06:17.000> may<00:06:17.390> or<00:06:17.570> may<00:06:17.690> not<00:06:17.720> be<00:06:17.990> open<00:06:18.320> but<00:06:18.440> if

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:18.560 
trapdoor may or may not be open but if

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:23.440 
trapdoor may or may not be open but if
it<00:06:18.680> isn't<00:06:18.830> you<00:06:19.190> can<00:06:19.370> lock<00:06:19.580> pick<00:06:19.850> it<00:06:22.150> and<00:06:23.150> we<00:06:23.300> can

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:23.450 
it isn't you can lock pick it and we can

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:25.210 
it isn't you can lock pick it and we can
still<00:06:23.690> open<00:06:23.810> it<00:06:24.050> once<00:06:24.200> as<00:06:24.350> close<00:06:24.650> as<00:06:24.920> you<00:06:25.070> can

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:25.220 
still open it once as close as you can

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:29.140 
still open it once as close as you can
see<00:06:25.480> it's<00:06:26.480> no<00:06:26.900> bear<00:06:27.610> but<00:06:28.610> just<00:06:28.790> in<00:06:28.910> case<00:06:29.120> for

travel back to the ruins but this pretty
much<00:07:06.230> wraps<00:07:06.500> up<00:07:06.680> this<00:07:06.860> location<00:07:07.520> it's<00:07:07.669> um<00:07:08.090> the

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:09.220 
much wraps up this location it's um the

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:11.890 
much wraps up this location it's um the
primary<00:07:10.220> location<00:07:10.310> itself<00:07:11.090> isn't<00:07:11.660> so<00:07:11.840> much

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:11.900 
primary location itself isn't so much

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:16.659 
primary location itself isn't so much
other<00:07:12.290> than<00:07:12.530> just<00:07:12.740> that<00:07:12.890> chest<00:07:13.280> and<00:07:15.669> this

00:07:16.659 --> 00:07:16.669 
other than just that chest and this

00:07:16.669 --> 00:07:18.520 
other than just that chest and this
little<00:07:16.940> event<00:07:17.150> that<00:07:17.570> we<00:07:17.750> just<00:07:17.930> kind<00:07:18.200> of<00:07:18.260> follow

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:18.530

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:20.530 
little event that we just kind of follow
as<00:07:19.160> you<00:07:19.310> can<00:07:19.430> see<00:07:19.610> when<00:07:19.790> she<00:07:19.820> come<00:07:20.120> back<00:07:20.240> here

as you can see when she come back here

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:22.390 
as you can see when she come back here
everything<00:07:21.050> is<00:07:21.169> still<00:07:21.440> kind<00:07:21.680> of<00:07:21.770> just<00:07:21.980> normal
