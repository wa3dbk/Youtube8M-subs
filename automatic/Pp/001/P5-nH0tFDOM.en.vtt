00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:39.720 
the color of the sky so if we go to a

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:43.430 
the color of the sky so if we go to a
negative<00:00:40.019> 100<00:00:40.860> we<00:00:41.640> can<00:00:41.850> see<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.780> blue<00:00:43.080> turn

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
negative 100 we can see the blue turn

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.130 
negative 100 we can see the blue turn
into<00:00:43.799> this<00:00:43.979> aqua<00:00:44.760> color<00:00:45.000> and<00:00:45.570> if<00:00:45.690> we<00:00:45.750> go<00:00:45.960> the

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
into this aqua color and if we go the

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.039 
into this aqua color and if we go the
opposite<00:00:46.470> way<00:00:46.650> the<00:00:47.610> blue<00:00:47.909> will<00:00:48.269> change<00:00:48.629> into

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:49.049 
opposite way the blue will change into

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:51.950 
opposite way the blue will change into
this<00:00:49.379> magenta<00:00:49.920> color<00:00:50.400> now<00:00:51.030> just<00:00:51.330> for<00:00:51.570> this

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
this magenta color now just for this

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.920 
this magenta color now just for this
demonstration<00:00:52.199> I'm<00:00:52.949> going<00:00:53.010> to<00:00:53.549> go<00:00:53.760> to<00:00:54.330> minus

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
demonstration I'm going to go to minus

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.770 
demonstration I'm going to go to minus
100<00:00:55.559> now<00:00:56.430> I'm<00:00:56.580> going<00:00:56.760> to<00:00:56.820> click<00:00:57.119> on<00:00:57.360> the

100 now I'm going to click on the

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.789 
100 now I'm going to click on the
building<00:00:58.409> and<00:00:58.699> automatically<00:00:59.699> the<00:01:00.150> orange

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:00.799 
building and automatically the orange

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:04.579 
building and automatically the orange
parameters<00:01:01.799> will<00:01:02.250> be<00:01:02.489> selected<00:01:03.330> and<00:01:03.589> once

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
parameters will be selected and once

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.390 
parameters will be selected and once
again<00:01:04.830> I<00:01:05.159> can<00:01:05.489> drag<00:01:05.729> down<00:01:06.119> or<00:01:06.780> drag<00:01:07.530> up<00:01:07.799> and

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
again I can drag down or drag up and

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.940 
again I can drag down or drag up and
I'll<00:01:09.060> get<00:01:09.240> a<00:01:09.270> different<00:01:09.570> look<00:01:09.840> so<00:01:10.710> I'm<00:01:10.799> just

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
I'll get a different look so I'm just

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.660 
I'll get a different look so I'm just
going<00:01:11.100> to<00:01:11.159> go<00:01:11.250> for<00:01:12.080> something<00:01:13.430> really<00:01:14.430> quite

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
going to go for something really quite

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.820 
going to go for something really quite
weird<00:01:15.060> in<00:01:15.420> terms<00:01:15.720> of<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.020> colors<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:18.800> now<00:01:19.800> I

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
weird in terms of the colors and now I

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.200 
weird in terms of the colors and now I
can<00:01:20.160> also<00:01:21.290> increase<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.710> amount<00:01:23.250> of<00:01:23.520> color<00:01:23.940> in

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
can also increase the amount of color in

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.670 
can also increase the amount of color in
each<00:01:24.510> of<00:01:24.690> these<00:01:24.780> areas<00:01:24.960> so<00:01:25.290> I'm<00:01:25.350> going<00:01:25.530> to<00:01:25.560> go

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
each of these areas so I'm going to go

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.250 
each of these areas so I'm going to go
to<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:25.920> sky<00:01:26.280> again<00:01:26.460> I'm<00:01:27.240> going<00:01:27.420> to<00:01:27.510> increase

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:28.260 
to the sky again I'm going to increase

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.740 
to the sky again I'm going to increase
the<00:01:28.620> saturation<00:01:29.000> I'm<00:01:30.000> going<00:01:30.150> to<00:01:30.240> do<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.480> same

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
the saturation I'm going to do the same

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.740 
the saturation I'm going to do the same
with<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.140> building<00:01:31.730> and<00:01:32.730> I'm<00:01:33.420> going<00:01:33.570> to<00:01:33.600> click

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
with the building and I'm going to click

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.080 
with the building and I'm going to click
on<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.050> luminance<00:01:34.530> now<00:01:34.830> and<00:01:35.730> I'm<00:01:35.850> going<00:01:36.030> to

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
on the luminance now and I'm going to

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
on the luminance now and I'm going to
make<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.390> sky<00:01:36.720> a<00:01:36.750> little<00:01:37.350> darker<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:38.550> the

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
make the sky a little darker and the

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.730 
make the sky a little darker and the
building<00:01:40.110> just<00:01:40.380> a<00:01:40.650> little<00:01:40.920> brighter<00:01:42.170> ok<00:01:43.170> so

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
building just a little brighter ok so

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.670 
building just a little brighter ok so
the<00:01:44.730> luminance<00:01:45.150> controls<00:01:45.690> the<00:01:45.930> lightness<00:01:46.470> or

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
the luminance controls the lightness or

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.649 
the luminance controls the lightness or
the<00:01:47.250> darkness<00:01:47.880> and<00:01:48.950> the<00:01:49.950> saturation<00:01:50.850> controls

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
the darkness and the saturation controls

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.620 
the darkness and the saturation controls
the<00:01:52.170> amount<00:01:52.530> of<00:01:52.740> color<00:01:53.159> within<00:01:54.060> that<00:01:54.990> area<00:01:55.200> and

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
the amount of color within that area and

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.140 
the amount of color within that area and
the<00:01:57.630> hue<00:01:57.960> is<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.770> actual<00:01:59.159> color<00:01:59.520> itself<00:01:59.909> we

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:00.150 
the hue is the actual color itself we

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:04.760 
the hue is the actual color itself we
can<00:02:00.330> do<00:02:00.510> a<00:02:00.540> huge<00:02:00.930> shift<00:02:02.659> like<00:02:03.659> so<00:02:03.930> now<00:02:04.590> if<00:02:04.680> we

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
can do a huge shift like so now if we

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.880 
can do a huge shift like so now if we
combine<00:02:05.250> this<00:02:05.610> with<00:02:05.909> the<00:02:06.810> temperature<00:02:07.560> slider

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
combine this with the temperature slider

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.720 
combine this with the temperature slider
which<00:02:08.640> will<00:02:08.849> also<00:02:09.060> adjust<00:02:09.659> the<00:02:09.989> colors<00:02:10.430> we<00:02:11.430> can

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
which will also adjust the colors we can

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.369 
which will also adjust the colors we can
it<00:02:12.299> get<00:02:12.629> some<00:02:12.840> really<00:02:13.080> interesting<00:02:15.379> effects

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:16.379 
it get some really interesting effects

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:18.500 
it get some really interesting effects
going<00:02:16.680> on<00:02:16.860> here<00:02:17.129> so<00:02:17.730> because<00:02:18.000> I've<00:02:18.150> made<00:02:18.360> the

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
going on here so because I've made the

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.130 
going on here so because I've made the
image<00:02:18.750> very<00:02:19.019> cool<00:02:19.379> it's<00:02:20.100> affected<00:02:20.700> both<00:02:21.140> parts

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
image very cool it's affected both parts

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.950 
image very cool it's affected both parts
of<00:02:22.350> the<00:02:22.770> image<00:02:22.920> the<00:02:23.190> sky<00:02:23.520> and<00:02:23.760> the<00:02:23.790> building

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 
of the image the sky and the building

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.750 
of the image the sky and the building
the<00:02:25.170> opposite<00:02:25.680> way<00:02:25.860> we'll<00:02:26.250> get<00:02:26.430> a<00:02:26.490> different

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
the opposite way we'll get a different

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.380 
the opposite way we'll get a different
look<00:02:27.000> and<00:02:27.830> again<00:02:28.830> if<00:02:29.070> we<00:02:29.100> combine<00:02:29.730> that<00:02:30.090> with

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
look and again if we combine that with

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.730 
look and again if we combine that with
the<00:02:30.600> tint<00:02:31.880> we<00:02:32.880> can<00:02:33.090> also<00:02:33.300> adjust<00:02:33.750> the<00:02:34.350> colors

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
the tint we can also adjust the colors

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:38.570 
the tint we can also adjust the colors
and<00:02:35.010> and<00:02:35.880> get<00:02:36.450> some<00:02:37.080> quite<00:02:37.410> interesting<00:02:37.950> looks

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
and and get some quite interesting looks

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:44.050 
and and get some quite interesting looks
I<00:02:40.700> quite<00:02:41.700> like<00:02:42.060> the<00:02:42.240> way<00:02:42.360> that's<00:02:42.660> working<00:02:43.260> I

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
I quite like the way that's working I

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.880 
I quite like the way that's working I
think<00:02:45.060> I'll<00:02:45.210> just<00:02:45.240> boost<00:02:46.080> the<00:02:46.290> overall

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
think I'll just boost the overall

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:52.610 
think I'll just boost the overall
saturation<00:02:47.820> here<00:02:48.560> and<00:02:50.180> there<00:02:51.180> we<00:02:51.300> go<00:02:51.480> em<00:02:51.720> let's

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
saturation here and there we go em let's

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.470 
saturation here and there we go em let's
look<00:02:52.770> at<00:02:52.920> before<00:02:53.100> and<00:02:54.260> after<00:02:56.000> let's<00:02:57.000> look<00:02:57.330> at

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
look at before and after let's look at

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.440 
look at before and after let's look at
the<00:02:57.570> split-screen<00:02:58.110> of<00:02:58.470> that<00:02:59.030> you<00:03:00.030> can<00:03:00.180> see<00:03:00.330> we

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
the split-screen of that you can see we

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.760 
the split-screen of that you can see we
made<00:03:00.600> some<00:03:00.780> quite<00:03:00.990> drastic<00:03:01.560> changes<00:03:02.070> and<00:03:02.340> and

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:03.770 
made some quite drastic changes and and

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:07.340 
made some quite drastic changes and and
very<00:03:04.770> easily<00:03:05.040> just<00:03:05.970> using<00:03:06.270> the<00:03:06.330> hsl<00:03:06.930> command

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
very easily just using the hsl command

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.620 
very easily just using the hsl command
here
