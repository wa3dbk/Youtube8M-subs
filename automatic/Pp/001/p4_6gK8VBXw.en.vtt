main reason I wanted to use it is on a
Windows<00:00:22.650> 8<00:00:22.859> machine<00:00:22.890> and<00:00:24.019> if<00:00:25.019> you<00:00:25.199> look<00:00:25.380> at<00:00:25.500> the

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
Windows 8 machine and if you look at the

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.050 
Windows 8 machine and if you look at the
specs<00:00:27.830> over<00:00:28.830> here<00:00:28.980> at<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.189> top<00:00:29.429> it<00:00:29.789> doesn't

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
specs over here at the top it doesn't

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.319 
specs over here at the top it doesn't
mention<00:00:30.330> anything<00:00:30.689> about<00:00:30.810> Windows<00:00:31.410> 8

00:00:32.319 --> 00:00:32.329 
mention anything about Windows 8

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:34.940

compliance<00:00:33.329> it<00:00:33.570> just<00:00:33.750> says<00:00:33.989> it's<00:00:34.260> usable<00:00:34.890> in

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
compliance it just says it's usable in

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.360 
compliance it just says it's usable in
Windows<00:00:35.219> 7<00:00:35.899> so<00:00:36.899> that's<00:00:37.079> one<00:00:37.620> of<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.800> reasons

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
Windows 7 so that's one of the reasons

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.400 
Windows 7 so that's one of the reasons
why<00:00:38.489> I<00:00:38.520> wanted<00:00:38.879> to<00:00:39.000> give<00:00:39.149> it<00:00:39.180> a<00:00:39.390> try<00:00:39.899> to<00:00:39.960> see<00:00:40.110> how

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
why I wanted to give it a try to see how

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.900 
why I wanted to give it a try to see how
well<00:00:40.590> it<00:00:40.770> works<00:00:40.920> but<00:00:41.160> as<00:00:41.399> you<00:00:41.550> can<00:00:41.640> see<00:00:41.760> it's

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
well it works but as you can see it's

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.750 
well it works but as you can see it's
well<00:00:42.090> packaged<00:00:42.920> it's<00:00:43.920> in<00:00:44.040> shrink<00:00:44.309> wrap<00:00:44.399> which

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
well packaged it's in shrink wrap which

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.520 
well packaged it's in shrink wrap which
obviously<00:00:45.059> anyone<00:00:45.600> could<00:00:45.750> put<00:00:45.870> shrink<00:00:46.350> wrap

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
obviously anyone could put shrink wrap

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.240 
obviously anyone could put shrink wrap
on<00:00:46.739> to<00:00:46.950> so<00:00:47.340> I'm<00:00:47.670> gonna<00:00:47.760> open<00:00:48.739> it<00:00:49.739> up<00:00:49.829> and<00:00:50.039> we're

gonna<00:00:50.340> give<00:00:50.550> it<00:00:50.579> a<00:00:50.760> try<00:00:50.910> to<00:00:51.000> see<00:00:51.120> if<00:00:51.300> it<00:00:51.360> works

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
gonna give it a try to see if it works

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.090 
gonna give it a try to see if it works
on<00:00:51.690> Windows<00:00:51.750> 8<00:00:52.699> it's<00:00:53.699> too<00:00:53.850> bad<00:00:54.030> I<00:00:54.059> can't<00:00:54.210> test

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:55.100

gonna turn for a second while I post in
the<00:02:42.630> wireless<00:02:42.840> look<00:02:43.260> key<00:02:43.560> I'll<00:02:44.280> come<00:02:44.519> back

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
the wireless look key I'll come back

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:56.920 
the wireless look key I'll come back
after<00:02:45.000> I<00:02:45.180> do<00:02:45.450> that

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.240 

so<00:02:57.930> now<00:02:58.319> it's<00:02:58.680> logging<00:02:59.400> on<00:02:59.519> to<00:02:59.550> the<00:02:59.849> wireless

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
so now it's logging on to the wireless

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:04.820 
so now it's logging on to the wireless
let's<00:03:02.250> see<00:03:02.430> if<00:03:02.489> it<00:03:02.610> has<00:03:02.760> any<00:03:02.790> problems<00:03:03.569> and<00:03:04.260> I

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
let's see if it has any problems and I

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:10.729 
let's see if it has any problems and I
am<00:03:04.980> connected<00:03:05.610> so<00:03:06.349> long<00:03:07.349> story<00:03:07.769> short<00:03:09.739> it

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
am connected so long story short it

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:17.720 
am connected so long story short it
looks<00:03:11.069> like<00:03:14.660> that<00:03:15.660> this<00:03:16.129> wireless<00:03:17.129> adapter

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
looks like that this wireless adapter

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:22.339 
looks like that this wireless adapter
installs<00:03:18.390> on<00:03:20.000> Windows<00:03:21.000> 8<00:03:21.269> just<00:03:21.569> fine<00:03:21.840> I'm<00:03:22.200> just

00:03:22.339 --> 00:03:22.349 
installs on Windows 8 just fine I'm just

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:29.000 
installs on Windows 8 just fine I'm just
trying<00:03:22.590> to<00:03:22.680> go<00:03:22.890> onto<00:03:23.040> a<00:03:23.220> website<00:03:23.519> right<00:03:24.030> now<00:03:28.010> my

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
trying to go onto a website right now my

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:33.050 
trying to go onto a website right now my
laptops<00:03:29.670> will<00:03:29.849> go<00:03:29.970> slow<00:03:31.730> again<00:03:32.730> this<00:03:32.849> is

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
laptops will go slow again this is

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:34.849 
laptops will go slow again this is
Windows<00:03:33.420> 8<00:03:33.599> so<00:03:34.049> if<00:03:34.140> you're<00:03:34.290> curious<00:03:34.470> if<00:03:34.829> it

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:34.859 
Windows 8 so if you're curious if it

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:39.890 
Windows 8 so if you're curious if it
runs<00:03:35.099> on<00:03:35.280> when<00:03:35.459> I<00:03:35.519> was<00:03:35.640> 8<00:03:35.790> it<00:03:36.030> does<00:03:37.609> and<00:03:38.609> so<00:03:39.480> it

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
runs on when I was 8 it does and so it

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:47.330 
runs on when I was 8 it does and so it
looks<00:03:40.109> like<00:03:42.079> just<00:03:43.079> I<00:03:45.560> guess<00:03:46.560> the<00:03:46.709> next<00:03:47.010> test<00:03:47.190> I

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
looks like just I guess the next test I

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.059 
looks like just I guess the next test I
could<00:03:47.519> do<00:03:47.670> is<00:03:47.910> a<00:03:48.359> range<00:03:49.019> test<00:03:49.500> I'm<00:03:49.739> right<00:03:49.890> next

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:50.069 
could do is a range test I'm right next

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:52.190 
could do is a range test I'm right next
to<00:03:50.250> the<00:03:50.370> router<00:03:50.609> right<00:03:50.940> now<00:03:51.150> so<00:03:51.540> it's<00:03:51.690> not<00:03:51.959> much

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
to the router right now so it's not much

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.430 
to the router right now so it's not much
of<00:03:52.230> an<00:03:52.560> impressive<00:03:53.129> study
