your apps but I found that this is the
best<00:00:55.870> one<00:00:56.170> so<00:00:56.440> you<00:00:56.500> take<00:00:56.710> it<00:00:56.920> and<00:00:57.070> then<00:00:57.550> it

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:57.640 
best one so you take it and then it

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.370 
best one so you take it and then it
shows<00:00:57.790> you<00:00:57.970> all<00:00:58.180> your<00:00:58.210> apps<00:00:58.570> and<00:00:58.840> they<00:00:58.930> just<00:00:59.140> if

you want it locked you just you know

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:02.850 
you want it locked you just you know
switch<00:01:01.329> this<00:01:01.570> like<00:01:02.050> that<00:01:02.290> and<00:01:02.500> now<00:01:02.680> it's

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:02.860 
switch this like that and now it's

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.130 
switch this like that and now it's
locked<00:01:03.130> I'll<00:01:03.850> just<00:01:04.059> keep<00:01:04.239> that<00:01:04.420> off<00:01:04.570> add<00:01:04.870> these

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:05.140 
locked I'll just keep that off add these

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.710 
locked I'll just keep that off add these
apps<00:01:05.409> over<00:01:05.710> here<00:01:05.830> locked<00:01:06.100> and<00:01:06.430> if<00:01:07.150> you<00:01:07.420> give<00:01:07.600> it

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:07.720 
apps over here locked and if you give it

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.690 
apps over here locked and if you give it
to<00:01:07.840> someone<00:01:08.229> and<00:01:08.409> then<00:01:08.590> they<00:01:08.830> see<00:01:09.130> that<00:01:09.310> slack

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:09.700 
to someone and then they see that slack

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.969 
to someone and then they see that slack
on<00:01:09.909> most<00:01:10.330> adblock<00:01:10.960> application<00:01:11.650> they<00:01:11.800> can

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:11.979 
on most adblock application they can

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:14.100 
on most adblock application they can
just<00:01:12.220> go<00:01:12.370> through<00:01:12.640> the<00:01:12.760> applications<00:01:13.690> like

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.110 
just go through the applications like

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:15.690 
just go through the applications like
your<00:01:14.350> test<00:01:14.590> manager<00:01:15.070> and<00:01:15.220> then<00:01:15.340> they<00:01:15.520> can

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:15.700 
your test manager and then they can

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.850 
your test manager and then they can
understand<00:01:16.210> adblock<00:01:16.840> app<00:01:17.140> and<00:01:17.409> they<00:01:17.590> can<00:01:17.710> go

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:17.860 
understand adblock app and they can go

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:19.289 
understand adblock app and they can go
through<00:01:18.040> your<00:01:18.100> stuff<00:01:18.159> if<00:01:18.549> you<00:01:18.640> go<00:01:18.760> to<00:01:18.790> advanced
