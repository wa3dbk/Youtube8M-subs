00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:15.900
 Good people, how are you doing? 

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:18.960
 we are about to make another video this time a 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:23.360
 very good simple theme so it's going 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:26.030
 to come well to those who are beginners 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.950
 all the tutorials that I do the truth 

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:29.900
 they are not for beginners they are 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:31.880
 always oriented for um 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:34.700
 for an audience that already knows a lot 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.350
 the keyboard then there are many people that 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.920
 he gets angry that I explain very fast and that 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:41.559
 I hope good keep in mind that no 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:44.019
 my idea is to make tutorials for 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:45.730
 most advanced people the songs that 

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:47.500
 I explain are 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.040
 they are quite difficult sometimes for a 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:52.020
 beginner so no 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.120
 sometimes they can be impossible 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.560
 play certain songs for the 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.800
 beginners that I always recommend 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:03.390
 go to study first with a teacher 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:06.780
 that he was going to know how to give songs to 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:09.900
 for it then well this temita me 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.659
 I'm going to leave a bit of the outline that is going to 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.210
 be easy 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:17.179
 on the theme of hall effect bread and 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:22.420
 butter has four or five shades 

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:22.420
 nothing else and it's pretty easy to start like this 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:29.860
 It has been very fun 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:32.610
 still very old 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.610
 yes 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:46.470
 it's just the chords they carry in 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:46.470
 almost the entire song 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:53.020
 to accompany him with these means I do not know 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:56.070
 ok what pace is it but it's kind cumbia is 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.070
 you can accompany half 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:17.970
 the chords are always those 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:22.850
 B flat major invested in the most 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:26.140
 famous the minor 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:28.510
 and my greatest love 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:31.680
 those are the chords that takes you all 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.680
 the theme always does the same 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.680
 i 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:44.500
 until the part that up to the part that 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:46.569
 says four pimples has my bed that 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.480
 part yes 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:52.110
 if other tones go like this they are the same 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:57.020
 but different 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:57.020
 different order almost access to the minor 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:02.740
 B flat 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:05.430
 Y 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:05.430
 B flat major 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.530
 so they just come back again 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:19.200
 there makes a sustained sun minor greater 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.890
 I'm going 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.890
 farc 

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:27.010
 that's 

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:29.450
 in the part is someone who would come to be 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:33.310
 the bridge of the song 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:33.310
 we said minor sun 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.379
 Sun 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:56.370
 my love 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.370
 ah 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:04.930
 then that 's all it has no more than 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:07.120
 that 's pretty short the tutorial well 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:09.880
 simple record is the accompaniment of 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:12.370
 kind if they do cumbia type for is what 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:14.130
 easier to shoot by pulling for the 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:17.330
 who are beginners 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:17.330
 well we hope it has helped 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:20.820
