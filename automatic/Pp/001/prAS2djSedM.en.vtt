00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
going to fade over time this is because

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.179 
going to fade over time this is because
the<00:00:23.789> molecules<00:00:24.330> of<00:00:24.539> the<00:00:24.570> ink<00:00:24.840> are<00:00:25.260> generally

generally<00:00:34.559> on<00:00:34.680> a<00:00:34.710> tattoo<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.399> best<00:00:35.610> way<00:00:35.760> to

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
generally on a tattoo the best way to

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.180 
generally on a tattoo the best way to
take<00:00:36.030> care<00:00:36.329> of<00:00:36.360> it<00:00:36.630> is<00:00:36.780> to<00:00:37.649> use<00:00:37.829> a<00:00:37.860> lightweight

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
take care of it is to use a lightweight

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.240 
take care of it is to use a lightweight
hand<00:00:38.579> lotion<00:00:38.969> on<00:00:39.090> it<00:00:39.270> about<00:00:39.840> once<00:00:40.079> a<00:00:40.260> day<00:00:40.290> if

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
hand lotion on it about once a day if

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.400 
hand lotion on it about once a day if
that's<00:00:41.579> a2<00:00:42.059> is<00:00:42.210> in<00:00:42.360> an<00:00:42.450> area<00:00:42.780> that's<00:00:42.930> exposed

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
that's a2 is in an area that's exposed

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.190 
that's a2 is in an area that's exposed
to<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:43.680> Sun<00:00:43.980> or<00:00:44.219> elements<00:00:44.850> like<00:00:45.030> wind<00:00:45.390> then

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
to the Sun or elements like wind then

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.410 
to the Sun or elements like wind then
it's<00:00:46.379> a<00:00:46.469> good<00:00:46.649> idea<00:00:46.800> to<00:00:47.070> perhaps<00:00:47.370> cover<00:00:47.879> it<00:00:48.090> or

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
it's a good idea to perhaps cover it or

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.060 
it's a good idea to perhaps cover it or
use<00:00:48.960> sunblock<00:00:49.260> on<00:00:49.500> it

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
use sunblock on it

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.430 
use sunblock on it
I<00:00:50.100> generally<00:00:50.700> suggest<00:00:51.270> to<00:00:51.420> my<00:00:51.570> customers<00:00:52.079> that

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
I generally suggest to my customers that

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.819 
I generally suggest to my customers that
they<00:00:52.649> use<00:00:52.860> at<00:00:53.070> least<00:00:53.250> an<00:00:53.489> SPF<00:00:53.760> of<00:00:54.360> 50<00:00:54.870> over<00:00:55.590> any

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
they use at least an SPF of 50 over any

they use at least an SPF of 50 over any
tattoos<00:00:56.309> they<00:00:56.550> have<00:00:56.789> particularly<00:00:57.750> because

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
the tattoo that perhaps your father or

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.940 
the tattoo that perhaps your father or
your<00:01:15.180> grandfather<00:01:15.240> has<00:01:15.930> it<00:01:16.500> doesn't<00:01:16.799> look

your grandfather has it doesn't look
quite<00:01:17.100> as<00:01:17.369> good<00:01:17.549> as<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.790> one<00:01:17.939> that<00:01:18.090> you<00:01:18.180> got

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
quite as good as the one that you got

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.570 
quite as good as the one that you got
just<00:01:18.659> last<00:01:18.900> year<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.770> reason<00:01:20.040> for<00:01:20.220> that<00:01:20.340> is

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
just last year the reason for that is

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.320 
just last year the reason for that is
most<00:01:20.790> tattoos<00:01:21.240> will<00:01:21.509> spread<00:01:21.869> about<00:01:22.200> 10%<00:01:23.070> of

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330 
most tattoos will spread about 10% of

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.600 
most tattoos will spread about 10% of
their<00:01:24.330> space<00:01:24.750> for<00:01:25.530> every<00:01:25.860> year<00:01:26.220> that<00:01:26.369> you<00:01:26.400> had

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
their space for every year that you had

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.149 
their space for every year that you had
the<00:01:26.759> tattoo<00:01:27.180> so<00:01:27.810> it's<00:01:27.990> easy<00:01:28.439> to<00:01:28.680> understand

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
the tattoo so it's easy to understand

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.100 
the tattoo so it's easy to understand
why<00:01:29.430> that<00:01:29.670> tattoo<00:01:30.119> may<00:01:30.270> not<00:01:30.450> look<00:01:30.630> quite<00:01:30.930> as

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
why that tattoo may not look quite as

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.350 
why that tattoo may not look quite as
crisps<00:01:31.530> and<00:01:31.650> bright<00:01:31.890> as<00:01:32.040> it<00:01:32.159> used<00:01:32.340> to<00:01:32.460> we
