which will give you some airtime you
better<00:00:48.030> know<00:00:48.270> how<00:00:48.300> to<00:00:48.450> jump<00:00:50.360> when<00:00:51.360> we<00:00:51.449> start<00:00:51.780> to

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
better know how to jump when we start to

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.340 
better know how to jump when we start to
jump<00:00:52.410> take<00:00:52.920> a<00:00:52.949> small<00:00:53.460> little<00:00:53.820> jump<00:00:54.120> get<00:00:55.020> used

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
jump take a small little jump get used

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.920 
jump take a small little jump get used
to<00:00:55.500> getting<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:55.920> wheels<00:00:56.129> into<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.550> air<00:00:56.930> the

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
to getting the wheels into the air the

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.590 
to getting the wheels into the air the
key<00:00:58.199> here<00:00:58.440> is<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.710> approach<00:00:59.160> that<00:00:59.190> you<00:00:59.550> take

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 
key here is the approach that you take

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.840 
key here is the approach that you take
the<00:01:00.600> speed<00:01:00.930> that<00:01:01.109> you<00:01:01.260> take<00:01:01.530> and<00:01:01.890> remain<00:01:02.699> in

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
the speed that you take and remain in

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.119 
the speed that you take and remain in
the<00:01:02.940> center<00:01:03.180> of<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.600> bike<00:01:03.780> also<00:01:04.409> important<00:01:04.920> is

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
the center of the bike also important is

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.000 
the center of the bike also important is
to<00:01:05.309> approach<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.390> jump<00:01:07.140> in<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.710> attack

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
to approach the jump in the attack

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.210 
to approach the jump in the attack
position<00:01:08.460> which<00:01:08.610> means<00:01:08.850> elbows<00:01:09.390> are

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220 
position which means elbows are

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.980 
position which means elbows are
shoulders<00:01:11.220> over<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.490> triple<00:01:11.700> clamp<00:01:12.060> and<00:01:12.330> then

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
shoulders over the triple clamp and then

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.649 
shoulders over the triple clamp and then
to<00:01:13.200> have<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.500> right<00:01:13.650> amount<00:01:13.979> of<00:01:14.070> power

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:14.659 
to have the right amount of power

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:17.060 
to have the right amount of power
there's<00:01:15.659> quite<00:01:15.960> a<00:01:15.990> few<00:01:16.229> ways<00:01:16.350> of<00:01:16.560> doing<00:01:16.680> it<00:01:16.890> one

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
there's quite a few ways of doing it one

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.219 
there's quite a few ways of doing it one
way<00:01:17.220> demonstrated<00:01:18.060> here<00:01:18.210> is<00:01:18.299> a<00:01:18.330> preacher<00:01:18.840> so

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
way demonstrated here is a preacher so

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.770 
way demonstrated here is a preacher so
as<00:01:19.409> a<00:01:19.439> suspension<00:01:19.890> compresses<00:01:20.570> bend<00:01:21.570> the

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
as a suspension compresses bend the

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.310 
as a suspension compresses bend the
knees<00:01:21.990> as<00:01:22.860> it<00:01:23.159> starts<00:01:23.460> lifting<00:01:23.850> up<00:01:24.420> stand<00:01:25.140> up

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
knees as it starts lifting up stand up

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.800 
knees as it starts lifting up stand up
and<00:01:25.590> in<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.430> air<00:01:26.580> what<00:01:26.850> you<00:01:26.970> can<00:01:27.240> do<00:01:27.509> is<00:01:27.659> to

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
and in the air what you can do is to

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.289 
and in the air what you can do is to
bend<00:01:28.140> your<00:01:28.320> knees<00:01:28.619> so<00:01:29.490> that<00:01:29.520> you<00:01:29.700> can<00:01:29.880> reduce

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
bend your knees so that you can reduce

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.920 
bend your knees so that you can reduce
the<00:01:30.840> height<00:01:31.140> that<00:01:31.470> you<00:01:31.619> get<00:01:31.799> out<00:01:32.009> of<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.250> bike

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930 
the height that you get out of the bike

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.300 
the height that you get out of the bike
depending<00:01:33.930> on<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.140> top<00:01:34.320> of<00:01:34.500> landing<00:01:35.009> what<00:01:35.189> we

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
depending on the top of landing what we

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.520 
depending on the top of landing what we
do<00:01:35.520> is<00:01:35.820> relate<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.479> rear<00:01:36.780> wheel<00:01:37.049> and<00:01:37.290> a
