there is not a deck in this game in

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.820 
there is not a deck in this game in

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:46.300 
builds of myrrh males the reason is

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.570 
builds of myrrh males the reason is
because<00:03:46.630> of<00:03:46.990> the<00:03:47.080> massive<00:03:47.470> card<00:03:48.070> pool<00:03:48.340> that

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:48.580 
because of the massive card pool that

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:50.640 
because of the massive card pool that
the<00:03:48.700> deck<00:03:48.880> has<00:03:49.120> there<00:03:49.450> are<00:03:49.660> so<00:03:50.110> many<00:03:50.230> cards

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
the deck has there are so many cards

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.260 
the deck has there are so many cards
that<00:03:50.800> could<00:03:50.860> potentially<00:03:51.400> support<00:03:51.550> mermail

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:52.270 
that could potentially support mermail

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:54.510 
that could potentially support mermail
deck<00:03:52.480> and<00:03:52.690> almost<00:03:53.170> all<00:03:53.650> of<00:03:53.680> them<00:03:54.010> except<00:03:54.310> for<00:03:54.340> a

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:54.520 
deck and almost all of them except for a

very<00:03:54.940> select<00:03:55.450> few<00:03:55.540> are<00:03:55.990> at<00:03:56.500> 3<00:03:56.920> and<00:03:57.130> the<00:03:57.250> choice

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:57.460 
very select few are at 3 and the choice

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:00.210 
very select few are at 3 and the choice
becomes<00:03:57.760> which<00:03:58.510> those<00:03:58.900> are<00:03:59.170> the<00:03:59.410> most<00:03:59.620> optimal

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 
becomes which those are the most optimal

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:02.580 
becomes which those are the most optimal
ones<00:04:00.460> to<00:04:00.640> use<00:04:00.820> in<00:04:01.030> a<00:04:01.120> format<00:04:01.600> you<00:04:02.140> can<00:04:02.350> see

really<00:04:40.600> comes<00:04:40.900> down<00:04:40.990> to<00:04:41.170> what<00:04:41.470> you<00:04:41.620> think

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 
really comes down to what you think

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.260 
really comes down to what you think
you're<00:04:41.980> going<00:04:42.100> to<00:04:42.220> be<00:04:42.340> playing<00:04:42.550> the<00:04:42.760> most<00:04:42.910> in<00:04:43.180> a

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.270 
you're going to be playing the most in a

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:45.360 
you're going to be playing the most in a

day to determine what your deck is going

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:47.550 
day to determine what your deck is going
to<00:04:45.490> look<00:04:45.730> like<00:04:46.000> and<00:04:46.210> that<00:04:46.240> is<00:04:46.780> true<00:04:47.080> in<00:04:47.260> this

game just morels allow you to do that in
a<00:05:05.560> very<00:05:05.800> visible<00:05:06.100> sense<00:05:06.610> you<00:05:07.030> can<00:05:07.210> see<00:05:07.510> when

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:07.810 
a very visible sense you can see when

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:10.050 
a very visible sense you can see when
you<00:05:07.930> play<00:05:08.110> mermouse<00:05:08.530> how<00:05:08.920> the<00:05:08.980> small<00:05:09.460> changes

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:10.060 
you play mermouse how the small changes

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:12.030 
you play mermouse how the small changes
in<00:05:10.120> your<00:05:10.330> ratios<00:05:10.960> have<00:05:11.140> changed<00:05:11.530> the<00:05:11.650> pace<00:05:11.830> and

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:12.040 
in your ratios have changed the pace and

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:13.830 
in your ratios have changed the pace and
the<00:05:12.130> power<00:05:12.310> of<00:05:12.460> the<00:05:12.760> deck<00:05:12.940> as<00:05:13.120> well<00:05:13.330> as<00:05:13.690> the

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:13.840 
the power of the deck as well as the

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:16.050 
the power of the deck as well as the
consistency<00:05:14.650> so<00:05:15.010> I'd<00:05:15.250> recommend<00:05:15.760> that<00:05:15.820> any

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:16.060 
consistency so I'd recommend that any

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:17.880 
consistency so I'd recommend that any
player<00:05:16.390> who<00:05:16.600> wants<00:05:16.750> to<00:05:16.990> become<00:05:17.290> better<00:05:17.530> at<00:05:17.770> the

game play morels at local sometimes it's

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:22.230
