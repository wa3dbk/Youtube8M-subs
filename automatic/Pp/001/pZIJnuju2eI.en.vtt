00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:12.249
 but what was he doing 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:12.249
 [Applause] 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:26.189
 [Music] 

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:26.189
 what to change 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:34.770
 despair comes back and then there was talk 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:34.770
 a lot explains he was 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:50.550
 during the mass miguel let glimpse that 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.550
 put the holder by coco 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.410
 so I do not think so 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:59.080
 stuck in the head breaks the line of 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:01.180
 four immediately or the first one 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:04.000
 I made a goal or received a goal, I think there 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.019
 fails him does not incorporate to from a 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.729
 beginning 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:15.219
 is right this says like a change 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:17.740
 Miguel and the party in the departure of 

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:20.890
 minutes in the field there you realize 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:24.039
 which are signs, more than the lions 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:25.899
 it's already improvised it's pillows 

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:27.759
 see what we do I think that's where 

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:30.310
 Miguel Stone and the party in the friend 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:32.829
 beto today the start of part is 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:37.450
 equal to the final with blue cross and what 

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:49.329
 I used to say four but it is again 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:51.549
 same believing that lion's carbon 

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:53.349
 played very well today to see lion finish the 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:55.720
 last party by line five in the 

00:01:53.349 --> 00:01:58.450
 start the game again you have five 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.899
 Chinese the lion has been exceptional of the 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:00.899
 exit 

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:09.479
 with the intelligence the gentleman that 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.500
 I had to have had Miguel and you know that 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.750
 he did not have it 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.720
 that is, it was much braver more things and 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.040
 it was much bolder for the final was the 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.629
 technical although the technician the mer and 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:23.090
 also games for desperation of the 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:23.090
 video is playing with despair 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:35.299
 desperately to have the ball the 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:35.299
 lion started playing minutes 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.930
 I believe that America started with a 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.500
 total excitement in the final 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.500
 visions 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.800
 against the champion this man who 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:05.410
 ascended with the lion 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:05.410
 for me it was an honor because 3 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.990
 I do not know why but I was sitting in the 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.640
 harrow 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:20.230
 [Music] 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.910
 as the worst decisions that have the 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.920
 We want our directive in a 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.720
 previous 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.220
 Lion has already surpassed Monterrey 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:31.120
 pachuca his brother team the multi 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:33.690
 own property when we adjust 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.690
 Title 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
 pachuca
