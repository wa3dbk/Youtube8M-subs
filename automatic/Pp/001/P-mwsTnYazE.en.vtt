00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:15.769
 good friends we are back here in 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:20.029
 the garage we are going to talk now about 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:25.759
 mercedes benz glk 2015 is the new 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:29.540
 mercedes crossover and the intention of 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:31.640
 the brand or when people see it or know 

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:34.040
 that exists says good then it 's the 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:37.790
 new small truck of mercedes 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:40.129
 benz but look, look at those three cars 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:42.379
 look at them from that distance where 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:45.710
 they are and they are going to see that it is practically 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:49.250
 the same height we have between the 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:51.680
 volkswagen golf the seat lion and the 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.240
 mercedes or which of the three is 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.680
 truck none of the three is 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:58.120
 trucks feeling that there are many people 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.120
 in Mexico that 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.750
 believe that when you have a box the 

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:04.519
 defined with being about two volumes already 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.280
 it's a truck that's why some say 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:11.150
 golf when in my opinion it is a mistake 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:15.080
 it's a hatchback it 's golf in the end 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:17.240
 from everyone then that to me or that 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:20.840
 for me in the first disappointment that 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:23.690
 I have in relation to the jelly we are going to 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:26.330
 say it because if at least the 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:28.159
 Mercedes intention when doing this 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.229
 vehicle was to create a van we're going 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:33.940
 let's treat it in the feminine the 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:36.340
 Design is not a design for anyone 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:38.290
 we respect it because we see the great 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:43.540
 three-pointed star on the grill 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:45.370
 in the chest on the wheels and we know that 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:47.290
 it's a mercedes benz and that deserves 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:52.510
 obviously all the respect of all the 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:56.110
 world of automobiles however the 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:57.520
 second exception begins when you enter 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.470
 in the car what I then do in a 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.650
 this is the most 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:05.140
 equipped and most powerful of the people to the 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:08.380
 that he has given 50 has traction at 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:10.990
 four wheels and it also has an engine 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:14.110
 two liter four-cylinder turbo with 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:17.800
 211 horses already guess the same 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:20.520
 cl engine and the same class engine 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:23.410
 who shares a platform 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:26.290
 infinite also beats back is going to have a 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:29.320
 car with the jelly platform in a 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:31.570
 not too distant future and it's going to be 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:33.340
 manufactured here in me that is not 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:36.040
 official that those cars are going 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.840
 to be made but I think that if they go to 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.680
 do that now let's see inside 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.600
 of the car 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.920
 we see open and see the door 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:47.610
 here we have Mercedes DÃ­az well 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:49.470
 good a good door lining memories 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:52.050
 for seats seats 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:54.599
 traditional electric and so on 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:58.250
 here we are pretty good too 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:58.250
 door trim we sit 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:05.330
 already confirmed the first disappointment 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:08.750
 we see from the outside height I see 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:10.519
 pain through the crystal of golf 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.260
 transparency of golf and I feel that this 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:14.540
 car is in fact even shorter than 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.670
 golf when I see it for it is not it 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.799
 a little bit taller a few centimeters 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:21.680
 less than 10 centimeters higher in 

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:23.540
 Europe is talking about a version soon 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.360
 with a suspension 10 centimeters more 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:29.599
 high that is a mercedes mexico please 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:31.819
 bring the jelly with that suspension more 

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:33.230
 high because of the potholes and so that people 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:35.599
 feel that you have finally a 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:37.760
 truck I swear that if they bring it 

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:40.730
 they will measure better than what is 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:44.860
 selling the fight in these moments 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:47.310
 now we see the materials 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:49.870
 this is fine the plastic has cooked 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.760
 Etc. Seams appears in red color 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:54.760
 the steering wheel looks pretty good 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:57.910
 functions this plastic can not see anything 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:00.730
 bad feels good the ball is lined 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:03.010
 of skin is also fine but this 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:05.500
 plastic it seems to me that it is not worthy of 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:08.680
 mercedes seems to me one more plastic 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:11.560
 cheap of what should be the same 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:15.340
 feeling happens to me with these 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:17.980
 compartments I feel that it's plastic 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:20.980
 that covers them does not have the quality that 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:22.730
 We would expect from a Mercedes Benz we rotated 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:24.090
 the key 

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:26.960
 Y 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:26.960
 we see 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:33.090
 the strongest team in the broth of 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:35.340
 mercedes benz s right now because this is 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:39.810
 as I said the most equipped version 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:42.570
 of the jelly and 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:44.850
 we have two or three ambient light 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:46.440
 details is quite interesting but to 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:48.389
 the time you walk there are two or three 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.830
 weird things for example this lever what 

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:52.290
 normal is that here you have the 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:53.760
 Directional or cleaners 

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:55.980
 windshield or the two things a 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:58.950
 lever for one or the other or a 

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:00.480
 lever for a and that you turn to put 

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:03.030
 the directional but this is not the 

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:04.500
 shifter and very 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:06.810
 often we are driving and we 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:09.030
 We are wrong and we have to take a while 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:12.360
 in accustomed with that if the owner 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:14.550
 let's say normal of the car is going to happen a 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:16.800
 time with that and more or less it's going to 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:19.590
 accustom but for us we give 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:21.120
 changing cars every time is a bit 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:24.720
 complicated the directionals are of the 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:26.490
 other side and also the cleaners 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:28.880
 windshield we have here from the 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:31.950
 left and we have to turn to 

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:34.620
 trigger the then there are already the 

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:37.020
 we have a panoramic roof 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:39.720
 also covered with the mesh that I do not 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:42.870
 I like it a lot and I find it strange that 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:45.570
 roof has a division between the part 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:46.650
 back and front when we see by 

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:49.199
 example on the ball 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:51.660
 8 the full roof in 2008 the roof 

00:05:49.199 --> 00:05:54.889
 complete and because you can not have a 

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:54.889
 full roof in this mercedes 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:02.090
 the march is to walk with the 

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:04.810
 truck is not as nice as 

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:10.100
 it should be or how would we think it was 

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:10.640
 because it is a harder than it is 

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:13.970
 should 

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:18.200
 There are many interior noises and no 

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:20.000
 accelerates so well of the three of the three 

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:23.420
 cars that we have here this is the most 

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:26.180
 slow from 0 to 108 point 5 seconds say 

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:29.180
 well this has 211 horses the cupra 

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:31.850
 he did in 7.1 seconds but he has forgiveness 

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:35.330
 in 6.1 seconds but it has 265 horses 

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:37.310
 so what do they tell me about golf 

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:40.610
 only 140 horses managed in the 

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:43.250
 holding 7.2 seconds that is 1.2 

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:46.570
 1.3 seconds faster than is that 

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:46.570
 has 211 horses 

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:52.099
 anyway 

00:06:48.889 --> 00:06:53.930
 it will be very mercedes benz but it is not worthy 

00:06:52.099 --> 00:06:56.389
 to use the word mercedes benz is not 

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:58.550
 worthy in my opinion to use the star 

00:06:56.389 --> 00:07:01.420
 three-pronged 

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:05.120
 and I'm very sorry to say but it's a 

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:07.340
 mercedes that I would never buy and not 

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:09.530
 I think it will be recommending anyone 

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:12.350
 needs to evolve a lot this 

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:16.310
 truck before it becomes a 

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:18.080
 product really worth it to be of 

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:20.300
 that bought and much more than that 

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:22.639
 recommend 

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:25.909
 I repeat, Mercedes is going to feel pride 

00:07:22.639 --> 00:07:27.379
 to walk in one but until there are finished 

00:07:25.909 --> 00:07:29.960
 practically its advantages 

00:07:27.379 --> 00:07:35.830
 we go to a cut and come back with the 

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:35.830
 volkswagen golf 2015 made in mexico 

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.800
 in safe we ââhave the spare parts 

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:54.800
 Original Mercedes Benz Audi Bn W 

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:59.020
 force volvo jaguar mini cooper and land 

00:07:54.800 --> 00:08:01.940
 rover for engine cooling system 

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:04.670
 suspension and many more now also 

00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:07.600
 with that more of the toyota in 6 the 

00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:07.600
 parts are so original
