00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.590
 people 

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:08.559
 hello today is to represent how to make a 

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:10.450
 cheesecake with strawberries or strawberries 

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:13.030
 you can use any type of fruits 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:14.230
 reds are these desserts that like to 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:16.150
 all the world 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:18.279
 we will use some cookies them 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:20.100
 we have already crushed you are a type 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:22.320
 digestive and if not type maria 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.790
 we will use a little butter 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.880
 we have yogurt you can use some 

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:29.470
 cheese type quarter cottage cheese 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.840
 We have white spreadable cheese 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:34.260
 philadelphia and in this case we have some 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.810
 strawberries a few pressures cut 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:40.180
 we will use condensed milk the milk 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:41.560
 and some jelly leaves a little bit of 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.930
 lemon and here we have all the 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:47.500
 ingredients the base we are going to make 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:49.570
 chopped cookie that we discounted the 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:52.600
 crushed are about 200 grams and we throw 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:55.050
 what is melted butter open the 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.050
 Butter 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.420
 this is a cracker base that is very 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:04.680
 practice because it's very quick to do 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:06.810
 and it works for many cake bases 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.909
 I mix it well 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.430
 so that the cookie meets the 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.700
 butter when the butter takes 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.640
 temperature 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:20.240
 and it cools then it curds well and 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.979
 we have the good foundation we have it ready 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.140
 I have a mold that I have put a 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:30.159
 little film paper to make it more 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:33.490
 easy to unmold pour the cookie 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:37.799
 and now I'm going to distribute it all over the 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.799
 base pressing to make it hard 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:44.120
 we cover the sides well 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.580
 and now we reserve it we could leave in 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:48.920
 the fridge but as it carries gelatin and 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:51.960
 you need time in the fridge because 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:54.420
 take the board the problem 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.250
 is ready and I reserve it now I am going to 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:01.470
 prepare what is the base of the cake 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:04.110
 I'm going to put the cheese, add the yogurt 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:06.540
 and we'll put the condensed milk in this 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.490
 case we will use half a drop of milk 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.940
 condensed what will be the sweetness 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:13.690
 of the cheesecake so we saved ourselves in 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:18.300
 add sugar 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.300
 the mustache and mix it well 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.319
 I already have it well mixed 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:29.020
 sprinkle the strawberries with a little 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.020
 lemon and we will add them 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.900
 we inflate a little bit, you can use 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:40.140
 any kind of red fruits 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:41.940
 you were blueberries blueberries or strawberries 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:45.069
 you can even mix them use everything 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:47.709
 type forest fruits 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:49.960
 now we will continue with the gelatin are 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:52.810
 the hard leaves 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:55.060
 in this case they are 5 sheets and we are going to 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.590
 hydrate with a little water we leave them 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:00.250
 in cold water about 10 minutes 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:02.200
 approximately and you will see how they swell 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.600
 well as you can see I have the gelatin 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.180
 hydrated you see that it was a rigid sheet and 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:09.350
 now it 's squishy wring it's a 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.240
 little hot 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:13.430
 as in a saucepan with the same water a 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:15.920
 little bit of water that you already have and I'm going to 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:18.170
 melt it is not convenient to boil 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.270
 it has to be melted but on fire 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:25.120
 short and not to serve because he loses 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:25.120
 properties I'm melting you see 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:31.590
 I have the jello ready if you have left 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:34.080
 granites it is convenient to strain the in this 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.860
 case is very good but while it is that 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:36.660
 there are lumps 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:40.210
 you have to strain it would be very unpleasant 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:42.250
 find pieces of gelatin in the pie 

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:44.050
 I used about 5 sheets because 'the 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.490
 country 'a big cake is a cake for 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:48.590
 8 10 12 people 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:50.960
 depending on the amount of filling 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:52.640
 then we will use more leaves or less in 

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:54.580
 The packaging usually indicates the quantity 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:57.690
 that has to be used 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:57.690
 I mix it well 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:03.250
 and let's see it in the order 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:05.710
 this we have to set in the fridge 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:07.450
 approximately about 4 hours 45 hours 

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:10.420
 at least if you can do it one day 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:12.220
 for another much better is ready to the 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:15.130
 fridge 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:17.239
 we have the cake ready you have already set 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:18.769
 perfectly 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:21.739
 Now I 'm going to pass the tip of a 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:24.850
 knife to take it off 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:27.870
 let's do the whole edge 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:27.870
 does not respond to 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:34.120
 Look what looks great with a cookie 

00:04:30.759 --> 00:04:36.490
 the cheese and the strawberries we're going to decorate it 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:39.250
 a little bit you can even fill it with 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:41.800
 strawberries a little jam this to 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:44.790
 your imagination 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:46.890
 and a little bit the mind 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:49.370
 we will help ourselves a little with the zinc paper 

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:49.370
 that we have put 

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:54.790
 the little trick 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:04.270
 that we 

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:09.500
 at ease with life is to enjoy those 

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:09.500
 moments with friends 

00:05:21.169 --> 00:05:24.219
 or not
