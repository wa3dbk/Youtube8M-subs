in Helsinki Finland which is really
interesting<00:01:12.280> not<00:01:12.429> very<00:01:12.700> many<00:01:12.909> watches<00:01:13.329> come

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:13.450 
interesting not very many watches come

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:15.239 
interesting not very many watches come
out<00:01:13.569> of<00:01:13.659> Helsinki<00:01:14.139> or<00:01:14.289> Finland<00:01:14.979> for<00:01:15.130> that

00:01:15.239 --> 00:01:15.249 
out of Helsinki or Finland for that

00:01:15.249 --> 00:01:17.669 
out of Helsinki or Finland for that
matter<00:01:15.420> inside<00:01:16.420> we<00:01:16.600> have<00:01:16.689> a<00:01:16.719> soap<00:01:16.959> rod<00:01:17.200> 810

00:01:17.669 --> 00:01:17.679 
matter inside we have a soap rod 810

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:19.559 
matter inside we have a soap rod 810
movement<00:01:18.100> it's<00:01:18.549> a<00:01:18.700> stainless<00:01:18.939> steel<00:01:19.119> case

00:01:19.559 --> 00:01:19.569 
movement it's a stainless steel case

00:01:19.569 --> 00:01:21.599 
movement it's a stainless steel case
that's<00:01:20.020> around<00:01:20.200> 42<00:01:20.709> millimeters<00:01:21.249> from<00:01:21.490> the

00:01:21.599 --> 00:01:21.609 
that's around 42 millimeters from the

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:23.190 
that's around 42 millimeters from the
largest<00:01:22.060> part<00:01:22.359> of<00:01:22.420> the<00:01:22.509> knotch<00:01:22.689> to<00:01:22.959> the<00:01:23.049> other

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 
largest part of the knotch to the other

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.260 
largest part of the knotch to the other
side<00:01:23.499> what's<00:01:24.279> interesting<00:01:24.490> is<00:01:24.789> that<00:01:24.819> it<00:01:25.060> wears

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270 
side what's interesting is that it wears

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:26.730 
side what's interesting is that it wears
a<00:01:25.359> bit<00:01:25.539> smaller<00:01:25.869> because<00:01:26.259> of<00:01:26.380> those<00:01:26.499> notches

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
a bit smaller because of those notches

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.399 
a bit smaller because of those notches
so<00:01:27.520> effectively<00:01:28.270> the<00:01:28.479> case<00:01:28.659> size<00:01:28.899> comes<00:01:29.200> down

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:29.409 
so effectively the case size comes down

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:31.830 
so effectively the case size comes down
to<00:01:29.590> about<00:01:29.770> 39<00:01:30.249> millimeters<00:01:30.459> in<00:01:30.819> diameter<00:01:30.969> it's

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 
to about 39 millimeters in diameter it's

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.719 
to about 39 millimeters in diameter it's
only<00:01:31.959> 9<00:01:32.200> millimeters<00:01:32.709> thick<00:01:32.950> that's<00:01:33.310> in<00:01:33.520> part

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:33.729 
only 9 millimeters thick that's in part

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:35.129 
only 9 millimeters thick that's in part
due<00:01:33.939> to<00:01:33.969> the<00:01:34.149> movement<00:01:34.539> itself<00:01:34.779> which<00:01:35.020> is

00:01:35.129 --> 00:01:35.139 
due to the movement itself which is

00:01:35.139 --> 00:01:37.199 
due to the movement itself which is
three<00:01:35.319> point<00:01:35.590> six<00:01:35.770> millimeters<00:01:36.099> so<00:01:36.939> it<00:01:37.029> wears

00:01:37.199 --> 00:01:37.209 
three point six millimeters so it wears

00:01:37.209 --> 00:01:40.319 
three point six millimeters so it wears
pretty<00:01:37.479> well<00:01:37.689> on<00:01:37.779> the<00:01:37.869> wrist<00:01:39.029> so<00:01:40.029> the<00:01:40.209> watch

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:40.329 
pretty well on the wrist so the watch

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:41.699 
pretty well on the wrist so the watch
that<00:01:40.509> I<00:01:40.569> spent<00:01:40.869> some<00:01:40.990> time<00:01:41.139> with<00:01:41.259> is<00:01:41.409> the<00:01:41.560> hey

00:01:41.699 --> 00:01:41.709 
that I spent some time with is the hey

interesting<00:05:14.350> to<00:05:14.650> note<00:05:14.680> about<00:05:14.950> this<00:05:15.190> watch<00:05:15.370> is

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:15.580 
interesting to note about this watch is

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:17.370 
interesting to note about this watch is
that<00:05:15.730> the<00:05:16.240> dead<00:05:16.420> beat<00:05:16.600> you<00:05:16.810> often<00:05:17.140> see<00:05:17.290> the

that the dead beat you often see the

that the dead beat you often see the
seconds<00:05:17.800> hand<00:05:17.860> kind<00:05:18.520> of<00:05:18.610> missed<00:05:18.880> the<00:05:19.090> seconds

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:19.510 
seconds hand kind of missed the seconds

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:21.480 
seconds hand kind of missed the seconds

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:21.490 
mark on the dial this hits it every

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:23.310 
mark on the dial this hits it every
single<00:05:21.910> time<00:05:22.090> I<00:05:22.270> mean<00:05:22.390> it<00:05:22.510> never<00:05:22.780> falters

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:23.320 
single time I mean it never falters

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:25.470 
single time I mean it never falters
which<00:05:23.530> is<00:05:23.680> really<00:05:24.010> impressive<00:05:24.460> that<00:05:24.970> said<00:05:25.330> you

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:25.480 
which is really impressive that said you

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:27.600 
which is really impressive that said you
know<00:05:25.600> the<00:05:25.720> dial<00:05:25.930> is<00:05:26.200> rather<00:05:26.560> plain<00:05:26.890> the<00:05:27.340> case

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:27.610 
know the dial is rather plain the case

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:30.360 
know the dial is rather plain the case
is<00:05:27.850> rather<00:05:28.240> thick<00:05:28.540> so<00:05:28.990> it's<00:05:29.170> not<00:05:29.440> very<00:05:29.890> elegant

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:30.370 
is rather thick so it's not very elegant

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:31.710 
is rather thick so it's not very elegant
you<00:05:30.460> know<00:05:30.580> they<00:05:30.730> dedicated<00:05:31.300> a<00:05:31.390> lot<00:05:31.570> of<00:05:31.600> time

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:31.720 
you know they dedicated a lot of time

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:33.360 
you know they dedicated a lot of time
and<00:05:32.020> money<00:05:32.110> to<00:05:32.350> making<00:05:32.680> these<00:05:32.830> modular

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:33.370 
and money to making these modular

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:35.040 
and money to making these modular
movements<00:05:33.820> work<00:05:34.270> the<00:05:34.450> way<00:05:34.570> that<00:05:34.750> they<00:05:34.840> work

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:35.050 
movements work the way that they work

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:36.960 
movements work the way that they work
and<00:05:35.260> again<00:05:35.320> they<00:05:35.650> work<00:05:35.830> flawlessly<00:05:36.100> but<00:05:36.940> I

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:36.970 
and again they work flawlessly but I

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:38.340 
and again they work flawlessly but I
would<00:05:37.120> like<00:05:37.240> a<00:05:37.510> little<00:05:37.660> bit<00:05:37.810> thinner<00:05:38.080> and<00:05:38.170> a

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:38.350 
would like a little bit thinner and a

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:41.820 
would like a little bit thinner and a
little<00:05:38.530> bit<00:05:38.620> more<00:05:38.770> elegant<00:05:40.080> all<00:05:41.080> that<00:05:41.350> said<00:05:41.620> I

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:41.830 
little bit more elegant all that said I

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:43.980 
little bit more elegant all that said I
think<00:05:41.980> all<00:05:42.340> of<00:05:42.400> these<00:05:42.790> watches<00:05:43.330> are<00:05:43.480> really

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:43.990 
think all of these watches are really

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:45.780 
think all of these watches are really
interesting<00:05:44.440> in<00:05:44.530> their<00:05:44.710> own<00:05:44.830> way<00:05:45.130> Kellie's

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:45.790 
interesting in their own way Kellie's

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:47.370 
interesting in their own way Kellie's
watches<00:05:46.300> really<00:05:46.510> focus<00:05:46.930> more<00:05:47.110> on<00:05:47.169> the

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:47.380 
watches really focus more on the

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:48.720 
watches really focus more on the
aesthetic<00:05:47.800> and<00:05:48.010> kind<00:05:48.220> of<00:05:48.250> independent

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:48.730 
aesthetic and kind of independent

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:50.880 
aesthetic and kind of independent

sourcing the case the dial the hands

hey bring to jumping pilot seconds is

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:58.620 
hey bring to jumping pilot seconds is
really<00:05:56.440> a<00:05:56.470> culmination<00:05:57.010> of<00:05:57.370> two<00:05:58.240> decades

00:05:58.620 --> 00:05:58.630 
really a culmination of two decades

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:01.770 
really a culmination of two decades
worth<00:05:58.810> of<00:05:58.840> work<00:05:59.680> in<00:05:59.919> creating<00:06:00.880> affordable

worth of work in creating affordable

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:04.020 
worth of work in creating affordable
complications<00:06:02.740> and<00:06:02.950> this<00:06:03.160> is<00:06:03.340> a<00:06:03.370> fantastic

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:04.030 
complications and this is a fantastic

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:07.110 
complications and this is a fantastic
movement<00:06:04.750> for<00:06:04.990> this<00:06:05.110> price<00:06:05.350> but<00:06:06.130> at<00:06:06.340> a<00:06:06.400> cost<00:06:06.760> in

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:07.120 
movement for this price but at a cost in

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.000 
movement for this price but at a cost in
terms<00:06:07.570> of<00:06:07.780> wearability<00:06:08.169> and<00:06:08.410> in<00:06:08.590> terms<00:06:08.800> of

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:09.010 
terms of wearability and in terms of

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:09.480 
terms of wearability and in terms of
sleekness

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:09.490 
sleekness

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:11.400 
sleekness
and<00:06:09.669> I<00:06:09.850> think<00:06:10.060> Stevens<00:06:10.480> is<00:06:10.690> kind<00:06:11.020> of<00:06:11.080> a<00:06:11.200> nice

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:11.410 
and I think Stevens is kind of a nice

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:13.140 
and I think Stevens is kind of a nice
combination<00:06:11.740> of<00:06:12.190> the<00:06:12.340> two<00:06:12.490> it's<00:06:12.940> very

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:13.150 
combination of the two it's very

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:14.850 
combination of the two it's very
wearable<00:06:13.360> there's<00:06:13.960> some<00:06:14.140> nice<00:06:14.260> attention<00:06:14.680> to

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:14.860 
wearable there's some nice attention to

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:16.650 
wearable there's some nice attention to
detail<00:06:14.950> that<00:06:15.430> we<00:06:15.580> may<00:06:15.730> not<00:06:15.910> have<00:06:16.030> seen<00:06:16.090> in<00:06:16.450> my

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:16.660 
detail that we may not have seen in my

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:19.409 
detail that we may not have seen in my
case<00:06:16.900> on<00:06:17.169> the<00:06:17.350> dial<00:06:17.530> on<00:06:17.680> case<00:06:17.860> and<00:06:18.100> on<00:06:18.610> Kelly's

00:06:19.409 --> 00:06:19.419 
case on the dial on case and on Kelly's

00:06:19.419 --> 00:06:21.060 
case on the dial on case and on Kelly's
case<00:06:19.570> in<00:06:19.780> terms<00:06:19.930> of<00:06:20.050> the<00:06:20.110> movement<00:06:20.290> so<00:06:20.680> again

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:21.070 
case in terms of the movement so again

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:22.530 
case in terms of the movement so again
it<00:06:21.400> all<00:06:21.580> comes<00:06:21.610> down<00:06:21.910> to<00:06:22.000> personal<00:06:22.180> preference

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:22.540 
it all comes down to personal preference

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:24.870 
it all comes down to personal preference
these<00:06:22.780> are<00:06:22.900> all<00:06:23.050> truly<00:06:23.650> and<00:06:24.070> assembled

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:24.880 
these are all truly and assembled

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:26.610 
these are all truly and assembled
independent<00:06:25.510> watches<00:06:25.870> and<00:06:26.140> I<00:06:26.260> think<00:06:26.500> they

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:26.620 
independent watches and I think they

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:28.680 
independent watches and I think they
represent<00:06:26.770> a<00:06:27.250> great<00:06:27.700> kind<00:06:27.970> of<00:06:28.000> positive<00:06:28.450> force

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:28.690 
represent a great kind of positive force

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:30.659 
represent a great kind of positive force
in<00:06:28.900> watchmaking<00:06:29.260> all<00:06:29.710> three<00:06:30.280> of<00:06:30.370> them<00:06:30.490> no

00:06:30.659 --> 00:06:30.669 
in watchmaking all three of them no

00:06:30.669 --> 00:06:31.980 
in watchmaking all three of them no
matter<00:06:30.850> the<00:06:31.060> price<00:06:31.270> no<00:06:31.450> matter<00:06:31.510> the

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:31.990 
matter the price no matter the
