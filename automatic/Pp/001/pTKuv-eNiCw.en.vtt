00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:56.780 

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:00.950 

like<00:05:57.780> like<00:05:58.410> what<00:05:58.560> I<00:05:58.590> said<00:05:58.889> earlier<00:05:59.780> don't<00:06:00.780> have

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:00.960 
like like what I said earlier don't have

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:04.189 
like like what I said earlier don't have
to<00:06:01.289> jailbreak<00:06:02.100> your<00:06:02.340> ipod<00:06:03.030> or<00:06:03.720> Apple<00:06:04.169> device

00:06:04.189 --> 00:06:04.199 
to jailbreak your ipod or Apple device

00:06:04.199 --> 00:06:09.890 
to jailbreak your ipod or Apple device
or<00:06:04.770> I<00:06:04.919> had<00:06:05.340> is<00:06:05.610> on<00:06:05.789> tonight<00:06:06.150> but<00:06:07.020> on<00:06:07.400> so<00:06:08.900> it's

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:09.900 
or I had is on tonight but on so it's

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:13.850 
or I had is on tonight but on so it's
fairly<00:06:10.620> simple<00:06:11.010> unless<00:06:11.820> you're<00:06:12.270> I<00:06:12.860> explored

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:13.860 
fairly simple unless you're I explored

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:15.830 
fairly simple unless you're I explored
to<00:06:13.949> not<00:06:14.250> want<00:06:14.460> to<00:06:14.520> work<00:06:14.669> like<00:06:14.699> mine<00:06:15.240> I'm

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:15.840 
to not want to work like mine I'm

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:19.850 
to not want to work like mine I'm
probably<00:06:16.650> open<00:06:17.490> close<00:06:18.030> like<00:06:18.389> five

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:19.860 
probably open close like five

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:24.830 
probably open close like five
times<00:06:20.419> so<00:06:21.919> yeah<00:06:22.919> hopefully<00:06:23.880> hopefully<00:06:24.479> it<00:06:24.720> was

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:24.840 
times so yeah hopefully hopefully it was

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:30.680 
times so yeah hopefully hopefully it was
simple<00:06:25.200> enough<00:06:27.020> next<00:06:28.020> how<00:06:28.740> 2<00:06:28.940> of<00:06:29.940> what<00:06:30.599> I'm

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:30.690 
simple enough next how 2 of what I'm

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:39.230 
simple enough next how 2 of what I'm
going<00:06:30.840> to<00:06:30.870> do<00:06:31.050> is<00:06:32.690> how<00:06:33.690> to<00:06:33.720> upload<00:06:37.729> or<00:06:38.729> how<00:06:39.180> to
