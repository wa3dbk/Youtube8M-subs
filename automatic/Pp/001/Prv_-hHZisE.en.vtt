00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
even then I really don't care about

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.569 
even then I really don't care about
those<00:00:49.170> because<00:00:49.559> he<00:00:49.710> is<00:00:49.800> a<00:00:49.860> goal<00:00:50.190> scoring

machine<00:00:51.090> if<00:00:51.270> he<00:00:51.390> if<00:00:51.719> he<00:00:51.870> is<00:00:51.989> for<00:00:52.170> a<00:00:52.230> long<00:00:52.350> go

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
machine if he if he is for a long go

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.799 
machine if he if he is for a long go
even<00:00:52.829> if<00:00:52.920> he<00:00:53.010> isn't<00:00:53.219> he<00:00:53.910> manages<00:00:54.300> to<00:00:54.420> score

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
even if he isn't he manages to score

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.569 
even if he isn't he manages to score
goals<00:00:54.840> it's<00:00:55.350> just<00:00:55.620> incredible<00:00:56.129> like<00:00:56.280> so<00:00:56.460> many

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
goals it's just incredible like so many

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.250 
goals it's just incredible like so many
times<00:00:56.610> I'm<00:00:57.030> getting<00:00:57.570> squeezed<00:00:57.899> in<00:00:58.079> by<00:00:58.199> the

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
times I'm getting squeezed in by the

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.319 
times I'm getting squeezed in by the
fenders<00:00:58.710> and<00:00:59.129> I<00:00:59.280> just<00:00:59.520> had<00:00:59.640> to<00:00:59.670> take<00:00:59.850> a<00:00:59.910> shot<00:01:00.180> it

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
fenders and I just had to take a shot it

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.060 
fenders and I just had to take a shot it
goes<00:01:00.449> straight<00:01:00.629> to<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.020> goal<00:01:01.289> obviously<00:01:01.949> as<00:01:02.039> I

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
goes straight to the goal obviously as I

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.969 
goes straight to the goal obviously as I
say<00:01:02.280> he<00:01:02.699> has<00:01:02.910> got<00:01:03.149> some<00:01:03.589> negatives<00:01:04.589> which<00:01:04.799> is

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
say he has got some negatives which is

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.850 
say he has got some negatives which is
his<00:01:05.309> strength<00:01:05.700> he's<00:01:06.000> not<00:01:06.119> too<00:01:06.330> strong<00:01:06.750> and<00:01:07.020> I

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
his strength he's not too strong and I

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.200 
his strength he's not too strong and I
put<00:01:08.159> heading<00:01:08.430> him<00:01:08.520> as<00:01:08.610> well<00:01:08.760> because<00:01:09.090> it's

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
put heading him as well because it's

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.510 
put heading him as well because it's
really<00:01:09.270> 5050<00:01:09.930> he<00:01:10.080> has<00:01:10.290> got<00:01:10.530> amazing<00:01:10.920> heading

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
really 5050 he has got amazing heading

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.880 
really 5050 he has got amazing heading
but<00:01:11.820> he<00:01:12.420> isn't<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:12.900> taller<00:01:13.110> two<00:01:13.290> people<00:01:13.619> so<00:01:13.799> he

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
but he isn't the taller two people so he

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.399 
but he isn't the taller two people so he
doesn't<00:01:14.070> actually<00:01:14.340> make<00:01:15.150> it<00:01:15.420> to<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:16.229> header

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
doesn't actually make it to the header

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.109 
doesn't actually make it to the header
so<00:01:16.650> it's<00:01:16.740> a<00:01:16.799> bit<00:01:16.979> annoying<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.820> kind<00:01:18.030> of

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
so it's a bit annoying the kind of

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.609 
so it's a bit annoying the kind of
conflict<00:01:18.450> of<00:01:18.659> each<00:01:18.750> other<00:01:18.960> but<00:01:19.140> again<00:01:19.380> as<00:01:19.530> I

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
conflict of each other but again as I

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.590 
conflict of each other but again as I
say<00:01:19.830> if<00:01:20.130> we<00:01:20.220> do<00:01:20.310> get<00:01:20.430> ahead<00:01:20.610> it<00:01:20.790> get<00:01:21.270> to<00:01:21.360> head<00:01:21.450> it

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
say if we do get ahead it get to head it

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.539 
say if we do get ahead it get to head it
he<00:01:21.960> will<00:01:22.170> score<00:01:22.500> it<00:01:22.619> in<00:01:22.770> now<00:01:23.100> look<00:01:23.250> at<00:01:23.340> it<00:01:23.400> in

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
he will score it in now look at it in

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.310 
he will score it in now look at it in
game<00:01:23.790> stats<00:01:24.000> look<00:01:24.180> at<00:01:24.299> all<00:01:24.509> those<00:01:24.689> high<00:01:24.960> ones

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
game stats look at all those high ones
