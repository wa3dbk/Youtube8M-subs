 students and teachers confirm what 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:07.490
 What I like the most about American school 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.680
 are the computer classes the class 

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:10.880
 of computers use computers the 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.890
 which are very days 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.810
 and the teachers also put 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:17.209
 didactic activities so that we 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:19.100
 let's learn and have fun at the same 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:21.170
 good time I like school 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:24.290
 American in sporting terms because 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:27.110
 It gives us several sports like 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:28.790
 soccer basketball volleyball also 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:31.050
 We can enjoy some other 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:33.810
 varied sports like chess 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:36.449
 tennis ping-pong the camera I like 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:39.569
 from school and unwrap myself in the paper 

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:41.610
 of dance I like because we do everything 

00:04:39.569 --> 00:04:42.780
 type of movements in 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:45.389
 joints 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:49.199
 I've always liked it since I was little 

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:52.139
 dance and I love to dance school 

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:55.229

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:58.050
 They are very kind, very, very, very 

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:59.879
 fun what I like most about 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:02.370
 American school is the children's choir 

00:04:59.879 --> 00:05:05.629
 because we can learn about sheet music 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:09.180
 about singing about musical techniques 

00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:10.729
 etc. the way to handle classes 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:13.860
 of English at the American school 

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:15.780
 allows everyone to be with the 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:18.090
 comrades who find themselves 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:21.060
 level that's why the level is handled 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:23.190
 intermediate professional and advance what 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:25.979
 which allows the class to reach a 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:27.670
 natural rhythm and it's going to be a lot 

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:30.280
 more on each topic 

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:32.350
 we also have the opportunity of one year 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:33.970
 towards another to advance in our 

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:37.390
 levels as long as we have 

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:39.490
 achieved and even surpassed the achievements 

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:41.590
 proposed the American school in addition 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:44.500
 to give us an intellectual formation 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:46.630
 supports us in the coexistence processes 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:48.490
 which influence in a positive way 

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:51.580
 in harmony among the students 

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:53.590
 the American school is convinced that 

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:56.080
 the best way to educate in discipline 

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:58.810
 is putting special emphasis on the 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:01.060
 love but especially in the reinforcement of 

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:03.190
 the values this is what will be the 

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:05.320
 reform in the vision of a space of 

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:07.990
 reflection and analysis where the 

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:11.470
 purpose is the recognition of 

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:14.050
 lack called self-discipline the school 

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:16.480
 has a teaching staff really 

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:19.210
 human and trained in the different 

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:21.250
 areas of knowledge that prioritizes the 

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:23.980
 affinity relationship with students 

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:26.700
 as a true mechanism to achieve 

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:26.700
 a significant learning
