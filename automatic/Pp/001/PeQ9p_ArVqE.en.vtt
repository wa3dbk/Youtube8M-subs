00:00:00.749 --> 00:00:06.230
 former footballer Fernando Cáceres was shot in an attempt to assault rennes 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:10.290
 In the early morning of the citadel they were trying to steal his car 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.440
 they shot in the head the last medical part is widespread 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.449
 minutes ago he points out that his state is criticized 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:23.319
 another parameter 

00:00:23.319 --> 00:00:26.569
 or health of Cáceres is still critical 

00:00:26.569 --> 00:00:31.489
 the forecast reserved the parameters that we must faith abandons the consumption of 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:32.700
 products 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.930
 it has to do with a tomographic control a little useless but 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:39.780
 p 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.520
 soto positive situation evolution 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.520
 otherwise they did not reach to establish that 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:48.260
 a favorable vision 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.660
 so we keep working I do not know nor study that we're going to develop the 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:52.960
 next hours 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.220
 that has to do strictly good management of intracranial pressure 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.840
 what are we going to do a Fabian co-operative and based on that? 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.060
 that we value of cerebral sufferings that fernando suffers 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.620
 and we will advance in some other methodology d 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:11.340
 this treatment of the we are evaluating 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.420
 has participated in the evaluation of the neurosurgical team doctor yesterday 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:17.330
 a 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:18.370
 pepe examen 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:21.370
 important in orbit 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:26.360
 in thinking about going into trouble that had to do with the hole 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:27.310
 entry of 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:28.860
 the projectile 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.710
 ii we can say that the patient is urologically flat 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.300
 for his 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:40.050
 that he does not have a complication and that all the issues he suffers from 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:43.050
 they have to do strictly with brain injuries 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:48.450
 that originates his hospitalization so we will continue working with some small 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.190
 voted yourself 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:54.880
 trying that space that possibility is that it does not 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.040
 I've taken advantage of accent sense with all the 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.980
 the participation of all and that is this that make up this hospital 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.360
 and waiting for one in a light that allows us to think that the anointing goes 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.879
 do favorable to the situation 

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:14.359
 specifically the patient is in critical condition 

00:02:14.359 --> 00:02:18.299
 the aeb or stationary lotions we will give a medical part of tomorrow 

00:02:18.999 --> 00:02:21.239
 in all of them eight in the morning 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:26.060
 and if any good any question in one sense or in another we have gotten 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.759
 family are also the masters we give you 

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:33.549
 figuera informed if you that big one we sent reported on the best 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:34.889
 schools the very soon 

00:02:34.889 --> 00:02:38.039
 how soon we are fighting for healthy life 

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:43.459
 hampton last hours peter drucker given clyro generals equal day of the 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:45.450
 city ​​of the situation of euros logical 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.510
 you get to improved some parameters like the tomography 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:49.620
 computed 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.180
 expressing that the surgery has met in part because our goal of 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.070
 solve the displacements of the brain 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:59.089
 however, which at that point 

00:02:59.089 --> 00:03:04.999
 That is a favorable element the sum of the anointing of the command on your part 

00:03:04.999 --> 00:03:05.620
 medina 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.650
 is not under mechanical respiratory assistance that's why the coach 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.609
 not not necessary so much in this hospital has all 

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:16.709
 elements to be able to deal with this type of issues fundamentally 

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:20.759
 a tomograph an active guard neurosurgeon 

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:25.109
 if a therapist does afterwards I do not know nor are we something for this kind of 

00:03:25.689 --> 00:03:26.689
 of the total 

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:30.159
 repeat what you already accepted your body was the one that has the pretoria breads 

00:03:31.839 --> 00:03:33.069
 percent 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:37.479
 the bullet is evicting year but not really in the problem but that 

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:41.239
 journey of the bird what harms the havana in all its extension of the 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:42.069
 entry 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:45.539
 in the right orbit up there the cars in the parietal region 

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:51.519
 of right sc and wishes them the injury of dams fernando that euro zone managed a 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:55.409
 biography jules kroll make it available options that what they are going to 

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:59.099
 be doing strong that you do live patient control is followed by the 

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:02.290
 clinical management returns to the side of the patient 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:06.219
 by the tomographic and serial controls 

00:04:06.219 --> 00:04:08.099
 well for evaluations 

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:10.729
 fundamentally have to do with control 

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:13.419
 and the management of intracranial pressure 

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:14.639
 and this generates 

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:17.389
 and obviously the elaboration of euros 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:18.280
 It has been good 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:19.609
 specifically 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:22.729
 the patient is critical 

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:26.790
 this work is one would be stationed by amaya alonso by mop art 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:29.800
 and if any question arises we will be reporting 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.029
 in principle the family is important up to 24 hours 

00:04:33.029 --> 00:04:37.009
 that's very important it is said is the area in the most important cap that goes 

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:37.680
 to mark 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.849
 the evolution of the patient and citigroup 

00:04:39.849 --> 00:04:41.759
 the medical part between seven and eight in the morning
