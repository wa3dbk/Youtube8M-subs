 the 50 million make readers Bucher ill Bonn's Hainstadt the speech is then think 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.670
 We first of all to the traffic especially to older diesel cars 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:11.709
 are dangerous muddlers 

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:14.969
 Meanwhile, it is also known that the fine dust in considerable quantities 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.010
 inhaled exposes you to a significant health risk 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.860
 probably already in his profession a staff skidding children and the 

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:26.859
 poisoned atmosphere in the workplace 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:30.210
 Jochen Kern from Bamberg is ill 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.140
 The banker can not work in any resident for years suing the 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.960
 32-year-old unexplained symptoms had been weeks long 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.440
 already complaints Mantl inflammation pharyngitis 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.700
 The nose was similar to the stuffing 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.990
 I've always had an overwhelming sense of the industries 

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:51.720
 Svindal had still been there and inflammation 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.930
 and even in the skin was already a skin hide on there 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:01.590
 It took almost ten years and more than 50 doctor visits to realize 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.690
 JÃ¼rgen Kellner suffers from a key and compatibility 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.830
 in time you will feel the same way 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.830
 put as a simulator because no one finds something 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.650
 and who knows exactly who do the problems and complaints and also the 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:16.730
 Sick days increase in countries 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:19.730
 Percent compensated for mine 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:25.229
 Jochen Keller sat next to a laser printer for 7 to 8 hours a day 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.009
 breathed in toner Resta and fine dust in the printing process 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.800
 over months and years 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.929
 the more he printed and copied 

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:35.929
 the sicker he felt 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:42.250
 first ear nose and throat doctor youth homes recognized the connection between 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:43.360
 health problems 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:44.840
 one and stoner 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.640
 He is observing more and more patients with symptoms of toner 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.410
 Incompatibility inferring 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:56.030
 In the contract it is so that we see one over the last few years 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.310
 significant increase in patient numbers with these complaints 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:05.240
 Between 2001 and 2004 we had about 6 to 8 patients a year 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.200
 first half of 2007 27 patients with these letters of complaint know 

00:02:11.109 --> 00:02:14.969
 especially dangerous is the fine dust when fixing the tuner on the 

00:02:14.969 --> 00:02:16.210
 Paper is created 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:20.320
 Particulate matter can enter the body via the respiratory tract and even cancer there 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:21.849
 trigger 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:25.420
 new studies of the university in the Australian Brisbane 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.410
 and the University Hospital Giessen now occupy the laser printer and 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.760
 Copier depending on the model release large amounts of fine dust 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:38.519
 Experts suspect that the black industry contained in each toner Jost 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:43.379
 The trigger of the diseases is he comes from large filter plants emerges as 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:46.399
 brave product in industrial combustion processes 

00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:49.040
 depending on the type of relatives materials 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.120
 The US star is burdened with heavy metals the rent or grom 

00:02:54.179 --> 00:02:58.489
 the toxicologists of the University of Giessen have the air of 60 offices 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:02:59.319
 examined 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:00.340
 the result 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.079
 if the reader has per carat 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:05.729
 then the amount of dust particles in the room multiplies and it becomes 

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:08.729
 highly dangerous fine dusts free 

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:14.469
 But not only office space is affected according to Giessen researchers 

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:19.879
 On the other hand, you have to see that, of course, this technique has Tibetans 

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:23.399
 Millions of times with millions of used 

00:03:23.399 --> 00:03:26.559
 And that's not just the office workplace problem we have there 

00:03:26.559 --> 00:03:30.649
 to look at these devices are indeed synonymous in the private environment 

00:03:30.649 --> 00:03:33.709
 sometimes even in the nursery and there you have to from the 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:35.809
 Take a look at the risk assessment 

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:36.899
 to see 

00:03:36.899 --> 00:03:39.899
 Literally that's really a safe technology we have 

00:03:40.499 --> 00:03:44.399
 millionfold endangerment of our health by copiers and 

00:03:44.399 --> 00:03:45.779
 laser 

00:03:45.779 --> 00:03:50.389
 Upon request of the time-game, the Bavarian Ministry of Health declares one 

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:54.149
 Endangerment of humans by laser printers is medical today 

00:03:54.149 --> 00:03:55.329
 not proven 

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:57.880
 Damage to the respiratory tract caused by toner dust 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:59.869
 had not yet documented a study 

00:03:59.869 --> 00:04:03.779
 Renowned physicians are now pushing for the greed corner effect of Thuner 

00:04:03.779 --> 00:04:05.959
 To examine dust on humans 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:08.159
 finally do something and investigated 

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:10.660
 then percent are also able 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:12.909
 to evaluate and really say that 

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:15.389
 the risk premiums to the devices 

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:17.039
 in the basement 

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:21.549
 The Federal Institute for Risk Assessment is now going to another study in 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:25.099
 Give order until the results are available, it takes at least once again 

00:04:25.099 --> 00:04:27.309
 two years 

00:04:27.309 --> 00:04:31.199
 but there may be a technical solution for the problem, a fourth of 

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:32.759
 the fine dust upwind 

00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:36.839
 Experts see that the danger is not completely eliminated particulate matter 

00:04:36.839 --> 00:04:40.629
 also penetrate through the cracks of the device to the outside and defend the manufacturer 

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:44.619
 anyway against the standard installation of filters they are convinced 

00:04:44.619 --> 00:04:48.099
 before a dust filter was not useful 

00:04:48.099 --> 00:04:51.250
 If you want to be on the safe side for the time being only 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:55.840
 Readers Printer Set up copiers or fax machines in separate rooms and in front 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:59.050
 Air well AMD workspace 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:02.720
 the toner Damaged banker Jochen Keller had to be lucky 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:06.280
 Employer has him due to the complaints a lot of job 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:10.659
 home furnished without reader printer and without copier 

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:14.319
 Since then he is well again and brings the full work again
