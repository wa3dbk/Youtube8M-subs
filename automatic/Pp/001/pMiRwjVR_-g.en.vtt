going<00:00:16.170> to<00:00:16.230> be<00:00:16.350> the<00:00:17.070> first<00:00:17.279> patterns<00:00:17.640> going<00:00:17.789> to

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
going to be the first patterns going to

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.720

you get to bass drums and just to get

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.259 
you get to bass drums and just to get
comfortable<00:00:29.220> at<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.519> pattern<00:00:29.820> that<00:00:30.029> sounds

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
comfortable at the pattern that sounds

that<00:01:21.090> way<00:01:21.299> we're<00:01:21.509> not<00:01:21.540> ending<00:01:21.869> with<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.140> bass

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
that way we're not ending with the bass

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.359 
that way we're not ending with the bass
drum<00:01:22.470> and<00:01:22.590> starting<00:01:22.950> with<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.130> bass<00:01:23.250> drum

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
drum and starting with the bass drum

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.640 
drum and starting with the bass drum
because<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:24.150> end<00:01:24.330> goal<00:01:24.570> is<00:01:24.869> to<00:01:25.170> play<00:01:25.350> this<00:01:25.470> in

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
because the end goal is to play this in

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.440 
because the end goal is to play this in
32nd<00:01:26.189> notes<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:26.610> it's<00:01:26.729> going<00:01:26.850> to<00:01:26.909> be<00:01:27.000> too<00:01:27.150> fast

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
32nd notes and it's going to be too fast

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.740 
32nd notes and it's going to be too fast
to<00:01:28.049> fit<00:01:28.350> that<00:01:28.680> last<00:01:29.130> bass<00:01:29.369> drum<00:01:29.640> in<00:01:29.850> with<00:01:30.630> the

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
to fit that last bass drum in with the

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:31.999 
to fit that last bass drum in with the
first<00:01:30.930> bass<00:01:31.140> drum<00:01:31.380> so<00:01:31.530> you<00:01:31.590> don't<00:01:31.740> want<00:01:31.890> that

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
first bass drum so you don't want that

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.069 
first bass drum so you don't want that
you<00:01:32.430> should<00:01:32.549> get<00:01:32.610> it<00:01:32.729> with<00:01:33.030> three<00:01:33.600> kick<00:01:33.869> drums

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
you should get it with three kick drums

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.749 
you should get it with three kick drums
in<00:01:34.200> a<00:01:34.259> row<00:01:34.409> with<00:01:34.650> one<00:01:35.040> pedal<00:01:35.250> that's<00:01:35.520> kind<00:01:35.700> of

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
in a row with one pedal that's kind of

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.539 
in a row with one pedal that's kind of
fast<00:01:35.970> so<00:01:36.540> a<00:01:36.869> little<00:01:37.619> bit<00:01:37.770> quicker<00:01:37.920> the<00:01:38.250> pattern

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
fast so a little bit quicker the pattern

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.010 
fast so a little bit quicker the pattern
together<00:01:38.939> I'll<00:01:39.180> play<00:01:39.329> it<00:01:39.360> add<00:01:39.540> sixteenth

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
together I'll play it add sixteenth

00:01:40.020 --> 00:02:08.080 
together I'll play it add sixteenth
notes<00:01:40.200> sounds<00:01:40.590> like<00:01:40.650> this

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.190 

alright<00:02:09.090> so<00:02:09.299> that's<00:02:09.479> what<00:02:09.599> it<00:02:09.690> sounds<00:02:09.929> like<00:02:09.959> at

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
alright so that's what it sounds like at

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.780 
alright so that's what it sounds like at
the<00:02:10.500> rate<00:02:10.649> of<00:02:10.709> sixteenth<00:02:11.190> notes<00:02:11.400> but<00:02:11.670> what

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
the rate of sixteenth notes but what

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.039 
the rate of sixteenth notes but what
we're<00:02:11.910> going<00:02:12.000> to<00:02:12.090> do<00:02:12.269> is<00:02:12.510> when<00:02:12.930> you're

00:02:13.039 --> 00:02:13.049 
we're going to do is when you're

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:14.839 
we're going to do is when you're
comfortable<00:02:13.560> with<00:02:13.620> that<00:02:13.830> speed<00:02:14.370> it<00:02:14.489> up<00:02:14.610> and

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:14.849 
comfortable with that speed it up and

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:17.270 
comfortable with that speed it up and
play<00:02:14.940> it<00:02:15.030> twice<00:02:15.299> as<00:02:15.480> fast<00:02:15.690> in<00:02:15.989> 32nd<00:02:16.709> notes<00:02:16.830> so

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
play it twice as fast in 32nd notes so

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.880 
play it twice as fast in 32nd notes so
remember<00:02:17.760> when<00:02:18.000> we<00:02:18.120> do<00:02:18.330> that<00:02:18.510> we<00:02:18.569> have<00:02:18.989> to<00:02:19.019> not

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
remember when we do that we have to not

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.800 
remember when we do that we have to not
only<00:02:19.920> play<00:02:20.400> it<00:02:20.549> twice<00:02:20.849> as<00:02:21.090> fast<00:02:21.299> but<00:02:21.540> we<00:02:21.720> have

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
only play it twice as fast but we have

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.509 
only play it twice as fast but we have
to<00:02:21.930> play<00:02:22.079> it<00:02:22.200> twice<00:02:22.470> as<00:02:22.650> many<00:02:22.799> times<00:02:23.130> through

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
to play it twice as many times through

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:25.699 
to play it twice as many times through
or<00:02:23.910> else<00:02:24.030> we're<00:02:24.150> going<00:02:24.269> to<00:02:24.329> fall<00:02:24.630> short<00:02:24.989> in<00:02:25.200> the

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
or else we're going to fall short in the

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:51.310 
or else we're going to fall short in the
measure<00:02:25.890> so<00:02:26.310> let's<00:02:26.880> try<00:02:27.030> it

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:51.320 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.180
