other<00:03:13.840> teams<00:03:14.650> carrier<00:03:15.280> I<00:03:15.520> mean<00:03:15.700> granted<00:03:16.570> the

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
other teams carrier I mean granted the

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.240 
other teams carrier I mean granted the
conquest<00:03:17.290> part<00:03:17.560> is<00:03:17.680> fairly<00:03:17.830> straightforward

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
conquest part is fairly straightforward

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.220 
conquest part is fairly straightforward
because<00:03:18.610> conquest<00:03:19.180> has<00:03:19.420> been<00:03:19.600> such<00:03:19.810> a<00:03:19.840> vital

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
because conquest has been such a vital

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:21.780 
because conquest has been such a vital
part<00:03:20.410> of<00:03:20.440> battle<00:03:20.709> especially<00:03:20.920> battlefield<00:03:21.580> 4

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
part of battle especially battlefield 4

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.480 
part of battle especially battlefield 4
it's<00:03:22.030> pretty<00:03:22.720> obvious<00:03:23.230> that<00:03:23.470> dice<00:03:23.890> built<00:03:24.370> the

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:24.490 
it's pretty obvious that dice built the

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:26.610 
it's pretty obvious that dice built the
entire<00:03:24.820> game<00:03:25.150> around<00:03:25.480> conquest<00:03:25.990> large<00:03:26.050> I'm

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
entire game around conquest large I'm

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.050 
entire game around conquest large I'm
not<00:03:26.890> gonna<00:03:27.010> say<00:03:27.100> I'm<00:03:27.190> necessarily<00:03:27.459> but<00:03:27.880> heard

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:28.060 
not gonna say I'm necessarily but heard

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.270 
not gonna say I'm necessarily but heard
about<00:03:28.270> that<00:03:28.450> you<00:03:28.660> guys<00:03:28.810> know<00:03:28.990> that<00:03:29.020> from<00:03:29.410> at

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
about that you guys know that from at

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:31.920 
about that you guys know that from at
least<00:03:30.520> my<00:03:30.700> standpoint<00:03:31.030> I<00:03:31.480> would<00:03:31.510> prefer<00:03:31.840> if

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
least my standpoint I would prefer if

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.110 
least my standpoint I would prefer if
everything<00:03:32.590> will<00:03:32.770> be<00:03:32.890> made<00:03:33.130> for<00:03:33.370> rush<00:03:33.670> because

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
everything will be made for rush because

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.310 
everything will be made for rush because
obviously<00:03:34.300> I<00:03:34.480> come<00:03:34.660> from<00:03:34.750> the<00:03:34.900> bad<00:03:35.080> company

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:35.320 
obviously I come from the bad company

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:36.750 
obviously I come from the bad company
wanted<00:03:35.620> bad<00:03:35.740> company<00:03:36.010> to<00:03:36.130> background<00:03:36.520> which

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
wanted bad company to background which

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.190 
wanted bad company to background which
is<00:03:36.880> where<00:03:37.030> those<00:03:37.209> game<00:03:37.600> modes<00:03:37.840> are<00:03:37.930> the<00:03:38.020> most

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
is where those game modes are the most

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.050 
is where those game modes are the most
prevalent<00:03:38.410> but<00:03:38.709> obviously<00:03:39.190> these<00:03:39.430> maps<00:03:39.790> are

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
prevalent but obviously these maps are

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.630 
prevalent but obviously these maps are
made<00:03:40.810> with<00:03:40.989> conquest<00:03:41.530> and<00:03:41.709> in<00:03:42.010> mines<00:03:42.310> they're

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640 
made with conquest and in mines they're

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.430 
made with conquest and in mines they're
not<00:03:42.790> exactly<00:03:43.180> the<00:03:43.270> most<00:03:43.420> suitable<00:03:43.959> for<00:03:44.320> some

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 
not exactly the most suitable for some

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.560 
not exactly the most suitable for some
of<00:03:44.500> these<00:03:44.560> other<00:03:44.650> game<00:03:44.920> modes<00:03:45.190> and<00:03:45.370> I<00:03:46.300> guess

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:46.570 
of these other game modes and I guess

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:47.850 
of these other game modes and I guess
naval<00:03:46.959> strike<00:03:47.140> is<00:03:47.290> a<00:03:47.320> little<00:03:47.470> bit<00:03:47.560> different

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:47.860 
naval strike is a little bit different

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:49.530 
naval strike is a little bit different
because<00:03:47.920> it<00:03:48.190> is<00:03:48.340> a<00:03:48.370> little<00:03:48.730> more<00:03:48.940> oriented

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
because it is a little more oriented

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.199 
because it is a little more oriented
towards<00:03:50.080> the<00:03:50.320> whole<00:03:50.730> carrier<00:03:51.730> assault

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:52.209 
towards the whole carrier assault

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:54.150 
towards the whole carrier assault
nonsense<00:03:52.750> but<00:03:52.959> it's<00:03:53.110> a<00:03:53.350> little<00:03:53.620> silly<00:03:53.920> how

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.160 
nonsense but it's a little silly how

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:55.710 
nonsense but it's a little silly how
short<00:03:54.580> some<00:03:54.820> of<00:03:54.880> these<00:03:54.940> games<00:03:55.209> again<00:03:55.510> like

00:04:23.309 --> 00:04:23.319 
did not think that it was worth to even

carry<00:04:36.249> your<00:04:36.370> cell<00:04:36.490> obviously<00:04:36.849> knows<00:04:37.060> that<00:04:37.990> the

00:04:38.279 --> 00:04:38.289 
carry your cell obviously knows that the

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:40.619 
carry your cell obviously knows that the
game<00:04:38.499> is<00:04:38.680> so<00:04:38.889> extremely<00:04:39.789> short<00:04:40.240> it's<00:04:40.389> a<00:04:40.449> lot

00:04:40.619 --> 00:04:40.629 
game is so extremely short it's a lot

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:43.439 
game is so extremely short it's a lot
like<00:04:40.930> I<00:04:41.460> wouldn't<00:04:42.460> necessarily<00:04:42.580> say<00:04:43.029> rush

00:04:43.439 --> 00:04:43.449 
like I wouldn't necessarily say rush

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:45.869 
like I wouldn't necessarily say rush
because<00:04:43.659> rush<00:04:43.930> is<00:04:44.110> not<00:04:44.409> it<00:04:44.710> not<00:04:44.949> as<00:04:45.159> bad<00:04:45.580> and

00:04:45.869 --> 00:04:45.879 
because rush is not it not as bad and

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:47.159 
because rush is not it not as bad and
naval<00:04:46.120> strike<00:04:46.360> as<00:04:46.509> it<00:04:46.629> is<00:04:46.719> some<00:04:46.870> of<00:04:46.960> the<00:04:47.020> other

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:47.169

00:04:55.499 --> 00:04:55.509 
crushing me in terms of carrier assault

00:04:55.509 --> 00:04:57.360

and<00:04:55.719> there's<00:04:55.870> very<00:04:56.110> rarely<00:04:56.289> like<00:04:56.979> this<00:04:57.159> very

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:57.370 
and there's very rarely like this very

00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:58.709 
and there's very rarely like this very
little<00:04:57.550> middle<00:04:57.909> ground<00:04:58.090> a<00:04:58.210> lot<00:04:58.300> of<00:04:58.449> it's<00:04:58.569> just

00:04:58.709 --> 00:04:58.719 
little middle ground a lot of it's just

okay<00:04:59.199> I'm<00:04:59.349> gonna<00:04:59.500> board<00:04:59.680> your<00:04:59.889> carrier<00:05:00.189> and

00:05:00.209 --> 00:05:00.219 
okay I'm gonna board your carrier and

00:05:00.219 --> 00:05:01.950 
okay I'm gonna board your carrier and
the<00:05:00.729> reason<00:05:01.060> that<00:05:01.150> I<00:05:01.210> say<00:05:01.449> that<00:05:01.479> it<00:05:01.719> is<00:05:01.810> so

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:01.960 
the reason that I say that it is so

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.290 
the reason that I say that it is so
abrupt<00:05:02.289> is<00:05:02.469> that<00:05:02.650> often<00:05:03.189> times<00:05:03.430> there<00:05:04.150> was

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:04.300 
abrupt is that often times there was

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:07.409 
abrupt is that often times there was
never<00:05:04.779> a<00:05:04.930> defuse<00:05:05.439> like<00:05:06.189> never<00:05:06.610> in<00:05:06.819> a<00:05:06.849> few<00:05:07.150> so

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:07.419 
never a defuse like never in a few so

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:09.570 
never a defuse like never in a few so
it's<00:05:07.960> essentially<00:05:08.469> if<00:05:08.650> you<00:05:08.860> get<00:05:09.129> that<00:05:09.310> other

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:09.580 
it's essentially if you get that other

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:12.719 
it's essentially if you get that other
teams<00:05:10.089> crates<00:05:10.719> armed<00:05:11.289> they<00:05:11.949> are<00:05:12.189> toast

00:05:12.719 --> 00:05:12.729 
teams crates armed they are toast

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:14.730 
teams crates armed they are toast
there's<00:05:13.360> no<00:05:13.659> way<00:05:13.960> they're<00:05:14.199> gonna<00:05:14.259> defuse

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:14.740 
there's no way they're gonna defuse

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:16.559 
there's no way they're gonna defuse
because<00:05:15.219> you're<00:05:15.370> already<00:05:15.520> so<00:05:15.879> far<00:05:16.089> ahead<00:05:16.360> even

00:05:16.559 --> 00:05:16.569 
because you're already so far ahead even

00:05:16.569 --> 00:05:18.570 
because you're already so far ahead even
if<00:05:16.689> you<00:05:16.779> got<00:05:16.870> what<00:05:17.169> that<00:05:17.379> the<00:05:17.830> Penta<00:05:18.189> Kapoor

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:18.580 
if you got what that the Penta Kapoor

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:20.159 
if you got what that the Penta Kapoor
you<00:05:18.639> kept<00:05:18.849> all<00:05:18.999> the<00:05:19.330> flags<00:05:19.599> you<00:05:19.900> started<00:05:20.139> just

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:20.169 
you kept all the flags you started just

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:22.140 
you kept all the flags you started just
pummeling<00:05:20.650> the<00:05:20.710> other<00:05:21.009> team's<00:05:21.310> carrier<00:05:21.759> it's

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:22.150 
pummeling the other team's carrier it's

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:24.119 
pummeling the other team's carrier it's
still<00:05:22.449> not<00:05:22.599> gonna<00:05:22.779> work<00:05:23.050> because<00:05:23.259> nobody<00:05:23.949> at

00:05:24.119 --> 00:05:24.129 
still not gonna work because nobody at

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:25.890 
still not gonna work because nobody at
your<00:05:24.159> carrier<00:05:24.789> will<00:05:25.060> ever<00:05:25.240> defuse<00:05:25.689> and<00:05:25.870> I

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:25.900 
your carrier will ever defuse and I

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:27.329 
your carrier will ever defuse and I
think<00:05:26.080> that's<00:05:26.199> the<00:05:26.319> main<00:05:26.469> thing<00:05:26.680> that's<00:05:27.099> the

00:05:27.329 --> 00:05:27.339 
think that's the main thing that's the

00:05:27.339 --> 00:05:29.309 
think that's the main thing that's the
main<00:05:27.520> differentiator<00:05:28.270> between<00:05:28.389> rush<00:05:29.020> and

00:05:29.309 --> 00:05:29.319 
main differentiator between rush and

00:05:29.319 --> 00:05:31.439 
main differentiator between rush and
carrier<00:05:29.889> assault<00:05:30.189> carrier<00:05:30.520> assault<00:05:30.849> as<00:05:31.060> soon

carrier assault carrier assault as soon

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:32.610 
carrier assault carrier assault as soon
as<00:05:31.539> you<00:05:31.629> get<00:05:31.719> to<00:05:31.810> the<00:05:31.900> carrier<00:05:32.229> it's<00:05:32.469> gonna

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:32.620 
as you get to the carrier it's gonna

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:34.350 
as you get to the carrier it's gonna
blow<00:05:32.919> up<00:05:33.039> regardless<00:05:33.490> like<00:05:33.789> there's<00:05:34.000> very

blow up regardless like there's very

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:36.240 
blow up regardless like there's very
very<00:05:34.509> few<00:05:34.930> instances<00:05:35.589> where<00:05:35.800> they<00:05:36.129> will

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:36.250 
very few instances where they will

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:38.249 
very few instances where they will
actually<00:05:36.279> defuse<00:05:37.029> or<00:05:37.330> defend<00:05:37.689> in<00:05:37.870> any<00:05:38.020> kind<00:05:38.229> of
