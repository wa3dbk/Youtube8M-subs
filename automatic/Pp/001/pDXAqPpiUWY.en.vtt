empire<00:00:08.420> ass<00:00:09.420> over<00:00:09.809> here<00:00:09.840> we<00:00:10.710> have<00:00:10.950> the<00:00:11.429> diet

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
empire ass over here we have the diet

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.430 
empire ass over here we have the diet
hemp<00:00:12.000> which<00:00:12.420> is<00:00:12.630> a<00:00:12.660> ton<00:00:12.990> of<00:00:13.080> fun<00:00:13.170> to<00:00:13.290> work<00:00:13.380> with

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
hemp which is a ton of fun to work with

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.770 
hemp which is a ton of fun to work with
because<00:00:13.769> it<00:00:14.099> can<00:00:14.219> eventually<00:00:14.460> get<00:00:14.940> kind<00:00:15.719> of

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
because it can eventually get kind of

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.090 
because it can eventually get kind of
boring<00:00:15.990> to<00:00:16.170> only<00:00:16.289> be<00:00:16.470> working<00:00:16.800> with<00:00:16.920> the

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
boring to only be working with the

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.019 
boring to only be working with the
natural<00:00:17.369> colors<00:00:17.880> like<00:00:18.090> those<00:00:18.300> over<00:00:18.539> here<00:00:18.720> and

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:20.029 
natural colors like those over here and

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:23.750 
natural colors like those over here and
typically<00:00:21.029> died<00:00:21.300> head<00:00:21.510> is<00:00:22.279> easiest<00:00:23.279> to<00:00:23.460> find

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
typically died head is easiest to find

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.300 
typically died head is easiest to find
in<00:00:24.029> the<00:00:24.420> 20-pound<00:00:25.230> size<00:00:25.680> which<00:00:25.980> I'll<00:00:26.189> explain

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
in the 20-pound size which I'll explain

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.390 
in the 20-pound size which I'll explain
am<00:00:26.670> it<00:00:27.080> but<00:00:28.080> you<00:00:28.380> can<00:00:28.500> also<00:00:28.619> find<00:00:28.890> it<00:00:29.039> in<00:00:29.070> forty

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
am it but you can also find it in forty

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.759 
am it but you can also find it in forty
eight<00:00:29.519> count<00:00:29.730> and<00:00:30.000> then<00:00:30.689> there's<00:00:30.929> the<00:00:31.199> hemp

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
eight count and then there's the hemp

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.190 
eight count and then there's the hemp
twine<00:00:32.040> which<00:00:32.579> is<00:00:32.759> also<00:00:32.910> what<00:00:33.450> this<00:00:33.660> diet<00:00:33.930> step

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
twine which is also what this diet step

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.290 
twine which is also what this diet step
is<00:00:34.350> it's<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:34.680> point<00:00:34.890> and<00:00:35.790> then<00:00:35.969> there's<00:00:36.120> hyper

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
is it's the point and then there's hyper

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.069 
is it's the point and then there's hyper
cord<00:00:36.980> so<00:00:37.980> he<00:00:38.129> arns<00:00:38.430> over<00:00:38.640> here<00:00:38.899> beading<00:00:39.899> wire

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
cord so he arns over here beading wire

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.830 
cord so he arns over here beading wire
and<00:00:40.579> this<00:00:41.579> thing<00:00:41.850> which<00:00:42.059> I<00:00:42.360> don't<00:00:42.629> even

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
and this thing which I don't even

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.900 
and this thing which I don't even
remember<00:00:43.110> what<00:00:43.379> this<00:00:43.559> is<00:00:45.079> so<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.920> primary

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
remember what this is so the primary

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.850 
remember what this is so the primary
difference<00:00:48.450> between<00:00:48.809> twine<00:00:49.140> and<00:00:49.170> court<00:00:49.559> which

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
difference between twine and court which

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.729 
difference between twine and court which
had<00:00:50.039> troubled<00:00:50.430> me<00:00:50.550> for<00:00:50.789> a<00:00:50.820> long<00:00:51.030> time<00:00:51.300> is<00:00:51.739> it's

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
had troubled me for a long time is it's

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.450 
had troubled me for a long time is it's
how<00:00:53.370> it's<00:00:53.550> made<00:00:53.989> twine<00:00:54.989> is<00:00:55.289> made<00:00:55.710> by<00:00:55.980> getting

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
how it's made twine is made by getting

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.220 
how it's made twine is made by getting
lots<00:00:56.670> and<00:00:56.910> lots<00:00:57.059> of<00:00:57.180> little<00:00:57.449> fibers<00:00:57.989> and

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
lots and lots of little fibers and

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.700 
lots and lots of little fibers and
essentially<00:00:59.219> meshing<00:00:59.670> them<00:00:59.789> together

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 
essentially meshing them together

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:05.149 
essentially meshing them together
whereas<00:01:01.710> court<00:01:02.219> is<00:01:02.399> made<00:01:03.210> from<00:01:03.600> lots<00:01:04.559> of<00:01:04.769> long

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
whereas court is made from lots of long

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.160 
whereas court is made from lots of long
pieces<00:01:05.489> of<00:01:05.820> yarn<00:01:06.060> that<00:01:06.510> are<00:01:06.659> twisted<00:01:06.869> together

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
pieces of yarn that are twisted together

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.770 
pieces of yarn that are twisted together
which<00:01:08.130> makes<00:01:08.400> it<00:01:08.580> more<00:01:08.820> consistent<00:01:09.420> and<00:01:09.570> more

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
which makes it more consistent and more

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.469 
which makes it more consistent and more
durable<00:01:10.220> it's<00:01:11.220> hard<00:01:11.460> to<00:01:11.520> notice<00:01:12.240> the

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
durable it's hard to notice the

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.170 
durable it's hard to notice the
consistency<00:01:13.170> really<00:01:13.500> from<00:01:13.820> from<00:01:14.820> back<00:01:14.939> there

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
consistency really from from back there

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.600 
consistency really from from back there
but<00:01:15.450> if<00:01:16.259> you<00:01:16.380> look<00:01:16.530> at<00:01:16.710> them<00:01:16.830> side<00:01:17.040> to<00:01:17.070> side<00:01:17.400> you

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
but if you look at them side to side you

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.820 
but if you look at them side to side you
can<00:01:17.729> tell<00:01:17.909> that<00:01:17.939> this<00:01:18.150> one's<00:01:18.590> quite<00:01:19.590> a<00:01:19.650> bit

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
can tell that this one's quite a bit

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.550 
can tell that this one's quite a bit
more<00:01:19.950> consistent<00:01:20.490> than<00:01:20.549> this<00:01:20.759> one<00:01:20.990> and<00:01:21.990> it's<00:01:22.530> a

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
more consistent than this one and it's a

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.710 
more consistent than this one and it's a
bit<00:01:22.710> pricier<00:01:23.250> but<00:01:23.280> I<00:01:23.820> mean<00:01:24.479> when<00:01:24.600> it<00:01:24.689> comes

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
bit pricier but I mean when it comes

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.600 
bit pricier but I mean when it comes
down<00:01:24.960> to<00:01:25.080> it<00:01:25.350> helps<00:01:25.740> pretty<00:01:26.040> cheap<00:01:26.250> anyway<00:01:26.549> so

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
down to it helps pretty cheap anyway so

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.030 
down to it helps pretty cheap anyway so
I'm<00:01:27.570> an<00:01:27.750> advocate<00:01:27.900> of<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.320> court<00:01:28.619> and<00:01:29.990> the

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040 
I'm an advocate of the court and the

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.550 
I'm an advocate of the court and the
yarn<00:01:32.040> over<00:01:32.159> here<00:01:32.520> I've<00:01:33.360> not<00:01:33.869> really<00:01:34.049> used<00:01:34.380> it

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
yarn over here I've not really used it

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.830 
yarn over here I've not really used it
that<00:01:34.680> much<00:01:34.860> it's<00:01:35.250> kind<00:01:35.909> of<00:01:35.939> tiny<00:01:36.180> but<00:01:36.509> what's

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
that much it's kind of tiny but what's

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.140 
that much it's kind of tiny but what's
really<00:01:36.960> nice<00:01:37.170> about<00:01:37.229> it<00:01:37.500> is<00:01:37.680> that<00:01:37.909> rather<00:01:38.909> than

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
really nice about it is that rather than

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.210 
really nice about it is that rather than
having<00:01:39.390> to<00:01:39.540> soften<00:01:40.320> up<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:40.470> hemp<00:01:40.710> like<00:01:41.070> you

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
having to soften up the hemp like you

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.210 
having to soften up the hemp like you
often<00:01:41.610> would<00:01:41.790> with<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.299> twine<00:01:42.979> yarns<00:01:43.979> made

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
often would with the twine yarns made

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.819 
often would with the twine yarns made
for<00:01:44.689> weaving<00:01:45.689> and<00:01:45.899> macrame<00:01:46.320> and<00:01:46.439> that<00:01:46.560> sort<00:01:46.799> of

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
for weaving and macrame and that sort of

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.560 
for weaving and macrame and that sort of
thing<00:01:46.890> so<00:01:47.220> it's<00:01:47.340> already<00:01:47.490> pretty<00:01:47.850> soft<00:01:48.210> and

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
thing so it's already pretty soft and

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.210 
thing so it's already pretty soft and
you're<00:01:48.659> not<00:01:48.689> going<00:01:48.869> to<00:01:48.960> get<00:01:49.079> those<00:01:49.860> annoying

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
you're not going to get those annoying

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.100 
you're not going to get those annoying
splinter<00:01:51.000> kinds<00:01:51.270> of<00:01:51.360> thing

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
splinter kinds of thing

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.610 
splinter kinds of thing
the<00:01:53.110> beating<00:01:53.650> twice<00:01:53.800> is<00:01:54.450> obviously<00:01:55.620> handy

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:56.620 
the beating twice is obviously handy

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.580 
the beating twice is obviously handy
when<00:01:56.770> you're<00:01:56.890> beating<00:01:57.580> because<00:01:58.590> something

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
when you're beating because something

when you're beating because something
that<00:01:59.620> if<00:01:59.950> you've<00:02:00.160> made<00:02:00.940> a<00:02:00.970> good<00:02:01.090> amount<00:02:01.300> of

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420 
that if you've made a good amount of

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.450 
that if you've made a good amount of
jewelry<00:02:01.870> you've<00:02:02.080> undoubtedly<00:02:02.620> experienced

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460 
jewelry you've undoubtedly experienced

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.560 
jewelry you've undoubtedly experienced
by<00:02:03.580> now<00:02:03.760> is<00:02:04.530> that<00:02:05.530> a<00:02:05.560> lot<00:02:05.890> of<00:02:05.920> the

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
by now is that a lot of the

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.419 
by now is that a lot of the
coolest-looking<00:02:07.570> beads<00:02:08.020> don't<00:02:08.890> work<00:02:09.130> with

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
coolest-looking beads don't work with

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:12.480 
coolest-looking beads don't work with
because<00:02:10.270> it's<00:02:10.570> simply<00:02:10.869> too<00:02:11.020> big<00:02:11.050> and<00:02:11.490> this

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.490 
because it's simply too big and this

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:15.090 
because it's simply too big and this
I've<00:02:13.450> been<00:02:13.750> going<00:02:13.990> back<00:02:14.110> and<00:02:14.170> forth<00:02:14.380> on<00:02:14.710> what

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.100 
I've been going back and forth on what

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.610 
I've been going back and forth on what
the<00:02:15.250> heck<00:02:15.400> it<00:02:15.520> is<00:02:15.640> I<00:02:15.930> think<00:02:16.930> it's<00:02:17.140> it's<00:02:17.560> just

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
the heck it is I think it's it's just

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.080 
the heck it is I think it's it's just
unbleached<00:02:18.310> undyed<00:02:19.030> hemp<00:02:19.660> twine<00:02:20.080> and<00:02:21.090> this

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
unbleached undyed hemp twine and this

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.230 
unbleached undyed hemp twine and this
this<00:02:22.690> stuff<00:02:22.959> right<00:02:23.110> here<00:02:23.170> I<00:02:23.670> think<00:02:24.670> that<00:02:24.730> it

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:25.240 
this stuff right here I think that it

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.150 
this stuff right here I think that it
naturally<00:02:26.140> we<00:02:26.260> think<00:02:26.500> that<00:02:26.530> this<00:02:26.709> is<00:02:26.770> how<00:02:27.010> it

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
naturally we think that this is how it

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:28.680 
naturally we think that this is how it
looks<00:02:27.190> after<00:02:27.610> they<00:02:27.850> process<00:02:28.240> it<00:02:28.390> but<00:02:28.540> this<00:02:28.630> is

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
looks after they process it but this is

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.600 
looks after they process it but this is
actually<00:02:28.959> bleached<00:02:29.410> and<00:02:29.680> dyed<00:02:29.950> to<00:02:30.250> look<00:02:30.430> this

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
actually bleached and dyed to look this

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.570 
actually bleached and dyed to look this
way<00:02:30.670> I<00:02:31.080> guess<00:02:32.080> is<00:02:32.230> that<00:02:32.260> otherwise<00:02:32.680> would<00:02:33.430> look

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
way I guess is that otherwise would look

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.380 
way I guess is that otherwise would look
like<00:02:33.700> this<00:02:33.850> guy<00:02:34.030> over<00:02:34.150> here<00:02:35.670> other<00:02:36.670> things<00:02:37.030> to

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
like this guy over here other things to

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.760 
like this guy over here other things to
know<00:02:37.570> the<00:02:38.880> the<00:02:39.880> twine<00:02:40.630> is<00:02:41.140> measured<00:02:41.530> as<00:02:41.650> I

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.770 
know the the twine is measured as I

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:43.410 
know the the twine is measured as I
already<00:02:41.920> mentioned<00:02:42.040> a<00:02:42.400> little<00:02:42.520> bit<00:02:42.670> in<00:02:42.970> the

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
already mentioned a little bit in the

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.920 
already mentioned a little bit in the
20-pound<00:02:43.930> 48<00:02:44.620> and<00:02:44.860> I<00:02:45.250> believe<00:02:45.430> this<00:02:45.580> is<00:02:45.720> 160<00:02:46.720> or

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
20-pound 48 and I believe this is 160 or

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.100 
20-pound 48 and I believe this is 160 or
something<00:02:47.260> around<00:02:47.350> there<00:02:47.620> and<00:02:48.209> I<00:02:49.209> believe

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
something around there and I believe

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:51.479 
something around there and I believe
that<00:02:50.140> the<00:02:50.470> reason<00:02:50.709> they<00:02:50.800> call<00:02:50.950> it<00:02:51.010> whatever

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
that the reason they call it whatever

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:53.190 
that the reason they call it whatever
whatever<00:02:51.880> pound<00:02:52.300> is<00:02:52.630> because<00:02:52.930> that's<00:02:53.080> how

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
whatever pound is because that's how

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.870 
whatever pound is because that's how
much<00:02:53.320> of<00:02:53.350> a<00:02:53.500> pound<00:02:53.709> of<00:02:53.830> test<00:02:54.160> it<00:02:54.459> can<00:02:54.580> handle

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
much of a pound of test it can handle

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.199 
much of a pound of test it can handle
but<00:02:55.420> you'll<00:02:55.780> also<00:02:55.959> see<00:02:56.260> it<00:02:56.350> as<00:02:56.530> 20<00:02:57.430> number<00:02:57.700> 48

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 
but you'll also see it as 20 number 48

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:02.250 
but you'll also see it as 20 number 48
number<00:02:58.540> etc<00:02:59.110> and<00:02:59.590> the<00:03:00.519> the<00:03:00.970> cord<00:03:01.239> is<00:03:01.780> measured

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
number etc and the the cord is measured

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.410 
number etc and the the cord is measured
in<00:03:02.350> millimeters<00:03:02.739> so<00:03:03.220> this<00:03:03.850> one<00:03:04.030> right<00:03:04.150> here<00:03:04.209> is

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
in millimeters so this one right here is

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.870 
in millimeters so this one right here is
one<00:03:05.410> millimeter<00:03:05.830> this<00:03:06.070> one's<00:03:06.250> two<00:03:06.459> millimeter

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
one millimeter this one's two millimeter

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.320 
one millimeter this one's two millimeter
chord<00:03:07.090> and<00:03:07.900> I've<00:03:08.080> noticed<00:03:08.410> that<00:03:08.910> the<00:03:09.910> one

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:10.330 
chord and I've noticed that the one

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:12.600 
chord and I've noticed that the one
millimeter<00:03:10.870> hemp<00:03:11.110> accord<00:03:11.440> is<00:03:12.100> pretty<00:03:12.489> much

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610 
millimeter hemp accord is pretty much

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.590 
millimeter hemp accord is pretty much
the<00:03:12.670> same<00:03:12.970> size<00:03:13.269> as<00:03:13.600> the<00:03:13.630> 48<00:03:14.320> number<00:03:14.680> twine<00:03:15.250> and

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
the same size as the 48 number twine and

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.770 
the same size as the 48 number twine and
this<00:03:17.010> two<00:03:18.010> millimeters<00:03:18.519> presumably<00:03:19.480> the<00:03:19.630> same

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
this two millimeters presumably the same

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.250 
this two millimeters presumably the same
size<00:03:20.019> as<00:03:20.290> the<00:03:21.090> 90<00:03:22.090> I<00:03:22.269> guess<00:03:22.480> it<00:03:22.600> would<00:03:22.720> be<00:03:22.750> 96

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
size as the 90 I guess it would be 96

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:24.660 
size as the 90 I guess it would be 96
although<00:03:23.590> I've<00:03:23.680> never<00:03:23.830> actually<00:03:24.040> seen<00:03:24.310> that

although I've never actually seen that
