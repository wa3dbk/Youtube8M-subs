bright things on rainy days so of course

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.350 
bright things on rainy days so of course
I<00:04:57.440> had<00:04:57.590> to<00:04:57.680> choose<00:04:57.890> a<00:04:57.950> bright<00:04:58.430> red<00:04:58.670> skirt<00:04:59.120> and

00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.360 
I had to choose a bright red skirt and

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.300 
I had to choose a bright red skirt and
then<00:04:59.930> I<00:04:59.960> just<00:05:00.200> paired<00:05:00.440> that<00:05:00.590> with<00:05:00.650> a<00:05:01.010> white

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:01.310 
then I just paired that with a white

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:03.550 
then I just paired that with a white
lace<00:05:01.670> top<00:05:02.060> this<00:05:02.360> is<00:05:02.450> just<00:05:02.630> a<00:05:02.720> really<00:05:02.930> fun<00:05:03.050> like

lace top this is just a really fun like
girly<00:05:04.100> piece<00:05:04.400> and<00:05:04.730> I<00:05:04.970> think<00:05:05.210> lace<00:05:05.420> never<00:05:05.780> goes

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:05.990 
girly piece and I think lace never goes

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:07.990 
girly piece and I think lace never goes
out<00:05:06.140> of<00:05:06.170> style<00:05:06.290> so<00:05:07.190> I'm<00:05:07.430> just<00:05:07.580> wearing<00:05:07.790> that

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:08.000

tucked<00:05:08.300> into<00:05:08.600> the<00:05:08.840> skirt<00:05:09.140> and<00:05:09.850> it's<00:05:10.850> pretty

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:11.090 
tucked into the skirt and it's pretty

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:12.940 
tucked into the skirt and it's pretty
impossible<00:05:11.360> to<00:05:11.780> wear<00:05:11.870> skirts<00:05:12.140> and<00:05:12.350> dresses<00:05:12.500> on

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:12.950 
impossible to wear skirts and dresses on

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:15.190
