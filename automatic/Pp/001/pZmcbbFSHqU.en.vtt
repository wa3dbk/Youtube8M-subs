like<00:01:31.240> they<00:01:31.329> didn't<00:01:31.600> normal<00:01:31.959> for<00:01:32.139> two<00:01:32.380> or<00:01:32.709> a

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:32.969 
like they didn't normal for two or a

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:36.480 
like they didn't normal for two or a
code<00:01:33.969> to<00:01:34.090> be<00:01:34.179> for<00:01:34.709> me<00:01:35.709> personally<00:01:35.740> I<00:01:36.340> believe

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
code to be for me personally I believe

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.539 
code to be for me personally I believe
that<00:01:36.789> it<00:01:37.060> takes<00:01:37.240> skill<00:01:37.479> in<00:01:37.810> this<00:01:37.959> game<00:01:38.549> which

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:39.549 
that it takes skill in this game which

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:41.160 
that it takes skill in this game which
is<00:01:39.579> why<00:01:39.939> they<00:01:40.209> got<00:01:40.389> rid<00:01:40.420> of<00:01:40.599> stopping<00:01:41.049> power

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 
is why they got rid of stopping power

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.209 
is why they got rid of stopping power
and<00:01:41.499> I<00:01:41.859> have<00:01:42.069> no<00:01:42.369> idea<00:01:42.549> how<00:01:43.090> we<00:01:43.270> got<00:01:43.599> that<00:01:43.630> Gil

that<00:05:11.560> the<00:05:12.130> killstreaks<00:05:13.000> aren't<00:05:13.360> as<00:05:13.600> powerful

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:14.169 
that the killstreaks aren't as powerful

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:17.040 
that the killstreaks aren't as powerful
as<00:05:14.290> they<00:05:14.380> were<00:05:14.500> Ramon<00:05:14.830> refer<00:05:15.130> to<00:05:15.419> like<00:05:16.419> I<00:05:16.690> would

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:17.050 
as they were Ramon refer to like I would

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:20.490 
as they were Ramon refer to like I would
like<00:05:17.460> the<00:05:18.460> dogs<00:05:18.700> I've<00:05:19.060> had<00:05:19.300> like<00:05:19.570> the<00:05:19.690> dogs<00:05:19.900> not

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:20.500 
like the dogs I've had like the dogs not

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.909 
like the dogs I've had like the dogs not
that<00:05:20.710> many<00:05:20.860> times<00:05:21.130> in<00:05:21.310> black<00:05:21.490> ops<00:05:21.700> when<00:05:22.510> I<00:05:22.630> do

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:28.360 
they don't do jection and I think that's

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:30.210 
they don't do jection and I think that's
only<00:05:28.570> because<00:05:28.810> oh<00:05:29.200> he<00:05:29.350> got<00:05:29.470> nailed<00:05:29.680> by<00:05:29.890> me<00:05:30.070> oh
