00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 yes i should be you again warm 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:06.660
 welcome to the video recording 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.099
 channel and today again a look 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.269
 on two this time a round 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:13.950
 reign of the fair ray media 94 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:15.240
 and yes, what did I like to tell me ? 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.490
 I played with the drone with the 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.410
 watchman around with the lightning stroke went all the way 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.320
 Good off and pretty much in the beginning 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.699
 good until his opponents are chained off so off 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.199
 34 minutes 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.840
 they were german ones i have too 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.420
 recognized and yes I've had at the end 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.349
 I'm 26 3 or so it's a yellowish one 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.020
 is not the best 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.610
 But I had set up my computer 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.630
 because I have a new hard drive off and on 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.730
 So I did not have anything anymore 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.770
 saved and I intend to do that 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.210
 Recently first plays because black ops 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:48.800
 solemnly installed and cs cooperate 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:51.030
 kay do you bring your round black ops 26 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.379
 I said I promised you once 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.239
 that days when I come in again 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.410
 then counter out other gameplay 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.210
 but it does not necessarily have to 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.219
 always be such a thing because the 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.430
 Most of a not so as on comments 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.739
 on the gameplay in any case of it 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.979
 again cod go and although I came on 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:10.860
 first may the new trailer to cds is called 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:13.200
 once more fire and i was just up 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.640
 the janet of correction you because I once 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.920
 wanted to know how many people have become 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.540
 meanwhile alone the trailer on the 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.189
 official channel looked at and it 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.220
 were or are currently 14 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:25.430
 million 600,000 and that's it 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.979
 considerable number 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:30.960
 because I was tall as 100 because cod 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.119
 Not so the hit and many people 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.860
 are now switched to battlefield too 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.630
 cisco if more and more educators sco 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.369
 players almost no longer go for the game 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:43.340
 or you play the old parts like 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:45.570
 black on 232 and so on and yes good 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.710
 14 6 million clicks alone on the 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.240
 official channel and then the 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:53.130
 have advised other youtube 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.930
 really blatantly and I just wanted to 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.530
 to my opinion about the trailer has 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.299
 tell 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.790
 you have to say it by the trailer 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:01.170
 quality very simply optimal but so 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.350
 what can you expect when 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.149
 You do advertising here for a game 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.829
 you have seen so well me has 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.420
 I really like it but I want it now 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.710
 do not stand out in this scheme as the 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.270
 1 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:13.010
 others and the sand says that we 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.810
 really shit and it will be 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.590
 worse than jerseys yes I take it 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.330
 very relaxed 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.460
 I'll take a look at the trailer or 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.110
 the videos are going to come again and again 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:23.510
 then look but is nannys pick 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.070
 if you do not even wait because of it 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:28.520
 currently gives the say rolls through the 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:32.600
 shit trailer is the style of her looks 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:35.000
 so expand something vollpappe vote 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.620
 the features where you for example at the 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.060
 but wall can climb or where you can 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.180
 can jump relatively far 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:43.400
 I do not have it like that right now 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:45.410
 analyzed like some others but on 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.640
 any case it should or looks like that 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.720
 in the future school has become easy 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.420
 a pity 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.830
 because the hopelessly throwing I know 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.560
 it just does not feel like it 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:56.030
 you have to wait and you can wait 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.770
 do not say much about it 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.510
 and in any case, because I just go 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:00.950
 ask who of you if you have seen 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.050
 I think most or 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.810
 maybe even everybody and what you're up to 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:06.590
 Keep it up now but write mine 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.960
 comments because we first 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.370
 interest and one or the other 

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:11.750
 maybe noticed and that is my vote 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.250
 sounds a bit strange 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.900
 I mentioned earlier I have one 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.890
 bought new hard disk that is also called 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.350
 everything newly installed operating system 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:19.610
 and so on I am from windows 8 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:21.350
 converted windows 7 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:25.450
 quite simply from windows 8 is not 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:27.410
 and when he felt better and 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:30.020
 so I have anything for you again 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:31.430
 hereby set his options microphone 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:33.350
 has everything possible 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:36.500
 that's why I'm not surprised my voice 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:38.600
 is funny sounds yes I have to now 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.950
 first set everything and the days 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.820
 if I give you your comment as 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:42.820
 should be again 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:44.870
 At least I hope to work 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:45.470
 otherwise it was the first of mine 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.480
 side 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:49.490
 I was only the longest comments 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.830
 but i will promise you the days 

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:54.590
 will come longer videos and it 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:56.150
 would also be a defining theme in the 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:58.850
 comments are addressed because of 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:01.700
 my channel and so on but first 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:02.540
 wait for tea and so on 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.890
 Of course I hope that the video 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.030
 If so, I would be pleased 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:07.310
 if the video is a thumbs up 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:08.960
 would go and still such a short one 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:12.050
 information to the whole people the 

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:15.380
 or have my first steam account 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:17.600
 my main account in the second act if 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:19.250
 pcs want to play ko because on the first 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:22.160
 I would not have any or 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:23.600
 No subscribers because Michael already 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.450
 I have enough people and I can only people 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:28.670
 I work with you 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:30.620
 know private or with not so already 

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:32.390
 That's why my time was up 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:34.460
 the second was the idea is in the 

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:37.870
 description and I always say servus
