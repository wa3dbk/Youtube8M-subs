simple most of the time you can find

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.840 
simple most of the time you can find
these<00:00:18.779> two<00:00:19.170> things<00:00:19.380> any<00:00:19.890> time<00:00:20.130> of<00:00:20.279> the<00:00:20.310> year<00:00:20.520> so

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
these two things any time of the year so

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.970 
these two things any time of the year so
there's<00:00:21.270> nothing<00:00:21.539> seasonal<00:00:21.960> about<00:00:22.199> it<00:00:22.380> but

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
there's nothing seasonal about it but

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.790 
there's nothing seasonal about it but
it's<00:00:23.160> just<00:00:23.189> a<00:00:23.369> nice<00:00:23.550> homey<00:00:24.180> dish<00:00:24.900> hmm

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
it's just a nice homey dish hmm

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.349 
it's just a nice homey dish hmm
so<00:00:26.070> what<00:00:26.220> we've<00:00:26.340> done<00:00:26.490> is<00:00:26.699> we've<00:00:27.029> actually

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
so what we've done is we've actually

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.519 
so what we've done is we've actually
washed<00:00:27.840> and<00:00:28.250> cut<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.490> beans<00:00:30.109> so<00:00:31.109> the<00:00:31.320> size

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
washed and cut the beans so the size

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.049 
washed and cut the beans so the size
really<00:00:31.859> depends<00:00:32.340> on<00:00:32.399> you<00:00:32.579> what<00:00:32.730> you<00:00:32.850> want<00:00:33.000> to

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
size and again adjustable to taste if

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.729 
size and again adjustable to taste if
