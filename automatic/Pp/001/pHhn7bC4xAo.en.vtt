you<00:01:32.759> drop<00:01:32.970> them<00:01:33.090> in<00:01:33.270> could<00:01:34.229> help<00:01:34.470> but<00:01:34.799> I<00:01:34.979> think

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
you drop them in could help but I think

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.749 
you drop them in could help but I think
title<00:01:35.640> really<00:01:36.060> should<00:01:36.270> that<00:01:36.479> if<00:01:36.570> we<00:01:37.759> drove

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
title really should that if we drove

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.840 
title really should that if we drove
them<00:01:38.939> in<00:01:39.030> okay<00:01:39.990> anyway<00:01:40.380> look<00:01:40.640> that's<00:01:41.640> now

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
them in okay anyway look that's now

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.200 
them in okay anyway look that's now
written<00:01:42.119> so<00:01:42.780> there<00:01:43.409> is<00:01:43.439> my<00:01:43.890> next<00:01:44.399> step<00:01:44.520> is<00:01:44.880> to

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
written so there is my next step is to

enormous time for this to to process
it's<00:02:35.930> only<00:02:36.080> 14<00:02:36.500> seconds<00:02:36.950> I<00:02:37.900> can't<00:02:38.900> they<00:02:39.110> are

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.320 
it's only 14 seconds I can't they are

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.160 
it's only 14 seconds I can't they are
now<00:02:39.620> if<00:02:39.709> you<00:02:39.800> go<00:02:39.920> to<00:02:39.980> a<00:02:40.250> movie<00:02:40.540> will<00:02:41.540> say<00:02:41.810> for

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
now if you go to a movie will say for

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:47.800 
now if you go to a movie will say for
this<00:02:42.260> the<00:02:42.650> videos<00:02:42.950> in<00:02:43.160> there<00:02:44.800> ok<00:02:46.239> right<00:02:47.239> and

out to project window and just to prove

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:02.050 
out to project window and just to prove
that<00:02:58.940> this<00:02:59.209> is<00:03:00.130> this<00:03:01.130> has<00:03:01.280> gone<00:03:01.459> through<00:03:01.790> I'm

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
probably the slightly more boring part

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.040 
probably the slightly more boring part
but<00:03:41.000> i<00:03:41.060> just<00:03:41.269> want<00:03:41.420> to<00:03:41.450> show<00:03:41.660> you<00:03:41.720> what<00:03:41.959> is

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:47.239 
actually happening just for the sake of

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:52.449 
actually happening just for the sake of
interest<00:03:47.660> really<00:03:48.220> ok<00:03:50.200> when<00:03:51.200> the<00:03:51.350> man's<00:03:52.220> that

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:52.459 
interest really ok when the man's that

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:54.490 
interest really ok when the man's that
disk<00:03:52.640> image<00:03:52.910> was<00:03:53.090> being<00:03:53.480> effect<00:03:53.900> is<00:03:54.080> changing

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500 
disk image was being effect is changing

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:59.110 
disk image was being effect is changing
into<00:03:54.830> a<00:03:55.069> video<00:03:56.060> TS<00:03:56.450> far<00:03:56.720> and<00:03:57.280> so<00:03:58.280> actually

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
into a video TS far and so actually

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:00.670 
into a video TS far and so actually
basically<00:03:59.330> you<00:03:59.630> could<00:03:59.780> open<00:04:00.019> them<00:04:00.200> with

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 
basically you could open them with

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.280 
basically you could open them with
anything<00:04:01.330> or<00:04:02.330> you<00:04:02.390> can<00:04:02.690> burn<00:04:02.870> it<00:04:03.019> straight

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 
anything or you can burn it straight

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:06.250 
anything or you can burn it straight

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:09.620 
only by moving the local that and the

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:12.490 
only by moving the local that and the
other<00:04:09.680> thing<00:04:09.830> that<00:04:10.010> I<00:04:10.160> wanted<00:04:10.430> to<00:04:11.470> show<00:04:12.470> you

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.500 
other thing that I wanted to show you

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.430 
other thing that I wanted to show you
just<00:04:12.769> really<00:04:13.069> briefly<00:04:13.250> as<00:04:13.700> that<00:04:14.260> there<00:04:15.260> is<00:04:15.319> in

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:15.440 
just really briefly as that there is in

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.630 
just really briefly as that there is in
fact<00:04:15.470> a<00:04:15.950> player<00:04:17.049> or<00:04:18.049> it<00:04:18.289> comes<00:04:18.560> with<00:04:18.829> a<00:04:18.859> with

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:19.640 
fact a player or it comes with a with

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:22.950 
fact a player or it comes with a with
the<00:04:19.669> video<00:04:20.000> player<00:04:20.299> that<00:04:21.169> will<00:04:21.289> take<00:04:21.620> these

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
the video player that will take these

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.900 
the video player that will take these
AVCHD<00:04:23.960> fires<00:04:24.470> it's<00:04:24.740> actually<00:04:25.070> you<00:04:25.550> know<00:04:25.669> a

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:25.910 
AVCHD fires it's actually you know a

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:30.969 
AVCHD fires it's actually you know a
very<00:04:26.630> good<00:04:27.729> plan<00:04:28.729> so<00:04:29.270> this<00:04:30.260> slightly<00:04:30.590> slightly

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:30.979 
very good plan so this slightly slightly

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:35.170 
very good plan so this slightly slightly
jumping<00:04:31.490> but<00:04:33.310> I'm<00:04:34.310> kind<00:04:34.550> of<00:04:34.580> assuming<00:04:34.729> that

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:35.180 
jumping but I'm kind of assuming that

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:36.610 
jumping but I'm kind of assuming that
that's<00:04:35.300> because<00:04:35.690> I've<00:04:35.810> got<00:04:35.990> other<00:04:36.169> programs

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:36.620 
that's because I've got other programs

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:40.390 
that's because I've got other programs
running<00:04:36.890> but<00:04:37.160> and<00:04:38.530> at<00:04:39.530> least<00:04:39.710> you<00:04:39.919> can<00:04:40.070> get<00:04:40.250> to

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:40.400 
running but and at least you can get to

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.210 
running but and at least you can get to
preview<00:04:40.760> your<00:04:41.350> your<00:04:42.350> videos<00:04:42.740> before<00:04:42.950> you

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:43.220 
preview your your videos before you

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:47.040 
preview your your videos before you
actually<00:04:43.400> put<00:04:43.850> them<00:04:43.970> in<00:04:44.090> to<00:04:44.479> be<00:04:45.260> edited<00:04:45.410> ok<00:04:46.310> so

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.050 
actually put them in to be edited ok so

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:50.110 
actually put them in to be edited ok so
that's<00:04:48.050> gone<00:04:48.530> on<00:04:48.560> a<00:04:48.680> bit<00:04:48.890> longer<00:04:49.010> than<00:04:49.310> I<00:04:49.430> hoped

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.120 
that's gone on a bit longer than I hoped

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.180 
that's gone on a bit longer than I hoped
that<00:04:50.270> it<00:04:50.419> would<00:04:50.450> I<00:04:51.140> hope<00:04:51.410> that's<00:04:51.680> been<00:04:51.860> of<00:04:51.919> some

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:52.190 
that it would I hope that's been of some

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:56.410 
that it would I hope that's been of some
help<00:04:52.250> to<00:04:52.490> somebody<00:04:52.970> and<00:04:53.360> that's<00:04:54.200> that
