00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:05.549
 hello youtube hello dear subscribers 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.370
 here is again all kinds of today 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.469
 another xbox and tutorial and 2 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.889
 it will be possible from june 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:15.690
 with the new dashboard update external 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.010
 to be able to operate hard disks 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.240
 also slow time with the one or 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.039
 others will have space with them 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.810
 slowly dying as they mine 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.019
 case is I still have 22 percent free 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.599
 on the internal hard drive so i had 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.130
 worried me then once a wd elements 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.710
 with a terabyte space 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.380
 if you are the first time at the xbox 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.670
 should connect then this appears 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.770
 bild what we see in the background now 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.149
 of course, here in English, of course 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.700
 that will probably be finished 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.890
 june update will be Germanized and 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.570
 We now press first next so now 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.280
 we can get out of external we can 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.059
 either change the name or we 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.219
 can keep 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:56.670
 I say no, I'm doing hd dts hd 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:57.180
 1 and then we go on and now 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.890
 he says 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.329
 All new stuff should be on this 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.070
 hard disk to be installed i would like 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.809
 I do not want to leave it like that 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.519
 it is currently want to choose for yourself 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.860
 but we can do that later in 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.820
 settings system managed all this 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.780
 I we can show you right yet 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.000
 to change that at any time 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.130
 we want to let that happen now, of course 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
 that we format the hard drive that 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.729
 we will let 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.290
 we want to use it very much 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.670
 not too long is relatively fixed and 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.740
 then it will be shown below and already 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.869
 yeah it's already that 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.729
 Hard disk external memory is ready 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.590
 We then press our guide button 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.750
 go straight to the hard drive and 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.860
 there is nothing there that is natural 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.340
 no problem is we can now 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.200
 up here at storage device hdd 1 can 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.640
 we select 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.189
 internal hard disk or our radio 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.130
 be1 the external we go now 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.960
 the internal and then we see everything 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.970
 on the internal installed in my 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.829
 case it's a few games and us 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.259
 are going to do that with one right now 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:57.630
 app try as we go up again 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:59.009
 the hdd ahlens are internal and 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.320
 then there will be the internal 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.719
 program displayed we would like now 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.189
 like to manage youtube that is 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.710
 we press on youtube now the 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:10.850
 menu button 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:13.280
 say then manage app here and now 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:15.650
 we can say up here above the app 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.850
 internally stands all manage 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.910
 we can go on it now and 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:21.170
 say all move all copy 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.880
 uninstall all 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.140
 we do not want to move that now 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.360
 because otherwise it will be from the internal 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:29.900
 hard disk of course erased thus 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:32.300
 say, please copy it and say 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:36.880
 hdd 1 exactly he gives it to us, so to speak 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.880
 Just before and just copy &amp; go ahead 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.260
 takes a smaller look then comes 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.880
 on the right, the status exactly and thus have 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.760
 we now almost the youtube app on the 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:50.180
 external hard drive our hdd 1 and up 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.769
 Internal the extent to which 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:55.330
 Of course, it also works 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:03:00.650
 I give out again'll go above 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:03.170
 Let's say the games say that 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:06.200
 not so big right now we're taking it 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:08.450
 times the first golf say here now 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:11.989
 plays manage the same principle over the 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:14.900
 apps 3 8 gb press here again 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:16.810
 of course, the menu button says in here 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.040
 The case is not correct yet 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.720
 says it translated because it stops in the 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.400
 beta-status is everything but we can 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.010
 realize that this should be the copy 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.769
 of course, press on kobe here to say 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:30.290
 on the external hdd because he tells us 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:31.970
 because it will be possible two 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.299
 operate at the same time later 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:33.980
 can 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:37.070
 I have only one here because of that 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.760
 only with a copy so that will be something 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:38.959
 take longer 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.510
 so I will now cut a 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:46.690
 and then the end of then 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:46.690
 then simply put video to it 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:53.860
 while the game is playing on the external 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:55.720
 hard disk copies word or will show 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.460
 I here you gave it as short as you do 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.590
 could manage memory and two goes 

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:01.870
 here in the system there on memory 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:03.370
 manage and store below 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:05.980
 manage sees once the internal 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:12.550
 hard disk and of course the external one 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:16.030
 hard drive and here we are back at 97 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:18.430
 98 90 100 percent and poster golf became 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:23.410
 successful on the external led one 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:26.260
 copied so that now you have to 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:27.550
 I just need that, I hope 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:31.270
 you liked it is a tutorial 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:32.890
 but you can always do that too 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:36.400
 hard disk from pinching it is a friend 

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:37.600
 hangs her there of course lures then 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.160
 your gamertag 1 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.350
 and there you can all your games with 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.640
 also play your friend if that is yours 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:46.560
 like to have thumb thumbs down 

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:46.560
 up there let out new approach
