fingers and color here is chrome by
Jared's

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
Jared's

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.840 
Jared's
right<00:03:05.190> okay<00:03:05.940> so<00:03:06.630> the<00:03:06.750> black<00:03:07.220> it's<00:03:08.220> exactly<00:03:08.670> the

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
right okay so the black it's exactly the

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.569 
right okay so the black it's exactly the
same<00:03:09.060> just<00:03:09.900> a<00:03:10.079> in<00:03:10.500> white<00:03:10.680> wizard<00:03:10.859> driver<00:03:11.160> back

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:11.579 
same just a in white wizard driver back

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:14.870 
same just a in white wizard driver back
color<00:03:12.299> is<00:03:12.630> darker<00:03:13.109> but<00:03:14.010> these<00:03:14.190> symbols<00:03:14.670> are

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
color is darker but these symbols are

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:19.699 
color is darker but these symbols are
all<00:03:15.060> the<00:03:15.180> same<00:03:15.470> okay<00:03:16.880> so<00:03:17.880> now<00:03:18.359> let's<00:03:18.930> switch<00:03:19.320> on

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
all the same okay so now let's switch on

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:21.440 
all the same okay so now let's switch on
the<00:03:20.100> white<00:03:20.310> wizard<00:03:20.549> drivers<00:03:21.000> and<00:03:21.239> City

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
the white wizard drivers and City

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.820 
the white wizard drivers and City
switches<00:03:21.959> and<00:03:22.140> open

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:25.830 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:32.280 

okay<00:03:29.850> okay<00:03:30.850> so<00:03:31.150> the<00:03:31.270> activation<00:03:31.720> noise<00:03:32.050> has

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
okay okay so the activation noise has

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.220 
okay okay so the activation noise has
changed<00:03:32.830> since<00:03:33.670> see<00:03:33.940> for<00:03:34.210> me<00:03:34.330> what<00:03:34.540> the<00:03:34.840> origin

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
changed since see for me what the origin

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:41.240 
changed since see for me what the origin
of<00:03:35.320> is<00:03:35.530> a<00:03:35.560> driver<00:03:35.860> the<00:03:36.010> activation<00:03:36.640> is<00:03:36.820> this

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.740 

okay<00:03:42.250> so<00:03:42.310> let's<00:03:42.670> change<00:03:42.820> from<00:03:43.030> a<00:03:43.150> dragon<00:03:43.510> rod

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
okay so let's change from a dragon rod

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:52.710 
okay so let's change from a dragon rod
with<00:03:43.930> this<00:03:44.170> let's<00:03:45.070> listen<00:03:45.790> it<00:03:45.910> again<00:03:51.390> okay<00:03:52.390> so

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 
with this let's listen it again okay so

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.070 
with this let's listen it again okay so
now<00:03:52.900> let's<00:03:53.230> take<00:03:53.530> a<00:03:53.680> look<00:03:53.800> at<00:03:53.980> the<00:03:54.100> ring

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:55.080 
now let's take a look at the ring

00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:00.060 
now let's take a look at the ring
very<00:03:56.080> nice<00:03:56.710> the<00:03:56.980> reading<00:03:58.260> so<00:03:59.260> it's<00:03:59.530> like<00:03:59.890> if

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:00.070 
very nice the reading so it's like if

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:01.950 
very nice the reading so it's like if
reverse<00:04:00.640> wizard<00:04:01.030> rings<00:04:01.300> you<00:04:01.480> can<00:04:01.660> flick

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:01.960 
reverse wizard rings you can flick

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:05.670 
reverse wizard rings you can flick
device<00:04:02.410> up<00:04:02.770> and<00:04:02.950> down<00:04:03.090> to<00:04:04.090> Hansen<00:04:04.570> okay<00:04:04.750> and

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
device up and down to Hansen okay and

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.920 
device up and down to Hansen okay and
this<00:04:05.890> is<00:04:06.100> discovering<00:04:06.790> this<00:04:07.480> is<00:04:07.720> the

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:07.930 
this is discovering this is the

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:10.730 
this is discovering this is the
explosion<00:04:08.620> rings<00:04:08.920> can<00:04:09.340> see<00:04:09.520> this<00:04:09.700> captain

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:10.740 
explosion rings can see this captain

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:13.770 
explosion rings can see this captain
explosion<00:04:11.740> and<00:04:11.980> I<00:04:12.520> believe<00:04:13.120> this<00:04:13.300> are<00:04:13.600> the

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.780 
explosion and I believe this are the

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.140 
explosion and I believe this are the
white<00:04:14.230> wizard<00:04:14.470> eyes<00:04:14.830> it<00:04:15.370> kinda<00:04:15.670> looks<00:04:15.910> like<00:04:16.000> it

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 
white wizard eyes it kinda looks like it

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:20.670 
white wizard eyes it kinda looks like it
okay<00:04:16.930> so<00:04:17.160> and<00:04:18.160> this<00:04:18.580> color<00:04:19.540> is<00:04:19.690> a<00:04:20.109> bit<00:04:20.260> orange

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 
okay so and this color is a bit orange

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.940 
okay so and this color is a bit orange
color<00:04:21.010> that<00:04:21.130> you<00:04:21.489> were<00:04:21.930> so<00:04:22.930> now<00:04:23.170> let's<00:04:23.440> test<00:04:23.710> it

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:23.950 
color that you were so now let's test it

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:27.540 
color that you were so now let's test it
only<00:04:24.370> white<00:04:24.610> wizard<00:04:24.940> drive<00:04:26.550> knowledge

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:27.550 
only white wizard drive knowledge

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:47.310 
only white wizard drive knowledge
session

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:47.320 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:50.770 

they<00:04:48.320> basically<00:04:48.680> is<00:04:49.070> tension<00:04:50.030> that<00:04:50.330> the

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:50.780 
they basically is tension that the

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:54.250 
they basically is tension that the
melody<00:04:51.650> is<00:04:51.950> also<00:04:52.310> changed<00:04:52.670> do<00:04:53.480> a<00:04:53.510> faster<00:04:54.080> and

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:54.260 
melody is also changed do a faster and

00:04:54.260 --> 00:05:13.540 
melody is also changed do a faster and
more<00:04:54.320> hip-hop<00:04:54.830> style<00:05:11.500> hey<00:05:12.500> already<00:05:13.100> I<00:05:13.250> rather

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:13.550 
more hip-hop style hey already I rather

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:49.359 
more hip-hop style hey already I rather
like<00:05:13.820> the<00:05:13.940> Ginga<00:05:14.420> it's<00:05:14.690> very<00:05:15.050> petrol<00:05:15.640> touching

00:05:49.359 --> 00:05:49.369 

00:05:49.369 --> 00:05:52.519 

okay<00:05:50.369> so<00:05:50.429> now<00:05:50.759> enough<00:05:51.089> the<00:05:51.389> white<00:05:51.599> user<00:05:51.779> driver

00:05:52.519 --> 00:05:52.529 
okay so now enough the white user driver

00:05:52.529 --> 00:05:54.949 
okay so now enough the white user driver
I<00:05:52.559> will<00:05:53.189> not<00:05:53.309> test<00:05:53.580> the<00:05:53.729> both<00:05:54.029> of<00:05:54.059> these<00:05:54.389> drinks

00:05:54.949 --> 00:05:54.959 
I will not test the both of these drinks

00:05:54.959 --> 00:05:58.759 
I will not test the both of these drinks
on<00:05:55.259> the<00:05:55.860> original<00:05:56.519> visa<00:05:56.759> driver<00:05:57.349> okay<00:05:58.349> so<00:05:58.409> now

00:05:58.759 --> 00:05:58.769 
on the original visa driver okay so now

00:05:58.769 --> 00:06:25.819 
on the original visa driver okay so now
let's<00:05:58.979> write<00:05:59.249> on<00:05:59.519> a<00:05:59.759> genome<00:06:00.119> is<00:06:00.299> a<00:06:00.329> rubber<00:06:24.829> face

00:06:25.819 --> 00:06:25.829 
let's write on a genome is a rubber face

00:06:25.829 --> 00:06:29.209 
let's write on a genome is a rubber face
obviously<00:06:26.099> it<00:06:26.669> says<00:06:26.909> the<00:06:27.209> origin<00:06:27.869> in<00:06:28.769> the<00:06:28.979> visa

00:06:29.209 --> 00:06:29.219 
obviously it says the origin in the visa

00:06:29.219 --> 00:06:32.389 
obviously it says the origin in the visa
driver<00:06:29.579> so<00:06:30.539> meaning<00:06:31.379> that<00:06:31.529> this<00:06:31.739> is<00:06:31.949> the<00:06:32.099> first

00:06:32.389 --> 00:06:32.399 
driver so meaning that this is the first

00:06:32.399 --> 00:06:35.509 
driver so meaning that this is the first
result<00:06:33.089> that<00:06:33.569> ever<00:06:33.809> existed<00:06:34.529> in<00:06:34.769> the<00:06:34.949> earth<00:06:35.189> I

00:06:35.509 --> 00:06:35.519 
result that ever existed in the earth I

00:06:35.519 --> 00:06:39.259 
result that ever existed in the earth I
think<00:06:36.149> so<00:06:36.599> or<00:06:36.959> this<00:06:37.559> it<00:06:37.889> these<00:06:38.519> are<00:06:38.729> all<00:06:38.759> where

00:06:39.259 --> 00:06:39.269 
think so or this it these are all where

00:06:39.269 --> 00:06:41.869 
think so or this it these are all where
the<00:06:39.509> source<00:06:39.869> of<00:06:40.110> wizards<00:06:40.529> start<00:06:40.829> from<00:06:41.009> start

00:06:41.869 --> 00:06:41.879 
the source of wizards start from start

00:06:41.879 --> 00:06:44.540 
the source of wizards start from start
from<00:06:42.059> this<00:06:42.269> white<00:06:42.539> wizard<00:06:42.779> okay<00:06:43.649> so<00:06:44.219> now<00:06:44.369> let's

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:44.550 
from this white wizard okay so now let's

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:58.160 
from this white wizard okay so now let's
try<00:06:44.699> the<00:06:44.789> explosion<00:06:45.539> ring

00:06:58.160 --> 00:06:58.170 

00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:00.510 

okay<00:06:59.170> so<00:06:59.230> obviously<00:06:59.710> every<00:07:00.100> white<00:07:00.310> wizard

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:00.520 
okay so obviously every white wizard

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:02.940 
okay so obviously every white wizard
ring<00:07:00.940> used<00:07:01.600> in<00:07:01.840> what<00:07:02.140> wizard<00:07:02.590> driveway

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:02.950 
ring used in what wizard driveway

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:05.910 
ring used in what wizard driveway
assessed<00:07:03.340> the<00:07:03.520> origin<00:07:04.120> which<00:07:05.020> is<00:07:05.050> quite<00:07:05.590> cool

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:05.920 
assessed the origin which is quite cool

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:08.460 
assessed the origin which is quite cool
but<00:07:06.270> it's<00:07:07.270> quite<00:07:07.510> sad<00:07:07.750> that<00:07:07.780> the<00:07:08.110> nicely

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:08.470 
but it's quite sad that the nicely

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:10.800 
but it's quite sad that the nicely
standardized<00:07:09.120> okay<00:07:10.120> so<00:07:10.180> enough<00:07:10.630> of<00:07:10.750> the

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:10.810 
standardized okay so enough of the

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:13.740 
standardized okay so enough of the
original<00:07:11.380> wizard<00:07:11.920> driver<00:07:12.220> so<00:07:13.150> now<00:07:13.360> let's<00:07:13.600> take

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:13.750 
original wizard driver so now let's take

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:16.050 
original wizard driver so now let's take
a<00:07:13.810> look<00:07:13.990> back<00:07:14.170> at<00:07:14.380> a<00:07:14.410> white<00:07:14.740> wizard<00:07:14.950> trouble<00:07:15.430> so

a look back at a white wizard trouble so
I'll<00:07:16.300> now<00:07:16.510> conclude<00:07:17.050> that<00:07:17.200> the<00:07:17.680> white<00:07:17.830> wizard

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:18.070
