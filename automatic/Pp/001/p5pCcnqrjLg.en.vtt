00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 hi everyone how about in today's video 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.970
 came again other complete of the 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.040
 back and if you want to know the coast that 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.170
 I bought him then keep watching the video and 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.750
 we started as always the web to be 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.429
 super fast in less than 10 days had 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.470
 the package in my house so great and 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.510
 nothing well pointed out that I bought myself in first 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.010
 place order these matifying papers 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.449
 which are to absorb the fats that you 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.470
 is coming out throughout the day on 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.990
 the whole area especially here 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:29.359
 they are super finite papers and they say 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:31.640
 that are natural to me reminds me 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:34.610
 very much this to the papers of these of 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:37.850
 his hand brings 50,000 birds and the container 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:39.680
 has its cover and is here so 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.660
 only uncomfortable that has being precipitated 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.160
 from here but I think yes to the here 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:47.310
 and took away what is the sticker 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:50.370
 and so I would have a container very much 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:52.110
 more comfortable to carry in your handbag 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.840
 price of matifying papers 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.360
 they were $ 2 with 72 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.820
 another happy highlight was one of my 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.580
 favorite lip balms not for the 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.199
 size or nothing but the taste that 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:06.479
 has the smell that has a grenade is 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:10.620
 I love gods that smell super 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:12.210
 well smells edible pomegranate is that not 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:14.910
 It's a lip balm, as I say 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.550
 Super big and that lasts life not 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:20.820
 this smells also everything you are applying 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:22.470
 very much mind and it spends super fast 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.510
 but as I tell you I was asking for everything 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.509
 for the smell because I love how it tastes 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:29.520
 how it smells 3 a year very hydrated very 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.080
 comfortable feeling of credit and I start to 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.750
 I really like to tell you what it is 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:38.430
 totally organic that is consistent and 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:41.700
 free that brings 425 grams 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.620
 and it costs only 85 cents there's one that 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.650
 is on the web yesterday that this time 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:48.060
 was could I choose something like a 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:49.770
 gift totally free but so 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.870
 seen now can not give it totally 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.729
 free and what they do is that it lowers them in 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:55.710
 the value and for example have this 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.450
 we passed the truth for 50 cents what 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.360
 happens that I asked him for something else that is worth 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.130
 more expensive and decide to pay the 65 cents 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.200
 that is worth the glass rather I like the 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.119
 sweet lip balms on all 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.770
 flavor of the pomegranate you will love 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:11.459
 international and what I chose in the 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:13.200
 free or cheaper section were 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.989
 these two masks here that are 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.959
 these masks of this type that are 

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:21.090
 like little pieces of paper that this one pastes well 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:23.130
 they are impregnated and creamed or something and 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.900
 They bring two masks according to 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:31.100
 contending here one of aloe vera and 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:31.100
 another cucumber and the two big 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:36.390
 this would be aloe vera and I was 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:37.560
 cucumber and I'm looking forward to using it not 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.210
 I used because I wanted to teach 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.860
 packets yes but I 'll tell in 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:42.780
 next videos of finished products 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.760
 my opinion about these masks and the 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.220
 price they put on a mask as I tell you and 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.690
 It cost me 50 cents because I took it in 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.880
 the section with me of the product 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.890
 lowered half modes for free but the 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.830
 normal price of the mask without that 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:58.140
 section would be 2 dollars with 45 only 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:00.330
 we can choose a single product from the 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.950
 graphic products discounted and already only 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.680
 I have to show you three little things more than 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:07.260
 they are three brushes one of them is once 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.240
 I saw new tours, I 've never tried 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:13.680
 viticulture brushes and I wanted to try 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:16.500
 some 776 blending collection on everything 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.480
 in the super famous blog of my country ana 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:21.210
 julia phoenix is one of the brushes that 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:23.010
 more recommends to her so I say by 

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:25.400
 I'm going to try this case julia and I'm going to 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.400
 try them 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:31.940
 he does not use it because he does not have time to 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:36.710
 use it and I wanted to teach you invite 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:39.140
 but it was not seen very 

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:41.780
 you need what we want to do 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:44.660
 everything to blur the shadow 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:46.190
 between the shadow that I think is going to 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:48.290
 like a lot more to blur the 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:50.870
 right it had not been tested by the two 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:53.120
 things and I'll tell you another brooch that 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:55.520
 CCOO asked was this really tours 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.930
 I've asked for two brush marks that 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:59.390
 I had never tried I had not tried 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:01.580
 I still do not come to you from Cotel and this 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:04.459
 is the video because you mentioned these 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:08.620
 brands that I chose from cotur was the 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:12.950
 looks fan that is a style brush 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:15.700
 fan but very dense and the brochita is 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:18.669
 this from here 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:21.370
 the handle is made of wood supposedly 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:23.680
 ccoo tool is very ecological uses 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:25.990
 bamboo wood or something like that from behind 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:28.000
 us by the name engraved 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:32.729
 the video the same in super chocolate 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:35.770
 beautiful with the one from here of ccoo tools 

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:39.249
 this fan of that 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:41.589
 and it's super smooth what is 

00:04:39.249 --> 00:04:44.889
 I loved it I bought it especially 

00:04:41.589 --> 00:04:47.859
 for the contour area to apply 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:50.619
 in summer the bronzer so 

00:04:47.859 --> 00:04:52.329
 probably the next orders I 

00:04:50.619 --> 00:04:54.789
 ask for some more of ccoo tours 

00:04:52.329 --> 00:04:58.149
 if you have struggles of ccoo tools and are 

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:59.439
 as happy as I am with the fans 

00:04:58.149 --> 00:05:00.909
 can go see the comments that 

00:04:59.439 --> 00:05:03.279
 bag you recommend me for my next 

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:07.829
 buy because I'm looking forward to getting hold of 

00:05:03.279 --> 00:05:07.829
 some low that this have me captured 

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:12.339
 and the best is the price that only 

00:05:09.579 --> 00:05:14.589
 it cost 6 dollars with 99 I also think that 

00:05:12.339 --> 00:05:15.369
 we print sell the ccoo brushes 

00:05:14.589 --> 00:05:16.809
 tools 

00:05:15.369 --> 00:05:18.819
 but I think I 've seen them a tad more 

00:05:16.809 --> 00:05:20.139
 face like those of realtime and the 

00:05:18.819 --> 00:05:23.829
 first place comes a little bit more 

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:26.079
 face and then they are usually cheaper 

00:05:23.829 --> 00:05:27.710
 so I'll keep buying you member 

00:05:26.079 --> 00:05:30.980
 challenger because 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:32.750
 with pizza makes up for it and today is in 

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:35.510
 your house and the last brochita the 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:37.730
 Last thing to ask was this brush 

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:39.680
 from here I'm dreaming of her from 

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:42.050
 I saw her but I never dared to 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:44.270
 when you need them, you come in another 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:46.160
 what it is but if I needed them because it is 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:49.130
 my color crochet are the truth is that 

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:50.930
 They are pretty bad and I needed a 

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:51.920
 colorful brush I already understood why to the 

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:54.200
 true that at home I always 

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:55.580
 tripling the powder with the brush of 

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:57.830
 blusher sold the technician quite 

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:59.510
 chubby girl 

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:02.330
 talking about rouge and completely 

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:06.650
 dust and in the end that's what I've done 

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:08.660
 and I'm super in love with this fight is 

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:11.270
 super soft is like the rouge 

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:15.790
 understood energy recites but with another 

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:18.730
 way was not pipita 

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:21.610
 which is perfect to the touch is super soft 

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:23.260
 high star of the next three thousand 

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:26.680
 but these are the cerebral pau as os 

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:28.300
 I say and it's to apply back and I 

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:31.440
 love I love it because it's 

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:33.420
 big one that in a moment 

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:35.760
 if the powder is applied at night 

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:38.070
 awakens in me the form that the 

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:39.630
 nice that are the culete that is flat 

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:41.670
 that you can put it like that on the dresser 

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:44.100
 we are using what you have 

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:45.720
 to put tumbadita is that I love the 

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:47.310
 women and the technician and as I tell you 

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:50.610
 it's a matter of economic systems 

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:53.040
 the $ 999 process and water I hope 

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:55.470
 that he likes to give life after he explains is 

00:06:53.040 --> 00:07:00.440
 I like it and if it 's the first time I've 

00:06:55.470 --> 00:07:00.440
 liked to subscribe
