00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
a standing form two reasons one it's not

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.970

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.850 
going to be very stable and two and also
more<00:00:50.309> important<00:00:50.760> is<00:00:50.940> that<00:00:51.510> it<00:00:52.350> is<00:00:52.469> very

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
more important is that it is very

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.319 
more important is that it is very
difficult<00:00:53.129> to<00:00:53.520> create<00:00:53.730> something<00:00:54.120> that's

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
difficult to create something that's

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.250
