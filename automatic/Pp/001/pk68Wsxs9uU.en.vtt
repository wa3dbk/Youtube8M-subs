00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:14.339
 Hello dear friends today 

00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:17.279
 I want to talk about such an important topic as 

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:19.750
 point of education in the resume 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:23.160
 the thing is, I noticed that 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:26.199
 very often people are confused in testimony 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.960
 when to indicate the educational level 

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:31.390
 in summary in English 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:34.269
 the thing is, I found out about it myself 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:36.730
 just when i came to canada 

00:00:34.269 --> 00:00:37.600
 of the moment I was absolutely sure of something 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:41.909
 which is to say quite 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:44.379
 identical things but me very quickly 

00:00:41.909 --> 00:00:48.580
 locals explained that I was 

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:52.420
 wrong and so i want to explain to you 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:55.750
 also what they explained to me and dispel 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:01:01.360
 some delusions mean what am i 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:04.449
 I say I say that very often in 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:06.130
 resume people indicate that they have a diploma 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:09.369
 some university there 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:11.530
 but actually this is a direct translation from 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:14.080
 Russian language that I have a diploma 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:17.950

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:22.240

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:44.620

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:47.740
 words like diploma and 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:50.830

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:54.070

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:03.750

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:06.520
