you all how to take a scanned image and
make<00:00:13.780> it<00:00:13.929> into<00:00:14.110> a<00:00:14.139> vector<00:00:14.469> in<00:00:14.860> this<00:00:15.669> video<00:00:16.120> I'll

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:16.330 
make it into a vector in this video I'll

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:18.259 
make it into a vector in this video I'll
show<00:00:16.510> you<00:00:16.540> how<00:00:16.660> to<00:00:16.840> print<00:00:17.170> a<00:00:17.350> transparency<00:00:17.980> out

00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:18.269 
show you how to print a transparency out

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
show you how to print a transparency out
so<00:00:19.269> I<00:00:19.570> opened<00:00:20.289> up<00:00:20.380> my<00:00:20.680> file<00:00:21.039> on<00:00:21.660> this<00:00:22.660> computer

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:23.289 
so I opened up my file on this computer

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:25.290 
so I opened up my file on this computer
in<00:00:23.500> specific<00:00:24.189> because<00:00:24.849> it's<00:00:25.000> the<00:00:25.150> one

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:25.300 
in specific because it's the one

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.400 
in specific because it's the one
attached<00:00:25.689> to<00:00:25.840> the<00:00:26.140> printer<00:00:26.560> here<00:00:27.300> so<00:00:28.300> what<00:00:29.289> we

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:29.410 
attached to the printer here so what we

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:33.090 
attached to the printer here so what we
do<00:00:29.529> now<00:00:29.789> is<00:00:31.050> we'll<00:00:32.050> grab<00:00:32.439> a<00:00:32.470> transparency

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:33.100 
do now is we'll grab a transparency

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:40.470 
do now is we'll grab a transparency
which<00:00:33.700> we<00:00:33.970> usually<00:00:34.390> keep<00:00:34.600> under<00:00:35.440> here<00:00:38.670> and<00:00:39.670> if

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:40.480 
which we usually keep under here and if

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.450 
which we usually keep under here and if
you<00:00:40.600> look<00:00:40.750> closely<00:00:41.110> at<00:00:41.350> the<00:00:41.530> transparencies

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:42.460 
you look closely at the transparencies

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.740 
you look closely at the transparencies
you'll<00:00:43.360> see<00:00:43.600> this<00:00:43.899> corner<00:00:44.379> here<00:00:44.739> is<00:00:44.890> rounded

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
you'll see this corner here is rounded

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.400 
you'll see this corner here is rounded
the<00:00:46.750> other<00:00:46.899> corners<00:00:47.579> are<00:00:48.579> sharp<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:50.050> round

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:50.410 
the other corners are sharp the round

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:55.709 
the other corners are sharp the round
corner<00:00:51.809> needs<00:00:52.809> to<00:00:52.989> go<00:00:53.140> in<00:00:53.350> the<00:00:53.469> top<00:00:53.770> right<00:00:54.719> and

00:00:55.709 --> 00:00:55.719 
corner needs to go in the top right and

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:58.170 
corner needs to go in the top right and
the<00:00:56.289> reason<00:00:56.649> we<00:00:56.770> do<00:00:56.980> that<00:00:57.010> is<00:00:57.370> if<00:00:57.910> you<00:00:58.030> could

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:58.180 
the reason we do that is if you could

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.319 
the reason we do that is if you could
feel<00:00:58.420> this<00:00:58.690> this<00:00:59.530> part<00:00:59.829> is<00:01:00.010> shiny<00:01:00.370> and<00:01:00.699> smooth

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:01.329 
feel this this part is shiny and smooth

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:07.440 
feel this this part is shiny and smooth
and<00:01:01.629> this<00:01:02.469> part<00:01:02.829> is<00:01:03.039> dull<00:01:03.399> and<00:01:03.430> rough<00:01:04.710> so<00:01:06.450> we

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:07.450 
and this part is dull and rough so we

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.740 
and this part is dull and rough so we
just<00:01:07.690> set<00:01:07.990> the<00:01:08.020> printer<00:01:08.560> to<00:01:08.770> the<00:01:08.920> width<00:01:09.910> of<00:01:10.030> the

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
just set the printer to the width of the

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:16.110 
just set the printer to the width of the
transparency<00:01:12.330> pop<00:01:13.330> it<00:01:13.510> in<00:01:14.880> then<00:01:15.880> we'll<00:01:16.030> go

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:16.120 
transparency pop it in then we'll go

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:20.400 
transparency pop it in then we'll go
back<00:01:16.330> to<00:01:16.720> Adobe<00:01:17.910> at<00:01:18.910> Reeder<00:01:19.510> that's<00:01:20.050> what<00:01:20.290> we

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:20.410 
back to Adobe at Reeder that's what we

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:27.840 
back to Adobe at Reeder that's what we
use<00:01:20.620> to<00:01:21.040> read<00:01:21.550> our<00:01:21.730> pdfs<00:01:22.980> file<00:01:24.270> print<00:01:26.850> now

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
use to read our pdfs file print now

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.470 
use to read our pdfs file print now
before<00:01:28.780> we<00:01:28.900> hit<00:01:29.140> okay<00:01:29.980> we<00:01:30.520> have<00:01:30.640> to<00:01:30.820> adjust<00:01:31.180> the

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:31.480 
before we hit okay we have to adjust the

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
before we hit okay we have to adjust the
printer<00:01:31.900> for<00:01:32.290> this<00:01:32.680> transparency<00:01:33.550> size<00:01:34.290> so<00:01:35.290> go

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.500 
printer for this transparency size so go

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.020 
printer for this transparency size so go
into<00:01:35.680> properties<00:01:35.980> and<00:01:37.830> we've<00:01:38.830> already<00:01:39.220> preset
