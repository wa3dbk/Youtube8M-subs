00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.759

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.170

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.630
 good today we are going to prepare a 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.630
 sandwich 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:25.850
 good yes but they call it summer cake 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:29.029
 actually I see it as a sandwich and 

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:31.580
 sing but I did not know I think it's a good idea 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:32.300
 let's see what we need ham and 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:34.550
 cheese 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:38.410
 I know that his yellow and panela cheese the 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:42.410
 quantities are free surimi bars 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:44.660
 mayonnaise and mustard chopped vegetable clean 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:47.449
 and disinfected weeping and vegetables 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:50.750
 colorful to liven up the plate A 

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:53.450
 bread bag we cut the edges to 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.340
 bread we spread mayonnaise and put it on 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:57.530
 a mold like these the part with 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.809
 mayonnaise should look up 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:04.719
 and we cover the entire base of the mold with 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:04.719
 bread we accommodate cheese and ham 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:10.730
 and we put another layer of bread but now 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.680
 with mustard can add or remove 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:14.720
 ingredients they want they do not like the 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.730
 mayonnaise mustard can be changed by 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.250
 anything else is a recipe very 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:21.530
 free I scratched my surimi bars and the 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.720
 parisi on the new layer of bread and 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.120
 we cover the surimi with bread with mayonnaise 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.160
 this time the mayonnaise will go 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.990
 looking down unless they want 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.850
 add a new floor with the 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:35.280
 ingredients that you want 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.500
 with a flat surface of it 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.900
 mold size I made it with another 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:43.090
 mold like we do pressure and what 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.369
 we keep a little while in the fridge 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.200
 then we take them out and cut the 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:50.549
 corners of the mold so that we can 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.549
 get out without getting rid of 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.590
 we flipped it with a super maneuver should I 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.109
 confess that I died of fear of 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:08.539
 throw it but everything went well and we put 

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:08.539
 more mayonnaise up and sides 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.540
 the final step is to decorate our 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:21.120
 delicious summer cake with the 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.120
 vegetable that we chop and so it is ready 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:31.890
 equal to our summer cake is 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.840
 I hope you like it very much 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.780
 much 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:39.060
 well this was our summer cake or 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.190
 giant sandwich or sandwich cake 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.110
 I hope you liked the truth 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.480
 which is very simple and is an excellent idea 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.400
 for those Sundays the ones that mom does not 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.319
 wants to cook or for people who 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.150
 they live alone or the university students who 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:54.480
 they live alone and they say you have to block 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:56.879
 cooking then a sandwich cake is the 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.190

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.130
 no no 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.230
 the truth is that it 's a very good idea to 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.850
 a Sunday for example in which mom does not 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.520
 he wants to cook and we are hungry and 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:27.450
 we want something rich and different because it is 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:29.410
 a sandwich nothing feels good to you 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:32.430
