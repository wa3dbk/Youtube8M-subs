which will then lead to a good night of
sleep<00:00:32.189> now<00:00:33.059> apparently<00:00:33.899> this<00:00:34.050> whole<00:00:34.260> deer

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
sleep now apparently this whole deer

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
feeder are very good at absorbing

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.060 
feeder are very good at absorbing
essential<00:00:36.899> oils<00:00:37.230> so<00:00:37.410> that's<00:00:37.590> why<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:37.829> Vicks

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
essential oils so that's why the Vicks

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.740 
essential oils so that's why the Vicks
VapoRub<00:00:38.399> would<00:00:38.610> work<00:00:38.790> fairly<00:00:39.210> well<00:00:39.360> for<00:00:39.660> this

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
VapoRub would work fairly well for this

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.270 
VapoRub would work fairly well for this
reason<00:00:40.110> they<00:00:40.230> aren't<00:00:40.469> really<00:00:40.590> sure<00:00:40.829> how<00:00:41.250> it

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
reason they aren't really sure how it

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.760 
reason they aren't really sure how it
works<00:00:41.610> but<00:00:41.820> they're<00:00:42.149> imagining<00:00:42.840> it's<00:00:42.960> based

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
works but they're imagining it's based

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:44.830 
works but they're imagining it's based
on<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.040> absorption<00:00:44.250> of<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.610> medication

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:44.840 
on the absorption of the medication

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.119 
on the absorption of the medication
through<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:45.930> soles<00:00:46.140> of<00:00:46.230> your<00:00:46.260> feet<00:00:46.350> maybe

through the soles of your feet maybe

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.130 
through the soles of your feet maybe
with<00:00:47.430> a<00:00:47.460> little<00:00:47.640> bit<00:00:47.760> of<00:00:47.879> reflexology<00:00:48.480> idea<00:00:48.960> in

with a little bit of reflexology idea in

with a little bit of reflexology idea in
there<00:00:49.289> I<00:00:49.379> don't<00:00:49.590> know<00:00:49.649> in<00:00:50.430> any<00:00:50.579> case<00:00:50.820> it's

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
there I don't know in any case it's

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.360 
there I don't know in any case it's
really<00:00:52.379> effective<00:00:52.829> in<00:00:52.920> children<00:00:53.010> probably

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
really effective in children probably

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.920 
really effective in children probably
more<00:00:53.670> effective<00:00:53.850> in<00:00:54.120> children<00:00:54.300> than<00:00:54.690> in<00:00:54.809> an

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
more effective in children than in an

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.810 
more effective in children than in an
adult<00:00:55.230> but<00:00:55.500> it<00:00:55.620> has<00:00:55.770> worked<00:00:56.190> for<00:00:56.340> adults<00:00:56.730> as

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
adult but it has worked for adults as

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:57.139 
adult but it has worked for adults as
well

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
well

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.180 
well
they're<00:00:57.480> staying<00:00:57.809> it's<00:00:57.989> 100%<00:00:58.350> effective<00:00:58.829> I

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
they're staying it's 100% effective I

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.439 
they're staying it's 100% effective I
don't<00:00:59.370> know<00:00:59.460> if<00:00:59.520> there's<00:00:59.699> any<00:00:59.850> hard<00:01:00.180> evidence

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
don't know if there's any hard evidence

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.740 
don't know if there's any hard evidence
on<00:01:00.930> this<00:01:01.079> matter<00:01:01.379> but<00:01:02.160> hey<00:01:02.850> if<00:01:03.090> it<00:01:03.210> works<00:01:03.420> then

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
on this matter but hey if it works then

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.329 
on this matter but hey if it works then
great<00:01:03.930> it's<00:01:04.080> a<00:01:04.140> holistic<00:01:04.409> rub<00:01:04.830> that's<00:01:05.070> for

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
great it's a holistic rub that's for

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.070 
great it's a holistic rub that's for
sure<00:01:05.519> and<00:01:06.299> then<00:01:06.450> you<00:01:06.510> don't<00:01:06.689> get<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.869> side

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
sure and then you don't get the side

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.090 
sure and then you don't get the side
effects<00:01:07.350> that<00:01:07.409> you<00:01:07.500> would<00:01:07.680> get<00:01:07.799> from<00:01:07.979> the

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
effects that you would get from the

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.380 
effects that you would get from the
prescription<00:01:08.610> medications<00:01:09.150> if<00:01:09.270> they

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
prescription medications if they

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.240 
prescription medications if they
over-the-counter<00:01:09.900> cost<00:01:10.350> medications<00:01:10.950> and

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
over-the-counter cost medications and

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.770 
over-the-counter cost medications and
which<00:01:11.760> is<00:01:11.880> even<00:01:12.060> better<00:01:12.150> for<00:01:12.330> your<00:01:12.420> children

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
which is even better for your children

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.210 
which is even better for your children
because<00:01:12.930> we<00:01:13.049> certainly<00:01:13.260> don't<00:01:13.470> want<00:01:13.740> them<00:01:13.950> to

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
because we certainly don't want them to

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.550 
because we certainly don't want them to
you<00:01:15.030> know<00:01:15.180> experience<00:01:15.600> more<00:01:15.960> problems<00:01:16.350> from

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
you know experience more problems from

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.280 
you know experience more problems from
side<00:01:16.860> effects<00:01:17.159> and<00:01:17.479> I<00:01:18.479> think<00:01:18.869> that's<00:01:19.020> about<00:01:19.140> it

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
side effects and I think that's about it

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.200 
side effects and I think that's about it
I<00:01:19.500> just<00:01:19.650> wanted<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:19.890> give<00:01:19.979> you<00:01:20.009> that<00:01:20.340> idea<00:01:20.490> the

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
I just wanted to give you that idea the

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.999 
I just wanted to give you that idea the
safety<00:01:21.630> issue<00:01:21.750> is<00:01:22.020> and<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.380> safety<00:01:22.770> isn't

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
safety issue is and the safety isn't

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.140 
safety issue is and the safety isn't
really<00:01:23.250> that<00:01:23.280> much<00:01:23.460> of<00:01:23.520> an<00:01:23.700> issue<00:01:23.820> either

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
really that much of an issue either

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.050 
really that much of an issue either
because<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.259> Vicks<00:01:25.560> VapoRub<00:01:25.950> has<00:01:26.220> very<00:01:26.610> few

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
because the Vicks VapoRub has very few

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.330 
because the Vicks VapoRub has very few
side<00:01:27.360> effects<00:01:27.689> now<00:01:27.960> if<00:01:28.320> you<00:01:28.740> rub<00:01:28.950> it<00:01:29.130> on

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
side effects now if you rub it on

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.310 
side effects now if you rub it on
anywhere<00:01:29.670> in<00:01:29.759> your<00:01:29.820> body<00:01:30.030> and<00:01:30.210> how<00:01:30.329> you<00:01:30.659> can<00:01:31.110> be

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
anywhere in your body and how you can be

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.780 
anywhere in your body and how you can be

may be a little itchy but mostly redness
I<00:01:39.720> imagine<00:01:40.170> would<00:01:40.439> be<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.680> issue

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
I imagine would be the issue

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.990 
I imagine would be the issue
I<00:01:41.159> don't<00:01:41.520> know<00:01:41.579> they<00:01:41.700> imagine<00:01:42.030> that<00:01:42.060> I<00:01:43.820> in<00:01:44.820> any

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
I don't know they imagine that I in any

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.359 
I don't know they imagine that I in any
case<00:01:45.210> I<00:01:45.720> guess<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.799> other<00:01:46.950> problem

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
case I guess the other problem

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:48.859 
case I guess the other problem
especially<00:01:47.820> the<00:01:47.939> children<00:01:48.149> is<00:01:48.420> if<00:01:48.540> they<00:01:48.659> reach

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
especially the children is if they reach

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.929 
especially the children is if they reach
down<00:01:49.170> and<00:01:49.530> get<00:01:50.189> it<00:01:50.310> on<00:01:50.399> their<00:01:50.520> hands<00:01:50.700> and<00:01:50.850> then

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
down and get it on their hands and then

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.090 
down and get it on their hands and then
they<00:01:51.000> put<00:01:51.180> it<00:01:51.240> in<00:01:51.329> their<00:01:51.450> mouth<00:01:51.659> this<00:01:52.619> kid<00:01:52.950> not

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
they put it in their mouth this kid not

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.359 
they put it in their mouth this kid not
this<00:01:53.460> would<00:01:53.700> be<00:01:53.820> a<00:01:53.850> little<00:01:54.030> bit<00:01:54.270> of<00:01:55.049> a<00:01:55.170> concern

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:55.369 
this would be a little bit of a concern

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:57.560 
this would be a little bit of a concern
it<00:01:56.369> is<00:01:56.579> possible<00:01:57.060> that<00:01:57.090> they<00:01:57.270> can<00:01:57.329> become

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
it is possible that they can become

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.410 
it is possible that they can become
reaches<00:01:58.320> toxicity<00:01:59.250> level<00:01:59.549> or<00:01:59.700> toxic<00:02:00.119> level

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
however that would have to be quite a

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:02.899 
however that would have to be quite a
bit

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
bit
