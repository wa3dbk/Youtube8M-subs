few days ago as you can see it's all

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.440 
few days ago as you can see it's all
ripped<00:00:13.139> apart<00:00:13.290> but<00:00:14.099> this<00:00:14.700> is<00:00:14.849> a<00:00:14.880> control<00:00:15.269> panel

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
ripped apart but this is a control panel

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:16.880 
ripped apart but this is a control panel
that<00:00:15.719> I<00:00:15.750> wound<00:00:15.960> up<00:00:16.020> picking<00:00:16.230> up<00:00:16.379> off<00:00:16.560> the<00:00:16.710> net

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
that I wound up picking up off the net

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.510 
that I wound up picking up off the net
it's<00:00:17.100> for<00:00:17.310> a<00:00:17.369> hyper<00:00:17.760> neogeo<00:00:18.210> 64<00:00:18.840> and<00:00:19.080> I<00:00:19.980> want<00:00:20.430> to

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
it's for a hyper neogeo 64 and I want to

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:21.800 
it's for a hyper neogeo 64 and I want to
get<00:00:20.580> some<00:00:20.640> extra<00:00:20.970> buttons<00:00:21.390> and<00:00:21.570> some<00:00:21.689> extra

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
get some extra buttons and some extra

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.349 
get some extra buttons and some extra
joysticks<00:00:22.529> here<00:00:22.830> and<00:00:23.010> I<00:00:23.490> saw<00:00:23.699> this<00:00:23.910> thing<00:00:24.150> up

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
joysticks here and I saw this thing up

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.000 
joysticks here and I saw this thing up
there<00:00:24.390> just<00:00:24.840> kind<00:00:24.960> of<00:00:25.080> labeled<00:00:25.439> as<00:00:25.560> control

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
there just kind of labeled as control

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.120 
there just kind of labeled as control
panel<00:00:26.400> and<00:00:26.550> I<00:00:27.150> I<00:00:27.660> knew<00:00:27.869> it<00:00:28.080> was<00:00:28.289> a<00:00:28.320> neo<00:00:28.890> geo

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
panel and I I knew it was a neo geo

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.220 
panel and I I knew it was a neo geo
control<00:00:29.550> panel<00:00:29.849> just<00:00:30.060> from<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.539> look<00:00:30.929> of<00:00:31.080> it

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
control panel just from the look of it

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.770 
control panel just from the look of it
so<00:00:31.650> I<00:00:31.880> clicked<00:00:32.880> on<00:00:33.000> it<00:00:33.059> it<00:00:33.329> had<00:00:33.420> a<00:00:33.450> small

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
so I clicked on it it had a small

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.049 
so I clicked on it it had a small
picture<00:00:34.170> and<00:00:34.520> clicked<00:00:35.520> on<00:00:35.670> it<00:00:35.700> and<00:00:35.880> sure

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
picture and clicked on it and sure

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.209 
picture and clicked on it and sure
enough<00:00:36.090> it<00:00:36.480> was<00:00:36.510> for<00:00:36.780> Hyper<00:00:36.989> Neo<00:00:37.200> Geo<00:00:37.260> 64<00:00:37.980> so<00:00:38.190> I

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
enough it was for Hyper Neo Geo 64 so I

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.430 
enough it was for Hyper Neo Geo 64 so I
want<00:00:38.430> to<00:00:38.550> picking<00:00:38.820> this<00:00:38.910> thing<00:00:38.969> up<00:00:39.270> here<00:00:39.629> it

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
want to picking this thing up here it

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.470 
want to picking this thing up here it
has<00:00:40.620> like<00:00:40.950> some<00:00:41.160> extra<00:00:41.460> holes<00:00:41.670> drilled<00:00:42.090> out<00:00:42.270> on

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
has like some extra holes drilled out on

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.880 
has like some extra holes drilled out on
it<00:00:42.660> I<00:00:42.840> just<00:00:43.110> wanted<00:00:43.350> to<00:00:43.410> see<00:00:43.559> what<00:00:43.739> it<00:00:43.770> would

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
it I just wanted to see what it would

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.500 
it I just wanted to see what it would
look<00:00:44.040> like<00:00:44.100> if<00:00:44.430> I<00:00:44.550> could<00:00:44.730> try<00:00:44.910> and<00:00:45.090> color<00:00:45.270> match

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
look like if I could try and color match

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.080 
look like if I could try and color match
the<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:46.710> buttons<00:00:47.309> here<00:00:47.550> but<00:00:47.730> that<00:00:47.850> didn't

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
the the buttons here but that didn't

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.459 
the the buttons here but that didn't
work<00:00:48.120> out<00:00:48.360> because<00:00:48.600> this<00:00:48.840> thing<00:00:49.020> has<00:00:49.200> like<00:00:49.410> a

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
work out because this thing has like a

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.840 
work out because this thing has like a
really<00:00:50.129> kind<00:00:51.059> of<00:00:51.270> steel<00:00:52.020> mesh<00:00:52.379> look<00:00:53.340> to<00:00:53.550> it<00:00:53.699> and

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
really kind of steel mesh look to it and

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.540 
really kind of steel mesh look to it and
the<00:00:54.480> printer<00:00:54.719> did<00:00:54.899> not<00:00:55.020> pick<00:00:55.230> that<00:00:55.260> up<00:00:55.440> I<00:00:55.800> tried

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
the printer did not pick that up I tried

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.369 
the printer did not pick that up I tried
different<00:00:56.760> things<00:00:56.940> just<00:00:57.329> to<00:00:57.420> try<00:00:57.600> and<00:00:57.629> seal

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
different things just to try and seal

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.049 
different things just to try and seal
the<00:00:58.530> holes<00:00:58.739> up<00:00:58.980> what<00:00:59.550> this<00:00:59.670> thing<00:00:59.850> basically

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
the holes up what this thing basically

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.569 
the holes up what this thing basically
look<00:01:00.420> like<00:01:00.449> what<00:01:00.780> I<00:01:00.809> got<00:01:00.989> it<00:01:01.170> was<00:01:01.440> this<00:01:01.620> you

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
look like what I got it was this you

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.600 
look like what I got it was this you
could<00:01:02.699> probably<00:01:02.879> see<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.840> rust<00:01:04.739> on<00:01:04.979> it<00:01:05.010> this

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
could probably see the rust on it this

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.990 
could probably see the rust on it this
thing<00:01:05.850> was<00:01:06.060> very<00:01:06.479> very<00:01:06.840> very<00:01:07.320> rusted<00:01:07.979> on<00:01:08.130> the

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
thing was very very very rusted on the

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.609 
thing was very very very rusted on the
whole<00:01:09.210> bottom<00:01:09.540> part<00:01:09.570> was<00:01:09.930> completely<00:01:10.409> rusted

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
whole bottom part was completely rusted

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.109 
whole bottom part was completely rusted
out<00:01:10.890> and<00:01:11.100> I<00:01:12.060> went<00:01:12.570> and<00:01:13.080> I<00:01:13.580> tried<00:01:14.580> sanding<00:01:15.030> it

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
out and I went and I tried sanding it

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.740 
out and I went and I tried sanding it
down<00:01:15.150> here<00:01:16.310> it's<00:01:17.310> probably<00:01:17.610> hard<00:01:17.820> to<00:01:17.880> see<00:01:18.150> but

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
down here it's probably hard to see but

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.440 
down here it's probably hard to see but
I<00:01:18.810> tried<00:01:19.500> to<00:01:19.650> sand<00:01:19.950> and<00:01:20.189> scrape<00:01:20.490> all<00:01:20.729> all<00:01:21.180> the

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
I tried to sand and scrape all all the

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.800 
I tried to sand and scrape all all the
rust<00:01:21.659> offers<00:01:22.170> much<00:01:22.439> rust<00:01:22.680> as<00:01:22.860> I<00:01:22.950> could<00:01:23.189> and<00:01:23.810> get

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
rust offers much rust as I could and get

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.740 
rust offers much rust as I could and get
this<00:01:24.960> thing<00:01:25.200> to<00:01:26.390> get<00:01:27.390> a<00:01:27.420> little<00:01:27.659> bit<00:01:27.810> better

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
this thing to get a little bit better

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.620 
this thing to get a little bit better
probably<00:01:30.750> difficult<00:01:31.470> to<00:01:31.829> see<00:01:32.040> but<00:01:32.540> tried<00:01:33.540> to

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
probably difficult to see but tried to

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.149 
probably difficult to see but tried to
get<00:01:33.750> as<00:01:33.840> much<00:01:33.960> of<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.200> rust<00:01:34.409> off<00:01:34.590> as<00:01:34.799> I<00:01:34.890> could

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
get as much of the rust off as I could

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:38.210 
get as much of the rust off as I could
and<00:01:36.110> yeah<00:01:37.110> I<00:01:37.140> gave<00:01:37.350> it<00:01:37.470> a<00:01:37.530> coat<00:01:37.710> of<00:01:37.740> paint<00:01:38.009> on

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
and yeah I gave it a coat of paint on

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.550 
and yeah I gave it a coat of paint on
the<00:01:38.490> back<00:01:38.610> here<00:01:38.970> and<00:01:39.180> unfortunately<00:01:39.900> this

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
the back here and unfortunately this

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.030 
the back here and unfortunately this
paint<00:01:40.829> since<00:01:41.159> it's<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.750> the<00:01:42.750> one<00:01:43.530> is<00:01:43.619> its<00:01:43.890> kind

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
paint since it's the the one is its kind

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.880 
paint since it's the the one is its kind

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
it you leave a fingerprint and this has

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.590 
it you leave a fingerprint and this has
been<00:01:48.600> dried<00:01:48.869> for<00:01:48.899> like<00:01:49.259> a<00:01:49.470> few<00:01:49.680> days<00:01:49.740> now<00:01:49.920> but<00:01:50.600> I

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
been dried for like a few days now but I

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.050 
been dried for like a few days now but I
still<00:01:52.290> keep<00:01:52.470> getting<00:01:52.829> paint<00:01:53.399> on<00:01:53.490> my<00:01:53.670> fingers

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
still keep getting paint on my fingers

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.880 
still keep getting paint on my fingers
but<00:01:54.390> at<00:01:54.810> least<00:01:54.899> I've<00:01:55.140> gotten<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.470> rust<00:01:55.710> all

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
but at least I've gotten the rust all

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.830 
but at least I've gotten the rust all
taken<00:01:56.189> care<00:01:56.219> of<00:01:56.399> what<00:01:56.969> I've<00:01:57.119> decided<00:01:57.390> to<00:01:57.659> do

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
here is take apart these joysticks

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.100 
here is take apart these joysticks
because<00:01:59.820> everything<00:02:00.240> here<00:02:00.479> was<00:02:00.600> really

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
really bad um everything was in bad

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.270 
really bad um everything was in bad

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.520 
to get the ball off here wand up

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.910 
to get the ball off here wand up
snapping<00:02:27.150> it<00:02:27.510> because<00:02:28.050> it<00:02:28.260> was<00:02:28.290> cracked<00:02:28.650> all

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
snapping it because it was cracked all

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.070 
snapping it because it was cracked all
the<00:02:28.950> way<00:02:29.070> around<00:02:29.250> it<00:02:29.610> and<00:02:29.790> if<00:02:30.660> you<00:02:30.750> ever<00:02:30.810> want

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
the way around it and if you ever want

the way around it and if you ever want
to<00:02:31.140> see<00:02:31.260> the<00:02:31.440> inside<00:02:31.800> of<00:02:31.830> these<00:02:32.180> joystick

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180

handles<00:02:33.510> these<00:02:33.750> balls<00:02:34.020> look<00:02:34.200> like<00:02:34.230> this<00:02:34.710> is<00:02:34.860> it

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
handles these balls look like this is it

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.560 
handles these balls look like this is it
I<00:02:35.250> thought<00:02:35.520> this<00:02:35.670> is<00:02:35.820> kind<00:02:36.000> of<00:02:36.030> cool<00:02:36.090> you<00:02:36.420> know

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
I thought this is kind of cool you know

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.960 
I thought this is kind of cool you know
it's<00:02:37.230> a<00:02:37.260> lot<00:02:37.410> smaller<00:02:37.620> but<00:02:38.100> still<00:02:38.940> a

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
it's a lot smaller but still a

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.140 
it's a lot smaller but still a
functioning<00:02:39.900> ball<00:02:40.140> but<00:02:40.760> yeah<00:02:41.760> I<00:02:41.790> got<00:02:42.030> that

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
functioning ball but yeah I got that

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.060 
functioning ball but yeah I got that
land<00:02:42.390> around<00:02:42.600> here<00:02:42.720> for<00:02:42.960> right<00:02:43.020> now<00:02:43.080> but<00:02:43.860> I'm

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
land around here for right now but I'm

take these micro switches clean them up
a<00:02:47.880> little<00:02:47.910> bit<00:02:48.270> some<00:02:49.080> of<00:02:49.200> these<00:02:49.290> are<00:02:49.500> very

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
a little bit some of these are very

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.300 
a little bit some of these are very
loose<00:02:49.970> this<00:02:50.970> one<00:02:51.440> that<00:02:52.440> doesn't<00:02:52.770> shake<00:02:52.980> so

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310

I<00:03:04.890> can<00:03:05.070> clean<00:03:05.460> these<00:03:05.610> things<00:03:05.880> up<00:03:06.090> here<00:03:06.390> get

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
I can clean these things up here get

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.260 
I can clean these things up here get
them<00:03:06.930> to<00:03:07.110> to<00:03:07.590> work<00:03:08.310> a<00:03:08.430> little<00:03:08.460> bit<00:03:08.730> better<00:03:08.880> they

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:09.270 
them to to work a little bit better they

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:12.020 
them to to work a little bit better they
should<00:03:09.540> still<00:03:09.780> function<00:03:10.710> fine<00:03:11.070> as<00:03:11.730> long<00:03:11.790> as

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
should still function fine as long as

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.600 
should still function fine as long as
they<00:03:12.120> get<00:03:12.210> cleaned<00:03:12.480> up<00:03:12.600> here<00:03:13.430> this<00:03:14.430> one's

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:14.610 
they get cleaned up here this one's

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:19.490 
they get cleaned up here this one's
pretty<00:03:14.820> loose<00:03:15.200> but<00:03:16.730> should<00:03:17.730> still<00:03:17.880> still<00:03:18.780> work

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
pretty loose but should still still work

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.600 
pretty loose but should still still work
out<00:03:19.680> fine<00:03:20.010> a<00:03:20.280> lot<00:03:20.430> of<00:03:20.459> rust<00:03:20.760> on<00:03:20.970> these<00:03:21.209> things

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:22.610

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
some of these centres points looks like

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:26.900 
some of these centres points looks like
it<00:03:25.650> looked<00:03:25.890> like<00:03:25.980> it<00:03:26.190> had<00:03:26.280> been<00:03:26.430> sitting<00:03:26.640> in<00:03:26.790> a
