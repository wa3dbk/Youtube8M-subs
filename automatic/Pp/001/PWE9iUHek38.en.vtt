00:00:03.859 --> 00:00:16.049
 Europe was on fire We would all be 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:18.570
 the Allies landed tomorrow 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.340
 and marched on paris to the 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.769
 Germans wanted to destroy everything 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.230
 equalize the ground 

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:26.490
 especially the blow up of the paris 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.789
 Bridges will be spectacular 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:32.730
 flood that will be the trigger if they 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.470
 henceforth, five minutes after bridge farmer 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.110
 Notre Dame busted and the railway stations 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:39.320
 nothing remains so the order of the 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.320
 leader 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:46.640
 why do you really want this city? 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.640
 destroy city commander 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.670
 That does not concern you 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.260
 They are wrong if you ask me today 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.520
 tomorrow would not have asked in with them 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.440
 I would contact you now 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.850
 still nothing sleeps at all of these 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.680
 people who want to kill them soon 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.880
 you will also be with the theater and 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.920
 let's finally ask 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.510
 civilians are civilians for the 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.390
 this clique is a joke and the 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.620
 have done absolutely nothing to them 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.270
 how many children are as old as 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.770
 their are probably among those dead since 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.740
 Did you ever think they had 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.270
 the man was ordered to paris 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.160
 I will restore the order 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.320
 do more than that and what exactly do you have 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:23.050
 I'm going to crush them all up 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.970
 on the last man 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:28.070
 I was mistaken for him and signaled 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.840
 in myself I thought so 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.360
 could it be from such a madman 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:35.660
 dissuade projects 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:37.490
 so we will threaten this louvre 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.460
 or the cluster concorde never again 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.470
 see 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.710
 We will no longer have children in the park 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:48.080
 see play 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:50.860
 the towers of st all that will be forever 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.860
 disappear 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.380
 you have no qualms 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.870
 what kind of person are you?
