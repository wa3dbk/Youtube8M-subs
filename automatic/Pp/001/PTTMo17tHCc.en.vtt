00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:10.350 
good morning folks over at space weather

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:12.110 
good morning folks over at space weather
news<00:00:10.590> we<00:00:10.830> can<00:00:10.980> see<00:00:11.160> that<00:00:11.309> solar<00:00:11.580> flaring

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
news we can see that solar flaring

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.840 
news we can see that solar flaring
remains<00:00:12.480> very<00:00:12.900> low<00:00:13.230> the<00:00:13.590> Sun<00:00:13.799> is<00:00:13.950> not<00:00:14.100> inactive

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:17.029 
remains very low the Sun is not inactive
however<00:00:15.270> as<00:00:15.480> a<00:00:15.510> series<00:00:15.990> of<00:00:16.020> farside<00:00:16.530> eruptions

neither eruption is aimed at earth but

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.769 
neither eruption is aimed at earth but
they<00:00:26.189> should<00:00:26.400> reach<00:00:26.669> one<00:00:27.000> AU<00:00:27.269> for
