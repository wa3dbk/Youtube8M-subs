00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:10.000
 but under the Andalusian sun the 

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:11.650
 flamenco also sits in France between 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.969
 leisure and passion this tradition 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:14.969
 Spanish is coming to Paris 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.340
 with my husband we try to do 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.140
 understand that flamenco is not 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.840
 that they have choreographies of the steps 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.940
 and was facing the mirror and seeing 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.619
 when we are prettier than the girlfriend at 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.400
 side but it's mostly in 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.400
 ears 15 years passing 

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:24.270
 a masseur of flames and knows no 

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:26.520
 necessarily only dancers he must 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.049
 First be a musician because you walk 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.240
 has a percussion that can be 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.390
 perfectly comfortable with the guitar and 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.390
 singing 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.390
 m 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.940
 slumped we have no choice he must 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.140
 to bring 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:44.160
 and I think they really have the 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.160
 people need sun 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.740
 it feels like you're in a bar 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.480
 tapas and his daughters 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.480
 especially not 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.480
 years 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:09.400
 and also Sevillian are the friends that 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.710
 seems mind-blowing I'm asked where from 

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:14.060
 fell for 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:14.060
 Monday night's announcement 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:21.849
 swing but that's like walking 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.580
 underwater a job without the flames 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:26.590
 so to walk under the jets we are 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:29.379
 parent makes a stir and it gives us 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.790
 this feeling of lightness in 

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:32.769
 going through the flames because 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.510
 some passionate 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:36.659
 it was flying normally bottom of our 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.659
 heart
