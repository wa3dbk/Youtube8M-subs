00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.780 
five times and then you could launch it
but<00:02:14.560> before<00:02:14.709> you<00:02:14.920> do<00:02:15.010> that<00:02:15.040> I<00:02:15.310> suggest<00:02:15.489> making

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
but before you do that I suggest making

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.460 
but before you do that I suggest making
back<00:02:16.090> sub<00:02:16.299> backups<00:02:16.840> of<00:02:16.930> your<00:02:16.989> world

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
back sub backups of your world

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.619 
back sub backups of your world
so<00:02:18.340> to<00:02:18.400> do<00:02:18.610> that<00:02:18.640> you<00:02:19.060> could<00:02:19.209> just<00:02:19.360> come<00:02:19.510> in

00:02:19.619 --> 00:02:19.629 
so to do that you could just come in

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:25.080 
so to do that you could just come in
here<00:02:19.900> just<00:02:22.319> copy<00:02:23.319> this<00:02:23.500> entire<00:02:23.620> folder<00:02:24.190> and

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
here just copy this entire folder and

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.390 
here just copy this entire folder and
make<00:02:25.239> a<00:02:25.269> copy<00:02:25.480> of<00:02:25.690> it<00:02:25.780> just<00:02:26.739> in<00:02:26.920> case<00:02:26.950> something

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
make a copy of it just in case something

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.930 
make a copy of it just in case something
goes<00:02:27.430> wrong

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
goes wrong

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:29.550 
goes wrong
you<00:02:28.269> want<00:02:28.390> to<00:02:28.450> have<00:02:28.540> a<00:02:28.569> backup<00:02:28.780> so<00:02:29.349> you<00:02:29.410> don't

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
you want to have a backup so you don't

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.710 
you want to have a backup so you don't
lose<00:02:29.709> your<00:02:29.739> worlds<00:02:30.390> usually<00:02:31.390> you<00:02:31.450> should<00:02:31.480> be

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
lose your worlds usually you should be

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.539 
lose your worlds usually you should be
all<00:02:31.840> set<00:02:32.019> though<00:02:32.200> but<00:02:32.920> it's<00:02:33.040> always<00:02:33.190> just<00:02:33.280> in

00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:33.549 
all set though but it's always just in

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:36.270 
all set though but it's always just in
case<00:02:34.019> Sony<00:02:35.019> can<00:02:35.170> launch<00:02:35.319> it<00:02:35.470> and<00:02:35.980> it<00:02:36.099> should

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
case Sony can launch it and it should

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.940 
case Sony can launch it and it should
run<00:02:36.459> and<00:02:36.700> open<00:02:37.510> I<00:02:37.690> am<00:02:38.260> NOT<00:02:38.560> going<00:02:38.769> to<00:02:38.799> update

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.220

because<00:02:39.579> when<00:02:39.730> you<00:02:39.790> update<00:02:39.970> it<00:02:40.360> restores<00:02:41.110> it

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
because when you update it restores it

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.289 
because when you update it restores it
to<00:02:41.260> defaults<00:02:41.739> and<00:02:42.280> we<00:02:42.430> do<00:02:42.579> not<00:02:42.700> have<00:02:42.879> defaults

on<00:03:46.510> a<00:03:46.840> different<00:03:47.319> mod<00:03:47.500> pack<00:03:47.769> then<00:03:48.489> you<00:03:48.639> can<00:03:48.790> do

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
on a different mod pack then you can do

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:50.699 
on a different mod pack then you can do
it<00:03:49.030> just<00:03:49.239> the<00:03:49.359> way<00:03:49.450> you<00:03:49.480> did<00:03:49.690> this<00:03:49.810> one<00:03:50.019> if

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
it just the way you did this one if

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:51.930 
it just the way you did this one if
we're<00:03:50.829> gonna<00:03:50.919> add<00:03:51.069> an<00:03:51.190> external<00:03:51.489> mod<00:03:51.760> that

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
we're gonna add an external mod that

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.210 
we're gonna add an external mod that
isn't<00:03:52.180> in<00:03:52.269> an<00:03:52.389> FTP<00:03:52.959> mod<00:03:53.139> pack<00:03:53.380> you<00:03:53.950> just<00:03:54.130> have

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
isn't in an FTP mod pack you just have

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.909 
isn't in an FTP mod pack you just have
to<00:03:54.310> make<00:03:54.459> sure<00:03:54.790> that<00:03:55.290> the<00:03:56.290> Minecraft<00:03:56.739> version

00:03:56.909 --> 00:03:56.919 
to make sure that the Minecraft version

00:03:56.919 --> 00:04:00.270 
to make sure that the Minecraft version
which<00:03:57.370> is<00:03:57.459> 1.5<00:03:57.849> way<00:03:58.329> up<00:03:58.450> here<00:03:58.660> matches<00:03:59.620> up<00:03:59.980> with

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
which is 1.5 way up here matches up with

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.099 
which is 1.5 way up here matches up with
the<00:04:00.459> version<00:04:00.790> of<00:04:00.910> the<00:04:01.120> mod<00:04:01.269> you're<00:04:01.510> adding<00:04:01.840> and

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:02.109 
the version of the mod you're adding and

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:04.759 
the version of the mod you're adding and
if<00:04:02.829> it<00:04:02.950> does<00:04:03.129> then<00:04:03.430> it<00:04:03.459> should<00:04:03.700> work<00:04:03.849> fine

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:04.769 
if it does then it should work fine

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:07.710 
if it does then it should work fine
however<00:04:05.769> occasionally<00:04:06.489> you<00:04:06.940> might<00:04:07.090> get<00:04:07.329> IDs

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:07.720 
however occasionally you might get IDs

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:10.379 
however occasionally you might get IDs
that<00:04:08.470> overlap<00:04:08.889> each<00:04:09.040> other<00:04:09.280> and<00:04:09.549> it'll<00:04:10.180> tell

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:10.389 
that overlap each other and it'll tell

00:04:10.389 --> 00:04:11.490 
that overlap each other and it'll tell
you<00:04:10.480> that<00:04:10.599> before<00:04:10.750> you<00:04:10.930> open<00:04:11.200> your<00:04:11.260> world

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500 
you that before you open your world

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.150 
you that before you open your world
you'll<00:04:12.130> say<00:04:12.370> this<00:04:13.000> ID<00:04:13.299> is<00:04:13.949> overwritten<00:04:14.949> or

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:15.160 
you'll say this ID is overwritten or

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:16.470 
you'll say this ID is overwritten or
something<00:04:15.430> like<00:04:15.489> that

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:16.480 
something like that
