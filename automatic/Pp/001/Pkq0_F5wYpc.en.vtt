00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:13.710
 We're fine, I'm with another one. 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.570
 video for you about my hair I 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.680
 I made another small transformation 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.609
 alone 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:23.369
 You must have already noticed me. 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.189
 change like this in my very basic hair 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.869
 but that's how it made and makes all the difference 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:31.769
 for women who are currencies 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:34.800
 I just type in realizing that the queen 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:37.500
 it is very dark indeed that the color of the 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.890
 my natural hair even then take 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:46.640
 roots here and here goes my 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:50.600
 good lights and I decided to do this because 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:53.340
 I did not want to do them again. 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.719
 precisely because it is damaged then 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:59.520
 I was not going to do the streets. 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:01.859
 again and I want to change, too. 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.559
 I change this if I do not want it too. 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.840
 You die because you've seen who 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:10.140
 with me knows that the tumor lives and 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:12.180
 then blonde appears, so I'm well 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.490
 so, and look, it gives me insanity and 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.560
 I'm not afraid there's nothing like that 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:20.130
 So when I feel like it, I really do. 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:23.240
 and how I did not want to be brunette 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.240
 I decided to be blonde and brunette 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:31.170
 I have seen some shade inspirations and 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.939
 Harry, this is really far away from you. 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.990
 object is a worker I think it has to be 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:38.460
 but it's more to find the brown actually 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.710
 can be another aspect of 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.689
 oblige even then what I did I 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:46.020
 I wanted to make this change everything then 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:48.930
 speak I want to paint my root 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.060
 color of my hair I went in a hall and the 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.060
 my hair was blonde and snowy and should have 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:58.590
 seen a video of that hair tone and is 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:02.130
 What I told the girl is to paint pass 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:05.700
 here only at the root the tone dark blond 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:09.000
 The dark blond color then passed only 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:11.039
 here and you can see that in the 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.870
 I told the fringe to get the phrase 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:17.040
 whole then my front 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:20.010
 afternoon in the dark and you can then 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:23.340
 to see down here is my natural blond 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:26.670
 that was before and then she got 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:29.099
 here the fringe got this piece here and e 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.959
 did not play the Portuguese matches 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:33.659
 I did not do anything on days that ended 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:36.540
 was then this is very simple 

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:40.500
 very simple process it only happens in the 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:43.500
 or the ink in its root and 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.870
 and then it's over, who's ready already 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.390
 so it is 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.819
 I really liked the result because 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:53.579
 I think this hair is a hair more 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:56.160
 easy to take care of because for example 

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:58.260
 will not look like arraes that is 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.650
 very cool this very different too 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.250
 because if I put the hair so for 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.040
 back 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:07.980
 I get brunette if I make a tail like that 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:11.310
 You learn my hair, I get brunette. 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:14.159
 so I can stay blond and brunette is 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.989
 very cool I loved the result and I wanted 

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:18.299
 see and share with you 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:19.980
 girls who are blond and do not want 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:21.540
 stay moraines 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.090
 this is a good alternative for those who have 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.739
 one more hair is you need a 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.750
 treatment that needs hydration 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:30.870
 in the hair and one wants to be doing the 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:33.480
 lights and likes Moorish so this is a 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:35.940
 good alternative is then this is it I hope 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:38.459
 that you liked this tip did not 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.859
 tell me that you thought that I am 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:43.889
 Blonde is so thinking of doing it though 

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:45.480
 A kiss too, girls. 

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:46.290
 forget to write my networks 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.010
 social 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.010
 to the next
