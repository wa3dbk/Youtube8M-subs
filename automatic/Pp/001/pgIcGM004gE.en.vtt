00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
race or round yeah I like Lorenzo he's a

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.350 
race or round yeah I like Lorenzo he's a
good<00:01:55.140> rider<00:01:55.320> like<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:55.890> yam<00:01:56.340> right<00:01:56.549> isn't<00:01:57.180> as

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
good rider like the yam right isn't as

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.719 
good rider like the yam right isn't as
good<00:01:57.509> as<00:01:57.689> the<00:01:57.840> onder<00:01:58.200> so<00:01:59.040> you<00:01:59.430> know<00:01:59.549> I<00:01:59.580> think

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
good as the onder so you know I think

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.090 
good as the onder so you know I think
he's<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.149> best<00:02:00.299> rider<00:02:00.540> he<00:02:01.350> could<00:02:01.500> race<00:02:01.710> good

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
he's the best rider he could race good

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.219 
he's the best rider he could race good
race<00:02:02.310> but<00:02:02.670> with<00:02:03.180> a<00:02:03.210> rather<00:02:03.390> Marquez<00:02:03.869> held<00:02:04.110> his

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
race but with a rather Marquez held his

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:05.930 
race but with a rather Marquez held his
position<00:02:04.380> once<00:02:04.830> he<00:02:04.979> got<00:02:05.070> Avastin<00:02:05.580> but<00:02:05.789> I

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:05.940 
position once he got Avastin but I

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.359 
position once he got Avastin but I
suppose<00:02:06.210> that's<00:02:06.509> a<00:02:06.860> that's<00:02:07.860> the<00:02:08.069> whole<00:02:08.220> key

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
suppose that's a that's the whole key

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:09.949 
suppose that's a that's the whole key
