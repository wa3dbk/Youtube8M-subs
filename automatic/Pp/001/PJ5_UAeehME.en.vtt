00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:33.670
 our canal to a round bloc party 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:35.260

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.450

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.770
 our squad is last trap and me 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:41.080
 actually minister trap and pull 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:43.510
 but script did not necessarily then 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:47.739

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.930
 maybe some of firefox know that 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:00.910
 So my former subscribers 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.650
 installations to subscribers not yet 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:06.250
 what's going on here and wanted that 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:07.870
 explain and that's what I thought 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.850
 to stop youtube because I do not 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:13.120
 lust more videos alone 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:16.240
 but there love is 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:18.760
 offered to participate and now have 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:35.530
 we have a channel together and that is full 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:37.480
 cool and yes we really wanted this 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.700
 Wise money or so because I'm in 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:41.830
 kooyong has discovered on youtube amount 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.540
 that is totally exciting and I wanted to 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:45.010
 Just put it in the cut 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:47.290
 then let's see if I do it too 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:54.210
 which of the total needs to be between 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:54.210
 Lost come Ausraster voice comes 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:02:03.100
 one of them is the brother in youtube 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:05.020
 In the old age that's awesome and by the way 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.340
 namely were with camtasia also I know 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.869
 not like it economically now 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.920
 camtasia recorded I hope it will 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:25.810
 good because forum is spinning it's easy 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:27.400
 not at all historically good day 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.610
 They say that I changed the money 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.610
 to have 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:51.930
 I know that's our motto 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:51.930
 the value 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:14.390
 yellow bonnies I made it and 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:18.830
 there are still five dancers to give her 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:22.130
 most of the horny are so evaluation 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:24.580
 We also have people ranked 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:24.580
 to have 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:36.040
 no, they are not conceited that 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:36.040
 Just say so I know it's coming 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:42.530
 he conceited himself conceited 

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:44.570
 call character because I too 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:46.760
 Ours do not just come over here 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:49.030
 many say both of us find ourselves outside and 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.030
 sausage 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:04.770
 I will definitely be there now 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:06.210
 So one word is not right 

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:10.280
 that word is one sentence from the one 

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:10.280
 I hope I have objected 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:26.280
 a round I take up now and 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:28.080
 then the dear mystery takes a turn 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:33.720
 neither the 25 years we go on 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:35.700
 this post will be so then he will 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:39.560
 which if that works as I said record 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:39.560
 so have the same recorded 

00:05:13.409 --> 00:05:33.159
 Our saying did not come about by chance 

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:35.740
 if it is not said so yes we need 

00:05:33.159 --> 00:05:38.939
 a saying that sounds fully conceited 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:41.500
 but rather for me to be able to 

00:05:38.939 --> 00:05:53.349
 I think we are pushing now and 

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:56.529
 do everything you have to mention if 

00:05:53.349 --> 00:06:00.580
 my video said that we are in the 

00:05:56.529 --> 00:06:03.129
 next year, although the project counts 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:06.240
 not if you might be interested yes 

00:06:03.129 --> 00:06:06.240
 Write my comments 

00:06:14.189 --> 00:06:18.899
 I have artificial tension 

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:25.539
 the feeling i have for a team 

00:06:23.199 --> 00:06:31.080
 just which one wanted to create 

00:06:25.539 --> 00:06:31.080
 just like that 

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:42.169
 my tactics and ronja easy i hate 

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:43.880
 these people always after the first one 

00:06:42.169 --> 00:06:48.800
 round the same as you write that 

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:50.690
 that is really nasty so unnecessary that 

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:53.570
 ends in the second round 

00:06:50.690 --> 00:07:08.300
 that is yes I am all alone in here 

00:06:53.570 --> 00:07:10.910
 the corner yes I see that with the texture 

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:13.639
 just do not pack so well 

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:20.660
 now really does not write on me 

00:07:13.639 --> 00:07:21.860
 say yes okay then yes what that 

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:24.080
 this recording 

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:26.060
 it will not be after or before 

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:28.850
 guess who quick opel has one more 

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:30.190
 round come from mississippi 

00:07:28.850 --> 00:07:34.000
 skepticism 

00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:34.000
 and then bye
