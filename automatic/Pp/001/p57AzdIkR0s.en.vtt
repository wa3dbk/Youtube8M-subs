00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.020 
for like a magician it's a little

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:42.870 
for like a magician it's a little
different<00:02:41.170> than<00:02:41.410> other<00:02:41.640> variety<00:02:42.640> arts

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
different than other variety arts

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.450 
different than other variety arts
because<00:02:43.060> you<00:02:43.660> do<00:02:43.870> practice<00:02:44.410> and<00:02:44.650> train<00:02:45.010> to<00:02:45.370> get

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:45.460 
because you do practice and train to get

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:47.160 
because you do practice and train to get
it<00:02:45.580> right<00:02:45.790> the<00:02:46.000> first<00:02:46.030> time<00:02:46.420> if<00:02:46.780> you<00:02:46.930> don't<00:02:47.080> get

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
it right the first time if you don't get

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:48.330 
it right the first time if you don't get
ready<00:02:47.410> first<00:02:47.650> time<00:02:47.830> when<00:02:48.010> you're<00:02:48.130> just<00:02:48.280> a

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
ready first time when you're just a

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.490 
ready first time when you're just a
terrible<00:02:48.520> magician<00:02:48.790> to<00:02:49.150> any<00:02:49.780> options<00:02:50.320> right

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
terrible magician to any options right

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.350 
terrible magician to any options right
so<00:02:51.160> the<00:02:51.280> fact<00:02:51.490> that<00:02:51.550> it<00:02:51.700> was<00:02:51.820> life<00:02:52.060> didn't

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
so the fact that it was life didn't

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.180 
so the fact that it was life didn't
necessarily<00:02:52.560> play<00:02:53.560> with<00:02:53.710> you<00:02:53.830> too<00:02:54.010> much
