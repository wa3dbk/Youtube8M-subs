00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:02.490 
what's going on you do reflects it was

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:04.999 
what's going on you do reflects it was
another<00:00:02.700> minecraft<00:00:02.970> video<00:00:03.300> and<00:00:03.750> yeah<00:00:04.680> today

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
another minecraft video and yeah today

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.000 
another minecraft video and yeah today
I've<00:00:05.160> kind<00:00:05.430> of<00:00:05.520> diverted<00:00:06.210> from<00:00:06.420> redstone<00:00:07.259> a

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
I've kind of diverted from redstone a

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.520 
I've kind of diverted from redstone a
little<00:00:08.429> bit<00:00:08.639> um<00:00:08.880> and<00:00:09.599> I've<00:00:09.809> gone<00:00:09.990> to<00:00:10.260> the

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
little bit um and I've gone to the

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.629 
little bit um and I've gone to the
miscellaneous<00:00:11.099> parts<00:00:11.519> of<00:00:12.860> Minecraft<00:00:13.860> and<00:00:14.130> I

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
miscellaneous parts of Minecraft and I

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.330 
miscellaneous parts of Minecraft and I
recently<00:00:15.120> had<00:00:15.509> a<00:00:15.540> look<00:00:15.719> video<00:00:16.590> from<00:00:16.980> seth

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
recently had a look video from seth

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.769 
recently had a look video from seth
bling<00:00:17.490> and<00:00:18.590> he<00:00:19.590> had<00:00:19.980> a<00:00:20.430> very<00:00:20.850> compact<00:00:21.270> water

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
bling and he had a very compact water

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.400 
bling and he had a very compact water
and<00:00:22.050> lava<00:00:22.939> or<00:00:23.939> double<00:00:24.390> coppiced<00:00:24.720> cobblestone

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
and lava or double coppiced cobblestone

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.800 
and lava or double coppiced cobblestone
generator<00:00:25.439> now<00:00:26.400> I've<00:00:26.609> managed<00:00:27.150> to<00:00:27.180> reduce<00:00:27.420> his

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
generator now I've managed to reduce his

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.460 
generator now I've managed to reduce his
design<00:00:28.230> by<00:00:28.529> one<00:00:28.859> block<00:00:29.130> and<00:00:29.779> it's<00:00:30.779> a<00:00:31.019> bit<00:00:31.289> more

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
design by one block and it's a bit more

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.990 
design by one block and it's a bit more
efficient<00:00:31.980> I<00:00:32.510> can<00:00:33.510> say<00:00:33.780> though<00:00:34.050> I<00:00:34.640> i<00:00:35.640> only

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
efficient I can say though I i only

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.900 
efficient I can say though I i only
changed<00:00:36.239> one<00:00:36.600> thing<00:00:36.780> with<00:00:37.170> it<00:00:37.489> actually<00:00:38.489> to

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
changed one thing with it actually to

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.180 
changed one thing with it actually to
two<00:00:39.270> main<00:00:39.570> things<00:00:39.960> but<00:00:40.320> that<00:00:40.350> allowed<00:00:41.040> the

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
two main things but that allowed the

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.040 
two main things but that allowed the
result<00:00:41.489> to<00:00:41.610> be<00:00:41.640> a<00:00:41.940> little<00:00:42.239> bit<00:00:42.390> more<00:00:42.540> efficient

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
result to be a little bit more efficient

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.260 
result to be a little bit more efficient
and<00:00:43.410> yeah<00:00:44.370> it's<00:00:44.489> pretty<00:00:44.579> good<00:00:44.700> so<00:00:44.940> you<00:00:45.030> can<00:00:45.149> get

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
and yeah it's pretty good so you can get

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.660 
and yeah it's pretty good so you can get
this<00:00:46.200> kind<00:00:46.440> of<00:00:46.559> pattern<00:00:46.860> going<00:00:47.039> and<00:00:47.309> then<00:00:47.430> you

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
this kind of pattern going and then you

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:56.360 
this kind of pattern going and then you
get<00:00:47.850> something<00:00:48.840> like<00:00:48.989> that<00:00:55.070> CJ<00:00:56.070> I<00:00:56.100> can't<00:00:56.280> like

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
get something like that CJ I can't like

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.860 
get something like that CJ I can't like
a<00:00:56.399> constant<00:00:56.910> supply<00:00:57.059> like<00:00:57.510> that<00:00:57.690> which<00:00:57.840> is

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
a constant supply like that which is

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.650 
a constant supply like that which is
which<00:00:58.260> is<00:00:58.410> pretty<00:00:58.829> pretty<00:00:59.670> cool<00:01:00.000> considering

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
which is pretty pretty cool considering

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.170 
which is pretty pretty cool considering
it's<00:01:00.840> um<00:01:01.050> and<00:01:01.829> then<00:01:01.949> he's<00:01:02.129> just<00:01:02.340> uh<00:01:02.550> two

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
it's um and then he's just uh two

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.960 
it's um and then he's just uh two
sources<00:01:03.660> and<00:01:04.140> you<00:01:05.010> don't<00:01:05.189> need<00:01:05.280> to<00:01:05.400> place<00:01:05.700> any

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
sources and you don't need to place any

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.560 
sources and you don't need to place any
blocks<00:01:06.330> as<00:01:06.720> Sethbling<00:01:07.590> said<00:01:07.799> so<00:01:08.520> yeah<00:01:09.299> the

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
blocks as Sethbling said so yeah the

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.539 
blocks as Sethbling said so yeah the
only<00:01:09.630> real<00:01:09.900> difference<00:01:10.140> between<00:01:10.860> his<00:01:11.159> design

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
only real difference between his design

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.730 
only real difference between his design
which<00:01:11.820> are<00:01:12.090> went<00:01:12.780> like<00:01:12.930> this<00:01:13.110> i<00:01:13.380> think<00:01:13.590> there

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
which are went like this i think there

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.870 
which are went like this i think there
was<00:01:13.860> a<00:01:13.890> one<00:01:14.580> there<00:01:15.830> one<00:01:16.830> there<00:01:16.860> and<00:01:17.790> i<00:01:17.850> was

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
was a one there one there and i was

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.410 
was a one there one there and i was
water<00:01:18.210> there<00:01:18.360> and<00:01:19.369> there<00:01:20.369> was<00:01:20.460> a<00:01:20.490> hole<00:01:20.729> here

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
water there and there was a hole here

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.740 
water there and there was a hole here
and<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:21.990> lava<00:01:22.820> stretched<00:01:23.820> out<00:01:24.060> to<00:01:24.360> an<00:01:24.450> extra

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
and the lava stretched out to an extra

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.160 
and the lava stretched out to an extra
block<00:01:24.930> so<00:01:25.200> only<00:01:25.770> took<00:01:25.979> it<00:01:26.130> down<00:01:26.280> one<00:01:26.490> dimension

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
block so only took it down one dimension

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.109 
block so only took it down one dimension
but<00:01:28.170> what<00:01:28.350> I<00:01:28.380> did<00:01:28.710> that<00:01:28.740> was<00:01:28.920> pretty<00:01:29.280> cool<00:01:29.640> was

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
but what I did that was pretty cool was

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.780 
but what I did that was pretty cool was
I<00:01:30.450> took<00:01:30.780> away<00:01:31.229> these<00:01:31.590> blocks<00:01:31.979> under<00:01:32.310> here<00:01:32.579> and

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
I took away these blocks under here and

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.880 
I took away these blocks under here and
that<00:01:33.450> meant<00:01:33.720> that<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.079> lover<00:01:34.500> actually

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
that meant that the lover actually

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.100 
that meant that the lover actually
didn't<00:01:35.549> have<00:01:35.700> to<00:01:35.880> flow<00:01:36.090> an<00:01:36.240> extra<00:01:36.570> block<00:01:36.780> as

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
didn't have to flow an extra block as

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.679 
didn't have to flow an extra block as
you<00:01:37.740> can<00:01:37.829> see<00:01:38.040> here<00:01:38.400> so<00:01:38.939> I've<00:01:39.240> taken<00:01:39.479> away

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
you can see here so I've taken away

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.510 
you can see here so I've taken away
these<00:01:39.869> blocks<00:01:40.170> under<00:01:40.439> here<00:01:40.619> so<00:01:40.829> I<00:01:41.070> quickly

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
these blocks under here so I quickly

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.719 
these blocks under here so I quickly
build<00:01:41.850> it<00:01:42.150> so<00:01:42.869> you<00:01:42.930> have<00:01:43.590> what<00:01:44.100> sibling<00:01:44.579> and

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
build it so you have what sibling and

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.090 
build it so you have what sibling and
see<00:01:44.909> stuff<00:01:45.180> with<00:01:45.509> your<00:01:45.780> two<00:01:45.960> blocks<00:01:46.259> like<00:01:46.860> that

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
see stuff with your two blocks like that

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.060 
see stuff with your two blocks like that
and<00:01:47.399> then<00:01:48.000> you<00:01:48.270> just<00:01:48.450> take<00:01:48.689> another<00:01:49.500> one<00:01:49.740> under

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
and then you just take another one under

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.730 
and then you just take another one under
there<00:01:50.670> like<00:01:51.000> that<00:01:51.210> and<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:52.020> larvae<00:01:52.409> right<00:01:52.530> one

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
there like that and the larvae right one

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.880 
there like that and the larvae right one
like<00:01:52.920> that<00:01:53.070> so<00:01:53.549> you<00:01:53.610> can<00:01:53.820> put<00:01:54.000> water<00:01:54.630> in<00:01:54.930> you

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
like that so you can put water in you

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.940 
like that so you can put water in you
can<00:01:56.070> just<00:01:56.219> whack<00:01:56.610> your<00:01:56.759> lover<00:01:56.939> like<00:01:57.149> that<00:01:57.950> and

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
can just whack your lover like that and

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.109 
can just whack your lover like that and
what<00:01:59.130> up<00:01:59.280> there's<00:01:59.610> your<00:01:59.700> cobblestone

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
what up there's your cobblestone

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.270 
what up there's your cobblestone
generator<00:02:00.619> and<00:02:01.619> what's<00:02:01.799> really<00:02:01.950> cool<00:02:02.100> about

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
generator and what's really cool about

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.710 
generator and what's really cool about
this<00:02:02.610> design<00:02:02.969> is<00:02:03.649> there<00:02:04.649> is<00:02:04.890> much

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
this design is there is much

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.740 
this design is there is much
less<00:02:05.810> of<00:02:05.930> a<00:02:06.020> chance<00:02:06.290> oddly<00:02:07.070> for<00:02:07.730> them<00:02:08.000> for<00:02:08.509> the

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
less of a chance oddly for them for the

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.560 
less of a chance oddly for them for the
any<00:02:09.500> of<00:02:09.740> the<00:02:09.920> drug<00:02:10.369> drop<00:02:11.000> see<00:02:11.180> you<00:02:11.270> get<00:02:11.420> from

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:11.570 
any of the drug drop see you get from

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:14.470 
any of the drug drop see you get from
this<00:02:11.890> from<00:02:12.890> the<00:02:12.980> cobblestone<00:02:13.460> to<00:02:14.000> go<00:02:14.210> into<00:02:14.390> the

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
this from the cobblestone to go into the

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.810 
this from the cobblestone to go into the
lava<00:02:14.660> and<00:02:15.140> that<00:02:15.860> was<00:02:15.980> a<00:02:16.010> really<00:02:16.250> weird<00:02:16.520> thing<00:02:16.640> I

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:16.820 
lava and that was a really weird thing I

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:18.850 
lava and that was a really weird thing I
found<00:02:17.120> because<00:02:17.450> when<00:02:17.660> i<00:02:17.690> was<00:02:17.990> using<00:02:18.200> siblings

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
found because when i was using siblings

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.760 
found because when i was using siblings
design<00:02:19.220> i<00:02:19.520> found<00:02:20.270> that<00:02:20.420> i<00:02:20.600> actually<00:02:21.260> was

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
design i found that i actually was

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.180 
design i found that i actually was
losing<00:02:22.610> a<00:02:22.700> lot<00:02:22.850> more<00:02:23.030> blocks<00:02:23.530> than<00:02:24.530> I<00:02:24.860> would

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
losing a lot more blocks than I would

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.660 
losing a lot more blocks than I would
with<00:02:25.220> my<00:02:25.520> design<00:02:25.850> so<00:02:26.180> I<00:02:26.960> would<00:02:27.620> recommend<00:02:27.670> this

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
with my design so I would recommend this

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.990 
with my design so I would recommend this
one<00:02:28.730> over<00:02:29.630> many<00:02:30.020> other<00:02:30.200> designs<00:02:30.760> as<00:02:31.760> you<00:02:31.910> can

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
one over many other designs as you can

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.490 
one over many other designs as you can
see<00:02:32.240> it's<00:02:33.100> three<00:02:34.100> x<00:02:34.700> I<00:02:35.180> think<00:02:35.570> five<00:02:35.990> one<00:02:36.470> two

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
see it's three x I think five one two

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.460 
see it's three x I think five one two
three<00:02:37.430> bed<00:02:37.580> for<00:02:37.820> then<00:02:38.110> yeah<00:02:39.110> of<00:02:39.170> course<00:02:39.350> is

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
three bed for then yeah of course is

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.580 
three bed for then yeah of course is
through<00:02:39.620> before<00:02:40.000> but<00:02:41.000> I<00:02:41.300> did<00:02:41.660> have<00:02:42.230> a<00:02:42.290> few

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:42.590 
through before but I did have a few

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.260 
through before but I did have a few
other<00:02:42.770> variations<00:02:43.370> that<00:02:43.430> I<00:02:43.550> decided<00:02:43.850> to<00:02:43.970> try

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:44.270 
other variations that I decided to try

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:45.640 
other variations that I decided to try
and<00:02:44.360> build<00:02:44.480> over<00:02:44.690> there<00:02:44.900> by<00:02:45.020> just<00:02:45.230> destroyed

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
and build over there by just destroyed

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.080 
and build over there by just destroyed
them<00:02:45.890> because<00:02:46.130> they<00:02:46.640> involved<00:02:46.970> you're

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
them because they involved you're

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.320 
them because they involved you're
actually<00:02:47.209> standing<00:02:47.630> the<00:02:47.959> water<00:02:48.170> because<00:02:48.800> I

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
actually standing the water because I

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.500 
actually standing the water because I
imagined<00:02:50.330> that<00:02:50.600> you<00:02:51.290> would<00:02:51.440> be<00:02:51.590> able<00:02:51.620> to<00:02:51.890> stand

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
imagined that you would be able to stand

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.640 
imagined that you would be able to stand
in<00:02:53.510> the<00:02:53.570> water<00:02:53.840> that<00:02:53.959> are<00:02:54.260> pushing<00:02:54.410> you

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
in the water that are pushing you

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.040 
in the water that are pushing you
anywhere<00:02:54.980> but<00:02:55.190> now<00:02:55.700> that<00:02:55.880> I<00:02:55.910> look<00:02:56.120> at<00:02:56.270> it<00:02:56.480> it's

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.050 
anywhere but now that I look at it it's

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:00.420 
anywhere but now that I look at it it's
actually<00:02:57.200> flowing<00:02:58.540> which<00:02:59.540> you<00:03:00.050> know<00:03:00.200> I

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
actually flowing which you know I

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.320 
actually flowing which you know I
imagined<00:03:01.430> it<00:03:01.490> actually<00:03:01.850> wouldn't<00:03:02.150> know<00:03:02.300> that

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:02.330 
imagined it actually wouldn't know that

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:03.460 
imagined it actually wouldn't know that
point<00:03:02.660> but<00:03:02.780> I<00:03:02.840> think<00:03:03.050> that's<00:03:03.140> just<00:03:03.260> because

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
point but I think that's just because

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:05.890 
point but I think that's just because
over<00:03:04.250> the<00:03:04.520> settings<00:03:05.000> i<00:03:05.120> had<00:03:05.240> optifine<00:03:05.690> on

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
over the settings i had optifine on

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.220 
over the settings i had optifine on
where<00:03:06.080> I'd<00:03:06.500> turned<00:03:06.830> off<00:03:06.950> water<00:03:07.250> animations<00:03:08.230> um

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
where I'd turned off water animations um

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.920 
where I'd turned off water animations um
but<00:03:09.920> yeah<00:03:10.160> I<00:03:10.640> hope<00:03:11.120> you<00:03:11.269> guys<00:03:11.420> enjoyed<00:03:11.780> this

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
but yeah I hope you guys enjoyed this

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.979 
but yeah I hope you guys enjoyed this
video<00:03:12.170> this<00:03:12.440> is<00:03:12.590> a<00:03:12.620> super<00:03:13.310> compact<00:03:13.640> or<00:03:14.360> more

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:14.989 
video this is a super compact or more

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:17.620 
video this is a super compact or more
compact<00:03:15.320> than<00:03:15.410> settings<00:03:16.269> don't<00:03:17.269> mean<00:03:17.420> to<00:03:17.510> be

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
compact than settings don't mean to be

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.630 
compact than settings don't mean to be
mean<00:03:17.780> but<00:03:17.840> a<00:03:18.170> double<00:03:19.100> cobblestone<00:03:19.610> generator

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
mean but a double cobblestone generator

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.199 
mean but a double cobblestone generator
this<00:03:20.630> can<00:03:20.900> be<00:03:20.930> expanded<00:03:21.530> even<00:03:22.400> longer<00:03:22.850> along

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 
this can be expanded even longer along

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:26.830 
this can be expanded even longer along
there<00:03:23.830> to<00:03:24.830> become<00:03:25.340> a<00:03:25.550> triple<00:03:26.120> or<00:03:26.360> even<00:03:26.420> a

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
there to become a triple or even a

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.770 
there to become a triple or even a
quadruple<00:03:27.530> which<00:03:28.190> i<00:03:28.400> think<00:03:28.459> is<00:03:28.820> really<00:03:29.570> cool

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
quadruple which i think is really cool

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:32.800 
quadruple which i think is really cool
and<00:03:30.650> I<00:03:31.340> probably<00:03:31.550> do<00:03:31.790> a<00:03:31.820> video<00:03:32.060> on<00:03:32.180> that<00:03:32.269> if<00:03:32.690> I

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
and I probably do a video on that if I

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:34.360 
and I probably do a video on that if I
manage<00:03:32.989> to<00:03:33.050> find<00:03:33.350> more<00:03:33.739> efficient<00:03:34.100> way<00:03:34.190> than

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
manage to find more efficient way than

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:36.610 
manage to find more efficient way than
what<00:03:34.489> I've<00:03:34.580> already<00:03:34.670> attempted<00:03:35.450> so<00:03:36.049> but<00:03:36.590> uh

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
what I've already attempted so but uh

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.320 
what I've already attempted so but uh
yeah<00:03:37.190> I<00:03:37.220> hope<00:03:37.430> you<00:03:37.580> guys<00:03:37.700> enjoyed<00:03:38.000> this<00:03:38.120> video
