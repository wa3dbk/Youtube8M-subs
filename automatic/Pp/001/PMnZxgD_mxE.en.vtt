things inexpensively or free and this is

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.919 
things inexpensively or free and this is
a<00:00:09.300> great<00:00:09.570> example<00:00:10.759> this<00:00:11.759> is<00:00:12.000> an<00:00:12.179> Asian<00:00:12.330> pumpkin

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
a great example this is an Asian pumpkin

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.799 
a great example this is an Asian pumpkin
also<00:00:13.530> known<00:00:13.740> as<00:00:13.920> a<00:00:13.950> kombucha<00:00:14.639> and<00:00:15.120> they're

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
also known as a kombucha and they're

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.390 
also known as a kombucha and they're
very<00:00:16.020> sweet<00:00:16.260> and<00:00:16.800> delicious<00:00:17.190> and<00:00:18.109> these<00:00:19.400> giant

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
very sweet and delicious and these giant

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.580 
very sweet and delicious and these giant
vines<00:00:21.230> all<00:00:22.230> of<00:00:22.650> this<00:00:22.830> action<00:00:23.930> or<00:00:24.930> actually

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
vines all of this action or actually

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.130 
vines all of this action or actually
somewhat<00:00:26.099> free<00:00:26.430> because<00:00:27.300> all<00:00:27.480> we<00:00:27.630> did<00:00:27.810> is<00:00:27.990> we

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
somewhat free because all we did is we

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.550 
somewhat free because all we did is we
save<00:00:28.920> the<00:00:29.189> seeds<00:00:29.550> from<00:00:30.300> one<00:00:30.630> that<00:00:30.840> we<00:00:30.990> ate<00:00:31.230> and

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
save the seeds from one that we ate and

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.180 
save the seeds from one that we ate and
we<00:00:33.260> germinate<00:00:34.260> dried<00:00:34.739> them<00:00:34.920> out<00:00:35.040> and

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
we germinate dried them out and

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.360 
we germinate dried them out and
germinated<00:00:35.820> them<00:00:36.000> and<00:00:36.270> got<00:00:36.980> dozens<00:00:37.980> of<00:00:38.190> them

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
germinated them and got dozens of them

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.660 
germinated them and got dozens of them
for<00:00:38.610> free<00:00:38.879> now<00:00:40.129> instead<00:00:41.129> of<00:00:41.219> growing<00:00:41.370> them<00:00:41.579> on

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
for free now instead of growing them on

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.970 
for free now instead of growing them on
the<00:00:41.790> ground<00:00:42.000> like<00:00:42.180> I<00:00:42.300> usually<00:00:42.480> do<00:00:42.840> this<00:00:43.530> year<00:00:43.800> I

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
the ground like I usually do this year I

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.970 
the ground like I usually do this year I
trellis<00:00:44.460> them<00:00:44.700> up<00:00:44.879> on<00:00:45.149> strings<00:00:45.660> up<00:00:46.320> into<00:00:46.800> my

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
trellis them up on strings up into my

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.369 
trellis them up on strings up into my
trees<00:00:47.670> and<00:00:48.030> so<00:00:48.750> they're<00:00:48.899> actually<00:00:48.989> doing<00:00:49.200> a

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
trees and so they're actually doing a

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:50.720 
trees and so they're actually doing a
lot<00:00:49.500> better<00:00:49.770> because<00:00:49.950> animals<00:00:50.520> aren't

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
lot better because animals aren't

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.600 
lot better because animals aren't
chewing<00:00:51.059> on<00:00:51.210> them<00:00:51.680> the<00:00:52.680> trick<00:00:52.980> is<00:00:53.190> when<00:00:53.460> you're

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
chewing on them the trick is when you're

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.520 
chewing on them the trick is when you're
growing<00:00:53.850> these<00:00:54.180> though<00:00:54.480> not<00:00:54.989> only<00:00:55.260> do<00:00:55.410> they

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
growing these though not only do they

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.720 
growing these though not only do they
like<00:00:55.739> an<00:00:56.120> ample<00:00:57.120> amount<00:00:57.390> of<00:00:57.510> water<00:00:58.340> but<00:00:59.340> our

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
like an ample amount of water but our

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.000 
like an ample amount of water but our
big<00:01:00.030> question<00:01:00.420> was<00:01:00.600> after<00:01:01.379> we<00:01:01.500> picked<00:01:01.800> them

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
big question was after we picked them

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.979 
big question was after we picked them
why<00:01:02.430> weren't<00:01:02.670> they<00:01:02.879> really<00:01:03.210> sweet<00:01:03.480> we<00:01:03.660> figured

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
why weren't they really sweet we figured

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.109 
why weren't they really sweet we figured
you<00:01:04.199> know<00:01:04.229> they're<00:01:04.619> organic<00:01:05.280> and<00:01:05.610> they're

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
you know they're organic and they're

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.179 
you know they're organic and they're
fresh<00:01:06.510> they<00:01:07.140> should<00:01:07.350> be<00:01:07.470> more<00:01:07.650> sweet<00:01:07.979> than<00:01:08.010> the

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
fresh they should be more sweet than the

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.940 
fresh they should be more sweet than the
ones<00:01:08.430> at<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.670> store<00:01:08.760> and<00:01:09.619> this<00:01:10.619> is<00:01:10.799> what<00:01:10.920> I

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
ones at the store and this is what I

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.980 
ones at the store and this is what I
found<00:01:11.220> out<00:01:11.520> you<00:01:11.760> have<00:01:11.970> to<00:01:12.150> after<00:01:12.360> you<00:01:12.540> cut<00:01:12.750> them

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
found out you have to after you cut them

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.080 
found out you have to after you cut them
they<00:01:13.830> have<00:01:13.979> to<00:01:14.100> be<00:01:14.189> fully<00:01:14.369> ripe<00:01:14.700> and<00:01:14.939> how<00:01:15.030> you

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
they have to be fully ripe and how you

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.060 
they have to be fully ripe and how you
know<00:01:15.330> if<00:01:15.450> they're<00:01:15.630> ripe<00:01:15.869> is<00:01:16.140> they<00:01:16.799> get<00:01:17.009> a

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
know if they're ripe is they get a

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.359 
know if they're ripe is they get a
slight<00:01:18.170> corking<00:01:19.170> on<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.470> stem<00:01:19.799> you'll<00:01:20.130> see

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
slight corking on the stem you'll see

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:21.859 
slight corking on the stem you'll see
like<00:01:20.580> it's<00:01:20.790> brown<00:01:21.119> they'll<00:01:21.390> be<00:01:21.509> like<00:01:21.659> little

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
like it's brown they'll be like little

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.520 
like it's brown they'll be like little
tiny<00:01:22.110> cork<00:01:22.500> holes<00:01:22.710> and<00:01:23.159> or<00:01:23.939> there'll<00:01:24.810> be<00:01:24.930> a

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
tiny cork holes and or there'll be a

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.240 
tiny cork holes and or there'll be a
yellow<00:01:26.070> or<00:01:26.460> an<00:01:26.850> orange<00:01:27.180> blush<00:01:27.630> on<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.020> skin<00:01:28.979> of

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
yellow or an orange blush on the skin of

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.640 
yellow or an orange blush on the skin of
the<00:01:29.520> pumpkin<00:01:29.729> if<00:01:30.210> you're<00:01:30.869> growing<00:01:31.140> them<00:01:31.380> up<00:01:31.500> on

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
the pumpkin if you're growing them up on

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.289 
the pumpkin if you're growing them up on
a<00:01:31.710> trellis<00:01:31.950> like<00:01:32.250> that<00:01:32.490> you<00:01:32.670> can't<00:01:32.939> use<00:01:33.270> the

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
a trellis like that you can't use the

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.060 
a trellis like that you can't use the
traditional<00:01:34.020> method<00:01:34.350> of<00:01:34.470> seeing<00:01:34.799> from

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
traditional method of seeing from

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.859 
traditional method of seeing from
underneath<00:01:37.250> once<00:01:38.250> you<00:01:38.430> cut<00:01:38.700> them<00:01:38.939> and<00:01:39.150> they're

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
underneath once you cut them and they're

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.200 
underneath once you cut them and they're
mature<00:01:40.259> you<00:01:40.860> actually<00:01:41.369> have<00:01:41.549> to<00:01:41.729> select<00:01:42.000> them

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
mature you actually have to select them

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.300 
mature you actually have to select them
sit<00:01:42.509> for<00:01:42.540> like<00:01:42.810> six<00:01:43.229> weeks<00:01:43.350> somewhere<00:01:44.130> in<00:01:44.220> a

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
sit for like six weeks somewhere in a

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.429 
sit for like six weeks somewhere in a
cool<00:01:44.579> dry<00:01:44.850> place<00:01:44.970> like<00:01:45.570> in<00:01:45.720> a<00:01:45.780> closet<00:01:46.049> or<00:01:46.350> your

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
cool dry place like in a closet or your

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.039 
cool dry place like in a closet or your
basement<00:01:47.060> because<00:01:48.060> it's<00:01:48.240> at<00:01:48.360> that<00:01:48.540> point<00:01:48.869> that

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
basement because it's at that point that

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.380 
basement because it's at that point that
they<00:01:49.290> develop<00:01:49.770> their<00:01:50.180> carbohydrates<00:01:51.180> which

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
they develop their carbohydrates which

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.749 
they develop their carbohydrates which
turn<00:01:51.689> into<00:01:51.720> sugar<00:01:51.930> and<00:01:52.470> make<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:53.369> pumpkin

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
turn into sugar and make the pumpkin

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.760 
turn into sugar and make the pumpkin
actually<00:01:54.390> sweet<00:01:54.750> and<00:01:54.990> I<00:01:55.110> never<00:01:55.409> knew<00:01:55.649> this

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
actually sweet and I never knew this

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.959 
actually sweet and I never knew this
before<00:01:56.219> so<00:01:56.850> if<00:01:57.240> you<00:01:57.750> want<00:01:58.049> a<00:01:58.140> nice<00:01:58.320> sweet<00:01:58.969> Asian

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
before so if you want a nice sweet Asian

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.530 
before so if you want a nice sweet Asian
pumpkin<00:02:00.479> you<00:02:01.140> have<00:02:01.619> to<00:02:01.770> build<00:02:01.979> that<00:02:02.189> time<00:02:02.579> into

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
pumpkin you have to build that time into

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.929
