years actually been very tough for me I

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.920 
years actually been very tough for me I
knew<00:00:20.610> what<00:00:20.730> I<00:00:20.789> was<00:00:20.850> getting<00:00:20.940> myself<00:00:21.119> into<00:00:21.570> and

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
knew what I was getting myself into and

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.810 
knew what I was getting myself into and
I<00:00:21.990> knew<00:00:22.140> that<00:00:22.170> it<00:00:22.410> would<00:00:22.560> be<00:00:23.430> some<00:00:23.640> tough

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
I knew that it would be some tough

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.720 
I knew that it would be some tough
development<00:00:24.450> but<00:00:25.190> I've<00:00:26.190> had<00:00:26.370> a<00:00:26.400> couple<00:00:26.580> of

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
development but I've had a couple of

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.970 
development but I've had a couple of
pretty<00:00:27.150> rough<00:00:27.390> events<00:00:27.780> but<00:00:27.990> you<00:00:28.740> know<00:00:28.830> the

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
pretty rough events but you know the

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.950 
pretty rough events but you know the
positive<00:00:29.940> thing<00:00:30.150> for<00:00:30.180> me<00:00:30.450> is<00:00:30.480> I've<00:00:30.750> actually

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
positive thing for me is I've actually

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.930 
positive thing for me is I've actually
been<00:00:31.200> able<00:00:31.710> to<00:00:31.890> come<00:00:32.009> a<00:00:32.070> long<00:00:32.279> ways<00:00:32.489> with<00:00:32.759> my

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
been able to come a long ways with my

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.959 
been able to come a long ways with my
notes<00:00:33.270> and<00:00:33.600> actually<00:00:34.460> and<00:00:35.460> that's<00:00:35.640> actually

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
notes and actually and that's actually

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.340 
notes and actually and that's actually
been<00:00:36.090> my<00:00:36.210> biggest<00:00:36.420> problem<00:00:36.840> because<00:00:37.020> actually

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
been my biggest problem because actually

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.900 
been my biggest problem because actually
getting<00:00:37.559> in<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:37.890> car<00:00:38.070> and<00:00:38.430> getting<00:00:38.579> used<00:00:38.790> to

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
getting in the car and getting used to

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.340 
getting in the car and getting used to
the<00:00:39.000> car<00:00:39.180> and<00:00:39.210> getting<00:00:39.450> up<00:00:39.630> to<00:00:39.750> speeds<00:00:40.050> gone

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
the car and getting up to speeds gone

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.190 
the car and getting up to speeds gone
quite<00:00:40.740> well<00:00:40.950> I<00:00:41.340> didn't<00:00:42.030> think<00:00:42.180> by<00:00:42.450> my<00:00:42.660> second

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
quite well I didn't think by my second

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.290 
quite well I didn't think by my second
rally<00:00:43.380> I<00:00:43.530> would<00:00:44.010> be<00:00:44.130> able<00:00:44.280> to<00:00:44.340> put<00:00:44.460> in<00:00:44.610> you<00:00:45.239> know

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
rally I would be able to put in you know

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.540 
rally I would be able to put in you know
sixth<00:00:45.810> overall<00:00:46.140> times<00:00:46.530> which<00:00:46.829> I<00:00:46.980> did<00:00:47.130> three

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
sixth overall times which I did three

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.360 
sixth overall times which I did three
times<00:00:47.820> in<00:00:48.210> Turkey<00:00:48.600> but<00:00:49.170> overall<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:50.010> event

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
times in Turkey but overall the event

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.340 
times in Turkey but overall the event
the<00:00:50.730> overall<00:00:51.060> results<00:00:51.570> haven't<00:00:51.870> been<00:00:52.140> what<00:00:52.320> I

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
the overall results haven't been what I

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.340 
the overall results haven't been what I
wanted<00:00:52.739> and<00:00:52.920> I<00:00:53.010> think<00:00:53.670> just<00:00:54.510> smoothening<00:00:55.079> some

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
wanted and I think just smoothening some

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.440 
wanted and I think just smoothening some
of<00:00:55.470> that<00:00:55.680> out<00:00:55.710> and<00:00:55.950> getting<00:00:56.340> some<00:00:56.520> consistency

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:57.450 
of that out and getting some consistency

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:59.690 
of that out and getting some consistency
and<00:00:57.720> things<00:00:58.140> will<00:00:58.290> go<00:00:58.440> a<00:00:58.470> lot<00:00:58.620> better<00:00:58.680> you<00:00:59.550> have

00:00:59.690 --> 00:00:59.700 
and things will go a lot better you have

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.700 
and things will go a lot better you have
a<00:00:59.730> huge<00:01:00.149> fan<00:01:00.510> base<00:01:00.690> in<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.020> states<00:01:01.260> do<00:01:01.530> they

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
a huge fan base in the states do they

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.590
