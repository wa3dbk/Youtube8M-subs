time that you spray that stuff into the

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.980 
time that you spray that stuff into the
water<00:01:41.189> you're<00:01:42.179> actually<00:01:42.479> building<00:01:42.780> up<00:01:42.869> a

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
layer of that so sometimes they don't

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:46.639 
layer of that so sometimes they don't
work<00:01:45.539> and<00:01:45.780> you<00:01:45.899> just<00:01:45.929> have<00:01:46.200> to<00:01:46.259> clean<00:01:46.530> the
