 visit help tv hello friends the day of 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.189
 today 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:35.630
 I will be teaching them how to know 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:38.460
 how many cylinders of your car is this 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:41.100
 right now I'm in a car 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.160
 four cylinders good first thing that 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.870
 let's do is remove this cover to 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:48.899
 remove the two screws that have yes 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:52.680
 It has charges depending on your car 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:56.520
 you remove this cover and then what 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.079
 we remove and here we will see good this 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.420
 It's four cylinders because we know 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:05.610
 that has four spark plugs one 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:08.130
 2 3 and 4 to this car is 4 cylinders and 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:11.070
 As we can see, there are four guides 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:14.670
 that they also have the engine is small not 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:17.520
 is a big engine this the advantage of a 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:21.960
 four cylinder car is that we 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:24.159
 saves a lot of fuel and they are 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.920
 very cars 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:30.369
 and very effective in terms of saving 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:32.770
 fuel and now I show you a 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:35.950
 six cylinder truck good friends 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:39.340
 this here we are in a car 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:43.479
 six cylinders and how can they be 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:48.600
 account here with the spark plugs has three 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:51.380
 spark plugs on this side and let's go 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.840
 this other side 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.539
 and we 're going to see what the other 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.960
 three lucias also that can be given 

00:01:56.539 --> 00:02:02.420
 account 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:05.880
 there is 1 2 and 3 days 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:08.310
 the other spark plug this is in the background 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.760
 and if you can see it good there we can see 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.910
 the three spark plugs if they notice and are 

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:17.630
 to others it is a little bit more stable 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:21.300
 to the bottom but they are three spark plugs 1 2 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:25.170
 and 3 spark plugs this way we can give 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:27.480
 account that the car is six cylinders 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:30.150
 besides that the engine is much more 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.430
 great if you can account for the 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.700
 advantage of a six cylinder car is 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.160
 what 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:40.150
 it has much more power than a car 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:42.910
 of four cylinders and disadvantage in my 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:46.239
 opinion is that they spend more fuel 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:49.450
 really cars that run more bring a 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:52.870
 six cylinder engine to eight carlos 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:55.000
 cylinders because they are even stronger but 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.010
 it's the same concept they bring four of a 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.830
 side of four on the other side of that form 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:02.680
 you already know if the car is four 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:05.709
 of six or eight cylinders this is something 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:08.190
 very simple also that of eight 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:11.650
 cylinders will have two leaks back 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:14.470
 this is very easy the way to know how 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:19.150
 his car is four of six to eight 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:21.010
 cylinders I recommend if one is going to use 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:25.410
 a car I recommend the four 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:29.150
 cylinders because it's cheaper but 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:33.570
 that depends on the taste of each person 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:36.510
 but being 4 of 6 or 8 cylinders 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:39.150
 so the cars if we keep in good 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:41.340
 been if we keep them with a good 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:44.850
 maintenance because they will not yield 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:46.620
 pretty good friends that has been all 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:49.910
 for today I hope you can help them 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:52.970
 information that I gave them this we will be 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:55.220
 seeing us in the next 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:57.290
