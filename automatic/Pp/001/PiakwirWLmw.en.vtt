00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
different from the ones that we were

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.569 
different from the ones that we were
just<00:00:39.180> looking<00:00:39.420> at<00:00:39.540> definitely<00:00:40.280> as<00:00:41.280> you<00:00:41.309> can

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
just looking at definitely as you can

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.670 
just looking at definitely as you can
see<00:00:41.790> there's<00:00:42.090> two<00:00:42.149> of<00:00:42.450> them<00:00:42.629> but<00:00:43.500> they

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
see there's two of them but they

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.049 
see there's two of them but they
actually<00:00:44.180> zip<00:00:45.180> together<00:00:46.489> and<00:00:47.489> hang<00:00:47.820> over<00:00:48.030> the

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
actually zip together and hang over the

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.860 
actually zip together and hang over the
rack<00:00:48.329> so<00:00:49.140> when<00:00:49.620> that<00:00:49.890> you<00:00:50.210> made<00:00:51.210> these<00:00:51.510> what

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
rack so when that you made these what

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.479 
rack so when that you made these what
was<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.170> first<00:00:52.410> step<00:00:52.649> how<00:00:52.860> did<00:00:53.010> you<00:00:53.129> decide

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
was the first step how did you decide

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.420 
was the first step how did you decide
how<00:00:53.640> big<00:00:53.879> they<00:00:54.059> were<00:00:54.090> gonna<00:00:54.390> be<00:00:54.660> for<00:00:55.020> instance

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:55.430 
how big they were gonna be for instance

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.369 
how big they were gonna be for instance
well<00:00:56.430> I<00:00:56.460> just<00:00:56.670> basically<00:00:57.660> thought<00:00:57.899> about<00:00:58.140> what

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
well I just basically thought about what

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.860 
well I just basically thought about what
I<00:00:58.410> wanted<00:00:58.829> them<00:00:59.039> for<00:00:59.370> family<00:01:00.300> that<00:01:00.480> was<00:01:00.629> just

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
I wanted them for family that was just

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.670 
I wanted them for family that was just
bringing<00:01:01.140> stuff<00:01:01.559> to<00:01:01.770> and<00:01:01.949> from<00:01:02.129> work

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:02.680 
bringing stuff to and from work

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.439 
bringing stuff to and from work
we<00:01:02.829> can<00:01:02.980> see<00:01:03.190> here<00:01:03.399> it<00:01:03.550> looks<00:01:03.610> pretty<00:01:03.820> simple

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:04.449 
we can see here it looks pretty simple

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:08.280 
we can see here it looks pretty simple
but<00:01:05.290> this<00:01:05.590> is<00:01:05.770> actually<00:01:05.920> all<00:01:06.310> that<00:01:06.520> I<00:01:06.610> used<00:01:07.290> to

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:08.290 
but this is actually all that I used to

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.890 
but this is actually all that I used to
make<00:01:08.470> these<00:01:08.680> panniers<00:01:09.190> the<00:01:09.850> simple<00:01:10.600> pattern

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:10.900 
make these panniers the simple pattern

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.020 
make these panniers the simple pattern
right<00:01:11.020> here<00:01:11.049> just<00:01:11.409> cut<00:01:11.590> out<00:01:11.710> of<00:01:11.920> some<00:01:12.159> squares

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.030 
right here just cut out of some squares

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.600 
right here just cut out of some squares
and<00:01:13.210> rectangles<00:01:13.270> paper<00:01:13.990> I<00:01:14.350> didn't<00:01:15.130> use<00:01:15.280> a<00:01:15.340> lot

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:15.610 
and rectangles paper I didn't use a lot

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.600 
and rectangles paper I didn't use a lot
of<00:01:15.640> tools<00:01:15.909> to<00:01:16.119> make<00:01:16.360> these<00:01:17.190> basically<00:01:18.190> stuff<00:01:18.520> I

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:18.610 
of tools to make these basically stuff I

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.800 
of tools to make these basically stuff I
just<00:01:18.820> had<00:01:18.909> lying<00:01:19.119> around<00:01:19.300> I<00:01:19.800> started<00:01:20.800> with

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
just had lying around I started with

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.590 
just had lying around I started with
some<00:01:22.810> polyester<00:01:23.770> canvas<00:01:24.220> the<00:01:25.090> liner<00:01:25.330> is<00:01:25.509> made

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
some polyester canvas the liner is made

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.200 
some polyester canvas the liner is made
of<00:01:25.810> a<00:01:25.899> ripstop<00:01:26.320> nylon<00:01:26.790> which<00:01:27.790> I<00:01:27.820> found<00:01:28.060> at<00:01:28.180> a

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.210 
of a ripstop nylon which I found at a

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.420 
of a ripstop nylon which I found at a
local<00:01:28.509> fabric<00:01:28.899> store<00:01:29.190> very<00:01:30.190> lightweight

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:30.430 
local fabric store very lightweight

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.090 
local fabric store very lightweight
material<00:01:31.180> and<00:01:31.540> it<00:01:31.750> resists<00:01:32.110> tears<00:01:32.380> so<00:01:33.070> I

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 
material and it resists tears so I

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.230 
material and it resists tears so I
thought<00:01:33.310> it<00:01:33.399> was<00:01:33.490> the<00:01:33.640> perfect<00:01:33.850> choice<00:01:34.180> for

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
thought it was the perfect choice for

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.620 
thought it was the perfect choice for
the<00:01:35.200> inside<00:01:35.940> also<00:01:36.940> just<00:01:37.240> a<00:01:37.300> little<00:01:37.539> bit

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
the inside also just a little bit

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.990 
the inside also just a little bit
weatherproof<00:01:38.200> which<00:01:38.410> is<00:01:38.560> nice<00:01:38.800> you<00:01:39.250> got<00:01:39.700> some

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 
weatherproof which is nice you got some

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.900 
weatherproof which is nice you got some
velcro<00:01:40.509> from<00:01:41.229> a<00:01:41.740> hardware<00:01:42.220> store<00:01:42.340> down<00:01:42.789> the

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:42.910 
velcro from a hardware store down the

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:45.690 
velcro from a hardware store down the
street<00:01:43.140> and<00:01:44.140> this<00:01:44.289> stuff<00:01:44.560> they<00:01:45.280> use<00:01:45.490> it<00:01:45.670> for

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
street and this stuff they use it for

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.940 
street and this stuff they use it for
embroidery<00:01:46.509> but<00:01:47.289> it's<00:01:47.440> just<00:01:47.590> kind<00:01:47.770> of<00:01:47.800> a

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
embroidery but it's just kind of a

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.160 
embroidery but it's just kind of a
stiffer<00:01:48.369> plastic<00:01:48.909> and<00:01:49.149> it<00:01:49.300> gives<00:01:49.450> it<00:01:49.600> an<00:01:49.990> ears

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
stiffer plastic and it gives it an ears

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.279 
stiffer plastic and it gives it an ears
a<00:01:50.229> little<00:01:50.530> bit<00:01:50.649> of<00:01:50.740> structure<00:01:51.630> put<00:01:52.630> a<00:01:52.659> liner<00:01:53.080> in

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:53.289 
a little bit of structure put a liner in

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:54.690 
a little bit of structure put a liner in
there<00:01:53.470> and<00:01:53.770> it<00:01:53.890> just<00:01:54.039> gives<00:01:54.190> it<00:01:54.310> a<00:01:54.399> little<00:01:54.429> bit

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
there and it just gives it a little bit

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.300 
there and it just gives it a little bit
of<00:01:54.789> shape<00:01:55.030> I<00:01:55.330> did<00:01:56.140> use<00:01:56.289> a<00:01:56.319> sewing<00:01:56.649> machine<00:01:56.800> for

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:57.310 
of shape I did use a sewing machine for

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.580 
of shape I did use a sewing machine for
these<00:01:57.509> just<00:01:58.509> a<00:01:58.600> lot<00:01:58.780> more<00:01:58.960> convenient<00:01:59.380> and

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
these just a lot more convenient and

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.070 
these just a lot more convenient and
goes<00:01:59.740> a<00:01:59.770> lot<00:01:59.979> quicker<00:02:00.390> if<00:02:01.390> you<00:02:01.600> had<00:02:01.720> a<00:02:01.750> lot<00:02:01.960> of

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.080 
goes a lot quicker if you had a lot of

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.870 
goes a lot quicker if you had a lot of
patience<00:02:02.500> I<00:02:02.679> imagine<00:02:03.280> you<00:02:03.369> could<00:02:03.520> do<00:02:03.670> it<00:02:03.759> with

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
patience I imagine you could do it with

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.490 
patience I imagine you could do it with
thread<00:02:04.210> and<00:02:04.390> needle<00:02:04.659> that<00:02:05.020> would<00:02:05.140> take<00:02:05.289> a<00:02:05.319> lot

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
thread and needle that would take a lot

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:06.960 
thread and needle that would take a lot
of<00:02:05.530> time<00:02:05.770> that<00:02:06.399> seems<00:02:06.759> pretty

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
of time that seems pretty

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:08.520 
of time that seems pretty
straightforward<00:02:07.780> and<00:02:07.959> I<00:02:08.080> think<00:02:08.289> that's<00:02:08.440> a

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
straightforward and I think that's a

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.680 
straightforward and I think that's a
nice<00:02:08.679> process<00:02:09.250> because<00:02:09.640> everyone's<00:02:10.539> gonna

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
nice process because everyone's gonna

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.240 
nice process because everyone's gonna
have<00:02:10.899> a<00:02:10.959> different<00:02:11.349> rack<00:02:11.560> I<00:02:11.830> noticed<00:02:12.220> that

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
have a different rack I noticed that

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.150 
have a different rack I noticed that
really<00:02:12.640> is<00:02:12.760> really<00:02:13.510> narrow<00:02:13.810> it's<00:02:14.380> not<00:02:14.709> very

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
really is really narrow it's not very

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.500 
really is really narrow it's not very
different<00:02:15.610> from<00:02:15.700> the<00:02:15.849> rack<00:02:16.000> that<00:02:16.209> I<00:02:16.239> have<00:02:16.390> on

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
different from the rack that I have on

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.020 
different from the rack that I have on
my<00:02:16.690> bike<00:02:16.930> for<00:02:17.470> instance<00:02:17.860> so<00:02:18.610> that's<00:02:18.790> a<00:02:18.879> good

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
my bike for instance so that's a good

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.690 
my bike for instance so that's a good
way<00:02:19.150> how<00:02:19.360> anyone<00:02:19.690> can<00:02:20.140> take<00:02:20.470> this<00:02:21.220> basic

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
way how anyone can take this basic

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.640 
way how anyone can take this basic
concept<00:02:21.940> and<00:02:22.480> apply<00:02:22.780> it<00:02:22.840> to<00:02:23.170> what<00:02:23.379> it<00:02:23.500> is<00:02:23.530> that

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
concept and apply it to what it is that

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.650 
concept and apply it to what it is that
they're<00:02:23.950> trying<00:02:24.129> to<00:02:24.310> create<00:02:24.580> sure<00:02:25.239> and<00:02:25.569> you

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
they're trying to create sure and you

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.339 
they're trying to create sure and you
can<00:02:25.810> even<00:02:25.959> use<00:02:26.080> newspaper<00:02:26.920> fabric<00:02:27.790> any<00:02:28.120> other
