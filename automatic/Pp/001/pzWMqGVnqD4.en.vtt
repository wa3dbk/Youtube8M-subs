00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:03.990 
but Pines pine trees and take a look at

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.550 
but Pines pine trees and take a look at
our<00:00:04.110> pines<00:00:04.350> over<00:00:04.710> here<00:00:05.330> see<00:00:06.330> some<00:00:07.049> pine<00:00:07.290> trees

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
our pines over here see some pine trees

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.650 
our pines over here see some pine trees
now<00:00:08.220> that<00:00:08.400> you<00:00:08.490> know<00:00:08.639> how<00:00:08.849> to<00:00:08.880> make<00:00:09.179> a<00:00:09.240> basic

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
now that you know how to make a basic

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.900 
now that you know how to make a basic
tree<00:00:10.290> I'll<00:00:10.710> show<00:00:10.889> you<00:00:10.950> how<00:00:11.099> to<00:00:11.160> do<00:00:11.340> Pines<00:00:11.580> a

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
tree I'll show you how to do Pines a

tree I'll show you how to do Pines a
bindery<00:00:12.750> is<00:00:13.019> a<00:00:13.849> cone<00:00:14.849> shaped<00:00:15.420> thing<00:00:15.780> so<00:00:16.080> on<00:00:16.320> our

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
bindery is a cone shaped thing so on our

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.710 
bindery is a cone shaped thing so on our
fiber<00:00:16.830> we're<00:00:17.130> going<00:00:17.340> to<00:00:17.460> lay<00:00:17.640> it<00:00:17.699> out<00:00:17.850> a<00:00:18.150> little

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
fiber we're going to lay it out a little

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.540 
fiber we're going to lay it out a little
bit<00:00:18.840> of<00:00:18.930> a<00:00:19.020> cone<00:00:19.260> shape<00:00:19.650> it's<00:00:20.189> going<00:00:20.369> to<00:00:20.460> be<00:00:20.520> a

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
bit of a cone shape it's going to be a

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.420 
bit of a cone shape it's going to be a
point<00:00:20.910> of<00:00:21.029> the<00:00:21.150> top<00:00:21.390> which<00:00:22.109> simulates<00:00:22.529> what

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
point of the top which simulates what

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.939 
point of the top which simulates what
the<00:00:23.609> pine<00:00:23.820> tree<00:00:24.029> does<00:00:24.240> it<00:00:24.990> also<00:00:25.199> you<00:00:25.800> get

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
the pine tree does it also you get

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.910 
the pine tree does it also you get
different<00:00:26.160> kinds<00:00:26.519> of<00:00:26.760> pains<00:00:27.060> you<00:00:27.390> get<00:00:27.920> droopy

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
different kinds of pains you get droopy

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.580 
different kinds of pains you get droopy
leaf<00:00:29.099> pine<00:00:29.429> spiky<00:00:30.179> ones<00:00:30.420> and<00:00:30.689> sort<00:00:31.260> of<00:00:31.320> semi

leaf pine spiky ones and sort of semi
spiked<00:00:31.949> ones<00:00:32.309> and<00:00:32.640> you<00:00:32.790> get<00:00:32.969> them<00:00:33.120> in

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
spiked ones and you get them in

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.389 
spiked ones and you get them in
different<00:00:33.239> colors<00:00:33.690> we've<00:00:34.140> done<00:00:34.440> medium<00:00:35.130> or

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
different colors we've done medium or

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.819 
different colors we've done medium or
light<00:00:35.640> depending<00:00:36.180> on<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.420> title<00:00:36.840> my<00:00:37.050> tree<00:00:37.290> so

light depending on the title my tree so

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.889 
light depending on the title my tree so
we<00:00:38.190> go<00:00:38.340> through<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:38.760> same<00:00:39.000> process<00:00:39.629> of

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
we go through the same process of

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:45.080 
we go through the same process of
combing<00:00:40.829> out<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.879> fibers<00:00:42.360> and<00:00:42.829> then<00:00:43.829> cut<00:00:44.579> and

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
combing out the fibers and then cut and

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.010 
combing out the fibers and then cut and
all<00:00:46.489> and<00:00:47.489> finish<00:00:47.670> coming<00:00:48.120> out<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.329> nice<00:00:48.600> long

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
all and finish coming out the nice long

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.889 
all and finish coming out the nice long
ones<00:00:49.350> because<00:00:49.710> at<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:49.980> base<00:00:50.219> of<00:00:50.550> pine<00:00:51.149> you're

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
ones because at the base of pine you're

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.840 
ones because at the base of pine you're
going<00:00:52.079> to<00:00:52.170> need<00:00:52.320> some<00:00:52.500> nice<00:00:52.710> long<00:00:53.129> flavors

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
going to need some nice long flavors

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.209 
going to need some nice long flavors
here<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:54.930> if<00:00:55.110> it's<00:00:55.260> not<00:00:55.350> long<00:00:55.620> enough<00:00:55.860> you<00:00:56.160> can

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
here and if it's not long enough you can

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.459 
here and if it's not long enough you can
off-center<00:00:57.030> them<00:00:57.180> so<00:00:57.750> that<00:00:57.899> when<00:00:58.020> it<00:00:58.140> spins

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
off-center them so that when it spins

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.580 
off-center them so that when it spins
you<00:00:58.800> get<00:00:58.980> it<00:00:59.100> small<00:01:00.090> at<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.300> top<00:01:00.480> wiping<00:01:01.440> out

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
you get it small at the top wiping out

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:08.420 
you get it small at the top wiping out
all<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.859> way<00:01:06.710> right<00:01:07.710> down<00:01:07.890> to<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.070> bottom<00:01:08.369> of

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
all the way right down to the bottom of

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:19.800 
all the way right down to the bottom of
the<00:01:08.580> trunk<00:01:08.820> from<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.360> end

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:19.810 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.149 

then<00:01:20.710> chop<00:01:21.430> the<00:01:21.640> top<00:01:21.790> off<00:01:22.000> there<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:23.770> then<00:01:23.829> I'm

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:24.159 
then chop the top off there and then I'm

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:27.480 
then chop the top off there and then I'm
going<00:01:24.369> to<00:01:24.460> take<00:01:24.729> some<00:01:25.270> glue<00:01:25.509> and<00:01:26.070> wind<00:01:27.070> out<00:01:27.280> the

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 
going to take some glue and wind out the

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.050 
going to take some glue and wind out the
point<00:01:27.880> like<00:01:28.240> that<00:01:28.600> and<00:01:29.380> with<00:01:29.530> some<00:01:29.820> Elmer's<00:01:30.820> or

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.060 
point like that and with some Elmer's or

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.050 
point like that and with some Elmer's or
PVA<00:01:31.630> glue<00:01:31.750> or<00:01:32.740> a<00:01:32.829> block<00:01:33.100> glue<00:01:33.399> on<00:01:33.549> there<00:01:33.880> and

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060 
PVA glue or a block glue on there and

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.410 
PVA glue or a block glue on there and
I'm<00:01:34.299> going<00:01:34.329> to<00:01:34.780> twirl<00:01:35.200> around<00:01:36.149> so<00:01:37.149> that<00:01:37.330> I'm

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
I'm going to twirl around so that I'm

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.410 
I'm going to twirl around so that I'm
going<00:01:37.659> to<00:01:37.780> in<00:01:37.990> a<00:01:38.200> nice<00:01:38.439> little<00:01:38.740> point<00:01:39.189> then<00:01:39.850> I'm

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420 
going to in a nice little point then I'm

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.870 
going to in a nice little point then I'm
going<00:01:40.750> to<00:01:40.810> trim<00:01:41.289> the<00:01:41.830> tree<00:01:41.979> with<00:01:42.340> the<00:01:42.490> scissors

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
going to trim the tree with the scissors

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:50.390 
going to trim the tree with the scissors
into<00:01:43.210> a<00:01:43.630> cone<00:01:44.590> shape

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:50.400

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:57.290 
and there's basis about my initiative
now<00:01:54.510> I'm<00:01:54.600> going<00:01:54.780> to<00:01:54.870> take<00:01:55.080> my<00:01:55.560> jar<00:01:55.950> of<00:01:56.300> 30

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:57.300 
now I'm going to take my jar of 30

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.350 
now I'm going to take my jar of 30
percent<00:01:57.620> PVA<00:01:58.620> polyvinyl<00:01:58.890> acetate<00:01:59.730> glue<00:02:00.060> or

Elmer's glue and 50 percent water and my
tree<00:02:03.360> I'm<00:02:03.660> going<00:02:03.960> to<00:02:04.110> dunk<00:02:04.290> it<00:02:04.440> in<00:02:04.530> now<00:02:04.680> as<00:02:04.740> per

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.010 
tree I'm going to dunk it in now as per

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:08.600 
tree I'm going to dunk it in now as per
usual<00:02:05.330> now<00:02:06.330> if<00:02:06.510> you<00:02:06.660> find<00:02:06.990> that<00:02:07.170> you<00:02:07.890> haven't

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
usual now if you find that you haven't

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:09.889 
usual now if you find that you haven't
got<00:02:08.700> enough<00:02:08.880> glue<00:02:09.090> because<00:02:09.330> after<00:02:09.780> you've

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
got enough glue because after you've

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.660 
got enough glue because after you've
done<00:02:10.080> a<00:02:10.290> number<00:02:10.560> of<00:02:10.830> trees

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
done a number of trees

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.390 
done a number of trees
it<00:02:12.570> gets<00:02:12.930> the<00:02:13.200> level<00:02:13.500> bits<00:02:13.650> down<00:02:13.920> you<00:02:14.100> can<00:02:14.250> dunk

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
it gets the level bits down you can dunk

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.800 
it gets the level bits down you can dunk
it<00:02:14.550> in<00:02:14.670> and<00:02:14.820> then<00:02:14.940> you<00:02:15.090> can<00:02:15.270> get<00:02:15.390> your<00:02:15.600> brush

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
it in and then you can get your brush

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.080 
it in and then you can get your brush
and<00:02:16.110> then<00:02:16.380> to<00:02:16.500> the<00:02:16.590> painting<00:02:17.040> the<00:02:17.700> rest<00:02:17.850> of<00:02:18.030> the

and then to the painting the rest of the
while<00:02:18.300> is<00:02:18.450> dripping<00:02:18.990> off<00:02:19.290> and<00:02:20.070> at<00:02:20.190> the<00:02:20.280> same

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
while is dripping off and at the same

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:24.110 
while is dripping off and at the same
time<00:02:20.790> as<00:02:21.000> it's<00:02:21.150> dripping<00:02:22.220> you<00:02:23.220> can<00:02:23.460> then<00:02:23.670> go

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
time as it's dripping you can then go

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.590 
time as it's dripping you can then go
around<00:02:24.240> composing<00:02:25.050> your<00:02:25.260> branches<00:02:26.480> so<00:02:27.480> that

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
around composing your branches so that

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.150 
around composing your branches so that
by<00:02:27.690> the<00:02:27.720> time<00:02:28.050> you've<00:02:28.200> got<00:02:28.230> it<00:02:28.530> more<00:02:29.010> or<00:02:29.100> less

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
by the time you've got it more or less

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:34.610 
by the time you've got it more or less
composed<00:02:29.820> it's<00:02:30.210> stopped<00:02:30.570> dripping<00:02:32.810> then<00:02:33.810> I'm

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
composed it's stopped dripping then I'm

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.100 
composed it's stopped dripping then I'm
going<00:02:34.860> to<00:02:34.980> take<00:02:35.250> some<00:02:36.290> reasonably<00:02:37.290> dark

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
going to take some reasonably dark

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:44.380 
going to take some reasonably dark
sawdust<00:02:40.520> in<00:02:41.520> sawdust<00:02:42.090> and<00:02:42.510> start<00:02:42.810> spilling<00:02:43.110> it

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
sawdust in sawdust and start spilling it

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:46.850 
sawdust in sawdust and start spilling it
right<00:02:45.390> into<00:02:45.600> the<00:02:45.840> center<00:02:46.170> of<00:02:46.230> the<00:02:46.380> tree<00:02:46.560> is

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
right into the center of the tree is

00:02:46.860 --> 00:03:02.190 
right into the center of the tree is
important<00:02:47.430> so<00:02:47.550> you<00:02:47.700> get<00:02:47.850> right<00:02:48.240> inside

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.680 

sprinkle<00:03:03.200> along<00:03:03.409> with<00:03:03.560> your<00:03:03.709> things<00:03:03.890> as<00:03:04.220> well

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
sprinkle along with your things as well

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:09.220 
sprinkle along with your things as well
from<00:03:05.690> the<00:03:05.870> top<00:03:06.080> from<00:03:06.409> the<00:03:06.440> bottom<00:03:06.909> over

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
from the top from the bottom over

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.850 
from the top from the bottom over
it<00:03:09.860> nicely<00:03:10.400> covered<00:03:10.610> there<00:03:11.150> is<00:03:11.650> facing<00:03:12.650> tree

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
it nicely covered there is facing tree

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.180 
it nicely covered there is facing tree
and<00:03:13.760> then<00:03:13.879> you<00:03:14.000> can<00:03:14.150> set<00:03:14.360> it<00:03:14.480> aside<00:03:14.739> to<00:03:15.739> dry<00:03:15.890> and

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
and then you can set it aside to dry and

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:17.830 
and then you can set it aside to dry and
then<00:03:16.370> once<00:03:16.670> you've<00:03:16.819> let<00:03:17.060> it<00:03:17.090> dry<00:03:17.420> this<00:03:17.750> is

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
then once you've let it dry this is

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.530 
then once you've let it dry this is
another<00:03:18.050> one<00:03:18.290> that's<00:03:18.440> dried<00:03:18.940> a<00:03:19.940> pine<00:03:20.510> tree

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
another one that's dried a pine tree

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.170 
another one that's dried a pine tree
usually<00:03:21.170> has<00:03:21.530> those<00:03:21.920> lighter<00:03:22.489> slightly

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
usually has those lighter slightly

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.870 
usually has those lighter slightly
lighter<00:03:23.420> colored<00:03:23.900> branches<00:03:24.739> and<00:03:24.920> so<00:03:25.129> I've<00:03:25.640> got

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
lighter colored branches and so I've got

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.460 
lighter colored branches and so I've got
one<00:03:26.120> that's<00:03:26.300> slightly<00:03:26.450> lighter<00:03:26.930> or<00:03:27.230> maybe

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
one that's slightly lighter or maybe

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:32.949 
one that's slightly lighter or maybe
this<00:03:28.340> lightning<00:03:29.209> here<00:03:29.599> and<00:03:30.730> then<00:03:31.930> dab<00:03:32.930> some

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959 
this lightning here and then dab some

glue<00:03:33.290> on<00:03:33.560> those<00:03:34.330> tips<00:03:35.330> that's<00:03:36.110> particularly

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
glue on those tips that's particularly

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:38.440 
glue on those tips that's particularly
on<00:03:36.860> the<00:03:36.950> outside<00:03:37.400> edges<00:03:37.610> so<00:03:37.940> that<00:03:37.970> it<00:03:38.180> looks

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.450 
on the outside edges so that it looks

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:40.240 
on the outside edges so that it looks
like<00:03:38.569> you've<00:03:38.930> got<00:03:39.080> new<00:03:39.379> growth<00:03:39.650> on<00:03:39.890> the<00:03:40.010> tips

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
like you've got new growth on the tips

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:44.140 
like you've got new growth on the tips
off<00:03:40.459> of<00:03:40.910> the<00:03:41.209> branches<00:03:41.750> and<00:03:42.400> then<00:03:43.400> once<00:03:43.910> that's

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
off of the branches and then once that's

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:50.949 
off of the branches and then once that's
all<00:03:44.440> there<00:03:45.440> we<00:03:45.739> can<00:03:49.540> Springfield<00:03:50.540> oh<00:03:50.630> there's

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959 
all there we can Springfield oh there's

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:55.530 
all there we can Springfield oh there's
a<00:03:51.049> little<00:03:51.319> bit<00:03:53.170> blobs<00:03:54.170> at<00:03:54.440> the<00:03:54.590> long<00:03:54.739> tips

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
a little bit blobs at the long tips

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.720 
a little bit blobs at the long tips
shake<00:03:56.540> it<00:03:56.690> out<00:03:56.840> and<00:03:57.500> you'll<00:03:58.160> see<00:03:58.370> that<00:03:58.519> your

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.730 
shake it out and you'll see that your

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:04.140 
shake it out and you'll see that your
tree<00:03:59.000> is<00:03:59.299> a<00:04:00.049> lot<00:04:01.040> more

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.809 

also<00:04:04.840> you<00:04:04.900> might<00:04:05.230> want<00:04:05.470> to<00:04:05.530> vary<00:04:05.980> the<00:04:06.099> color<00:04:06.670> of

00:04:06.809 --> 00:04:06.819 
also you might want to vary the color of

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:08.430 
also you might want to vary the color of
your<00:04:06.940> trees<00:04:07.180> some<00:04:07.450> slightly<00:04:07.750> dark<00:04:08.110> some

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:08.440 
your trees some slightly dark some

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.650 
your trees some slightly dark some
slightly<00:04:08.860> greener<00:04:09.250> so<00:04:09.610> that<00:04:09.819> in<00:04:10.060> a<00:04:10.269> normal

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:10.660 
slightly greener so that in a normal

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:12.619 
slightly greener so that in a normal
forest<00:04:10.900> trees<00:04:11.800> are<00:04:12.010> usually<00:04:12.129> like<00:04:12.430> people

00:04:12.619 --> 00:04:12.629 
forest trees are usually like people

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:16.500 
forest trees are usually like people
they<00:04:14.040> look<00:04:15.040> the<00:04:15.220> same<00:04:15.250> initially<00:04:16.030> like<00:04:16.209> China

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:16.510 
they look the same initially like China

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:18.569 
they look the same initially like China
and<00:04:16.630> all<00:04:16.810> China<00:04:17.079> and<00:04:17.260> look<00:04:17.380> the<00:04:17.530> same<00:04:17.739> but

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:18.579 
and all China and look the same but

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:20.789 
and all China and look the same but
every<00:04:19.030> single<00:04:19.419> one<00:04:19.540> as<00:04:19.690> individuals<00:04:20.320> some<00:04:20.650> are

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:20.799 
every single one as individuals some are

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:22.400 
every single one as individuals some are
slightly<00:04:21.130> stronger<00:04:21.459> than<00:04:21.729> others<00:04:22.000> some<00:04:22.210> are

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:22.410 
slightly stronger than others some are

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.040 
slightly stronger than others some are
shorter<00:04:23.410> taller<00:04:23.680> summer<00:04:24.490> and<00:04:25.330> the<00:04:25.600> simple

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050 
shorter taller summer and the simple

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:28.500 
shorter taller summer and the simple
summer<00:04:26.350> are<00:04:26.770> healthy<00:04:27.220> so<00:04:27.400> give<00:04:27.970> you<00:04:28.060> trees<00:04:28.300> a

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:28.510 
summer are healthy so give you trees a

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:30.629 
summer are healthy so give you trees a
slight<00:04:28.870> variation<00:04:29.740> each<00:04:29.889> one<00:04:30.130> there's<00:04:30.550> a

00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:30.639 
slight variation each one there's a

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:32.219 
slight variation each one there's a

00:04:32.219 --> 00:04:32.229 
certain amount of randomness to it so

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:36.900 
certain amount of randomness to it so
you<00:04:32.530> get<00:04:33.240> natural<00:04:34.240> looking<00:04:34.660> for
