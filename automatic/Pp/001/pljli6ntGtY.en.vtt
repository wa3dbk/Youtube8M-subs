00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.470 
okay here's talk to you later great song
from<00:00:02.820> the<00:00:02.970> tubes<00:00:03.240> in<00:00:03.510> the<00:00:03.600> 80s<00:00:04.940> written<00:00:05.940> in

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
from the tubes in the 80s written in

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.900 
from the tubes in the 80s written in
part<00:00:06.839> by<00:00:06.990> Steve<00:00:07.410> Lukather<00:00:07.770> who<00:00:08.099> played<00:00:08.370> a<00:00:08.400> lot

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
part by Steve Lukather who played a lot

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.310 
part by Steve Lukather who played a lot
of<00:00:08.940> the<00:00:09.059> guitar<00:00:09.360> parts<00:00:09.690> and<00:00:09.840> I<00:00:09.900> believe<00:00:10.170> the

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
of the guitar parts and I believe the

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.980 
of the guitar parts and I believe the
bass<00:00:10.500> part<00:00:10.800> so<00:00:11.099> that<00:00:11.700> will<00:00:11.940> explain<00:00:12.420> a<00:00:12.480> lot<00:00:12.870> of

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
bass part so that will explain a lot of

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.430 
bass part so that will explain a lot of
the<00:00:13.110> oddness<00:00:13.830> and<00:00:14.730> you<00:00:15.269> know<00:00:15.389> some<00:00:15.690> complexity

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
the oddness and you know some complexity

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.830 
the oddness and you know some complexity
in<00:00:16.560> it<00:00:16.710> anyway<00:00:17.400> let's<00:00:17.850> get<00:00:18.090> started<00:00:18.630> there

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
in it anyway let's get started there

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:26.750 
in it anyway let's get started there
that<00:00:19.260> opening<00:00:19.830> lick<00:00:20.100> is<00:00:25.369> really<00:00:26.369> important

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
that opening lick is really important

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.290 
that opening lick is really important
that<00:00:26.789> that<00:00:27.000> open<00:00:27.359> E<00:00:27.539> string<00:00:28.429> rings<00:00:29.429> out<00:00:29.699> with

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
that that open E string rings out with

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.540 
that that open E string rings out with
every<00:00:30.599> chord<00:00:30.900> and<00:00:31.140> also<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:31.769> right<00:00:31.980> hand<00:00:32.250> palm

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
every chord and also the right hand palm

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.660 
every chord and also the right hand palm
muting<00:00:32.969> is<00:00:33.120> really<00:00:33.570> important<00:00:34.020> because<00:00:34.140> it's

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:37.670 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.770 

otherwise<00:00:38.670> is<00:00:40.640> and<00:00:41.640> that's<00:00:42.059> just<00:00:42.270> a<00:00:42.360> mess

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
otherwise is and that's just a mess

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.450 
otherwise is and that's just a mess
so<00:00:42.989> you<00:00:43.350> know<00:00:43.440> take<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:43.890> time<00:00:44.100> to<00:00:44.250> get<00:00:44.340> the

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
so you know take the time to get the

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.299 
so you know take the time to get the
poem<00:00:44.670> right<00:00:44.940> palm<00:00:45.450> muting<00:00:45.870> right<00:00:48.350> okay<00:00:49.350> you<00:00:50.160> go

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
and then there's an octave in there at

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:21.530 
and then there's an octave in there at
the<00:01:03.239> end<00:01:05.750> okay<00:01:06.750> so<00:01:17.990> basically<00:01:18.990> like<00:01:19.409> that<00:01:20.540> okay

branch<00:01:31.650> I<00:01:31.920> me<00:01:31.979> they're<00:01:32.220> not<00:01:32.369> poem<00:01:32.759> yet<00:01:33.030> and

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
branch I me they're not poem yet and

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.880 
branch I me they're not poem yet and
they<00:01:33.299> sound<00:01:33.540> even<00:01:33.900> a<00:01:34.229> little<00:01:34.530> bit<00:01:34.740> like

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
they sound even a little bit like

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.890 
they sound even a little bit like
they're<00:01:35.070> influenced<00:01:35.759> by<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:35.909> birds<00:01:36.329> so<00:01:36.810> you

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
they're influenced by the birds so you

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.969 
they're influenced by the birds so you
got

but is probably a C sharp minor 7 with a
G<00:01:56.270> sharp<00:01:56.300> base<00:01:59.380> and<00:02:00.380> then<00:02:00.500> back<00:02:01.070> to<00:02:01.220> that<00:02:01.370> a<00:02:01.550> sus

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:01.910 
G sharp base and then back to that a sus

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:04.180 
G sharp base and then back to that a sus

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
poem unit so it's got it sort of sounds

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.399 
poem unit so it's got it sort of sounds
like<00:03:30.319> the<00:03:30.590> opening<00:03:30.980> to<00:03:31.190> bang<00:03:32.000> a<00:03:32.150> gong<00:03:32.359> yes<00:03:32.989> it

00:03:33.399 --> 00:03:33.409 
like the opening to bang a gong yes it

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:35.920 
like the opening to bang a gong yes it
just<00:03:33.440> reminded<00:03:34.310> me<00:03:34.400> there<00:03:34.519> the<00:03:35.389> second<00:03:35.780> half

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
just reminded me there the second half

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.809 
just reminded me there the second half
is<00:03:36.079> in<00:03:36.109> the<00:03:36.260> a<00:03:36.379> in<00:03:36.799> a<00:03:37.040> soup<00:03:39.459> just<00:03:40.459> pretty<00:03:40.700> much

00:03:40.809 --> 00:03:40.819 
is in the a in a soup just pretty much

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:42.809 
is in the a in a soup just pretty much
an<00:03:41.060> analogue<00:03:41.810> of<00:03:41.840> the<00:03:42.019> first<00:03:42.319> half<00:03:42.560> of<00:03:42.680> the<00:03:42.769> e

00:03:42.809 --> 00:03:42.819 
an analogue of the first half of the e

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:57.040 
an analogue of the first half of the e
and<00:03:43.819> then<00:03:47.500> so

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:57.050 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:02.390 

and<00:03:58.220> then<00:03:59.220> you've<00:03:59.370> got<00:03:59.580> a<00:03:59.750> c-sharp<00:04:01.400> probably

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
and then you've got a c-sharp probably

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:07.160 
and then you've got a c-sharp probably
five<00:04:04.910> yeah<00:04:05.910> definitely<00:04:06.450> five<00:04:06.690> because<00:04:07.020> of

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
five yeah definitely five because of

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:10.730 
five yeah definitely five because of
that<00:04:07.350> major<00:04:07.740> rings<00:04:08.130> out

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:10.740 

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:13.580 

it<00:04:11.190> could<00:04:11.400> be<00:04:11.550> a<00:04:11.580> C<00:04:11.940> sharp<00:04:11.970> major<00:04:12.570> but<00:04:12.870> I<00:04:12.900> would

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
it could be a C sharp major but I would

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:17.349 
it could be a C sharp major but I would
prefer<00:04:13.770> to<00:04:14.040> hear<00:04:14.160> it<00:04:14.250> as<00:04:14.340> a<00:04:14.370> c-sharp<00:04:14.940> five

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:17.359 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:33.309 

and<00:04:17.479> then<00:04:17.959> a<00:04:17.989> B<00:04:18.259> 5<00:04:18.620> so<00:04:30.759> it<00:04:31.759> said<00:04:32.030> four<00:04:32.180> etc<00:04:32.629> okay

00:04:33.309 --> 00:04:33.319 
and then a B 5 so it said four etc okay

00:04:33.319 --> 00:04:34.749 
and then a B 5 so it said four etc okay
at<00:04:33.409> the<00:04:33.530> end<00:04:33.560> of<00:04:33.949> the<00:04:34.039> course<00:04:34.280> there's<00:04:34.520> that

00:04:34.749 --> 00:04:34.759 
at the end of the course there's that

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:36.939 
at the end of the course there's that
nice<00:04:35.090> ascending<00:04:35.629> line<00:04:35.750> I'll<00:04:36.020> just<00:04:36.620> see<00:04:36.919> you

00:04:36.939 --> 00:04:36.949 
nice ascending line I'll just see you

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:40.809 
nice ascending line I'll just see you
around<00:04:37.509> and<00:04:38.530> I<00:04:39.530> have<00:04:39.680> listened<00:04:40.189> and<00:04:40.370> listened

00:04:40.809 --> 00:04:40.819 
around and I have listened and listened

00:04:40.819 --> 00:04:42.279 
around and I have listened and listened
and<00:04:40.969> listened<00:04:41.389> to<00:04:41.479> that<00:04:41.629> to<00:04:41.840> see<00:04:42.020> if<00:04:42.080> there's

00:04:42.279 --> 00:04:42.289 
and listened to that to see if there's

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:44.170 
and listened to that to see if there's
actually<00:04:42.650> a<00:04:42.710> chord<00:04:43.069> structure<00:04:43.699> in<00:04:43.789> there<00:04:43.969> and

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:44.180 
actually a chord structure in there and

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:46.629 
actually a chord structure in there and
I<00:04:44.360> can't<00:04:44.810> find<00:04:45.199> one<00:04:45.500> anything<00:04:45.979> that<00:04:46.099> I<00:04:46.159> add<00:04:46.400> in

00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:46.639 
I can't find one anything that I add in

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:49.240 
I can't find one anything that I add in
whether<00:04:46.909> it's<00:04:47.120> a<00:04:47.240> five<00:04:47.539> or<00:04:47.870> a<00:04:47.960> major<00:04:48.620> or<00:04:48.949> minor

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:49.250 
whether it's a five or a major or minor

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:53.559 
whether it's a five or a major or minor
just<00:04:50.030> seems<00:04:50.300> to<00:04:51.729> pretty<00:04:52.729> it<00:04:52.849> up<00:04:53.030> too<00:04:53.300> much<00:04:53.330> and

00:04:53.559 --> 00:04:53.569 
just seems to pretty it up too much and

00:04:53.569 --> 00:04:55.839 
just seems to pretty it up too much and
kind<00:04:54.289> of<00:04:54.319> get<00:04:54.500> in<00:04:54.620> the<00:04:54.710> way<00:04:54.740> of<00:04:55.250> that<00:04:55.430> neat

00:04:55.839 --> 00:04:55.849 
kind of get in the way of that neat

00:04:55.849 --> 00:05:01.909 
kind of get in the way of that neat
vocal<00:04:56.419> arrangement<00:04:56.990> so

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:01.919 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:03.830 

that's<00:05:02.430> what<00:05:02.729> I<00:05:02.759> believe<00:05:02.879> it<00:05:03.360> is<00:05:03.509> they're<00:05:03.810> just

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 
that's what I believe it is they're just

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:09.850 
that's what I believe it is they're just
single<00:05:04.500> notes<00:05:04.680> B<00:05:05.460> c-sharp<00:05:05.969> c-sharp<00:05:07.460> d-sharp

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:09.860 
single notes B c-sharp c-sharp d-sharp

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:16.100 
single notes B c-sharp c-sharp d-sharp
e5<00:05:12.949> make<00:05:13.949> it<00:05:14.099> a<00:05:14.159> real<00:05:14.370> nice<00:05:14.520> open<00:05:14.969> ringy<00:05:15.240> e5<00:05:15.870> to

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.110 
e5 make it a real nice open ringy e5 to

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:21.140 
e5 make it a real nice open ringy e5 to
go<00:05:16.199> along<00:05:16.439> with<00:05:16.469> that<00:05:16.740> great<00:05:17.009> vocal<00:05:17.849> chord

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:21.150 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:27.350 

so

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.360 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:31.589 

okay<00:05:28.360> so<00:05:29.259> far<00:05:29.500> we've<00:05:29.740> got<00:05:29.949> the<00:05:30.310> intro<00:05:31.270> the

00:05:31.589 --> 00:05:31.599 
okay so far we've got the intro the

00:05:31.599 --> 00:05:34.619 
okay so far we've got the intro the
verse<00:05:32.050> the<00:05:32.379> pre-chorus<00:05:32.860> the<00:05:33.190> chorus<00:05:33.639> and<00:05:33.849> now

00:05:34.619 --> 00:05:34.629 
verse the pre-chorus the chorus and now

00:05:34.629 --> 00:05:37.610 
verse the pre-chorus the chorus and now
for<00:05:34.930> that<00:05:35.080> really<00:05:35.770> strange<00:05:36.250> little

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:37.620 
for that really strange little

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:40.170 
for that really strange little
synthesizer<00:05:38.620> solo<00:05:39.039> section<00:05:39.610> that<00:05:39.789> sounds

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:40.180 
synthesizer solo section that sounds

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:42.119 
synthesizer solo section that sounds
like<00:05:40.330> a<00:05:40.389> Martian<00:05:40.900> attack<00:05:41.349> or<00:05:41.620> something<00:05:41.979> like

00:05:42.119 --> 00:05:42.129 
like a Martian attack or something like

00:05:42.129 --> 00:05:44.309 
like a Martian attack or something like
that<00:05:42.270> again<00:05:43.270> we're<00:05:43.479> going<00:05:43.629> back<00:05:43.720> to<00:05:43.990> the<00:05:44.110> palm

00:05:44.309 --> 00:05:44.319 
that again we're going back to the palm

00:05:44.319 --> 00:05:49.469 
that again we're going back to the palm
muting<00:05:44.740> on<00:05:44.860> the<00:05:44.949> right<00:05:45.159> hand<00:05:48.030> so<00:05:49.030> basically

00:05:49.469 --> 00:05:49.479 
muting on the right hand so basically

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:51.149 
muting on the right hand so basically
you're<00:05:49.750> on<00:05:49.900> the<00:05:50.080> fifth<00:05:50.650> and<00:05:50.830> the<00:05:50.919> fourth

00:05:51.149 --> 00:05:51.159 
you're on the fifth and the fourth

00:05:51.159 --> 00:05:57.379 
you're on the fifth and the fourth
strings<00:05:51.639> and<00:05:52.030> the<00:05:52.360> shapes<00:05:52.629> are<00:05:52.930> like<00:05:53.169> this

00:05:57.379 --> 00:05:57.389 

00:05:57.389 --> 00:06:05.370 

next<00:05:58.389> sequences<00:06:03.449> next<00:06:04.449> sequence<00:06:04.840> is<00:06:05.050> a<00:06:05.080> real

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:05.380 
next sequences next sequence is a real

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:08.370 
next sequences next sequence is a real
stretch<00:06:05.860> so<00:06:06.750> take<00:06:07.750> care<00:06:07.780> of<00:06:07.990> the<00:06:08.080> warm-up

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:08.380 
stretch so take care of the warm-up

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:15.089 
stretch so take care of the warm-up
before<00:06:08.530> you<00:06:08.770> do<00:06:08.919> this<00:06:12.930> and<00:06:13.930> then<00:06:14.800> the<00:06:14.919> last

00:06:15.089 --> 00:06:15.099 
before you do this and then the last

00:06:15.099 --> 00:06:20.450 
before you do this and then the last
sequences

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:20.460 

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:23.210 

so<00:06:21.140> unusual<00:06:22.140> thing<00:06:22.410> there<00:06:22.620> but<00:06:22.860> again<00:06:22.950> it's

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:23.220 
so unusual thing there but again it's
