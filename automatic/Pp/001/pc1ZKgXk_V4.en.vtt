 Hello everyone 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:12.330
 we are to turn 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:15.190
 our new dedicated series 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:18.910
 play well e 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:22.539
 today a game indeed perhaps a kind of 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:24.900
 game bike I took a look at 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:24.900
 title 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:32.080
 many will know dragon ball z budokai 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:37.000
 tenkaichi three between playstation 2 and per 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:39.960
 milk console the game initially 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.830
 born Japan that name of meteor meteorite 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.559
 entirely in Japanese 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:46.989
 then later routes in Europe with 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:49.480
 the name of blue the time the c3 however with 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:51.010
 the camouflaged company for some reason 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.280
 reason why the developers are 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:56.769
 assholes however deepened this 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.239
 Also in Europe there are not the version 

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:00.670
 voice in Italian but only 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:02.979
 subtitles then this regard a 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:06.280
 Italian guy had the brilliant 

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:08.740
 idea to change the game by putting the 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:11.290
 voices taken from the cardboard in Italian in 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:14.220
 play and see that the result appears 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:14.220
 fantastic 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.250

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.270

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:27.520
 I knew how you could see 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:30.340
 this was not a montage it really is 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:33.220
 the game that while we play we will hear 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.420
 the items in Italian taken from the cardboard a 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.039

 of the download but you will have to play 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:42.909
 need a modified playstation 2 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:46.020
 or the edge cards with the emulator 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:46.020
 because always on pc 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:56.250
 well now to give a more review 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.260
 thorough we go to talk about 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:04.860
 game modes for those in a 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:08.910
 hotel did not know the game story 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:10.770
 of the dragon in which we can all live 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.020
 the dragon ball z dragon ball stories 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.850
 gt and the first dragon ball saga and more 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:18.050
 an alternative saga for this 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.050
 will not be dubbed in Italian 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:31.840
 there will be three supreme battles 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:33.980
 sin mode of the dragon mission hundred and 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.230
 survival that the latter will be 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:39.260
 locked and we'll gradually unlock 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:41.840
 piano playing in supreme battle in 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:44.360
 dragon world tour instead we can 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.819
 participate in different tournaments to be able to 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:49.010
 win some money taking up too 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:53.090
 to earn a character or one 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:55.400
 history of the dragon we will have to choose the 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:59.000
 ways in which there will be available 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:00.980
 only tournament every hour every hour will be every 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.450
 now the tournament will change 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:07.730
 available and also the difficulty instead 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:10.459
 on free we could play together with 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.569
 but our friends in the tournament will not be able to 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:16.519
 earn money but we could too 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:18.590
 set difficulty level duel 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:20.810
 the classic mode after are choose 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.670
 our characters and fight a good one 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:24.799
 duel as we like we can like 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.480
 choose the settings if make the 

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:29.419
 computer-controlled character 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:32.919
 very strong or the world norevole 

00:03:29.419 --> 00:03:32.919
 time limit and the referee 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:44.370
 in evolution z we will be able to customize i 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:47.310
 our favorite characters by applying them 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:49.650
 of blue orange and purple earrings 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:52.680
 the blue ones are used to increase attack 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.910
 defense this robben here the oranges 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.920
 they serve to give him abilities 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:57.239
 special and purple ones to give him one 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.220
 fighting style depending on a 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:00.840
 another character for example on juan 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:03.660
 we can apply it if fighting 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:09.330
 in June we will be able to shop for items 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:11.970
 buy items or sell them in 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:15.180
 supreme training will be there instead 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:17.639
 the opportunity to learn new things in 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:20.220
 game that maderno and we do not know or to 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:23.450
 train us with a duel that will end 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:23.450
 only when we want it 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:29.280
 in the data center we can insert one 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:31.080
 password that will give birth to a 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.150
 character with a power 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:34.950
 absolutely amazing are the 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.340
 password for all the characters of the 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:38.400
 game 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:41.450
 for example if l entering the password 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:43.950
 of sel we will give birth to a new cell 

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:48.479
 incredibly powerful practically 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:50.250
 unbeatable we could also look at the 

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:52.940
 replay our battles well saved 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:52.940
 previous 

00:04:54.920 --> 00:05:00.020
 meteor mirrors were chosen for this 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:02.630
 work because a lot more fluidity 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:04.460
 enjoyable budokai leak c 3po texts 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:07.070
 have been brought into Italian 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:09.940
 via the europe version had kaiten 

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:09.940
 football 3 indeed 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:20.520
 I thought of Roberto Bel Piece 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:25.259
 in short, the greatest must be made 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:28.800
 congratulations to this guy who was 

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:30.569
 very good at modifying the game and 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:32.340
 enter the Italian entries taken from 

00:05:30.569 --> 00:05:37.680
 carton an experience to say the least 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:40.229
 fantastic boy has committed to 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:43.680
 fund since the project was successful outside 

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:45.419
 quite well but there are some births 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.919
 small details that should go 

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:49.340
 improved but you can't have everything 

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:49.340
 from life 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:56.370
 for example many characters will not speak 

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:59.280
 Italian is classic duel menu but in 

00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:02.190
 history of the dragon then it can sometimes 

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:07.220
 it happens that the voice is out of place but 

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:07.220
 never but to a small extent insignificant 

00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:14.699
 so this is dragon ball z spec weather 

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:16.440
 with dubbing in Italian it goes 

00:06:14.699 --> 00:06:17.610
 absolutely recommended to all 

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:20.659
 dragon ball lovers who gods 

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:20.659
 fighting game in general 

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:30.520
 you know the manager said very lucky
