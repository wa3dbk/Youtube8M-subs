00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.730
 hello, friends, I am bet, borrero, and today 

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:11.580
 I want to talk about the best 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:15.539
 applications to follow a storm or 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:19.170
 when there is a climate that is adverse the 

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:20.940
 more that I like for everyone is eggs 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.830
 all this is a matter of taste 

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:25.199
 maybe this one may have another application 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.490
 as it can be in weather channel or 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.349
 any other that is very good but 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.970
 I think this has several 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.340
 very important characteristics number 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.040
 one has multiplatform comes both 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.920
 for android also comes for iphone 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.990
 the 'ratings' are excellent and it is also 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.560
 very faithful and in my opinion very friendly to 

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:45.960
 When using them personally I 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.790
 like and it's a pretty application 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.890
 reliable so you can because one of 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:54.030
 my options also comes for android 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.860
 and it also comes for itunes or iphone is 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.530
 very fragile and I really like this 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:02.190
 application also for those who are 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:04.379
 a little more meteorologists who carry a 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.060
 meteorologist and would like to learn a 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.689
 little else is there a website called 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:13.140
 water sports is written like water spark 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:15.420
 and it allows you to have a lot of information with 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.490
 respect to precipitation to 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.729
 graphics so if you are a fanatic 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:23.369
 of this topic of meteorology know that 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.679
 it may be could be a good place 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.149
 for you to navigate and play with him about 

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:30.240
 what it has to do with 

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:32.539
 graphic precipitation and everything else 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.939
 so excellent you can back with 

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:38.039
 then another of the applications that 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.109
 competes strongly with weather box 

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:41.490
 called accuweather in fact there is no 

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:44.130
 problem in which you have both 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.850
 You can have them inside your android 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.329
 iphone 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.969
 here you can go to very nice like the 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:54.500
 interface I really like very easy to 

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:57.800
 use and there comes so much for 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:00.620
 android here we see it and it also comes 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.480
 for your iphone phone the other one that I 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:04.070
 I really like that I like website more 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:06.430
 flame weather underground also comes 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.300
 an application for weather underground 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.619
 western order ground one of the 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.740
 characteristics of weather underground 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:16.630
 is that it has many small stations 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:19.640
 around the whole country and they are pretty 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:22.820
 agreements are quite precise their 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.620
 forecasts and their information that is something 

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:26.810
 important that you should know is 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.739
 that in the case of Puerto Rico and 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.930
