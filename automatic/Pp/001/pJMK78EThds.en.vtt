starting from scratch I know you guys

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.500 
starting from scratch I know you guys
had<00:00:32.219> done<00:00:32.369> a<00:00:32.399> little<00:00:32.640> bit<00:00:32.850> with<00:00:33.059> her<00:00:33.210> but<00:00:33.390> we're

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
had done a little bit with her but we're

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.330 
had done a little bit with her but we're
just<00:00:33.540> kind<00:00:33.930> of<00:00:33.989> starting<00:00:34.440> from<00:00:34.620> scratch<00:00:34.890> with

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
just kind of starting from scratch with

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.209 
just kind of starting from scratch with
her<00:00:35.690> so<00:00:36.690> what<00:00:36.899> we're<00:00:37.050> going<00:00:37.140> to<00:00:37.230> do<00:00:37.440> is<00:00:37.860> start

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
her so what we're going to do is start

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.700 
her so what we're going to do is start
out<00:00:38.399> shaping<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.239> behavior<00:00:39.840> of<00:00:39.870> heel<00:00:40.379> and

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
out shaping the behavior of heel and

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:41.810 
out shaping the behavior of heel and
we're<00:00:40.800> not<00:00:40.920> going<00:00:41.040> to<00:00:41.100> use<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.430> word<00:00:41.579> heel

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
we're not going to use the word heel

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.850 
we're not going to use the word heel
we're<00:00:42.030> not<00:00:42.120> going<00:00:42.300> to<00:00:42.360> use<00:00:42.510> any<00:00:42.719> word<00:00:43.260> at<00:00:43.290> this

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
we're not going to use any word at this

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.639 
we're not going to use any word at this
point<00:00:44.840> we're<00:00:45.840> just<00:00:45.870> going<00:00:46.110> to<00:00:46.170> walk<00:00:46.379> back<00:00:46.620> and

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
point we're just going to walk back and

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.770 
point we're just going to walk back and
forth<00:00:46.860> and<00:00:47.250> really<00:00:47.670> basically<00:00:48.329> what<00:00:48.600> this

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
forth and really basically what this

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.139 
forth and really basically what this
boils<00:00:49.020> down<00:00:49.140> to<00:00:49.440> is<00:00:49.590> disallowing<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.550> dog<00:00:50.760> to

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
boils down to is disallowing the dog to

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.619 
boils down to is disallowing the dog to
lead<00:00:51.770> so<00:00:52.770> not<00:00:53.100> trying<00:00:53.399> to<00:00:53.489> get<00:00:53.610> it<00:00:53.760> not<00:00:53.940> to<00:00:54.210> just

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
lead so not trying to get it not to just

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.450 
lead so not trying to get it not to just
not<00:00:54.809> allowing<00:00:55.320> that<00:00:55.440> to<00:00:55.649> happen<00:00:55.680> just<00:00:56.280> by

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
not allowing that to happen just by

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.410 
not allowing that to happen just by
virtue<00:00:56.520> of<00:00:56.910> our<00:00:57.239> behavior<00:00:57.989> so<00:00:58.670> anyway<00:00:59.670> but

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
virtue of our behavior so anyway but

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.119 
virtue of our behavior so anyway but
other<00:01:00.600> than<00:01:00.690> that<00:01:00.840> Michael<00:01:01.320> she's<00:01:01.590> been<00:01:01.829> being
