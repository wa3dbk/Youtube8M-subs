00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.290 
well I'm gonna bring it back for
close-ups<00:00:59.350> so<00:00:59.440> our<00:00:59.530> a<00:00:59.680> section<00:00:59.890> is<00:01:00.309> basically

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:01.300 
close-ups so our a section is basically

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.289 
close-ups so our a section is basically
a<00:01:02.250> repeated<00:01:03.250> pattern<00:01:03.640> it's<00:01:03.790> that<00:01:03.970> thing<00:01:04.180> that

00:01:04.289 --> 00:01:04.299 
a repeated pattern it's that thing that

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:07.080 
a repeated pattern it's that thing that
the<00:01:04.420> hands<00:01:04.629> cross<00:01:04.870> over<00:01:05.229> so<00:01:05.680> that<00:01:06.430> happens<00:01:06.909> a

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090 
the hands cross over so that happens a

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:08.760 
the hands cross over so that happens a
couple<00:01:07.420> times<00:01:07.630> through<00:01:07.870> our<00:01:07.900> song<00:01:08.200> if<00:01:08.440> you<00:01:08.560> see

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:08.770 
couple times through our song if you see

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.120 
couple times through our song if you see
those<00:01:08.920> three<00:01:09.250> lines<00:01:09.430> we<00:01:10.180> saw<00:01:10.420> a<00:01:10.450> face<00:01:11.080> so<00:01:11.950> if

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.130 
those three lines we saw a face so if

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:13.649 
those three lines we saw a face so if
you<00:01:12.250> practice<00:01:12.729> with<00:01:12.760> those<00:01:13.090> then<00:01:13.450> you'll<00:01:13.570> have

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:13.659 
you practice with those then you'll have

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:15.630 
you practice with those then you'll have
a<00:01:13.720> really<00:01:13.930> good<00:01:14.140> shot<00:01:14.409> so<00:01:14.830> I<00:01:14.860> would<00:01:15.220> say<00:01:15.340> do<00:01:15.490> the

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:15.640 
a really good shot so I would say do the

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.539 
a really good shot so I would say do the
first<00:01:15.880> two<00:01:16.119> boxes<00:01:16.630> practice<00:01:17.260> those<00:01:17.549> practices

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:18.549 
first two boxes practice those practices

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:19.950 
first two boxes practice those practices
over<00:01:18.760> and<00:01:19.000> over<00:01:19.299> and<00:01:19.540> that<00:01:19.600> will<00:01:19.720> help<00:01:19.900> you

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.080 

so<00:01:30.470> let's<00:01:30.590> learn<00:01:30.710> that<00:01:30.950> our<00:01:31.220> hands<00:01:31.880> go<00:01:32.060> like

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
so let's learn that our hands go like

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.230 
so let's learn that our hands go like
this<00:01:32.390> and<00:01:33.040> then<00:01:34.040> they<00:01:34.160> go<00:01:34.310> back<00:01:34.520> there<00:01:35.000> when

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:35.240 
this and then they go back there when

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.600 
this and then they go back there when
they<00:01:35.360> go<00:01:35.480> there<00:01:35.630> next<00:01:35.830> this<00:01:36.830> is<00:01:36.890> the<00:01:37.130> same<00:01:37.460> as

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
they go there next this is the same as

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.800 
they go there next this is the same as
this<00:01:39.160> okay<00:01:40.160> once<00:01:40.970> you<00:01:41.090> get<00:01:41.210> there<00:01:41.390> your<00:01:41.540> hands

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
this okay once you get there your hands

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.750 
this okay once you get there your hands
stay<00:01:42.050> there<00:01:42.320> so<00:01:42.590> that's<00:01:42.770> kind<00:01:43.070> of<00:01:43.160> like<00:01:43.220> thumbs

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:43.760 
stay there so that's kind of like thumbs

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:49.990 
stay there so that's kind of like thumbs
on<00:01:43.940> G<00:01:44.210> is<00:01:44.480> where<00:01:44.690> it<00:01:44.780> is<00:01:44.900> so<00:01:45.320> we<00:01:45.470> go

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.390 

and<00:01:50.540> when<00:01:50.660> we<00:01:50.780> hit<00:01:50.840> the<00:01:50.990> thumbs<00:01:51.200> on<00:01:51.380> gbd4<00:01:52.040> went
