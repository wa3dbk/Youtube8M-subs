saying<00:00:21.660> you're<00:00:21.810> wrong<00:00:21.840> one<00:00:22.350> way<00:00:22.500> or<00:00:22.650> the<00:00:22.740> other

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
saying you're wrong one way or the other

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.550 
saying you're wrong one way or the other
but<00:00:23.460> personally<00:00:24.210> I've<00:00:24.720> always<00:00:24.930> felt<00:00:25.320> they're

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
but personally I've always felt they're

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.650 
but personally I've always felt they're
built<00:00:25.800> on<00:00:25.949> some<00:00:26.220> pretty<00:00:26.460> hollow<00:00:26.789> game<00:00:27.180> design

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
built on some pretty hollow game design

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.380 
built on some pretty hollow game design
I<00:00:27.900> mean<00:00:28.109> they<00:00:28.410> say<00:00:28.650> they're<00:00:28.890> based<00:00:29.130> on

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:29.390 
I mean they say they're based on

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.020 
I mean they say they're based on
complete<00:00:30.390> and<00:00:30.750> unmitigated<00:00:31.309> freedom<00:00:32.309> but<00:00:32.910> to

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
complete and unmitigated freedom but to

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.120 
complete and unmitigated freedom but to
me<00:00:33.210> a<00:00:33.480> lot<00:00:33.690> of<00:00:33.840> them<00:00:33.960> just<00:00:33.989> feel<00:00:34.469> loose<00:00:34.800> and

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
me a lot of them just feel loose and

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.979 
me a lot of them just feel loose and
unfocused<00:00:35.850> I<00:00:36.059> mean<00:00:36.329> even<00:00:36.660> when<00:00:36.809> they're<00:00:36.960> not

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
unfocused I mean even when they're not

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.590 
unfocused I mean even when they're not
they're<00:00:37.829> entirely<00:00:38.250> dependent<00:00:39.030> on<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.239> appeal

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
they're entirely dependent on the appeal

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.720 
they're entirely dependent on the appeal
of<00:00:39.750> your<00:00:39.780> surroundings<00:00:40.500> so<00:00:40.739> even<00:00:41.190> if<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.430> core

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.479 
of your surroundings so even if the core
design<00:00:41.940> is<00:00:42.360> good<00:00:42.629> if<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.590> game<00:00:43.829> world<00:00:44.070> isn't

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489

throw<00:01:59.690> them<00:01:59.960> at<00:02:00.110> my<00:02:00.229> enemies<00:02:00.740> but<00:02:00.950> the<00:02:01.100> game

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
throw them at my enemies but the game

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.389 
throw them at my enemies but the game
didn't<00:02:01.640> let<00:02:01.850> me<00:02:02.060> which<00:02:02.569> you<00:02:02.929> know<00:02:03.229> so<00:02:03.950> much<00:02:04.159> for

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:04.399 
didn't let me which you know so much for

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:07.899 
didn't let me which you know so much for
unmitigated<00:02:04.819> freedom<00:02:05.720> I<00:02:05.840> guess<00:02:06.050> and<00:02:06.920> at<00:02:07.640> that

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:07.909 
unmitigated freedom I guess and at that

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:10.660 
unmitigated freedom I guess and at that
point<00:02:08.300> I<00:02:08.600> just<00:02:08.720> I<00:02:09.229> kind<00:02:09.649> of<00:02:09.739> lost<00:02:09.950> it<00:02:10.280> so<00:02:10.640> I

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
point I just I kind of lost it so I

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.000 
point I just I kind of lost it so I
chased<00:02:11.030> the<00:02:11.239> peasant<00:02:11.720> wildly<00:02:12.290> with<00:02:12.470> my<00:02:12.650> sword

chased the peasant wildly with my sword

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.970 
chased the peasant wildly with my sword
I<00:02:13.250> stabbed<00:02:14.060> a<00:02:14.239> small<00:02:14.569> child<00:02:14.989> in<00:02:15.230> the<00:02:15.350> face<00:02:15.530> the

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
what to do and that's because way of the

you know personally I'd rather play
games<00:02:30.799> that<00:02:31.040> don't<00:02:31.280> take<00:02:31.519> most<00:02:31.790> of<00:02:31.970> my<00:02:32.060> day<00:02:32.120> to

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:32.329 
games that don't take most of my day to

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:35.080 
games that don't take most of my day to
figure<00:02:32.630> out<00:02:32.840> how<00:02:32.989> to<00:02:33.049> play<00:02:33.400> you<00:02:34.400> could<00:02:34.610> call<00:02:34.910> me

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
figure out how to play you could call me

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.240 
figure out how to play you could call me
lazy<00:02:35.390> and<00:02:35.870> you<00:02:36.200> know<00:02:36.290> what<00:02:36.470> that's<00:02:36.799> a<00:02:37.010> valid

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
lazy and you know what that's a valid

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.850 
lazy and you know what that's a valid
point<00:02:37.670> but<00:02:37.880> really<00:02:38.299> this<00:02:38.840> game<00:02:39.200> is<00:02:39.260> the<00:02:39.620> lazy

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
point but really this game is the lazy

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.860 
point but really this game is the lazy
one<00:02:40.190> you<00:02:40.489> can't<00:02:40.730> get<00:02:40.880> away<00:02:41.000> with<00:02:41.090> being<00:02:41.480> vague

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
one you can't get away with being vague

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.140 
one you can't get away with being vague
and<00:02:42.170> poorly<00:02:42.680> structured<00:02:43.100> just<00:02:43.790> because<00:02:44.060> you

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
and poorly structured just because you

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:45.880 
and poorly structured just because you
happen<00:02:44.480> to<00:02:44.510> fall<00:02:44.750> under<00:02:44.989> the<00:02:45.170> open-world

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
happen to fall under the open-world

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.280 
happen to fall under the open-world
banner<00:02:46.340> that's<00:02:46.850> not<00:02:47.120> a<00:02:47.150> genre<00:02:47.269> in<00:02:47.840> that<00:02:47.989> case

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
banner that's not a genre in that case

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.380 
banner that's not a genre in that case
it's<00:02:48.500> an<00:02:48.620> excuse<00:02:49.040> for<00:02:49.250> poor<00:02:49.489> game<00:02:49.820> design

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
it's an excuse for poor game design

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.210 
it's an excuse for poor game design
oh<00:02:50.420> don't<00:02:51.170> worry<00:02:51.440> they'll<00:02:51.650> figure<00:02:51.950> out<00:02:52.070> what

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
oh don't worry they'll figure out what

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.250 
oh don't worry they'll figure out what
to<00:02:52.310> do<00:02:52.430> eventually<00:02:52.970> they'll<00:02:53.150> just<00:02:53.329> wander<00:02:54.109> all

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
to do eventually they'll just wander all

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.199 
to do eventually they'll just wander all
over<00:02:54.290> the<00:02:54.590> place<00:02:54.829> anyway<00:02:55.310> I<00:02:55.340> mean<00:02:55.640> it's<00:02:56.030> an

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
over the place anyway I mean it's an

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:59.050 
over the place anyway I mean it's an
open-world<00:02:56.870> game<00:02:57.350> right<00:02:57.739> yeah<00:02:58.340> it<00:02:58.609> is<00:02:58.760> and

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:01.489 
it's not a very good one either and

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:03.280 
it's not a very good one either and
what's<00:03:01.790> with<00:03:01.940> penalizing<00:03:02.630> me<00:03:02.870> for<00:03:03.200> the
