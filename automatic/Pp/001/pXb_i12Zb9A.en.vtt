00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:10.040
 hi everyone knows the hours 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:14.790
 today I want to show what the dk 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:17.340
 to these new patches especially frost 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.980
 because I did not play in foot neither sense 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:23.070
 because without it is not very useful in 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.930
 arena and more and worse these dogs play 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.970
 Finally, that's my personal taste 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:31.439
 so I'm showing you one thing that gives 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:34.499
 the shift live so already here is what 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.449
 it's the settings do not have too much 

00:00:34.499 --> 00:00:40.289
 changed to accommodate seven days of the 

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:46.319
 strength of the critical hit score the 

00:00:40.289 --> 00:00:49.739
 power liche jcj angels m next 

00:00:46.319 --> 00:00:53.850
 normal it always takes a bit of it 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:56.429
 can help and a little stamina for 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.859
 mount a few cases if you do not care 

00:00:56.429 --> 00:01:01.889
 not much compared to others 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:05.160
 adversaries then at the level of weapons that 

00:01:01.889 --> 00:01:06.990
 will be tomorrow especially no hambye 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:10.590
 because you have a lot less this 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:16.799
 season and 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:20.600
 dps level pretty decent this cycle 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:23.460
 birch that still has frost 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.869
 the idea of â€‹â€‹frost necessarily takes the same 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.959
 chronic and after a year this man and 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:33.450
 swear de jure I want to show that all 

00:01:27.959 --> 00:01:34.799
 immediately worry us so I you 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:39.950
 show what there is a little the cycle of 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.950
 burst once engaged 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:59.550
 you see separately white wii not 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:04.630
 too disappointing 200 dps gifts is not 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:06.700
 bad fang or to fall n the stuff 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:11.080
 where the good the goods stop but without 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:15.010
 many times it's really useful so 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:19.390
 to be a caught the dk frost it's not 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:21.370
 badly we do not pick up what to say to you 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:26.500
 above I advise you to watch a 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:30.370
 video and meaning to this patch the mom or cpe 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:32.610
 the site or this one has the good ones 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.610
 players
