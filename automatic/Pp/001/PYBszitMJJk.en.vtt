in<00:00:42.250> tennis<00:00:42.700> if<00:00:43.199> you<00:00:44.199> have<00:00:44.500> a<00:00:44.770> lot<00:00:44.980> of<00:00:45.129> tension

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:45.400 
in tennis if you have a lot of tension

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.799 
in tennis if you have a lot of tension
the<00:00:46.120> streambed

00:00:46.799 --> 00:00:46.809 
the streambed

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:49.560 
the streambed
is<00:00:47.050> extremely<00:00:47.800> tight<00:00:48.070> the<00:00:48.730> bow<00:00:48.879> is<00:00:49.090> not<00:00:49.120> able

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:49.570 
is extremely tight the bow is not able

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:54.090 
is extremely tight the bow is not able
to<00:00:49.870> move<00:00:50.800> the<00:00:51.040> string<00:00:51.900> absorb<00:00:52.900> energy<00:00:53.050> so<00:00:53.830> you

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:54.100 
to move the string absorb energy so you

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.399 
to move the string absorb energy so you
don't<00:00:54.460> have<00:00:54.610> power<00:00:54.970> so<00:00:55.600> if<00:00:55.750> you<00:00:55.930> want<00:00:56.170> power

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:56.409 
don't have power so if you want power

00:00:56.409 --> 00:00:58.950 
don't have power so if you want power
you<00:00:56.949> have<00:00:57.070> to<00:00:57.250> decrease<00:00:57.729> the<00:00:58.000> tension<00:00:58.390> to<00:00:58.720> less

00:00:58.950 --> 00:00:58.960 
you have to decrease the tension to less

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.140 
you have to decrease the tension to less
tension<00:00:59.350> then<00:01:00.309> you<00:01:00.430> have<00:01:00.580> another<00:01:00.790> problem

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:01.150 
tension then you have another problem

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:04.170 
tension then you have another problem
that's<00:01:01.780> no<00:01:02.470> more<00:01:02.650> control<00:01:03.190> because<00:01:03.820> the

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:04.180 
that's no more control because the

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.230 
that's no more control because the
trampoline<00:01:04.750> effect<00:01:04.870> is<00:01:05.290> too<00:01:05.620> fast<00:01:05.920> then<00:01:06.490> maybe

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.240 
trampoline effect is too fast then maybe

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.130 
trampoline effect is too fast then maybe
you're<00:01:07.540> not<00:01:07.720> good<00:01:08.680> enough<00:01:08.710> to<00:01:09.390> play<00:01:10.390> with<00:01:10.659> such

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.140 
you're not good enough to play with such

you're not good enough to play with such
