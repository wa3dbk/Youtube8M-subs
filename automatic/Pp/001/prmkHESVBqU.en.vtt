00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.289
 we are long reminded or writer and 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.289
 angel feet 

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:24.220
 here it is all numbers to you on a stone in this 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:30.950
 guys all hello today we have on 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:35.090
 the agenda 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:37.520
 phone review phone g4 elephone it 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.660
 Chinese manufacturer based not 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.090
 so long ago 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:44.450
 but, all the same gradually gaining 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:47.000
 momentum so this phone is 199 dollars 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:49.809
 for 99 dollars it is flattened 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.730
 very good phone apparatus this 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:54.879
 Available in very many colors specifically 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:58.059
 this green camera is 8 megapixels 

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:58.059
 LED flash 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.249
 I 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:18.640
 or 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:21.530
 screen 1280 by 720 go quite well 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:25.909
 responds to fingers on touch 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:31.100
 mtk 6582 processor 1 and 3 gigahertz 4 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:33.259
 kernels what else to say is worth saying 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.030
 what's gig operatives installed on 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:36.079
 this phone is 4geo slim 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.799
 flash drive 

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:43.159
 connector for two sim cards and sd card 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:45.429
 I mean flash so antutu by the way there are 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:48.079
 here it is pretty 

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:50.720
 fly regularly I don't know what it is 

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:54.349
 connected but sometimes recruit 18,000 to 45 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:57.649
 points is quite a good number for the phone 

00:01:54.349 --> 00:02:02.659
 again for 99 dollars so you can see 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:04.350
 no so what's on the list so 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:08.130
 it happens 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:10.770
 but here we see them asus zenfone 5 higher in 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.540
 principle again asus zenfone costs 130 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:16.080
 if I'm not mistaken for dollars 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:18.989
 good game outcome in principle 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.420
 most go but of course in gta san 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:25.680
 andreas you will not play but more than me 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:29.150
 other games you can play what else is worth 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:31.500
 say permission here is quite a 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:36.209
 color rendering is also good 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:37.050
 work speed is a good challenge by chance 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:41.880
 I started 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:44.480
 Well, the game is called the screen, but it's good 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:48.350
 on color rendition it is worth noting that 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:51.300
 the screen is very good that's it 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:54.500
 color rendition well the dynamics of it 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:03:09.660
 the phone is not very right now I will turn on the song 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:11.640
 listen here basically everything yes like this 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.590
 This phone is playing in principle for 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.620
 call squeals normally 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.870
 but the quality is certainly not enough 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.910
 again 99 dollars is quite normal 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:24.269
 front camera 1 and 3 megapixels 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:26.040
 worth noting for selfi norms for 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:30.930
 video calls but but not more than 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:33.220
 ok so geekbench then us by 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:36.730
 dials dial 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:42.750
 are the characteristics if someone does not believe and 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:46.060
 Well, I did not say that android 4 4 2 but 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:51.160
 one core dials 352 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:53.290
 All 1180 cores are basically good 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:55.750
 figure again for along the budget 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.280
 phone but here the characteristics should be 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:00.190
 who will be interested to stop and 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:03.910
 look but I think it is not so 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:06.160
 it will be interesting to watch you go 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:09.209
 next and next we look at the colors 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.209
 yet again 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:17.519
 the color rendition of this device is pretty 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:19.799
 at a high level since holy they 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:23.460
 they are probably even saturated 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:25.710
 compare by plane and samsung very 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:28.289
 cool colors i am the owner 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:30.810
 Nexus 5 and its color is not more than 

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:35.460
 natural but not so vigorous here 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:39.350
 they are not so much that it is not blind but 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:42.229
 nice to watch a very cool screen 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:43.889
 Again, the days for clarity and for 

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:46.740
 color rendering 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:49.770
 but of course the guys from 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:51.720
 phone that's all guys thanks for that 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:54.539
 watched my last words be 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:57.840
 such that the phone is 99 dollars 

00:04:54.539 --> 00:05:01.560
 definitely worth unequivocally if you 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:05.039
 want to take there will be a choice that you take 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:07.560
 know what to look at 

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:08.820
 thank you for seeing this 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:11.430
