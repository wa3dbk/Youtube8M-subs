hey<00:00:00.989> guys<00:00:01.230> I<00:00:01.589> want<00:00:02.310> to<00:00:02.429> just<00:00:03.030> cover<00:00:03.300> the<00:00:03.899> use<00:00:04.049> of

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200 
hey guys I want to just cover the use of

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.280 
hey guys I want to just cover the use of
two<00:00:04.410> tools<00:00:04.710> in<00:00:05.130> this<00:00:05.609> video<00:00:05.879> for<00:00:06.359> pub/sub

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
two tools in this video for pub/sub

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.110 
two tools in this video for pub/sub
diffing<00:00:07.710> files<00:00:10.219> the<00:00:11.219> two<00:00:11.670> tools<00:00:11.910> that<00:00:12.030> we

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
diffing files the two tools that we

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.839 
diffing files the two tools that we
cover<00:00:12.360> are<00:00:12.660> called<00:00:13.500> comparison<00:00:14.400> will<00:00:14.639> merge

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
cover are called comparison will merge

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.930 
cover are called comparison will merge
and<00:00:15.980> the<00:00:16.980> reason<00:00:17.190> I'm<00:00:17.279> going<00:00:17.460> to<00:00:17.550> cover<00:00:17.730> two<00:00:17.910> of

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
and the reason I'm going to cover two of

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.630 
and the reason I'm going to cover two of
them<00:00:18.180> is<00:00:18.270> because<00:00:18.920> compare<00:00:19.920> it<00:00:20.010> is<00:00:20.100> better<00:00:20.310> at

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
them is because compare it is better at

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.189 
them is because compare it is better at
comparing<00:00:21.710> single<00:00:22.710> files

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:24.199 
comparing single files

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:26.920 
comparing single files
whereas<00:00:25.199> when<00:00:25.380> merge<00:00:25.619> has<00:00:25.890> the<00:00:26.070> ability<00:00:26.430> to

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:26.930 
whereas when merge has the ability to

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:31.700 
whereas when merge has the ability to
compare<00:00:27.980> whole<00:00:28.980> folders<00:00:29.550> and<00:00:30.470> actually<00:00:31.470> DIF

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
compare whole folders and actually DIF

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.360 
compare whole folders and actually DIF
every<00:00:32.130> file<00:00:32.489> in<00:00:32.730> that<00:00:32.759> folder<00:00:33.079> against<00:00:34.370> its

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
every file in that folder against its

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.280 
every file in that folder against its
equivalent<00:00:35.969> file<00:00:36.329> in<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:36.899> opposite

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
equivalent file in the opposite

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.709 
equivalent file in the opposite
directory<00:00:38.210> which<00:00:39.210> is<00:00:39.239> a<00:00:39.390> very<00:00:39.600> useful

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
directory which is a very useful

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.810 
directory which is a very useful
function<00:00:41.480> so<00:00:43.010> also<00:00:44.010> one<00:00:44.370> difference<00:00:44.670> is<00:00:44.789> that

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
function so also one difference is that

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.790 
function so also one difference is that
compare<00:00:45.360> it<00:00:45.510> is<00:00:46.010> sort<00:00:47.010> of<00:00:47.039> like<00:00:47.989> you<00:00:48.989> can<00:00:49.649> use

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
compare it is sort of like you can use

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.889 
compare it is sort of like you can use
it<00:00:49.980> on<00:00:50.100> a<00:00:50.219> trial<00:00:50.640> basis<00:00:51.090> whereas<00:00:51.510> wind<00:00:51.719> merge

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
it on a trial basis whereas wind merge

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.660 
it on a trial basis whereas wind merge
is<00:00:52.170> free<00:00:53.160> program<00:00:54.230> so<00:00:55.230> basically<00:00:55.620> compare<00:00:56.520> it

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
is free program so basically compare it

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.270 
is free program so basically compare it
you<00:00:56.789> can<00:00:56.969> find<00:00:57.270> on<00:00:57.660> their<00:00:58.620> sites<00:00:58.890> and<00:00:59.070> just

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
you can find on their sites and just

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:05.710 
you can find on their sites and just
download<00:00:59.760> it<00:01:01.399> and<00:01:02.399> when<00:01:03.120> merge<00:01:03.329> is<00:01:03.809> available

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:05.720 
download it and when merge is available

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:11.929 
download it and when merge is available
through<00:01:06.720> SourceForge<00:01:10.159> so<00:01:11.159> first<00:01:11.580> have<00:01:11.760> a<00:01:11.820> look

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
through SourceForge so first have a look

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.340 
through SourceForge so first have a look

you<00:01:26.160> want<00:01:26.340> to<00:01:26.400> know<00:01:26.490> what<00:01:26.640> the<00:01:26.760> difference<00:01:27.030> was

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
you want to know what the difference was

you want to know what the difference was
between<00:01:27.210> two<00:01:28.110> revisions<00:01:28.410> to<00:01:29.220> see<00:01:29.400> what's

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
between two revisions to see what's

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.390 
between two revisions to see what's
changed<00:01:30.620> what<00:01:31.620> you<00:01:31.710> can<00:01:31.830> do<00:01:31.920> with<00:01:32.010> one<00:01:32.190> merge

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
changed what you can do with one merge

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.910 
changed what you can do with one merge
is<00:01:32.760> once<00:01:33.240> you've<00:01:33.420> installed<00:01:33.630> it<00:01:33.930> and<00:01:34.230> if

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
is once you've installed it and if

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.910 
is once you've installed it and if
you've<00:01:35.100> done<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:36.170> context<00:01:37.170> menu<00:01:37.290> integration

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
you've done the context menu integration

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.470 
you've done the context menu integration
you<00:01:38.160> can<00:01:38.190> right<00:01:38.460> click<00:01:38.490> a<00:01:38.700> folder<00:01:39.090> and<00:01:39.240> go

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:39.480 
you can right click a folder and go

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:43.940 
you can right click a folder and go
click<00:01:40.350> win<00:01:40.620> merge<00:01:40.830> and<00:01:42.470> what<00:01:43.470> this<00:01:43.590> does<00:01:43.830> is

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
click win merge and what this does is

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.670 
click win merge and what this does is
opens<00:01:44.370> up<00:01:44.490> a<00:01:44.580> little<00:01:44.640> window<00:01:45.380> asking<00:01:46.380> you<00:01:46.470> what

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
opens up a little window asking you what

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.440 
opens up a little window asking you what
the<00:01:47.420> two<00:01:48.420> folders<00:01:48.810> are<00:01:49.610> so<00:01:50.610> that<00:01:51.060> gives<00:01:51.300> you

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
the two folders are so that gives you

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.140 
the two folders are so that gives you
your<00:01:51.870> left<00:01:52.260> folder<00:01:52.710> and<00:01:52.950> then<00:01:53.580> you<00:01:53.729> can<00:01:53.910> click

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:54.150 
your left folder and then you can click

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.010 
your left folder and then you can click
and<00:01:54.300> drag<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.720> second<00:01:55.020> one<00:01:55.110> into<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.470> right

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
and drag the second one into the right

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.620 
and drag the second one into the right
slot<00:01:58.020> there<00:01:58.350> and<00:01:58.590> basically<00:01:59.490> click<00:02:00.420> include

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
slot there and basically click include

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.609 
slot there and basically click include
subfolders<00:02:02.000> to<00:02:03.000> check<00:02:03.630> the<00:02:03.810> entire<00:02:04.050> directory

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
subfolders to check the entire directory

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:10.960 
subfolders to check the entire directory
tree<00:02:05.690> and<00:02:06.690> what<00:02:06.869> it<00:02:06.960> does<00:02:07.110> is<00:02:07.259> goes<00:02:07.500> through<00:02:07.910> um

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.850 

folder<00:02:11.970> structure<00:02:12.360> and<00:02:12.510> basically<00:02:12.860> checks

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
folder structure and basically checks

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.050 
folder structure and basically checks
each<00:02:14.160> file<00:02:14.490> against<00:02:15.270> the<00:02:15.860> other<00:02:16.860> directory<00:02:17.430> to

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
each file against the other directory to

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.940 
each file against the other directory to
find<00:02:18.090> matches<00:02:19.250> and<00:02:20.250> what<00:02:20.370> you<00:02:20.459> can<00:02:20.580> do<00:02:20.730> here<00:02:21.030> is

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
find matches and what you can do here is

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.150 
find matches and what you can do here is
hide<00:02:22.950> the<00:02:23.220> identical<00:02:23.730> items<00:02:24.030> and<00:02:25.160> then

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
hide the identical items and then

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.900 
hide the identical items and then
basically<00:02:26.700> just<00:02:26.970> look<00:02:27.209> through<00:02:28.820> what<00:02:29.820> has

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
basically just look through what has

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.270 
basically just look through what has
changed<00:02:30.180> between<00:02:30.920> between<00:02:31.920> the<00:02:32.100> two

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
changed between between the two

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:41.199 
changed between between the two
revisions<00:02:33.800> so<00:02:37.850> the<00:02:38.850> what<00:02:39.570> I<00:02:39.600> did<00:02:39.810> there<00:02:39.989> was

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
revisions so the what I did there was

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:45.890 
revisions so the what I did there was
you<00:02:42.209> can<00:02:42.330> also<00:02:42.540> changed<00:02:43.970> into<00:02:44.970> a<00:02:45.000> tree<00:02:45.660> mode

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
you can also changed into a tree mode

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.610 
you can also changed into a tree mode
and<00:02:47.810> basically<00:02:48.810> this<00:02:49.019> gives<00:02:49.260> you<00:02:49.320> a<00:02:49.350> different

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
and basically this gives you a different

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.550 
and basically this gives you a different
view<00:02:49.860> of<00:02:49.920> the<00:02:50.040> thing<00:02:50.280> on<00:02:50.630> a<00:02:51.630> folder<00:02:52.320> structure

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
view of the thing on a folder structure

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.620 
view of the thing on a folder structure
level<00:02:52.799> and<00:02:53.190> in<00:02:53.940> this<00:02:54.030> case<00:02:54.239> that's<00:02:54.450> quite

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
level and in this case that's quite

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.780 
level and in this case that's quite
useful<00:02:54.810> because<00:02:55.350> all<00:02:55.500> my<00:02:55.650> source<00:02:55.890> code<00:02:55.980> was

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
useful because all my source code was

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.310 
useful because all my source code was
sitting<00:02:57.209> in<00:02:57.500> the<00:02:58.500> root<00:02:59.040> directory<00:02:59.870> so<00:03:00.870> in<00:03:01.170> this

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
sitting in the root directory so in this

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:02.960 
sitting in the root directory so in this
view<00:03:01.530> what<00:03:01.890> happens<00:03:02.250> is<00:03:02.430> you<00:03:02.760> can

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
view what happens is you can

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.090 
view what happens is you can
double-click<00:03:03.540> one<00:03:03.900> of<00:03:03.959> these<00:03:04.170> files<00:03:04.709> and

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
double-click one of these files and

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.430 
double-click one of these files and
tells<00:03:05.940> you<00:03:06.120> that<00:03:06.540> text<00:03:06.840> files<00:03:06.989> are<00:03:07.140> different

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
tells you that text files are different

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.699 
tells you that text files are different
and<00:03:07.799> it<00:03:08.610> will<00:03:08.820> that<00:03:09.630> take<00:03:09.840> to<00:03:10.110> the<00:03:10.200> diff<00:03:10.410> view

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:10.709 
and it will that take to the diff view

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:13.340 
and it will that take to the diff view
and<00:03:11.299> you<00:03:12.299> can<00:03:12.390> do<00:03:12.480> is<00:03:12.540> just<00:03:12.690> make<00:03:13.110> this

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
and you can do is just make this

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:17.060 
and you can do is just make this
location<00:03:14.340> pane<00:03:14.519> a<00:03:14.549> bit<00:03:14.790> smaller<00:03:15.060> and<00:03:16.070> this

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
location pane a bit smaller and this

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:19.310 
location pane a bit smaller and this
basically<00:03:17.489> as<00:03:17.880> you<00:03:18.450> scroll<00:03:18.750> through<00:03:18.810> you<00:03:19.170> can

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
basically as you scroll through you can

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.110 
basically as you scroll through you can
see<00:03:19.560> what<00:03:19.920> is<00:03:20.010> actually<00:03:20.310> changed<00:03:20.700> between<00:03:21.030> the

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
see what is actually changed between the

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.620 
see what is actually changed between the
two<00:03:21.269> files<00:03:21.739> so<00:03:22.739> some<00:03:23.310> default<00:03:24.000> values<00:03:24.360> were

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
two files so some default values were

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.760 
two files so some default values were
updated<00:03:25.230> here<00:03:25.500> during<00:03:26.040> nationalization

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:27.770 
updated here during nationalization

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:29.710 
updated here during nationalization
and<00:03:28.010> a<00:03:28.100> bunch<00:03:28.280> of<00:03:28.370> other<00:03:28.520> stuff<00:03:28.790> and<00:03:28.970> you<00:03:29.540> can

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
and a bunch of other stuff and you can

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.800 
and a bunch of other stuff and you can
also<00:03:29.930> use<00:03:30.200> this<00:03:30.470> legend<00:03:31.190> or<00:03:31.480> key<00:03:32.480> on<00:03:32.660> the<00:03:32.780> side

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
also use this legend or key on the side

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:36.190 
also use this legend or key on the side
to<00:03:33.290> basically<00:03:34.690> very<00:03:35.690> quickly<00:03:35.900> see<00:03:36.170> that

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 
to basically very quickly see that

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.080 
to basically very quickly see that
nothing<00:03:36.920> was<00:03:37.010> changed<00:03:37.400> in<00:03:37.520> all<00:03:37.670> this<00:03:37.820> code

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
nothing was changed in all this code

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:42.820 
nothing was changed in all this code
over<00:03:38.300> here<00:03:40.030> a<00:03:41.030> dove<00:03:41.930> tool<00:03:42.140> like<00:03:42.320> this<00:03:42.500> can<00:03:42.740> be

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:42.830 
over here a dove tool like this can be

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:46.410 
over here a dove tool like this can be
very<00:03:43.070> useful<00:03:43.130> if<00:03:43.670> a<00:03:44.330> bug<00:03:44.900> has<00:03:45.170> crept<00:03:45.500> in

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:46.420 
very useful if a bug has crept in

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:49.420 
very useful if a bug has crept in
between<00:03:47.420> two<00:03:47.600> revisions<00:03:47.870> and<00:03:48.320> you<00:03:49.130> need<00:03:49.280> to

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
between two revisions and you need to

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.880 
between two revisions and you need to
see<00:03:49.940> what<00:03:50.120> has<00:03:50.240> changed<00:03:50.270> between<00:03:50.720> them<00:03:51.050> to

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:51.890 
see what has changed between them to

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:54.640 
see what has changed between them to
kind<00:03:52.100> of<00:03:52.220> identify<00:03:52.570> where<00:03:53.570> things<00:03:54.500> have<00:03:54.620> gone

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:54.650 
kind of identify where things have gone

00:03:54.650 --> 00:04:02.950 
kind of identify where things have gone
wrong<00:04:00.220> now<00:04:01.220> what<00:04:01.670> I<00:04:01.700> don't<00:04:01.820> really<00:04:02.720> like<00:04:02.930> about

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:02.960 
wrong now what I don't really like about

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:09.790 
wrong now what I don't really like about
when<00:04:03.920> merge<00:04:04.160> is<00:04:04.490> the<00:04:06.490> sort<00:04:07.490> of<00:04:07.520> diff<00:04:07.790> markup<00:04:08.800> as

you<00:04:10.340> can<00:04:10.520> see<00:04:10.760> here<00:04:11.180> it's<00:04:12.020> done<00:04:12.200> a<00:04:12.260> fairly<00:04:12.620> good

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:12.710 
you can see here it's done a fairly good

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:15.160 
you can see here it's done a fairly good
job<00:04:12.920> of<00:04:13.370> detecting<00:04:13.970> that<00:04:14.360> everything's<00:04:15.110> the

job of detecting that everything's the

that<00:04:37.550> this<00:04:37.760> was<00:04:37.970> this<00:04:38.450> level<00:04:38.810> naught<00:04:39.020> was

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120 
that this was this level naught was

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:45.100 
that this was this level naught was
present<00:04:41.120> on<00:04:41.270> the<00:04:41.450> side<00:04:41.690> of<00:04:41.930> the<00:04:42.410> file<00:04:42.830> and<00:04:44.110> this

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:45.110 
present on the side of the file and this

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:49.180 
present on the side of the file and this
is<00:04:45.170> where<00:04:46.810> compared<00:04:47.810> it<00:04:47.960> comes<00:04:48.200> in<00:04:48.440> where<00:04:48.950> it's

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:49.190 
is where compared it comes in where it's

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:57.060 
is where compared it comes in where it's
actually<00:04:49.310> got<00:04:49.580> a<00:04:49.610> better<00:04:49.880> definition<00:04:54.400> so

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:57.070 
actually got a better definition so

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:01.720 
actually got a better definition so
tends<00:04:58.070> to<00:04:58.220> have<00:04:58.340> a<00:04:58.370> bit<00:04:58.700> of<00:04:58.810> difficulty<00:04:59.830> on<00:05:00.830> a

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:01.730 
tends to have a bit of difficulty on a

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:05.140 
tends to have a bit of difficulty on a
far<00:05:02.150> before<00:05:02.330> basis<00:05:03.400> so<00:05:04.400> in<00:05:04.580> this<00:05:04.670> case<00:05:04.910> we

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:05.150 
far before basis so in this case we

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:08.230 
far before basis so in this case we
would<00:05:05.240> define<00:05:05.600> level<00:05:06.410> dot<00:05:06.620> CPP<00:05:07.100> so<00:05:07.910> if<00:05:07.970> we<00:05:08.060> come

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:08.240 
would define level dot CPP so if we come

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.920 
would define level dot CPP so if we come
to<00:05:08.480> this<00:05:08.600> folder

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:10.930 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:16.529 

and<00:05:11.310> find<00:05:12.310> level.dat<00:05:12.850> CVP<00:05:15.030> we<00:05:16.030> can<00:05:16.210> then<00:05:16.360> open

00:05:16.529 --> 00:05:16.539 
and find level.dat CVP we can then open

00:05:16.539 --> 00:05:23.730 
and find level.dat CVP we can then open
compare<00:05:17.259> it<00:05:17.380> and<00:05:21.660> basically<00:05:22.660> drag<00:05:23.380> and<00:05:23.560> drop

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:23.740 
compare it and basically drag and drop

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:26.969 
compare it and basically drag and drop
this<00:05:23.949> file<00:05:24.250> in<00:05:24.490> there<00:05:25.650> go<00:05:26.650> to<00:05:26.710> the<00:05:26.860> other

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:26.979 
this file in there go to the other

00:05:26.979 --> 00:05:34.219 
this file in there go to the other
folder<00:05:27.400> find<00:05:28.270> the<00:05:28.419> same<00:05:28.600> thing

00:05:34.219 --> 00:05:34.229 

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:37.050 

drop<00:05:35.229> that<00:05:35.259> in<00:05:35.530> here<00:05:35.740> again<00:05:36.009> and<00:05:36.220> it<00:05:36.940> will

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:37.060 
drop that in here again and it will

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:40.409 
drop that in here again and it will
differ<00:05:37.740> and<00:05:38.740> you<00:05:39.070> can<00:05:39.220> check<00:05:39.430> first<00:05:40.150> of<00:05:40.300> all<00:05:40.389> I

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:40.419 
differ and you can check first of all I

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:45.570 
differ and you can check first of all I
prefer<00:05:41.020> this<00:05:41.080> hello<00:05:41.979> markup<00:05:42.460> and<00:05:43.440> secondly<00:05:44.580> it

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:45.580 
prefer this hello markup and secondly it

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:50.430 
prefer this hello markup and secondly it
is<00:05:45.789> very<00:05:46.180> good<00:05:47.110> about<00:05:47.759> detecting<00:05:49.020> like<00:05:50.020> quad

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:50.440 
is very good about detecting like quad

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:53.820 
is very good about detecting like quad
little<00:05:51.300> snippets<00:05:52.300> that<00:05:52.419> are<00:05:52.840> the<00:05:53.320> same<00:05:53.500> across

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:53.830 
little snippets that are the same across

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:56.550 
little snippets that are the same across
two<00:05:54.220> things<00:05:54.630> so<00:05:55.630> okay<00:05:55.930> it<00:05:56.020> made<00:05:56.199> a<00:05:56.229> slight

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:56.560 
two things so okay it made a slight

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.439 
two things so okay it made a slight
mistake<00:05:56.740> there<00:05:57.160> with<00:05:57.310> zebra<00:05:57.639> but<00:05:58.270> you'll

00:05:58.439 --> 00:05:58.449 
mistake there with zebra but you'll

00:05:58.449 --> 00:06:00.749 
mistake there with zebra but you'll
notice<00:05:58.840> that<00:05:59.110> there<00:05:59.830> was<00:05:59.919> another<00:06:00.160> zero<00:06:00.520> that

00:06:00.749 --> 00:06:00.759 
notice that there was another zero that

00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:05.100 
notice that there was another zero that
matched<00:06:01.030> it<00:06:01.240> too<00:06:01.830> so<00:06:03.270> while<00:06:04.270> it's<00:06:04.750> maybe

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:05.110 
matched it too so while it's maybe

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:07.890 
matched it too so while it's maybe
slightly<00:06:05.830> imperfect<00:06:06.160> it<00:06:06.820> makes<00:06:07.660> a<00:06:07.750> pretty

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:07.900 
slightly imperfect it makes a pretty

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:13.680 
slightly imperfect it makes a pretty
good<00:06:08.110> effort<00:06:10.979> and<00:06:11.979> otherwise<00:06:12.970> you<00:06:13.330> get<00:06:13.479> the

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:13.690 
good effort and otherwise you get the

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:16.200 
good effort and otherwise you get the
same<00:06:13.930> functionality<00:06:14.560> with<00:06:15.250> a<00:06:15.280> map<00:06:15.940> on<00:06:16.120> the

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:16.210 
same functionality with a map on the

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:19.490 
same functionality with a map on the
side<00:06:16.419> it's<00:06:16.900> in<00:06:17.080> fact<00:06:17.260> a<00:06:17.409> simplified<00:06:18.039> legend

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:19.500 
side it's in fact a simplified legend

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:23.189 
side it's in fact a simplified legend
which<00:06:20.500> is<00:06:20.650> perhaps<00:06:20.830> easier<00:06:21.580> to<00:06:21.880> read<00:06:22.199> being

00:06:23.189 --> 00:06:23.199 
which is perhaps easier to read being

00:06:23.199 --> 00:06:29.670 
which is perhaps easier to read being
only<00:06:23.470> one<00:06:23.830> bar<00:06:26.880> in<00:06:27.880> any<00:06:28.659> case<00:06:28.900> the<00:06:29.229> general

00:06:29.670 --> 00:06:29.680 
only one bar in any case the general

00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:32.010 
only one bar in any case the general
idea<00:06:30.130> between<00:06:30.310> the<00:06:30.580> two<00:06:30.760> file<00:06:31.030> or<00:06:31.300> two<00:06:31.659> tools

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:32.020 
idea between the two file or two tools

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:35.670 
idea between the two file or two tools
is<00:06:32.320> quite<00:06:33.280> similar<00:06:33.520> where<00:06:34.380> you<00:06:35.380> can<00:06:35.530> see

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:35.680 
is quite similar where you can see

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:37.710 
is quite similar where you can see
differences<00:06:36.400> and<00:06:36.550> basically<00:06:36.909> take<00:06:37.539> them

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:37.720 
differences and basically take them

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:42.800 
differences and basically take them
across<00:06:37.810> using<00:06:38.260> these<00:06:38.500> little<00:06:38.680> arrow<00:06:38.919> keys<00:06:39.280> and

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:42.810 

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:47.070 

you<00:06:43.810> can<00:06:43.840> use<00:06:44.500> f7<00:06:45.099> and<00:06:45.159> f8<00:06:45.699> to<00:06:46.210> navigate

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:47.080 
you can use f7 and f8 to navigate

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:50.969 
you can use f7 and f8 to navigate
between<00:06:47.199> the<00:06:49.409> difference<00:06:50.409> is<00:06:50.530> going<00:06:50.740> down

00:06:50.969 --> 00:06:50.979 
between the difference is going down

00:06:50.979 --> 00:06:54.089 
between the difference is going down
through<00:06:51.370> the<00:06:51.550> file<00:06:51.789> and<00:06:52.139> it's<00:06:53.139> stopping<00:06:53.860> at

00:06:54.089 --> 00:06:54.099 
through the file and it's stopping at

00:06:54.099 --> 00:06:56.210 
through the file and it's stopping at
every<00:06:54.190> difference<00:06:54.639> every<00:06:55.539> chunk<00:06:55.750> of

00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:56.220 
every difference every chunk of

00:06:56.220 --> 00:07:01.469 
every difference every chunk of
different<00:06:57.220> code<00:06:57.430> or<00:06:58.030> text<00:06:58.919> n<00:07:00.120> f7<00:07:01.120> does<00:07:01.389> the

different code or text n f7 does the

different code or text n f7 does the
opposite<00:07:01.750> and<00:07:01.810> goes<00:07:02.050> backwards

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:04.280 
opposite and goes backwards

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:08.170 
opposite and goes backwards
I<00:07:04.780> hope<00:07:05.780> that<00:07:05.990> explains<00:07:06.080> some<00:07:06.500> stuff<00:07:06.740> and<00:07:07.180> was

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:08.180 
I hope that explains some stuff and was

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:12.639 
I hope that explains some stuff and was
somewhat<00:07:09.139> useful<00:07:09.639> peace
