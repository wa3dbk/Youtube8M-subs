 Solitary Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 or shortly Happy EU the HD 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:12.369
 Lowest the 2 

00:00:12.369 --> 00:00:15.639
 the l release a film of the same name again 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:19.929
 in which the story of the former sorcerer's apprentice now ends this 

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:23.129
 Developer Studio Bright Light is like in the first part of the seventh part 

00:00:23.129 --> 00:00:25.449
 responsible for the game implementation 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:29.300
 potter fans can enjoy their favorite drink Rieger on almost all platforms 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.869
 chase through the enchanted world of Hogwarts 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:34.170
 But we urgently advise against it 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.000
 To put money into this rooting of the gross domestic product 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
 we explain in our test 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:42.720
 it is 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.980
 it's no surprise that the EU has the http-stroke the two started there 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:47.610
 in front 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.680
 the EU has stopped http // www 1 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:53.450
 The protests have recently been on 1 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:57.080
 Snap is Headmaster and Arielle Pipes and Hermione are looking for the remaining ones 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.170
 strongholds 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.510
 to put a stop to the dark lord Voldemort they furnish their search 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.350
 in the dungeons the sorcerer will shake there will be a Horcrux 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:07.140
 are located 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.460
 the goblet of Helga had AFP on the main page doctors they know that me 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.850
 not so firm with a warning money a reason in the Bundestag as a cloak 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.850
 Make it hold with a bit of luck in love with you 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.260
 it is 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:27.450
 underground were all trading house or more binding and so on 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:31.740
 The shortage of skilled workers is often a factor in the bank 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.150
 Henrique's studs and played on other characters from the 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:36.750
 Followers perspective 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.690
 The wand serves us as an all-purpose weapon 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.480
 Mr. enemies from the pines and Rene Stubbs in the form of a shield of 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.610
 Support spell is the default attack at the beginning in height Kotter and the 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.510
 Deathly Hallows Part 2 As the game progresses, the boy learns to do so as well 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:52.870
 Disarming spell Experian must 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:54.950
 the fast attack exposure 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.060
 or the powerful Converteam well clean the opponent fell to the ground 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.380
 a level system still in the HyperDoc and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.090
 There is no longer 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.700
 but there are still discoveries to lead 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.259
 A core element of the game is again shelling behind stones or witnesses 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.040
 looking for and hijacking around in Podersdorf out of the cover 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:17.259
 By the way, we are as James Underweight 

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:21.079
 The cover system is as messed up as already in the first part when gambling comes 

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:23.889
 quickly Frustration on the Henri once again can not take cover 

00:02:23.889 --> 00:02:27.659
 alone the superfluous companion blocked the way that is indeed 

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:29.709
 annoying but not necessarily tragic 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:33.599
 Dan Diker's enemies are all stupid like bread though the Death Eaters always dive in 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:36.709
 Crowds up and blow their spells around their ears looking for them 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:40.950
 but rarely cover and went to the floor after a few hits 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.249
 People think so 

00:02:42.249 --> 00:02:45.939
 even the boss bouts Lil Wayne put on the net or mediates lactose 

00:02:45.939 --> 00:02:50.129
 Run from cover looking for the same scheme Ballan IT comes to compete 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:51.659
 destroy foolish reeds 

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:52.919
 going on hiking 

00:02:52.919 --> 00:02:54.789
 go 

00:02:54.789 --> 00:02:58.009
 Kohl is that they also play other heroes from the potter universe 

00:02:58.009 --> 00:03:01.489
 can not care about it so the person comes in person 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:04.019
 the net will appear around the unloved new one 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:07.019
 Quicktime Events gets Apeda Geballer upwind 

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:11.579
 The short sneaking procedures are also nice but way too easy 

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:14.579
 We must not let ourselves be caught by the fire 

00:03:17.249 --> 00:03:19.689
 This is 

00:03:19.689 --> 00:03:23.270
 The artwork of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is Part 2 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:25.569
 which also the movie template pretty bleak 

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:29.709
 Brown usually mixes with gray hardly in black or brown and gray and 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:32.709
 Black, the weak lighting effects do not provide variety 

00:03:33.719 --> 00:03:37.249
 but the characters are very similar to those in the movie and also the 

00:03:37.249 --> 00:03:39.720
 Locales like Hopper back at the place of horror 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.640
 elicit tears from one Potter Nostalgic or another 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:47.460
 Group spokespersons ensure a fair form backdrop whether percent 

00:03:49.179 --> 00:03:50.899
 1 

00:03:50.899 --> 00:03:53.899
 at 

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:57.689
 important it is really serious he goes 

00:03:57.689 --> 00:03:58.859
 Dr 

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:01.859
 Ole with 

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:06.019
 when the eyes are seen 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:08.159
 in the poorer countries 

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:09.839
 Saarlouis 

00:04:09.839 --> 00:04:13.089
 quite well done, however, is the UBI play 

00:04:13.089 --> 00:04:15.900
 the graphics are pretty neat for Wi-Fi 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.959
 You can also see that in our graphic comparison here in the intro 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:21.609
 4 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:24.539
 we go 

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:26.900
 that killer whales handles or 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.800
 is a circle and here in a small chip while percent magic 

00:04:37.939 --> 00:04:40.529
 Club wanted this, however 

00:04:40.529 --> 00:04:43.029
 the control of the Uli is very precise 

00:04:43.029 --> 00:04:46.449
 with the wii-remote control, the Geballer makes much more fun than with the 

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:49.470
 Controller of the 3 60 or ps3 of course 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:52.710
 I own the game synonymous with the corresponding control rip off the 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:56.840
 works just as well as a Nintendo console 80 percent off that he does 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.139
 she magically sealed 

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:05.300
 it's Perry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 is a game she's playing 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:06.749
 nobody needs 

00:05:06.749 --> 00:05:08.470
 the technical defects in control 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:11.909
 Graphics and sounding frustrating fast 

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:15.580
 the messed cover system the lengthy battles and the sheer 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:18.999
 Making endless enemies also spares boredom 

00:05:18.999 --> 00:05:22.089
 No not even driving per day should be with acquisitions 

00:05:22.089 --> 00:05:24.370
 this very much Victor game of hands claps 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:27.570
 June merchandise to drive sales numbers up and out of the 

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:30.570
 Potter Universe also crush the last cases Force 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:34.300
 The film about the books offer much more for the money 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:36.070
 Finger away from the game
