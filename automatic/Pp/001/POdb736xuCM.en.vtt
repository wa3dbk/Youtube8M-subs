00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:14.149 
because it doesn't look that expensive
but<00:02:09.780> I<00:02:10.560> mean<00:02:11.489> it's<00:02:12.480> got<00:02:12.690> the<00:02:12.810> same<00:02:12.989> sort<00:02:13.409> of<00:02:13.440> the

00:02:14.149 --> 00:02:14.159 
but I mean it's got the same sort of the

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:16.460 
but I mean it's got the same sort of the
barcodes<00:02:14.700> on<00:02:14.879> the<00:02:15.000> side<00:02:15.209> of<00:02:15.239> the<00:02:15.390> eggs<00:02:15.569> so<00:02:16.140> I'm

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
barcodes on the side of the eggs so I'm

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.259 
barcodes on the side of the eggs so I'm
assuming<00:02:16.620> it<00:02:17.190> is<00:02:17.340> but<00:02:17.580> I<00:02:17.610> don't<00:02:17.909> know<00:02:18.030> for<00:02:18.060> sure

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:18.269 
assuming it is but I don't know for sure

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:20.479 
assuming it is but I don't know for sure
and<00:02:18.719> then<00:02:19.409> you<00:02:19.529> can<00:02:19.680> go<00:02:19.799> down<00:02:20.010> you<00:02:20.219> can<00:02:20.370> read

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
and then you can go down you can read

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:21.860 
and then you can go down you can read
some<00:02:20.700> fake<00:02:20.939> information<00:02:21.239> we've<00:02:21.599> got<00:02:21.689> a<00:02:21.719> nice

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
of cyber masrani some amber some of the

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:53.910 
of cyber masrani some amber some of the
eggs<00:02:51.700> now<00:02:52.150> the<00:02:52.209> eggs<00:02:52.420> in<00:02:52.660> this<00:02:52.810> picture<00:02:53.319> look

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
eggs now the eggs in this picture look

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.620 
eggs now the eggs in this picture look
completely<00:02:54.310> different<00:02:54.430> to<00:02:54.790> the<00:02:54.910> ones<00:02:55.120> in<00:02:55.360> the

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
completely different to the ones in the

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519 
picture on the engine profile page so

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:02.430 
picture on the engine profile page so
I'm<00:03:00.850> assuming<00:03:01.000> that<00:03:01.510> that<00:03:01.540> engine<00:03:02.019> profile

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
I'm assuming that that engine profile

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.500 
I'm assuming that that engine profile
page<00:03:02.680> is<00:03:02.860> just<00:03:03.070> like<00:03:03.250> you<00:03:04.209> know<00:03:04.330> something
