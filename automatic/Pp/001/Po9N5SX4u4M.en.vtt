00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:07.740
 Hello, the viewer sees from I am Dmitry 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.200
 Vorotyntsev I am a master of sports 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.570
 bodybuilding getting ready now in 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.199
 competition arnold classic today 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:22.500
 I'll show you your biceps shoulders workout 

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:23.779
 we go to the first exercise we do 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.240
 sitting on smith 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:30.449
 I usually perform bench press with a barbell 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.369
 loose weight but due to recent injury 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.610
 I had to refuse this 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:38.550
 exercise now i'm doing sitting on smith 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.570
 so that there is no axial load to my 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.570
 back did not hurt 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:01:01.280
 press sitting or press with ashtanga I perform 3 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:03.080
 Approaches on 14 10 repetitions work 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:06.110
 always if as you noticed in full 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:10.000
 I completely omit the amplitude completely 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:13.790
 I just squeeze out like this 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:17.000
 we did not it work better once their 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:19.400
 time i was not working at full amplitude but 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.860
 unfortunately it gave me nothing 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:26.210
 and I went exactly to that training 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:28.640
 which I am showing you now 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:31.280
 the main work of my training will be 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:35.380
 hammer muscles with blood will do 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.380
 reverse pyramid without rest 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.840
 and 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.220
 holidays 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:39.640
 my shoulders just blown final 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:41.010
 part of my training on the shoulders swing lying down 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.900
 to the back delta 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:47.940
 Why I chose precisely with dumbbells 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.940
 because i'm a supporter of free weights 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:26.280
 and now we go to the biceps first 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:29.250
 basic exercise as I said that 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.830
 I prefer the basic exercise first 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:36.570
 defeat will be lifting the barbell for biceps 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:41.580
 I alternate z-shaped bar with straight 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:43.640
 I mean 3 approaches from 10 to 15 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:43.640
 repetitions 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:20.230
 go to the second exercise the second 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:23.940
 exercise will be our supination on 

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:23.940
 dumbbell biceps 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:34.510
 we do the same three approaches and look there 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:37.530
 for each hand to go 15 

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:37.530
 radish repeats 

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:01.420
 and 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:27.620
 Now do the third exercise at the peak 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:32.199
 biceps on the channels did not see this 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:32.199
 exercises hope will bring this new 

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:05.789

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:21.409
 Naturally not one but under the direction of 

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:23.909
 Prokofiev's coach 

00:06:21.409 --> 00:06:26.699
 I expect in two years to become 

00:06:23.909 --> 00:06:29.159
 professional and naturally the most 

00:06:26.699 --> 00:06:33.830
 important goal I thought any bodybuilder 

00:06:29.159 --> 00:06:37.319

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:40.139
 become the best in the world 

00:06:37.319 --> 00:06:43.259
 I am sure that I will succeed because 

00:06:40.139 --> 00:06:46.379
 that i am purposeful think everything will be 

00:06:43.259 --> 00:06:48.990
 someone may not like somebody 

00:06:46.379 --> 00:06:50.849

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:52.649

 free weights someone to mail 

00:06:52.649 --> 00:06:58.020
