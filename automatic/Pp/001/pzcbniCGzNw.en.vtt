00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:06.610 
as long as you get the details right you

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:08.190 
as long as you get the details right you
can<00:01:06.760> walk<00:01:07.030> away<00:01:07.210> from<00:01:07.450> this<00:01:07.630> with<00:01:07.840> a<00:01:07.870> really

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.200 
can walk away from this with a really

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.010 
can walk away from this with a really
great<00:01:08.380> looking<00:01:08.770> costume<00:01:09.570> Marsten's<00:01:10.570> had<00:01:10.780> is

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020 
great looking costume Marsten's had is

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.570 
great looking costume Marsten's had is
probably<00:01:11.380> the<00:01:11.470> most<00:01:11.620> iconic<00:01:11.830> part<00:01:12.460> of<00:01:12.520> a

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:12.580 
probably the most iconic part of a

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:13.740 
probably the most iconic part of a
costume<00:01:13.000> it<00:01:13.120> looks<00:01:13.270> a<00:01:13.360> lot<00:01:13.479> like<00:01:13.600> an

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:13.750 
costume it looks a lot like an

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:15.719 
costume it looks a lot like an
Australian<00:01:14.140> outback<00:01:14.560> sort<00:01:15.159> of<00:01:15.220> cowboy<00:01:15.430> hat

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:15.729 
Australian outback sort of cowboy hat

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:18.210 
Australian outback sort of cowboy hat
sort<00:01:16.360> of<00:01:16.420> a<00:01:16.540> leather<00:01:16.930> style<00:01:17.290> hat<00:01:17.680> but<00:01:17.950> I<00:01:17.979> don't

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:18.220 
sort of a leather style hat but I don't

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:19.830 
sort of a leather style hat but I don't
think<00:01:18.430> Marston<00:01:18.909> would<00:01:19.030> wear<00:01:19.240> a<00:01:19.270> leather<00:01:19.540> hat

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:19.840 
think Marston would wear a leather hat

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.190 
think Marston would wear a leather hat
so<00:01:20.409> I<00:01:20.740> went<00:01:21.100> with<00:01:21.220> just<00:01:21.520> a<00:01:21.700> gambler<00:01:22.299> style<00:01:22.720> felt

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 
so I went with just a gambler style felt

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.800 
so I went with just a gambler style felt
hat<00:01:23.560> The<00:01:24.130> Gambler<00:01:24.460> style<00:01:24.790> hat<00:01:24.940> has<00:01:25.119> a<00:01:25.150> flat<00:01:25.450> top

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810 
hat The Gambler style hat has a flat top

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:27.450 
hat The Gambler style hat has a flat top
it<00:01:26.200> does<00:01:26.350> have<00:01:26.530> a<00:01:26.560> little<00:01:26.770> groove<00:01:27.010> around<00:01:27.310> the

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460 
it does have a little groove around the

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.880 
it does have a little groove around the
top<00:01:27.700> which<00:01:28.240> Marsten's<00:01:28.780> doesn't<00:01:29.290> have<00:01:29.500> but

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:29.890 
top which Marsten's doesn't have but

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:31.560 
top which Marsten's doesn't have but
other<00:01:30.100> than<00:01:30.460> that<00:01:30.520> it<00:01:30.909> really<00:01:31.090> does<00:01:31.299> look<00:01:31.329> a

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:31.570 
other than that it really does look a

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:33.510 
other than that it really does look a
lot<00:01:31.719> like<00:01:31.869> it<00:01:32.049> I<00:01:32.109> found<00:01:32.320> this<00:01:32.439> one<00:01:32.649> on<00:01:32.770> eBay<00:01:33.219> and

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.070 
it even had a hat band that was vaguely

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.370

reminiscent<00:01:36.670> of<00:01:37.000> Marsten's<00:01:37.539> hat<00:01:37.780> man<00:01:38.049> so

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
notches in it I had to whether it I used

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.380 
notches in it I had to whether it I used
pastels<00:01:44.869> I<00:01:45.170> just<00:01:45.409> wiped<00:01:45.680> brown<00:01:46.400> and<00:01:46.970> sort<00:01:47.330> of

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
pastels I just wiped brown and sort of

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:51.640 
flesh color pastels on my hands and then
just<00:01:49.820> handled<00:01:50.360> the<00:01:50.450> Hat<00:01:50.659> the<00:01:51.200> other<00:01:51.320> thing

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:51.650 
just handled the Hat the other thing

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:53.859 
just handled the Hat the other thing
that<00:01:51.979> I<00:01:52.159> added<00:01:52.700> here<00:01:52.909> is<00:01:53.090> the<00:01:53.270> feather<00:01:53.540> I

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:53.869 
that I added here is the feather I

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:55.450 
that I added here is the feather I
couldn't<00:01:54.290> find<00:01:54.440> a<00:01:54.590> feather<00:01:54.799> that<00:01:55.070> was<00:01:55.190> exactly

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
couldn't find a feather that was exactly

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.520 
couldn't find a feather that was exactly
like<00:01:55.700> this<00:01:56.030> I<00:01:56.210> believe<00:01:56.360> it's<00:01:56.630> supposed<00:01:57.290> to<00:01:57.350> be

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
like this I believe it's supposed to be

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.469 
like this I believe it's supposed to be
a<00:01:57.560> hawk<00:01:58.070> feather<00:01:58.399> in<00:01:58.610> the<00:01:58.700> game<00:01:58.909> but<00:01:59.210> I<00:01:59.270> did

00:01:59.469 --> 00:01:59.479 
a hawk feather in the game but I did

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:01.120

isn't quite the same size as that

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:43.999 
isn't quite the same size as that
because<00:04:43.020> basically

because basically

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:45.649 
because basically
Denix<00:04:44.370> doesn't<00:04:44.669> want<00:04:44.819> you<00:04:44.939> to<00:04:45.030> loading<00:04:45.270> real

bullets<00:04:46.080> into<00:04:46.289> their<00:04:46.439> replicas<00:04:47.069> I<00:04:47.580> had<00:04:48.180> to

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:48.300 
bullets into their replicas I had to

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.300 
bullets into their replicas I had to
wrap<00:04:48.479> those<00:04:48.719> and<00:04:49.080> some<00:04:49.319> electrical<00:04:49.830> tape<00:04:49.860> in

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:50.310 
wrap those and some electrical tape in

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:52.730 
wrap those and some electrical tape in
order<00:04:50.490> to<00:04:50.610> get<00:04:50.789> the<00:04:50.939> hold<00:04:51.780> onto<00:04:52.050> those<00:04:52.439> loops

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:52.740 
order to get the hold onto those loops

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:54.260 
order to get the hold onto those loops
but<00:04:53.069> it<00:04:53.310> looks<00:04:53.460> pretty<00:04:53.639> good<00:04:53.789> once<00:04:54.030> it's<00:04:54.180> all

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:54.270 
but it looks pretty good once it's all

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:57.320 
but it looks pretty good once it's all
together<00:04:54.419> the<00:04:55.050> weapon<00:04:55.919> itself<00:04:56.219> is<00:04:56.490> a<00:04:56.550> replica

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:57.330 
together the weapon itself is a replica

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.170 
together the weapon itself is a replica
of<00:04:57.360> a<00:04:57.629> Schofield<00:04:58.469> revolver<00:04:59.310> it's<00:04:59.580> a<00:04:59.699> fairly

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:00.180 
of a Schofield revolver it's a fairly

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:02.510 
of a Schofield revolver it's a fairly
decent<00:05:00.659> replica<00:05:01.469> it's<00:05:01.620> got<00:05:01.830> pretty<00:05:02.310> heavy

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:02.520 
decent replica it's got pretty heavy

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.790

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:07.169 
bullets that fit into it and I think it

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:07.969
