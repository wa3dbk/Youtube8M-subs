00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:22.000
 the issue of park needs e 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:24.130
 special or made as they say with the 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.730
 Syria that is invited 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:29.800
 an element of discrimination without 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.860
 horns or not 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:36.579
 with es as I agree 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:39.730
 extensively thinking that everyone of 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:42.040
 we have special needs 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:45.790
 I for one have educational needs 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:49.780
 special questions one 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:51.550
 rigid cut evaluation 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.640
 I'm not an evaluation expert 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:57.400
 But it takes me away from saying that we must 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:01.780
 go from you know we'll do it 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:04.150
 you can do if you can't do if it's that in the 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:08.500
 motion the possibility that each in 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:11.549
 understand that he cannot do what if he does not 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:15.430
 organize this must organize itself is 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.479
 fundamental for someone can use one 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.479
 word 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:22.530
 we click carefully scafati that is 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:26.320
 very easy to sow if we want 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:29.140
 if I point out someone who does not 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:32.050
 He knows the city in these hours 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:34.840
 desire I probably committed it there 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:38.770
 I must say lai up to the supply of 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:41.620
 gasoline that then still makes three 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:46.030
 certainly bayern instead this is it 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:46.980
 I'm producing a shelving one 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.750
 structure 

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:51.240
 free information support 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.250
 I need to believe that it does not exist 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.980
 information that does not need a 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:59.640
 minimum of acclimatization in ours 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:02.730
 head you can call this is the so 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.580
 do if if i have the opportunity to have 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:07.530
 the scaffolding that allows me to 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.910
 capture information that to stay in 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.190
 family 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.560
 if instead it must simply be one 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.320
 cloned reproduction 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:20.430
 and clear that they suffer I know that you are 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:25.140
 run away and this is a question that does not 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:28.140
 it's very easy to put your feet up if it is 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.660
 the evil watches over a school of the 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:34.440
 frontal structure and certainly does not have 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:36.660
 you have to deal with a number between 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:41.340
 the other very high of the components of the 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:43.760
 class then I ask only know how you know not 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.760
 you know 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.150
 and instead begins to become 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:54.360
 interesting resources I can put in 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:57.660
 collaboration also between the 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:01.170
 peers for whom direct interesting 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:05.820
 avoid isolating and seeing I know 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:07.500
 only i am not alone i know if these there 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:10.980
 they are also the others 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:14.060
 if I can work together with Francesco if 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:16.500
 can be accompanied in 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:18.270
 library from someone who knows how to move 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:21.480
 library etc. 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:25.020
 so i need the others that 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.250
 I discover competent professionals even in the 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:28.670
 companions 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:34.050
 this means that whoever is a teacher 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:37.260
 this block with 25 maruotti in front 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:39.740
 or it can be very isolated for the 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:44.070
 five potential collaborators 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:46.920
 I positive not many days ago with 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:49.890
 the teacher told her the important thing is 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.050
 work hard for the first three months 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:54.780
 of the year 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:57.090
 after that the school to free in 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:01.050
 three months fixes the wide base 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:03.460
 nizzi and then things but don't lose 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:07.730
 conspicuously keep 

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:10.910
 leave to class where the 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:14.000
 pylon in the most sinister sense 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:16.790
 of the material lands that are stored in the 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:20.950
 shelving drawers and so on 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:24.680
 etc. context also falls into one 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:29.080
 question that sooner or later addressed 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:29.080
 is that of the furnishings of objects 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:39.930
 the school 

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:42.480
 the projects the cubature in the school does not 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:46.710
 can only be measured on how many 

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:49.650
 subjects bring how we can put them 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:51.729
 a class becomes an impossible life 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:55.539
 if we are 

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:59.080
 the chickens in the holds to pour the subjects 

00:04:55.539 --> 00:05:02.249
 must be able to move that class of the 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:04.990
 Armenians to be able to store things for 

00:05:02.249 --> 00:05:07.599
 as I have already said, explore the world 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:09.189
 then the school as a starting point 

00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:12.580
 to go elsewhere 

00:05:09.189 --> 00:05:15.580
 come back with things photographs that 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:17.650
 what will it be that put together the 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:20.469
 possibility of making one habitable 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:25.389
 smart because i live do not happen one 

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:28.960
 lively space of the city between 

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:31.899
 the other this also links the school to 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:33.999
 cultivating the passions that he is also 

00:05:31.899 --> 00:05:36.969
 Italy that there are people who 

00:05:33.999 --> 00:05:39.430
 they don't get lowered by anything they get depressed 

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:41.860
 which we then have episodes with others 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:42.430
 newspapers of people who decide and 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:47.349
 to live 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:51.189
 and perfectly useless therefore immediately 

00:05:47.349 --> 00:05:53.169
 do not struggle so much and encouragement to 

00:05:51.189 --> 00:05:57.539
 follow this story called 

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:57.539
 because it seems very useful to me
