far as how this test works and what it's
doing<00:02:28.650> i'm<00:02:28.920> obviously<00:02:29.280> not<00:02:29.990> experienced

enough to know so if anyone has any idea

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.270 
enough to know so if anyone has any idea
exactly<00:02:33.690> how<00:02:34.020> something<00:02:34.410> like<00:02:34.530> this<00:02:34.590> works<00:02:35.040> or

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
exactly how something like this works or

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.760 
exactly how something like this works or
maybe<00:02:36.240> we<00:02:36.420> can<00:02:36.570> contact<00:02:36.810> the<00:02:37.110> company<00:02:37.290> that

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
maybe we can contact the company that

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.340 
maybe we can contact the company that
designed<00:02:38.550> the<00:02:38.670> speed<00:02:38.970> test<00:02:39.180> exactly<00:02:39.750> what

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
designed the speed test exactly what

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.500 
designed the speed test exactly what
it's<00:02:40.500> working<00:02:40.860> with<00:02:41.010> we<00:02:42.000> can<00:02:42.150> get<00:02:42.240> a<00:02:42.300> better

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
it's working with we can get a better

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:45.230 
it's working with we can get a better
idea<00:02:42.600> of<00:02:43.020> what<00:02:43.710> these<00:02:43.860> mean<00:02:44.160> to<00:02:44.370> us<00:02:44.520> the<00:02:44.910> the

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
idea of what these mean to us the the

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.360 
idea of what these mean to us the the
average<00:02:45.600> user<00:02:45.840> like<00:02:46.350> myself<00:02:46.560> maybe<00:02:47.100> not

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
average user like myself maybe not

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.490 
average user like myself maybe not
everyone<00:02:47.850> who's<00:02:48.060> watching<00:02:48.210> this<00:02:48.510> video<00:02:48.810> may

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
know better than myself but to have half

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.500 
know better than myself but to have half
the<00:02:52.230> speeds<00:02:52.709> i<00:02:53.010> would<00:02:53.430> guess<00:02:53.640> would<00:02:54.030> be<00:02:54.300> a

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
the speeds i would guess would be a

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.690 
the speeds i would guess would be a
tremendous<00:02:54.780> difference<00:02:55.320> when<00:02:56.280> you're<00:02:56.430> doing

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
tremendous difference when you're doing

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.750 
tremendous difference when you're doing
certain<00:02:56.940> things<00:02:57.080> on<00:02:58.080> that<00:02:58.440> as<00:02:58.590> far<00:02:58.860> as<00:02:59.040> you

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
certain things on that as far as you

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.630 
certain things on that as far as you
know<00:02:59.880> saving<00:03:00.570> and<00:03:00.840> and<00:03:01.140> and<00:03:01.470> converting<00:03:02.400> files

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
know saving and and and converting files

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.050 
know saving and and and converting files
and<00:03:03.240> that<00:03:03.959> would<00:03:04.080> involve<00:03:04.350> saving<00:03:05.070> on<00:03:05.220> the<00:03:05.370> the

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
and that would involve saving on the the

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.990 
and that would involve saving on the the
hard<00:03:06.750> drive<00:03:07.020> and<00:03:07.520> accessing<00:03:08.520> and<00:03:08.670> doing

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
hard drive and accessing and doing

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.180 
hard drive and accessing and doing
things<00:03:09.150> like<00:03:09.390> that<00:03:09.570> so<00:03:10.260> that's<00:03:10.770> pretty<00:03:11.040> much

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
things like that so that's pretty much
