00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.429
 part I do not want spring to go 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:29.310
 summer this warmth that I have 

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:31.140
 enjoyed everything I could now 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.570
 many of the trends that I will be 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.430
 mentioning have been fashionable but 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.800
 what happens is that they are going to put more 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.050
 Strong trends do not fade from 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.910
 overnight, everything depends 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.440
 of the consumer and the consumer are 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.450
 us so there are some trends 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.670
 that do not stick so much because they are not 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.770
 centering of our liking and some 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.200
 others hit a lot more because we 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.180
 like and we want to continue using them and 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.220
 we are the ones who keep them 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.930
 current but good here I present this 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:01.050
 abstract the vibrant colors are going to 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.150
 be super intendencias if you are hearing 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.070
 right now for fall-winter 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:09.070
 they come in vogue the colors vibrate 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:12.580
 intense as blue is the color 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:15.970
 came the pink color in all its 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:17.680
 tonalities also the green color all 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.710
 whatever in emerald green 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.690
 better if it is intense in green that goes more 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.729
 in the dark minutes of the colors that are 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:26.410
 they're going to stand out a lot and we've 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:28.750
 seen right now in the summer but right now 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:31.000
 are going to be highlighting even more are 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.700
 the purple colors but also in the 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.290
 darker and more intense tonalities 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:38.710
 colors that you already come in 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:40.960
 trend for several seasons and 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:43.570
 right now in the summer we were watching 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.700
 and they were very in trend but for 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:49.479
 the fall winter will come more 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:52.390
 strong that never clear in textures and in 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:55.720
 clothes that are more appropriate 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:57.940
 for the cold the tartan or paintings not only 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.979
 in red and black but in different 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:02.530
 colors the sports trend I think 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:04.360
 this and all of us including the 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.490
 that are not so sporty has 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:09.489
 delighted has shown including 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.720
 lately of these sports fans the 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:13.480
 sweatshirts 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:16.480
 city ​​were female and female with 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:19.330
 flowery touches with those designs that the 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.340
 they make the simple ester a bit more chic 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.800
 it becomes a sports and many 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.780
 clothes more than everything in fabrics that we 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.640
 They remind men's fashion but 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.010
 giving our feminine touch the 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.750
 wide leg pants but now 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.900
 I think you are going to opt for some colors 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.250
 darker plus autumn prints 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.650
 wild when I refer to the 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:41.530
 wild prints I mean these 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:43.600
 garments that are those of leopard that already 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.700
 back 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.770
 and in the end it became a classic 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:51.160
 but now we're going to have the stamp of 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:53.459
 snake some prints that simulate 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:56.740
 be chira print the squared skirts 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:59.050
 or for Latvia nash remind us a lot 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:01.780
 the sixties fashions are very feminine 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:03.970
 this trend is already a necessity in the 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.980
 autumn-winter and we no longer use it 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:09.610
 simply for fashion but we use it 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:13.120
 because we need it and it's the sweaters 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:16.180
 which are thick fluffy sweaters 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.630
 textured in shape without silhouettes that 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.450
 be 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:21.190
 more square looser and in colors 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:23.470
 solids will also come with 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:26.080
 prints but with some prints 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:28.180
 to the west the flowers the flowers always 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.830
 we believe that the flowers are from the 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:31.990
 spring and summer but in this 

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:34.420
 occasion comes the flowers but with some 

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:37.420
 darker tones and backgrounds 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:40.150
 dark trench coat style coats 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:44.140
 also ones that are combination of 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:46.180
 textures in color blog and large coats 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:49.390
 of colors but if you are going to use the 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:51.220
 Large coats use proportion for 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:53.020
 Do not give yourself totally lost in the look 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:55.450
 also the legs and legs we 

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:57.790
 They are reminiscent of military fashion 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:04:00.610
 military fashion also comes back 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:03.520
 but this time with a small 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:06.130
 update a bit more modern than 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:09.040
 previously the chips thanks these 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:11.020
 dresses or these loose dresses with 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.790
 loose silhouettes that to me personally 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:16.299
 fascinates me but in this opportunity 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:18.280
 They come with necklaces and with details of 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:20.799
 jewelry to give you a little more 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:23.380
 update the love of the 50s and the 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:26.200
 sixties but this time they come 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:28.960
 or more modern pretty female with 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:32.020
 these fitted skirts and jacques 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.670
 large and square style jackets 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:36.070
 motorcyclists these we have seen 

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:38.020
 formerly girls but now they come 

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:41.410
 with prints with floral prints 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:43.810
 with patterned prints with prints 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:46.210
 of male fabrics details of feathers 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:48.280
 in the garments but I think this does not 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:51.250
 it's going to be seeing a lot because it's not 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:52.690
 I like everyone but the 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:56.230
 Feather details are going to be present 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:58.510
 coveralls or works like most 

00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:00.700
 we know this trend and 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:03.400
 have some time with us and 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:05.320
 some of us have refused 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:08.140
 flatly by some others we 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:10.030
 love and this trend is going to 

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:11.560
 continue right now in the autumn-winter but 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:14.320
 in pants and we 'll see it in 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:16.300
 Very casual styles and in more styles 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:19.360
 elegant line patterns but 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:22.060
 pretty geometric prints and 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:24.850
 means the mattresses the skirts me 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:26.500
 come again fashionable have been of 

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:28.540
 Fashion right now in the spring and summer 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:29.920
 and they will continue to be fashionable but they are going to 

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:32.950
 be combining with bull 

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:35.260
 and with darker colors and more of the 

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:36.850
 season but these skirts are still 

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:38.590
 because it was one of my tendencies 

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:40.360
 favorites right now in the spring and the 

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:42.490
 summer and then for what lasts 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:44.740
 transition for the winter I think it's going 

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:47.530
 to look very good and also the 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:50.230
 miniskirts in different designs 

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:52.300
 and asymmetric will continue in trend 

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:54.850
 you know girls that trends 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:57.040
 we attach them to our style 

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:59.170
 to our taste to our personality 

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:01.450
 we do not necessarily have to follow them 

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:04.720
 as they come to adapt what we 

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:07.090
 like the trends stay and last 

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:09.730
 for us because we like it 

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:11.440
 if we do not like let's go and just 

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:14.140
 let's stay with the things that we like 

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:16.660
 some things as I always say no 

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:18.730
 they are my taste they are not from me it seems that 

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:20.500
 they know that in a matter of tastes it is 

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:23.050
 respectable everything then there are some 

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:24.790
 things that are not to my taste and I do not know 

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:27.850
 tell you what trend you like 

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:30.010
 more than trend you say no no no 

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:31.630
