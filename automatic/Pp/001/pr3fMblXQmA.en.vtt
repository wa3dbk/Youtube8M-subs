going to show you guys that airplane and

00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:17.090 
going to show you guys that airplane and
it's<00:00:16.109> one<00:00:16.289> of<00:00:16.320> the<00:00:16.410> biggest<00:00:16.590> airplanes<00:00:16.980> in<00:00:17.070> the

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
it's one of the biggest airplanes in the

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.680 
it's one of the biggest airplanes in the
games<00:00:17.369> I<00:00:17.609> think<00:00:17.820> it's<00:00:17.940> actually<00:00:18.060> the<00:00:18.510> biggest

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
games I think it's actually the biggest

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.830 
games I think it's actually the biggest
airplane<00:00:19.109> in<00:00:19.320> the<00:00:19.410> game<00:00:19.560> not<00:00:20.460> too<00:00:20.640> short<00:00:20.850> but

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
airplane in the game not too short but

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.890 
airplane in the game not too short but
we're<00:00:21.960> going<00:00:22.050> to<00:00:22.109> go<00:00:22.230> over<00:00:22.260> there<00:00:22.619> and

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:23.900 
we're going to go over there and

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.410 
we're going to go over there and
hopefully<00:00:24.900> this<00:00:25.710> time<00:00:25.949> it<00:00:26.189> won't<00:00:26.279> crash<00:00:26.609> and<00:00:27.390> I

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
hopefully this time it won't crash and I

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.589 
hopefully this time it won't crash and I
say<00:00:27.599> that<00:00:27.630> because<00:00:28.340> oddly<00:00:29.340> enough<00:00:29.369> either<00:00:30.150> my

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
say that because oddly enough either my

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:25.330 

all<00:02:04.140> right<00:02:04.320> let's<00:02:04.560> do<00:02:04.740> this<00:02:04.799> to<00:02:05.250> this

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.360 

okay<00:02:26.120> I'm<00:02:26.239> being<00:02:26.599> very<00:02:27.069> delicate<00:02:28.069> with<00:02:28.190> this

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
okay I'm being very delicate with this

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.270 
okay I'm being very delicate with this
plane<00:02:28.730> because<00:02:29.150> as<00:02:29.540> I<00:02:29.690> said<00:02:30.040> whenever<00:02:31.040> I<00:02:31.160> touch

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
plane because as I said whenever I touch

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.699 
plane because as I said whenever I touch
something<00:02:31.910> it'll<00:02:32.150> just<00:02:32.480> snap<00:02:32.599> in<00:02:32.959> half<00:02:33.200> and<00:02:33.650> I

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
something it'll just snap in half and I

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:35.500 
something it'll just snap in half and I
find<00:02:34.069> it<00:02:34.220> pretty<00:02:34.250> funny<00:02:34.790> but<00:02:34.970> pretty<00:02:35.269> annoying

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510

00:02:40.839 --> 00:02:40.849 
the hell is playing just slapping a half

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:43.509

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430

because I helicopter to catch shooting
me<00:04:53.630> down<00:04:53.780> so<00:04:54.560> apparently<00:04:54.740> guys<00:04:55.070> I<00:04:55.190> won't<00:04:55.370> be

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:55.430 
me down so apparently guys I won't be

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:57.750 
me down so apparently guys I won't be
able<00:04:55.520> to<00:04:55.639> show<00:04:55.820> you<00:04:55.880> the<00:04:56.150> jumbo<00:04:56.810> jet<00:04:57.020> airplane

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:57.760 
able to show you the jumbo jet airplane

00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:01.600 
able to show you the jumbo jet airplane
gameplay<00:04:58.760> for<00:04:59.570> now<00:04:59.720> because<00:05:00.289> the<00:05:01.039> cops<00:05:01.340> won't

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:01.610 
gameplay for now because the cops won't

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:03.279 
gameplay for now because the cops won't
let<00:05:01.820> me<00:05:01.970> whenever<00:05:02.389> I<00:05:02.449> get<00:05:02.630> into<00:05:02.780> the<00:05:02.870> air<00:05:02.990> the

00:05:03.279 --> 00:05:03.289 
let me whenever I get into the air the

00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:04.840 
let me whenever I get into the air the
airplane<00:05:03.590> is<00:05:03.680> just<00:05:03.919> shoots<00:05:04.190> at<00:05:04.370> me<00:05:04.490> and<00:05:04.639> I

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:04.850 
airplane is just shoots at me and I

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:06.779 
airplane is just shoots at me and I
guess<00:05:05.690> that's<00:05:05.900> why<00:05:06.080> it<00:05:06.139> snaps<00:05:06.500> in<00:05:06.620> half

00:05:06.779 --> 00:05:06.789 
guess that's why it snaps in half

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:09.430 
guess that's why it snaps in half
anyways<00:05:07.789> this<00:05:07.910> has<00:05:08.060> been<00:05:08.180> vex<00:05:08.449> I'll<00:05:09.050> see<00:05:09.260> y'all
