started<00:02:31.680> to<00:02:31.800> leak<00:02:31.980> well<00:02:32.430> it's<00:02:32.550> not<00:02:32.730> a<00:02:32.790> fun

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
started to leak well it's not a fun

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.890 
started to leak well it's not a fun
thing<00:02:33.320> to<00:02:34.320> come<00:02:34.500> across<00:02:34.860> in<00:02:35.190> any<00:02:35.730> product<00:02:36.060> I'm

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
thing to come across in any product I'm

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.960 
thing to come across in any product I'm
gonna<00:02:37.110> take<00:02:37.320> the<00:02:37.410> support<00:02:37.769> on<00:02:38.010> the<00:02:38.459> side<00:02:38.700> and

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
are back we got them all taken care of

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.060 
are back we got them all taken care of
and<00:02:44.870> there's<00:02:45.870> only<00:02:45.930> four<00:02:46.290> twisty<00:02:46.709> ties<00:02:46.890> with

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
and there's only four twisty ties with

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:50.360 
and there's only four twisty ties with
this<00:02:47.280> one<00:02:48.239> near<00:02:48.420> the<00:02:48.450> apart<00:02:49.380> the<00:02:49.769> front<00:02:50.130> part

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
this one near the apart the front part

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:51.890 
this one near the apart the front part
of<00:02:50.430> the<00:02:50.489> chain<00:02:50.730> one<00:02:51.060> on<00:02:51.150> the<00:02:51.269> top<00:02:51.480> of<00:02:51.630> the<00:02:51.690> chain

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
of the chain one on the top of the chain

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.270 
of the chain one on the top of the chain
and<00:02:52.140> two<00:02:52.260> and<00:02:52.410> the<00:02:52.500> legs<00:02:52.680> it's<00:02:52.890> just<00:02:53.040> probably

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
and two and the legs it's just probably

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.930 
and two and the legs it's just probably
so<00:02:54.470> it's<00:02:55.470> not<00:02:55.590> too<00:02:55.799> hard<00:02:56.130> as<00:02:56.459> long<00:02:56.610> as<00:02:56.700> you<00:02:56.790> know

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
so it's not too hard as long as you know

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.830 
so it's not too hard as long as you know
how<00:02:57.150> to<00:02:57.209> do<00:02:57.420> it<00:02:57.600> and<00:02:58.970> simply<00:02:59.970> you<00:03:00.180> have<00:03:00.450> to<00:03:00.690> take

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
how to do it and simply you have to take

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.600 
how to do it and simply you have to take
it<00:03:00.959> by<00:03:01.049> the<00:03:01.080> head<00:03:01.350> and<00:03:01.380> throw<00:03:02.250> it<00:03:02.370> across<00:03:02.430> the

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
it by the head and throw it across the

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.930 
it by the head and throw it across the
room<00:03:02.730> I'm<00:03:03.450> just<00:03:03.690> kidding<00:03:04.640> you<00:03:05.640> have<00:03:05.700> to<00:03:05.820> say

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
room I'm just kidding you have to say

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.820 
room I'm just kidding you have to say
goodbye<00:03:06.150> the<00:03:06.209> head<00:03:06.450> and<00:03:06.690> twist<00:03:07.410> it<00:03:07.590> either

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
goodbye the head and twist it either

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.400 
goodbye the head and twist it either
left<00:03:08.100> or<00:03:08.250> right<00:03:08.310> I<00:03:08.489> forget<00:03:08.880> which<00:03:09.000> one<00:03:09.299> but<00:03:10.019> I

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
left or right I forget which one but I

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:12.770 
left or right I forget which one but I
would<00:03:10.739> assume<00:03:10.860> lefty<00:03:11.430> loosey<00:03:11.850> so<00:03:12.209> maybe<00:03:12.660> you

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
would assume lefty loosey so maybe you

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.960 
would assume lefty loosey so maybe you
twist<00:03:13.049> it<00:03:13.170> that<00:03:13.320> way<00:03:13.530> and<00:03:13.799> it<00:03:14.250> kind<00:03:14.519> of<00:03:14.580> unfolds

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
twist it that way and it kind of unfolds

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.949 
twist it that way and it kind of unfolds
itself<00:03:15.410> so<00:03:16.410> here<00:03:17.100> we<00:03:17.220> have<00:03:17.400> the<00:03:17.820> r2d2<00:03:18.299> LED

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
itself so here we have the r2d2 LED

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:21.740 
itself so here we have the r2d2 LED
keychain<00:03:19.680> light<00:03:19.890> very<00:03:20.489> nice<00:03:20.700> actually<00:03:21.390> I'll

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
keychain light very nice actually I'll

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.660 
keychain light very nice actually I'll
probably<00:03:21.959> stick<00:03:22.320> this<00:03:22.470> on<00:03:22.650> a<00:03:22.680> backpack

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
probably stick this on a backpack

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.150 
probably stick this on a backpack
somewhere<00:03:24.120> very<00:03:24.989> well<00:03:25.230> detailed<00:03:25.470> just<00:03:25.980> like

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
somewhere very well detailed just like

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.220 
somewhere very well detailed just like
the<00:03:26.280> minifigure<00:03:26.850> which<00:03:27.120> is<00:03:27.239> nice<00:03:27.450> because<00:03:27.959> you

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
the minifigure which is nice because you

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.820 
the minifigure which is nice because you
know<00:03:28.530> sometimes<00:03:28.830> the<00:03:29.160> larger<00:03:30.620> LED<00:03:31.620> lights

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830 
know sometimes the larger LED lights

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:33.770 
know sometimes the larger LED lights
really<00:03:32.400> captures<00:03:32.819> terms<00:03:33.090> of<00:03:33.270> meeting<00:03:33.540> figure

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
really captures terms of meeting figure

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.740 
really captures terms of meeting figure
details<00:03:34.200> and<00:03:34.530> if<00:03:35.250> you<00:03:35.370> want<00:03:35.610> you<00:03:35.790> know<00:03:35.910> that's

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
details and if you want you know that's

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.290 
details and if you want you know that's
how<00:03:36.960> they<00:03:37.110> make<00:03:37.350> them<00:03:37.620> big<00:03:38.520> I<00:03:38.760> mean<00:03:39.060> when<00:03:39.210> it

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:39.300 
how they make them big I mean when it

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:42.080 
how they make them big I mean when it
comes<00:03:39.330> to<00:03:39.570> new<00:03:39.750> pieces<00:03:40.020> and<00:03:40.290> things<00:03:41.250> you<00:03:42.000> know

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
comes to new pieces and things you know

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.420 
comes to new pieces and things you know
they<00:03:42.270> sculpt<00:03:42.690> a<00:03:42.750> larger<00:03:43.140> model<00:03:43.380> and<00:03:43.770> then

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
they sculpt a larger model and then

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.910 
they sculpt a larger model and then
shrink<00:03:44.970> it<00:03:45.090> down<00:03:45.240> to<00:03:45.630> make<00:03:46.050> it<00:03:46.200> more

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
shrink it down to make it more

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.260 
shrink it down to make it more
minifigure<00:03:47.580> or<00:03:47.940> a<00:03:48.390> lego<00:03:48.840> scale<00:03:49.910> we<00:03:50.910> got<00:03:51.090> a<00:03:51.120> lot

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:51.270 
minifigure or a lego scale we got a lot

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:52.910 
minifigure or a lego scale we got a lot
of<00:03:51.300> the<00:03:51.420> basic<00:03:51.750> printing<00:03:52.080> here<00:03:52.260> and<00:03:52.470> right<00:03:52.800> in

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
of the basic printing here and right in

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.910 
of the basic printing here and right in
the<00:03:52.980> middle<00:03:53.160> where<00:03:53.910> you<00:03:54.000> can<00:03:54.120> see<00:03:54.300> the<00:03:54.450> two

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:54.920 
the middle where you can see the two

00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:00.500 
the middle where you can see the two
blue<00:03:55.920> lines<00:03:57.200> I<00:03:58.700> think<00:03:59.700> those<00:03:59.880> are<00:03:59.910> part<00:04:00.270> of<00:04:00.330> his

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
blue lines I think those are part of his

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:03.280 
blue lines I think those are part of his
like<00:04:01.070> receptors<00:04:02.070> I<00:04:02.220> forget<00:04:02.730> what<00:04:02.850> they<00:04:02.970> are

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 
like receptors I forget what they are

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:05.240 
like receptors I forget what they are
that's<00:04:04.290> where<00:04:04.530> you<00:04:04.650> press<00:04:04.860> the<00:04:04.890> button<00:04:05.220> you

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
that's where you press the button you

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.490 
that's where you press the button you
can<00:04:05.430> kind<00:04:05.610> of<00:04:05.670> see<00:04:05.910> the<00:04:06.060> square<00:04:06.510> outline<00:04:07.110> in

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
can kind of see the square outline in

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:12.470 
can kind of see the square outline in
there<00:04:08.190> and<00:04:08.690> it<00:04:09.690> does<00:04:10.050> work<00:04:10.730> it's<00:04:11.730> a<00:04:11.760> little<00:04:12.330> bit

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
there and it does work it's a little bit

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.150 
there and it does work it's a little bit
low<00:04:12.750> on<00:04:12.959> light<00:04:13.200> maybe<00:04:13.470> it's<00:04:13.680> been<00:04:13.830> a<00:04:13.860> lot<00:04:14.130> of

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
low on light maybe it's been a lot of

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.130 
low on light maybe it's been a lot of
use<00:04:14.550> for<00:04:14.970> you<00:04:15.120> know<00:04:15.150> because<00:04:15.450> it's<00:04:15.600> a<00:04:15.690> try<00:04:15.959> me

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:16.140 
use for you know because it's a try me

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:17.870 
use for you know because it's a try me
thing<00:04:16.440> and<00:04:16.650> it's<00:04:17.160> Stewart<00:04:17.400> you<00:04:17.669> know<00:04:17.760> you

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
thing and it's Stewart you know you

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.270 
thing and it's Stewart you know you
could<00:04:18.000> try<00:04:18.150> that<00:04:18.390> for<00:04:18.510> a<00:04:18.570> whole<00:04:18.720> day<00:04:18.900> and<00:04:19.280> it

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
could try that for a whole day and it

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.510 
could try that for a whole day and it
still<00:04:20.880> shines<00:04:21.329> I<00:04:21.660> still<00:04:22.019> like<00:04:22.169> it<00:04:22.200> I<00:04:22.530> might

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
still shines I still like it I might

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:24.860 
still shines I still like it I might
have<00:04:23.669> to<00:04:23.790> work<00:04:24.060> on<00:04:24.210> the<00:04:24.270> batteries<00:04:24.600> just<00:04:24.780> a

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
have to work on the batteries just a

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.510 
have to work on the batteries just a
little<00:04:25.110> bit<00:04:25.290> and<00:04:25.770> you<00:04:25.919> can<00:04:25.950> also<00:04:26.160> pull<00:04:26.490> the

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
little bit and you can also pull the

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.310 
little bit and you can also pull the
legs<00:04:26.880> in<00:04:27.090> different<00:04:27.390> directions<00:04:27.630> just<00:04:28.200> like

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 
legs in different directions just like

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.620 
legs in different directions just like
the<00:04:28.440> minifigure<00:04:28.980> but<00:04:29.669> they<00:04:29.880> do<00:04:29.940> not<00:04:30.210> come<00:04:30.450> off

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:30.630 
the minifigure but they do not come off

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:34.130 
the minifigure but they do not come off
obviously<00:04:31.910> because<00:04:32.910> this<00:04:33.030> is<00:04:33.180> a<00:04:33.210> keychain<00:04:33.960> and

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:34.140 
obviously because this is a keychain and

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:36.020 
obviously because this is a keychain and
swilley<00:04:34.350> not<00:04:34.590> meant<00:04:34.770> to<00:04:34.860> be<00:04:34.950> just<00:04:35.340> a

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
swilley not meant to be just a

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:37.090 
swilley not meant to be just a
minifigure

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:37.100 
minifigure

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.350 
minifigure
but<00:04:38.100> it's<00:04:38.250> nice<00:04:38.460> you<00:04:38.730> could<00:04:38.850> have<00:04:39.030> it<00:04:39.180> walk

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 
but it's nice you could have it walk

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.530 
but it's nice you could have it walk
around<00:04:39.750> or<00:04:40.400> position<00:04:41.400> upright<00:04:41.790> or<00:04:42.150> something

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:42.540 
around or position upright or something

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:45.770 
around or position upright or something
you<00:04:42.900> could<00:04:43.050> put<00:04:43.229> it<00:04:43.320> on<00:04:43.410> a<00:04:43.440> table<00:04:44.010> and<00:04:44.780> shine

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780 
you could put it on a table and shine

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.770 
you could put it on a table and shine
the<00:04:45.930> light<00:04:46.080> a<00:04:46.110> certain<00:04:46.470> way<00:04:47.330> so<00:04:48.330> that<00:04:48.479> I<00:04:48.510> know

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:48.780 
the light a certain way so that I know

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:50.330 
the light a certain way so that I know
it's<00:04:48.930> hard<00:04:49.080> to<00:04:49.140> see<00:04:49.350> because<00:04:49.590> it's<00:04:49.770> daytime

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.340 
it's hard to see because it's daytime

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.909 
it's hard to see because it's daytime
and<00:04:50.840> you<00:04:51.840> could<00:04:51.990> have<00:04:52.140> it<00:04:52.200> look<00:04:52.590> around

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:52.919 
and you could have it look around

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:54.710 
and you could have it look around
different<00:04:53.190> areas<00:04:53.669> it's<00:04:53.970> kind<00:04:54.120> of<00:04:54.180> nice<00:04:54.360> you

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 
different areas it's kind of nice you

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.530 
different areas it's kind of nice you
know<00:04:54.840> it<00:04:55.080> provides<00:04:55.710> its<00:04:55.890> own<00:04:56.070> little<00:04:56.370> stand<00:04:57.360> I

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:57.540 
know it provides its own little stand I

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:59.360 
know it provides its own little stand I
guess<00:04:57.780> it's<00:04:58.260> like<00:04:58.320> a<00:04:58.470> spotlight<00:04:58.979> if<00:04:59.100> you<00:04:59.190> turn

00:04:59.360 --> 00:04:59.370 
guess it's like a spotlight if you turn

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:02.870 
guess it's like a spotlight if you turn
it<00:04:59.490> this<00:04:59.640> way<00:04:59.700> so<00:05:00.890> nice<00:05:01.890> looking<00:05:02.160> keychain<00:05:02.669> I
