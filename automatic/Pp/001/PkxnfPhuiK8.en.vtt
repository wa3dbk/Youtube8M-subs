00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:05.089
 The first few times I saw the BMW X6 was what exactly happened in Frankfort I for a moment 

00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:08.089
 must admit immediately I found it really nothing 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:12.820
 today are here in the north skyline in the united states to go the wagon 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:15.370
 drive to experience the real knowledge and I am a little bit 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:19.620
 is actually turned on the road in his car already was 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.630
 that you are at a fair for his city 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.289
 does not alter the fact that the car is very cheeky and put down because of that 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:26.580
 essevee backwards 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.919
 actually knew his last honor 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:32.350
 the top beautiful spring weather those two together 

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:35.150
 you have to love it but don't forget it 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:39.260
 this is a car thief really american car giant booked the american market 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.900
 and year 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.130
 if you are not against it in any way 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:47.450
 yes they are not subtle and for that it will be rewarded at the same time it is not strange 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.020
 this car hits the same tire as the x5 rarely stands on the chassis 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:56.460
 you would actually expect it to be no different than an x ​​5 with a slant 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.440
 behind that but that is too short through the bend 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.590
 the most important technical is the band behind this difference that it is there 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.230
 For example, I am monitoring the sector that systems 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:06.570
 what the torque is the power of the wheels 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.570
 left and right controls the need according to the length of time so that you have one 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.110
 A seat adjustment would be simultaneously in a tank that with caterpillars left and right 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:15.610
 adjust it is 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.940
 the system that makes this car in extreme cases 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:20.980
 becomes much more stable and sharper than here 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:24.190
 you would expect what it is even the x5 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:26.480
 however, we are reading the feeling you have 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:30.200
 that is, he was proud to be patronizing that website 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.470
 naturally you can not be fooled, he sends very sharp this car 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.890
 is only available a turbo engine and two diesels the three liters 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.790
 and the three and a half liters 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:43.780
 and then there are two gasoline engines, the 3 and 11, and here dares could be four liters 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.820
 the latter are new v8 and 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.560
 I got him to ride last week who believe I have that v8 this morning 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.650
 food becomes and that 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:54.650
 you really want to do that by taking steps on his knee 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.729
 tehran would be the knmi hour the bmw x6 is built 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.239
 together with the x5 and the z4 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:15.560
 half of the year is actually sold in America 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.560
 the cue ball for the gentlemen b and w the initiators 

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:40.949
 that almost three-quarters of the fallen star 

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:44.619
 very nice and pleasant idea if you sit dry on the normal road 

00:02:44.619 --> 00:02:45.799
 nice weather 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:49.230
 It really becomes the world's police since they are two or three years later 

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:50.939
 stepped up on Verzijlbergh 

00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:53.949
 the effect of this is located the streets away 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:01.219
 from all sides and always good that it is very special oil 

00:03:01.219 --> 00:03:03.909
 backside always adjusts it is actually 

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:07.569
 introduced in a bad daylight that has king over if I want to say 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:10.089
 technology company killing 

00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:11.689
 play Thursday 

00:03:11.689 --> 00:03:13.229
 this is really appreciate 

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:16.229
 the circumstances are very safe 

00:03:17.089 --> 00:03:18.369
 madness 

00:03:18.369 --> 00:03:21.289
 bob the bergeyck hope the outside of the bend and 

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:23.659
 well he is also heading in the right direction 

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:26.659
 the helpline is all too bright of course 

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:46.069
 tomorrow on the public road what is the name of this car just a nice sharp steering 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:49.069
 but there is something even more refined about the x5 

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:53.249
 real brand and what that system what if it does a little safety do that 

00:03:53.249 --> 00:03:57.879
 you ride on the circuit on wet and dry also very fast you break out but 

00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:01.019
 it is fantastic controlled and you have that car under control I think 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:04.989
 just being a top driver is just as safe that it is almost a matter 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:05.709
 to become 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:09.739
 Do you want to try it yourself May 31 put this car at the Dutch growers 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:14.669
 extensive row report of this test were content a week with 17 out of 23 

00:04:14.669 --> 00:04:16.349
 in stores in April
