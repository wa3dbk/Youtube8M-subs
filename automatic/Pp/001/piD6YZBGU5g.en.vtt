you<00:01:46.380> know<00:01:46.500> finishes<00:01:46.979> with<00:01:47.130> why<00:01:47.549> you<00:01:48.210> I<00:01:48.540> opie

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
you know finishes with why you I opie

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.910 
you know finishes with why you I opie
right<00:01:49.829> so<00:01:50.399> in<00:01:50.729> order<00:01:51.149> and<00:01:51.899> these<00:01:52.500> buttons<00:01:52.799> are

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
right so in order and these buttons are

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.230 
right so in order and these buttons are
basically<00:01:53.310> for<00:01:53.490> your<00:01:53.579> left<00:01:53.759> thumb<00:01:53.939> and<00:01:54.180> you

basically for your left thumb and you

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.319 
basically for your left thumb and you
write<00:01:54.420> them<00:01:54.630> now<00:01:55.110> obviously<00:01:56.180> you're<00:01:57.180> not

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
write them now obviously you're not

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.170 
write them now obviously you're not
meant<00:01:57.689> to<00:01:57.810> type<00:01:58.350> T<00:01:58.770> and<00:01:59.040> stretch<00:01:59.790> all<00:02:00.000> the<00:02:00.060> way

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
meant to type T and stretch all the way

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.870 
meant to type T and stretch all the way
here<00:02:00.570> with<00:02:00.990> why<00:02:01.380> are<00:02:01.740> to<00:02:02.310> the<00:02:02.430> Y<00:02:02.579> rather

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
here with why are to the Y rather

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.240 
here with why are to the Y rather
because<00:02:03.630> that<00:02:04.229> defeats<00:02:04.530> the<00:02:04.530> point<00:02:04.799> of<00:02:05.040> having

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
because that defeats the point of having

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.670 
because that defeats the point of having
two<00:02:05.610> separate<00:02:05.969> keyboards<00:02:06.689> so<00:02:07.079> there's

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
two separate keyboards so there's

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.750 
two separate keyboards so there's
actually<00:02:08.569> after<00:02:09.569> the<00:02:09.599> T<00:02:09.869> G<00:02:10.349> and<00:02:10.560> V<00:02:10.590> and<00:02:11.069> before

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
actually after the T G and V and before

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.170 
actually after the T G and V and before
the<00:02:11.879> Y<00:02:12.030> hmb

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
the Y hmb

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.750 
the Y hmb
there<00:02:13.329> are<00:02:13.599> invisible<00:02:14.319> buttons<00:02:14.859> of<00:02:15.099> the
