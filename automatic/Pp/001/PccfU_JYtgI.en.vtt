00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.650
 how are you welcome to this link today 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:18.369
 I'm going to show you how the 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:20.550
 fried ronchi shrimp and the secret that 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:23.140
 they fit well I think we need 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.539
 shrimp here of big shrimp then of 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:28.180
 medium shrimp I have flour and it 's 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:30.310
 sifted and I have two eggs already 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:32.529
 Hypermarket food gets a little 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:36.460
 here we have the hyper is mounted 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:38.470
 lemon pepper let's make 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.949
 eggs that we have here can we 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:40.949
 beat well 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.750
 you already have your lime suffering I'm going to 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:51.640
 add also a little bit of lamonte 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:54.809
 per it gives them a delicious flavor until 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.809
 his egg is well inserted 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.120
 the whole joke is that we make 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.940
 go through the shrimp for flour two 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.290
 times for the shrimp to go and 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.700
 comes clean washed 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.700
 we are not going to pepper 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.110
 pepper 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:21.620
 and we pass them through the sand we accept the 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.620
 shrimp for flour 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.400
 as well 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.250
 and ready and to the egg 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.409
 Y 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.409
 one 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:44.460
 two 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.460
 four cameras we put him 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.000
 and integrate with the egg that is 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.920
 paste well because later the 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.210
 let's go back again to the flour is 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.220
 from the secret so that they remain 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.770
 good free 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:59.040
 ok what comes back we go again to the 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.040
 flour 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:11.480
 and then we're going to fry them like an oil 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:14.870
 in a pan the oil to the top that 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:18.230
 is display does not have to be fine 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.630
 in the in the oil we will go through 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.630
 the flour 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:26.040
 and that's it, since we have them here 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:26.040
 we take out and take them to the fryer 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:39.120
 we already bring the shrimp along with a 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.650
 little absorbent paper to remove 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:45.110
 the fat here I bring a plate 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:48.470
 to present them we put our 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.640
 shrimp if they feel that they are okay with 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.940
 chips 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:55.280
 and one day what they want a dressing 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:57.440
 but here I have a day that says the 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.830
 tomorrow it's cream with mayonnaise and 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:03.790
 Peppers 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:06.420
 and also because not spicy with a 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.640
 little bit of spicy 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:12.230
 and that's how shrimp are made 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.230
 good with chips
