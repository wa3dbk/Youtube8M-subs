 they are a little bit higher resolution 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:47.050
 little better done is because of that aspect 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:49.720

 with less resolution of some cases 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:06.220
 they import others not 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.630
 if there are certain applications and there is a 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:09.490
 little more than applications made for 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:11.949

 can put them in folders or leave as 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:47.300
 they are to create a folder they just have 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:48.810
 to hold up your finger on a 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:51.300
 application 

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:52.919
 and let's say they want to erase it 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:55.020
 they did not like it and they want to delete it 

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:57.240
 Holding your finger on it until it 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:58.710
 move applications like that and from there 

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:00.840
 you just have to click here in the 

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:03.030
 X and that will erase the 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:04.950
 application on it will ask you if 

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:08.080
 they are sure that they want telita 

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:10.599
 delete the application they will put ok 

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:12.430

00:06:10.599 --> 00:06:15.669
 folders simply have to hold 

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:17.469

00:06:15.669 --> 00:06:19.419
 move your finger and move it khadiga moxos 

00:06:17.469 --> 00:06:21.400
 before clicking would pose after another 

00:06:19.419 --> 00:06:23.949
 time if you want to create a folder 

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:26.979
 simply move the application over 

00:06:23.949 --> 00:06:29.169
 of the other until I show you this and 

00:06:26.979 --> 00:06:31.150
 after moving here and creating a 

00:06:29.169 --> 00:06:32.590
 folder the folder can change you from 

00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:34.090
 first name 

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:36.539
 if they want they were made by accident the 

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:39.189
 folder click on the folder 

00:06:36.539 --> 00:06:42.990
 encounter the application in any of the 

00:06:39.189 --> 00:06:44.610
 two and they take him out of the folder they let him go 

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:47.490
 can click through the folder 

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:50.940
 pull out the last application that is there 

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:52.950
 let him go over nothing and this is 

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:55.230
 more I'm going to move how things were 

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:56.880
 before that is all 

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:59.070
 so applications are downloaded like this or more 

00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:01.170
 less can be organized if they are already 

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:04.139
 organizing events simply have 

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:06.449

00:07:04.139 --> 00:07:07.759
 and everything is normal, they are not going to delhi 

00:07:06.449 --> 00:07:10.740
 nothing 

00:07:07.759 --> 00:07:12.960
 it's basically all they have to 

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:14.639
 know to download applications if 

00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:16.949
