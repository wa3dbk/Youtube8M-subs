00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
we can get to navigation and we've got

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.430 
we can get to navigation and we've got
some<00:00:44.520> preset<00:00:45.270> shortcuts<00:00:45.809> across<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.289> bottom

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.230 
adjust the crossover points and I can
just<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:38.009> slope<00:01:38.310> of<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.549> crossover<00:01:39.090> here

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
just the slope of the crossover here

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.850 
just the slope of the crossover here
it's<00:01:39.869> a<00:01:39.930> lot<00:01:40.140> of<00:01:40.259> things<00:01:40.409> that<00:01:40.500> you've<00:01:40.650> seen

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
it's a lot of things that you've seen

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.380 
it's a lot of things that you've seen
before<00:01:40.920> but<00:01:41.430> they're<00:01:41.579> just<00:01:41.700> so<00:01:41.850> much<00:01:42.030> cooler

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
before but they're just so much cooler

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.630 
before but they're just so much cooler
and<00:01:42.750> better<00:01:43.020> like<00:01:43.380> this<00:01:43.590> let's<00:01:44.340> take<00:01:44.460> a<00:01:44.490> look

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
and better like this let's take a look

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.760 
and better like this let's take a look
at<00:01:44.700> some<00:01:44.850> of<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:45.000> customization<00:01:45.560> I'll<00:01:46.560> go<00:01:46.710> to

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
at some of the customization I'll go to

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.160 
at some of the customization I'll go to
my<00:01:46.950> custom<00:01:47.340> backgrounds<00:01:47.939> here<00:01:48.119> here<00:01:48.899> I<00:01:48.930> can

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
my custom backgrounds here here I can

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.870 
my custom backgrounds here here I can
choose<00:01:49.350> different<00:01:49.799> motion<00:01:50.159> backgrounds<00:01:50.790> or

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
choose different motion backgrounds or

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.210 
choose different motion backgrounds or
still<00:01:51.180> images<00:01:51.360> if<00:01:51.780> I<00:01:51.899> want<00:01:52.140> or<00:01:52.829> maybe<00:01:53.070> a

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
still images if I want or maybe a

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.880 
still images if I want or maybe a
spectrum<00:01:54.060> analyzer<00:01:54.259> we'll<00:01:55.259> go<00:01:55.380> back<00:01:55.590> to<00:01:55.740> one

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
spectrum analyzer we'll go back to one

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:56.500 
spectrum analyzer we'll go back to one
of<00:01:55.920> my

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:56.510 
of my

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:59.000 
of my
motion<00:01:57.510> images<00:01:57.870> I<00:01:58.080> can<00:01:58.619> change<00:01:58.830> the

00:01:59.000 --> 00:01:59.010 
motion images I can change the

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:01.010 
motion images I can change the
illumination<00:01:59.670> across<00:02:00.390> the<00:02:00.570> bottom<00:02:00.750> of<00:02:00.960> the

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580 
screen here to a different color if I

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.270 
screen here to a different color if I
one<00:02:02.760> or<00:02:02.940> two<00:02:03.030> scan<00:02:03.299> through<00:02:03.570> colors<00:02:03.900> and<00:02:04.530> I<00:02:05.010> can

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
one or two scan through colors and I can

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.310 
one or two scan through colors and I can
