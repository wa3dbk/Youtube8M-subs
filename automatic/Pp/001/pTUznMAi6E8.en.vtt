00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.690 
it it's like doesn't make any sense well
you<00:02:10.539> know<00:02:10.630> when<00:02:10.869> I<00:02:10.899> was<00:02:11.110> doing<00:02:11.230> these<00:02:11.440> RBG's<00:02:11.980> it

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
you know when I was doing these RBG's it

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.110 
you know when I was doing these RBG's it
went<00:02:13.180> like<00:02:13.360> this

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
went like this

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.320 
went like this
so<00:02:14.870> we<00:02:15.019> take<00:02:15.890> like<00:02:16.129> two<00:02:16.310> hours<00:02:16.340> to<00:02:16.849> get<00:02:17.000> enough

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
so we take like two hours to get enough

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.000 
so we take like two hours to get enough
people<00:02:17.480> together<00:02:17.780> that<00:02:18.200> seem<00:02:18.560> like<00:02:18.590> a<00:02:18.830> pretty

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
people together that seem like a pretty

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.369 
people together that seem like a pretty
decent<00:02:19.220> composition<00:02:20.030> of<00:02:20.180> players<00:02:20.840> that<00:02:21.170> at

00:02:21.369 --> 00:02:21.379 
decent composition of players that at

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:23.589 
decent composition of players that at
one<00:02:21.709> point<00:02:21.920> in<00:02:22.069> time<00:02:22.099> had<00:02:22.580> some<00:02:22.879> kind<00:02:23.090> of<00:02:23.209> PFP

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:23.599 
one point in time had some kind of PFP

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:25.449 
one point in time had some kind of PFP
achievement<00:02:24.170> on<00:02:24.260> that<00:02:24.440> character<00:02:24.890> whether

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
achievement on that character whether

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:27.369 
achievement on that character whether
they<00:02:25.730> got<00:02:25.940> it<00:02:26.090> themselves<00:02:26.269> or<00:02:26.780> earned<00:02:27.019> it<00:02:27.200> or

00:02:27.369 --> 00:02:27.379 
they got it themselves or earned it or

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:28.089 
they got it themselves or earned it or
whatnot

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:28.099 
whatnot

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:30.520 
whatnot
obviously<00:02:28.819> you<00:02:29.150> can't<00:02:29.390> check<00:02:29.660> so<00:02:30.110> you

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
obviously you can't check so you

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.110 
obviously you can't check so you
probably<00:02:31.069> killed<00:02:31.280> with<00:02:31.519> some<00:02:31.700> pretty<00:02:31.910> bad

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
probably killed with some pretty bad

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.809 
probably killed with some pretty bad
players<00:02:32.450> every<00:02:32.750> now<00:02:32.900> and<00:02:33.049> then<00:02:33.170> but<00:02:33.440> you<00:02:33.620> know

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:33.819 
players every now and then but you know

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:36.130 
players every now and then but you know
yeah<00:02:34.819> what's<00:02:35.030> the<00:02:35.150> real<00:02:35.299> difference<00:02:35.450> so<00:02:35.930> when

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140

character but that over the years has

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:06.400 
character but that over the years has
diminished<00:05:04.460> so<00:05:04.820> far<00:05:05.090> in<00:05:05.810> a<00:05:05.930> game<00:05:06.110> like<00:05:06.260> World

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:06.410 
diminished so far in a game like World

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:07.570 
diminished so far in a game like World
of<00:05:06.500> Warcraft<00:05:06.919> that<00:05:07.130> it<00:05:07.250> doesn't<00:05:07.490> really

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:07.580 
of Warcraft that it doesn't really

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:11.140 
of Warcraft that it doesn't really
matter<00:05:07.880> that<00:05:08.090> much<00:05:08.240> at<00:05:08.539> this<00:05:08.690> point<00:05:10.150> obviously

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:11.150 
matter that much at this point obviously

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:14.170 
matter that much at this point obviously
if<00:05:11.780> you're<00:05:11.960> going<00:05:12.169> like<00:05:12.470> 1300<00:05:13.250> or<00:05:13.669> you're

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:14.180 
if you're going like 1300 or you're

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:16.090 
if you're going like 1300 or you're
gonna<00:05:14.270> see<00:05:14.570> a<00:05:14.600> difference<00:05:15.020> but<00:05:15.590> once<00:05:15.860> you<00:05:15.979> go

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:16.100 
gonna see a difference but once you go

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:18.610 
gonna see a difference but once you go
past<00:05:16.400> you<00:05:16.639> know<00:05:16.729> 1617<00:05:17.720> and<00:05:17.750> World<00:05:18.080> of<00:05:18.169> Warcraft

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:18.620 
past you know 1617 and World of Warcraft

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:21.670 
past you know 1617 and World of Warcraft
you<00:05:19.490> know<00:05:19.610> difference<00:05:19.970> is<00:05:20.090> very<00:05:20.240> small<00:05:20.470> it<00:05:21.470> can

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:21.680 
you know difference is very small it can

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:23.409 
you know difference is very small it can
be<00:05:21.710> significant<00:05:22.430> when<00:05:22.880> it<00:05:22.970> comes<00:05:23.150> to<00:05:23.270> like

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:23.419 
be significant when it comes to like

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:24.969 
be significant when it comes to like
using<00:05:23.660> things<00:05:23.990> that<00:05:24.110> clutch<00:05:24.440> times<00:05:24.770> and

00:05:24.969 --> 00:05:24.979 
using things that clutch times and

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:25.540 
using things that clutch times and
whatnot

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:25.550 
whatnot

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:30.909 
whatnot
but<00:05:26.289> overall<00:05:27.550> it's<00:05:28.550> really<00:05:28.849> not<00:05:29.830> you<00:05:30.830> know

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:30.919 
but overall it's really not you know

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:33.550 
but overall it's really not you know
when<00:05:31.070> I<00:05:31.130> played<00:05:31.370> back<00:05:31.580> in<00:05:31.610> in<00:05:32.090> Burning<00:05:32.539> Crusade
