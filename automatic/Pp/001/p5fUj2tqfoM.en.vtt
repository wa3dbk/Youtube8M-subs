uh if you're looking at the YouTube

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.300 
uh if you're looking at the YouTube
video<00:01:26.130> that<00:01:26.600> Capcom<00:01:27.600> Japan<00:01:27.990> just<00:01:28.170> put<00:01:28.409> out<00:01:28.530> its

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
video that Capcom Japan just put out its

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.700 
video that Capcom Japan just put out its
kind<00:01:30.030> of<00:01:30.119> divided<00:01:30.420> whether<00:01:30.780> people<00:01:30.990> like<00:01:31.680> it

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
kind of divided whether people like it

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.219 
kind of divided whether people like it
or<00:01:32.159> not<00:01:32.820> you're<00:01:33.299> seen<00:01:33.509> a<00:01:33.540> lot<00:01:33.720> of<00:01:33.750> thumbs<00:01:33.990> down

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.350 
or not you're seen a lot of thumbs down
but<00:01:34.500> I'm<00:01:34.680> guessing<00:01:35.130> those<00:01:35.400> are<00:01:35.460> probably<00:01:36.119> from

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
but I'm guessing those are probably from

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.300 
but I'm guessing those are probably from
the<00:01:36.630> purists<00:01:37.470> um<00:01:38.450> but<00:01:39.450> in<00:01:39.659> my<00:01:39.740> opinion<00:01:40.740> as<00:01:41.250> a

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
the purists um but in my opinion as a

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.960 
the purists um but in my opinion as a
spin-off<00:01:42.229> this<00:01:43.229> looks<00:01:43.649> pretty<00:01:44.610> cool

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970

I'm thinking if I we haven't seen any

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:42.969 
I'm thinking if I we haven't seen any
gameplay<00:03:42.019> though<00:03:42.349> and<00:03:42.500> that's<00:03:42.560> kind<00:03:42.829> of<00:03:42.889> what

00:03:42.969 --> 00:03:42.979 
gameplay though and that's kind of what

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:45.039 
gameplay though and that's kind of what
worries<00:03:43.340> me<00:03:43.370> and<00:03:43.819> I'm<00:03:44.209> wondering<00:03:44.239> if<00:03:44.900> it's

00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:45.049 
worries me and I'm wondering if it's

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:48.640 
worries me and I'm wondering if it's
going<00:03:45.229> to<00:03:45.319> be<00:03:45.470> more<00:03:45.680> of<00:03:45.889> a<00:03:46.540> turn-based<00:03:47.650> action

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
going to be more of a turn-based action

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:51.550 
going to be more of a turn-based action
RPG<00:03:49.189> maybe<00:03:49.489> something<00:03:49.909> strategy<00:03:50.569> wise<00:03:50.780> but

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:51.560 
RPG maybe something strategy wise but
