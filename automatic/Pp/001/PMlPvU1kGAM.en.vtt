to show you the next step okay so here

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.439 
to show you the next step okay so here
it<00:00:54.610> is<00:00:54.820> it<00:00:55.150> has<00:00:55.360> two<00:00:55.750> coats<00:00:56.080> of<00:00:56.350> the<00:00:57.449> megawatt

it is it has two coats of the megawatt
on<00:00:58.659> there<00:00:58.930> I<00:00:59.080> think<00:00:59.440> it<00:00:59.530> would<00:00:59.620> look<00:00:59.710> better

00:00:59.759 --> 00:00:59.769 
on there I think it would look better

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:01.740 
on there I think it would look better
over<00:01:00.220> obviously<00:01:00.760> a<00:01:00.820> real<00:01:01.150> nail<00:01:01.360> because<00:01:01.600> you

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:01.750 
over obviously a real nail because you

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:05.070 
over obviously a real nail because you
saw<00:01:01.960> a<00:01:02.199> little<00:01:02.379> hint<00:01:02.680> of<00:01:02.860> that<00:01:03.659> that<00:01:04.659> blues

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.080 
saw a little hint of that that blues

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.859 
saw a little hint of that that blues
poster<00:01:05.890> putty<00:01:06.010> underneath<00:01:06.490> but<00:01:06.850> you'll<00:01:07.780> get

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:07.869 
poster putty underneath but you'll get

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:09.690 
poster putty underneath but you'll get
the<00:01:08.020> idea<00:01:08.049> basically<00:01:08.530> i<00:01:09.040> forgot<00:01:09.520> to<00:01:09.549> mention

the idea basically i forgot to mention
is<00:01:10.360> a<00:01:11.200> special<00:01:11.830> request<00:01:12.220> for<00:01:13.090> glue<00:01:13.630> stick<00:01:13.930> 751

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
is a special request for glue stick 751

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.300 
is a special request for glue stick 751
she<00:01:16.659> had<00:01:16.810> asked<00:01:17.140> me<00:01:17.289> for<00:01:17.619> an<00:01:17.859> office
