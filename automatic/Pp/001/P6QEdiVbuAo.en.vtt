00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:05.760
 hello friends of the pcpe station I'm going to 

00:00:02.759 --> 00:00:09.030
 teach them how to convert our 

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:12.480
 ps x or playstation 1 games for 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.650
 our dear study plays what 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.980
 first thing we have to do is 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.849
 to download 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:17.849
 the program 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.320
 I'm going to leave the links I'm going to 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:24.230
 leave in the post so that anyone is 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.949
 clear from there and in this video leave the 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:26.949
 post link 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:33.080
 then unzipping files is not going to 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:35.120
 exit the folder ps x ps xperia 2.0 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:38.630
 inside it is not going to be a file in 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.320
 java that we are going to have to execute 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:42.860
 we execute it 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.330
 They liked to make the window like this 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:49.510
 what we have to do is choose 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:49.510
 our our game let's say 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.730
 I told myself I have saved 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:00.190
 in this case the team without all giving 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.190
 you kill 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:06.170
 remember that game has to be in 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:06.170
 bean format did ing 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.200
 Well, we select 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.100
 then what we have to do is give it 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.270
 the name of the game so that is the one that 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.470
 it will be that it will then appear 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.490
 our 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:22.390
 on our phone 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.390
 I'll put 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.210
 such 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:35.490
 well here what we are going to do is the 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.780
 description I by my choice do not put 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.350
 any 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.710
 then now let's choose where it says 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.710
 try to lead 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.509
 and I recommend that for each game that 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.640
 are going to convert put a different one 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.490
 for squares are going to get confused and do not know 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:56.470
 they mix the files 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.470
 for example I will put a 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.500
 8 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:11.100
 If you come here, let's call it Castilian 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.020
 where it says anal in a way that is what 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:16.500
 will allow is that we can play others 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.850
 connational games and finally the 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.560
 choice of you if you want is for 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.530
 put an icon to show the 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.900
 game 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:28.180
 remember that the icon has to be 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:30.640
 the dimensions of 174 by 174 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.860
 and it should be in PNG format 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.540
 if you want you can do it by pajÃ­n or 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.990
 by photoshop it is said let's go back more 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.990
 Quick 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.420
 and that after all this we can give 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.659
 where says convert 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:53.420
 when I finish that there will be a 

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:55.700
 I work a word saying just like 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.770
 that is made 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.480
 for 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:03.470
 for our game what we have to 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:06.080
 do is go to the output folder 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:08.230
 and take our game to form 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.230
 topical 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.930
 and inside the data folder between me 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.170
 output folder will show us the 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.170
 data 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.090
 that's we have these files we should 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:25.360
 cooperate 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:27.730
 remember that inside android folder 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:29.590
 data 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:33.150
 and he has sinned you want and what 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.150
 install files with a browser 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:37.370
 well I think that was all and I hope that 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:40.239
 it helps many in tutoring them 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:40.239
 we see in the next
