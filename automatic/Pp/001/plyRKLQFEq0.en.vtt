Joseph I could you tell us
a little<00:00:16.100> bit<00:00:16.219> about<00:00:17.350> your<00:00:18.350> inspiration

behind Susan's dance well the
inspiration<00:00:22.340> is<00:00:22.550> a<00:00:23.289> painting<00:00:24.289> by<00:00:24.439> Andre

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.880 
inspiration is a painting by Andre
Matisse<00:00:25.689> called<00:00:26.689> dance<00:00:27.050> too<00:00:27.470> and<00:00:28.450> my

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:29.890 
Matisse called dance too and my

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:32.139 
Matisse called dance too and my
interpretation<00:00:30.890> of<00:00:31.009> his<00:00:31.250> work<00:00:31.550> I've<00:00:31.820> taken

00:00:32.139 --> 00:00:32.149 
interpretation of his work I've taken

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:35.560 
interpretation of his work I've taken
his<00:00:32.509> two<00:00:32.930> dimensional<00:00:33.530> form<00:00:33.860> and<00:00:34.420> made<00:00:35.420> it

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:35.570 
his two dimensional form and made it

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.560 
his two dimensional form and made it
three<00:00:35.809> dimensional<00:00:36.350> for<00:00:37.219> me<00:00:37.370> the<00:00:37.640> idea<00:00:38.360> of<00:00:38.540> the

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:38.570 
three dimensional for me the idea of the

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:40.590 
three dimensional for me the idea of the
dance<00:00:38.930> and<00:00:39.200> the<00:00:39.320> movement<00:00:39.739> of<00:00:39.860> it<00:00:40.160> is<00:00:40.399> a

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:40.600 
dance and the movement of it is a

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:46.270 
dance and the movement of it is a
perfect<00:00:43.120> vehicle<00:00:44.120> for<00:00:44.390> me<00:00:44.690> to<00:00:44.719> convey<00:00:45.379> the

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:46.280 
perfect vehicle for me to convey the

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.970 
perfect vehicle for me to convey the
movement<00:00:46.760> of<00:00:46.879> string<00:00:47.329> theory<00:00:47.570> and<00:00:47.930> in<00:00:48.800> the

movement of string theory and in the

sculptures string theory that piece is

membrane is moving like waves and so

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:21.520 
membrane is moving like waves and so
this<00:01:19.340> conveys<00:01:19.790> its<00:01:20.000> Airy<00:01:20.659> it's<00:01:20.990> like<00:01:21.229> there's

this conveys its Airy it's like there's

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.770 
this conveys its Airy it's like there's
a<00:01:21.590> lot<00:01:21.710> of<00:01:21.770> motion<00:01:22.100> and<00:01:22.490> movement<00:01:23.299> I've

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
a lot of motion and movement I've

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.100 
a lot of motion and movement I've
changed<00:01:24.130> Matisse's<00:01:25.130> work<00:01:25.430> a<00:01:25.700> lot<00:01:26.030> and<00:01:26.360> that

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
changed Matisse's work a lot and that

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.140 
changed Matisse's work a lot and that
the<00:01:27.290> figure<00:01:27.620> in<00:01:27.830> the<00:01:27.860> background<00:01:28.549> in<00:01:28.909> this

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.150 
the figure in the background in this

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.420 
the figure in the background in this
painting<00:01:29.479> is<00:01:29.750> really<00:01:30.200> in<00:01:30.680> the<00:01:31.010> foreground

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:31.430

these two figures in this painting on in
the<00:01:33.680> background<00:01:34.270> which<00:01:35.270> also<00:01:35.540> means<00:01:35.869> changing

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 
the background which also means changing

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:42.550 
the background which also means changing
the<00:01:36.710> arms<00:01:37.780> right<00:01:38.780> now<00:01:38.810> the<00:01:39.080> work<00:01:39.409> is<00:01:41.560> maybe

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
the arms right now the work is maybe

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.280 
the arms right now the work is maybe
seventy-five<00:01:43.250> percent<00:01:43.490> complete<00:01:44.180> I<00:01:44.479> hope<00:01:45.110> to

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.290 
seventy-five percent complete I hope to

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.700 
seventy-five percent complete I hope to
be<00:01:45.409> finished<00:01:45.619> in<00:01:46.130> the<00:01:46.310> spring<00:01:47.200> perhaps<00:01:48.200> in<00:01:48.590> the

be finished in the spring perhaps in the

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.550 
be finished in the spring perhaps in the
summer<00:01:49.010> of<00:01:49.130> two<00:01:49.610> thousand<00:01:50.119> eleven<00:01:50.290> okay<00:01:51.290> and

hang correctly okay can you tell us how
this<00:02:38.200> is<00:02:38.470> hung<00:02:38.650> from<00:02:38.830> the<00:02:38.920> ceiling<00:02:39.010> here<00:02:39.630> I've

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
this is hung from the ceiling here I've

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:45.360 
this is hung from the ceiling here I've
made<00:02:40.960> a<00:02:41.460> scaffolding<00:02:42.460> system<00:02:42.670> and<00:02:44.220> with<00:02:45.220> the

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
made a scaffolding system and with the

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.390 
made a scaffolding system and with the
grid<00:02:45.610> up<00:02:45.880> there<00:02:46.120> that<00:02:46.270> allows<00:02:46.600> me<00:02:46.930> to<00:02:47.400> easily

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
grid up there that allows me to easily

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.320 
grid up there that allows me to easily
hang<00:02:49.390> it<00:02:49.570> from<00:02:49.750> any<00:02:50.850> gallery<00:02:51.850> and<00:02:52.180> museum

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
hang it from any gallery and museum

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:57.180 
hang it from any gallery and museum
ceiling<00:02:53.200> and<00:02:54.540> precisely<00:02:55.770> put<00:02:56.770> the<00:02:56.950> wire

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
ceiling and precisely put the wire

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.250 
ceiling and precisely put the wire
exactly<00:02:57.910> where<00:02:58.090> it<00:02:58.180> needs<00:02:58.210> to<00:02:58.510> be<00:02:58.630> put<00:02:58.990> right

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
exactly where it needs to be put right

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.680 
exactly where it needs to be put right
now<00:03:00.010> this<00:03:00.190> is<00:03:00.340> only<00:03:00.520> an<00:03:00.730> eight-foot<00:03:01.180> ceiling

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
now this is only an eight-foot ceiling

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.410 
now this is only an eight-foot ceiling
but<00:03:02.130> the<00:03:03.130> first<00:03:03.310> Museum<00:03:03.850> the<00:03:04.000> work<00:03:04.210> will<00:03:04.390> be

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
but the first Museum the work will be

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.690 
but the first Museum the work will be
hanging<00:03:04.810> and<00:03:05.140> has<00:03:05.290> got<00:03:05.500> ceiling<00:03:06.250> that's<00:03:06.430> over

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
hanging and has got ceiling that's over

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.310 
hanging and has got ceiling that's over
22<00:03:07.180> feet<00:03:09.180> so<00:03:10.180> it's<00:03:10.330> just<00:03:10.420> simply<00:03:10.870> a<00:03:10.930> matter<00:03:11.140> of

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.320 
22 feet so it's just simply a matter of

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.880 
22 feet so it's just simply a matter of
life<00:03:12.010> annuity<00:03:12.550> strings<00:03:12.880> right<00:03:13.480> and<00:03:13.870> can<00:03:14.860> you

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
life annuity strings right and can you

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:16.680 
life annuity strings right and can you
tell<00:03:15.130> us<00:03:15.160> a<00:03:15.340> little<00:03:15.430> bit<00:03:15.580> about<00:03:15.880> how<00:03:16.210> much<00:03:16.360> time

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
tell us a little bit about how much time

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.390 
tell us a little bit about how much time
goes<00:03:16.990> into<00:03:17.200> putting<00:03:17.650> a<00:03:17.830> piece<00:03:18.040> like<00:03:18.220> this

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
goes into putting a piece like this

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.950 
goes into putting a piece like this
together<00:03:21.000> I'll<00:03:22.000> in<00:03:22.270> strength<00:03:22.690> very

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:22.960 
together I'll in strength very

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:25.590 
together I'll in strength very
interestingly<00:03:23.590> enough<00:03:24.220> all<00:03:24.610> time<00:03:25.090> past

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 
interestingly enough all time past

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.390 
interestingly enough all time past
present<00:03:25.930> and<00:03:26.290> future<00:03:26.320> is<00:03:26.680> taking<00:03:27.220> place

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
present and future is taking place

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.980 
present and future is taking place
simultaneously<00:03:28.680> so<00:03:29.680> I<00:03:30.100> I<00:03:30.550> don't<00:03:31.180> think<00:03:31.690> about

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:31.990 
simultaneously so I I don't think about

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:34.130 
simultaneously so I I don't think about
working<00:03:32.530> on<00:03:32.770> something<00:03:33.100> in<00:03:33.430> terms<00:03:33.670> of<00:03:33.850> a

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
working on something in terms of a

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:41.040 
working on something in terms of a
nine-to-five<00:03:35.140> project<00:03:35.770> I<00:03:36.600> probably<00:03:37.600> have<00:03:38.170> 0<00:03:40.050> 6

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:41.050 
nine-to-five project I probably have 0 6

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:45.930 
nine-to-five project I probably have 0 6
months<00:03:41.470> or<00:03:41.740> more<00:03:42.730> into<00:03:43.150> it<00:03:43.180> already<00:03:43.720> and<00:03:44.940> it

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:45.940 
months or more into it already and it

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.170 
months or more into it already and it
may<00:03:46.330> take<00:03:46.630> me<00:03:47.310> certainly<00:03:48.310> less<00:03:48.580> than<00:03:48.880> six

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
may take me certainly less than six

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:52.500 
may take me certainly less than six
months<00:03:49.390> to<00:03:49.750> finish<00:03:50.260> the<00:03:50.560> rest<00:03:50.800> of<00:03:50.980> it<00:03:51.210> but<00:03:52.210> it's

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
months to finish the rest of it but it's

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:54.840 
months to finish the rest of it but it's
just<00:03:52.660> seven<00:03:53.590> in<00:03:53.710> the<00:03:53.800> morning<00:03:54.190> till<00:03:54.310> seven<00:03:54.700> at

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:54.850 
just seven in the morning till seven at

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:57.120 
just seven in the morning till seven at
night<00:03:54.880> seven<00:03:55.540> days<00:03:55.570> a<00:03:55.720> week<00:03:55.870> until<00:03:56.530> I<00:03:56.770> get<00:03:57.010> it

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.130 
night seven days a week until I get it

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.610 
night seven days a week until I get it
done<00:03:57.280> right<00:03:57.850> is<00:03:58.150> there<00:03:58.990> anything<00:03:59.200> else<00:03:59.470> you'd

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
done right is there anything else you'd

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:03.980 
done right is there anything else you'd
like<00:03:59.650> to<00:03:59.770> tell<00:03:59.890> us<00:04:00.070> about<00:04:00.280> the<00:04:00.550> sculpture<00:04:02.580> just

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:03.990 
like to tell us about the sculpture just

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:07.230 
like to tell us about the sculpture just
that<00:04:04.990> I'm<00:04:05.110> grateful<00:04:05.440> to<00:04:05.730> matisse<00:04:06.730> for<00:04:07.090> his

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:07.240 
that I'm grateful to matisse for his

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:12.870 
that I'm grateful to matisse for his
thought<00:04:07.480> process<00:04:08.520> and<00:04:10.020> I<00:04:11.430> think<00:04:12.430> it's<00:04:12.550> just

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:12.880 
thought process and I think it's just

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.180 
thought process and I think it's just
the<00:04:12.970> right<00:04:13.180> vehicle<00:04:13.480> to<00:04:13.840> say<00:04:14.050> exactly<00:04:14.590> what<00:04:15.160> i

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:15.190 
the right vehicle to say exactly what i

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:17.700 
the right vehicle to say exactly what i
want<00:04:15.490> to<00:04:15.580> say<00:04:15.640> with<00:04:15.910> this<00:04:16.030> culture<00:04:16.510> and<00:04:17.140> the

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720 
last question that i have is is this the

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.630 
last question that i have is is this the
last<00:04:19.960> in<00:04:20.170> your<00:04:20.200> series<00:04:20.650> of<00:04:20.890> string<00:04:21.160> theory<00:04:21.370> or

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:21.640 
last in your series of string theory or

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.430 
last in your series of string theory or
have<00:04:22.450> you<00:04:22.540> thought<00:04:22.690> about<00:04:22.750> doing<00:04:23.110> anything

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 
have you thought about doing anything

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:30.090 
have you thought about doing anything
else<00:04:24.510> I<00:04:26.100> have<00:04:27.100> other<00:04:27.400> ideas<00:04:27.610> but<00:04:28.540> I<00:04:29.040> kind<00:04:30.040> of

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:30.100 
else I have other ideas but I kind of

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:32.310 
else I have other ideas but I kind of
push<00:04:30.280> them<00:04:30.490> out<00:04:30.550> of<00:04:30.610> my<00:04:30.820> head<00:04:31.030> right<00:04:31.660> now<00:04:31.690> to

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:32.320 
push them out of my head right now to

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.570 
push them out of my head right now to
focus<00:04:32.740> on<00:04:32.920> this<00:04:33.130> right<00:04:33.400> the<00:04:34.000> upcoming
