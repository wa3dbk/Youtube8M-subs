00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
becomes the vertical grip it's what we

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.250 
becomes the vertical grip it's what we
call<00:02:41.549> a<00:02:41.580> battery<00:02:41.910> holder<00:02:42.269> right<00:02:42.450> it's<00:02:43.049> like

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
call a battery holder right it's like

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.900 
call a battery holder right it's like
what<00:02:43.440> these<00:02:43.620> are<00:02:43.860> is<00:02:43.980> just<00:02:44.310> that<00:02:44.459> it's<00:02:44.580> two

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
what these are is just that it's two

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.020 
what these are is just that it's two
parts<00:02:45.299> it<00:02:45.959> can<00:02:46.560> be<00:02:46.890> separated<00:02:47.280> it<00:02:47.519> can<00:02:47.670> be<00:02:47.760> used

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
parts it can be separated it can be used

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.330 
parts it can be separated it can be used
just<00:02:48.269> on<00:02:48.569> the<00:02:48.690> grip<00:02:48.870> alone<00:02:49.140> and<00:02:49.709> you<00:02:49.829> can<00:02:49.860> add

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
just on the grip alone and you can add

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.300 
just on the grip alone and you can add
