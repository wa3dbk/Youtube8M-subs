easy<00:01:14.970> is<00:01:15.299> how<00:01:16.229> thin<00:01:16.650> this<00:01:16.860> metal<00:01:17.280> is<00:01:17.369> here<00:01:17.790> and

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
easy is how thin this metal is here and

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.880 
easy is how thin this metal is here and
if<00:01:18.630> you<00:01:18.810> were<00:01:18.990> to<00:01:19.110> zoom<00:01:19.140> in<00:01:19.439> there<00:01:19.619> for<00:01:19.799> his

easily snapped out off this off this

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.460 
easily snapped out off this off this
back<00:01:38.970> plate<00:01:39.180> and<00:01:39.450> this<00:01:39.960> will<00:01:40.110> be<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.259> one<00:01:40.439> on

the on the front of the link you see so

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.719 
the on the front of the link you see so
by<00:01:42.780> that<00:01:42.930> being<00:01:43.200> snapped<00:01:43.470> up<00:01:43.740> there<00:01:44.009> it<00:01:44.399> means

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
by that being snapped up there it means

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.730 
by that being snapped up there it means
that<00:01:44.939> this<00:01:45.149> could<00:01:45.360> be<00:01:45.450> all<00:01:45.600> ripped<00:01:45.840> away<00:01:46.049> and

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
that this could be all ripped away and

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.330 
that this could be all ripped away and
of<00:01:46.829> course<00:01:47.009> ripping<00:01:47.700> that<00:01:47.850> away<00:01:48.259> therefore

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
of course ripping that away therefore

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.550 
of course ripping that away therefore
exposes<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.490> cylinder<00:01:50.970> more<00:01:51.540> so<00:01:52.110> it<00:01:52.259> can<00:01:52.439> be

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
exposes the cylinder more so it can be

handles in the UK and this is their
range<00:02:02.579> here<00:02:03.090> I've<00:02:04.130> built<00:02:05.130> a<00:02:05.310> handle<00:02:05.700> with<00:02:06.299> a

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
range here I've built a handle with a

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.529 
range here I've built a handle with a
view<00:02:06.600> of<00:02:06.630> to<00:02:06.840> try<00:02:07.020> and<00:02:07.140> combat<00:02:07.530> this<00:02:07.799> and<00:02:08.539> what

view of to try and combat this and what

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.089 
view of to try and combat this and what
they've<00:02:09.720> done<00:02:09.929> is<00:02:10.140> they've<00:02:10.349> this<00:02:10.679> is<00:02:10.830> the<00:02:10.920> one

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
they've done is they've this is the one

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.070 
they've done is they've this is the one
that<00:02:11.220> would<00:02:11.340> be<00:02:11.489> sitting<00:02:11.730> on

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
that would be sitting on

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.260 
that would be sitting on
outside<00:02:12.410> as<00:02:12.680> you<00:02:12.830> can<00:02:12.980> see<00:02:13.190> before<00:02:13.880> you<00:02:14.120> look

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 
outside as you can see before you look

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.810 
outside as you can see before you look
any<00:02:14.420> further<00:02:14.860> there's<00:02:15.860> a<00:02:15.920> massive<00:02:16.220> difference

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:16.820 
any further there's a massive difference

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.120 
any further there's a massive difference
in<00:02:17.000> our<00:02:17.150> how<00:02:17.330> thick<00:02:17.630> it<00:02:17.750> is<00:02:17.840> in<00:02:18.350> comparison<00:02:19.100> to

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
in our how thick it is in comparison to

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.420 
in our how thick it is in comparison to
the<00:02:19.490> traditional<00:02:19.880> style<00:02:20.480> animals<00:02:21.070> the<00:02:22.070> reason

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
the traditional style animals the reason

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.940 
the traditional style animals the reason
is<00:02:22.580> this<00:02:22.730> is<00:02:22.790> because<00:02:23.320> this<00:02:24.320> is<00:02:24.560> actually<00:02:24.890> a

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
is this is because this is actually a

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.350 
is this is because this is actually a
solid<00:02:25.190> piece<00:02:25.580> of<00:02:25.610> aluminium<00:02:26.560> milled<00:02:27.560> out<00:02:28.360> to

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:32.270 
to the shape that you see there now what

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:33.850 
to the shape that you see there now what
you<00:02:32.360> will<00:02:32.450> also<00:02:32.600> see<00:02:33.020> as<00:02:33.200> well<00:02:33.410> is<00:02:33.650> these

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
you will also see as well is these

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.060 
you will also see as well is these
fixing<00:02:34.340> points<00:02:34.730> that<00:02:34.880> are<00:02:35.290> much<00:02:36.290> bigger<00:02:36.530> much
