Institute of this presenting movement we

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:35.650 
Institute of this presenting movement we
are<00:02:34.130> generally<00:02:34.550> also<00:02:34.730> taught<00:02:35.180> in<00:02:35.480> our

are generally also taught in our
lectures<00:02:36.080> too<00:02:36.830> then<00:02:37.070> after<00:02:37.700> doing<00:02:37.970> ice

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
lectures too then after doing ice

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.870 
lectures too then after doing ice
representing<00:02:38.900> home<00:02:39.110> meant<00:02:39.410> to<00:02:39.980> go<00:02:40.100> into<00:02:40.489> a

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
systemic environment which then tends to

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.610 
systemic environment which then tends to
support<00:02:44.180> or<00:02:44.450> refute<00:02:44.600> some<00:02:45.170> of<00:02:45.230> the<00:02:45.380> things

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620

support or refute some of the things
which<00:02:45.800> are<00:02:45.920> going<00:02:46.250> on<00:02:46.430> in<00:02:47.000> our<00:02:47.300> minds<00:02:47.540> but<00:02:48.500> the

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
which are going on in our minds but the

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.620 
which are going on in our minds but the
end<00:02:48.800> of<00:02:48.950> all<00:02:49.130> of<00:02:49.160> these<00:02:49.459> things<00:02:49.850> we<00:02:50.120> made<00:02:50.420> that

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
end of all of these things we made that

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:53.680 
end of all of these things we made that
have<00:02:50.900> a<00:02:50.930> fair<00:02:51.470> idea<00:02:51.580> what<00:02:52.580> we<00:02:52.760> think<00:02:53.000> is<00:02:53.180> wrong

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
have a fair idea what we think is wrong

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:54.640 
have a fair idea what we think is wrong
with<00:02:53.930> this<00:02:54.050> patient

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
with this patient

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:56.979 
with this patient
then<00:02:55.400> we<00:02:55.790> think<00:02:56.090> that<00:02:56.269> this<00:02:56.420> is<00:02:56.600> something

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:56.989 
then we think that this is something

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:59.410 
then we think that this is something
that<00:02:57.019> is<00:02:57.290> a<00:02:57.320> result<00:02:57.680> of<00:02:57.950> neglect<00:02:58.700> or<00:02:59.030> something

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
that is a result of neglect or something

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.240 
that is a result of neglect or something
that<00:02:59.570> is<00:02:59.720> long-standing<00:03:00.260> or<00:03:00.650> something<00:03:01.070> that

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
that is long-standing or something that

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.080 
that is long-standing or something that
has<00:03:01.459> preceded<00:03:02.299> history<00:03:03.019> maybe<00:03:03.799> maybe<00:03:04.790> there's

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:05.090 
has preceded history maybe maybe there's

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.150 
has preceded history maybe maybe there's
something<00:03:05.299> in<00:03:05.540> his<00:03:05.660> family<00:03:06.080> history<00:03:06.230> so<00:03:07.010> we

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
something in his family history so we

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.580 
something in his family history so we
would<00:03:07.280> like<00:03:07.430> to<00:03:07.610> ask<00:03:07.760> our<00:03:08.090> patient<00:03:08.570> about<00:03:09.350> this

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
would like to ask our patient about this

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.770 
would like to ask our patient about this
past<00:03:09.890> medical<00:03:10.130> history<00:03:10.430> which<00:03:11.360> may<00:03:11.570> give

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
past medical history which may give

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.259 
past medical history which may give
point<00:03:12.049> tests<00:03:12.410> as<00:03:12.560> to<00:03:12.739> what<00:03:12.860> is<00:03:13.010> going<00:03:13.160> on<00:03:13.459> we

00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:14.269 
point tests as to what is going on we

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:16.090 
point tests as to what is going on we
also<00:03:14.480> find<00:03:15.049> out<00:03:15.230> for<00:03:15.410> this<00:03:15.560> past<00:03:15.860> medical

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:16.100 
also find out for this past medical

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.330 
also find out for this past medical
history<00:03:16.870> the<00:03:17.870> sequence<00:03:18.769> of<00:03:18.860> events<00:03:19.190> that<00:03:19.220> led

to the current condition you may also
find<00:03:21.950> out<00:03:22.160> on<00:03:22.340> the<00:03:22.459> patient<00:03:22.880> about<00:03:23.630> his<00:03:23.870> family

find out on the patient about his family
history<00:03:24.739> which<00:03:25.370> might<00:03:25.640> point<00:03:26.000> for<00:03:26.360> example<00:03:26.480> in

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
history which might point for example in

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:29.229 
history which might point for example in
a<00:03:27.500> sickle<00:03:27.860> cell<00:03:28.070> disease<00:03:28.100> patient<00:03:28.910> or<00:03:29.060> in<00:03:29.150> a

patient with breast cancer what may be
going<00:03:32.390> wrong<00:03:32.630> with<00:03:32.989> this<00:03:33.110> efficient

going wrong with this efficient

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:36.660 
going wrong with this efficient
having<00:03:34.900> said<00:03:35.140> all<00:03:35.170> of<00:03:35.290> these<00:03:35.620> with<00:03:36.250> all<00:03:36.490> of

having said all of these with all of
what<00:03:36.910> is<00:03:36.940> big<00:03:37.270> you<00:03:37.420> won't<00:03:37.720> be<00:03:37.870> drug-induced

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:38.520 
what is big you won't be drug-induced

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:41.130 
what is big you won't be drug-induced
for<00:03:39.520> example<00:03:40.030> a<00:03:40.090> patient<00:03:40.270> with<00:03:40.660> a<00:03:40.780> severe

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
for example a patient with a severe

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:42.960 
for example a patient with a severe
gastric<00:03:41.800> pain<00:03:42.010> may<00:03:42.280> have<00:03:42.430> been<00:03:42.610> taking

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
gastric pain may have been taking

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:45.420 
gastric pain may have been taking
non-steroidal<00:03:44.130> anti-inflammatory<00:03:45.130> drugs

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:47.910 
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
and<00:03:46.030> we<00:03:46.180> may<00:03:46.360> get<00:03:46.420> this<00:03:46.720> history<00:03:47.110> from<00:03:47.740> the

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920 
and we may get this history from the

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:49.680 
and we may get this history from the
drugs<00:03:48.190> which<00:03:48.580> the<00:03:48.730> patient<00:03:49.090> may<00:03:49.300> have<00:03:49.330> been

drugs which the patient may have been

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.190 
drugs which the patient may have been
taking<00:03:50.940> in<00:03:51.940> addition<00:03:52.360> to<00:03:52.540> all<00:03:52.660> of<00:03:52.690> this<00:03:52.990> is

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:53.200 
taking in addition to all of this is

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.590 
taking in addition to all of this is
quite<00:03:53.560> important<00:03:54.190> to<00:03:54.460> make<00:03:54.910> sure<00:03:54.940> we<00:03:55.210> more

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:55.600 
quite important to make sure we more

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.450 
quite important to make sure we more
about<00:03:55.780> the<00:03:55.930> social<00:03:56.170> standing<00:03:56.590> of<00:03:56.890> the<00:03:56.950> patient

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:57.460 
about the social standing of the patient

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:00.510 
about the social standing of the patient
the<00:03:57.760> work<00:03:58.390> the<00:03:58.600> patient's<00:03:59.170> does<00:03:59.380> cause<00:04:00.220> for

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:00.520 
the work the patient's does cause for

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:02.520 
the work the patient's does cause for
example<00:04:00.790> you<00:04:01.090> may<00:04:01.240> find<00:04:01.270> an<00:04:01.660> anemic<00:04:02.080> patient

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
example you may find an anemic patient

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:04.170 
example you may find an anemic patient
who<00:04:02.740> is<00:04:02.770> a<00:04:02.980> farmer<00:04:03.370> who's<00:04:03.580> been<00:04:03.790> walking

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
who is a farmer who's been walking

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.870 
who is a farmer who's been walking
barefooted<00:04:04.630> and<00:04:05.350> has<00:04:05.560> developed<00:04:06.040> some<00:04:06.610> worm

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:06.880 
barefooted and has developed some worm

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:08.930 
barefooted and has developed some worm
infestation<00:04:07.690> which<00:04:07.990> is<00:04:08.170> giving<00:04:08.440> him<00:04:08.590> a<00:04:08.680> ninya

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
infestation which is giving him a ninya

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.370

so<00:04:09.940> we<00:04:10.180> put<00:04:10.360> all<00:04:10.540> of<00:04:10.570> these<00:04:10.810> things<00:04:10.870> together

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:11.380 
so we put all of these things together

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:14.790 
so we put all of these things together
and<00:04:12.130> we<00:04:12.370> make<00:04:12.900> subjective<00:04:13.900> diagnosis<00:04:14.560> which

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:14.800 
and we make subjective diagnosis which

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.140 
and we make subjective diagnosis which
we<00:04:14.980> tend<00:04:15.250> to<00:04:15.730> call<00:04:16.180> a<00:04:16.450> nest<00:04:16.690> of<00:04:16.870> differentials

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
we tend to call a nest of differentials

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.490 
we tend to call a nest of differentials
having<00:04:19.150> made<00:04:19.360> this<00:04:19.540> list<00:04:19.780> of<00:04:19.960> differential

diagnoses will then proceed to examine

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:25.800 
diagnoses will then proceed to examine
the<00:04:23.560> patient<00:04:24.010> the<00:04:24.670> purpose<00:04:25.000> of<00:04:25.180> the<00:04:25.300> series<00:04:25.660> of
