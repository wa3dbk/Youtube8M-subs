hi I'm dr. H from magic experiments with

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:05.480 
hi I'm dr. H from magic experiments with
science<00:00:04.259> should<00:00:04.440> be<00:00:04.500> available<00:00:05.009> to<00:00:05.160> everyone

Stephanie today we're going to do an

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.410 
Stephanie today we're going to do an
experiment<00:00:13.559> in<00:00:13.679> the<00:00:13.799> environment<00:00:14.549> okay<00:00:14.849> but

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:15.420 
experiment in the environment okay but

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.210 
experiment in the environment okay but
we're<00:00:15.719> going<00:00:15.809> to<00:00:15.900> show<00:00:16.170> the<00:00:16.410> principles<00:00:17.039> of

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
we're going to show the principles of

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.359 
we're going to show the principles of
how<00:00:17.789> why<00:00:18.180> you<00:00:18.240> brush<00:00:18.690> our<00:00:18.900> teeth<00:00:18.930> okay<00:00:19.680> a<00:00:19.859> lot

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
how why you brush our teeth okay a lot

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.460 
how why you brush our teeth okay a lot
of<00:00:20.460> us<00:00:20.670> know<00:00:20.939> that<00:00:20.970> the<00:00:21.210> environment<00:00:21.660> is<00:00:22.230> the

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
of us know that the environment is the

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.769 
of us know that the environment is the
trees<00:00:22.800> our<00:00:23.160> surroundings<00:00:23.939> but<00:00:24.480> a<00:00:24.510> lot<00:00:24.750> of

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
trees our surroundings but a lot of

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.599 
trees our surroundings but a lot of
people<00:00:24.990> forget<00:00:25.350> that<00:00:25.710> we<00:00:26.010> are<00:00:26.099> part<00:00:26.400> of<00:00:26.490> the

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
people forget that we are part of the

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.220 
people forget that we are part of the
environment<00:00:27.240> and<00:00:27.390> we<00:00:27.630> have<00:00:27.750> to<00:00:27.840> show<00:00:27.990> how<00:00:28.170> we

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
environment and we have to show how we

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.320 
environment and we have to show how we
take<00:00:28.529> care<00:00:28.769> of<00:00:28.859> ourselves<00:00:29.010> so<00:00:29.670> I'm<00:00:30.090> going<00:00:30.269> to

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
take care of ourselves so I'm going to

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.319 
take care of ourselves so I'm going to
show<00:00:30.510> an<00:00:31.080> experiment<00:00:31.830> using<00:00:32.309> an<00:00:32.640> egg<00:00:32.790> and<00:00:33.120> how

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
show an experiment using an egg and how

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.380 
show an experiment using an egg and how
it's<00:00:33.780> very<00:00:34.200> similar<00:00:34.770> to<00:00:34.950> our<00:00:35.130> teeth<00:00:35.430> okay<00:00:35.910> so

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
it's very similar to our teeth okay so

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.240 
it's very similar to our teeth okay so
what<00:00:36.570> I<00:00:36.600> have<00:00:36.840> is<00:00:37.110> I<00:00:37.140> have<00:00:37.410> eggs<00:00:37.680> and<00:00:37.890> I<00:00:38.010> put

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
what I have is I have eggs and I put

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.950 
what I have is I have eggs and I put
them<00:00:38.370> into<00:00:38.579> all<00:00:38.730> different<00:00:39.120> types<00:00:39.300> of<00:00:39.510> liquids

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
them into all different types of liquids

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.190 
them into all different types of liquids
so<00:00:40.530> here<00:00:41.010> is<00:00:41.250> an<00:00:41.399> example<00:00:41.489> of<00:00:42.059> an<00:00:42.210> egg<00:00:42.390> okay

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
so here is an example of an egg okay

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.709 
so here is an example of an egg okay
it's<00:00:43.739> a<00:00:43.829> control<00:00:44.219> egg<00:00:44.579> okay<00:00:45.090> we<00:00:45.329> put<00:00:45.510> it<00:00:45.629> in

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
it's a control egg okay we put it in

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.619 
it's a control egg okay we put it in
water<00:00:46.020> and<00:00:46.710> you<00:00:46.800> can<00:00:46.950> see<00:00:46.980> it<00:00:47.160> stays<00:00:47.370> white<00:00:47.760> now

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
water and you can see it stays white now

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.799 
water and you can see it stays white now
if<00:00:48.989> I<00:00:49.140> put<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.530> egg<00:00:49.710> into<00:00:50.039> soda<00:00:50.489> fruit<00:00:51.449> punch

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
if I put the egg into soda fruit punch

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.119 
if I put the egg into soda fruit punch
tea<00:00:52.739> or<00:00:53.460> coffee<00:00:53.879> you<00:00:54.690> can<00:00:54.870> actually<00:00:55.199> see<00:00:55.800> that

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
tea or coffee you can actually see that

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.160 
tea or coffee you can actually see that
the<00:00:56.309> eggs<00:00:56.520> take<00:00:57.000> on<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.390> color<00:00:57.600> of<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:57.960> liquid

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
the eggs take on the color of the liquid

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.860 
the eggs take on the color of the liquid
okay<00:00:58.620> that's<00:00:59.399> very<00:00:59.520> similar<00:01:00.000> to<00:01:00.300> our<00:01:00.390> teeth

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
okay that's very similar to our teeth

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.009 
okay that's very similar to our teeth
now<00:01:01.680> what<00:01:02.399> I'm<00:01:02.550> going<00:01:02.879> to<00:01:02.910> do<00:01:03.149> is<00:01:03.420> I'm<00:01:03.780> going<00:01:03.930> to

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
now what I'm going to do is I'm going to

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.170 
now what I'm going to do is I'm going to
take<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.530> teeth<00:01:04.799> to<00:01:05.159> take<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.670> tooth<00:01:05.850> well

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.280 
really the egg and I'm gonna ask
Stephanie<00:01:08.729> if<00:01:09.060> she<00:01:09.299> wouldn't<00:01:09.600> mind<00:01:09.810> to<00:01:10.020> brush

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
from the tooth I'm gonna explain a

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.200 
from the tooth I'm gonna explain a
little<00:01:21.600> bit<00:01:21.840> about<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.229> science<00:01:22.500> okay<00:01:23.400> now

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
little bit about the science okay now

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.859 
little bit about the science okay now
our<00:01:24.600> tooth<00:01:25.500> and<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:26.549> egg<00:01:26.700> are<00:01:27.030> very<00:01:27.479> similar

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
our tooth and the egg are very similar

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.850 
our tooth and the egg are very similar
they're<00:01:28.409> made<00:01:28.680> of<00:01:29.299> calcium<00:01:30.299> or<00:01:30.860> phosphonates

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
they're made of calcium or phosphonates

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.840 
they're made of calcium or phosphonates
different<00:01:32.369> types<00:01:32.579> of<00:01:32.759> salts<00:01:33.240> okay<00:01:33.750> and<00:01:34.850> when

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
different types of salts okay and when

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.300 
different types of salts okay and when
we<00:01:36.240> put<00:01:36.509> it<00:01:36.630> into<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:37.049> liquid<00:01:37.290> it<00:01:37.740> takes<00:01:38.009> on

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
we put it into the liquid it takes on

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.940 
we put it into the liquid it takes on
that<00:01:38.610> color<00:01:38.970> it<00:01:39.270> gets<00:01:39.450> stained<00:01:39.840> we<00:01:40.140> say<00:01:40.380> okay

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
that color it gets stained we say okay

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.929 
that color it gets stained we say okay
now<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:42.329> toothpaste<00:01:43.049> that<00:01:43.229> we<00:01:43.500> use<00:01:43.770> okay<00:01:44.670> is

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
now the toothpaste that we use okay is

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.539 
now the toothpaste that we use okay is
an<00:01:45.390> abrasive<00:01:45.750> mean<00:01:46.290> it's<00:01:46.439> very<00:01:46.619> rough<00:01:46.920> and

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
an abrasive mean it's very rough and

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.249 
an abrasive mean it's very rough and
what<00:01:47.820> it<00:01:47.939> does<00:01:48.149> is<00:01:48.390> when<00:01:48.540> you're<00:01:48.720> scrubbing

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
what it does is when you're scrubbing

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.020 
what it does is when you're scrubbing
your<00:01:49.380> tooth<00:01:49.649> you<00:01:49.950> actually<00:01:50.430> try<00:01:50.640> to<00:01:50.670> remove

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
your tooth you actually try to remove

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.740 
your tooth you actually try to remove
the<00:01:51.240> color<00:01:51.479> okay<00:01:51.990> so<00:01:52.850> I'm<00:01:53.850> going<00:01:54.119> to<00:01:54.240> put<00:01:54.479> a

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
the color okay so I'm going to put a

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.999 
the color okay so I'm going to put a
Stephanie<00:01:55.380> to<00:01:55.470> put<00:01:55.710> it<00:01:55.829> into<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.159> water<00:01:56.399> okay

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:58.009 
Stephanie to put it into the water okay

or<00:02:35.370> the<00:02:35.580> egg<00:02:36.000> and<00:02:36.240> see<00:02:37.020> how<00:02:37.230> it<00:02:37.410> can<00:02:37.590> take<00:02:37.950> the

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
or the egg and see how it can take the

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.460 
or the egg and see how it can take the
color<00:02:38.340> off<00:02:38.580> okay<00:02:39.120> so<00:02:39.570> let's<00:02:39.780> take<00:02:39.990> a<00:02:40.050> look<00:02:40.320> at

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
color off okay so let's take a look at

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.340 
color off okay so let's take a look at
our<00:02:40.590> egg<00:02:40.830> and<00:02:41.100> see<00:02:41.520> what<00:02:41.670> happened<00:02:42.150> so<00:02:43.140> there

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
our egg and see what happened so there

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:44.000 
our egg and see what happened so there
we<00:02:43.560> go

we go

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.160 
we go
we<00:02:44.160> actually<00:02:44.340> whitened<00:02:45.090> out<00:02:45.270> the<00:02:45.540> egg<00:02:45.690> we

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
we actually whitened out the egg we

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:47.930 
we actually whitened out the egg we
didn't<00:02:46.380> get<00:02:46.470> it<00:02:46.590> perfectly<00:02:47.160> clean<00:02:47.490> okay

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
didn't get it perfectly clean okay

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.390 
didn't get it perfectly clean okay
because<00:02:48.120> I<00:02:48.330> let<00:02:48.480> it<00:02:48.600> stain<00:02:48.840> overnight<00:02:49.410> but<00:02:50.280> if

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400

clean<00:02:51.989> the<00:02:52.020> air<00:02:52.290> yet<00:02:52.530> so<00:02:53.160> this<00:02:53.310> is<00:02:53.400> a<00:02:53.459> great

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
clean the air yet so this is a great

clean the air yet so this is a great
example<00:02:54.000> of<00:02:54.600> a<00:02:54.690> science<00:02:55.170> experiment<00:02:55.739> that<00:02:55.770> you

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
example of a science experiment that you

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.220 
example of a science experiment that you
could<00:02:56.130> do<00:02:56.250> at<00:02:56.400> home<00:02:56.640> take<00:02:57.420> different<00:02:57.660> liquids

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
could do at home take different liquids

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.680 
could do at home take different liquids
try<00:02:58.530> to<00:02:58.590> see<00:02:58.890> how<00:02:59.070> long<00:02:59.370> it<00:03:00.090> takes<00:03:00.420> actually

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
try to see how long it takes actually

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.140 
try to see how long it takes actually
stain<00:03:01.230> see<00:03:01.920> different<00:03:02.310> toothpastes<00:03:02.910> and<00:03:02.940> see

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
how it works if you're interested why

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.420 
how it works if you're interested why
