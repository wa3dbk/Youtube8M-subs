00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.490
 Hello, I want to show you how I am doing 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:09.200
 corners 

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:12.780
 from plastic panels i just have them 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:20.450
 bends it turns a beautiful pipe 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:24.010
 close the rounded corner 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:24.010
 nice and practical 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.789
 here today 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.779
 currencies 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:39.330
 I show you the bark 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.510
 small 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.600
 turned out very nice 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:56.070
 I like 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:58.280
 I decided to share with you the secret of the rear 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.280
 corner 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.780
 pvc panels 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:22.930
 This is done in the following way. 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:27.260
 take the tape measure into pieces of the panel and measure it 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:30.740
 approximate approximate distance 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:33.970
 size up to the angle from the panel previous to 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.970
 the same stands to the corner 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:51.840
 put the label draw the line with a pencil and 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:54.600
 Now cut with a sharp knife from the line 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:02:02.430
 one and a half to two centimeters from the line to the right and 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:06.390
 left, set aside an angle of 45 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:10.160
 degrees and strongly not sink him a little 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.160
 do not cut through the panel completely 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:41.030
 we bend here we have 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:43.459
 The rounded corner is 90 degrees beautiful and 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:46.330
 practical no corners they sweat 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:03:00.049
 no gaps fall off 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:03:02.959
 rounded beautiful goal but I advise 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:08.569
 you also round the corners on the Karabakh on 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:14.360
 cornering is very beautiful 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:18.579
 the main thing is practical and beautiful thanks to all 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.579
 for watching bye
