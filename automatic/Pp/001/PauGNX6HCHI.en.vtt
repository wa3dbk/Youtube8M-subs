00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
access to multiple desktop it's a bit

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.620

similar<00:02:07.200> to<00:02:07.410> spaces<00:02:08.119> previously<00:02:09.119> however<00:02:09.600> I

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
similar to spaces previously however I

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:11.720 
similar to spaces previously however I
think<00:02:09.899> this<00:02:10.080> one<00:02:10.259> is<00:02:10.290> more<00:02:10.619> versatile<00:02:11.490> and

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
think this one is more versatile and

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.900 
think this one is more versatile and
more<00:02:11.850> user<00:02:12.240> friendly<00:02:13.730> obviously<00:02:14.730> in<00:02:14.820> the<00:02:14.880> past

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
more user friendly obviously in the past

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
year 2011 we've only seen the difference

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.430 
year 2011 we've only seen the difference
in<00:02:17.070> the<00:02:17.160> specs<00:02:17.490> not<00:02:18.060> the<00:02:18.209> design<00:02:18.540> hopefully

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
in the specs not the design hopefully
