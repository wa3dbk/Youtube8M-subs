 inconveniences in the vicinity of 

00:00:07.439 --> 00:00:13.710
 the station 

00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:15.990
 11 we reiterate there is a train crashed against 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.090
 the platform no no it had not been like 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.670
 means such that it collided with another 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:24.960
 formation did not touch against the platform of the 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:27.000
 header 11 of the railway branch in 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.070
 this time the latest information 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.410
 that we are receiving that are some 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.170
 the machinist of 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.870
 this formation is still stuck in 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.539
 the number one wagon of this formation 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.629
 meanwhile it is estimated that the quantity 

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:46.559
 of injured by this accident 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:49.109

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:52.289
 this moment being assisted by the 

00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:54.089
 processing the drama the transit process 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.059
 for what is pueyrredón avenue 

00:00:54.089 --> 00:01:00.359
 very complicated 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:02.670
 we suggest avoiding the area of 11 in the first 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.470
 place to facilitate the displacement 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.110
 of the ambulances 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:10.180
 transit is very complicated in the 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:13.960
 avenue by region we reiterate between 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:17.230
 bartolomé miter and sarmiento so 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:19.570
 well really this was a few 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:23.410
 minutes and you're still working on 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:24.880
 the place in order to attend the great 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:29.020
 number of people injured but 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:33.190
 attention the service is being done 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:35.020
 with a reduced travel surely 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:37.510
 they will use the station from 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:40.090
 trained as a header to get to 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:42.790
 brown so well this is really 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:46.240
 an accident very very strong that in this 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:49.240
 moment you are trying to attend 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:52.330
 fully with the same staff and 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:54.640
 firefighters the rest of the services are 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:58.840
 running an accident on schedule 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:02.710
 northern access height 197 is a car and a 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:05.470
 micro are bringing the fast lane of 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:07.850
 the pan-American highway hand to capital 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:10.580
 at the height of 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:13.100
 of route 197 but it really is all 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:15.680
 thanks to the part that say silvia that 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.239
 It was during the peak time of the train not 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.600
 a formation that would come with with 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:22.760
 hundreds of passengers we realized in 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:25.520
 it is good the relation that made lucero 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.560
 that it was against the platform that collided 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.810
 against the brake he said he has the platform 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.310
 just in the terminal and not against 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.290
 another formation that was the information 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.970
 initial that we all had but is 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.280
 working at station 11 our 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:39.319
 compañera laura mallorquin laura which is 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.010
 the situation that is experienced at this moment 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:42.010
 from there we heard you 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:49.710
 at station 11 where this occurred 

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:53.840
 accident we hear you laura 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:53.840
 we are like that in the direction 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.140
 A) Yes 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:20.790
 because in the place that we were great 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.680
 number of injured and also in 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.560
 hospitals throw some victims 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:28.320
 fatal has its moment the official headquarters 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.780
 is that it revives arias meters of the port 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.890
 as working in the place they are 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.140
 trying all the professions 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:36.060
 trying to establish a kind of 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.890
 order of who performed for the belief and 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.020
 those that are missing but 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:41.520
 of the volunteer firefighters and 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:44.070
 of the federal police of course the 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:46.860
 Valley of the utility is available in return 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:48.780
 to move quickly when caresses 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:53.490
 just wanted 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:56.880
 is seriously seriously injured 

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:59.459
 we're trying to kind of go from 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:02.160
 our side to see and have a 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:03.780
 perspective better solution and ostrava 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:05.500
 because he's doing a sermon now 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:10.920
 elite 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:10.920
 because one of the knee formations 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:25.080
 towards the west the obligations of 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:27.850
 waterfall determines that only the station 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:31.420
 Mind reading is in between must 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:35.560
 with an electric chainsaw try to 

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:38.710
 trying to cut large part of the 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:42.550
 body for having you adults and you 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:45.910
 they would find people trapped between 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:47.680
 the irons twisted dramatically 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:51.040
 we are seeing how the members of the 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:53.190
 singing dealer from our children 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:55.180
 as I just told you Alejandro 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:58.419
 artifices is so special says 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:00.720
 really do not have very bad return but 

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:02.590
 the army attack what happens here 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:05.860
 is abiding by theorizations 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:07.760
 interior of the music wagons that 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:11.690
 they find trapped 

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:13.760
 previously injured we pretend that 

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:16.760
 they are working in the place they are 

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:21.860
 going to the area and you are mind 

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:23.990
 between 10 and 15 can ambulance in this 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:26.060
 way down really is not you 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:29.030
 coping with the operation in this 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:32.870
 moment in this place because if before the 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:34.280
 a lot of had in helping the 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:36.110
 work we hear you perfectly 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:38.540
 we stop working at this time 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:41.240
 quiet of shock this happened does 

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:42.980
 instants is on the other hand in a 

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:45.710
 We are with you again the minute

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:50.480
 our vision companions 7 that 

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:52.460
 peak schedule we said not any 

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:55.220
 accident in this schedule that involves 

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:57.080
 a train means hundreds of people 

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:59.660
 involved and to take into account for 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:02.540
 all those who have the 

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:04.220
 service also the header to the happened 

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:06.440
 this accident has moved from 11 to 

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:08.390
 horse therefore the service is 

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:10.310
 will lend that way once it's 

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:12.380
 we also tell people that they do not 

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:14.780
 approach to want to look or to 

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:16.460
 want to see what happens because it's in this 

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:17.780

 working where they have to work 

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:21.530
 quiet the authorities where 

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:23.300
 transit must be released 

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:24.770
 in case you have to move someone injured 

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:27.110
 that are of some seriousness 

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:29.560
 so it will be time to leave
