an<00:01:30.180> animation<00:01:30.659> based<00:01:31.020> game<00:01:31.500> because<00:01:32.220> it<00:01:32.490> feels

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
an animation based game because it feels

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.160 
an animation based game because it feels
like<00:01:32.909> you<00:01:33.030> have<00:01:33.060> no<00:01:33.329> control<00:01:33.689> over<00:01:33.810> your

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170

player right every time you get the ball
if<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:36.930> person<00:01:37.320> comes<00:01:37.470> over<00:01:37.740> to<00:01:37.890> you<00:01:38.009> you<00:01:38.130> just

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
if the person comes over to you you just

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:39.710 
if the person comes over to you you just
pick<00:01:38.549> up<00:01:38.579> your<00:01:38.729> dribble<00:01:39.210> and<00:01:39.360> shit<00:01:39.540> like<00:01:39.570> that

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
pick up your dribble and shit like that

animation animation based games are bad

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.370 
animation animation based games are bad
because<00:01:44.520> you<00:01:45.030> can't<00:01:45.329> control<00:01:45.810> your<00:01:46.020> player

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
because you can't control your player

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.710 
because you can't control your player
that's<00:01:46.680> what<00:01:46.829> i<00:01:46.860> don't<00:01:47.250> like<00:01:47.340> about<00:01:47.790> 2k<00:01:48.600> the

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
fact that it's an animation basically

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.429 
fact that it's an animation basically
almost<00:01:50.670> everything<00:01:51.420> it's<00:01:51.899> a<00:01:52.020> chain<00:01:52.409> of

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
almost everything it's a chain of
