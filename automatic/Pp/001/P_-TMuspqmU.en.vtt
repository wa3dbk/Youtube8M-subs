00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:11.730
 he is the new audi r8 and so on 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.340
 warmly welcome 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.650
 on the vw group evening the second 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.240
 generation of supersports sees 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.619
 bit like itt the two years 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.450
 was unemployed and all the time in the 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.890
 muckibude has not been from 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:24.060
 me the saying but I found him funny 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.619
 has a user written with us 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.779
 but not quite true if you are honest 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.960
 the car is really a hammer 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.570
 one recognizes the lamborghini the hurricane 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.230
 and the nice thing about this car is 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.899
 in fact he has that 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.739
 respect distance to huracan easy 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:41.550
 given up 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:44.970
 audi has the new r8 v10 plus 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:47.340
 this version is actually 610 here 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:49.790
 planted in the horse that is one 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.790
 real bid 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.200
 if you look at the interior of the r8 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.600
 you just have to look at it because it has 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.979
 audi damn much done right in the 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.780
 This is the more beautiful one 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.520
 lamborghini huracan we know that 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.400
 virtual cockpit what lies here in front of me 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.800
 from the audi tt also this knob where 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.450
 then finally show the air conditioning 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.070
 we know that too 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.840
 but that just looks damn 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.550
 otherwise sexy is the cockpit 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.440
 very nicely built around the driver 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:26.610
 if you press on it you are in 3 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:27.509
 2 seconds from zero to one hundred 330 km h 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.130
 great friends 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.119
 I really do not want to anymore 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.119
 get out if i'm honest 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:52.170
 one or two future r8 customers 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.360
 Maybe it could say so 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.770
 intentionally disturb that 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.340
 the dare here a fixed one 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:01.350
 there is a spoiler on the back 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.400
 a basic version of this game has 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.000
 in fact only the plus version 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:07.950
 the basic version only has 540 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.759
 ps I think that's more than that 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.830
 sufficient 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.360
 but in this basic version there are 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.220
 an extendable spoiler 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.530
 you can already here that indicated 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.240
 then you have the fixed one 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:22.130
 spoiler just not on it and I believe 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.130
 With 540 ps you can also handle it very well 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.849
