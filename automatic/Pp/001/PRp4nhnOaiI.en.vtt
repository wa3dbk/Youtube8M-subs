00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:13.299 
phone how to connect to this individual

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:15.529 
phone how to connect to this individual
machine<00:01:13.600> or<00:01:13.749> that<00:01:14.049> individual<00:01:14.649> machine<00:01:15.039> on

00:01:15.529 --> 00:01:15.539 
machine or that individual machine on

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:18.359 
machine or that individual machine on
Wi-Fi<00:01:16.539> so<00:01:17.049> now<00:01:17.289> that<00:01:17.350> it's<00:01:17.619> connected<00:01:18.100> I<00:01:18.159> can

00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:18.369 
Wi-Fi so now that it's connected I can

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:20.730 
Wi-Fi so now that it's connected I can
walk<00:01:18.819> away<00:01:19.119> from<00:01:19.420> the<00:01:19.569> device<00:01:19.689> and<00:01:20.170> still

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:20.740 
walk away from the device and still

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.739 
walk away from the device and still
print<00:01:21.039> to<00:01:21.249> it<00:01:21.280> so<00:01:22.119> I've<00:01:22.569> got<00:01:23.140> the<00:01:24.090> app<00:01:25.090> loaded
