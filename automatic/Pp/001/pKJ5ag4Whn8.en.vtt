00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.690 
of the top 20 verse weeds and it is on
there<00:00:32.579> so<00:00:33.300> it's<00:00:33.719> really<00:00:33.899> bad<00:00:34.170> news<00:00:34.500> has<00:00:35.489> the

capacity to double its size incredibly

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.090 
capacity to double its size incredibly
rapidly<00:00:38.879> so<00:00:39.510> a<00:00:39.540> period<00:00:40.200> of<00:00:40.230> months<00:00:40.410> from<00:00:40.800> a

rapidly so a period of months from a

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.910 
rapidly so a period of months from a
small<00:00:41.460> parent<00:00:41.940> plant<00:00:42.239> you'll<00:00:42.480> end<00:00:42.690> up<00:00:42.809> with

infestations so there's a cycle that as
the<00:01:42.450> plants<00:01:42.780> grow<00:01:42.840> they<00:01:43.530> absorb<00:01:43.950> the

the plants grow they absorb the

the plants grow they absorb the

but then they also died and then we

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.550 
but then they also died and then we
release<00:01:48.090> those<00:01:48.540> nutrients<00:01:49.140> as<00:01:49.320> they

release those nutrients as they

simple over the years there's been a lot

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:09.770

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
of citation into the lagoon so the base

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.530 
of citation into the lagoon so the base

get the the water from the river to go

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:25.580 
get the the water from the river to go
up<00:04:23.219> a<00:04:23.430> 90<00:04:23.760> degree<00:04:23.909> and<00:04:24.419> then<00:04:24.570> across<00:04:24.870> into<00:04:25.380> the

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.800 
lagoon removal of the we mess of the way
problem<00:04:28.410> but<00:04:28.740> what<00:04:28.919> of<00:04:29.039> its<00:04:29.190> inhabitants<00:04:29.810> well

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
problem but what of its inhabitants well

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:33.740 
problem but what of its inhabitants well
I<00:04:30.840> would<00:04:31.229> anticipate<00:04:31.530> that<00:04:32.000> the<00:04:33.000> outcome<00:04:33.389> of

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:33.750 
I would anticipate that the outcome of

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:35.779 
I would anticipate that the outcome of
the<00:04:34.080> of<00:04:34.410> the<00:04:34.560> we<00:04:34.710> release<00:04:35.069> would<00:04:35.310> be<00:04:35.490> in<00:04:35.699> the

00:04:35.779 --> 00:04:35.789 
the of the we release would be in the

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:38.180 
the of the we release would be in the
short<00:04:36.060> term<00:04:36.300> a<00:04:36.740> reduction<00:04:37.740> in<00:04:37.830> biodiversity

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.190 
short term a reduction in biodiversity

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:40.879 
short term a reduction in biodiversity
and<00:04:38.789> then<00:04:39.120> a<00:04:39.150> very<00:04:39.389> rapid<00:04:39.780> recovery<00:04:39.960> back<00:04:40.590> to

00:04:40.879 --> 00:04:40.889 
and then a very rapid recovery back to

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:43.550 
and then a very rapid recovery back to

the original sweetest of animals and

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:45.230

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
plants in that system yeah the question

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.650 
plants in that system yeah the question
of<00:04:45.539> the<00:04:45.660> freshwater<00:04:45.870> species<00:04:46.410> remain<00:04:47.660> because

option in this situation I think long

00:05:16.979 --> 00:05:18.890 
option in this situation I think long

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:29.220 
in general will still be cleaning out at

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:30.950 
in general will still be cleaning out at
least<00:05:29.370> 20<00:05:29.639> or<00:05:29.699> 30<00:05:29.849> so<00:05:30.030> the<00:05:30.150> pond<00:05:30.360> as<00:05:30.509> well<00:05:30.720> which

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:30.960 
least 20 or 30 so the pond as well which

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.170 
least 20 or 30 so the pond as well which
will<00:05:31.110> make<00:05:31.199> it<00:05:31.259> to<00:05:31.440> water<00:05:31.710> a<00:05:32.039> brackish<00:05:32.849> water

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:33.180 
will make it to water a brackish water

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:35.540 
will make it to water a brackish water
and<00:05:34.169> the<00:05:34.320> native<00:05:34.590> life<00:05:34.770> and<00:05:35.039> can<00:05:35.190> still<00:05:35.400> live

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:35.550 
and the native life and can still live

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:38.060 
and the native life and can still live
within<00:05:35.699> the<00:05:35.880> box<00:05:36.229> whatever<00:05:37.229> is<00:05:37.469> done<00:05:37.680> it<00:05:37.919> have

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:38.070 
within the box whatever is done it have

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:41.060 
within the box whatever is done it have
to<00:05:38.219> be<00:05:38.250> water<00:05:38.969> released<00:05:39.449> gradually<00:05:40.409> over

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:41.070 
to be water released gradually over

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:44.270 
to be water released gradually over
months<00:05:41.729> if<00:05:41.909> not<00:05:41.940> over<00:05:42.389> years<00:05:42.750> to<00:05:43.620> slowly<00:05:43.800> bring

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:44.280 
months if not over years to slowly bring

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:48.020 
months if not over years to slowly bring
the<00:05:44.400> level<00:05:44.820> down<00:05:45.000> so<00:05:45.690> we<00:05:46.469> created<00:05:46.889> a<00:05:47.310> little

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:48.030 
the level down so we created a little

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:51.110 
the level down so we created a little
ecosystem<00:05:48.300> we<00:05:49.080> created<00:05:49.680> a<00:05:50.039> problem<00:05:50.280> we<00:05:50.940> have

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:51.120 
ecosystem we created a problem we have

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:52.730 
ecosystem we created a problem we have
to<00:05:51.270> solve<00:05:51.449> that<00:05:51.719> problem<00:05:52.020> and<00:05:52.289> that<00:05:52.500> might

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:52.740 
to solve that problem and that might

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:55.249 
to solve that problem and that might
mean<00:05:52.770> changes<00:05:53.610> in<00:05:53.820> the<00:05:54.210> nature<00:05:54.419> of<00:05:54.659> the<00:05:54.750> area

00:05:55.249 --> 00:05:55.259 
mean changes in the nature of the area

00:05:55.259 --> 00:05:59.030 
mean changes in the nature of the area
but<00:05:55.710> that's<00:05:55.919> okay<00:05:56.280> things<00:05:56.669> change
