00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.970

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:11.820
 To tell you about samsung galaxy 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:14.610
 mega luso that's right our samsung 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:17.010
 galaxy mega plus ultra power my a 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:20.400
 samsung is fire 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.949
 she launches the samsung galaxy mega 5.8 that 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.800
 we already know there since last year 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:29.939
 and now she threw it forward and 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:34.309
 launched here the samsung galaxy mega light or 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:37.079
 be it samsung galaxy mega 5.8 as 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:39.480
 small improvements are not personal but yes 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.559
 a little more just you will see here 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.910
 not comparative 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:50.190
 I'm another website that gadget 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:53.430
 guedes ponto ndtv dot com and I used it 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:56.489
 this is the comparative here to show 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:01:00.059
 for you there the launch there samsung 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:04.199
 getting ahead samsung galaxy mega plus 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:09.090
 Let's go, oh, the Samsung Galaxy mega 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:14.430
 5.8 it is i 9152 and the other is the hymn 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:15.600
 9152 p p than too much personal bidding 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.930
 huh 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.930
 come on 1 was announced in June 2013 the 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.790
 another now in February 2014 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:27.299
 touchscreen the dimensions of the same 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:29.850
 being that the galaxy plus it weighs a 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.079
 little more like a big one and a half 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.680
 almost anything 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:37.110
 the battery of the same capacity is talking 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:40.890
 that is not removable battery exist 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:44.040
 this spirit is not here but personal 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:46.590
 many to tell you 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.960
 information may not be 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:52.369
 According're here because no site today 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:55.890
 days it is as well as reliable 100% okay 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:59.909
 can always be a divergence of dje 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:03.570
 one item or another is that more colors 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:06.390
 Well, Sergeant Melo is white. 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.140
 which is the value of the radiation also not 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.569
 consists 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:13.210
 but there in the gsm arena arena surely he 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:16.320
 write the sars 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:19.930
 is the screen size 5.8 for both ne 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:23.530
 capacitive touchscreen inhabitants right 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:25.810
 until then resolution 540 by our 60 and 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.300
 which of the two 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.380
 or it does not specify points for 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.260
 inches 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:34.360
 It's okay if you see that cell phone in there. 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:38.050
 gsm arena you will have a notion more 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:40.360
 or less than the bid is for example is 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:43.620
 points per inch that does not discriminate 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:46.210
 here colors 16 million and 16 million 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.710
 basics here has something that the other 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:50.830
 sites said the following samsung galaxy 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:53.920
 mega it speaks that dual-core 1.4 but in 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:55.990
 other sites speak al khor of 1.7 and 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:59.320
 This they say has improved because it is a 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:01.210
 core of 1.2 but it depends a lot too 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:05.740
 if it 's a sets it's a new one and without a 

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:07.900
 cell phone 11 understood how much the 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:10.060
 The main thing of all is the antidote to see 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:13.480
 if his performance is better than 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:15.340
 its predecessor gmail handball for 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:18.730
 for the two nor eight gigas the same for 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:20.620
 the two né storage is memory of 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:23.530
 storage capacity of 16 gb also for 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:27.120
 two do not talk until how much will it surely 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:29.530
 be up to 64 equal the galaxy takes the camera 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:33.190
 8 megapixel rear and camera 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:34.210
 1.9 front and flash for both led 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:37.330
 flash right 

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:39.130
 android 4.2 for both but if I 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:43.390
 cheating the mega galaxy it already goes 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:46.090
 to receive the 4 4 ​​2 the plan is the omega 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:48.970
 also he will receive 4 4 ​​2 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:52.750
 it is very likely that when you leave or 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:53.590
 plan skirt with 442 support for now 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:57.400
 I'll talk here 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:59.590
 yesterday other does not have the browser support 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:02.350
 to flash in Brazil so here not 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:04.060
 is sure and if the browser flash that 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:05.770
 Ah okay, he said so 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:08.260
 It's very strange because you 're not having 

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:10.810
 more flash support is very strange 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:15.210
 this information goes to both none 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:18.430
 of them have a father does support is thunder 

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:20.230
 support standard for wifi neither 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:23.830
 I had not seen this issue still okay 

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:25.570
 gps for both bluetooth nfc none have 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.340
 infrared also has no 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:29.560
 dl n is only for the 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:34.150
 samsung galaxy mega for the plan does not have 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:37.210
 dna does not have wi fi direct the mhl out that is 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:39.850
 that cart there for you is to do the 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:43.000
 hdmi also does not have to both output 

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:45.790
 neither was hdmi in video three and 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.139
 means for both him and the team since there 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:52.150
 what they say 

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:55.479
 p2 né 2f I think this fm has for the 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:56.919
 plus micro sp to charge and 

00:04:55.479 --> 00:05:01.270
 data transfer 

00:04:56.919 --> 00:05:03.729
 it's loading via usb and yes that's more 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:06.310
 charge connector here 

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:09.840
 It's not a proprietary connector, right? 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:13.770
 uploading a micro usb and to 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:16.000
 own te data connector 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:18.010
 owner for data, not because 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.030
 it uses a standard micro usb today 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:22.750
 market 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:23.650
 tá number of sims 2 there for two 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:27.220
 again 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:27.669
 yes, yes, two is micro sim for both 

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:32.320
 huh 

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:34.990
 the frequencies 2 and 3g and 2g and 3g were not gené 

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:39.430
 23 is normal to not supported so 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:42.700
 I see here for 4g sensors is the 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:46.180
 galaxy mega he has what he has to 

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:49.240
 step that more that has relation with another 

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:52.360
 comparsa he has and one gyro the other 

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:54.990
 It only has the same thing as what to do to 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:57.940
 both are have accelerometer proximity 

00:05:54.990 --> 00:06:01.419
 ambient light sensor 

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:03.700
 It's not for barometer and not for 

00:06:01.419 --> 00:06:09.010
 temperature sensor 

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:10.510
 has the west 4 o this cell phone that they 

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:12.250
 they are saying that it is certainly 

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:13.930
 first launched there in 

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:16.300
 not like that 

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:18.099
 so that after he won the world who 

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:19.389
 He knows he won the world over and here comes 

00:06:18.099 --> 00:06:20.680
 to Brazil for Europe and states 

00:06:19.389 --> 00:06:24.340
 United 

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:26.770
 But today it's commercialized Mega Sun I 

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:28.960
 I find the following samsung 

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:31.300
 she should and should not have liked 

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:34.210
 some characteristics of the class 

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:36.400
 average circulation the club get the plus 

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:38.530
 with minor improvements 

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:41.050
 I do not know if I live here when it will 

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:44.440
 will be 200 reais more expensive $ 300 max 

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:49.150
 for 200 300 above 10 but not longer 

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:51.879
 it's worth my while you buy one 

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:53.530
 a little more expensive just because 

00:06:51.879 --> 00:06:56.319
 changed the side chain 

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:59.050
 For me, this is just embellishment and change. 

00:06:56.319 --> 00:07:02.289
 could be much more significant with 

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:03.460
 a ram is nfc type in 

00:07:02.289 --> 00:07:07.479
 infra-red 

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:09.430
 I use it so a little more on 

00:07:07.479 --> 00:07:11.889
 relation to his predecessor to see that 

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:13.840
 an improvement is not nearly equal to the 

00:07:11.889 --> 00:07:17.080
 I told him he killed with a 

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:20.289
 Side to me is samsung jorge that was not 

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:22.240
 very happy in this release not 

00:07:20.289 --> 00:07:24.759
 could have kept the galaxy mega menu 

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:27.819
 edit more samsung it looks like it has 

00:07:24.759 --> 00:07:29.919
 a goal to beat x cell phones 

00:07:27.819 --> 00:07:31.389
 for a month there to continue first 

00:07:29.919 --> 00:07:33.520
 market place 

00:07:31.389 --> 00:07:35.349
 But it does not bring innovation. 

00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:37.389
 innovation now with these five we'll see 

00:07:35.349 --> 00:07:40.120
 what happens and will bring innovation or 

00:07:37.389 --> 00:07:43.360
 no, it's not personal, that's the comparative 

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:46.930
 between samsung galaxy mega 5858 

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:49.120
 the samsung galaxy mega plus also 5.8 

00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:50.979
 between quotation marks could have been a 

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:54.759
 improved 6 improved better one 

00:07:50.979 --> 00:07:57.009
 t t of a greater improvement in 

00:07:54.759 --> 00:07:59.050
 personal touch with your predecessor 

00:07:57.009 --> 00:08:00.069
 so that if you liked the Oceania 

00:07:59.050 --> 00:08:04.319
 left a message 

00:08:00.069 --> 00:08:04.319
 Okay, thank you and see you later.
