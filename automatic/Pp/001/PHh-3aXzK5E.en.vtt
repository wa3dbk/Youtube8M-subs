00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:35.849 
look at it now is because it is the

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:37.520

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
forerunner and the voice that I

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:51.530

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.509 
eventually honed in on for mr. bean it
felt<00:02:51.900> funny<00:02:52.110> at<00:02:52.319> the<00:02:52.349> time<00:02:52.410> and<00:02:52.950> so<00:02:53.130> I<00:02:53.160> thought

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
felt funny at the time and so I thought

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:56.420 
felt funny at the time and so I thought
when<00:02:54.269> we<00:02:54.450> were<00:02:54.569> trying<00:02:54.780> to<00:02:54.870> think<00:02:55.160> ten<00:02:56.160> years

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
when we were trying to think ten years

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.449 
when we were trying to think ten years
later<00:02:56.639> it<00:02:57.239> must<00:02:57.510> have<00:02:57.660> been<00:02:57.780> for<00:02:57.989> a<00:02:58.049> voice<00:02:58.470> for

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
later it must have been for a voice for

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:02.180 
later it must have been for a voice for
mr.<00:02:59.760> Bing<00:03:00.079> that<00:03:01.079> was<00:03:01.350> just<00:03:01.590> the<00:03:01.739> voice<00:03:01.950> that

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
mr. Bing that was just the voice that

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:04.670 
mr. Bing that was just the voice that
I'd<00:03:02.340> done<00:03:02.700> that<00:03:03.030> had<00:03:03.209> amused<00:03:03.540> me<00:03:03.720> the<00:03:03.810> most<00:03:04.049> and

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
I'd done that had amused me the most and

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:19.500 
I'd done that had amused me the most and
so<00:03:04.709> we<00:03:05.430> used<00:03:05.609> it<00:03:05.760> yeah
