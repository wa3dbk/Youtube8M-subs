00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:09.340
 ora alves 

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:12.760
 Yes, we play 3 hits today. 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:17.260
 I got 6 hits and 4 hits against Freeman. 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:20.980
 But he left the dog is Elk half three today, which points geolkkayo well right away 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:26.410
 Well what kigo floating in the ditch The players 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:28.030
 I've got a setup assistant, but my total has been a lot lagging recently, 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:31.690
 There was everyone . 

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:33.250
 Somehow, we are a hitters , 

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:37.239
 I can continue. 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:42.579
 4 As you said in the fact, you had some difficulty getting on base. 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:49.659
 Last week, yes, I saw Tilia five times. What was different ? 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:54.609
 Well, I do not know how to deodorize, but personally I 'd rather be a little slower. 

00:00:49.659 --> 00:00:59.019
 I have a lot of minds and I need to see a lot of genealogies so I can pick a lot . 

00:00:54.609 --> 00:01:05.280
 There are a lot of situations like that. 

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:05.280
 I have seen a bit of a swing and a bit of striking recently. 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:12.820
 I was surprised at my daily routines . 

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:17.710
 I chose this timing for the second base 5 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:23.950
 What a lot of talk directly with flowers and haeteotgo then cadence contains the word more 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:28.000
 My teammate has a lot of 9000 seniors who are steaming. 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:32.229
 I thought that you should run a lot of young friends like you for your phone or advanced . 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:36.640
 I think I 've done it for a while. 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:41.049
 Oh Ji-hwan's record shows that the second tile has a very high tile. 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:43.000
 Today , I felt something in the first inning, 

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:45.849
 Look at the application. 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:50.920
 Uh I do not know what cares 

00:01:45.849 --> 00:01:54.539
 My feeling is that only a little because I think a lot of motivation to get out doing what one 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:58.799
 It looks like it was a good result 

00:01:54.539 --> 00:02:00.119
 I am an active whether as athletes woojiwon nickname minority dominated the Twins lg 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.090
 I think you do. 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:07.590
 What is your focus? 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:11.670
 Well , once the defense is early, 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:15.180
 The professionals try to lead me to write a lot of focus a little lapping a little steep 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:19.910
 I look forward to your place now. 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.910
 Bamse-the- thee. I've been to Ujiswon so far. 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.069
