00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:17.210
 hello everyone welcome to have at home 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:19.160
 I am frank and today we have a boxing and 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:25.340
 review of a micro- think of 8 cores 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:27.110
 the fx 83 50 this processor the brother 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.810
 smaller than what we use to arm 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:31.759
 the spice gamer 2013 and the only 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:34.580
 difference that you have with the previous one is 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:37.640
 that it runs at 4 gigabytes while the 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:39.170
 another one went back to 4.2 that 's the version 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.910
 being freshly left the house but 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:45.110
 As you can see we are talking about a 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:46.549
 md black edition processor what 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.010
 means does it mean that it is 

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:50.510
 totally overlock yale if you do not know what 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.519
 which is or unblock you can click 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.019
 in this annotation that just came out 

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:56.449
 he brought today a video where 

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:59.979
 we talked a little bit of obvious but 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:00:59.979
 basically is to force 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:06.810
 the cpu and gpu or chipset to move to 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.409
 work at the highest frequency of the 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.360
 which is originally thought but of 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.750
 all forms that have to be so 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:19.050
 for example in the same cpu house we 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.869
 we found because that jaime tells us 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:23.880
 that comes back in the first 8 processor 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.950
 nuclei in the world that is today inflated 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.159
 with all that but also tells us that 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.380
 It is totally unlocked and overclocked 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.110
 that speaks and is in English but with the 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:38.160
 that they do not understand god commented on them 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:41.160
 is going to have the technology of the corp group 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:43.229
 and what it basically does is run 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:46.590
 these four rivers 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:48.420
 but when the machine needs only 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.810
 interpret it a little faster 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:55.470
 to talk not that extra juice that 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:58.220
 we will need now yes 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:01.220
 so we 're not going to have to look 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.220
 a 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:10.679
 most important cooling solution 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.679
 that this now 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:22.040
 we go 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:22.040
 the processor includes a cure 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.450
 here we find the cooler 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:35.110
 that the cost of the processor gives 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:38.800
 Shame may not exist sticker 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:40.380
 central good about 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.710
 the cooler 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:45.840
 usually us anyway 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:49.050
 at the bottom as always comes 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:51.570
 with 200 kilos of thermal pasta one thing 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:53.910
 absolutely brutal and also a door 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:56.610
 so bad quality baths that we push 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:58.770
 if it were a glue if you saw 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.920
 my previous videos to see that 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:03.740
 there is a video about thermal potatoes 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.950
 and there I tell you that the pasta ended 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:09.099
 very useful and homemade 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:12.209
 cracks or imperfections that may have 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:12.209
 between the heat zinc 

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:19.190
 and the top letter of the cpu while 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.410
 Do it 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:26.030
 with a close-up and we are 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:28.400
 with an amd fx decal on what 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.800
 what tells us that he was talking about 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:33.410
 processors are for enthusiasts to 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:35.660
 people who want to put their hands and play 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:38.930
 this processor also together with 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:41.900
 our blue plate cro hair 5 that 

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:44.780
 we had the video last week like this 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:45.910
 that we're going to see all those options 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.520
 manageable 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:51.880
 this that everything is hitchings we're going to 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:53.890
 save because we will not use it anymore 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:56.500
 that in the next video we will be 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:04:00.360
 seeing something that also has we have 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:03.600
 orders and we have pending on the channel 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:06.720
 another thing quite 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:08.310
 is that this color is exactly the same 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.700
 to the power that has come in the 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:13.530
 microprocessor that I used to arm 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:16.650
 the gamer machine 2011 that was a 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:19.590
 phenomenon I feel that was the top of 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:21.239
 range of feder at that time and came with 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:23.040
 exactly law or color 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:25.080
 I keep having pulled brad and why not 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:31.110
 it serves more logical cold 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:33.419
 if you do not imagine this a4 giga processor 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:36.539
 hertz while the 1100 I was running to 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:39.090
 3.3 lakers and have they still have the 

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:42.700
 same system of really liked 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:45.760
 the one of the mind of the saloc to your videos 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:47.530
 this forget about the week of having a house 

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:51.180
 I hope you liked it we'll see you 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:51.180
 next strong with a new video
