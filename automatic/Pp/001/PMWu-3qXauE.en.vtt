00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:08.910
 Hello here is another part of the means 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:11.550
 how do we clean now doing this 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:15.809
 so that this band will go this 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:18.810
 technology side is just the same 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:22.670
 We loops transfer me out here and 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:28.140
 from here to here, respectively, means 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:29.789
 I will show how to do it means I will show without 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.099
 additional knitting needles 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.320
 but if someone needs to show from 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.070
 additional knitting needles 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:40.170
 so I'm already here because I have a bend 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:42.360
 passed already up accordingly me here 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.000
 already several hinges have been moved 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.770
 means and follow closely to you with 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.690
 this side and this side always 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.559
 there were the same number of loops to 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:55.320
 respectively, the diamond was exactly the same 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:58.109
 mean what i do mean these 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:02.850
 loops will start when you have just 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:05.430
 only 2 yes I already have them more 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:10.100
 I knit it clearly inside out 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:17.700
 yes, now I have fastened this loop 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:21.930
 boxing i'm here a broken drawing should 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:28.170
 be with us at the same time see how 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:30.990
 correct so then corrected 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.119
 so this is my path yes my 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.270
 strip i'm this loop 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.850
 should transfer to this side like me 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:42.290
 doing this 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.290
 take off 1 3 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:49.310
 I rented the next one 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:53.659
 will carry 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:57.289
 pursue the next I take off 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:57.950
 three loops back together with that 

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:02.299
 knitted 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:07.959
 and the one that I knit it I cling to 1 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:10.640
 on the right knitting needle and these I knit and 

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:16.280
 so it turns out that I'm here 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:21.980
 now moved from here to here so now 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:27.940
 on the other hand on the other hand means 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:27.940
 Do not forget to knit our pattern to 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:39.579
 our little pattern and look what it means to me 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:44.690
 need this loop from here to move here 

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:47.269
 yes that means i do i hook up 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:55.940
 I miss this loop which I endure 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:03:03.620
 I pick up 3 I take off with this needle we grab 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:07.760
 this one and itâ€™s convenient for me these three 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:13.220
 loop back on this knitting needle like this 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:17.739
 and now I calm them down 2 3 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:24.500
 loops this is my lane and it's transferred 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:28.120
 purse well and dovevyazyvat respectively 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.120
 my land 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:36.840
 see what happens yes 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:38.670
 it turns out that when we need 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.130
 remember just one simple thing and 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:43.830
 technology yes that is if you want 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:48.270
 so that you have these bands 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:51.150
 walked accordingly walked accordingly 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:55.830
 it is in this direction is in this side of the 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:04:00.569
 you have to remove loops from here 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:04.080
 inside to carry and if needed so that 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:07.020
 Respectively, the strip went right over here 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:10.350
 you need loops accordingly from here 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:12.959
 transfer here from here to here that is 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:15.330
 expand this space to a 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:17.040
 is to reduce it's actually 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:21.710
 saying and all the technology is knitting these 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:26.340
 rhombic that's when you get to 

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:29.190
 of what you have left here is 0 and 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:31.290
 tilde or 1 loop 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:35.340
 however, it remains itself exactly odd 

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:39.000
 the number of I respectively accurately 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:42.780
 I also have three strip loops 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:45.150
 one loop inner 3 loop strip and i 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:45.780
 in the same way as here I am the first lesson about 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:48.090
 this 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:50.700
 rombick told doing back 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:53.190
 pigtail that is perry cross here 

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:55.320
 it is desirable to do it of course in another 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:57.540
 side here he looks at me so yes 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:01.050
 that is, you need to look at the drawing here 

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:03.810
 this one went here i have this one 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:06.000
 from below as it comes out here he should 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:07.590
 be up that is a pigtail when 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.590
 do you see what you do 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:14.360
 pigtail forward or pigtail back like this 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:14.360
 everything is just for now
