here<00:00:42.480> some<00:00:42.690> of<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.870> chatter<00:00:43.309> below<00:00:44.309> that<00:00:44.579> is

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
here some of the chatter below that is

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.810 
here some of the chatter below that is
our<00:00:45.059> stabilizers<00:00:45.870> and<00:00:46.710> right<00:00:47.340> now<00:00:47.550> they're

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
our stabilizers and right now they're

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.490 
our stabilizers and right now they're
not<00:00:47.850> doing<00:00:47.969> much<00:00:48.239> of<00:00:48.420> anything<00:00:48.690> is<00:00:49.110> going<00:00:49.260> live

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
not doing much of anything is going live

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.410 
not doing much of anything is going live
and<00:00:49.680> you'd<00:00:49.860> see<00:00:50.100> a<00:00:50.129> pattern<00:00:50.579> on<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:51.000> screen<00:00:51.270> I

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
and you'd see a pattern on the screen I

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.689 
and you'd see a pattern on the screen I
bet<00:00:51.629> we've<00:00:52.199> got<00:00:52.350> nice<00:00:52.559> flat<00:00:52.829> water<00:00:53.129> so<00:00:53.520> that's

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
bet we've got nice flat water so that's

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.080 
bet we've got nice flat water so that's
about<00:00:53.850> yet<00:00:54.379> here<00:00:55.379> we<00:00:55.500> see<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.770> radar<00:00:55.980> and<00:00:56.520> you

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
about yet here we see the radar and you

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.270 
about yet here we see the radar and you
can<00:00:57.210> see<00:00:57.360> it<00:00:57.480> zoomed<00:00:57.719> out<00:00:57.899> to<00:00:58.320> up<00:00:58.980> in<00:00:59.160> this

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
can see it zoomed out to up in this

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.400 
can see it zoomed out to up in this
corner<00:00:59.640> one<00:01:00.239> and<00:01:00.270> a<00:01:00.420> half<00:01:00.600> miles<00:01:00.930> so<00:01:01.170> you<00:01:01.230> see

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
corner one and a half miles so you see

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.930 
corner one and a half miles so you see
everything<00:01:01.739> happening<00:01:01.949> in<00:01:02.309> one<00:01:02.520> and<00:01:02.699> a<00:01:02.760> half

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
everything happening in one and a half

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.719 
everything happening in one and a half
mile<00:01:03.180> radius<00:01:03.420> around<00:01:03.840> us<00:01:04.290> this<00:01:05.280> is<00:01:05.460> where<00:01:05.580> we

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
mile radius around us this is where we

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.740 
mile radius around us this is where we
control<00:01:06.090> it<00:01:07.640> this<00:01:08.640> is<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:09.000> control<00:01:09.360> for<00:01:09.570> a

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
control it this is the control for a

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.929 
control it this is the control for a
sonar<00:01:10.530> which<00:01:10.920> shows<00:01:11.159> us<00:01:11.340> what's<00:01:11.580> below<00:01:11.909> the

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
sonar which shows us what's below the

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.850 
sonar which shows us what's below the
water<00:01:12.240> but<00:01:12.479> I'm<00:01:12.570> not<00:01:12.689> using<00:01:13.020> it<00:01:13.229> now<00:01:13.439> because

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
water but I'm not using it now because

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.230 
water but I'm not using it now because
they're<00:01:14.010> in<00:01:14.100> deep<00:01:14.310> water<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:14.700> there's<00:01:14.939> really

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
they're in deep water and there's really

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.410 
they're in deep water and there's really
no<00:01:15.450> reason<00:01:15.659> to<00:01:16.580> this<00:01:17.580> shows<00:01:17.820> us<00:01:18.060> our<00:01:18.270> current

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
no reason to this shows us our current

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.530 
no reason to this shows us our current
heading<00:01:19.020> and<00:01:19.409> that<00:01:19.619> we're<00:01:19.740> on<00:01:19.860> auto<00:01:20.159> mode<00:01:20.540> in

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
heading and that we're on auto mode in

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:22.969 
heading and that we're on auto mode in
real<00:01:21.750> life<00:01:21.930> we<00:01:22.170> don't<00:01:22.200> use<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:22.740> steering

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
real life we don't use the steering

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.130 
real life we don't use the steering
wheel<00:01:23.250> we<00:01:23.400> just<00:01:23.610> use<00:01:23.790> this<00:01:24.000> little<00:01:24.330> knob<00:01:24.810> here

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
wheel we just use this little knob here

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.289 
wheel we just use this little knob here
to<00:01:25.380> turn<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:25.710> boat<00:01:26.960> this<00:01:27.960> is<00:01:28.490> our<00:01:29.490> chart

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
to turn the boat this is our chart

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.539 
to turn the boat this is our chart
plotter<00:01:30.990> this<00:01:31.439> is<00:01:31.619> what<00:01:31.770> we<00:01:31.890> really<00:01:32.159> look<00:01:32.400> at

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
plotter this is what we really look at

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.120 
plotter this is what we really look at
most<00:01:32.850> showing<00:01:33.360> our<00:01:33.930> course<00:01:34.259> and<00:01:34.560> if<00:01:35.009> i<00:01:35.100> zoom

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
most showing our course and if i zoom

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.420 
most showing our course and if i zoom
out<00:01:35.460> you<00:01:35.759> can<00:01:35.909> see<00:01:36.119> our<00:01:36.240> course<00:01:37.430> we're

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
out you can see our course we're

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.580 
out you can see our course we're
actually<00:01:38.579> running<00:01:39.210> up<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.630> east<00:01:39.840> coast<00:01:40.049> of<00:01:40.500> an

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
actually running up the east coast of an

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:41.510 
actually running up the east coast of an
island

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
island

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.149 
island
and<00:01:41.790> I'm<00:01:42.240> not<00:01:42.450> sure<00:01:42.600> what<00:01:42.750> Island<00:01:43.110> but<00:01:44.010> we're

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
and I'm not sure what Island but we're

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.640 
and I'm not sure what Island but we're
going<00:01:44.430> to<00:01:44.580> an<00:01:44.700> island<00:01:44.850> called<00:01:45.119> malli<00:01:45.990> low<00:01:46.290> Sims

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:46.650 
going to an island called malli low Sims

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:48.530 
going to an island called malli low Sims
that<00:01:46.979> you<00:01:47.070> can<00:01:47.220> see<00:01:47.400> up<00:01:47.520> there<00:01:47.760> the<00:01:48.420> beginning

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
that you can see up there the beginning

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.070 
that you can see up there the beginning
of<00:01:48.840> a<00:01:48.900> fairly<00:01:49.140> long<00:01:49.409> run<00:01:50.600> actually<00:01:51.600> I<00:01:51.869> guess<00:01:52.050> a

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:52.080 
of a fairly long run actually I guess a

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.630 
of a fairly long run actually I guess a
short<00:01:52.380> run<00:01:52.560> for<00:01:52.740> a<00:01:52.770> North<00:01:53.010> hop<00:01:53.159> in<00:01:53.340> a<00:01:53.400> few<00:01:53.610> hours

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
short run for a North hop in a few hours

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.030 
short run for a North hop in a few hours
but<00:01:54.150> that<00:01:54.720> chart<00:01:55.229> map<00:01:55.409> shows<00:01:55.650> Roberta's

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:52.280 
West this satellite compass will keep
track<00:03:49.200> of<00:03:49.350> where<00:03:49.470> the<00:03:49.620> boat<00:03:49.800> is<00:03:49.830> and<00:03:51.290> that's

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
track of where the boat is and that's

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.910 
track of where the boat is and that's
like<00:03:52.470> a<00:03:52.500> GPS<00:03:52.890> but<00:03:53.280> infinitely<00:03:53.820> more<00:03:53.970> accurate

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:54.920 
like a GPS but infinitely more accurate

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.620 
like a GPS but infinitely more accurate
here<00:03:55.920> we've<00:03:56.040> got<00:03:56.190> the<00:03:56.400> engine<00:03:56.610> gauges<00:03:57.000> which<00:03:57.450> I

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
here we've got the engine gauges which I

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.330 
here we've got the engine gauges which I
almost<00:03:57.750> never<00:03:58.020> look<00:03:58.290> at<00:03:58.500> because<00:03:58.770> it's<00:03:59.130> more

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
almost never look at because it's more

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.580 
almost never look at because it's more
convenient<00:03:59.670> to<00:03:59.940> look<00:04:00.090> at<00:04:00.330> Simon<00:04:01.260> or<00:04:01.530> a

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
convenient to look at Simon or a

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:07.900 
convenient to look at Simon or a
monitoring<00:04:02.370> system<00:04:02.580> which<00:04:02.820> puts<00:04:03.210> it<00:04:03.330> on<00:04:03.450> a<00:04:03.480> TV

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:07.910 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:12.830 

yeah<00:04:08.910> let's<00:04:09.660> see<00:04:09.840> here's<00:04:10.140> our<00:04:10.350> depth<00:04:10.770> and<00:04:11.840> this

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
yeah let's see here's our depth and this

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.830 
yeah let's see here's our depth and this
just<00:04:13.500> gives<00:04:13.710> us<00:04:14.000> our<00:04:15.000> depth<00:04:15.330> and<00:04:15.600> all<00:04:15.720> the

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
just gives us our depth and all the

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.650 
just gives us our depth and all the
water<00:04:15.990> temperature<00:04:16.470> 79<00:04:16.890> degrees<00:04:17.660> interesting

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
water temperature 79 degrees interesting

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.110 
water temperature 79 degrees interesting
here<00:04:19.530> I<00:04:19.560> can<00:04:19.830> turn<00:04:20.010> on<00:04:20.040> our<00:04:20.160> nav<00:04:20.489> lights<00:04:20.790> but

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 
here I can turn on our nav lights but

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.070 
here I can turn on our nav lights but
since<00:04:21.330> the<00:04:21.420> state<00:04:21.630> time<00:04:21.840> I<00:04:22.050> have<00:04:22.230> no<00:04:22.440> lights<00:04:22.710> on

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.080 
since the state time I have no lights on

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.720 
since the state time I have no lights on
this<00:04:25.080> allows<00:04:25.470> me<00:04:25.740> to<00:04:25.770> turn<00:04:26.010> on<00:04:26.070> things<00:04:26.490> like

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:26.730 
this allows me to turn on things like

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:28.370 
this allows me to turn on things like
the<00:04:26.940> windlass<00:04:27.330> for<00:04:27.570> raising<00:04:27.900> and<00:04:28.020> lower<00:04:28.170> than

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:28.380 
the windlass for raising and lower than

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:31.460 
the windlass for raising and lower than
the<00:04:28.500> anchor<00:04:29.210> turn<00:04:30.210> on<00:04:30.330> the<00:04:30.450> water<00:04:30.480> that<00:04:31.050> closes

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:31.470 
the anchor turn on the water that closes

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:34.030 
the anchor turn on the water that closes
down<00:04:31.500> the<00:04:31.830> anchor<00:04:31.980> as<00:04:32.220> it's<00:04:32.400> coming<00:04:32.700> up<00:04:32.880> and

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:34.040 
down the anchor as it's coming up and

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.450 
down the anchor as it's coming up and
