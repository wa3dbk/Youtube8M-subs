when<00:02:18.319> you<00:02:18.500> approach<00:02:19.100> an<00:02:19.459> enemy<00:02:20.209> that<00:02:20.420> is

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
when you approach an enemy that is

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:26.170 
when you approach an enemy that is
crouched<00:02:23.290> it's<00:02:24.290> kind<00:02:24.620> of<00:02:24.739> 5050<00:02:25.400> as<00:02:25.760> to<00:02:26.000> whether

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
crouched it's kind of 5050 as to whether

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.559 
crouched it's kind of 5050 as to whether
you<00:02:26.480> can<00:02:26.780> shift<00:02:27.170> them<00:02:27.410> or<00:02:27.620> not<00:02:28.180> you<00:02:29.180> know<00:02:29.330> I

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:29.569 
you can shift them or not you know I

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:32.740

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
surprising myself so don't even think

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:36.280 
surprising myself so don't even think
that<00:03:32.690> you<00:03:33.520> know<00:03:34.520> I<00:03:34.670> mastered<00:03:35.510> this<00:03:35.690> because<00:03:36.170> i

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
that you know I mastered this because i

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.070 
that you know I mastered this because i
haven't<00:03:36.470> the<00:03:37.060> hunting<00:03:38.060> rifle<00:03:38.510> is<00:03:38.600> one<00:03:38.900> of<00:03:38.990> the

haven't the hunting rifle is one of the

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:42.460 
haven't the hunting rifle is one of the
weapons<00:03:39.950> that<00:03:40.250> I've<00:03:40.720> found<00:03:41.720> difficult<00:03:42.050> to

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:42.470 
weapons that I've found difficult to

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:45.310 
weapons that I've found difficult to
master<00:03:42.980> but<00:03:43.700> I'm<00:03:43.820> trying<00:03:44.180> and<00:03:44.510> I<00:03:44.870> just<00:03:45.080> think

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:45.320 
master but I'm trying and I just think

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:49.720 
master but I'm trying and I just think
with<00:03:46.190> all<00:03:46.250> the<00:03:46.640> missions<00:03:48.130> that<00:03:49.130> you<00:03:49.310> undergo

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:49.730 
with all the missions that you undergo

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:52.480 
with all the missions that you undergo
within<00:03:50.660> your<00:03:50.780> 12<00:03:51.080> weeks<00:03:51.380> i<00:03:51.560> think<00:03:51.920> is<00:03:52.070> such<00:03:52.310> a

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:52.490 
within your 12 weeks i think is such a

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:55.570 
within your 12 weeks i think is such a
great<00:03:52.989> way<00:03:53.989> of<00:03:54.020> getting<00:03:54.770> yourself<00:03:55.160> used<00:03:55.430> to

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:55.580 
great way of getting yourself used to

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:57.850 
great way of getting yourself used to
all<00:03:55.730> weapons<00:03:56.239> you<00:03:57.050> know<00:03:57.170> because<00:03:57.470> the<00:03:57.560> reward

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:57.860 
all weapons you know because the reward

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:59.199 
all weapons you know because the reward
for<00:03:58.040> that<00:03:58.070> is<00:03:58.280> to<00:03:58.430> multiply<00:03:58.610> your<00:03:59.000> clan

00:03:59.199 --> 00:03:59.209 
for that is to multiply your clan

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:01.390 
for that is to multiply your clan
obviously<00:03:59.750> so<00:04:00.020> it's<00:04:00.739> giving<00:04:01.040> you<00:04:01.100> the<00:04:01.220> option

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
obviously so it's giving you the option

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:02.830 
obviously so it's giving you the option
whether<00:04:01.700> you<00:04:01.850> want<00:04:02.000> to<00:04:02.060> multiply<00:04:02.180> your<00:04:02.510> clan

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
whether you want to multiply your clan

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.990 
whether you want to multiply your clan
or<00:04:02.959> use<00:04:03.140> one<00:04:03.290> just<00:04:03.500> king<00:04:03.709> 20<00:04:04.459> members<00:04:04.610> of<00:04:04.850> your

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.000 
or use one just king 20 members of your

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.510 
or use one just king 20 members of your
clan<00:04:05.120> and<00:04:05.870> go<00:04:06.200> through<00:04:06.440> 12<00:04:06.770> weeks<00:04:06.950> you<00:04:07.370> know

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:07.520 
clan and go through 12 weeks you know

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:09.280 
clan and go through 12 weeks you know
it's<00:04:07.670> entirely<00:04:08.180> up<00:04:08.390> to<00:04:08.600> you<00:04:08.720> but<00:04:08.900> i<00:04:08.959> think<00:04:09.170> as

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.290 
it's entirely up to you but i think as

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.370 
it's entirely up to you but i think as
you<00:04:09.320> go<00:04:09.590> through<00:04:09.920> it<00:04:10.600> and<00:04:11.600> you<00:04:11.780> multiply<00:04:11.959> your

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:12.380 
you go through it and you multiply your

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:14.199 
you go through it and you multiply your
12-week<00:04:12.830> you<00:04:13.220> want<00:04:13.370> to<00:04:13.430> multiply<00:04:13.550> your<00:04:13.910> clan

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:14.209 
12-week you want to multiply your clan

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:17.500 
12-week you want to multiply your clan
as<00:04:14.360> well<00:04:14.540> where<00:04:14.930> you<00:04:14.989> can<00:04:15.140> do<00:04:15.230> that<00:04:15.380> is<00:04:16.510> utilize

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:17.510 
as well where you can do that is utilize

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:19.840 
as well where you can do that is utilize
the<00:04:17.750> weapons<00:04:18.049> that<00:04:18.079> you<00:04:18.230> have<00:04:18.700> in<00:04:19.700> your

the weapons that you have in your
missions<00:04:22.690> okay<00:04:23.690> so<00:04:25.570> the<00:04:26.570> question<00:04:27.200> glitch<00:04:28.160> lag

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.370 
missions okay so the question glitch lag

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.820
