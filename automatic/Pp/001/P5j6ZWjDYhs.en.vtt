00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.109 
Arizona and and with the Pittsburgh
Steelers<00:01:29.840> well<00:01:30.840> I<00:01:30.869> think<00:01:31.020> in<00:01:31.890> terms<00:01:32.280> of<00:01:32.579> how

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
Steelers well I think in terms of how

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.210 
Steelers well I think in terms of how
they're<00:01:33.390> gonna<00:01:33.479> do<00:01:33.750> I<00:01:33.780> think<00:01:34.079> initially<00:01:34.409> it

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
they're gonna do I think initially it

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.300 
they're gonna do I think initially it
will<00:01:35.340> be<00:01:35.490> a<00:01:35.520> mix<00:01:35.939> and<00:01:36.210> it<00:01:36.329> will<00:01:36.450> be<00:01:36.600> a<00:01:36.630> blend<00:01:37.020> of

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
will be a mix and it will be a blend of

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.100 
will be a mix and it will be a blend of
things<00:01:38.310> that<00:01:38.520> Mariota<00:01:39.000> has<00:01:39.299> done<00:01:39.540> well<00:01:39.810> and

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
things that Mariota has done well and

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.560 
things that Mariota has done well and
things<00:01:40.799> that<00:01:41.009> was<00:01:41.250> not<00:01:41.520> like<00:01:41.790> do<00:01:42.180> that<00:01:42.390> he's

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
things that was not like do that he's

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.350 
things that was not like do that he's
comfortable<00:01:43.020> with<00:01:43.170> I<00:01:43.439> think<00:01:43.790> as<00:01:44.790> you<00:01:44.880> go

he's going to have to grow as the pocket
passer<00:02:11.400> over<00:02:11.730> time<00:02:11.970> and<00:02:12.300> the<00:02:12.900> older<00:02:13.260> you<00:02:13.290> get

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
passer over time and the older you get

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.010 
passer over time and the older you get
the<00:02:14.130> more<00:02:14.340> you<00:02:14.370> stay<00:02:14.700> in<00:02:14.820> the<00:02:14.940> pocket<00:02:15.180> and<00:02:15.900> you

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
the more you stay in the pocket and you

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.630 
the more you stay in the pocket and you
make<00:02:16.350> you<00:02:16.530> read<00:02:16.770> you<00:02:17.100> throw<00:02:17.310> the<00:02:17.460> football

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
make you read you throw the football

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.940 
make you read you throw the football
down<00:02:17.880> the<00:02:18.210> field<00:02:18.360> or<00:02:18.960> you<00:02:19.140> throw<00:02:19.410> it<00:02:19.560> away<00:02:19.650> if

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
down the field or you throw it away if

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.100 
down the field or you throw it away if
there's<00:02:20.100> no<00:02:20.340> no<00:02:20.880> one<00:02:21.120> opened<00:02:21.600> that<00:02:21.750> sort<00:02:22.050> of

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
there's no no one opened that sort of

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.410 
there's no no one opened that sort of
thing<00:02:22.170> but<00:02:22.710> I<00:02:22.770> think<00:02:23.010> initially<00:02:23.400> they<00:02:24.150> will

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
thing but I think initially they will

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.030 
thing but I think initially they will
allow<00:02:24.690> him<00:02:24.960> to<00:02:25.110> do<00:02:25.260> some<00:02:25.500> of<00:02:25.590> the<00:02:25.650> things<00:02:25.710> that

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
allow him to do some of the things that

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.010 
allow him to do some of the things that
he's<00:02:26.220> comfortable<00:02:26.670> with<00:02:26.790> some<00:02:27.510> elements<00:02:27.930> of

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
he's comfortable with some elements of

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.500 
he's comfortable with some elements of
the<00:02:28.170> spread<00:02:28.590> but<00:02:29.070> as<00:02:29.190> time<00:02:29.460> goes<00:02:29.730> on<00:02:29.970> I<00:02:30.300> think

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
the spread but as time goes on I think

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.120 
the spread but as time goes on I think
they<00:02:30.870> will<00:02:31.080> convert<00:02:31.500> him<00:02:31.650> to<00:02:31.680> more<00:02:31.980> of<00:02:32.040> a

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
they will convert him to more of a

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.190 
they will convert him to more of a
