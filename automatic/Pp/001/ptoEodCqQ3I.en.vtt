00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
we work on it after hours when we had

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.150 
we work on it after hours when we had
time<00:02:20.420> we<00:02:20.750> really<00:02:21.050> didn't<00:02:21.530> have<00:02:21.620> much<00:02:21.680> money<00:02:22.040> to

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
time we really didn't have much money to

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.740 
time we really didn't have much money to
put<00:02:22.400> towards<00:02:22.700> the<00:02:22.790> project<00:02:23.270> either<00:02:23.420> and

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
put towards the project either and

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.870 
put towards the project either and
really<00:02:24.140> the<00:02:24.260> focus<00:02:24.500> on<00:02:24.920> the<00:02:25.010> front<00:02:25.250> end<00:02:25.430> was<00:02:25.580> on

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
really the focus on the front end was on

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.000 
really the focus on the front end was on
intellectual<00:02:26.570> property<00:02:26.750> and<00:02:27.290> patents<00:02:27.830> and

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
intellectual property and patents and

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.550 
intellectual property and patents and
making<00:02:28.340> sure<00:02:28.550> you<00:02:29.390> know<00:02:29.510> that<00:02:29.540> was<00:02:29.960> really<00:02:30.530> the

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
making sure you know that was really the

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.170 
making sure you know that was really the
only<00:02:30.680> chance<00:02:31.070> we<00:02:31.250> have<00:02:31.280> was<00:02:31.610> making<00:02:31.880> sure<00:02:32.030> we

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
only chance we have was making sure we

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:33.910 
only chance we have was making sure we
had<00:02:32.330> a<00:02:32.360> really<00:02:32.600> strong<00:02:32.930> position<00:02:33.500> there<00:02:33.680> at

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
had a really strong position there at

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.610 
had a really strong position there at
this<00:02:34.130> time

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.839 

after<00:02:39.620> months<00:02:39.890> of<00:02:39.980> research<00:02:40.190> and<00:02:40.610> five

00:02:40.839 --> 00:02:40.849 
after months of research and five

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:43.539 
after months of research and five
prototypes<00:02:41.510> made<00:02:41.659> in<00:02:42.080> Brian's<00:02:42.530> garage<00:02:42.799> right

00:02:43.539 --> 00:02:43.549 
prototypes made in Brian's garage right

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:45.490 
prototypes made in Brian's garage right
and<00:02:43.790> Brian<00:02:44.000> discovered<00:02:44.540> that<00:02:44.659> the<00:02:44.810> creator<00:02:45.230> of

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
and Brian discovered that the creator of

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.770 
and Brian discovered that the creator of
the<00:02:45.739> elliptical<00:02:46.159> machine<00:02:46.430> Larry<00:02:46.819> Miller<00:02:47.090> held

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
the elliptical machine Larry Miller held

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.960 
the elliptical machine Larry Miller held
the<00:02:47.930> patent<00:02:48.260> for<00:02:48.500> the<00:02:48.530> sheer<00:02:48.950> emotion<00:02:49.730> of<00:02:49.909> the

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
the patent for the sheer emotion of the

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.240 
the patent for the sheer emotion of the
elliptical<00:02:50.629> Brent<00:02:51.349> and<00:02:51.440> Brian<00:02:51.650> thought<00:02:52.010> their

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
elliptical Brent and Brian thought their

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.640 
elliptical Brent and Brian thought their
bike<00:02:52.519> dreams<00:02:52.849> were<00:02:53.480> over<00:02:53.750> I<00:02:53.989> mean<00:02:54.500> I

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
bike dreams were over I mean I

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:56.350 
bike dreams were over I mean I
compressed<00:02:55.519> time<00:02:55.849> but<00:02:56.120> a<00:02:56.150> lot<00:02:56.330> of

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
compressed time but a lot of

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.690 
compressed time but a lot of
deliberation<00:02:56.720> months<00:02:57.709> went<00:02:57.950> by<00:02:58.040> and<00:02:58.160> just

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
deliberation months went by and just

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.970 
deliberation months went by and just
kind<00:02:59.090> of<00:02:59.180> worrying<00:02:59.930> about<00:03:00.080> whether<00:03:00.470> you<00:03:00.830> know

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
kind of worrying about whether you know

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.670 
kind of worrying about whether you know
this<00:03:01.700> whole<00:03:01.970> thing<00:03:02.209> was<00:03:02.330> dead<00:03:02.629> and<00:03:02.930> we<00:03:03.110> wasted

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
this whole thing was dead and we wasted

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.869 
this whole thing was dead and we wasted
time<00:03:03.920> and<00:03:04.269> then<00:03:05.269> one<00:03:05.629> day<00:03:05.810> I<00:03:05.840> think<00:03:05.989> you<00:03:06.410> know

00:03:06.869 --> 00:03:06.879 
time and then one day I think you know

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:10.780 
time and then one day I think you know
we<00:03:07.879> both<00:03:08.090> talked<00:03:08.420> about<00:03:08.690> it<00:03:08.870> and<00:03:09.430> and<00:03:10.430> it's

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
we both talked about it and and it's

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:13.509 
we both talked about it and and it's
just<00:03:10.940> like<00:03:11.150> the<00:03:11.299> contact<00:03:11.720> where<00:03:12.230> yeah<00:03:12.560> so<00:03:13.129> and

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 
this equipment was in my garage and this

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.289 
this equipment was in my garage and this
this<00:03:37.670> granite<00:03:38.269> countertop<00:03:38.989> was<00:03:39.319> a<00:03:39.349> was<00:03:40.220> a

this granite countertop was a was a

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:43.120 
this granite countertop was a was a
budget<00:03:41.299> way<00:03:41.690> of<00:03:41.900> having<00:03:42.049> an<00:03:42.319> inspection<00:03:42.650> table

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
budget way of having an inspection table

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:45.670 
budget way of having an inspection table
to<00:03:43.340> really<00:03:43.609> flat<00:03:43.880> surface<00:03:44.359> for<00:03:45.319> checking

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
to really flat surface for checking

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.460 
to really flat surface for checking
parts<00:03:46.010> and<00:03:46.190> checking<00:03:46.519> welded<00:03:46.880> frames<00:03:47.180> all<00:03:48.169> the

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
parts and checking welded frames all the

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:49.990 
parts and checking welded frames all the
rest<00:03:48.680> of<00:03:48.799> the<00:03:48.919> equipment<00:03:49.099> in<00:03:49.400> here<00:03:49.430> the<00:03:49.730> saws

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
rest of the equipment in here the saws

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.059 
rest of the equipment in here the saws
and<00:03:50.480> knowing<00:03:50.870> machines<00:03:51.230> are<00:03:51.470> what<00:03:51.709> was

00:03:52.059 --> 00:03:52.069 
and knowing machines are what was

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:53.680 
and knowing machines are what was
actually<00:03:52.459> used<00:03:52.730> to<00:03:52.910> make<00:03:53.090> the<00:03:53.239> first<00:03:53.480> two

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
actually used to make the first two

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:56.229 
actually used to make the first two
prototypes<00:03:54.260> this<00:03:54.889> is<00:03:55.099> the<00:03:55.250> R&amp;D<00:03:55.669> department

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239 
prototypes this is the R&amp;D department

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:57.909 
prototypes this is the R&amp;D department
and<00:03:56.419> so<00:03:56.690> everything<00:03:56.930> is<00:03:57.109> designed<00:03:57.260> here<00:03:57.799> in

00:03:57.909 --> 00:03:57.919 
and so everything is designed here in

00:03:57.919 --> 00:04:01.150 
and so everything is designed here in
the<00:03:58.010> US<00:03:58.310> by<00:03:58.549> myself<00:03:59.000> and<00:03:59.329> our<00:03:59.959> R&amp;D<00:04:00.260> team<00:04:00.829> here

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:01.160 
the US by myself and our R&amp;D team here

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.970 
the US by myself and our R&amp;D team here
we<00:04:01.970> spend<00:04:02.269> countless<00:04:02.480> hours<00:04:02.690> on<00:04:03.380> the<00:04:03.530> computer

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:03.980 
we spend countless hours on the computer

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.099 
we spend countless hours on the computer
and<00:04:04.130> really<00:04:04.669> what<00:04:04.849> we're<00:04:05.000> looking<00:04:05.299> at<00:04:05.450> here<00:04:05.510> is

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:06.109 
and really what we're looking at here is

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:09.640 
and really what we're looking at here is
a<00:04:06.620> program<00:04:07.130> called<00:04:07.370> SolidWorks<00:04:08.090> and<00:04:08.650> we

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:09.650 
a program called SolidWorks and we

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:11.710 
a program called SolidWorks and we
design<00:04:10.010> everything<00:04:10.430> in<00:04:10.730> SolidWorks<00:04:11.329> so<00:04:11.569> it's

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:11.720 
design everything in SolidWorks so it's

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.020

stiffness and weight as well as is

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.779 
stiffness and weight as well as is
you're<00:04:55.629> able<00:04:55.750> to<00:04:56.020> make<00:04:56.229> nicer<00:04:57.069> looking<00:04:57.400> shapes

00:04:57.779 --> 00:04:57.789 
you're able to make nicer looking shapes

00:04:57.789 --> 00:04:59.939 
you're able to make nicer looking shapes
so<00:04:58.090> these<00:04:58.210> nice<00:04:58.509> sweeping<00:04:59.050> shapes<00:04:59.409> and<00:04:59.770> neck

00:04:59.939 --> 00:04:59.949 
so these nice sweeping shapes and neck

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:02.309 
so these nice sweeping shapes and neck
and<00:05:00.129> mold<00:05:00.340> very<00:05:01.330> cool<00:05:01.569> shades<00:05:01.840> and<00:05:02.169> that's

00:05:02.309 --> 00:05:02.319 
and mold very cool shades and that's

00:05:02.319 --> 00:05:04.249 
and mold very cool shades and that's
throughout<00:05:03.009> the<00:05:03.189> bike<00:05:03.430> that's<00:05:03.789> really

00:05:04.249 --> 00:05:04.259 
throughout the bike that's really

00:05:04.259 --> 00:05:07.260 
throughout the bike that's really
tooling<00:05:05.259> up<00:05:05.409> a<00:05:05.800> production<00:05:06.400> product<00:05:07.060> and

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:07.270 
tooling up a production product and

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:09.029 
tooling up a production product and
spending<00:05:07.659> money<00:05:07.900> on<00:05:08.020> tooling<00:05:08.590> and<00:05:08.740> going<00:05:08.949> to

00:05:09.029 --> 00:05:09.039 
spending money on tooling and going to

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:10.619 
spending money on tooling and going to
taiwan<00:05:09.250> allows<00:05:09.759> us<00:05:09.969> to<00:05:10.150> make<00:05:10.300> all<00:05:10.479> these

00:05:10.619 --> 00:05:10.629 
taiwan allows us to make all these

00:05:10.629 --> 00:05:12.719 
taiwan allows us to make all these
really<00:05:10.990> nice<00:05:11.169> sweeping<00:05:11.800> shapes<00:05:12.129> i<00:05:12.430> put<00:05:12.610> the

00:05:12.719 --> 00:05:12.729 
really nice sweeping shapes i put the

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:15.119 
really nice sweeping shapes i put the
CLE<00:05:12.939> shaped<00:05:13.210> tubes<00:05:13.569> and<00:05:14.080> just<00:05:14.529> matter<00:05:14.710> did<00:05:14.979> you

00:05:15.119 --> 00:05:15.129 
CLE shaped tubes and just matter did you

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:16.980 
CLE shaped tubes and just matter did you
know<00:05:15.340> that<00:05:15.580> did<00:05:15.879> you<00:05:15.909> know<00:05:16.150> the<00:05:16.509> material<00:05:16.659> that

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:16.990 
know that did you know the material that

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:19.439 
know that did you know the material that
you'd<00:05:17.199> need<00:05:17.500> to<00:05:17.710> use<00:05:17.949> to<00:05:18.370> get<00:05:18.520> the<00:05:18.669> shapes<00:05:18.939> or

00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:19.449 
you'd need to use to get the shapes or

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:21.300 
you'd need to use to get the shapes or
did<00:05:19.569> you<00:05:19.659> design<00:05:19.960> and<00:05:20.199> then<00:05:20.319> go<00:05:20.469> ok<00:05:20.740> so<00:05:20.800> we<00:05:21.189> got

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:21.310 
did you design and then go ok so we got

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:23.700 
did you design and then go ok so we got
to<00:05:21.430> find<00:05:21.639> what'll<00:05:22.270> fit<00:05:22.509> for<00:05:22.900> that<00:05:23.020> and<00:05:23.289> make<00:05:23.560> it

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:23.710 
to find what'll fit for that and make it

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:26.610 
to find what'll fit for that and make it
not<00:05:23.860> weigh<00:05:24.009> 160<00:05:24.909> pounds<00:05:24.939> it's<00:05:25.389> really<00:05:25.659> a<00:05:25.810> bit

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:26.620 
not weigh 160 pounds it's really a bit

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:29.189 
not weigh 160 pounds it's really a bit
of<00:05:26.770> back<00:05:27.009> and<00:05:27.219> forth<00:05:27.279> you<00:05:27.849> know<00:05:27.879> the<00:05:28.479> processes

00:05:29.189 --> 00:05:29.199 
of back and forth you know the processes

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:31.170 
of back and forth you know the processes
that<00:05:29.469> you're<00:05:29.919> going<00:05:30.039> to<00:05:30.099> use<00:05:30.279> welding<00:05:30.819> or<00:05:31.000> that

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:31.180 
that you're going to use welding or that

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:32.670 
that you're going to use welding or that
you're<00:05:31.330> going<00:05:31.419> to<00:05:31.479> use<00:05:31.569> an<00:05:31.870> extrusion<00:05:32.289> for<00:05:32.650> a

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:32.680 
you're going to use an extrusion for a

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.019 
you're going to use an extrusion for a
certain<00:05:32.919> type<00:05:33.099> of<00:05:33.129> material<00:05:33.580> that<00:05:33.610> often

00:05:34.019 --> 00:05:34.029 
certain type of material that often

00:05:34.029 --> 00:05:35.909 
certain type of material that often
dictates<00:05:34.449> the<00:05:34.599> material<00:05:35.110> you<00:05:35.259> use<00:05:35.500> and<00:05:35.800> then

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:35.919 
dictates the material you use and then

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:38.459 
dictates the material you use and then
most<00:05:36.610> of<00:05:36.759> the<00:05:36.879> time<00:05:37.120> you<00:05:37.539> know<00:05:37.779> going<00:05:38.110> into<00:05:38.379> it

00:05:38.459 --> 00:05:38.469 
most of the time you know going into it

00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:40.830 
most of the time you know going into it
when<00:05:38.740> you<00:05:38.830> design<00:05:39.219> what<00:05:39.669> materials<00:05:40.150> well

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:40.840 
when you design what materials well

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:41.969 
when you design what materials well
that's<00:05:40.990> why<00:05:41.139> you're<00:05:41.319> here<00:05:41.379> because<00:05:41.650> you're

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:41.979 
that's why you're here because you're

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:43.890 
that's why you're here because you're
the<00:05:42.069> engineer<00:05:42.219> what<00:05:42.969> surprise<00:05:43.300> you're<00:05:43.330> so<00:05:43.629> far

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:43.900 
the engineer what surprise you're so far

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:47.879 
the engineer what surprise you're so far
um<00:05:44.560> I<00:05:45.430> think<00:05:46.360> just<00:05:47.080> the<00:05:47.169> progression<00:05:47.800> of

00:05:47.879 --> 00:05:47.889 
um I think just the progression of

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:51.240 
um I think just the progression of
things<00:05:47.949> and<00:05:48.520> just<00:05:48.699> even<00:05:48.940> looking<00:05:49.449> back<00:05:49.690> a<00:05:50.589> year

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:51.250 
things and just even looking back a year

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:53.219 
things and just even looking back a year
and<00:05:51.460> a<00:05:51.490> half<00:05:51.669> ago<00:05:51.849> and<00:05:52.240> saying<00:05:52.750> that<00:05:52.900> we'd<00:05:53.080> be

00:05:53.219 --> 00:05:53.229 
and a half ago and saying that we'd be

00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:56.430 
and a half ago and saying that we'd be
at<00:05:53.319> this<00:05:53.469> point<00:05:53.800> I<00:05:54.099> I<00:05:54.940> couldn't<00:05:55.930> so<00:05:56.110> things

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:56.440 
at this point I I couldn't so things

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:58.769 
at this point I I couldn't so things
have<00:05:56.620> really<00:05:57.190> accelerated<00:05:58.089> in<00:05:58.210> the<00:05:58.300> last<00:05:58.509> two

00:05:58.769 --> 00:05:58.779 
have really accelerated in the last two

00:05:58.779 --> 00:06:00.480 
have really accelerated in the last two
years<00:05:58.810> and<00:05:59.349> I<00:05:59.710> know<00:05:59.770> more<00:06:00.099> than<00:06:00.159> you<00:06:00.279> thought

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:00.490 
years and I know more than you thought

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:01.800 
years and I know more than you thought
usually<00:06:00.879> hear<00:06:01.089> the<00:06:01.120> opposite<00:06:01.659> of<00:06:01.690> your

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:01.810 
usually hear the opposite of your

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:04.800 
usually hear the opposite of your
valiant<00:06:02.199> takes<00:06:02.409> how<00:06:02.650> much<00:06:02.830> time<00:06:03.120> does<00:06:04.120> it<00:06:04.479> does

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:04.810 
valiant takes how much time does it does

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:07.170 
valiant takes how much time does it does
in<00:06:05.080> one<00:06:05.289> sense<00:06:05.650> but<00:06:06.219> I<00:06:06.460> mean<00:06:06.610> to<00:06:06.789> the<00:06:06.909> point

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:07.180 
in one sense but I mean to the point

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:08.850 
in one sense but I mean to the point
where<00:06:07.419> we<00:06:07.599> actually<00:06:07.750> have<00:06:08.110> customer<00:06:08.620> on<00:06:08.710> the

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:08.860 
where we actually have customer on the

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:11.279 
where we actually have customer on the
product<00:06:09.310> or<00:06:09.430> product<00:06:10.240> out<00:06:10.360> to<00:06:10.599> our<00:06:10.719> customers

product or product out to our customers

00:06:11.289 --> 00:06:13.890 
product or product out to our customers
