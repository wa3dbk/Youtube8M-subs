oh my eyes I forget those sharp stabbing
pains<00:05:35.840> when<00:05:35.990> I<00:05:36.080> blink<00:05:36.260> so<00:05:36.500> it's<00:05:36.650> just<00:05:36.800> not

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:36.919 
pains when I blink so it's just not

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:38.700 
pains when I blink so it's just not
worth<00:05:37.099> it<00:05:37.279> sharp<00:05:37.700> stabbing<00:05:38.000> pains<00:05:38.360> yeah

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:38.710 
worth it sharp stabbing pains yeah

Waxler<00:05:39.710> says<00:05:40.010> the<00:05:40.190> industry<00:05:40.490> just<00:05:40.940> isn't

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:41.360 
Waxler says the industry just isn't

cutting the cornea not cutting a piece

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:47.260 
cutting the cornea not cutting a piece
of<00:05:45.320> plastic<00:05:45.800> you're<00:05:46.070> cutting<00:05:46.460> a<00:05:46.639> live<00:05:46.969> tissue

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:47.270

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:50.330 
so no matter how you cut it you're

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:52.750
