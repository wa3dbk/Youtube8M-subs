00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.240 
get seven optimizer if you are first oh
of<00:01:00.570> course<00:01:00.600> you<00:01:00.930> take<00:01:01.109> booster<00:01:01.590> force<00:01:01.859> and<00:01:02.129> an

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
these other programs are all into these

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.780 
these other programs are all into these
three<00:01:09.150> so<00:01:09.720> that's<00:01:09.900> why<00:01:10.020> I<00:01:10.049> just<00:01:10.229> chose<00:01:10.770> MZ<00:01:11.159> 7

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
three so that's why I just chose MZ 7

computer<00:03:02.900> first<00:03:03.290> just<00:03:03.620> in<00:03:03.770> case<00:03:04.120> but<00:03:06.250> but<00:03:07.250> you

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
computer first just in case but but you

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.670 
computer first just in case but but you
can<00:03:07.459> also<00:03:07.630> Butler<00:03:08.630> on<00:03:08.780> it<00:03:08.930> it's<00:03:09.140> not<00:03:09.170> up<00:03:09.470> to<00:03:09.500> you

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:14.240 
but I recommend it absolute you just go

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
but I recommend it absolute you just go
to<00:03:14.300> apply<00:03:14.660> tweaks<00:03:15.020> and<00:03:15.440> you<00:03:15.620> are<00:03:15.770> done
