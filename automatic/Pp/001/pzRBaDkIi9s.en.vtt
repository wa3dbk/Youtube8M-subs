00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.470
 I short and painfully short you 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.290
 painless her minecraft more ram 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.059
 can assign there is the power room 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.940
 launcher is no longer possible and 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.650
 crafter also a little speck show 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.840
 I'll give you that very comfortable and 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.000
 comfortable so first we do what 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.710
 love our minecraft exe where too 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.920
 always you have documents in the folder 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:29.099
 so empty here documents and so or 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.990
 or europe twitter for yours 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:35.430
 great hard drive and then luther and 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:38.790
 then your name and then your own documents 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.620
 and then we have it so we do that 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.629
 but are so on the folder 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.640
 documents then we create a text 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.469
 document for the first time always the 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.910
 minecraft ex-club with his hit 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.930
 minecraft got but i believe then 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:56.550
 this is also going strong then 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:58.140
 Do your new text document that way 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.280
 open the text document and then 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:05.600
 writes followed by purely 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:05.600
 So yes, I have ours here now 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.619
 and that the same thing 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.119
 you can also find in the video 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.220
 You can describe this here 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.189
 specify how much ram you wanted to have 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.390
 just gone here 

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:21.060
 Here you can specify how much 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.250
 ram you want and it is here 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.450
 a megabyte eg 2048 mb 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:31.229
 then you have to specify that here 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:36.960
 about 3gb 2 730 or x 2048 or us 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:39.030
 Just do 1012 1012 and then 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.170
 here again not 1024 but 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:45.299
 1012 we are more conservative 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:47.670
 set 1012 megabyte ram then go 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:50.390
 we save on file under then go 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:53.220
 For example, 1 1 gigabyte launcher 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:55.259
 or something like that does not matter 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.960
 and took off then we go downstairs 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:00.570
 all files and behind our names 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.320
 write jetzt.de so points butt 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.140
 so to speak 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:06.210
 we go to storage even me 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.610
 to the old ex text document that needs 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.340
 You do not really want that anymore because of that 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.750
 actually learn and then one man 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.630
 just give this a gigabyte lounge or 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.700
 2gb 3g after you mentioned that 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.110
 and already starts our minecraft excel 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.180
 However, I want to login 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:23.750
 I'll make it big with us 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:27.410
 see over there, too 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:30.350
 the whole things was just as online 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:34.459
 before our time beautiful lab so and then 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:37.160
 We look at F3 for how much we ram 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:38.740
 assigned the last minecraft 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.750
 when the time comes 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:47.900
 Exactly and now we see the corner above 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:49.489
 right top of the corner 899 mb good that 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.010
 We want to have it too 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:53.720
 anytime here that does not start 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.090
 By the way, with time, you can easily 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:59.630
 close when minecraft finished we are 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:02.450
 can also at any time, for example, 4,000 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:07.120
 mw or have something 4000 then need 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:09.860
 stop at both here 4000 write 4000 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.510
 we do not need this up here 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.709
 really only need this line echo 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.500
 then this one 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:19.630
 Minecraft copy and a break and 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:22.340
 then save company x 4gb 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:31.810
 Launcher or something does not matter 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:31.810
 shit and took you could rabbit 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:37.630
 and then very important point b so point 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:40.330
 save bath 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:42.769
 then rabbit can open here 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:47.120
 neither will start again with 4000 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:53.060
 megabyte ram then go back login 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:56.010
 the usual when we get up here 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:04:00.210
 Only normal game then start 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:02.360
 Let's wait and then that's it 

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:07.020
 stop always open that does not matter 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:11.280
 so and then we see above the corner 3555 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:14.460
 mb minecraft with just under 4,000 mb so 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:16.350
 a kind of love was not 

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:17.850
 i hope i could help you us 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:21.079
 asking questions simply recognizes the 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:21.079
 shit until next time pick
