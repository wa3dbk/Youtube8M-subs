00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:30.990 
being a gymnast champion gymnast in any
way<00:03:29.739> did<00:03:29.860> that<00:03:29.920> help<00:03:30.220> you<00:03:30.340> prepare<00:03:30.489> to<00:03:30.790> become

way did that help you prepare to become
a<00:03:31.030> doctor<00:03:31.269> here<00:03:31.690> um<00:03:32.170> well<00:03:32.530> I<00:03:32.560> think<00:03:32.709> definitely

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:32.890 
a doctor here um well I think definitely

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:34.500 
a doctor here um well I think definitely
the<00:03:33.370> amount<00:03:33.580> of<00:03:33.670> hard<00:03:33.849> work<00:03:34.000> that<00:03:34.030> goes<00:03:34.180> into

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
the amount of hard work that goes into

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.960 
the amount of hard work that goes into
being<00:03:34.599> a<00:03:35.049> gymnast<00:03:35.440> is<00:03:35.590> similar<00:03:35.830> to<00:03:36.010> what<00:03:36.519> hard

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
being a gymnast is similar to what hard

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:38.819 
being a gymnast is similar to what hard
work<00:03:37.030> needs<00:03:37.330> to<00:03:37.420> go<00:03:37.540> into<00:03:37.720> becoming<00:03:38.319> a<00:03:38.500> doctor

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:38.829 
work needs to go into becoming a doctor

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:41.069 
work needs to go into becoming a doctor
so<00:03:39.280> I<00:03:39.340> think<00:03:39.430> that<00:03:39.610> definitely<00:03:39.790> helped<00:03:40.390> as

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:41.079 
so I think that definitely helped as

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:43.140 
so I think that definitely helped as
well<00:03:41.140> as<00:03:41.920> you<00:03:42.099> know<00:03:42.220> the<00:03:42.340> times<00:03:42.549> were<00:03:42.730> that<00:03:43.060> are
