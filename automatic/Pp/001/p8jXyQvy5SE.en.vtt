00:00:00.699 --> 00:00:05.859
 hi to all of you guys i'm always sick today i'll tell you ironing a little bit like 

00:00:05.859 --> 00:00:09.839
 convert a dvx to dvx the weather I speak 

00:00:09.839 --> 00:00:13.869
 the simplest pendulum is a simpler pendulum 

00:00:13.869 --> 00:00:18.550
 that we know very well big but ima n maria instead of about 4 gig 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:23.429
 7 heaven from you I watch 600 mega straw up to 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.149
 ne history one and half jig 

00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:28.800
 a parent 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.500
 nah. to start the program we need to convert leini dvd converter 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:34.910
 professional 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:40.120
 program that finds self occupied about an hour long ago 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.070
 only on 3ds italia meteo 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.080
 so we'll see eventually 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.080
 clicking on the stream how to write 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.050
 xd 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.050
 we will find create 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:01.210
 as soon as I try busy increases in the DVD converter professional 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.860
 I already had the 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.040
 the program 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.380
 so at this point 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.450
 at this point after downloading the program for the summer side we can 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:15.570
 get it started 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.299
 I have already taken steps to insert a DVD into my computer 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.640
 obviously opening the program 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.900
 born in the program this is the first screen that will ask you then 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.620
 we try to open it again 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:33.620
 so this problem before screen magnify 

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:38.400
 of course, you too have already taken steps to insert DVDs inside 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.480
 of marvel in my burner 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.440
 at this point I have to click on ape tvb 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.280
 select the source now let's see the other points 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.120
 set on the section does 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:55.200
 we come ok 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.110
 at this point it makes me know that the DVD - this is the title that eventually 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:01.520
 anyway 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.590
 head but do not vary 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:09.549
 so at this point we see that the name of the new tribute tel. wind - 31 

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:13.790
 the duration the format that is currently the video size 

00:02:14.719 --> 00:02:18.889
 this point what sentences need to be done is very simple a lot too yeah 

00:02:18.889 --> 00:02:21.209
 very simple to use the program 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:25.219
 from here I can set therefore what will be the push ita video 

00:02:25.219 --> 00:02:28.810
 so what we're going to convert ours is ours 

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:31.809
 currently formed is a DVD 

00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:35.919
 if we have to convert it to dvx 

00:02:35.919 --> 00:02:40.059
 colosseum model there are several and to different formats to come out therefore different 

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:45.569
 output what if we want to convert to dvx we have to go to select 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:48.249
 custom avid movie 

00:02:48.249 --> 00:02:50.479
 that we know very well that just 

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:53.680
 puyol a dvx here is an abi format 

00:02:54.429 --> 00:02:57.889
 this point we must only possibly because 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:01.229
 go to click on convert 

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:04.669
 then click on convert 

00:03:04.669 --> 00:03:09.949
 and as you can see my pc is starting to do the conversion 

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:12.949
 therefore rituality will always remain the same 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:17.720
 not the size even in the picture then 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.720
 and video sizes will always remain the same 

00:03:22.619 --> 00:03:25.999
 as soon as the conversion is finished 

00:03:25.999 --> 00:03:29.709
 the program will give us both a confirmed and a confirmed one 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:33.499
 at this point I'm the one because I've already done the procedure 

00:03:33.499 --> 00:03:37.569
 so at this point we could go studentville 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:39.409
 program 

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:42.969
 bring in documents because the program automatically creates a 

00:03:42.969 --> 00:03:45.969
 folder called mini dvd converter professional 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:50.979
 going into the jac vanek folder they created us is an abi file 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:54.919
 and let's see 3 this was what I did 

00:03:54.919 --> 00:03:59.499
 that our for libra on dvd has become a life at this point 

00:03:59.499 --> 00:04:02.189
 we can talk 

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:05.799
 as a dvx ee therefore the size is much smaller than 

00:04:06.469 --> 00:04:07.659
 has a dvd 

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:11.109
 with a lot of dog menu all the rest there are 4 gig 

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:15.769
 I hope I was clear if there are any questions you can 

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:19.310
 do directly I will try to answer you as soon as possible thank you
