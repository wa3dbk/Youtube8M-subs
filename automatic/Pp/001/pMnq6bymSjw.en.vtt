things and I was able to hear really
pretty<00:02:03.799> well<00:02:04.039> but<00:02:04.369> I<00:02:04.520> thought<00:02:04.789> it<00:02:04.939> was<00:02:05.119> just<00:02:05.450> me

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:06.259 
pretty well but I thought it was just me

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:08.080 
pretty well but I thought it was just me
knowing<00:02:07.009> what<00:02:07.159> he<00:02:07.280> was<00:02:07.399> going<00:02:07.520> to<00:02:07.610> ask<00:02:07.759> him<00:02:07.970> to

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
knowing what he was going to ask him to

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:09.460 
knowing what he was going to ask him to
say<00:02:08.239> because<00:02:08.479> he<00:02:08.599> asked<00:02:08.810> him<00:02:08.899> to<00:02:09.019> say<00:02:09.170> the<00:02:09.289> same

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
say because he asked him to say the same

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.440 
say because he asked him to say the same
things<00:02:09.830> I<00:02:10.130> thought<00:02:10.670> well<00:02:10.849> maybe<00:02:10.880> it's<00:02:11.269> just

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
things I thought well maybe it's just

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.590 
things I thought well maybe it's just
how<00:02:11.660> that<00:02:11.870> I<00:02:11.900> know<00:02:12.019> what<00:02:12.410> he's<00:02:12.530> gonna

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
how that I know what he's gonna

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.530 
how that I know what he's gonna
so<00:02:13.960> I<00:02:13.990> was<00:02:14.200> just<00:02:14.230> starting<00:02:15.190> to<00:02:15.220> think<00:02:15.430> he<00:02:16.360> needs

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
so I was just starting to think he needs

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.390 
so I was just starting to think he needs
asking<00:02:16.990> something<00:02:17.170> else<00:02:17.470> because<00:02:17.770> he's<00:02:18.130> been

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
asking something else because he's been

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.070 
asking something else because he's been
asking<00:02:18.850> me<00:02:18.970> to<00:02:19.000> repeat<00:02:19.420> the<00:02:19.570> same<00:02:19.780> things

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
asking me to repeat the same things

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.830 
asking me to repeat the same things
right<00:02:20.980> when<00:02:21.130> I<00:02:21.280> thought<00:02:21.460> that<00:02:21.700> Hugh<00:02:22.270> the<00:02:22.570> last
