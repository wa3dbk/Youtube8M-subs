the power that's coming towards us as we

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.330 
the power that's coming towards us as we

I<00:01:20.700> like<00:01:20.880> to<00:01:20.909> see<00:01:21.659> it<00:01:21.780> as<00:01:21.979> the<00:01:22.979> fact<00:01:23.189> that<00:01:23.250> we<00:01:23.400> are

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
I like to see it as the fact that we are

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.880 
I like to see it as the fact that we are
evolving<00:01:23.939> we're<00:01:24.509> coming<00:01:24.810> into<00:01:24.960> our<00:01:25.080> power<00:01:25.530> in

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
evolving we're coming into our power in

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.219 
evolving we're coming into our power in
a<00:01:25.979> new<00:01:26.189> way<00:01:26.400> we<00:01:27.030> have<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.330> ability<00:01:27.900> to

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
a new way we have the ability to

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.429 
a new way we have the ability to
suddenly<00:01:29.159> cosmically<00:01:29.880> order<00:01:30.299> to<00:01:30.840> transform

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
suddenly cosmically order to transform

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.069 
suddenly cosmically order to transform
our<00:01:31.799> reality<00:01:32.369> just<00:01:32.549> by<00:01:32.700> thinking<00:01:32.840> and<00:01:33.840> even

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
our reality just by thinking and even

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.780 
our reality just by thinking and even
scientists<00:01:34.680> are<00:01:34.860> starting<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.159> realize<00:01:35.579> that

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
scientists are starting to realize that

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.179 
scientists are starting to realize that
this<00:01:35.909> is<00:01:36.210> in<00:01:36.479> fact<00:01:36.509> true<00:01:37.110> and<00:01:37.380> that<00:01:38.040> we<00:01:38.159> have

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
this is in fact true and that we have

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.010 
this is in fact true and that we have
far<00:01:38.759> more<00:01:38.790> abilities<00:01:39.329> than<00:01:39.360> we've<00:01:39.659> realized

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
far more abilities than we've realized

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.010 
far more abilities than we've realized
and<00:01:40.290> life<00:01:40.650> has<00:01:41.460> far<00:01:41.759> more<00:01:41.790> unusual<00:01:42.540> things

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
and life has far more unusual things

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.649 
and life has far more unusual things
about<00:01:43.950> it<00:01:44.189> than<00:01:44.340> we<00:01:44.460> realize<00:01:44.850> that<00:01:45.210> time

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
about it than we realize that time

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.319 
about it than we realize that time
doesn't<00:01:46.020> exist<00:01:46.079> for<00:01:46.470> instance<00:01:46.829> that<00:01:47.430> perhaps

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
doesn't exist for instance that perhaps

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.389 
doesn't exist for instance that perhaps
the<00:01:48.869> way<00:01:49.020> psychic<00:01:49.439> ability<00:01:49.799> works<00:01:50.040> is<00:01:50.340> that

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
the way psychic ability works is that

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:51.980 
the way psychic ability works is that
people<00:01:50.850> are<00:01:50.939> actually<00:01:51.060> tuning<00:01:51.659> in<00:01:51.750> to<00:01:51.899> the

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
people are actually tuning in to the
