the nasal allergies the coughing the

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.590 
the nasal allergies the coughing the
congestion<00:00:38.160> they<00:00:38.520> basically<00:00:38.879> all<00:00:39.180> work<00:00:39.450> from

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
congestion they basically all work from

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.720 
congestion they basically all work from
the<00:00:39.750> same<00:00:39.930> process<00:00:40.440> essentially<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.430> body<00:00:41.610> is

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
the same process essentially the body is

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.369 
the same process essentially the body is
exposed<00:00:42.090> to<00:00:42.270> some<00:00:42.510> type<00:00:42.690> of<00:00:42.719> allergen<00:00:43.200> this

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
exposed to some type of allergen this

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.290 
exposed to some type of allergen this
type<00:00:43.590> of<00:00:43.620> year<00:00:43.950> is<00:00:44.160> usually<00:00:44.370> pollen<00:00:45.030> from<00:00:45.180> the

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
type of year is usually pollen from the

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.549 
type of year is usually pollen from the
trees<00:00:45.539> and<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:45.809> grasses<00:00:46.170> that<00:00:46.200> are<00:00:46.379> blooming

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
trees and the grasses that are blooming

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.799 
trees and the grasses that are blooming
and<00:00:46.920> our<00:00:47.460> body<00:00:47.640> could<00:00:47.879> have<00:00:47.969> over<00:00:48.239> reacts<00:00:48.570> to

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
and our body could have over reacts to

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.810 
and our body could have over reacts to
that<00:00:48.930> allergenic<00:00:49.469> senses<00:00:50.190> that<00:00:50.309> it's<00:00:50.460> in<00:00:50.610> some

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
that allergenic senses that it's in some

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.400 
that allergenic senses that it's in some
type<00:00:51.030> of<00:00:51.059> danger<00:00:51.600> and<00:00:51.719> sends<00:00:52.020> a<00:00:52.079> flood<00:00:52.379> of

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
type of danger and sends a flood of

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.560 
type of danger and sends a flood of
immune<00:00:52.800> system<00:00:53.190> cells<00:00:53.399> to<00:00:53.820> fight<00:00:54.000> that<00:00:54.270> and

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
immune system cells to fight that and

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.689 
immune system cells to fight that and
that<00:00:55.289> overreaction<00:00:55.980> causes<00:00:56.399> all<00:00:56.520> of<00:00:56.610> our

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
that overreaction causes all of our

that overreaction causes all of our
allergy<00:00:57.000> symptoms<00:00:57.449> can<00:00:57.690> you<00:00:57.840> have<00:00:58.079> allergies

worse for two reasons whatever that
allergen<00:01:26.490> is<00:01:26.670> can<00:01:26.970> become<00:01:27.210> embedded<00:01:27.509> in<00:01:27.750> the

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
allergen is can become embedded in the

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.810 
allergen is can become embedded in the
contact<00:01:27.869> lens<00:01:28.470> and<00:01:28.740> then<00:01:29.159> you<00:01:29.280> become<00:01:29.520> kind<00:01:29.759> of

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
contact lens and then you become kind of

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.700 
contact lens and then you become kind of
doubly<00:01:30.210> exposed<00:01:30.630> to<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.020> initial<00:01:31.380> exposure

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
doubly exposed to the initial exposure

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.319 
doubly exposed to the initial exposure
and<00:01:31.979> then<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.189> repeated<00:01:32.700> exposure<00:01:33.060> on<00:01:33.240> the

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
and then the repeated exposure on the

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.300 
and then the repeated exposure on the
contact<00:01:33.750> lens<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.560> second<00:01:34.890> reason<00:01:35.040> why<00:01:35.189> it

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
contact lens the second reason why it

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.740 
contact lens the second reason why it
gets<00:01:35.520> a<00:01:35.579> little<00:01:35.670> worse<00:01:35.909> is<00:01:36.150> that<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.360> eyelid

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
gets a little worse is that the eyelid

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.450

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
possible although sometimes that's

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:05.690 
possible although sometimes that's
easier<00:03:04.890> said<00:03:05.280> than<00:03:05.430> done

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700

the<00:03:06.120> air<00:03:06.239> conditioner<00:03:06.780> can<00:03:07.049> help<00:03:07.349> but<00:03:07.859> you're

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
the air conditioner can help but you're

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.319 
the air conditioner can help but you're
probably<00:03:08.220> still<00:03:08.489> going<00:03:08.640> to<00:03:08.700> be<00:03:08.760> exposed<00:03:09.120> at

probably still going to be exposed at
some<00:03:09.569> level<00:03:09.870> and<00:03:09.989> that's<00:03:10.109> when<00:03:10.260> we<00:03:10.379> need<00:03:10.470> to

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
some level and that's when we need to

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.229 
some level and that's when we need to
turn<00:03:10.739> to<00:03:10.769> the<00:03:10.950> medications<00:03:11.430> don't<00:03:11.970> rub<00:03:12.209> your

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
turn to the medications don't rub your

turn to the medications don't rub your
eyes<00:03:12.420> even<00:03:12.930> though<00:03:12.989> it<00:03:13.109> feels<00:03:13.319> good<00:03:13.560> to<00:03:13.739> do<00:03:13.890> so

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:14.069 
eyes even though it feels good to do so

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:15.860 
eyes even though it feels good to do so
that<00:03:14.549> causes<00:03:15.000> more<00:03:15.180> histamine<00:03:15.630> to<00:03:15.750> be

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
that causes more histamine to be

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.360 
that causes more histamine to be
released<00:03:16.169> by<00:03:16.380> those<00:03:16.560> immune<00:03:16.859> cells<00:03:17.160> and

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
released by those immune cells and

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:18.710 
released by those immune cells and
causes<00:03:17.730> the<00:03:17.819> reaction<00:03:18.180> to<00:03:18.239> actually<00:03:18.450> be<00:03:18.540> worse

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
causes the reaction to actually be worse

you're rubbing your eye you're actually

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:24.559 
you're rubbing your eye you're actually
releasing<00:03:22.769> what<00:03:23.190> the<00:03:23.340> right<00:03:24.000> the<00:03:24.209> white<00:03:24.389> blood

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:24.569 
releasing what the right the white blood

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:26.360 
releasing what the right the white blood
cells<00:03:24.630> that<00:03:25.109> come<00:03:25.319> to<00:03:25.470> fight<00:03:25.680> the<00:03:25.859> allergen

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
cells that come to fight the allergen

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.280 
cells that come to fight the allergen
release<00:03:26.880> more<00:03:27.209> of<00:03:27.329> those<00:03:27.450> chemicals<00:03:28.079> that

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
release more of those chemicals that

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.440 
release more of those chemicals that
start<00:03:28.739> the<00:03:29.010> whole<00:03:29.190> red<00:03:29.519> itchy<00:03:29.849> watery<00:03:30.209> eyes

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
start the whole red itchy watery eyes

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.390 
start the whole red itchy watery eyes
syndrome<00:03:31.169> when<00:03:31.620> you<00:03:31.650> rub<00:03:31.889> them<00:03:32.099> so<00:03:32.220> you<00:03:32.340> have

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
syndrome when you rub them so you have

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.819
