gun<00:00:24.750> like<00:00:25.260> particularly<00:00:25.740> notable<00:00:26.039> is<00:00:26.279> that<00:00:26.310> it

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
gun like particularly notable is that it

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.490 
gun like particularly notable is that it
has<00:00:26.640> a<00:00:26.670> fast<00:00:26.970> x<00:00:27.180> ray<00:00:27.390> it<00:00:27.630> has<00:00:27.810> moderate<00:00:28.320> recoil

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
has a fast x ray it has moderate recoil

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.500 
has a fast x ray it has moderate recoil
and<00:00:28.859> has<00:00:29.310> low<00:00:29.519> damage<00:00:29.699> per<00:00:29.939> bullet<00:00:30.150> but

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
and has low damage per bullet but

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:31.880 
and has low damage per bullet but
because<00:00:30.750> of<00:00:30.779> the<00:00:30.929> power<00:00:31.080> supply<00:00:31.230> rate<00:00:31.529> it<00:00:31.679> does

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
because of the power supply rate it does

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.080 
because of the power supply rate it does
a<00:00:31.920> higher<00:00:32.130> damage<00:00:32.309> per<00:00:32.550> second<00:00:32.850> then<00:00:32.910> other

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
a higher damage per second then other

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.580 
a higher damage per second then other
weapons<00:00:33.420> meaning<00:00:33.809> its<00:00:33.930> deadly<00:00:34.260> in<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.410> right

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
weapons meaning its deadly in the right

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.229 
weapons meaning its deadly in the right
hands<00:00:34.770> basically<00:00:35.280> and<00:00:36.469> it<00:00:37.469> all<00:00:37.800> those

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:38.239 
hands basically and it all those

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:40.190 
hands basically and it all those
attributes<00:00:39.239> work<00:00:39.450> toned<00:00:39.690> down<00:00:39.780> a<00:00:39.840> little<00:00:40.079> bit

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
attributes work toned down a little bit

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.319 
attributes work toned down a little bit
this<00:00:40.440> game<00:00:40.649> but<00:00:41.309> they<00:00:41.399> also<00:00:41.579> are<00:00:41.879> so<00:00:42.090> prevalent

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
this game but they also are so prevalent

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:43.700 
this game but they also are so prevalent
and<00:00:42.629> is<00:00:42.750> still<00:00:42.989> one<00:00:43.110> of<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.260> better<00:00:43.410> assault

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
and is still one of the better assault

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.709 
and is still one of the better assault
rifles<00:00:44.040> if<00:00:44.219> you<00:00:44.370> can<00:00:44.520> use<00:00:44.640> as<00:00:44.730> well<00:00:44.879> so

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
rifles if you can use as well so

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.270 
rifles if you can use as well so
basically<00:00:45.960> this<00:00:46.140> assault<00:00:46.440> rifle<00:00:46.710> dominates<00:00:47.129> a

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
basically this assault rifle dominates a

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.560 
basically this assault rifle dominates a
close<00:00:47.489> range<00:00:47.760> compared<00:00:48.120> to<00:00:48.180> all<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.300> assault

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
close range compared to all the assault

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.330 
close range compared to all the assault
rifles<00:00:48.870> will<00:00:49.079> even<00:00:49.289> wind<00:00:49.469> gun<00:00:49.680> fights<00:00:49.920> against

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
rifles will even wind gun fights against

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.459 
rifles will even wind gun fights against
SMGs<00:00:50.850> and<00:00:51.120> shotguns<00:00:51.780> if<00:00:51.930> you<00:00:51.989> prepare<00:00:52.140> well

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
SMGs and shotguns if you prepare well

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.619 
SMGs and shotguns if you prepare well
enough<00:00:52.680> so<00:00:53.520> it<00:00:53.640> really<00:00:53.850> is<00:00:53.910> a<00:00:54.030> pretty<00:00:54.390> deadly

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
enough so it really is a pretty deadly

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.810 
enough so it really is a pretty deadly
up-close<00:00:55.110> weapon<00:00:55.440> at<00:00:55.620> medium<00:00:56.070> range<00:00:56.100> it<00:00:56.550> does

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
up-close weapon at medium range it does

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.240 
up-close weapon at medium range it does
pretty<00:00:57.449> average<00:00:57.719> Lee<00:00:58.079> I'd<00:00:58.530> say<00:00:58.800> above<00:00:59.070> average

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
pretty average Lee I'd say above average

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.860 
pretty average Lee I'd say above average
personally<00:00:59.730> I<00:00:59.789> enjoyed<00:01:00.180> it<00:01:00.210> at<00:01:00.600> medium<00:01:00.719> range

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
personally I enjoyed it at medium range

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.630 
personally I enjoyed it at medium range
and<00:01:01.199> at<00:01:01.530> long<00:01:01.620> range<00:01:01.829> it<00:01:01.980> does<00:01:02.100> stop<00:01:02.309> or<00:01:02.460> tiny

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
and at long range it does stop or tiny

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:03.799 
and at long range it does stop or tiny
bit<00:01:02.820> so<00:01:02.969> that's<00:01:03.059> you<00:01:03.390> know<00:01:03.420> how<00:01:03.629> this<00:01:03.750> works

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
bit so that's you know how this works

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.899 
bit so that's you know how this works
basically<00:01:04.500> it's<00:01:04.769> an<00:01:04.830> SMG<00:01:05.100> assault<00:01:05.670> rifle

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
basically it's an SMG assault rifle

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.899 
basically it's an SMG assault rifle
hybrid<00:01:06.060> if<00:01:06.510> you<00:01:06.630> have<00:01:06.810> to<00:01:07.020> label<00:01:07.409> it<00:01:07.530> like<00:01:07.680> that

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:07.909 
hybrid if you have to label it like that

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:11.359 
hybrid if you have to label it like that
so<00:01:09.110> well<00:01:10.110> I<00:01:10.140> like<00:01:10.320> to<00:01:10.439> do<00:01:10.530> this<00:01:10.680> weapon<00:01:11.040> is<00:01:11.189> I'd

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
so well I like to do this weapon is I'd

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.070 
so well I like to do this weapon is I'd
like<00:01:11.400> to<00:01:11.760> optimize<00:01:12.119> it<00:01:12.240> for<00:01:12.270> long<00:01:12.479> range<00:01:12.659> so<00:01:12.930> it

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
like to optimize it for long range so it

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.510 
like to optimize it for long range so it
does<00:01:13.260> just<00:01:13.470> cup<00:01:13.619> everything<00:01:14.040> and<00:01:14.220> I<00:01:14.280> can<00:01:14.430> be

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
does just cup everything and I can be

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.640 
does just cup everything and I can be
ready<00:01:14.729> for<00:01:14.880> any<00:01:15.030> gunplay<00:01:15.479> because<00:01:15.780> although

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
ready for any gunplay because although

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.920 
ready for any gunplay because although
part<00:01:17.280> of<00:01:17.460> Koji<00:01:17.939> tears<00:01:18.150> you<00:01:18.270> know<00:01:18.299> handgun

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
part of Koji tears you know handgun

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.749 
part of Koji tears you know handgun
plates<00:01:19.170> that<00:01:19.380> work<00:01:19.619> we<00:01:19.860> happen<00:01:20.130> if<00:01:20.280> you<00:01:20.640> can

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
focus on the up things that's why I did

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.310 
focus on the up things that's why I did
this<00:01:23.670> bill<00:01:23.880> and<00:01:24.060> it<00:01:24.150> did<00:01:24.330> alright<00:01:24.869> this<00:01:25.049> game

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
this bill and it did alright this game

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.969 
this bill and it did alright this game
so<00:01:26.100> yeah<00:01:26.280> so<00:01:26.840> first<00:01:27.840> of<00:01:27.960> all<00:01:27.990> attachment<00:01:28.590> we

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
so yeah so first of all attachment we

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.890 
so yeah so first of all attachment we
won't<00:01:29.130> be<00:01:29.250> using<00:01:29.280> to<00:01:29.820> you<00:01:30.119> know<00:01:30.210> maximize<00:01:30.720> that

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
won't be using to you know maximize that

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.170 
won't be using to you know maximize that
range<00:01:31.140> first<00:01:32.009> of<00:01:32.189> all<00:01:32.280> you<00:01:32.340> want<00:01:32.759> to<00:01:32.820> put<00:01:32.909> a<00:01:32.939> red

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
range first of all you want to put a red

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.120 
range first of all you want to put a red
down<00:01:33.360> there<00:01:33.600> so<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:34.140> iron<00:01:34.320> sights<00:01:34.590> are<00:01:34.799> really

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
down there so the iron sights are really

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.920 
down there so the iron sights are really
really<00:01:35.280> usable<00:01:35.610> in<00:01:35.670> this<00:01:35.759> weapon<00:01:36.090> most

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
really usable in this weapon most

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.510 
really usable in this weapon most
assault<00:01:37.409> rifle<00:01:37.740> while<00:01:37.829> sites<00:01:38.189> aren't<00:01:38.400> that

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
assault rifle while sites aren't that

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.640 
assault rifle while sites aren't that
great<00:01:38.670> but<00:01:38.909> I<00:01:38.970> find<00:01:39.390> that<00:01:39.659> they<00:01:39.990> on<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.350> FB<00:01:40.530> ad

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
great but I find that they on the FB ad

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.200 
great but I find that they on the FB ad
they<00:01:40.950> were<00:01:41.009> pretty<00:01:41.250> usable<00:01:41.520> especially<00:01:42.119> at

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
they were pretty usable especially at

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.910 
they were pretty usable especially at
the<00:01:42.270> ranges<00:01:42.600> you<00:01:42.659> want<00:01:42.780> to<00:01:42.840> use<00:01:42.960> it<00:01:42.990> however

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
the ranges you want to use it however

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.469 
the ranges you want to use it however
because<00:01:44.130> I<00:01:44.340> did<00:01:44.610> want<00:01:44.820> to<00:01:44.880> extend<00:01:45.149> that<00:01:45.270> range

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
because I did want to extend that range

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.450 
because I did want to extend that range
open<00:01:45.899> the<00:01:45.990> red<00:01:46.110> Dom<00:01:46.320> means<00:01:46.590> at<00:01:46.860> long<00:01:47.070> range<00:01:47.280> you

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
open the red Dom means at long range you

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.920 
open the red Dom means at long range you
can<00:01:47.490> you<00:01:47.909> know<00:01:48.030> found<00:01:48.240> three<00:01:48.540> call<00:01:48.720> a<00:01:48.750> little

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
can you know found three call a little

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.109 
can you know found three call a little
bit<00:01:49.079> up<00:01:49.229> because<00:01:49.680> you<00:01:50.100> have<00:01:50.220> to<00:01:50.340> fire<00:01:50.909> in<00:01:51.000> like

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
bit up because you have to fire in like

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.490 
bit up because you have to fire in like
little<00:01:51.390> bursts<00:01:51.780> if<00:01:51.869> you<00:01:51.930> want<00:01:52.049> to<00:01:52.110> go<00:01:52.200> pre<00:01:52.320> long

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
little bursts if you want to go pre long

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.870 
little bursts if you want to go pre long
range<00:01:52.710> so<00:01:52.920> you<00:01:52.979> really<00:01:53.280> need<00:01:53.369> red<00:01:53.640> dot<00:01:53.790> to

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
range so you really need red dot to

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.069 
range so you really need red dot to
ensure<00:01:54.149> you<00:01:54.240> doing<00:01:54.390> that<00:01:54.509> as<00:01:54.570> far<00:01:54.720> as<00:01:54.930> possible

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
ensure you doing that as far as possible

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.289 
ensure you doing that as far as possible
you<00:01:55.350> don't<00:01:55.500> get<00:01:55.649> shot<00:01:55.890> back<00:01:56.100> or<00:01:56.310> anything<00:01:56.490> and

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
you don't get shot back or anything and

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.840 
you don't get shot back or anything and
that's<00:01:57.479> why<00:01:57.659> I<00:01:57.689> chose<00:01:57.899> that<00:01:58.140> um<00:01:58.520> you<00:01:59.520> don't<00:01:59.610> go

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
that's why I chose that um you don't go

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.639 
that's why I chose that um you don't go
red<00:02:00.090> dot<00:02:00.270> then<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.750> second<00:02:01.469> attachment

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
red dot then the second attachment

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:02.840 
red dot then the second attachment
they'll<00:02:01.950> help<00:02:02.100> you<00:02:02.189> at<00:02:02.250> long<00:02:02.369> range<00:02:02.549> is<00:02:02.729> the

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
they'll help you at long range is the

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.850 
they'll help you at long range is the
muzzle<00:02:03.149> brake<00:02:03.329> so<00:02:03.630> I<00:02:03.869> don't<00:02:04.409> know<00:02:04.469> how<00:02:04.530> strong

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
muzzle brake so I don't know how strong

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.530 
muzzle brake so I don't know how strong
the<00:02:04.950> muzzle<00:02:05.159> brake<00:02:05.310> ashley<00:02:05.640> is<00:02:05.759> it<00:02:05.969> might<00:02:06.119> be<00:02:06.270> a

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
the muzzle brake ashley is it might be a

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.359 
the muzzle brake ashley is it might be a
mostly<00:02:06.990> placebo<00:02:07.469> thing<00:02:07.710> that's<00:02:07.920> like<00:02:08.039> oneish

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
mostly placebo thing that's like oneish

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.999 
mostly placebo thing that's like oneish
by<00:02:08.550> or<00:02:08.610> ten<00:02:08.879> percent<00:02:09.209> but<00:02:09.989> regardless<00:02:10.289> right

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
by or ten percent but regardless right

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.440 
by or ten percent but regardless right
now<00:02:11.160> it<00:02:11.280> feels<00:02:11.310> like<00:02:11.790> it<00:02:11.970> does<00:02:12.060> a<00:02:12.090> tiny<00:02:12.330> bit

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
now it feels like it does a tiny bit

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.790 
now it feels like it does a tiny bit
more<00:02:12.480> damage<00:02:12.780> long<00:02:12.959> range<00:02:13.140> so<00:02:13.349> muzzle<00:02:13.680> brake

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
more damage long range so muzzle brake

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:14.250 
more damage long range so muzzle brake
is<00:02:13.950> just

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
is just

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.890 
is just
strong<00:02:14.470> attachment<00:02:14.890> long-range<00:02:15.360> if<00:02:16.360> you<00:02:16.540> do

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
strong attachment long-range if you do

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.569 
strong attachment long-range if you do
know<00:02:17.019> do<00:02:17.230> decide<00:02:17.560> that<00:02:18.040> one<00:02:18.340> of<00:02:18.430> those

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:18.579 
know do decide that one of those

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:19.770 
know do decide that one of those
attachments<00:02:18.819> is<00:02:19.060> good<00:02:19.239> for<00:02:19.360> you<00:02:19.450> than<00:02:19.659> the

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
attachments is good for you than the

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.210 
attachments is good for you than the
third<00:02:19.930> attachment<00:02:20.200> is<00:02:20.470> extending<00:02:20.890> max<00:02:21.069> which

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:21.220 
third attachment is extending max which

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:22.589 
third attachment is extending max which
gives<00:02:21.400> you<00:02:21.459> six<00:02:21.670> three<00:02:21.879> bullets<00:02:22.180> it's

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:22.599 
gives you six three bullets it's

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:24.420 
gives you six three bullets it's
overkill<00:02:23.140> and<00:02:23.260> completely<00:02:23.650> unnecessary<00:02:24.250> but

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
overkill and completely unnecessary but

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.729 
overkill and completely unnecessary but
you<00:02:24.489> can<00:02:24.579> go<00:02:24.700> over<00:02:24.730> anyway<00:02:25.090> so<00:02:25.439> to<00:02:26.439> summarize

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:26.739 
you can go over anyway so to summarize

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:28.649 
you can go over anyway so to summarize
basically<00:02:27.459> attachments<00:02:27.970> aren't<00:02:28.180> needed<00:02:28.360> you

00:02:28.649 --> 00:02:28.659 
basically attachments aren't needed you

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:30.390 
basically attachments aren't needed you
can<00:02:28.810> pull<00:02:28.959> on<00:02:29.049> whatever<00:02:29.349> you<00:02:29.560> want<00:02:29.920> and<00:02:30.069> you'll

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
can pull on whatever you want and you'll

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.920 
can pull on whatever you want and you'll
still<00:02:30.670> be<00:02:30.819> really<00:02:31.030> effective<00:02:31.209> this<00:02:31.510> gun<00:02:31.720> I

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
still be really effective this gun I

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.350 
still be really effective this gun I
keep<00:02:32.500> on<00:02:32.709> like<00:02:32.890> silencer<00:02:33.640> and<00:02:33.670> extend<00:02:34.150> mags

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
keep on like silencer and extend mags

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:35.759 
keep on like silencer and extend mags
and<00:02:34.599> then<00:02:34.720> you'd<00:02:34.840> have<00:02:34.870> ridiculous<00:02:35.500> stealth

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:35.769 
and then you'd have ridiculous stealth

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:37.410 
and then you'd have ridiculous stealth
build<00:02:35.980> there's<00:02:36.819> lots<00:02:36.970> of<00:02:37.060> nautical

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
build there's lots of nautical

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:38.819 
build there's lots of nautical
possibilities<00:02:37.900> the<00:02:38.049> ad<00:02:38.319> because<00:02:38.500> it<00:02:38.709> does

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:38.829 
possibilities the ad because it does

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:40.649 
possibilities the ad because it does
have<00:02:39.040> the<00:02:39.190> ridiculous<00:02:39.610> ammo<00:02:39.909> capacity<00:02:40.090> in<00:02:40.569> the

00:02:40.649 --> 00:02:40.659 
have the ridiculous ammo capacity in the

00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:42.849 
ridiculous by RA so second thing you

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:44.929 
ridiculous by RA so second thing you
want<00:02:43.030> to<00:02:43.060> worry<00:02:43.120> about<00:02:43.329> is<00:02:43.599> a<00:02:43.629> secondary<00:02:44.290> so

their<00:04:09.220> aim<00:04:09.519> and<00:04:09.909> maybe<00:04:10.239> recall<00:04:10.629> them<00:04:10.810> away

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:11.169
