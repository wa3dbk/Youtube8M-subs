and then you shoot here but the Vita has
something<00:00:46.450> very<00:00:46.630> cool<00:00:46.989> that<00:00:47.200> I<00:00:47.230> actually

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:47.440 
something very cool that I actually

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.700 
something very cool that I actually
didn't<00:00:47.829> know<00:00:47.860> about<00:00:48.130> until<00:00:49.410> maybe<00:00:50.410> an<00:00:50.590> hour

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:50.710 
didn't know about until maybe an hour

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.380 
didn't know about until maybe an hour
ago<00:00:53.280> okay<00:00:54.280> you<00:00:54.340> can<00:00:54.579> see<00:00:54.760> it's<00:00:54.910> white<00:00:55.060> so<00:00:55.300> I'm

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:55.390

not trying to get a huge challenge at

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.570 
not trying to get a huge challenge at
the<00:01:34.840> moment<00:01:34.869> just<00:01:35.320> messing<00:01:36.310> around<00:01:36.369> with

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:36.580 
the moment just messing around with

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.320 
the moment just messing around with
stuff<00:01:37.229> right<00:01:38.229> so<00:01:38.740> actually<00:01:39.670> I<00:01:39.940> needed<00:01:40.179> her

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:40.330 
stuff right so actually I needed her

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:51.160 
stuff right so actually I needed her
like<00:01:40.539> that<00:01:40.720> call<00:01:40.929> for<00:01:41.140> this

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.489 

so<00:01:53.149> yeah<00:01:54.149> so<00:01:54.359> it's<00:01:54.479> loading<00:01:54.719> anyway<00:01:55.170> what<00:01:55.380> I'm

00:01:55.489 --> 00:01:55.499 
so yeah so it's loading anyway what I'm

00:01:55.499 --> 00:01:58.160 
so yeah so it's loading anyway what I'm
gonna<00:01:55.799> show<00:01:56.039> you<00:01:56.100> is<00:01:56.399> that<00:01:56.640> you<00:01:57.149> can<00:01:57.569> switch

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
gonna show you is that you can switch

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.830 
gonna show you is that you can switch
the<00:01:58.500> Vita<00:01:59.490> so<00:01:59.670> that<00:01:59.789> you<00:01:59.909> actually<00:02:00.119> can<00:02:00.569> use

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
the Vita so that you actually can use

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.230 
the Vita so that you actually can use
the<00:02:01.049> right<00:02:01.259> thumbstick<00:02:01.700> I'm<00:02:02.700> guessing<00:02:03.119> with

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
the right thumbstick I'm guessing with

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.069 
the right thumbstick I'm guessing with
any<00:02:03.450> game<00:02:03.810> that<00:02:04.799> uses<00:02:05.069> these<00:02:05.969> buttons<00:02:06.420> or<00:02:06.719> this

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
any game that uses these buttons or this

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:10.100 
any game that uses these buttons or this
for<00:02:07.770> directional<00:02:08.160> control<00:02:08.610> in<00:02:08.910> fact<00:02:09.509> if<00:02:09.810> you

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
for directional control in fact if you

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.390 
for directional control in fact if you
want<00:02:10.709> to<00:02:10.830> control<00:02:11.720> direction<00:02:12.769> with<00:02:13.769> this<00:02:13.950> when

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
want to control direction with this when

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.830 
want to control direction with this when
you<00:02:14.430> normally<00:02:14.819> would<00:02:14.970> use<00:02:15.150> this<00:02:15.360> you<00:02:15.569> can<00:02:15.750> do

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
you normally would use this you can do

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.600 
you normally would use this you can do
that<00:02:15.959> as<00:02:16.140> well<00:02:16.319> so<00:02:16.739> what<00:02:16.890> you<00:02:16.980> do<00:02:17.129> you<00:02:17.280> can<00:02:17.430> see

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
that as well so what you do you can see

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.449 
that as well so what you do you can see
it's<00:02:17.730> already<00:02:17.940> set<00:02:18.330> right<00:02:19.280> it's<00:02:20.280> pretty

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
it's already set right it's pretty

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:20.990 
it's already set right it's pretty
awesome

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
awesome

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.390 
awesome
normally<00:02:21.720> okay<00:02:22.170> so<00:02:22.349> you<00:02:22.470> hold<00:02:22.680> down<00:02:22.920> here<00:02:23.220> on

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
normally okay so you hold down here on

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.610 
normally okay so you hold down here on
the<00:02:23.519> screen<00:02:23.730> anywhere<00:02:24.480> on<00:02:24.660> the<00:02:24.780> screen<00:02:24.959> and

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
the screen anywhere on the screen and

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.380 
the screen anywhere on the screen and
you<00:02:25.769> can<00:02:25.890> mess<00:02:26.099> with<00:02:26.129> different<00:02:26.640> stuff<00:02:26.879> so<00:02:26.910> by

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
you can mess with different stuff so by

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.589 
you can mess with different stuff so by
linear<00:02:27.690> filtering<00:02:28.879> this<00:02:29.879> is<00:02:30.030> I<00:02:30.299> don't<00:02:30.450> really

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:30.599 
linear filtering this is I don't really

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:32.630

geometry wars which I don't remember if

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.129 
geometry wars which I don't remember if
I<00:05:05.580> have<00:05:05.820> actually<00:05:06.180> let's<00:05:06.360> check<00:05:06.630> so<00:05:06.930> you<00:05:07.020> just

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:34.650 
think I can show you another game using

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:36.920 
think I can show you another game using
the<00:05:34.680> right<00:05:35.160> stick<00:05:35.460> controller<00:05:35.850> but<00:05:36.120> anyway<00:05:36.900> I

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:36.930 
the right stick controller but anyway I

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:43.219 
the right stick controller but anyway I
was<00:05:37.200> excited<00:05:37.650> about<00:05:37.680> I<00:05:37.830> looked<00:05:38.190> online<00:05:42.020> to<00:05:43.020> see

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:43.229 
was excited about I looked online to see

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:44.990 
was excited about I looked online to see
how<00:05:43.410> to<00:05:43.830> turn<00:05:44.010> this<00:05:44.160> on<00:05:44.310> because<00:05:44.580> it<00:05:44.700> wasn't

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:45.000 
how to turn this on because it wasn't

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.370 
how to turn this on because it wasn't
intuitive<00:05:45.539> like<00:05:45.690> if<00:05:45.810> you<00:05:45.870> don't<00:05:45.990> know<00:05:46.110> about

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:46.380 
intuitive like if you don't know about

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:49.010 
intuitive like if you don't know about
holding<00:05:46.830> down<00:05:46.979> the<00:05:47.160> thing<00:05:47.370> as<00:05:47.520> a<00:05:47.550> screen<00:05:48.020> then

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:49.020 
holding down the thing as a screen then

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:51.800 
holding down the thing as a screen then
you're<00:05:49.440> not<00:05:49.560> gonna<00:05:49.740> guess<00:05:50.070> right<00:05:50.520> and<00:05:51.479> a<00:05:51.630> lot

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:51.810 
you're not gonna guess right and a lot

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:53.150 
you're not gonna guess right and a lot
of<00:05:51.930> people<00:05:52.169> were<00:05:52.260> like<00:05:52.410> oh<00:05:52.530> no<00:05:52.560> you<00:05:52.740> can't<00:05:53.039> do

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:53.160 
of people were like oh no you can't do

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:54.469 
of people were like oh no you can't do
it<00:05:53.190> you<00:05:53.310> just<00:05:53.460> have<00:05:53.520> to<00:05:53.700> use<00:05:53.850> the<00:05:53.970> buttons<00:05:54.300> so

00:05:54.469 --> 00:05:54.479 
it you just have to use the buttons so

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:55.909 
it you just have to use the buttons so
I'm<00:05:54.870> guessing<00:05:55.260> there<00:05:55.380> are<00:05:55.410> at<00:05:55.530> least<00:05:55.560> a<00:05:55.770> few

00:05:55.909 --> 00:05:55.919 
I'm guessing there are at least a few

00:05:55.919 --> 00:05:57.290 
I'm guessing there are at least a few
people<00:05:56.250> out<00:05:56.310> there<00:05:56.370> who<00:05:56.610> didn't<00:05:56.940> know<00:05:57.060> about

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:57.300 
people out there who didn't know about

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:58.340 
people out there who didn't know about
it<00:05:57.419> and<00:05:57.510> that's<00:05:57.660> one<00:05:57.840> of<00:05:57.930> the<00:05:57.990> reasons<00:05:58.260> I

00:05:58.340 --> 00:05:58.350 
it and that's one of the reasons I
