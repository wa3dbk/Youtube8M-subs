00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:01.870
 I'm not cool 

00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:13.880
 Tonight I almost did not sleep. 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:27.900
 That you're coming back to me I'm grieving to forget 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:39.920
 But it's impossible not to think Every time I get my cell phone 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.940
 Hoping I do not even know what to do. 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:58.950
 I try to disguise I'm wrong and I'm trying to believe 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:04.970
 My face does not hide The gaze is distant 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:16.150
 I lose my hunger and I even hear your voice In the head there is a movie about us 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:22.400
 The throat knots It makes you want to scream 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.450
 Begging you to come back 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:38.450
 At the end of the afternoon, everything is mixed. Nostalgia invades and calls for you. 

00:01:39.349 --> 00:01:56.599
 More than a will, it becomes madness My body burns in flames for you 

00:01:57.349 --> 00:02:45.599
 Here comes the new DVD of Pericles Late Afternoon (Edgar do Cavaco and Thiago Silva)
