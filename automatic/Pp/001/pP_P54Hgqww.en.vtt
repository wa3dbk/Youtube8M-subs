00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:12.970
 hello everyone guys then it's not me 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.710
 we put the hat on to hear me 

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:17.810
 fighettino but simply because later 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:19.700
 with washed hair and therefore looks like one 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:23.750
 mad furious madman is chosen by the 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:26.119
 therefore we try to mitigate 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.279
 a little this image and so I am 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:30.110
 put on the hat 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:32.270
 during the course of the tutorial you will see 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:34.130
 practically that darkness hangs over mine 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.840
 video about me and my face and it seems 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:38.240
 that you have glasses in the water 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.280
 but practically it's four o'clock 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:42.500
 half and dark I hate winter for 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.390
 this reason, however, now I am 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.490
 due to shoot this light in the face 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.810
 I only mounted one because of it 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:50.930
 second I don't feel like it and I'm about to 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:53.150
 go to work so I did everything 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:58.070
 in a hurry 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:01:00.290
 then or tutorial a lips tutorial 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.310
 they are a little colored but not even more than 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:05.089
 much 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:07.460
 use the 402 of the miss pupa that 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:09.229
 practically this orange though 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.049
 it remains very translucent as you see 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:13.640
 so I'm returning this lipstick 

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:16.039
 I'm using it almost always with 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.679
 many groups use both of 

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:20.869
 day and evening and I really like it 

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:22.759
 so then it stays long enough 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:24.319
 on the lips though still safe 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:28.280
 larger pine areas 

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:30.109
 another point in his favor however trick 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:34.819
 I approach you I'll show you a 

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:38.270
 it is quite strong because 

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:39.859
 however it is the evening at this tip of 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.049
 yellow 

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:46.609
 I am a little bit crazy, let's say 

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:50.029
 always using the palette 88 and it is 

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:51.360
 this is the result I didn't think of 

00:01:50.029 --> 00:01:53.340
 use a 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.830
 a red orange I never have 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.110
 used a red eye shadow but I have it 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.930
 applied in the fold to my mom 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.450
 which drops the vacuum cleaner 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:05.100
 however I applied it in the fold e 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.590
 I liked the result enough 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.600
 and then I guess you know very well indeed 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.340
 precisely wine paired with this gold 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.930
 seventh orange 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.340
 so I really hope he can 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.870
 like you and see you next time 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.870
 time bye 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.650
 no 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:19.290
 no 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.970
 no 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:37.080
 this is over here I hope there is 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.650
 liked and I send a kiss 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.650
