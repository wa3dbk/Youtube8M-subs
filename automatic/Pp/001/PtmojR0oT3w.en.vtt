00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.960
 For example, when doing any of those pages even if I'm out in the policy 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:13.349
 I do not think it should be Oriental or open. 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:17.880
 4 But then again, 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:20.550
 Go to America and go to USA to meet pk healing , 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:27.720
 Azo is neat and has a press conference. 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:32.880
 For I know the Apostles only from the school of pure Comments Oh, and I'll press 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:35.489
 Ain climax in the play, I'd itneyo the house to go get mama 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:39.750
 I do not know. 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:42.960
 Yes, there is not. 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:46.200
 Like the lottery in early January 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:51.030
 Since the school day've gone Yes, and 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:57.000
 What it is needed, but the purpose is to wonak This pioneering about the Endowment 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:01:01.620
 Feel free to drop a lot, because the key that he had his own way of its implementation errors 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:05.489
 Be careful if jeogeotdeul wanted to hear these things, by the way, so now 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:10.680
 I also had a prototype, but I think I learned a lot . 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:15.390
 So, for example, that's not really the case. 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:20.100
 So if you gather people with the same mind so do honjaseoman 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:22.500
 You can be lonely if you do it. So now people with the same mind 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:26.580
 I wish I could. 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:30.990
 Catches coming so went now was stepping on four straight election procedure was 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:33.990
 Now it will come installed seam inspection starting making better know each example books 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:38.640
 Sure to be a degree naenoteumyeo side pad Hall 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:42.290
 For support base gonna have fun because when you question me be sseup Culture 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.290
 Oh, it's 1 year old. 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:48.299
 Now, after four mayor 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:53.429
 Deuneunde not have gathered about me 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:56.789
 What I personally would like to do was never really get cold. 

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:59.939
 Rather hasineunji supported me heal ln 

00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:03.479
 Some people would like to have their politics yesterday . 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:08.849
 On the other hand, even if you do not 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:14.099
 If there was such a thing as to make the bills constantly tension now 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:17.940
 Cloudy jotgetdaneun people again and some people are now here too there is also hate him 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:20.430
 I 'm just expressing my complaint through me. 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:23.849
 But there is one thing in common . 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:29.010
 They have nothing in common right now. 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:35.010
 I hope this old system will change a little bit . 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:38.790
 I thought, and then I think that those people 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:44.250
 One true point of communicating aspirations to politics 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:46.890
 I think it's common for that role, so let's do that. 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:51.420
 I thought about it. 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:56.550
 In any case, the Grand National Party also receives signboards from the Shonuri Party 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:03:00.630
 These try something actively introducing competition for Democracy And now Democratic Party 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:06.570
 Is not there a lot of efforts to be integrated 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:10.260
 4 So something, but some of it seems to have played the role . 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:16.470
 Was there a change in the mind after that election ? 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:21.180
 Changes in the eopeotneunde I think that if the opposition wins the elections four course 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:25.709
 My opposition and the woofer have become prominent. 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:26.310
 So now I'm going back to the place where I am 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:31.410
 I would 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:32.670
 I used to think rather of the election results now as well as the opposition party students 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:39.690
 I have to come out. 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:46.170
 And then again, suddenly again, I have the desire to do it again . 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:48.760
 I was embarrassed, and how to interpret this phenomenon. 

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:53.980
 You're in trouble now . 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:58.150
 To date, the crocodile now, but now that Jasmine was the way that I 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:04:01.209
 The decisions were made at Ford's decision 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:04.090
 I can only take responsibility 2 from above 4 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:08.110
 But here in the public domain 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:12.459
 Really for the country and freedom deoraguyo a very serious issue that myself 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:14.140
 It's not just a matter of sphere, so it's really 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:19.570
 I think. 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:23.889
 So these three things I think I should think about. 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:29.710
 Now that really is a first 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:36.820
 What do you think of those who support me ? 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:42.730
 Secondly, is it possible for me to meet my expectations ? 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:46.210
 Third, is I really capable and qualified? 

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:49.750
 So you have to make a decision according to the facts. 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:53.230
 So first of all, the first thing I know 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:58.720
 I think in order to illuminate the direction of the seogetda 

00:04:53.230 --> 00:05:03.480
 So I decided to write a book so if what you plan on doing so in advance 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:03.480
 If you did, let's end the general election already.
