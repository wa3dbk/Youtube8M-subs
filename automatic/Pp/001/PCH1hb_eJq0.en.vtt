so we're going to walk through them here
with<00:00:20.010> Kurtz<00:00:20.550> Curt<00:00:21.420> thank<00:00:21.750> you<00:00:22.490> tell<00:00:23.490> us<00:00:23.609> what

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
with Kurtz Curt thank you tell us what

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.340 
with Kurtz Curt thank you tell us what
we<00:00:23.789> need<00:00:23.970> to<00:00:24.060> know<00:00:24.119> yeah<00:00:24.720> well<00:00:24.869> really<00:00:25.080> this<00:00:25.230> is

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
we need to know yeah well really this is

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.950 
we need to know yeah well really this is
a<00:00:25.380> simple<00:00:25.769> charging<00:00:26.369> solution<00:00:26.849> that<00:00:27.269> uses

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
a simple charging solution that uses

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.870 
a simple charging solution that uses
conductive<00:00:28.439> power<00:00:28.680> it<00:00:28.920> allows<00:00:29.220> a<00:00:29.250> family<00:00:29.760> of

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
conductive power it allows a family of

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.120 
conductive power it allows a family of
four<00:00:30.119> to<00:00:30.630> use<00:00:30.779> all<00:00:30.960> of<00:00:31.080> their<00:00:31.199> smartphones<00:00:31.740> and

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
four to use all of their smartphones and

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.580 
four to use all of their smartphones and
charge<00:00:32.520> them<00:00:32.640> all<00:00:32.820> at<00:00:32.910> once<00:00:32.940> in<00:00:33.360> one<00:00:33.390> place<00:00:33.809> so

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
charge them all at once in one place so

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.889 
charge them all at once in one place so
you<00:00:34.649> got<00:00:35.130> a<00:00:35.160> metal<00:00:35.489> plate<00:00:35.760> this<00:00:36.510> is<00:00:36.719> your

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
you got a metal plate this is your

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.660 
you got a metal plate this is your
migrant<00:00:37.380> and<00:00:37.770> that<00:00:37.890> becomes<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.280> way<00:00:38.460> that

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
migrant and that becomes the way that

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.220 
migrant and that becomes the way that
you<00:00:38.760> can<00:00:38.879> consecutively<00:00:39.390> charge<00:00:39.750> it's<00:00:40.050> really

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
you can consecutively charge it's really

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.380 
you can consecutively charge it's really
a<00:00:40.350> symptoms<00:00:40.770> drop<00:00:41.010> and<00:00:41.219> go<00:00:41.340> I<00:00:41.640> dropped<00:00:42.270> my

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
a symptoms drop and go I dropped my

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.869 
a symptoms drop and go I dropped my
phone<00:00:42.600> on<00:00:42.680> there<00:00:43.680> it<00:00:43.770> makes<00:00:44.010> contact<00:00:44.250> you<00:00:44.789> can

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
phone on there it makes contact you can

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:45.770 
phone on there it makes contact you can
tell

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780
