we are who we are and
I<00:04:33.120> just<00:04:33.720> don't<00:04:33.930> think<00:04:34.140> any<00:04:34.440> culture<00:04:35.250> can

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
I just don't think any culture can

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.340

because because no matter what you are

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.710 
because because no matter what you are
