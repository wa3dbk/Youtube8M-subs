whoa<00:01:54.110> yeah<00:02:05.750> that's<00:02:06.750> good<00:02:06.990> then<00:02:07.950> I<00:02:08.040> probably

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
whoa yeah that's good then I probably

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.130 
whoa yeah that's good then I probably
had<00:02:08.490> in<00:02:08.610> this<00:02:08.700> flight<00:02:08.910> was<00:02:09.119> that<00:02:09.360> the<00:02:09.540> speed

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
had in this flight was that the speed

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.040 
had in this flight was that the speed
controller<00:02:10.530> keeps<00:02:11.310> cutting<00:02:11.550> out<00:02:11.810> as<00:02:12.810> soon<00:02:12.960> as

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
controller keeps cutting out as soon as

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.930 
controller keeps cutting out as soon as
I<00:02:13.140> get<00:02:13.200> that<00:02:13.410> cutting<00:02:13.770> out<00:02:13.890> problem<00:02:14.160> fix<00:02:14.430> I'll

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
I get that cutting out problem fix I'll

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.380 
I get that cutting out problem fix I'll
be<00:02:15.060> all<00:02:15.120> ready<00:02:15.240> to<00:02:15.360> really<00:02:15.540> fly<00:02:15.780> this<00:02:16.740> uh<00:02:17.390> this

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
be all ready to really fly this uh this

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.810 
be all ready to really fly this uh this
particular<00:02:19.100> controller<00:02:20.100> has<00:02:20.340> a<00:02:20.370> known<00:02:20.580> issue

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
particular controller has a known issue

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.150 
particular controller has a known issue
with<00:02:20.970> just<00:02:21.210> cutting<00:02:21.480> out<00:02:21.630> on<00:02:21.780> occasion<00:02:22.100> so<00:02:23.100> I

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
with just cutting out on occasion so I

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.990 
with just cutting out on occasion so I
got<00:02:23.340> a<00:02:23.370> new<00:02:23.520> one<00:02:23.640> on<00:02:23.730> the<00:02:23.790> way

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
got a new one on the way

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.130 
got a new one on the way
and<00:02:24.420> you<00:02:24.510> check<00:02:24.720> my<00:02:24.870> battery<00:02:25.200> voltage<00:02:25.500> here

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
and you check my battery voltage here

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.120 
and you check my battery voltage here
looks<00:02:28.140> like<00:02:28.200> all<00:02:28.440> the<00:02:28.560> shelves<00:02:28.890> are<00:02:29.010> right

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
looks like all the shelves are right

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.570 
looks like all the shelves are right
around<00:02:29.480> three<00:02:30.480> point<00:02:30.780> nine<00:02:31.080> five<00:02:31.380> two<00:02:31.980> forbes

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
around three point nine five two forbes

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.710 
around three point nine five two forbes
fault<00:02:33.230> so<00:02:34.580> now<00:02:35.580> we're<00:02:35.760> near<00:02:36.060> using<00:02:36.480> it<00:02:36.570> by<00:02:36.660> a

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
fault so now we're near using it by a

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.750 
fault so now we're near using it by a
battery<00:02:37.170> capacity<00:02:37.380> on<00:02:37.890> that<00:02:37.920> on<00:02:38.250> that<00:02:38.310> leg<00:02:38.640> of

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
battery capacity on that on that leg of

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.820 
battery capacity on that on that leg of
the<00:02:38.820> flight<00:02:39.020> field<00:02:40.020> again<00:02:40.290> the<00:02:40.470> need<00:02:40.620> speed

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
the flight field again the need speed

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.480 
the flight field again the need speed
controller<00:02:41.270> i'll<00:02:42.270> do<00:02:42.480> some<00:02:42.750> uh<00:02:43.220> some<00:02:44.220> duration

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490 
controller i'll do some uh some duration

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:46.040 
controller i'll do some uh some duration
testing<00:02:45.030> and<00:02:45.150> see<00:02:45.210> how<00:02:45.300> long<00:02:45.420> I<00:02:45.480> can<00:02:45.630> stay<00:02:45.780> up

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
testing and see how long I can stay up

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.620 
testing and see how long I can stay up
its<00:02:47.040> don't<00:02:47.520> feel<00:02:47.670> too<00:02:47.820> comfortable<00:02:47.970> trying<00:02:48.480> it

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
its don't feel too comfortable trying it

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.900 
its don't feel too comfortable trying it
on<00:02:48.890> this<00:02:49.890> controller<00:02:50.280> with<00:02:50.490> the<00:02:50.580> way<00:02:50.670> it<00:02:50.730> keeps

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
on this controller with the way it keeps

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.680 
on this controller with the way it keeps
cutting<00:02:51.120> out<00:02:52.370> anyway

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
cutting out anyway

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.340 
cutting out anyway
nothing's<00:02:54.690> hot<00:02:55.040> running<00:02:56.040> will<00:02:57.110> battery<00:02:58.110> packs

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
nothing's hot running will battery packs

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.420 
nothing's hot running will battery packs
in<00:02:58.560> this<00:02:58.650> little<00:02:58.860> pouch<00:02:58.980> but<00:02:59.250> they're<00:02:59.430> cool<00:02:59.989> so

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
in this little pouch but they're cool so

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.090 
in this little pouch but they're cool so
seems<00:03:02.430> like<00:03:02.520> it's<00:03:02.730> success
