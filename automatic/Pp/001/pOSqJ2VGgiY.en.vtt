00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 Hi girls of the good hear of a 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.720
 very particular subject that is of 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:10.469
 blond hair and I think this video 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:12.420
 cool because every guru so every 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.830
 blogger has a specialty in 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.000
 hair because every flag has a 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.160
 different hair 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.279
 so if you are looking for red hair and 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.630
 can you look for a bathtub and that's okay? 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.510
 talk about blond hair because I always 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.119
 I was it is and have some products in 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.070
 special that we should use some 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.470
 care we should take us 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.390
 blondes and also for those who want to come to 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.280
 blonde for those who are thinking of staying 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.399
 blonde is a cool video to watch for 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.500
 understand a little better than using and 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.059
 what not to use so I 'll talk 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.690
 first of a very 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:49.020
 important that the yellows are blond 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:50.789
 well that is yellow is ugly is not beautiful 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.969
 there are some products that we can 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:57.780
 use to reverse this yellow gold and 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:59.399
 the most important is the purple product a 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.480
 machine also has lead has 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.270
 conditioner 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:09.180
 but I like the purple mask that is 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:13.710
 the tec him this lumina do not know why there 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:17.360
 is in Italian but has left out the 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:21.330
 glory is so a mask and she is purple 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:24.830
 it's a blue there's a bluish purple and because 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:29.159
 is purple is the color on the table so of colors 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:30.930
 purple cancels the yellow so if you 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.470
 apply on your hair it will cancel the 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:37.100
 tide some purple products like shampoo 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:41.070
 some conditioners they do not they are 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:44.430
 purple but it is not are not so powerful 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.619
 so strong and not impeding the hair 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:51.619
 so do not take away so much yellow 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:55.740
 this one here for example he's a is like 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:57.810
 He really is purple and really takes the 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.640
 yellow hair it's not for you 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.950
 always use to use when your hair 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.469
 I had yellow for example I always use 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.990
 usually 15 fifteen days or once 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:08.819
 depending on the yellow of my 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.760
 hair then if it 's too yellow I 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.560
 use of two washes followed and then 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.930
 for the 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.880
 It's better, I always use my hair. 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.540
 so do not let him get to stay 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.940
 yellow 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.830
 the sister family hair fit yellowish 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.569
 and then I asked her to wear a mask took 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.500
 before and after photos I'll put 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:26.500
 now for you to see 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.610
 then that yellow orange effect on the 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:35.890
 hair he leaves that was just a wash 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.690
 and you can use up to two three 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.240
 continued until he had a yellow 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:42.340
 hair then shampoo conditioner and 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:44.860
 mainly but purple face that also 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.290
 It helps to moisturize my hair. I love this one. 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.330
 My second the pot of this brand because 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:52.720
 he is very good he really is 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:55.480
 pigmented pigments have purple pigments and 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.250
 the yellow of the hair that looks ugly then 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.560
 is a normal brand and washes with shampoo 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:02.920
 conditioner and then I pass the mask 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:05.770
 left about 15 minutes and rinse 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:08.500
 I'll do this until I get my yellow hair. 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:10.990
 I need to do it again a few times. 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.990
 I'm going to take the yellow from the 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:15.910
 And that 's another thing. 

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:19.630
 important for blond hair 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:21.430
 is weak dehydrated hair breaks it 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:25.360
 because when you discolor your hair 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:26.770
 it looks good even weakened and then the 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.990
 that I always do I always do 

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:31.230

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:37.989

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:40.959
 Football is fine, so on the know 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:43.450

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:46.390

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:50.920
