00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 here it is the newest belt for the metro 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.850
 several months passed run-in 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.919
 minute to minute go to your 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.630
 first trip with passengers to distinguish 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.170
 new model even inexperienced not 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.059
 complicated 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.830
 such a subway train is still rare 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.870
 find only on the gray branch and for now 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.029
 only three pieces of informal staff 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.859
 called him eggplants for the color of the car 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.260
 but this name has got accustomed 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.090
 the main principled novelty eggplants 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.070
 inside there are no more doors that is possible 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.869
 go through the entire composition from the first 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.400
 to the last car and also due to 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.320
 no joints such a search can 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.750
 transport 15 percent more 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.130
 passengers or plus 200 people on one 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.770
 composition during peak hours 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.989
 also solve the problem hook on cling 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:45.050
 and more simply nowhere and became more times 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:47.370
 much easier we achieve by lowering 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.020
 dynamic loads in the way of the armies 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.100
 infrastructure like solid 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.100
 advantage and blues 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.130
 60 clean 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.590
 blue and 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:02.660
 all igor machinists sat down for saying that 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.610
 managing a new train is easier and more convenient 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.320
 the composition of the previous generation to pass from 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.820
 the first car in the last can only 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.830
 and a half minutes claim 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.660
 developers of course if passengers 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.400
 a little inside the train due to lack of 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:15.260
 car door feeling 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.820
 infinity composition but the main thing is 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.530
 of course practically functions now 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.510
 much more space for passengers and 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:24.500
 You can go to the right car right in 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:27.229
 driving time and here's the long-awaited moment 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.560
 landing the first passengers I think that 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:29.560
 OK 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.400
 there is no gap came 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.700
 more more space of some kind 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.700
 new 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.390
 new seats 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.850
 design 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.170
 very nice face and i see here 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.300
 climate control 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.650
 soon eggplant will ride on all 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.240
 branches of the Moscow metro 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.580
 and a little later it will reach the regions 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.340
 twentieth year almost all trains in 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.780
 Russian subway will be exactly 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:01.430
