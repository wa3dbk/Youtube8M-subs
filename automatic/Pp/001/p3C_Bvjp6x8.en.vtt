00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.760 
don't think so also if you zoom in to
foco<00:00:59.579> you<00:00:59.640> can<00:00:59.850> see<00:01:00.030> some<00:01:00.239> white<00:01:00.449> lines<00:01:00.690> if<00:01:01.140> you

foco you can see some white lines if you

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.240 
foco you can see some white lines if you
look<00:01:01.920> very<00:01:01.949> closely<00:01:02.370> and<00:01:03.290> if<00:01:04.290> you<00:01:04.830> compare<00:01:05.159> the

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
look very closely and if you compare the

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.660 
look very closely and if you compare the
lucario<00:01:05.549> to<00:01:06.560> Falco<00:01:07.560> you<00:01:08.130> can<00:01:08.310> see<00:01:08.490> that

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
lucario to Falco you can see that

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.870 
lucario to Falco you can see that
Lucario<00:01:09.000> has<00:01:09.930> very<00:01:10.380> clean<00:01:10.830> and<00:01:11.100> HT<00:01:11.430> look<00:01:11.640> and

smash<00:02:03.180> bros<00:02:03.390> because<00:02:03.600> smashers<00:02:04.439> gets<00:02:04.829> a<00:02:04.920> lot

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
smash bros because smashers gets a lot

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.950 
smash bros because smashers gets a lot
of<00:02:05.100> hype<00:02:05.340> because<00:02:06.119> of<00:02:06.420> the<00:02:06.630> characters

releasing<00:02:07.320> one<00:02:07.469> by<00:02:07.710> one<00:02:07.979> so<00:02:08.610> that<00:02:08.819> would<00:02:08.910> be

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
releasing one by one so that would be

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.300 
releasing one by one so that would be
really<00:02:09.209> bad<00:02:09.390> for<00:02:09.450> the<00:02:09.899> UM<00:02:10.140> amount<00:02:10.950> of<00:02:11.099> sales

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
risked his game for by doing that all

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:18.860 
risked his game for by doing that all
right<00:02:16.890> for<00:02:17.100> the<00:02:17.220> next<00:02:17.490> chain<00:02:17.730> shot<00:02:17.970> as<00:02:18.180> we've

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
right for the next chain shot as we've

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.990 
right for the next chain shot as we've
said<00:02:19.080> before<00:02:19.140> about<00:02:19.530> the<00:02:19.740> headset<00:02:20.250> Falco<00:02:20.970> is

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
said before about the headset Falco is

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.360 
said before about the headset Falco is
not<00:02:21.420> wearing<00:02:21.750> this<00:02:21.960> headset<00:02:22.380> so<00:02:22.830> it's<00:02:23.010> clearly

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
not wearing this headset so it's clearly

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.620 
not wearing this headset so it's clearly
fate<00:02:24.290> so<00:02:25.290> this<00:02:26.100> person<00:02:26.340> obviously<00:02:26.610> was<00:02:27.420> too

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
fate so this person obviously was too

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.710 
fate so this person obviously was too
lazy<00:02:27.840> to<00:02:28.020> put<00:02:28.140> the<00:02:28.260> headset<00:02:28.410> in<00:02:28.710> so<00:02:29.490> a<00:02:29.790> couple

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
lazy to put the headset in so a couple

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.450 
lazy to put the headset in so a couple
reasons<00:02:30.990> why<00:02:31.260> I<00:02:31.290> think<00:02:31.380> this<00:02:31.590> is<00:02:31.830> fake<00:02:32.010> if<00:02:32.280> you

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
reasons why I think this is fake if you

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.250 
reasons why I think this is fake if you
look<00:02:32.640> at<00:02:32.760> his<00:02:32.850> left<00:02:33.090> boot<00:02:33.300> it<00:02:33.540> has<00:02:33.780> some<00:02:34.020> inner

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
look at his left boot it has some inner

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.800 
look at his left boot it has some inner
glow<00:02:34.560> and<00:02:34.800> it<00:02:34.980> looks<00:02:35.790> very<00:02:36.090> pixelated<00:02:36.360> you

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
glow and it looks very pixelated you

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.180 
glow and it looks very pixelated you
don't<00:02:36.990> even<00:02:37.110> have<00:02:37.290> to<00:02:37.380> look<00:02:37.590> closely<00:02:37.740> it's

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
don't even have to look closely it's

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.460 
don't even have to look closely it's
easy<00:02:38.370> to<00:02:38.610> see<00:02:38.790> and<00:02:38.970> also<00:02:39.600> on<00:02:39.870> the<00:02:39.990> top<00:02:40.170> of<00:02:40.200> his

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
easy to see and also on the top of his

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.530 
easy to see and also on the top of his
head<00:02:41.150> it's<00:02:42.150> very<00:02:42.980> it<00:02:43.980> has<00:02:44.250> a<00:02:44.280> glow<00:02:44.760> to<00:02:44.790> it<00:02:45.120> which

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
head it's very it has a glow to it which

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.470 
head it's very it has a glow to it which
isn't<00:02:45.720> normal<00:02:46.380> for<00:02:46.890> like<00:02:47.550> I<00:02:47.760> know<00:02:48.240> the

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
isn't normal for like I know the

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.600 
isn't normal for like I know the
background<00:02:48.930> is<00:02:49.290> the<00:02:49.500> sky<00:02:49.740> and<00:02:50.010> everything<00:02:50.370> and

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
background is the sky and everything and

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.300 
background is the sky and everything and
it<00:02:50.700> lights<00:02:51.060> you<00:02:51.240> up<00:02:51.360> a<00:02:51.510> little<00:02:51.750> bit<00:02:51.900> but<00:02:52.470> not

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
it lights you up a little bit but not

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.420 
it lights you up a little bit but not
this<00:02:53.550> much<00:02:53.610> and<00:02:54.180> also<00:02:55.080> another<00:02:55.590> thing<00:02:55.770> is<00:02:56.370> that

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
this much and also another thing is that

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.240 
this much and also another thing is that
his<00:02:56.790> knee<00:02:57.000> is<00:02:57.030> really<00:02:57.630> messed<00:02:57.870> up<00:02:58.110> and<00:02:58.380> that's

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
his knee is really messed up and that's

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.280 
his knee is really messed up and that's
kind<00:02:59.460> of<00:02:59.520> weird<00:02:59.730> so<00:03:00.270> what<00:03:00.840> do<00:03:00.930> you<00:03:00.990> think<00:03:01.230> about

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
kind of weird so what do you think about

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.190 
kind of weird so what do you think about
this<00:03:01.730> yeah<00:03:02.730> I<00:03:02.760> also<00:03:03.060> find<00:03:03.270> that<00:03:03.390> knee<00:03:03.600> is<00:03:03.720> super

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
this yeah I also find that knee is super

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.470 
this yeah I also find that knee is super
important<00:03:04.710> to<00:03:04.770> this<00:03:05.040> picture<00:03:05.520> since<00:03:06.150> there's

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
important to this picture since there's

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.300 
important to this picture since there's
too<00:03:06.720> many<00:03:06.810> extra<00:03:07.260> pixels<00:03:07.590> around<00:03:07.740> there<00:03:08.040> you

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
too many extra pixels around there you

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.640 
too many extra pixels around there you
can<00:03:08.460> easily<00:03:09.060> see<00:03:09.360> that<00:03:09.570> there<00:03:10.320> was<00:03:10.410> a<00:03:10.440> really

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
can easily see that there was a really

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.800 
can easily see that there was a really
bad<00:03:10.890> cut<00:03:11.190> out<00:03:11.310> leave<00:03:11.790> the<00:03:11.820> glass<00:03:12.090> so<00:03:12.360> tool<00:03:12.570> or

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
bad cut out leave the glass so tool or

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.490 
bad cut out leave the glass so tool or
magic<00:03:13.200> wand<00:03:13.380> tool<00:03:13.560> or<00:03:14.010> anything<00:03:14.460> in<00:03:14.550> fact<00:03:14.790> and

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
magic wand tool or anything in fact and

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.670 
magic wand tool or anything in fact and
the<00:03:16.500> bad<00:03:16.950> picture<00:03:17.370> quality<00:03:17.940> arm<00:03:18.530> and<00:03:19.530> the

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
the bad picture quality arm and the

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.790 
the bad picture quality arm and the
integral<00:03:20.190> also<00:03:20.670> cuts<00:03:20.940> off<00:03:21.090> the<00:03:21.570> arm<00:03:21.960> the

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:22.800 
integral also cuts off the arm the

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.470 
integral also cuts off the arm the
amount<00:03:23.070> of<00:03:23.190> pixels<00:03:23.400> that<00:03:23.640> will<00:03:23.850> see<00:03:24.000> that<00:03:24.180> that

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
amount of pixels that will see that that

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.960 
amount of pixels that will see that that
makes<00:03:25.080> it<00:03:25.230> look<00:03:25.470> worse<00:03:25.500> quality<00:03:26.310> and<00:03:26.760> more

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
makes it look worse quality and more

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.180 
makes it look worse quality and more
fake<00:03:27.270> now<00:03:27.930> another<00:03:28.500> thing<00:03:28.620> I<00:03:28.860> want<00:03:29.100> to<00:03:29.130> point

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
fake now another thing I want to point

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.060 
fake now another thing I want to point
out<00:03:29.430> is<00:03:29.610> that<00:03:29.840> Falco<00:03:30.840> it's<00:03:31.050> himself<00:03:31.830> doesn't

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070 
out is that Falco it's himself doesn't

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:34.820 
out is that Falco it's himself doesn't
look<00:03:32.340> like<00:03:32.520> great<00:03:33.300> quality<00:03:33.570> yet<00:03:34.350> the<00:03:34.530> tree

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:34.830 
look like great quality yet the tree

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:36.650 
look like great quality yet the tree
around<00:03:35.130> him<00:03:35.310> doesn't<00:03:35.910> look<00:03:36.000> any<00:03:36.240> better<00:03:36.480> but

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
around him doesn't look any better but

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.770 
around him doesn't look any better but
it's<00:03:37.410> still<00:03:37.500> tiny<00:03:38.100> bit<00:03:38.400> better<00:03:38.700> does<00:03:39.120> and<00:03:39.360> then

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
it's still tiny bit better does and then

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.080 
it's still tiny bit better does and then
so<00:03:40.020> does<00:03:40.080> the<00:03:40.350> space<00:03:40.620> now<00:03:40.890> also<00:03:41.610> talking<00:03:41.970> about

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
so does the space now also talking about

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:43.550 
so does the space now also talking about
the<00:03:42.240> background<00:03:42.660> this<00:03:43.020> could<00:03:43.230> have<00:03:43.320> easily

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
the background this could have easily

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.060 
the background this could have easily
been<00:03:43.950> um<00:03:44.460> a<00:03:45.120> picture<00:03:46.110> from<00:03:46.410> another

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.070 
been um a picture from another

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:48.650 
been um a picture from another
screenshot<00:03:47.550> that<00:03:47.910> has<00:03:48.120> been<00:03:48.300> shown<00:03:48.330> on<00:03:48.570> the

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
screenshot that has been shown on the

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:49.730 
screenshot that has been shown on the
website<00:03:48.960> then<00:03:49.320> you<00:03:49.410> could<00:03:49.530> have<00:03:49.620> just

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:49.740 
website then you could have just

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:52.250 
website then you could have just
inverted<00:03:50.160> um<00:03:50.610> and<00:03:51.390> flipped<00:03:51.810> the<00:03:51.930> picture

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
inverted um and flipped the picture

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.560 
inverted um and flipped the picture
horizontally<00:03:53.070> and<00:03:53.220> then<00:03:53.610> make<00:03:54.060> it<00:03:54.210> look<00:03:54.420> like

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:54.570 
horizontally and then make it look like

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:57.160 
horizontally and then make it look like
a<00:03:54.750> completely<00:03:55.200> different<00:03:55.290> screenshot<00:03:56.070> now

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.170 
a completely different screenshot now

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:59.480 
a completely different screenshot now
because<00:03:58.170> of<00:03:58.200> all<00:03:58.620> these<00:03:58.800> reasons<00:03:59.070> I<00:03:59.460> think

00:03:59.480 --> 00:03:59.490 
because of all these reasons I think

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:02.090 
because of all these reasons I think
Falco<00:04:00.090> is<00:04:00.120> fake<00:04:00.690> and<00:04:00.900> also<00:04:01.530> the<00:04:01.650> headset<00:04:02.010> of

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 
Falco is fake and also the headset of

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:05.030 
Falco is fake and also the headset of
course<00:04:02.340> not<00:04:02.970> being<00:04:03.330> there<00:04:03.540> and<00:04:03.780> we<00:04:04.620> can<00:04:04.770> easily

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
course not being there and we can easily

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.610 
course not being there and we can easily
see<00:04:05.520> there's<00:04:05.880> a<00:04:06.000> little<00:04:06.240> bit<00:04:06.420> of<00:04:06.480> shadow<00:04:06.870> right
