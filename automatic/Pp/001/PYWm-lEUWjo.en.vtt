the lights hanging up there now as you
can<00:00:24.180> see<00:00:24.240> and<00:00:26.960> basically<00:00:27.960> what<00:00:28.289> I've<00:00:28.560> got

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.830 
can see and basically what I've got
going<00:00:28.740> is<00:00:29.189> over<00:00:29.429> here<00:00:29.580> i<00:00:29.609> put<00:00:29.939> these<00:00:30.570> three

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
going is over here i put these three

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.560 
going is over here i put these three
partitions<00:00:31.410> in<00:00:31.590> and<00:00:32.180> they're<00:00:33.180> just<00:00:33.360> glass

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
partitions in and they're just glass

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.799 
partitions in and they're just glass
partitions<00:00:34.140> i<00:00:34.260> still<00:00:34.440> kinda<00:00:34.620> min<00:00:34.920> and<00:00:35.600> so<00:00:36.600> what

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
partitions i still kinda min and so what

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.569 
partitions i still kinda min and so what
it's<00:00:37.020> doing<00:00:37.140> is<00:00:37.500> it<00:00:37.680> fills<00:00:37.890> up<00:00:38.040> here<00:00:38.309> then<00:00:38.489> it

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
it's doing is it fills up here then it

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.880 
it's doing is it fills up here then it
overflows<00:00:39.030> into<00:00:39.239> here<00:00:39.480> or<00:00:40.230> flows<00:00:40.500> into<00:00:40.680> there

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
overflows into here or flows into there

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.400 
overflows into here or flows into there
and<00:00:40.980> then<00:00:41.879> down<00:00:42.120> into<00:00:42.300> this<00:00:42.510> hole<00:00:42.570> down<00:00:43.350> here

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
and then down into this hole down here

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.110 
and then down into this hole down here
which<00:00:43.770> is<00:00:43.890> probably<00:00:44.070> about<00:00:44.219> six<00:00:44.579> or<00:00:44.730> so<00:00:44.910> inches

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
which is probably about six or so inches

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.889 
which is probably about six or so inches
deep<00:00:45.450> so<00:00:46.340> it's<00:00:47.340> a<00:00:47.460> pretty<00:00:48.030> cool<00:00:48.270> so<00:00:48.480> far<00:00:48.510> and

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
deep so it's a pretty cool so far and

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.410 
deep so it's a pretty cool so far and
i've<00:00:49.500> also<00:00:49.829> got<00:00:50.160> a<00:00:50.190> pump<00:00:50.610> over<00:00:50.879> there<00:00:51.030> i'm

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
i've also got a pump over there i'm

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.020 
i've also got a pump over there i'm
outside<00:00:51.710> that's<00:00:52.710> pumping<00:00:53.160> all<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:53.610> water

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
outside that's pumping all the water

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.220 
outside that's pumping all the water
back<00:00:54.210> up<00:00:54.270> to<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.510> top<00:00:54.570> just<00:00:54.870> to<00:00:54.989> kind<00:00:55.170> of

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
back up to the top just to kind of

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.910 
back up to the top just to kind of
repeat<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:55.620> whole<00:00:55.770> thing<00:00:55.980> so<00:00:56.160> there's<00:00:56.280> just<00:00:56.430> a

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920 
repeat the whole thing so there's just a

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.680 
repeat the whole thing so there's just a
non-stop<00:00:58.920> kind<00:00:59.309> of<00:00:59.399> little<00:00:59.609> waterfall<00:01:00.420> thing

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
non-stop kind of little waterfall thing

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.260 
non-stop kind of little waterfall thing
so<00:01:01.559> it<00:01:02.219> looks<00:01:02.399> really<00:01:02.550> cool<00:01:02.820> it's<00:01:03.000> working

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
so it looks really cool it's working

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.939 
so it looks really cool it's working

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
show you the lights the we've got one

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.039 
show you the lights the we've got one
small<00:01:16.770> LED<00:01:17.100> on<00:01:17.460> there<00:01:17.640> a<00:01:17.670> 10<00:01:17.970> watt<00:01:18.150> spotlight

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
small LED on there a 10 watt spotlight

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.770 
small LED on there a 10 watt spotlight
flood<00:01:19.380> light<00:01:19.560> LED<00:01:20.280> and<00:01:20.520> i<00:01:20.909> might<00:01:21.180> end<00:01:21.479> up

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
flood light LED and i might end up

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.320 
flood light LED and i might end up
upgrading<00:01:22.320> to<00:01:22.350> a<00:01:22.439> 30<00:01:22.740> watt<00:01:22.920> later<00:01:23.250> on<00:01:23.460> but<00:01:24.180> it's

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
upgrading to a 30 watt later on but it's

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.060 
upgrading to a 30 watt later on but it's
just<00:01:24.479> to<00:01:24.540> add<00:01:24.689> shimmer<00:01:25.020> and<00:01:25.290> make<00:01:25.740> it<00:01:25.890> look

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
just to add shimmer and make it look

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.560 
just to add shimmer and make it look
good<00:01:26.100> if<00:01:27.799> you<00:01:28.799> get<00:01:28.950> to<00:01:29.040> know<00:01:29.100> what's<00:01:29.280> up<00:01:29.570> i'll

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
good if you get to know what's up i'll

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.120 
good if you get to know what's up i'll
go<00:01:30.659> ahead<00:01:30.689> and<00:01:30.810> plug<00:01:30.990> it<00:01:31.140> in<00:01:31.259> now<00:01:31.290> we'll<00:01:31.770> see

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
go ahead and plug it in now we'll see

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:41.290 
go ahead and plug it in now we'll see
what<00:01:32.220> looks<00:01:32.400> like

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:41.300 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:46.670 

so<00:01:42.300> that's<00:01:42.480> the<00:01:43.460> little<00:01:44.460> 10<00:01:44.700> watt<00:01:45.020> LED<00:01:46.020> it's

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
so that's the little 10 watt LED it's

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.380 
so that's the little 10 watt LED it's
pretty<00:01:46.890> powerful<00:01:47.160> I<00:01:47.400> mean<00:01:47.550> it's<00:01:47.940> a<00:01:48.030> decent

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
pretty powerful I mean it's a decent

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.700 
pretty powerful I mean it's a decent
light<00:01:48.540> but<00:01:48.750> it<00:01:48.840> gives<00:01:49.050> it<00:01:49.170> a<00:01:49.260> nice<00:01:49.380> shimmer

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
light but it gives it a nice shimmer

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.490 
light but it gives it a nice shimmer
effect<00:01:50.460> and<00:01:51.060> then<00:01:51.240> go<00:01:51.960> ahead<00:01:52.020> and<00:01:52.140> turn<00:01:52.380> the

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
effect and then go ahead and turn the

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.120 
effect and then go ahead and turn the
light<00:01:52.680> on<00:01:52.890> and<00:01:53.990> I<00:01:54.990> think<00:01:55.020> I<00:01:55.320> own<00:01:55.530> them<00:01:55.650> I<00:01:55.860> it<00:01:55.920> up

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
light on and I think I own them I it up

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.620 
light on and I think I own them I it up
and<00:01:56.310> where<00:01:56.430> I'm<00:01:56.610> getting<00:01:56.790> good<00:01:57.060> coverage<00:01:59.630> but

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
and where I'm getting good coverage but

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.040 
and where I'm getting good coverage but

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:04.050 
that's all three lights that's a 3 x 54

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.370 
that's all three lights that's a 3 x 54
wat<00:02:04.320> i<00:02:05.060> may<00:02:06.060> put<00:02:06.270> a<00:02:06.330> background<00:02:06.570> on<00:02:06.900> it<00:02:07.050> at<00:02:07.170> some

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
wat i may put a background on it at some

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:15.830 
wat i may put a background on it at some
point<00:02:07.650> but<00:02:07.950> for<00:02:08.190> right<00:02:08.340> now<00:02:08.369> I'm<00:02:09.030> not<00:02:13.520> and<00:02:14.840> so

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
light humming it way up there so I can

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.050 
light humming it way up there so I can
actually<00:02:20.010> grow<00:02:20.190> a<00:02:20.220> lot<00:02:20.430> of<00:02:20.520> the<00:02:20.580> place<00:02:20.730> out<00:02:20.940> of

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
actually grow a lot of the place out of

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.000 
actually grow a lot of the place out of
the<00:02:21.120> water<00:02:21.300> cuz<00:02:22.050> i<00:02:22.110> wanted<00:02:22.350> to<00:02:22.410> do<00:02:22.530> kind<00:02:22.830> of<00:02:22.890> a

other thing I did was you look really
closely<00:02:31.920> up<00:02:32.280> here<00:02:32.690> I've<00:02:33.690> got<00:02:33.810> these<00:02:33.960> little

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
closely up here I've got these little

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.460 
closely up here I've got these little
metal<00:02:34.440> rings<00:02:34.770> and<00:02:35.900> all<00:02:36.900> I<00:02:36.960> did<00:02:37.170> was<00:02:37.200> just<00:02:37.380> take

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
metal rings and all I did was just take

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.360 
metal rings and all I did was just take
some<00:02:37.910> galvanized<00:02:38.910> steel<00:02:39.420> wire<00:02:39.750> and<00:02:40.370> just

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
some galvanized steel wire and just

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.850 
some galvanized steel wire and just
twisted<00:02:41.820> it<00:02:41.910> to<00:02:42.120> make<00:02:42.300> it<00:02:42.680> into<00:02:43.680> these<00:02:43.800> little

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
twisted it to make it into these little

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.290 
twisted it to make it into these little
rings<00:02:44.600> it's<00:02:45.600> already<00:02:45.810> still<00:02:46.020> a<00:02:46.050> little<00:02:46.140> dirty

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
rings it's already still a little dirty

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.760 
rings it's already still a little dirty
and<00:02:48.300> as<00:02:48.450> you<00:02:48.540> can<00:02:48.660> see<00:02:48.690> the<00:02:48.930> net<00:02:49.080> pot<00:02:49.320> just<00:02:49.590> fits

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
and as you can see the net pot just fits

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.600 
and as you can see the net pot just fits
right<00:02:49.860> down<00:02:50.160> into<00:02:50.370> it<00:02:50.610> and<00:02:52.100> once<00:02:53.100> it's<00:02:53.250> sitting

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
right down into it and once it's sitting

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.220 
right down into it and once it's sitting
right<00:02:53.640> like<00:02:54.300> once<00:02:54.480> I<00:02:54.540> get<00:02:54.690> it<00:02:54.810> sitting<00:02:55.050> right

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
right like once I get it sitting right

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.020 
right like once I get it sitting right
it<00:02:55.380> should<00:02:55.590> actually<00:02:56.040> have<00:02:56.400> the<00:02:56.520> water<00:02:56.730> kind

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
it should actually have the water kind

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.960 
it should actually have the water kind
of<00:02:57.180> shouts<00:02:57.660> like<00:02:57.900> flowing<00:02:58.170> 30<00:02:58.500> like<00:02:58.680> that<00:02:58.970> so

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
of shouts like flowing 30 like that so

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.690 
of shouts like flowing 30 like that so
that's<00:03:00.570> the<00:03:00.720> idea<00:03:00.959> behind<00:03:01.020> that<00:03:01.380> is<00:03:01.739> to<00:03:02.550> just

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
that's the idea behind that is to just

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.220 
that's the idea behind that is to just
make<00:03:02.910> it<00:03:02.940> to<00:03:03.150> where<00:03:03.270> it<00:03:03.420> can<00:03:03.570> get<00:03:03.690> water<00:03:03.930> and<00:03:04.170> it

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
make it to where it can get water and it

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.170 
make it to where it can get water and it
also<00:03:04.380> like<00:03:04.890> I<00:03:04.980> can<00:03:05.130> put<00:03:05.489> you<00:03:05.790> know<00:03:05.880> get<00:03:06.030> some

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
also like I can put you know get some

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:07.699 
also like I can put you know get some
plants<00:03:06.480> growing<00:03:06.690> up<00:03:06.930> right<00:03:07.320> on<00:03:07.350> the<00:03:07.560> edge

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
plants growing up right on the edge

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:09.890 
plants growing up right on the edge
right<00:03:07.739> here<00:03:08.100> and<00:03:08.430> that<00:03:09.090> should<00:03:09.300> help<00:03:09.450> keep<00:03:09.570> the

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
right here and that should help keep the

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.449 
right here and that should help keep the
fish<00:03:10.140> that<00:03:10.470> are<00:03:10.500> going<00:03:10.650> to<00:03:10.709> be<00:03:10.860> in<00:03:10.950> here<00:03:11.160> from

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
fish that are going to be in here from

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:14.000 
fish that are going to be in here from
wanting<00:03:11.790> to<00:03:11.910> go<00:03:12.060> over<00:03:12.360> the<00:03:12.480> edge<00:03:13.010> hopefully

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
wanting to go over the edge hopefully

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.250 
wanting to go over the edge hopefully
and<00:03:14.220> it<00:03:14.280> also<00:03:14.400> it<00:03:14.580> will<00:03:14.670> look<00:03:14.850> good<00:03:15.000> but<00:03:15.330> that

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
and it also it will look good but that

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:17.750 
and it also it will look good but that
one's<00:03:16.440> working<00:03:16.650> a<00:03:16.770> little<00:03:16.860> bit<00:03:16.980> better<00:03:17.160> as<00:03:17.580> far

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
one's working a little bit better as far

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.460 
one's working a little bit better as far
as<00:03:17.940> the<00:03:18.330> way<00:03:18.450> that<00:03:18.600> I<00:03:18.660> got<00:03:18.810> it<00:03:18.930> set<00:03:19.140> up<00:03:19.260> that's

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
as the way that I got it set up that's

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.949 
as the way that I got it set up that's
how<00:03:19.560> it's<00:03:19.709> supposed<00:03:19.920> to<00:03:20.010> look<00:03:20.100> to<00:03:20.810> this<00:03:21.810> the

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
how it's supposed to look to this the

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:23.150 
how it's supposed to look to this the
first<00:03:22.140> time<00:03:22.260> I've<00:03:22.410> tried<00:03:22.650> anything<00:03:22.860> like<00:03:23.040> that

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
first time I've tried anything like that

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:24.770 
first time I've tried anything like that
it<00:03:23.489> just<00:03:23.520> kind<00:03:23.790> of<00:03:23.850> thought<00:03:24.150> of<00:03:24.209> it<00:03:24.450> on<00:03:24.540> a<00:03:24.570> whim

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
it just kind of thought of it on a whim

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.479 
it just kind of thought of it on a whim
but<00:03:25.170> I<00:03:25.230> think<00:03:25.560> that<00:03:25.680> it's<00:03:26.010> going<00:03:26.100> to<00:03:26.160> work<00:03:26.340> out

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
but I think that it's going to work out

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:27.860 
but I think that it's going to work out
really<00:03:26.700> well<00:03:26.790> we'll<00:03:27.150> see<00:03:27.300> once<00:03:27.480> i<00:03:27.600> get<00:03:27.750> the

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
really well we'll see once i get the

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.449 
really well we'll see once i get the
plants<00:03:28.200> in<00:03:28.350> so<00:03:28.920> if<00:03:29.160> you<00:03:29.220> have<00:03:29.310> any

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
plants in so if you have any

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:30.920 
plants in so if you have any
recommendations<00:03:29.700> on<00:03:30.209> what<00:03:30.330> kind<00:03:30.510> of<00:03:30.540> plans<00:03:30.750> to

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
recommendations on what kind of plans to

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.949 
recommendations on what kind of plans to
use<00:03:31.140> so<00:03:32.040> let<00:03:32.160> me<00:03:32.190> know<00:03:32.400> all<00:03:33.300> I<00:03:33.360> put<00:03:33.630> in<00:03:33.750> here<00:03:33.840> was

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
use so let me know all I put in here was

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:35.990 
use so let me know all I put in here was
pea<00:03:34.140> gravel<00:03:34.350> I<00:03:34.590> put<00:03:34.800> some<00:03:34.950> really<00:03:35.160> big<00:03:35.400> pod

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
pea gravel I put some really big pod

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.080 
pea gravel I put some really big pod
gravel<00:03:36.540> down<00:03:36.660> here<00:03:36.989> and<00:03:37.860> then<00:03:38.430> just<00:03:38.760> kind<00:03:38.910> of

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
gravel down here and then just kind of

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.260 
gravel down here and then just kind of
gradually<00:03:39.750> get<00:03:40.650> smaller<00:03:40.680> and<00:03:41.190> smaller<00:03:41.250> I<00:03:41.820> lay
