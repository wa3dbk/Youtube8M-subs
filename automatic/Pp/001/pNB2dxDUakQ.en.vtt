00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.879
 hello it's me simon mayr has to do 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:03.959
 I thought that I would like you 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.150
 today a little bit 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:07.589
 Fitness studio customer give just what the 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.910
 there are barbell yes 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:09.630
 different variants different 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.280
 variations 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.660
 many do not even know why they are there 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.250
 think that has something to do with that 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.570
 it looks very nice many 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.699
 Coaches do not really know either 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.900
 what you should do with the country 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.609
 or with the different ones 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.140
 variants and there are of course each 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.100
 a lot of choices and I think 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.170
 everyone just so a little bit 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.760
 look where are his goals where do you want 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.050
 way and what do you want to train and 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.609
 for that then the right varnish coat 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.500
 So we see the jobs 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.570
 different variations on the one hand these 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.469
 very classic just long trade that 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.329
 This is certainly in everyone 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.469
 gym gives with the power one to 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.360
 example squats 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.570
 you do the bench press or something like that 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.370
 I just said things like spots 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:46.739
 military press continues to be used for this 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.870
 primarily the straight barbell then 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.149
 is there anything here should anyone 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.489
 be that is the sz rod of 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:57.989
 The shape says my rod is there 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:59.640
 various bold swimmer 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.000
 different vibrations if you like that 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.949
 want 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.780
 once held this somewhat hackneyed 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.939
 However, then this variant something 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.740
 more modern but of course you have to say 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.360
 here is this marked area even 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.130
 not necessarily the ideal area 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.570
 I only recommend to everyone oriented 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.159
 not always at this mark because 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.790
 you should see for example already if 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:21.229
 it is about the mark and intervene 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:24.890
 Now start making biceps cologne 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:27.720
 then I have relatively strong outward 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:32.909
 Tended to leaned while I did 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:35.520
 the whole thing with the tight grip 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:38.189
 can do and then have for example 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.659
 an inwardly concentrated handle where 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.799
 I personally much better 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.509
 can hold body tension 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.920
 this is precisely the advantage just yet 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.360
 at the pyramid training with the channel 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.399
 For example, partners here have the 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.899
 possibility that the one in the 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.729
 marked area intervenes and the 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.810
 others the inner surface can be seen 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.649
 wonderful turns one is 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.570
 huge advantage 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.799
 Overall, I can use these external ones 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.360
 Dealers lack the triceps 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.829
 want to train for example with the 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.899
 french press so this breaker 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:02.670
 Variations wonderfully suited for it 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.689
 you also very nice the triceps and 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.310
 Exercise the biceps 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.509
 so now I'll show you something completely 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.220
 But something has come out of fashion 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.750
 actually a great thing that is 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.459
 because there is something on the floor 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.550
 oscillation of the sz rod this 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.110
 rather unpopular can be different 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.430
 Variation makes you make one 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.290
 you can feel this vibration in here 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.640
 lie around the neck area and can with it 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.350
 just for example very special 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.460
 to get away for quads 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.230
 I want you now, though 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:25.550
 Do not show because I would be mine now 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.780
 probably hurt without 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.400
 training partner me that way 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.990
 to put it in the neck what you but 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.540
 can also make wonderful are the 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:33.850
 biceps curls shows you that at the 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.080
 biceps curls you have the possibility 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.770
 simply intuitive in the handle 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.170
 go in 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:40.340
 so not at all quasi grip or b too 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.770
 take but that you just look 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.770
 how does this feel good and me 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:52.730
 go for example and have the 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:55.850
 possibility enormously this variant the 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:57.440
 biceps curls had to do exactly there 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:59.330
 me too the advantage so just for 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.610
 beatles are great but for example 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.950
 also upright row with two 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:05.950
 Fingers enter into this vibration 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.030
 you have also the possibility wonderful 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.010
 concentrated to exercise and all the way 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.750
 unlike a barbell without it 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:13.310
 So vibrations would be possible in total 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.870
 always try to practice 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.580
 and then we orient the right one 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:19.340
 Randel from the right barbell too 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:21.770
 selection that is ultimately to the 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.670
 Wrists a very important thing and 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:25.250
 Of course you should not forget either 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:27.050
 that the forearm musculature and the 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.709
 brachial with bars on another 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:29.750
 way 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:31.250
 mostly in a more intensive way and 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:32.720
 depending on the exercise is claimed 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.340
 all right, a bit of fitness 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.200
 studio can do what the long the 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.470
 See you in the next video many 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.470
 greetings
