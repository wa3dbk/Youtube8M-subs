00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.770 
highly underrated it's just because a
lot<00:01:55.320> of<00:01:55.350> people<00:01:55.439> don't<00:01:55.860> really<00:01:56.009> use<00:01:56.280> it<00:01:56.310> but<00:01:57.149> if

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
lot of people don't really use it but if

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.359 
lot of people don't really use it but if
he<00:01:57.960> I<00:01:58.170> mean<00:01:58.229> hold<00:01:58.680> on<00:01:58.770> real<00:01:58.979> quick<00:01:59.009> watch<00:01:59.250> this

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
he I mean hold on real quick watch this

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.760 
he I mean hold on real quick watch this
killcam<00:01:59.820> watch<00:02:00.090> this<00:02:00.270> guy<00:02:00.509> with<00:02:00.689> juiced<00:02:00.990> how

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
killcam watch this guy with juiced how

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.429 
killcam watch this guy with juiced how
does<00:02:01.890> he<00:02:01.979> shooting<00:02:02.280> you<00:02:02.340> look<00:02:02.549> at<00:02:02.640> this<00:02:03.439> cup

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
does he shooting you look at this cup

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.770 
does he shooting you look at this cup
really<00:02:04.950> I<00:02:05.159> got<00:02:05.790> shot<00:02:06.030> with<00:02:06.149> one<00:02:06.450> day<00:02:06.630> and

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
really I got shot with one day and

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.660 
really I got shot with one day and
bullet<00:02:07.110> what<00:02:07.259> the<00:02:07.409> hell<00:02:07.649> I<00:02:07.920> don't<00:02:08.280> know<00:02:08.429> why

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
bullet what the hell I don't know why

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.600 
bullet what the hell I don't know why
but<00:02:08.700> it<00:02:09.060> seems<00:02:09.270> like<00:02:09.450> the<00:02:10.050> perk<00:02:10.289> juiced<00:02:10.770> it's

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
but it seems like the perk juiced it's

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.910 
but it seems like the perk juiced it's
like<00:02:11.970> it's<00:02:12.840> like

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
like it's like

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.390 
like it's like
painkiller<00:02:14.459> and<00:02:15.230> like<00:02:16.230> stopping<00:02:16.709> power<00:02:17.010> like

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
painkiller and like stopping power like

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.949 
painkiller and like stopping power like
all<00:02:17.580> combined<00:02:18.000> into<00:02:18.150> one<00:02:18.270> I<00:02:18.420> don't<00:02:18.630> know<00:02:18.780> what

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
all combined into one I don't know what

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:20.420 
all combined into one I don't know what
it<00:02:19.080> is<00:02:19.110> but<00:02:19.230> for<00:02:19.709> some<00:02:19.860> reason<00:02:20.099> when<00:02:20.220> you<00:02:20.280> get

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
it is but for some reason when you get

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.280 
it is but for some reason when you get
juiced<00:02:20.760> I<00:02:20.970> can<00:02:21.420> almost<00:02:21.569> never<00:02:21.810> kill<00:02:22.110> somebody

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
time they will kill me it is

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.820 
time they will kill me it is
unbelievable<00:02:26.670> but<00:02:27.330> uh<00:02:27.360> sorry<00:02:28.260> about<00:02:28.440> that<00:02:28.470> the

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
unbelievable but uh sorry about that the

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.229 
unbelievable but uh sorry about that the
little<00:02:29.099> rant<00:02:29.550> but<00:02:29.700> back<00:02:29.910> to<00:02:30.030> what<00:02:30.060> I<00:02:30.180> was

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
little rant but back to what I was

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:32.840 
little rant but back to what I was
talking<00:02:30.510> about<00:02:30.660> this<00:02:31.560> gun<00:02:31.800> is<00:02:31.830> beast<00:02:32.370> I<00:02:32.640> would

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
talking about this gun is beast I would

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:34.490 
talking about this gun is beast I would
honestly<00:02:33.030> say<00:02:33.270> that<00:02:33.420> this<00:02:33.660> gun<00:02:33.930> is<00:02:33.959> actually

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
honestly say that this gun is actually

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.250 
honestly say that this gun is actually
better<00:02:34.739> than<00:02:34.860> the<00:02:35.160> PP<00:02:35.580> 90<00:02:36.030> up<00:02:36.270> close<00:02:36.540> with

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
better than the PP 90 up close with

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.740 
better than the PP 90 up close with
rapid<00:02:37.590> fire<00:02:37.770> and<00:02:38.100> that's<00:02:38.280> very<00:02:39.090> difficult<00:02:39.690> to

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
rapid fire and that's very difficult to

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.320 
rapid fire and that's very difficult to
say<00:02:39.900> because<00:02:40.019> the<00:02:40.260> PP<00:02:40.560> 90<00:02:40.980> is<00:02:41.069> absolutely<00:02:41.670> just

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
say because the PP 90 is absolutely just

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.660 
say because the PP 90 is absolutely just
phenomenal<00:02:43.140> from<00:02:43.349> close<00:02:43.560> range<00:02:43.709> but<00:02:44.489> if<00:02:44.580> you

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
phenomenal from close range but if you

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.330 
phenomenal from close range but if you
look<00:02:44.819> at<00:02:44.940> the<00:02:44.970> gun<00:02:45.180> stats<00:02:45.800> between<00:02:46.800> the<00:02:46.890> PM<00:02:47.160> 9

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
look at the gun stats between the PM 9

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.910 
look at the gun stats between the PM 9
and<00:02:47.550> the<00:02:47.610> PP<00:02:47.850> 90<00:02:48.209> the<00:02:48.630> PM<00:02:48.989> 9<00:02:49.200> actually<00:02:49.890> I

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
and the PP 90 the PM 9 actually I

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.240 
and the PP 90 the PM 9 actually I
believe<00:02:50.310> has<00:02:50.459> a<00:02:50.489> higher<00:02:51.480> fire<00:02:51.930> rate<00:02:52.260> it's<00:02:52.950> just

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
believe has a higher fire rate it's just

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.910 
believe has a higher fire rate it's just
because<00:02:53.610> the<00:02:53.760> fact<00:02:54.030> that<00:02:54.440> you<00:02:55.440> can't<00:02:55.680> really

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
because the fact that you can't really

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.410 
because the fact that you can't really
aim<00:02:56.160> down<00:02:56.340> the<00:02:56.400> site<00:02:56.700> with<00:02:56.880> it<00:02:57.000> and<00:02:57.150> you<00:02:57.209> have

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
aim down the site with it and you have

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.229 
aim down the site with it and you have
to<00:02:57.540> hip<00:02:57.720> fire<00:02:57.959> with<00:02:58.200> it<00:02:58.380> it's<00:02:59.160> just<00:02:59.370> a<00:02:59.519> must<00:02:59.880> you

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
to hip fire with it it's just a must you

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:02.390 
to hip fire with it it's just a must you
know<00:03:00.420> it's<00:03:01.290> just<00:03:01.380> a<00:03:01.560> gun<00:03:01.739> that<00:03:01.769> it's<00:03:02.160> not

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
know it's just a gun that it's not

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.180 
know it's just a gun that it's not
really<00:03:03.080> useful<00:03:04.080> on<00:03:04.319> the<00:03:04.380> majority<00:03:05.010> of<00:03:05.040> the

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
really useful on the majority of the

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.320 
really useful on the majority of the
maps<00:03:05.459> now<00:03:06.680> on<00:03:07.680> Seatown<00:03:08.340> it<00:03:08.760> is<00:03:08.910> also<00:03:09.180> a

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
maps now on Seatown it is also a

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.229 
maps now on Seatown it is also a
difficult<00:03:09.780> map<00:03:09.959> to<00:03:10.140> use<00:03:10.260> it<00:03:10.410> on<00:03:10.560> but<00:03:11.160> because<00:03:11.519> i

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
difficult map to use it on but because i

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:14.059 
difficult map to use it on but because i
know<00:03:12.600> the<00:03:12.750> spawns<00:03:13.170> and<00:03:13.440> i<00:03:13.500> know<00:03:13.560> where<00:03:13.830> people

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:14.069 
know the spawns and i know where people

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:15.890 
know the spawns and i know where people
are<00:03:14.160> majority<00:03:14.850> the<00:03:15.060> time<00:03:15.239> are<00:03:15.360> going<00:03:15.450> to<00:03:15.540> be<00:03:15.690> at
