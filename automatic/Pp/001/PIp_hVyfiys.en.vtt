where it went at first I didn't end up
using<00:02:25.030> it<00:02:25.600> but<00:02:26.290> what<00:02:26.980> you<00:02:27.010> do<00:02:27.250> is<00:02:27.280> when<00:02:27.940> you

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
using it but what you do is when you

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.260 
using it but what you do is when you
glue<00:02:28.240> your<00:02:28.270> legs<00:02:28.690> in<00:02:29.760> there's<00:02:30.760> a<00:02:30.850> little<00:02:31.090> hole

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:31.270 
glue your legs in there's a little hole

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:32.610 
glue your legs in there's a little hole
right<00:02:31.480> there<00:02:31.540> you<00:02:31.870> just<00:02:32.050> put<00:02:32.290> a<00:02:32.320> little<00:02:32.350> piece

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
right there you just put a little piece

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.150 
right there you just put a little piece
of<00:02:32.860> it<00:02:32.980> in<00:02:33.130> there<00:02:33.340> and<00:02:33.490> cut<00:02:33.640> it<00:02:33.760> off<00:02:34.980> then<00:02:35.980> glue

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
of it in there and cut it off then glue

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.730 
of it in there and cut it off then glue
it<00:02:36.190> in<00:02:36.460> and<00:02:37.180> that<00:02:37.300> helps<00:02:37.660> sturdy<00:02:38.290> the<00:02:38.500> frame

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:38.740 
it in and that helps sturdy the frame

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:41.160 
it in and that helps sturdy the frame
but<00:02:39.010> I<00:02:39.250> put<00:02:39.820> glue<00:02:40.030> all<00:02:40.060> around<00:02:40.390> mine<00:02:40.870> so<00:02:41.140> I

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
but I put glue all around mine so I

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:42.990 
but I put glue all around mine so I
didn't<00:02:41.739> worry<00:02:41.920> about<00:02:41.980> putting<00:02:42.310> the<00:02:42.489> carbon<00:02:42.880> in

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
didn't worry about putting the carbon in

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.860 
didn't worry about putting the carbon in
there<00:02:46.170> activating<00:02:47.170> it<00:02:47.320> for<00:02:48.040> flight<00:02:48.720> had<00:02:49.720> to

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
there activating it for flight had to

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.750 
there activating it for flight had to
hunt<00:02:50.050> for<00:02:50.230> that<00:02:50.410> too<00:02:50.650> there<00:02:50.980> was<00:02:51.100> nowhere<00:02:51.400> that

hunt for that too there was nowhere that
told<00:02:51.970> anything<00:02:52.209> about<00:02:52.330> activating<00:02:52.959> you<00:02:53.230> just

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
told anything about activating you just

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.880 
told anything about activating you just
can't<00:02:53.650> turn<00:02:53.860> it<00:02:54.040> on<00:02:54.190> and<00:02:54.520> start<00:02:54.880> flying<00:02:55.120> you

nowhere<00:03:24.730> did<00:03:24.880> I<00:03:25.030> find<00:03:25.300> I<00:03:25.660> had<00:03:25.840> to<00:03:25.930> hunt<00:03:26.110> that<00:03:26.260> up

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
nowhere did I find I had to hunt that up

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:29.160 
nowhere did I find I had to hunt that up
to<00:03:26.800> find<00:03:27.010> that<00:03:27.130> so<00:03:27.580> if<00:03:28.540> you<00:03:28.660> don't<00:03:28.840> know<00:03:28.989> that

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.170 
to find that so if you don't know that

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.890 
to find that so if you don't know that
you<00:03:29.500> can't<00:03:29.709> fly<00:03:29.890> it<00:03:29.950> if<00:03:30.790> it<00:03:30.910> ends<00:03:31.120> up<00:03:31.180> being<00:03:31.239> you

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
you can't fly it if it ends up being you

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.220 
you can't fly it if it ends up being you
have<00:03:32.620> to<00:03:32.680> push<00:03:32.980> it<00:03:33.010> to<00:03:33.280> the<00:03:33.310> right<00:03:33.750> to<00:03:34.750> activate

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
have to push it to the right to activate

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.620 
have to push it to the right to activate
it<00:03:35.410> then<00:03:36.370> you<00:03:36.550> just<00:03:36.730> need<00:03:36.910> to<00:03:37.090> change<00:03:37.360> the

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630 
it then you just need to change the

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.320 
it then you just need to change the
servo<00:03:37.989> reversing<00:03:38.560> on<00:03:38.680> the<00:03:38.830> rudder<00:03:39.180> because<00:03:40.180> it

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:40.330 
servo reversing on the rudder because it

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:48.780 
servo reversing on the rudder because it
should<00:03:40.480> push<00:03:40.750> to<00:03:40.930> the<00:03:40.959> left<00:03:41.200> activate

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.680 

and<00:03:51.610> I'll<00:03:52.610> start<00:03:52.909> another<00:03:52.970> video<00:03:53.450> here

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
and I'll start another video here

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:55.300 
and I'll start another video here
shortly<00:03:54.049> and<00:03:54.200> I'll<00:03:54.319> make<00:03:54.470> a<00:03:54.500> little<00:03:54.769> clip<00:03:55.129> of

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310 
shortly and I'll make a little clip of

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:58.300 
shortly and I'll make a little clip of
it<00:03:55.370> flying<00:03:56.379> also<00:03:57.379> I<00:03:57.409> wouldn't<00:03:57.650> say<00:03:57.860> one<00:03:58.069> more

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:58.310 
it flying also I wouldn't say one more

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:01.030 
it flying also I wouldn't say one more
little<00:03:58.580> thing<00:03:58.700> about<00:03:58.940> the<00:03:59.379> multi<00:04:00.379> we<00:04:00.620> that<00:04:01.010> you

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040 
little thing about the multi we that you

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.580 
little thing about the multi we that you
can<00:04:01.340> hook<00:04:02.239> up<00:04:02.420> to<00:04:02.450> it<00:04:02.750> and<00:04:03.049> do<00:04:03.379> all<00:04:03.560> your

00:04:06.399 --> 00:04:06.409 
adjusting on the computer took a little

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:09.280 
adjusting on the computer took a little
searching<00:04:06.620> to<00:04:06.920> find<00:04:06.950> that<00:04:07.370> too<00:04:08.019> but<00:04:09.019> you<00:04:09.170> need

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.290 
searching to find that too but you need

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:14.110 
searching to find that too but you need
