 The Dalia is a tuberous plant native to Mexico; there are dahlias of all shapes and colors on the market 

00:00:22.528 --> 00:00:31.528
 and also of various sizes, from 20-25 cm of dwarf dahlias, up to 100-120 cm of the highest and largest dahlias 

00:00:35.454 --> 00:00:40.454
 The flowers are flower heads, and bloom from late spring until late summer 

00:00:43.333 --> 00:00:53.333
 They are grown in a good soil, fresh, rich and well drained, possibly very soft, so that the tubers can develop a good root system 

00:01:50.316 --> 00:01:58.320
 In areas with very cold winters, dahlias are planted at the end of winter, when frost is only a memory, in a sunny position 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:09.870
 In areas with mild winters, however, the dahlias can stay at home even in the cold period, when they are in total vegetative rest 

00:02:23.226 --> 00:02:32.730
 Watering must be provided at the time of implantation, and afterwards only in the event of drought, particularly monitoring during the flowering period 

00:02:36.249 --> 00:02:45.250
 After planting the tubers, and however every year in spring, we spread around the dahlias a slow release granular fertilizer, which will melt with watering
