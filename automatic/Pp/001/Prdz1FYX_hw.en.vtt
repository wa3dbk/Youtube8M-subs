very nice to look at very aggressive you
can<00:02:03.869> see<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.079> fins<00:02:04.350> how<00:02:04.530> they're<00:02:04.680> bent<00:02:04.950> for

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
can see the fins how they're bent for

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.419 
can see the fins how they're bent for
faster<00:02:05.759> airflow<00:02:06.270> to<00:02:06.329> go<00:02:06.600> through<00:02:06.899> them<00:02:07.079> and

00:02:07.419 --> 00:02:07.429 
faster airflow to go through them and

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:10.100 
faster airflow to go through them and
looking<00:02:08.429> at<00:02:08.550> it<00:02:08.640> from<00:02:08.700> the<00:02:08.849> top<00:02:09.090> actually<00:02:09.690> it's

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
looking at it from the top actually it's

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.500 
looking at it from the top actually it's
got<00:02:10.229> a<00:02:10.259> very<00:02:10.410> aggressive<00:02:10.830> and<00:02:11.220> sharp<00:02:11.670> look<00:02:12.300> at

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
got a very aggressive and sharp look at

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.700 
got a very aggressive and sharp look at
it<00:02:12.690> so

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
it so

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.520 
it so
be<00:02:14.220> careful<00:02:14.640> on<00:02:14.790> that<00:02:14.850> top<00:02:15.750> part<00:02:15.990> because<00:02:16.350> it's

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
be careful on that top part because it's

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.740 
be careful on that top part because it's
actually<00:02:16.860> very<00:02:16.890> very<00:02:17.190> sharp<00:02:17.700> hence<00:02:18.360> the<00:02:18.600> name

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
actually very very sharp hence the name

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.940 
actually very very sharp hence the name
venom<00:02:19.230> you<00:02:19.710> can<00:02:19.920> see<00:02:20.130> here<00:02:21.230> the<00:02:22.230> heat<00:02:22.710> pipes

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
venom you can see here the heat pipes

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.040 
venom you can see here the heat pipes
end<00:02:23.250> at<00:02:23.400> the<00:02:23.430> top<00:02:23.760> but<00:02:24.180> look<00:02:24.480> at<00:02:24.630> those<00:02:24.780> sharp

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
end at the top but look at those sharp

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:26.390 
end at the top but look at those sharp
edges<00:02:25.260> here<00:02:25.560> on<00:02:25.650> the<00:02:25.740> top<00:02:25.890> those<00:02:26.130> are<00:02:26.250> like

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
edges here on the top those are like

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.560 
edges here on the top those are like
razor<00:02:26.700> sharp<00:02:27.210> teeth<00:02:27.770> so<00:02:28.770> just<00:02:29.280> the<00:02:29.520> word<00:02:30.420> of

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
razor sharp teeth so just the word of

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.180 
razor sharp teeth so just the word of
caution<00:02:30.780> on<00:02:31.080> that<00:02:31.260> but<00:02:31.560> the<00:02:31.740> other<00:02:31.770> than<00:02:32.070> that

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
caution on that but the other than that

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.280 
caution on that but the other than that
you<00:02:32.400> just<00:02:32.730> put<00:02:32.940> two<00:02:33.180> fans<00:02:33.480> one<00:02:33.630> on<00:02:33.900> either<00:02:34.110> side

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
you just put two fans one on either side

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:35.690 
you just put two fans one on either side
and<00:02:34.740> then<00:02:34.860> you're<00:02:35.010> set<00:02:35.250> you<00:02:35.400> wouldn't<00:02:35.640> be

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
and then you're set you wouldn't be

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.090 
and then you're set you wouldn't be
touching<00:02:36.090> that<00:02:36.210> obviously<00:02:36.630> but<00:02:37.500> very<00:02:37.920> nice

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
touching that obviously but very nice

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.450 
touching that obviously but very nice
they're<00:02:38.820> from<00:02:39.570> thermalright<00:02:40.290> looking<00:02:41.130> at<00:02:41.280> the

everything that you need to install your
intel<00:02:58.860> cpu<00:02:59.400> on<00:02:59.670> it<00:03:00.000> and<00:03:00.180> if<00:03:00.810> you're<00:03:00.930> not

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:00.990 
intel cpu on it and if you're not

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:02.810 
intel cpu on it and if you're not
installing<00:03:01.470> an<00:03:01.590> intel<00:03:01.860> cpu<00:03:02.220> don't<00:03:02.430> worry<00:03:02.610> it's

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
installing an intel cpu don't worry it's

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.290 
installing an intel cpu don't worry it's
got<00:03:03.030> another<00:03:03.270> kit<00:03:03.720> here<00:03:04.080> for<00:03:04.470> your<00:03:04.650> AMD<00:03:05.040> cpu<00:03:05.790> so

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
got another kit here for your AMD cpu so

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.120 
got another kit here for your AMD cpu so
you're<00:03:06.480> all<00:03:06.630> set<00:03:06.680> with<00:03:07.680> that<00:03:07.920> as<00:03:08.100> well

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
you're all set with that as well

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.670 
you're all set with that as well
including<00:03:08.520> the<00:03:08.880> back<00:03:09.060> plate<00:03:09.390> and<00:03:09.600> here<00:03:10.470> this

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
including the back plate and here this

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.490 
including the back plate and here this
little<00:03:11.460> piece<00:03:11.820> here<00:03:11.850> is<00:03:12.150> common<00:03:12.780> for<00:03:12.960> both<00:03:13.020> so

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
little piece here is common for both so

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.040 
little piece here is common for both so
we'll<00:03:13.740> be<00:03:13.920> using<00:03:14.340> that<00:03:14.730> as<00:03:14.940> well<00:03:15.120> and<00:03:15.390> of

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050 
we'll be using that as well and of

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:17.420 
we'll be using that as well and of
course<00:03:16.260> there's<00:03:16.470> the<00:03:16.530> thermal<00:03:16.950> grease<00:03:17.100> and

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
course there's the thermal grease and

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.410 
course there's the thermal grease and
the<00:03:18.210> clips<00:03:18.510> for<00:03:19.440> those<00:03:19.710> fans<00:03:20.160> okay<00:03:21.120> so<00:03:21.180> it's

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
the clips for those fans okay so it's

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.060 
the clips for those fans okay so it's
crucial<00:03:21.630> now<00:03:21.930> installing<00:03:22.170> a<00:03:22.320> fan<00:03:22.530> is<00:03:22.710> pretty

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
crucial now installing a fan is pretty

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.160 
crucial now installing a fan is pretty
straightforward<00:03:23.340> I've<00:03:23.790> seen<00:03:24.030> this<00:03:24.210> method<00:03:25.080> of

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
straightforward I've seen this method of

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.980 
straightforward I've seen this method of
installation<00:03:25.530> before<00:03:26.070> and<00:03:26.690> basically<00:03:27.690> you

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:27.990 
installation before and basically you

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:31.490 
installation before and basically you
just<00:03:28.820> put<00:03:29.820> the<00:03:29.970> clip<00:03:30.210> on<00:03:30.270> the<00:03:30.930> hole<00:03:31.110> on<00:03:31.350> the<00:03:31.470> top

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
just put the clip on the hole on the top

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.180 
just put the clip on the hole on the top
here<00:03:32.040> and<00:03:32.250> on<00:03:32.490> the<00:03:32.640> bottom<00:03:32.820> and<00:03:33.800> then<00:03:34.800> once<00:03:35.070> you

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
here and on the bottom and then once you

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:37.880 
here and on the bottom and then once you
have<00:03:35.340> that<00:03:35.370> in<00:03:35.640> there<00:03:35.820> on<00:03:36.030> both<00:03:36.720> sides<00:03:37.170> then

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
have that in there on both sides then

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.250 
have that in there on both sides then
you<00:03:38.070> just<00:03:38.280> put<00:03:38.430> the<00:03:38.550> fan<00:03:38.810> hold<00:03:39.810> it<00:03:39.990> in<00:03:40.080> place

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
you just put the fan hold it in place

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.010 
you just put the fan hold it in place
and<00:03:40.620> then<00:03:40.860> it<00:03:41.010> clips<00:03:41.340> on<00:03:41.550> to<00:03:42.090> the<00:03:42.210> sides<00:03:42.480> of<00:03:42.780> the

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:43.020 
and then it clips on to the sides of the

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.470 
and then it clips on to the sides of the
fan<00:03:43.260> as<00:03:43.470> well<00:03:43.500> into<00:03:44.100> the<00:03:44.190> holes<00:03:44.430> of<00:03:44.610> the<00:03:44.730> fan<00:03:44.970> so

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 
fan as well into the holes of the fan so

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:48.790 
fan as well into the holes of the fan so
that's<00:03:46.020> pretty<00:03:46.350> much<00:03:46.560> it<00:03:46.950> for<00:03:47.570> the

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:48.800 
that's pretty much it for the

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.780 
that's pretty much it for the
installation<00:03:49.800> of<00:03:49.860> the<00:03:49.950> fan<00:03:50.130> there<00:03:50.370> is<00:03:50.490> some

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
installation of the fan there is some

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:52.460 
installation of the fan there is some
anti-vibration<00:03:51.330> rubber<00:03:51.690> that<00:03:52.050> you<00:03:52.140> can<00:03:52.290> add

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
anti-vibration rubber that you can add

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.530 
anti-vibration rubber that you can add
it<00:03:52.590> in<00:03:52.800> between<00:03:52.980> that<00:03:53.310> so<00:03:53.880> that's<00:03:54.060> great<00:03:54.270> that

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
it in between that so that's great that

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.420 
it in between that so that's great that
they've<00:03:54.690> included<00:03:55.110> that<00:03:55.230> as<00:03:55.350> well<00:03:55.560> here<00:03:56.310> is

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
they've included that as well here is

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.130 
they've included that as well here is
the<00:03:56.550> motherboard<00:03:56.970> that<00:03:57.000> I<00:03:57.090> have<00:03:57.360> and<00:03:57.540> I<00:03:57.600> have

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
the motherboard that I have and I have

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:01.280 
the motherboard that I have and I have
any<00:03:58.350> tell<00:03:58.950> core<00:03:59.250> i5<00:03:59.640> 661<00:04:00.420> already<00:04:00.930> on<00:04:01.080> there

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
any tell core i5 661 already on there

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:02.870 
any tell core i5 661 already on there
and<00:04:01.440> put<00:04:01.800> the<00:04:01.950> bracket<00:04:02.400> that<00:04:02.520> it<00:04:02.640> came<00:04:02.850> with

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
and put the bracket that it came with

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.270 
and put the bracket that it came with
and<00:04:03.300> basically<00:04:04.170> this<00:04:04.380> is<00:04:04.440> what<00:04:04.770> it<00:04:04.890> looks<00:04:05.100> like

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
and basically this is what it looks like

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.330 
and basically this is what it looks like
when<00:04:05.970> you<00:04:06.150> install<00:04:06.570> the<00:04:07.560> cpu<00:04:07.890> cooler<00:04:08.100> with<00:04:08.250> the

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
when you install the cpu cooler with the

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.690 
when you install the cpu cooler with the
two<00:04:08.550> fans<00:04:08.880> on<00:04:09.150> it<00:04:09.480> pretty<00:04:09.870> cool<00:04:10.080> nice<00:04:10.830> look<00:04:11.520> at

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
two fans on it pretty cool nice look at

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.370 
two fans on it pretty cool nice look at
lots<00:04:11.970> of<00:04:12.120> room<00:04:12.270> for<00:04:12.300> your<00:04:12.630> ramp<00:04:12.900> for<00:04:13.260> your

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.380 
lots of room for your ramp for your

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:16.490 
lots of room for your ramp for your
memory<00:04:13.680> too<00:04:13.860> so<00:04:14.100> didn't<00:04:14.370> interfere<00:04:14.610> there<00:04:15.500> you

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
memory too so didn't interfere there you

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.890 
memory too so didn't interfere there you
can<00:04:16.530> always<00:04:16.890> take<00:04:17.040> off<00:04:17.220> one<00:04:17.430> fan<00:04:17.900> temperature

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
can always take off one fan temperature

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.340 
can always take off one fan temperature
wise<00:04:19.109> that<00:04:19.410> 3.4<00:04:20.160> gigahertz<00:04:20.520> it's<00:04:21.420> about<00:04:21.600> 35<00:04:22.320> to

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:22.350 
wise that 3.4 gigahertz it's about 35 to

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:27.680 
wise that 3.4 gigahertz it's about 35 to
40<00:04:23.040> degrees<00:04:23.070> Celsius<00:04:23.660> max<00:04:24.660> and<00:04:25.520> on<00:04:26.520> idle<00:04:27.450> it's

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
40 degrees Celsius max and on idle it's

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:29.780 
40 degrees Celsius max and on idle it's
15<00:04:28.170> to<00:04:28.320> 20<00:04:28.650> degrees<00:04:28.950> Celsius<00:04:28.980> which<00:04:29.640> is

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:29.790 
15 to 20 degrees Celsius which is

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:32.060 
15 to 20 degrees Celsius which is
awesome<00:04:30.000> so<00:04:30.540> this<00:04:30.720> thing<00:04:30.900> really<00:04:31.230> does<00:04:31.380> great

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:32.070 
awesome so this thing really does great

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:35.180 
awesome so this thing really does great

cooling on this Intel Core i5 661 like i
mentioned<00:04:35.250> i<00:04:35.730> had<00:04:36.210> previously<00:04:36.750> on<00:04:36.900> the<00:04:36.990> same

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:37.230 
mentioned i had previously on the same

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:40.040 
mentioned i had previously on the same

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
board the cooler master TX 3 which

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:43.280 
board the cooler master TX 3 which
actually<00:04:40.670> did<00:04:41.670> not<00:04:41.820> cool<00:04:42.210> as<00:04:42.420> as<00:04:42.600> good<00:04:42.990> as<00:04:43.110> this

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:43.290 
actually did not cool as as good as this

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:45.800 
actually did not cool as as good as this
of<00:04:43.560> course<00:04:44.040> yet<00:04:44.220> txt<00:04:44.460> only<00:04:44.910> had<00:04:45.030> one<00:04:45.210> fan<00:04:45.510> and

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810 
of course yet txt only had one fan and

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:47.960 
of course yet txt only had one fan and
because<00:04:46.590> of<00:04:46.620> that<00:04:46.740> it<00:04:47.040> was<00:04:47.100> five<00:04:47.550> degrees

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:47.970 
because of that it was five degrees

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:52.100 
because of that it was five degrees
hotter<00:04:48.900> so<00:04:49.650> this<00:04:50.280> did<00:04:50.670> a<00:04:50.700> great<00:04:51.000> job<00:04:51.030> with<00:04:51.540> two

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:52.110 
hotter so this did a great job with two

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:54.770 
hotter so this did a great job with two
fans<00:04:52.410> it<00:04:52.740> kept<00:04:53.160> it<00:04:53.310> five<00:04:53.580> to<00:04:54.150> seven<00:04:54.480> degrees

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:54.780 
fans it kept it five to seven degrees

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:56.870 
fans it kept it five to seven degrees
cooler<00:04:55.170> so<00:04:55.770> great<00:04:55.980> job<00:04:56.010> from<00:04:56.430> filming<00:04:56.760> right
