00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:07.880
 today I am going to show you how 

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:10.400
 hide a partition of your hard drive 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:12.880
 in this case in case you do not want 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:16.010
 Someone access certain information 

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:18.170
 certain photos or videos you can 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:19.820
 hide the disc there are many ways to 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:20.990
 do it this is a very easy and very 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.860
 simple 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:24.870
 so we're going to do it 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:26.790
 I'm going to show the partitions that I have 

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:28.780
 we have the system partition 

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:30.760
 operative windows 

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:33.550
 and I have a partition where I go to 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:35.170
 install ubuntu later on this 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.570
 case let's open I leave it at home 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:40.690
 let's hide let's say that here I 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:42.450
 I have these folders 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.410
 for some 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.410
 projects for 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.360
 to check that nothing happens when 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.929
 when we hide the files 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.640
 and ready 

00:00:51.929 --> 00:00:59.350
 then to hide the files we go 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:02.370
 we are going to go to here we leave the window 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:07.290
 with the partitions and we're going to go to 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.290
 team we give you right click admin 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:13.170
 we go to storage and 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.170
 Disk Management 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:21.170
 here we have all the partitions that 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:23.540
 are on a hard drive that 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.590
 we want to hide and simply 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:29.270
 let's click right 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:33.070
 change the letter and we will remove it 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:36.870
 let us follow the warning 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.870
 we wait a few seconds 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.550
 the partition no longer appears in 

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:58.540
 in this case hard drives 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:07.680
 to put that partition back 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:10.830
 let's do the same in this case we 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:13.380
 let's manage two click disks 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:16.260
 right change the letter and let's give it 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.180
 click on add we can put it in the 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.209
 letter that we want in this case 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:25.340
 I choose the lute ubuntu des click 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:25.340

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.840

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.879

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.670

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:38.310
 absolutely nothing and it's a very 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:41.879
 simple very safe to hide 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:44.370
 in this case partitions or information 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:46.610
 that we do not want other people who 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:49.130
