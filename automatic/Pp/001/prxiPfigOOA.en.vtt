00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:14.690
 Wow 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:19.080
 the plot is a non-mother genius 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:21.630
 ai hello girls welcome back 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.490
 he what to make and today I'm going to teach how 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.260
 do a makeup for the day and then 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.480
 It turns there for the night without having to 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.250
 take all the makeup already retrace 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.080
 I lost count of how many times I had 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.969
 to go out and work straight for a ballad 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.920
 by noise to join and there was no 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.630
 time to spend at home or sometimes I 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.670
 had one more that has to make all 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.950
 today's editorial makeup has been 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.840
 inspired by yas my martins 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.280
 Thank you and mine you commented. 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.079
 one of the videos you will have a 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.800
 civil marriage and then celebrate the 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.840
 night 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.730
 I had the idea to do the history of 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.739
 diseases especially for you 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.120
 As you already know, I'm pretty basic and 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.780
 still doing makeup for the day 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:01.199
 I like basic even like highlighting 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:04.140
 the traits to do nothing much 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.420
 extravagant then start applying 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:10.200
 Concealer on the eyelid stay with the fingers 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.640
 myself am using the zero - based 20 O that 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.439
 will create a basis for knowing that I will 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.299
 pass because I will leave the skin more 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.650
 homogeneous and will also bring more 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.650
 shadow targeting 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.060
 Let's start with the very chubby brush 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.430
 yes of plaque apply to eyelid 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.900
 I'll get the Nei palette that 's uncle you 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.240
 can realize that I use the 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.770
 palettes naked from urban decay because 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.930
 although it is a little more expensive it is a 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.329
 good investment because it has all the 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.579
 basic colors you need me being 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.500
 very basic use many colors 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:43.350
 so I caught the first the low snake 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.570
 that brown in here with the brush 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.170
 to apply for and 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.170
 all paulo 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.890
 so stay that way do not worry yet 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.480
 very formatted here in the outer corner 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.320
 of the eye that we pass some 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.690
 other sanctions 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:08.240
 now it's a tip I love that the 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:10.280
 use of dunga 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.560
 if you have any irritation in the 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:15.290
 skin is not good if you use the 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.150
 Alex has up to a few materials 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.860
 makeup that look like durex that are 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:20.450
 for the makeup you want 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.310
 cup here in the corner of your eye 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.080
 so if you find it even better and 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.510
 I did not find that in Australia's precious 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.740
 next example take quite wake up him 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.020
 before putting on the face not to 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:32.090
 annoying a lot of what we're going to do is 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.930
 place it here in the outer corner of the 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.600
 eye 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.860
 following the end of the gold is seeing 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.940
 that paid in the direction of the 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.010
 eyebrow 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:43.670
 then take the corner of the eye in 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:46.130
 eyebrows and codecs make sure that 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.500
 It's okay, mouse without any food. 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:49.130
 here because otherwise the fit will not 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.190
 stay good 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:55.690
 now I'm going to get the softest and 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:58.490
 greater of sumaré that is the e and sigma of 35 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:01.730
 cool dark brown from the same forest in 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:03.770
 poll on I'm going to get this just enough 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:06.709
 they were actually half purple and mixed 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:08.300
 with very dark dark clay does not pass 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:10.459
 in the outer corner of the eye coming here 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:12.730
 even for a while and go up a little bit like 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:12.730
 bruno 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:24.740
 now I'll get that chubby brush 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:34.459
 to spend Christmas could take this rose 

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:37.100
 very clear and pass on the fear finding 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:38.810
 that this evil hearing very marked then 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:41.090
 I got that evil brighter 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.739
 compensated smoking and ironing on top of it 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:44.420
 This is a great tip if you think 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:47.090
 something is very scarred just pick up 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:49.720
 a neutral of the maxim from above is that 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.720
 This will brighten up a lot. 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:58.880
 now I'm going to get a dots point brush 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:04:00.640
 so that's the sigma oe 30 the most color 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:02.959
 White that I have in my palette 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:06.950
 go below the eyebrow to give 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:10.180
 illuminated and also to reinforce the 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:10.180
 eyebrow shape 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:18.470
 now I'll take 10 carefully you can see 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:21.829
 which is quite a mouse if no effort 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:26.169
 I only pay corrective in this way to 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:26.169
 strengthen the format and make it cleaner 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:37.610
 You'll do the same in the other. 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:39.319
 eye and now I'll be back to finish 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:41.630
 part of the eye pick up my 

00:04:39.319 --> 00:04:44.150
 eyeliner I always use ruler that 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:48.229
 Liquid that comes with a brush or zinho 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:50.930
 delineate only the corner of the eye to the middle 

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:53.889
 following this shadow line who created 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:53.889
 with our links 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:07.090
 to mark the water line on the 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:09.220
 or get a brush that is well 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:11.560
 Hold it tight, but at the same time fine to 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:14.980
 People have more precision this is the 21st of 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:17.230
 sigma I'll get to the courts and I'll just go 

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:21.790
 pressing down on the water line well below 

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:27.430
 the new brand the dinha but without 

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:38.890
 very strong to the absurd of the river I go 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:40.720
 use my lancôme's great problems 

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:42.130
 and I'm going to use pyxis from the machine and 

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:45.670
 applying it to this potential is 

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:51.100
 of glam which is specific 

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:56.130
 to apply the lipstick blush I 'll use the 

00:05:51.100 --> 00:06:00.070
 live glam gaga 2 which is a well neutral 

00:05:56.130 --> 00:06:02.110
 luti and there's the makeup of the day without 

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:04.300
 no secret discreet and only 

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:06.040
 valuing our traits and now 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:07.330
 here is the night agenda 

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:13.210
 so the first thing you will 

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:14.920
 do is take some of the collective with 

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:17.170
 sure must have fallen a little 

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:20.560
 shadow and it begins to become clear to us 

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:22.270
 know that it does not last the whole day will 

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:23.860
 leave my skin uncollected for 

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:25.780
 while because I know I mess with 

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:27.670
 black shadow that's what I'm going to do 

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:30.640
 now I'm going to get my dry black shadow 

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:33.730
 mac app store and my zynette brush 

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:39.010
 and 35 of the if I would have much 

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:40.750
 little just give an enhanced to grow 

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:44.080
 more than we had already created with 

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:45.970
 brown only touching a greater depth 

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:50.140
 contact 

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:51.690
 Now I'm going to go to the night without pushing too hard. 

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:53.860
 in heaven 

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:57.300
 now, yes, I can give you a boost 

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:57.300
 as corrective 

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:04.620
 I'll get my eyeliner and try 

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:06.390
 thicken this line a bit and also 

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:12.060
 circumvent this part that did not have 

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:15.090
 outlined before saw this villain clu be 

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:18.470
 Long now get a pencil done through 

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:18.470
 in the lower water line 

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:25.050
 This is Sigma 17 and I'll get that one. 

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:28.740
 black shadow also that the person is 

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:31.460
 I will meet here with the pencil. 

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:31.460
 black that I passed 

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:40.800
 and it's nice change button also gives 

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:43.050
 that you have changed completely from 

00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:46.500
 So let's go to this fire of the 

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:48.630
 the machine that made the most 

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:49.380
 I hope you liked the tip 

00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:52.020
 of today 

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:54.000
 Thank you and mine again for the idea. 

00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:56.190
 leave a comment from you because 

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.930
 next idea could be your brand 

00:07:56.190 --> 00:08:00.270
 also in instagram to see the photos of 

00:07:57.930 --> 00:08:02.970

00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:10.440
 martin marina hashtag or what not that
