this<00:00:06.000> interesting<00:00:06.509> topic

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
this interesting topic

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:08.839 
this interesting topic
let's<00:00:07.470> first<00:00:07.740> to<00:00:07.890> have<00:00:08.040> a<00:00:08.099> look<00:00:08.220> at<00:00:08.580> what

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
let's first to have a look at what

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.959 
let's first to have a look at what
adsorption<00:00:09.570> is<00:00:09.750> it<00:00:10.200> is<00:00:11.040> basically<00:00:11.519> a<00:00:11.670> process

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
adsorption is it is basically a process

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.180 
adsorption is it is basically a process
whereby<00:00:12.480> gas<00:00:12.900> molecules<00:00:13.500> adhere<00:00:14.009> to

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
whereby gas molecules adhere to

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.730 
whereby gas molecules adhere to
stationary<00:00:14.730> surfaces<00:00:15.330> in<00:00:15.509> this<00:00:16.080> case<00:00:16.410> it<00:00:16.680> is

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
stationary surfaces in this case it is

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.000 
stationary surfaces in this case it is
