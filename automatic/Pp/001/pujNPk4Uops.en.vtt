bloody gory way if the way the movie

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.470 
bloody gory way if the way the movie
looks<00:02:46.829> with<00:02:46.980> all<00:02:47.099> the<00:02:47.130> CG<00:02:47.549> looks<00:02:47.760> familiar

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480

Paul<00:02:48.630> WS<00:02:48.959> Anderson<00:02:49.079> is<00:02:49.500> the<00:02:49.530> director<00:02:49.980> he<00:02:50.190> did

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
Paul WS Anderson is the director he did

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.099 
Paul WS Anderson is the director he did
all<00:02:50.430> the<00:02:50.549> Resident<00:02:50.940> Evil<00:02:51.000> movies<00:02:51.450> so<00:02:51.840> because

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:52.109 
all the Resident Evil movies so because

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:53.659 
all the Resident Evil movies so because
it's<00:02:52.260> the<00:02:52.349> same<00:02:52.530> team<00:02:52.829> I<00:02:52.859> think<00:02:53.069> that<00:02:53.340> the<00:02:53.459> look

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:53.669 
it's the same team I think that the look

00:02:53.669 --> 00:02:54.979 
it's the same team I think that the look
is<00:02:53.819> gonna<00:02:54.000> be<00:02:54.120> very<00:02:54.359> similar<00:02:54.630> to<00:02:54.900> those

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
is gonna be very similar to those

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:56.870 
is gonna be very similar to those
Resident<00:02:55.470> Evil<00:02:55.680> movies<00:02:55.950> which<00:02:56.220> are<00:02:56.340> basically

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
Resident Evil movies which are basically

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.789 
Resident Evil movies which are basically
like<00:02:57.060> green<00:02:57.329> screen<00:02:57.660> movies<00:02:57.959> shot<00:02:58.200> on<00:02:58.290> studios

00:02:58.789 --> 00:02:58.799 
like green screen movies shot on studios

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:00.440 
like green screen movies shot on studios
so<00:02:59.430> obviously<00:02:59.700> we're<00:02:59.849> not<00:02:59.910> gonna<00:03:00.030> be<00:03:00.180> going<00:03:00.359> to

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
so obviously we're not gonna be going to

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:01.849 
so obviously we're not gonna be going to
this<00:03:00.540> movie<00:03:00.840> for<00:03:00.959> a<00:03:01.019> lot<00:03:01.139> of<00:03:01.260> kit<00:03:01.470> harington
