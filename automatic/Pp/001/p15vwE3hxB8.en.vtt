00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
leaned more green than white due to

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.310

greater<00:00:31.980> dominance<00:00:32.460> of<00:00:32.550> white<00:00:32.759> so<00:00:33.300> let's<00:00:33.450> get

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
greater dominance of white so let's get

one<00:00:35.969> drop<00:00:36.180> I<00:00:36.360> have<00:00:36.540> for<00:00:36.899> experiment<00:00:37.530> 1<00:00:37.680> this<00:00:38.610> is

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
one drop I have for experiment 1 this is

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.970 
one drop I have for experiment 1 this is
a<00:00:38.760> pretty<00:00:39.000> obvious<00:00:39.090> choice<00:00:39.450> still<00:00:39.960> since<00:00:40.860> we

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
a pretty obvious choice still since we

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.250 
a pretty obvious choice still since we
do<00:00:41.100> go<00:00:41.370> all<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.579> way<00:00:41.610> up<00:00:41.790> to<00:00:41.940> 5<00:00:42.149> 5s<00:00:42.719> he<00:00:43.020> can't

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
do go all the way up to 5 5s he can't

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.350 
do go all the way up to 5 5s he can't
get<00:00:43.410> very<00:00:43.680> big<00:00:43.980> very<00:00:44.250> quickly<00:00:44.399> and<00:00:44.969> the

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
get very big very quickly and the

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.119 
get very big very quickly and the
regeneration<00:00:45.840> ability<00:00:46.350> is<00:00:46.440> really<00:00:46.469> solid

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
regeneration ability is really solid

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.040 
regeneration ability is really solid
against<00:00:47.370> decks<00:00:47.610> with<00:00:47.789> a<00:00:47.850> lot<00:00:47.940> of<00:00:48.059> removal<00:00:48.510> my

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020 
more removal in the main deck which is

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.110 
more removal in the main deck which is
pretty<00:05:01.200> important<00:05:01.710> again<00:05:02.310> since<00:05:02.550> Mermoz<00:05:02.880> was

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.120 
pretty important again since Mermoz was

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.879 
pretty important again since Mermoz was
coming<00:05:03.419> in<00:05:03.570> the<00:05:03.960> deck<00:05:04.169> was<00:05:04.350> gonna<00:05:04.440> take<00:05:04.680> on<00:05:04.860> a

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:04.889 
coming in the deck was gonna take on a

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:07.159 
coming in the deck was gonna take on a
more<00:05:05.160> white<00:05:05.550> flare<00:05:05.940> anyways<00:05:06.330> so<00:05:06.840> I<00:05:06.870> thought

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:07.169 
more white flare anyways so I thought

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:08.930 
more white flare anyways so I thought
that<00:05:07.590> a<00:05:07.620> few<00:05:08.010> of<00:05:08.100> these<00:05:08.220> could<00:05:08.460> definitely

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:08.940 
that a few of these could definitely

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:10.940 
that a few of these could definitely
improve<00:05:09.240> the<00:05:09.360> deck<00:05:09.510> a<00:05:09.540> lot<00:05:09.720> so<00:05:10.320> now<00:05:10.710> we're<00:05:10.860> on

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:10.950 
improve the deck a lot so now we're on

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:13.640 
improve the deck a lot so now we're on
to<00:05:11.070> the<00:05:11.220> mana<00:05:11.580> base<00:05:11.840> 23<00:05:12.840> lands<00:05:13.290> total

addition of temple of Plenty I felt the

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:26.390 
addition of temple of Plenty I felt the
mana<00:05:25.080> base<00:05:25.260> was<00:05:25.470> good<00:05:25.650> enough<00:05:25.860> to<00:05:26.039> be<00:05:26.160> able<00:05:26.250> to

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 
mana base was good enough to be able to

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.010 
mana base was good enough to be able to
support<00:05:26.640> a<00:05:26.880> couple<00:05:27.180> copies<00:05:27.360> of<00:05:27.600> muta<00:05:27.810> vault

against blue decks it basically removes

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:54.400 
against blue decks it basically removes
every<00:05:52.970> interaction<00:05:53.240> that<00:05:53.690> they<00:05:53.810> have<00:05:54.020> with<00:05:54.229> it

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:39.670 
artifacts and enchantments it gets rid
of<00:06:38.270> the<00:06:38.389> gods<00:06:38.599> with<00:06:38.900> their<00:06:39.020> indestructibility

of the gods with their indestructibility
so<00:06:40.220> well<00:06:40.539> shuffling<00:06:41.539> it<00:06:41.660> back<00:06:41.780> into<00:06:42.020> their

00:06:42.159 --> 00:06:42.169 
so well shuffling it back into their

00:06:42.169 --> 00:06:44.230 
so well shuffling it back into their
library<00:06:42.560> is<00:06:42.740> usually<00:06:43.310> as<00:06:43.460> good<00:06:43.820> as<00:06:44.030> just

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:44.240 
library is usually as good as just

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:46.390 
library is usually as good as just
destroying<00:06:44.660> it<00:06:44.870> is<00:06:45.020> and<00:06:45.320> it<00:06:45.800> can<00:06:45.979> actually<00:06:46.160> be

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:46.400 
destroying it is and it can actually be

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:49.120 
destroying it is and it can actually be
used<00:06:46.550> to<00:06:46.880> pseudo<00:06:47.599> save<00:06:47.930> my<00:06:48.289> Spears<00:06:48.620> of<00:06:48.770> hylia

it's<00:06:49.789> a<00:06:49.880> bit<00:06:50.030> fringe<00:06:50.419> but<00:06:50.810> if<00:06:51.020> they<00:06:51.229> tear<00:06:51.620> it<00:06:51.800> or

it's a bit fringe but if they tear it or
