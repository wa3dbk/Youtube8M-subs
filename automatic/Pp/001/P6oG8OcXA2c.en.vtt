the pan so the middle it becomes a
little<00:01:05.500> bit<00:01:05.620> Brown<00:01:06.070> we're<00:01:06.880> gonna<00:01:07.030> flip<00:01:07.299> it

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.929 

it's<00:01:10.659> so<00:01:10.899> much<00:01:11.079> fun<00:01:11.380> to<00:01:11.829> do<00:01:11.979> something<00:01:12.250> that

00:01:12.929 --> 00:01:12.939 
it's so much fun to do something that

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:16.109 
it's so much fun to do something that
it's<00:01:13.780> like<00:01:14.049> a<00:01:14.079> brick<00:01:14.590> stone<00:01:14.920> or<00:01:14.950> a<00:01:15.189> pillar<00:01:15.729> in

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:16.119 
it's like a brick stone or a pillar in

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:18.539 
it's like a brick stone or a pillar in
your<00:01:16.390> family<00:01:16.960> it's<00:01:17.140> like<00:01:17.380> continuing<00:01:18.280> a

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:18.549 
your family it's like continuing a

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:22.289 
your family it's like continuing a
legacy<00:01:19.060> that<00:01:19.960> defines<00:01:20.469> who<00:01:20.799> you<00:01:20.860> are<00:01:21.009> and<00:01:21.549> food

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:22.299 
legacy that defines who you are and food

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:25.139 
legacy that defines who you are and food
is<00:01:22.600> a<00:01:22.810> really<00:01:22.960> strong<00:01:23.619> thing<00:01:23.890> in<00:01:24.100> that<00:01:24.250> way<00:01:24.430> so

00:01:25.139 --> 00:01:25.149 
is a really strong thing in that way so

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:28.830 
is a really strong thing in that way so
we<00:01:25.270> have<00:01:25.350> one<00:01:26.350> two<00:01:26.829> three<00:01:26.859> four<00:01:27.340> pancakes<00:01:28.210> pile

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.139 
we have one two three four pancakes pile
them<00:01:29.079> on<00:01:29.229> together<00:01:29.680> and<00:01:30.009> then<00:01:30.369> you<00:01:30.520> just<00:01:30.759> roll

00:01:31.139 --> 00:01:31.149 
them on together and then you just roll

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:35.760 
them on together and then you just roll
them<00:01:31.450> into<00:01:31.719> one<00:01:32.229> salami<00:01:33.100> and<00:01:33.460> then<00:01:34.500> you<00:01:35.500> just

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
them into one salami and then you just

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.310 
them into one salami and then you just
cut<00:01:36.039> them<00:01:36.250> and<00:01:36.850> it's<00:01:37.030> really<00:01:37.390> important<00:01:38.079> to
