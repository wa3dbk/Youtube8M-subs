00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.800
 but 

00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:05.900
 Carlos, tell us a bit about the stage 

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:09.440
 is the work of expansion of the stadium 

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:11.330
 of union well is finishing the 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:14.059
 contracted party 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:15.910
 astori 60 percent of all the 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:19.220
 south side 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:22.970
 to graph it in 100-meter numbers 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:25.820
 that has the tribune 60 meters and it is 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:31.039
 finalizing everything the skeleton the 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:34.489
 pre molded and the shell of what's going 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:37.329
 to be the tribune obviously will miss 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:41.480
 then all the terminations are 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:43.750
 stairs the elevators place the 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.550
 armchairs the railing everything 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:49.220
 safety and comfort so that you can 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:53.160
 enable how many seats are going 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:56.400
 to have this 60 percent here 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:01:00.180
 and one thousand 400 seats can be installed 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:03.059
 out of a total of 2500 and it's also going to 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.989
 be the part of boxes and cabins for 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.880
 the press 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.479
 exactly that is all in the 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:12.390
 structure 60% of the cabins of 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.610
 transmission and 60% of the two floors of 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.160
 boxes the union fan wonders 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.660
 when will 60% be enabled 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:22.560
 this part of the work when he goes to 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:28.140
 to be able to enjoy is not depending on the 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:31.710
 financial flow of money without 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:35.759
 resources enter as they are 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:38.100
 had committed certain organisms to 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.990
 who enter the club coffers 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.060
 idea is that at least this 60 by 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.399
 hundred is enabled for the second 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:48.210
 wheel for February March of the year that 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:50.039
 comes that the idea is everything depends I go back 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.320
 to insist the economic factor 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:54.330
 It should also be clarified that this part of 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.460
 the work is totally covered by what 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.230
 economic everything exactly everything 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.780
 is mounted and 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:04.410
 executed and how little is missing 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:07.920
 to finish this 60 is already turned off 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:10.530
 you are not owed anything have projected 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.410
 this finish it in case 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:15.810
 Obviously the resources are gathered from 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.150
 the economic this sector what would be the 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.920
 second step the second step of 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.280
 complete that 40 percent that is 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:26.700
 missing to have all the lateral 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:31.140
 South of the covered with the stalls cabins 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:35.810
 and VIP boxes also down if in the area 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:39.150
 where were the transmission booths 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:43.020
 where were the boxes 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:46.230
 The idea is to make a whole sector 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:48.180
 preferential with much more comfort of 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:51.350
 what they have had until now 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:54.950
 joining palquistas a sector 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:59.270
 with much more comfortable seats with a 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:01.550
 Very comfortable seating area is very 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:05.300
 similar to what is projected for 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:07.490
 wash the upper levels but 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:09.890
 with much more comfort and at the best 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:13.700
 place of the court because the place 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:15.950
 intermediate where it looks where 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:18.440
 currently the camera is supported 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:20.570
 transmission or where historically had 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:23.060
 the transmission camera all that goes to 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:25.100
 be preferential boxes is how to access 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.140
 lynch to this sector does it by elevator 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:31.090
 he does it by stairs or by elevator and 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:34.090
 by staircase the two things the project 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.090
 originally 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:41.510
 what we are looking for that is achieved is 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:44.510
 this platform is accessed by three 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:46.100
 half elevators are four two in each 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:48.930
 tip 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:53.760
 staircase stairs one in each 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:57.030
 end and ramps the ramps in this 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:59.160
 first stage are not included by a 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:02.570
 issue of costs was given preference 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:07.440
 to the elevator stairs that's 

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:12.780
 what the stage would continue to do the 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:15.060
 wing east southeast of riding it the 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:16.920
 structure and the cabins of the two 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:19.700
 elevators and the ladder to be able 

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:19.700
 access this place
