 about your next generation of xbox 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.119

 but good tony bartel 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.930
 the president of gamestop seemed 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.820
 interested in knowing some 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.980
 specifications regarding the formats 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.540
 physical and digital console as 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.219
 They had to make balances on 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.050
 financial quarter in which they would come out 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.450
 the new consoles playstation 4 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.579
 like xbox 360 is what you want to say 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.760
 well basically basically there will be 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:53.219
 rumored in which the digital format 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.020
 you may be well above the 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.489
 physical but good regardless of 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.320
 Whether it's like this or not have to do 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.149
 balance of how many sales there may be and 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.859
 others not for the quarter in which that 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.420
 game come out you know that the quarter 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.250
 financial is not like a quarter 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.659
 normal I want to say it seems to me that 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.490
 start or end 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.869

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.909
 good basically for that to do 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.590
 the balances of how much they could earn 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.350
 both with playstation 4 and playstation 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.729

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.520

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.799
