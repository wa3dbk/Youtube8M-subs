00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.840 

first<00:00:25.500> thing<00:00:25.680> to<00:00:25.770> do<00:00:25.860> is<00:00:26.039> take<00:00:26.250> some<00:00:26.490> soft

first thing to do is take some soft

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:31.189 
first thing to do is take some soft
butter<00:00:27.119> and<00:00:27.619> pop<00:00:28.619> it<00:00:28.800> into<00:00:29.010> your<00:00:29.520> mixer<00:00:30.150> if<00:00:31.050> you

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
butter and pop it into your mixer if you

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.820 
butter and pop it into your mixer if you
don't<00:00:31.500> have<00:00:31.890> a<00:00:32.450> stand<00:00:33.450> mixer<00:00:33.570> you<00:00:33.989> can<00:00:34.260> use<00:00:34.650> a

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:34.830 
don't have a stand mixer you can use a

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:37.729 
don't have a stand mixer you can use a
wooden<00:00:35.040> spoon<00:00:35.489> or<00:00:35.700> an<00:00:36.450> electric<00:00:37.020> handheld

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
wooden spoon or an electric handheld

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.009 
wooden spoon or an electric handheld
mixer<00:00:38.010> so<00:00:38.910> I'm<00:00:38.970> just<00:00:39.150> going<00:00:39.329> to<00:00:39.420> pop<00:00:39.660> this<00:00:39.840> all

00:00:40.009 --> 00:00:40.019 
mixer so I'm just going to pop this all

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:43.280 
mixer so I'm just going to pop this all
in<00:00:40.199> and<00:00:40.850> then<00:00:41.850> beat<00:00:42.239> it<00:00:42.269> until<00:00:42.780> it's<00:00:42.930> really

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
in and then beat it until it's really

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:50.079 
in and then beat it until it's really
light<00:00:43.860> and<00:00:44.220> creamy<00:00:44.460> so<00:00:45.120> take<00:00:45.390> a<00:00:45.420> few<00:00:45.629> minutes

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:50.089 

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:52.610 

so<00:00:51.089> the<00:00:51.210> butter<00:00:51.390> is<00:00:51.540> really<00:00:51.839> light<00:00:52.230> and<00:00:52.410> creamy

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
so the butter is really light and creamy

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.380 
so the butter is really light and creamy
now<00:00:52.860> you<00:00:53.190> can<00:00:53.309> see<00:00:53.610> it's<00:00:53.760> changed<00:00:54.150> color

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
now you can see it's changed color

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.479 
now you can see it's changed color
slightly<00:00:54.870> I'm<00:00:55.140> going<00:00:55.379> to<00:00:55.440> add<00:00:55.559> in<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:55.920> castor

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
slightly I'm going to add in the castor

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.569 
slightly I'm going to add in the castor
sugar<00:00:56.570> just<00:00:57.570> Chuck<00:00:57.809> that<00:00:57.840> in<00:00:58.140> and<00:00:58.440> then<00:00:59.280> again

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
sugar just Chuck that in and then again

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.220 
sugar just Chuck that in and then again
I'm<00:00:59.789> going<00:00:59.940> to<00:01:00.000> beat<00:01:00.180> it<00:01:00.210> again<00:01:00.629> because<00:01:01.170> I

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
I'm going to beat it again because I

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.600 
I'm going to beat it again because I
want<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.469> castor<00:01:01.739> sugar<00:01:01.770> to<00:01:02.070> really<00:01:02.280> absorb

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:02.610 
want the castor sugar to really absorb

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:05.150 
want the castor sugar to really absorb
into<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:03.000> butter<00:01:03.289> start<00:01:04.289> off<00:01:04.470> slowly<00:01:04.739> and

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:05.160 
into the butter start off slowly and

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.460 
into the butter start off slowly and
then<00:01:05.430> once<00:01:05.729> it's<00:01:05.940> mixed<00:01:06.149> in<00:01:06.509> quite<00:01:07.020> well<00:01:07.200> you

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
then once it's mixed in quite well you

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.330 
then once it's mixed in quite well you
can<00:01:07.619> turn<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:07.979> speed<00:01:08.220> up<00:01:09.259> so<00:01:10.259> now<00:01:10.500> this<00:01:10.950> is<00:01:11.100> so

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
can turn the speed up so now this is so

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.340 
can turn the speed up so now this is so
easy<00:01:11.490> all<00:01:11.910> we've<00:01:12.090> got<00:01:12.240> to<00:01:12.330> do<00:01:12.479> is<00:01:12.720> add<00:01:13.170> in<00:01:13.320> the

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
easy all we've got to do is add in the

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.760 
easy all we've got to do is add in the
corn<00:01:13.710> flour<00:01:14.070> and<00:01:14.430> also<00:01:14.850> some<00:01:15.180> flour<00:01:15.479> so<00:01:16.050> I'm

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
corn flour and also some flour so I'm

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.850 
corn flour and also some flour so I'm
going<00:01:17.009> to<00:01:17.220> pop<00:01:18.030> these<00:01:18.210> both<00:01:18.450> in<00:01:19.789> and<00:01:20.899> then<00:01:21.899> very

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
going to pop these both in and then very

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.590 
going to pop these both in and then very
very<00:01:23.100> gently<00:01:24.470> turn<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:26.030> paddle<00:01:27.030> just<00:01:27.420> to

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
very gently turn the paddle just to

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.240 
very gently turn the paddle just to
start<00:01:27.810> incorporating<00:01:27.990> it<00:01:28.500> don't<00:01:28.890> go<00:01:29.070> up

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
start incorporating it don't go up

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.920 
start incorporating it don't go up
really<00:01:29.640> to<00:01:29.909> a<00:01:29.939> high<00:01:30.150> speed<00:01:30.210> straightaway

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
really to a high speed straightaway

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.300 
really to a high speed straightaway
because<00:01:31.110> obviously<00:01:31.619> it's<00:01:32.070> got<00:01:32.189> to<00:01:32.250> go

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
because obviously it's got to go

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.760 
because obviously it's got to go
everywhere<00:01:32.670> otherwise<00:01:35.900> the<00:01:36.900> idea<00:01:37.229> here<00:01:37.500> is

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
everywhere otherwise the idea here is

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.590 
everywhere otherwise the idea here is
just<00:01:37.860> to<00:01:38.369> incorporate<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:39.119> flour<00:01:39.360> in<00:01:39.540> the

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
just to incorporate the flour in the

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.940 
just to incorporate the flour in the
corn<00:01:39.810> flour<00:01:39.990> you<00:01:40.140> don't<00:01:40.350> want<00:01:40.500> to<00:01:40.590> over<00:01:40.799> beat

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
corn flour you don't want to over beat

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.310 
corn flour you don't want to over beat
it<00:01:41.310> because<00:01:41.520> if<00:01:41.640> you<00:01:41.759> do<00:01:42.000> your<00:01:42.720> biscuit<00:01:43.140> day

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
it because if you do your biscuit day

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.920 
it because if you do your biscuit day
will<00:01:43.500> be<00:01:43.680> a<00:01:43.950> little<00:01:44.369> bit<00:01:44.460> tough<00:01:44.729> so<00:01:45.060> we're<00:01:45.900> just

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
will be a little bit tough so we're just

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.359 
will be a little bit tough so we're just
trying<00:01:46.530> to<00:01:46.560> make<00:01:46.740> sure<00:01:46.950> that<00:01:47.130> it<00:01:47.250> all

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
trying to make sure that it all

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.530 
trying to make sure that it all
incorporates<00:01:49.310> okay<00:01:50.310> so<00:01:50.369> at<00:01:50.640> that<00:01:50.759> point<00:01:51.060> where

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
incorporates okay so at that point where

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.090 
incorporates okay so at that point where
you<00:01:51.689> can<00:01:51.840> see<00:01:52.140> these<00:01:52.380> great<00:01:52.680> big<00:01:52.890> sort<00:01:53.070> of

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
you can see these great big sort of

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.469 
you can see these great big sort of
clumps<00:01:53.490> of<00:01:53.610> biscuit<00:01:53.909> dough<00:01:54.060> starting<00:01:54.420> to

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
clumps of biscuit dough starting to

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.090 
clumps of biscuit dough starting to
stick<00:01:54.689> together<00:01:54.810> that<00:01:55.170> means<00:01:55.350> it's<00:01:55.619> ready<00:01:55.860> to

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
stick together that means it's ready to

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.039 
stick together that means it's ready to
press<00:01:56.280> into<00:01:56.430> your<00:01:56.640> tin<00:01:56.850> what<00:01:57.479> I've<00:01:57.570> got<00:01:57.750> here

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
lined it in a really lazy way which is

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.850 
lined it in a really lazy way which is
just<00:02:03.119> taking<00:02:03.329> some<00:02:03.810> nonstick<00:02:04.290> paper<00:02:04.500> and

pressing it in making sure it gets into

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.410

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
so this is the fun bit where you need to

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.720 
so this is the fun bit where you need to
squash<00:02:22.049> the<00:02:22.320> dough<00:02:22.470> down<00:02:22.709> just<00:02:23.459> use<00:02:23.579> your

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
squash the dough down just use your

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.250 
squash the dough down just use your
hands<00:02:23.910> to<00:02:24.120> do<00:02:24.239> this<00:02:24.390> it's<00:02:24.630> the<00:02:24.660> easiest<00:02:24.989> way

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
hands to do this it's the easiest way

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.030 
hands to do this it's the easiest way
and<00:02:26.150> you<00:02:27.150> need<00:02:27.299> to<00:02:27.540> kind<00:02:28.380> of<00:02:28.500> try<00:02:28.650> get<00:02:28.829> it<00:02:28.920> as

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
and you need to kind of try get it as

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.039 
and you need to kind of try get it as
even<00:02:29.190> as<00:02:29.430> possible<00:02:29.489> because<00:02:30.150> that<00:02:30.329> way<00:02:30.690> you'll

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:31.049 
even as possible because that way you'll

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:33.199 
even as possible because that way you'll
get<00:02:31.200> a<00:02:31.230> really<00:02:31.440> even<00:02:31.829> bake<00:02:32.070> so<00:02:32.850> that's<00:02:33.000> nice

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
get a really even bake so that's nice

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:35.000 
get a really even bake so that's nice
and<00:02:33.449> even<00:02:33.780> now<00:02:33.959> I've<00:02:34.109> patted<00:02:34.440> it<00:02:34.530> down<00:02:34.709> it's

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
and even now I've patted it down it's

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.290 
and even now I've patted it down it's
ready<00:02:35.160> to<00:02:35.310> go<00:02:35.400> in<00:02:35.609> the<00:02:35.699> oven<00:02:36.000> for<00:02:36.329> about<00:02:36.419> 20<00:02:36.930> to

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
ready to go in the oven for about 20 to

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:42.000 
ready to go in the oven for about 20 to
five<00:02:37.510> minutes<00:02:40.200> so<00:02:41.200> the<00:02:41.320> shortbread<00:02:41.680> has

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
five minutes so the shortbread has

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.400 
five minutes so the shortbread has
cooled<00:02:42.340> completely<00:02:42.610> and<00:02:43.270> now<00:02:43.780> I'm<00:02:44.080> going<00:02:44.290> to

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
cooled completely and now I'm going to

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:46.620 
cooled completely and now I'm going to
add<00:02:44.560> the<00:02:44.740> caramel<00:02:45.130> to<00:02:45.280> the<00:02:45.370> top<00:02:45.580> this<00:02:46.270> is<00:02:46.450> just

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:46.630

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.390 
add the caramel to the top this is just
tinned<00:02:46.900> karamo<00:02:47.320> you<00:02:47.380> can<00:02:47.560> get<00:02:47.650> it<00:02:47.740> in<00:02:47.800> a<00:02:47.860> jar<00:02:48.160> as

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:48.400 
tinned karamo you can get it in a jar as

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.070 
tinned karamo you can get it in a jar as
well<00:02:48.580> if<00:02:48.970> you<00:02:49.120> want<00:02:49.330> to<00:02:49.450> make<00:02:49.660> your<00:02:49.810> own<00:02:49.960> you

well if you want to make your own you

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.990 
well if you want to make your own you
can<00:02:50.290> but<00:02:50.500> to<00:02:50.590> be<00:02:50.680> honest<00:02:50.980> it's<00:02:51.190> a<00:02:51.310> lot<00:02:51.550> easier

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
can but to be honest it's a lot easier

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.210 
can but to be honest it's a lot easier
and<00:02:52.060> quicker<00:02:52.300> just<00:02:52.570> to<00:02:52.870> buy<00:02:53.050> it<00:02:53.110> so<00:02:53.830> I'm<00:02:54.010> just

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
and quicker just to buy it so I'm just

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.440 
and quicker just to buy it so I'm just
going<00:02:54.490> to<00:02:54.580> pour<00:02:55.120> this<00:02:55.240> over<00:02:55.420> the<00:02:55.630> top<00:02:55.900> just

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
going to pour this over the top just

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.720 
going to pour this over the top just
ease<00:02:58.450> it<00:02:58.600> over<00:02:58.990> and<00:02:59.230> then<00:03:00.070> pop<00:03:00.310> it<00:03:00.460> into<00:03:00.580> the

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
ease it over and then pop it into the

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.410 
ease it over and then pop it into the
fridge<00:03:01.000> for<00:03:02.130> about<00:03:03.130> 20<00:03:03.610> minutes<00:03:03.820> just<00:03:04.030> to<00:03:04.300> let

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
fridge for about 20 minutes just to let

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:10.560 
fridge for about 20 minutes just to let
that<00:03:04.540> harden<00:03:04.810> up<00:03:05.050> a<00:03:05.140> little<00:03:05.290> bit<00:03:09.450> so<00:03:10.450> the

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:10.570 
that harden up a little bit so the

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:12.330 
that harden up a little bit so the
shortbread<00:03:10.930> and<00:03:11.290> the<00:03:11.350> caramel<00:03:11.740> have<00:03:12.160> been

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
shortbread and the caramel have been

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:13.560 
shortbread and the caramel have been
sitting<00:03:12.580> in<00:03:12.610> the<00:03:12.700> fridge<00:03:12.880> for<00:03:12.910> about<00:03:13.090> 20

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:13.570 
sitting in the fridge for about 20

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:15.720 
sitting in the fridge for about 20
minutes<00:03:13.810> so<00:03:14.080> they're<00:03:14.590> slightly<00:03:14.950> hardened<00:03:15.550> up

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
minutes so they're slightly hardened up

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.120 
minutes so they're slightly hardened up
on<00:03:15.970> the<00:03:16.150> top<00:03:16.420> I've<00:03:17.290> got<00:03:17.500> some<00:03:17.650> white<00:03:17.890> chocolate

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130 
on the top I've got some white chocolate

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.100 
on the top I've got some white chocolate
here<00:03:18.520> that<00:03:18.760> I<00:03:18.790> melted<00:03:19.270> awhile<00:03:19.480> ago<00:03:19.690> and<00:03:20.020> I've

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.110 
here that I melted awhile ago and I've

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:21.900 
here that I melted awhile ago and I've
let<00:03:20.410> it<00:03:20.620> cool<00:03:20.890> because<00:03:21.250> what<00:03:21.430> you<00:03:21.520> don't<00:03:21.730> want

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 
let it cool because what you don't want

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.780 
let it cool because what you don't want
to<00:03:22.090> do<00:03:22.270> is<00:03:22.450> put<00:03:22.660> hot<00:03:22.900> chocolate<00:03:23.470> onto<00:03:23.830> cold

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
to do is put hot chocolate onto cold

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.600 
to do is put hot chocolate onto cold
caramel<00:03:25.360> because<00:03:25.630> it<00:03:26.350> will<00:03:26.500> seep<00:03:26.830> through<00:03:27.310> and

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 
caramel because it will seep through and

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:28.710 
caramel because it will seep through and
we<00:03:27.730> don't<00:03:27.940> want<00:03:28.060> that<00:03:28.090> we<00:03:28.270> want<00:03:28.300> some<00:03:28.570> nice

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
we don't want that we want some nice

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.620 
we don't want that we want some nice
layers<00:03:29.020> now<00:03:29.830> we<00:03:30.490> need<00:03:30.700> to<00:03:30.760> add<00:03:30.910> here<00:03:30.940> I've<00:03:31.480> got

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630 
layers now we need to add here I've got

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.250 
layers now we need to add here I've got
some<00:03:31.810> oil<00:03:31.990> and<00:03:32.410> I<00:03:32.830> add<00:03:32.980> about<00:03:33.190> a<00:03:33.790> tablespoon

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
some oil and I add about a tablespoon

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.470 
some oil and I add about a tablespoon
the<00:03:35.260> reason<00:03:35.560> for<00:03:35.680> doing<00:03:35.740> this<00:03:35.920> is<00:03:36.120> it<00:03:37.120> makes

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
the reason for doing this is it makes

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.180 
the reason for doing this is it makes
the<00:03:37.690> chocolate<00:03:37.840> that<00:03:38.140> really<00:03:38.350> glossy<00:03:38.530> when<00:03:39.100> it

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
the chocolate that really glossy when it

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.930 
the chocolate that really glossy when it
sets<00:03:39.460> and<00:03:39.790> it<00:03:40.690> also<00:03:41.220> makes<00:03:42.220> it<00:03:42.340> much<00:03:42.640> much

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
sets and it also makes it much much

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.790 
sets and it also makes it much much
easier<00:03:43.150> to<00:03:43.480> cut<00:03:43.780> because<00:03:44.230> if<00:03:44.350> you've<00:03:44.560> ever

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:44.800 
easier to cut because if you've ever

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.949 
easier to cut because if you've ever
tried<00:03:45.160> to<00:03:45.370> cut<00:03:45.580> just<00:03:46.180> plain<00:03:46.420> chocolate<00:03:46.660> that

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 
tried to cut just plain chocolate that

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:49.740 
tried to cut just plain chocolate that
set<00:03:47.230> it<00:03:47.830> kind<00:03:48.070> of<00:03:48.130> fragments<00:03:48.790> and<00:03:48.970> cracks

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
set it kind of fragments and cracks

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:50.940 
set it kind of fragments and cracks
really<00:03:50.050> easily<00:03:50.260> and<00:03:50.350> this<00:03:50.620> will<00:03:50.800> make<00:03:50.890> it

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
really easily and this will make it

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:54.330 
really easily and this will make it
easier<00:03:51.340> so<00:03:51.670> top<00:03:52.180> tip<00:03:52.209> there<00:03:52.690> I'm<00:03:53.230> now<00:03:53.920> going<00:03:54.250> to

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
easier so top tip there I'm now going to

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:55.530 
easier so top tip there I'm now going to
pull<00:03:54.550> this<00:03:54.670> over<00:03:54.790> the<00:03:54.940> top<00:03:55.120> now<00:03:55.270> there's<00:03:55.480> a

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540

over<00:04:10.900> like<00:04:11.560> this<00:04:12.780> so<00:04:13.780> I'm<00:04:14.080> just<00:04:14.260> using<00:04:14.440> a<00:04:14.650> spoon

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:14.800 
over like this so I'm just using a spoon

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.860 
over like this so I'm just using a spoon
here<00:04:15.250> to<00:04:15.580> smooth<00:04:15.910> the<00:04:16.120> white<00:04:16.270> chocolate<00:04:16.750> over

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:20.410 
the top and get out to the edges and

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:23.610 
the top and get out to the edges and
then<00:04:20.830> I've<00:04:21.549> got<00:04:22.000> lots<00:04:22.990> of<00:04:23.140> chocolate<00:04:23.440> coins

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:25.560 
then I've got lots of chocolate coins
here<00:04:23.950> because<00:04:24.880> I<00:04:24.910> thought<00:04:25.210> this<00:04:25.330> might<00:04:25.510> be

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 
here because I thought this might be

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:27.330 
here because I thought this might be
quite<00:04:25.780> Christmassy<00:04:26.290> but<00:04:26.470> you<00:04:26.590> could<00:04:26.919> use

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:27.340 
quite Christmassy but you could use

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:29.550 
quite Christmassy but you could use
anything<00:04:28.060> you<00:04:28.150> want<00:04:28.360> you<00:04:28.870> could<00:04:28.990> bash<00:04:29.230> up<00:04:29.410> your

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
anything you want you could bash up your

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.040 
anything you want you could bash up your
favorite<00:04:29.950> sweets<00:04:30.250> and<00:04:30.460> put<00:04:30.550> them<00:04:30.669> on<00:04:30.730> the<00:04:30.790> top

favorite sweets and put them on the top

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:35.790
