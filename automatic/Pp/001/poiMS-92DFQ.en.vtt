 transmits today 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:07.949

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:18.349
 keyboards 

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:20.339
 more rub 

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:22.979

00:00:22.979 --> 00:00:23.929
 to extinguish 

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:26.599
 and found a typo 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:28.419
 also noticeable 

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:29.739
 I think no 

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:31.419
 Suburban Headphones 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:33.290
 on the front panel only 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.640
 Well, no one else 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.290
 rub 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:40.500
 here is the key

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.800

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.670
 run 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.710
 no 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.940
 it could be 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.940
 make sure that the sound works 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:07.380
 TV goes three frames 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:12.270
 a family of 509 million tons per year stated this 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.870
 the minister 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:17.200
 but there will be no sense 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.370
 i.e 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:21.370

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.990
 noodles were convinced that leaving the sound 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.760
