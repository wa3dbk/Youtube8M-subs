00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:01.699 
thousand people living there and but

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:03.729 
thousand people living there and but
still<00:01:01.970> not<00:01:02.180> a<00:01:02.210> big<00:01:02.540> town<00:01:02.869> instance<00:01:03.350> so<00:01:03.559> they

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:03.739 
still not a big town instance so they

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:05.320
