00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:06.620
 and he squatter with napkins 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.510
 number 2 beautiful floral organizer box 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:10.370
 of desktop and much more busy 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:13.690
 with napkins number 2 of editions 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:13.690
 welcome safety pin 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.240
 normal thanks good let's make a 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.189
 discourse on glass the first thing that 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.689
 we have to do is with a cloth with 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.279
 a paper peace napkin and a 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.050
 little bit of alcohol we are going to degrease 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.869
 all surfaces and we will clean 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.369
 well the glass after we will choose 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.680
 a napkin that is Christmas in this 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.000
 case i chose this one that has four designs 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.250
 on a napkin that's very 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.230
 important because we're going to do four 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.269
 different things are even in 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.239
 different positions what I 'm going to do 

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:46.769
 is to remove the layers of paper and a 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.260
 once I remove the paper capes 

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:51.960
 I have it here 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.640
 let's use a punch we're going to 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.320
 place it on a lenz cloth and what 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.500
 I'm going to do with the punch I'm going to 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.710
 cut to tear 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.170
 and this we already did in another opportunity 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:05.309
 then cutting in this way 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:08.250
 We tear the napkin and we have left 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.800
 with a totally different effect from 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.620
 this way to be we look at it well and 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:16.050
 well once we have all this 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:18.270
 fact that it would be this that is here that 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:20.490
 we have here we are going to start doing 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.970
 our decoupage I am going to use a 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.970
 Brush 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:28.710
 is the flat with soft bristles I'm going to 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:30.420
 place glue little amount of 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.150
 glue 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.710
 on the surface of the glass and on the 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.940
 surface where we are going to paste 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.450
 this design 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:41.320
 let's spend like this little amount 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.260
 remember that it has to be little 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:47.020
 quantity and what we are going to do we are going to 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:49.960
 paste it in the center we drop and 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.450
 then we helped each other with the brush from 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:56.020
 the center towards us we see that 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:58.120
 get out 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:02.830
 more glue 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:05.620
 and we go back there until everything sticks 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:07.990
 the design like that once we make 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:10.660
 this what I'm going to do is let it 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:13.620
 dry a little bit and after these and 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:16.180
 dry I will pass another hand over 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.760
 glue because because I need that 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.950
 this is totally sealed then 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.860
 once this dry well again 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.270
 pass a hand of glue over 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.630
 because I'm here what I'm going to do 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:31.360
 then it's going to be painted white to 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:33.040
 that this when you look at it 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.530
 the most intense color but of what 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.720
 the opposite is translucent and because it left 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.850
 paste I have to let dry what 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.170
 first I did because so that later 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:43.210
 wrinkle the napkin that's very 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.370
 important then once this is 

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:47.630
 dried we passed the hand of glue and 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:51.020
 we let it dry 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:53.780
 once this dried up let's do 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:55.640
 next thing I in the back of the 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.080
 design here I have done half in the 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.320
 back and if we are not going to paint 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.760
 everything with white acrylic that's 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.680
 very important because in this way 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.530
 I said something like sue before 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.390
 intensify more the color look at this and 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.850
 look at this look that looks like more 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:12.890
 translucent and this is more intense 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:14.510
 brush strokes will not be noticed at all 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:16.700
 What worries people the most is that 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.890
 whether the brush strokes are noticed or not is not 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.780
 they notice for nothing then what I'm going to 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:24.140
 to do is to paint all this white 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.970
 I let it dry and now with a sponge it is 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:28.910
 very important this with a sponge 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:30.920
 closed frame and school vinyl tail 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:32.390
 is what you get in bookstores what 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.110
 what I'm going to do is load with cola 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:38.130
 vinyl 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:41.460
 and I'm going to do this I'm going to trust all the 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:43.620
 part of the design outline so that 

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:46.260
 I left a face that side this is a 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:48.720
 craquelure economic good very simple 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:51.150
 that surely all of us have 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:53.080
 at home and more those that have 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.940
 little ones 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:57.700
 then they go like this and they go 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:59.920
 placing the amount or do not skimp 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:01.780
 the amount of vinyl glue because 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.130
 The more we are going to put it better, it will 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:08.819
 be 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:11.870
 in this way we place the entire contour 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:11.870
 of glass 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:17.750
 with the biblical tail this we have to 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:20.450
 let dry about three or 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:22.070
 four minutes not much is little what 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:24.360
 that we have to let dry and what I'm going 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:28.830
 to do now is to take 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:31.740
 my white acrylic and with another 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:34.530
 sponge I 'm going to take I 'm going to carry the 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:36.719
 acrylic white and still wet to 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:37.800
 the vinyl tail but if I do not know what not 

00:04:36.719 --> 00:04:41.849
 we have to do is remove is 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:46.339
 just touch like that on the surface 

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:46.339
 it's very just what I have to do 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:53.139
 because in this way if I'm going to remove 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:55.360
 the vinyl tail I will take the effect 

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:58.710
 what I want to achieve in exchange for this 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:02.470
 way I will not stay the effect 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:05.770
 perfectly and so we are going to do everything 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:08.650
 the outline and once we have done 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:10.240
 this I will use a dryer 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:11.500
 hair ideally is a dryer 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:14.770
 hair in this way opens up more 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:16.660
 fast all the craquelure then 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:18.520
 in this way here I was left 

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:19.660
 craquelado fully well let's 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:22.540
 do it this way on this side so that 

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:24.370
 you see how the craquelure was not 

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:26.530
 let it dry just do it with a 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:28.690
 hair dryer once I have 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:34.160
 done this what I will use is going to be a 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:36.410
 brush and an acrylic an acrylic gold 

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:39.310
 and what we're going to do, we're just going 

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:41.920
 to try to paint 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:43.960
 the whole part is crack 

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:48.610
 frost 

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:49.900
 so that the golden can be seen 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:51.610
 we put color over us 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:53.139
 like it can be red also to me 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:54.940
 it seemed that it was much prettier 

00:05:53.139 --> 00:05:57.360
 golden then what I'm going to do is 

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:57.360
 place 

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:04.630
 the acrylic this 

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:04.630
 we let it dry well 

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:09.070
 and once we let everything dry 

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:12.010
 this sold 

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:15.070
 there it is there we have the golden one we are going to 

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:19.000
 let this dry perfectly and what 

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:21.010
 I did this done is to hit it 

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.770
 can be with the gun in dora queue or 

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:25.750
 it can be with the glue is it 

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:29.440
 snap a cord instantly 

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:30.760
 around you put a bow and also what 

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:33.460
 what I did was with the painting 

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:36.010
 three-dimensional contour and everything in the 

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:38.140
 design and you have a little fiber is 

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:40.210
 a very simple easy thing to 

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:41.680
 that all of you can do and that 

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:43.150
 be a nice gift for Christmas or 

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:47.580
 soon to hang in a corner of the 

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:47.580
 good house normal thanks see you
