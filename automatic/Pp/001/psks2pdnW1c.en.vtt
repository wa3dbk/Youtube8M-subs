lines and wrinkles and has collagen and
elastin<00:02:39.750> proteins<00:02:40.290> so<00:02:41.069> your<00:02:41.250> skin<00:02:41.430> used

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
elastin proteins so your skin used

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.190 
elastin proteins so your skin used

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
collagen to make it stay youthful was

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.530 
collagen to make it stay youthful was
when<00:02:46.350> you<00:02:46.440> run<00:02:46.620> out<00:02:46.650> of<00:02:46.769> collagen<00:02:47.540> elasticity

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
when you run out of collagen elasticity

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.210 
when you run out of collagen elasticity
and<00:02:48.690> your<00:02:48.840> skin<00:02:49.170> like<00:02:49.410> decreases<00:02:50.010> and<00:02:50.070> that's

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
and your skin like decreases and that's

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.180 
and your skin like decreases and that's
how<00:02:50.340> you<00:02:50.400> get<00:02:50.519> wrinkles<00:02:50.940> and<00:02:51.150> saggy<00:02:51.540> so<00:02:52.440> I<00:02:52.890> mean

you<00:05:21.010> guys<00:05:21.130> have<00:05:21.310> seen<00:05:21.340> this<00:05:21.729> but<00:05:22.000> it's<00:05:22.150> oh<00:05:22.210> it

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:22.300 
you guys have seen this but it's oh it

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:25.500 
you guys have seen this but it's oh it
just<00:05:22.330> comes<00:05:22.660> out<00:05:22.780> anything<00:05:23.020> like<00:05:23.290> that<00:05:24.270> and<00:05:25.270> I

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:25.510 
just comes out anything like that and I

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:27.300 
just comes out anything like that and I
just<00:05:25.570> will<00:05:25.900> dab<00:05:26.229> it<00:05:26.380> on<00:05:26.500> like<00:05:26.740> wherever<00:05:27.010> I<00:05:27.100> have

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:27.310 
just will dab it on like wherever I have

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:30.240 
just will dab it on like wherever I have
a<00:05:27.340> pimple<00:05:27.729> and<00:05:28.060> it<00:05:28.600> makes<00:05:28.960> it<00:05:29.169> disappear<00:05:29.860> a<00:05:29.919> lot

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:30.250 
a pimple and it makes it disappear a lot

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:33.270 
a pimple and it makes it disappear a lot
faster<00:05:30.729> so<00:05:31.450> if<00:05:31.900> you<00:05:32.140> don't<00:05:32.289> have<00:05:32.440> like<00:05:32.860> if<00:05:33.190> you

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:33.280 
faster so if you don't have like if you

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:34.680 
faster so if you don't have like if you
have<00:05:33.400> more<00:05:33.610> oily<00:05:33.910> skin<00:05:34.150> you<00:05:34.360> could<00:05:34.570> probably

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:34.690 
have more oily skin you could probably

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:36.630 
have more oily skin you could probably
use<00:05:34.930> this<00:05:35.050> all<00:05:35.229> of<00:05:35.320> your<00:05:35.470> face<00:05:35.680> but<00:05:36.010> I<00:05:36.280> have

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:36.640 
use this all of your face but I have

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:40.350 
use this all of your face but I have
more<00:05:36.970> normal<00:05:37.960> combination<00:05:38.340> so<00:05:39.340> that's<00:05:39.789> it<00:05:40.120> for

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:40.360 
more normal combination so that's it for

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.180
