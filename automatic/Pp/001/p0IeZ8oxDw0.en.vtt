so any KLR 650 from 2008 to 2013 and
you'll<00:00:18.690> be<00:00:18.810> able<00:00:18.900> to<00:00:19.199> change<00:00:19.680> either<00:00:20.010> the<00:00:20.279> low

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
you'll be able to change either the low

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.230 
you'll be able to change either the low
beam<00:00:21.029> or<00:00:21.240> high<00:00:21.390> beam<00:00:22.220> low<00:00:23.220> beam<00:00:23.400> is<00:00:23.550> right<00:00:23.760> here

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
beam or high beam low beam is right here

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.339 
beam or high beam low beam is right here
and<00:00:24.449> high<00:00:24.990> beams<00:00:25.260> right<00:00:25.710> here<00:00:27.230> some<00:00:28.230> people

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
and high beams right here some people

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.820 
and high beams right here some people
are<00:00:28.560> able<00:00:28.740> to<00:00:29.449> reach<00:00:30.449> underneath<00:00:30.840> this<00:00:31.140> upper

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
are able to reach underneath this upper

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.860 
are able to reach underneath this upper
fairing<00:00:32.250> and<00:00:32.489> reach<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:33.090> halogen<00:00:33.540> headlight

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
fairing and reach the halogen headlight

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.160 
fairing and reach the halogen headlight
bulbs<00:00:34.170> that<00:00:34.260> way<00:00:34.880> and<00:00:35.880> take<00:00:36.180> them<00:00:36.360> out<00:00:36.570> but<00:00:36.960> it

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
bulbs that way and take them out but it

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.160 
bulbs that way and take them out but it
requires<00:00:37.530> you<00:00:37.710> have<00:00:37.829> really<00:00:38.070> skinny<00:00:38.340> arms<00:00:38.730> and

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:39.170 
requires you have really skinny arms and

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.780 
requires you have really skinny arms and
you<00:00:40.170> have<00:00:40.290> to<00:00:40.440> know<00:00:40.530> how<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:41.550> bulb

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
you have to know how the the bulb

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.340 
you have to know how the the bulb
attaches<00:00:42.329> to<00:00:42.480> the<00:00:42.570> upper<00:00:42.600> fairing<00:00:43.110> because

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
attaches to the upper fairing because

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.869 
attaches to the upper fairing because
you<00:00:43.440> can't<00:00:43.649> see<00:00:43.800> what<00:00:43.950> you're<00:00:44.070> doing<00:00:44.430> and<00:00:44.730> you

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
you can't see what you're doing and you

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.360 
you can't see what you're doing and you
have<00:00:45.030> to<00:00:45.149> pretty<00:00:45.300> much<00:00:45.450> do<00:00:45.660> it<00:00:45.750> by<00:00:45.899> feel<00:00:46.170> so<00:00:46.559> the

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
have to pretty much do it by feel so the

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:48.619 
have to pretty much do it by feel so the
way<00:00:47.489> that<00:00:47.640> I'm<00:00:47.730> going<00:00:47.789> to<00:00:47.910> do<00:00:48.059> it<00:00:48.210> is<00:00:48.329> I'm<00:00:48.510> going

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
way that I'm going to do it is I'm going

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.779 
way that I'm going to do it is I'm going
to<00:00:48.719> detach<00:00:49.379> this<00:00:49.710> upper<00:00:50.070> fairing<00:00:50.460> which<00:00:50.640> is

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
to detach this upper fairing which is

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.630 
to detach this upper fairing which is
this<00:00:51.000> part<00:00:51.270> of<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.390> bike<00:00:51.629> and<00:00:52.219> when<00:00:53.219> I<00:00:53.250> do<00:00:53.370> that

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
this part of the bike and when I do that

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.600 
this part of the bike and when I do that
I<00:00:53.670> can<00:00:53.850> move<00:00:54.210> it<00:00:54.449> forward<00:00:54.930> and<00:00:55.430> that<00:00:56.430> will

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
I can move it forward and that will

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.939 
I can move it forward and that will
reveal<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.120> sockets<00:00:57.570> for<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:57.870> two<00:00:58.590> headlight

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
reveal the sockets for the two headlight

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.099 
reveal the sockets for the two headlight
bulbs<00:00:59.280> will<00:00:59.460> low<00:00:59.550> beam<00:00:59.730> in<00:00:59.850> the<00:00:59.910> high<00:01:00.059> beam<00:01:00.270> and

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
bulbs will low beam in the high beam and

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.460 
bulbs will low beam in the high beam and
to<00:01:02.180> detach<00:01:03.180> a<00:01:03.390> separate<00:01:03.750> fairing<00:01:04.140> you<00:01:04.229> need<00:01:04.379> to

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
to detach a separate fairing you need to

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.020 
to detach a separate fairing you need to
remove<00:01:04.739> this<00:01:04.979> screw<00:01:05.129> here<00:01:05.990> another<00:01:06.990> one<00:01:07.200> here

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030

screws and four bolts to remove all

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:33.830 
screws and four bolts to remove all
right<00:01:33.000> so<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.240> first<00:01:33.390> thing<00:01:33.630> I'm<00:01:33.689> going<00:01:33.720> to

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
right so the first thing I'm going to

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.870 
right so the first thing I'm going to
remove<00:01:34.079> are<00:01:34.259> these<00:01:34.380> two<00:01:34.619> screws<00:01:34.979> here<00:01:35.009> there

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
remove are these two screws here there

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.289 
remove are these two screws here there
are<00:01:35.939> two<00:01:36.060> Phillips<00:01:36.299> screws<00:01:36.780> and<00:01:37.820> in<00:01:38.820> between

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
are two Phillips screws and in between

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.380 
are two Phillips screws and in between
this<00:01:39.780> piece<00:01:40.170> and<00:01:40.439> this<00:01:40.799> piece<00:01:40.860> is<00:01:41.460> a<00:01:41.909> metal

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
this piece and this piece is a metal

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.210 
this piece and this piece is a metal
spacer<00:01:42.869> which<00:01:43.020> is<00:01:43.140> held<00:01:43.380> on<00:01:43.500> by<00:01:43.680> these<00:01:43.890> screws

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
spacer which is held on by these screws

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.410 
spacer which is held on by these screws
so<00:01:44.520> when<00:01:45.420> you<00:01:45.509> remove<00:01:45.689> these<00:01:47.119> make<00:01:48.119> sure<00:01:48.149> you

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
so when you remove these make sure you

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.100 
so when you remove these make sure you
don't<00:01:50.000> drop<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.210> spacer<00:01:51.659> because<00:01:51.840> they<00:01:51.960> can

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
don't drop the spacer because they can

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:59.270 
don't drop the spacer because they can
be<00:01:52.229> hard<00:01:52.439> to<00:01:52.500> find<00:01:55.640> and<00:01:56.640> that's<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:58.280> spacer

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
be hard to find and that's the spacer

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.940 
be hard to find and that's the spacer
and<00:01:59.310> then<00:01:59.790> on<00:01:59.939> each<00:02:00.180> screw<00:02:00.600> there<00:02:00.960> is<00:02:01.200> a<00:02:01.469> washer

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
and then on each screw there is a washer

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.999 
and then on each screw there is a washer
so<00:02:02.899> just<00:02:03.899> make<00:02:04.049> sure<00:02:04.079> you<00:02:04.290> get<00:02:04.439> those<00:02:04.680> and

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
so just make sure you get those and

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.080 
so just make sure you get those and
don't<00:02:05.130> drop<00:02:05.430> them<00:02:07.550> next<00:02:08.550> I'm<00:02:08.670> going<00:02:08.759> to<00:02:08.849> remove

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
don't drop them next I'm going to remove

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.220 
don't drop them next I'm going to remove
the<00:02:09.390> two<00:02:09.750> five<00:02:10.349> millimeter<00:02:10.800> bolt

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
the two five millimeter bolt

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:25.740 
the two five millimeter bolt
here<00:02:22.680> and<00:02:23.680> then<00:02:24.040> for<00:02:24.310> the<00:02:24.400> last<00:02:24.670> two<00:02:25.000> are<00:02:25.450> these

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
here and then for the last two are these

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:33.860 
here and then for the last two are these
kind<00:02:26.620> of<00:02:26.680> hard<00:02:26.920> to<00:02:27.010> see<00:02:30.120> bolts<00:02:31.120> on<00:02:31.870> each<00:02:32.019> side

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
kind of hard to see bolts on each side

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.570 
kind of hard to see bolts on each side
and<00:02:34.870> then<00:02:35.019> once<00:02:35.260> you<00:02:35.379> have<00:02:35.560> the<00:02:35.769> four<00:02:36.280> bolts

and two screws removed grab the fairing

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:44.789 
and two screws removed grab the fairing
lift<00:02:40.360> it<00:02:40.569> up<00:02:40.920> and<00:02:41.920> then<00:02:42.250> pull<00:02:42.549> one<00:02:42.849> side<00:02:43.650> to<00:02:44.650> the

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:44.799 
lift it up and then pull one side to the

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:50.759 
lift it up and then pull one side to the
side<00:02:45.069> and<00:02:45.430> then<00:02:45.970> forward<00:02:46.799> and<00:02:47.799> you<00:02:48.040> can<00:02:49.769> move

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:50.769 
side and then forward and you can move

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:52.680 
side and then forward and you can move
the<00:02:50.980> whole<00:02:51.099> of<00:02:51.370> repairing<00:02:51.790> forward<00:02:52.269> and<00:02:52.450> that

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
the whole of repairing forward and that

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.550 
the whole of repairing forward and that
will<00:02:52.870> reveal<00:02:53.290> the<00:02:53.560> two<00:02:54.099> two<00:02:54.670> sockets<00:02:54.940> for<00:02:55.239> the

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
will reveal the two two sockets for the

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.069 
will reveal the two two sockets for the
halogen<00:02:56.560> headlight<00:02:56.829> bulbs<00:02:57.390> and<00:02:58.390> then<00:02:58.900> these

00:02:59.069 --> 00:02:59.079 
halogen headlight bulbs and then these

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:00.900 
halogen headlight bulbs and then these
are<00:02:59.140> the<00:02:59.349> two<00:02:59.470> connectors<00:03:00.099> this<00:03:00.400> is<00:03:00.549> for<00:03:00.790> your

just kind of push it down and to the

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:47.949 
just kind of push it down and to the
side<00:03:41.709> let's<00:03:42.709> see<00:03:42.860> what<00:03:42.980> I<00:03:43.010> did<00:03:43.099> there<00:03:46.870> see<00:03:47.870> how

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:47.959 
side let's see what I did there see how

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:51.070

know before you get a replacement bulb
probably<00:04:13.819> the<00:04:13.910> most<00:04:14.030> important<00:04:14.540> thing<00:04:14.720> is<00:04:14.959> you

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:33.670 
Kawasaki dealer he didn't have any in
stock<00:04:31.910> but<00:04:32.330> he<00:04:32.479> told<00:04:32.750> me<00:04:32.900> that<00:04:33.020> I<00:04:33.080> needed<00:04:33.500> to

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 
stock but he told me that I needed to

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.890 
stock but he told me that I needed to
get<00:04:33.800> a<00:04:33.860> bulb<00:04:34.160> that<00:04:34.250> was<00:04:34.580> specially<00:04:35.510> made<00:04:35.540> just

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:35.900 
get a bulb that was specially made just

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.800 
get a bulb that was specially made just
for<00:04:36.050> motorcycles<00:04:36.710> because<00:04:37.160> if<00:04:37.820> I<00:04:38.270> didn't<00:04:38.660> the

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:38.810 
for motorcycles because if I didn't the

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:41.190 
for motorcycles because if I didn't the
vibration<00:04:39.440> would<00:04:39.620> cause<00:04:40.190> the<00:04:40.460> bulb<00:04:40.700> to<00:04:40.940> fail

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:41.200 
vibration would cause the bulb to fail

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.960 
vibration would cause the bulb to fail
so<00:04:42.200> because<00:04:42.830> he<00:04:42.919> didn't<00:04:43.130> have<00:04:43.220> any<00:04:43.280> in<00:04:43.550> stock<00:04:43.580> I

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:43.970 
so because he didn't have any in stock I

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:46.420 
so because he didn't have any in stock I
did<00:04:44.120> some<00:04:44.360> further<00:04:44.539> research<00:04:45.020> and<00:04:45.380> found<00:04:46.250> out

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430 
did some further research and found out

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:48.580 
did some further research and found out
that<00:04:46.460> the<00:04:46.729> Bob<00:04:46.910> Callas<00:04:47.450> Aki<00:04:47.660> installs<00:04:48.260> in

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:48.590 
that the Bob Callas Aki installs in

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:52.270 
that the Bob Callas Aki installs in
these<00:04:48.979> bikes<00:04:49.370> is<00:04:49.669> it<00:04:49.880> Philips<00:04:50.270> h7<00:04:50.990> and<00:04:51.280> Philips

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:52.280 
these bikes is it Philips h7 and Philips

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:55.390 
these bikes is it Philips h7 and Philips
part<00:04:52.580> number<00:04:52.880> is<00:04:53.060> one<00:04:53.900> two<00:04:54.110> nine<00:04:54.530> seven<00:04:55.160> two

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:55.400 
part number is one two nine seven two

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:59.080 
part number is one two nine seven two
and<00:04:55.669> it's<00:04:56.450> not<00:04:56.780> a<00:04:57.050> Bob<00:04:57.520> made<00:04:58.520> just<00:04:58.910> for

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.090 
and it's not a Bob made just for

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:02.770 
and it's not a Bob made just for
motorcycle<00:04:59.810> so<00:05:00.280> the<00:05:01.280> vibration<00:05:02.240> thing<00:05:02.479> is<00:05:02.630> not

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:02.780 
motorcycle so the vibration thing is not

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:04.450 
motorcycle so the vibration thing is not
an<00:05:02.960> issue<00:05:03.140> and<00:05:03.500> you<00:05:03.560> can<00:05:03.740> find<00:05:04.039> these<00:05:04.190> bulbs

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:04.460 
an issue and you can find these bulbs

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:07.750
