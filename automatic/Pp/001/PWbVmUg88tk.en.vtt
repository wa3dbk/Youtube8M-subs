00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 to change the bobbin case you 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.600
 need only a screwdriver we 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.740
 we have a thicker jet here and thought 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.900
 thinner 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.400
 If you need we have these to sell. 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.160
 our virtual store 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.719
 the apolo coil boxes they appear to be 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.940
 same but there are two models 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:21.660
 different, there are those that 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.910
 fitch personal calls and standard apolo 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.980
 the difference between surfing and apologetics 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.980
 if you look inside the sony fitch 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:34.669
 you will see that it has a 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.669
 inside recess 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:41.250
 Note that you will see inside until someone 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.110
 had taken it there because that difference 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.440
 Look at the reels, we can 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:50.340
 to better understand the apolo model to the coil 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:53.210
 she has both sides the same in the model 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:56.390
 sofit I see that fits in right 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:59.969
 models the fit is the lower bass part 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:04.830
 than the upper part and it is attempted 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:10.950
 inside the house came to a not 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:13.170
 in the other I took the ball she did not 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.930
 serves on the south and fitch model 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.479
 it does not fit because it does not have a 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.250
 Recess but put on the fitch 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.640
 another works the same thing works 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:27.540
 but she 'll be let go because she leaves 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.220
 lower is then always the coils 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.750
 and correct puppy 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.840
 Which are the models that wears pants 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:37.650
 model surfing single team surfing reels 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.460
 to close model closes this machine here 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:43.409
 O 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:47.240
 all the line close to coil 4205 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:47.240
 There's a filler like that here. 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:53.640
 the winner with that tooth is that 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:56.040
 works as a South and Fitch model that is 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.320
 where the boxed coil 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.740
 the other model the coil does not fit 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.960
 fill it tava not there not 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.330
 only this model uses its effects 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.959
 other models all like that already uses boxes 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:12.660
 at my door how to change is so let's 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:14.640
 there to change some models intake 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.680
 screw plate that will be needed 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.410
 two more screws but most of the 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:22.709
 machines are dowel plate withdraws 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:26.520
 slide plate raises the right side 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:28.170
 of the plate and pulls to disengage it to 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.330
 replace the coils with the screwdriver 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:34.320
 fine I'll put here on the beam line 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:37.860
 and spin it pushes there forward 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:40.050
 lifts back and pulls back to place 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:43.010
 the new one is the reverse process look I'm going 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:45.420
 put it back and fit in here 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:48.390
 I'll open it through the line 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:52.790
 and that tip that I have to fit into 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.790
 up the treadmill raise her now 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:58.200
 it goes down you think it's boring but 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:01.410
 I try not to know see the one I think 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:04.019
 perfectly if it happens to you. 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:06.690
 gasoline will become very loose that will 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:09.930
 necessary to skip this screw and this 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:11.459
 and adjust this position here if it stays 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.450
 very loose beef getting out 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:14.730
 alone 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:17.190
 if it gets too tight there it 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.959
 autonomy or tipping underneath 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.950
 sure you are ready to regulate justly 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:21.950
 That 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:30.930
 it can not be too much can not be too 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:34.050
 but she finished 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:37.319
 we put the needle plate back 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:39.510
 the inverse process is equivalent to the sun 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:41.730
 is docked and placed back in the 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:44.450
 cover plate is ready for exchange 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.450
 the pipe
