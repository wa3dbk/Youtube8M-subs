the<00:00:26.510> FTC<00:00:27.140> elementary<00:00:27.740> practice<00:00:28.250> test<00:00:28.550> it's<00:00:29.270> a

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:29.360 
the FTC elementary practice test it's a

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:33.100 
the FTC elementary practice test it's a
great<00:00:29.720> problem<00:00:30.259> to<00:00:30.290> review<00:00:32.110> algebraic

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:33.110 
great problem to review algebraic

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.190 
great problem to review algebraic
functions<00:00:33.770> it's<00:00:34.430> a<00:00:34.550> real<00:00:34.850> intro<00:00:35.360> problem<00:00:35.930> so

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:36.200 
functions it's a real intro problem so

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.290 
functions it's a real intro problem so
let's<00:00:36.410> take<00:00:36.620> a<00:00:36.650> look<00:00:36.860> which<00:00:37.790> the<00:00:38.030> following

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:38.300 
let's take a look which the following

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.780 
let's take a look which the following
models<00:00:38.989> would<00:00:39.650> be<00:00:39.830> most<00:00:40.070> appropriate<00:00:40.760> and

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:40.790 
models would be most appropriate and

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:43.360 
models would be most appropriate and
using<00:00:41.150> when<00:00:41.300> introducing<00:00:41.900> functions<00:00:42.440> and

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:43.370 
using when introducing functions and

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.100 
using when introducing functions and
then<00:00:43.489> we<00:00:43.519> have<00:00:43.730> a<00:00:43.760> bunch<00:00:44.000> of<00:00:44.150> options<00:00:44.360> would

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:45.110 
then we have a bunch of options would

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.350 
then we have a bunch of options would
you<00:00:45.320> use<00:00:45.650> fraction<00:00:46.430> bars<00:00:46.640> to<00:00:46.910> introduce

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:47.360 
you use fraction bars to introduce

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.229 
you use fraction bars to introduce
functions<00:00:47.840> or<00:00:48.500> geometric<00:00:49.129> solids<00:00:49.610> or

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:50.239 
functions or geometric solids or

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:53.639 
functions or geometric solids or
input-output<00:00:50.989> diagrams<00:00:51.500> or<00:00:52.070> line<00:00:52.430> graphs<00:00:52.760> I

00:00:53.639 --> 00:00:53.649 
input-output diagrams or line graphs I

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:56.799 
input-output diagrams or line graphs I
think<00:00:54.649> we're<00:00:55.219> the<00:00:55.399> start<00:00:55.790> is<00:00:56.090> to<00:00:56.149> point<00:00:56.540> out

00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:56.809 
think we're the start is to point out

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:00.490 
think we're the start is to point out
where<00:00:57.800> you<00:00:57.950> would<00:00:58.129> begin<00:00:59.140> which<00:01:00.140> is<00:01:00.289> input

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:00.500 
where you would begin which is input

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.749 
where you would begin which is input
output<00:01:00.739> chart<00:01:01.489> now<00:01:02.270> let's<00:01:02.950> let's<00:01:03.950> use<00:01:04.369> input

00:01:04.749 --> 00:01:04.759 
output chart now let's let's use input

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:06.430 
output chart now let's let's use input
output<00:01:05.089> charts<00:01:05.390> to<00:01:05.539> create<00:01:05.780> a<00:01:05.810> function<00:01:06.259> a

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:06.440 
output charts to create a function a

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.830 
output charts to create a function a
function<00:01:06.740> by<00:01:07.340> the<00:01:07.399> way<00:01:07.670> describes<00:01:08.660> a

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
function by the way describes a

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.070 
function by the way describes a
relationship<00:01:09.470> between<00:01:09.649> two<00:01:10.100> variables<00:01:10.130> and

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:11.080 
relationship between two variables and

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.560 
relationship between two variables and
let's<00:01:12.080> say<00:01:12.320> I<00:01:12.350> had<00:01:12.920> an<00:01:13.430> input-output<00:01:14.270> chart

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
let's say I had an input-output chart

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:19.810 
let's say I had an input-output chart
and<00:01:14.810> my<00:01:15.229> two<00:01:15.289> variables<00:01:16.240> were<00:01:17.240> x<00:01:17.539> and<00:01:17.990> y<00:01:18.800> x<00:01:19.399> is

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 
and my two variables were x and y x is

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.800 
and my two variables were x and y x is
going<00:01:20.000> to<00:01:20.060> be<00:01:20.180> my<00:01:20.330> input<00:01:20.810> and<00:01:22.450> Y<00:01:23.450> is<00:01:23.509> going<00:01:23.720> to

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
going to be my input and Y is going to

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.040 
going to be my input and Y is going to
be<00:01:23.869> my<00:01:24.110> output<00:01:24.940> now<00:01:25.940> this<00:01:26.149> chart<00:01:26.569> is<00:01:26.810> going<00:01:26.990> to

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:27.050 
be my output now this chart is going to

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.389 
be my output now this chart is going to
model<00:01:27.920> the<00:01:28.459> relationship<00:01:28.640> between<00:01:29.360> x<00:01:29.720> and<00:01:29.869> y

00:01:30.389 --> 00:01:30.399 
model the relationship between x and y

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:34.830 
model the relationship between x and y
for<00:01:31.399> example<00:01:31.789> I<00:01:32.319> put<00:01:33.319> in<00:01:33.470> a<00:01:33.560> 1<00:01:33.770> here<00:01:34.250> and

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840 
for example I put in a 1 here and

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.219 
for example I put in a 1 here and
outcomes

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:36.229 
outcomes

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:41.350 
outcomes
let's<00:01:36.440> say<00:01:38.020> outcomes<00:01:39.020> a<00:01:39.229> 3<00:01:40.030> now<00:01:41.030> let's<00:01:41.209> say<00:01:41.330> I

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
let's say outcomes a 3 now let's say I

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.870 
let's say outcomes a 3 now let's say I
put<00:01:41.780> in<00:01:41.990> a<00:01:42.220> 2<00:01:43.220> here<00:01:43.670> and<00:01:43.880> outcomes<00:01:44.569> like<00:01:45.500> a<00:01:46.340> 4

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
put in a 2 here and outcomes like a 4

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.710 
put in a 2 here and outcomes like a 4
and<00:01:47.179> a<00:01:47.959> 3<00:01:48.170> and<00:01:48.530> out<00:01:49.250> comes<00:01:49.610> a<00:01:50.000> 5

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 
and a 3 and out comes a 5

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.770 
and a 3 and out comes a 5
well<00:01:51.500> how<00:01:51.979> am<00:01:52.009> I<00:01:52.220> going<00:01:52.459> from<00:01:52.910> what<00:01:53.330> am<00:01:53.420> i<00:01:53.509> doing

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
well how am I going from what am i doing

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.710 
well how am I going from what am i doing
to<00:01:53.899> X<00:01:54.050> to<00:01:54.319> get<00:01:54.500> to<00:01:54.679> why<00:01:55.239> some<00:01:56.239> of<00:01:56.270> you<00:01:56.479> may<00:01:56.690> be

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:56.720 
to X to get to why some of you may be

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.570 
to X to get to why some of you may be
like<00:01:56.989> well<00:01:57.289> it<00:01:57.410> looks<00:01:57.590> like<00:01:57.800> for<00:01:58.160> every<00:01:58.369> x

00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:58.580 
like well it looks like for every x

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.660 
like well it looks like for every x
value<00:01:59.000> that<00:01:59.030> you<00:01:59.390> have<00:01:59.590> you're<00:02:00.590> adding<00:02:01.039> to<00:02:01.340> and

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
value that you have you're adding to and

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.960 
value that you have you're adding to and
that<00:02:02.450> helps<00:02:02.780> you<00:02:02.869> get<00:02:03.020> to<00:02:03.200> Y<00:02:03.550> well<00:02:04.550> guess<00:02:04.759> what

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 
that helps you get to Y well guess what

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.350 
that helps you get to Y well guess what
this<00:02:05.390> is<00:02:05.599> your<00:02:05.780> function<00:02:06.020> you<00:02:06.640> input<00:02:07.640> it<00:02:08.000> you

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
this is your function you input it you

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.229 
this is your function you input it you
can<00:02:08.539> put<00:02:08.810> an<00:02:08.899> X<00:02:09.110> you<00:02:10.009> add<00:02:10.039> 2<00:02:10.550> to<00:02:10.700> whatever<00:02:10.910> input

00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:11.239 
can put an X you add 2 to whatever input

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:14.229 
can put an X you add 2 to whatever input
you<00:02:11.569> put<00:02:11.780> in<00:02:11.930> and<00:02:12.140> out<00:02:12.650> comes<00:02:12.920> a<00:02:13.040> Y<00:02:13.220> so<00:02:14.000> if<00:02:14.120> you

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:14.239 
you put in and out comes a Y so if you

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:17.890 
you put in and out comes a Y so if you
input<00:02:14.959> let's<00:02:15.200> say<00:02:15.410> a<00:02:15.440> 4<00:02:15.890> and<00:02:16.190> add<00:02:16.970> 2<00:02:17.330> to<00:02:17.569> it<00:02:17.599> out

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
input let's say a 4 and add 2 to it out

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.150 
input let's say a 4 and add 2 to it out
should<00:02:18.290> come<00:02:18.530> a<00:02:18.739> 6<00:02:19.870> this<00:02:20.870> input-output<00:02:21.860> chart

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
should come a 6 this input-output chart

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.680 
should come a 6 this input-output chart

the function or relationship between x

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.760 
the function or relationship between x
and<00:02:30.020> y<00:02:30.490> let's<00:02:31.490> look<00:02:31.640> at<00:02:31.730> a<00:02:31.760> little<00:02:31.910> harder<00:02:32.300> one

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:32.770 
and y let's look at a little harder one

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:34.840 
and y let's look at a little harder one
something<00:02:33.770> a<00:02:33.830> little<00:02:34.100> bit<00:02:34.190> more<00:02:34.220> challenging

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
something a little bit more challenging

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:35.650 
something a little bit more challenging
let's

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
let's

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.080 
let's
we<00:02:35.840> had<00:02:36.020> this<00:02:36.170> one<00:02:36.380> right<00:02:36.560> here<00:02:36.770> I<00:02:36.800> put<00:02:37.160> input<00:02:37.700> X

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
we had this one right here I put input X

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:44.140 
we had this one right here I put input X
here<00:02:38.840> as<00:02:39.070> my<00:02:40.070> inputs<00:02:40.460> are<00:02:40.580> 1<00:02:40.820> 2<00:02:41.300> 3<00:02:41.650> 4<00:02:42.650> 5<00:02:43.220> and<00:02:43.760> my

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
here as my inputs are 1 2 3 4 5 and my

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:50.530 
here as my inputs are 1 2 3 4 5 and my
outputs<00:02:44.630> are<00:02:44.810> 1<00:02:45.230> 4<00:02:45.860> 9<00:02:46.250> 16<00:02:47.240> and<00:02:47.900> 25<00:02:48.730> well<00:02:49.730> how<00:02:50.480> do

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
outputs are 1 4 9 16 and 25 well how do

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.910 
outputs are 1 4 9 16 and 25 well how do
what<00:02:50.930> am<00:02:51.020> i<00:02:51.110> doing<00:02:51.410> to<00:02:51.530> the<00:02:51.650> X<00:02:51.860> to<00:02:52.610> get<00:02:52.790> to<00:02:52.970> the<00:02:53.060> y

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
what am i doing to the X to get to the y

00:02:53.920 --> 00:03:00.400 
what am i doing to the X to get to the y
what<00:02:54.920> is<00:02:55.160> the<00:02:55.310> function<00:02:57.310> well<00:02:58.330> see<00:02:59.330> it<00:02:59.660> looks

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
what is the function well see it looks

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:02.860 
what is the function well see it looks
like<00:03:01.690> hmm

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
like hmm

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.810 
like hmm
looks<00:03:03.260> like<00:03:03.440> I'm<00:03:03.650> squaring<00:03:04.310> X<00:03:04.840> and<00:03:06.490> that<00:03:07.490> gets

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:07.820 
looks like I'm squaring X and that gets

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:11.200 
looks like I'm squaring X and that gets
me<00:03:08.030> my<00:03:08.420> Y<00:03:08.630> so<00:03:09.590> whatever<00:03:09.890> input<00:03:10.190> I<00:03:10.580> put<00:03:10.850> in<00:03:11.030> I

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:11.210 
me my Y so whatever input I put in I

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:14.500 
me my Y so whatever input I put in I
square<00:03:11.810> it<00:03:11.930> and<00:03:12.110> out<00:03:12.320> comes<00:03:12.680> my<00:03:12.920> Y<00:03:13.300> and<00:03:14.300> we

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
square it and out comes my Y and we

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.220 
square it and out comes my Y and we
could<00:03:14.660> test<00:03:14.900> this<00:03:15.140> out<00:03:15.350> what's<00:03:16.160> 4<00:03:16.550> squared<00:03:17.060> 16

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
could test this out what's 4 squared 16

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:23.430 
could test this out what's 4 squared 16
5<00:03:18.530> squared<00:03:19.040> 25<00:03:19.510> so<00:03:20.510> 6<00:03:20.840> squared<00:03:21.200> would<00:03:21.410> be<00:03:21.970> 36

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
5 squared 25 so 6 squared would be 36

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:27.400 
5 squared 25 so 6 squared would be 36
again<00:03:24.730> we<00:03:25.730> started<00:03:26.240> with<00:03:26.420> an<00:03:26.570> input/output

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
again we started with an input/output

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:29.950 
again we started with an input/output
chart<00:03:27.770> and<00:03:28.010> we<00:03:28.820> looked<00:03:29.120> at<00:03:29.270> the<00:03:29.360> relationship

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:29.960 
chart and we looked at the relationship

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:31.750 
chart and we looked at the relationship
between<00:03:29.990> the<00:03:30.350> X<00:03:30.530> and<00:03:30.740> the<00:03:30.800> y<00:03:30.950> and<00:03:31.310> we<00:03:31.490> came<00:03:31.730> up

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
between the X and the y and we came up

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.490 
between the X and the y and we came up
with<00:03:32.030> the<00:03:32.180> function<00:03:32.690> of<00:03:32.890> y<00:03:33.890> equals<00:03:34.370> x<00:03:34.550> squared

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
with the function of y equals x squared

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.550 
with the function of y equals x squared
now<00:03:36.560> input/output<00:03:37.430> charts<00:03:37.850> can<00:03:38.630> be<00:03:38.780> used<00:03:39.140> on<00:03:39.470> a

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
now input/output charts can be used on a

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.790 
now input/output charts can be used on a
very<00:03:40.040> basic<00:03:40.250> level<00:03:40.720> to<00:03:41.720> more<00:03:42.020> intermediate

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:42.800 
very basic level to more intermediate

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.199 
very basic level to more intermediate
and<00:03:42.980> advanced<00:03:43.490> levels

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:44.209 
and advanced levels

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:46.960 
and advanced levels
all<00:03:44.600> right<00:03:44.840> so<00:03:45.140> never<00:03:45.920> underestimate<00:03:46.010> you

like<00:04:11.750> you<00:04:11.989> could<00:04:12.170> you<00:04:12.590> could<00:04:12.770> start<00:04:13.010> with<00:04:13.100> a

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.190 
like you could you could start with a

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:14.740 
like you could you could start with a
function<00:04:13.489> and<00:04:13.880> you<00:04:14.270> could<00:04:14.450> create<00:04:14.600> the

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750 
function and you could create the

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:17.289 
function and you could create the
input/output<00:04:15.350> chart<00:04:15.620> it<00:04:15.860> goes<00:04:16.130> both<00:04:16.430> ways<00:04:16.489> all

input/output chart it goes both ways all
right<00:04:17.480> you<00:04:18.140> can<00:04:18.290> use<00:04:18.470> the<00:04:18.709> input/output<00:04:19.700> chart

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:19.940 
right you can use the input/output chart

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:21.670 
right you can use the input/output chart
to<00:04:20.060> create<00:04:20.270> the<00:04:20.330> function<00:04:20.750> or<00:04:20.900> you<00:04:20.959> can<00:04:21.530> use

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:21.680 
to create the function or you can use

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.260 
to create the function or you can use
the<00:04:21.859> function<00:04:22.070> to<00:04:22.370> create<00:04:22.580> the<00:04:22.640> input/output
