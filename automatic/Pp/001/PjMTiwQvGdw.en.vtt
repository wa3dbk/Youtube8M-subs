00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:05.970
 diabetes is a condition in which 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.219
 the pancreas does not produce enough 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.160
 insulin to process sugar from the 

00:00:08.219 --> 00:00:14.039
 diet leaving the excess glucose in the 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.560
 blood although the main problem for 

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:19.199
 Diabetics is to prevent their glucose 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.300
 in the blood rise too much to administer 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.609
 an excess of insulin causes a 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.980
 dangerous decrease in sugar in the 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.919
 blood leading to a condition 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.900
 known as insulin shock controls 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:33.899
 the blood sugar regularly 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.329
 before and after each meal before 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:39.149
 lie down at night and right after 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.309
 wake up make sure that the glucose in 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.680
 blood does not fall below the 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.559
 security levels in order to avoid a 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:49.079
 diabetic shock looks for signs of 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.359
 warning of hypoglycemia if you suspect 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:54.059
 that the individual has received too much 

00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:57.359
 Cold skin headache insulin and 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:59.960
 wet gasping dizziness convulsions or 

00:00:57.359 --> 00:01:01.859
 loss of knowledge determines 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.400
 immediately the blood sugar 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:07.890
 using a blood sugar monitor 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:10.340
 evaluate the situation as fast as it is 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.930
 to provide convenient help 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:15.390
 provides a source of sugar so 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:20.100
 soon as possible if the person 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:22.170
 is conscious 6 ounces or 177 milliliters 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.720
 of juice or a soft fruit like 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.700
 banana is acceptable as well as 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.800
 glucose pills designed 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.590
 specifically for emergencies 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:34.110
 diabetics do not try to give a person 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:37.530
 unconscious nothing orally since 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.869
 this can cause suffocation using a needle 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:43.020
 and a syringe to give an injection of 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:45.210
 emergency glucose checks the dose 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.580
 comparing with the recommendations of 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.950
 health professional to ensure the 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:52.350
 adequate dose and avoid giving too much 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.800
 glucose that can induce hyperglycemia 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:58.560
 excess glucose wash your hands well 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:01.009
 with antibacterial soap prepares the 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.570
 syringe by inserting the needle into the vial 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:06.050
 investing both and filling the syringe 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.940
 slowly for the correct dosage 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:10.950
 gently tap the syringe with the 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.380
 needle pointing up to 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.580
 release the trapped bubbles pushes 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.450
 carefully 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.450
 to release them
