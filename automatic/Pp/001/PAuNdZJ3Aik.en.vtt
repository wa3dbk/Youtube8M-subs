00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
E and the B string ring out open so it's

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:07.180 
E and the B string ring out open so it's
like<00:01:54.420> this

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.190 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:12.460 

and<00:02:08.190> in<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:08.550> end<00:02:09.379> I'm<00:02:10.379> playing<00:02:10.860> this<00:02:11.069> chord

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
and in the end I'm playing this chord

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.180 
and in the end I'm playing this chord
which<00:02:13.470> is<00:02:13.500> a<00:02:14.160> flat<00:02:14.640> 9<00:02:14.940> chord<00:02:15.709> but<00:02:16.709> instead<00:02:17.129> of

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
which is a flat 9 chord but instead of

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:28.869 
which is a flat 9 chord but instead of
the<00:02:17.430> 3rd<00:02:23.360> so<00:02:24.360> the<00:02:24.540> chord<00:02:24.840> is<00:02:25.080> like<00:02:25.950> this

00:02:28.869 --> 00:02:28.879 

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:34.040 

it<00:02:29.879> starts<00:02:30.870> on<00:02:31.709> the<00:02:32.480> sixth<00:02:33.480> fret<00:02:33.690> of<00:02:33.900> the<00:02:33.930> a

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
it starts on the sixth fret of the a

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
g 6 on the beat and then he goes into

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:54.729 
g 6 on the beat and then he goes into
the<00:02:50.190> first<00:02:50.430> verse<00:02:50.970> which<00:02:51.299> is<00:02:53.180> just<00:02:54.180> staying

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:54.739 
the first verse which is just staying

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:59.240 
the first verse which is just staying
vamping<00:02:55.739> on<00:02:55.980> that<00:02:56.610> chord<00:02:57.000> the<00:02:57.209> C<00:02:57.239> sharp<00:02:58.250> 7

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
vamping on that chord the C sharp 7

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.780 
vamping on that chord the C sharp 7
sharp<00:02:59.700> light<00:03:00.500> but<00:03:01.500> playing<00:03:01.769> sort<00:03:02.190> of<00:03:02.250> funky

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
sharp light but playing sort of funky

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.309 
sharp light but playing sort of funky
rhythm<00:03:03.180> over<00:03:04.170> it<00:03:04.230> and<00:03:04.470> singing<00:03:05.459> also<00:03:05.700> so<00:03:06.660> it's

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319 
rhythm over it and singing also so it's

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:27.040 
rhythm over it and singing also so it's
something<00:03:07.590> like<00:03:07.709> this

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.050 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:32.360 

so<00:03:28.050> that's<00:03:28.410> it<00:03:28.620> just<00:03:30.590> listen<00:03:31.590> carefully<00:03:31.769> to

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
so that's it just listen carefully to

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:37.040 
so that's it just listen carefully to
the<00:03:32.900> to<00:03:33.900> the<00:03:34.050> original<00:03:34.530> track<00:03:35.720> for<00:03:36.720> the<00:03:36.840> rhythm

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:37.050 
the to the original track for the rhythm

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:41.570 
the to the original track for the rhythm
and<00:03:37.640> that's<00:03:38.640> it<00:03:38.849> there's<00:03:39.120> nothing<00:03:39.690> fancy<00:03:40.580> then

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580 
and that's it there's nothing fancy then

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:53.760 
and that's it there's nothing fancy then
he<00:03:41.730> goes<00:03:41.910> into<00:03:42.120> the<00:03:42.410> first<00:03:44.330> course

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:53.770 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:58.070 

and<00:03:54.370> so<00:03:54.610> on<00:03:55.830> then<00:03:56.830> he<00:03:56.980> comes<00:03:57.190> back<00:03:57.310> to<00:03:57.640> the

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:58.080 
and so on then he comes back to the

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:05.610 
and so on then he comes back to the
intro<00:04:01.350> which<00:04:02.350> is<00:04:02.530> played<00:04:02.860> again<00:04:03.370> around<00:04:04.440> the<00:04:05.440> C

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:05.620 
intro which is played again around the C

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.160 
intro which is played again around the C
sharp<00:04:05.830> seven<00:04:06.250> sharp<00:04:06.490> nine<00:04:06.730> chord<00:04:07.120> but<00:04:07.810> he

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.170 
sharp seven sharp nine chord but he

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:57.580 
sharp seven sharp nine chord but he
takes<00:04:08.410> it<00:04:08.620> up

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:57.590 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:01.010 

so<00:04:58.590> I'm<00:04:59.100> not<00:04:59.490> playing<00:04:59.789> exactly<00:05:00.419> what<00:05:00.720> he's

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020 
so I'm not playing exactly what he's

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:04.999 
so I'm not playing exactly what he's
playing<00:05:01.470> but<00:05:01.830> uh<00:05:03.350> you<00:05:04.350> know<00:05:04.500> you<00:05:04.530> get<00:05:04.830> the

00:05:04.999 --> 00:05:05.009 
playing but uh you know you get the

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:12.070 
playing but uh you know you get the
ideas<00:05:05.400> around<00:05:05.880> this<00:05:06.830> around<00:05:07.830> this<00:05:08.070> chords<00:05:08.850> and

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.080 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:18.999 

basically<00:05:13.080> what<00:05:13.289> he<00:05:13.410> plays<00:05:13.740> is<00:05:14.870> this<00:05:15.870> court

00:05:18.999 --> 00:05:19.009 

00:05:19.009 --> 00:05:22.610 

which<00:05:20.009> is<00:05:20.190> C<00:05:20.490> sharp<00:05:21.410> yeah

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:22.620 
which is C sharp yeah

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:56.080 
which is C sharp yeah
C<00:05:22.800> sharp<00:05:22.830> seven

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:56.090

sharp<00:05:57.090> first<00:05:58.020> inversion<00:05:59.240> which<00:06:00.240> means

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:33.370 

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:36.820 

and<00:06:34.750> basically<00:06:35.750> this<00:06:35.960> is<00:06:36.020> the<00:06:36.289> intro<00:06:36.590> and<00:06:36.710> then
