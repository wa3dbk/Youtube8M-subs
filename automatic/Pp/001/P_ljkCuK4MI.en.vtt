00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.150
 hello hdblog.it we are at the stand with after 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.649
 having presented this morning at 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.980
 press conference which was the first one 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:11.550
 the wide world congress 2015 by 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.380
 barcelona 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.480
 the agenda this morning presented a 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.740
 lot of technologies to have 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.420
 we'll see in the products to come 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.050
 presented during the year was also 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.220
 the top announcement of the new snapdragon 820 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.630
 even if at the time it was treated 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.550
 just to show a slide of 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.199
 talk about a new architecture of di 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.849
 cortex of processors based on cortex 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.040
 that we'll see over time you've been there 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.700
 however, a way to talk about new ones 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.670
 snapdragon class 400 class 600 and state 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.290
 way of introducing new technologies 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.300
 including those one more package 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.680
 important issues concerning the 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.870
 scanning of digital products such as 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.329
 new technology qualcomm and the 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.500
 network connectivity and streaming 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.420
 also in 4k 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.090
 all things that are now exposed in 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.100
 this huge stand by war conversano 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.960
 hundreds of meters that something with 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.810
 lots of small islands as you see 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:04.360
 where each of these exhibits and demonstrates 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:05.979
 one of these different technologies 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.070
 let's start making you do this very fast 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:11.650
 tour here on my left 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:14.800
 you see all were a boy gigi cells 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:19.450
 watch the south sen phone are cameras 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:21.640
 there is timex sport watch so too 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.600
 glasses for augmented reality 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.600
 augmented reality that one of the arguments 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.860
 of these technologies that are 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.910
 implemented in will be presented 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.649
 in the next snapdragon and alone 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:32.080
 especially implemented also in the new 

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:32.770
 810 that the tip processor does 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.540
 a demonstration 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:37.509
 the one I mentioned before 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:43.229
 demonstration of poetry without and of 3d 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:43.229
 that unlike what a 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:50.120
 what you can do with the 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:52.640
 technology 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:56.000
 rival technology that is capacitive 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:58.550
 almost a 3D technology 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.110
 with an ultrasonic sensor that they avoid 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:02.780
 also the different layers of the pastel 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:04.580
 therefore a more advanced technology more 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:08.780
 more accurate accurate than will come 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:10.100
 implemented by 810 on here again if 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.660
 continued we have the cognitive 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:13.910
 technology that is part of a package 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.130
 of augmented reality that qualcomm has 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:19.460
 presented this morning with the name of 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:21.980
 zero technology of a piece of software 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:23.030
 which allows you to integrate better than 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.960
 make better use of those that are 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:29.330
 functional characteristics of the there 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:32.600
 this half roth integrates a series 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:34.280
 of libraries stk if all na a lot of things 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:37.280
 which mainly concerns one 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.740
 augmented reality but I told myself there are 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.540
 many many others are passed in 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:44.180
 this area is all the gaming part 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:47.270
 with new gpu adreno we talk a little here 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:50.750
 of processors to over 210 even stuff one 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:53.120
 the eighth sky is 805 older 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.640
 with train 420 graphics and this is the 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.860
 raser TV forces that we find it for 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.470
 depth of a dedicated video is one 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:04.700
 mini pc an android console with android 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:05.959
 tv 31 105 watch plays in 1080p 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:09.590
 I believe but it should arrive anyway 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:11.360
 also 4k with 4g integrated controller 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.040
 bluetooth combined in short a 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.989
 device that we have deepened that 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.390
 we invite you to read May of 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:19.489
 there is information on my left 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:21.680
 a series of devices with a series of 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:23.720
 smartphone but not only tablet also 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.640
 one point also the strong TV also the 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:29.090
 room you see there is a lot of stuff and then 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:32.030
 you go to the network area with the 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:33.590
 demonstrations here on the right there is lte o 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:37.030
 and to the left is the first demonstration 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:40.959
 in the world of latto catto 11 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:44.410
 these 22 monitors here show all of them 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:49.980
 11 also passes from the difference between l 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:52.530
 classic and wifi snapdragon x12 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:55.260
 10x 8 modem points that they saw integrated 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:57.200
 in the next devices still if 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.819
 let's go ahead here there's a demonstration 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.920
 very very useful very funny 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:05.430
 we also saw it this morning 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:08.580
 concerns the roaming of the 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:10.830
 wifi and lte connectivity in practice water 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:12.510
 to a technology that is already active on 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:15.390
 some smartphones because it is also based 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:17.070
 on the other snapdragon processors 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:19.200
 practically allows to pass 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:21.540
 directly automatically 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:23.190
 let's say from lte hsdpa wifi 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:24.870
 when using we take the example 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.760
 that I 'm phoning I 'm on the phone 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:28.920
 he entered the system automatically 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:31.170
 pass the wifi line however it takes advantage of the 

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:33.600
 home line and not the mobile one for 

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:34.830
 save money bandwidth and all for 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.630
 all the rest this technology is already 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:39.540
 but not all the best implemented 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:42.000
 have decided to activate it 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:42.570
 let's say in the current generation if then 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.840
 go on 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:48.290
 right here back there if you see there is a 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:50.520
 license plate is a maserati managed by 

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:53.420
 processors from qualcomm processors 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:55.250
 if we then return to the part 

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:56.420
 let's say the area behind it does not begin 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:58.940
 we show it but it concerns 

00:04:56.420 --> 00:05:00.149
 especially the networks are demonstrations 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:03.449
 of 

00:05:00.149 --> 00:05:07.149
 technologies that then need to be seen more than 

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:10.439
 commented and discussed here behind is one 

00:05:07.149 --> 00:05:13.989
 demonstration of 4k streaming again 

00:05:10.439 --> 00:05:15.039
 always relative to snapdragon 810 

00:05:13.989 --> 00:05:18.179
 especially because the professor who 

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:20.199
 the company is aiming for 4k streaming 

00:05:18.179 --> 00:05:22.029
 differences between the exquisite living 

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:24.039
 we are qualcomm's reference design 

00:05:22.029 --> 00:05:26.050
 this is cable connectivity 

00:05:24.039 --> 00:05:29.739
 via wired via HDMI 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:30.939
 there is one of the 265 h movies even if in the 

00:05:29.739 --> 00:05:34.330
 Demonstrations of 

00:05:30.939 --> 00:05:36.550
 quality between h 264 h 263 professor 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:39.189
 obviously he manages it in a way 

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:42.639
 very much so, but that's not all 

00:05:39.189 --> 00:05:45.639
 because this morning in a room that 

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:47.919
 we were allowed to log in with the 

00:05:45.639 --> 00:05:49.780
 let's say with the video camera we saw 

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:52.719
 assisted a streaming demonstration 

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:54.759
 4k with the tina media streamer key that 

00:05:52.719 --> 00:05:56.740
 I say we talked often on the site 

00:05:54.759 --> 00:05:58.719
 lately it is the one that has been victorious 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:00.249
 red which is not a product intended 

00:05:58.719 --> 00:06:01.810
 to the sale because they told us 

00:06:00.249 --> 00:06:02.889
 so much so that someone indeed uses it 

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:06.669
 internally 

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:07.810
 because of these demonstrations here in 

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:10.770
 actually we saw it exposed on 

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:13.029
 giant monitor and fluency was not 

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:16.659
 exceptional or better it was a 4k with 

00:06:13.029 --> 00:06:18.939
 display with dolby audio and therefore in short 

00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:20.800
 but you could see some loses 

00:06:18.939 --> 00:06:22.750
 loss of difference but it was a 

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:24.219
 I repeat a technology that for a true 

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:26.469
 never put on the market at least 

00:06:24.219 --> 00:06:28.300
 currently well all for now 

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:30.129
 from the stand at the qualcomm stand 

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:31.719
 keep following us because we have others 

00:06:30.129 --> 00:06:33.099
 videos about technologies 

00:06:31.719 --> 00:06:35.080
 beyond in the mobile sector but also 

00:06:33.099 --> 00:06:36.550
 gadget many things concerning networks 

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:38.409
 which are one of the main themes 

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:40.120
 of this word congress file 

00:06:38.409 --> 00:06:44.189
