which<00:01:51.729> means<00:01:51.969> I<00:01:52.090> can't<00:01:52.270> actually<00:01:52.420> take<00:01:52.689> the

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
which means I can't actually take the

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.539 
which means I can't actually take the
lens<00:01:53.020> and<00:01:53.799> just<00:01:54.009> comes<00:01:54.189> right<00:01:54.249> out<00:01:54.369> the<00:01:54.520> front

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:54.549 
lens and just comes right out the front

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:56.910 
lens and just comes right out the front
so<00:01:55.240> any<00:01:55.389> time<00:01:55.630> you<00:01:55.869> might<00:01:56.049> possibly<00:01:56.259> drop<00:01:56.679> them

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
so any time you might possibly drop them

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.219 
so any time you might possibly drop them
scratch<00:01:57.189> them<00:01:57.539> just<00:01:58.539> not<00:01:58.779> know<00:01:58.929> what<00:01:59.079> might

00:01:59.219 --> 00:01:59.229 
scratch them just not know what might

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:00.779 
scratch them just not know what might
happen<00:01:59.350> is<00:01:59.560> very<00:01:59.590> very<00:01:59.920> easy<00:02:00.069> to<00:02:00.189> you<00:02:00.670> know<00:02:00.729> I

00:02:00.779 --> 00:02:00.789 
happen is very very easy to you know I

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:02.429 
happen is very very easy to you know I
get<00:02:00.999> replacement<00:02:01.450> lenses<00:02:01.689> and<00:02:01.810> they<00:02:01.869> just

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:02.439 
get replacement lenses and they just

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:03.779 
get replacement lenses and they just
load<00:02:02.679> right<00:02:02.859> on<00:02:02.950> the<00:02:03.009> front<00:02:03.249> and<00:02:03.459> it's<00:02:03.670> just

00:02:03.779 --> 00:02:03.789 
load right on the front and it's just

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:05.099 
load right on the front and it's just
that<00:02:04.119> much<00:02:04.270> easier<00:02:04.539> just<00:02:04.659> to<00:02:04.749> go<00:02:04.840> ahead<00:02:04.959> and

that much easier just to go ahead and

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:07.609 
that much easier just to go ahead and
put<00:02:05.200> the<00:02:05.289> lens<00:02:05.639> right<00:02:06.639> back<00:02:06.880> in<00:02:07.060> the<00:02:07.149> glass<00:02:07.359> to

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
put the lens right back in the glass to

of<00:02:20.390> our<00:02:20.630> performance<00:02:21.320> polarized<00:02:21.770> technology

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
of our performance polarized technology

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.860 
of our performance polarized technology
now<00:02:22.640> one<00:02:22.910> of<00:02:23.000> the<00:02:23.060> differences<00:02:23.420> with<00:02:23.600> our

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
now one of the differences with our

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.080 
now one of the differences with our
polarized<00:02:24.200> glasses<00:02:24.590> is<00:02:25.040> that<00:02:25.070> instead<00:02:26.000> of

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
polarized glasses is that instead of

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:27.520 
polarized glasses is that instead of
using<00:02:26.270> an<00:02:26.480> actual<00:02:26.600> polarized<00:02:27.110> filter<00:02:27.440> that's

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
using an actual polarized filter that's

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:28.840 
using an actual polarized filter that's
being<00:02:27.680> applied<00:02:27.860> to<00:02:27.980> the<00:02:28.160> lens<00:02:28.340> in<00:02:28.460> a<00:02:28.520> laminate

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:28.850 
being applied to the lens in a laminate

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:30.550 
being applied to the lens in a laminate
skin<00:02:29.210> on<00:02:29.360> the<00:02:29.450> inside<00:02:29.480> or<00:02:29.900> outside<00:02:29.930> the<00:02:30.290> lens

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
skin on the inside or outside the lens

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.080 
skin on the inside or outside the lens
it's<00:02:31.070> impregnated<00:02:31.610> in<00:02:31.700> the<00:02:31.760> middle<00:02:31.940> of<00:02:32.030> the

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
it's impregnated in the middle of the

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.180 
it's impregnated in the middle of the
skin<00:02:32.330> so<00:02:32.570> what's<00:02:32.780> that<00:02:32.960> what<00:02:33.350> that's<00:02:33.470> doing<00:02:33.830> is

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190 
skin so what's that what that's doing is

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.210 
skin so what's that what that's doing is
its<00:02:34.790> alleviating<00:02:35.450> any<00:02:36.170> opportunity<00:02:36.800> for<00:02:37.040> that

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
its alleviating any opportunity for that

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.580 
its alleviating any opportunity for that
polarized<00:02:37.670> lens<00:02:38.540> to<00:02:38.720> get<00:02:38.810> scratched<00:02:39.200> or<00:02:39.410> to

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
polarized lens to get scratched or to

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.380 
polarized lens to get scratched or to
delaminate<00:02:40.040> now<00:02:40.460> since<00:02:40.700> there<00:02:40.910> is<00:02:41.120> no<00:02:41.470> actual

delaminate now since there is no actual

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.780 
delaminate now since there is no actual
vinyl<00:02:44.390> application<00:02:44.870> for<00:02:45.530> that<00:02:45.650> filter<00:02:45.950> we've

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
vinyl application for that filter we've

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:47.980 
vinyl application for that filter we've
treated<00:02:47.030> the<00:02:47.210> lens<00:02:47.390> with<00:02:47.540> an<00:02:47.630> oleophobic

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:47.990 
treated the lens with an oleophobic

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:50.100 
treated the lens with an oleophobic
coating<00:02:48.230> and<00:02:48.860> what<00:02:49.220> that<00:02:49.400> does<00:02:49.610> is<00:02:49.730> kind<00:02:49.910> of

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
coating and what that does is kind of

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:53.260 
coating and what that does is kind of
repel<00:02:51.110> dirt<00:02:51.320> and<00:02:51.500> oil<00:02:51.700> so<00:02:52.700> as<00:02:52.940> you<00:02:53.090> can<00:02:53.209> see

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:53.270 
repel dirt and oil so as you can see

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:55.240 
repel dirt and oil so as you can see
here<00:02:53.570> I<00:02:53.600> can<00:02:53.690> take<00:02:54.080> my<00:02:54.230> fingerprints<00:02:54.890> and<00:02:55.160> get

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
here I can take my fingerprints and get

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.100 
here I can take my fingerprints and get
them<00:02:55.370> all<00:02:55.490> over<00:02:55.640> the<00:02:55.730> lens<00:02:55.940> and<00:02:56.390> since<00:02:56.959> its

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
them all over the lens and since its

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:58.510 
them all over the lens and since its
repelling<00:02:57.410> with<00:02:57.590> my<00:02:57.680> fingerprints<00:02:58.190> it's<00:02:58.340> very

00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:58.520 
repelling with my fingerprints it's very

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.000 
repelling with my fingerprints it's very
very<00:02:58.730> easy<00:02:58.850> to<00:02:59.060> clean<00:02:59.180> off<00:02:59.420> real<00:02:59.870> easily<00:03:00.110> just

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
very easy to clean off real easily just

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:02.290 
very easy to clean off real easily just
with<00:03:01.100> my<00:03:01.220> basic<00:03:01.430> t-shirt<00:03:01.880> not<00:03:02.030> putting<00:03:02.240> a<00:03:02.270> lot

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:02.300 
with my basic t-shirt not putting a lot

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:03.490 
with my basic t-shirt not putting a lot
of<00:03:02.390> pressure<00:03:02.660> on<00:03:02.780> the<00:03:02.900> lens<00:03:03.050> and<00:03:03.170> what<00:03:03.320> that

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
of pressure on the lens and what that

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.140 
of pressure on the lens and what that
does<00:03:03.709> is<00:03:03.860> it<00:03:03.950> alleviates<00:03:04.459> the<00:03:04.610> fact<00:03:04.850> I'm<00:03:05.060> gonna

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
does is it alleviates the fact I'm gonna

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:06.760 
does is it alleviates the fact I'm gonna
put<00:03:05.330> microscopic<00:03:05.990> scratches<00:03:06.230> trying<00:03:06.709> to

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:06.770 
put microscopic scratches trying to

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:09.400 
put microscopic scratches trying to
grind<00:03:07.070> out<00:03:07.370> that<00:03:08.360> oil<00:03:08.540> my<00:03:08.810> fingerprints<00:03:09.350> from

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
grind out that oil my fingerprints from

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.170 
grind out that oil my fingerprints from
being<00:03:09.650> absorbed<00:03:09.860> in<00:03:10.070> the<00:03:10.160> lens<00:03:10.370> the<00:03:11.060> other

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
being absorbed in the lens the other

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
being absorbed in the lens the other
really<00:03:11.390> nice<00:03:11.510> features<00:03:11.930> we<00:03:12.050> put<00:03:12.080> a

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
really nice features we put a

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.199 
really nice features we put a
hydrophobic<00:03:12.709> coating<00:03:13.010> so<00:03:13.760> if<00:03:13.850> I<00:03:13.910> take<00:03:14.060> this

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209 
hydrophobic coating so if I take this

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:16.060 
hydrophobic coating so if I take this
water<00:03:14.450> and<00:03:14.900> I<00:03:15.140> put<00:03:15.170> on<00:03:15.410> the<00:03:15.500> lens<00:03:15.680> like<00:03:15.800> that

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:16.070 
water and I put on the lens like that

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:17.830 
water and I put on the lens like that
it's<00:03:16.430> not<00:03:16.610> going<00:03:16.670> on<00:03:16.940> a<00:03:16.970> streak<00:03:17.360> it's<00:03:17.570> actually

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
it's not going on a streak it's actually

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.600 
it's not going on a streak it's actually
don't<00:03:17.959> want<00:03:18.050> a<00:03:18.140> bead<00:03:18.410> and<00:03:19.100> that's<00:03:19.280> also<00:03:19.430> going

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:19.610 
don't want a bead and that's also going

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:20.890 
don't want a bead and that's also going
to<00:03:19.670> make<00:03:19.790> it<00:03:19.910> very<00:03:19.940> very<00:03:20.150> easy<00:03:20.360> to<00:03:20.510> wipe<00:03:20.690> off

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
to make it very very easy to wipe off

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.060 
to make it very very easy to wipe off
and<00:03:21.260> not<00:03:21.350> have<00:03:21.500> any<00:03:22.450> water<00:03:23.450> streaks<00:03:23.980> maybe<00:03:24.980> you

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:25.070 
and not have any water streaks maybe you

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:31.960 
and not have any water streaks maybe you

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:33.890 
try some long-haired this is odd this is

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:36.430 
try some long-haired this is odd this is

on these on senses performance polarizer

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:45.220 
on these on senses performance polarizer
forms<00:03:44.660> polarized

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230 
forms polarized

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:47.140 
forms polarized
okay<00:03:45.470> so<00:03:45.530> there's<00:03:45.850> polarized<00:03:46.850> and

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 
okay so there's polarized and

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.000 
okay so there's polarized and
performance<00:03:47.660> polarize<00:03:48.019> no<00:03:48.200> we<00:03:48.440> actually<00:03:48.830> just

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
performance polarize no we actually just

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:50.530 
performance polarize no we actually just
coined<00:03:49.340> it<00:03:49.459> as<00:03:49.549> performance<00:03:50.180> polarized

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
coined it as performance polarized

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.550 
coined it as performance polarized
lenses<00:03:50.840> because<00:03:51.049> there's<00:03:51.440> only<00:03:52.100> a<00:03:52.220> few

polarized<00:04:02.360> lenses<00:04:02.630> out<00:04:02.780> there<00:04:02.959> still<00:04:03.140> gonna

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290 
polarized lenses out there still gonna

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:05.590 
polarized lenses out there still gonna
have<00:04:03.500> that<00:04:03.530> that<00:04:04.489> vinyl<00:04:04.790> application<00:04:05.390> for<00:04:05.570> a

here so you can see in those nice so

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:11.890 
here so you can see in those nice so
we've<00:04:10.730> actually<00:04:10.880> cleanse<00:04:11.209> performance<00:04:11.750> polar

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900 
we've actually cleanse performance polar

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:13.030 
we've actually cleanse performance polar
because<00:04:12.140> there's<00:04:12.290> very<00:04:12.320> few<00:04:12.650> manufacturers

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
because there's very few manufacturers

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:14.530 
because there's very few manufacturers
out<00:04:13.310> there<00:04:13.459> can<00:04:13.610> actually<00:04:13.850> offer<00:04:14.000> that<00:04:14.269> level

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:14.540 
out there can actually offer that level

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:20.159 
out there can actually offer that level
of<00:04:14.600> polarized<00:04:15.019> glass<00:04:15.230> okay<00:04:15.950> so<00:04:16.370> cool<00:04:18.100> those

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:20.169 
of polarized glass okay so cool those

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:23.100 
of polarized glass okay so cool those
that's<00:04:21.159> right<00:04:21.280> here's<00:04:21.459> the<00:04:21.519> Calaca<00:04:22.110> medium

their<00:04:38.020> glasses<00:04:38.199> do<00:04:38.919> they<00:04:39.039> have<00:04:39.189> like<00:04:39.400> medium

00:04:39.959 --> 00:04:39.969 
their glasses do they have like medium

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:41.820 
their glasses do they have like medium
and<00:04:40.330> large<00:04:40.539> frames<00:04:40.960> or<00:04:41.259> how<00:04:41.349> many<00:04:41.409> different

I'm<00:04:49.120> where<00:04:49.270> the<00:04:49.360> demos<00:04:49.689> right<00:04:49.870> now<00:04:50.050> this<00:04:50.289> would

00:04:50.399 --> 00:04:50.409 
I'm where the demos right now this would

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:52.110 
I'm where the demos right now this would
be<00:04:50.439> a<00:04:50.530> larger<00:04:50.919> fit<00:04:51.099> right<00:04:51.490> and<00:04:51.699> then<00:04:51.819> what<00:04:52.030> you

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:52.120 
be a larger fit right and then what you

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.399 
be a larger fit right and then what you
have<00:04:52.150> right<00:04:52.389> there<00:04:52.419> the<00:04:52.840> Kalakh<00:04:53.139> would<00:04:53.319> be

00:04:53.399 --> 00:04:53.409 
have right there the Kalakh would be

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:55.529 
have right there the Kalakh would be
considered<00:04:53.800> a<00:04:53.849> medium<00:04:54.849> fit<00:04:55.150> medium<00:04:55.389> fit

00:04:55.529 --> 00:04:55.539 
considered a medium fit medium fit

00:04:55.539 --> 00:04:57.510 
considered a medium fit medium fit
absolutely<00:04:55.930> here<00:04:56.590> let's<00:04:56.889> switch<00:04:57.069> real<00:04:57.279> quick

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.520 
absolutely here let's switch real quick

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.730 
absolutely here let's switch real quick
so<00:04:57.669> people<00:04:57.879> can<00:04:58.000> get<00:04:58.090> a<00:04:58.120> good<00:04:58.180> idea<00:04:58.330> of<00:04:58.840> this

00:04:59.730 --> 00:04:59.740 
so people can get a good idea of this

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:06.240 
so people can get a good idea of this
size<00:05:00.009> difference<00:05:03.539> cool<00:05:04.539> definitely<00:05:05.529> larger

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:06.250 
size difference cool definitely larger

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:08.029 
size difference cool definitely larger
