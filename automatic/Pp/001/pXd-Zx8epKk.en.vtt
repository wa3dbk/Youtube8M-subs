right 89 90 91 this overall process
takes<00:04:29.039> a<00:04:29.160> bit<00:04:29.340> between<00:04:29.729> four<00:04:30.060> and<00:04:30.090> six<00:04:30.360> hours

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:30.660 
takes a bit between four and six hours

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.480 
takes a bit between four and six hours
on<00:04:31.229> this<00:04:31.470> one<00:04:31.710> here<00:04:31.919> we're<00:04:32.069> going<00:04:32.159> to<00:04:32.250> need<00:04:32.430> a

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
on this one here we're going to need a

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:34.670 
on this one here we're going to need a
decision<00:04:33.030> by<00:04:33.180> the<00:04:33.259> parliamentarian<00:04:34.259> because

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 
decision by the parliamentarian because

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:38.270 
decision by the parliamentarian because
I<00:04:34.979> think<00:04:35.669> this<00:04:35.789> is<00:04:35.849> an<00:04:36.150> invalid<00:04:37.139> balance<00:04:37.919> this

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 
I think this is an invalid balance this

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.850 
I think this is an invalid balance this
person<00:04:38.759> voted<00:04:39.180> for<00:04:39.210> candidates<00:04:40.020> for<00:04:40.229> director

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
person voted for candidates for director

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:44.300 
person voted for candidates for director
so<00:04:41.069> it's<00:04:41.250> clearly<00:04:41.930> an<00:04:42.930> invalid<00:04:43.470> ballot<00:04:43.860> did

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.310 
so it's clearly an invalid ballot did

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:46.850 
so it's clearly an invalid ballot did
