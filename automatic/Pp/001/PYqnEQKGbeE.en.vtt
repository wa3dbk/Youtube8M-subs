to take old vegetable scraps which I'll

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:41.450 
to take old vegetable scraps which I'll
show<00:00:39.390> here<00:00:39.629> in<00:00:39.780> a<00:00:39.840> second<00:00:40.320> put<00:00:41.160> them<00:00:41.280> in<00:00:41.399> a

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
show here in a second put them in a

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.700 
show here in a second put them in a
Vitamix<00:00:42.030> blend<00:00:42.719> them<00:00:42.870> up<00:00:42.989> with<00:00:43.200> a<00:00:43.230> little<00:00:43.590> bit

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
Vitamix blend them up with a little bit

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.720 
Vitamix blend them up with a little bit
of<00:00:43.739> water<00:00:44.040> throw<00:00:45.030> them<00:00:45.180> on<00:00:45.390> your<00:00:45.690> paths<00:00:46.170> and

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:46.730 
of water throw them on your paths and

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.729 
of water throw them on your paths and
let<00:00:47.730> them<00:00:47.850> sink<00:00:48.180> down<00:00:48.420> in<00:00:48.780> there<00:00:48.989> and<00:00:49.200> stir

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
let them sink down in there and stir

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.880 
let them sink down in there and stir
them<00:00:49.829> up<00:00:50.510> and<00:00:51.510> what<00:00:51.750> happens<00:00:52.170> is<00:00:52.350> you<00:00:52.530> enrich

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
them up and what happens is you enrich

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.799 
them up and what happens is you enrich
the<00:00:53.160> soil<00:00:53.190> immediately<00:00:54.090> and<00:00:54.629> there's

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
the soil immediately and there's

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.200 
the soil immediately and there's
actually<00:00:54.960> microbes<00:00:55.860> that<00:00:56.489> eat<00:00:56.850> all<00:00:57.059> the

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
actually microbes that eat all the

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.830 
actually microbes that eat all the
carbohydrates<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:58.020> proteins<00:00:58.440> in<00:00:58.680> etc<00:00:58.829> and

00:00:59.830 --> 00:00:59.840 
carbohydrates the proteins in etc and

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.740 
carbohydrates the proteins in etc and
they<00:01:00.840> live<00:01:01.079> in<00:01:01.199> the<00:01:01.289> soil<00:01:01.530> and<00:01:01.920> then<00:01:02.760> once<00:01:03.660> that

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
they live in the soil and then once that

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.320 
they live in the soil and then once that
seeps<00:01:04.140> down<00:01:04.229> into<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.680> soil<00:01:04.920> then<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.090> worms

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
seeps down into the soil then the worms

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.710 
seeps down into the soil then the worms
move<00:01:06.689> in<00:01:06.869> boy<00:01:07.290> do<00:01:07.830> they<00:01:08.010> move<00:01:08.520> in<00:01:08.880> because<00:01:09.479> the

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
move in boy do they move in because the

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.080 
move in boy do they move in because the
soil<00:01:10.020> is<00:01:10.290> just<00:01:10.590> really<00:01:11.040> super<00:01:11.220> fertile<00:01:11.640> and

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
soil is just really super fertile and

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.210 
soil is just really super fertile and
not<00:01:12.299> that<00:01:12.450> many<00:01:12.600> people<00:01:12.869> know<00:01:13.170> that<00:01:13.439> worms

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
not that many people know that worms

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.270 
not that many people know that worms
basically<00:01:14.909> have<00:01:15.150> to<00:01:15.330> eat<00:01:15.740> food<00:01:16.740> that's<00:01:16.920> you

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
basically have to eat food that's you

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.640 
basically have to eat food that's you
know<00:01:17.400> basically<00:01:18.330> broken<00:01:18.659> down<00:01:18.810> so<00:01:19.320> you<00:01:19.380> let

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
know basically broken down so you let

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.940 
know basically broken down so you let
the<00:01:19.770> microbes<00:01:20.250> do<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.549> work<00:01:20.729> and<00:01:21.060> then<00:01:21.740> you<00:01:22.740> go

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
the microbes do the work and then you go

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.410 
the microbes do the work and then you go
ahead<00:01:23.070> and<00:01:23.310> let<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.520> worms<00:01:23.700> do<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.060> work<00:01:24.210> and

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
ahead and let the worms do the work and

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.510 
ahead and let the worms do the work and
if<00:01:24.600> you<00:01:24.780> can<00:01:24.990> get<00:01:25.140> worms<00:01:25.320> in<00:01:25.590> your<00:01:25.619> garden<00:01:26.100> let

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
if you can get worms in your garden let

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.850 
if you can get worms in your garden let
me<00:01:26.610> tell<00:01:26.820> you<00:01:27.049> your<00:01:28.049> garden<00:01:28.380> is<00:01:28.470> gonna<00:01:28.710> be

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
me tell you your garden is gonna be

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:29.359

great

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.149 
great
so<00:01:30.299> anyway<00:01:31.290> what<00:01:31.470> I'm<00:01:31.560> doing<00:01:31.860> here<00:01:31.979> is<00:01:32.040> I'm

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
so anyway what I'm doing here is I'm

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.310 
so anyway what I'm doing here is I'm
basically<00:01:32.610> blending<00:01:33.000> up<00:01:33.150> weeks<00:01:33.869> worth<00:01:34.079> of

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
basically blending up weeks worth of

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.319 
basically blending up weeks worth of
kitchen<00:01:34.619> scraps<00:01:35.100> and<00:01:35.640> putting<00:01:36.030> it<00:01:36.150> in<00:01:36.270> a

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
kitchen scraps and putting it in a

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:37.969 
kitchen scraps and putting it in a
pitcher<00:01:36.570> and<00:01:37.049> then<00:01:37.500> I'm<00:01:37.590> going<00:01:37.710> to<00:01:37.770> show<00:01:37.920> you

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
pitcher and then I'm going to show you

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.950 
pitcher and then I'm going to show you
how<00:01:38.220> I<00:01:38.250> put<00:01:38.579> it<00:01:38.640> out<00:01:38.820> in<00:01:39.030> my<00:01:39.180> garden<00:01:39.570> and<00:01:39.720> this

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
is just a really quick way to get

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.330 
is just a really quick way to get
nutrients<00:01:42.420> to<00:01:42.630> your<00:01:42.689> soil<00:01:42.920> without<00:01:43.920> having<00:01:44.250> to

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
nutrients to your soil without having to

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.609 
nutrients to your soil without having to
compost<00:01:44.880> for<00:01:45.119> a<00:01:45.180> long<00:01:45.390> time<00:01:45.659> I<00:01:45.869> talked<00:01:46.320> to<00:01:46.439> the

compost for a long time I talked to the

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.100 
compost for a long time I talked to the
talk<00:01:46.979> about<00:01:47.280> this<00:01:47.490> as<00:01:47.700> being<00:01:48.270> a<00:01:48.360> cult<00:01:48.600> compost

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
talk about this as being a cult compost

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.100 
talk about this as being a cult compost
it's<00:01:49.320> actually<00:01:49.680> a<00:01:49.710> side<00:01:50.009> dressing<00:01:50.520> so<00:01:51.210> anyway

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
it's actually a side dressing so anyway

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.929 
it's actually a side dressing so anyway
