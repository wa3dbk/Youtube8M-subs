your fish aquarium now the tricky part

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.239 
your fish aquarium now the tricky part
is<00:00:35.329> actually<00:00:35.690> getting<00:00:36.050> it<00:00:36.199> out<00:00:36.319> of<00:00:36.350> the<00:00:36.469> frame

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:37.249 
is actually getting it out of the frame

00:00:37.249 --> 00:00:39.189 
is actually getting it out of the frame
I<00:00:37.309> broke<00:00:37.969> probably<00:00:38.420> two<00:00:38.690> or<00:00:38.719> three<00:00:38.809> if<00:00:39.079> I'm

00:00:39.189 --> 00:00:39.199 
I broke probably two or three if I'm

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:41.649 
I broke probably two or three if I'm
just<00:00:39.440> trying<00:00:39.679> to<00:00:39.769> do<00:00:39.979> that<00:00:40.249> but<00:00:41.179> if<00:00:41.300> you<00:00:41.420> look

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:41.659 
just trying to do that but if you look

00:00:41.659 --> 00:00:45.579 
just trying to do that but if you look
up<00:00:41.870> where<00:00:43.359> this<00:00:44.359> metal<00:00:44.749> hook<00:00:44.960> is<00:00:45.139> right<00:00:45.379> here

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:45.589 
up where this metal hook is right here

00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:49.569 
up where this metal hook is right here
the<00:00:45.710> actual<00:00:46.010> hinge<00:00:46.329> locking<00:00:47.329> part<00:00:48.460> there<00:00:49.460> will

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:49.579 
the actual hinge locking part there will

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:53.860 
the actual hinge locking part there will
be<00:00:49.690> if<00:00:50.690> you<00:00:50.809> look<00:00:50.960> closely<00:00:52.030> you<00:00:53.030> can<00:00:53.059> see<00:00:53.449> where

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
be if you look closely you can see where

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.919 
be if you look closely you can see where
it<00:00:54.019> grooves<00:00:54.350> into<00:00:54.679> itself<00:00:55.600> same<00:00:56.600> thing<00:00:56.839> on

00:00:56.919 --> 00:00:56.929 
it grooves into itself same thing on

00:00:56.929 --> 00:00:59.169 
it grooves into itself same thing on
that<00:00:56.959> side<00:00:57.280> all<00:00:58.280> you're<00:00:58.489> gonna<00:00:58.579> have<00:00:58.729> to<00:00:58.819> do<00:00:58.940> is

00:00:59.169 --> 00:00:59.179 
that side all you're gonna have to do is

00:00:59.179 --> 00:01:00.719 
that side all you're gonna have to do is
loosen<00:00:59.420> them<00:00:59.690> up<00:00:59.809> with<00:00:59.989> a<00:01:00.019> screwdriver

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:00.729 
loosen them up with a screwdriver

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.000 
chisel the end of your hammer works fine
and<00:01:08.300> then<00:01:08.420> pretty<00:01:08.630> much<00:01:08.720> banging<00:01:09.260> out<00:01:09.380> but<00:01:09.920> be

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.010 
and then pretty much banging out but be

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:11.740 
and then pretty much banging out but be
careful<00:01:10.400> you<00:01:10.490> don't<00:01:10.640> do<00:01:10.760> what<00:01:10.850> I<00:01:10.940> did<00:01:11.000> and<00:01:11.210> hit

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:11.750 
careful you don't do what I did and hit

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
careful you don't do what I did and hit
the<00:01:11.840> glass<00:01:12.520> these<00:01:13.520> are<00:01:13.670> perfect<00:01:14.060> because<00:01:14.300> I

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:14.770 
the glass these are perfect because I

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.130 
the glass these are perfect because I
have<00:01:15.770> a<00:01:16.040> bunch<00:01:16.370> of<00:01:16.520> them<00:01:16.640> laying<00:01:16.880> around<00:01:17.140> from

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
have a bunch of them laying around from

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:19.360

glass out least that can be a little

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.170 
glass out least that can be a little
tricky<00:01:32.570> take<00:01:33.320> your<00:01:33.500> time<00:01:33.850> don't<00:01:34.850> power

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.180 
tricky take your time don't power

as you just cover those edges up so that

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.850

way to say for yourself well it's nice

way to say for yourself well it's nice
about<00:02:23.099> these<00:02:23.340> is<00:02:24.739> it<00:02:25.739> fits<00:02:26.040> perfectly<00:02:26.459> it<00:02:26.970> is

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
about these is it fits perfectly it is

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:33.970 
about these is it fits perfectly it is
low<00:02:27.480> overhung<00:02:30.950> but<00:02:31.950> this<00:02:32.099> creates<00:02:32.400> a<00:02:32.489> perfect

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
low overhung but this creates a perfect

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.860 
low overhung but this creates a perfect
hood<00:02:34.980> I<00:02:35.280> know<00:02:35.640> it's<00:02:35.849> not<00:02:35.970> the<00:02:36.150> most<00:02:36.329> sightless

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
hood I know it's not the most sightless

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.839 
hood I know it's not the most sightless
thing<00:02:37.200> but<00:02:37.980> eventually<00:02:38.370> hopefully<00:02:38.519> I'll<00:02:38.730> be

00:02:38.839 --> 00:02:38.849 
thing but eventually hopefully I'll be

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:42.050 
thing but eventually hopefully I'll be
looking<00:02:39.120> to<00:02:39.299> cut<00:02:39.629> it<00:02:39.810> once<00:02:40.739> I<00:02:40.920> master<00:02:41.909> that

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
looking to cut it once I master that

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.240 
looking to cut it once I master that
technique<00:02:42.540> so<00:02:43.409> if<00:02:43.500> you<00:02:43.590> know<00:02:43.709> how<00:02:43.829> to<00:02:43.859> cut<00:02:44.220> it

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
technique so if you know how to cut it

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:45.830 
technique so if you know how to cut it
then<00:02:44.579> that's<00:02:44.700> even<00:02:44.909> better<00:02:45.060> because<00:02:45.599> then<00:02:45.750> you

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
then that's even better because then you

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.270 
then that's even better because then you
can<00:02:45.989> cut<00:02:46.170> it<00:02:46.290> to<00:02:46.409> the<00:02:46.500> shape<00:02:46.680> that<00:02:46.889> you<00:02:46.980> need<00:02:47.159> it

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
can cut it to the shape that you need it

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.220 
can cut it to the shape that you need it
to<00:02:47.310> and<00:02:48.090> pretty<00:02:48.420> much<00:02:48.540> you<00:02:48.690> have<00:02:48.720> a<00:02:48.870> bunch<00:02:49.139> of

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
to and pretty much you have a bunch of

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.069 
to and pretty much you have a bunch of
unlimited<00:02:49.530> glass<00:02:49.950> that<00:02:50.220> you<00:02:50.310> really<00:02:50.959> you<00:02:51.959> know

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:52.079 
unlimited glass that you really you know

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:53.690 
unlimited glass that you really you know
you're<00:02:52.560> not<00:02:52.680> losing<00:02:52.859> anything<00:02:53.190> if<00:02:53.370> you<00:02:53.459> break

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
you're not losing anything if you break

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.220 
you're not losing anything if you break
it<00:02:53.970> well<00:02:54.420> you've<00:02:54.540> said<00:02:54.690> a<00:02:54.750> lot<00:02:54.780> of<00:02:54.900> times<00:02:55.109> you

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
it well you've said a lot of times you

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:56.690
