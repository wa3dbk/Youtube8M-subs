 He can deal with it really 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.689
 heartfelt film some 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.890
 moments of weakening but also has 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.450
 especially for those who like to link movies 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.740
 other good at my sister's life 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.540

 the comments that means or I have to 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.150
 My grandmother explains briefly 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.020
 example, also two years ago 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.549
 cancer died 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.600
 and I have to think about her very often 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.220
 because I still love her very much 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.229
 love and always remember what you think about me 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.790
 so in life has taught or others 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.390
 it was with me, for example, that she 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.430
 me 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.960
 tying shoes and teaching 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.340
 I would be interested in 1 comment 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.110
 Robert's name is my grandma has me 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.119
 taught how to do that and that 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.380
 So how, then writes its aroma 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.260
 has taught you if you have it 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.369
 remember and this comment this 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.140
 direction takes part in a raffle 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.610
 for song for marion signs the 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.979
 just cling behind it for blu ray 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.890
 or dvd want to have at this point 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:09.690
 and then he takes part in it 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.850
 next, I have seven copies 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.459
 and then more precisely four times 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:16.290
 dvd and three times blu ray of cocaine 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:18.300
 cowboys three documentations cocaine 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.580
 Cowboys 1 and 2 I found pretty cool 3 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.440
 is a completely different csd is currently 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.450
 case like a game on the 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.500
 Street with drugs selling money 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.450
 but at the end of course, it deserves to be earned 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.130
 the bow that's not so right 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.050
 is erotic but definitely told 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:33.150
 made interesting with, among others 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.920
 eminem 50 cents woody harrelson 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.690
 many familiar faces and before 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.130
 very many insiders and at the end 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.410
 somehow also the bow suggests to 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.390
 question or statement that you are a drug 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.459
 should decriminalize in by 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.900
 they are all legalized and that's why 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:47.790
 my question to you or your comments 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.489
 you have to write in every direction 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.410
 obmann drug consumption generally not 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:53.880
 legalize that is to say allow 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.440
 should we have in germany too 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.810
 oblique times with a crane Stammtisch 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.860
 tv with david and marie and me of course 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.420
 that would be the format i know said 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.320
 daily discussed any comments 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.329
 this direction whether drugs 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.170
 should be decriminalized and 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:06.570
 though all 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.920
 the advantage for cocaine cowboys ready 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:09.870
 do not forget to cling to blu ray or 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:13.230
 dvd to write behind it next 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.850
 I have the film title praised the three 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.950
 blu-rays the story of a boy 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:18.959
 girl that has no perspective 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.150
 But 13 is a lot for that 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:22.200
 sex may be in at the moment 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.820
 this physical closeness still 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.350
 feeling safe and secure 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:27.750
 but also your own at the same time 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:29.370
 small prison builds interesting 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.959
 history from which you get a lot out 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.310
 can be quite for a german movie 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:33.959
 Neat but also has a whole 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.120
 lots of shadows around at the raffle 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:38.370
 it participates in the comments robert 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.230
 I think the youth has changed 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.000
 in landscape in which direction are 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.769
 she really somehow hardened and 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.640
 become rougher than before or are they 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:45.810
 actually back in again 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.980
 Step back because there is 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.570
 also many statistics that always stop 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.250
 show that adolescents actually 

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:51.959
 again zama will be how the 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.160
 youth has changed according to your opinion 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:55.140
 or if it itself has 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.520
 since how does she feel what has happened 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.440
 is different than in comparison to 

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:00.090
 generation before you in your age 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.400
 Any comments this direction takes 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.750
 you have to be part of lÃ¼thi for a short time 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.280
 You can not just think about it completely 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:06.780
 as easy as participating and that there 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.400
 only three professions are left over there 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.980
 the question whether dvd or blu ray as 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:13.290
 Next, I'm still alive 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:15.150
 nothing for cowards a dvd and a 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:16.430
 blu ray and dvd are still available 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.930
 soundtrack to it 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:20.640
 the story around a man and 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:22.920
 his daughter's mother is the mother 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:24.180
 or wife lose and then crashes 

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:26.490
 that live in a deep 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.990
 abyss and the question how to get there 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:29.310
 out as the daughter also abort with 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:31.320
 a chaos is the perfect chaos 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:32.340
 And I still have such a life for them 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.750
 I have to pull back 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:35.490
 but believe that he can do a lot 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:36.690
 life is not for cowards say 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:38.250
 among other things also with the astana 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:40.080
 will also box with me and can 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:41.430
 to do that as a very very good one 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.650
 friend of mine later among others 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:45.060
 also with and around the raffle 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:46.950
 to participate in the comments 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:49.170
 robert the player has frederick lau with 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:50.670
 my favorite movie with frederick is lukewarm 

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:52.440
 then writes to the comments we 

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:53.910
 many people want to write the balls 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:55.440
 and you can also have a little blu 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:56.640
 write ray or dvd behind it and 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.320
 already you can have a free copy 

00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:00.510
 There is nothing for cowards in life 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:03.420
 Last but not least I have this here 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:05.730
 original proceeded from completely fix 

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:07.860
 so only 60 seconds left to fight 

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:10.560
 the remake in julien nicolas cage is 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:12.180
 the original two dvds a blu-ray and 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.620
 to participate in the raffle it 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:15.390
 there is just a reissue on smart 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:17.520
 that's why the raffle writes in the 

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:19.650
 comments Robert I think the remake 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:21.570
 to so and so is better than the original 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:23.100
 In which movie you will find a remake 

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:23.669
 better than the original would me 

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:25.950
 interest 

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:27.780
 there are then quite fix the seconds 

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:28.740
 descend into brackets dvd or blu-ray 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:31.800
 behind it were the five 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:34.100
 various titles just under 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.100
 10 

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:41.770
 21 copies of winning is indeed a 

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:43.570
 bit like bazaar here on sunday
