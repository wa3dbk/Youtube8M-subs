00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:06.700

 works a lot at night apparently 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.730
 because I have never seen 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.730
 work at night 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:27.220
 so then I will show you 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:35.540
 how and my beach so we go down 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:38.139
 you did not start so we already have it 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.139
 is like that 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:57.200
 so I have to reach their cocoon the 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:59.730
 Rocco notes I got them on the ball 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:04.260
 when we take the boat not in a 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:05.750
 video I will not give you I give it to you 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:11.250
 basically if a video you after may 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:12.950
 on the island so here is after that it is 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:15.180
 all the same 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:18.120
 then after that it goes on a bit 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:26.090
 but hey that's patrese inspiration when 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:26.090
 it's okay so here it is 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:50.330
 what can I show you 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:50.330
 so the houses no here is the town hall 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:01.260
 place and my assistant 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:04.440
 and that's my game so I 'm not a 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:06.230
 fate to the sna link so we were not talking 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:11.640
 right here 

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:14.190
 so that's good I think all for 

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:17.940
 this first video bass and it's 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:19.320
 enough so I find you very 

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:22.490
 soon in a future video 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:26.250
 so either it will be on a tropical island 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:33.360
 or what did I tell you already 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:36.110

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:38.370
 says so it will be on the tropical island 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:40.020
 assimilated with the inhabitants and all but 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:41.730
 it will surely be a tropical not what 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:44.490
 wants the tour in when I'm done 

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:46.530

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:54.360
 that these ten years will play more if that's the 

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:56.540
