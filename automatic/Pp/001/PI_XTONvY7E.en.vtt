00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:23.550 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.460 

as<00:01:24.120> you<00:01:24.300> can<00:01:24.450> see<00:01:24.600> our<00:01:24.720> torque<00:01:24.990> arm<00:01:25.170> went<00:01:25.350> in

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
as you can see our torque arm went in

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.560 
as you can see our torque arm went in
pretty<00:01:25.650> smoothly<00:01:26.070> and<00:01:26.400> it<00:01:26.730> did<00:01:26.910> bolt<00:01:27.150> up<00:01:27.360> right

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
pretty smoothly and it did bolt up right

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.750 
pretty smoothly and it did bolt up right
to<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.750> factory<00:01:28.260> mounting<00:01:28.410> locations<00:01:29.160> now

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:29.760 
to the factory mounting locations now

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.730 
to the factory mounting locations now
comes<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.180> key<00:01:30.360> step<00:01:30.660> in<00:01:30.870> the<00:01:30.900> important<00:01:31.500> part

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
comes the key step in the important part

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:32.960 
comes the key step in the important part
and<00:01:31.920> this<00:01:32.130> is<00:01:32.250> going<00:01:32.400> to<00:01:32.460> be<00:01:32.520> setting<00:01:32.850> the

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
and this is going to be setting the

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.880 
and this is going to be setting the
pinion<00:01:33.300> angle<00:01:33.450> let<00:01:34.110> me<00:01:34.200> show<00:01:34.350> you<00:01:34.410> how<00:01:34.590> to<00:01:34.650> do

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890

take your pinion angle reading from the
rear-end<00:02:00.120> angle<00:02:00.420> is<00:02:00.540> a<00:02:00.570> negative<00:02:01.020> if<00:02:01.230> it

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:01.440 
rear-end angle is a negative if it

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:02.990 
rear-end angle is a negative if it
slopes<00:02:01.680> downward<00:02:02.130> towards<00:02:02.400> the<00:02:02.550> front<00:02:02.880> of<00:02:02.940> the

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
car the rear-end angle is a positive if

it slopes upward toward the front of the
car<00:02:07.380> and<00:02:08.010> right<00:02:08.250> now<00:02:08.399> we're<00:02:08.640> at<00:02:08.760> a<00:02:08.850> negative<00:02:09.210> 5

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
car and right now we're at a negative 5

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.270 
car and right now we're at a negative 5
degrees<00:02:09.840> for<00:02:10.560> an<00:02:10.619> automatic<00:02:11.070> transmission

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
degrees for an automatic transmission

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.010 
degrees for an automatic transmission
car<00:02:11.760> we're<00:02:11.940> shooting<00:02:12.240> for<00:02:12.420> between<00:02:12.810> negative

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
car we're shooting for between negative

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.590 
car we're shooting for between negative
2<00:02:13.380> and<00:02:13.560> 3<00:02:13.770> degrees<00:02:13.920> and<00:02:14.340> that's<00:02:14.910> at<00:02:15.120> factory

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
2 and 3 degrees and that's at factory

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.200 
2 and 3 degrees and that's at factory
ride<00:02:15.810> height<00:02:16.580> now<00:02:17.580> we're<00:02:17.730> going<00:02:17.820> to<00:02:17.880> make<00:02:18.060> our

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
ride height now we're going to make our

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:20.090 
ride height now we're going to make our
calculations<00:02:18.390> for<00:02:19.020> pinion<00:02:19.380> angle<00:02:19.530> based<00:02:19.890> on

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
calculations for pinion angle based on

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.520 
calculations for pinion angle based on
the<00:02:20.190> BMR<00:02:20.640> suggested<00:02:21.240> method<00:02:21.600> which<00:02:22.020> is<00:02:22.170> taking

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
the BMR suggested method which is taking

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.320 
the BMR suggested method which is taking
the<00:02:22.590> rear-end<00:02:22.980> number<00:02:23.280> which<00:02:23.730> is<00:02:23.880> a<00:02:23.910> negative

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
the rear-end number which is a negative

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.660 
the rear-end number which is a negative
5<00:02:24.480> and<00:02:24.840> adding<00:02:25.440> it<00:02:25.530> to<00:02:25.560> the<00:02:25.770> drive<00:02:26.010> shaft<00:02:26.040> angle

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
5 and adding it to the drive shaft angle

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.000 
5 and adding it to the drive shaft angle
which<00:02:27.060> is<00:02:27.090> a<00:02:27.270> negative<00:02:27.660> 2<00:02:27.959> and<00:02:28.170> that<00:02:28.709> gives<00:02:28.860> us

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
which is a negative 2 and that gives us

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.610 
which is a negative 2 and that gives us
a<00:02:29.130> total<00:02:29.310> of<00:02:29.550> negative<00:02:29.730> 7<00:02:30.390> we're<00:02:31.140> shooting<00:02:31.470> for

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
a total of negative 7 we're shooting for

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.170 
a total of negative 7 we're shooting for
a<00:02:31.680> negative<00:02:31.860> 2<00:02:32.280> so<00:02:32.640> we're<00:02:32.790> going<00:02:32.910> to<00:02:32.970> make<00:02:33.150> a

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
a negative 2 so we're going to make a

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:39.120 
a negative 2 so we're going to make a
quick<00:02:33.480> adjustment<00:02:33.750> on<00:02:34.080> the<00:02:34.170> barrel<00:02:34.470> nut

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:40.740 

all<00:02:39.670> right<00:02:39.820> jobs<00:02:40.120> complete<00:02:40.510> and<00:02:40.630> we're<00:02:40.720> ready

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
all right jobs complete and we're ready

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.540 
all right jobs complete and we're ready
to<00:02:41.020> take<00:02:41.170> our<00:02:41.290> Camaro<00:02:41.590> off<00:02:41.830> the<00:02:42.010> rack<00:02:42.190> and<00:02:42.460> put

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
to take our Camaro off the rack and put

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:43.170 
to take our Camaro off the rack and put
it<00:02:42.610> on<00:02:42.790> the<00:02:42.910> street

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
it on the street

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.020 
it on the street
as<00:02:43.330> you've<00:02:43.960> seen<00:02:44.200> DMR<00:02:45.190> puts<00:02:45.610> together<00:02:45.790> a

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
as you've seen DMR puts together a

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.480 
as you've seen DMR puts together a
really<00:02:46.390> quality<00:02:46.900> part<00:02:47.170> the<00:02:47.560> installation<00:02:48.220> was

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:48.490 
really quality part the installation was

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:50.970 
really quality part the installation was
very<00:02:48.940> easy<00:02:49.270> and<00:02:49.990> I'm<00:02:50.140> sure<00:02:50.290> that<00:02:50.500> following

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
very easy and I'm sure that following

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.590 
very easy and I'm sure that following
the<00:02:51.100> instructions<00:02:51.670> that<00:02:51.730> VMR<00:02:52.210> puts<00:02:52.450> out

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600 
the instructions that VMR puts out

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.120 
the instructions that VMR puts out
you'll<00:02:53.170> be<00:02:53.320> able<00:02:53.410> to<00:02:53.620> achieve<00:02:53.830> the<00:02:53.950> same
