00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.650 
weapons and more armor and there's also
keys<00:02:20.049> to<00:02:20.260> unlock<00:02:20.560> and<00:02:20.950> there's<00:02:21.390> hostages<00:02:22.390> to

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
keys to unlock and there's hostages to

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.410 
keys to unlock and there's hostages to
either<00:02:22.870> save<00:02:23.170> or<00:02:23.470> mercy<00:02:24.250> kill<00:02:24.519> and<00:02:24.820> that's

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
either save or mercy kill and that's

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:26.789 
either save or mercy kill and that's
really<00:02:25.630> about<00:02:25.840> it<00:02:25.900> you<00:02:26.230> just<00:02:26.290> kind<00:02:26.590> of<00:02:26.650> go

00:02:26.789 --> 00:02:26.799 
really about it you just kind of go

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:28.020 
really about it you just kind of go
along<00:02:26.920> and<00:02:27.280> every<00:02:27.400> once<00:02:27.549> a<00:02:27.670> while<00:02:27.700> there's<00:02:28.000> a

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
along and every once a while there's a

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.220 
along and every once a while there's a
boss<00:02:28.239> battle<00:02:28.480> and<00:02:29.850> you<00:02:30.850> know<00:02:30.970> it's<00:02:31.450> fun<00:02:31.750> is<00:02:31.989> its

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
boss battle and you know it's fun is its

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:41.729 
boss battle and you know it's fun is its
simplicity

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:41.739 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:43.930 

so<00:02:42.739> graphically<00:02:43.099> this<00:02:43.310> is<00:02:43.430> a<00:02:43.459> pretty<00:02:43.700> decent

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
so graphically this is a pretty decent

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.300 
so graphically this is a pretty decent
game<00:02:44.239> especially<00:02:44.720> for<00:02:44.959> an<00:02:45.230> old<00:02:45.530> Dreamcast

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
game especially for an old Dreamcast

game especially for an old Dreamcast

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
there's real-time lighting there's lots

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.539 
there's real-time lighting there's lots

of textures and the framerate never
falters<00:02:56.090> considering<00:02:56.659> that<00:02:56.780> there's<00:02:56.930> so<00:02:57.200> much

00:02:57.339 --> 00:02:57.349 
falters considering that there's so much

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:00.550 
falters considering that there's so much
going<00:02:57.590> on<00:02:58.840> you<00:02:59.840> know<00:02:59.959> it's<00:03:00.140> just<00:03:00.230> kind<00:03:00.409> of<00:03:00.500> a

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
going on you know it's just kind of a

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.229 
going on you know it's just kind of a
joy<00:03:00.829> to<00:03:00.890> play<00:03:01.190> it's<00:03:01.489> actually<00:03:01.849> pretty

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.239 
joy to play it's actually pretty

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:05.380 
joy to play it's actually pretty
impressive<00:03:02.569> a<00:03:03.190> lot<00:03:04.190> this<00:03:04.400> stuff<00:03:04.640> blows<00:03:04.940> up<00:03:05.150> and

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
impressive a lot this stuff blows up and

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:13.110 
impressive a lot this stuff blows up and
the<00:03:05.870> game<00:03:06.049> never<00:03:06.230> slows<00:03:06.590> down<00:03:06.620> for<00:03:06.980> a<00:03:07.010> second

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.369 

now<00:03:14.120> not<00:03:14.329> everything<00:03:14.780> is<00:03:14.870> great<00:03:15.049> about<00:03:15.170> this

00:03:15.369 --> 00:03:15.379 
now not everything is great about this

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:15.819 
now not everything is great about this
game

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:15.829 
game

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:18.460 
game
it's<00:03:16.220> definitely<00:03:16.579> a<00:03:16.790> budget<00:03:17.209> title<00:03:17.540> and<00:03:17.750> the

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
it's definitely a budget title and the

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:19.569 
it's definitely a budget title and the
reason<00:03:18.739> for<00:03:18.769> that<00:03:18.890> is<00:03:19.069> frankly<00:03:19.459> is<00:03:19.519> the

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:19.579 
reason for that is frankly is the

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:21.309 
reason for that is frankly is the
controls<00:03:20.000> and<00:03:20.359> it's<00:03:20.510> not<00:03:20.780> necessarily<00:03:21.230> the

00:03:21.309 --> 00:03:21.319 
controls and it's not necessarily the

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:22.720 
controls and it's not necessarily the
fault<00:03:21.500> of<00:03:21.620> the<00:03:21.709> game<00:03:21.920> it's<00:03:22.280> actually<00:03:22.459> the

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
fault of the game it's actually the

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:25.479 
fault of the game it's actually the
Dreamcast<00:03:23.359> controller<00:03:23.709> the<00:03:24.709> Dreamcast<00:03:25.190> only

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:25.489 
Dreamcast controller the Dreamcast only

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:28.240 
Dreamcast controller the Dreamcast only
has<00:03:25.700> one<00:03:26.150> analog<00:03:26.750> stick<00:03:27.049> on<00:03:27.230> it<00:03:27.260> and<00:03:27.530> this<00:03:28.010> is<00:03:28.220> a

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
has one analog stick on it and this is a

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.440 
has one analog stick on it and this is a
game<00:03:28.730> that<00:03:29.680> absolutely<00:03:30.680> could<00:03:31.310> be<00:03:31.970> so<00:03:32.299> much

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
game that absolutely could be so much

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:34.479 
game that absolutely could be so much
better<00:03:32.659> with<00:03:32.930> two<00:03:33.109> analog<00:03:33.530> sticks<00:03:33.590> because

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:34.489 
better with two analog sticks because

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:37.780 
better with two analog sticks because
you<00:03:35.450> can't<00:03:35.840> move<00:03:36.470> and<00:03:36.799> shoot<00:03:37.280> in<00:03:37.579> two

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:37.790 
you can't move and shoot in two

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.240 
you can't move and shoot in two
different<00:03:37.940> directions<00:03:38.150> and<00:03:38.780> this<00:03:39.079> game<00:03:39.319> this

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
different directions and this game this

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.220 
different directions and this game this
game<00:03:40.310> would<00:03:40.579> be<00:03:40.609> awesome<00:03:41.120> if<00:03:41.209> you<00:03:41.299> could<00:03:41.569> so

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 
game would be awesome if you could so

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:43.750 
game would be awesome if you could so
essentially<00:03:42.709> what<00:03:42.920> you've<00:03:43.099> got<00:03:43.250> to<00:03:43.370> do<00:03:43.519> is

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
essentially what you've got to do is

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.879 
essentially what you've got to do is
strafe<00:03:44.419> all<00:03:44.690> the<00:03:44.810> time<00:03:45.019> you<00:03:45.260> see<00:03:45.500> me<00:03:45.680> doing

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:45.889 
strafe all the time you see me doing

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:49.420 
strafe all the time you see me doing
that<00:03:46.190> going<00:03:47.120> back<00:03:47.299> and<00:03:47.480> forth<00:03:47.780> and<00:03:48.430> that's

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
that going back and forth and that's

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.339 
that going back and forth and that's
really<00:03:49.700> all<00:03:49.880> you<00:03:50.030> can<00:03:50.060> do<00:03:50.359> and<00:03:50.660> it's<00:03:50.780> kind<00:03:51.109> of<00:03:51.169> a

00:03:51.339 --> 00:03:51.349 
really all you can do and it's kind of a

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:53.589 
really all you can do and it's kind of a
one-trick<00:03:52.010> pony<00:03:52.310> it's<00:03:52.669> it's<00:03:53.060> not<00:03:53.299> really

00:03:53.589 --> 00:03:53.599 
one-trick pony it's it's not really

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:55.780 
one-trick pony it's it's not really
precise<00:03:53.989> if<00:03:54.560> this<00:03:54.769> game<00:03:55.010> was<00:03:55.340> more<00:03:55.549> like

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
precise if this game was more like

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:56.920 
precise if this game was more like
geometry<00:03:56.269> Wars

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:56.930 
geometry Wars

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:59.080 
geometry Wars
it<00:03:57.019> would<00:03:57.169> be<00:03:57.319> perfect<00:03:57.919> where<00:03:58.489> you<00:03:58.669> could<00:03:58.819> sort

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090 
it would be perfect where you could sort

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:00.460 
it would be perfect where you could sort
of<00:03:59.120> move<00:03:59.329> off<00:03:59.510> in<00:03:59.690> one<00:03:59.810> direction<00:03:59.959> and<00:04:00.349> be

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.470 
of move off in one direction and be

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:02.860 
of move off in one direction and be
firing<00:04:00.829> in<00:04:01.069> another<00:04:01.400> but<00:04:02.090> sadly<00:04:02.419> you<00:04:02.629> can

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
firing in another but sadly you can

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:04.990 
firing in another but sadly you can
instead<00:04:03.470> you<00:04:03.650> just<00:04:03.829> basically<00:04:04.010> you<00:04:04.910> know

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:05.000 
instead you just basically you know

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.720 
instead you just basically you know
you're<00:04:05.510> strafing<00:04:05.959> around<00:04:06.260> something<00:04:06.769> until

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:07.730 
you're strafing around something until

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:11.140 
you're strafing around something until
it<00:04:07.879> dies<00:04:08.060> and<00:04:08.450> you<00:04:09.319> know<00:04:09.489> unfortunately<00:04:10.489> it's

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
it dies and you know unfortunately it's

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:21.550 
it dies and you know unfortunately it's
not<00:04:11.359> perfect

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.200 

so<00:04:22.560> if<00:04:22.740> you<00:04:22.860> happen<00:04:23.040> to<00:04:23.220> stumble<00:04:23.460> across<00:04:23.730> to

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
so if you happen to stumble across to

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:26.390 
so if you happen to stumble across to
copy<00:04:24.419> of<00:04:24.720> expendable<00:04:25.290> like<00:04:25.440> I<00:04:25.590> did<00:04:25.860> for<00:04:26.130> just<00:04:26.340> a

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
copy of expendable like I did for just a

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.750 
copy of expendable like I did for just a
couple<00:04:26.699> dollars<00:04:26.850> and<00:04:27.750> you<00:04:27.870> owned<00:04:28.290> a<00:04:28.320> Dreamcast

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:28.760 
couple dollars and you owned a Dreamcast

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:32.000 
couple dollars and you owned a Dreamcast
and<00:04:29.840> this<00:04:30.840> is<00:04:30.990> a<00:04:31.020> pretty<00:04:31.290> cool<00:04:31.530> game<00:04:31.710> I<00:04:31.889> mean

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.010 
and this is a pretty cool game I mean

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:34.879 
and this is a pretty cool game I mean
it's<00:04:32.160> not<00:04:32.250> perfect<00:04:32.729> but<00:04:33.360> damn<00:04:33.960> it<00:04:34.290> is<00:04:34.440> fun<00:04:34.710> if
