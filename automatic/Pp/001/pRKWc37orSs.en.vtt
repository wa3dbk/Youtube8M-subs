again

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:05.840 
again
is<00:02:02.810> you<00:02:03.810> you<00:02:04.560> die

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
is you you die

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.790 
is you you die
now<00:02:06.850> this<00:02:07.030> doesn't<00:02:07.299> work<00:02:07.420> every<00:02:07.750> time<00:02:08.050> because

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 
now this doesn't work every time because

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.970 
now this doesn't work every time because
of<00:02:09.340> the<00:02:09.819> way<00:02:09.849> assuming<00:02:10.390> I'm<00:02:10.840> how<00:02:11.170> I'm<00:02:11.620> assuming

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
of the way assuming I'm how I'm assuming

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.460 
of the way assuming I'm how I'm assuming
the<00:02:12.069> way<00:02:12.160> this<00:02:12.310> works<00:02:12.610> is<00:02:12.849> the<00:02:13.180> game

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
the way this works is the game

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.710 
the way this works is the game
auto-saves<00:02:14.470> every<00:02:14.580> you<00:02:15.580> know<00:02:15.730> thirty<00:02:16.270> seconds

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
auto-saves every you know thirty seconds

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.470 
auto-saves every you know thirty seconds
or<00:02:16.780> so<00:02:16.840> and<00:02:17.790> you<00:02:18.790> just<00:02:18.970> don't<00:02:19.180> know<00:02:19.330> when

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
or so and you just don't know when

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.900 
or so and you just don't know when
that's<00:02:19.660> asked<00:02:20.050> and<00:02:20.200> you're<00:02:20.980> forced<00:02:21.580> quitting

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
that's asked and you're forced quitting

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.370 
that's asked and you're forced quitting
the<00:02:21.970> stuff<00:02:22.180> before<00:02:22.390> it<00:02:22.599> could<00:02:22.720> actually<00:02:22.840> save

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
the stuff before it could actually save

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.800 
the stuff before it could actually save
that<00:02:23.709> you<00:02:23.830> actually<00:02:24.010> died<00:02:24.580> that's<00:02:25.390> what<00:02:25.660> I'm

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
that you actually died that's what I'm

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.089 
that you actually died that's what I'm
assuming<00:02:26.470> so<00:02:27.010> when<00:02:27.310> you<00:02:27.400> die<00:02:28.440> just<00:02:29.440> tap<00:02:29.650> out<00:02:29.800> I

00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:30.099 
assuming so when you die just tap out I

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:31.770 
assuming so when you die just tap out I
already<00:02:30.430> have<00:02:30.580> my<00:02:30.730> task<00:02:30.970> manager<00:02:31.269> open<00:02:31.390> but

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
already have my task manager open but

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.270 
already have my task manager open but
let's<00:02:31.989> say<00:02:32.080> if<00:02:32.140> you<00:02:32.230> didn't<00:02:32.530> you<00:02:32.769> just<00:02:33.040> go<00:02:33.220> to

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
let's say if you didn't you just go to

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.330 
let's say if you didn't you just go to
your<00:02:33.519> toolbar<00:02:34.209> or<00:02:34.660> your<00:02:35.319> Start<00:02:35.800> bar<00:02:36.190> or

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
your toolbar or your Start bar or

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:37.410 
your toolbar or your Start bar or
whatever<00:02:36.610> you<00:02:36.790> want<00:02:37.060> to<00:02:37.120> call<00:02:37.269> this

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
whatever you want to call this

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.479 
whatever you want to call this
right-click<00:02:38.049> on<00:02:38.319> it<00:02:38.380> and<00:02:38.680> go<00:02:38.980> to<00:02:39.010> start<00:02:39.250> task

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
right-click on it and go to start task

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:41.789 
right-click on it and go to start task
and<00:02:39.819> task<00:02:39.940> man<00:02:40.299> and<00:02:40.450> mender<00:02:40.780> I<00:02:41.019> can't<00:02:41.560> speak

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:41.799 
and task man and mender I can't speak

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:44.250 
and task man and mender I can't speak
today<00:02:41.950> and<00:02:42.569> generally<00:02:43.569> if<00:02:43.810> you<00:02:43.959> have<00:02:44.110> this

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
today and generally if you have this

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.289 
today and generally if you have this
billion<00:02:44.799> it<00:02:44.950> should<00:02:45.130> be<00:02:45.250> the<00:02:45.370> top<00:02:45.549> one<00:02:45.580> I<00:02:46.000> sort

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:46.299 
billion it should be the top one I sort

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:49.430 
billion it should be the top one I sort
my<00:02:46.420> stuff<00:02:46.630> by<00:02:46.840> memory<00:02:47.519> so<00:02:48.519> I<00:02:48.580> can<00:02:48.730> see<00:02:48.880> what's

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
my stuff by memory so I can see what's

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.509 
my stuff by memory so I can see what's
what's<00:02:50.440> using<00:02:50.650> the<00:02:50.739> most<00:02:50.860> memory<00:02:51.190> right<00:02:51.430> off

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:51.519 
what's using the most memory right off

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:54.090 
what's using the most memory right off
the<00:02:51.640> back<00:02:51.870> and<00:02:52.870> then<00:02:53.110> you<00:02:53.230> just<00:02:53.260> force<00:02:53.709> quit<00:02:53.950> it

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.100 
the back and then you just force quit it

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.940 
the back and then you just force quit it
so<00:02:54.250> let's<00:02:54.430> see<00:02:54.549> if<00:02:54.640> this<00:02:54.730> works<00:02:55.000> again<00:02:55.360> um

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
so let's see if this works again um

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:00.979 
so let's see if this works again um
yeah<00:02:57.930> and<00:02:58.930> I've<00:02:59.680> been<00:02:59.709> jumped<00:03:00.130> this<00:03:00.220> way<00:03:00.400> yes

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
yeah and I've been jumped this way yes

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:06.690 
yeah and I've been jumped this way yes
yeah<00:03:02.760> so<00:03:03.760> task<00:03:04.299> manager<00:03:05.220> right<00:03:06.220> click<00:03:06.250> and

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
yeah so task manager right click and

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.490 
yeah so task manager right click and
press<00:03:07.060> the<00:03:07.269> street<00:03:07.920> hey<00:03:08.920> yes<00:03:09.690> I<00:03:10.690> tried<00:03:11.049> hit<00:03:11.290> and

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
press the street hey yes I tried hit and

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.199 
press the street hey yes I tried hit and
process<00:03:12.040> sometimes<00:03:12.459> it<00:03:12.790> worked<00:03:12.970> with<00:03:13.060> that

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209 
process sometimes it worked with that

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:14.699 
process sometimes it worked with that
sometimes<00:03:13.540> it<00:03:13.660> didn't<00:03:13.930> so<00:03:14.019> I<00:03:14.049> just<00:03:14.260> like<00:03:14.410> tenth

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
sometimes it didn't so I just like tenth

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:18.890 
sometimes it didn't so I just like tenth
and<00:03:14.890> ending<00:03:15.430> it<00:03:15.579> with<00:03:15.609> process<00:03:16.150> tree<00:03:16.359> and

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:25.099 

let's<00:03:19.900> see<00:03:20.140> if<00:03:20.170> it<00:03:20.320> worked<00:03:23.700> it<00:03:24.700> worked

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:25.109 
let's see if it worked it worked

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:28.020 
let's see if it worked it worked
tada<00:03:26.560> it<00:03:27.040> saved<00:03:27.370> right<00:03:27.519> before<00:03:27.820> I<00:03:27.850> hit<00:03:27.970> the

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
tada it saved right before I hit the

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.800 
tada it saved right before I hit the
ground<00:03:28.120> did<00:03:28.660> you<00:03:28.720> see<00:03:28.840> that<00:03:28.989> I<00:03:29.049> was<00:03:29.350> in<00:03:29.470> a<00:03:29.500> loop

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
ground did you see that I was in a loop

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.780 
ground did you see that I was in a loop
so<00:03:31.810> as<00:03:32.049> you<00:03:32.170> can<00:03:32.260> see<00:03:32.320> if<00:03:32.650> the<00:03:32.920> game<00:03:33.100> saves<00:03:33.400> just

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
so as you can see if the game saves just

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.210 
so as you can see if the game saves just
a<00:03:33.970> you<00:03:34.359> know<00:03:34.390> fracturing<00:03:34.780> second<00:03:35.170> later<00:03:35.350> it

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
a you know fracturing second later it

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:42.090 
a you know fracturing second later it
would<00:03:36.519> have<00:03:36.609> been<00:03:36.730> too<00:03:36.940> late<00:03:38.609> so<00:03:39.609> yeah<00:03:41.040> this<00:03:42.040> is

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:42.100 
would have been too late so yeah this is

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:45.960 
would have been too late so yeah this is
I<00:03:42.489> would<00:03:42.579> say<00:03:42.760> you<00:03:42.819> have<00:03:42.970> about<00:03:44.609> sixty<00:03:45.609> to

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
I would say you have about sixty to

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:47.280 
I would say you have about sixty to
seventy<00:03:46.299> percent<00:03:46.329> chance<00:03:46.569> of<00:03:46.870> recovering

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
seventy percent chance of recovering

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:52.500 
seventy percent chance of recovering
your<00:03:47.410> hard<00:03:47.739> hardcore<00:03:48.519> game<00:03:49.620> using<00:03:50.620> this<00:03:51.510> it

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
your hard hardcore game using this it

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:54.660 
your hard hardcore game using this it
helped<00:03:53.049> me<00:03:53.200> out<00:03:53.230> when<00:03:53.590> that<00:03:53.739> random<00:03:54.310> creeper

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:54.670 
helped me out when that random creeper

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:56.550 
helped me out when that random creeper
exploded<00:03:55.269> and<00:03:55.450> it<00:03:55.660> was<00:03:55.780> the<00:03:55.930> weirdest<00:03:56.319> thing<00:03:56.380> I

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
exploded and it was the weirdest thing I

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.789 
exploded and it was the weirdest thing I
was<00:03:56.709> literally<00:03:56.980> like<00:03:57.340> on<00:03:58.239> the<00:03:58.510> bushes<00:03:59.170> in<00:03:59.620> the

00:03:59.789 --> 00:03:59.799 
was literally like on the bushes in the

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:03.960 
was literally like on the bushes in the
jungle<00:04:00.190> like<00:04:00.489> this<00:04:01.200> it<00:04:02.200> came<00:04:02.470> up<00:04:02.680> like<00:04:03.400> here

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
jungle like this it came up like here

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.590 
jungle like this it came up like here
and<00:04:04.150> blew<00:04:04.959> up<00:04:04.989> and<00:04:05.560> I<00:04:06.280> go<00:04:06.519> skyrocket<00:04:07.329> into<00:04:07.540> the

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:07.600 
and blew up and I go skyrocket into the

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.490 
and blew up and I go skyrocket into the
air<00:04:07.720> like<00:04:07.959> toward<00:04:08.590> those<00:04:08.829> trees<00:04:09.130> and<00:04:09.430> I<00:04:09.850> land

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
air like toward those trees and I land

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.990 
air like toward those trees and I land
practically<00:04:11.500> like<00:04:11.709> a<00:04:11.739> way<00:04:11.950> over<00:04:12.160> here<00:04:12.430> it<00:04:12.819> was

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
practically like a way over here it was

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.879 
practically like a way over here it was
the<00:04:13.150> weirdest<00:04:13.569> thing<00:04:13.720> ever<00:04:13.840> and<00:04:13.989> I<00:04:14.199> died<00:04:14.500> oh

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:14.889 
the weirdest thing ever and I died oh

00:04:14.889 --> 00:04:18.180 
the weirdest thing ever and I died oh
we're<00:04:15.519> just<00:04:15.549> like<00:04:16.720> it<00:04:17.010> scared<00:04:18.010> me

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 
we're just like it scared me

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:18.900 
we're just like it scared me
and<00:04:18.280> I<00:04:18.370> just<00:04:18.549> feel<00:04:18.669> like

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:18.910 
and I just feel like

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:21.509 
and I just feel like
good<00:04:19.450> what<00:04:19.930> do<00:04:20.019> I<00:04:20.050> do<00:04:20.140> and<00:04:20.560> so<00:04:20.980> I<00:04:21.040> just<00:04:21.280> did

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:21.519 
good what do I do and so I just did

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:23.670 
good what do I do and so I just did
random<00:04:22.360> over<00:04:22.750> the<00:04:22.870> next<00:04:23.050> few<00:04:23.230> seconds

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 
random over the next few seconds

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.130 
random over the next few seconds
and<00:04:23.860> this<00:04:24.580> seemed<00:04:24.910> to<00:04:25.270> work<00:04:25.510> and<00:04:25.810> I<00:04:25.840> spent

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:26.140 
and this seemed to work and I spent

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:28.260 
and this seemed to work and I spent
actually<00:04:26.290> the<00:04:26.500> last<00:04:26.650> 40<00:04:27.040> minutes<00:04:27.120> making<00:04:28.120> sure

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:28.270 
actually the last 40 minutes making sure

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:29.760 
actually the last 40 minutes making sure
it<00:04:28.420> worked<00:04:28.630> figuring<00:04:29.080> out<00:04:29.200> different<00:04:29.230> ways

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770 
it worked figuring out different ways

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:31.410 
it worked figuring out different ways
you<00:04:29.920> can<00:04:30.040> do<00:04:30.190> it<00:04:30.220> and<00:04:30.610> this<00:04:30.880> seemed<00:04:31.060> to<00:04:31.210> be<00:04:31.240> the

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:31.420 
you can do it and this seemed to be the
