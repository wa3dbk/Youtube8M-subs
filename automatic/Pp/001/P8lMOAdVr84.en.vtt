00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.060
 I heard the mole gigio and I have a 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.490
 thought about that I grew up with 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:12.120
 the mole gigio my old man did it 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.860
 look but if I generate a little doubt 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.980
 sexual 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.140
 like a spoon like they heard things 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:23.250
 but that much less things for me 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:27.060
 this area is viewer the person who is 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:32.300
 goes behind if behind with a little hand 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.300
 ankle and with the other for me really 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:42.900
 for this justice this justice 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.900
 but 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.420
 [Music] 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:57.280
 but it has an accusation fosis and everything 

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.890
 that is material we have all our 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:02.020
 material generation and I think a little 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.300
 further back to our generation have 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:07.080
 grown up with the mole gigio sent us to 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.080
 the bed at ten o'clock at night 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.780
 I think that I do not think we're 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:25.030
 confusing something of the mole armchairs 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:27.570
 he says he had big ears he 's 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.570
 saying this 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:35.020
 we have another other sound in those 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:38.230
 tests and I have tests in the study 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.230
 [Music] 

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:48.360
 Hello my love 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:51.519

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.519

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.290

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.130
 with them 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:54.220
 can be 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.220
 [Music] 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.770
 do not 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.290
 with the approval that is 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.330
 [Music] 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:22.200
 the truth that has opened our eyes 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:22.200
 really the open mole several
