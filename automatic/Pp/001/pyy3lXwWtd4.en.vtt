know<00:01:41.970> I<00:01:42.000> thought<00:01:42.270> it<00:01:42.390> was<00:01:42.509> going<00:01:42.630> to<00:01:42.659> be<00:01:42.810> a<00:01:42.840> lot

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
know I thought it was going to be a lot

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.389 
know I thought it was going to be a lot
different<00:01:43.140> to<00:01:43.439> what<00:01:43.560> is<00:01:43.710> but<00:01:43.920> it's<00:01:44.040> been<00:01:44.159> it's

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
different to what is but it's been it's

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.760 
different to what is but it's been it's
been<00:01:44.490> really<00:01:44.579> difficult<00:01:44.850> I<00:01:45.659> feel<00:01:46.439> like<00:01:46.590> I'm

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
been really difficult I feel like I'm

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.830 
been really difficult I feel like I'm
adjusting<00:01:47.250> pretty<00:01:47.549> quickly<00:01:47.790> considering<00:01:48.390> you

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
adjusting pretty quickly considering you

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.660 
adjusting pretty quickly considering you
know<00:01:48.930> I<00:01:48.960> haven't<00:01:49.140> had<00:01:49.320> much<00:01:49.470> time<00:01:49.740> to<00:01:49.979> to

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
know I haven't had much time to to

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.050 
know I haven't had much time to to
adjust<00:01:51.000> but<00:01:51.829> the<00:01:52.829> beauty<00:01:53.130> for<00:01:53.280> me<00:01:53.430> is<00:01:53.549> it's

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
adjust but the beauty for me is it's

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.550 
adjust but the beauty for me is it's
been<00:01:54.240> a<00:01:54.270> challenge<00:01:54.720> and<00:01:54.960> I<00:01:55.110> feel<00:01:55.140> like<00:01:55.409> that's

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
been a challenge and I feel like that's

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.130 
been a challenge and I feel like that's
what's<00:01:55.740> been<00:01:55.890> lacking<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.280> past<00:01:56.490> few<00:01:56.670> years

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
what's been lacking the past few years

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.690 
what's been lacking the past few years
for<00:01:58.140> me<00:01:58.320> and<00:01:58.500> things<00:01:58.979> got<00:01:59.100> a<00:01:59.159> little<00:01:59.369> bit<00:01:59.460> stale

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
for me and things got a little bit stale

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.910 
for me and things got a little bit stale
and<00:02:00.000> and<00:02:00.390> I<00:02:00.570> probably<00:02:00.780> wasn't<00:02:01.020> motivated<00:02:01.259> to

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
and and I probably wasn't motivated to

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.440 
and and I probably wasn't motivated to
the<00:02:02.009> point<00:02:02.250> to<00:02:02.430> try<00:02:02.729> and<00:02:02.880> get<00:02:02.969> my<00:02:03.090> mojo<00:02:03.420> back

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
the point to try and get my mojo back

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.999 
the point to try and get my mojo back

been<00:02:12.959> a<00:02:13.020> real

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
been a real

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.400 
been a real
Islands<00:02:13.570> from<00:02:13.720> I<00:02:13.930> mean<00:02:13.960> he's<00:02:14.200> been<00:02:14.350> a

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
Islands from I mean he's been a

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.560 
Islands from I mean he's been a
superstar<00:02:14.860> first<00:02:15.430> pick<00:02:15.700> every<00:02:15.970> week<00:02:16.150> so<00:02:16.420> he's

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.570 
superstar first pick every week so he's

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:19.920 
superstar first pick every week so he's
learning<00:02:17.020> a<00:02:17.110> new<00:02:18.030> game<00:02:19.030> and<00:02:19.330> a<00:02:19.390> new<00:02:19.600> set<00:02:19.900> of

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
learning a new game and a new set of

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.340 
learning a new game and a new set of
tactics<00:02:20.470> and<00:02:20.710> I<00:02:21.040> think<00:02:21.730> the<00:02:22.600> ways<00:02:22.750> handle<00:02:23.230> has

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
tactics and I think the ways handle has

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:25.800 
tactics and I think the ways handle has
been<00:02:23.530> unbelievable<00:02:24.190> so<00:02:24.430> he's<00:02:24.640> had<00:02:24.850> to<00:02:25.120> be

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
been unbelievable so he's had to be

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.630 
been unbelievable so he's had to be
patient<00:02:26.290> which<00:02:26.590> is<00:02:26.770> not<00:02:27.040> something<00:02:27.460> of<00:02:27.520> these

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
patient which is not something of these

patient which is not something of these
used<00:02:28.090> to<00:02:28.270> but<00:02:29.140> he's<00:02:29.290> been<00:02:29.470> incredibly<00:02:29.920> good<00:02:30.640> at

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
used to but he's been incredibly good at

the<00:03:16.810> same<00:03:16.989> sort<00:03:17.200> of<00:03:17.230> stuff<00:03:17.410> they're<00:03:17.590> saying

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
the same sort of stuff they're saying

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.650 
the same sort of stuff they're saying
about<00:03:17.890> me<00:03:18.220> you<00:03:18.519> know<00:03:18.640> you<00:03:18.700> he<00:03:19.390> was<00:03:19.480> on<00:03:19.570> the

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
about me you know you he was on the

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.539 
about me you know you he was on the
benches<00:03:19.959> on<00:03:20.170> the<00:03:20.260> wing<00:03:20.440> and<00:03:20.709> look<00:03:21.250> at<00:03:21.340> him<00:03:21.430> go

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:21.549 
benches on the wing and look at him go

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:23.250 
benches on the wing and look at him go
now<00:03:21.700> you<00:03:21.760> know<00:03:21.880> so<00:03:22.269> I<00:03:22.480> think<00:03:22.900> I<00:03:22.959> just<00:03:22.989> need<00:03:23.230> a

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
now you know so I think I just need a

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.080 
now you know so I think I just need a
bit<00:03:23.410> of<00:03:23.440> time<00:03:23.680> and<00:03:23.890> maybe<00:03:24.580> a<00:03:24.700> bit<00:03:24.910> of<00:03:24.940> an

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
bit of time and maybe a bit of an

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.060 
bit of time and maybe a bit of an
opportunity<00:03:25.510> and<00:03:25.720> if<00:03:26.440> that<00:03:26.620> comes<00:03:26.860> my<00:03:27.040> way

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.070 
opportunity and if that comes my way

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:31.380 
opportunity and if that comes my way
well<00:03:27.430> I'll<00:03:28.420> take<00:03:28.570> it<00:03:29.850> helping<00:03:30.850> him<00:03:31.000> make<00:03:31.239> the

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.390 
well I'll take it helping him make the

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:33.090 
well I'll take it helping him make the
transition<00:03:31.959> as<00:03:32.049> a<00:03:32.080> former<00:03:32.470> all<00:03:32.620> black<00:03:32.650> would

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:33.100 
transition as a former all black would

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.030 
transition as a former all black would
experience<00:03:33.730> in<00:03:33.970> both<00:03:34.209> codes

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
experience in both codes

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.699 
experience in both codes
the<00:03:36.040> problem<00:03:36.459> with<00:03:37.269> Bengie<00:03:37.720> is<00:03:37.900> the<00:03:38.530> two

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:38.709 
the problem with Bengie is the two

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:40.520 
the problem with Bengie is the two
positions<00:03:39.160> that<00:03:39.310> he's<00:03:39.459> playing<00:03:39.910> are<00:03:40.330> very

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
positions that he's playing are very

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.530 
positions that he's playing are very
very<00:03:41.530> difficult<00:03:42.390> tactically<00:03:43.390> and

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 
very difficult tactically and

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.270 
very difficult tactically and
technically<00:03:44.170> so<00:03:44.560> there's<00:03:44.799> lots<00:03:45.040> that<00:03:45.130> you

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
technically so there's lots that you

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.870 
technically so there's lots that you
have<00:03:45.430> to<00:03:45.580> learn<00:03:45.700> from<00:03:46.540> rugby<00:03:46.810> to<00:03:47.790> you<00:03:48.790> know

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:48.880 
have to learn from rugby to you know

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.490 
have to learn from rugby to you know
from<00:03:49.030> I<00:03:49.120> really<00:03:49.239> to<00:03:49.510> rugby<00:03:49.690> I<00:03:50.019> think<00:03:50.260> what<00:03:50.470> I

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
from I really to rugby I think what I

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.500 
from I really to rugby I think what I
did<00:03:50.799> was<00:03:50.950> a<00:03:50.980> lot<00:03:51.220> simpler<00:03:51.610> you<00:03:51.820> know<00:03:51.850> just<00:03:52.390> had

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
did was a lot simpler you know just had

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:54.330 
did was a lot simpler you know just had
to<00:03:52.630> run<00:03:52.780> with<00:03:52.840> the<00:03:53.019> ball<00:03:53.200> and<00:03:53.440> like<00:03:54.010> my<00:03:54.130> dad

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
to run with the ball and like my dad

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.039 
to run with the ball and like my dad
said<00:03:54.580> who<00:03:54.670> played<00:03:54.880> rugby<00:03:55.030> you<00:03:55.420> get<00:03:55.600> back<00:03:55.840> and

00:03:56.039 --> 00:03:56.049 
said who played rugby you get back and

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:57.570 
said who played rugby you get back and
take<00:03:56.200> the<00:03:56.350> ball<00:03:56.500> up<00:03:56.680> for<00:03:56.830> the<00:03:56.950> big<00:03:57.130> fellas<00:03:57.430> when

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:57.580 
take the ball up for the big fellas when

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:58.979 
take the ball up for the big fellas when
they're<00:03:57.730> tired<00:03:57.880> and<00:03:58.150> you'll<00:03:58.239> always<00:03:58.390> be<00:03:58.660> okay

00:03:58.979 --> 00:03:58.989 
they're tired and you'll always be okay

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:01.530 
they're tired and you'll always be okay
whereas<00:03:59.680> I<00:03:59.769> think<00:03:59.799> what<00:04:00.459> Benji's<00:04:00.910> learning<00:04:01.330> is

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
whereas I think what Benji's learning is

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.780 
whereas I think what Benji's learning is
you<00:04:02.320> know<00:04:02.440> a<00:04:02.470> little<00:04:02.709> bit<00:04:02.799> different<00:04:03.160> I<00:04:03.459> knew

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790 
you know a little bit different I knew

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:05.009 
you know a little bit different I knew
there<00:04:03.940> was<00:04:04.000> gonna<00:04:04.120> be<00:04:04.209> pressure<00:04:04.540> around<00:04:04.810> this

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:05.019 
there was gonna be pressure around this

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:06.600 
there was gonna be pressure around this
decision<00:04:05.500> and<00:04:05.650> all<00:04:05.799> eyes<00:04:06.010> were<00:04:06.160> gonna<00:04:06.280> be<00:04:06.489> on

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:06.610 
decision and all eyes were gonna be on

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:08.970 
decision and all eyes were gonna be on
me<00:04:06.790> and<00:04:07.030> people<00:04:07.390> gonna<00:04:07.660> be<00:04:07.840> the<00:04:08.350> expectations

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:08.980 
me and people gonna be the expectations

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:10.319 
me and people gonna be the expectations
we're<00:04:09.130> gonna<00:04:09.250> be<00:04:09.430> through<00:04:09.640> the<00:04:09.730> roof<00:04:09.940> and<00:04:10.209> you

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:10.329 
we're gonna be through the roof and you

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:11.729 
we're gonna be through the roof and you
know<00:04:10.450> I<00:04:10.480> had<00:04:10.630> my<00:04:10.660> own<00:04:10.900> expectations<00:04:11.200> that<00:04:11.620> are

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:11.739 
know I had my own expectations that are

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:13.979 
know I had my own expectations that are
pretty<00:04:11.860> high<00:04:12.040> and<00:04:12.250> yeah<00:04:13.180> I<00:04:13.209> must<00:04:13.540> admit<00:04:13.690> it<00:04:13.870> got

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:13.989 
pretty high and yeah I must admit it got

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:15.660 
pretty high and yeah I must admit it got
a<00:04:14.019> little<00:04:14.110> bit<00:04:14.290> frustrating<00:04:14.860> at<00:04:14.980> times<00:04:15.010> and

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:15.670 
a little bit frustrating at times and

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:17.130 
a little bit frustrating at times and
then<00:04:15.850> I<00:04:15.880> just<00:04:16.120> had<00:04:16.359> to<00:04:16.479> think<00:04:16.630> about<00:04:16.750> the

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:17.140 
then I just had to think about the

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:19.140 
then I just had to think about the
reasons<00:04:17.500> why<00:04:17.650> I<00:04:17.680> changed<00:04:18.130> to<00:04:18.850> make<00:04:19.030> this

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.150 
reasons why I changed to make this

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:21.000 
reasons why I changed to make this
decision<00:04:19.600> and<00:04:19.750> that<00:04:19.840> was<00:04:19.900> to<00:04:20.229> to<00:04:20.829> bid<00:04:20.979> on

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.010 
decision and that was to to bid on

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:22.830 
decision and that was to to bid on
myself<00:04:21.250> and<00:04:21.609> find<00:04:21.820> myself<00:04:21.970> again<00:04:22.419> and<00:04:22.450> I<00:04:22.630> feel

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
myself and find myself again and I feel

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.630 
myself and find myself again and I feel
like<00:04:22.990> I've<00:04:23.140> done<00:04:23.289> that<00:04:23.470> so<00:04:23.680> in<00:04:24.010> my<00:04:24.280> eyes<00:04:24.430> it's

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:24.640 
like I've done that so in my eyes it's

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.660 
like I've done that so in my eyes it's
been<00:04:24.789> a<00:04:24.820> success<00:04:25.240> so<00:04:25.419> far<00:04:25.450> but<00:04:25.900> it's

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:26.670 
been a success so far but it's

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:28.550 
been a success so far but it's
a<00:04:26.700> way<00:04:26.910> to<00:04:26.970> go<00:04:27.210> to<00:04:27.240> get<00:04:27.480> to<00:04:27.660> the<00:04:27.780> to<00:04:28.020> the<00:04:28.140> top<00:04:28.320> and

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 
a way to go to get to the to the top and

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.790 
a way to go to get to the to the top and
that's<00:04:28.890> where<00:04:29.010> I<00:04:29.130> want<00:04:29.310> to<00:04:29.340> be<00:04:29.460> at<00:04:29.520> the<00:04:29.610> top
