actually talking more about human

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:44.069 
actually talking more about human
diseases<00:00:43.239> but<00:00:43.539> is<00:00:43.660> talking<00:00:43.989> about

00:00:44.069 --> 00:00:44.079 
diseases but is talking about

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:47.849 
diseases but is talking about
biodiversity<00:00:45.870> combating<00:00:46.870> disease<00:00:47.109> a<00:00:47.680> heck<00:00:47.829> of

00:00:47.849 --> 00:00:47.859 
biodiversity combating disease a heck of

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:50.580 
biodiversity combating disease a heck of
a<00:00:48.039> lot<00:00:48.160> better<00:00:48.219> and<00:00:48.730> what<00:00:49.239> they<00:00:49.390> used<00:00:49.719> as<00:00:50.050> an

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:50.590 
a lot better and what they used as an

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:52.950 
a lot better and what they used as an
example<00:00:50.980> was<00:00:51.399> an<00:00:51.730> phibian<00:00:52.149> population<00:00:52.780> and

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:52.960 
example was an phibian population and

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.020 
example was an phibian population and
basically<00:00:53.289> what<00:00:53.530> they're<00:00:53.710> saying<00:00:54.010> is<00:00:54.609> the

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:55.030 
basically what they're saying is the

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.720 
basically what they're saying is the
richer<00:00:55.359> the<00:00:55.390> ecosystem<00:00:56.230> is<00:00:56.440> the<00:00:56.890> the<00:00:57.519> less

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:57.730 
richer the ecosystem is the the less

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.779 
richer the ecosystem is the the less
likely<00:00:58.030> it<00:00:58.329> is<00:00:58.570> to<00:00:58.780> spread<00:00:59.739> around<00:00:59.920> diseases

00:01:00.779 --> 00:01:00.789 
likely it is to spread around diseases

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:03.000 
likely it is to spread around diseases
as<00:01:01.059> far<00:01:01.629> as<00:01:01.840> frogs<00:01:02.170> toads<00:01:02.410> and<00:01:02.769> salamanders

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.010 
as far as frogs toads and salamanders

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:05.189 
as far as frogs toads and salamanders
are<00:01:03.789> concerned<00:01:04.210> and<00:01:04.420> in<00:01:04.629> the<00:01:04.750> pond<00:01:04.960> where

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.199 
are concerned and in the pond where

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:07.050 
are concerned and in the pond where
those<00:01:05.350> animals<00:01:05.800> were<00:01:05.980> it<00:01:06.160> was<00:01:06.550> just<00:01:06.910> a

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.060 
those animals were it was just a

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.390 
those animals were it was just a
generally<00:01:07.720> healthier<00:01:08.230> environment<00:01:08.470> they<00:01:09.250> say

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:09.400 
generally healthier environment they say

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.560 
generally healthier environment they say

this study included 345 wetlands and I I
mean<00:01:22.150> that<00:01:22.360> I<00:01:22.390> guess<00:01:22.660> that<00:01:22.840> the<00:01:22.990> basics<00:01:23.530> of<00:01:23.680> the

mean that I guess that the basics of the

story is on the Journal of nature there

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:29.850 
story is on the Journal of nature there
they're<00:01:28.270> talking<00:01:28.450> about<00:01:28.750> how<00:01:29.080> a<00:01:29.110> richer<00:01:29.680> more

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:29.860 
they're talking about how a richer more

they're talking about how a richer more
bio<00:01:30.100> diverse<00:01:30.550> environment<00:01:31.270> can<00:01:31.620> potentially

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
bio diverse environment can potentially

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.060 
bio diverse environment can potentially
combat<00:01:34.780> human<00:01:35.080> diseases<00:01:35.560> but<00:01:35.710> we<00:01:35.830> really

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.070 
combat human diseases but we really

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:37.410 
combat human diseases but we really
don't<00:01:36.190> care<00:01:36.400> about<00:01:36.550> those<00:01:36.880> they<00:01:37.120> talked<00:01:37.330> about

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
don't care about those they talked about

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.150 
don't care about those they talked about
in<00:01:37.690> fib<00:01:37.900> ians<00:01:38.140> and<00:01:38.290> that<00:01:38.380> was<00:01:38.530> awesome<00:01:38.740> and

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:39.160 
in fib ians and that was awesome and

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:40.890 
in fib ians and that was awesome and
those<00:01:39.340> are<00:01:39.460> just<00:01:39.580> some<00:01:39.760> awesome<00:01:40.270> numbers<00:01:40.660> and

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:40.900 
those are just some awesome numbers and

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.600 
those are just some awesome numbers and

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:00.790 
having trouble with one of the software

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:02.220 
having trouble with one of the software
programs<00:02:01.300> i've<00:02:01.450> got<00:02:01.570> a<00:02:01.600> couple<00:02:01.810> of<00:02:02.110> them

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:02.230 
programs i've got a couple of them

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:04.290 
programs i've got a couple of them
actually<00:02:02.440> and<00:02:03.220> i'm<00:02:03.460> having<00:02:03.640> trouble<00:02:03.790> with<00:02:04.120> one

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:04.300 
actually and i'm having trouble with one

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.060 
actually and i'm having trouble with one
so<00:02:04.540> i<00:02:04.570> go<00:02:04.750> to<00:02:04.810> the<00:02:04.900> other<00:02:05.140> one<00:02:05.290> and<00:02:05.680> I<00:02:05.770> figure

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.070 
so i go to the other one and I figure

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:07.350 
so i go to the other one and I figure
well<00:02:06.250> let<00:02:06.400> me<00:02:06.490> see<00:02:06.640> what<00:02:06.760> I<00:02:06.790> can<00:02:06.850> do<00:02:07.090> with<00:02:07.120> this

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
well let me see what I can do with this

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:08.969 
well let me see what I can do with this
and<00:02:07.660> it's<00:02:07.750> not<00:02:07.960> working<00:02:08.200> I<00:02:08.470> just<00:02:08.500> don't<00:02:08.830> like

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
and it's not working I just don't like

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:11.070 
and it's not working I just don't like
it<00:02:09.220> that<00:02:09.250> much<00:02:09.399> so<00:02:10.209> I<00:02:10.239> go<00:02:10.450> back<00:02:10.629> to<00:02:10.690> the<00:02:10.929> other

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
it that much so I go back to the other

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.380 
it that much so I go back to the other
one<00:02:11.349> and<00:02:11.560> I<00:02:11.650> get<00:02:11.830> it<00:02:11.950> all<00:02:12.099> everything<00:02:12.640> smooth

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
one and I get it all everything smooth

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.649 
one and I get it all everything smooth
out<00:02:13.689> working<00:02:14.170> great<00:02:14.469> and<00:02:14.730> I<00:02:15.730> forgot<00:02:16.209> to<00:02:16.269> enter

00:02:16.649 --> 00:02:16.659 
out working great and I forgot to enter

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:18.570 
out working great and I forgot to enter
a<00:02:16.840> weight<00:02:17.109> so<00:02:17.439> I<00:02:17.469> go<00:02:17.680> back<00:02:17.829> and<00:02:18.010> open<00:02:18.250> up

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
a weight so I go back and open up

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.520 
a weight so I go back and open up
the<00:02:18.820> end<00:02:18.970> of<00:02:19.060> the<00:02:19.150> way<00:02:19.300> and<00:02:19.540> the<00:02:19.600> program<00:02:20.230> is

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
the end of the way and the program is

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:21.960 
the end of the way and the program is
messed<00:02:20.740> up<00:02:20.890> again<00:02:21.130> so<00:02:21.310> I<00:02:21.370> started<00:02:21.700> thinking

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
messed up again so I started thinking

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.490 
messed up again so I started thinking
this<00:02:22.000> is<00:02:22.210> ridiculous<00:02:22.810> it's<00:02:22.930> been<00:02:23.170> several

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
this is ridiculous it's been several

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.550 
this is ridiculous it's been several
years<00:02:23.650> since<00:02:24.610> i've<00:02:24.850> purchased<00:02:25.240> any<00:02:26.110> husbandry

years since i've purchased any husbandry

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.380 
years since i've purchased any husbandry

on google are pretty much the digi i

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.100 
on google are pretty much the digi i
think<00:02:42.100> is<00:02:42.280> how<00:02:42.430> you<00:02:42.490> pronounce<00:02:42.820> it<00:02:43.300> I<00:02:43.510> and<00:02:43.780> I

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
think is how you pronounce it I and I

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:45.690 
think is how you pronounce it I and I
mean<00:02:44.590> there's<00:02:44.740> nothing<00:02:44.950> wrong<00:02:45.340> with<00:02:45.400> that

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
mean there's nothing wrong with that

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.310 
mean there's nothing wrong with that
software<00:02:46.210> it's<00:02:46.450> great<00:02:46.660> software<00:02:47.080> I

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:47.320 
software it's great software I

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.860 
software it's great software I
personally<00:02:48.160> just<00:02:48.400> don't<00:02:49.030> I<00:02:49.270> don't<00:02:49.510> like<00:02:49.660> it

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
personally just don't I don't like it

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.990 
personally just don't I don't like it
very<00:02:49.900> much<00:02:50.200> I<00:02:50.650> think<00:02:51.430> it's<00:02:51.550> geared<00:02:51.790> more

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
very much I think it's geared more

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.360 
very much I think it's geared more
towards<00:02:52.390> a<00:02:52.480> breeder<00:02:52.870> environment<00:02:53.740> than<00:02:54.040> it<00:02:54.220> is

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
towards a breeder environment than it is

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.930 
towards a breeder environment than it is
