off with this person who you know is an
asthma<00:02:48.500> but<00:02:49.500> I<00:02:49.560> think<00:02:49.860> the<00:02:49.950> reasoning<00:02:50.400> behind

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
asthma but I think the reasoning behind

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.540 
asthma but I think the reasoning behind
Thea<00:02:51.210> is<00:02:51.480> the<00:02:51.960> fact<00:02:52.140> that<00:02:52.280> this<00:02:53.280> whole<00:02:53.490> time

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
Thea is the fact that this whole time

00:02:53.550 --> 00:03:01.190 
Thea is the fact that this whole time
she's<00:02:58.850> continuously<00:02:59.850> continuously<00:03:00.510> jerkin

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
she's continuously continuously jerkin

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.410 
she's continuously continuously jerkin
so<00:03:02.130> I<00:03:02.160> think<00:03:02.310> that<00:03:02.610> Malcolm<00:03:02.940> is<00:03:03.060> actually<00:03:03.360> the

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
so I think that Malcolm is actually the

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.030 
so I think that Malcolm is actually the
first<00:03:03.570> person<00:03:03.840> in<00:03:04.110> her<00:03:04.200> life<00:03:04.230> that<00:03:04.410> she<00:03:04.680> looked

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
first person in her life that she looked

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.220 
first person in her life that she looked
at<00:03:05.250> and<00:03:05.490> cloud<00:03:06.150> ematic<00:03:06.600> he<00:03:06.750> doesn't<00:03:07.080> trust

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
at and cloud ematic he doesn't trust

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.410 
at and cloud ematic he doesn't trust
because<00:03:07.620> she<00:03:07.800> knows<00:03:08.340> not<00:03:08.610> to<00:03:08.670> and<00:03:09.120> there's<00:03:09.240> no

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
because she knows not to and there's no

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.570 
because she knows not to and there's no
luck<00:03:09.810> down<00:03:10.020> there<00:03:10.080> if<00:03:10.440> anything<00:03:10.680> like<00:03:10.950> he's

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
luck down there if anything like he's

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.490 
luck down there if anything like he's
already<00:03:11.790> let<00:03:12.090> her<00:03:12.240> down<00:03:12.420> so<00:03:12.870> much<00:03:13.170> and<00:03:13.410> she

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
already let her down so much and she

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.020 
already let her down so much and she
there's<00:03:13.890> always<00:03:14.010> been<00:03:14.310> so<00:03:14.520> much<00:03:14.640> letdown<00:03:15.000> to

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
there's always been so much letdown to

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:16.910 
there's always been so much letdown to
the<00:03:15.180> point<00:03:15.360> where<00:03:15.480> if<00:03:16.140> anything<00:03:16.530> you<00:03:16.650> can<00:03:16.800> only

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
the point where if anything you can only

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.680 
the point where if anything you can only
do<00:03:17.250> a<00:03:17.280> little<00:03:17.640> bit<00:03:17.790> maybe<00:03:18.120> there's<00:03:18.420> a<00:03:18.540> little

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
do a little bit maybe there's a little

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.949 
do a little bit maybe there's a little
bit<00:03:18.930> better<00:03:20.030> penalties

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
bit better penalties

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:24.800 
bit better penalties
I<00:03:21.989> think<00:03:22.680> yes<00:03:23.040> I<00:03:23.310> think<00:03:23.340> she<00:03:23.609> trusts<00:03:24.540> not

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
I think yes I think she trusts not

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.199 
I think yes I think she trusts not
trusting<00:03:25.319> them<00:03:25.500> I<00:03:25.829> guess<00:03:26.189> I<00:03:26.400> hope<00:03:26.879> that<00:03:27.030> they

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
trusting them I guess I hope that they

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:29.209 
trusting them I guess I hope that they
accept<00:03:27.239> but<00:03:28.200> it's<00:03:28.409> just<00:03:28.560> I<00:03:28.739> think<00:03:28.799> it's<00:03:29.040> nice

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:29.219 
accept but it's just I think it's nice

00:03:29.219 --> 00:03:32.000 
accept but it's just I think it's nice
for<00:03:29.250> refresher<00:03:29.790> for<00:03:29.939> her<00:03:30.209> did<00:03:30.450> not<00:03:30.739> have<00:03:31.739> room

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
for refresher for her did not have room

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.580 
for refresher for her did not have room
for<00:03:32.069> heart<00:03:32.549> rate<00:03:32.819> and<00:03:33.000> Netflix<00:03:33.480> she<00:03:33.959> she's<00:03:34.439> not

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
for heart rate and Netflix she she's not

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:35.660 
for heart rate and Netflix she she's not
going<00:03:34.769> to<00:03:34.799> get<00:03:34.920> our<00:03:35.010> heart<00:03:35.189> broken<00:03:35.489> from

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
going to get our heart broken from

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:39.110 
going to get our heart broken from
unless<00:03:36.599> he<00:03:36.750> actually

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.150 

Oh
