00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:14.209
 I'm alfredo gil, chef, 

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:16.100
 trust and we are in savings plus you 

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:18.230
 super of the neighborhood we are inside 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:20.359
 our space know how to buy and today 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.759
 let's dedicate ourselves to the anchovy that 

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:24.769
 Blue fish par excellence rich in 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:27.050
 omega 3 that helps us fight the 

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:28.310
 bad cholesterol let's see two things 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.289
 anchovies 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.870
 the first the point of freshness that has 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:34.430
 how to identify it and secondly how 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.559
 ask our fishmonger to us 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.690
 clean to make an elaboration or another 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:42.430
 because it does not save more of our 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.430
 fishmongers clean us anchovies 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:48.940
 very well then if you want to choose me three 

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:48.940
 anchovies and the members you have 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.039
 perfect first index that tells us 

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:56.170
 that this boquerones good the part that 

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:57.940
 is raised that always has to 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.769
 be in our anchovy the second one 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.429
 do not present breaks that do not present 

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:01.570
 cracks 

00:01:00.429 --> 00:01:03.670
 that means that the anchovy is 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:06.220
 whole third as all the fish 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.380
 the bright eyes are outstanding 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:11.259
 that are not sunken and main room 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:14.289
 if you take it a pod that always 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:15.670
 Notice that this tense not bend not 

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:17.380
 covers because that would mean that already 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.689
 it has been stored for a long time and it is 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.580
 decomposing well let's explain to 

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:23.110
 our inhabitants jorge the way 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:24.069
 main to clean our anchovy 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.110
 that we can ask you 

00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:29.259
 perfectly depending on each 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:31.700
 option for us and verify us here 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:34.600
 first of these evils 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:37.270
 to make a fried anchovy 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.729
 we take one each time out gut out 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.080
 and we would have it ready when we go to 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:43.180
 to marry does not need to be cleaned 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.350
 only with an absorbent paper what 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.080
 we could clean but you do not need 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.310
 wash them what we would do would be to take a 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.399
 little bit of flour a little bit of bread 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.930
 grated 70% flour 30% bread crumbs 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:55.060
 mix with a little salt and 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:56.440
 fry or the second way as I say 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.140
 always with wheat flour but from 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:01.570
 strength wheat flour that will give us 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.520
 as a result a crunchy batter 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:06.430
 according to the form once we have 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:09.039
 our other headless and disbelieve pado 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:12.100
 to make the lawyers we removed the 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:15.489
 central spine but never separating the 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:17.110
 loins leaving them whole to see how 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:19.330
 is something that rum with the tail and all 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.319
 and then at home we can save it 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.030
 little bit of oregano 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:24.280
 a little cumin a little bit of 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.170
 paprika a little a lot of 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.489
 vinegar and then if you want a little bit of 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.980
 water and a little saffron for 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:31.000
 lower that phenomenal point and well the 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.890
 third of all 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.569
 to see the headless gut we open 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:40.150
 separating the spine center 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:41.680
 and finally we separated the two loins that 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.780
 it fits this important point to know jorge 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.090
 albÃ¡n him off a little there the 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.379
 thorn that has the salt section that 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.510
 It is unpleasant when chewing 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:51.430
 Well, these anchovies would be 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.219
 ready to make in eye vinegar 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:56.769
 remember the anisakis must be frozen 

00:02:54.219 --> 00:02:59.319
