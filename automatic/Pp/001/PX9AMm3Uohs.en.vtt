00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.280
 in cooperation with the studio ghibli 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:17.080
 known for movies as the walking 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.000
 castle or chihiros travel ins 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:21.160
 The Japanese developer has magical land 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.660
 level 5 probably the best Japanese 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.029
 roleplaying of recent years 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:27.759
 published the speech is from ni no 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:29.710
 kuni in mini takes on the role of 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:31.989
 oliver a little boy from the 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:34.420
 fictional city motor wants one day 

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:36.520
 he woke up by accident that olli 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.739
 vacation mister gp to life 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.629
 oliver tells that one his 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:43.120
 You could just save her mother 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:46.030
 in the so-called no kuni find again 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:48.190
 why the mother who or what is mister 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:50.829
 tricky and what the devil is a ni no 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.879
 kuni yes we can do it all now 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:53.410
 not explain 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:55.390
 We would then be the first 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:57.280
 gameplay of the roleplay complete 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.739
 spoilers and that's exactly what we do not want 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.839
 but what we can tell you 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:04.659
 june means nothing else translated 

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:06.940
 as a parallel world in this you will find 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:08.560
 all characters of the real world again 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.810
 such as the Schmusekatze 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:14.820
 a resident of motor wants in the 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.820
 ni no kuni the king of katzenbuckel 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.080
 the childish presentation of the story 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.970
 market is not everyone's thing 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.040
 sorry but is sweetly told and 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.320
 offers many twist and tragic moments 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.180
 minogue uni is divided like all 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.340
 Japanese role-playing games in different 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.620
 gameplay sequences for one thing we would have 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.540
 since the upperworld here you run around finds 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:46.000
 new places and hide and fight against 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:47.770
 bad monster to another we have there 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.840
 the right areas for example here 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.119
 In Katzenbuckel we can get new items 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.490
 buy or found sale 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:56.860
 accept alternative orders or even 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.390
 just walk around in something 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.430
 other areas such as here 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:03.220
 This gloomy forest will be especially 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:05.350
 fought the fighting in june in 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.180
 Real time from you try so hostile 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.190
 Avoid attacks and share yours 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:11.470
 accurately punches opponents fast 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.000
 to be ostracized after and 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.800
 after you learn new attacks and 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.080
 powerful spells you fight 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.970
 You can also use it in the 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.980
 run the game so-called companions 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.019
 to fight for these but you want to 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.510
 also be cherished and cared for 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:27.070
 example with sweets so a lollipop 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.690
 in the morning distributes well known 

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:30.820
 grief and worry and lets the little one 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.780
 kautz also without problems so thick post 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.880
 Defeat opponents 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.980
 the idea with the fellows reminds 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.550
 in places to the tennis pokÃ©mons 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.040
 series 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:40.750
 just a pity a proper bond 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.580
 You do not build up the little subjects 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:45.450
 they stay very pale and develop 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.450
 hardly further 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.720
 which is especially enthusiastic about nino kun 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:22.519
 the great look and the hand-drawn 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.269
 between sequences directly from the studio 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:25.280
 ghibli com 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:27.500
 the synchronization is great as well 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:29.870
 and full of humor and amateur word play 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.500
 especially mister gp is a real one here 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.690
 highlight 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.849
 too bad only a lot of dialogues are not 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:35.690
 set to music and only we subtitles 

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:37.549
 displayed 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:39.680
 Also, the game has just in the second 

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:41.540
 half the length of the ni no kuni 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.409
 in our opinion unnecessary in the 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.569
 drive length 

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:46.129
 fortunately, the story builds to the end 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:49.700
 right back up and undress 

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:51.769
 nico is never everything in the world 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.989
 in all a classic game that thanks to his 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:55.700
 sweet story of his great looks and 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:57.650
 the motivating person is fighting a lot 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:59.989
 fun and many days to the 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:01.879
 console will captivate the colorful 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:04.069
 However, setting does not suit everyone 

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:04.819
 say and one or the other even 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:06.829
 Sign in 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:08.840
 but who are on the magic world of ni 

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:10.699
 no kuni lets in on one 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:14.500
 beautiful and exciting adventure 

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:14.500
 in the magical world of parallelism 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:19.810
