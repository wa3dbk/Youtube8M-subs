00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.810
 At this year's zlf, John Deere has 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:19.270
 the new 6 m series presented 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:22.960
 We wanted to know what the maker can do 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:28.150
 and have the 6 125 m with front loader and 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:30.189
 the 6 170 m tested the 6 m series triggers 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:32.619
 the 60 30 standard tractors with 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:35.350
 average equipment from 120 ps 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:37.720
 From a total of six tractors carry 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:41.530
 now the m in the lettering the number of 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:43.750
 six stands for the rated power, the 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:49.269
 Chassis sizes and hoods are with shape 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:52.629
 the motors of the r-series are identical 

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:55.690
 until the 61 40 m is the four-cylinder 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:56.409
 powertech bv ix with 4.5 liter displacement 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.400
 installed 

00:00:56.409 --> 00:01:01.320
 from the 51 60 m the six-cylinder with 6 8 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.640
 liter displacement 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.210
 There are two models with four 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.860
 cylinders in the chassis of the six-cylinder 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.869
 john deere wants the thriftiness of the 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:14.520
 smaller engines with high power and 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:14.520
 driving comfort of the big connect 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.329
 The six post cabin is from 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.100
 largely from the previous model 

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:32.689
 The survey is good and you will find 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.969
 very quickly on the tractor to 

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:37.640
 quite the arrangement of the controls 

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:39.259
 it was hardly changed, but there is one 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.030
 new display in the dashboard 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:42.380
 here is also one of them 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.649
 power monitor with 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:47.420
 Fuel consumption indicator integrated 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:48.259
 Unfortunately, there is only the indication of liter 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.420
 per hour 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:52.509
 bitter projects would be for optimization 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.069
 was a better value for the work 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:58.780
 the whole thing is served via four buttons 

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:58.780
 on the right edge of the dashboard 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:08.799
 while in the following pictures to 61 

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:10.849
 70 m see some words to the gearbox 

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:13.760
 There are three at the gearbox 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:16.130
 equipment options paraquat plus 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:19.220
 with a maximum of six transitions and much load 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:21.310
 step automat plus with four trucks 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:25.099
 stages and automatic switching function 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:26.720
 and autocrat + co that's like autocrat 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:30.200
 plus however with reduced 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.790
 engine speed at 40 km / h our two 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.950
 test tractor drive with the eco 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.690
 gear equipped the load 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.190
 Switching operations are soft and also the 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.850
 Automatic switches to the right one 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.340
 time 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.720
 the knob for the automatic 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.549
 attitude is a bit hidden 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.190
 right on the console 

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:49.090
 but the service is simply in progress 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:51.950
 the shift lever is very far to the right 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.959
 the hydraulic system in the four-cylinder 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.340
 models pumps with a gear pump 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:57.829
 80 liters per minute 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:00.410
 new is the pressure compensation in the 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:02.389
 mechanical control valves calls 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:04.359
 valve he drops a lot of pressure at the 

00:03:02.389 --> 00:03:06.859
 still not off the other valve 

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:08.299
 Optionally there are the pressure and quantities 

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:11.480
 compensated equipment of the two 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:15.310
 big models load sensing with 114 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.310
 liter per minute even for the little ones 

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:20.930
 in terms of driving comfort must be the 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:23.000
 small and the big 6 m with the 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:25.610
 optional sprung front axle not 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.320
 hide on a spring-loaded cabin 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:29.240
 the driver has to do without 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:30.980
 but that only turns on bad ones 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.660
 because of strong and strong blows 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.400
 noticeable 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:37.280
 john deere offers for the 6 series 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.810
 the power for the brake on the servo brake 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.760
 Took us on the road bike 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:44.830
 trailer convinces you can join 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.830
 study very little effort very well 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:50.810
 our conclusion just the simple one 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:52.940
 Equipment makes the tractor 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:54.800
 Attractive companies do not pay attention 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:57.290
 technical sophistication in all details 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:59.300
 The overview is good overall 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:00.379
 For front loader work is the hood 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:02.900
 but very big 

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:04.910
 with the served concept one finds oneself 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.799
 Fast cope the power monitor 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:09.739
 is easy to read but could do even more 

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:11.900
 consumption data line the price of the 6 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:13.790
 m models vary depending on the equipment 

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:16.549
 eight to ten percent below that of the 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:18.139
 respective model the whole 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:22.450
 driving report read now in the 

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:22.450
