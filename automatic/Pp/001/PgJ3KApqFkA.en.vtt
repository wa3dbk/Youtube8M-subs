 research tractor 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.620
 the institute 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:16.199
 solves an important problem taking part 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.310
 in creating reliable machines for complex 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.460
 natural conditions 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.439
 as soon as possible sometimes 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.330
 complaints get under farmers 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.849
 machine builders for poor quality 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.890
 technology 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:31.529
 new models to be in charge 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.930
 tests for this are designed 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.910
 special cameras artificial 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.890

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:41.930
 tractor answers to test questions 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.930
 will take numerous sensors 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:10.760
 for cars that will for example 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:13.130
 work in the far north climatic 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:16.270
 the kitchen will cook the weather with temperature 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.270
 minus 50 degrees 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:24.400
 from here the arctic will be delivered to 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.400
 climate chamber 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:39.990
 tests began the volume of exams sets 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.990
 from the operator control panel 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:48.650
 frost is 45 degrees as it will affect 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:52.220
 endurance performance 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:53.180
 durability of the machine on and and longevity all 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:59.560
 it turns out 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:02:02.990
 during the test special attention 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.760
 start-up reliability of the engine because it 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.460
 today on tractors working in 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:10.520
 Arctic three or four times worse than in 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:13.840
 normal operation test should 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:15.940
 solve the problem the best warm up 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.830

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:21.610
 natural north on the authenticity of such 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.420
 exam takes five years is 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.380
 artificial arctic 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.380
 1 season 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:34.980
 and now the temperature is + 60 and 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:39.310
 one hundred percent humidity

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:55.050
 sensors are now growing 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.800
 information about factors that 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:59.360
 characteristic of the tropics will appear fat 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.650

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:05.370
 determines the resistance of the machine against

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:10.140
 research is designed to be constructive

 technological safety margin of a tractor 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.480

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:43.959
 new test technique 

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:46.959
 effectively works on saving and
