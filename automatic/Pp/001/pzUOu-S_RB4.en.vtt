there's<00:00:15.660> to<00:00:15.750> be<00:00:15.809> a<00:00:15.870> pretty<00:00:16.500> interesting

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
there's to be a pretty interesting

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.380 
there's to be a pretty interesting
matchup<00:00:18.439> and<00:00:19.439> one<00:00:19.619> guy<00:00:19.800> who<00:00:19.859> comes<00:00:20.189> out<00:00:20.400> really

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
matchup and one guy who comes out really

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.590 
matchup and one guy who comes out really
strong<00:00:21.449> as<00:00:22.080> Pau<00:00:22.380> Gasol<00:00:22.949> and<00:00:23.420> maybe<00:00:24.420> it's

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
strong as Pau Gasol and maybe it's

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.359 
strong as Pau Gasol and maybe it's
because<00:00:24.720> that<00:00:25.019> power<00:00:25.199> forest<00:00:25.769> isn't<00:00:26.099> playing

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
because that power forest isn't playing

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.730 
because that power forest isn't playing
great<00:00:26.609> defense<00:00:27.029> but<00:00:27.960> if<00:00:28.230> you<00:00:28.349> soften<00:00:28.560> that

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
great defense but if you soften that

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.890 
great defense but if you soften that
last<00:00:28.980> game<00:00:29.189> that<00:00:29.460> last<00:00:30.090> crew<00:00:30.330> game<00:00:30.570> you

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
last game that last crew game you

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.020 
last game that last crew game you
stepped<00:00:31.230> up<00:00:31.349> big<00:00:31.590> for<00:00:31.859> us<00:00:31.920> and<00:00:32.759> once<00:00:32.940> again

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
he's continuing to step up but the

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.450 
he's continuing to step up but the
second<00:00:37.230> chance<00:00:37.380> points<00:00:37.800> aren't<00:00:38.070> helping<00:00:38.399> I

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
second chance points aren't helping I

00:06:38.879 --> 00:06:38.889 
which which really worked out all right

00:06:38.889 --> 00:06:41.909 
which which really worked out all right
because<00:06:39.810> we<00:06:40.810> found<00:06:41.020> our<00:06:41.169> teammates<00:06:41.620> who<00:06:41.800> were

00:06:41.909 --> 00:06:41.919 
because we found our teammates who were

00:06:41.919 --> 00:06:43.770 
because we found our teammates who were
being<00:06:42.099> poorly<00:06:42.460> guarded<00:06:42.759> by<00:06:43.120> this<00:06:43.270> defense<00:06:43.630> and

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:43.780 
being poorly guarded by this defense and

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:45.930 
being poorly guarded by this defense and
right<00:06:43.990> there<00:06:44.289> if<00:06:44.500> you<00:06:44.650> see<00:06:44.800> that<00:06:44.949> spin<00:06:45.430> move<00:06:45.460> up

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:45.940 
right there if you see that spin move up

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:50.400 
right there if you see that spin move up
just<00:06:47.130> destroying<00:06:48.130> their<00:06:48.520> confidence<00:06:49.240> and<00:06:49.479> so

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:50.410 
just destroying their confidence and so

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:52.260 
just destroying their confidence and so
we<00:06:50.530> find<00:06:50.770> a<00:06:50.889> nice<00:06:51.070> little<00:06:51.280> elbow<00:06:51.639> jumper<00:06:52.120> and

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:52.270 
we find a nice little elbow jumper and

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:53.850 
we find a nice little elbow jumper and

step<00:06:59.860> spin<00:07:00.190> move<00:07:00.430> which<00:07:00.610> rarely<00:07:01.000> worked<00:07:01.449> it's

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:01.810 
step spin move which rarely worked it's

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:04.560 
step spin move which rarely worked it's
usually<00:07:02.130> charge<00:07:03.130> or<00:07:03.430> afoul<00:07:03.699> of<00:07:03.970> some<00:07:04.030> time<00:07:04.389> but

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:04.570 
usually charge or afoul of some time but

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:07.140 
usually charge or afoul of some time but
he<00:07:04.690> finishes<00:07:05.229> and<00:07:05.470> that's<00:07:06.460> the<00:07:06.669> game<00:07:06.820> you<00:07:06.880> can

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:07.150
