00:00:02.679 --> 00:00:09.170
 good evening welcome to that portal 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:10.910
 a little late of unusual hours but 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:12.200
 here we are gladly after the 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:14.840
 first quarterfinal match of the 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:17.390
 mx drink of the drinks analyzing by 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:19.010
 course in January died cristian bringas 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.439
 an amateur will come to football 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:24.289
 Querétaro back home waiting for them 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:27.289
 his parents his grandparents stabbed him 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:29.150
 a truncheon of the querétaro died today efrén 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:30.420
 gutiérrez a night watchman who came up with 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.580
 to be 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.790
 in the vicinity of the stadium of gratitude 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:39.080
 Careful in his work he found 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:42.390
 a ball of wild barbajanes 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:43.470
 delinquents who go to football that 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.180
 they were fighting between them and what 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:48.580
 they killed today this man has died 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.980
 the soccer phase says still does not happen 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:52.750
 nothing with the section federation cap 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:56.770
 nothing happened and now let us know 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:58.960
 your rolls your safety committee and the 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:01.720
 credentialing I have here the data 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:04.300
 of the credentialing are also worth 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:06.310
 is the solution the credentialing in 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:08.740
 angela we go not good first good 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:11.229
 a greeting to people do not stop them 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:13.300
 you have is unfortunate I think that 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:14.590
 definitely but something has to be 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.610
 do the program have to think about 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:20.710
 something if today they decided presence of the 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.979
 they defended that outside the stadium it does not pass 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:22.979
 nothing 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.690
 we are talking about 10 to 15 kilometers 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.840
 out on highway what happens to 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:33.840
 Guadalajara 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.390
 that was at the stadium that you do not know and 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.610
 those who do not know and those who are going to 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.950
 keep going while the federation does not 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:47.200
 understand that something has to be done and the 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.299
 credentialing is the solution 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.890
 I do not think it's a form of action 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:52.810
 be silly and will not accept reality 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.610
 no tougher things than reality 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.850
 that he has to live football I insist 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:59.560
 the violence has already overtaken football 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.729
 there has to come someone of a higher rank 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.510
 strong at the social level to bring order 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:08.399
 jairo 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:12.489
 [Laughs] 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:15.670
 the belief evidently that does not work 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:18.160
 for nothing is a cancer theme you take a 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:20.319
 analgesic then does not have does not have 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.690
 greater sense flames has already been lived not 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:24.760
 has worked then we are giving you the 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.440
 back to the 98 post that they do not have 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.870
 record before the single phrase in the 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.220
 credentialing football on 9 and are 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.410
 18 are half 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:37.400
 that would bring good environments the solution 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:39.980
 is that if not, if it could be 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.600
 the solution while the process is being followed 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.570
 it has to be to credentialize 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.310
 the people first that between technology 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:49.940
 that we have mentioned so much throughout 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.350
 two weeks where if there's going to be a 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.390
 follow up to each of the 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:55.460
 members of the batons will have to 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.290
 have a follow up when you 

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:58.910
 behave more inside the stadium like this 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.040
 entry nothing else is not the eyes seen 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:02.990
 latinos you what do you think hello good 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.730
 nights should be part of the solution 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:07.130
 but here we have even seen that no 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.330
 it serves for nothing and that even the bars 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:10.070
 or members of some bars are 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:13.160
 take advantage of these credentials to 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:15.050
 sell them and do more business still the 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.430
 that already they are doing there 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:19.280
 many others to do not only 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:21.290
 take their fingerprint and photo rafa rafa to 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.480
 another dead in football another dead 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.520
 product of trouble among the barristas 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.820
 from cheerleaders to teams of 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.820
 football 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:47.620
 [Applause] 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:51.010
 and now I am a wealthy but good gerardo 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:55.480
 look what we have said it is very clear that 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:58.450
 the dead do not move or managers 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:04:00.610
 neither officials nor authorities do not 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:02.770
 deaths that occur in the context of 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:06.580
 soccer in soccer scenes are not 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:08.470
 enough for someone to assume from 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:10.840
 football itself or from itself 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:12.880
 authority or jointly with 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.980
 seriousness this topic that I have left 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:17.200
 absolutely clear the question that you 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:19.780
 do you find me very interesting very 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:22.450
 timely I am very much in agreement with what 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:25.420
 They speak saying what you say also 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:27.970
 gustavo I think what can be the 

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:31.270
 start of a good security measure 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:34.420
 It has already become very exceeded 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:37.270
 in something too mocked I think what 

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:41.230
 what is needed is to have a census have 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:43.810
 a directory of those that are grouped 

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:48.220
 to the bars or to the truncheons or to the groups 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:50.770
 of animation to have very clear data 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:53.500
 data really that they can in some 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:57.880
 moment although it sounds of a structure 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:59.770
 very police to have available to 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:02.620
 who have to apply justice to 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:05.950
 this type of element sounds like an issue 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:09.280
 of the Soviet states of Germany 

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:11.710
 oriental but otherwise it's not going to 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:13.840
 to be able to stop this you have to deactivate it in 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:16.240
 first instance the bars and conste and 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:19.330
 I finish I think we are the first 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:21.640
 conscious in saying that it is not the only 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:24.850
 source of violence in football 

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:27.550
 Mexican but it is the most important if 

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:29.290
 is the most constant if it is the one that has 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:31.510
 branches too much more 

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:33.370
 dangerous but we have also talked 

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:35.320
 here of many types of violence that 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:36.880
 We are in good stadiums will 

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:38.440
 talk about this much more than it has 

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:41.470
 happened today on the court of 

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:43.240
 golden ones where the mx cup started 

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:45.430
 to live and their quarterfinals tomorrow 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:48.310
 there will be three games all live to 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:52.390
 through sports the anna scandal 

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:54.340
 swimming tarrés 

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:56.140
 synchronized in Spain that wants it 

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:58.120
 bring Kiril Todorov to Mexico 

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:59.680
 president of the swimming passion in 

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:02.280
 end and many more things we want 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:02.280
 talking 

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:05.820
 pilot 

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:10.120
