00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:28.750

like any other person would do knowing

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.980 
like any other person would do knowing
me<00:01:32.830> then<00:01:33.070> that<00:01:33.430> was<00:01:33.550> like<00:01:33.580> well<00:01:33.880> I<00:01:34.210> guess<00:01:34.750> we're

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:34.990 
me then that was like well I guess we're

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.700 
me then that was like well I guess we're
gonna<00:01:35.080> go<00:01:35.320> with<00:01:35.500> it

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710 
gonna go with it

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.330 
gonna go with it
yeah<00:01:36.690> now<00:01:37.690> you<00:01:37.750> now<00:01:38.410> you<00:01:38.440> realize<00:01:38.770> he<00:01:39.009> made<00:01:39.190> the

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
yeah now you now you realize he made the

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.150 
yeah now you now you realize he made the
right<00:01:39.490> decision<00:01:40.000> I<00:01:40.149> guess<00:01:40.210> so<00:01:40.780> ok

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:42.160
