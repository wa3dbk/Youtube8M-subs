explain<00:00:12.080> what<00:00:12.770> is<00:00:12.920> chromatic<00:00:13.610> dispersion<00:00:13.910> so

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:14.719 
explain what is chromatic dispersion so

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:18.070 
explain what is chromatic dispersion so
let's<00:00:14.959> get<00:00:15.110> started<00:00:15.590> so<00:00:16.240> what<00:00:17.240> exactly<00:00:17.450> is

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:18.080 
let's get started so what exactly is

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.710 
let's get started so what exactly is
chromatic<00:00:18.800> dispersion<00:00:19.210> let's<00:00:20.210> take<00:00:20.420> a<00:00:20.449> look

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:20.720 
chromatic dispersion let's take a look

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.370

delay<00:00:44.750> is<00:00:44.990> called<00:00:45.350> chromatic<00:00:46.250> dispersion

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:46.960 
delay is called chromatic dispersion

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.560 
delay is called chromatic dispersion
here<00:00:48.040> chromatic<00:00:49.040> stresses<00:00:49.850> the<00:00:50.000> fact<00:00:50.270> that

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:50.570 
here chromatic stresses the fact that

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.110 
here chromatic stresses the fact that
the<00:00:51.230> time<00:00:51.440> delay<00:00:51.830> depend<00:00:52.460> on<00:00:52.700> the<00:00:52.880> color

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120 
the time delay depend on the color

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.000 
the time delay depend on the color
difference<00:00:53.630> or<00:00:53.840> wavelength<00:00:54.650> difference

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
difference or wavelength difference

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.770 
difference or wavelength difference
between<00:00:55.730> the<00:00:55.820> lights<00:00:57.430> so<00:00:58.430> what<00:00:58.700> effect<00:00:58.910> does

00:00:59.770 --> 00:00:59.780 
between the lights so what effect does

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:01.360 
between the lights so what effect does
chromatic<00:01:00.380> dispersion<00:01:00.620> have<00:01:01.100> and

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.370 
chromatic dispersion have and

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.229 
chromatic dispersion have and
fiber-optic<00:01:02.330> communication<00:01:02.900> systems<00:01:03.380> the

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:04.239 
fiber-optic communication systems the

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.179 
fiber-optic communication systems the
direct<00:01:05.239> effect<00:01:05.659> is<00:01:05.869> light<00:01:06.259> pulse<00:01:06.710> broadening

00:01:07.179 --> 00:01:07.189 
direct effect is light pulse broadening

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:10.570 
direct effect is light pulse broadening
a<00:01:08.049> perfect<00:01:09.049> light<00:01:09.320> pulse<00:01:09.619> starts<00:01:10.340> at<00:01:10.490> the

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:10.580 
a perfect light pulse starts at the

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.660 
a perfect light pulse starts at the
beginning<00:01:11.000> after<00:01:11.990> it<00:01:12.410> travels<00:01:12.920> a<00:01:13.040> length<00:01:13.460> of

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 
beginning after it travels a length of

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.000 
beginning after it travels a length of
fiber<00:01:13.880> may<00:01:14.600> it<00:01:14.750> be<00:01:14.900> a<00:01:14.930> hundred<00:01:15.440> meters<00:01:15.770> or

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:16.010 
fiber may it be a hundred meters or

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.090 
fiber may it be a hundred meters or
2,000<00:01:16.940> meters<00:01:17.300> the<00:01:17.990> light<00:01:18.170> pulse<00:01:18.500> becomes

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
2,000 meters the light pulse becomes

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.210 
2,000 meters the light pulse becomes
wider<00:01:19.550> than<00:01:20.150> the<00:01:20.330> original<00:01:20.810> signal<00:01:21.159> this<00:01:22.159> is

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:22.220 
wider than the original signal this is

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.210 
wider than the original signal this is
caused<00:01:22.670> by<00:01:23.090> chromatic<00:01:23.659> dispersion<00:01:24.220> because

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.220 
caused by chromatic dispersion because

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.790 
caused by chromatic dispersion because
in<00:01:25.400> the<00:01:25.490> same<00:01:25.700> pulse<00:01:25.940> the<00:01:26.780> blue<00:01:26.990> light<00:01:27.200> travels

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:27.800 
in the same pulse the blue light travels

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.010 
in the same pulse the blue light travels
faster<00:01:28.310> and<00:01:28.520> the<00:01:28.880> red<00:01:29.030> light<00:01:29.240> travels<00:01:29.690> slower

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
faster and the red light travels slower

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.830 
faster and the red light travels slower
so<00:01:30.890> the<00:01:31.100> total<00:01:31.430> width<00:01:31.610> of<00:01:31.820> the<00:01:32.030> pulse<00:01:32.210> gets

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
so the total width of the pulse gets

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.890 
so the total width of the pulse gets
stretched<00:01:33.290> wider<00:01:34.150> now<00:01:35.150> let's<00:01:35.420> look<00:01:35.630> at<00:01:35.750> the

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:35.900 
stretched wider now let's look at the

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.890 
stretched wider now let's look at the
bottom<00:01:36.080> part<00:01:36.500> of<00:01:36.620> the<00:01:36.800> picture<00:01:37.150> too<00:01:38.150> perfect

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:38.900 
bottom part of the picture too perfect

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.560 
bottom part of the picture too perfect
signals<00:01:39.350> start<00:01:39.800> at<00:01:40.040> the<00:01:40.130> beginning<00:01:40.550> but<00:01:41.330> at

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 
signals start at the beginning but at

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:42.070 
signals start at the beginning but at
the<00:01:41.690> end

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.080 
the end

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.830 
the end
since<00:01:42.530> both<00:01:42.740> pulses<00:01:43.310> get<00:01:43.820> wider<00:01:44.120> because<00:01:44.540> of

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
since both pulses get wider because of

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.440 
since both pulses get wider because of
chromatic<00:01:45.140> dispersion<00:01:45.640> they<00:01:46.640> get<00:01:46.880> overlapped

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
chromatic dispersion they get overlapped

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.590 
chromatic dispersion they get overlapped
to<00:01:47.900> each<00:01:48.050> other<00:01:48.290> if<00:01:48.560> the<00:01:49.520> overlap<00:01:49.909> is<00:01:50.120> too<00:01:50.330> big

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
to each other if the overlap is too big

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.899 
to each other if the overlap is too big
the<00:01:51.350> detector<00:01:51.920> may<00:01:52.190> not<00:01:52.370> be<00:01:52.580> able<00:01:52.729> to

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:52.909 
the detector may not be able to

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:55.960 
the detector may not be able to
recognize<00:01:53.720> these<00:01:54.140> two<00:01:54.440> signals<00:01:54.890> and<00:01:55.100> you<00:01:55.760> get

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:55.970 
recognize these two signals and you get

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:59.200 
recognize these two signals and you get
an<00:01:56.090> error<00:01:56.770> so<00:01:57.770> chromatic<00:01:58.340> dispersion<00:01:58.580> causes

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
an error so chromatic dispersion causes

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.580 
an error so chromatic dispersion causes
pulse<00:01:59.630> broadening<00:01:59.900> and<00:02:00.409> bit<00:02:00.950> error<00:02:02.590> chromatic

pulse broadening and bit error chromatic
dispersion<00:02:03.799> is<00:02:04.250> actually<00:02:04.760> the<00:02:04.940> sum<00:02:05.180> of<00:02:05.330> two

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:05.630 
dispersion is actually the sum of two

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.529 
dispersion is actually the sum of two
different<00:02:06.049> dispersion<00:02:06.770> types<00:02:07.360> the<00:02:08.360> first

type is called material dispersion this

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:14.350 
type is called material dispersion this
is<00:02:11.780> because<00:02:12.170> that<00:02:12.920> the<00:02:13.190> refractive<00:02:13.819> index<00:02:13.849> of
