00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:09.030
 happened to me is real this story begins 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.759
 in calais france with a boy called 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.400
 Sebastian of 13 years old was a 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.830
 new in the city ​​was a lonely child 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.869
 since his parents moved around 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.260
 europe because of their jobs 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.180
 munich roma birmingham and budapest were 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.029
 some of the places where that 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.279
 mysterious child he lived was born in 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.740
 Paris since his mother was French and 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.710
 his Italian father he and I were 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.989
 school mates I was never the most 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.000
 popular of the lounge that's why I sat 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.910
 alone and most of my friends the 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.190
 I met playing pokemon most of the 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.770
 guys in our room had win boys 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.410
 and they played pokemon always at breaks 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.989
 battles of coaches were made 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.149
 pokémon but sebastien did not have a 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.539
 gameboy that made the other guys 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.070
 they mocked and that's why they hit him 

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:02.190
 Past time Sebastian could 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.080
 buy your gameboy with red pokemon 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.150
 he was new to the game and he only had 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.970
 Four rat is a itch and vulva 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.100
 saur the next morning he faced 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.229
 for the first time to the guys and how 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.180
 they saw that their level of pokemon will be so 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.350
 low they defeated him easily and what 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.960
 they hit again 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.850
 I wanted to help him but when I put my hand 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.220
 on his shoulder on the sacrum in one pull and 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.680
 she went crying to her house daily 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.080
 next he appeared with a smile on his 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.210
 face when facing those guys in the 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.369
 front of the pokemon size these 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.159
 boys were surprised to see that 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:38.850
 he had a lacquer so level 100 a half 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:41.009
 who of level 75 a hymn level 87 a 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.789
 90 level mini tails and veins to a 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:46.920
 level 82 beat everyone in the battle what 

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:49.350
 curious was that he had done it only 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.330
 using the kazan wing I expectant and 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.190
 surprised I congratulated him but the 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.830
 answer that I got from him was a 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:57.929
 look empty and cold the other guys that 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.990
 they had lost what they hit again 

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:03.210
 but this time with more fury and violence 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:06.179
 I just looked at my also used to hit me 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.399
 and I did not want to get in, I went quickly to 

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:10.799
 my house and I kept listening to them 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:13.170
 and they hit him but not the screams that 

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:15.959
 you always gave Sebastian when they did 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.629
 the next day to get to school I saw 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:20.939
 to Sebastian's parents shouting at 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:23.310
 director with tears in his eyes and 

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:25.470
 parents of the boys were sitting 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.019
 watching looking worried 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.120
 I assumed the worst when I got to the lounge 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:32.189
 there were six empty seats the one in 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.439
 Sebastian and that of the guys that 

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:36.569
 hit when the teacher came in we 

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:38.849
 delivered the black bows that are worn 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:41.040
 when one is in mourning the teacher 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:43.829
 had said that the six had died 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.989
 guys Sebastian had died for a 

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:48.090
 internal bleeding in the lungs but 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:50.459
 the other children had the brain 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:53.129
 destroyed nobody knows why he had them 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:55.709
 happened that but I now know the cause 

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:57.720
 later when leaving school there was 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:59.579
 found the gameboy of sebastien 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.010
 shattered but there was only 

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:03.810
 survived the pokemon cartridge what 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.849
 I took my house and I tried it with my 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.040
 gameboy and when I saw the pokemon I 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:10.799
 I was surprised to see that they were hunting 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.480
 the name of sebastien and there was 5 gasol and 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:14.940
 with the names of the dead boys 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:17.670
 I spent them and they did not have 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:20.010
 always but they were sad and not 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:22.710
 they had pupils and wing kazan had a 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.870
 huge smile that deformed his face 

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:27.570
 I gave him importance and continue with the 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.580
 game the funny thing was that he had not left 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:31.950
 of the palette people there was not even 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.840
 come to green city I went to town 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:37.470
 green and check all your pokemon 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:39.720
 incredible the 14 boxes all completed 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:42.470
 the legendary and all at their maximum 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:45.660
 level and evolved that he had done 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:47.940
 I had never seen such a thing I looked at his 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:50.400
 been his coach was sometimes called 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.800
 which in Spanish means death had 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.930
 all the medals and one that I had not 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.970
 seen was never a star with the 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:59.190
 red edges and filled with black at 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:01.350
 select it said here you dance it 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:03.410
 guin is born de l'infern which means 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:05.970
 won in the gym of hell 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:08.460
 scared I wanted to get out of the game but at 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:10.710
 leaving the coach state appeared 

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:12.750
 in a very dark place in it he only 

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:15.420
 I noticed my coach and Giovanni 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:18.209
 clan leader rocket automatically gets 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:21.060
 approached me and tells me that he wants to leave 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:23.430
 so soon if you have not started playing 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:25.440
 the battlefield was opened only 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.600
 was available for my choice to the 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.060
 hunt in the rest of the pokemon in their 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:32.790
 state said dead instead of common 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:34.980
 weakened giovanni used a pokémon 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:37.380
 that he had never seen his name 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:40.169
 mister dead which was just a silhouette 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:42.389
 black without any remarkable shape I supposed 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:45.419
 that he should fight and beat him to be able to 

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:47.030
 exit the game select fight to the 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:49.710
 hunting did not have a single movement 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:52.080
 revenge I was forced to use it 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:54.660
 a message appeared to the hunt only 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:56.610
 he obeys Sebastian's orders as he could 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:59.550
 know who was occupying the gameboy 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:02.040
 the game was automatic no matter 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:04.650
 who is manipulating it appeared another 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:07.200
 message mister dead has now used end 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:09.300
 the terrifying thing was that it was not released 

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:11.160
 about my pokemon but about me 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:13.440
 coach heard a scream 

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:16.440
 heartbreaking of a human and the screen 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:18.450
 it went dark about 15 seconds later 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:21.210
 the battlefield reappeared 

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:23.460
 but only the kazan wing remained where 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:25.470
 should the coach be noticed 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:26.940
 a lot of very realistic blood for 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:29.250
 games of the time 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:31.380
 a kazan died he reappeared a 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:34.140
 message the human idiocy led to my 

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:36.360
 death you have not done anything to prevent it 

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:38.730
 in my room I saw a shadow with the 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:40.590
 way of a boy and a very strange like 

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:43.170
 the one of a pokemon with two spoons 

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:46.650
 appeared another message would you cheer up 

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:49.260
 flip my face for the last time 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:52.560
 Sebastian shouted very loud and closed my 

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:55.650
 eyes repeating incessantly go away 

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:57.890
 I did not want this the next day my 

00:05:55.650 --> 00:06:00.600
 parents locked me in a monastery 

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:02.580
 religious thinking that I had been 

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:05.100
 playing the sheep to talk to the 

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:07.560
 spirit of sebastien I never saw 

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:09.420
 my parents never again when I fulfilled the 

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:11.430
 came of age 

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:13.650
 monastery by my will when 

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:15.660
 I returned to my house it was 

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:18.270
 uninhabited and everything was like night 

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:20.640
 that they left me in the monastery I got to 

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:23.100
 my room and I found my gameboy and the 

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:25.410
 cartridge thrown in a corner those that 

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:27.960
 I left my house and went to a new 

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:29.700
 cybercafé to tell you this if 

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:32.130
 you believe me or not is your problem 

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:33.300
 I just wanted to let you know so that 

00:06:32.130 --> 00:06:35.490
 sebastien 

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:36.419
 they do not torment me 

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:39.470
 dreams 

00:06:36.419 --> 00:06:39.470
 I just want to forget
