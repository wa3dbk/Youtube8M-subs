00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
encoding or something so let's try this

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.330 
encoding or something so let's try this
again<00:00:14.750> this<00:00:15.750> is<00:00:15.990> not<00:00:16.020> a<00:00:16.590> zombie<00:00:16.830> torture

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
giant device thing so I already have

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.990 
giant device thing so I already have
endermen<00:00:25.439> separators<00:00:25.980> you<00:00:26.250> can<00:00:26.430> look<00:00:26.670> at<00:00:26.789> mine

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
endermen separators you can look at mine

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.550 
endermen separators you can look at mine
or<00:00:27.269> you<00:00:27.359> can<00:00:27.480> look<00:00:27.599> at<00:00:27.720> Automator<00:00:28.140> em<00:00:28.289> season

off links in the description we already

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:31.999 
off links in the description we already
have<00:00:30.510> spider<00:00:30.810> separators<00:00:31.380> I<00:00:31.590> don't<00:00:31.740> think<00:00:31.949> you

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
have spider separators I don't think you

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.410 
have spider separators I don't think you
need<00:00:32.160> to<00:00:32.189> link<00:00:32.430> because<00:00:32.759> there's<00:00:32.940> so<00:00:33.059> many<00:00:33.180> out

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
need to link because there's so many out

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.740 
need to link because there's so many out
there<00:00:33.450> but<00:00:33.899> I'll<00:00:34.110> put<00:00:34.320> one<00:00:34.350> up<00:00:34.559> anyway<00:00:34.890> um<00:00:35.790> we

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
there but I'll put one up anyway um we

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.619 
there but I'll put one up anyway um we
have<00:00:37.140> zombie<00:00:37.800> separators<00:00:38.309> if<00:00:38.460> you<00:00:38.550> saw<00:00:38.760> my<00:00:39.030> new

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
have zombie separators if you saw my new

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.690 
have zombie separators if you saw my new
zombie<00:00:40.140> behavior<00:00:40.680> I'm<00:00:41.250> going<00:00:41.430> to<00:00:41.489> turn<00:00:41.670> down

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
zombie behavior I'm going to turn down

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.610 
zombie behavior I'm going to turn down
the<00:00:42.030> salmon<00:00:42.719> this<00:00:42.899> because<00:00:43.079> it's<00:00:43.200> allowed<00:00:43.379> for

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
the salmon this because it's allowed for

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.430 
the salmon this because it's allowed for
me<00:00:43.820> if<00:00:44.820> you<00:00:44.969> saw<00:00:45.120> my<00:00:45.270> new<00:00:45.450> zombie<00:00:45.870> behavior

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
me if you saw my new zombie behavior

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.090 
me if you saw my new zombie behavior
video<00:00:47.270> zombies<00:00:48.270> can't<00:00:48.570> swim<00:00:48.899> anymore<00:00:49.140> so

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
video zombies can't swim anymore so

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.189 
video zombies can't swim anymore so
hopefully<00:00:50.910> that<00:00:51.239> stays<00:00:51.510> and<00:00:51.750> it<00:00:51.870> makes<00:00:52.020> sense

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
hopefully that stays and it makes sense

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.600 
hopefully that stays and it makes sense
because<00:00:52.440> you<00:00:52.739> know<00:00:52.829> like<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.129> movies<00:00:53.430> and

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
because you know like the movies and

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.549 
because you know like the movies and
stuff<00:00:53.789> zombies<00:00:54.390> are<00:00:54.510> both<00:00:54.629> too<00:00:54.899> slow<00:00:55.230> and

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
stuff zombies are both too slow and

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.150 
stuff zombies are both too slow and
stupid<00:00:55.980> to<00:00:56.879> be<00:00:57.329> able<00:00:57.480> to<00:00:57.539> swim<00:00:57.750> so<00:00:58.649> the<00:00:58.980> last

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
stupid to be able to swim so the last

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.490 
stupid to be able to swim so the last
thing<00:00:59.309> when<00:00:59.520> you<00:00:59.579> do<00:00:59.789> is<00:01:00.180> skeletons<00:01:01.140> and

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
thing when you do is skeletons and

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.490 
thing when you do is skeletons and
creepers<00:01:02.010> so<00:01:02.930> the<00:01:03.930> biggest<00:01:04.080> problem<00:01:04.409> with

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
creepers so the biggest problem with

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.030 
creepers so the biggest problem with
this<00:01:04.589> is<00:01:04.830> I<00:01:05.280> wanted<00:01:05.820> to<00:01:06.450> have<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:07.350> snow<00:01:07.650> golems

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
this is I wanted to have the snow golems

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.550 
this is I wanted to have the snow golems
sort<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:09.030> mobs<00:01:09.420> so<00:01:09.810> I<00:01:09.840> wouldn't<00:01:10.260> have<00:01:10.290> to<00:01:10.409> go

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
sort the mobs so I wouldn't have to go

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
sort the mobs so I wouldn't have to go
AFK<00:01:11.369> somewhere<00:01:12.360> you<00:01:12.659> know<00:01:12.979> and<00:01:13.979> just<00:01:14.010> you<00:01:14.460> know

leave it run I would prefer to be able

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.249 
leave it run I would prefer to be able
to<00:01:17.159> be<00:01:17.369> off<00:01:17.490> doing<00:01:17.700> other<00:01:17.909> things<00:01:18.080> and<00:01:19.080> then

come back and hey all my moms are sorted

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.390 
come back and hey all my moms are sorted
the<00:01:22.140> biggest<00:01:22.409> problem<00:01:22.619> with<00:01:22.710> that<00:01:22.830> is<00:01:23.040> snow

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
the biggest problem with that is snow

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.399 
the biggest problem with that is snow
golems<00:01:23.729> only<00:01:24.090> shoot<00:01:24.420> skeletons<00:01:25.020> if<00:01:25.290> the

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
golems only shoot skeletons if the

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:26.660 
golems only shoot skeletons if the
skeletons<00:01:25.830> in<00:01:25.950> a<00:01:26.009> position<00:01:26.250> where<00:01:26.430> I<00:01:26.549> can

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
skeletons in a position where I can

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.999 
skeletons in a position where I can
shoot<00:01:26.880> back<00:01:27.240> and<00:01:27.570> that<00:01:28.170> means<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.590> skeleton

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
shoot back and that means the skeleton

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.130 
shoot back and that means the skeleton
will<00:01:29.280> kill<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.909> snow<00:01:30.119> golem<00:01:30.450> which<00:01:30.720> you<00:01:31.020> know

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
will kill the snow golem which you know

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.740 
will kill the snow golem which you know
ruins<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.619> whole<00:01:31.650> thing<00:01:32.130> so<00:01:32.850> for<00:01:33.390> a<00:01:33.420> chart<00:01:33.689> for

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
ruins the whole thing so for a chart for

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.270 
ruins the whole thing so for a chart for
the<00:01:33.840> longest<00:01:34.079> time<00:01:34.200> to<00:01:34.409> find<00:01:34.590> positions<00:01:34.740> where

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
the longest time to find positions where

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.620 
the longest time to find positions where
the<00:01:35.340> snow<00:01:35.520> golems<00:01:35.880> would<00:01:36.119> be<00:01:36.240> able<00:01:36.390> to<00:01:36.450> hit<00:01:36.540> the

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
the snow golems would be able to hit the

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.210 
the snow golems would be able to hit the
skeletons<00:01:37.110> and<00:01:37.290> skeletons<00:01:37.710> would<00:01:37.860> not<00:01:38.009> be<00:01:38.159> at

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
skeletons and skeletons would not be at

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.460 
skeletons and skeletons would not be at
the<00:01:38.430> snow<00:01:38.579> golems<00:01:38.909> and<00:01:39.140> eventually<00:01:40.140> realize

the snow golems and eventually realize

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:41.840 
the snow golems and eventually realize
I'm<00:01:40.619> going<00:01:40.829> about<00:01:40.950> this<00:01:41.070> all<00:01:41.220> wrong<00:01:41.280> way<00:01:41.670> I

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
will happen very rarely and it's

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.800 
will happen very rarely and it's
actually<00:02:41.550> nice<00:02:41.880> to<00:02:41.940> happen<00:02:42.360> in<00:02:42.420> this<00:02:42.510> video

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
actually nice to happen in this video

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.530 
actually nice to happen in this video
because<00:02:43.380> I<00:02:43.800> wanted<00:02:44.640> me<00:02:44.730> to<00:02:44.850> talk<00:02:45.000> about<00:02:45.030> it<00:02:45.420> is

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
because I wanted me to talk about it is

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.420 
because I wanted me to talk about it is
that<00:02:45.870> a<00:02:46.080> skeleton<00:02:46.500> will<00:02:46.650> come<00:02:46.830> up<00:02:46.980> here<00:02:47.310> and

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
that a skeleton will come up here and

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.060 
that a skeleton will come up here and
he'll<00:02:47.940> shoot<00:02:48.300> but<00:02:48.840> he'll<00:02:48.990> only<00:02:49.200> shoot<00:02:49.650> if<00:02:49.860> he's

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
he'll shoot but he'll only shoot if he's

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.850 
he'll shoot but he'll only shoot if he's
able<00:02:50.310> to<00:02:50.430> see<00:02:50.790> the<00:02:51.600> snow<00:02:52.140> golem<00:02:52.500> and<00:02:52.709> he'll

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
able to see the snow golem and he'll

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.620 
able to see the snow golem and he'll
only<00:02:53.040> start<00:02:53.459> tracking<00:02:53.940> off<00:02:54.060> to<00:02:54.180> the<00:02:54.270> right<00:02:54.420> if

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
only start tracking off to the right if

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.820 
only start tracking off to the right if
he<00:02:54.810> shoots<00:02:55.020> so<00:02:56.300> that<00:02:57.300> means<00:02:57.750> that<00:02:58.050> if<00:02:58.500> that's

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
he shoots so that means that if that's

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.199 
he shoots so that means that if that's
why<00:02:59.070> I<00:02:59.100> had<00:02:59.190> this<00:02:59.280> little<00:02:59.490> teeny<00:02:59.700> tiny<00:02:59.970> gap

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
why I had this little teeny tiny gap

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:01.910 
why I had this little teeny tiny gap
here<00:03:00.450> in<00:03:00.750> an<00:03:00.840> attempt<00:03:01.290> to<00:03:01.320> prevent<00:03:01.680> them<00:03:01.890> from

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
here in an attempt to prevent them from

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.500 
here in an attempt to prevent them from
the<00:03:02.130> other<00:03:02.250> shoot<00:03:02.430> the<00:03:02.520> snow<00:03:02.670> golems<00:03:02.970> but<00:03:03.240> rare

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
the other shoot the snow golems but rare

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.900 
the other shoot the snow golems but rare
very<00:03:04.020> rarely<00:03:04.380> he<00:03:05.070> actually<00:03:05.280> will<00:03:05.610> hit<00:03:05.820> the

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
very rarely he actually will hit the

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.180 
very rarely he actually will hit the
snow<00:03:06.060> golem<00:03:06.270> and<00:03:06.390> kill<00:03:06.570> him<00:03:06.770> and<00:03:07.770> then<00:03:07.860> any

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
snow golem and kill him and then any

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.060 
snow golem and kill him and then any
other<00:03:09.170> mob<00:03:10.170> that's<00:03:10.530> coming<00:03:10.830> through<00:03:10.860> the

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
other mob that's coming through the

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:13.280 
other mob that's coming through the
system<00:03:11.280> that<00:03:11.459> was<00:03:11.670> mad<00:03:12.090> at<00:03:12.450> the<00:03:12.660> snow<00:03:13.020> Ellen

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
system that was mad at the snow Ellen

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.230 
system that was mad at the snow Ellen
that<00:03:13.440> just<00:03:13.620> died<00:03:13.800> once<00:03:14.490> he<00:03:14.610> gets<00:03:14.790> up<00:03:14.880> here<00:03:15.060> that

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:15.240 
that just died once he gets up here that

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:18.440 
that just died once he gets up here that
mob<00:03:15.450> will<00:03:15.600> just<00:03:15.780> stop<00:03:15.990> moving<00:03:16.320> um<00:03:17.220> so<00:03:18.060> that's

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
mob will just stop moving um so that's

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.330 
mob will just stop moving um so that's
bad<00:03:18.750> because<00:03:18.989> as<00:03:19.260> you<00:03:19.380> saw<00:03:19.590> skeletons<00:03:20.220> will

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
bad because as you saw skeletons will

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.220 
bad because as you saw skeletons will
stop<00:03:20.550> moving<00:03:20.910> and<00:03:21.000> just<00:03:21.239> you<00:03:21.390> know<00:03:21.420> getting

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
stop moving and just you know getting

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:23.660 
stop moving and just you know getting
each<00:03:22.380> other's<00:03:22.650> way<00:03:22.860> and<00:03:23.160> get<00:03:23.310> mad<00:03:23.459> at<00:03:23.580> the

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
each other's way and get mad at the

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.580 
each other's way and get mad at the
other<00:03:23.700> skeletons<00:03:24.180> a<00:03:24.360> creeper<00:03:24.780> might<00:03:25.320> stop

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
other skeletons a creeper might stop

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.050 
other skeletons a creeper might stop
moving<00:03:25.950> and<00:03:25.980> they're<00:03:26.160> shot<00:03:26.400> by<00:03:26.550> skelton<00:03:27.000> and

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
moving and they're shot by skelton and

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.750 
moving and they're shot by skelton and
blow<00:03:27.269> up<00:03:27.300> my<00:03:27.540> system<00:03:27.989> just<00:03:28.530> bad<00:03:28.769> things<00:03:29.190> so

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
blow up my system just bad things so

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:30.920 
blow up my system just bad things so
there's<00:03:30.030> still<00:03:30.120> some<00:03:30.360> tweaking<00:03:30.660> that<00:03:30.750> needs

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
there's still some tweaking that needs

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.040 
there's still some tweaking that needs
to<00:03:31.050> happen<00:03:31.080> here<00:03:31.650> I<00:03:32.400> think<00:03:32.910> what<00:03:33.030> I<00:03:33.060> can<00:03:33.390> do<00:03:33.720> is

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.050 
to happen here I think what I can do is

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:36.680 
to happen here I think what I can do is
I<00:03:34.620> there's<00:03:35.459> something<00:03:35.910> I<00:03:36.269> don't<00:03:36.510> know<00:03:36.570> what

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
I there's something I don't know what

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:37.850 
I there's something I don't know what
it's<00:03:36.780> called<00:03:36.840> but<00:03:37.200> there's<00:03:37.470> a<00:03:37.530> device<00:03:37.830> that

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
it's called but there's a device that

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:39.259 
it's called but there's a device that
they<00:03:38.100> that<00:03:38.190> I<00:03:38.250> saw<00:03:38.489> recently<00:03:38.850> where<00:03:39.090> you<00:03:39.180> can

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 
they that I saw recently where you can

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:42.710 
they that I saw recently where you can
have<00:03:39.420> a<00:03:39.450> glass<00:03:39.660> block<00:03:40.110> and<00:03:40.320> a<00:03:40.380> piston<00:03:41.720> moving

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
have a glass block and a piston moving

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.590 
have a glass block and a piston moving
up<00:03:42.840> and<00:03:42.930> down<00:03:43.050> on<00:03:43.410> half<00:03:43.860> tix<00:03:44.310> such<00:03:45.209> that<00:03:45.450> the

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
up and down on half tix such that the

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.020 
up and down on half tix such that the
game<00:03:45.870> thinks<00:03:46.650> that<00:03:46.769> the<00:03:46.860> glass<00:03:47.160> block<00:03:47.519> is<00:03:47.760> both

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
game thinks that the glass block is both

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.620 
game thinks that the glass block is both
there<00:03:48.480> and<00:03:48.750> not<00:03:49.140> there<00:03:49.340> so<00:03:50.340> not<00:03:50.850> there<00:03:51.180> will

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
there and not there so not there will

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:54.500 
there and not there so not there will
allow<00:03:51.870> the<00:03:52.380> skeleton<00:03:53.010> to<00:03:53.489> think<00:03:53.970> that<00:03:54.180> it<00:03:54.300> sees

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 
allow the skeleton to think that it sees

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.380 
allow the skeleton to think that it sees
the<00:03:55.130> snow<00:03:56.130> golem<00:03:56.459> and<00:03:56.580> start<00:03:56.820> tracking<00:03:57.269> and

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
the snow golem and start tracking and

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.690 
the snow golem and start tracking and
shooting<00:03:57.750> and<00:03:57.989> when<00:03:58.140> it<00:03:58.230> shoots<00:03:58.500> it'll<00:03:59.310> hit

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
shooting and when it shoots it'll hit

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.240 
shooting and when it shoots it'll hit
the<00:03:59.970> glass<00:04:00.180> block<00:04:00.660> that<00:04:01.230> is<00:04:01.410> both<00:04:01.680> they're<00:04:01.980> not

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
the glass block that is both they're not

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:03.770 
the glass block that is both they're not
there<00:04:02.459> because<00:04:02.610> it's<00:04:02.880> moving<00:04:03.180> up<00:04:03.300> and<00:04:03.390> down<00:04:03.510> so

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
there because it's moving up and down so

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:09.160 
there because it's moving up and down so
quickly<00:04:04.160> um<00:04:05.510> the<00:04:06.510> other<00:04:06.540> thing<00:04:06.750> is<00:04:07.190> this<00:04:08.190> here

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:09.170 
quickly um the other thing is this here

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:12.620 
quickly um the other thing is this here
zombie<00:04:10.170> will<00:04:10.920> despawn<00:04:11.459> if<00:04:11.790> I<00:04:11.880> go<00:04:12.030> too<00:04:12.120> far<00:04:12.480> away

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.630 
zombie will despawn if I go too far away

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:14.810 
zombie will despawn if I go too far away
and<00:04:13.049> then<00:04:13.590> so<00:04:13.799> these<00:04:13.920> snow<00:04:14.190> golems<00:04:14.549> will<00:04:14.640> stop

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:14.820 
and then so these snow golems will stop

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:16.159 
and then so these snow golems will stop
shooting<00:04:15.180> at<00:04:15.299> them<00:04:15.390> and<00:04:15.660> that's<00:04:15.900> a<00:04:15.989> pretty

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
shooting at them and that's a pretty

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:18.110 
shooting at them and that's a pretty
easy<00:04:16.350> fix<00:04:16.709> you<00:04:16.950> know<00:04:17.070> you<00:04:17.130> just<00:04:17.370> gotta<00:04:17.549> have<00:04:18.090> a

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
easy fix you know you just gotta have a

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.550 
easy fix you know you just gotta have a
pressure<00:04:18.450> plate<00:04:18.630> there<00:04:18.900> to<00:04:18.930> detective<00:04:19.470> ed

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
pressure plate there to detective ed

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.979 
pressure plate there to detective ed
spawns<00:04:19.979> and<00:04:20.220> if<00:04:20.310> he<00:04:20.400> does<00:04:20.640> just<00:04:21.419> you<00:04:21.660> know<00:04:21.690> have

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
spawns and if he does just you know have

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:24.020 
spawns and if he does just you know have
a<00:04:22.020> little<00:04:22.200> reservoir<00:04:22.860> of<00:04:23.250> zombies<00:04:23.640> somewhere

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
a little reservoir of zombies somewhere

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.600 
a little reservoir of zombies somewhere
pipe<00:04:24.300> a<00:04:24.419> min<00:04:24.600> drop<00:04:24.930> a<00:04:24.960> new<00:04:25.380> one<00:04:25.590> and<00:04:26.280> call<00:04:26.520> it

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
pipe a min drop a new one and call it

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:27.410 
pipe a min drop a new one and call it
good<00:04:26.669> you<00:04:27.180> all

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:27.420 
good you all

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:29.510 
good you all
so<00:04:27.540> if<00:04:27.810> there's<00:04:28.020> any<00:04:28.140> mobs<00:04:28.560> in<00:04:28.920> the<00:04:29.160> system

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
so if there's any mobs in the system

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.760 
so if there's any mobs in the system
when<00:04:29.700> that<00:04:29.850> happens<00:04:30.270> just<00:04:30.900> have<00:04:31.140> a<00:04:31.170> little<00:04:31.350> you

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
when that happens just have a little you

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:36.290 
when that happens just have a little you
know<00:04:31.890> a<00:04:33.290> switch<00:04:34.290> here<00:04:34.710> where<00:04:35.250> the<00:04:35.340> ma<00:04:35.610> the<00:04:36.000> mobs

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
know a switch here where the ma the mobs

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:37.430 
know a switch here where the ma the mobs
will<00:04:36.450> no<00:04:36.600> longer<00:04:36.630> go<00:04:36.930> off<00:04:37.050> to<00:04:37.170> the<00:04:37.200> right

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 
will no longer go off to the right

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:38.420 
will no longer go off to the right
they'll<00:04:37.590> go<00:04:37.680> off<00:04:37.710> to<00:04:37.890> the<00:04:37.920> left<00:04:38.160> and<00:04:38.310> get

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430 
they'll go off to the left and get

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.340 
they'll go off to the left and get
killed<00:04:38.640> or<00:04:38.850> go<00:04:39.270> back<00:04:39.480> into<00:04:39.720> the<00:04:39.810> system<00:04:40.080> or

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:40.350 
killed or go back into the system or

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:42.620 
killed or go back into the system or
something<00:04:40.530> and<00:04:40.860> then<00:04:41.460> mobs<00:04:41.670> won't<00:04:42.120> get<00:04:42.390> piped

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:42.630 
something and then mobs won't get piped

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:44.390 
something and then mobs won't get piped
in<00:04:42.810> here<00:04:43.050> until<00:04:43.200> a<00:04:43.350> new<00:04:43.530> zombie<00:04:43.920> is<00:04:44.130> on<00:04:44.310> the

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 
in here until a new zombie is on the

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.710 
in here until a new zombie is on the
pressure<00:04:44.580> plate<00:04:46.010> yeah<00:04:47.010> so<00:04:47.550> this<00:04:48.240> is<00:04:48.450> you<00:04:48.570> know

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 
pressure plate yeah so this is you know

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.390 
pressure plate yeah so this is you know
we're<00:04:48.900> almost<00:04:49.110> got<00:04:49.530> an<00:04:49.650> entire<00:04:49.890> system<00:04:50.310> to

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 
we're almost got an entire system to

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.300 
we're almost got an entire system to
sort<00:04:50.640> out<00:04:50.730> every<00:04:51.120> single<00:04:51.300> mob<00:04:52.070> it's<00:04:53.070> pretty

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:53.310 
sort out every single mob it's pretty

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:55.880 
sort out every single mob it's pretty
cool<00:04:53.600> the<00:04:54.600> other<00:04:55.080> issue<00:04:55.260> with<00:04:55.500> this<00:04:55.590> is<00:04:55.770> it

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:55.890 
cool the other issue with this is it

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:58.280 
cool the other issue with this is it
can't<00:04:56.100> handle<00:04:56.400> too<00:04:56.670> many<00:04:56.850> mobs<00:04:57.060> at<00:04:57.300> once<00:04:57.540> but

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:58.290 
can't handle too many mobs at once but

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:00.140 
can't handle too many mobs at once but
that's<00:04:58.500> easy<00:04:59.070> to<00:04:59.310> handle<00:04:59.610> you<00:04:59.730> can<00:04:59.790> just<00:05:00.000> have

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150 
that's easy to handle you can just have

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.540 
that's easy to handle you can just have
