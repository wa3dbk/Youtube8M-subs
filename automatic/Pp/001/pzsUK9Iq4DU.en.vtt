they're still kind of bad at anyway the
heavy<00:02:04.820> fuzz<00:02:05.150> the<00:02:05.180> strange<00:02:05.750> vocals<00:02:06.380> on<00:02:06.620> that

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:07.160 
heavy fuzz the strange vocals on that

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:08.859 
heavy fuzz the strange vocals on that
track<00:02:07.460> too<00:02:07.730> which<00:02:07.910> sort<00:02:08.179> of<00:02:08.239> took<00:02:08.509> me<00:02:08.720> by

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
track too which sort of took me by

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:11.290 
track too which sort of took me by
surprise<00:02:09.220> really<00:02:10.220> made<00:02:10.399> it<00:02:10.519> feel<00:02:10.670> like<00:02:10.729> a<00:02:10.970> very

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
surprise really made it feel like a very

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.599 
surprise really made it feel like a very
surreal<00:02:11.870> experience<00:02:12.189> throughout<00:02:13.189> these<00:02:13.340> nine

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:13.609 
surreal experience throughout these nine

00:02:13.609 --> 00:02:15.250 
surreal experience throughout these nine
tracks<00:02:13.879> there<00:02:14.180> are<00:02:14.269> several<00:02:14.599> moments<00:02:15.109> where<00:02:15.200> I

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
tracks there are several moments where I

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:16.590 
tracks there are several moments where I
found<00:02:15.530> myself<00:02:15.680> sitting<00:02:16.069> there<00:02:16.340> just

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
found myself sitting there just

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.390 
found myself sitting there just
thinking<00:02:16.840> wow<00:02:17.290> these<00:02:17.560> guys<00:02:17.770> could<00:02:18.010> seriously

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
thinking wow these guys could seriously

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.330 
thinking wow these guys could seriously
still<00:02:19.000> pen<00:02:19.870> a<00:02:20.200> tune<00:02:20.500> they<00:02:20.680> could<00:02:20.800> still<00:02:21.010> pump

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
still pen a tune they could still pump

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.700 
still pen a tune they could still pump
out<00:02:21.550> a<00:02:21.850> memorable<00:02:22.780> riff<00:02:23.050> it's<00:02:23.290> just<00:02:23.500> nice<00:02:23.680> to

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:23.710 
out a memorable riff it's just nice to

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:26.340 
out a memorable riff it's just nice to
know<00:02:23.920> that<00:02:24.040> after<00:02:24.480> years<00:02:25.480> and<00:02:25.660> years<00:02:25.720> of<00:02:26.110> The

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
know that after years and years of The

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:29.790 
know that after years and years of The
Melvins<00:02:26.560> just<00:02:27.360> punishing<00:02:28.360> our<00:02:28.810> auditory

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
Melvins just punishing our auditory

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.410 
Melvins just punishing our auditory
senses<00:02:30.340> that<00:02:30.460> they<00:02:30.580> could<00:02:30.730> still<00:02:30.910> put<00:02:31.120> a<00:02:31.150> good

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
senses that they could still put a good

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.690 
senses that they could still put a good
dent<00:02:31.810> in<00:02:31.900> the<00:02:32.020> old<00:02:32.170> eardrum<00:02:33.070> the<00:02:33.340> one<00:02:33.490> thing<00:02:33.640> I

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
dent in the old eardrum the one thing I

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.370 
dent in the old eardrum the one thing I
didn't<00:02:33.940> really<00:02:34.150> enjoy<00:02:34.270> about<00:02:34.690> the<00:02:34.900> album<00:02:35.230> is

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
didn't really enjoy about the album is

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.490 
didn't really enjoy about the album is
that<00:02:35.410> there<00:02:35.650> was<00:02:35.740> a<00:02:35.800> real<00:02:35.980> pervasive

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
that there was a real pervasive

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.540 
that there was a real pervasive
ridiculousness<00:02:38.500> on<00:02:38.710> a<00:02:38.740> lot<00:02:38.980> of<00:02:39.130> the<00:02:39.220> tracks

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550 
ridiculousness on a lot of the tracks

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:41.750 
ridiculousness on a lot of the tracks
especially<00:02:40.270> on<00:02:40.420> these<00:02:40.600> really<00:02:41.320> noisy

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
especially on these really noisy

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.250 
especially on these really noisy
transitional<00:02:42.760> moments<00:02:43.180> at<00:02:43.300> the<00:02:43.330> end<00:02:43.600> of<00:02:44.050> some

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
transitional moments at the end of some

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:45.570 
transitional moments at the end of some
of<00:02:44.290> the<00:02:44.440> songs<00:02:44.740> where<00:02:45.100> you<00:02:45.190> hear<00:02:45.370> some

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
of the songs where you hear some

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.670 
of the songs where you hear some
squelching<00:02:46.180> horns<00:02:46.720> some<00:02:47.320> really<00:02:47.560> weird

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
squelching horns some really weird

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.730 
squelching horns some really weird
keyboard<00:02:48.430> or<00:02:48.730> some<00:02:49.030> freaky<00:02:49.780> vocals

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:50.740 
keyboard or some freaky vocals

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:52.470 
keyboard or some freaky vocals
it<00:02:50.890> just<00:02:51.130> makes<00:02:51.310> me<00:02:51.490> think<00:02:51.520> The<00:02:51.850> Melvins<00:02:52.120> are

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
it just makes me think The Melvins are

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.060 
it just makes me think The Melvins are
trying<00:02:52.720> to<00:02:52.840> get<00:02:52.990> away<00:02:53.080> from<00:02:53.230> their<00:02:53.530> old<00:02:53.680> sound

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070 
trying to get away from their old sound

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:55.980 
trying to get away from their old sound
trying<00:02:54.430> to<00:02:54.550> redefine<00:02:54.910> themselves<00:02:55.300> as<00:02:55.660> a<00:02:55.750> band

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:55.990 
trying to redefine themselves as a band

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:57.930 
trying to redefine themselves as a band
they<00:02:56.110> don't<00:02:56.260> really<00:02:56.410> want<00:02:56.740> to<00:02:56.830> do<00:02:57.520> the<00:02:57.700> same

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
they don't really want to do the same

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.600 
they don't really want to do the same
thing<00:02:58.270> over<00:02:58.570> and<00:02:58.840> over<00:02:59.410> and<00:02:59.620> over<00:02:59.890> but<00:03:00.310> instead

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
thing over and over and over but instead

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.120 
thing over and over and over but instead
of<00:03:01.090> innovating<00:03:01.780> instead<00:03:02.110> of<00:03:02.230> just<00:03:02.470> pursuing<00:03:02.920> a

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
of innovating instead of just pursuing a

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:05.490 
of innovating instead of just pursuing a
new<00:03:03.370> altogether<00:03:04.090> different<00:03:04.630> sound<00:03:05.230> they're

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
new altogether different sound they're

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.100 
new altogether different sound they're
just<00:03:05.680> trying<00:03:05.950> to<00:03:06.010> use<00:03:06.540> absurdity<00:03:07.540> to<00:03:07.690> kind<00:03:07.990> of

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110 
just trying to use absurdity to kind of

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:11.310 
just trying to use absurdity to kind of
drift<00:03:08.500> themselves<00:03:09.220> away<00:03:09.550> from<00:03:09.930> their<00:03:10.930> older

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.320 
drift themselves away from their older

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.580 
drift themselves away from their older
style<00:03:11.770> and<00:03:12.160> it's<00:03:12.970> not<00:03:13.240> exactly<00:03:13.780> functioning

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
style and it's not exactly functioning

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.560 
style and it's not exactly functioning
that<00:03:15.010> well<00:03:15.310> for<00:03:15.640> me<00:03:15.790> there<00:03:16.090> are<00:03:16.210> some<00:03:16.450> moments

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:16.570 
that well for me there are some moments

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:18.780 
that well for me there are some moments
where<00:03:16.900> this<00:03:16.990> absurdity<00:03:17.470> kind<00:03:17.920> of<00:03:18.010> drifts<00:03:18.490> into

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
where this absurdity kind of drifts into

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.170 
where this absurdity kind of drifts into
some<00:03:19.420> of<00:03:19.510> the<00:03:19.570> tracks<00:03:19.900> on<00:03:20.320> the<00:03:20.920> LP<00:03:21.370> for<00:03:21.730> example

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
some of the tracks on the LP for example

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:23.880 
some of the tracks on the LP for example
the<00:03:22.270> first<00:03:22.510> song<00:03:22.750> the<00:03:22.930> water<00:03:23.170> glass<00:03:23.530> just

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:23.890 
the first song the water glass just

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:25.500 
the first song the water glass just
starts<00:03:24.160> off<00:03:24.310> with<00:03:24.460> really<00:03:24.790> pummeling<00:03:25.240> drums

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
starts off with really pummeling drums

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.630 
starts off with really pummeling drums
really<00:03:25.720> heavy<00:03:26.050> riffs<00:03:26.350> really<00:03:26.680> got<00:03:26.920> me<00:03:27.190> excited

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 
really heavy riffs really got me excited

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.310 
really heavy riffs really got me excited
but<00:03:28.270> then<00:03:28.390> it<00:03:28.510> kind<00:03:28.660> of<00:03:28.690> broke<00:03:28.930> into<00:03:29.200> this

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:29.320 
but then it kind of broke into this

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.950 
but then it kind of broke into this
militaristic<00:03:29.950> Colin<00:03:30.790> respond<00:03:31.330> routine<00:03:31.810> that

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:31.960 
militaristic Colin respond routine that

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:34.290 
militaristic Colin respond routine that
really<00:03:32.290> was<00:03:32.470> not<00:03:32.710> working<00:03:33.070> for<00:03:33.280> me<00:03:33.550> at<00:03:33.670> all<00:03:34.000> but

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:34.300 
really was not working for me at all but

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:36.030 
really was not working for me at all but
I<00:03:34.330> think<00:03:34.570> the<00:03:34.690> most<00:03:34.810> tongue-in-cheek<00:03:35.350> moment

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
I think the most tongue-in-cheek moment

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.270 
I think the most tongue-in-cheek moment
of<00:03:36.160> the<00:03:36.280> entire<00:03:36.400> album<00:03:37.030> is<00:03:37.690> yes<00:03:38.560> there's<00:03:39.160> a

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
of the entire album is yes there's a

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.990 
of the entire album is yes there's a
cover<00:03:39.730> on<00:03:40.060> this<00:03:40.900> LP<00:03:41.320> of<00:03:41.530> the<00:03:41.800> who's<00:03:42.040> my

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
cover on this LP of the who's my

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.150 
cover on this LP of the who's my
generation<00:03:43.810> the<00:03:44.050> vocals<00:03:44.470> are<00:03:44.620> really<00:03:44.920> weird

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160 
generation the vocals are really weird

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.160 
generation the vocals are really weird
the<00:03:45.430> song<00:03:45.670> is<00:03:45.880> done<00:03:46.030> in<00:03:46.210> a<00:03:46.300> really<00:03:46.450> sludgy

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.170 
the song is done in a really sludgy

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:50.910 
the song is done in a really sludgy
fashion<00:03:47.920> and<00:03:48.210> it<00:03:49.210> just<00:03:49.510> feels<00:03:49.870> a<00:03:50.170> little<00:03:50.530> like

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 
fashion and it just feels a little like

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.070 
fashion and it just feels a little like
novelty<00:03:51.790> it<00:03:52.030> just<00:03:52.210> feels<00:03:52.420> like<00:03:52.540> a<00:03:52.600> little<00:03:52.930> bit
