00:00:00.839 --> 00:00:03.839
 It is pta unification first appearance here 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:07.060
 Once every three months 

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:10.240
 Ayumu's cup semifinals about overwintering mobile 

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:14.729
 Bright 

00:00:14.729 --> 00:00:17.619
 I feel like I can 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:20.619
 5 I do not want to 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.570
 It is a processor that has a pet cpu now 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.520
 Is in the form of completion 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.170
 It's the same big sport, separately operable cpu heat sink 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.650
 Kimura Mine 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:42.650
 9 days 10 days if purchased 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.330
 Though it is thermal conductivity 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:48.920
 One member of the Diet is here already 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.320
 We assume prefecture 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:51.750
 Conductor of heat 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.430
 It follows 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.160
 As it is 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.860
 From now on 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:00.250
 1. Once done 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.250
 To the lyrics that spa preparation is complete 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:07.690
 Connect on Mach is better 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.510
 Put on the power source 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.510
 Yes, in high school 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.300
 Two nails are going out 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.290
 Like this 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.130
 Just 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.910
 What is a pair 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:35.910
 Report like old days 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.340
 It is a civil servant with a minus driver 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.800
 Hard to hit the same hit 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.780
 It is a special attack music 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.460
 Take through 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.840
 Insert into trachea without even disappearing 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.670
 Both feet 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.670
 I'm leaving here 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.520
 Kato is right 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.959
 both 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:11.959
 I confirmed that it was stuck 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:25.739
 The answer is the form of the environment 

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:32.459
 Yeah 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:35.990
 Though cpu cooler process cherry is 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:37.459
 mother's 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:38.889
 I agree 

00:02:38.889 --> 00:02:41.659
 In these places 

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:44.659
 CPU 

00:02:51.999 --> 00:02:54.999
 Because there is a disaster 

00:02:56.649 --> 00:03:00.099
 Just insert it again and the ditch is dug 

00:03:02.839 --> 00:03:03.819
 It is ready
