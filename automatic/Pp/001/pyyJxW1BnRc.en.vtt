actually when firing from the hip my
middle<00:01:54.840> tree<00:01:55.170> of<00:01:55.290> perks<00:01:55.530> I<00:01:55.770> use<00:01:55.979> extended<00:01:56.460> mag

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
middle tree of perks I use extended mag

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.429 
middle tree of perks I use extended mag
a<00:01:56.820> larger<00:01:57.240> magazine<00:01:57.659> as<00:01:57.840> a<00:01:57.899> fill<00:01:58.200> as<00:01:58.320> if

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
a larger magazine as a fill as if

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.170 
a larger magazine as a fill as if
perfect<00:01:58.829> balance<00:01:58.979> doesn't<00:01:59.790> actually<00:01:59.909> make<00:02:00.119> a

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
perfect balance doesn't actually make a

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.760 
perfect balance doesn't actually make a
big<00:02:00.479> difference<00:02:00.689> on<00:02:00.960> this<00:02:01.049> weapon<00:02:01.259> even

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
big difference on this weapon even

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.230 
big difference on this weapon even
though<00:02:01.860> when<00:02:02.040> you<00:02:02.130> actually<00:02:02.250> put<00:02:02.520> it<00:02:02.610> on<00:02:02.729> the

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
though when you actually put it on the

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.630 
though when you actually put it on the
stability<00:02:03.450> goes<00:02:03.930> up<00:02:04.140> quite<00:02:04.619> a<00:02:04.649> lot<00:02:04.920> but<00:02:05.130> I<00:02:05.310> feel

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
stability goes up quite a lot but I feel

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.039 
stability goes up quite a lot but I feel
as<00:02:05.759> if<00:02:05.790> you<00:02:06.030> don't<00:02:06.240> really<00:02:06.390> need<00:02:06.600> it<00:02:06.750> with<00:02:06.869> this

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
as if you don't really need it with this

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.109 
as if you don't really need it with this
weapon<00:02:07.229> and<00:02:07.590> of<00:02:07.950> course<00:02:07.979> Devils<00:02:08.580> touch<00:02:08.849> and

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
weapon and of course Devils touch and

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.580 
weapon and of course Devils touch and
we're<00:02:09.629> going<00:02:09.750> to<00:02:09.780> take<00:02:09.989> a<00:02:10.020> look<00:02:10.140> at<00:02:10.289> the<00:02:10.349> stats

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
we're going to take a look at the stats

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.350 
we're going to take a look at the stats
of<00:02:10.709> this<00:02:10.830> weapon<00:02:11.009> in<00:02:11.340> terms<00:02:11.849> of<00:02:12.000> the<00:02:12.150> rate<00:02:12.300> of

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
of this weapon in terms of the rate of

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.400 
of this weapon in terms of the rate of
fire<00:02:12.629> impact<00:02:13.080> range

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
fire impact range

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.290 
fire impact range
stability<00:02:13.950> of<00:02:14.160> this<00:02:14.430> weapon<00:02:14.640> in<00:02:14.880> the<00:02:14.970> reload

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
stability of this weapon in the reload

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.390 
stability of this weapon in the reload
speed<00:02:15.570> so<00:02:16.530> the<00:02:16.560> rate<00:02:16.800> of<00:02:16.830> fire<00:02:17.100> for<00:02:17.280> this

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
speed so the rate of fire for this

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.550 
speed so the rate of fire for this
weapon<00:02:17.760> is<00:02:17.910> at<00:02:18.630> eleven<00:02:19.170> which<00:02:19.290> is<00:02:19.410> actually

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
weapon is at eleven which is actually

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.380 
weapon is at eleven which is actually
really<00:02:19.830> good<00:02:19.980> you<00:02:20.310> shoot<00:02:20.550> out<00:02:20.670> five<00:02:21.000> bullets

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
really good you shoot out five bullets

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.390 
really good you shoot out five bullets
each<00:02:21.600> time<00:02:21.900> so<00:02:22.350> rate<00:02:22.590> of<00:02:22.710> fire<00:02:22.890> at<00:02:22.980> eleven<00:02:23.280> is

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
each time so rate of fire at eleven is

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.650 
each time so rate of fire at eleven is
really<00:02:23.760> really<00:02:23.880> nice<00:02:24.120> and<00:02:24.330> with<00:02:24.540> that

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
really really nice and with that

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.000 
really really nice and with that
extended<00:02:25.080> mag<00:02:25.230> you<00:02:25.350> getting<00:02:25.590> more<00:02:25.770> bullets

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
extended mag you getting more bullets

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.620 
extended mag you getting more bullets
out<00:02:26.130> the<00:02:26.310> weapon<00:02:26.640> so<00:02:27.000> that's<00:02:27.180> the<00:02:27.270> reason<00:02:27.300> why

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
out the weapon so that's the reason why

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.140 
out the weapon so that's the reason why
I<00:02:27.660> pick<00:02:27.930> it<00:02:28.110> we<00:02:28.650> have<00:02:28.770> the<00:02:28.860> impact<00:02:29.220> at<00:02:29.460> 64<00:02:30.000> which

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
I pick it we have the impact at 64 which

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.460 
I pick it we have the impact at 64 which
is<00:02:30.300> really<00:02:30.570> really<00:02:30.750> good<00:02:30.990> as<00:02:31.140> well<00:02:31.290> I<00:02:31.320> think

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
is really really good as well I think

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.200 
is really really good as well I think
that's<00:02:31.710> free<00:02:31.980> away<00:02:32.220> from<00:02:32.250> the<00:02:32.580> fair<00:02:32.820> winters

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:33.210 
that's free away from the fair winters

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:35.780 
that's free away from the fair winters
lie<00:02:33.420> the<00:02:34.020> range<00:02:34.290> is<00:02:34.560> at<00:02:34.740> two<00:02:34.950> now<00:02:35.160> guys<00:02:35.400> do<00:02:35.640> not

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
lie the range is at two now guys do not

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.340 
lie the range is at two now guys do not
let<00:02:35.970> this<00:02:36.120> for<00:02:36.360> you<00:02:36.510> I'll<00:02:36.750> tell<00:02:37.170> you<00:02:37.230> about

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
let this for you I'll tell you about

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.160 
let this for you I'll tell you about
that<00:02:37.410> in<00:02:37.680> a<00:02:37.770> minute<00:02:37.980> as<00:02:38.460> the<00:02:38.820> belly<00:02:39.000> is<00:02:39.360> at<00:02:39.420> 12

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
that in a minute as the belly is at 12

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.410 
that in a minute as the belly is at 12
and<00:02:40.500> the<00:02:40.590> reload<00:02:40.890> speed<00:02:41.070> is<00:02:41.250> at<00:02:41.460> 22<00:02:41.970> now<00:02:42.180> I<00:02:42.360> do

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
and the reload speed is at 22 now I do

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:43.700 
and the reload speed is at 22 now I do
