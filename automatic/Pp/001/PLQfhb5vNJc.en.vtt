see that fly again will lean it out make
it<00:00:42.880> fly<00:00:43.090> really<00:00:43.510> well<00:00:43.690> but<00:00:43.780> in<00:00:43.960> the<00:00:44.020> meantime<00:00:44.200> I

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:44.440 
it fly really well but in the meantime I

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.260 
it fly really well but in the meantime I
must<00:00:44.470> say<00:00:44.739> the<00:00:45.250> flight<00:00:45.550> characteristics<00:00:45.880> were

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:46.270 
must say the flight characteristics were

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:48.240 
must say the flight characteristics were
really<00:00:46.720> quite<00:00:46.899> docile<00:00:47.050> it's<00:00:47.530> it's<00:00:47.860> a<00:00:47.950> floaty

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:48.250 
really quite docile it's it's a floaty

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:49.920 
really quite docile it's it's a floaty
little<00:00:48.610> thing<00:00:48.820> us<00:00:48.970> quite<00:00:49.329> surprised<00:00:49.690> well

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:49.930 
little thing us quite surprised well

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:51.660 
little thing us quite surprised well
though<00:00:50.020> I<00:00:50.230> did<00:00:50.590> get<00:00:50.710> it<00:00:50.829> under<00:00:51.010> 100<00:00:51.309> grams<00:00:51.520> in

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:51.670 
though I did get it under 100 grams in

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:53.310 
though I did get it under 100 grams in
the<00:00:51.700> end<00:00:51.910> by<00:00:52.090> using<00:00:52.750> a<00:00:52.960> slightly<00:00:53.140> smaller

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:53.320 
the end by using a slightly smaller

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.250 
the end by using a slightly smaller
battery<00:00:54.000> right<00:00:55.000> what<00:00:55.480> else<00:00:55.510> is<00:00:55.870> going<00:00:56.050> on<00:00:56.110> well

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260 
battery right what else is going on well

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.350 
battery right what else is going on well
as<00:00:56.440> I<00:00:56.469> say<00:00:56.680> build<00:00:56.920> videos<00:00:57.280> are<00:00:57.520> bound<00:00:57.940> up<00:00:58.120> the

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:58.360 
as I say build videos are bound up the

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.450 
as I say build videos are bound up the
cap<00:00:58.540> arena<00:00:58.840> team<00:00:59.710> Blake's<00:00:59.920> you<00:01:00.010> kept<00:01:00.190> her<00:01:00.280> in<00:01:00.430> a

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:00.460 
cap arena team Blake's you kept her in a

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:01.860 
cap arena team Blake's you kept her in a
bit<00:01:00.640> back<00:01:00.879> there<00:01:00.910> which<00:01:01.239> I'll<00:01:01.390> be<00:01:01.480> flying<00:01:01.600> this

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:01.870 
bit back there which I'll be flying this

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.320 
bit back there which I'll be flying this
week<00:01:02.200> in<00:01:02.790> providing<00:01:03.790> the<00:01:04.000> with<00:01:04.089> holes

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:04.330 
week in providing the with holes

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:05.730 
week in providing the with holes
hopefully<00:01:04.960> it<00:01:05.020> will<00:01:05.110> so<00:01:05.320> they'll<00:01:05.530> be<00:01:05.619> the

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:05.740 
hopefully it will so they'll be the

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:07.260 
hopefully it will so they'll be the
flight<00:01:05.920> videos<00:01:06.220> on<00:01:06.369> that<00:01:06.399> the<00:01:06.550> build<00:01:06.759> video<00:01:06.970> is

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:07.270 
flight videos on that the build video is

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.420 
flight videos on that the build video is
quite<00:01:07.899> long<00:01:08.050> so<00:01:08.110> I'm<00:01:08.380> trying<00:01:08.590> to<00:01:08.649> cup<00:01:09.130> itself

hour<00:01:38.470> to<00:01:38.710> put<00:01:39.159> that<00:01:39.280> to<00:01:39.430> take<00:01:39.549> the<00:01:39.670> thing<00:01:39.820> out

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
hour to put that to take the thing out

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.310 
hour to put that to take the thing out
of<00:01:39.939> the<00:01:40.060> box<00:01:40.240> screw<00:01:40.570> the<00:01:40.659> bits<00:01:40.810> together<00:01:40.960> put

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.320 
of the box screw the bits together put

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.140 
of the box screw the bits together put
the<00:01:41.409> gear<00:01:41.590> in<00:01:41.740> and<00:01:42.070> wait<00:01:42.340> we're<00:01:42.520> that<00:01:42.850> was<00:01:42.970> it

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:43.150 
the gear in and wait we're that was it

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.020 
the gear in and wait we're that was it
so<00:01:43.659> simple<00:01:44.320> so<00:01:44.439> quick<00:01:44.979> it<00:01:45.430> really<00:01:45.640> does<00:01:45.850> make

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
so simple so quick it really does make

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.539 
so simple so quick it really does make
it<00:01:46.180> fun<00:01:46.420> because<00:01:46.689> I<00:01:46.900> gotta<00:01:47.619> admit<00:01:47.710> as<00:01:48.009> I<00:01:48.400> get

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:48.549 
it fun because I gotta admit as I get

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:49.740 
it fun because I gotta admit as I get
older<00:01:48.580> I<00:01:48.850> got<00:01:48.970> listen<00:01:49.210> this<00:01:49.330> time<00:01:49.360> for

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.750 
older I got listen this time for

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:51.539 
older I got listen this time for
building<00:01:50.020> it's<00:01:50.530> more<00:01:50.920> and<00:01:51.040> more<00:01:51.130> about<00:01:51.280> flying

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:51.549 
building it's more and more about flying

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:54.030 
building it's more and more about flying
ought<00:01:51.820> to<00:01:51.909> do<00:01:51.970> more<00:01:52.090> flying<00:01:52.299> and<00:01:52.630> so<00:01:53.409> you<00:01:53.829> don't

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:54.040 
ought to do more flying and so you don't

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.050 
ought to do more flying and so you don't
you<00:01:54.220> want<00:01:54.369> to<00:01:54.430> spend<00:01:54.549> the<00:01:54.610> minimum<00:01:54.939> time

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
you want to spend the minimum time

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:56.999 
you want to spend the minimum time
building<00:01:55.479> in<00:01:55.659> the<00:01:55.840> maximum<00:01:56.170> time<00:01:56.320> flying<00:01:56.799> so

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:57.009 
building in the maximum time flying so

00:01:57.009 --> 00:01:58.289 
building in the maximum time flying so
when<00:01:57.130> you<00:01:57.220> buy<00:01:57.340> a<00:01:57.369> model<00:01:57.790> and<00:01:57.880> it<00:01:57.970> comes<00:01:58.119> out<00:01:58.240> of

00:01:58.289 --> 00:01:58.299 
when you buy a model and it comes out of

00:01:58.299 --> 00:01:59.670 
when you buy a model and it comes out of
the<00:01:58.390> box<00:01:58.630> in<00:01:58.750> it's<00:01:58.869> in<00:01:58.990> the<00:01:59.079> air<00:01:59.200> within<00:01:59.439> 30

00:01:59.670 --> 00:01:59.680 
the box in it's in the air within 30

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.249 
the box in it's in the air within 30
minutes<00:01:59.860> it's<00:02:00.729> really<00:02:01.270> good<00:02:01.540> especially<00:02:01.780> if

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:02.259 
minutes it's really good especially if

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:04.109 
minutes it's really good especially if
it's<00:02:02.409> a<00:02:02.470> high-performance<00:02:02.979> EDF<00:02:03.340> now<00:02:03.820> I've<00:02:03.939> got

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:04.119 
it's a high-performance EDF now I've got

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:05.520 
it's a high-performance EDF now I've got
the<00:02:04.210> Bruce<00:02:04.390> Lee<00:02:04.420> 90<00:02:04.750> millimeter<00:02:05.229> that's

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
the Bruce Lee 90 millimeter that's

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.139 
the Bruce Lee 90 millimeter that's
that's<00:02:05.799> quite<00:02:06.009> a<00:02:06.040> long<00:02:06.250> bill<00:02:06.460> that's<00:02:06.670> taken<00:02:07.030> a

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:07.149 
that's quite a long bill that's taken a

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:08.580 
that's quite a long bill that's taken a
long<00:02:07.360> time<00:02:07.390> because<00:02:07.780> you<00:02:08.110> got<00:02:08.259> to<00:02:08.380> do<00:02:08.470> a<00:02:08.500> little

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
long time because you got to do a little

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.530 
long time because you got to do a little
bit<00:02:08.799> the<00:02:08.890> glowing<00:02:09.160> and<00:02:09.549> you<00:02:09.910> know<00:02:10.030> what<00:02:10.209> stuff

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:10.540 
bit the glowing and you know what stuff

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:12.770 
bit the glowing and you know what stuff
is<00:02:10.630> not<00:02:10.840> simply<00:02:11.590> screw<00:02:11.860> stuff<00:02:12.070> to<00:02:12.190> give<00:02:12.370> up<00:02:12.489> its

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
is not simply screw stuff to give up its

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.319 
is not simply screw stuff to give up its
composite<00:02:13.780> it's<00:02:14.079> far<00:02:14.590> become<00:02:15.549> was<00:02:15.910> a<00:02:15.940> carbon

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:16.329 
composite it's far become was a carbon

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:20.220 
composite it's far become was a carbon
fiber<00:02:16.989> glass<00:02:17.230> and<00:02:17.590> bolsa<00:02:18.519> imply<00:02:18.880> so<00:02:19.239> it<00:02:19.389> is

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
fiber glass and bolsa imply so it is

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.410 
fiber glass and bolsa imply so it is
more<00:02:20.590> time<00:02:20.769> consuming<00:02:20.890> build<00:02:21.340> but<00:02:22.030> all's<00:02:22.269> I

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
more time consuming build but all's I

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.330 
more time consuming build but all's I
got<00:02:22.450> other<00:02:22.659> things<00:02:22.720> like<00:02:23.019> this<00:02:23.739> here<00:02:23.980> see<00:02:24.190> that

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340

takes a bit to break them away if you

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:02.640 
takes a bit to break them away if you
get<00:03:01.420> the<00:03:01.510> wrong<00:03:01.690> ones<00:03:01.900> they'll<00:03:02.109> break<00:03:02.349> and<00:03:02.530> MIT

we'll<00:03:19.090> put<00:03:19.209> together<00:03:19.299> a<00:03:19.540> multi-rotor<00:03:19.989> try<00:03:20.200> the

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:20.260 
we'll put together a multi-rotor try the

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.530 
we'll put together a multi-rotor try the
drops<00:03:20.709> see<00:03:21.069> which<00:03:21.220> ones<00:03:21.459> give<00:03:22.150> us<00:03:22.269> the<00:03:22.359> best

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
drops see which ones give us the best

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.150 
drops see which ones give us the best
flight<00:03:22.690> times<00:03:23.049> the<00:03:23.230> best<00:03:23.410> performance<00:03:23.560> this

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
flight times the best performance this

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.470 
flight times the best performance this
stability<00:03:24.370> and<00:03:24.730> the<00:03:24.790> lowest<00:03:25.060> vibration

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
stability and the lowest vibration

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.420 
stability and the lowest vibration
because<00:03:26.139> all<00:03:26.410> those<00:03:26.530> things<00:03:26.769> are<00:03:26.889> important

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
because all those things are important

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.789 
because all those things are important
when<00:03:27.459> you're<00:03:27.579> building<00:03:27.730> multirotors<00:03:28.440> and<00:03:29.440> as

00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:29.799 
when you're building multirotors and as

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:31.620 
when you're building multirotors and as
i<00:03:29.829> say<00:03:30.069> i've<00:03:30.220> got<00:03:30.430> a<00:03:30.459> frame<00:03:30.700> there<00:03:30.910> and<00:03:31.209> I've

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:31.630 
i say i've got a frame there and I've

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:34.140 
i say i've got a frame there and I've
got<00:03:31.810> the<00:03:32.440> other<00:03:33.280> thing<00:03:33.579> that<00:03:33.609> I'm<00:03:33.790> going<00:03:33.819> to<00:03:34.090> be

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
got the other thing that I'm going to be

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.809 
got the other thing that I'm going to be
showing<00:03:34.810> you<00:03:35.049> reviewing<00:03:35.440> us<00:03:35.829> so<00:03:36.220> much<00:03:36.340> stuff

00:03:36.809 --> 00:03:36.819 
showing you reviewing us so much stuff

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:39.839 
showing you reviewing us so much stuff
so<00:03:37.120> little<00:03:37.389> time<00:03:37.660> is<00:03:38.079> the<00:03:38.530> RG<00:03:39.010> pilot<00:03:39.430> well<00:03:39.730> I<00:03:39.760> do

00:03:39.839 --> 00:03:39.849 
so little time is the RG pilot well I do

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:41.370 
so little time is the RG pilot well I do
flyer<00:03:40.269> i<00:03:40.299> think<00:03:40.599> there's<00:03:40.750> your<00:03:40.840> ID<00:03:40.930> you<00:03:41.139> flyer

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:41.380 
flyer i think there's your ID you flyer

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.009 
flyer i think there's your ID you flyer
ok<00:03:41.859> this<00:03:41.980> is<00:03:42.130> a<00:03:42.160> flight<00:03:42.400> control<00:03:42.700> in<00:03:42.790> there

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
ok this is a flight control in there

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:46.020 
ok this is a flight control in there
it's<00:03:44.019> like<00:03:44.530> the<00:03:44.620> kk<00:03:44.980> you<00:03:45.340> can<00:03:45.489> use<00:03:45.639> it<00:03:45.669> for<00:03:45.940> your

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
it's like the kk you can use it for your

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:47.460 
it's like the kk you can use it for your
multi<00:03:46.299> rotor<00:03:46.480> but<00:03:46.750> you<00:03:46.840> can<00:03:46.930> also<00:03:47.049> use<00:03:47.169> it<00:03:47.380> for

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
multi rotor but you can also use it for

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:49.470 
multi rotor but you can also use it for
fixed-wing<00:03:47.799> and<00:03:48.130> it's<00:03:48.489> an<00:03:48.579> autopilot<00:03:49.090> you<00:03:49.359> can

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
fixed-wing and it's an autopilot you can

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.809 
fixed-wing and it's an autopilot you can
set<00:03:49.630> a<00:03:49.660> waypoint<00:03:49.870> it<00:03:50.829> has<00:03:51.010> an<00:03:51.099> onboard<00:03:51.220> compass

00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:51.819 
set a waypoint it has an onboard compass

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:55.440 
set a waypoint it has an onboard compass
it<00:03:52.359> has<00:03:52.569> an<00:03:52.989> onboard<00:03:53.260> biometric<00:03:53.919> sensor<00:03:54.450> you

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
it has an onboard biometric sensor you

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:56.879 
it has an onboard biometric sensor you
can<00:03:55.510> plug<00:03:55.720> a<00:03:55.780> GPS<00:03:56.230> into<00:03:56.470> it<00:03:56.560> and<00:03:56.650> when<00:03:56.769> you've

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:56.889 
can plug a GPS into it and when you've

00:03:56.889 --> 00:03:58.559 
can plug a GPS into it and when you've
done<00:03:57.010> all<00:03:57.069> that<00:03:57.340> you<00:03:57.609> end<00:03:58.030> up<00:03:58.150> with<00:03:58.239> something

00:03:58.559 --> 00:03:58.569 
done all that you end up with something

00:03:58.569 --> 00:03:59.970 
done all that you end up with something
that<00:03:58.599> if<00:03:58.989> you've<00:03:59.169> got<00:03:59.260> a<00:03:59.290> multi-rotor<00:03:59.769> who

00:03:59.970 --> 00:03:59.980 
that if you've got a multi-rotor who

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:02.940 
that if you've got a multi-rotor who
give<00:04:00.130> you<00:04:01.200> autonomous<00:04:02.200> flying<00:04:02.500> it'll<00:04:02.799> give

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:02.950 
give you autonomous flying it'll give

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:04.619 
give you autonomous flying it'll give
you<00:04:03.040> loiter<00:04:03.489> settles<00:04:03.940> just<00:04:04.180> stick<00:04:04.450> in<00:04:04.540> one

00:04:04.619 --> 00:04:04.629 
you loiter settles just stick in one

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:06.240 
you loiter settles just stick in one
place<00:04:04.780> it'll<00:04:04.989> stay<00:04:05.230> there<00:04:05.440> they'll<00:04:05.799> do<00:04:05.919> return

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:06.250 
place it'll stay there they'll do return

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.030 
place it'll stay there they'll do return
to<00:04:06.400> home<00:04:06.639> it'll<00:04:07.569> do<00:04:07.690> why<00:04:08.109> points<00:04:08.410> it'll<00:04:08.560> never

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 
to home it'll do why points it'll never

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:10.229 
to home it'll do why points it'll never
go<00:04:09.190> to<00:04:09.250> pre-program<00:04:09.609> course<00:04:09.970> all<00:04:10.120> those

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:10.239 
go to pre-program course all those

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:12.210 
go to pre-program course all those
things<00:04:10.569> but<00:04:11.200> it's<00:04:11.349> not<00:04:11.470> plug-and-play<00:04:11.709> quite

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:12.220 
things but it's not plug-and-play quite

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:13.170 
things but it's not plug-and-play quite
so<00:04:12.370> much<00:04:12.459> as<00:04:12.639> some<00:04:12.760> of<00:04:12.849> the<00:04:12.910> more<00:04:13.030> expensive

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.180 
so much as some of the more expensive

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:14.789 
so much as some of the more expensive
options<00:04:13.720> because<00:04:13.870> these<00:04:13.989> are<00:04:14.169> only<00:04:14.290> just<00:04:14.410> over

00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:14.799 
options because these are only just over

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:17.219 
options because these are only just over
a<00:04:14.889> hundred<00:04:14.950> bucks<00:04:15.329> with<00:04:16.329> the<00:04:16.449> GPS<00:04:16.840> so<00:04:17.049> that's

00:04:17.219 --> 00:04:17.229 
a hundred bucks with the GPS so that's

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:19.020 
a hundred bucks with the GPS so that's
pretty<00:04:17.500> cheap<00:04:17.739> option<00:04:18.160> for<00:04:18.310> a<00:04:18.340> fully<00:04:18.820> featured

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.030 
pretty cheap option for a fully featured

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:21.750 
pretty cheap option for a fully featured

that<00:04:21.910> when<00:04:22.090> we<00:04:22.180> put<00:04:22.360> this<00:04:22.449> multi<00:04:22.780> rotor<00:04:22.900> thing

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:23.139 
that when we put this multi rotor thing

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:25.170 
that when we put this multi rotor thing
together<00:04:23.320> and<00:04:23.650> test<00:04:23.800> the<00:04:23.889> props<00:04:24.150> also<00:04:25.150> I

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:25.180 
together and test the props also I

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:26.760 
together and test the props also I
ordered<00:04:25.660> some<00:04:25.690> more<00:04:25.900> receivers<00:04:26.199> for<00:04:26.590> the

00:04:31.469 --> 00:04:31.479 
the terminus now I've had a lot of stick

00:04:31.479 --> 00:04:32.439 
the terminus now I've had a lot of stick
time

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:32.449 
time

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:34.420

I like and what I don't like but the

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:36.670 
I like and what I don't like but the
standard<00:04:34.939> trance<00:04:35.210> receiver<00:04:35.599> I<00:04:35.659> got<00:04:35.930> was<00:04:36.139> like

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:36.680 
standard trance receiver I got was like

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.799 
standard trance receiver I got was like
this<00:04:36.830> it<00:04:37.009> just<00:04:37.039> has<00:04:37.279> a<00:04:37.309> regular<00:04:37.729> I'm<00:04:38.509> stripped

00:04:38.799 --> 00:04:38.809 
this it just has a regular I'm stripped

00:04:38.809 --> 00:04:41.350 
this it just has a regular I'm stripped
coax<00:04:39.559> receiver<00:04:40.370> antennas<00:04:40.849> like<00:04:41.029> you<00:04:41.150> get<00:04:41.270> on

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:41.360 
coax receiver antennas like you get on

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.719 
coax receiver antennas like you get on
all<00:04:41.509> the<00:04:41.599> free<00:04:41.749> sky<00:04:41.960> radios<00:04:42.409> receivers<00:04:42.889> and<00:04:43.370> it

00:04:43.719 --> 00:04:43.729 
all the free sky radios receivers and it

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:45.640 
all the free sky radios receivers and it
works<00:04:44.029> fine<00:04:44.120> works<00:04:44.629> fine<00:04:44.779> I've<00:04:45.020> got<00:04:45.379> one<00:04:45.499> in

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:45.650 
works fine works fine I've got one in

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:47.469 
works fine works fine I've got one in
the<00:04:45.800> plane<00:04:46.009> behind<00:04:46.249> me<00:04:46.639> see<00:04:46.969> that<00:04:47.120> plane<00:04:47.240> with

00:04:47.469 --> 00:04:47.479 
the plane behind me see that plane with

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:50.110 
the plane behind me see that plane with
the<00:04:47.509> green<00:04:47.719> tail<00:04:47.900> got<00:04:48.110> one<00:04:48.229> in<00:04:48.319> there<00:04:48.639> now<00:04:49.639> what

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.120 
the green tail got one in there now what

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.179 
the green tail got one in there now what
I<00:04:50.150> also<00:04:50.360> ordered<00:04:50.689> because<00:04:50.990> I<00:04:51.139> saw<00:04:51.349> it<00:04:51.529> was<00:04:52.069> the

00:04:52.179 --> 00:04:52.189 
I also ordered because I saw it was the

00:04:52.189 --> 00:04:54.999 
I also ordered because I saw it was the
one<00:04:52.309> with<00:04:52.550> the<00:04:52.580> local<00:04:53.509> PC<00:04:53.960> antennas<00:04:54.499> these

00:04:54.999 --> 00:04:55.009 
one with the local PC antennas these

00:04:55.009 --> 00:04:57.700 
one with the local PC antennas these
have<00:04:55.129> got<00:04:55.159> big<00:04:55.460> blobs<00:04:55.879> on<00:04:56.089> the<00:04:56.210> end<00:04:56.710> these

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:57.710 
have got big blobs on the end these

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:01.269 
have got big blobs on the end these
antennas<00:04:58.189> are<00:04:58.990> not<00:04:59.990> heavy<00:05:00.199> or<00:05:00.289> bulky<00:05:00.499> and<00:05:01.069> the

00:05:01.269 --> 00:05:01.279 
antennas are not heavy or bulky and the

00:05:01.279 --> 00:05:02.799 
antennas are not heavy or bulky and the
leads<00:05:01.460> are<00:05:01.550> pretty<00:05:01.759> short<00:05:01.969> actually<00:05:02.360> so<00:05:02.539> it

00:05:02.799 --> 00:05:02.809 
leads are pretty short actually so it

00:05:02.809 --> 00:05:04.659 
leads are pretty short actually so it
makes<00:05:02.990> it<00:05:03.110> fitting<00:05:03.499> them<00:05:03.589> a<00:05:03.830> bit<00:05:04.099> harder<00:05:04.370> with

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:04.669 
makes it fitting them a bit harder with

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:05.860 
makes it fitting them a bit harder with
the<00:05:04.699> really<00:05:04.909> short<00:05:05.120> leads<00:05:05.360> but<00:05:05.719> it's<00:05:05.810> supposed

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:05.870 
the really short leads but it's supposed

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:07.510 
the really short leads but it's supposed
to<00:05:06.080> give<00:05:06.199> you<00:05:06.289> extra<00:05:06.529> range<00:05:06.830> it<00:05:07.099> probably<00:05:07.400> does

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:07.520 
to give you extra range it probably does

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:08.739 
to give you extra range it probably does
it<00:05:07.669> because<00:05:07.909> it<00:05:08.029> bubbly<00:05:08.270> creates<00:05:08.509> a<00:05:08.629> more

00:05:08.739 --> 00:05:08.749 
it because it bubbly creates a more

00:05:08.749 --> 00:05:10.239 
it because it bubbly creates a more
balanced<00:05:09.050> dipole<00:05:09.469> then<00:05:09.650> just<00:05:09.830> the<00:05:09.889> piece<00:05:10.129> of

00:05:10.239 --> 00:05:10.249 
balanced dipole then just the piece of

00:05:10.249 --> 00:05:11.950 
balanced dipole then just the piece of
wire<00:05:10.370> poking<00:05:10.550> out<00:05:10.819> of<00:05:10.849> the<00:05:10.939> coaxial<00:05:11.389> cable

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:11.960 
wire poking out of the coaxial cable

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:15.760 
wire poking out of the coaxial cable
that's<00:05:12.740> bit<00:05:12.979> like<00:05:13.159> these<00:05:13.430> this<00:05:13.909> is<00:05:14.060> the<00:05:14.770> sleeve

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:15.770 
that's bit like these this is the sleeve

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:17.559 
that's bit like these this is the sleeve
dipoles<00:05:16.249> at<00:05:16.430> a<00:05:16.460> lot<00:05:16.610> of<00:05:16.699> radios<00:05:16.999> love<00:05:17.300> to<00:05:17.449> fly

00:05:17.559 --> 00:05:17.569 
dipoles at a lot of radios love to fly

00:05:17.569 --> 00:05:18.939 
dipoles at a lot of radios love to fly
for<00:05:17.629> receivers<00:05:18.020> are<00:05:18.199> using<00:05:18.529> their<00:05:18.680> to<00:05:18.800> get

00:05:18.939 --> 00:05:18.949 
for receivers are using their to get

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:21.820 
for receivers are using their to get
extra<00:05:19.279> range<00:05:19.599> these<00:05:20.599> things<00:05:20.900> here<00:05:21.080> give<00:05:21.740> you

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:21.830 
extra range these things here give you

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:22.959 
extra range these things here give you
about<00:05:21.919> twenty<00:05:22.189> percent<00:05:22.370> extra<00:05:22.639> range<00:05:22.759> they

00:05:22.959 --> 00:05:22.969 
about twenty percent extra range they

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:25.149 
about twenty percent extra range they
tell<00:05:23.240> us<00:05:23.419> and<00:05:23.719> you'll<00:05:23.990> find<00:05:24.199> them<00:05:24.319> normally<00:05:25.069> on

if I'm looking for it it's on the disk

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:45.189 
if I'm looking for it it's on the disk
but<00:05:39.680> we're<00:05:40.159> I<00:05:41.139> don't<00:05:42.139> know<00:05:42.580> lost<00:05:43.580> anyway<00:05:44.199> look

you're<00:05:45.319> not<00:05:45.409> a<00:05:45.469> little<00:05:45.680> turnigy<00:05:46.009> receivers

00:05:46.689 --> 00:05:46.699 
you're not a little turnigy receivers

00:05:46.699 --> 00:05:47.980 
you're not a little turnigy receivers
they<00:05:46.789> had<00:05:46.909> that<00:05:46.969> little<00:05:47.120> sleep<00:05:47.360> dipole<00:05:47.689> well

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:47.990 
they had that little sleep dipole well

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:49.959 
they had that little sleep dipole well
yeah<00:05:48.709> there<00:05:49.069> you<00:05:49.129> go<00:05:49.189> by<00:05:49.490> the<00:05:49.580> way<00:05:49.669> you<00:05:49.729> can

00:05:49.959 --> 00:05:49.969 
yeah there you go by the way you can

00:05:49.969 --> 00:05:52.029 
yeah there you go by the way you can
retrofit<00:05:50.360> your<00:05:50.539> existing<00:05:50.719> free<00:05:51.529> sky<00:05:51.709> radios

them separately and they have a little

00:05:55.729 --> 00:05:57.610 
them separately and they have a little
micro<00:05:56.360> FL<00:05:56.629> connector<00:05:56.959> on<00:05:57.080> the<00:05:57.110> end<00:05:57.229> here<00:05:57.379> which

00:05:58.929 --> 00:05:58.939 
you can just pop the old Ariel off the

00:05:58.939 --> 00:06:01.119 
you can just pop the old Ariel off the
board<00:05:59.120> pop<00:05:59.599> these<00:05:59.749> on<00:05:59.810> and<00:06:00.110> in<00:06:00.560> theory<00:06:00.889> give

00:06:01.119 --> 00:06:01.129 
board pop these on and in theory give

00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:02.920 
board pop these on and in theory give
you<00:06:01.189> twenty<00:06:01.639> percent<00:06:01.819> extra<00:06:02.120> range<00:06:02.270> if<00:06:02.599> you

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:02.930 
you twenty percent extra range if you

00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:01.510 
behind me here which we will be doing
the<00:06:59.110> there's<00:07:00.110> no<00:07:00.200> build<00:07:00.440> video<00:07:00.680> because<00:07:01.370> it<00:07:01.460> I

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:01.520 
the there's no build video because it I
