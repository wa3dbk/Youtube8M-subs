bottom it doesn't cover the bottom I'll
and<00:04:22.130> this<00:04:23.240> like<00:04:24.240> silver<00:04:24.930> lining<00:04:25.770> on<00:04:25.860> the

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:25.890 
and this like silver lining on the

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:28.520 
and this like silver lining on the
outside<00:04:26.340> of<00:04:26.370> the<00:04:26.669> ipod<00:04:27.000> you<00:04:27.270> can<00:04:27.450> see<00:04:27.630> that<00:04:28.380> is

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:28.530 
outside of the ipod you can see that is

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:31.480 
outside of the ipod you can see that is
there<00:04:28.800> it<00:04:29.070> doesn't<00:04:29.250> cover<00:04:29.640> it<00:04:29.790> at<00:04:30.510> all

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:31.490 
there it doesn't cover it at all

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:33.830 
there it doesn't cover it at all
personally<00:04:32.490> right<00:04:32.700> now<00:04:32.850> I<00:04:33.180> don't<00:04:33.480> like<00:04:33.690> this

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
personally right now I don't like this

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.510 
personally right now I don't like this
case<00:04:34.080> because<00:04:34.380> not<00:04:34.770> that<00:04:34.980> much<00:04:35.130> protection

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
case because not that much protection

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.990 
case because not that much protection
not<00:04:36.300> as<00:04:36.480> much<00:04:36.660> as<00:04:37.040> the<00:04:38.040> Griffin<00:04:38.430> case<00:04:38.460> that<00:04:38.910> has

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
not as much as the Griffin case that has

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.650 
not as much as the Griffin case that has
been<00:04:39.180> using<00:04:39.540> as<00:04:40.320> you<00:04:41.250> can<00:04:41.340> see<00:04:41.520> it<00:04:42.030> covers<00:04:42.480> the

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:42.660 
been using as you can see it covers the

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:46.850 
been using as you can see it covers the
whole<00:04:42.690> thing<00:04:43.520> but<00:04:44.520> so<00:04:44.730> far<00:04:44.940> this<00:04:45.300> case<00:04:45.570> is<00:04:45.900> it

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860 
whole thing but so far this case is it

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:48.770
