00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.240
 Hello everyone, Dmitry, today I am 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:08.160
 I will show you how to build a cobblestone generator 

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:11.550
 at the end you can find a lot of videos 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.360
 how to do it really will 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:17.330
 just thousands 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:22.260
 but I will share the simplest poles found 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:24.210
 give does not require many costs build 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:28.410
 any resources there and follow up there and 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:30.599
 difficult then these two porsche are not on 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:36.980
 In fact, we know this is not so 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:48.780
 it's hard now where do tubing construction 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:59.539
 Here we build bases with a width of 3 blocks. 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:59.539
 so it will be six blocks long 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:06.320
 children make it exactly in two 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.320
 block 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:23.189
 here we do a little decorate the children do in one 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:24.930
 god somewhere indentation is not necessary well here 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:28.220
 the most reliable generator of cobblestone 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:33.470
 he is ready well he will automatically 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:33.470
 so we do automatically 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:46.430
 here so it is the ordinary generator 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:50.700
 cobblestone can beat likes to appear 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:54.870
 Well, there is a danger that the cobblestone 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:56.990
 it will be you we do not need it 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:02:03.680
 language that's why we do 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:07.080
 so automatically put thread piston and 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:11.900
 opposite to this piston get tired yet 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:20.100
 one piston and to this porsche loves it 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:30.830
 another bolt is needed so time tom not 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:38.190
 forgot apologize plugin damn it 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:44.970
 children put 3 blocks here right here 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:47.250
 here here we put a repeater but in general 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:52.370
 such we all just have to go where 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:57.980
 we are comfortable chain can be example 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:57.980
 here here and run it 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:13.230
 all great work can see here 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:16.470
 his view from above everything he works everything 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:21.930
 fine well this 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:25.170
 and, too, your disadvantages are China, but not about them 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.940
 We will also talk if you encounter 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:31.160
 such a problem that he finished 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:32.340
 moving is a matter of maximum length 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:36.330
 budnikova 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:44.960
 blocks to remove it but it's just 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:48.360
 all blocks bring down to the very stop and 

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:54.840
 failures be and you can just stand children 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:56.610
 beat them you will be much more comfortable anywhere 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:00.060
 This is especially useful for you if vodka 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:06.420
 this is a big building and arrange for the whales 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:08.070
 locks so you need it on this 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.790
 all with you was dmitri 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:10.790
 bye bye
