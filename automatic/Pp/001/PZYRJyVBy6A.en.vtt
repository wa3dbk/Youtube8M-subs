00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:09.870
 Hello guys 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.969
 This is another video from the Artisan Channel 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:17.030
 today we are going to teach a cake in 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:17.030
 silencing the two colors white and pink 

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:24.199
 to cook cakes we will use 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:28.099
 these two nozzles 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:36.890
 the first one is going to be this 195 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:39.110
 numbering is 195 and another beak is 127 looks 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:43.510
 Notice that his name is soft. 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.510
 okay so I'm going to hit a little bit 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:52.670
 to have a more children consistency 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:56.210
 first I'll hit the high speed and 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.690
 then at low speed to remove 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.619
 the air 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.619
 the excess air 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:22.290
 Look, he's gone now more then 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:24.509
 to remove this excess of air 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:28.190
 I'll hit the bubbles again again only 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.190
 in the Basque language 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:48.479
 tighten and under this thick part I go 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.180
 put into're 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:58.649
 and that's the thin end and we're going 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:02:01.110
 do is press and make a zig zag and 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.009
 in the end you tighten a little bit and 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:10.709
 drop 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:12.209
 now uses white color to tighten and 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.700
 thick part 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:15.510
 on the inside and the thin part of 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.650
 out 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.650
 Let's make some and design. 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:32.040
 again the white petals only 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:43.960
 and so it continues until the end 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:43.960
 of the cake 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:51.500
 now I'll do the finishing on the side 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.500
 on the edge of the null 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.460
 I'll mix a little of that color 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.450
 rose 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:05.069
 White 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.080
 I'll spend a little more of this 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:11.310
 Whipped cream that is forming bubbles 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:18.540
 up here then I'll pass this other 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:21.720
 Jatinho gets smoother looking to leave 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:24.300
 always bolivia up with this beak and 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:28.709
 hope to go around to do the 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:32.280
 finish done a little bit the sleeve 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:38.549
 There you tighten and pull the peta. 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:41.430
 and poxa is tam and pulls staff on this cake 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:44.310
 I put three roses and I'm going too. 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:46.680

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:50.370
