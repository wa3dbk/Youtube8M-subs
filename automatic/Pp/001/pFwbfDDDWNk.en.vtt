lounge true if I'm not going to bother
down<00:00:16.590> further<00:00:16.800> because<00:00:17.789> it<00:00:17.970> takes<00:00:18.119> too<00:00:18.330> long

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
down further because it takes too long

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:19.700 
down further because it takes too long
and<00:00:18.869> when<00:00:19.020> you've<00:00:19.109> got<00:00:19.170> two<00:00:19.320> minutes<00:00:19.350> on

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
and when you've got two minutes on

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.220 
and when you've got two minutes on
YouTube<00:00:20.039> let's<00:00:20.550> start<00:00:20.730> the<00:00:21.000> game<00:00:21.180> so<00:00:21.960> but

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
YouTube let's start the game so but

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.710 
YouTube let's start the game so but
basically<00:00:23.220> you<00:00:23.460> can<00:00:23.640> choose<00:00:23.850> between<00:00:23.880> level<00:00:24.510> 1

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
basically you can choose between level 1

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.710 
basically you can choose between level 1
and<00:00:24.900> 20<00:00:25.590> they<00:00:26.460> is<00:00:26.640> actually<00:00:27.029> more<00:00:27.210> than<00:00:27.269> 20

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
and 20 they is actually more than 20

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.169 
and 20 they is actually more than 20
levels<00:00:28.160> the<00:00:29.160> staff<00:00:29.429> in<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:29.609> beginning<00:00:29.910> anyway

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
levels the staff in the beginning anyway

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:31.700 
levels the staff in the beginning anyway
but<00:00:30.390> you<00:00:30.480> can't<00:00:30.689> choose<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:31.109> higher<00:00:31.230> levels

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.249 
enemies will start to appear on my
a-levels<00:01:32.310> I<00:01:32.630> think<00:01:33.630> there's<00:01:33.780> an<00:01:33.840> enemy<00:01:34.140> on<00:01:34.229> the

a-levels I think there's an enemy on the

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.640 
a-levels I think there's an enemy on the
next<00:01:34.500> level<00:01:34.770> we'll<00:01:35.490> soon<00:01:35.700> find<00:01:35.729> out<00:01:36.150> won't<00:01:36.210> we
