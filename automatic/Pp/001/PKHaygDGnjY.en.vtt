pocket right over here Angeles's men are
being<00:02:08.979> surrounded<00:02:09.450> there's<00:02:10.450> now<00:02:10.599> clipping

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:11.019 
being surrounded there's now clipping

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:14.520 
being surrounded there's now clipping
rei<00:02:11.290> in<00:02:11.680> the<00:02:11.800> rear<00:02:11.980> and<00:02:12.690> Kameda<00:02:13.690> tenses<00:02:14.170> in<00:02:14.200> the

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
was a pretty bloody fight there for a

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.320 
was a pretty bloody fight there for a
while<00:02:47.130> the<00:02:48.130> Romans<00:02:48.549> had<00:02:48.760> some<00:02:48.970> pretty<00:02:49.120> good

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
while the Romans had some pretty good

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.520 
while the Romans had some pretty good
positioning<00:02:50.280> but<00:02:51.280> Angeles<00:02:51.760> was<00:02:51.940> able<00:02:52.239> to<00:02:52.530> turn

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
positioning but Angeles was able to turn

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.620 
positioning but Angeles was able to turn
the<00:02:53.680> positioning<00:02:54.190> around<00:02:54.519> and<00:02:54.790> win<00:02:55.510> the

the positioning around and win the

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.250 
the positioning around and win the
battle<00:02:56.069> so<00:02:57.069> basically<00:02:57.819> the<00:02:58.360> rejects<00:02:58.720> strategy

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:05.049 
variance fight which is a sound plan

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:08.780 
variance fight which is a sound plan
that<00:03:05.500> happens<00:03:05.920> a<00:03:06.010> lot<00:03:06.160> of<00:03:06.400> VI<00:03:07.200> barbarians

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
that happens a lot of VI barbarians

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.550 
that happens a lot of VI barbarians
morale<00:03:09.790> can<00:03:10.030> be<00:03:10.090> broken<00:03:10.329> easy<00:03:10.630> but<00:03:11.079> not<00:03:11.290> just

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
morale can be broken easy but not just

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.170 
morale can be broken easy but not just
barbarians<00:03:12.130> sometimes<00:03:12.579> the<00:03:12.730> civilized

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
barbarians sometimes the civilized

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.379 
barbarians sometimes the civilized
factions<00:03:13.690> will<00:03:13.810> break<00:03:14.049> easy<00:03:14.319> as<00:03:14.500> well<00:03:14.709> and

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:15.389 
factions will break easy as well and

00:03:15.389 --> 00:03:18.180 
factions will break easy as well and
then<00:03:16.389> of<00:03:16.569> course<00:03:16.810> it<00:03:17.109> look<00:03:17.230> like<00:03:17.380> Angeles<00:03:17.889> just

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
then of course it look like Angeles just

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.640 
then of course it look like Angeles just
had<00:03:18.340> a<00:03:18.370> all<00:03:18.940> around<00:03:19.299> army<00:03:19.720> with<00:03:20.019> some<00:03:20.230> tough

cavalry supporting troops in the keel

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:25.559 
cavalry supporting troops in the keel
and<00:03:23.200> then<00:03:24.010> the<00:03:24.519> sacks<00:03:24.760> and<00:03:24.910> hard<00:03:25.090> troops<00:03:25.420> are

00:03:25.559 --> 00:03:25.569 
and then the sacks and hard troops are

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:27.930 
and then the sacks and hard troops are
getting<00:03:25.750> tough<00:03:26.049> heavy<00:03:26.319> infantry<00:03:26.850> then<00:03:27.850> of

getting tough heavy infantry then of

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.030 
getting tough heavy infantry then of
course<00:03:28.150> is<00:03:28.299> Hunter's<00:03:28.660> any<00:03:29.500> case<00:03:29.739> there<00:03:29.950> was

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
course is Hunter's any case there was
