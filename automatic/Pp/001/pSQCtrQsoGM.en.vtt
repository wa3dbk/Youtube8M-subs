00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
together in a normal fashion so it took

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:21.140 
together in a normal fashion so it took
it<00:00:15.750> apart<00:00:16.580> so<00:00:17.580> let's<00:00:17.789> start<00:00:18.060> by<00:00:19.640> this<00:00:20.640> one<00:00:20.880> over

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
it apart so let's start by this one over

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.150 
it apart so let's start by this one over
here<00:00:21.180> and<00:00:22.670> then<00:00:23.670> try<00:00:24.060> to<00:00:24.119> get<00:00:24.449> it<00:00:24.570> so<00:00:25.170> these<00:00:25.920> two

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
here and then try to get it so these two

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.859 
here and then try to get it so these two
wires<00:00:26.340> are<00:00:26.609> coming<00:00:26.880> here<00:00:27.119> and<00:00:27.240> then<00:00:27.449> this<00:00:27.810> one

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
wires are coming here and then this one

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.030 
wires are coming here and then this one
over<00:00:28.260> here<00:00:28.289> and<00:00:29.449> then<00:00:30.449> place<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.529> camera<00:00:31.769> in

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
over here and then place the camera in

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.510 
over here and then place the camera in
place<00:00:32.600> right<00:00:33.600> like<00:00:34.020> that<00:00:34.230> and<00:00:34.969> then<00:00:35.969> first

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:37.520 
place right like that and then first

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.180 
place right like that and then first
first<00:00:38.520> we<00:00:38.670> can<00:00:38.910> start<00:00:39.500> inserting<00:00:40.500> this<00:00:40.770> film

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
first we can start inserting this film

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.450 
first we can start inserting this film
first<00:00:41.780> make<00:00:42.780> sure<00:00:42.809> this<00:00:43.110> tab<00:00:43.440> is<00:00:43.680> up<00:00:43.980> and<00:00:45.079> then

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:46.460 
first make sure this tab is up and then

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.540 
first make sure this tab is up and then
there's<00:00:47.460> two<00:00:47.730> lines<00:00:48.030> here<00:00:48.950> so<00:00:49.950> just<00:00:50.250> get<00:00:50.399> it

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
there's two lines here so just get it

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.119 
there's two lines here so just get it
sliding<00:00:51.270> and<00:00:51.539> it's<00:00:51.629> just<00:00:51.899> slide<00:00:52.170> in<00:00:52.350> just<00:00:53.010> like

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
sliding and it's just slide in just like

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.240 
sliding and it's just slide in just like
that<00:00:53.390> should<00:00:54.390> see<00:00:54.600> two<00:00:55.469> lines<00:00:55.649> and<00:00:56.070> then

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
that should see two lines and then

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.849 
that should see two lines and then
another<00:00:56.430> space<00:00:57.120> for<00:00:57.390> it<00:00:57.480> and<00:00:57.660> it<00:00:58.649> will<00:00:58.710> just

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
another space for it and it will just

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.349 
another space for it and it will just
fit<00:00:59.129> there<00:00:59.309> and<00:00:59.550> won't<00:00:59.699> go<00:00:59.789> in<00:00:59.910> there<00:01:00.090> and<00:01:00.210> then

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
fit there and won't go in there and then

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.119 
fit there and won't go in there and then
just<00:01:00.570> close<00:01:01.170> that<00:01:01.230> slot<00:01:02.270> that's<00:01:03.270> it<00:01:03.480> right<00:01:04.129> and

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
just close that slot that's it right and

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.070 
just close that slot that's it right and
then<00:01:05.369> we're<00:01:05.549> going<00:01:05.640> to<00:01:05.700> snap<00:01:06.360> this<00:01:06.689> one<00:01:06.900> back

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
then we're going to snap this one back

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:14.669 
then we're going to snap this one back
on<00:01:09.049> so<00:01:11.630> carefully

00:01:14.669 --> 00:01:14.679 

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:20.050 

snap<00:01:15.679> it<00:01:15.979> back<00:01:16.219> on<00:01:16.880> there<00:01:18.340> should<00:01:19.340> feel<00:01:19.850> the

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
snap it back on there should feel the

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.169 
snap it back on there should feel the
little<00:01:20.299> snap<00:01:20.539> alright<00:01:21.200> that's<00:01:21.319> fine<00:01:21.909> and<00:01:22.909> then

00:01:23.169 --> 00:01:23.179 
little snap alright that's fine and then

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:29.770 
little snap alright that's fine and then
snap<00:01:23.539> this<00:01:23.869> one<00:01:24.079> back<00:01:24.259> on<00:01:25.359> can<00:01:26.359> see<00:01:26.689> a<00:01:28.569> this<00:01:29.569> one

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
snap this one back on can see a this one

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:39.620 
snap this one back on can see a this one
should<00:01:31.420> snap<00:01:32.420> back<00:01:32.689> in<00:01:32.869> there<00:01:33.020> pretty<00:01:33.200> easily

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:46.030 

look<00:01:40.229> maybe<00:01:40.799> not<00:01:41.009> 30<00:01:41.280> you<00:01:41.460> leave<00:01:41.700> it

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:46.040 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.860 

there<00:01:46.580> we<00:01:46.670> go<00:01:46.820> snap<00:01:47.270> back<00:01:47.510> in<00:01:48.520> and<00:01:49.520> now<00:01:49.870> use

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:50.870 
there we go snap back in and now use

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:54.280 
there we go snap back in and now use
your<00:01:51.070> screwdriver<00:01:52.070> so<00:01:52.610> it<00:01:52.670> doesn't<00:01:52.970> touch<00:01:53.290> and

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 
your screwdriver so it doesn't touch and

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:59.710 
your screwdriver so it doesn't touch and
then<00:01:55.000> drop<00:01:56.000> it<00:01:56.030> down<00:01:56.300> a<00:01:56.360> little<00:01:56.480> bit<00:01:57.910> and<00:01:58.910> we're

00:01:59.710 --> 00:01:59.720 
then drop it down a little bit and we're

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.660 
then drop it down a little bit and we're
almost<00:01:59.870> there<00:02:00.140> and<00:02:01.070> we're<00:02:01.280> going<00:02:01.370> to<00:02:01.430> snap

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
almost there and we're going to snap

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.670 
almost there and we're going to snap
back<00:02:01.730> this<00:02:02.210> one<00:02:02.480> back<00:02:02.840> into<00:02:03.140> place<00:02:03.320> the<00:02:03.500> white

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 
back this one back into place the white

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.430 
back this one back into place the white
wire<00:02:03.860> we<00:02:04.100> took<00:02:04.250> out<00:02:04.460> on<00:02:05.420> the<00:02:05.660> discipline<00:02:06.260> bleah

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:06.440 
wire we took out on the discipline bleah

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.359 
wire we took out on the discipline bleah
so<00:02:07.070> we<00:02:07.250> do<00:02:07.400> that<00:02:08.380> she<00:02:09.380> just<00:02:09.560> snap<00:02:09.890> in<00:02:10.130> there

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
so we do that she just snap in there

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:17.210 
so we do that she just snap in there
just<00:02:10.729> be<00:02:10.910> careful

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
you know i would actually open up these

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.520 
you know i would actually open up these
chips<00:02:19.710> and<00:02:20.040> to<00:02:20.370> find<00:02:20.640> out<00:02:20.850> what's<00:02:21.120> inside<00:02:21.530> but

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
snaps into place and that's pretty much

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:04.160

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
battery film going like that and then

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.770 
battery film going like that and then
carefully<00:03:13.709> place<00:03:14.240> place<00:03:15.240> it<00:03:15.420> there<00:03:15.540> and<00:03:15.720> you

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
should be able to just snap everything

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.540 
should be able to just snap everything
in<00:03:17.400> place<00:03:17.610> just<00:03:18.590> carefully<00:03:19.590> start<00:03:20.310> with<00:03:20.430> the

insert the t5 hex screws all right so

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:50.290 
insert the t5 hex screws all right so
we're<00:03:47.510> almost<00:03:47.660> there<00:03:48.610> I've<00:03:49.610> done<00:03:49.880> this<00:03:50.030> about

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:50.300 
we're almost there I've done this about

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:53.200 
we're almost there I've done this about
10<00:03:50.600> times<00:03:51.490> sometimes<00:03:52.490> I<00:03:52.640> forgot<00:03:52.970> some

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:53.210 
10 times sometimes I forgot some

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:56.350 
10 times sometimes I forgot some
connection<00:03:53.660> so<00:03:53.840> I<00:03:53.870> had<00:03:54.020> to<00:03:54.880> open<00:03:55.880> it<00:03:56.000> that<00:03:56.150> god

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:56.360 
connection so I had to open it that god

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.440 
connection so I had to open it that god
it's<00:03:57.050> pretty<00:03:57.260> easy<00:03:57.440> to<00:03:57.590> do<00:03:57.830> and<00:03:58.450> it'll

00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.450 
it's pretty easy to do and it'll

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:01.180 
it's pretty easy to do and it'll
probably<00:03:59.720> void<00:04:00.110> your<00:04:00.170> warranty<00:04:00.410> but<00:04:00.950> if<00:04:01.070> you

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:01.190 
probably void your warranty but if you

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:02.860 
probably void your warranty but if you
do<00:04:01.400> it<00:04:01.520> really<00:04:01.910> carefully<00:04:02.150> there's<00:04:02.540> no<00:04:02.720> way

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
do it really carefully there's no way

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:05.500 
do it really carefully there's no way
you<00:04:03.230> know<00:04:03.350> they<00:04:03.560> could<00:04:03.710> find<00:04:03.920> out<00:04:04.130> that<00:04:04.280> you<00:04:04.510> so

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:05.510

anything<00:04:08.180> I<00:04:08.360> mean<00:04:08.960> they<00:04:09.080> might<00:04:09.260> have<00:04:09.410> it<00:04:09.590> for

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:09.920 
anything I mean they might have it for

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:13.150 
anything I mean they might have it for
the<00:04:10.130> actual<00:04:11.230> launch<00:04:12.230> versions<00:04:12.710> but<00:04:12.920> I<00:04:12.980> doubt

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:13.160 
the actual launch versions but I doubt

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.300 
the actual launch versions but I doubt
it<00:04:13.520> I<00:04:13.900> doubt<00:04:14.900> any<00:04:15.110> want<00:04:15.260> you<00:04:15.440> try<00:04:15.740> to<00:04:15.800> open<00:04:15.920> it

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310 
it I doubt any want you try to open it

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:19.509 
it I doubt any want you try to open it
unless<00:04:16.459> they<00:04:17.120> know<00:04:17.239> what<00:04:17.390> they're<00:04:17.570> doing<00:04:18.519> this

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:19.519 
unless they know what they're doing this

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:23.520 
unless they know what they're doing this
video<00:04:19.850> could<00:04:20.060> help

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:27.330 

but<00:04:24.130> as<00:04:24.220> you<00:04:24.370> can<00:04:24.520> see<00:04:24.790> this<00:04:25.920> motorola<00:04:26.920> could

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:27.340 
but as you can see this motorola could

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:29.640 
but as you can see this motorola could
have<00:04:27.460> actually<00:04:27.670> been<00:04:28.540> designed<00:04:28.960> it<00:04:29.200> a<00:04:29.230> little

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:29.650 
have actually been designed it a little

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:32.510 
have actually been designed it a little
bit<00:04:29.830> shorter<00:04:30.389> this<00:04:31.389> is<00:04:31.540> actually<00:04:31.900> just<00:04:32.080> uh

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 
bit shorter this is actually just uh

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:38.129 
bit shorter this is actually just uh
empty<00:04:33.520> plastic<00:04:33.760> pieces<00:04:35.040> so<00:04:36.040> i<00:04:36.430> think<00:04:37.330> is

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:38.139 
empty plastic pieces so i think is

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:39.659 
empty plastic pieces so i think is
because<00:04:38.440> of<00:04:38.620> this<00:04:38.830> ship<00:04:39.190> I<00:04:39.310> don't<00:04:39.460> know<00:04:39.520> what

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:39.669 
because of this ship I don't know what

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:44.040 
because of this ship I don't know what
it<00:04:39.760> is<00:04:39.850> called<00:04:40.180> it's<00:04:40.389> called<00:04:40.630> a<00:04:41.280> s<00:04:42.280> 1922<00:04:43.120> 696

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.050 
it is called it's called a s 1922 696

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.470 
it is called it's called a s 1922 696
ship<00:04:44.530> could<00:04:45.430> be<00:04:45.490> some<00:04:45.790> kind<00:04:45.970> of<00:04:46.000> clock<00:04:46.300> or

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:46.480 
ship could be some kind of clock or

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.270 
ship could be some kind of clock or
something<00:04:46.510> so<00:04:47.230> they<00:04:47.380> needed<00:04:47.560> that<00:04:47.680> room<00:04:48.010> for

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.280 
something so they needed that room for

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.670 
something so they needed that room for
it<00:04:48.370> so<00:04:49.000> they<00:04:49.030> actually<00:04:49.270> extended<00:04:49.990> it<00:04:50.110> but<00:04:50.560> they

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:50.680 
it so they actually extended it but they

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.590 
it so they actually extended it but they
could<00:04:50.860> have<00:04:50.950> put<00:04:51.130> it<00:04:51.220> somewhere<00:04:51.520> else<00:04:51.700> but

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:52.600 
could have put it somewhere else but

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.840 
could have put it somewhere else but
maybe<00:04:52.780> could<00:04:53.560> have<00:04:53.650> made<00:04:53.980> that<00:04:54.010> phone<00:04:54.400> larger

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:54.850 
maybe could have made that phone larger

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:57.990 
maybe could have made that phone larger
I<00:04:55.030> me<00:04:55.960> that's<00:04:56.140> in<00:04:56.320> place<00:04:56.610> you<00:04:57.610> know<00:04:57.730> we're

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.000 
I me that's in place you know we're

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:14.720 
I me that's in place you know we're
going<00:04:58.090> to<00:04:58.150> just<00:04:58.300> snap<00:04:58.510> it<00:04:58.540> all<00:04:58.780> in<00:04:58.960> place

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:14.730 

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:18.690 

snap

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:18.700 

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:23.450 

so

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:23.460 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:28.200 

and<00:05:24.460> snap<00:05:24.910> the<00:05:25.090> top<00:05:25.300> back<00:05:25.539> in<00:05:25.750> place<00:05:25.990> and<00:05:27.210> two

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:28.210 
and snap the top back in place and two
