00:00:03.529 --> 00:00:07.649
 cross you respect reader and viewer 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.679
 Internet resource mega review dot com 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:14.490
 Today we will consider the budget buildings 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:17.279
 erkal v3x advance from cost 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:21.449
 the current decision 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:23.330
 is 1350 rubles also available 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.820
 several variations differing in color 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:29.340
 backlight front panel in the youngest 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.700
 models of this fan are here at all 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:35.880
 no, there is only a rear 80 millimeter 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.530
 and different layout by quantity 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.820
 fans 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:41.790
 this model is without a block 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:44.250
 Power to buy enclosures without a block 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.780
 Power think it is advisable that is you 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.940
 do not spend extra money and you can 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:54.690
 choose the specific model you need by 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:57.350
 characteristics don't overpay for exactly 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:01.140
 worth it sure as a power supply 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:03.989
 the case is very compact it is suitable for 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:09.750
 installing micro format motherboards 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:13.290
 and quiet and ata and that is to put together a system 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:17.040
 it is quite possible to use them 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:19.110
 here steel is 0-5 millimeters thick 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.330
 have become quite nice then from the side 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:25.110
 we have a removable cover 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:27.330
 small edges the body itself is not designed by design 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.299
 different pretentious elements that is 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.040
 and something so particularly original here 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:35.850
 classic one-piece case 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:38.700
 here the lattice of and form and steel 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.100
 the honeycomb inside the dust filter and 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.259
 under it lies a fan red 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.270
 interest 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:47.579
 120 millimeters there is a small 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.530
 billet see was planning here 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:52.020
 supply offer and dust that but u 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.420
 us here is such a major moment 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.399
 part of the plastic is glossy and matte and 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.460
 the control unit is at the top 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.460
 parts 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.170
 is the arrangement of the elements of the top 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.720
 the parts are very comfortable that is when we 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:07.210
 We put the body under the desk there 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:10.720
 access no need to reach for a button 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:13.270
 power indicator on 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:17.590
 everywhere 30 here we are our case one 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:22.920
 microphone headphone jack and beaten 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:25.510
 bathroom and button to activate the microphone 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.400
 such a simple set of characteristic 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.290
 budget for the body we can litter that we 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.590
 inside the body here is a block for 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:39.220
 drives 4 bays three of them have 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:41.410
 removable panel on the front panel and part 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.970
 can be installed here from 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.160
 lining ie you can install here 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.750
 2 and a half meter hard drive or 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.120
 for example solid state drive 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:53.140
 I have a small compact drives 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:55.690
 there is still a decline here we have two of it 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.190
 parts i.e. the mount here is screw 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:00.090
 there are no locks 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:02.530
 it is both a plus and a minus for 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.660
 enclosures ie fastenings on screws 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.070
 more reliable you can use eat 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:11.140
 regret us anti-vibration yet 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:13.450
 there is no lining and see what 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:16.690
 still we have got an adapter 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:18.910
 for use for cooling system 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.100
 that is, you can install a fan here 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.330
 for example and 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.400
 use for cooling or just 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:26.410
 deliver 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:30.370
 hard drive or solid-state and on the beach 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:33.030
 there will be an adapter as an adapter 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.920
 on the front panel for compact 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:39.070
 extenders 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:41.340
 there is an assembly instruction and a set 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:41.340
 screws 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.620
 another minus can be called 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:48.030
 plastic feet 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:51.239
 that is, there is no rubber cover 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:53.250
 no anti-vibration coating here 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:55.500
 speech and does not go but in principle is normal 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:04:02.730
 pulse well maybe will affect 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:05.040
 noise level compartment for power supply 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:07.799
 is at the top of the national 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.870
 can be two positions here with us 

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:11.189
 there is a small window but its size 

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:15.079
 not that big anyway 

00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:17.070
 will have for large cooling systems 

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:19.650
 motherboard take off and 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:24.060
 install already without being in 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:25.710
 the depth of our case is up to 17 millimeters 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:28.680
 that is, you can even become such here 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:30.930
 massive cooling system test this 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.060
 cooler could see earlier the deep look 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:35.580
 sharp 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:37.460
 that is, no problem her spouse is cooler and 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:40.080
 towers can also be mounted on 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:43.220
 motherboard will have to be removed and 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:45.780
 install the cooler separately if u 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:49.380
 cooling system is reinforcing 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:55.710
 board length 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:57.210
 video card hold it then 30 centimeters 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:00.720
 that is, you can even insert sets 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:02.669
 massive cards like that of 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:05.099
 chills passive cooling at 300 but 

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:07.680
 you mean she comes in here but a little bit 

00:05:05.099 --> 00:05:09.690
 take away the compartment on this is not a problem 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.400
 here for drives it is quite enough 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:17.509
 whether the budget fund will be collected from 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:17.509
 a lot of winchesters 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:23.890
 Overall we get quite interesting 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:27.460
 decision budget segment housing 

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:30.580
 deserves attention in more detail by 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:32.770
 This body can be read on the link 

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:34.210
 in the description for this video 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:36.760
 I will be happy to answer your questions 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:39.930
 comments subscribe to our channel 

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:39.930
 there is still a lot of interesting
