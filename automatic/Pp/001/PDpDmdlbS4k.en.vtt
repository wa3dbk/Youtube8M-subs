post another video on the making of this

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.920 
post another video on the making of this
there's<00:01:11.130> two<00:01:11.330> 120<00:01:12.330> millimeter<00:01:13.020> fans<00:01:13.409> on<00:01:13.860> top

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:14.930 
there's two 120 millimeter fans on top

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.480 
there's two 120 millimeter fans on top
being<00:01:15.930> powered<00:01:16.320> by<00:01:16.350> a<00:01:16.500> separate<00:01:17.009> power<00:01:17.159> supply

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
being powered by a separate power supply

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.649 
being powered by a separate power supply
and<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.119> pump<00:01:19.820> you<00:01:20.820> can<00:01:20.909> see<00:01:21.180> you<00:01:21.450> can't

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
and the pump you can see you can't

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.410 
and the pump you can see you can't
really<00:01:21.750> see<00:01:21.869> inside<00:01:22.350> but<00:01:22.979> it<00:01:23.270> circulates<00:01:24.270> the

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
really see inside but it circulates the

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.800 
really see inside but it circulates the
water<00:01:25.009> through<00:01:26.009> those<00:01:26.850> pipes<00:01:26.880> and<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.540> water

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
water through those pipes and the water

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.380 
water through those pipes and the water
runs<00:01:28.110> down<00:01:28.439> some<00:01:28.740> filters<00:01:29.189> and<00:01:29.610> it's<00:01:30.240> like

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
runs down some filters and it's like

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.149 
runs down some filters and it's like
kind<00:01:30.570> of<00:01:30.600> like<00:01:30.659> a<00:01:30.810> swamp<00:01:31.110> cooler<00:01:31.200> basically

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
kind of like a swamp cooler basically

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:38.060 
kind of like a swamp cooler basically
and<00:01:33.680> 4.8<00:01:34.680> gigahertz<00:01:35.810> I'm<00:01:36.810> idling<00:01:37.560> right<00:01:37.799> now

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
and 4.8 gigahertz I'm idling right now

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:45.319 
and 4.8 gigahertz I'm idling right now
at<00:01:42.020> 21<00:01:43.220> Celsius<00:01:44.220> you<00:01:44.460> know<00:01:44.549> it<00:01:44.790> goes<00:01:44.970> up<00:01:45.149> and

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
at 21 Celsius you know it goes up and

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.499 
at 21 Celsius you know it goes up and
down<00:01:45.420> my<00:01:46.290> lowest<00:01:46.799> point<00:01:46.860> hit<00:01:47.280> today<00:01:47.670> was<00:01:48.000> 18

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
down my lowest point hit today was 18

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.719 
down my lowest point hit today was 18
degrees<00:01:48.930> Celsius<00:01:49.530> an<00:01:49.680> ambient<00:01:50.189> temperature

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
degrees Celsius an ambient temperature

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.730 
degrees Celsius an ambient temperature
in<00:01:50.880> my<00:01:51.060> office<00:01:51.270> is<00:01:51.659> about<00:01:54.140> 75<00:01:55.140> degrees

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
in my office is about 75 degrees

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.050 
in my office is about 75 degrees
Fahrenheit<00:01:57.979> so

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
Fahrenheit so

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.600 
Fahrenheit so
I<00:02:00.180> just<00:02:00.720> wanted<00:02:00.960> to<00:02:00.990> show<00:02:01.200> you<00:02:01.229> guys<00:02:01.380> that<00:02:01.610> 4.8

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
I just wanted to show you guys that 4.8

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.889 
I just wanted to show you guys that 4.8

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
gigahertz at a hundred percent I keep

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.460 
gigahertz at a hundred percent I keep
this<00:02:07.110> thing<00:02:07.320> around<00:02:07.470> 50<00:02:08.220> to<00:02:08.250> 54<00:02:09.179> degrees

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
this thing around 50 to 54 degrees

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.479 
this thing around 50 to 54 degrees
Celsius<00:02:10.470> so<00:02:10.560> I'm<00:02:10.649> going<00:02:10.800> to<00:02:10.860> run<00:02:10.950> a<00:02:11.009> rendering

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
Celsius so I'm going to run a rendering

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.100 
Celsius so I'm going to run a rendering
right<00:02:11.760> now<00:02:12.000> I'm<00:02:12.660> not<00:02:12.750> going<00:02:12.900> to<00:02:12.989> run

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
right now I'm not going to run

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.080 
right now I'm not going to run
benchmarks<00:02:13.530> I'm<00:02:14.010> going<00:02:14.190> on<00:02:14.310> real-world<00:02:14.580> stuff

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
benchmarks I'm going on real-world stuff

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.509 
benchmarks I'm going on real-world stuff
because<00:02:15.660> I<00:02:15.870> have<00:02:16.440> a<00:02:16.470> job<00:02:16.830> and<00:02:17.040> actually<00:02:17.160> work

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:17.519 
because I have a job and actually work

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:21.140 
because I have a job and actually work
for<00:02:17.580> a<00:02:17.880> living<00:02:17.910> so<00:02:19.370> most<00:02:20.370> of<00:02:20.489> these<00:02:20.640> guys<00:02:20.910> that

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
for a living so most of these guys that

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.479 
for a living so most of these guys that
post<00:02:21.390> these<00:02:21.540> videos<00:02:24.019> just<00:02:25.019> run<00:02:25.489> diagnostics

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
post these videos just run diagnostics

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:28.309 
post these videos just run diagnostics
and<00:02:26.760> benchmarks<00:02:27.660> because<00:02:27.959> they<00:02:28.080> don't<00:02:28.260> have

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
and benchmarks because they don't have

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:30.559

anything<00:02:28.620> really<00:02:28.980> the<00:02:29.250> model<00:02:30.030> so<00:02:30.300> we're<00:02:30.450> going

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
anything really the model so we're going

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:33.890 
anything really the model so we're going
to<00:02:30.800> remember<00:02:31.800> this<00:02:32.010> scene<00:02:32.489> here<00:02:32.880> it's<00:02:33.450> a<00:02:33.569> 3d

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
to remember this scene here it's a 3d

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.000

model<00:02:34.140> up<00:02:34.350> and<00:02:34.530> working<00:02:34.890> on<00:02:36.620> and<00:02:37.620> we're<00:02:37.830> going

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
model up and working on and we're going

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:43.210 
model up and working on and we're going
to<00:02:38.040> render<00:02:38.280> it<00:02:38.549> on<00:02:39.080> high<00:02:41.540> crank<00:02:42.540> this<00:02:42.720> thing<00:02:42.780> up

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
to render it on high crank this thing up

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.039 
to render it on high crank this thing up
it's<00:02:44.220> going<00:02:44.400> to<00:02:44.459> start<00:02:44.780> working<00:02:45.780> on<00:02:45.900> the

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:46.049 
it's going to start working on the

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:50.990 
it's going to start working on the
rendering<00:02:46.500> and<00:02:47.160> it'll<00:02:47.970> bump<00:02:48.299> my<00:02:49.640> cpu<00:02:50.640> cores

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
rendering and it'll bump my cpu cores

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.809 
rendering and it'll bump my cpu cores
all<00:02:51.269> the<00:02:51.390> way<00:02:51.510> up<00:02:51.599> to<00:02:51.630> a<00:02:51.780> hundred<00:02:51.870> percent<00:02:52.819> and

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
all the way up to a hundred percent and

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:57.170 
all the way up to a hundred percent and
it<00:02:54.660> holds<00:02:55.019> it<00:02:55.349> 52<00:02:56.250> right<00:02:56.549> now<00:02:56.790> at<00:02:57.000> one<00:02:57.120> hundred

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
it holds it 52 right now at one hundred

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:03.800 
it holds it 52 right now at one hundred
percent<00:02:57.390> and<00:02:58.160> 4.8<00:02:59.160> gigahertz<00:03:02.030> should<00:03:03.030> make<00:03:03.660> it

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
percent and 4.8 gigahertz should make it

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.300 
percent and 4.8 gigahertz should make it
up<00:03:03.930> to<00:03:04.079> 54<00:03:04.980> degrees<00:03:05.190> at<00:03:05.640> the<00:03:05.820> max<00:03:07.070> so<00:03:08.070> it's

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
up to 54 degrees at the max so it's

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.240 
up to 54 degrees at the max so it's
still<00:03:09.019> working<00:03:10.019> i'm<00:03:10.320> running<00:03:10.620> three<00:03:10.890> monitors

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
still working i'm running three monitors

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.910 
still working i'm running three monitors
just<00:03:11.850> so<00:03:12.030> you<00:03:12.120> guys<00:03:12.269> know<00:03:12.739> gets<00:03:13.739> a<00:03:13.829> little

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
just so you guys know gets a little

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.240 
just so you guys know gets a little
blurry<00:03:14.190> sometimes<00:03:15.500> so<00:03:16.500> this<00:03:16.650> rendering<00:03:17.069> is

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
blurry sometimes so this rendering is

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.790 
blurry sometimes so this rendering is
going

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:21.800 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:35.730 

it's<00:03:22.190> working<00:03:22.460> away

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:35.740 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:37.920 

halfway<00:03:36.550> through<00:03:36.790> it<00:03:37.150> starts<00:03:37.480> working<00:03:37.630> on

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
halfway through it starts working on

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:41.700 
halfway through it starts working on
some<00:03:38.200> new<00:03:39.210> subsets<00:03:40.210> and<00:03:40.540> we're<00:03:41.260> still<00:03:41.530> at<00:03:41.680> a

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:41.710 
some new subsets and we're still at a

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:47.070 
some new subsets and we're still at a
hundred<00:03:41.950> percent<00:03:42.160> on<00:03:42.580> all<00:03:42.730> 8<00:03:42.940> cores<00:03:43.710> and<00:03:46.080> temps

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:47.080

almost<00:04:09.010> done<00:04:09.370> rendering<00:04:10.270> time<00:04:10.660> on<00:04:10.840> this

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:10.960 
almost done rendering time on this

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:18.990 
almost done rendering time on this
fairly<00:04:11.530> large<00:04:11.920> scene<00:04:12.370> has<00:04:12.550> only<00:04:12.760> been<00:04:18.000> one

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.000 
fairly large scene has only been one

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.170 
fairly large scene has only been one
minute<00:04:19.450> and<00:04:19.709> 40<00:04:20.709> seconds<00:04:21.190> so<00:04:21.520> far<00:04:21.960> almost<00:04:22.960> dead

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
minute and 40 seconds so far almost dead

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:28.220 
minute and 40 seconds so far almost dead
so<00:04:25.180> this<00:04:26.110> is<00:04:26.140> I<00:04:26.380> do<00:04:26.440> a<00:04:26.560> lot<00:04:26.740> of<00:04:26.770> structural<00:04:27.370> and

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:28.230 
so this is I do a lot of structural and

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:31.860 
so this is I do a lot of structural and
architectural<00:04:29.230> 3d<00:04:29.680> modeling<00:04:30.130> and<00:04:30.540> this<00:04:31.540> is<00:04:31.720> an

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:31.870 
architectural 3d modeling and this is an

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:36.150 
architectural 3d modeling and this is an
example<00:04:32.260> a<00:04:33.070> real-world<00:04:33.640> example<00:04:34.830> so<00:04:35.830> if<00:04:36.100> you

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:36.160 
example a real-world example so if you

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:38.940 
example a real-world example so if you
guys<00:04:36.310> want<00:04:36.550> some<00:04:36.730> more<00:04:36.760> information<00:04:37.770> on<00:04:38.770> my

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:38.950 
guys want some more information on my

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:40.710 
guys want some more information on my
cooling<00:04:39.340> system<00:04:39.700> that<00:04:39.730> i<00:04:39.940> developed<00:04:40.150> over

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:40.720 
cooling system that i developed over

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.360 
cooling system that i developed over
here<00:04:40.900> you<00:04:41.170> get<00:04:41.320> more<00:04:41.530> than<00:04:41.680> welcome<00:04:41.980> to<00:04:42.070> ask<00:04:42.130> me

here you get more than welcome to ask me

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:43.980 
here you get more than welcome to ask me
questions<00:04:42.850> and<00:04:43.120> see<00:04:43.330> if<00:04:43.450> i'm<00:04:43.600> going<00:04:43.750> to<00:04:43.810> post

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:43.990 
questions and see if i'm going to post

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:48.180 
questions and see if i'm going to post
another<00:04:44.230> video<00:04:44.910> it<00:04:45.910> only<00:04:46.060> cost<00:04:46.390> me<00:04:46.570> about<00:04:47.190> not

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:48.190 
another video it only cost me about not

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:50.300 
another video it only cost me about not
counting<00:04:48.610> the<00:04:48.760> waterblock<00:04:49.240> for<00:04:49.540> the<00:04:49.630> cpu

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:50.310 
counting the waterblock for the cpu

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:54.210 
counting the waterblock for the cpu
probably<00:04:51.570> sixty<00:04:52.570> dollars<00:04:52.990> and<00:04:53.320> materials<00:04:53.950> all

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:54.220 
probably sixty dollars and materials all

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:56.990 
probably sixty dollars and materials all
together<00:04:54.400> to<00:04:55.210> build<00:04:55.390> this<00:04:55.660> system<00:04:56.140> it's<00:04:56.560> big

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:57.000 
together to build this system it's big

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.480 
together to build this system it's big
but<00:04:58.000> i'm<00:04:58.270> going<00:04:58.420> to<00:04:58.540> add<00:04:58.660> on<00:04:58.900> my<00:04:59.110> video<00:05:00.010> cards

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:00.490 
but i'm going to add on my video cards

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:02.610 
but i'm going to add on my video cards
to<00:05:00.760> the<00:05:00.880> system<00:05:01.300> later<00:05:01.630> on<00:05:01.900> so<00:05:02.260> to<00:05:02.320> pull

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:02.620 
to the system later on so to pull

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:04.890 
to the system later on so to pull
everything
