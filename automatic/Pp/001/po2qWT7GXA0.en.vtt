approaching<00:00:47.370> towards<00:00:47.610> low<00:00:47.820> tide<00:00:48.059> so<00:00:48.350> it's

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
approaching towards low tide so it's

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.959 
approaching towards low tide so it's
becoming<00:00:49.649> increasingly<00:00:49.800> difficult<00:00:50.280> for<00:00:50.730> the

bigger and in more robust health this

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.480 
bigger and in more robust health this
time<00:01:27.689> it<00:01:27.840> was<00:01:27.990> basically<00:01:28.259> a<00:01:28.590> toddler<00:01:29.189> great

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
splashing water on its gills was it

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.289 
splashing water on its gills was it
weird<00:01:36.689> helping<00:01:37.200> a<00:01:37.439> creature<00:01:37.860> that

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:38.299 
weird helping a creature that

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:40.700 
weird helping a creature that
theoretically<00:01:39.299> could<00:01:39.689> hurt<00:01:40.470> somebody

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
theoretically could hurt somebody

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.010 
theoretically could hurt somebody
someday<00:01:41.100> um<00:01:41.520> it<00:01:41.970> didn't<00:01:42.299> in<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:42.540> moment<00:01:42.930> it

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
someday um it didn't in the moment it

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.539 
someday um it didn't in the moment it
didn't<00:01:43.259> seem<00:01:43.500> like<00:01:43.530> it<00:01:43.740> because<00:01:44.009> we<00:01:44.250> really

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
didn't seem like it because we really

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:45.980 
didn't seem like it because we really
just<00:01:44.670> wanted<00:01:44.939> to<00:01:45.060> keep<00:01:45.210> it<00:01:45.329> alive<00:01:45.600> we<00:01:45.780> felt

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
just wanted to keep it alive we felt

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.510 
just wanted to keep it alive we felt
