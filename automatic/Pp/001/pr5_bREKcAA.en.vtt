00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.180
 hello very good to all friends and people 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.980
 of youtube this time with a video 

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.510
 for one of the most important programs 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.670
 basic that we have to have our 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:24.570
 our pc and also one of the most 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.590
 used in this winrar and winrar is in 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.259
 this time we are going to download 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.279
 totally full so that they are not 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:31.110
 taking an annoying message that 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.680
 there are 30 trial days left because the 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:35.670
 trial period expired because it 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.800
 nothing more than this let's start the 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.360
 tutorial we direct you to what is the 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.579
 link in the click in the description of 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.500
 video which will take us to the page of 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.660
 rap official because the page 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.660
 official windows and not an intermediate to 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.030
 noodle to deny because here the page 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.380
 gives a recommended download that is 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.570
 depending on our world 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:57.850
 since if I leave you a link for 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:00.280
 mediafire or by mega equal I leave you the 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:03.730
 link for windows 8 64 of success has the 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:06.880
 windows 7 or windows xp or windows 8.1 as well 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:09.400
 that our page gives us the burden to 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:12.850
 our computer especially because the 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:14.320
 windows 8 64 bits and to download 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:18.780
 we simply click on this letter 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.780
 where the demo version gives us cycling 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:24.130
 if we are going to download 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.440
 Moreno does not take long the program does not 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.760
 it weighs practically nothing and the beast that 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.650
 have downloaded us we go to 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:32.140
 where he left one and a half me 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:34.270
 to create 22 and the dante download us 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.850
 will leave a file like this is worth this 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:40.300
 file right click execute as 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.680
 shooter we give him so this forgets me 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.150
 tell them that I do not have and is the second 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.340
 network of the moment by in that is a file 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:48.550
 rap but it appears in white I know not 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:50.229
 is installer and once here in this 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:52.119
 window let's leave this by default 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:54.460
 it is important that they leave it to you we give you 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:56.590
 click on install then so that it 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:59.259
 install it does not take practically nothing 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:01.210
 it's going to look like this we give you by accepting and 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:03.820
 This voucher will appear here 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.649
 we're just going to click on ready and 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.750
 we are united this window and ours 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:09.429
 but still can not use it because 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.350
 will tell us that we have 30 days of testing 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:13.030
 well then to leave it full we 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:15.280
 we turn again to the description of 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:18.160
 Video which some Telesp the report 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.480
 since it 's the windows registry 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.010
 this record we're just going 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.480
 acquiring it not to take 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.220
 mainly nothing 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.230
 this record is universal so you 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.390
 have windows 7 windows 8 or any 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.600
 windows 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.060
 register will work the same 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.830
 incoming will be full 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.150
 good since we had downloaded it 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.190
 we directed where we had saved it in 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.950
 my case I have it on the desk I do not know 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:42.650
 create this file 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:46.560
 we give a right click as administrator 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:48.900
 asks us for permission we say so 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.660
 and it will not say complete record so 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.580
 simple once we click on accept and 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.380
 we already have what it is to totally eliminate 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.840
 the full so that it is not bothering us 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.250
 with that annoying is a message we can 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.130
 check opening any file 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:04.530
 winrar and then I'm going to open this 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:06.510
 let's go to the help tab about 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:08.430
 of wing rap like the one that tells us that 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.080
 is registered here and tokic and I 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.720
 I think it's the guy who made the patch 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:15.930
 here as you want to call it and with this already 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:19.080
 we can this we can already use well 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:21.330
 give us that annoying message that 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:23.220
 We have 30 trial days left or we can 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:26.310
 so what may seem silly 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:28.010
 toffanin quite annoying that and then from 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:31.140
 this way we have it without having to 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:32.700
 bear all, well, no, guys, this has 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.140
 been quite short the video for 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.299
 no doubt I think it is one of the most 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:38.100
 of the most useful programs that all the 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:39.780
 world we have to have 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:42.000
 I hope you liked it if it has been 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.950
 so they stopped liking and leaving a 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.710
 comment saying what they thought and 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.570
 If you want, you can go through the 

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:51.030
 rest nor channel and indecisions like 

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:54.590
 If your customers this has been all we 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.590
 we see for the next goodbye 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
 and
