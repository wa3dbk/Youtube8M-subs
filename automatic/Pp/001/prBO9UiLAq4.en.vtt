00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149

because<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:48.840> pens<00:01:49.110> of<00:01:49.259> two<00:01:49.439> was<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:49.920> 1st

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
because the pens of two was the 1st

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.730 
because the pens of two was the 1st
Panzer<00:01:51.240> tank<00:01:51.509> to<00:01:52.110> be<00:01:52.229> equipped<00:01:52.560> with<00:01:52.590> the

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
Panzer tank to be equipped with the

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.149 
Panzer tank to be equipped with the
radio<00:01:53.270> as<00:01:54.270> a<00:01:54.450> nice<00:01:54.720> seat<00:01:55.049> that<00:01:55.320> can<00:01:55.590> hinge<00:01:55.890> back

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
radio as a nice seat that can hinge back

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.910 
radio as a nice seat that can hinge back
not<00:01:56.520> too<00:01:56.670> far<00:01:56.939> because<00:01:57.090> of<00:01:57.420> the<00:01:57.570> little<00:01:58.560> stuff

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
not too far because of the little stuff

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.359 
not too far because of the little stuff
thing<00:01:59.219> as<00:01:59.549> joysticks<00:02:00.439> you<00:02:01.439> get<00:02:01.649> actually<00:02:02.100> see

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
thing as joysticks you get actually see

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.590 
thing as joysticks you get actually see
through<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:04.219> window<00:02:05.219> I<00:02:05.250> guess<00:02:05.729> because<00:02:06.210> just

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
through the window I guess because just

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
one but it looks like one giant one or

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:09.910 
one but it looks like one giant one or
two<00:02:08.759> phones

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
two phones

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.199 
two phones
um<00:02:10.060> as<00:02:11.060> just<00:02:11.420> like<00:02:11.599> a<00:02:13.060> transmission<00:02:14.060> or

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209

side but see that I haven't done those

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:46.050 
side but see that I haven't done those
parts<00:05:42.980> yet<00:05:43.220> but<00:05:43.550> and<00:05:43.930> there's<00:05:44.930> this<00:05:45.320> one

parts yet but and there's this one

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:49.840 
parts yet but and there's this one
almost<00:05:47.060> exactly<00:05:47.510> the<00:05:47.600> same<00:05:47.660> size<00:05:48.500> because<00:05:48.980> i

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:49.850 
almost exactly the same size because i

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:57.330 
almost exactly the same size because i
use<00:05:51.580> Lego<00:05:52.580> brick<00:05:53.980> their<00:05:54.980> legal<00:05:55.870> flat<00:05:56.870> or
