00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:35.710
 tutorial we will work with the edition 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:38.210
 of images and the and edition of forms 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:42.409
 for which we are going to use this 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:45.739
 good text template you for 

00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:47.600

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:56.820
 goes towards 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.340
 the option illustrations of the tapes of 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:03.870
 options accordingly in image 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:06.770
 click image and I immediately 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:10.260
 shows a folder where I have the 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:13.440
 images very well of them I will choose 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:18.150
 any image that I have at hand and 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:19.140
 I click on insert very well to 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.470
 continuation 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.630
 once you have inserted the image 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:29.210
 to be able to manipulate the image you 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:31.950
 must must go to the option 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:34.710
 to adjust text 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:38.090
 I click on adjust text and choose 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:41.100
 any of the options here 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.810
 appear any of them in function 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.110
 to your needs 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:49.829
 remember that each one is described 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:54.649
 which is what function does 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:54.649
 this case we will choose the option 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:03.060
 square very well from there I 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.430
 I can therefore transfer this image to 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:08.340
 any place 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.629
 then I return to adjust text and I click 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.790
 in the option 

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:17.060
 modify adjustment points I click on 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:19.659
 the option to modify set points that 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:23.310
 will this allow me to modify their 

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:25.349
 vertices or nodes 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:29.459
 as you will realize that activated this 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:33.180
 when the node the nodes are transformed 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:35.640
 to black color by holding down the 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:40.060
 mouse pointer over any of 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:44.010
 the nodes dragged towards the center 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.010
 and you observe 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:53.819
 what I created all this has been created 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:58.379
 hopefully the text is like on 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:03:01.769

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:04.560
 You can insert the same way you

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:13.560
 you can insert 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.560
 for example I can insert 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.690

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:26.450

 I activate the format menu and in it the 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:49.879
 possibilities of being able to modify 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:49.879

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:58.330

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:13.150
 I can change color as if 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.150
 I would try 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:17.490
 of any text 

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:24.410
 very well 

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:27.960
 in the same way you can do what

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:54.320
 I'm going to insert a form one way 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:57.380
 anybody for example heart shape there 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:05:00.530

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:14.750
 images you will realize that it is 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:17.360
 selected because both images are 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:19.970

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:15.580
 the shape of the heart like this picture 

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:17.760

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:26.370
 click on shapes you can change 

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:30.500
 for example the outline this already 

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:33.500
