00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 good serves this point let's say third 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.450
 here is six points from the colon 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.790
 that is, taking into account the streak of 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.990
 parties that do not lose layer that has 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.059
 a positive side 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:15.310
 we had in action to win 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:18.630
 we want that 

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:18.630
 that we play better than the rival 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:23.020
 that we had for having scored a goal 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:25.030
 and it 's good in the end it ended a pattern of 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:27.490
 a match in which 

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:29.620
 we have searched during the 90s 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:31.240
 minutes we could not mark the ones that have 

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:34.570
 improved in the last dates that by 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:37.790
 at least they keep adding up nothing we think that 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:39.980
 we are when pretty well 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.450
 the other day with Argentines we have the 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.520
 misfortune that they do not tie on the hour 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:46.520
 that we think yes very good match that 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.930
 we deserved to win today also so 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.180
 now comes the superclassic let's hope 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.340
 to be able to add to three not yourselves 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.320
 they are already in the weather and they are with their heads 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.120
 put on river after past the 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.700
 match of quilmes that match can be 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:01.489
 see what match one can imagine the 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:04.220
 next Sunday we wanted to win 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:05.810
 today and we believe that we have made a match 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.830
 pretty good we have controlled the 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.830
 ball during the whole game 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.160
 now and we need to be a little more 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:15.490
 clear near the rival area but that I 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.590
 they have defended quite well 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:20.259
 to work during the week and have the 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.790
 team that arms our coach to 

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:26.280
 win on Sunday who arrives better 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:26.280
 face up that the classic 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:33.150
 and all the same is a cute match 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.590
 where we will try to enjoy where 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:38.409
 we know that our stadium will be 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.509
 full in our favor and let's hope 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:41.890
 be able to take advantage of it not only three 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:44.469
 points it occurs to me that if they win the 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.659
 Sunday an illusion at the end of the 

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:48.609
 championship is added so that mouth arrives 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:51.640
 at the end of the tournament with a chance to leave 

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:53.579
 champion are not three points nothing more 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.810
 we each party want to win 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.490
 we still have to play against colom 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.670
 we know in his court that he is 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:02.619
 doing good and good while 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.509
 points we should have the illusion of 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:06.369
 to be able to reach it last as you come 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:09.240
 feeling that you've already played four games 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:09.240
 consecutive holder 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:16.070
 there is a lot of talk 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:19.310
 that's why the selection of Marin has 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:23.950
 20 years of clay bronze iron 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.950
 great the guys get on the top
