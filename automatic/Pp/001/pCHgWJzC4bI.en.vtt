about<00:01:49.070> the<00:01:49.340> warranty<00:01:49.760> at<00:01:50.270> that<00:01:50.510> point<00:01:50.810> then

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:51.230 
about the warranty at that point then

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:52.960 
about the warranty at that point then
you<00:01:51.470> might<00:01:51.740> want<00:01:51.980> to<00:01:52.070> just<00:01:52.220> go<00:01:52.340> ahead<00:01:52.460> and<00:01:52.610> you

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970 
you might want to just go ahead and you

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.080 
you might want to just go ahead and you
know<00:01:53.060> bypass<00:01:53.570> the<00:01:53.900> der<00:01:54.890> mileage<00:01:55.220> tuning<00:01:55.610> and

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
know bypass the der mileage tuning and

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.350 
know bypass the der mileage tuning and
go<00:01:56.240> put<00:01:56.420> on<00:01:56.450> something<00:01:56.780> else<00:01:57.050> now<00:01:58.040> another

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.360 
go put on something else now another

question<00:01:59.360> I<00:01:59.450> get<00:01:59.690> is<00:01:59.840> you<00:02:00.260> know<00:02:00.350> how<00:02:00.590> much

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
question I get is you know how much

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.590 
question I get is you know how much
horsepower<00:02:00.890> how<00:02:01.430> much<00:02:01.610> torque<00:02:01.910> well<00:02:02.450> we

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
horsepower how much torque well we

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.240 
horsepower how much torque well we
figure<00:02:02.990> because<00:02:03.170> we<00:02:03.260> do<00:02:03.410> variations<00:02:03.770> in<00:02:04.220> the

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
figure because we do variations in the

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.760 
figure because we do variations in the
tunes<00:02:04.580> we<00:02:05.090> figured<00:02:05.450> that<00:02:05.480> we're<00:02:05.690> around<00:02:05.840> 60<00:02:06.320> 65

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
tunes we figured that we're around 60 65

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.350 
tunes we figured that we're around 60 65
horsepower<00:02:07.040> about<00:02:07.520> 100<00:02:07.850> foot<00:02:08.000> pounds<00:02:08.300> of

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
horsepower about 100 foot pounds of

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.479 
horsepower about 100 foot pounds of
torque<00:02:08.420> and<00:02:08.750> these<00:02:09.170> have<00:02:09.289> been<00:02:09.440> dynode<00:02:09.950> before

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:10.489 
torque and these have been dynode before

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:11.649 
torque and these have been dynode before
but<00:02:10.700> you<00:02:10.789> know<00:02:10.909> we<00:02:11.030> go<00:02:11.150> want<00:02:11.299> to<00:02:11.329> make<00:02:11.510> some

00:02:11.649 --> 00:02:11.659 
but you know we go want to make some

00:02:11.659 --> 00:02:13.089 
but you know we go want to make some
tweaks<00:02:11.840> here<00:02:12.200> and<00:02:12.260> there<00:02:12.409> so<00:02:12.739> it<00:02:12.890> might<00:02:13.069> very

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:13.099 
tweaks here and there so it might very

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:15.160 
tweaks here and there so it might very
little<00:02:13.670> bit<00:02:13.849> one<00:02:14.810> of<00:02:14.870> the

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
little bit one of the

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:16.990 
little bit one of the
I'm<00:02:15.470> asked<00:02:15.830> on<00:02:15.920> that<00:02:16.069> is<00:02:16.220> what<00:02:16.580> will<00:02:16.730> it<00:02:16.849> do<00:02:16.970> to

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
I'm asked on that is what will it do to

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.479 
I'm asked on that is what will it do to
my<00:02:17.240> transmission<00:02:18.020> how<00:02:18.440> will<00:02:18.680> my<00:02:18.800> transmission

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:19.489 
my transmission how will my transmission

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:22.360 
my transmission how will my transmission
react<00:02:19.790> to<00:02:20.000> that<00:02:20.150> well<00:02:20.780> the<00:02:21.590> allison

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
react to that well the allison

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.040 
react to that well the allison
transmission<00:02:22.520> is<00:02:23.090> probably<00:02:23.420> one<00:02:23.630> of<00:02:23.660> the<00:02:23.750> best

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
transmission is probably one of the best

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.199 
transmission is probably one of the best
transmissions<00:02:24.739> ever<00:02:24.950> made<00:02:25.310> out<00:02:25.340> there<00:02:25.730> it

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:26.209 
transmissions ever made out there it

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:29.229 
transmissions ever made out there it
adapts<00:02:26.870> to<00:02:26.930> the<00:02:27.200> extra<00:02:27.830> power<00:02:28.010> real<00:02:28.430> easy<00:02:28.670> as

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:29.239 
adapts to the extra power real easy as

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:31.089 
adapts to the extra power real easy as
long<00:02:29.630> as<00:02:29.660> you're<00:02:29.870> staying<00:02:30.140> well<00:02:30.470> under<00:02:30.739> 100

00:02:31.089 --> 00:02:31.099 
long as you're staying well under 100

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:32.470 
long as you're staying well under 100
horsepower<00:02:31.400> I've<00:02:31.700> even<00:02:31.970> talked<00:02:32.209> to<00:02:32.330> people

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
horsepower I've even talked to people

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.170 
horsepower I've even talked to people
that<00:02:32.720> build<00:02:33.140> like<00:02:34.069> suncoast<00:02:34.550> transmissions

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
that build like suncoast transmissions

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.330 
that build like suncoast transmissions
out<00:02:35.390> of<00:02:35.630> Florida<00:02:36.020> I've<00:02:36.319> talked<00:02:36.620> to<00:02:36.830> the<00:02:37.160> owner

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
said when do I need to come see you when

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.750 
said when do I need to come see you when
it<00:02:41.959> comes<00:02:42.170> to<00:02:42.350> power<00:02:42.530> says<00:02:42.920> you<00:02:43.130> know<00:02:43.250> long<00:02:43.580> as

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
it comes to power says you know long as

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.670 
it comes to power says you know long as
you<00:02:43.850> stay<00:02:44.030> under<00:02:44.269> 100<00:02:44.599> horsepower<00:02:44.840> is<00:02:45.410> that

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
you stay under 100 horsepower is that

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.020 
you stay under 100 horsepower is that
you<00:02:45.800> don't<00:02:45.920> need<00:02:46.130> me<00:02:46.280> you<00:02:46.489> start<00:02:46.700> going<00:02:46.849> over

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
you don't need me you start going over

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.240 
you don't need me you start going over
100<00:02:47.480> horsepower<00:02:47.780> he<00:02:48.380> said<00:02:48.650> something's<00:02:49.069> going

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
100 horsepower he said something's going

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.009 
100 horsepower he said something's going
to<00:02:49.340> give<00:02:49.489> in<00:02:49.640> the<00:02:49.700> metal<00:02:49.970> somewhere<00:02:50.360> so<00:02:50.569> the
