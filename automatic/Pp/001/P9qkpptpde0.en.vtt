marine habitats I actually spent the
half<00:03:16.540> the<00:03:16.690> dive<00:03:16.900> chasing<00:03:17.350> around<00:03:17.500> we<00:03:17.560> put<00:03:17.740> the

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
half the dive chasing around we put the

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:19.830 
half the dive chasing around we put the
Glen<00:03:18.100> cam<00:03:18.370> on<00:03:18.580> his<00:03:18.700> back<00:03:18.940> and<00:03:19.180> he<00:03:19.570> kept<00:03:19.810> running

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
Glen cam on his back and he kept running

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.540 
Glen cam on his back and he kept running
in<00:03:20.200> the<00:03:20.320> structure<00:03:20.800> so<00:03:20.980> our<00:03:21.040> camera<00:03:21.370> kept

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:21.550 
in the structure so our camera kept

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:23.370 
in the structure so our camera kept
falling<00:03:22.240> back<00:03:22.420> so<00:03:22.720> we're<00:03:23.110> gonna<00:03:23.230> have<00:03:23.350> some

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
falling back so we're gonna have some

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.220
