teleport to a player or teleport to a
team<00:00:38.340> member<00:00:38.730> at<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:39.000> moment<00:00:39.329> it's<00:00:39.510> pretty

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
team member at the moment it's pretty

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.110 
team member at the moment it's pretty
cool<00:00:40.140> actually<00:00:40.200> I<00:00:40.739> like<00:00:41.010> this<00:00:41.219> idea<00:00:41.460> of<00:00:41.969> the

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
cool actually I like this idea of the

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.529 
cool actually I like this idea of the
menu<00:00:42.450> and<00:00:42.719> well<00:00:43.500> if<00:00:43.710> he<00:00:43.890> just<00:00:44.820> hit<00:00:44.910> one<00:00:45.270> here

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
menu and well if he just hit one here

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.200 
menu and well if he just hit one here
and<00:00:45.750> then<00:00:46.410> we<00:00:46.590> can<00:00:46.620> see<00:00:46.950> there's<00:00:47.430> only<00:00:47.670> me<00:00:47.969> here

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
and then we can see there's only me here

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.959 
and then we can see there's only me here
on<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.510> server<00:00:48.750> right<00:00:49.020> now<00:00:49.320> and<00:00:49.680> I<00:00:50.250> don't<00:00:50.550> have

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
on the server right now and I don't have

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.939 
on the server right now and I don't have
any<00:00:51.120> friends<00:00:51.660> so<00:00:51.690> I<00:00:51.840> can<00:00:52.170> show<00:00:52.379> you<00:00:52.440> how<00:00:52.920> to

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
any friends so I can show you how to

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.770 
any friends so I can show you how to
teleport<00:00:53.309> to<00:00:53.699> someone<00:00:54.030> but<00:00:54.210> how<00:00:54.390> that<00:00:54.570> would

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
teleport to someone but how that would

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.650 
teleport to someone but how that would
work<00:00:54.809> is<00:00:55.170> actually<00:00:55.350> you<00:00:55.949> would<00:00:56.100> just<00:00:56.280> go<00:00:56.660> click

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
work is actually you would just go click

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.680 
work is actually you would just go click
the<00:00:58.020> head<00:00:58.260> here<00:00:58.559> it's<00:00:58.800> always<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.460> skin<00:00:59.789> but

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
the head here it's always the skin but

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.479 
the head here it's always the skin but
my<00:01:00.870> head<00:01:01.109> is<00:01:01.140> a<00:01:01.260> standard<00:01:01.770> skin<00:01:02.039> so<00:01:02.219> you<00:01:02.250> don't

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
my head is a standard skin so you don't

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.460 
my head is a standard skin so you don't
see<00:01:02.670> that<00:01:02.850> but<00:01:03.030> normally<00:01:03.600> it<00:01:03.660> would<00:01:03.840> be<00:01:03.989> like<00:01:04.199> a

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
see that but normally it would be like a

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.070 
see that but normally it would be like a
skin<00:01:04.979> you<00:01:05.339> know<00:01:05.369> like<00:01:06.060> a<00:01:06.090> doc<00:01:06.390> am<00:01:06.600> skin<00:01:06.960> or

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
skin you know like a doc am skin or

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.600 
skin you know like a doc am skin or
something<00:01:07.409> you<00:01:07.530> just<00:01:07.770> hit<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.130> number<00:01:08.280> that

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
something you just hit the number that

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.240 
something you just hit the number that
is<00:01:08.729> there<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:09.210> then<00:01:09.720> you<00:01:10.200> will<00:01:10.530> teleport<00:01:10.950> to

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
is there and then you will teleport to

is there and then you will teleport to
that<00:01:11.400> person<00:01:11.760> to<00:01:12.119> go<00:01:12.299> out<00:01:12.510> of<00:01:12.869> this<00:01:12.990> menu<00:01:13.229> again

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
that person to go out of this menu again

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.070 
that person to go out of this menu again
just<00:01:13.830> hit<00:01:13.979> nine<00:01:14.310> and<00:01:14.580> well<00:01:15.270> there's<00:01:15.720> another

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.999 
member which would basically pretty much
be<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:20.909> same<00:01:21.060> thing<00:01:21.479> but<00:01:21.900> for<00:01:22.140> team<00:01:22.619> members

these cool slime block seal with a
piston<00:01:31.380> and<00:01:31.560> that<00:01:31.710> site<00:01:32.159> ways<00:01:32.490> it<00:01:32.729> is<00:01:33.290> going<00:01:34.290> to

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
piston and that site ways it is going to

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.310 
piston and that site ways it is going to
just<00:01:34.770> uh<00:01:35.040> long<00:01:35.759> Qi<00:01:36.090> off<00:01:36.210> a<00:01:36.450> little<00:01:36.630> bit<00:01:36.900> not

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
just uh long Qi off a little bit not

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.069 
just uh long Qi off a little bit not
much<00:01:37.350> but<00:01:37.979> a<00:01:38.040> little<00:01:38.130> bit<00:01:38.520> and<00:01:38.670> more<00:01:39.180> as<00:01:39.509> if<00:01:39.900> you

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
much but a little bit and more as if you

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.530 
much but a little bit and more as if you
would<00:01:40.259> be<00:01:40.409> doing<00:01:40.560> it<00:01:40.890> with<00:01:41.329> normal<00:01:42.329> stone

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
would be doing it with normal stone

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.289 
would be doing it with normal stone
block<00:01:42.810> so<00:01:43.049> once<00:01:43.350> again<00:01:43.500> boom<00:01:44.250> and<00:01:44.670> we<00:01:45.000> fly

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
block so once again boom and we fly

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
so let's start off with the damage now

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.770 
so let's start off with the damage now
damage<00:02:16.980> we<00:02:17.340> got<00:02:17.520> two<00:02:17.760> more<00:02:17.970> options<00:02:18.600> right

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
damage we got two more options right

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.610 
damage we got two more options right
here<00:02:18.840> and<00:02:19.260> that<00:02:20.130> is<00:02:20.370> a<00:02:20.670> buffer<00:02:21.300> and<00:02:21.720> that<00:02:22.470> is

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
here and that is a buffer and that is

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.740 
here and that is a buffer and that is
amount<00:02:23.040> now<00:02:23.280> now<00:02:23.850> it<00:02:23.910> is<00:02:24.030> pretty<00:02:24.300> much<00:02:24.390> you<00:02:24.570> can

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
amount now now it is pretty much you can

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.160 
amount now now it is pretty much you can
just<00:02:24.930> set<00:02:25.200> how<00:02:25.770> much<00:02:26.370> damage<00:02:27.090> it<00:02:27.450> is<00:02:27.690> going<00:02:28.050> to

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
just set how much damage it is going to

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.980 
just set how much damage it is going to
take<00:02:28.200> I<00:02:28.590> think<00:02:29.190> this<00:02:29.340> is<00:02:29.520> in<00:02:29.670> half<00:02:29.910> arts<00:02:30.360> so

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
take I think this is in half arts so

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:34.970 
take I think this is in half arts so
well<00:02:31.470> if<00:02:31.680> you<00:02:31.800> pass<00:02:32.010> it<00:02:32.250> obviously<00:02:33.110> so<00:02:34.110> yeah

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
well if you pass it obviously so yeah

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.170 
well if you pass it obviously so yeah
two<00:02:35.850> that's<00:02:36.630> just<00:02:36.810> uh<00:02:37.080> yeah<00:02:37.530> it<00:02:37.710> says<00:02:37.950> of<00:02:38.180> two

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
two that's just uh yeah it says of two

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.140 
two that's just uh yeah it says of two
per<00:02:39.660> block<00:02:39.960> down<00:02:40.380> there<00:02:40.710> and<00:02:40.890> that's<00:02:41.850> pretty

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
per block down there and that's pretty

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.240 
per block down there and that's pretty
good<00:02:42.330> so<00:02:42.660> it's<00:02:42.930> gonna<00:02:43.170> give<00:02:43.350> you<00:02:43.440> damage<00:02:43.800> once

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
out how you would move out and as you

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.710 
out how you would move out and as you
can<00:02:49.290> see<00:02:49.320> right<00:02:49.500> there<00:02:49.920> I<00:02:50.130> figured<00:02:50.820> how<00:02:51.360> well<00:02:51.570> i

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
can see right there I figured how well i

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.010 
can see right there I figured how well i
put<00:02:51.990> in<00:02:52.110> a<00:02:52.230> warning<00:02:52.530> wage<00:02:53.490> is<00:02:53.820> going<00:02:54.630> to<00:02:54.750> tell

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
you that there's something wrong when

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.040

you<00:02:57.900> go<00:02:58.080> within<00:02:58.730> two<00:02:59.730> blocks<00:02:59.940> or<00:03:00.330> five<00:03:00.750> I<00:03:01.020> think

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
you go within two blocks or five I think

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:04.160 
you go within two blocks or five I think
I<00:03:01.560> made<00:03:02.100> it<00:03:02.250> five<00:03:02.520> and<00:03:02.790> the<00:03:03.450> screen<00:03:03.960> is<00:03:03.990> just

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
I made it five and the screen is just

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.350 
I made it five and the screen is just
gonna<00:03:04.440> turn<00:03:04.650> red<00:03:04.920> but<00:03:05.190> as<00:03:05.400> you<00:03:05.610> can<00:03:05.730> see<00:03:05.940> you

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
gonna turn red but as you can see you

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.810 
gonna turn red but as you can see you
cannot<00:03:06.690> pass<00:03:07.020> this<00:03:07.380> so<00:03:07.740> I<00:03:07.950> don't<00:03:08.160> know<00:03:08.520> how<00:03:08.760> the

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
cannot pass this so I don't know how the

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.790 
cannot pass this so I don't know how the
damage<00:03:09.360> things<00:03:09.750> should<00:03:09.990> work<00:03:10.020> i<00:03:10.380> can<00:03:10.560> show<00:03:10.770> you

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
damage things should work i can show you

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:15.470 
damage things should work i can show you
in<00:03:11.340> creative<00:03:12.300> um<00:03:12.510> in<00:03:13.290> survival<00:03:14.010> I<00:03:14.100> mean<00:03:14.360> how<00:03:15.360> it

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
in creative um in survival I mean how it

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.210 
in creative um in survival I mean how it
looks<00:03:15.720> but<00:03:15.840> still<00:03:16.230> we're<00:03:16.470> not<00:03:16.680> losing<00:03:16.920> any

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
looks but still we're not losing any

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.060 
looks but still we're not losing any
damage<00:03:17.610> by<00:03:17.850> walking<00:03:18.660> on<00:03:18.810> the<00:03:18.930> edge<00:03:18.960> here<00:03:19.140> now

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
damage by walking on the edge here now

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:22.010 
damage by walking on the edge here now
we<00:03:20.640> might<00:03:20.790> figure<00:03:21.060> that<00:03:21.390> out<00:03:21.420> later<00:03:21.600> but

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:22.020 
we might figure that out later but

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:24.680 
we might figure that out later but
that's<00:03:22.410> it<00:03:23.130> for<00:03:23.550> pretty<00:03:23.910> much<00:03:23.970> the<00:03:24.060> damage<00:03:24.510> and

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
that's it for pretty much the damage and

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.040 
that's it for pretty much the damage and
i'm<00:03:24.960> gonna<00:03:25.170> show<00:03:25.260> you<00:03:25.670> what<00:03:26.670> you<00:03:26.850> can<00:03:27.050> figure

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.050 
i'm gonna show you what you can figure

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:31.880 
i'm gonna show you what you can figure
out<00:03:28.170> for<00:03:28.800> the<00:03:30.080> for<00:03:31.080> the<00:03:31.110> warning<00:03:31.440> thing

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
out for the for the warning thing

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.460 
out for the for the warning thing
alright<00:03:32.610> so<00:03:32.910> the<00:03:33.240> warning<00:03:33.600> thing<00:03:33.870> is<00:03:34.020> pretty

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:34.470 
alright so the warning thing is pretty

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.530 
alright so the warning thing is pretty
easy<00:03:34.710> at<00:03:35.250> home<00:03:35.310> if<00:03:35.670> you<00:03:35.850> type<00:03:36.060> world<00:03:36.270> bore

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
now there's distance and there is time

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:45.110 
now there's distance and there is time
now<00:03:42.650> distance<00:03:43.650> is<00:03:43.800> what<00:03:43.980> I<00:03:44.010> got<00:03:44.400> going<00:03:44.430> Iraq

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.930 
now distance is what I got going Iraq
now<00:03:45.360> so<00:03:45.750> that's<00:03:46.620> basically<00:03:46.800> you<00:03:47.250> just<00:03:47.280> enter

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
the amount of blocks you wanna be well

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.680 
the amount of blocks you wanna be well
have<00:03:51.300> a<00:03:51.330> players<00:03:51.870> receive<00:03:52.680> a<00:03:52.710> warning<00:03:53.130> and

ten<00:03:57.270> blocks<00:03:57.510> away<00:03:57.840> so<00:03:57.900> let's<00:03:58.440> try<00:03:58.710> this<00:03:58.770> out

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 
ten blocks away so let's try this out

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.700 
ten blocks away so let's try this out
and<00:03:59.370> as<00:04:00.030> you<00:04:00.180> can<00:04:00.360> see<00:04:00.390> the<00:04:00.900> screen<00:04:01.200> is<00:04:01.350> um

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:01.710 
and as you can see the screen is um

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:04.400 
and as you can see the screen is um
slowly<00:04:02.550> but<00:04:02.700> surely<00:04:02.760> getting<00:04:03.360> rat<00:04:04.020> here<00:04:04.380> a

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.410 
slowly but surely getting rat here a

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:07.040 
slowly but surely getting rat here a
little<00:04:04.620> bit<00:04:04.830> starting<00:04:05.700> here<00:04:05.970> and<00:04:06.270> yeah<00:04:06.840> that's

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:07.050 
little bit starting here and yeah that's

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:09.560 
little bit starting here and yeah that's
pretty<00:04:07.200> much<00:04:07.410> just<00:04:07.530> how<00:04:08.100> it<00:04:08.400> works<00:04:08.880> and<00:04:09.030> then

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:09.570 
pretty much just how it works and then

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:12.110 
pretty much just how it works and then
we<00:04:10.050> got<00:04:10.260> distance<00:04:10.830> now<00:04:11.070> what<00:04:11.340> distance<00:04:11.820> does

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
we got distance now what distance does

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.380 
we got distance now what distance does
know<00:04:12.930> then<00:04:13.320> we<00:04:13.560> got<00:04:13.770> time<00:04:14.220> what<00:04:14.760> time<00:04:15.060> does<00:04:15.330> it

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.390 
know then we got time what time does it

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:18.860 
know then we got time what time does it
just<00:04:16.190> tells<00:04:17.190> you<00:04:17.370> if<00:04:17.549> you<00:04:17.700> were<00:04:17.880> like<00:04:18.090> three

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
just tells you if you were like three

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:20.390 
just tells you if you were like three
seconds<00:04:19.380> away<00:04:19.500> maybe

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
seconds away maybe

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:25.520 
seconds away maybe
Oh<00:04:20.459> actually<00:04:21.560> free<00:04:23.389> okay<00:04:24.389> so<00:04:24.449> set<00:04:25.259> world

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
Oh actually free okay so set world

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.749 
Oh actually free okay so set world
border<00:04:25.949> warning<00:04:27.350> 23<00:04:28.350> seconds<00:04:28.889> it<00:04:29.070> says<00:04:29.310> and<00:04:29.580> if

00:04:29.749 --> 00:04:29.759 
border warning 23 seconds it says and if

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:33.590 
border warning 23 seconds it says and if
we<00:04:30.180> move<00:04:30.449> towards<00:04:30.930> it<00:04:31.110> you<00:04:31.830> can<00:04:31.979> see<00:04:32.220> um<00:04:32.600> well

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 
we move towards it you can see um well

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.950 
we move towards it you can see um well
it<00:04:34.050> should<00:04:34.530> probably<00:04:35.100> take<00:04:35.340> us<00:04:35.370> three<00:04:36.210> seconds

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
it should probably take us three seconds

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.650 
it should probably take us three seconds
to<00:04:37.169> now<00:04:37.350> go<00:04:37.650> to<00:04:37.710> the<00:04:38.009> World<00:04:38.699> Order<00:04:39.210> I<00:04:39.360> think

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:39.660 
to now go to the World Order I think

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:42.890 
to now go to the World Order I think
this<00:04:39.810> is<00:04:39.870> normal<00:04:40.139> walking<00:04:40.620> though<00:04:41.039> and<00:04:41.900> yeah

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
this is normal walking though and yeah

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:44.930 
this is normal walking though and yeah
that's<00:04:43.050> pretty<00:04:43.199> much<00:04:43.440> how<00:04:43.800> the<00:04:44.070> time<00:04:44.520> limit<00:04:44.880> on

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:44.940 
that's pretty much how the time limit on

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:47.240 
that's pretty much how the time limit on
the<00:04:45.150> ellen<00:04:45.780> this<00:04:45.990> works<00:04:46.259> and<00:04:46.590> this<00:04:46.919> is<00:04:47.100> pretty
