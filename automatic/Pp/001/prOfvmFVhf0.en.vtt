00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:09.250
 our recipe today is a ceviche of 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:11.980
 mushrooms the ingredients are a 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:14.889
 cup of red onion in pens 4 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:17.349
 lemons a cup of coriander finely 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:20.529
 chopped 2 cups of fresh mushrooms 

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:23.290
 finely chopped three quarters cup 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:25.349
 of tomato sauce salt and pepper 

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:25.349
 taste 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.280
 the list claudia hands to work with the 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.199
 mushroom ceviche without something I can 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.550
 serve tell me we have the 

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:48.660
 ingredients that is the most important 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:51.170
 we have red onion we are going to work 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.170
 in pen 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.309
 truman because the red onion and not the 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.980
 white for example because you andreas 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.629
 better taste and the cebiches and 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.989
 sea products is better to work 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:06.589
 the tips of sheds for the taste for 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.589
 taste 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:12.899
 It is of very good quality 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:15.149
 because the other onion is very good but 

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:19.439
 I think that onion should carry 

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:22.500
 as its function for example the white me 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:27.509
 I really like how to stop making salads 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:31.170
 and this the board I like a lot like 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:33.600
 to make stews to marinate right 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.299
 I like it a lot to stop 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:39.800
 said for the cebiches is a flavor 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:42.710
 much stronger if it is very strong 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:46.100
 and people have confidence because 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:48.500
 Itchy eyes is not like knowing it 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:51.530
 work if the shape of that cut to me 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.450
 I like really gives you as a 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.040
 special touch to the cebiches and very 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.080
 different where it was finally chopped 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.570
 if it can also be done finally 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:02.330
 chopped many people do not like like 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:06.280
 today that flavor of the onion and is 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:10.929
 then the working 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:12.670
 pica of here let's catch 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:16.300
 mushrooms 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:18.760
 remember that the mushroom does not wash if 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:22.300
 it is cleaned we have it previously 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:25.510
 clean and we chop it 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:28.000
 and they can cut it they can buy it 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:31.120
 cut can only buy whole it 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.220
 They charge to chop it at home because 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.740
 does not wash the champignon andrew because it's 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:39.580
 that the mushroom has a lot of liquid 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:41.920
 correct then if we leave it and do it 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.540
 They dehydrate itself and that is not 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.370
 the idea the idea is to keep a good 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.760
 flavor and that believes that when it goes all the 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.760
 texture 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.340
 so 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:56.130
 well then let's add the 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.160
 mushroom remember that previously 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:02.040
 We had the onion chopped red onion 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:04.340
 in pen we are going to put another 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.340
 bit 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:10.340
 garlic you can not miss none of them 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:15.560
 definitely gives the un and the lemon and 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:18.320
 the lemon and the cilantro skin and everything is 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:20.030
 who does not want we can put together the recipe and 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:23.660
 what you want you to love 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:26.620
 place is here we have a gadget that 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.620
 I love it 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:35.750
 the aparatico that crushes second side 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:37.940
 have to get their hands dirty 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:40.820
 it really is a very pungent odor yes 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:43.430
 but this very good that is for me this 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:46.010
 second of excellent ado is a taste 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:49.030
 incredible and here we are going to start 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.030
 put with the lemon 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:55.290
 red onions pinilla mushrooms 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:57.120
 cut well cut 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:59.940
 a little water and we're talking about 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:03.020
 about 4 cloves of garlic 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:03.020
 and we come 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:09.750
 remember that lemon 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:11.520
 try precooked precooked 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:16.239
 lemon 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:18.700
 walt mushroom fish in this case makes 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:23.760
 and production when done with 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:26.970
 other products like mango with avocado 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:30.450
 instead of mushroom it could be replaced 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.450
 because another ingredient 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:38.950
 you can get me by handle 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:40.910
 the mangoes also with the asparagus 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:44.260
 works 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:48.710
 since it burns saying are nonsense 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:52.010
 also with another product that is like him 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:56.090
 it's like the face of can be done in 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:05:00.020
 6 thanks girls the meat is hydrated 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:02.870
 and it's done so much comes in a box 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:05.030
 true that it's like replacing the 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:09.290
 pÃ©rez meat with the soy 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:11.870
 correct how long you should leave the 

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:15.200
 ceviche at rest before serving 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:17.900
 Claudia half an hour before serving 

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:19.490
 Andres and immediate consumption are the 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:22.940
 that you can not keep in the fridge 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:25.700
 a few days to nou no andres because the 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:29.849
 mushroom is oxidized very easy 

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:33.230
 then as immediate consumption 

00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:39.340
 good now having ketchup 

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:39.340
 never mixing and we put cilantro 

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:48.490
 it is here we have everything or here it works 

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:48.490
 all the cilantro because for me up 

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:54.630
 the stem gives it a very good flavor 

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:56.010
 then we will not waste any 

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:58.350
 part of the coriander we are going to apply 

00:05:56.010 --> 00:06:00.300
 complete and gives freshness to the 

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:03.520
 preparation and being finely chopped 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:06.660
 very well chopped 

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:10.220
 and it must be fresh 

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:10.220
 we press full 

00:06:11.529 --> 00:06:15.269
 and again we mix 

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:26.290
