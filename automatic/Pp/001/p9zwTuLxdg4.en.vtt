00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:06.860
 I've had consultations 

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:10.309
 on protein and on protein 

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:12.860
 what is the protein how is it taken in what 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:13.990
 measure how often you take and 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.630
 the rest 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:18.400
 well let's see how it is always indicated 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:21.250
 before each video this is only in 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:23.300
 my opinion and we are going to share a couple of 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:26.350
 points on protein 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:28.870
 what I would like to share with you 

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:31.750
 when you eat for example a vice a 

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:34.270
 churrasco a chicken leg does not eat 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:36.370
 fish and others is eating protein 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:37.900
 good protein quality protein 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.340
 as long as the load is a mother 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:42.610
 that is without fat 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.980
 well sometimes the body as we are 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:47.020
 requiring a very high caloric expenditure 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:49.450
 important how to do weights follow 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:51.490
 Weightlifting can be lifting 

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:53.320
 of weights can be multiple exercises 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:55.660
 that require a physical effort 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.550
 higher of the population since it is 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:00.340
 used to make the approval of 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:02.320
 body to be able to produce the muscles 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:06.449
 and to be able to form you need a 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.449
 supplement that supplement is the protein 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:12.100
 the protein well in different qualities and 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.530
 presentations can be protein from 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.420
 egg can be match of sole 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.920
 milk that is more important than the soil 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.840
 of milk personally I'll take the 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.549
 of whey whey protein 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.500
 of milk what it does is that they form 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:25.810
 faster muscles 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.460
 as we all know the muscles do not 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.970
 they form come from generations that was born 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.310
 we give him 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.750
 the engine so that it actually forms 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.700
 the muscles are formed when we sleep 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.160
 when it rests we go when we are 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.580
 resting the cells that broke 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:42.380
 the fibers that broke from the muscle 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.790
 they are to say it in an open way 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.470
 then they are waiting for the 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.490
 nutrients arrive for when the 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.890
 Muscle wants to go back to its size 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.810
 initial can not then they go 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.870
 muscle contraction the protein 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:56.720
 accelerates this true eating process 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:58.760
 large amounts of meat whatever 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.940
 of fish chicken as I said 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:04.220
 previously added to the protein goes to 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:06.560
 make the process accelerate without 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.929
 alter more and better proteins 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.080
 biological origin the body will grow 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:14.470
 much more quickly 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:18.430
 personally when I was taking creatine what 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:22.230
 twice ago one mid-morning between 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.230
 breakfast and lunch 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:29.750
 and another was taken in the afternoon let's say 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:33.140
 mid afternoon with the snack 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:35.210
 in small doses and that really has 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.560
 a measure like 20 size 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:40.170
 approximately 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.660
 life of this size can be taken 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:45.590
 with milk with water some people by 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.590
 what not with some juice 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.049
 you see in the result you see the dice 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.900
 next to the person who will not take a 

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:54.640
 protein like that and let's say that within 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.560
 things that can be taken to do 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.810
 exercise that are healthy and they are not going to 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:02.769
 produce serious problems like 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:06.159
 surely one knows the protein is 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:08.859
 something indicated is something correct that up 

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:12.230
 it can be indicated by a nutritionist in 

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:16.319
 a doctor will surely recommend it 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:18.810
 and good the protein serves 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:21.090
 As all supplements are recommended 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:24.030
 leave a break of time is a break 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.499
 superior rest 30 days 120 days the 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:29.249
 amount of 10 that one wants to address 

00:03:25.499 --> 00:03:31.469
 as I come back I repeat the organism of each 

00:03:29.249 --> 00:03:33.870
 one if there are people who have some 

00:03:31.469 --> 00:03:36.689
 type of stomach conditions of 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:39.659
 intestine perfectly the dairy is 

00:03:36.689 --> 00:03:41.909
 possible to tighten the digestion or 

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:43.670
 that has just more acidity and for 

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:47.030
 that's not 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:48.290
 auspicious but good I'm just 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:50.090
 to connect over only 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:51.500
 talking about the princes of the 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:54.140
 hillside pretends the intended 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:56.930
 basically they make muscle help that they 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:59.120
 form more quickly and in conjunction with 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:01.940
 other supplements that if he said that 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:04.130
 talk it with the nutritionist like that 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:05.959
 it's good instead of starting a plan for 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:08.690
 oneself about de joana was taking again 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:11.840
 this this and this to have faster 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:14.890
 the muscle and form faster not under 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.850
 no concept is always monitored 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:19.430
 supervised by a specialist in 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:22.959
 nutrition and which can tell us how 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:22.959
 we must administer the doses 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:27.240
 the protein can also recover us 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.760
 more quickly because having the 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:31.350
 body to terror more fuel 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:34.440
 we give more, I always give the example 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:36.720
 of the car the same as the car that works 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:39.000
 CNG gas than to a car that works in 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.080
 until one chooses what he gives he wants to give 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.449
 the body 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:44.629
 and we are what we consume what we are 

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:44.629
 we eat 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:51.469
 if in addition to taking the proteins we eat 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:53.360
 Properly vegetable fruits all kinds 

00:04:51.469 --> 00:04:55.879
 of vegetables 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:05:00.080
 because no carbohydrates like noodles 

00:04:55.879 --> 00:05:01.909
 and other we will achieve a feeding 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.169
 balanced and therefore we will progress 

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:06.550
 in generation 

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:08.820
 this is very good in protein 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:11.460
 multiple benefits on the body itself 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:14.820
 but like everything here as not always in 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:14.820
 just measurements 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:18.979
 so well before any query that 

00:05:16.789 --> 00:05:21.289
 it can be a comment in the box 

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:24.080
 comments below if we can not 

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:25.729
 do any kind of correction if I 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:28.220
 do you want to ask some kind of question 

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:30.020
 about this case or why because not 

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:32.320
 any other type of video after 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:32.320
 the query
