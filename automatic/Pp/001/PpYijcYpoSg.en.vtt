penguin<00:01:22.039> style<00:01:22.340> catalog<00:01:22.909> I<00:01:23.119> think<00:01:23.659> that's

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
penguin style catalog I think that's

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:25.630 
penguin style catalog I think that's
just<00:01:24.079> because<00:01:24.200> in<00:01:24.469> the<00:01:24.829> star<00:01:25.130> wars<00:01:25.159> takeover

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:25.640 
just because in the star wars takeover

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:26.770 
just because in the star wars takeover
party<00:01:25.969> they're<00:01:26.180> gonna<00:01:26.270> have<00:01:26.450> a<00:01:26.479> ton<00:01:26.750> of

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
party they're gonna have a ton of

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.120 
party they're gonna have a ton of
costumes<00:01:27.350> so<00:01:27.439> that's<00:01:27.590> why<00:01:27.710> there<00:01:27.920> weren't

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
costumes so that's why there weren't

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.120 
costumes so that's why there weren't
that<00:01:28.280> many<00:01:28.490> in<00:01:29.000> the<00:01:29.299> catalog<00:01:29.750> now<00:01:30.469> we<00:01:30.530> are<00:01:30.950> back
