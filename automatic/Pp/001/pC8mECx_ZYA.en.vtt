 because they are bringing them online mode as 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.090
 there are many good people on youtube that 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.070
 Well, it's helping me and so on but the 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.960
 that I can bring you personally 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.369
 I'll do what I like better to me 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.050
 record them and so on and so also I 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.700
 I entertain a little bit and good so 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.559
 I 'm going to bring you today is a way of 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.050
 beat the environment that as you know is the 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.969
 fastest car all gta of all 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.100
 the modes of this gp to 5 of the online mode 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.079
 The online mode of all modes is the 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.230
 faster car is able to beat him 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.640
 a breakdown of more but I do not know good I do not know 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.070
 if many of you have noticed but 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.930
 I guess not but there is a car that is 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.120
 able to make it good shadow more 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.390
 specifically a two-wheeled vehicle 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.340
 and now you are going to find out how it is worth 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.439
 you see let's do two races of two 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.970
 stretches along along the track 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.070
 d landing 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.680
 airport is ok and well, this is going to 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.120
 be the first section that we are going to do and 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.830
 Well, nothing like you're going to see here 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.660
 we went with the one around all 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.820
 speed without skidding wheels or anything 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:19.530
 It's worth as you have seen it is totally 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.410
 well put on the line and other vale 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.120
 so you do not have to win in meters or 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:25.560
 nothing is worth it or try to do it more 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.060
 justito that I could 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.830
 also put a stopwatch so that 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.220
 you see the time and others and good as 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:35.400
 you see we have done a time of 15,500 49 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.050
 seconds is worth 15 seconds almost 15 and 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.780
 means to say it in some way is worth 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:41.820
 more so pulling to round and good as 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.680
 you see it's a good time it's worth it because this 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.810
 car the truth is that he deserves it 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.700
 some times and good as you see 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.260
 now let's do the second stretch 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.270
 here as you see is totally fine 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:54.210
 put as I said before is just 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.820
 on the line and almost practically we're going 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.860
 perfectly placed and we will go out and 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.479
 we are going to do the second section that this 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:02.460
 stretch is a little bit longer it's worth 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.470
 that you are going to see that the time is going to 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.300
 be a little bit better but good 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.979
 Obviously that's because this piece 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.050
 of the airstrip is a little bit 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.400
 longer is worth so good as you see 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.680
 we go to all 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.209
 let's go as fast as we can without 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.000
 skid wheels also as I said 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:20.790
 so that the race is the most equal 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.220
 possible and good as I wanted 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:28.140
 comment then nothing we are going to do a 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:31.530
 Approximate time is worth 10 and 8 485 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:33.420
 It's worth 18 seconds and well, now 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.819
 I'm going to show the vehicle that is capable 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.129
 of shading this piece of car 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:40.859
 that is nothing more and nothing less than the 

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:42.959
 moto the dim catroux that is the new motorbike 

00:02:40.859 --> 00:02:44.730
 that they have put and you will say that goes 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:46.500
 this is impossible that I beat a 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.420
 environment if you do not win a to see how you 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.639
 is going to win this bike as good as 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.280
 I'll show you how to make it 

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:54.810
 shadow this piece of car and good 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.540
 As you can see we are here in the first 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.250
 stretch is worth the race and well then 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.200
 As I told you, the only thing we have to 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.209
 to do is a very very very simple thing and 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.500
 very very easy the first thing we have 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:06.870
 to do is ride on the bike and 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.280
 when they come out when we go out we have to 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.870
 make a horse worth we have to 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.720
 make a little horse all the time like 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.519
 You see 210 and we make a horse 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.900
 go out and do a wheelie that 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:17.909
 you do not know is to throw 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.829
 the left joystick of your command 

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:21.750
 down is worth and makes a little horse 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:23.220
 worth that from the start and well then 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.970
 As you can see here, I am diverting 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.620
 bit 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.540
 I'm getting a little out on the track 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.980
 but still leaving me off the track and 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.930
 having made a tour a little more 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:34.680
 long we have taken him almost a second 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:36.329
 much 14 seconds like 248 like today and 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.549
 we've won him in this first race 

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:40.650
 with the tinka truth that good sure 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:42.540
 nobody gave a hard for it but as 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.220
 You see is able to beat an environment 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.920
 yes, obviously, making a 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.989
 horse but hey a wheel has its 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.670
 merit the truth to win and well then 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:53.220
 how are you going to see here below 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:55.379
 you have the second leg of the race 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.329
 good and good as you will remember with the 

00:03:55.379 --> 00:04:00.329
 environment we have done approximately 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:02.250
 18 seconds worth and good then now you go 

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:04.470
 to see the amount of seconds that 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.670
 we can take it out this time yes that as 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:07.560
 You see I have not left the track 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:09.750
 tried to go as straight as possible 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:14.099
 doing the little horse and good as well as 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:16.859
 you see we have a tiempazo of 16 984 goes of 

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:19.019
 16 seconds almost 17 we have removed it then 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:20.579
 approximately almost two seconds and here 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:21.900
 you have the results of the first 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:24.900
 career 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:28.169
 around 15 seconds against the dim 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:29.520
 14 seconds catroux is worth and good 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:31.830
 here we have the results of the 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:34.280
 second race in which you hit and in 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:37.590
 lathe has done 18 seconds and a half almost 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:39.660
 against line 3 that has made 16 almost 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:41.070
 17 seconds has practically taken him out 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:43.410
 a second and a half the truth is that it is 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:45.419
 an asshole and good as you see with 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:48.300
 this bike you can tell the ones from the 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:49.650
 environments that get screwed up so nothing 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.120
