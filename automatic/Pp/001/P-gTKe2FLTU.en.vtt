00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.150
 good cope years let's perform a practice 

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:06.560
 of a word processor like a woman 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.560
 but it must be a hyperlink first demos entered 

00:00:10.069 --> 00:00:12.519
 the female reader and how resources are used 

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:13.469
 former mayor 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.119
 ricky 

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:18.119
 they will not practice the amount of days of the week 

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:26.779
 in days of the week what we are going to do 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:29.819
 open the full court 

00:00:29.819 --> 00:00:30.960
 you have to indicate 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.040
 that the columns are represented by letters research represents more 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.290
 pure 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.430
 mode every day of the week Monday 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.860
 Tuesday 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:46.790
 and what we do is 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:49.790
 Monday and Tuesday will mark the block we position ourselves 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.740
 in the lower right part we are going 

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:55.870
 to put the mouse pointer 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:58.230
 with one x or one more 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.040
 What I am bidding to click to actively generate the days of 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.520
 week 

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:06.280
 we are going to be able to attend 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:07.640
 Adults 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.990
 this course 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.990
 and young people 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.560
 and we are going to oppose the total of attendees between the two 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.340
 if I win this course 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.950
 in adults let's oppose random values ​​let's put 60 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.430
 in theater 70 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.360
 7 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.360
 40 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.970
 2. 3 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.180
 spisiak 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.120
 young people gave up 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:44.980
 90 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.620
 fifty 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:50.620
 while 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.330
 let's prioritize the council 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.670
 to relaunch the sum we go to the toolbar he played 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.100
 adding both included 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.240
 and we will visualize on the screen that automatically 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.840
 they are marked the put the 2-2 corts press center and see what 

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:10.859
 we are generated issue 

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:14.989
 To copy this formula what we do is position ourselves with the pointer of the 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:18.689
 mouse in the lower right part turns us into a 

00:02:18.689 --> 00:02:19.869
 uu 

00:02:19.869 --> 00:02:21.739
 the cross and what we do is 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:23.699
 to be a chaos pericles 

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:26.719
 we are going to visualize that automatically generate subject 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:31.389
 we are going to mark the block we are going to oppose because it is 

00:02:31.389 --> 00:02:33.439
 princ lilian edges 

00:02:33.439 --> 00:02:34.700
 2-2 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.149
 the presentation would be a little more attractive 

00:02:38.149 --> 00:02:41.149
 then we will insert 

00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:46.429
 a statistical picture seem to give strength and we have zico mark the blockade 

00:02:46.429 --> 00:02:47.849
 as a club drag 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:51.109
 we are going to insert ourselves we are going to columns 

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:54.659
 of columns we will choose with 1m three dimensions 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:59.069
 and we are going to visualize that automatically they were alienated which 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:01.629
 rescuers 

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:04.879
 this data we are not going to copy the word processor 

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:09.349
 let's mark the block right mouse button and copy 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:14.060
 we go to the start button we go to miss kosovo 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.489
 and what we do is right mouse photon did not come out 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:20.939
 a context menu and locke 

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:23.909
 what and a click on the technical option 

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:26.709
 let's see that automatically 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:28.009
 breasts 

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:32.529
 will fight the data but recomposed after evicting reader and what we are going 

00:03:32.529 --> 00:03:34.649
 to do is to gather 

00:03:34.649 --> 00:03:36.809
 the stress picture 

00:03:36.809 --> 00:03:38.229
 same museum 

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:40.459
 ana the word processor 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:43.479
 Right mouse button are not the context menu 

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:45.039
 clin clin and paste 

00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:48.039
 and we are going to visualize what automatically 

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:50.909
 it hit us which is ready 

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:52.569
 the next step 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:54.429
 is save 

00:03:54.429 --> 00:03:57.489
 these files clean 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:03:58.439
 he guards 

00:03:58.439 --> 00:04:01.739
 I go to the windows desk that what I'm going to do is propose 

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:05.799
 practice 

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:09.859
 and whole 

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:11.789
 we go to the electronic sheet 

00:04:11.789 --> 00:04:14.649
 and we are also going to oppose 

00:04:14.649 --> 00:04:15.619
 guard 

00:04:15.619 --> 00:04:16.919
 and we are going to oppose 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:18.809
 to practice 

00:04:18.809 --> 00:04:21.819
 court 

00:04:21.819 --> 00:04:24.819
 at the undefeated desk 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:29.620
 tells him that this document already exists what the sip says he wants to replace the 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.449
 illuminate 

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:35.400
 after doing this we are going to be the hyperlink 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.400
 we are going to lose weight we are going to put rules in 

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:40.560
 and what we are going to do is 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:41.919
 to position ourselves 

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:43.729
 the word in the jungle headquarters 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:47.729
 right mouse button and we will visualize the contextual menu that we are going 

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:51.020
 to use skype 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:54.279
 to display a window in which the current little respect 

00:04:54.279 --> 00:04:56.879
 I choose 

00:04:56.879 --> 00:04:59.110
 the directory 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:00.070
 the pair 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:03.150
 a route where milk file is located 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:06.460
 This desk is called 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:09.129
 practiced 

00:05:09.129 --> 00:05:09.949
 and later 

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:10.889
 to accept 

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:12.949
 let's see if we are massa 

00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:16.690
 automatically mouse pointer turns into a hand let's see and 

00:05:16.689 --> 00:05:19.479
 let's see what automatically 

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:22.229
 semblanzas with microsoft 

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:23.689
 Similarly 

00:05:23.689 --> 00:05:25.879
 I'm going to make a hyperlink 

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:26.889
 of the sheet 

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:30.779
 also the word processor to the woman because as a class support 

00:05:32.499 --> 00:05:34.199
 and the same steps 

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:35.509
 frame the block 

00:05:35.509 --> 00:05:38.599
 Right mouse button does not use a context menu 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:41.719
 I choose the hyperlink option 

00:05:41.719 --> 00:05:44.719
 It tells me where I want the interest to go 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:48.279
 Ilic Boyacá practiced 

00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:51.279
 then 

00:05:52.099 --> 00:05:52.970
 we are going to 

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:55.740
 when comparing 

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:56.909
 Lets put 

00:05:56.909 --> 00:05:59.680
 some new data 

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:01.969
 mobile data appliances 

00:06:01.969 --> 00:06:04.969
 and let's see what automatically 

00:06:05.969 --> 00:06:09.289
 adults attended on Monday we always go to see what 

00:06:09.839 --> 00:06:12.220
 in the statistical table it is increased 

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:14.740
 automatically the bars 

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:16.589
 let's see the humor 

00:06:16.589 --> 00:06:18.210
 that your sector 

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:20.300
 in the same way or another 

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:21.960
 do the same 

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:24.960
 every time you modify the data 

00:06:25.569 --> 00:06:27.680
 in this electronic sheet 

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:30.759
 / visualize 

00:06:30.759 --> 00:06:34.069
 is increasing or decreasing 

00:06:34.069 --> 00:06:36.199
 Similarly 

00:06:36.199 --> 00:06:37.419
 and so 

00:06:37.419 --> 00:06:38.789
 this is the fourth 

00:06:38.789 --> 00:06:41.449
 to practice the internet with the many thanks
