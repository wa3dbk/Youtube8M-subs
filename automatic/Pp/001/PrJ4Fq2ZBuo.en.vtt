00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:04.230
 I am you top of others but I thought 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.170
 could still resolve that 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.249
 the other two gunshot wounds 

00:00:09.249 --> 00:00:11.129

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:15.679
 the traveler dollars 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.169
 This is by the way a cure for an exciting one 

00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:22.579
 prison points cookbooks 

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:25.829
 her heart riches equality much more often 

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:28.829
 but I say fall 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:33.640
 I still have it 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.890
 benschop once deployed 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:37.750

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.350
 became well this respect applies a very neat 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.130
 though i think we are very sorry 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:52.460

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.820
 club remains google 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.280
 for that matter it is very bad 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.710
 with a good mix 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.710
 it's a minkes speech 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.030
 then continued 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.300
 but we start i make a choice 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.010
 rarely came so 3 3 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:14.040
 such a cross 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.170
 we were only got you 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.120
 five instead of four 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.150
 in addition, just started racing 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:21.790

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.460
 one more needed 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.170
 now you can do those things 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:04.460
 that's just right 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.990
 easily turn normal 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.069
 in December 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.069
 we have a cross 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:12.839
 so look no more 

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:15.929
 all color connected 

00:02:15.929 --> 00:02:19.439

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:30.379
 the newspaper 

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:33.179
 these two are always going to solve 

00:02:33.179 --> 00:02:35.459
 make one like that 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:38.229
 just like the rest 

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:41.229
 but pay attention and start promoting 

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:46.349
 you read the right place 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:48.919
 mother find the others 

00:02:48.919 --> 00:02:51.769
 ideas so this is reasonable 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:54.769
 the fact that he rarely 3 3 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:58.449

 lines of colors are a bit different here and there 

00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:05.649
 so the requests come there 

00:03:05.649 --> 00:03:08.689
 just lucius 

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:11.689

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:36.839
 nothing to do 

00:03:36.839 --> 00:03:39.839
 8 million crowns 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:52.989
 we follow 

00:04:10.929 --> 00:04:13.929
 then you can still get help and yemen 

00:04:19.759 --> 00:04:22.249

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:39.809
 a round 

00:04:39.809 --> 00:04:41.499
 but a pack became an ordinary one 

00:04:41.499 --> 00:04:43.509
 nothing is poor too 

00:04:43.509 --> 00:04:47.849
 just grab hold first a flat here just sick no matter what the 

00:04:47.849 --> 00:04:49.520

 He looks what a filthy win 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:08.819
 the opening flat 

00:05:08.819 --> 00:05:10.240
 you have to plan 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.749
 so make two f 16 that 

00:05:12.749 --> 00:05:15.389
 they will see 

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:17.199
 part can be nullified 

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:18.800
 this horse they watch 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.389
 the break 

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:22.339
 to test 

00:05:22.339 --> 00:05:25.180
 then everything from construction is ready 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:26.569
 crumble 

00:05:26.569 --> 00:05:29.569
 with the first 

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:33.539

 we can make 

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:46.259
 that's the first one 

00:05:46.259 --> 00:05:49.259
 two o'clock 

00:05:51.589 --> 00:05:54.589
 and see how 

00:06:00.569 --> 00:06:02.689
 we can't know 

00:06:02.689 --> 00:06:05.689
 stand out 

00:06:17.689 --> 00:06:20.689
 during their 

00:06:24.569 --> 00:06:26.770
 more difficult with 

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:29.180
 hear the video 

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:31.770
 so we knew here under bond 

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:32.990
 although already good 

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:35.800
 the valuation maarten stekelenburg 

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:40.099
 one just gave the colors next as that is nothing before March 3 is purple 

00:06:41.719 --> 00:06:44.110
 just be a familiar name 

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:47.439
 then you are once again a little bit on your knees and you have your hands 

00:06:47.439 --> 00:06:48.909
 we don't get them 

00:06:48.909 --> 00:06:51.909
 that's a death 

00:06:55.259 --> 00:06:58.520
 every ncrm there we go 2 again 

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:00.360

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:00.899
 her work
