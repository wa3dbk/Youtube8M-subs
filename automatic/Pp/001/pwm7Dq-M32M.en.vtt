00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:28.970 
piece of tape on it has room for up to

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:39.110 
piece of tape on it has room for up to
37<00:00:29.970> entries<00:00:31.279> so<00:00:32.279> it's<00:00:32.460> 14<00:00:33.360> inches<00:00:33.600> long<00:00:38.000> and<00:00:39.000> at

37 entries so it's 14 inches long and at

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.049 
37 entries so it's 14 inches long and at
the<00:00:39.239> end<00:00:39.420> of<00:00:39.600> it<00:00:40.070> it<00:00:41.070> has<00:00:41.280> a<00:00:41.309> small<00:00:41.730> piece<00:00:42.030> of

the end of it it has a small piece of
metal<00:00:42.390> that<00:00:43.489> adheres<00:00:44.489> to<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.820> magnetic<00:00:45.300> basis

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
metal that adheres to the magnetic basis

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.150 
metal that adheres to the magnetic basis
on<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:45.930> bottom<00:00:46.320> of<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.860> cache<00:00:47.809> so<00:00:48.980> it<00:00:49.980> also

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
on the bottom of the cache so it also

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.020 
on the bottom of the cache so it also
comes<00:00:50.610> with<00:00:50.730> a<00:00:50.989> another<00:00:51.989> log<00:00:52.590> in<00:00:52.860> case<00:00:53.070> it<00:00:53.850> gets

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
comes with a another log in case it gets

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.900 
comes with a another log in case it gets
filled<00:00:54.390> up<00:00:54.660> or<00:00:54.960> the<00:00:55.379> log<00:00:55.559> is<00:00:55.710> ruined<00:00:56.129> it

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
filled up or the log is ruined it

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.110 
filled up or the log is ruined it
happens<00:00:57.360> to<00:00:57.539> be<00:00:57.570> treated<00:00:58.079> to<00:00:58.260> be<00:00:58.379> waterproof

00:00:59.110 --> 00:00:59.120 
happens to be treated to be waterproof

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.650 
happens to be treated to be waterproof
so<00:01:00.120> that's<00:01:00.300> good<00:01:01.640> so<00:01:02.640> I'm<00:01:03.120> going<00:01:03.300> to<00:01:03.390> show<00:01:03.629> you

so that's good so I'm going to show you
as<00:01:04.110> far<00:01:04.860> as<00:01:05.010> compared<00:01:05.430> to<00:01:05.610> other<00:01:05.960> household

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
as far as compared to other household

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.719 
as far as compared to other household
items<00:01:07.080> how<00:01:07.530> big<00:01:07.799> it<00:01:07.950> actually<00:01:08.070> is<00:01:08.430> I'm<00:01:08.640> going

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
items how big it actually is I'm going

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.120 
items how big it actually is I'm going
to<00:01:08.790> show<00:01:08.880> you<00:01:09.030> exactly<00:01:09.840> how<00:01:10.080> small<00:01:10.619> it<00:01:10.799> is<00:01:10.920> so

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
to show you exactly how small it is so

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.830 
to show you exactly how small it is so
you<00:01:11.220> can<00:01:11.250> kind<00:01:11.610> of<00:01:11.670> get<00:01:11.820> an<00:01:11.909> idea<00:01:11.970> of<00:01:12.240> how<00:01:12.390> big

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
you can kind of get an idea of how big

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.740 
you can kind of get an idea of how big
it<00:01:12.930> is<00:01:13.020> that's<00:01:13.409> a<00:01:13.470> penny<00:01:14.030> so<00:01:15.030> it<00:01:15.360> actually

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
it is that's a penny so it actually

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.590 
it is that's a penny so it actually
really<00:01:16.619> just<00:01:17.009> sits<00:01:17.340> on<00:01:17.460> top<00:01:17.610> of<00:01:17.670> it<00:01:17.970> it's<00:01:18.299> quite

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
really just sits on top of it it's quite

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.910 
really just sits on top of it it's quite
small<00:01:18.930> I<00:01:19.400> have<00:01:20.400> a<00:01:20.430> quarter<00:01:21.270> -<00:01:21.509> you<00:01:22.470> can<00:01:22.619> see<00:01:22.830> you

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
small I have a quarter - you can see you

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.350 
small I have a quarter - you can see you
could<00:01:23.070> probably<00:01:23.220> pick<00:01:23.430> up<00:01:23.460> fit<00:01:23.850> about<00:01:23.909> three

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
could probably pick up fit about three

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.020 
could probably pick up fit about three
or<00:01:24.509> four<00:01:24.720> of<00:01:24.810> them<00:01:24.900> on<00:01:25.049> there<00:01:25.759> and<00:01:26.759> then<00:01:26.939> you

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
or four of them on there and then you

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.109 
or four of them on there and then you
have<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.450> standard<00:01:27.810> microfilm<00:01:28.710> cam<00:01:29.119> which

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
have the standard microfilm cam which

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.590 
have the standard microfilm cam which
looks<00:01:30.710> giganteus<00:01:31.790> compared<00:01:32.790> to<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.180> very

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
looks giganteus compared to the very

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.590 
looks giganteus compared to the very
small<00:01:33.689> nano<00:01:34.079> cache<00:01:34.610> is<00:01:35.610> kind<00:01:36.180> of<00:01:36.299> pricey

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
small nano cache is kind of pricey

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.200 
small nano cache is kind of pricey
actually<00:01:37.439> it's<00:01:38.100> four<00:01:38.610> dollars<00:01:38.759> and<00:01:39.119> fifty

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
actually it's four dollars and fifty

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:45.010 
actually it's four dollars and fifty
cents<00:01:39.630> for<00:01:39.960> a<00:01:39.990> piece<00:01:40.530> of<00:01:40.710> metal<00:01:41.070> that<00:01:41.960> big<00:01:42.960> so

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
cents for a piece of metal that big so

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.120 
cents for a piece of metal that big so
yeah<00:01:46.020> I<00:01:46.049> guess<00:01:46.320> it's<00:01:46.619> a<00:01:46.770> really<00:01:46.979> good

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
yeah I guess it's a really good

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.450 
yeah I guess it's a really good
container<00:01:47.990> but<00:01:48.990> if<00:01:49.229> you<00:01:49.500> don't<00:01:49.710> have<00:01:49.890> five

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
container but if you don't have five

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.700 
container but if you don't have five
dollars<00:01:50.670> to<00:01:51.000> shell<00:01:51.240> out<00:01:51.270> to<00:01:51.570> go<00:01:51.750> buy<00:01:51.930> a<00:01:52.259> single

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
dollars to shell out to go buy a single

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.850 
dollars to shell out to go buy a single
cache<00:01:53.210> it<00:01:54.210> uh<00:01:54.390> probably<00:01:55.020> isn't<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:55.560> best

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
cache it uh probably isn't the best

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.219 
cache it uh probably isn't the best
thing
