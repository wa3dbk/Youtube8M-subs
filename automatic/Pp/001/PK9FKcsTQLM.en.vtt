00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:28.099 
make them they don't have functional

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:33.380 
make them they don't have functional
LEDs<00:00:29.099> and<00:00:31.009> they<00:00:32.009> got<00:00:32.550> holes<00:00:32.759> for<00:00:32.969> two<00:00:33.120> switches

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
LEDs and they got holes for two switches

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.470 
LEDs and they got holes for two switches
and<00:00:34.219> they<00:00:35.219> don't<00:00:35.430> have<00:00:35.579> recharge<00:00:36.030> portholes

and they don't have recharge portholes

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.180 
and they don't have recharge portholes
or<00:00:36.899> depending<00:00:37.440> on<00:00:37.500> what<00:00:37.559> sort<00:00:37.829> of<00:00:37.860> install

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
or depending on what sort of install

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.920 
or depending on what sort of install
you're<00:00:38.340> doing<00:00:38.579> you<00:00:38.820> can<00:00:38.969> recharge<00:00:39.690> port

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
you're doing you can recharge port

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.190 
you're doing you can recharge port
depending<00:00:40.079> on<00:00:40.379> what<00:00:40.469> you<00:00:40.559> want<00:00:41.629> so<00:00:42.629> I<00:00:42.660> decided

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
depending on what you want so I decided

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.279 
depending on what you want so I decided
to<00:00:43.320> do<00:00:43.500> my<00:00:43.530> install<00:00:44.250> on<00:00:44.399> this<00:00:44.579> um<00:00:45.079> see<00:00:46.079> I<00:00:46.110> just

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
to do my install on this um see I just

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.190 
to do my install on this um see I just
picked<00:00:46.559> up<00:00:46.680> an<00:00:46.829> empty<00:00:46.950> hilt<00:00:47.250> and<00:00:47.399> jazzed<00:00:47.789> it<00:00:47.910> up

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:48.200 
picked up an empty hilt and jazzed it up

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.920 
picked up an empty hilt and jazzed it up
so<00:00:49.200> now<00:00:49.230> instead<00:00:49.739> of<00:00:49.920> having<00:00:50.100> two<00:00:50.550> aluminium

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:50.930 
so now instead of having two aluminium

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.680 
so now instead of having two aluminium
dummy<00:00:52.039> LEDs<00:00:53.039> you've<00:00:53.280> got<00:00:53.460> a<00:00:53.640> functional<00:00:54.480> red

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
dummy LEDs you've got a functional red

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.660 
dummy LEDs you've got a functional red
and<00:00:54.930> green<00:00:55.500> LED<00:00:55.920> so<00:00:56.070> five<00:00:56.309> and<00:00:56.520> three

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
and green LED so five and three

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.180 
and green LED so five and three
millimeter<00:00:57.059> bezel<00:00:57.390> I<00:00:58.320> also<00:00:59.930> opened<00:01:00.930> this<00:01:01.350> for

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
millimeter bezel I also opened this for

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.810 
millimeter bezel I also opened this for
the<00:01:02.340> recharge<00:01:02.640> port<00:01:02.910> access<00:01:03.140> it's<00:01:04.140> um<00:01:04.820> right

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
the recharge port access it's um right

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.070 
the recharge port access it's um right

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
in between the middle of here so I've

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.429 
in between the middle of here so I've
measured<00:01:07.290> it<00:01:07.470> properly<00:01:07.799> and<00:01:08.630> it<00:01:09.630> allows<00:01:10.290> you

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
measured it properly and it allows you

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.969 
measured it properly and it allows you

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.470 
show you a blade demo and you can see
what<00:02:35.650> this<00:02:35.800> saver<00:02:36.700> has<00:02:36.880> to<00:02:37.000> offer

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:46.240 
trans trans white blade instead of a

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.740 
trans trans white blade instead of a
clear<00:02:46.450> blade<00:02:46.690> uh<00:02:47.880> so<00:02:48.880> just<00:02:48.910> pull<00:02:49.300> the<00:02:49.390> Kilkee

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
clear blade uh so just pull the Kilkee

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:57.780 
clear blade uh so just pull the Kilkee
out<00:02:51.150> just<00:02:52.150> locate<00:02:52.480> it<00:02:52.570> here<00:02:56.070> so<00:02:57.070> all<00:02:57.340> the<00:02:57.490> fonts

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
out just locate it here so all the fonts

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.730 
out just locate it here so all the fonts
on<00:02:57.940> here<00:02:58.180> it's<00:02:58.480> got<00:02:58.630> six<00:02:58.900> soundfonts<00:02:59.410> on<00:02:59.530> here

00:02:59.730 --> 00:02:59.740 
on here it's got six soundfonts on here

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:01.860 
on here it's got six soundfonts on here
are<00:02:59.890> based<00:03:00.640> on<00:03:00.910> revenue<00:03:01.240> so<00:03:01.390> it's<00:03:01.510> got<00:03:01.630> the<00:03:01.750> Old

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
are based on revenue so it's got the Old

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.980 
are based on revenue so it's got the Old
Republic<00:03:02.050> sound<00:03:02.590> fonts<00:03:02.980> and<00:03:03.630> reborn<00:03:04.630> sound

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:04.990 
Republic sound fonts and reborn sound

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:13.910 
Republic sound fonts and reborn sound
fonts<00:03:05.320> so<00:03:09.630> so<00:03:10.630> there's<00:03:10.870> a<00:03:11.670> rich<00:03:12.670> purple<00:03:13.540> color

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
fonts so so there's a rich purple color

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.030 
fonts so so there's a rich purple color
you<00:03:14.920> see<00:03:15.070> the<00:03:15.190> accent<00:03:15.580> LEDs<00:03:15.880> working<00:03:16.300> and<00:03:17.040> then

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
you see the accent LEDs working and then

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.450 
you see the accent LEDs working and then
it's<00:03:18.220> simply<00:03:18.580> rocking<00:03:18.940> the<00:03:19.030> switches<00:03:20.460> with

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:21.460 
it's simply rocking the switches with

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:25.080 
it's simply rocking the switches with
flash<00:03:21.670> on<00:03:21.820> crash<00:03:23.550> where<00:03:24.550> you<00:03:24.610> can<00:03:24.730> change<00:03:24.970> the

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
flash on crash where you can change the

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:32.650 
flash on crash where you can change the
car<00:03:25.270> so<00:03:25.450> you've<00:03:25.540> got

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.660 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:36.350 

so<00:03:33.660> the<00:03:33.780> Troy<00:03:33.959> curry<00:03:34.290> is<00:03:34.440> an<00:03:35.120> extremely<00:03:36.120> bright

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
so the Troy curry is an extremely bright

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:40.760 
so the Troy curry is an extremely bright
blade<00:03:38.720> it's<00:03:39.720> like<00:03:39.870> a<00:03:39.900> yellow<00:03:40.200> that's<00:03:40.500> this

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:40.770 
blade it's like a yellow that's this

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:46.580 
blade it's like a yellow that's this
color<00:03:41.010> I<00:03:41.450> just<00:03:42.450> put<00:03:42.599> it<00:03:42.690> down<00:03:42.780> like<00:03:42.840> that<00:03:45.590> flash

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
color I just put it down like that flash

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:54.020 
color I just put it down like that flash
and<00:03:46.830> fire<00:03:49.610> I've<00:03:50.610> got<00:03:50.790> a<00:03:50.819> red<00:03:51.030> again<00:03:53.000> like<00:03:54.000> a

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030
