00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.390
 so hello and welcome to with 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.639
 sorry for this new ticket tutorial yes 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.769
 Today I want to give you a mes system 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:14.309
 show and confuse that here the first one 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:16.199
 be shared by a total of three video and 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:19.320
 Although I show you this today 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:22.350
 basic building block of the system and indeed can 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:25.140
 to store this infinite number of items 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.570
 and all without any 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.320
 delay and that shows once 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.730
 short ago 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.260
 For example, I already have here 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.450
 Anything in there that I can 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.730
 take me out they showed here 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.079
 I can put it back in here and here 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.570
 I also have a crafting downstairs 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.969
 field integrated there I can then too 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.340
 all sorts of things here directly 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.430
 forces 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:49.379
 Besides, I can also access this system 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.879
 immanent to take some distance 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.059
 here for example right click with this 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.500
 special wireless access terminal and 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.390
 I have all of this here too 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:01.430
 on the way that works though 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:04.920
 only up to a certain distance 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:06.930
 here, for example, not anymore 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.939
 how exactly it is now structured 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:13.619
 I'll show you that best here in the 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:15.960
 I do that after only so much the whole 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.060
 needs a space of three times six 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.540
 fields as it is constructed here and 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.810
 has a height of 2 or 3 because it works 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:27.060
 also one more down 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.650
 So let's start and do it 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.520
 I am here for the first time nice 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:34.500
 looks like a little console 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.659
 wall or whatever you call it 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:41.729
 and here in the middle I pack that 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:43.799
 emmi crafting terminal yes still can 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.960
 we do not do anything with it on the net 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.299
 is on it but that must be done 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.000
 be supplied naturally and that gives 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:54.090
 there is such a kind of basic supply 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.040
 unit that the controller set the 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.689
 we know space saving is just a matter of times 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.149
 directly behind and joins the 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:02.369
 namely automatically and to supply 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:05.520
 Now with electricity I 'll do it now 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:10.310
 again shown already once 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.310
 here with then I sat there once 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.900
 a mso over it so I directly 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:19.980
 Of course, I have to do that, of course 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:22.730
 put a blog on it from below and 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:25.350
 it is now still on 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.260
 pretty solar ray as you do that 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.520
 it does not matter 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.140
 so now is the whole thing with energy 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.550
 Provided you can see and I can here 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:36.810
 also make ever right click on it 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:39.930
 and here next, too 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:43.320
 we install the wireless access 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:46.140
 point that's supposed to be that way too 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.640
 yes, as I have already shown with 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.770
 the wireless access dates except 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.390
 Distance can be served and 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.550
 I just adjust it directly below 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.560
 then he will be automatically provided with 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:59.430
 and in this box can now be up to 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:01.200
 16 wireless booster pack in the 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.490
 make sure that the range increases 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.940
 that's about it, too 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:04.850
 made 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.560
 otherwise the range is mg / day 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:09.150
 limited 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.680
 So far as this basic structure I 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.720
 can also prove it for a short time 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:16.920
 works ok so i have that 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:19.140
 of course I would have of mine 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:22.950
 Now almost squandered and you have to 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:24.989
 this time success is always terminal 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.340
 so that does not connect with it 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:28.980
 happens as it happened 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:31.500
 but that you always know the heard 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.730
 to the system and in addition and indeed 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.280
 I click here with a right click 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.840
 on it I have these fields here and 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.600
 I'll put that in here on the top right 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:42.060
 and now commission and right out 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:45.420
 and now is under link before 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:47.730
 stood there blinking and yes now I can 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.360
 here with too on this terminal too 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.900
 to grab 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:53.820
 while I'm with the other on the 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.080
 others can still access it 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:58.280
 now not throw become confused 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:02.910
 I'll give it away and you next 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:06.660
 We first get one of these mw cables 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:08.280
 and wait for them behind that up there 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:10.290
 it is superfluous because 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.090
 I connect anyway make easy 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:13.830
 ever as preparation for the 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:15.780
 system extension here 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:18.000
 I'll get into that 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.979
 Show next video so now 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.100
 we happen here in almost all that has 

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:24.750
 the reason that the blackhawks are me 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:27.090
 Immediately place here 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:29.850
 he is very sensitive and at 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:31.680
 explosion is completely destroyed and the 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:34.980
 content not drop but just 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:36.240
 completely away is so esslingen place 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:39.810
 I'll give you a middle of that here now 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:44.100
 letter out of tone and take me one now 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:46.470
 storage nas hold shift and 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:49.040
 placed with right-click on the box 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:51.090
 and the whole thing connects automatically 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:52.200
 Now I'm doing the rest too 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:54.780
 exclaimed Ton 

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:55.460
 so it is well protected in any case 

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:58.350
 is 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:02.640
 and yes the storage system is already 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:04.710
 so far finished yes I would be happy 

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:06.740
 I would like you guys too 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:12.000
 to look at parts are in the beginning 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:13.650
 probably linked and yes I think 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.690
 I have not forgotten anything yet 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:16.830
 do not show it again shortly 

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:18.570
 that of course again 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:19.919
 I have worked four degrees always 

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:24.560
 it can be stored again 

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:27.270
 outsource and of course, again 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:31.410
 access it from the remote 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:33.540
 and yes I know that needs a lot 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:37.950
 No energy is not only nine eu 

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:39.510
 politics if you do not do anything good that 

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:41.250
 It was then as far as I hope 

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:43.260
 you totally liked that 

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:46.880
 if so, of course I would like myself 

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:49.830
 always happy about a like or an abo 

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:52.130
 I would like to say until the next 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:52.130
 Video
