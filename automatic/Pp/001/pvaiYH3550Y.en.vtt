there when the steam feels like closing
I<00:00:35.309> guess<00:00:36.690> so<00:00:37.800> you<00:00:38.800> definitely<00:00:39.010> can't<00:00:39.370> tell<00:00:39.640> in

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:39.940 
I guess so you definitely can't tell in

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.560 
I guess so you definitely can't tell in
this<00:00:40.570> video<00:00:41.100> because<00:00:42.100> it<00:00:42.520> won't<00:00:42.730> work<00:00:43.210> because

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:43.570 
this video because it won't work because

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.280 
this video because it won't work because
this<00:00:44.500> is<00:00:44.680> the<00:00:44.860> phone<00:00:45.159> camera<00:00:45.820> you<00:00:46.269> can<00:00:46.300> yeah<00:00:47.019> on

the phone's camera it looks like it's

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:52.320 
the phone's camera it looks like it's
massively<00:00:49.540> blurring<00:00:49.890> but<00:00:50.909> basically<00:00:51.909> I

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:52.330 
massively blurring but basically I

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:57.899 
massively blurring but basically I
finally<00:00:53.140> got<00:00:53.320> this<00:00:55.949> what's<00:00:56.949> it<00:00:57.040> called<00:00:57.250> strobe

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:57.909

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:21.510 
this running I had two tabs open that's
the<00:01:19.540> one<00:01:19.810> this<00:01:20.470> isn't<00:01:20.800> doing<00:01:20.920> anything<00:01:21.250> and

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
that with anything else than a CRT

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:59.070 
that with anything else than a CRT
monitor<00:02:54.420> so<00:02:56.850> until<00:02:57.850> I<00:02:57.880> figured<00:02:58.240> out<00:02:58.330> until<00:02:59.050> I

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 
monitor so until I figured out until I

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.449 
monitor so until I figured out until I
found<00:02:59.260> out<00:02:59.440> about<00:02:59.590> the<00:02:59.800> blurring<00:03:00.070> stuff

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
found out about the blurring stuff

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:02.190 
found out about the blurring stuff
recently<00:03:00.700> I<00:03:01.060> mean<00:03:01.450> I<00:03:01.480> didn't<00:03:01.810> really<00:03:01.930> notice

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:02.200 
recently I mean I didn't really notice

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.800 
recently I mean I didn't really notice
it<00:03:02.500> but<00:03:03.130> then<00:03:03.280> once<00:03:03.520> I<00:03:03.640> was<00:03:04.090> made<00:03:04.240> aware<00:03:04.270> of<00:03:04.540> it

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
it but then once I was made aware of it

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.810 
it but then once I was made aware of it
I<00:03:04.989> kept<00:03:05.410> noticing<00:03:05.500> it<00:03:06.010> in<00:03:06.160> games<00:03:06.430> and

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:06.820 
I kept noticing it in games and

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.790 
I kept noticing it in games and
everywhere<00:03:07.209> else<00:03:07.239> so<00:03:08.140> I'm<00:03:08.200> just<00:03:08.350> like<00:03:08.530> screw

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:08.800 
everywhere else so I'm just like screw

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.500 
everywhere else so I'm just like screw
it<00:03:08.890> I<00:03:09.070> need<00:03:09.220> to<00:03:09.280> get<00:03:09.400> this<00:03:09.489> monitor<00:03:09.910> so<00:03:10.239> I

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
it I need to get this monitor so I

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:15.000 
it I need to get this monitor so I
finally<00:03:11.110> got<00:03:11.320> this<00:03:11.470> monitor<00:03:11.920> and<00:03:12.600> man<00:03:13.600> that<00:03:14.080> is

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
finally got this monitor and man that is

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:21.090 
finally got this monitor and man that is
amazing<00:03:16.110> like<00:03:17.110> a<00:03:18.870> mazing<00:03:19.870> he<00:03:20.709> just<00:03:20.950> goes

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100 
amazing like a mazing he just goes

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.650 
amazing like a mazing he just goes
straight<00:03:21.220> across<00:03:21.459> like<00:03:21.760> it's<00:03:22.239> like<00:03:22.450> there's

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
straight across like it's like there's

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.440 
straight across like it's like there's
no<00:03:22.840> problems<00:03:23.230> at<00:03:23.320> all<00:03:23.670> so<00:03:24.670> what<00:03:25.060> I<00:03:25.090> think<00:03:25.360> I'm

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
no problems at all so what I think I'm

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:30.930 
no problems at all so what I think I'm
going<00:03:25.570> to<00:03:25.690> do<00:03:25.870> is<00:03:27.150> set<00:03:28.150> my<00:03:28.330> FPS<00:03:28.900> max<00:03:29.320> in<00:03:29.940> counter

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
going to do is set my FPS max in counter

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:36.060 
going to do is set my FPS max in counter
strike<00:03:31.180> global<00:03:31.510> offensive<00:03:32.410> to<00:03:34.470> 120<00:03:35.470> so<00:03:35.890> then

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:36.070 
strike global offensive to 120 so then

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:38.190 
strike global offensive to 120 so then
it<00:03:36.400> will<00:03:36.580> stay<00:03:36.850> in<00:03:37.150> sync<00:03:37.450> as<00:03:37.630> long<00:03:37.780> as<00:03:37.930> I<00:03:38.049> have

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
it will stay in sync as long as I have

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.289 
it will stay in sync as long as I have
max<00:03:38.470> frames<00:03:38.860> which<00:03:39.220> i<00:03:39.489> can<00:03:39.940> adjust<00:03:40.000> some

00:03:40.289 --> 00:03:40.299 
max frames which i can adjust some

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:42.630 
max frames which i can adjust some
settings<00:03:40.480> and<00:03:40.810> make<00:03:40.930> sure<00:03:40.959> all<00:03:41.440> most<00:03:42.310> the<00:03:42.459> time

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640 
settings and make sure all most the time

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.770 
settings and make sure all most the time
have<00:03:42.850> max<00:03:43.360> frames<00:03:43.690> but<00:03:45.060> it's<00:03:46.060> amazing<00:03:46.570> it's

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
have max frames but it's amazing it's

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.610 
have max frames but it's amazing it's
like<00:03:48.030> it's<00:03:49.030> like<00:03:49.150> it's<00:03:49.299> a<00:03:49.540> solid<00:03:49.810> thing<00:03:50.350> I
