does that mean

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:55.700 
does that mean
let's<00:00:54.539> not<00:00:54.719> only<00:00:55.020> at<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.230> dimension<00:00:55.649> of

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
let's not only at the dimension of

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.600 
let's not only at the dimension of

a<00:00:58.670> velocity<00:00:59.660> we<00:01:00.080> have<00:01:00.260> seen<00:01:00.470> has<00:01:00.800> Dow<00:01:01.070> a

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.370 
a velocity we have seen has Dow a

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.000 
a velocity we have seen has Dow a
dimension<00:01:01.940> of<00:01:02.030> 1<00:01:02.240> but<00:01:03.200> a<00:01:03.230> velocity<00:01:03.680> is<00:01:03.890> the

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.010 
dimension of 1 but a velocity is the

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.070 
dimension of 1 but a velocity is the
length<00:01:04.190> over<00:01:04.400> time<00:01:04.790> so<00:01:05.390> this<00:01:05.540> means<00:01:05.840> the

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.080 
length over time so this means the

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.460 
length over time so this means the
length<00:01:06.260> is<00:01:06.500> now<00:01:06.680> the<00:01:07.070> dimension<00:01:07.550> of<00:01:07.640> a<00:01:07.730> time

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:08.470 
length is now the dimension of a time

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.810 
length is now the dimension of a time
this<00:01:09.470> is<00:01:09.530> what<00:01:09.770> you<00:01:09.860> would<00:01:09.980> expect<00:01:10.040> since<00:01:10.670> you

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
this is what you would expect since you

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.550 
this is what you would expect since you
can<00:01:10.970> use<00:01:11.000> the<00:01:11.360> speed<00:01:11.540> of<00:01:11.690> light<00:01:11.900> to<00:01:12.140> convert<00:01:12.530> a

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
can use the speed of light to convert a

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.150 
can use the speed of light to convert a
length<00:01:12.920> into<00:01:13.280> a<00:01:13.310> time<00:01:14.620> now<00:01:15.620> let's<00:01:15.860> look<00:01:16.010> at

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:16.160 
length into a time now let's look at

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.880 
length into a time now let's look at
h-bar<00:01:16.580> Omega<00:01:16.940> T<00:01:17.180> this<00:01:18.140> is<00:01:18.320> just<00:01:18.590> an<00:01:18.740> energy

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
h-bar Omega T this is just an energy

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:20.680 
h-bar Omega T this is just an energy
times<00:01:19.400> the<00:01:19.490> time<00:01:19.790> and<00:01:20.120> it's<00:01:20.510> now

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:20.690 
times the time and it's now

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.100 
times the time and it's now
dimensionless<00:01:21.940> so<00:01:22.940> this<00:01:23.150> means<00:01:23.450> an<00:01:23.660> energy

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
dimensionless so this means an energy

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.020 
dimensionless so this means an energy
has<00:01:24.440> a<00:01:24.470> dimension<00:01:24.830> of<00:01:25.070> the<00:01:25.220> inverse<00:01:25.520> of<00:01:25.670> a<00:01:25.790> time

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
has a dimension of the inverse of a time

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.580 
has a dimension of the inverse of a time
and<00:01:26.360> that<00:01:26.900> is<00:01:27.110> an<00:01:27.350> inverse<00:01:27.830> of<00:01:28.040> a<00:01:28.130> length

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590 
and that is an inverse of a length

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.410 
and that is an inverse of a length
now<00:01:30.590> consider<00:01:31.040> the<00:01:31.220> master<00:01:31.640> relation<00:01:32.180> east

square C to the fourth setting C equal
to<00:01:39.500> 1<00:01:39.710> this<00:01:40.100> tells<00:01:40.400> us<00:01:40.520> that<00:01:40.580> an<00:01:40.850> energy<00:01:41.300> has
