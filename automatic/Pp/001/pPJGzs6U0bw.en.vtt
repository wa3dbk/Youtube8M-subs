link to it and I looked at them and
here's<00:00:21.600> what<00:00:21.750> I<00:00:21.779> think<00:00:22.050> the<00:00:22.769> first<00:00:22.980> image<00:00:23.400> that

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
here's what I think the first image that

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.170 
here's what I think the first image that
I<00:00:23.609> came<00:00:23.699> across<00:00:24.029> was<00:00:24.720> this<00:00:25.050> one<00:00:26.180> suppose

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
I came across was this one suppose

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.609 
I came across was this one suppose
supposed<00:00:27.779> to<00:00:27.869> be<00:00:27.930> the<00:00:28.050> loading<00:00:28.320> Serena

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
supposed to be the loading Serena

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.230 
supposed to be the loading Serena
whatever<00:00:28.920> and<00:00:29.279> look<00:00:29.550> at<00:00:29.580> this<00:00:29.670> nicely<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.090> to

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
whatever and look at this nicely the to

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.870 
whatever and look at this nicely the to
plum<00:00:30.480> blobs<00:00:30.779> and<00:00:31.019> I<00:00:31.109> think<00:00:31.380> yeah<00:00:31.890> whatever<00:00:32.579> is

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
plum blobs and I think yeah whatever is

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.600 
plum blobs and I think yeah whatever is
it's<00:00:33.180> still<00:00:34.170> in<00:00:34.350> development<00:00:34.410> so<00:00:34.920> that's<00:00:35.130> okay

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
it's still in development so that's okay

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:36.830 
it's still in development so that's okay
i<00:00:35.640> guess<00:00:35.880> and<00:00:36.030> i<00:00:36.090> see<00:00:36.239> the<00:00:36.329> loading<00:00:36.570> cream<00:00:36.719> so

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
i guess and i see the loading cream so

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:37.910 
i guess and i see the loading cream so
like<00:00:36.870> it's<00:00:37.230> the<00:00:37.320> loading<00:00:37.559> screen<00:00:37.590> for

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
like it's the loading screen for

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.950 
like it's the loading screen for
something<00:00:38.370> but<00:00:39.180> then<00:00:39.300> when<00:00:39.420> I<00:00:39.480> go<00:00:39.690> down<00:00:39.930> to

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
something but then when I go down to

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.000 
something but then when I go down to
look<00:00:40.379> at<00:00:40.969> the<00:00:41.969> actual<00:00:42.210> images<00:00:42.719> this<00:00:43.620> is<00:00:43.829> where

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
look at the actual images this is where

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.130 
look at the actual images this is where
I<00:00:44.040> become<00:00:44.430> convinced<00:00:44.879> that<00:00:45.210> this<00:00:45.660> is<00:00:45.840> not<00:00:46.020> the

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
I become convinced that this is not the

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.139 
I become convinced that this is not the
sims<00:00:46.350> 3<00:00:46.530> and<00:00:46.649> i<00:00:46.680> will<00:00:46.829> show<00:00:47.010> you<00:00:47.070> sims<00:00:47.700> 4<00:00:47.910> i<00:00:47.940> mean

of a sim or something but anyways just
look<00:01:17.610> at<00:01:17.759> it<00:01:17.790> like<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.390> textures<00:01:18.840> this<00:01:19.439> game

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
look at it like the textures this game

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.030 
look at it like the textures this game
looks<00:01:19.860> too<00:01:20.850> finished<00:01:21.720> if<00:01:22.049> that<00:01:22.830> means

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
looks too finished if that means

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.740 
looks too finished if that means
anything<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.549> textures<00:01:24.060> are<00:01:24.210> done<00:01:24.479> look<00:01:24.659> at

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
anything the textures are done look at

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.410 
anything the textures are done look at
the<00:01:24.840> couch<00:01:25.080> like<00:01:25.950> if<00:01:26.130> if<00:01:26.490> this<00:01:26.970> game<00:01:27.240> was

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
the couch like if if this game was

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.870 
the couch like if if this game was
really<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.750> sims<00:01:28.020> 4<00:01:28.259> in<00:01:28.950> development<00:01:29.549> they

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
really the sims 4 in development they

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.410 
really the sims 4 in development they
wouldn't<00:01:30.180> spend<00:01:30.630> so<00:01:30.720> much<00:01:31.049> time<00:01:32.299> putting<00:01:33.299> in

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
wouldn't spend so much time putting in

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.390 
wouldn't spend so much time putting in
all<00:01:33.540> these<00:01:33.689> textures<00:01:34.560> say<00:01:34.710> it<00:01:34.920> would<00:01:35.100> it

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
all these textures say it would it

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.670 
all these textures say it would it
wouldn't<00:01:35.700> be<00:01:35.820> like<00:01:36.030> that<00:01:36.090> if<00:01:36.509> it<00:01:37.170> was<00:01:37.320> really

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
wouldn't be like that if it was really

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.440 
wouldn't be like that if it was really
an<00:01:37.799> early<00:01:38.100> development<00:01:38.579> like<00:01:38.700> supposed<00:01:39.210> to<00:01:39.299> be

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
an early development like supposed to be

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.050 
an early development like supposed to be
and<00:01:39.689> another<00:01:40.560> picture<00:01:40.979> that<00:01:41.189> I<00:01:41.220> have<00:01:41.490> that

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
and another picture that I have that

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.889 
and another picture that I have that
they<00:01:42.210> have<00:01:42.420> up<00:01:42.860> right<00:01:43.860> here<00:01:44.329> they<00:01:45.329> have<00:01:45.450> actual

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
they have up right here they have actual

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.800 
they have up right here they have actual
paintings<00:01:46.290> on<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:46.500> wall<00:01:46.740> if<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.630> game<00:01:48.630> was

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
paintings on the wall if the game was

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:49.999 
paintings on the wall if the game was
still<00:01:48.990> in<00:01:49.049> development<00:01:49.500> do<00:01:49.560> you<00:01:49.649> really<00:01:49.829> think

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
still in development do you really think

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.289 
still in development do you really think
they<00:01:50.070> would<00:01:50.100> waste<00:01:50.460> time<00:01:50.729> on<00:01:50.880> something<00:01:51.090> like

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
they would waste time on something like

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.690 
they would waste time on something like
that<00:01:51.450> they'd<00:01:51.630> still<00:01:52.170> be<00:01:52.200> working<00:01:52.500> on<00:01:52.799> like<00:01:53.009> the

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
that they'd still be working on like the

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.310 
that they'd still be working on like the
game<00:01:53.970> script<00:01:54.360> in<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.600> game<00:01:54.810> engine<00:01:55.170> and

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
game script in the game engine and

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.709 
game script in the game engine and
getting<00:01:55.560> like<00:01:55.680> all<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.159> little<00:01:56.399> bugs<00:01:56.670> out<00:01:57.420> and

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
getting like all the little bugs out and

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.289 
getting like all the little bugs out and
working<00:01:58.020> everything<00:01:58.560> that<00:01:58.790> is<00:01:59.790> supposed<00:02:00.180> to

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
working everything that is supposed to

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:01.399 
working everything that is supposed to
work<00:02:00.360> right<00:02:00.689> they<00:02:00.869> wouldn't<00:02:01.140> waste<00:02:01.259> time

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
work right they wouldn't waste time

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.520 
work right they wouldn't waste time
putting<00:02:02.009> detailed<00:02:02.939> clothing<00:02:03.509> on<00:02:03.689> the<00:02:04.259> sims

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
putting detailed clothing on the sims

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.310 
putting detailed clothing on the sims
what<00:02:05.250> I<00:02:05.280> reckon<00:02:05.640> this<00:02:05.759> is<00:02:05.790> is<00:02:06.090> like<00:02:06.119> maybe<00:02:07.110> like

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
what I reckon this is is like maybe like

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.869 
what I reckon this is is like maybe like
another<00:02:07.590> one<00:02:07.770> of<00:02:07.860> those<00:02:07.920> facebook<00:02:08.220> games<00:02:08.670> are

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
another one of those facebook games are

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.950 
another one of those facebook games are
like<00:02:09.000> an<00:02:09.179> iPad<00:02:09.629> game<00:02:09.899> or<00:02:10.080> something

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:10.960 
like an iPad game or something

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:13.710 
like an iPad game or something
but<00:02:11.140> in<00:02:11.440> my<00:02:11.950> opinion<00:02:12.100> it<00:02:12.580> is<00:02:12.610> definitely<00:02:13.060> not

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
but in my opinion it is definitely not

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.920 
but in my opinion it is definitely not
the<00:02:14.290> sims<00:02:14.620> 4<00:02:14.890> I<00:02:15.550> don't<00:02:15.910> think<00:02:16.210> for<00:02:16.360> one<00:02:16.600> second

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
the sims 4 I don't think for one second

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.840 
the sims 4 I don't think for one second
this<00:02:17.050> is<00:02:17.230> asim<00:02:17.530> for<00:02:17.740> I'm<00:02:17.890> pretty<00:02:18.130> much<00:02:18.190> I'm<00:02:18.430> 98%

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
this is asim for I'm pretty much I'm 98%

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:24.200 
this is asim for I'm pretty much I'm 98%
sure<00:02:19.360> that<00:02:20.260> this<00:02:20.530> is<00:02:20.770> not<00:02:20.980> the<00:02:21.610> sims<00:02:21.910> 4<00:02:22.350> so<00:02:23.350> I

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210 
sure that this is not the sims 4 so I

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.460 
sure that this is not the sims 4 so I
don't<00:02:25.210> know<00:02:25.300> it<00:02:25.510> doesn't<00:02:25.810> like<00:02:25.900> the<00:02:26.020> sims<00:02:26.230> 4<00:02:26.290> it

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
don't know it doesn't like the sims 4 it

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:27.780 
don't know it doesn't like the sims 4 it

look at these sims I'm not saying that I
know<00:02:29.590> if<00:02:29.740> it<00:02:29.800> was<00:02:29.950> too<00:02:30.040> soon<00:02:30.190> for<00:02:30.430> that<00:02:30.460> I<00:02:30.580> would

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
know if it was too soon for that I would

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.470 
know if it was too soon for that I would
have<00:02:30.850> bad<00:02:31.060> graphics<00:02:31.300> but<00:02:32.580> it<00:02:33.580> they<00:02:34.150> wouldn't

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
have bad graphics but it they wouldn't

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.110 
have bad graphics but it they wouldn't
be<00:02:34.540> wearing<00:02:35.010> clothes<00:02:36.010> like<00:02:36.220> this<00:02:36.490> if<00:02:36.700> close<00:02:36.940> at

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
be wearing clothes like this if close at

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.760 
be wearing clothes like this if close at
all<00:02:37.210> and<00:02:37.570> we<00:02:37.960> wouldn't<00:02:38.230> see<00:02:38.320> paintings<00:02:38.560> on<00:02:38.740> the

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 
all and we wouldn't see paintings on the

all and we wouldn't see paintings on the
wall<00:02:38.980> we<00:02:39.100> wouldn't<00:02:39.340> see<00:02:39.460> like<00:02:39.640> finished

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
wall we wouldn't see like finished

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:41.720 
wall we wouldn't see like finished
design<00:02:40.270> is<00:02:40.450> this<00:02:40.660> early<00:02:41.170> in<00:02:41.260> development

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
design is this early in development

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.310 
design is this early in development
because<00:02:42.730> they<00:02:43.360> would<00:02:43.510> have<00:02:43.630> to<00:02:43.660> scrap<00:02:44.080> this

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
because they would have to scrap this

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.280 
because they would have to scrap this
all<00:02:44.620> to<00:02:45.520> make<00:02:45.700> the<00:02:45.970> better-looking<00:02:46.630> clothing

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
all to make the better-looking clothing

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:48.780 
all to make the better-looking clothing
for<00:02:47.440> the<00:02:47.500> actual<00:02:47.860> game<00:02:47.890> unless<00:02:48.550> you're<00:02:48.760> just

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
for the actual game unless you're just

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:49.830 
for the actual game unless you're just
going<00:02:49.000> to<00:02:49.060> make<00:02:49.120> the<00:02:49.240> game<00:02:49.390> look<00:02:49.420> like<00:02:49.720> this

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
going to make the game look like this

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.330 
going to make the game look like this
and<00:02:50.050> this<00:02:50.170> is<00:02:50.350> what<00:02:50.470> the<00:02:50.560> sims<00:02:50.770> 4<00:02:50.860> looked<00:02:51.190> like

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
and this is what the sims 4 looked like

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.580 
and this is what the sims 4 looked like
if<00:02:51.550> this<00:02:52.150> is<00:02:52.360> what<00:02:52.630> the<00:02:52.810> sims<00:02:53.020> 4<00:02:53.110> is<00:02:53.350> going<00:02:53.500> to

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
if this is what the sims 4 is going to

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.340 
if this is what the sims 4 is going to
look<00:02:53.680> like<00:02:53.710> this<00:02:54.070> is<00:02:54.520> the<00:02:54.550> death<00:02:54.970> of<00:02:55.240> the<00:02:56.140> sims

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350 
look like this is the death of the sims

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:59.100 
look like this is the death of the sims
franchise<00:02:56.800> and<00:02:57.070> EA<00:02:57.430> killed<00:02:57.760> it<00:02:57.910> so<00:02:58.450> but<00:02:59.080> I

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
franchise and EA killed it so but I

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:00.990 
franchise and EA killed it so but I
don't<00:02:59.380> think<00:02:59.530> this<00:02:59.710> is<00:02:59.800> the<00:02:59.920> sims<00:03:00.130> 4<00:03:00.220> it's

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
don't think this is the sims 4 it's

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.440 
don't think this is the sims 4 it's
definitely<00:03:01.720> a<00:03:01.750> sims<00:03:02.110> game<00:03:02.670> not<00:03:03.670> since<00:03:04.030> for<00:03:04.270> it

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
definitely a sims game not since for it

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:05.610 
definitely a sims game not since for it
might<00:03:04.630> be<00:03:04.750> a<00:03:04.780> sims<00:03:05.020> ii<00:03:05.140> and<00:03:05.260> someone<00:03:05.500> could

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
might be a sims ii and someone could

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.110 
might be a sims ii and someone could
have<00:03:05.680> photoshopped<00:03:05.740> these<00:03:06.340> plumb<00:03:06.670> bobs<00:03:06.910> in

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
have photoshopped these plumb bobs in

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.790 
have photoshopped these plumb bobs in
there<00:03:07.330> could<00:03:08.320> be<00:03:08.350> something<00:03:08.620> completely

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:08.800 
there could be something completely

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.330 
there could be something completely
different<00:03:09.420> because<00:03:10.420> the<00:03:10.540> only<00:03:10.570> thing<00:03:10.780> that

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
different because the only thing that

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.120 
different because the only thing that
says<00:03:12.340> sim<00:03:12.670> to<00:03:12.880> me<00:03:13.030> is<00:03:13.240> on<00:03:13.450> the<00:03:14.350> plum<00:03:14.590> bombs<00:03:14.860> and

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.130 
says sim to me is on the plum bombs and

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:16.320 
says sim to me is on the plum bombs and
someone<00:03:15.400> could<00:03:15.520> have<00:03:15.580> photoshopped<00:03:15.640> those<00:03:16.150> in

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.330 
someone could have photoshopped those in

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:20.480 
someone could have photoshopped those in
there
