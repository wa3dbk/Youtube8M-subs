00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.210 
great that i did get the toxic gogh
however<00:01:31.110> because<00:01:31.560> Rotom<00:01:31.799> can<00:01:31.950> be<00:01:32.040> one<00:01:32.130> of

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
however because Rotom can be one of

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.490 
however because Rotom can be one of
those<00:01:32.310> annoying<00:01:32.430> pokes<00:01:32.880> with<00:01:33.119> decent<00:01:33.720> special

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
those annoying pokes with decent special

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.520 
those annoying pokes with decent special
attacks<00:01:34.799> that<00:01:35.130> and<00:01:35.720> definitely<00:01:36.720> respectable

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
attacks that and definitely respectable

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.130 
attacks that and definitely respectable
defensive<00:01:37.979> stats<00:01:38.220> so<00:01:39.090> toxic<00:01:39.570> on<00:01:39.689> Rotom<00:01:39.990> is

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
defensive stats so toxic on Rotom is

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.200 
defensive stats so toxic on Rotom is
great<00:01:40.470> a<00:01:40.740> lot<00:01:41.040> of<00:01:41.070> residual<00:01:41.430> damage<00:01:41.610> and<00:01:42.000> once

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
great a lot of residual damage and once

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.219 
great a lot of residual damage and once
I<00:01:42.299> have<00:01:42.420> my<00:01:42.450> entry<00:01:42.780> hazards<00:01:43.079> up<00:01:43.200> even<00:01:43.530> better

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 
I have my entry hazards up even better

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:47.810 
I have my entry hazards up even better
so<00:01:46.229> knowing<00:01:46.649> Rotom<00:01:46.950> can't<00:01:47.250> do<00:01:47.369> much<00:01:47.520> to<00:01:47.700> the

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
so knowing Rotom can't do much to the

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.300 
so knowing Rotom can't do much to the

in<00:02:16.080> the<00:02:16.110> game<00:02:16.400> however<00:02:17.400> he<00:02:17.490> makes<00:02:17.670> a<00:02:17.730> good

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
in the game however he makes a good

in the game however he makes a good
prediction<00:02:18.270> here<00:02:18.420> as<00:02:18.540> I<00:02:18.630> switch<00:02:18.840> into<00:02:19.080> my

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
prediction here as I switch into my

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.450 
prediction here as I switch into my
chandelier<00:02:19.470> and<00:02:19.650> he<00:02:19.770> goes<00:02:19.860> for<00:02:19.980> the<00:02:20.070> psychic

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
chandelier and he goes for the psychic

instead<00:02:20.760> of<00:02:20.820> the<00:02:20.880> folks<00:02:21.090> blast<00:02:21.420> so<00:02:22.380> I<00:02:22.410> mean<00:02:22.740> I

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
instead of the folks blast so I mean I

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.410 
instead of the folks blast so I mean I
would<00:02:23.280> rather<00:02:23.430> have<00:02:23.640> played<00:02:23.850> it<00:02:23.940> safe<00:02:24.150> and

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
would rather have played it safe and

essentially in this match I mean he

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.530 
essentially in this match I mean he
wouldn't<00:02:28.950> he<00:02:29.190> was<00:02:29.310> suitable<00:02:29.820> to<00:02:29.940> do<00:02:30.090> a<00:02:30.120> lot<00:02:30.330> but

attack<00:04:40.050> however<00:04:40.680> it's<00:04:40.800> low<00:04:40.980> speed<00:04:41.250> is<00:04:41.370> pretty

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
attack however it's low speed is pretty

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:42.740 
attack however it's low speed is pretty
much<00:04:41.610> its<00:04:41.790> Achilles<00:04:42.000> heel<00:04:42.240> because<00:04:42.390> it<00:04:42.570> can<00:04:42.660> be

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 
much its Achilles heel because it can be

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:44.450 
much its Achilles heel because it can be
easily<00:04:43.140> revenge<00:04:43.590> killed<00:04:43.860> by<00:04:43.980> any<00:04:44.130> powerful

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 
easily revenge killed by any powerful

attacker on either side of the spectrum

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:48.620 
attacker on either side of the spectrum
he's<00:04:47.190> watching<00:04:47.490> in<00:04:47.550> jellicent<00:04:48.060> which<00:04:48.240> was

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:48.630 
he's watching in jellicent which was

he's watching in jellicent which was
kind<00:04:48.870> of<00:04:48.900> surprising<00:04:48.960> to<00:04:49.410> me<00:04:49.500> I<00:04:49.530> don't<00:04:49.710> know<00:04:49.770> if

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860 
kind of surprising to me I don't know if

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:51.170 
kind of surprising to me I don't know if
he<00:04:49.920> predicted<00:04:50.220> me<00:04:50.340> to<00:04:50.430> still<00:04:50.640> be<00:04:50.730> a<00:04:50.760> special

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:51.180 
he predicted me to still be a special

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.420 
he predicted me to still be a special
attacker<00:04:51.450> but<00:04:52.080> I<00:04:52.110> do<00:04:52.320> carry<00:04:52.680> crunch<00:04:53.010> so<00:04:53.280> that

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430 
attacker but I do carry crunch so that

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:54.890 
attacker but I do carry crunch so that
was<00:04:53.550> easily<00:04:53.730> gonna<00:04:53.970> k.o<00:04:54.240> from<00:04:54.510> the<00:04:54.600> range<00:04:54.780> that

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900 
was easily gonna k.o from the range that

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:56.630 
was easily gonna k.o from the range that
it<00:04:55.050> was<00:04:55.140> at<00:04:55.290> especially<00:04:55.950> after<00:04:56.250> the<00:04:56.430> entry

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:56.640 
it was at especially after the entry

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:59.840 
it was at especially after the entry
hazard<00:04:56.910> damage<00:04:57.800> so<00:04:58.800> I<00:04:58.830> don't<00:04:58.920> know<00:04:59.250> what<00:04:59.580> he

00:04:59.840 --> 00:04:59.850 
hazard damage so I don't know what he

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:01.760 
hazard damage so I don't know what he
was<00:04:59.970> thinking<00:05:00.030> there<00:05:00.660> I<00:05:00.900> really<00:05:01.590> don't<00:05:01.650> know

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:01.770 
was thinking there I really don't know

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:04.040 
was thinking there I really don't know
so<00:05:02.520> pricking<00:05:03.030> you<00:05:03.270> turn<00:05:03.480> here<00:05:03.780> with<00:05:03.960> the

before going down to another hammer arm
let<00:05:36.450> me<00:05:36.510> go<00:05:36.630> into<00:05:36.780> my<00:05:36.990> WTF<00:05:37.710> cloud<00:05:37.920> and<00:05:38.070> make<00:05:38.160> a

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:38.190 
let me go into my WTF cloud and make a

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:40.160 
let me go into my WTF cloud and make a
crucial<00:05:38.730> prediction<00:05:39.120> here<00:05:39.270> I<00:05:39.450> go<00:05:39.930> for<00:05:40.110> the

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:40.170 
crucial prediction here I go for the

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:41.570 
crucial prediction here I go for the
payback<00:05:40.560> instead<00:05:40.890> of<00:05:40.950> bulking<00:05:41.250> up<00:05:41.400> on<00:05:41.550> a

payback instead of bulking up on a
hammer<00:05:41.850> arm<00:05:42.090> and<00:05:42.630> he<00:05:42.720> switches<00:05:42.960> into

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:43.230 
hammer arm and he switches into

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:46.310 
hammer arm and he switches into
reuniclus<00:05:43.970> even<00:05:44.970> without<00:05:45.180> the<00:05:45.540> boost<00:05:45.930> from

reuniclus even without the boost from

reuniclus even without the boost from

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:48.720 
like x tube on payback because he

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:50.030 
like x tube on payback because he
switched<00:05:48.990> out<00:05:49.140> instead<00:05:49.380> of<00:05:49.440> attacking<00:05:49.740> me

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:50.040 
switched out instead of attacking me

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:52.220 
switched out instead of attacking me
it's<00:05:50.580> still<00:05:50.790> 50<00:05:50.970> base<00:05:51.270> powers<00:05:51.570> out<00:05:51.720> of<00:05:51.810> 100<00:05:52.110> it

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:53.360 
it's still 50 base powers out of 100 it
still<00:05:52.440> takes<00:05:52.620> him<00:05:52.740> down<00:05:52.830> into<00:05:53.130> the<00:05:53.220> range

where I can mock punch and take him out

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.390
