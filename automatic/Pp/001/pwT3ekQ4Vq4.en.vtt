00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
okay if you've been following along with

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.530 
okay if you've been following along with
the<00:00:10.410> article<00:00:10.710> we've<00:00:11.639> been<00:00:11.790> discussing<00:00:12.179> ways

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
the article we've been discussing ways

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.480 
the article we've been discussing ways
to<00:00:12.599> get<00:00:12.929> the<00:00:13.050> most<00:00:13.230> out<00:00:13.440> of<00:00:13.469> your<00:00:13.620> hip<00:00:13.920> hop<00:00:14.130> drum

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
to get the most out of your hip hop drum

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.720 
to get the most out of your hip hop drum
loops<00:00:14.790> and<00:00:15.110> one<00:00:16.110> way<00:00:16.259> to<00:00:16.320> do<00:00:16.619> that<00:00:16.830> is<00:00:17.099> to

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
loops and one way to do that is to

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.150 
loops and one way to do that is to
instantly<00:00:18.180> turn<00:00:18.509> your<00:00:18.810> drum<00:00:19.080> loops<00:00:19.349> into<00:00:19.680> drum

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
instantly turn your drum loops into drum

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.790 
instantly turn your drum loops into drum
kits<00:00:20.550> using<00:00:21.390> ableton<00:00:21.899> sliced<00:00:22.320> a<00:00:22.560> MIDI<00:00:22.800> feature

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:24.800 
kits using ableton sliced a MIDI feature

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:34.360 
kits using ableton sliced a MIDI feature
you<00:00:25.800> zoom<00:00:26.099> in<00:00:26.309> just<00:00:26.489> a<00:00:26.669> bit

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:34.370 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.330 

so<00:00:35.370> we've<00:00:35.489> got<00:00:35.640> a<00:00:35.670> nice<00:00:35.910> arm<00:00:36.210> B<00:00:36.420> drum<00:00:36.720> loop<00:00:36.960> here

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:37.340 
so we've got a nice arm B drum loop here

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.210 
so we've got a nice arm B drum loop here
and<00:00:38.340> we<00:00:38.490> want<00:00:38.670> to<00:00:38.760> turn<00:00:38.940> this<00:00:39.090> into<00:00:39.330> a<00:00:39.450> drum<00:00:39.810> kit

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:40.220 
and we want to turn this into a drum kit

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.640 
and we want to turn this into a drum kit
so<00:00:41.220> if<00:00:41.310> I<00:00:41.400> right<00:00:41.670> click<00:00:42.000> on<00:00:42.180> my<00:00:42.390> loop<00:00:42.690> I<00:00:42.990> get<00:00:43.620> a

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:43.650 
so if I right click on my loop I get a

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.340 
so if I right click on my loop I get a
drop-down<00:00:44.220> menu<00:00:44.700> and<00:00:44.910> I<00:00:45.510> just<00:00:45.780> scroll<00:00:46.110> down

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
drop-down menu and I just scroll down

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
and choose slice the new MIDI track now

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.510 
and choose slice the new MIDI track now
once<00:00:51.060> I<00:00:51.210> do<00:00:51.270> that<00:00:51.630> I'll<00:00:52.260> get<00:00:52.470> a<00:00:52.530> dialog<00:00:53.280> box

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
once I do that I'll get a dialog box

I've<00:01:04.320> got<00:01:04.350> warp<00:01:04.769> markers<00:01:05.630> transient<00:01:06.630> bars

00:01:07.249 --> 00:01:07.259 
I've got warp markers transient bars

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:10.100 
I've got warp markers transient bars

eight sixteen thirty second notes and
that<00:01:10.620> sort<00:01:10.890> of<00:01:10.979> thing

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090

that sort of thing
for<00:01:12.780> drum<00:01:13.020> loops<00:01:13.290> if<00:01:13.590> you<00:01:13.770> want<00:01:13.979> to<00:01:14.070> get<00:01:14.220> each

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
for drum loops if you want to get each

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.520 
for drum loops if you want to get each
of<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.760> individual<00:01:15.420> slices<00:01:15.780> within<00:01:16.409> that

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
of the individual slices within that

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.660 
of the individual slices within that
loop<00:01:16.860> I<00:01:17.070> recommend<00:01:17.970> transient<00:01:19.400> so<00:01:20.400> and<00:01:20.549> then

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
loop I recommend transient so and then

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.020 
loop I recommend transient so and then
we<00:01:20.820> have<00:01:21.030> our<00:01:21.299> slicing<00:01:21.930> preset<00:01:22.670> now<00:01:23.670> this<00:01:23.850> is

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
we have our slicing preset now this is

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.090 
we have our slicing preset now this is
more<00:01:24.240> tailored<00:01:24.690> around<00:01:24.810> when<00:01:25.500> you<00:01:25.590> convert<00:01:25.799> it

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
more tailored around when you convert it

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.800 
more tailored around when you convert it
to<00:01:26.130> a<00:01:26.280> MIDI<00:01:26.610> do<00:01:26.850> you<00:01:26.970> want<00:01:27.180> some<00:01:27.450> kind<00:01:27.630> of

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
effect on it and that sort of thing you

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.580 
effect on it and that sort of thing you
see<00:01:30.690> some<00:01:31.110> reverb<00:01:31.590> delays<00:01:32.780> you<00:01:33.780> know<00:01:33.960> a<00:01:33.990> slow

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
see some reverb delays you know a slow

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
it's instantly sliced all these samples

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.580 
it's instantly sliced all these samples
in<00:01:52.229> this<00:01:52.500> lick<00:01:53.299> to<00:01:54.299> a<00:01:54.330> MIDI<00:01:54.600> track<00:01:54.689> for<00:01:55.260> me<00:01:55.409> and

in this lick to a MIDI track for me and

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.380 
in this lick to a MIDI track for me and
you<00:01:55.830> can<00:01:55.979> see<00:01:56.010> it<00:01:56.369> pulled<00:01:56.640> up<00:01:56.760> a<00:01:56.909> drum<00:01:57.180> rack

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
you can see it pulled up a drum rack

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.780 
you can see it pulled up a drum rack
here<00:01:57.750> and<00:01:57.960> I've<00:01:58.439> got<00:01:58.650> all<00:01:58.860> of<00:01:58.890> my<00:01:59.040> individual

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
here and I've got all of my individual

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:08.679 
here and I've got all of my individual
slices<00:02:00.619> so<00:02:01.619> now<00:02:01.799> I<00:02:01.830> can<00:02:02.070> play<00:02:02.280> my<00:02:02.549> own<00:02:02.700> groove

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:08.689 

00:02:08.689 --> 00:02:12.399 

so<00:02:09.689> this<00:02:09.810> is<00:02:09.959> very<00:02:10.229> useful<00:02:10.769> very<00:02:11.039> effective

00:02:12.399 --> 00:02:12.409 
so this is very useful very effective

00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:15.530 
so this is very useful very effective
and<00:02:13.409> can<00:02:13.560> save<00:02:13.769> you<00:02:13.799> a<00:02:13.950> lot<00:02:14.189> of<00:02:14.219> time<00:02:14.579> you<00:02:15.389> know

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
and can save you a lot of time you know

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:16.909 
and can save you a lot of time you know
so<00:02:15.689> you<00:02:15.779> don't<00:02:15.930> have<00:02:16.019> to<00:02:16.139> bounce<00:02:16.319> down<00:02:16.650> one

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:16.919 
so you don't have to bounce down one

00:02:16.919 --> 00:02:17.510 
so you don't have to bounce down one
shot<00:02:17.219> way

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
shot way

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.780 
shot way
organize<00:02:18.360> them<00:02:18.570> into<00:02:18.720> folders<00:02:18.840> and<00:02:19.580> then<00:02:20.580> load
