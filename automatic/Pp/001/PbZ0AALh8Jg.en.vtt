00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
could be a red card it's a long way back

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.539 
could be a red card it's a long way back
from<00:02:00.420> here<00:02:00.509> can<00:02:01.500> he<00:02:01.590> possibly<00:02:01.860> find<00:02:02.429> an

from here can he possibly find an

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.359 
from here can he possibly find an
equaliser<00:02:03.149> after<00:02:03.659> that<00:02:03.840> so<00:02:04.440> so<00:02:04.799> sorry<00:02:05.100> he
