00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:19.850 

we<00:00:18.180> both<00:00:18.420> been<00:00:18.720> working<00:00:18.870> making<00:00:19.410> instruments

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:19.860 
we both been working making instruments

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:22.850 
we both been working making instruments
for<00:00:20.040> 30<00:00:20.850> years<00:00:21.210> and<00:00:21.510> is<00:00:21.750> exciting<00:00:22.230> doing<00:00:22.440> a<00:00:22.500> new

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:22.860 
for 30 years and is exciting doing a new

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:24.530 
for 30 years and is exciting doing a new
project<00:00:22.890> this<00:00:23.460> and<00:00:23.700> the<00:00:23.820> second<00:00:24.119> time<00:00:24.240> we<00:00:24.360> work

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:24.540 
project this and the second time we work

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:29.010 
project this and the second time we work
together<00:00:24.690> so<00:00:25.560> far<00:00:26.400> very<00:00:26.460> good

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:29.020 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.450 

this<00:00:30.020> incident<00:00:30.440> that<00:00:30.560> we're<00:00:30.680> making<00:00:31.040> is<00:00:31.190> based

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:31.460 
this incident that we're making is based

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.110 
this incident that we're making is based
on<00:00:32.029> ideas<00:00:32.810> of<00:00:33.050> Stradivari<00:00:33.610> that<00:00:34.610> we<00:00:34.880> then

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:35.120 
on ideas of Stradivari that we then

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.060 
on ideas of Stradivari that we then
shortened<00:00:35.600> a<00:00:35.690> bit<00:00:35.870> because<00:00:36.230> you<00:00:36.530> don't<00:00:36.770> need<00:00:37.040> a

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.070 
shortened a bit because you don't need a

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:43.990 
shortened a bit because you don't need a
particularly<00:00:37.940> big<00:00:38.150> cello<00:00:38.570> for<00:00:38.989> a<00:00:39.020> big<00:00:39.260> sound

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.660 

we're<00:00:45.000> looking<00:00:45.240> for<00:00:45.390> that<00:00:45.540> robust<00:00:46.080> sound

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670 
we're looking for that robust sound

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:48.800 
we're looking for that robust sound
something<00:00:47.670> is<00:00:47.760> you<00:00:47.910> can<00:00:48.000> use<00:00:48.150> of<00:00:48.330> solo<00:00:48.540> work

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:48.810 
something is you can use of solo work

something is you can use of solo work
and<00:00:49.110> yet<00:00:49.530> it<00:00:49.620> has<00:00:49.740> subtleties<00:00:50.250> and<00:00:50.430> enough

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
and yet it has subtleties and enough

reasons this particular piece of wood I

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.530 
reasons this particular piece of wood I
think<00:01:22.979> has<00:01:23.130> about<00:01:23.369> 200<00:01:23.940> grain<00:01:24.149> lines<00:01:24.390> from

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
think has about 200 grain lines from

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.859 
think has about 200 grain lines from
side<00:01:24.780> to<00:01:24.810> side<00:01:24.930> so<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:26.250> tree<00:01:26.490> was<00:01:26.729> planted<00:01:26.940> at

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
side to side so the tree was planted at

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.320 
side to side so the tree was planted at
the<00:01:27.990> time<00:01:28.229> of<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.710> French<00:01:28.890> Revolution<00:01:29.330> which

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:30.330 
the time of the French Revolution which

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:35.150 
the time of the French Revolution which
is<00:01:30.360> quite<00:01:30.690> an<00:01:30.780> extraordinary<00:01:30.990> thought<00:01:34.160> the

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:35.160 
is quite an extraordinary thought the

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.400 
is quite an extraordinary thought the
neck<00:01:35.340> is<00:01:35.580> really<00:01:35.850> initially<00:01:36.750> it's<00:01:36.899> completely

separate<00:01:37.770> you<00:01:37.860> can<00:01:37.890> do<00:01:38.100> that<00:01:38.250> at<00:01:38.430> any<00:01:38.640> stage

separate you can do that at any stage
you<00:01:39.000> have<00:01:39.270> a<00:01:39.420> design<00:01:39.780> for<00:01:39.810> a<00:01:40.530> head<00:01:40.800> you<00:01:41.369> cut<00:01:41.580> it

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.700 
instrument that you get in the end she's
can't<00:02:26.240> really<00:02:26.540> correct<00:02:26.690> once<00:02:27.200> you've<00:02:27.380> decided

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:27.710 
can't really correct once you've decided

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:28.960 
can't really correct once you've decided
if<00:02:27.980> you're<00:02:28.100> going<00:02:28.220> to<00:02:28.310> start<00:02:28.550> the<00:02:28.670> hollowing

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
if you're going to start the hollowing

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.410 
if you're going to start the hollowing
there<00:02:29.930> I<00:02:30.350> think<00:02:31.100> experience<00:02:31.490> comes<00:02:31.910> into<00:02:32.180> it

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
there I think experience comes into it

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.270 
there I think experience comes into it
much<00:02:32.810> more<00:02:33.110> than<00:02:33.170> in<00:02:33.470> anything<00:02:33.860> else<00:02:34.070> if<00:02:34.220> you

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
much more than in anything else if you

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.320 
much more than in anything else if you
make<00:02:34.460> a<00:02:34.490> mistake<00:02:34.850> there

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
make a mistake there

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.210 
make a mistake there
well<00:02:35.870> then<00:02:36.200> sometimes<00:02:36.620> it<00:02:36.770> just<00:02:36.920> I<00:02:37.040> should

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
well then sometimes it just I should

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.610 
well then sometimes it just I should
make<00:02:37.340> a<00:02:37.370> new<00:02:37.460> front<00:02:37.910> or<00:02:38.120> a<00:02:38.150> new<00:02:38.360> back<00:02:38.620> that

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
make a new front or a new back that

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:45.760 
make a new front or a new back that
hasn't<00:02:39.830> happened<00:02:40.190> very<00:02:40.370> much<00:02:44.410> with<00:02:45.410> Kai

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:45.770 
hasn't happened very much with Kai

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.040 
hasn't happened very much with Kai
myself<00:02:46.160> working<00:02:46.460> together<00:02:46.780> having<00:02:47.780> the<00:02:47.870> two

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.050 
myself working together having the two

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:49.630 
myself working together having the two
influences<00:02:48.620> coming<00:02:48.830> together<00:02:48.980> I<00:02:49.220> admire<00:02:49.520> his

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
influences coming together I admire his

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.400 
influences coming together I admire his
work<00:02:49.670> very<00:02:50.030> much<00:02:50.240> and<00:02:50.710> it's<00:02:51.710> it's<00:02:52.670> a<00:02:52.940> great

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
work very much and it's it's a great

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:56.020 
work very much and it's it's a great
combination<00:02:54.410> really<00:02:54.920> but<00:02:55.640> actually<00:02:55.910> I<00:02:55.940> think

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
combination really but actually I think

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.120 
combination really but actually I think
more<00:02:56.210> importantly<00:02:56.660> I<00:02:56.720> actually<00:02:56.900> I<00:02:57.230> quite<00:02:57.800> like

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
more importantly I actually I quite like

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:59.770 
more importantly I actually I quite like
the<00:02:58.310> sound<00:02:58.610> he<00:02:58.790> makes<00:02:58.970> on<00:02:59.150> his<00:02:59.300> instruments

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
the sound he makes on his instruments

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:20.770 
the sound he makes on his instruments
I'm<00:02:59.870> not<00:02:59.990> gonna<00:03:00.110> say<00:03:00.230> I<00:03:00.260> really<00:03:00.560> like<00:03:00.860> it

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:26.150
