00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:15.160
 he welcomed the representatives of the press 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:16.190
 our small press conference after the 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.130
 partie against 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:20.930
 although it's from Rosenheim at first 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:25.070
 Of course congratulations to ours 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:28.360
 guest trainer to victory and there it is 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:31.670
 then the first words to the game 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:33.830
 nicely called aloud to the game we have 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:35.390
 very weakly we started to 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:40.129
 many badges in their own third 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:42.320
 made slice losses then the second 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:46.840
 Tor is a bit controversial for me 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:50.150
 But that was always so 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:51.530
 then second third we have essential 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.750
 better come into play we have more 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.330
 We were able to produce pressure simply 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.970
 then I was closer to the man 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:01.309
 also this first ten minutes in the 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:03.379
 last third then the last five 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:04.640
 minutes in the last third you are 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:06.740
 already come swimming a bit 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.880
 we also have disc loss again 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.979
 I get off where you only get the slice out 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.409
 the man has to take pressure to jump 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:15.860
 Partly we do not have a good contest there 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:18.080
 then you are lucky then too 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.470
 the game wants to be brought over time 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:23.420
 Of course, very satisfied with four games 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:25.360
 won and we have we have a lot 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:29.090
 You have to work very hard today 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:34.280
 thank these points and women 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:35.630
 ask if you design for 1 2 teufer 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.100
 it is controversial they certainly have 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.730
 I'll take a look at the woman 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.050
 blue line 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:42.020
 or why they say that was controversial 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:53.900
 the 0 2 that I have got exactly that 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:57.410
 See what they look like then mike 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:02:00.470
 Thank you very much first evening 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:02.990
 I would be after franz and his team 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.860
 I 'm actually very, too 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.530
 seen similarly 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:11.050
 bit out in the first third 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:14.480
 and have a lot of pressure in Rosenheim 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:16.629
 set it had enough chances 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:20.750
 a bit too little efficient 

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:23.510
 but in the running game, starbulls in that 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.250
 mirror come and I have exactly 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.870
 my team said after the game 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.460
 these guys we play against 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.520
 a top team 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:33.470
 There was a chance on both sides 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.660
 I think the circuit in all honesty it 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.580
 exactly what your guys said is for 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.280
 I think the valley is over 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.680
 won a few more battles and 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:46.220
 that was the difference but it was 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.510
 not the use or laziness or something 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.770
 what of my team you have 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.020
 given everything 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:54.530
 want with only five defenders of the 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:55.250
 already heavy but the guys have 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.460
 endeavored 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:00.680
 and although I'm never satisfied with that 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:03.290
 another defeat it was today 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:06.730
 case of having two good teams 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.730
 a good lot delivered 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:16.100
 the 3 2 hunter lets the puck forward 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:17.570
 should bounce off something else before a mistake 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:21.170
 or can happen 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:25.340
 32 yes somebody once lost in 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:29.500
 Our third honestly who that was 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:33.050
 I have not seen but video opened 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:36.710
 and in the little things and that is 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:38.570
 also a point of the little things are 

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:41.450
 always important and you have that too 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:43.220
 This is also part of me and above all 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:46.400
 against a good opponent 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:48.740
 That's exactly what you have to do for everyone 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:51.500
 centimeter fight and I believe both 

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:53.930
 have teams have good times 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:55.030
 played and finally the right one 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:58.880
 time 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:04:03.170
 Rosenheim was a bit more efficient in 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:04.310
 lyon fans again the biggest danger go 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:06.680
 today certainly from the purely with 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:08.570
 McPherson and thereby half of all 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.670
 chances for that a bit that 

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:11.990
 Other rey the kokerei not so good 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:14.180
 it's like it was last year 

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:16.850
 I did not think so because that was it 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:17.359
 last year before vancouver cosic his 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:20.120
 line 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:24.500
 hot was then mac version of his series 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:27.800
 was a bit colt cosic line works 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:30.740
 very good practice they put a lot of pressure on 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:33.140
 our opponent or pompeys have to date 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:37.130
 elegance frame of the series 

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:40.289
 but hopefully the super replacement man 

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:43.529
 for bombis other players though 

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:46.919
 the conecon do not travel this 

00:04:43.529 --> 00:04:48.020
 accused with full mcpherson his 

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:51.119
 line 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:51.689
 offensive is exactly what we expect from 

00:04:51.119 --> 00:04:54.629
 this series 

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:57.360
 and to the conclusion in my efficiency 

00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:59.069
 only one last does not know three minutes 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:02.339
 I believe the Jihad three top chances 

00:04:59.069 --> 00:05:07.069
 had and only seriously disappointed 

00:05:02.339 --> 00:05:11.569
 but at the moment but tomorrow will be again 

00:05:07.069 --> 00:05:11.569
 seem I believe and it goes on 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:32.459
 it's not french you bring you bring 

00:05:20.309 --> 00:05:36.270
 you bring you bring the match okay 

00:05:32.459 --> 00:05:37.860
 then thank you again at 2333 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:39.599
 watch and we hope that too 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:41.039
 the next sunday in the game against 

00:05:39.599 --> 00:05:42.389
 Heilbronn to be here again with the 

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:45.860
 imperial court come to all of you 

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:45.860
 nice week and thank you
