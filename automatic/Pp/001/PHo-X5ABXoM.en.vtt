we've<00:00:29.189> got<00:00:29.369> an<00:00:29.519> audio<00:00:29.970> layer<00:00:30.269> I<00:00:30.949> can<00:00:33.649> drop<00:00:34.649> that

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
we've got an audio layer I can drop that

timeline<00:00:40.379> that<00:00:40.890> I<00:00:40.950> have<00:00:41.100> open<00:00:41.520> and<00:00:41.760> check<00:00:42.059> for

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
timeline that I have open and check for

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.930 
timeline that I have open and check for
layers<00:00:42.600> with<00:00:42.809> audio<00:00:43.200> and<00:00:43.579> if<00:00:44.579> you<00:00:44.760> haven't

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
layers with audio and if you haven't

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.430 
layers with audio and if you haven't
have<00:00:45.149> multiple<00:00:45.600> layers<00:00:45.809> you<00:00:46.050> just<00:00:46.200> want<00:00:46.379> to

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
have multiple layers you just want to

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.950 
have multiple layers you just want to
make<00:00:46.649> sure<00:00:46.680> that<00:00:47.129> you<00:00:47.399> get<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.360> right<00:00:48.660> one

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
make sure that you get the right one

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.950 
make sure that you get the right one
selected<00:00:49.800> that<00:00:49.980> you<00:00:50.070> want<00:00:50.250> analyzed<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:51.149> then

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
selected that you want analyzed and then

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.720 
selected that you want analyzed and then
it's<00:00:52.110> automatically<00:00:52.890> picked<00:00:53.160> up<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.489> layer<00:00:53.670> I

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
it's automatically picked up the layer I

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.840 
it's automatically picked up the layer I
have<00:00:53.850> selected<00:00:54.480> as<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.809> mouth<00:00:54.989> layer<00:00:55.289> and<00:00:55.850> if

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
have selected as the mouth layer and if

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.790 
have selected as the mouth layer and if
I<00:00:57.000> happen<00:00:57.149> to<00:00:57.329> have<00:00:57.480> other<00:00:57.780> layers<00:00:58.109> unlocked

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
I happen to have other layers unlocked

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.389 
I happen to have other layers unlocked
that<00:00:59.250> smart<00:00:59.640> mouth<00:00:59.789> could<00:01:00.149> potentially<00:01:00.840> sync

00:01:01.389 --> 00:01:01.399 
that smart mouth could potentially sync

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:04.250 
that smart mouth could potentially sync
then<00:01:02.399> it<00:01:02.850> would<00:01:03.000> list<00:01:03.239> them<00:01:03.449> in<00:01:03.719> this<00:01:03.899> menu

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
then it would list them in this menu

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.380 
then it would list them in this menu
here<00:01:04.500> so<00:01:04.790> you<00:01:05.790> always<00:01:06.000> want<00:01:06.150> to<00:01:06.210> make<00:01:06.360> sure

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
here so you always want to make sure

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.250 
here so you always want to make sure
these<00:01:06.810> two<00:01:07.140> layers<00:01:07.350> are<00:01:07.710> set<00:01:08.610> to<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.390> your

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.980 
target and then beyond that you can set
start<00:01:14.220> and<00:01:14.310> end<00:01:14.520> values<00:01:14.630> since<00:01:15.630> I<00:01:15.750> have<00:01:15.960> a

analyzing<00:01:53.430> the<00:01:53.640> audio<00:01:54.950> so<00:01:55.950> let's<00:01:56.189> take<00:01:56.399> a<00:01:56.430> look

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
analyzing the audio so let's take a look

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.149 
analyzing the audio so let's take a look
at<00:01:56.729> mode<00:01:57.090> first<00:01:57.560> there<00:01:58.560> are<00:01:58.590> three<00:01:58.829> different

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
at mode first there are three different

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.060 
at mode first there are three different
modes<00:01:59.420> the<00:02:00.420> modes<00:02:00.659> that<00:02:00.990> are<00:02:01.200> available

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
modes the modes that are available

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:08.419 
modes the modes that are available
depending<00:02:02.310> on<00:02:02.820> on<00:02:03.590> the<00:02:05.540> the<00:02:06.540> mouth<00:02:06.810> shape<00:02:07.429> the

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
depending on on the the mouth shape the

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.130 
depending on on the the mouth shape the
I<00:02:08.729> should<00:02:08.910> save<00:02:09.090> a<00:02:09.119> symbol<00:02:09.690> that's<00:02:10.349> in<00:02:10.649> the

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
I should save a symbol that's in the

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.920 
I should save a symbol that's in the
there<00:02:11.520> that<00:02:12.520> you<00:02:12.700> have<00:02:12.850> targeted<00:02:13.480> for<00:02:13.870> the

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
there that you have targeted for the

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:19.470 
there that you have targeted for the
mouth<00:02:14.550> so<00:02:15.569> in<00:02:16.569> this<00:02:16.720> case<00:02:17.020> this<00:02:17.920> later<00:02:18.480> excuse

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
mouth so in this case this later excuse

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.350 
mouth so in this case this later excuse
me<00:02:19.630> this<00:02:19.810> symbol<00:02:20.319> happens<00:02:20.950> to<00:02:21.100> have<00:02:21.310> labels<00:02:22.000> in

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
me this symbol happens to have labels in

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.430 
me this symbol happens to have labels in
it<00:02:22.650> so<00:02:23.650> all<00:02:24.640> of<00:02:25.000> those<00:02:25.150> labels<00:02:25.780> are<00:02:25.930> listed<00:02:26.319> in

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
it so all of those labels are listed in

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.490 
it so all of those labels are listed in
each<00:02:26.560> of<00:02:26.740> these<00:02:26.860> drop-down<00:02:27.370> menus

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
each of these drop-down menus

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.960 
each of these drop-down menus
smart-mouth<00:02:29.500> automatically<00:02:30.280> picks<00:02:30.520> up<00:02:30.700> the

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
smart-mouth automatically picks up the

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:36.360 
smart-mouth automatically picks up the
names<00:02:31.180> that<00:02:31.630> match<00:02:32.400> so<00:02:33.870> yeah<00:02:34.980> it's<00:02:35.980> good

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
names that match so yeah it's good

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:44.400 
names that match so yeah it's good
either<00:02:38.310> lol<00:02:39.310> F<00:02:40.209> and<00:02:40.930> F<00:02:41.080> P<00:02:42.060> so<00:02:43.060> if<00:02:43.300> you<00:02:43.480> if<00:02:44.200> you

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
either lol F and F P so if you if you

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:46.800 
either lol F and F P so if you if you
happen<00:02:44.709> to<00:02:44.739> name<00:02:44.980> those<00:02:45.220> with<00:02:45.489> some<00:02:46.480> part<00:02:46.750> of

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
happen to name those with some part of

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.410 
happen to name those with some part of
the<00:02:46.930> phoneme<00:02:47.350> in<00:02:47.560> it<00:02:47.680> it<00:02:47.890> will<00:02:48.420> automatically

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
the phoneme in it it will automatically

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.940 
the phoneme in it it will automatically
detect<00:02:49.989> that<00:02:50.230> in<00:02:50.410> those<00:02:50.560> cases<00:02:50.860> and<00:02:51.810> I<00:02:52.890> tend<00:02:53.890> to

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
detect that in those cases and I tend to

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.070 
detect that in those cases and I tend to
prefer<00:02:54.130> adding<00:02:54.730> labels<00:02:55.360> because<00:02:55.540> it<00:02:55.780> makes<00:02:55.959> a

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
prefer adding labels because it makes a

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.380 
prefer adding labels because it makes a
lot<00:02:56.230> easier<00:02:56.620> to<00:02:56.739> go<00:02:56.860> through<00:02:56.890> and<00:02:57.190> choose<00:02:57.400> if

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
lot easier to go through and choose if

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.330 
lot easier to go through and choose if
you<00:02:58.720> don't<00:02:58.900> happen<00:02:59.200> to<00:02:59.260> use<00:02:59.380> labels<00:02:59.650> in<00:03:00.070> your

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
you don't happen to use labels in your

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.360 
you don't happen to use labels in your
mouth<00:03:00.519> symbols<00:03:01.030> and<00:03:01.510> again<00:03:02.200> labels<00:03:02.830> and<00:03:03.100> frame

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
mouth symbols and again labels and frame

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.570 
mouth symbols and again labels and frame
numbers<00:03:04.060> are<00:03:04.300> both<00:03:04.480> for<00:03:04.780> when<00:03:05.440> you're<00:03:05.620> using<00:03:06.220> a

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:06.580 
numbers are both for when you're using a

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.030 
numbers are both for when you're using a
single<00:03:07.180> symbol<00:03:07.840> that<00:03:07.959> contains<00:03:08.410> all<00:03:08.709> of<00:03:08.890> your

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
single symbol that contains all of your

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.370 
single symbol that contains all of your
mouth<00:03:09.190> shapes<00:03:09.519> so<00:03:10.360> let's<00:03:10.480> take<00:03:10.630> a<00:03:10.660> look<00:03:10.870> take<00:03:11.320> a

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
mouth shapes so let's take a look take a

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.430 
mouth shapes so let's take a look take a
look<00:03:11.530> at<00:03:11.680> frame<00:03:11.950> numbers<00:03:13.110> so<00:03:14.110> in<00:03:14.200> frame

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
look at frame numbers so in frame

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.500 
look at frame numbers so in frame
numbers<00:03:14.800> that<00:03:14.950> have<00:03:15.100> these<00:03:15.250> steppers<00:03:16.239> again

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
numbers that have these steppers again

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.199 
numbers that have these steppers again
so<00:03:16.750> I<00:03:16.780> can<00:03:17.019> click<00:03:17.260> through<00:03:17.470> and<00:03:18.000> it<00:03:19.000> might<00:03:19.090> be<00:03:19.180> a

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
so I can click through and it might be a

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:20.729 
so I can click through and it might be a
little<00:03:19.390> bit<00:03:19.570> difficult<00:03:19.780> to<00:03:20.049> see<00:03:20.140> because<00:03:20.620> this

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
little bit difficult to see because this

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:23.310 
little bit difficult to see because this
symbol<00:03:21.130> includes<00:03:21.489> eyebrows<00:03:22.000> so<00:03:22.420> it's<00:03:23.200> a

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:23.320 
symbol includes eyebrows so it's a

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.100 
symbol includes eyebrows so it's a
little<00:03:23.860> bit<00:03:24.040> small<00:03:24.480> but<00:03:25.480> I<00:03:25.540> can<00:03:25.750> go<00:03:25.870> through<00:03:26.079> I

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.110 
little bit small but I can go through I

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:27.920 
little bit small but I can go through I
could<00:03:26.290> actually<00:03:26.440> tab<00:03:26.860> through<00:03:27.190> if<00:03:27.340> I<00:03:27.430> want<00:03:27.670> to

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
could actually tab through if I want to

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:33.319 
could actually tab through if I want to
and<00:03:28.930> change<00:03:29.290> each<00:03:29.560> of<00:03:29.709> these<00:03:30.540> and<00:03:32.040> that<00:03:33.040> is

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:33.329 
and change each of these and that is

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:36.509 
and change each of these and that is
frame<00:03:34.329> numbers<00:03:34.780> and<00:03:35.049> let's<00:03:35.890> take<00:03:36.130> a<00:03:36.160> look<00:03:36.400> at

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:36.519 
frame numbers and let's take a look at

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:40.170 
frame numbers and let's take a look at
symbols<00:03:37.150> real<00:03:37.390> quick<00:03:37.660> and<00:03:38.670> notice<00:03:39.670> that<00:03:39.880> it

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
symbols real quick and notice that it

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.110 
symbols real quick and notice that it
has<00:03:40.420> to<00:03:40.630> export<00:03:41.380> each<00:03:41.590> one<00:03:41.860> of<00:03:41.950> those<00:03:42.120> so

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
has to export each one of those so

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.960 
has to export each one of those so
symbols<00:03:44.079> mode<00:03:44.320> is<00:03:44.590> if<00:03:45.010> you<00:03:45.160> happen<00:03:45.310> have<00:03:45.670> each

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
symbols mode is if you happen have each

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:48.930 
symbols mode is if you happen have each
different<00:03:46.510> phone<00:03:47.019> in<00:03:47.230> each<00:03:47.470> mouth<00:03:47.860> shape<00:03:48.250> in

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
different phone in each mouth shape in

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:51.660 
different phone in each mouth shape in
its<00:03:49.269> own<00:03:49.450> symbol<00:03:49.750> so<00:03:50.650> you<00:03:50.709> can<00:03:50.920> use<00:03:51.100> this<00:03:51.340> and

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670 
its own symbol so you can use this and

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:53.880 
its own symbol so you can use this and
again<00:03:52.630> smart<00:03:52.959> mouth<00:03:53.110> will<00:03:53.320> automatically

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:53.890 
again smart mouth will automatically

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:56.670 
again smart mouth will automatically
detect<00:03:54.190> if<00:03:54.430> it<00:03:54.579> doesn't<00:03:54.910> find<00:03:55.180> that<00:03:55.630> your<00:03:55.900> your

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
detect if it doesn't find that your your

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.560 
detect if it doesn't find that your your
mouth<00:03:56.890> will<00:03:57.130> air<00:03:57.250> on<00:03:57.549> the<00:03:57.700> current<00:03:58.000> frame<00:03:58.269> has

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:58.570 
mouth will air on the current frame has

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:01.259 
mouth will air on the current frame has
labels<00:03:59.380> or<00:03:59.950> multiple<00:04:00.430> frames<00:04:00.700> it<00:04:01.120> will

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:01.269 
labels or multiple frames it will

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:03.569 
labels or multiple frames it will
default<00:04:01.600> to<00:04:01.690> symbols<00:04:02.140> you<00:04:03.010> can<00:04:03.040> use<00:04:03.370> this

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:03.579 
default to symbols you can use this

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:08.039 
default to symbols you can use this
limit<00:04:04.120> to<00:04:04.150> menu<00:04:04.840> to<00:04:05.400> limit<00:04:06.400> the<00:04:06.700> the<00:04:07.570> symbols

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 
that are available in each one of these

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:14.430 
that are available in each one of these
menus<00:04:11.250> to<00:04:12.250> a<00:04:12.579> particular<00:04:13.200> folder<00:04:14.200> in<00:04:14.320> the

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.440 
menus to a particular folder in the

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:18.240 
menus to a particular folder in the
library<00:04:15.930> so<00:04:16.930> I<00:04:16.959> choose<00:04:17.289> that<00:04:17.410> folder<00:04:17.620> and<00:04:17.829> it's

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 
library so I choose that folder and it's

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.509 
library so I choose that folder and it's
updated

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 
updated

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:23.420 
updated
so<00:04:21.419> now<00:04:21.690> I<00:04:21.720> actually<00:04:22.079> now<00:04:22.650> I<00:04:22.680> can<00:04:22.889> see<00:04:23.039> my<00:04:23.069> often

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
so now I actually now I can see my often

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.080 
so now I actually now I can see my often
brow<00:04:23.639> but<00:04:24.509> in<00:04:24.810> this<00:04:24.960> particular<00:04:25.259> file<00:04:26.090> there

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
brow but in this particular file there

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:32.180 
brow but in this particular file there
are<00:04:27.120> not<00:04:27.930> any<00:04:28.819> any<00:04:30.440> mouth<00:04:31.440> shapes<00:04:31.830> in

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.190 
are not any any mouth shapes in

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:35.120 
are not any any mouth shapes in
individual<00:04:32.940> symbols<00:04:33.560> so<00:04:34.560> we<00:04:34.680> won't<00:04:34.860> see<00:04:35.069> in

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:35.130 
individual symbols so we won't see in

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:37.309 
individual symbols so we won't see in
here<00:04:35.340> but<00:04:35.520> we've<00:04:35.639> got<00:04:35.789> previews<00:04:36.270> of<00:04:36.300> all<00:04:36.900> the

00:04:37.309 --> 00:04:37.319 
here but we've got previews of all the

00:04:37.319 --> 00:04:39.350 
here but we've got previews of all the
items<00:04:37.620> in<00:04:37.800> the<00:04:37.919> library<00:04:38.340> so<00:04:38.580> if<00:04:38.729> you<00:04:38.910> wanted<00:04:39.180> to

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 
items in the library so if you wanted to

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.800 
items in the library so if you wanted to
use<00:04:39.509> that<00:04:39.539> use<00:04:40.110> that<00:04:40.410> and<00:04:41.330> now<00:04:42.330> let's<00:04:42.509> go<00:04:42.630> back

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
use that use that and now let's go back

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:46.760 
use that use that and now let's go back
up<00:04:43.020> to<00:04:43.050> actions<00:04:43.590> so<00:04:44.930> as<00:04:45.930> I<00:04:46.259> said<00:04:46.500> previously

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:46.770 
up to actions so as I said previously

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:49.999 
up to actions so as I said previously
actions<00:04:47.729> are<00:04:48.240> what<00:04:48.300> smart<00:04:49.050> mouth<00:04:49.199> does<00:04:49.560> when

00:04:49.999 --> 00:04:50.009 
actions are what smart mouth does when

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:51.860 
actions are what smart mouth does when
it's<00:04:50.280> finished<00:04:50.610> analyzing<00:04:50.910> and<00:04:51.539> you<00:04:51.630> click

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870 
it's finished analyzing and you click

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:55.249 
it's finished analyzing and you click
the<00:04:52.050> tell<00:04:52.410> me<00:04:52.440> smart<00:04:52.860> mouth<00:04:53.009> button<00:04:53.430> and<00:04:54.259> so

00:04:55.249 --> 00:04:55.259 
the tell me smart mouth button and so

00:04:55.259 --> 00:04:58.189 
the tell me smart mouth button and so
the<00:04:55.530> default<00:04:55.860> method<00:04:56.250> the<00:04:57.090> default<00:04:57.419> action<00:04:57.690> is

00:04:58.189 --> 00:04:58.199 
the default method the default action is

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:01.670 
the default method the default action is
to<00:04:58.740> overwrite<00:04:59.430> any<00:04:59.699> keyframes<00:05:00.360> in<00:05:00.720> this<00:05:01.409> range

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:01.680 
to overwrite any keyframes in this range

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.950 
to overwrite any keyframes in this range
of<00:05:01.889> frames<00:05:02.130> but<00:05:02.970> you<00:05:03.120> can<00:05:03.300> also<00:05:03.449> say<00:05:03.720> new

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:03.960 
of frames but you can also say new

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:08.890 
of frames but you can also say new
keyframes<00:05:04.560> only<00:05:05.039> which<00:05:06.319> sets<00:05:07.319> your<00:05:07.560> symbol<00:05:08.130> so

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:08.900 
keyframes only which sets your symbol so

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:13.580 
keyframes only which sets your symbol so
sets<00:05:11.360> and<00:05:12.360> I<00:05:12.539> want<00:05:12.810> to<00:05:12.870> say<00:05:13.020> this<00:05:13.199> it<00:05:13.409> goes

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:13.590 
sets and I want to say this it goes

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:16.430 
sets and I want to say this it goes
through<00:05:14.039> and<00:05:14.310> it<00:05:14.909> basically<00:05:15.120> ignores<00:05:15.990> any

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:16.440 
through and it basically ignores any

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.920 
through and it basically ignores any
keyframes<00:05:17.130> that<00:05:17.280> you've<00:05:17.550> set<00:05:17.759> already<00:05:18.060> so<00:05:18.810> if

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:18.930 
keyframes that you've set already so if

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:20.779 
keyframes that you've set already so if
you<00:05:19.050> set<00:05:19.289> up<00:05:19.319> your<00:05:19.500> symbol<00:05:19.949> in<00:05:20.130> such<00:05:20.430> a<00:05:20.460> way

00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:20.789 
you set up your symbol in such a way

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:25.159 
you set up your symbol in such a way
that<00:05:22.220> you<00:05:23.220> have<00:05:23.630> items<00:05:24.630> you<00:05:24.810> don't<00:05:24.990> want

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:25.169 
that you have items you don't want

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:27.140 
that you have items you don't want
changed<00:05:25.650> you<00:05:26.340> should<00:05:26.550> use<00:05:26.729> this<00:05:26.909> new

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:27.150 
changed you should use this new

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:30.980 
changed you should use this new
keyframes<00:05:27.690> only<00:05:28.430> action<00:05:29.479> now<00:05:30.479> if<00:05:30.599> you'd<00:05:30.780> like

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:30.990 
keyframes only action now if you'd like

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:34.060 
keyframes only action now if you'd like
to<00:05:31.289> export<00:05:31.800> a<00:05:32.039> guide<00:05:32.280> layer<00:05:32.550> and<00:05:32.820> we'll<00:05:33.810> show

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:34.070 
to export a guide layer and we'll show

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:38.529 
to export a guide layer and we'll show
show<00:05:35.570> examples<00:05:36.570> of<00:05:36.900> these<00:05:37.020> in<00:05:37.229> other<00:05:37.380> videos

00:05:38.529 --> 00:05:38.539 
show examples of these in other videos

00:05:38.539 --> 00:05:40.820 
show examples of these in other videos
the<00:05:39.539> guide<00:05:39.780> there<00:05:40.020> we'll<00:05:40.199> put<00:05:40.229> an<00:05:40.530> actual

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:40.830 
the guide there we'll put an actual

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:44.810 
the guide there we'll put an actual
guide<00:05:41.099> layer<00:05:41.370> with<00:05:42.830> with<00:05:43.830> the<00:05:44.039> phonemes<00:05:44.520> in

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:44.820 
guide layer with with the phonemes in

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:47.379 
guide layer with with the phonemes in
the<00:05:45.120> layer<00:05:45.330> so<00:05:46.020> that<00:05:46.229> if<00:05:46.770> you<00:05:46.979> wanted<00:05:47.280> to

00:05:47.379 --> 00:05:47.389 
the layer so that if you wanted to

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:50.659 
the layer so that if you wanted to
lip-sync<00:05:48.389> by<00:05:48.599> hand<00:05:49.020> but<00:05:50.009> you<00:05:50.130> wanted<00:05:50.370> smart

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:50.669 
lip-sync by hand but you wanted smart

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:52.820 
lip-sync by hand but you wanted smart
mouth<00:05:50.819> to<00:05:51.000> go<00:05:51.150> through<00:05:51.479> and<00:05:51.810> make<00:05:52.319> suggestions

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:52.830 
mouth to go through and make suggestions

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:55.249 
mouth to go through and make suggestions
for<00:05:53.069> you<00:05:53.370> you'd<00:05:53.940> use<00:05:54.120> this<00:05:54.330> guide<00:05:54.569> layer<00:05:54.840> only

00:05:55.249 --> 00:05:55.259 
for you you'd use this guide layer only

00:05:55.259 --> 00:05:58.540 
for you you'd use this guide layer only
and<00:05:55.770> you<00:05:56.639> can<00:05:56.759> see<00:05:56.940> when<00:05:57.180> I<00:05:57.210> select<00:05:57.659> that<00:05:57.750> it's

00:05:58.540 --> 00:05:58.550 
and you can see when I select that it's

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:01.580 
and you can see when I select that it's
grayed<00:05:59.550> out<00:05:59.580> everything<00:06:00.270> else<00:06:00.419> here<00:06:00.840> because

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:01.590 
grayed out everything else here because

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:04.700 
grayed out everything else here because
there<00:06:01.979> there's<00:06:02.370> no<00:06:02.550> need<00:06:02.729> for<00:06:03.030> it<00:06:03.120> and<00:06:03.930> you<00:06:04.590> can

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:04.710 
there there's no need for it and you can

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:08.719 
there there's no need for it and you can
also<00:06:04.830> export<00:06:05.400> to<00:06:05.580> XML<00:06:05.930> XML<00:06:06.930> is<00:06:07.169> a<00:06:07.340> simple<00:06:08.340> text

00:06:08.719 --> 00:06:08.729 
also export to XML XML is a simple text

00:06:08.729 --> 00:06:13.129 
also export to XML XML is a simple text
format<00:06:09.240> and<00:06:10.849> the<00:06:11.849> data<00:06:12.120> that<00:06:12.240> comes<00:06:12.810> through

in this XML file will be all of the

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:17.600 
in this XML file will be all of the
mouth<00:06:16.139> shapes<00:06:16.500> with<00:06:16.800> the<00:06:16.919> corresponding

mouth shapes with the corresponding
frame<00:06:17.940> numbers<00:06:18.389> and<00:06:18.740> you<00:06:19.740> can<00:06:19.979> use<00:06:20.190> that<00:06:20.400> to

00:06:20.719 --> 00:06:20.729 
frame numbers and you can use that to

00:06:20.729 --> 00:06:25.420 
frame numbers and you can use that to
import<00:06:21.440> you<00:06:22.440> were<00:06:23.060> your<00:06:24.060> mouth<00:06:24.240> shapes<00:06:24.630> into

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:25.430 
import you were your mouth shapes into

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:29.120 
import you were your mouth shapes into
ActionScript<00:06:26.430> and<00:06:27.440> dynamically<00:06:28.440> lip<00:06:28.710> sync<00:06:28.949> if

ActionScript and dynamically lip sync if

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:31.070 
ActionScript and dynamically lip sync if
you<00:06:29.250> have<00:06:29.430> multiple<00:06:29.909> characters<00:06:30.419> or<00:06:30.690> more

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:31.080 
you have multiple characters or more

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:34.369 
you have multiple characters or more
audiophiles<00:06:31.860> this<00:06:32.669> is<00:06:32.849> a<00:06:33.150> a<00:06:33.419> good<00:06:33.810> feature<00:06:34.080> to

00:06:34.369 --> 00:06:34.379 
audiophiles this is a a good feature to

00:06:34.379 --> 00:06:35.990 
audiophiles this is a a good feature to
use<00:06:34.500> for<00:06:34.770> that<00:06:34.919> and<00:06:35.250> you<00:06:35.370> can<00:06:35.400> see<00:06:35.669> is<00:06:35.759> pretty

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:36.000 
use for that and you can see is pretty

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.420 
use for that and you can see is pretty
for<00:06:36.389> that<00:06:36.419> one<00:06:36.720> this<00:06:37.139> these<00:06:37.770> items<00:06:38.069> are<00:06:38.250> grayed

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:38.430 
for that one this these items are grayed

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:41.600 
for that one this these items are grayed
out<00:06:38.460> as<00:06:38.729> well<00:06:38.909> so<00:06:39.169> let's<00:06:40.169> take<00:06:40.379> a<00:06:40.409> look<00:06:40.919> at<00:06:41.280> the

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:41.610 
out as well so let's take a look at the

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:44.029 
out as well so let's take a look at the
last<00:06:41.970> couple<00:06:42.210> options<00:06:42.509> obviously<00:06:42.870> you'd<00:06:43.830> tell

00:06:44.029 --> 00:06:44.039 
last couple options obviously you'd tell

00:06:44.039 --> 00:06:44.839 
last couple options obviously you'd tell
me<00:06:44.069> smart-mouth

00:06:44.839 --> 00:06:44.849 
me smart-mouth

00:06:44.849 --> 00:06:46.999 
me smart-mouth
it<00:06:44.909> runs<00:06:45.210> the<00:06:45.330> analysis<00:06:45.900> and<00:06:46.110> close<00:06:46.710> will

00:06:46.999 --> 00:06:47.009 
it runs the analysis and close will

00:06:47.009 --> 00:06:50.029 
it runs the analysis and close will
close<00:06:47.220> the<00:06:47.430> panel<00:06:48.349> so<00:06:49.349> let's<00:06:49.379> take<00:06:49.650> a<00:06:49.680> look<00:06:49.919> at

00:06:50.029 --> 00:06:50.039 
close the panel so let's take a look at

00:06:50.039 --> 00:06:52.879 
close the panel so let's take a look at
the<00:06:50.190> info<00:06:50.490> button<00:06:51.020> okay<00:06:52.020> so<00:06:52.080> this<00:06:52.349> is<00:06:52.530> what<00:06:52.680> the

00:06:52.879 --> 00:06:52.889
