from the app so I set the iPhone down on

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.830 
from the app so I set the iPhone down on
the<00:00:38.160> table<00:00:38.460> and<00:00:38.610> now<00:00:38.730> I'm<00:00:38.850> gonna<00:00:39.000> hit<00:00:39.270> go<00:00:39.510> now

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
the table and now I'm gonna hit go now

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.660 
the table and now I'm gonna hit go now
one<00:00:40.050> nice<00:00:40.230> feature<00:00:40.559> is<00:00:40.860> that<00:00:40.890> when<00:00:41.190> you<00:00:41.340> hit<00:00:41.520> go

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
one nice feature is that when you hit go

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.040 
one nice feature is that when you hit go
you<00:00:41.730> get<00:00:42.000> three<00:00:42.239> seconds<00:00:42.690> to<00:00:42.780> kind<00:00:42.989> of

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
you get three seconds to kind of

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.779 
you get three seconds to kind of
stabilize<00:00:43.530> your<00:00:43.710> phone<00:00:43.890> before<00:00:44.100> it<00:00:44.309> starts<00:00:44.670> to

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
stabilize your phone before it starts to

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.760 
stabilize your phone before it starts to
spin<00:00:45.090> now<00:00:45.690> it<00:00:45.840> doesn't<00:00:46.140> actually<00:00:46.230> record

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
spin now it doesn't actually record

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.440 
spin now it doesn't actually record
audio<00:00:47.010> because<00:00:47.550> if<00:00:47.700> it<00:00:47.820> did<00:00:48.000> you<00:00:48.149> would<00:00:48.270> hear

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
audio because if it did you would hear

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.150 
audio because if it did you would hear
the<00:00:48.570> vibrating<00:00:48.989> noise<00:00:49.230> in<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.680> video<00:00:49.890> and

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
the vibrating noise in the video and

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.939 
the vibrating noise in the video and
again<00:00:50.520> this<00:00:50.879> does<00:00:51.149> take<00:00:51.420> videos<00:00:51.840> not<00:00:52.410> pictures

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
again this does take videos not pictures

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.270 
again this does take videos not pictures
and<00:00:53.160> again<00:00:53.730> also<00:00:54.090> you<00:00:54.390> cannot<00:00:55.140> take<00:00:55.559> landscape

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
and again also you cannot take landscape

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.189 
and again also you cannot take landscape
videos<00:00:56.610> it's<00:00:56.789> only<00:00:56.940> portrait<00:00:57.360> videos<00:00:57.660> so<00:00:58.170> as

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
videos it's only portrait videos so as

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.200 
videos it's only portrait videos so as
far<00:00:58.469> as<00:00:58.530> useless<00:00:58.920> for<00:00:59.280> this<00:00:59.430> app<00:00:59.699> I<00:00:59.940> don't

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
far as useless for this app I don't

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.900 
far as useless for this app I don't
really<00:01:00.480> see<00:01:00.809> how<00:01:01.079> you<00:01:01.140> could<00:01:01.559> use<00:01:01.590> it<00:01:01.829> as<00:01:02.640> far

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
really see how you could use it as far

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.170 
really see how you could use it as far
as<00:01:03.090> taking<00:01:03.600> a<00:01:04.010> realistic<00:01:05.010> video<00:01:05.250> but<00:01:05.970> it<00:01:06.150> is

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
as taking a realistic video but it is

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.969 
as taking a realistic video but it is
kind<00:01:06.570> of<00:01:06.659> fun<00:01:06.869> to<00:01:06.900> play<00:01:07.080> around<00:01:07.500> with<00:01:07.710> and

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
kind of fun to play around with and

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.580 
kind of fun to play around with and
definitely<00:01:08.460> in<00:01:08.580> my<00:01:08.610> opinion<00:01:08.760> worth<00:01:09.270> $0.99<00:01:10.200> now

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
definitely in my opinion worth $0.99 now

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.530 
definitely in my opinion worth $0.99 now
Cyclorama<00:01:11.159> suggests<00:01:11.790> that<00:01:11.880> you<00:01:12.000> use<00:01:12.210> it<00:01:12.420> on<00:01:12.479> a

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
Cyclorama suggests that you use it on a

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.960 
Cyclorama suggests that you use it on a
glass<00:01:12.900> surface<00:01:13.290> or<00:01:13.770> marble<00:01:14.250> really<00:01:14.549> anything

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
glass surface or marble really anything

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.240 
glass surface or marble really anything
shiny<00:01:15.270> I<00:01:15.630> am<00:01:16.080> using<00:01:16.290> it<00:01:16.500> on<00:01:16.619> my<00:01:16.650> wood<00:01:17.009> desk

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
shiny I am using it on my wood desk

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.550 
shiny I am using it on my wood desk
which<00:01:17.520> is<00:01:17.549> flat<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.240> smooth<00:01:18.509> it<00:01:18.750> did<00:01:19.170> work<00:01:19.350> and

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
which is flat and smooth it did work and

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.830 
which is flat and smooth it did work and
I<00:01:19.740> also<00:01:19.890> did<00:01:20.250> try<00:01:20.520> it<00:01:20.580> on<00:01:20.850> a<00:01:20.880> marble<00:01:21.360> floor<00:01:21.600> and

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
I also did try it on a marble floor and

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.780 
I also did try it on a marble floor and
that<00:01:21.930> seemed<00:01:22.200> to<00:01:22.259> work<00:01:22.470> as<00:01:22.680> well<00:01:22.979> I<00:01:23.250> didn't

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
that seemed to work as well I didn't

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.219 
that seemed to work as well I didn't
really<00:01:23.939> find<00:01:24.150> a<00:01:24.270> difference<00:01:24.630> between<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.080> two

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
really find a difference between the two

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.260 
really find a difference between the two
so<00:01:25.439> really<00:01:25.680> any<00:01:25.860> flat<00:01:26.130> surface<00:01:26.610> to<00:01:26.640> use<00:01:26.790> will

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
so really any flat surface to use will

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.660 
so really any flat surface to use will
work<00:01:27.509> one<00:01:28.049> thing<00:01:28.259> I<00:01:28.350> didn't<00:01:28.860> find<00:01:29.189> that<00:01:29.369> worked

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
work one thing I didn't find that worked

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.130 
work one thing I didn't find that worked
was<00:01:29.880> actually<00:01:30.270> tried<00:01:30.479> it<00:01:30.509> on<00:01:30.750> a<00:01:30.780> piece<00:01:31.020> of

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
was actually tried it on a piece of

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.679 
was actually tried it on a piece of
plastic<00:01:31.650> and<00:01:31.770> it<00:01:32.159> didn't<00:01:32.549> spin<00:01:32.820> at<00:01:32.880> all<00:01:33.090> now<00:01:33.659> I

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
plastic and it didn't spin at all now I

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.330 
plastic and it didn't spin at all now I
am<00:01:33.990> using<00:01:34.200> a<00:01:34.470> tempered<00:01:34.860> glass<00:01:34.979> screen

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340
