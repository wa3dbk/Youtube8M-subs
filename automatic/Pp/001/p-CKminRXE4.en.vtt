00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.770 

I<00:01:46.009> first<00:01:46.549> became<00:01:46.729> aware<00:01:47.060> of<00:01:47.360> Franklin's<00:01:47.810> work

to<00:02:18.570> get<00:02:18.690> titles<00:02:19.110> and<00:02:19.260> pieces<00:02:20.120> just<00:02:21.120> talk<00:02:21.420> a

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
to get titles and pieces just talk a

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.180 
to get titles and pieces just talk a
little<00:02:21.690> bit<00:02:21.870> about<00:02:21.900> the<00:02:22.230> work

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.510 

I<00:02:26.280> think<00:02:26.790> the<00:02:26.880> thing<00:02:27.060> that<00:02:27.890> makes<00:02:28.890> Franklin

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
I think the thing that makes Franklin

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.150 
I think the thing that makes Franklin
interesting<00:02:30.180> is<00:02:30.510> that

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.250

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
he's kind of crossing lines from being a

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.839 
he's kind of crossing lines from being a
straight<00:02:35.500> painter<00:02:36.010> into<00:02:36.460> being

00:02:37.839 --> 00:02:37.849
