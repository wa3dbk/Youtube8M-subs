00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.910 
review it was more of like some thoughts
on<00:00:18.090> the<00:00:18.210> game<00:00:18.359> filming's<00:00:18.960> but<00:00:19.350> I<00:00:19.380> never<00:00:19.619> really

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
on the game filming's but I never really

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.070 
on the game filming's but I never really
gave<00:00:20.220> up<00:00:21.830> my<00:00:22.830> review<00:00:23.189> on<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:23.460> game<00:00:24.019> but<00:00:25.019> I

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
gave up my review on the game but I

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.140 
gave up my review on the game but I
guess<00:00:25.289> it<00:00:25.619> wasn't<00:00:25.830> a<00:00:26.010> review<00:00:26.340> so<00:00:26.519> it<00:00:26.670> makes

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
guess it wasn't a review so it makes

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.169 
guess it wasn't a review so it makes
sense<00:00:27.269> but<00:00:27.720> I<00:00:28.220> wanted<00:00:29.220> to<00:00:29.369> continue<00:00:29.699> on<00:00:29.970> from

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
sense but I wanted to continue on from

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:31.910 
sense but I wanted to continue on from
my<00:00:30.330> last<00:00:30.510> video<00:00:30.869> I<00:00:31.199> really<00:00:31.500> didn't<00:00:31.740> have

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:52.819 
reach has kind of your like hit him over
the<00:01:51.450> head<00:01:51.540> hit<00:01:51.930> him<00:01:52.049> in<00:01:52.140> his<00:01:52.170> back<00:01:52.439> and<00:01:52.470> then

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
the head hit him in his back and then

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.310 
the head hit him in his back and then
like<00:01:53.040> finish<00:01:53.850> him<00:01:54.000> off<00:01:54.149> and<00:01:54.479> you<00:01:55.170> get<00:01:55.259> a

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
like finish him off and you get a

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.010 
like finish him off and you get a
humiliation<00:01:56.009> it's<00:01:56.310> called<00:01:56.549> and<00:01:56.850> that's<00:01:57.719> a<00:01:57.840> one

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
humiliation it's called and that's a one

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.240 
humiliation it's called and that's a one
hit<00:01:58.200> kill<00:01:58.229> but<00:01:58.590> you<00:01:58.680> got<00:01:58.799> to<00:01:58.829> go<00:01:58.979> through<00:01:59.009> the

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
hit kill but you got to go through the

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.039 
hit kill but you got to go through the
whole<00:01:59.369> animation<00:01:59.790> and<00:02:00.180> you<00:02:00.270> can<00:02:00.540> and<00:02:00.840> look<00:02:00.930> at

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
whole animation and you can and look at

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.080 
whole animation and you can and look at
it<00:02:01.170> that's<00:02:01.860> the<00:02:01.979> proximity<00:02:02.340> grenades<00:02:02.790> you<00:02:02.909> see

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
it that's the proximity grenades you see

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.370 
it that's the proximity grenades you see
they<00:02:03.210> kind<00:02:03.420> of<00:02:03.479> open<00:02:03.719> up<00:02:03.810> like<00:02:03.930> a<00:02:03.990> spiderweb

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
they kind of open up like a spiderweb

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.119 
they kind of open up like a spiderweb
say<00:02:05.189> they're<00:02:05.310> pretty<00:02:05.490> easy<00:02:05.700> to<00:02:05.850> see<00:02:06.030> um<00:02:07.129> but

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
say they're pretty easy to see um but

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:09.529 
say they're pretty easy to see um but
for<00:02:08.399> some<00:02:08.520> reason<00:02:08.759> they're<00:02:08.849> kind<00:02:09.000> of<00:02:09.119> hard<00:02:09.239> to

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
for some reason they're kind of hard to

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:10.880 
for some reason they're kind of hard to
shoot<00:02:09.780> them<00:02:09.959> and<00:02:10.110> taking<00:02:10.319> a<00:02:10.440> while<00:02:10.619> to<00:02:10.649> shoot

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
shoot them and taking a while to shoot

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.619 
shoot them and taking a while to shoot
it<00:02:11.009> I<00:02:11.190> guess<00:02:11.819> I<00:02:11.910> got<00:02:12.030> to<00:02:12.060> figure<00:02:12.300> out<00:02:12.420> where<00:02:12.540> the

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
it I guess I got to figure out where the

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:13.370 
it I guess I got to figure out where the
hitboxes

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
hitboxes

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.830 
hitboxes
on<00:02:13.410> the<00:02:13.590> point<00:02:14.280> of<00:02:14.370> that<00:02:14.550> of<00:02:14.760> aiming<00:02:15.240> on<00:02:15.420> the

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
on the point of that of aiming on the

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
on the point of that of aiming on the
downside<00:02:16.260> but<00:02:16.440> anyway<00:02:17.480> so<00:02:18.650> proximity<00:02:19.650> mine<00:02:19.770> is

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
downside but anyway so proximity mine is

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.250 
downside but anyway so proximity mine is
pretty<00:02:19.950> easy<00:02:20.190> to<00:02:20.340> see<00:02:20.550> but<00:02:21.420> the<00:02:21.720> mailing<00:02:22.080> in

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
pretty easy to see but the mailing in

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.230 
pretty easy to see but the mailing in
the<00:02:22.320> game<00:02:22.530> is<00:02:22.710> nice<00:02:22.920> you<00:02:23.310> know<00:02:23.460> it's<00:02:23.820> two<00:02:24.000> hits

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
the game is nice you know it's two hits

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.870 
the game is nice you know it's two hits
from<00:02:24.720> the<00:02:24.870> front<00:02:25.110> or<00:02:25.320> the<00:02:25.350> back<00:02:25.440> unless<00:02:26.370> you<00:02:26.550> do

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
from the front or the back unless you do

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.940 
from the front or the back unless you do
the<00:02:27.000> animation<00:02:27.180> and<00:02:28.020> like<00:02:28.350> I<00:02:28.440> said<00:02:28.500> you<00:02:28.710> can't

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
the animation and like I said you can't

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.560 
the animation and like I said you can't
get<00:02:29.070> killed<00:02:29.310> during<00:02:29.490> the<00:02:29.700> animation<00:02:30.000> so<00:02:30.390> it<00:02:30.480> is

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
get killed during the animation so it is

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.780 
get killed during the animation so it is
a<00:02:30.600> little<00:02:30.840> risky<00:02:31.100> if<00:02:32.100> you<00:02:32.220> got<00:02:32.400> like<00:02:32.550> a<00:02:32.580> whole

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
a little risky if you got like a whole

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.100 
a little risky if you got like a whole
bunch<00:02:33.000> of<00:02:33.090> guys<00:02:33.240> in<00:02:33.480> your<00:02:33.540> behind<00:02:33.870> him<00:02:33.990> you're

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
bunch of guys in your behind him you're

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:35.360 
bunch of guys in your behind him you're
probably<00:02:34.290> better<00:02:34.500> off<00:02:34.650> just<00:02:34.920> shooting<00:02:35.310> them

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
probably better off just shooting them

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.550 
probably better off just shooting them
all<00:02:35.550> rather<00:02:36.390> than<00:02:36.570> trying<00:02:36.840> to<00:02:36.900> melee<00:02:37.230> them<00:02:37.380> all

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
all rather than trying to melee them all

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.260 
all rather than trying to melee them all
three<00:02:37.890> of<00:02:37.920> them<00:02:38.160> and<00:02:38.340> mail<00:02:38.460> it<00:02:38.610> maybe<00:02:38.850> melee

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
three of them and mail it maybe melee

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.390 
three of them and mail it maybe melee
like<00:02:39.540> one<00:02:39.780> of<00:02:39.810> them<00:02:40.020> and<00:02:40.260> then<00:02:40.860> shoot<00:02:41.280> the

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
like one of them and then shoot the

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.910 
like one of them and then shoot the
other<00:02:41.550> two<00:02:41.870> and<00:02:42.870> you<00:02:42.960> see<00:02:43.110> I<00:02:43.140> just<00:02:43.440> I<00:02:43.620> was

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
other two and you see I just I was

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.320 
other two and you see I just I was
caught<00:02:44.100> off<00:02:44.130> guard<00:02:44.310> so<00:02:44.580> I<00:02:44.700> just<00:02:44.940> do<00:02:45.030> a<00:02:45.060> grenade

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
caught off guard so I just do a grenade

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.240 
caught off guard so I just do a grenade
behind<00:02:45.660> me<00:02:45.810> just<00:02:46.110> to<00:02:46.230> get<00:02:46.350> away<00:02:46.470> clear<00:02:47.160> the

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
behind me just to get away clear the

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.880 
behind me just to get away clear the
space<00:02:47.340> between<00:02:47.820> me<00:02:48.120> and<00:02:48.240> the<00:02:48.330> enemy<00:02:48.620> pro<00:02:49.620> tip

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
space between me and the enemy pro tip

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.510 
space between me and the enemy pro tip
right<00:02:50.130> there<00:02:50.400> but<00:02:51.530> look<00:02:52.530> at<00:02:52.650> proximity<00:02:53.310> mine

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
right there but look at proximity mine

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.960 
right there but look at proximity mine
again<00:02:54.180> clubby<00:02:54.870> dubby<00:02:55.250> doing<00:02:56.250> his<00:02:56.370> damn<00:02:56.610> minds

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
again clubby dubby doing his damn minds

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.720 
again clubby dubby doing his damn minds
all<00:02:57.330> over<00:02:57.570> the<00:02:57.660> map<00:02:58.130> they're<00:02:59.130> easy<00:02:59.340> to<00:02:59.520> avoid

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
all over the map they're easy to avoid

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.460 
all over the map they're easy to avoid
they're<00:03:00.060> easy<00:03:00.240> to<00:03:00.420> avoid<00:03:00.690> but<00:03:00.930> since<00:03:01.110> I<00:03:01.230> rushed

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
they're easy to avoid but since I rushed

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.680 
they're easy to avoid but since I rushed
so<00:03:01.620> much<00:03:01.800> I<00:03:01.920> do<00:03:01.980> run<00:03:02.370> into<00:03:02.400> them<00:03:02.730> probably<00:03:03.420> more

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
so much I do run into them probably more

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.470 
so much I do run into them probably more
than<00:03:03.780> I<00:03:03.900> should<00:03:04.070> but<00:03:05.070> that's<00:03:05.880> because<00:03:06.060> I<00:03:06.240> don't

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
than I should but that's because I don't

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.210 
than I should but that's because I don't
really<00:03:06.690> slow<00:03:06.990> down<00:03:07.200> so<00:03:07.620> it<00:03:07.710> puts<00:03:07.890> me<00:03:07.980> in<00:03:08.010> bad

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
really slow down so it puts me in bad

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.670 
really slow down so it puts me in bad
situations<00:03:08.490> every<00:03:09.030> now<00:03:09.150> and<00:03:09.300> then<00:03:09.420> but<00:03:09.600> also<00:03:10.500> I

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
situations every now and then but also I

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.080 
situations every now and then but also I
wanted<00:03:10.980> to<00:03:11.100> finish<00:03:11.280> talking<00:03:11.640> about<00:03:11.820> where<00:03:12.000> the

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
wanted to finish talking about where the

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.870 
wanted to finish talking about where the
classes<00:03:12.570> there's<00:03:13.350> six<00:03:13.650> classes<00:03:14.190> now<00:03:14.430> one<00:03:14.850> of

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
classes there's six classes now one of

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.440 
classes there's six classes now one of
them<00:03:15.030> is<00:03:15.180> up<00:03:15.600> go<00:03:15.810> get<00:03:16.500> owned<00:03:16.680> by<00:03:16.890> the<00:03:16.950> doorway

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
them is up go get owned by the doorway

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.450 
them is up go get owned by the doorway
but<00:03:18.450> there's<00:03:18.810> six<00:03:19.020> cup<00:03:19.200> the<00:03:19.470> six<00:03:19.740> classes<00:03:20.280> one

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:20.460 
but there's six cup the six classes one

but there's six cup the six classes one
of<00:03:20.550> them<00:03:20.700> is<00:03:20.760> a<00:03:20.790> sniper<00:03:21.090> class<00:03:21.530> that<00:03:22.530> uh<00:03:22.560> the

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
of them is a sniper class that uh the

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.790 
of them is a sniper class that uh the
ability<00:03:23.610> is<00:03:23.730> you<00:03:23.940> can<00:03:24.090> put<00:03:25.020> your<00:03:25.200> you<00:03:25.650> can

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:02.550 
you know in the scituate situation

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:04.870 
you know in the scituate situation
that's<00:05:03.420> where<00:05:03.570> the<00:05:03.660> word<00:05:04.110> I'm<00:05:04.260> looking<00:05:04.500> for

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:04.880 
that's where the word I'm looking for

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:09.320 
that's where the word I'm looking for
and<00:05:05.880> then<00:05:06.030> the<00:05:06.120> fifth<00:05:06.360> class<00:05:06.660> is<00:05:07.050> the<00:05:08.330> point

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:09.330 
and then the fifth class is the point

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:10.520 
and then the fifth class is the point
guard<00:05:09.570> point<00:05:09.870> man<00:05:10.050> or<00:05:10.200> something<00:05:10.380> like<00:05:10.440> that

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:10.530 
guard point man or something like that

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:12.890 
guard point man or something like that
his<00:05:11.430> special<00:05:11.820> ability<00:05:11.880> basically<00:05:12.750> is

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:12.900 
his special ability basically is

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:16.370 
his special ability basically is
stopping<00:05:13.560> power<00:05:13.680> ammo<00:05:14.190> at<00:05:14.640> the<00:05:15.120> cost<00:05:15.390> of<00:05:15.660> of

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:16.380 
stopping power ammo at the cost of of

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:18.680 
stopping power ammo at the cost of of
increased<00:05:16.830> recoil<00:05:17.300> but<00:05:18.300> you<00:05:18.390> do<00:05:18.540> have

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:18.690 
increased recoil but you do have

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:20.360 
increased recoil but you do have
stopping<00:05:19.140> power<00:05:19.290> for<00:05:19.530> one<00:05:19.680> clip<00:05:19.980> though<00:05:20.160> you

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:20.370 
stopping power for one clip though you

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:22.820 
stopping power for one clip though you
put<00:05:20.550> in<00:05:20.670> like<00:05:20.820> a<00:05:20.850> stopping<00:05:21.330> power<00:05:21.450> clip<00:05:21.930> it<00:05:22.710> has

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:22.830 
put in like a stopping power clip it has

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:24.500 
put in like a stopping power clip it has
a<00:05:22.860> skull<00:05:23.190> on<00:05:23.250> it<00:05:23.460> and<00:05:23.790> it<00:05:24.000> gives<00:05:24.090> you<00:05:24.210> increased

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:24.510 
a skull on it and it gives you increased

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:27.770 
a skull on it and it gives you increased
firepower<00:05:24.860> but<00:05:25.860> like<00:05:26.190> i<00:05:26.310> said<00:05:26.450> but<00:05:27.450> when<00:05:27.660> it

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:27.780 
firepower but like i said but when it

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:30.140 
firepower but like i said but when it
could<00:05:28.080> increase<00:05:28.320> recoil<00:05:28.890> and<00:05:29.130> in<00:05:29.730> the<00:05:29.820> sixth

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:30.150 
could increase recoil and in the sixth

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:32.030 
could increase recoil and in the sixth

I<00:05:59.220> was<00:05:59.430> able<00:05:59.520> to<00:05:59.700> avoid<00:05:59.940> it<00:06:00.120> it<00:06:00.870> takes<00:06:01.110> a<00:06:01.230> few

I was able to avoid it it takes a few
seconds<00:06:01.770> to<00:06:01.830> detonate<00:06:02.280> it's<00:06:02.460> not<00:06:02.580> right<00:06:02.790> away

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:02.820 
seconds to detonate it's not right away

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:04.640 
seconds to detonate it's not right away
and<00:06:03.180> I<00:06:03.270> should<00:06:03.840> have<00:06:03.870> got<00:06:04.110> maybe<00:06:04.290> these<00:06:04.470> two

not got closer but gap separator where

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:15.920 
not got closer but gap separator where
they're<00:06:14.580> forced<00:06:14.940> to<00:06:15.000> kind<00:06:15.240> of<00:06:15.360> not<00:06:15.510> chase<00:06:15.780> you
