00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
they've nicely marked out for us we just

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:24.500 
they've nicely marked out for us we just
want<00:02:22.290> to<00:02:22.350> be<00:02:22.410> stood<00:02:22.680> behind<00:02:22.890> them<00:02:23.250> and<00:02:23.430> if<00:02:24.390> you

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
want to be stood behind them and if you

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.330 
want to be stood behind them and if you
do<00:02:24.630> have<00:02:24.780> a<00:02:24.810> sniper<00:02:25.200> I'd<00:02:25.500> recommend<00:02:25.830> just<00:02:26.160> aim

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
do have a sniper I'd recommend just aim

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.140 
do have a sniper I'd recommend just aim
straight<00:02:26.760> down<00:02:27.090> into<00:02:27.300> this<00:02:27.780> doorway<00:02:28.110> here<00:02:28.620> and

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
straight down into this doorway here and

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.640 
straight down into this doorway here and
why<00:02:30.150> I'd<00:02:30.330> recommend<00:02:30.660> using<00:02:30.959> the<00:02:31.140> ice<00:02:31.260> breaker

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
why I'd recommend using the ice breaker

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.170 
why I'd recommend using the ice breaker
is<00:02:31.860> because<00:02:32.250> they're<00:02:32.430> all<00:02:32.610> clumped<00:02:33.090> together

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
is because they're all clumped together

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.449 
is because they're all clumped together
when<00:02:34.170> they<00:02:34.380> spawn<00:02:34.770> and<00:02:35.070> what<00:02:35.190> you're<00:02:35.280> going<00:02:35.370> to

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
when they spawn and what you're going to

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:36.970 
when they spawn and what you're going to
be<00:02:35.520> able<00:02:35.550> to<00:02:35.730> do<00:02:35.880> is<00:02:36.060> if<00:02:36.209> you<00:02:36.330> hit<00:02:36.510> it<00:02:36.690> right

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
be able to do is if you hit it right

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.460 
be able to do is if you hit it right
you're<00:02:37.980> going<00:02:38.250> to<00:02:38.310> be<00:02:38.430> able<00:02:38.700> to<00:02:39.090> hit<00:02:39.330> the<00:02:39.570> creek

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
you're going to be able to hit the creek

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.140 
you're going to be able to hit the creek
hill<00:02:42.709> sorry<00:02:43.709> quick<00:02:44.160> hit<00:02:44.340> one<00:02:44.520> of<00:02:44.670> the<00:02:44.820> low
