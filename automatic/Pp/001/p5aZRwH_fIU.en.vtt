moose Ursa cubensis I'm not sure if

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:30.800 
moose Ursa cubensis I'm not sure if
that's<00:00:26.950> how<00:00:27.100> you<00:00:27.160> actually<00:00:27.370> pronounce<00:00:27.910> it<00:00:29.190> but

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
that's how you actually pronounce it but

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:39.299 
that's how you actually pronounce it but
never<00:00:31.810> mind<00:00:36.600> these<00:00:37.600> are<00:00:37.710> fairly<00:00:38.710> large<00:00:38.950> seeds

00:00:39.299 --> 00:00:39.309 
never mind these are fairly large seeds

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:44.070 
never mind these are fairly large seeds
actually<00:00:40.710> F<00:00:41.710> adds<00:00:42.390> some<00:00:43.390> on<00:00:43.480> the<00:00:43.600> mutability

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:44.080 
actually F adds some on the mutability

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.670 
actually F adds some on the mutability
inner<00:00:44.559> before<00:00:44.890> which<00:00:45.180> have<00:00:46.180> it<00:00:46.330> need<00:00:46.930> some<00:00:47.530> new

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:47.680 
inner before which have it need some new

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.689 
inner before which have it need some new
ones<00:00:47.800> all<00:00:48.010> over<00:00:48.160> that<00:00:48.489> and<00:00:49.470> they're<00:00:50.670> quite<00:00:51.670> a

00:00:51.689 --> 00:00:51.699 
ones all over that and they're quite a

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:53.549 
ones all over that and they're quite a
bit<00:00:51.850> smaller<00:00:52.059> than<00:00:52.210> these<00:00:52.449> I'm<00:00:53.320> going<00:00:53.500> to

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:53.559 
bit smaller than these I'm going to

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:57.509 
bit smaller than these I'm going to
follow<00:00:53.890> the<00:00:54.040> instructions<00:00:54.699> on<00:00:55.059> the<00:00:56.339> back<00:00:57.339> of

00:00:57.509 --> 00:00:57.519 
follow the instructions on the back of

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:00.719 
follow the instructions on the back of
the<00:00:57.640> packets<00:00:58.360> and<00:00:59.190> so<00:01:00.190> I'm<00:01:00.309> going<00:01:00.430> to<00:01:00.489> sort

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:00.729 
the packets and so I'm going to sort

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:08.240 
the packets and so I'm going to sort
them<00:01:01.379> for<00:01:02.379> two<00:01:02.589> days<00:01:02.620> in<00:01:03.100> some<00:01:03.580> water

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.100 

now<00:01:09.250> most<00:01:10.000> banana<00:01:10.360> seeds<00:01:10.659> are<00:01:10.930> quite

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.110 
now most banana seeds are quite

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.920 
now most banana seeds are quite
difficult<00:01:11.530> to<00:01:11.830> Germany<00:01:12.820> they're<00:01:13.510> not<00:01:13.630> fresh

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:13.930 
difficult to Germany they're not fresh

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:18.570 
difficult to Germany they're not fresh
and<00:01:15.930> they<00:01:16.930> need<00:01:17.080> to<00:01:17.170> be<00:01:17.260> on<00:01:17.350> temp<00:01:17.620> at<00:01:18.250> a<00:01:18.430> low

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:18.580 
and they need to be on temp at a low

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.750 
and they need to be on temp at a low
temperature<00:01:18.610> cycle<00:01:19.510> of<00:01:19.659> somewhere<00:01:20.200> between

temperature cycle of somewhere between

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:25.200 
temperature cycle of somewhere between
30<00:01:21.760> and<00:01:22.000> 35<00:01:22.690> degrees<00:01:23.100> Celsius<00:01:24.100> for<00:01:24.430> nine<00:01:24.880> hours

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:30.959 
and 15 hours at 12 to 15 degrees Celsius
I<00:01:29.740> will

00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:30.969 
I will

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:33.330 
I will
I<00:01:31.000> put<00:01:31.689> the<00:01:31.780> Fahrenheit<00:01:32.380> conversion<00:01:33.100> in<00:01:33.219> the

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
I put the Fahrenheit conversion in the

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:34.980 
I put the Fahrenheit conversion in the
description<00:01:33.909> because<00:01:34.060> I<00:01:34.270> don't<00:01:34.719> know<00:01:34.840> what

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:34.990 
description because I don't know what

description because I don't know what
eyes<00:01:35.170> that's<00:01:35.979> off<00:01:36.130> my<00:01:36.310> head<00:01:36.460> and<00:01:38.520> they<00:01:39.520> can<00:01:39.670> be

take the capsule take months to actually

germinate<00:01:43.680> this<00:01:44.680> variety<00:01:45.430> banana<00:01:45.759> comes<00:01:46.539> from

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
germinate this variety banana comes from

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.849 
germinate this variety banana comes from
high<00:01:48.700> altitudes<00:01:49.329> in<00:01:49.780> India<00:01:52.229> so<00:01:53.229> hopefully<00:01:53.799> it

00:01:53.849 --> 00:01:53.859 
high altitudes in India so hopefully it

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:56.179 
high altitudes in India so hopefully it
should<00:01:54.039> be<00:01:54.159> was<00:01:54.640> a<00:01:54.670> bit<00:01:54.850> more<00:01:55.030> cold<00:01:55.359> tolerant

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
should be was a bit more cold tolerant

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.919 
should be was a bit more cold tolerant
that's<00:01:57.189> why<00:01:57.399> I've<00:01:57.520> chosen<00:01:57.579> this<00:01:58.090> variety<00:01:58.960> and

00:02:00.919 --> 00:02:00.929 
that's why I've chosen this variety and

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:04.859 
that's why I've chosen this variety and
now<00:02:01.929> I've<00:02:02.890> also<00:02:03.100> chosen<00:02:03.490> this<00:02:03.850> new<00:02:04.329> civility

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:04.869 
now I've also chosen this new civility

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:09.240 
now I've also chosen this new civility
nur<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:08.200> main<00:02:08.410> reason<00:02:08.710> I<00:02:08.770> chose<00:02:08.800> this<00:02:09.190> is

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
nur the main reason I chose this is

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.910 
nur the main reason I chose this is
because<00:02:09.539> it's<00:02:10.539> a<00:02:10.750> it<00:02:11.290> should<00:02:11.500> make<00:02:11.650> a<00:02:11.680> nice

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
because it's a it should make a nice

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.970 
because it's a it should make a nice
small<00:02:12.370> plant<00:02:12.870> and

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.130 

hopefully<00:02:17.980> might<00:02:18.220> be<00:02:18.340> a<00:02:18.370> skates<00:02:18.640> fruit<00:02:19.140> while

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
hopefully might be a skates fruit while

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:25.640 
hopefully might be a skates fruit while
flower<00:02:20.500> and<00:02:21.250> fruit<00:02:21.460> the<00:02:21.880> UK<00:02:22.210> hopefully<00:02:23.940> and<00:02:24.940> I

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
flower and fruit the UK hopefully and I

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:35.400 
flower and fruit the UK hopefully and I
see<00:02:26.650> the<00:02:26.980> size<00:02:27.220> difference<00:02:27.250> of<00:02:27.910> these<00:02:28.090> I<00:02:34.410> think

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
see the size difference of these I think

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.380 
see the size difference of these I think
what<00:02:35.740> I'm<00:02:35.860> going<00:02:36.010> to<00:02:36.040> do<00:02:36.190> actually<00:02:36.340> before<00:02:37.120> I

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
what I'm going to do actually before I

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.360 
what I'm going to do actually before I
put<00:02:37.750> them<00:02:37.840> in<00:02:38.020> the<00:02:38.170> water<00:02:38.320> is<00:02:38.740> just<00:02:38.950> going<00:02:39.220> to<00:02:39.310> a

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
put them in the water is just going to a

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:44.520 
put them in the water is just going to a
quick<00:02:39.580> little<00:02:39.820> rinse<00:02:40.380> cuz<00:02:43.140> just<00:02:44.140> to<00:02:44.350> make<00:02:44.500> sure

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
quick little rinse cuz just to make sure

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:45.440 
quick little rinse cuz just to make sure
they're<00:02:44.890> clean

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
they're clean

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.510 
they're clean
okay<00:02:46.470> now<00:02:47.470> I'm<00:02:47.770> going<00:02:47.920> to<00:02:47.980> leave<00:02:48.130> them<00:02:48.310> to<00:02:48.489> soak

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:48.520 
okay now I'm going to leave them to soak

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.890 
okay now I'm going to leave them to soak
for<00:02:48.760> about<00:02:49.420> two<00:02:50.350> days<00:02:50.590> and<00:02:50.890> then<00:02:51.220> I'll<00:02:51.900> put

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
for about two days and then I'll put

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.100 
for about two days and then I'll put
them<00:02:52.989> into<00:02:53.170> some<00:02:53.440> compost<00:02:54.180> okay<00:02:55.180> so<00:02:55.239> today<00:02:55.930> the

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
them into some compost okay so today the

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.270 
them into some compost okay so today the
date<00:02:56.290> is<00:02:56.470> the<00:02:56.770> 20th<00:02:57.310> of<00:02:57.400> April<00:02:57.790> and<00:02:57.970> I<00:02:59.100> have<00:03:00.100> had

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.390 
these in here for a few weeks now and
these<00:03:04.000> musica<00:03:04.720> menses<00:03:05.260> I<00:03:05.560> probably<00:03:06.100> pronounce

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
these musica menses I probably pronounce

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:11.490 
these musica menses I probably pronounce
that<00:03:06.550> completely<00:03:06.910> wrong<00:03:08.370> anyway<00:03:10.020> but<00:03:11.020> because

I kind of forgot about them I was going

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.470 
I kind of forgot about them I was going
to<00:03:15.010> put<00:03:15.190> them<00:03:15.280> into<00:03:15.400> some<00:03:15.640> soil<00:03:15.910> but<00:03:16.330> I'll

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
to put them into some soil but I'll

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.720 
to put them into some soil but I'll
probably<00:03:16.660> about<00:03:17.050> tomorrow<00:03:17.440> or<00:03:17.830> the<00:03:17.980> other

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
probably about tomorrow or the other

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:23.490 
probably about tomorrow or the other
Musa<00:03:19.269> Valentina<00:03:19.720> seeds<00:03:21.180> but<00:03:22.180> yesterday<00:03:22.840> I<00:03:23.080> did

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
Musa Valentina seeds but yesterday I did

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.770 
Musa Valentina seeds but yesterday I did
actually<00:03:23.650> find<00:03:24.180> one<00:03:25.180> of<00:03:25.299> the<00:03:25.390> seeds<00:03:25.630> has

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
actually find one of the seeds has

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:29.580 
actually find one of the seeds has
already<00:03:26.170> started<00:03:26.410> to<00:03:26.709> germinate<00:03:27.130> and<00:03:28.560> so<00:03:29.560> I

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
already started to germinate and so I

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.360 
already started to germinate and so I
was<00:03:29.769> very<00:03:29.890> excited<00:03:30.100> because<00:03:30.580> this<00:03:31.540> the<00:03:31.810> first

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
was very excited because this the first

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.160 
was very excited because this the first
banana<00:03:33.370> seat<00:03:33.610> I've<00:03:33.760> ever<00:03:34.000> actually<00:03:34.269> managed

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 
banana seat I've ever actually managed

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.610 
banana seat I've ever actually managed
to<00:03:35.200> get<00:03:36.040> some<00:03:36.190> German<00:03:36.519> ate<00:03:36.640> so<00:03:37.630> I'm<00:03:38.019> just<00:03:38.470> going

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 
to get some German ate so I'm just going

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.500 
to get some German ate so I'm just going
to<00:03:38.650> put<00:03:38.830> it<00:03:38.980> into<00:03:39.190> this<00:03:39.280> pot<00:03:39.610> and<00:03:39.790> but<00:03:40.209> you<00:03:40.299> can

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
to put it into this pot and but you can

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:45.390 
to put it into this pot and but you can
see<00:03:40.690> in<00:03:40.750> the<00:03:40.810> background<00:03:40.959> and<00:03:44.100> then<00:03:45.100> we'll<00:03:45.130> see

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
see in the background and then we'll see

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.090 
see in the background and then we'll see
how<00:03:45.430> it<00:03:45.700> goes<00:03:46.140> okay<00:03:47.140> so<00:03:47.380> what<00:03:47.650> I'm<00:03:47.739> going<00:03:47.890> to<00:03:47.920> do

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:48.100 
how it goes okay so what I'm going to do

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:51.479 
how it goes okay so what I'm going to do
is<00:03:48.430> with<00:03:49.329> a<00:03:49.360> pencil<00:03:49.690> I'm<00:03:50.260> going<00:03:50.290> to<00:03:50.530> just<00:03:51.340> make

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:51.489 
is with a pencil I'm going to just make

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:54.240 
is with a pencil I'm going to just make
it<00:03:51.640> a<00:03:51.910> small<00:03:52.720> hole<00:03:52.959> probably<00:03:53.350> about<00:03:53.500> two

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250 
it a small hole probably about two

00:03:54.250 --> 00:04:02.720 
it a small hole probably about two
centimeters<00:03:54.970> in<00:03:55.000> depth<00:03:55.540> or<00:03:55.930> maybe<00:03:56.620> an<00:03:56.769> inch

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.280 

now<00:04:03.730> when<00:04:04.000> you're<00:04:04.120> putting<00:04:04.209> the<00:04:04.480> seed<00:04:04.690> in<00:04:04.900> you

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
now when you're putting the seed in you

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:08.360 
now when you're putting the seed in you
don't<00:04:05.470> want<00:04:05.590> to<00:04:05.769> put<00:04:05.980> it<00:04:06.160> in<00:04:06.280> like<00:04:06.820> this

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
don't want to put it in like this

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:11.880 
don't want to put it in like this
because<00:04:09.370> that<00:04:10.269> isn't<00:04:10.480> just<00:04:10.840> the<00:04:11.500> root<00:04:11.650> that<00:04:11.680> is

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:11.890 
because that isn't just the root that is

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:14.880 
because that isn't just the root that is
also<00:04:12.130> the<00:04:12.400> chute<00:04:12.670> so<00:04:13.200> you<00:04:14.200> need<00:04:14.350> to<00:04:14.440> plant<00:04:14.680> it

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:14.890 
also the chute so you need to plant it

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:17.789 
also the chute so you need to plant it
this<00:04:15.040> way<00:04:15.250> up<00:04:15.430> so<00:04:16.209> when<00:04:16.900> it<00:04:16.989> and<00:04:17.169> the<00:04:17.530> stem

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799 
this way up so when it and the stem

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:20.280 
this way up so when it and the stem
grows<00:04:17.829> up<00:04:18.280> and<00:04:18.579> then<00:04:19.570> the<00:04:19.720> root<00:04:19.900> will<00:04:20.079> grow

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:20.290 
grows up and then the root will grow

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:24.150 
grows up and then the root will grow
from<00:04:20.530> the<00:04:20.709> side<00:04:20.950> and<00:04:21.340> down<00:04:22.440> so<00:04:23.440> I'll<00:04:23.710> just<00:04:23.860> pop

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160 
from the side and down so I'll just pop

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:29.029 
from the side and down so I'll just pop
this<00:04:24.310> in<00:04:24.520> gently

00:04:29.029 --> 00:04:29.039 

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:35.399 

so<00:04:30.039> it's<00:04:30.220> just<00:04:30.520> underneath<00:04:32.190> and<00:04:33.190> then<00:04:34.409> just

00:04:35.399 --> 00:04:35.409 
so it's just underneath and then just

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:44.640 
so it's just underneath and then just
cover<00:04:35.620> over<00:04:37.139> very<00:04:38.139> gently<00:04:38.500> tap<00:04:39.250> it<00:04:39.370> around<00:04:43.650> and

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:44.650 
cover over very gently tap it around and

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:48.529 
cover over very gently tap it around and
now<00:04:45.340> I'll<00:04:46.060> just<00:04:46.240> give<00:04:46.419> this<00:04:46.539> a<00:04:46.599> quick<00:04:46.870> watering

00:04:48.529 --> 00:04:48.539 
now I'll just give this a quick watering

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:52.200 
now I'll just give this a quick watering
so<00:04:49.539> as<00:04:49.960> this<00:04:50.470> is<00:04:50.530> quite<00:04:51.039> dry<00:04:51.400> this<00:04:51.729> oil<00:04:52.030> I'm

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:52.210 
so as this is quite dry this oil I'm

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:55.110 
so as this is quite dry this oil I'm
going<00:04:52.240> to<00:04:52.449> give<00:04:53.409> it<00:04:53.530> quite<00:04:53.710> a<00:04:53.770> good<00:04:54.669> watering

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:55.120 
going to give it quite a good watering

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.320 
going to give it quite a good watering
to<00:04:55.690> make<00:04:55.840> sure<00:04:55.960> it's<00:04:56.139> nice<00:04:56.319> and<00:04:56.349> moist<00:04:57.330> that

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:58.330 
to make sure it's nice and moist that

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:03.170 
to make sure it's nice and moist that
should<00:04:58.539> be<00:04:58.659> fine<00:04:58.840> for<00:04:58.900> now<00:04:59.080> so<00:04:59.979> I<00:05:01.319> might<00:05:02.319> put

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:03.180 
should be fine for now so I might put

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.490 
should be fine for now so I might put
something<00:05:04.180> over<00:05:04.330> the<00:05:04.539> top<00:05:04.810> to<00:05:05.020> keeping<00:05:05.409> the

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:05.500 
something over the top to keeping the

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:08.490 
something over the top to keeping the
moisture<00:05:05.979> and<00:05:06.190> act<00:05:07.120> as<00:05:07.300> mini<00:05:07.599> greenhouse<00:05:08.080> but

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:08.500 
moisture and act as mini greenhouse but

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:11.520 
moisture and act as mini greenhouse but
I<00:05:08.770> haven't<00:05:09.129> fully<00:05:09.219> decided<00:05:09.490> yet<00:05:10.030> or<00:05:10.719> I<00:05:11.289> might

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:11.530 
I haven't fully decided yet or I might

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:13.110 
I haven't fully decided yet or I might
just<00:05:11.710> leave<00:05:11.860> it<00:05:12.009> like<00:05:12.039> this<00:05:12.159> for<00:05:12.400> now<00:05:12.610> to<00:05:12.759> see

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:13.120 
just leave it like this for now to see

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:17.909 
just leave it like this for now to see
if<00:05:13.690> it<00:05:13.960> actually<00:05:14.250> comes<00:05:15.250> up<00:05:15.659> if<00:05:16.659> it<00:05:17.379> doesn't<00:05:17.740> I

00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:17.919 
if it actually comes up if it doesn't I

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:20.510

will<00:05:17.979> make<00:05:18.490> a<00:05:18.520> mini<00:05:19.240> greenhouse<00:05:19.659> on<00:05:19.930> the<00:05:20.139> top

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:20.520 
will make a mini greenhouse on the top

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:23.520 
will make a mini greenhouse on the top
