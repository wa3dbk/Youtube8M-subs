00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:10.430
 let's make up green eyes queta mónica 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:19.199
 doubts always arise that the government that we have 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.449
 the tricolor is what we do best 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.400
 today we are going to see with the green color the monarch 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:29.619
 and because nothing to do to highlight its green color you pass goal totally opposite 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:31.229
 the proposed pavilion 

00:00:31.229 --> 00:00:32.360
 We are going to use 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.890
 a shade of color 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.220
 it is the most opposite color 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.710
 special 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.130
 first we're going to try 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:43.719
 it's a purple line 

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:45.500
 close your eyes said 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.500
 along all the tabs 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.410
 this purple color what we are going to do is to highlight its color completely 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:58.190
 since it is an opposite color 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.460
 if we wanted his green color steps more unnoticed 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:04.460
 uses colors much more similar to death 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:08.790
 even though he finished drawing 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.020
 but eyes very little we will blur the length of the eyelid mobile 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:17.460
 with the sense that when asked for a shadow 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.850
 little more intensity and that in the national commission part 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.480
 let's blur the bottom part 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.250
 the line that bolt 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.500
 let's say entirely the tabs 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.630
 apply the lower area of ​​the eyebrow 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.790
 a bright color 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.790
 it can be bright it can be matte 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:49.730
 let's go to efe monica 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:50.790
 in two parts 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.290
 the mobile Saturday of the half to the outside and from the unit 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.700
 on the outside 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.700
 they forced us dark color 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:02.539
 the part 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:03.840
 from the middle of the eye 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.079
 so the animal we are going to apply 

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:09.049
 a very bright color that can be perfectly 

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:11.019
 the same color that we have applied 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:14.019
 in the bottom of the cea 

00:02:15.609 --> 00:02:16.719
 this division 

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:18.429
 we have to try 

00:02:18.429 --> 00:02:20.319
 and blur the ue 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:23.319
 it is also intended that all could arise 

00:02:30.169 --> 00:02:31.679
 but it is protected 

00:02:31.679 --> 00:02:35.119
 the marker was clear that we put the population 

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:37.139
 and that is that the players are motivated 

00:02:37.139 --> 00:02:38.609
 we are going to discuss it 

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:41.609
 in ascending direction always 

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:49.909
 purple as an excuse the upper part of the eye 

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:53.269
 Finally, the ones used in the lower part 

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:55.450
 seeing as 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.450
 hence we have named 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:06.120
 let's put a part inside the eye 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.360
 a line like we put out before and above 

00:03:18.089 --> 00:03:20.159
 the first one is intention makeup 

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:22.019
 let's go to Spain's problems is black 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:25.479
 look at the floor please 

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:28.429
 we're going to win even more intensity 

00:03:28.429 --> 00:03:31.919
 at the opposite pole then let's see what intensity for a series of strange 

00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:33.579
 To the extreme 

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:37.069
 By Monica these are the ones that will not be empirical evidence that everything 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:38.119
 be more green 

00:03:38.119 --> 00:03:41.969
 that day that has some unnoticed form actors more related to their 

00:03:41.969 --> 00:03:43.099
 tone 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:44.869
 do not think yellow 

00:03:44.869 --> 00:03:45.789
 the month of March
