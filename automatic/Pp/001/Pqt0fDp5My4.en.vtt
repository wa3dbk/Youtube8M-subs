00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.319 
find out how I gets to attack that was
twice<00:00:36.980> sonic<00:00:37.980> slash<00:00:38.309> that's<00:00:38.790> always<00:00:38.940> a<00:00:39.059> really

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
twice sonic slash that's always a really

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.720 
twice sonic slash that's always a really
slow<00:00:39.660> animation<00:00:40.280> let's<00:00:41.280> boost<00:00:41.520> our

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
slow animation let's boost our

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.209 
slow animation let's boost our
resistance<00:00:42.300> does<00:00:42.510> that<00:00:42.629> not<00:00:42.870> hurt<00:00:42.980> and<00:00:43.980> let's

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
resistance does that not hurt and let's

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.340 
resistance does that not hurt and let's
use<00:00:44.370> brannad<00:00:44.940> and<00:00:45.329> let's<00:00:45.510> boost<00:00:45.719> our<00:00:45.930> defense

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
use brannad and let's boost our defense

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.940 
use brannad and let's boost our defense
and<00:00:46.920> then<00:00:47.520> let's<00:00:47.789> use<00:00:47.910> wish<00:00:48.420> because<00:00:49.379> I<00:00:49.680> really

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
and then let's use wish because I really

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.360 
and then let's use wish because I really
don't<00:00:50.070> want<00:00:50.250> to<00:00:50.309> die<00:00:50.430> here<00:00:51.739> so<00:00:52.739> yeah<00:00:53.190> we're

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
don't want to die here so yeah we're

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.580 
don't want to die here so yeah we're
actually<00:00:53.489> basically<00:00:54.390> done<00:00:54.960> with<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.230> desert

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
actually basically done with the desert

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.680 
actually basically done with the desert
after<00:00:55.739> after<00:00:56.190> this<00:00:56.309> die<00:00:56.520> so<00:00:57.030> I<00:00:57.059> think<00:00:57.300> we<00:00:57.570> might

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
after after this die so I think we might

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.360 
after after this die so I think we might
be<00:00:57.750> able<00:00:57.870> to<00:00:58.050> fit<00:00:58.199> it<00:00:58.289> all<00:00:58.379> into<00:00:58.559> one<00:00:58.620> episode<00:00:58.829> I

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
be able to fit it all into one episode I

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.740 
be able to fit it all into one episode I
don't<00:00:59.670> know<00:00:59.760> how<00:00:59.879> long<00:01:00.059> this<00:01:00.270> episode's<00:01:00.690> gonna

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
don't know how long this episode's gonna

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.319 
don't know how long this episode's gonna
be<00:01:01.050> I'm<00:01:01.260> hoping<00:01:01.739> less<00:01:02.160> than<00:01:02.430> like<00:01:02.670> 15<00:01:03.120> minutes

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
be I'm hoping less than like 15 minutes

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.480 
be I'm hoping less than like 15 minutes
but<00:01:03.890> god<00:01:04.890> only<00:01:05.070> knows<00:01:06.560> yeah<00:01:07.560> I<00:01:07.590> was<00:01:07.950> bad<00:01:08.220> and

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
but god only knows yeah I was bad and

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.950 
but god only knows yeah I was bad and
Crona<00:01:09.360> will<00:01:09.659> boost<00:01:09.840> our<00:01:09.960> defense<00:01:10.939> so<00:01:11.960> we

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
Crona will boost our defense so we

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.980 
Crona will boost our defense so we
should<00:01:13.170> be<00:01:13.200> fine<00:01:13.350> now<00:01:13.619> I<00:01:13.860> mean<00:01:14.100> he's<00:01:14.990> pretty

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
should be fine now I mean he's pretty

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.070 
should be fine now I mean he's pretty
easy<00:01:16.350> like<00:01:17.159> All<00:01:17.490> Things<00:01:17.759> Considered<00:01:17.909> I<00:01:18.720> mean

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
easy like All Things Considered I mean

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.690 
easy like All Things Considered I mean
we've<00:01:19.259> fought<00:01:19.560> much<00:01:19.890> harder<00:01:20.280> in<00:01:20.369> her<00:01:20.460> time

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
we've fought much harder in her time

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.109 
we've fought much harder in her time
boost<00:01:21.570> our<00:01:21.720> agility<00:01:22.490> lower<00:01:23.490> his<00:01:23.820> agility

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
boost our agility lower his agility

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.609 
boost our agility lower his agility
hopefully<00:01:24.689> we<00:01:24.780> get<00:01:24.869> all<00:01:25.020> our<00:01:25.049> attacks<00:01:25.409> in

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
hopefully we get all our attacks in

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.120 
hopefully we get all our attacks in
first<00:01:25.890> this<00:01:26.100> way<00:01:26.310> and<00:01:27.740> sure<00:01:28.740> why<00:01:28.950> not<00:01:29.070> let's

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
first this way and sure why not let's

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.649 
first this way and sure why not let's
use<00:01:29.430> fever<00:01:29.729> and<00:01:31.850> wish<00:01:32.850> I<00:01:33.119> don't<00:01:33.180> really<00:01:33.450> want

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
use fever and wish I don't really want

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:34.940 
use fever and wish I don't really want
to<00:01:33.689> take<00:01:33.810> any<00:01:33.990> risk<00:01:34.290> so<00:01:34.560> I<00:01:34.619> think<00:01:34.710> I'll<00:01:34.920> just

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
to take any risk so I think I'll just

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.530 
to take any risk so I think I'll just
wish<00:01:35.310> with<00:01:35.549> me<00:01:35.700> unless<00:01:36.030> we're<00:01:36.180> at<00:01:36.210> full<00:01:36.360> health

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
wish with me unless we're at full health

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.840 
wish with me unless we're at full health
because<00:01:37.470> after<00:01:37.770> we<00:01:37.860> do<00:01:37.950> this<00:01:38.070> agility<00:01:38.400> thing

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
because after we do this agility thing

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.240 
because after we do this agility thing
me<00:01:39.570> is<00:01:39.720> going<00:01:39.990> to<00:01:40.140> get<00:01:40.290> to<00:01:40.380> cast<00:01:40.619> wish<00:01:40.860> before

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
me is going to get to cast wish before

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.490 
me is going to get to cast wish before
he<00:01:41.369> does<00:01:41.520> any<00:01:41.700> attacks<00:01:42.060> so<00:01:42.780> a<00:01:42.810> fruitful<00:01:43.290> health

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
he does any attacks so a fruitful health

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.969 
he does any attacks so a fruitful health
already<00:01:43.829> casting<00:01:44.700> wish<00:01:44.880> would<00:01:45.030> be<00:01:45.240> useless

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979 
already casting wish would be useless

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:50.120 
already casting wish would be useless
that<00:01:46.979> turn<00:01:47.869> does<00:01:48.869> that<00:01:48.990> fold<00:01:49.409> heal<00:01:49.680> yes<00:01:49.979> it

it<00:02:05.470> has<00:02:05.710> to<00:02:05.860> do<00:02:06.010> with<00:02:06.190> the<00:02:06.310> fact<00:02:06.550> that<00:02:07.259> a<00:02:08.520> normal

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 
it has to do with the fact that a normal

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.780 
it has to do with the fact that a normal
life<00:02:09.789> integer<00:02:10.270> variable<00:02:10.840> that<00:02:11.830> you<00:02:11.950> use<00:02:12.190> just

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
like a normal length one generally goes

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.750 
like a normal length one generally goes
from<00:02:15.850> negative<00:02:16.060> 255<00:02:16.959> to<00:02:17.230> positive<00:02:17.740> to<00:02:17.890> 55<00:02:18.430> we

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
from negative 255 to positive to 55 we

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
tried to store 256 in it it wouldn't it

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.620 
tried to store 256 in it it wouldn't it
would<00:02:21.970> have<00:02:22.090> been<00:02:22.300> um<00:02:23.110> you'd<00:02:23.800> have<00:02:23.950> to<00:02:24.100> use<00:02:24.280> a
