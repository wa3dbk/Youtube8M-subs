00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:12.120
 hello dear friends today we are with 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.709
 you talk about the next on the same 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.990
 which was provided for review 

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:18.810
 Novosibirsk shopping knives blade will 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:22.500
 this is a knife produced by a viper company 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:25.650
 Italian called he is a viper to us 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.599
 Here is such a factory index 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.820
 whether sylvestri is such a certain 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.679
 the designer made this knife for for this 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.290
 Italian company still interest 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.530
 next I want to show right away 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:39.420
 the name here is applied directly to the blade 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:41.460
 the knife is made in the Italian city to me 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.550
 yeah i understand this is something like 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:47.160
 our Chrysostom or Japanese Sookie in 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.260
 which most Italian are made of 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.140
 knives this city of italian our builds 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.860
 well let's actually look at it 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.900
 wonderful device 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:59.390
 the handle of this instance is made of 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.440
 wood 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.510
 so here it is so cool 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.579
 3d enough big really 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:09.119
 hard there are options as I understand 

00:01:05.579 --> 00:01:10.799
 with a carbon media card and help g10 if 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.510
 I’m not mistaken that there is something like that 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.159
 there are options there are different weight therefore 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.020
 these knives may be enough too 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.370
 different but nevertheless what like 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.030
 as far as I at least understood 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:24.390
 it starts from 240 grams but with a big 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.670
 heavy here is such a clip for this 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.260
 knife she does not rearrange judging by 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.080
 how it is mounted on this one 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.970
 wife clip so say that technically 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.740
 she is quite comfortable another question 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.810
 convenient for such a knife which dimensions for 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.549
 and yesterday for carrying in a pocket on a clip 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.500
 but still not all is enough 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.930
 it is clear that he sits on his pocket enough 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.479
 easy to wear very deep and good 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.370
 another question holds that despite 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.409
 such an appearance is a knife so large 

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:50.940
 that for whatever your flexion and hebe 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.830
 he will still be eager to get out 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.330
 you a little storm about it looks like it 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.130
 really will be on your pocket about something like 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.250
 so here you have all the time 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.290
 straighten on besides nozhkin tyrol and 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.670
 big here is thick here let's say yes 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.080
 wear it on your jeans pocket 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.270
 would really not be very comfortable but 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.399
 The author, as far as I understand, assumes that 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.200
 he was worn on equipment pocket there like 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:14.040
 or some kind of military uniform 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:16.140
 really fabrics how much stronger 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.720
 the thicker of all this somehow 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.210
 wear more comfortable 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.860
 She also used some variation of the castle 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:23.270
 backlog that is on the manufacturer’s website 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.520
 not explicitly stated 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:26.900
 backlog but judging by the way it works here 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.820
 he did something like this by the way 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:33.350
 pretty healthy and healthy in what 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:35.060
 plan that firstly it provides 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:38.120
 quite comfortable opening this 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.920
 knife for peg that is of course it is not 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.660
 speed and opening which can 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.270
 would say something like this 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.860
 on some blocks for example companies 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:48.380
 will fall to the present here 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:50.510
 certainly not in this way for the spire of Crimea 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.980
 fast movement failed to open but 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.510
 it is personally possible for me 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.370
 someone bigger bigger arms 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.750
 certainly, but to the usual 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.220
 the user will of course be somewhat 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:01.280
 uncomfortable for the peg the knife is revealed 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:03.290
 ok besides is interesting here then 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.660
 what's the drive grabbing a knife like that 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.250
 way you can pretty easily him 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.410
 close ie lock works 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:11.150
 softly enough but I'll show it now on 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:13.580
 table because when shooting the previous 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:15.140
 version of the review I just cut myself 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:18.170
 it's like a flaw in this knife 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.340
 usually at least soft shreds manufacturer 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:21.350
 trying to make some man 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.480
 who would allow here so taking a knife 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:25.820
 well how to press up somehow and 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.959
 catch why blade here blade 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:29.410
 rather heavy, that is, as you can see 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:32.209
 he falls right now I'll show 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:33.680
 easy enough here's a knife 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:35.330
 really calmly close one 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.370
 hand in some way 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:38.780
 but it is a bit traumatic 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:40.820
 because in principle with this 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:43.640
 coverage if here and so take just 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:45.080
 knife fold it is possible to drop the knife 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.730
 cutting edge on your index finger 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:48.380
 finger that is, I've already done here 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.390
 can demonstrate 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:52.580
 quite completely real it is 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:55.580
 happening well actually here 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:59.180
 such a blade you see at the knife stalin 690 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:00.709
 about his form well, she is drawing enough 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:02.590
 so let's say despite the fact that i am so 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:05.000
 I understand that the thickness of the blade order 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:05.959
 four millimeters descents from the butt like 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.810
 You can see such a small 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:12.730
 climbed in general so big good 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:16.640
 blade its length is almost 11 centimeters 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:18.140
 that's probably so here we are on it 

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:19.940
 look studs still wanted to show 

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:21.080
 here they are quite pleasant here 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.419
 another one of the technical feature 

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:25.910
 this knife cancer is quite interesting i 

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:27.710
 I wanted to show you what is here in 5 blades 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:29.780
 made such a special propyl which 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:30.580
 allows lenk very density there is on 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:32.630
 this 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:35.180
 bearing pin that is, it is right there 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:39.260
 jumps off as you can see when folding 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:41.030
 from the plate backlog a and blade 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.320
 it turns out such a single 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:43.730
 space which at least 

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:45.830
 finger you can not grope 

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:47.480
 there is a transition here yes I would say 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:49.550
 which can only be seen with the near 

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:51.400
 considering so we will speak already on 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:54.950
 some distance to understand that this knife 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:56.600
 with a fixed blade can only 

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:58.340
 a man who understands how this one is 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:00.080
 the lock works here so everything is tight 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:02.270
 well done as well as possible on many 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:04.010
 Italian knives mechanically 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:06.140
 quality performance here is pretty 

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:07.810
 high here's another such moment 

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:09.950
 way realized bum hole 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:12.440
 so however on the fountain that is 

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:13.760
 again, it is clear that in Italy it’s somehow 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:17.030
 apparently taken here is such a design 

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:20.090
 this is not something that is used 

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:22.070
 lined up and liners at the knife here on 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:24.200
 liners however seemed to me pretty 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:25.910
 thin at yours so they see not 

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:27.130
 say that is very fat but such 

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:29.660
 steel liners 

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:30.920
 no lightweight nose here at all 

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:31.430
 it is obvious that the knife facilitate no one 

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:33.020
 had tried 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:34.669
 my own impression will be 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:38.110
 looks like I am not at all 

00:05:34.669 --> 00:05:40.370
 special fans of heavy folding knives 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:42.440
 due to the fact that I do not fully understand 

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:45.560
 functional purpose where you 

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:49.970
 you may need a knife but let's say 

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:52.370
 of a similar degree of strength or something 

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:54.590
 This is such a weight, yes, where necessary 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:56.300
 there will be a possibility for the button 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:59.300
 do some such things as well 

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:01.310
 Generally I did not cause no difficulty 

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:03.140
 a knife with a fixed blade 

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:05.390
 which in any case will be more 

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:07.100
 a good choice especially since this nose 

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:08.480
 also heavier than most knives with 

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:10.130
 fixed blade with similar 

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:12.710
 performance from to the end 

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:14.390
 understandable for comparison just decided that 

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:16.550
 Here in the frame will be successful to show 

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:19.520
 so our forum is the same length 

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:21.590
 Blade crows fly and 125 or 127 grams and 

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:23.720
 what kind of weight is the knife here this one 

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:25.490
 specific weighs more than 250 that is but 

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:27.890
 how could he be exactly two more in weight 

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:30.630
 times with him that's exactly the workers 

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:32.430
 properties like a cutting tool I would 

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:34.680
 I thought that probably the raven in this sense 

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:36.420
 works better well that's actually 

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:38.130
 my opinion however i know what 

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:41.250
 there are a certain number of people 

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:43.500
 who love big folding knives 

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:45.000
 I will not explain why this is so 

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:46.740
 because from a utilitarian point of view 

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.840
 it is possible and not very correct but 

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:51.720
 there are some people who just love 

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:54.810
 and here's a spider 

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:56.520
 rabbits sorry wipers on is 

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:58.020
 apparently one of these knives for which 

00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:59.970
 worth paying attention to exactly 

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:01.680
 lovers of such healthy really 

00:06:59.970 --> 00:07:03.600
 very heavy folding knives because 

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:05.670
 people like that are not there he likes 

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:09.060
 they are such brutal things themselves 

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:09.930
 here this knife in this plan is one 

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:12.060
 of such things 

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:15.380
 I hope that you were interested in a lot 

00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:15.380
 thanks for watching bye
