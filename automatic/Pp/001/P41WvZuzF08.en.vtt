washers<00:05:12.340> that<00:05:13.340> I<00:05:13.819> just<00:05:14.060> happen<00:05:14.960> to<00:05:15.020> have<00:05:15.099> so<00:05:17.050> go

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:18.050 
washers that I just happen to have so go

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:18.670 
washers that I just happen to have so go
ahead

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:18.680 
ahead

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:23.290 
ahead
stick<00:05:19.490> some<00:05:19.639> washers<00:05:20.030> on<00:05:20.180> there<00:05:22.060> on<00:05:23.060> this<00:05:23.240> side

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:23.300 
stick some washers on there on this side

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:27.790 
stick some washers on there on this side
as<00:05:23.690> well<00:05:23.949> you'll<00:05:24.949> need<00:05:25.099> six<00:05:25.460> total<00:05:26.680> and<00:05:27.680> we're

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:27.800 
as well you'll need six total and we're

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:28.899 
as well you'll need six total and we're
going<00:05:27.919> to<00:05:27.949> go<00:05:28.039> ahead<00:05:28.159> and<00:05:28.340> put<00:05:28.460> some<00:05:28.490> more<00:05:28.639> lock

00:05:28.899 --> 00:05:28.909 
going to go ahead and put some more lock

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:32.680 
going to go ahead and put some more lock
tight<00:05:30.009> and<00:05:31.009> again<00:05:31.880> the<00:05:32.000> reason<00:05:32.120> why<00:05:32.389> the<00:05:32.449> lock

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:32.690 
tight and again the reason why the lock

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:34.360 
tight and again the reason why the lock
tight<00:05:32.900> is<00:05:33.050> important<00:05:33.560> it's<00:05:33.830> because<00:05:34.159> these

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:34.370 
tight is important it's because these

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:36.520 
tight is important it's because these
are<00:05:34.550> not<00:05:34.669> going<00:05:34.729> to<00:05:35.030> be<00:05:35.120> tightened<00:05:36.110> down<00:05:36.199> all

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:36.530 
are not going to be tightened down all

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:38.680 
are not going to be tightened down all
the<00:05:36.680> way<00:05:36.849> otherwise<00:05:37.849> it<00:05:38.060> won't<00:05:38.180> move<00:05:38.389> because

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:38.690 
the way otherwise it won't move because

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:39.939 
the way otherwise it won't move because
there's<00:05:38.840> no<00:05:38.960> bearing<00:05:39.409> or<00:05:39.560> anything<00:05:39.680> like<00:05:39.889> that

00:05:39.939 --> 00:05:39.949 
there's no bearing or anything like that

00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:42.820 
there's no bearing or anything like that
for<00:05:40.400> it's<00:05:40.729> a<00:05:40.849> four<00:05:41.509> to<00:05:41.630> rotate<00:05:42.020> on<00:05:42.169> so<00:05:42.770> I'm

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:42.830 
for it's a four to rotate on so I'm

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:43.899 
for it's a four to rotate on so I'm
gonna<00:05:42.949> go<00:05:43.039> ahead<00:05:43.250> and<00:05:43.340> put<00:05:43.460> this<00:05:43.550> all<00:05:43.729> back

00:05:43.899 --> 00:05:43.909 
gonna go ahead and put this all back

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:45.969 
gonna go ahead and put this all back
together<00:05:44.150> I<00:05:44.630> just<00:05:45.139> wanted<00:05:45.349> to<00:05:45.440> throw<00:05:45.590> that<00:05:45.800> in

00:05:45.969 --> 00:05:45.979 
together I just wanted to throw that in

00:05:45.979 --> 00:05:47.890 
together I just wanted to throw that in
here<00:05:46.009> might<00:05:46.639> want<00:05:46.789> to<00:05:46.849> get<00:05:46.940> some<00:05:47.120> washers<00:05:47.570> put

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:47.900 
here might want to get some washers put

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:49.540 
here might want to get some washers put
it<00:05:47.990> on<00:05:48.110> there<00:05:48.320> and<00:05:48.500> might<00:05:48.979> make<00:05:49.159> it<00:05:49.310> roll<00:05:49.520> a

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:49.550 
it on there and might make it roll a

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:52.930 
it on there and might make it roll a
little<00:05:49.729> smoother<00:05:50.210> so<00:05:51.130> or<00:05:52.130> if<00:05:52.250> you<00:05:52.430> you<00:05:52.819> know

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:52.940 
little smoother so or if you you know

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:54.520 
little smoother so or if you you know
really<00:05:53.180> want<00:05:53.360> to<00:05:53.419> take<00:05:53.599> time<00:05:53.900> to<00:05:54.110> find<00:05:54.319> some

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:54.530 
really want to take time to find some

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:56.189 
really want to take time to find some
thin<00:05:54.740> berries<00:05:55.159> that<00:05:55.430> will<00:05:55.729> be<00:05:55.819> the<00:05:55.909> best

00:05:56.189 --> 00:05:56.199 
thin berries that will be the best

00:05:56.199 --> 00:05:59.499 
thin berries that will be the best
solution<00:05:57.199> but<00:05:57.819> I'm<00:05:58.819> not<00:05:58.940> really<00:05:59.120> that<00:05:59.300> worried

00:05:59.499 --> 00:05:59.509 
solution but I'm not really that worried

00:05:59.509 --> 00:06:01.450 
solution but I'm not really that worried
about<00:05:59.690> it<00:05:59.840> it's<00:05:59.990> a<00:06:00.050> motorcycle<00:06:00.560> scheme<00:06:00.770> but<00:06:01.430> I

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:01.460 
about it it's a motorcycle scheme but I

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:03.159 
about it it's a motorcycle scheme but I
do<00:06:01.580> want<00:06:01.880> it<00:06:01.940> to<00:06:01.969> be<00:06:02.120> pretty<00:06:02.539> smooth<00:06:02.840> and<00:06:03.020> this

00:06:03.159 --> 00:06:03.169 
do want it to be pretty smooth and this

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:05.980 
do want it to be pretty smooth and this
takes<00:06:03.830> place<00:06:03.979> five<00:06:04.460> seconds<00:06:04.969> so<00:06:05.120> stay<00:06:05.780> tuned

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:05.990 
takes place five seconds so stay tuned

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:07.870 
takes place five seconds so stay tuned
we're<00:06:06.830> going<00:06:06.949> to<00:06:07.009> put<00:06:07.430> this<00:06:07.490> back<00:06:07.699> together

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:07.880 
we're going to put this back together

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:10.300 
we're going to put this back together
and<00:06:08.210> move<00:06:08.360> on<00:06:08.479> to<00:06:08.599> the<00:06:08.690> next<00:06:08.780> steps<00:06:09.159> okay<00:06:10.159> we've

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:10.310 
and move on to the next steps okay we've

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:12.159 
and move on to the next steps okay we've
got<00:06:10.460> all<00:06:10.550> back<00:06:10.789> together<00:06:10.969> now<00:06:11.690> the<00:06:11.780> main<00:06:11.960> one

00:06:12.159 --> 00:06:12.169 
got all back together now the main one

00:06:12.169 --> 00:06:13.220 
got all back together now the main one
you<00:06:12.199> want<00:06:12.409> to<00:06:12.469> leave<00:06:12.620> somewhat

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:13.230 
you want to leave somewhat

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:16.430 
you want to leave somewhat
is<00:06:13.440> this<00:06:13.590> one<00:06:13.800> here<00:06:14.720> I've<00:06:15.720> just<00:06:15.780> got<00:06:16.110> it<00:06:16.140> kind

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:16.440 
is this one here I've just got it kind

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:19.850 
is this one here I've just got it kind
of<00:06:16.560> in<00:06:17.550> there<00:06:17.900> everything<00:06:18.900> else<00:06:19.020> is<00:06:19.170> solid

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:19.860 
of in there everything else is solid

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:22.730 
of in there everything else is solid
these<00:06:20.310> two<00:06:20.520> are<00:06:20.670> fairly<00:06:21.300> tight<00:06:21.720> learn<00:06:22.470> they're

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:22.740 
these two are fairly tight learn they're

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:24.920 
these two are fairly tight learn they're
snug<00:06:23.040> they're<00:06:23.340> not<00:06:23.490> tight<00:06:23.730> so<00:06:24.510> you<00:06:24.690> can<00:06:24.810> see

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:24.930 
snug they're not tight so you can see

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:27.140 
snug they're not tight so you can see
that<00:06:25.110> isn't<00:06:25.290> wearing<00:06:25.620> on<00:06:25.770> that<00:06:26.010> it's<00:06:26.790> just

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:27.150 
that isn't wearing on that it's just

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:29.150 
that isn't wearing on that it's just
this<00:06:27.540> has<00:06:27.690> a<00:06:27.720> slight<00:06:28.110> curve<00:06:28.380> to<00:06:28.650> it<00:06:28.680> because

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:29.160 
this has a slight curve to it because

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:31.220 
this has a slight curve to it because
this<00:06:29.370> is<00:06:29.520> actually<00:06:29.670> a<00:06:29.880> little<00:06:30.030> curved<00:06:30.300> and<00:06:31.200> I

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:31.230 
this is actually a little curved and I

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:33.380 
this is actually a little curved and I
don't<00:06:31.710> that's<00:06:31.950> a<00:06:32.130> manufacturing<00:06:32.700> defect<00:06:32.880> or

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:33.390 
don't that's a manufacturing defect or

00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:36.500 
don't that's a manufacturing defect or
what<00:06:33.690> but<00:06:34.940> there's<00:06:35.940> going<00:06:36.030> to<00:06:36.090> be<00:06:36.150> somewhere

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:36.510 
what but there's going to be somewhere

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:41.600 
what but there's going to be somewhere
so<00:06:37.200> I<00:06:38.030> don't<00:06:39.030> like<00:06:39.330> that<00:06:39.570> but<00:06:39.870> anyway<00:06:40.430> the<00:06:41.430> last

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:41.610 
so I don't like that but anyway the last

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:50.360 
so I don't like that but anyway the last
step<00:06:42.500> let<00:06:43.500> me<00:06:43.590> to<00:06:43.680> put<00:06:43.860> the<00:06:43.920> base<00:06:44.100> on<00:06:48.830> and<00:06:49.830> it's

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:50.370 
step let me to put the base on and it's

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:53.720 
step let me to put the base on and it's
really<00:06:51.060> simple<00:06:51.300> to<00:06:51.540> do<00:06:51.660> here's<00:06:51.960> the<00:06:52.050> base<00:06:52.730> see

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:53.730 
really simple to do here's the base see

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:57.130 
really simple to do here's the base see
there<00:06:53.880> are<00:06:53.970> three<00:06:54.240> threaded<00:06:54.750> holes<00:06:54.930> in<00:06:55.140> there

00:06:57.130 --> 00:06:57.140 
there are three threaded holes in there

00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:59.540 
there are three threaded holes in there
get<00:06:58.140> them<00:06:58.230> on<00:06:58.380> there<00:06:58.590> where<00:06:58.770> you<00:06:58.800> want<00:06:59.040> I'll

00:06:59.540 --> 00:06:59.550 
get them on there where you want I'll

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:04.250 
get them on there where you want I'll
put<00:06:59.760> it<00:06:59.880> that<00:07:00.210> way<00:07:01.760> and<00:07:02.760> then<00:07:03.150> it<00:07:03.660> does<00:07:04.050> come

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:04.260 
put it that way and then it does come

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.800 
put it that way and then it does come
with<00:07:04.290> an<00:07:04.500> allen<00:07:05.180> allen<00:07:06.180> key

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:06.810 
with an allen allen key

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:12.410 
with an allen allen key
here's<00:07:07.740> your<00:07:09.860> screws<00:07:10.860> go<00:07:11.850> ahead<00:07:12.120> and<00:07:12.270> put<00:07:12.390> some

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:19.370 
Loctite on those as well just a little
bit<00:07:16.860> you'll<00:07:17.220> need<00:07:17.340> a<00:07:17.370> whole<00:07:17.550> lot<00:07:17.960> and<00:07:18.960> then<00:07:19.170> go

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:19.380 
bit you'll need a whole lot and then go

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:23.090 
bit you'll need a whole lot and then go
ahead<00:07:19.620> and<00:07:19.910> tighten<00:07:20.910> those<00:07:21.120> down<00:07:21.830> now<00:07:22.830> one

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:23.100 
ahead and tighten those down now one

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:26.990 
ahead and tighten those down now one
thing<00:07:23.310> over<00:07:23.550> time<00:07:23.910> we<00:07:24.180> may<00:07:25.190> revisit<00:07:26.190> these<00:07:26.610> and

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:27.000 
thing over time we may revisit these and

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.380 
thing over time we may revisit these and
we<00:07:27.060> may<00:07:27.270> actually<00:07:28.310> cut<00:07:29.310> some<00:07:29.520> slots<00:07:29.880> into<00:07:30.270> the

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:30.390 
we may actually cut some slots into the

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:33.140 
we may actually cut some slots into the
actual<00:07:30.870> the<00:07:31.650> I'll<00:07:32.400> show<00:07:32.670> you<00:07:32.730> I'm<00:07:32.880> talking

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:33.150 
actual the I'll show you I'm talking

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:41.480 
actual the I'll show you I'm talking
about<00:07:33.300> here<00:07:38.780> there<00:07:39.780> is<00:07:39.900> a<00:07:39.930> slot<00:07:40.290> there<00:07:40.350> we<00:07:41.340> may

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:41.490 
about here there is a slot there we may

00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:43.910 
about here there is a slot there we may
actually<00:07:41.730> cut<00:07:42.090> a<00:07:42.120> little<00:07:42.690> deeper<00:07:43.170> slot<00:07:43.680> like

00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:43.920 
actually cut a little deeper slot like

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:47.510 
actually cut a little deeper slot like
an<00:07:44.070> actual<00:07:44.600> vertical<00:07:45.600> slot<00:07:45.840> in<00:07:46.020> there<00:07:46.170> to<00:07:46.740> keep

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:47.520 
an actual vertical slot in there to keep

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:49.160 
an actual vertical slot in there to keep
those<00:07:47.700> in<00:07:47.760> even<00:07:48.120> further<00:07:48.300> we<00:07:48.570> may<00:07:48.720> have<00:07:48.930> to<00:07:49.050> do

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:49.170 
those in even further we may have to do

00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:51.680 
those in even further we may have to do
that<00:07:49.320> it<00:07:49.470> won't<00:07:49.560> spend<00:07:49.860> those<00:07:50.070> so<00:07:50.970> I'll

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:51.690 
that it won't spend those so I'll

00:07:51.690 --> 00:07:53.150 
that it won't spend those so I'll
revisit<00:07:51.870> that<00:07:52.290> later<00:07:52.530> if<00:07:52.710> that<00:07:52.830> does<00:07:53.010> become

00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:53.160 
revisit that later if that does become

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:56.200 
revisit that later if that does become
an<00:07:53.400> issue<00:07:53.570> so<00:07:54.570> I<00:07:54.930> don't<00:07:55.260> think<00:07:55.470> it<00:07:55.590> we<00:07:55.800> don't

00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:56.210 
an issue so I don't think it we don't

00:07:56.210 --> 00:07:59.420 
an issue so I don't think it we don't
but<00:07:57.210> you<00:07:57.600> never<00:07:57.750> know<00:07:58.020> so<00:07:58.290> I'm<00:07:59.190> going<00:07:59.310> to<00:07:59.340> go

but you never know so I'm going to go

00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:01.670 
but you never know so I'm going to go
ahead<00:07:59.520> and<00:07:59.700> tighten<00:07:59.850> these<00:08:00.030> up<00:08:00.410> once<00:08:01.410> I<00:08:01.530> get

00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:01.680 
ahead and tighten these up once I get

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:03.440 
ahead and tighten these up once I get
these<00:08:01.770> all<00:08:01.950> tight<00:08:02.190> we'll<00:08:02.490> love<00:08:02.670> test<00:08:03.240> it<00:08:03.360> out

00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:03.450
