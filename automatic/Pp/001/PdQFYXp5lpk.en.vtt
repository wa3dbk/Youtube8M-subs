today we're going to be doing an

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:04.789 
today we're going to be doing an
unboxing<00:00:01.920> of<00:00:02.460> a<00:00:02.580> new<00:00:02.820> SSD<00:00:03.240> from<00:00:03.720> Kingston<00:00:04.290> this

different this is their 100 e series of
SSD<00:00:23.430> Navi<00:00:23.789> plus<00:00:24.060> and<00:00:24.300> this<00:00:24.960> one<00:00:25.230> is<00:00:25.470> fully

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.460 
SSD Navi plus and this one is fully
encrypted<00:00:27.240> so<00:00:27.599> that<00:00:27.720> means<00:00:27.900> your<00:00:28.050> data<00:00:28.230> is

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
encrypted so that means your data is

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.009 
encrypted so that means your data is
completely<00:00:29.189> protected<00:00:29.760> when<00:00:30.300> it<00:00:30.420> is<00:00:30.539> on<00:00:30.750> this

completely protected when it is on this
Drive<00:00:31.439> now<00:00:31.890> what<00:00:32.099> exactly<00:00:32.579> does<00:00:32.700> that<00:00:32.759> mean

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
Drive now what exactly does that mean

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.979 
Drive now what exactly does that mean
well<00:00:33.690> it<00:00:33.930> has<00:00:34.670> 120<00:00:35.670> bit<00:00:35.850> aes<00:00:36.059> hardware

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
well it has 120 bit aes hardware

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.450 
well it has 120 bit aes hardware
encryption<00:00:37.290> which<00:00:37.710> means<00:00:37.950> that<00:00:38.190> you're<00:00:38.309> not

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
encryption which means that you're not

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.190 
encryption which means that you're not
fooling<00:00:38.790> around<00:00:38.879> with<00:00:39.180> any<00:00:39.390> kind<00:00:39.629> of<00:00:39.750> software

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
fooling around with any kind of software

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.290 
fooling around with any kind of software
solution<00:00:40.770> it<00:00:40.920> increases<00:00:41.730> your<00:00:41.760> system<00:00:42.180> and

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
solution it increases your system and

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.760 
solution it increases your system and
application<00:00:42.809> performance<00:00:43.290> well<00:00:43.469> that's<00:00:43.649> just

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
application performance well that's just

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.250 
application performance well that's just
a<00:00:44.149> characteristic<00:00:45.149> of<00:00:45.210> an<00:00:45.329> SSD<00:00:45.719> in<00:00:45.809> general

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
a characteristic of an SSD in general

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.229 
a characteristic of an SSD in general
and<00:00:46.710> it<00:00:46.920> increases<00:00:47.219> reliability<00:00:47.489> so<00:00:48.090> that's

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
and it increases reliability so that's

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.139 
and it increases reliability so that's
another<00:00:48.510> general<00:00:49.020> SSD<00:00:49.640> abilities<00:00:50.640> let's<00:00:51.000> go

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
another general SSD abilities let's go

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.180 
another general SSD abilities let's go
ahead<00:00:51.180> and<00:00:51.360> take<00:00:51.510> this<00:00:51.780> guy<00:00:52.020> out<00:00:52.050> and<00:00:52.829> have<00:00:53.070> a

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
ahead and take this guy out and have a

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.100 
ahead and take this guy out and have a
look<00:00:53.340> this<00:00:53.520> is<00:00:53.640> a<00:00:53.670> 64<00:00:54.329> gig<00:00:54.360> drive<00:00:54.660> although<00:00:55.020> it

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
look this is a 64 gig drive although it

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.240 
look this is a 64 gig drive although it
is<00:00:55.230> available<00:00:55.710> in<00:00:55.829> different<00:00:55.980> capacities

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
is available in different capacities

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.340 
is available in different capacities
depending<00:00:57.180> on<00:00:57.300> your<00:00:57.449> needs<00:01:00.109> sorry<00:01:01.109> I<00:01:01.170> have<00:01:01.320> to

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
depending on your needs sorry I have to

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.369 
depending on your needs sorry I have to
focus<00:01:01.680> what<00:01:02.570> these<00:01:03.570> are<00:01:03.719> nice<00:01:03.960> because

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
focus what these are nice because

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.520 
focus what these are nice because
otherwise<00:01:04.860> I<00:01:05.040> could<00:01:05.659> damage<00:01:06.659> my<00:01:06.840> unboxing

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
otherwise I could damage my unboxing

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.980 
otherwise I could damage my unboxing
fingers<00:01:08.960> of<00:01:09.960> those<00:01:10.290> I<00:01:10.650> mean<00:01:10.860> I<00:01:11.780> would<00:01:12.780> be<00:01:12.960> a

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
fingers of those I mean I would be a

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.289 
fingers of those I mean I would be a
baton<00:01:13.350> boss<00:01:13.530> anything<00:01:14.010> and<00:01:14.939> I'd<00:01:15.030> be<00:01:15.150> in<00:01:15.240> real

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
baton boss anything and I'd be in real

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:21.320 
baton boss anything and I'd be in real
trouble<00:01:17.210> ok<00:01:18.210> here<00:01:18.479> we<00:01:18.509> go<00:01:18.570> so<00:01:19.500> oh<00:01:20.330> they're

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
trouble ok here we go so oh they're

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.300 
trouble ok here we go so oh they're
cleaning<00:01:21.570> up<00:01:21.720> to<00:01:21.900> five<00:01:22.200> times<00:01:22.500> faster<00:01:23.100> than<00:01:23.130> a

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
standard 5400 RPM hard drive I mean I

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.219 
standard 5400 RPM hard drive I mean I
would<00:01:26.970> say<00:01:27.150> that's<00:01:27.330> probably<00:01:27.420> conservative

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
would say that's probably conservative

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.630 
would say that's probably conservative

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.710 
if you're using a 5400 RPM hard drive I
mean<00:01:32.490> obviously<00:01:32.909> they're<00:01:33.180> targeting<00:01:33.600> this

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
mean obviously they're targeting this

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.080
