00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:14.000
I think it is really important to have, maybe if
you're nervous

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.130
or if you are quite new to the system
having someone there who knows the system really well.

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.060
I would just recommend just to have someone
there with you.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.180
I guess when I was overseas I would always
try to have someone with me.

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:28.430
I guess if it is your very first time that
you are getting tested

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:33.070
it is always nice to have someone there whether
it is a coach or a manager.

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:35.660
Often we take team doctors with us
and they are there with us throughout the

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.420
whole process.
If a team doctor is not on hand, then a team

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.540
manager
and if they are not on hand, you are not normally

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.570
a team of one
so take an older team mate along with you.

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.510
They’ll know the process and they will be
able to pull people up

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.600
if they are doing something wrong.
And they will probably we able to answer

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.789
your questions if the interpreter doesn’t
understand.

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:58.210
Never really hurry. I think that makes the
anxiety so much more.

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:03.090
You have finished the race, the blood pressure
is up, you are a bit flustered.

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.470
I would say just to remain calm.
It’s obviously not very natural

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:14.760
for someone to watch you go to the toilet,
or to ask you to pull your top up or your

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:15.530
pants down.

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.040
A couple of things is be well prepared.
So like we said before when you go to

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.880
competition and training always have your
photo id – that’s an awkward one.

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.439
If you are in the drug testing process I always
think

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:29.380
have a chat and relax to try to get your mind
off it

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.549
because what makes you awkward and what makes
it difficult

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.509
for you to perform your test and so forth
is stressing and worrying about it

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.220
so you know have a yarn and relax.

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.049
The best lesson I learnt is don’t drink
too much.

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:50.049
I made that mistake at the Beijing Olympics.
I got tested after my heat and I just

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:52.450
really wanted to get it over and done with
and I thought

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.729
it’s really hot so I drank a couple of bottles
of water.

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.329
My urine sample was too dilute, it has to
be over a certain concentration.

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:04.290
I ended being there for about eight hours
trying to pass a sample

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.640
that was concentrated enough so you know make
sure that you are hydrated

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:15.560
but don’t scull a couple of bottles of water
because you will end up having to stay for

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.040
multiple samples.
So that was a good lesson I learnt.

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.560
I guess in terms of what you ingest or what
you take

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.150
if you are honest and you are doing the right
things

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.300
and you are use the tools and resources that
are available

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.290
you will never have a problem.

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.450
You can document everything on the form.
If you are not happy with the way things are

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:40.319
going
you can list what you think should have happened

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:42.500
and what didn’t happen.

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.370
And I think making sure that you keep that
slip as well

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:50.569
for kind of proof if anything does go wrong,
as Glen said, you have documented it.

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:53.349
Take a deep breath, take a drink, go and sign
in,

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:56.980
take a little bit more time, just take your
time throught the whole process

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.450
and never feel like you have been chased through
it.

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:07.120
It’s part of being an elite athlete
and there a lot of perks to being an elite athlete

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.129
and I guess, you know in a funny way you kind

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:13.890
of look it at
and if you are being tested then they are

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.060
obviously think
you’re good enough to be tested so um yeah.
