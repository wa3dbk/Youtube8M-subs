00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:05.529
 and this Christmas and the end of the year, say no to 

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:07.899
 the pyrotechnics say no to the fires 

00:00:05.529 --> 00:00:10.090
 not only because of the risk of 

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:11.920
 fires and personal accidents 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:16.139
 also by our best friends 

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:16.139
 let's see why in the following story 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.580
 while we have fun 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.740
 observing the majestic display of 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:27.520
 fireworks and firecrackers that 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:30.130
 flood the holidays 

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:32.160
 in our homes these same 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.450
 elements can literally be 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.960
 torturing some members of the 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:40.239
 family our dogs and cats that 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.760
 night was a December 24 two years ago 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:45.129
 years there were pyrotechnic games for 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:47.410
 festivities and the dog started to 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:50.050
 get nervous in less than 15 minutes 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:52.510
 of the dog but he started to throw up 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:54.660
 decompensated and what we can get 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:57.220
 to remove but came practically love 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:00.430
 if the dogs have lived with us 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:02.470
 for tens of thousands of years that was what 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:05.730
 that this snow has become accustomed to 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:07.860
 living as a human almost kills him 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:09.690
 the fact that many treat 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.330
 our pets as if they were 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:14.700
 people do not make these animals 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.760
 lose characteristics and abilities 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.490
 unique that in ancestral times were 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:23.400
 crucial to their survival their 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.680
 nature hunter ancestors of them 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.870
 they inherited an extraordinary ear 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.390
 sensitive and effective at the time of 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:33.240
 identify where a sound comes from 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.910
 and although the human auditory system is 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.980
 considered a great architectural work 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:40.200
 Natural the capture process 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:42.960
 sounds in animals like dogs and cats 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.300
 it far exceeds the system 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.700
 auditory of these animals is designed 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:49.980
 to amplify many things and for that 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.230
 the dogs the cats also have 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:54.450
 a system of movement in the ears 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:57.060
 of location is very common to see the 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:00.210
 animals that move their ears as if 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.670
 were antennas antennae of a radar is 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.400
 say that while the sounds are the 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.710
 these are captured with different 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:10.110
 intensity depending on the subject that 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.610
 he perceives them now we go through these 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.330
 teams generate a sound that 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.570
 we 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:17.280
 white noise that is similar to sound 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:19.380
 that is generated when in our 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.030
 television suddenly the signal of the 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.280
 channel 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.110
 is the level at which the human would listen 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.890
 that sound 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.810
 now let's simulate the perception 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.040
 approximate that an animal would have 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.850
 dog or a kitten 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.850
 of the same sound 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:45.340
 which gives us a good idea 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:47.020
 pretty sure how strong they 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.270
 they listen to things that for us are very 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:51.040
 everyday when we explode a firecracker 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:53.260
 we hear it as a sound 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.450
 very strong the animal hears it which 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.280
 if that explosion were five times 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.470
 closer as if exploding firecracker 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.330
 here very close to the drum that is like 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.870
 if a human was exposed to the 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:06.610
 turbine of an aircraft extremely close 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:09.220
 these are known as sounds of 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:11.290
 impact and can not only cause damage 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.750
 physical in the ear of our pets 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:16.239
 but they create phobias and alter the 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:18.670
 behavior of these and can bring 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:20.290
 deadly consequences ready animals 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.209
 that have been thrown from terraces and 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.730
 puppies that have had contact with 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:26.830
 glasses that there have been accidents very 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:29.440
 painful about the consequences 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:33.040
 later in its psychological aspect 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:35.610
 They are nervous and you have to 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:38.650
 treat them exist discs exist 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:40.630
 recordings to which we can go 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:43.030
 subduing the dog in a very 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:46.420
 slight very dim until they leave 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:50.410
 getting used chairs noises noises 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:53.200
 cars and even firearms that with 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:55.120
 Noises appeased noises that really do not 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:58.600
 expose them in a direct way 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:00.549
 but gradually to the puppy although 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.769
 it is true that gunpowder is part of 

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:04.900
 our holidays is also real that 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:07.450
 We can take precautions to prevent 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:10.209
 the discomfort of our pets is 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:13.810
 important that you keep it within 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:17.590
 house it is important that at the moment you 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:20.290
 start the two firecrackers and the 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:22.060
 noises begin to embrace what 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:24.880
 begin to caress begin 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:27.280
 really to create an attitude of 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:29.290
 I play with the dog in such a way that 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:33.370
 every time there are louder noises 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:35.129
 more secure the animal sits first 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:38.459
 at home 

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:41.159
 have you with something where your ears will 

00:04:38.459 --> 00:04:42.689
 we distract with food with games but 

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:45.569
 Of course for that you have to stay with 

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:47.909
 the dog all the time 

00:04:45.569 --> 00:04:50.369
 our pets are many times 

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:52.619
 members of our family and although 

00:04:50.369 --> 00:04:55.469
 We generally do not make exceptions to the 

00:04:52.619 --> 00:04:57.779
 time to treat them feed them and up 

00:04:55.469 --> 00:05:00.059
 dress the only difference between 

00:04:57.779 --> 00:05:02.219
 them and us is that while the 

00:05:00.059 --> 00:05:04.800
 human beings we are able to decide 

00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:07.110
 if we avoid or witness this type 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:09.899
 of rumblings they depend entirely 

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:12.660
 of our care to pass these 

00:05:09.899 --> 00:05:15.420
 parties in peace 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:17.250
 so this Christmas of a lot of love to 

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:20.010
 your animals and do not use fires 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:21.720
 artificial and on behalf of all those 

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:23.790
 we make the program television and 

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:25.440
