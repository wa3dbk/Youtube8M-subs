00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:18.220
 Hi, everyone here, professor Luciano da 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:19.660
 easy math 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.630
 today we are going to our third 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:27.570
 line of complex numbers and the subject 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:27.570
 will be equal to complex numbers 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:40.120
 defining complex numbers when 

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:42.870
 unreal imaginary part of two numbers 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:46.480
 are the same 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.960
 we say that these complex numbers are 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:51.520
 equals 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.770
 so here we have two numbers 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.880
 complexes not with the real part and 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:59.350
 imaginary 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:01:03.940
 the first complex number is a + bee 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:06.850
 the second is being, but when the two 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:11.590
 are equal we have bone aegon 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:13.600
 neither the real parts are the same and b is 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:17.069
 just like him 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:21.209
 the real part of the imaginary number is 

00:01:17.069 --> 00:01:21.209
 This coefficient here im 

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:27.749
 they are the same as b is equal to 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:37.650
 we will now do an exercise the 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:44.150
 4 and complex numbers but nine 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:46.700
 equal to two and two and more times 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:50.160
 they are the same 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:55.700
 determine know then exerts is me 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:58.290
 saying that the real parts and the parties 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:01.440
 of these two numbers 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:05.750
 complexes are the same 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:13.200
 so we're going to set up a system 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:16.530
 four and three more of go 2 the real part 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:19.200
 of this complex first name which is 4c 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:22.110
 more will be equal to the real part of the 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:29.010
 second complex number that two days ago 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:34.500
 so I'm going to have 4 c's but equal 2 in 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:38.160
 marginal part area I 'm going to have 19 goes 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:40.980
 be equal to 2 and more of neon 9 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.860
 multiply wii the 2 and but also 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:48.570
 multiplies it and then 9 is equal to 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:51.840
 2 and more of us have here two and 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:55.549
 more equals 9 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.549
 so here is my system 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:03.480
 we will multiply the second equation 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:10.410
 for two 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:11.370
 we'll have four more to be two equal 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:15.750
 to 18 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:19.140
 my second equation is two and more of 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:20.850
 equal to 9 or modify everything by two goes 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:24.900
 stay 4 c 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:28.170
 but two equal to 18 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:33.150
 It is that I have down here the system 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:39.570
 will be 4 c + 3d 3d equal to 2 and the other 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:42.630
 equation will be 4 c + 2 equals 18 and 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:49.050
 subtracting one equation from the other 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:57.090
 I'll have 4 c - 4 c is equal to zero 3d - 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:04:06.660
 2 t of 2 - 18 time gives less 16 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:08.610
 therefore the equation will be equal to minus 16 and 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:10.800
 to discover the value of being us 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:11.970
 we replace what we find in the 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:15.120
 previous slide 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:19.739
 in the second equation the second equation to 2 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:24.470
 and more unequal 9 in place of the de and I 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:30.570
 I put the -16 neco is the value I found 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:34.050
 2 is then equal to 92 and -16 and is 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:37.290
 equal to 9 plus six nÃ© walk - 16 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:43.710
 on the other hand of equality 2 and is equal 

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:48.030
 at 25 c is equal to 25 on two therefore 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:53.280
 and is equal to 25 over two that is 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:55.550
 equal to minus 16 touch until next 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.550
