00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.680
 the atmospheric blockade was broken 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.540
 totally exactly what we people 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.450
 can see about this trend of 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.860
 rain until the 22nd or until the 22nd 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.839
 People see that there's a little more rain 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.060
 on areas of São Paulo and some blows 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.859
 of rain on the state of são paulo 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.779
 however the region of the Midwest 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.850
 still maintains the subsistence condition 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.369
 daily personal still firm time 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:29.369
 predominating in this area, ie air 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.859
 dry, ie the average levels a high 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.469
 atmospheric pressure , preventing the 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:37.020
 of these themes is precisely why the 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.940
 People talked about breaking the blockade. 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.760
 atmospheric but it is a partial disruption 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.770
 is a move to areas from the southeast to 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.809
 region still continues with 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.149
 prevailing air is forecast 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.980
 rain on south-central areas of the 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.480
 mato grosso do sul has forecast 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.910
 but we should not have rain for 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.710
 example on areas of mato grosso goiás 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.539
 federal district 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.149
 we still maintain an air condition more 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.710
 dry areas in these areas are also expected to 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.229
 a little more rain over areas of the 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.119
 coast of Bahia due to the staff 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.130
 of some incompatible instabilities 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.350
 of the sea has weakened from this 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.030
 rainfall due to the removal of the 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.740
 subtropical region of the South Atlantic and 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.330
 end of August 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.310
 we should have a little more rain on 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.530
 areas of southern brazil is showing a 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.299
 little advance of the cold fronts 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.189
 the men of rains intensify 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.830
 about areas of santa catarina south center 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.180
 of the paraná areas of the north gaúcho 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.640
 men can reach 150 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.430
 accumulated in these shades of 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.470
 Green south-central region also of O 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.270
 mato grosso do sul has the channeling of 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.549
 instabilities in a little more rain 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.270
 on these areas the state of são paulo 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.360
 also 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:45.119
 after more than 22 days without the presence 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.189
 she returns to the island on the fourth 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.140
 but there is still provision for 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.180
 some systems pass over areas 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.009
 and bring rain to this 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.930
 The region is also forecasting a 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.670
 rainfall over areas of rio de janeiro and 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.860
 was also in the southern region of mines 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.890
 general in these areas the numbers may 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:04.259
 reach the age of 150 or even 70 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.360
 millimeters accumulated depending on the area 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:09.119
 where you are now areas of the 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:12.450
 region of mato grosso goiás region 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.000
 tocantins south west bahía 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.010
 region 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.200
 the northwest mining triangle of mines 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.700
 also the subsidence of air still 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.190
 is strong and I do not have a condition 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.830
 favorable to rain so the predominance 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:26.350
 in this area is still to leave dry and 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.360
 little rain and high temperatures and 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:29.110
 Relative humidity still falls during 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.740
 the afternoon 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.740
 in this region
