00:00:15.315 --> 00:00:20.193
 this is a special match because it is 1/8 LM 

00:00:20.701 --> 00:00:23.123
 we have a chance to go round the next 

00:00:23.123 --> 00:00:26.158
 and it is our dream to play in Final4 

00:00:26.814 --> 00:00:28.370
 we know how long the road is ahead of us 

00:00:28.796 --> 00:00:32.000
 and in addition I'm going to the band where I played six years. 

00:00:32.558 --> 00:00:38.445
 It seems to me that the RNL are especially motivated for this match 

00:00:38.705 --> 00:00:43.001
 because they lost a wild card with us a few years ago 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.754
 it may be like a rematch for them. We want to prove everyone 

00:00:46.754 --> 00:00:49.474
 that despite the third place in the group 

00:00:50.108 --> 00:00:54.070
 we are a very good team and we want to get into LM as far as possible. 

00:00:54.763 --> 00:01:00.129
 To be or not to be - so for us it is obviously a match of the season 

00:01:00.587 --> 00:01:04.876
 It was only a month and a half ago that the defense system was changed 

00:01:04.876 --> 00:01:08.673
 and there are still many opportunities to improve it 

00:01:09.524 --> 00:01:14.062
 we are in the upward direction and we have a chance to play even better 

00:01:14.681 --> 00:01:15.916
 both in defense and in attack 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.575
 There are no sentiments in any of the matches 

00:01:18.956 --> 00:01:22.122
 On the one hand, I'm happy to meet my friends 

00:01:22.707 --> 00:01:25.290
 all this is planned after the match 

00:01:25.702 --> 00:01:26.763
 most importantly for me the match is the most important 

00:01:27.324 --> 00:01:31.588
 we have 4 goals and we are going there not to defend the result only 

00:01:33.354 --> 00:01:36.225
 after you to win and show everyone that we deserve to be promoted to the next round 

00:01:36.908 --> 00:01:45.500
 We put everything into these two meetings and of course everything depends on the second match 

00:01:45.504 --> 00:01:48.190
 Whether we go further or not. As I said - it will be a match to be or not to be .... 

00:01:52.127 --> 00:01:54.000
 for every team from Poland 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.210
 if you are playing in Germany or in France 

00:01:56.206 --> 00:01:58.840
 these are the Polish flags that can be seen in the stands 

00:01:59.802 --> 00:02:03.840
 not only our Kielce supporters, but people who commute 

00:02:04.617 --> 00:02:06.390
 or continue to flow. That was during the match in Dunkirk 

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:10.630
 where was the group from Great Britain who came specially for the match 

00:02:11.011 --> 00:02:14.160
 we expect it, it is a great support for us 

00:02:14.501 --> 00:02:17.760
 we know that Mannheim is quite far from Kielce 

00:02:18.028 --> 00:02:21.430
 but we are waiting for support because it will be very important 

00:02:21.433 --> 00:02:28.310
 if the German fans are adding, then a group of 100-200 Poles will be important for us in this match 

00:02:28.824 --> 00:02:31.980
 We will fight on the field and you support us in the hall 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.160
 and keep your fingers crossed for us! We hope that we will drown out the German fans 

00:02:35.494 --> 00:02:41.050
 we need your support at the hall in Germany. I encourage all Poles who live in Germany 

00:02:41.272 --> 00:02:44.310
 near Mannheim to come to the match and keep their fingers crossed for us. Greetings!
