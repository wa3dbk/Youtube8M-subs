00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.259
 hello everyone, we have another one today 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.799
 unpacking this time is very small 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.980
 bag 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:13.349
 didn’t come them long enough fast 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.440
 honestly did not track how many days 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:19.640
 it went here with us 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:24.800
 the little thing is absolutely small 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:31.230
 We have this type of external sound card 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:34.460
 Well, not the type of attack on there Yusbi card input 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:37.829
 we have a microphone and headphone output 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:40.620
 I do not use it as a sound card 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:43.430
 I was going to be on that penny 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.410
 is there a dollar or two 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:49.500
 it is very small but the link will be below i 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.180
 just now I don’t remember why I bought it 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.020
 to use as 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:57.930
 microphone amplifier because let's say 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.449
 If you take a condenser microphone, then he 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.239
 directly the computer they work not so hot 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.150
 need to buy separate 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.920
 microphone amplifier 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:10.409
 well, just if you don't have a microphone 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.840
 very good quality is also needed 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.630
 amplifier so here these cards and i 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:19.290
 I read them in various forums praise 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.600
 that despite being very cheap 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:25.710
 but as a microphone amplifier they 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:28.470
 work just fine ok so i want 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:31.860
 try how it will work for us 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:34.640
 together with skype it is very easy by the way 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:38.070
 it opens it is not sealed 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:44.659
 let's show them inside right away how she is 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:44.659
 the quartz microcircuit is arranged 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:54.799
 so such a little very cheap 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:55.670
 shawl and as they say should work 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:58.609
 OK 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:03.979
 I do not know well, in principle, let us now 

00:01:58.609 --> 00:02:06.409
 I'll check it with you and install it now. 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:11.480
 some sound recording software 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:14.530
 and try from the built-in sound card 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.579
 from you then her sound card asus 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.260
 quite expensive such 

00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:20.959
 professional music cards 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:26.599
 through it we will try and we will try through 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:31.280
 here this moth start recording sound on 

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:36.530
 card asus xonar ds time two three 4 5 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:41.379
 Bunny went for a walk once or twice a record 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:45.500
 sound with 3d sound distance too 

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:50.950
 let's see two times three 4 5 and again record 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.950
 sound asus xonar ds 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:58.240
 one-two-three in my opinion it's louder 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:01.540
 you yourself have heard everything means the only thing you 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:04.090
 did not hear the recording from the native 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.700
 Built zvukovuhi in motherboard only 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.830
 for one simple reason that there really 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:13.360
 I could not hear anything so I did not 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:15.640
 turn on microphone there is a favor it is not 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:18.310
 verbatim that cap is changed there stands 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:21.810
 cap from some mobile phone 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:24.730
 I put in pretty sensitive 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:28.330
 then in my case, the miracle did not happen 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:31.030
 but yours may happen that is 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:32.070
 Of course , this is a good sound thing. 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.830
 here's a card 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:39.220
 axanar will not replace axanar this is axanar 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:42.580
 It gives not only high-quality sound on 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:45.670
 speakers on and quite good quality 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:48.010
 records but when compared to 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:50.490
 built zvukovuhi then it certainly 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:54.850
 better stuff 

00:03:50.490 --> 00:04:01.090
 so if you have no money for good 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:04:04.600
 xanar type card then yes I can safely 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:06.810
 recommend this little thing 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:16.419
 very cheap and 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:19.419
 principle strengthens well you yourself 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:21.609
 everyone heard but something for someone will 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:24.630
 very useful besides it costs 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:29.700
 pennies all ssylochka below the video 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:29.700
 go out see if you need to buy
