00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:02.850 
on today's digital segment I'm going to

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:04.010 
on today's digital segment I'm going to
show<00:00:02.939> you<00:00:03.120> how<00:00:03.360> to<00:00:03.419> make<00:00:03.570> some<00:00:03.840> beautiful

show you how to make some beautiful
cards<00:00:04.650> by<00:00:04.859> printing<00:00:05.160> on<00:00:05.279> transparencies<00:00:06.180> I

00:00:07.059 --> 00:00:07.069 
cards by printing on transparencies I

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:10.339 
cards by printing on transparencies I
started<00:00:08.069> with<00:00:08.189> a<00:00:08.250> photo<00:00:08.639> of<00:00:08.940> cactus<00:00:09.690> to<00:00:10.170> make

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
started with a photo of cactus to make

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.080 
started with a photo of cactus to make
this<00:00:10.559> card<00:00:10.950> and<00:00:11.250> you<00:00:11.370> can<00:00:11.400> see<00:00:11.759> that<00:00:11.969> the

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
this card and you can see that the

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.570 
this card and you can see that the
transparency<00:00:12.870> is<00:00:12.990> lifted<00:00:13.440> up<00:00:13.620> off<00:00:13.799> of<00:00:13.889> the

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
transparency is lifted up off of the

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.340 
transparency is lifted up off of the
base<00:00:14.730> card<00:00:15.120> and<00:00:15.360> that<00:00:15.750> gives<00:00:15.900> it<00:00:16.080> a<00:00:16.139> lot<00:00:16.289> of

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
base card and that gives it a lot of

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.140 
base card and that gives it a lot of
dimension<00:00:16.740> so<00:00:17.490> let's<00:00:17.670> go<00:00:17.820> to<00:00:17.910> the<00:00:18.029> computer

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
dimension so let's go to the computer

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.260 
dimension so let's go to the computer
and<00:00:18.630> find<00:00:19.080> out<00:00:19.199> how<00:00:19.320> i<00:00:19.350> did<00:00:19.500> this<00:00:19.619> i<00:00:20.240> have<00:00:21.240> a

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
and find out how i did this i have a

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.779 
and find out how i did this i have a
photo<00:00:21.539> open<00:00:22.050> in<00:00:22.260> a<00:00:22.740> kaleidoscope<00:00:23.220> software

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
photo open in a kaleidoscope software

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.670 
photo open in a kaleidoscope software
and<00:00:24.000> you<00:00:24.600> can<00:00:24.720> see<00:00:24.900> one<00:00:25.199> wedge<00:00:25.470> of<00:00:25.619> the

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
and you can see one wedge of the

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.259 
and you can see one wedge of the
kaleidoscope<00:00:26.220> here<00:00:26.460> on<00:00:26.550> the<00:00:26.670> screen<00:00:26.910> in<00:00:27.210> the

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
kaleidoscope here on the screen in the

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.450 
kaleidoscope here on the screen in the
upper<00:00:27.900> right<00:00:28.080> is<00:00:28.260> a<00:00:28.349> thumbnail<00:00:28.800> preview<00:00:29.279> and

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
upper right is a thumbnail preview and

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.999 
upper right is a thumbnail preview and
if<00:00:30.060> you<00:00:30.150> click<00:00:30.390> on<00:00:30.420> the<00:00:30.720> preview<00:00:30.900> button<00:00:31.109> then

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
if you click on the preview button then

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.920 
if you click on the preview button then
you<00:00:32.160> can<00:00:32.309> see<00:00:32.550> what<00:00:33.090> that<00:00:33.210> design<00:00:33.540> is<00:00:33.570> going<00:00:33.840> to

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
you can see what that design is going to

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.680 
you can see what that design is going to
look<00:00:34.079> like<00:00:34.110> in<00:00:34.440> a<00:00:34.500> full<00:00:34.680> screen<00:00:34.980> mode<00:00:35.160> I

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:35.690 
look like in a full screen mode I

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.389 
look like in a full screen mode I
actually<00:00:36.690> want<00:00:37.110> a<00:00:37.290> square<00:00:37.680> shape<00:00:38.010> for<00:00:38.309> this

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
actually want a square shape for this

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.280 
actually want a square shape for this
kaleidoscope<00:00:38.760> so<00:00:39.300> I'm<00:00:39.420> going<00:00:39.690> to<00:00:39.719> go<00:00:39.960> to<00:00:40.020> the

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
kaleidoscope so I'm going to go to the

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.160 
kaleidoscope so I'm going to go to the
template<00:00:40.680> selector<00:00:41.190> and<00:00:41.570> scroll<00:00:42.570> down<00:00:42.809> until

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
template selector and scroll down until

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.459 
template selector and scroll down until
I<00:00:43.559> find<00:00:43.950> a<00:00:44.160> square<00:00:44.520> and<00:00:45.050> you'll<00:00:46.050> notice<00:00:46.289> that

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
I find a square and you'll notice that

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.709 
I find a square and you'll notice that
the<00:00:47.039> template<00:00:47.489> shape<00:00:47.670> is<00:00:47.820> going<00:00:48.030> to<00:00:48.149> change<00:00:48.390> in

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
the template shape is going to change in

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.139 
the template shape is going to change in
the<00:00:48.809> workspace<00:00:49.140> here<00:00:49.590> now<00:00:50.309> I<00:00:50.340> can<00:00:50.700> do<00:00:50.789> a<00:00:50.820> lot<00:00:51.090> of

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
the workspace here now I can do a lot of

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.209 
the workspace here now I can do a lot of
manipulation<00:00:51.629> to<00:00:52.050> this<00:00:52.199> photo<00:00:52.469> I<00:00:52.590> can<00:00:52.829> rotate

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
manipulation to this photo I can rotate

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.860 
manipulation to this photo I can rotate
it<00:00:53.370> by<00:00:53.399> clicking<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:54.030> dragging<00:00:54.090> outside<00:00:54.750> the

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
it by clicking and dragging outside the

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.900 
it by clicking and dragging outside the
boundary<00:00:55.260> I<00:00:55.500> can<00:00:55.980> move<00:00:56.129> it<00:00:56.219> around<00:00:56.280> clicking

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
boundary I can move it around clicking

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.569 
boundary I can move it around clicking
on<00:00:57.090> the<00:00:57.239> photo<00:00:57.480> itself<00:00:57.710> but<00:00:58.710> in<00:00:58.949> this<00:00:59.129> case<00:00:59.520> to

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
on the photo itself but in this case to

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.580 
on the photo itself but in this case to
make<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.149> card<00:01:00.390> I<00:01:00.510> didn't<00:01:00.780> have<00:01:00.930> to<00:01:01.079> do<00:01:01.199> too

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
make the card I didn't have to do too

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.810 
make the card I didn't have to do too
much<00:01:01.890> manipulation<00:01:03.530> so<00:01:04.530> this<00:01:05.430> is<00:01:05.640> about

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
much manipulation so this is about

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.149 
much manipulation so this is about
position<00:01:06.600> i<00:01:06.720> had<00:01:06.960> if<00:01:07.229> i<00:01:07.380> want<00:01:07.619> to<00:01:07.680> see<00:01:07.860> a<00:01:07.890> full

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
position i had if i want to see a full

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.710 
position i had if i want to see a full
screen<00:01:08.460> version<00:01:08.820> again<00:01:09.030> i<00:01:09.090> click<00:01:09.450> on<00:01:09.600> that

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
screen version again i click on that

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.870 
screen version again i click on that
preview<00:01:10.049> button<00:01:10.320> and<00:01:10.590> that<00:01:11.340> looks<00:01:11.640> pretty

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
preview button and that looks pretty

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.630 
preview button and that looks pretty
good<00:01:12.119> so<00:01:12.360> i'm<00:01:13.260> going<00:01:13.530> to<00:01:13.680> print<00:01:14.130> that<00:01:14.280> out<00:01:14.340> on

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
good so i'm going to print that out on

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.120 
good so i'm going to print that out on
the<00:01:14.729> transparency<00:01:15.509> just<00:01:16.080> one<00:01:16.380> simple

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
the transparency just one simple

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.870 
the transparency just one simple
kaleidoscope<00:01:17.909> so<00:01:18.630> print<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.140> kaleidoscope

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:19.880 
kaleidoscope so print the kaleidoscope

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.469 
kaleidoscope so print the kaleidoscope
fairly<00:01:20.880> small<00:01:21.150> size<00:01:21.450> and<00:01:23.180> don't<00:01:24.180> need<00:01:24.330> any

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
fairly small size and don't need any

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.719 
fairly small size and don't need any
margins<00:01:24.930> and<00:01:25.110> click<00:01:25.320> OK<00:01:25.680> and<00:01:25.860> then<00:01:25.950> set<00:01:26.549> the

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
margins and click OK and then set the

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.450 
margins and click OK and then set the
printer<00:01:27.030> dialog<00:01:27.689> to<00:01:28.110> print<00:01:28.470> on<00:01:28.650> transparency

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
printer dialog to print on transparency

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.730 
printer dialog to print on transparency
now<00:01:30.119> let's<00:01:30.329> go<00:01:30.450> to<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.630> printer<00:01:30.990> and<00:01:31.020> see<00:01:31.590> what

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
now let's go to the printer and see what

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.390 
now let's go to the printer and see what
came<00:01:31.950> out<00:01:32.100> in<00:01:33.290> this<00:01:34.290> case<00:01:34.500> we<00:01:34.799> just<00:01:34.979> have<00:01:35.189> a

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
came out in this case we just have a

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.280 
came out in this case we just have a
simple<00:01:35.729> kaleidoscope<00:01:36.509> and<00:01:36.720> in<00:01:36.810> fact<00:01:36.990> I<00:01:37.229> could

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
simple kaleidoscope and in fact I could

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.120 
simple kaleidoscope and in fact I could
cut<00:01:37.740> that<00:01:37.979> sheet<00:01:38.939> again<00:01:39.270> if<00:01:39.479> I<00:01:39.600> wanted<00:01:39.960> to<00:01:40.130> and

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
cut that sheet again if I wanted to and

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.710 
cut that sheet again if I wanted to and
put<00:01:41.579> it<00:01:41.670> through<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:41.909> printer<00:01:42.090> again<00:01:42.299> so<00:01:42.689> that

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
put it through the printer again so that

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.870 
put it through the printer again so that
I'm<00:01:42.960> not<00:01:42.990> wasting<00:01:43.290> too<00:01:43.649> much<00:01:43.680> stuff<00:01:44.130> when<00:01:44.759> you

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
I'm not wasting too much stuff when you

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.700 
I'm not wasting too much stuff when you
cut<00:01:45.180> it<00:01:45.329> out<00:01:45.479> you<00:01:45.810> want<00:01:45.990> to<00:01:46.079> make<00:01:46.200> sure<00:01:46.229> that

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
cut it out you want to make sure that

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.710 
cut it out you want to make sure that
you<00:01:46.799> have<00:01:47.130> enough<00:01:47.430> space<00:01:48.030> around<00:01:48.509> the

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
you have enough space around the

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.300 
you have enough space around the
kaleidoscope<00:01:49.259> design<00:01:49.649> so<00:01:49.950> that<00:01:49.979> you<00:01:50.159> can

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
kaleidoscope design so that you can

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.010 
kaleidoscope design so that you can
actually<00:01:50.490> adhere<00:01:51.060> it<00:01:51.090> to<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:51.420> cardstock<00:01:51.750> that

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
actually adhere it to the cardstock that

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.920 
actually adhere it to the cardstock that
you're<00:01:52.320> going<00:01:52.530> to<00:01:52.649> be<00:01:52.770> using<00:01:52.950> I<00:01:53.570> like<00:01:54.570> double

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
you're going to be using I like double

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.450 
you're going to be using I like double
matting<00:01:55.259> because<00:01:55.530> I<00:01:55.560> think<00:01:55.680> it<00:01:55.979> gives<00:01:56.100> a<00:01:56.280> more

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
matting because I think it gives a more

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.240 
matting because I think it gives a more
finished<00:01:56.759> look<00:01:57.149> and<00:01:57.719> so<00:01:58.140> I've<00:01:58.259> cut<00:01:58.500> to<00:01:58.829> matts

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
finished look and so I've cut to matts

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.569 
finished look and so I've cut to matts
slightly<00:02:00.240> smaller<00:02:00.600> holes<00:02:01.140> and<00:02:01.469> you<00:02:02.369> just

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
slightly smaller holes and you just

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.569 
slightly smaller holes and you just
layer<00:02:02.939> the<00:02:03.299> kaleidoscope<00:02:03.960> behind<00:02:04.350> it<00:02:04.579> attach

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
layer the kaleidoscope behind it attach

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.029 
layer the kaleidoscope behind it attach
that<00:02:05.850> with<00:02:06.030> adhesive<00:02:06.540> and<00:02:06.689> then<00:02:06.960> use<00:02:07.170> a<00:02:07.439> foam

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
that with adhesive and then use a foam

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.699 
that with adhesive and then use a foam
adhesive<00:02:08.550> to<00:02:08.879> make<00:02:09.599> it<00:02:09.750> dimensional<00:02:10.289> pop<00:02:10.530> it

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
adhesive to make it dimensional pop it

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.760 
adhesive to make it dimensional pop it
up<00:02:10.800> off<00:02:11.039> the<00:02:11.280> card<00:02:11.550> base<00:02:11.730> so<00:02:12.660> let's<00:02:12.840> look<00:02:12.959> at

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
up off the card base so let's look at

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.800 
up off the card base so let's look at
other<00:02:14.190> cards<00:02:14.640> that<00:02:14.790> I've<00:02:14.880> created<00:02:15.090> in<00:02:15.540> about

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
other cards that I've created in about

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.620 
other cards that I've created in about
the<00:02:16.020> same<00:02:16.200> way<00:02:16.260> this<00:02:17.160> one<00:02:17.460> actually<00:02:17.730> is<00:02:18.240> almost

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
the same way this one actually is almost

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.230 
the same way this one actually is almost
exactly<00:02:18.810> the<00:02:19.290> same<00:02:19.440> way<00:02:19.880> this<00:02:20.880> one<00:02:21.090> is<00:02:21.210> a

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
exactly the same way this one is a

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:26.150 
exactly the same way this one is a
circle<00:02:21.810> and<00:02:21.990> it<00:02:22.890> flips<00:02:23.430> up<00:02:23.750> with<00:02:24.750> a<00:02:25.130> piece<00:02:26.130> of

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
circle and it flips up with a piece of

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.460 
circle and it flips up with a piece of
paper<00:02:26.430> behind<00:02:26.730> it<00:02:27.150> this<00:02:27.660> one's<00:02:27.900> the<00:02:28.050> same<00:02:28.260> way

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
paper behind it this one's the same way

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.680 
paper behind it this one's the same way
i<00:02:28.710> created<00:02:29.220> a<00:02:29.310> frame<00:02:29.550> using<00:02:29.820> the<00:02:30.060> kaleidoscope

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
i created a frame using the kaleidoscope

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.170 
i created a frame using the kaleidoscope
and<00:02:31.100> stamped<00:02:32.100> as<00:02:32.190> saying<00:02:32.430> in<00:02:32.610> the<00:02:32.700> center<00:02:33.060> and

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
and stamped as saying in the center and

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.340 
and stamped as saying in the center and
that's<00:02:34.110> today's<00:02:34.470> digital<00:02:34.710> segment
