I expected a kind of desert of a sudden
but<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:04.530> place<00:01:04.800> is<00:01:05.370> remarkably<00:01:06.180> similar

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
but the the place is remarkably similar

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.070 
but the the place is remarkably similar
to<00:01:06.870> the<00:01:07.140> one<00:01:07.680> left<00:01:08.210> which<00:01:09.210> is<00:01:09.390> logical<00:01:09.960> after

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
to the one left which is logical after

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.090 
to the one left which is logical after
all<00:01:10.440> is<00:01:10.710> the<00:01:10.770> same<00:01:11.130> mountain<00:01:11.580> range<00:01:11.990> and<00:01:13.100> we

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
all is the same mountain range and we

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.190 
all is the same mountain range and we
are<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.580> reason<00:01:14.730> overview<00:01:15.450> let's<00:01:15.960> take<00:01:16.170> a

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
are the reason overview let's take a

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.410 
are the reason overview let's take a
look

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
look

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.930 
look
it<00:01:18.420> does<00:01:18.690> look<00:01:18.960> quite<00:01:19.260> a<00:01:19.410> desert<00:01:20.130> tick<00:01:20.400> an<00:01:20.610> arid

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:20.940 
it does look quite a desert tick an arid

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.320 
it does look quite a desert tick an arid
place<00:01:21.650> and<00:01:22.650> it<00:01:23.190> seems<00:01:23.490> we're<00:01:23.729> doing<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.240> right

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
place and it seems we're doing the right

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.710 
place and it seems we're doing the right
direction<00:01:24.570> I<00:01:25.760> really<00:01:26.760> like<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.360> fact<00:01:27.540> that

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
direction I really like the fact that

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.570 
direction I really like the fact that
the<00:01:27.930> transition<00:01:28.619> between<00:01:28.800> these<00:01:29.220> two

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:29.580 
the transition between these two

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.240 
the transition between these two
different<00:01:29.700> climates<00:01:30.600> is<00:01:31.050> very<00:01:31.380> gradual

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
different climates is very gradual

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.370 
different climates is very gradual
it<00:01:32.940> really<00:01:33.270> makes<00:01:33.600> you<00:01:33.750> believe<00:01:33.990> you're

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:38.390 
is a lot to be implemented and let's
explain<00:02:36.690> the<00:02:37.140> purple<00:02:37.620> tree<00:02:37.920> you<00:02:38.190> see

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
explain the purple tree you see

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.750 
explain the purple tree you see
somewhere<00:02:38.760> around<00:02:39.350> the<00:02:40.350> exterior<00:02:40.740> has<00:02:41.430> not

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
somewhere around the exterior has not

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.380 
somewhere around the exterior has not
been<00:02:42.060> enough<00:02:42.630> measured<00:02:43.670> that's<00:02:44.670> why<00:02:45.000> some<00:02:45.360> of

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
been enough measured that's why some of

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.120 
been enough measured that's why some of
the<00:02:45.660> creature<00:02:45.930> they<00:02:46.350> are<00:02:46.560> just<00:02:46.890> standing

the creature they are just standing

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.180 
the creature they are just standing
still<00:02:47.670> because<00:02:48.030> they<00:02:48.480> they<00:02:49.110> don't<00:02:49.350> know<00:02:49.560> where

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
still because they they don't know where

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:51.040 
still because they they don't know where
to<00:02:50.430> move

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 
to move

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:54.010 
to move
like<00:02:51.860> this<00:02:52.100> Tiger<00:02:52.580> here<00:02:53.090> better<00:02:53.390> weather<00:02:53.840> it

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.020 
like this Tiger here better weather it

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:57.460 
like this Tiger here better weather it
doesn't<00:02:54.320> move<00:02:54.470> and<00:02:54.880> there<00:02:55.880> are<00:02:56.000> no<00:02:56.270> quest<00:02:56.600> but

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
doesn't move and there are no quest but

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.530 
doesn't move and there are no quest but
I<00:02:57.500> can<00:02:57.890> anticipate<00:02:58.130> the<00:02:58.550> main<00:02:58.730> quest<00:02:59.000> will<00:02:59.330> see
