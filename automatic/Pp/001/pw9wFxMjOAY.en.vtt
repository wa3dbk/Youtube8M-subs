00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:12.370
 What's up with kids here in general? 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:15.549
 I bring a trick for infinite RPP 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:17.380
 gta 5 online for the 1.16 update 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:19.720
 and I leave you in the description 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:21.369
 what is the game to the race worth 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.160
 you have to download it with the social 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:25.510
 club meters in your game and then 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.340
 you have to see how at the beginning of 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:29.470
 video I 've put you in activities 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:30.870
 framed or something like that and there I was in 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.120
 careers 

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:35.000
 once done that you are going to need to be 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.380
 two friends here we were the coat and I 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.380
 you have to put in rally mode us 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.940
 we put three laps so the first thing that 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:43.290
 you have to do is in the first round 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.090
 if it takes, you do not have to do it 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.450
 quickly you have to take us in the 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:51.000
 first round we did about 12 and a half 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.340
 if I 'm not wrong like that 22 minutes and something 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.930
 or two minutes I think if two minutes I think 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.800
 which were then the second round 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:01.140
 we did 150 and in the third 1 140 well 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.620
 you have to always overcome the time in 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.350
 the three laps is worth because when you overcome 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:08.850
 What you are going to mark is how you should 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.720
 beat the world record then we 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.690
 give you give 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.280
 rp for every turn in my case like me 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:17.970
 I'm at level sixty-something like 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:20.850
 they fixed me they gave me 3500 for each spin 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.070
 now war that had more more more level 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.500
 that I gave him five thousand for each 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.510
 turn is something exaggerated more then the 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.380
 3,500 they give you when when the 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:32.060
 race is over 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:34.070
 the rp is only going to give it to him 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.020
 they will give the co-pilot those who do not 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.720
 you know in what is the rally mode one 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:42.110
 drive and do not see the points the points 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.490
 these control and the one that goes co-pilot 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.290
 which is what driving is not that the 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.810
 that less points than he had now 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:50.900
 drives the co-pilot is the one who goes to 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.400
 receive the rpp points then it is what 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:55.520
 bad of the trick it is worth only going to 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.990
 receive them the first one is help and then 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.030
 you have to help you to your 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.400
 friend so that for both of you 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:03.800
 you receive erp so nothing the trick is 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:06.229
 that is to download this mission to play it with 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:09.350
 your friend in rally mode and finish it 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:11.240
 always exceeded in the times and you go 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:13.459
 to have more or less between 15,000 and 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.840
 20,000 pp every five minutes so 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:17.840
 right now it's the best trick of the 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.310

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:23.170
