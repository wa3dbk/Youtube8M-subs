two sixteenth notes with six stroke

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:29.270 
two sixteenth notes with six stroke
rolls<00:01:21.270> sound<00:01:21.570> like<00:01:21.810> this<00:01:25.940> on<00:01:27.619> three<00:01:28.619> triplet

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
rolls sound like this on three triplet

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.120 
rolls sound like this on three triplet
and<00:01:29.399> triplet<00:01:29.970> I<00:01:30.149> went<00:01:30.750> right<00:01:31.259> left<00:01:31.560> left<00:01:31.710> right

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
and triplet I went right left left right

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.210 
and triplet I went right left left right
left<00:01:32.340> left<00:01:32.759> with<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.720> symbol<00:01:34.229> on<00:01:34.380> three<00:01:35.040> and

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
left left with the symbol on three and

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:40.490 
left left with the symbol on three and
end<00:01:38.330> so<00:01:39.330> here's<00:01:39.569> the<00:01:39.720> stickings<00:01:40.200> for<00:01:40.410> the

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
end so here's the stickings for the

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:52.639 
end so here's the stickings for the
first<00:01:40.770> three<00:01:41.130> groups<00:01:50.539> so<00:01:51.539> the<00:01:51.750> accents<00:01:52.500> on<00:01:52.619> the

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
first three groups so the accents on the

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.580 
first three groups so the accents on the
symbol<00:01:53.190> are<00:01:53.310> actually<00:01:53.789> one

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
symbol are actually one

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.649 
symbol are actually one
3m<00:01:56.520> and<00:01:57.170> on<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.320> last<00:01:58.619> sixteenth<00:01:59.310> note

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659 
3m and on the last sixteenth note

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:03.709 
3m and on the last sixteenth note
triplet<00:02:00.659> it's<00:02:00.950> right<00:02:01.950> right<00:02:02.429> left<00:02:02.700> right<00:02:03.420> left

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
triplet it's right right left right left

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:12.830 
triplet it's right right left right left

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
left Forge and the end gets put over to

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:14.630 
left Forge and the end gets put over to
the<00:02:12.930> ride<00:02:13.110> with<00:02:13.319> a<00:02:13.349> bass<00:02:13.560> drum<00:02:13.590> as<00:02:13.890> well<00:02:14.069> so

the ride with a bass drum as well so

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:23.330 
the ride with a bass drum as well so
here's<00:02:14.879> the<00:02:15.030> entire<00:02:15.330> pattern<00:02:22.190> now<00:02:23.190> of<00:02:23.280> course

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
here's the entire pattern now of course

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.250 
here's the entire pattern now of course
I<00:02:23.640> will<00:02:23.700> transcribe<00:02:24.239> this<00:02:24.569> on<00:02:24.750> the<00:02:24.870> board<00:02:25.080> in<00:02:25.170> a

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
I will transcribe this on the board in a

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.530 
I will transcribe this on the board in a
moment<00:02:25.620> so<00:02:26.040> here's<00:02:26.250> what<00:02:26.430> we<00:02:26.519> get<00:02:26.730> once<00:02:27.360> you're

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
moment so here's what we get once you're

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.240 
moment so here's what we get once you're
put<00:02:27.660> in<00:02:27.870> triplet<00:02:28.200> two<00:02:28.380> triplet<00:02:28.410> and<00:02:28.860> triplet

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
put in triplet two triplet and triplet

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:30.559 
put in triplet two triplet and triplet
three<00:02:29.459> triplet<00:02:29.489> and<00:02:29.910> triplet<00:02:30.329> four<00:02:30.540> triplet

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 
three triplet and triplet four triplet

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:44.440 
three triplet and triplet four triplet
triplet

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.820 

now<00:02:45.450> of<00:02:45.540> course<00:02:45.599> you<00:02:45.959> can<00:02:46.110> apply<00:02:46.290> this<00:02:46.409> to

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
now of course you can apply this to

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.100 
now of course you can apply this to
symbols<00:02:47.400> around<00:02:47.700> the<00:02:48.299> set<00:02:48.599> on<00:02:48.750> the<00:02:48.870> Tom's

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
symbols around the set on the Tom's

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.890 
symbols around the set on the Tom's
create<00:02:49.920> your<00:02:50.069> own<00:02:50.129> ideas<00:02:50.640> a<00:02:50.819> six-stroke<00:02:51.629> role

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
create your own ideas a six-stroke role

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.930 
create your own ideas a six-stroke role
is<00:02:52.080> a<00:02:52.110> great<00:02:52.349> rhythm<00:02:52.530> to<00:02:52.739> play<00:02:52.950> on<00:02:53.190> the<00:02:53.610> three<00:02:53.909> I

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
is a great rhythm to play on the three I

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.970 
is a great rhythm to play on the three I
just<00:02:54.299> changes<00:02:54.780> stickings<00:02:55.170> a<00:02:55.290> little<00:02:55.500> bit<00:02:55.590> so

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
just changes stickings a little bit so

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.440 
just changes stickings a little bit so
let's<00:02:56.099> go<00:02:56.190> back<00:02:56.370> to<00:02:56.519> the<00:02:56.610> performance<00:02:57.180> video

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
let's go back to the performance video

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:58.280 
let's go back to the performance video
and<00:02:57.659> then<00:02:57.780> we'll<00:02:57.900> check<00:02:58.080> out<00:02:58.260> the

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
and then we'll check out the

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:29.270 
and then we'll check out the
transcription

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.590 

alright<00:03:30.280> so<00:03:30.460> there<00:03:30.670> you<00:03:30.820> go<00:03:30.850> a<00:03:30.970> drum<00:03:31.330> fill

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:31.600 
alright so there you go a drum fill

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.510 
alright so there you go a drum fill
using<00:03:32.020> a<00:03:32.080> six-stroke<00:03:32.650> roll<00:03:32.950> at<00:03:33.160> a<00:03:33.190> bit<00:03:33.370> of<00:03:33.400> a

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:33.520 
using a six-stroke roll at a bit of a

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.820 
using a six-stroke roll at a bit of a
sticking<00:03:34.180> change<00:03:34.510> on<00:03:34.780> three<00:03:35.080> triplet<00:03:35.530> triplet

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:35.830 
sticking change on three triplet triplet

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:38.160 
sticking change on three triplet triplet
again<00:03:36.610> a<00:03:36.640> six-stroke<00:03:37.180> roll<00:03:37.420> is<00:03:37.570> a<00:03:37.600> common

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.170 
again a six-stroke roll is a common

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.380 
again a six-stroke roll is a common
rudiment<00:03:38.650> to<00:03:38.740> use<00:03:38.950> around<00:03:39.220> the<00:03:39.370> set<00:03:39.730> and<00:03:39.940> there

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390 
rudiment to use around the set and there

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:42.060 
rudiment to use around the set and there
are<00:03:40.450> variety<00:03:41.050> of<00:03:41.080> stickings<00:03:41.620> that<00:03:41.800> you<00:03:41.920> can

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:42.070 
are variety of stickings that you can

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:44.520 
are variety of stickings that you can
