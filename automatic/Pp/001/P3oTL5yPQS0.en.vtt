00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:26.539
 Programming robots that sounds a bit crazy at the beginning 

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:30.179
 but it is part of the mechatronics training 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.460
 Ronny k is the specialist for mechanics and me at Mercedes Benz 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:38.990
 electronics 

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:42.630
 they ensure that the complex machinery and equipment in production 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:44.890
 Get going and stay in gear 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.200
 but can also be repaired 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.300
 For this later specialist work, the trainees learn the basics of the manual 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.350
 and metal machining 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.120
 assemble complete assemblies and machines 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:02.060
 Apply the electrical engineering electronics and control technology CNC programming 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:05.330
 of controllers targeted troubleshooting of chained 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.110
 Machinery and equipment 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.110
 and all that for our technologically advanced vehicles 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:13.780
 That's why the training as a mechatronics engineer is so versatile 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.790
 The apprentices learn directly from the experts on the same machines 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.540
 also be used in production 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.190
 The motto is learning always derives from work 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.160
 so everyone gets the most out of the challenges later on 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.160
 Professional life prepared 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.900
 behind every practice plug theory and that is to a great extent in the 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.890
 Vocational school mediates 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.640
 so that the theory of practice corresponds to the manufacturing works Mercedes 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.640
 Benz closely cooperates with the school facilities 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.539
 In this way, all areas of training interact optimally 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.370
 knowledge is important 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:58.300
 but equally important to us is a good fellowship with each other 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.380
 creates an atmosphere where everyone can optimally develop their skills 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.440
 can 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.590
 Learning together as a team means growing together 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.749
 That's why we call for more work-life balance through further offers 

00:02:17.899 --> 00:02:22.409
 because Mercedes Benz works means parts of a global acting company 

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:23.069
 his 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:26.069
 that offers many opportunities 

00:02:26.749 --> 00:02:30.029
 already in the training you can get around and other stations and 

00:02:30.029 --> 00:02:31.469
 Get to know companies 

00:02:31.469 --> 00:02:34.859
 so collects too early and very different experiences and how 

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:38.099
 Seriously know the structure of the company 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:41.310
 At the end of the three-and-a-half-year training, the state is 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.389
 recognized final exam 

00:02:43.389 --> 00:02:45.899
 the ticket to professional life 

00:02:45.899 --> 00:02:49.930
 Anyone who is in training through good performance can afford his career 

00:02:49.929 --> 00:02:51.859
 Of course, start directly with us 

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:53.269
 that is the goal 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:57.150
 because competent and efficient young employees are the main contributors 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:58.909
 Pillars of the future 

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:02.159
 and even after the training is not final stop because of the cliffs 

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:05.680
 numerous continuing education programs development opportunities at the 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.739
 the whole world 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:11.319
 inquire about training opportunities at Mercedes 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:13.230
 Benz your future starts now
