00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
still weakening and so in my opinion

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.370 
still weakening and so in my opinion
we've<00:01:55.340> reached<00:01:55.610> probably<00:01:56.330> the<00:01:56.480> bottom<00:01:56.960> of<00:01:57.140> the

valley for the time being but I doubt

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.610

that<00:02:01.430> we<00:02:01.760> will<00:02:01.940> climb<00:02:02.300> out<00:02:02.780> of<00:02:02.810> the<00:02:03.260> slump

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:03.620 
that we will climb out of the slump

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:08.020 
that we will climb out of the slump
anytime<00:02:04.340> soon<00:02:04.700> and<00:02:05.000> we<00:02:05.720> have<00:02:05.900> to<00:02:06.080> put<00:02:06.320> a<00:02:07.030> bottom

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
anytime soon and we have to put a bottom

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.029 
anytime soon and we have to put a bottom
