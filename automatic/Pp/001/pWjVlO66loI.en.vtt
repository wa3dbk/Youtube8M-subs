00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:04.629
 pigs 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:08.919

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:11.829
 so on and also it is impossible to give food with 

00:03:08.919 --> 00:03:15.669
 desk man and naturally 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:18.209

 once or twice a week 

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:48.400
 that we put there we put the granules 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:52.780
 desirable because they absorb well 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:54.729
 urine and top and nail files but depending on how 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.719
