00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:08.259
 Well today I'm going to teach you how to make a 

00:00:04.089 --> 00:00:09.910
 necklace with silicone as it is made 

00:00:08.259 --> 00:00:12.549
 silicone base is very easy to make 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:14.160
 I 'll show you the materials that 

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:18.689
 you need 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:22.470
 You need a mold like this below you 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:25.490
 I'm going to leave the measurements does not have to be 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:28.600
 perfect is simply a mold 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:32.439
 you also need 

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:35.610
 some silicone rods silicone 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:38.740
 hot a leaf 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:42.420
 butter and that 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:47.089
 also obviously the gun 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.089
 and here is the video 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:55.420
 good to start we will place the 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:57.969
 butter leaf on 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.649
 our mold is going to be something super 

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:03.570
 simple I think that within the 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:03.570
 materials I did not mention you need 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.990
 one type of oil 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:14.770
 since we are going to spray it on the sheet 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:17.650
 of butter for the moment in which 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.790
 let's make the silicone easier to 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.880
 take off 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:23.860
 our necklace we are going to need then a 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:28.300
 little oil nothing else can be 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:33.510
 this one that is extra virgin or any 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:33.510
 I show you how you have to do it 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.770
 good as I had told you 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:41.270
 first step is to put the sheet on 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:45.200
 our mold the second is to spread 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:49.690
 our mold with oil 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:52.040
 well after having our 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:55.760
 mold 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:57.270
 smeared with oil let's proceed with the 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.909
 silicone 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.579
 do just what is in the world 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:06.509
 on the stripes we are going to take the 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:09.799
 silicone and let's wait here and so 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.799
 here we will see how it is done 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:31.129
 it's something completely is super very 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.129
 simple a baby 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:36.140
 it's super simple 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:44.600
 after having reigned the raisins 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:44.600
 by circles 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:49.960
 It is very easy 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.960
 it's super simple 

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:59.430
 when you already have a post made by the 

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:01.650
 figure made it is necessary to repair it 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:05.580
 many times do not worry if you do not 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:09.410
 it is perfect because in the end 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.410
 you can run with a scissor 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:20.940
 well you can then remove the mold and 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:22.770
 continue working on them 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:25.410
 I do not think I'm telling you , but it's 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:28.800
 important that you work 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:31.860
 several layers of silicone but it 's like that 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:36.000
 as it is already ending and in the end, as 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:38.790
 he reads you molds your voice to me to my 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.670
 own style as we go like this the weeks 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:43.090
 as corrugated I think it has a 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:47.110
 more appearance 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:49.840
 more beautiful at the end because of aesthetics and 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:55.770
 for presentation we can throw several 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:59.700
 coatings of paint or varnish varnish 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:01.770
 d-nails is super cool later 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:04.980
 I show you 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:08.040
 well more or less this is work 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:09.540
 Well the base do not be scared that if it does not go 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:13.170
 to stay 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:16.350
 Now what is missing is to put it to dry 10 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:17.970
 to 15 minutes and then we proceed to 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:21.020
 correct those mistakes that we do not 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.020
 like and squeeze 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:31.600
 well that's how our work has been in 

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:33.610
 at the base in your base and now we're going 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:37.020
 to proceed to correct those errors 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:39.330
 that we do not like 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:44.370
 well up to this point I have 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:47.030
 perfected to my liking is perfect 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:50.500
 and now I 'm going to show you how you can 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:54.380
 paint it to be perfect 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:56.480
 I have selected these two colors 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:05:01.090
 and gold 

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:01.090
 and black that can help me a lot 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:08.770
 at this time of work should be very 

00:05:05.069 --> 00:05:11.620
 Perfectionist think that is the part I 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:14.169
 most important of top so that's the 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:17.110
 appearance that your work will acquire 

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:20.820
 I have decided to put him black in the 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:23.360
 edges and gold in the center 

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:26.900
 well now I will proceed 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:30.230
 to paint with gold 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:33.080
 and that is how it is going 

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:34.930
 since finished it is important to leave it 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:37.780
 dry off 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:40.840
 during a period of time then that you 

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:43.060
 consider it necessary and the end for 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:44.300
 finish something similar can be achieved 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:46.220
 to that 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:49.770
 it's a chain 

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:52.970
 completely simple 

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:52.970
 it's not harder to get 

00:05:53.260 --> 00:06:00.100
 and if we are going to shelter her 

00:05:55.580 --> 00:06:03.030
 it's very easy, let's see in this part 

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:07.310
 of the necklace 

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:07.310
 and we're going to stick it with silicone 

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:14.270
 finally good it is how it has been 

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:16.940
 our necklace seems like a 

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:18.900
 pretty different style I know 

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:22.050
 outdated 

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:24.540
 and very easy to do very economical if you 

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:27.389
