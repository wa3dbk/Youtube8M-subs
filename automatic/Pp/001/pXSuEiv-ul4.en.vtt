00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:06.970
 hello today let's see how to knit the knit 

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:09.190
 high double or double vareta 

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:12.580
 to start on all laps 

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:16.949
 we always want you 4 chain stitches 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:20.619
 that will give us the necessary height 3 and 4 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.600
 once we knitted we skipped them 1 2 3 and 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:24.150
 4 and we will have to insert the needle in 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.550
 this point 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:30.869
 before inserting the needle we will pass 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:33.660
 2 loops on the needle if you remember 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.910
 in the video that we saw from the high point 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.550
 brother the point vareta was passing a 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:42.300
 single loop at double high point or 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.670
 double crochet let's pass 2 loops one 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.540
 once past the loops we insert the 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.540
 needle in the hole 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.450
 we passed the thread we have 4 points left and 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.670
 what we have to do now is go 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:01.129
 closing two by two 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.739
 We took a thread and closed the first two 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:07.010
 we take a thread, we close the two again 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:10.640
 first and so on until we have a 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:13.610
 only point on the needle we pass again 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:16.420
 two loops we insert the needle into the 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.420
 next hole 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:25.670
 and we repeat the process goes showing 

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:29.200
 two in two until we have a single 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:34.899
 point we do two loops again 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.899
 insert the crochet in the hole 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:48.430
 and so 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.430
 let's knit all the stitches 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:15.680
 first we closed 2 then we closed 32 and 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:20.890
 in the end we are left with a single point 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.890
 we passed 2 loops all the time the same 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:30.800
 and it looks very nice is a point that has 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.800
 a lot of height 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:51.210
 You see how it's going to be once we've 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.680
 we have reached the end 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:58.030
 simply because we turn the 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:03:00.730
 woven and we return again to weave 4 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:05.310
 Chain stitches to give height 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.310
 2 3 and 4 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:12.080
 the same thing happened double loop and if you 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:13.790
 you fix when weaving the first round has 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.830
 stayed as a kind of chain for 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:19.840
 the top part what we have to 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:19.840
 do now is catch 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.340
 the complete chain 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:29.330
 jumping the 24 points that we have brought 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.330
 now of chain 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:39.620
 and the same double loop if you look 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.620
 Well, the next one 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.459
 donado lazada and the same 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:02.769
 You see, not staying 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:08.200
 thank you for visiting us until later
