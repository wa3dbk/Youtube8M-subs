activity it gets to be more real I
figured<00:02:44.340> out<00:02:44.459> that<00:02:44.700> it<00:02:44.820> isn't<00:02:45.150> but<00:02:45.329> that's

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:45.810 
figured out that it isn't but that's

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.930 
figured out that it isn't but that's
simple<00:02:46.230> to<00:02:46.260> define<00:02:46.739> what<00:02:47.040> races<00:02:47.579> and<00:02:47.820> what
