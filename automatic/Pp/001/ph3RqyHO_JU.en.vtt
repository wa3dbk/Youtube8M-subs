tall's friendly and it's all rewarding
but<00:01:23.909> you<00:01:24.030> consider<00:01:24.450> actual<00:01:24.840> training<00:01:25.290> you

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
but you consider actual training you

but you consider actual training you
mean<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.619> actual<00:01:25.860> police<00:01:26.100> training<00:01:26.430> yes

right<00:01:27.240> that<00:01:27.420> would<00:01:27.479> be<00:01:27.630> in<00:01:28.229> a<00:01:28.350> year's<00:01:28.590> time

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:29.299 
right that would be in a year's time

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:31.190 
right that would be in a year's time
probably<00:01:30.299> when<00:01:30.390> they're<00:01:30.539> about<00:01:30.630> 14<00:01:31.049> months

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
probably when they're about 14 months

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
basics anyway they'll then come into

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:36.950 
basics anyway they'll then come into
here<00:01:35.789> and<00:01:36.000> we'll<00:01:36.119> check<00:01:36.299> them<00:01:36.450> on<00:01:36.570> I'll<00:01:36.840> be

were bringing them in four to eight to
twelve<00:01:41.609> weeks<00:01:41.700> and<00:01:42.149> then<00:01:43.049> they'll<00:01:43.170> start

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
twelve weeks and then they'll start

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.200 
twelve weeks and then they'll start

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
again it's all very very much force free

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.950 
again it's all very very much force free
training<00:01:47.579> and<00:01:47.670> we<00:01:47.759> teach<00:01:47.969> them<00:01:48.119> how<00:01:48.270> how<00:01:48.810> they

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
training and we teach them how how they

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.389 
training and we teach them how how they
get<00:01:49.109> rewarded<00:01:49.259> for<00:01:49.740> doing<00:01:49.799> certain<00:01:50.219> exercises

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
and how the control comes into it they

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.910 
and how the control comes into it they
do<00:01:54.179> things<00:01:54.659> when<00:01:54.840> we<00:01:55.020> tell<00:01:55.289> them<00:01:55.439> to<00:01:55.649> rather

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
do things when we tell them to rather

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.679 
do things when we tell them to rather
than<00:01:56.130> when<00:01:56.280> they<00:01:56.460> want<00:01:56.700> to<00:01:56.820> decide<00:01:57.240> to<00:01:57.420> do<00:01:57.539> it

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
than when they want to decide to do it

and we have to teach them that the right

way and wrong ways of doing things so

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.950

it's<00:02:05.429> all<00:02:05.609> very<00:02:05.880> gently<00:02:06.539> brought<00:02:06.749> on

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
it's all very gently brought on

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.109 
it's all very gently brought on
throughout<00:02:07.259> the<00:02:07.439> next<00:02:07.590> year<00:02:07.710> and<00:02:07.950> a<00:02:08.039> bit<00:02:08.190> but

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
throughout the next year and a bit but

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.609 
throughout the next year and a bit but
the<00:02:09.240> next<00:02:09.450> step<00:02:09.600> with<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:10.020> two<00:02:10.170> we've<00:02:10.380> got<00:02:10.410> at

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
the next step with the two we've got at

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.059 
the next step with the two we've got at
the<00:02:10.679> moment<00:02:10.910> is<00:02:12.440> I'm<00:02:13.440> actually<00:02:13.620> going<00:02:13.860> to<00:02:13.920> give

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
the moment is I'm actually going to give

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:16.250 
the moment is I'm actually going to give
one<00:02:14.190> of<00:02:14.310> the<00:02:14.370> dogs<00:02:14.550> to<00:02:14.730> another<00:02:14.940> handler<00:02:15.260> as

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
one of the dogs to another handler as

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.720 
one of the dogs to another handler as
soon<00:02:16.410> as<00:02:16.530> we<00:02:16.620> can<00:02:16.740> identify<00:02:16.890> who's<00:02:17.430> going<00:02:17.670> to

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
soon as we can identify who's going to

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.910 
soon as we can identify who's going to
take<00:02:17.850> him<00:02:18.060> on<00:02:18.210> because<00:02:18.780> it's<00:02:19.110> far<00:02:19.380> easier<00:02:19.410> to

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
take him on because it's far easier to

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.559 
take him on because it's far easier to
train<00:02:20.190> one<00:02:20.430> dog<00:02:20.670> than<00:02:20.940> another<00:02:21.180> if<00:02:21.300> you've<00:02:21.420> got

00:02:21.559 --> 00:02:21.569 
train one dog than another if you've got

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:23.540 
train one dog than another if you've got
two<00:02:21.750> dogs<00:02:22.020> at<00:02:22.200> home<00:02:22.410> and<00:02:22.950> one's<00:02:23.190> doing

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
two dogs at home and one's doing

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.000 
two dogs at home and one's doing
something<00:02:23.910> slightly<00:02:24.060> wrong<00:02:24.530> all<00:02:25.530> you<00:02:25.710> need<00:02:25.860> is

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
something slightly wrong all you need is

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.250 
something slightly wrong all you need is
your<00:02:26.130> stop<00:02:26.970> doing<00:02:27.300> that<00:02:27.480> but<00:02:27.930> neither<00:02:28.080> one

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
your stop doing that but neither one

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:29.330 
your stop doing that but neither one
might<00:02:28.440> be<00:02:28.560> actually<00:02:28.770> doing<00:02:28.830> something<00:02:29.100> it's

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
might be actually doing something it's

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:30.860 
might be actually doing something it's
supposed<00:02:29.640> to<00:02:29.760> be<00:02:29.880> do<00:02:30.000> and<00:02:30.150> it's<00:02:30.270> think<00:02:30.450> I've

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
supposed to be do and it's think I've

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.990 
supposed to be do and it's think I've
done<00:02:31.290> something<00:02:31.650> wrong<00:02:31.830> so<00:02:32.400> we<00:02:32.550> need<00:02:32.730> to<00:02:32.880> get

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
done something wrong so we need to get

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.759 
done something wrong so we need to get
them<00:02:33.180> apart<00:02:33.420> really<00:02:33.720> there<00:02:34.379> so<00:02:34.530> we<00:02:34.650> can

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:34.769 
them apart really there so we can

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:37.009 
them apart really there so we can
concentrate<00:02:34.980> on<00:02:35.250> the<00:02:35.370> one<00:02:35.580> dog<00:02:35.930> that<00:02:36.930> we

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:37.019 
concentrate on the one dog that we

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:39.470 
concentrate on the one dog that we
taught<00:02:37.230> all<00:02:37.500> the<00:02:37.590> basic<00:02:37.980> commands<00:02:38.340> the<00:02:39.330> main
