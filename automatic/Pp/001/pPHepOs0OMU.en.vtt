okay<00:00:24.800> now<00:00:25.160> what<00:00:25.369> we've<00:00:25.580> done<00:00:25.820> is<00:00:26.330> we've<00:00:26.539> taken

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:26.570 
okay now what we've done is we've taken

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:28.330 
okay now what we've done is we've taken
the<00:00:26.990> properties<00:00:27.529> of<00:00:27.560> this<00:00:27.769> material<00:00:27.980> and

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:28.340 
the properties of this material and

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:29.529 
the properties of this material and
combined<00:00:28.699> it<00:00:28.820> with<00:00:28.880> something<00:00:29.090> that<00:00:29.240> will

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:29.539 
combined it with something that will

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:31.540 
combined it with something that will
open<00:00:29.840> your<00:00:29.930> blood<00:00:30.380> vessels<00:00:30.410> bring<00:00:31.279> oxygen

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:31.550 
open your blood vessels bring oxygen

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.939 
open your blood vessels bring oxygen
into<00:00:32.090> the<00:00:32.119> brain<00:00:32.390> those<00:00:32.900> enzymes<00:00:33.350> in<00:00:33.680> quick

00:00:33.939 --> 00:00:33.949 
into the brain those enzymes in quick

00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:36.460 
into the brain those enzymes in quick
and<00:00:34.190> tasty<00:00:34.629> but<00:00:35.629> it's<00:00:35.750> still<00:00:35.930> a<00:00:35.989> shoot<00:00:36.199> or<00:00:36.320> not

the ginger to settle and then the

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.250 
the ginger to settle and then the
oxygenation<00:01:48.270> takes<00:01:48.870> about<00:01:49.020> five<00:01:49.230> minutes

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:49.260 
oxygenation takes about five minutes

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.460

this brown colors precursor to some

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.590 
this brown colors precursor to some

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:04.650 
different things that are balancing that

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:06.410 
different things that are balancing that
we<00:02:04.800> would<00:02:04.950> naturally<00:02:05.310> get<00:02:05.400> reading<00:02:05.850> a<00:02:06.060> rich

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
we would naturally get reading a rich

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.530 
we would naturally get reading a rich
soil<00:02:07.260> based<00:02:07.619> product<00:02:08.610> that's<00:02:08.850> organic<00:02:09.390> and

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:09.540 
soil based product that's organic and

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:11.600 
soil based product that's organic and
live<00:02:09.750> and<00:02:10.020> all<00:02:10.260> the<00:02:10.530> minerals<00:02:10.679> as<00:02:11.010> in<00:02:11.160> soil<00:02:11.459> we

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
live and all the minerals as in soil we

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.210 
live and all the minerals as in soil we
be<00:02:11.730> giving<00:02:11.850> this<00:02:12.090> automatically<00:02:12.810> and<00:02:13.500> so<00:02:14.070> what

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
be giving this automatically and so what

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:15.949 
be giving this automatically and so what
we<00:02:14.340> do<00:02:14.520> in<00:02:14.700> our<00:02:14.760> modern<00:02:15.209> world<00:02:15.480> when<00:02:15.720> we<00:02:15.810> have

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
we do in our modern world when we have

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:17.780 
we do in our modern world when we have
less<00:02:16.170> than<00:02:16.200> that<00:02:16.470> as<00:02:16.650> we<00:02:16.770> bring<00:02:17.010> in<00:02:17.160> fill<00:02:17.580> it<00:02:17.700> in

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
less than that as we bring in fill it in

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.600 
less than that as we bring in fill it in
with<00:02:17.880> a<00:02:18.000> most<00:02:18.240> potent<00:02:18.890> mortar<00:02:19.890> between<00:02:20.190> those

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
with a most potent mortar between those

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.100 
with a most potent mortar between those
bricks<00:02:20.970> of<00:02:21.090> whatever<00:02:21.330> else<00:02:21.540> were<00:02:21.690> horny<00:02:21.990> early

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
bricks of whatever else were horny early

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.590 
bricks of whatever else were horny early
so<00:02:22.740> that<00:02:22.770> we've<00:02:22.950> got<00:02:23.370> something<00:02:24.120> that<00:02:24.390> we<00:02:24.480> can

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
so that we've got something that we can

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.630 
so that we've got something that we can
build<00:02:24.750> a<00:02:24.900> real<00:02:25.080> body<00:02:25.350> on<00:02:25.560> we<00:02:26.340> all<00:02:26.459> have

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
build a real body on we all have

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.600 
build a real body on we all have
superhero<00:02:27.180> capacities<00:02:28.110> some<00:02:29.070> are<00:02:29.220> government

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
superhero capacities some are government

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.490 
superhero capacities some are government
like<00:02:29.730> a<00:02:29.760> sea<00:02:30.060> but<00:02:30.360> they<00:02:30.510> are<00:02:30.630> born<00:02:30.900> to<00:02:31.110> sprout

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
like a sea but they are born to sprout

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.460 
like a sea but they are born to sprout
and<00:02:31.650> they're<00:02:31.860> born<00:02:32.160> to<00:02:33.090> be<00:02:33.270> blooming<00:02:33.690> if

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
and they're born to be blooming if

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.630 
and they're born to be blooming if
you're<00:02:34.800> an<00:02:35.010> acorn<00:02:35.400> your<00:02:35.670> meeting

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
you're an acorn your meeting

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.760 
you're an acorn your meeting
an<00:02:36.819> oak<00:02:36.970> tree<00:02:37.000> so<00:02:37.870> I'm<00:02:37.990> suggesting<00:02:38.170> that<00:02:38.740> we

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 
an oak tree so I'm suggesting that we

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:40.680 
an oak tree so I'm suggesting that we
feel<00:02:39.220> will<00:02:39.370> ever<00:02:39.550> given<00:02:40.000> the<00:02:40.060> right<00:02:40.180> nutrients

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
feel will ever given the right nutrients

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.960 
feel will ever given the right nutrients
that<00:02:40.870> when<00:02:41.050> we<00:02:41.170> are<00:02:41.319> to<00:02:41.620> that<00:02:41.890> core<00:02:42.520> essence<00:02:42.880> of

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
that when we are to that core essence of

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:44.820 
that when we are to that core essence of
who<00:02:43.060> we<00:02:43.090> are<00:02:43.209> gets<00:02:43.780> to<00:02:43.930> bloom<00:02:44.170> into<00:02:44.470> the<00:02:44.650> world

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:44.830 
who we are gets to bloom into the world

everything<00:03:26.350> about<00:03:26.590> this<00:03:26.950> product<00:03:27.370> but

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:27.550 
everything about this product but

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:29.220 
everything about this product but
there's<00:03:27.790> a<00:03:27.910> little<00:03:28.090> bit<00:03:28.330> too<00:03:28.570> much<00:03:28.720> heat<00:03:29.019> that

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
there's a little bit too much heat that

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.470 
there's a little bit too much heat that
is<00:03:29.530> very<00:03:30.010> specific<00:03:30.250> in<00:03:30.730> its<00:03:30.820> action<00:03:31.239> and<00:03:31.360> its

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
is very specific in its action and its

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.870 
is very specific in its action and its
attention<00:03:32.050> but<00:03:32.230> it<00:03:32.350> for<00:03:32.800> you<00:03:32.950> a<00:03:32.980> more<00:03:33.370> out<00:03:33.850> of

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
attention but it for you a more out of

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.900 
attention but it for you a more out of
balance<00:03:34.470> in<00:03:35.470> a<00:03:35.530> place<00:03:35.769> where<00:03:36.070> that<00:03:36.670> he

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
balance in a place where that he

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.449 
balance in a place where that he
represents<00:03:37.180> out<00:03:38.170> of<00:03:38.500> kilter<00:03:38.800> even<00:03:39.250> more

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459 
represents out of kilter even more

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:41.610 
represents out of kilter even more
energy<00:03:39.670> like<00:03:40.180> if<00:03:40.570> your<00:03:40.840> arm<00:03:41.049> if<00:03:41.440> you're
