high-resolution

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:11.490 
high-resolution
to<00:02:10.149> be<00:02:10.240> released<00:02:10.600> with<00:02:10.990> a<00:02:11.020> next-generation

iphone<00:02:11.920> but<00:02:12.460> people<00:02:13.090> forget<00:02:13.120> that<00:02:13.780> Apple

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
iphone but people forget that Apple

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.590
