you<00:04:03.160> know<00:04:03.310> I<00:04:03.340> think<00:04:03.610> I<00:04:04.300> think<00:04:05.340> one<00:04:06.340> thing

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:06.370 
you know I think I think one thing

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:08.699 
you know I think I think one thing
that's<00:04:06.610> consistent<00:04:07.360> in<00:04:07.480> swimming<00:04:07.750> is<00:04:08.050> I<00:04:08.410> think

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:08.709 
that's consistent in swimming is I think
