all<00:00:07.380> right<00:00:07.529> now<00:00:07.650> the<00:00:07.710> plant<00:00:08.040> that<00:00:08.220> I<00:00:08.309> have<00:00:08.520> in

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
all right now the plant that I have in

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:10.070 
all right now the plant that I have in
front<00:00:08.850> of<00:00:08.940> me<00:00:09.000> here<00:00:09.210> this<00:00:09.360> is<00:00:09.510> called<00:00:09.780> Harry

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
front of me here this is called Harry

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.450 
front of me here this is called Harry
laughter's<00:00:10.440> walking<00:00:10.920> stick

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
laughter's walking stick

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:12.920 
laughter's walking stick
Harry<00:00:11.879> laughter's<00:00:12.180> walking<00:00:12.600> stick<00:00:12.780> is

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:12.930 
Harry laughter's walking stick is

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:14.060 
Harry laughter's walking stick is
probably<00:00:13.290> one<00:00:13.469> of<00:00:13.500> the<00:00:13.650> most<00:00:13.830> interesting

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
probably one of the most interesting

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.179 
probably one of the most interesting
plants<00:00:14.760> in<00:00:14.880> the<00:00:15.179> plant<00:00:15.450> kingdom<00:00:15.950> because<00:00:16.950> that

00:00:17.179 --> 00:00:17.189 
plants in the plant kingdom because that

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:19.100 
plants in the plant kingdom because that
all<00:00:17.430> the<00:00:17.640> new<00:00:17.820> growth<00:00:18.000> comes<00:00:18.450> out<00:00:18.689> and<00:00:18.930> it

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:19.110 
all the new growth comes out and it

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:22.519 
all the new growth comes out and it
tends<00:00:19.410> to<00:00:19.560> to<00:00:20.250> twist<00:00:20.700> like<00:00:21.480> a<00:00:21.540> pig's<00:00:21.900> tail<00:00:22.020> and

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
tends to to twist like a pig's tail and

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.529 
tends to to twist like a pig's tail and
you<00:00:23.190> can<00:00:23.369> see<00:00:23.609> it's<00:00:23.789> kind<00:00:23.970> of<00:00:24.029> hard<00:00:24.270> to<00:00:24.330> see

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
you can see it's kind of hard to see

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.320 
you can see it's kind of hard to see
what<00:00:24.660> the<00:00:24.690> leaves<00:00:24.960> on<00:00:25.170> it<00:00:25.350> here<00:00:25.850> I'll<00:00:26.850> pick<00:00:27.300> a

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
what the leaves on it here I'll pick a

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.670 
what the leaves on it here I'll pick a
couple<00:00:27.689> these<00:00:27.750> off<00:00:27.990> so<00:00:28.140> we<00:00:28.260> can<00:00:28.380> actually<00:00:28.560> see

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:30.680 
couple these off so we can actually see

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.259 
couple these off so we can actually see
oops<00:00:31.680> I<00:00:31.920> broke<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.220> branch<00:00:32.400> off<00:00:32.699> but<00:00:32.910> anyway

00:00:33.259 --> 00:00:33.269 
oops I broke the branch off but anyway

00:00:33.269 --> 00:00:37.400 
oops I broke the branch off but anyway
you<00:00:33.330> can<00:00:33.600> see<00:00:33.840> there<00:00:34.110> that<00:00:36.019> it<00:00:37.019> there's<00:00:37.320> a

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
you can see there that it there's a

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.229 
you can see there that it there's a
tendency<00:00:37.949> for<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.160> plant<00:00:38.430> to<00:00:38.610> to<00:00:39.000> just

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
tendency for the plant to to just

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.479 
tendency for the plant to to just
completely<00:00:39.630> curl<00:00:40.200> and<00:00:40.500> matter<00:00:41.070> of<00:00:41.100> fact<00:00:41.160> on

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
completely curl and matter of fact on

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.060 
completely curl and matter of fact on
this<00:00:41.670> one<00:00:41.880> you<00:00:42.840> can<00:00:42.870> see<00:00:43.260> it<00:00:43.380> here<00:00:43.710> this<00:00:43.860> one

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
this one you can see it here this one

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.790 
this one you can see it here this one
has<00:00:44.160> got<00:00:44.309> a<00:00:44.370> very<00:00:44.760> interesting<00:00:45.350> jagged<00:00:46.350> point

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
has got a very interesting jagged point

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.290 
has got a very interesting jagged point
so<00:00:46.950> anyway<00:00:47.280> this<00:00:47.460> plant<00:00:47.850> tends<00:00:48.660> to<00:00:48.870> grow<00:00:50.300> in

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
so anyway this plant tends to grow in

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.510 
so anyway this plant tends to grow in
kind<00:00:51.899> of<00:00:51.989> an<00:00:52.110> erratic<00:00:52.649> pattern<00:00:53.129> now<00:00:53.309> these

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
kind of an erratic pattern now these

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.880 
kind of an erratic pattern now these
usually<00:00:54.360> are<00:00:54.719> growing<00:00:54.989> in<00:00:55.200> the<00:00:55.289> shrub<00:00:55.559> form

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
usually are growing in the shrub form

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.590 
usually are growing in the shrub form
like<00:00:56.070> I<00:00:56.190> have<00:00:56.399> right<00:00:56.640> here<00:00:56.670> and<00:00:57.120> they're

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
like I have right here and they're

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.270 
like I have right here and they're
growing<00:00:57.780> multi<00:00:58.289> stem<00:00:58.590> now<00:00:58.770> one<00:00:58.920> of<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.070> things

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
growing multi stem now one of the things

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.400 
growing multi stem now one of the things
that<00:00:59.399> you<00:00:59.489> have<00:00:59.670> to<00:00:59.820> be<00:00:59.969> aware<00:01:00.180> of<00:01:00.410> oftentimes

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
that you have to be aware of oftentimes

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.869 
that you have to be aware of oftentimes
these<00:01:01.649> are<00:01:01.710> grafted<00:01:02.250> sometimes<00:01:02.670> they're

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
these are grafted sometimes they're

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.430 
these are grafted sometimes they're
growing<00:01:03.120> on<00:01:03.239> their<00:01:03.420> own<00:01:03.600> roots<00:01:03.960> and<00:01:04.199> if<00:01:04.289> that's

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:04.440 
growing on their own roots and if that's

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.529 
growing on their own roots and if that's
the<00:01:04.619> case<00:01:04.739> then<00:01:05.580> you're<00:01:05.759> very<00:01:05.940> lucky<00:01:06.390> because

00:01:06.529 --> 00:01:06.539 
the case then you're very lucky because

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:08.719 
the case then you're very lucky because
you<00:01:06.869> won't<00:01:06.990> get<00:01:07.229> suckers<00:01:07.680> but<00:01:08.250> a<00:01:08.310> lot<00:01:08.460> of<00:01:08.490> times

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
you won't get suckers but a lot of times

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.700 
you won't get suckers but a lot of times
they're<00:01:08.910> grafted<00:01:09.360> onto<00:01:09.509> a<00:01:09.720> type<00:01:10.049> of<00:01:10.080> filbert

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
they're grafted onto a type of filbert

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.670 
they're grafted onto a type of filbert
and<00:01:10.890> you'll<00:01:11.549> get<00:01:12.229> suckers<00:01:13.229> from<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.500> root

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
and you'll get suckers from the root

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.500 
and you'll get suckers from the root
stock<00:01:13.950> that<00:01:14.189> grow<00:01:14.490> just<00:01:14.700> straight<00:01:15.210> as<00:01:15.360> an

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:15.510 
stock that grow just straight as an

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.350 
stock that grow just straight as an
arrow<00:01:15.659> up<00:01:16.049> through<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:16.740> plant<00:01:17.070> and<00:01:17.939> if

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
arrow up through the plant and if

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.789 
arrow up through the plant and if
they're<00:01:18.510> allowed<00:01:18.720> to<00:01:18.780> grow<00:01:19.170> they<00:01:19.770> will

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
they're allowed to grow they will

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.770 
they're allowed to grow they will
totally<00:01:20.220> destroy<00:01:20.549> and<00:01:21.060> detract<00:01:21.450> from<00:01:21.570> the

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
totally destroy and detract from the

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.200 
totally destroy and detract from the
plant<00:01:22.140> so<00:01:22.439> that's<00:01:23.400> something<00:01:23.729> you<00:01:23.850> don't<00:01:24.030> want

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
plant so that's something you don't want

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.719 
plant so that's something you don't want
to<00:01:24.270> happen<00:01:24.650> now<00:01:25.650> basically<00:01:25.890> all<00:01:26.280> I'm<00:01:26.549> going<00:01:26.670> to

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
to happen now basically all I'm going to

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.609 
to happen now basically all I'm going to
do<00:01:26.850> in<00:01:27.000> this<00:01:27.119> one<00:01:27.360> is<00:01:27.509> just<00:01:27.960> prune<00:01:28.259> it<00:01:28.409> up<00:01:28.530> a

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
do in this one is just prune it up a

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.380 
do in this one is just prune it up a
little<00:01:28.830> bit<00:01:29.009> because<00:01:29.220> I<00:01:29.430> want<00:01:29.790> it<00:01:29.909> I<00:01:30.090> don't

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
little bit because I want it I don't

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.050 
little bit because I want it I don't
want<00:01:30.540> these<00:01:30.810> branches<00:01:31.320> laying<00:01:31.560> on<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:31.830> ground

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
want these branches laying on the ground

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.609 
want these branches laying on the ground
we've<00:01:33.060> had<00:01:33.210> a<00:01:33.240> number<00:01:33.600> of<00:01:33.659> these<00:01:33.750> that<00:01:34.049> they've

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
we've had a number of these that they've

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:35.749 
we've had a number of these that they've
been<00:01:34.710> pretty<00:01:34.950> much<00:01:35.070> laying<00:01:35.340> on<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.579> ground

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
been pretty much laying on the ground

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.340 
been pretty much laying on the ground
all<00:01:36.030> summer<00:01:36.329> so<00:01:36.600> I'm<00:01:36.689> going<00:01:36.840> to<00:01:36.869> make<00:01:37.049> it<00:01:37.200> nice

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
all summer so I'm going to make it nice

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.499 
all summer so I'm going to make it nice
and<00:01:37.409> compact<00:01:37.829> so<00:01:38.310> that<00:01:38.460> next<00:01:38.670> spring<00:01:38.790> it

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
and compact so that next spring it

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.450 
and compact so that next spring it
flushes<00:01:39.900> out<00:01:40.170> with<00:01:40.380> new<00:01:40.560> growth<00:01:40.829> and<00:01:41.130> that

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
flushes out with new growth and that

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.160 
flushes out with new growth and that
growth<00:01:41.729> comes<00:01:42.030> up<00:01:42.180> this<00:01:42.360> way<00:01:42.420> and<00:01:42.780> doesn't<00:01:42.930> lay

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
growth comes up this way and doesn't lay

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.480 
growth comes up this way and doesn't lay
over<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:43.439> ground<00:01:43.710> ones<00:01:43.860> can<00:01:43.979> get<00:01:44.040> all<00:01:44.189> dirty

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
over the ground ones can get all dirty

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.490 
over the ground ones can get all dirty
now<00:01:44.729> one<00:01:45.360> of<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.509> things<00:01:45.750> that<00:01:45.869> I<00:01:45.900> do<00:01:46.049> is<00:01:46.380> I

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
now one of the things that I do is I

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.219 
now one of the things that I do is I
train<00:01:46.920> these<00:01:47.159> things<00:01:47.460> as<00:01:47.640> a<00:01:47.670> single<00:01:48.210> stem<00:01:48.479> turn

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
train these things as a single stem turn

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.440 
train these things as a single stem turn
them<00:01:49.350> into<00:01:49.470> a<00:01:49.590> single<00:01:50.009> stem<00:01:50.189> tree<00:01:50.579> and<00:01:50.880> stake

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
them into a single stem tree and stake

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.999 
them into a single stem tree and stake
them<00:01:51.600> upright<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:52.200> I'm<00:01:52.560> going<00:01:52.740> to<00:01:52.799> show<00:01:52.979> you

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
them upright and I'm going to show you

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.749 
them upright and I'm going to show you
how<00:01:53.430> we<00:01:53.490> do<00:01:53.759> that<00:01:53.939> with<00:01:54.119> one<00:01:54.360> over<00:01:54.479> here<00:01:55.759> now

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
how we do that with one over here now

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.090 
how we do that with one over here now
you<00:01:56.790> can<00:01:57.030> see<00:01:57.299> that<00:01:57.509> we<00:01:57.659> have<00:01:57.869> tied<00:01:58.170> this<00:01:58.799> one

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
you can see that we have tied this one

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.010 
you can see that we have tied this one
this<00:01:59.369> is<00:01:59.549> the<00:01:59.640> Harry<00:01:59.850> Lauder<00:02:00.060> we've<00:02:00.630> tied<00:02:00.899> this

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
this is the Harry Lauder we've tied this

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.200 
this is the Harry Lauder we've tied this
up<00:02:01.229> to<00:02:01.350> a<00:02:01.439> stake<00:02:01.710> we<00:02:02.219> got<00:02:02.460> it<00:02:02.610> kind<00:02:02.790> of<00:02:02.850> a<00:02:02.969> loop

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
up to a stake we got it kind of a loop

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.749 
up to a stake we got it kind of a loop
in<00:02:03.420> here<00:02:03.450> but<00:02:04.229> that<00:02:04.259> makes<00:02:04.890> it<00:02:05.130> because<00:02:05.460> you

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
in here but that makes it because you

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.609 
in here but that makes it because you
can<00:02:05.969> when<00:02:06.240> all<00:02:06.360> the<00:02:06.479> leaves<00:02:06.719> are<00:02:06.990> off<00:02:07.110> you'll

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
can when all the leaves are off you'll

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.680 
can when all the leaves are off you'll
really<00:02:07.860> see<00:02:08.190> this<00:02:08.369> but<00:02:09.000> this<00:02:09.209> thing<00:02:09.450> comes

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
really see this but this thing comes

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.020 
really see this but this thing comes
like<00:02:09.869> this<00:02:10.140> now<00:02:10.380> here's<00:02:10.950> a<00:02:11.040> branch<00:02:11.400> that's

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
like this now here's a branch that's

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.880 
like this now here's a branch that's
pretty<00:02:12.420> much<00:02:12.600> laying<00:02:13.110> on<00:02:13.290> the<00:02:13.380> ground

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
pretty much laying on the ground

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.490 
pretty much laying on the ground
I<00:02:13.980> don't<00:02:14.879> want<00:02:15.090> eventually<00:02:15.780> I<00:02:15.810> want<00:02:16.140> this<00:02:16.260> plan

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
I don't want eventually I want this plan

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.920 
I don't want eventually I want this plan
to<00:02:16.650> be<00:02:16.739> 5<00:02:16.950> or<00:02:16.980> 6<00:02:17.129> foot<00:02:17.580> tall<00:02:17.849> and<00:02:18.060> then<00:02:18.510> develop

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
to be 5 or 6 foot tall and then develop

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:19.790 
to be 5 or 6 foot tall and then develop
a<00:02:19.020> head<00:02:19.200> up<00:02:19.349> there

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
a head up there

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.010 
a head up there
and<00:02:19.890> the<00:02:20.130> rest<00:02:20.340> of<00:02:20.520> this<00:02:20.580> will<00:02:20.790> all<00:02:20.910> be<00:02:21.090> stem<00:02:21.420> so

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
and the rest of this will all be stem so

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.330 
and the rest of this will all be stem so
now<00:02:22.200> it's<00:02:22.530> towards<00:02:22.770> the<00:02:22.830> end<00:02:23.010> of<00:02:23.040> the<00:02:23.130> growing

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
now it's towards the end of the growing

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.220 
now it's towards the end of the growing
season<00:02:23.460> so<00:02:23.940> I'm<00:02:24.060> going<00:02:24.240> to<00:02:24.300> start<00:02:24.990> trimming

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
season so I'm going to start trimming

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.890 
season so I'm going to start trimming
this<00:02:25.440> thing<00:02:25.680> up<00:02:25.860> because<00:02:26.700> come<00:02:26.970> next<00:02:27.180> spring<00:02:27.360> I

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
this thing up because come next spring I

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.530 
this thing up because come next spring I
want<00:02:28.560> it<00:02:28.710> I<00:02:29.160> want<00:02:29.760> it<00:02:30.000> headed<00:02:30.300> in<00:02:30.360> the<00:02:30.420> right

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
want it I want it headed in the right

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.040 
want it I want it headed in the right

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
direction so I'm going to remove all

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:40.240 
direction so I'm going to remove all
these<00:02:34.350> lower<00:02:34.650> buds<00:02:35.360> and<00:02:36.360> leaves<00:02:36.800> down<00:02:37.800> here

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
these lower buds and leaves down here

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.190 
these lower buds and leaves down here
the<00:02:41.250> leaves<00:02:41.520> are<00:02:41.760> going<00:02:41.850> to<00:02:41.910> fall<00:02:42.210> off<00:02:42.240> but

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
the leaves are going to fall off but

the leaves are going to fall off but
there's<00:02:43.440> right<00:02:43.710> behind<00:02:43.980> each<00:02:44.190> leaf<00:02:44.520> there's<00:02:44.820> a

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
there's right behind each leaf there's a

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:45.560 
there's right behind each leaf there's a
bud

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570

I want that off too because I don't want
to<00:02:50.160> branch<00:02:50.430> down<00:02:50.730> there<00:02:50.940> that's<00:02:51.120> that<00:02:51.360> will<00:02:51.900> be

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
to branch down there that's that will be

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.220 
to branch down there that's that will be
a<00:02:52.290> branch<00:02:52.680> next<00:02:53.250> spring<00:02:53.580> if<00:02:54.210> I<00:02:54.450> don't<00:02:54.690> deal

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
a branch next spring if I don't deal

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:58.490 
a branch next spring if I don't deal
with<00:02:55.380> that<00:02:55.560> now<00:02:55.740> so<00:02:56.160> I'm<00:02:57.000> going<00:02:57.210> to<00:02:57.270> take<00:02:58.260> off

with that now so I'm going to take off

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.640 
with that now so I'm going to take off
these<00:02:58.680> leaves<00:02:58.950> and<00:02:59.340> buds<00:03:00.080> now<00:03:01.080> I'll<00:03:01.200> go<00:03:01.440> up

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
these leaves and buds now I'll go up

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.370 
these leaves and buds now I'll go up
about<00:03:02.490> that<00:03:02.850> high<00:03:03.150> this<00:03:03.210> time<00:03:03.840> of<00:03:03.900> year

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
about that high this time of year

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.170 
about that high this time of year
normally<00:03:05.070> I<00:03:05.130> leave<00:03:05.430> those<00:03:05.640> on<00:03:05.820> there<00:03:06.060> to<00:03:06.150> help

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
normally I leave those on there to help

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.470 
normally I leave those on there to help
feed<00:03:06.630> the<00:03:06.840> plant<00:03:07.170> but<00:03:07.790> this<00:03:08.790> thing<00:03:09.030> is<00:03:09.180> going

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
feed the plant but this thing is going

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.020 
feed the plant but this thing is going
to<00:03:09.540> be<00:03:09.750> dormant<00:03:10.050> here<00:03:10.380> in<00:03:10.440> a<00:03:10.500> few<00:03:10.680> weeks<00:03:10.740> so<00:03:11.310> but

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
to be dormant here in a few weeks so but

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:13.790 
to be dormant here in a few weeks so but
anyway<00:03:12.360> you<00:03:12.420> can<00:03:12.540> see<00:03:12.960> what<00:03:13.200> a<00:03:13.230> crazy-looking

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:13.800 
anyway you can see what a crazy-looking

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:16.940 
anyway you can see what a crazy-looking
stem<00:03:14.430> that<00:03:14.610> is<00:03:14.670> and<00:03:15.090> we'll<00:03:15.240> just<00:03:15.450> keep<00:03:15.630> and<00:03:15.950> if

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
stem that is and we'll just keep and if

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.250 
stem that is and we'll just keep and if
you<00:03:17.070> notice<00:03:17.550> how<00:03:17.700> this<00:03:17.940> thing<00:03:18.150> retracts<00:03:19.050> like

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
you notice how this thing retracts like

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:20.840 
you notice how this thing retracts like
a<00:03:19.290> spring<00:03:19.740> that's<00:03:19.950> the<00:03:20.130> nature<00:03:20.340> of<00:03:20.490> the<00:03:20.580> plant

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
a spring that's the nature of the plant

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:22.700 
a spring that's the nature of the plant
as<00:03:21.060> this<00:03:21.450> grows<00:03:21.720> next<00:03:22.110> year<00:03:22.290> we'll<00:03:22.500> put<00:03:22.680> a

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:22.710 
as this grows next year we'll put a

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:24.890 
as this grows next year we'll put a
taller<00:03:23.010> stake<00:03:23.400> on<00:03:23.640> it<00:03:23.850> and<00:03:24.030> we'll<00:03:24.510> just<00:03:24.540> keep

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
taller stake on it and we'll just keep

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.440 
taller stake on it and we'll just keep
training<00:03:25.230> it<00:03:25.500> upright<00:03:25.890> and<00:03:26.100> in<00:03:26.610> a<00:03:26.910> second<00:03:27.330> here

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
training it upright and in a second here

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:28.910 
training it upright and in a second here
I'm<00:03:27.540> going<00:03:27.660> to<00:03:27.720> show<00:03:27.810> you<00:03:27.989> one<00:03:28.290> that<00:03:28.500> I've

actually planted down on the cemetery
and<00:03:31.140> I'm<00:03:31.380> training<00:03:31.860> that<00:03:32.040> one<00:03:32.280> down<00:03:32.520> there<00:03:32.790> so

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
and I'm training that one down there so

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:34.880 
and I'm training that one down there so
let's<00:03:33.810> go<00:03:33.989> down<00:03:34.170> there<00:03:34.290> and<00:03:34.350> take<00:03:34.500> a<00:03:34.560> look<00:03:34.770> at

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
let's go down there and take a look at

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:40.290 
let's go down there and take a look at
that

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:40.300 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.800 

how<00:03:41.820> earlier<00:03:42.820> in<00:03:42.910> the<00:03:43.000> video<00:03:43.090> I<00:03:43.270> showed<00:03:43.660> you

how earlier in the video I showed you

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:45.630 
how earlier in the video I showed you
the<00:03:43.930> hairy<00:03:44.230> liars<00:03:44.440> walking<00:03:44.980> stick<00:03:45.250> this<00:03:45.400> is

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
the hairy liars walking stick this is

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.450 
the hairy liars walking stick this is
one<00:03:45.880> that<00:03:46.060> I've<00:03:46.180> actually<00:03:46.390> planted<00:03:47.100> at<00:03:48.100> my<00:03:48.250> mom

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:48.460

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 
really she was she really like all kinds

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:55.080 
really she was she really like all kinds
of<00:03:54.010> plants<00:03:54.310> but<00:03:54.400> she<00:03:54.580> really<00:03:54.880> liked

the<00:03:57.400> hairy<00:03:57.580> ladders<00:03:57.880> walking<00:03:58.300> stick<00:03:58.540> would<00:03:58.720> be

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
the hairy ladders walking stick would be

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.780 
the hairy ladders walking stick would be
very<00:03:59.020> very<00:03:59.230> special<00:03:59.470> to<00:03:59.830> her<00:03:59.950> so<00:04:00.430> what<00:04:00.640> I've

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
very very special to her so what I've

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:02.550 
very very special to her so what I've
done<00:04:01.030> is<00:04:01.090> I've<00:04:01.390> trained<00:04:01.720> this<00:04:01.870> one<00:04:02.140> upright

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
done is I've trained this one upright

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.650 
done is I've trained this one upright
and<00:04:02.800> I<00:04:03.400> actually<00:04:03.820> trained<00:04:04.270> this<00:04:04.390> thing<00:04:04.570> at

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:04.660 
and I actually trained this thing at

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:05.970 
and I actually trained this thing at
home<00:04:04.810> up<00:04:05.050> to<00:04:05.080> about<00:04:05.290> this<00:04:05.470> high<00:04:05.620> then<00:04:05.890> I

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:05.980 
home up to about this high then I

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:08.700 
home up to about this high then I
planted<00:04:06.460> it<00:04:06.580> here<00:04:07.000> early<00:04:07.870> this<00:04:08.020> spring<00:04:08.200> and

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:08.710 
planted it here early this spring and

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:10.260 
planted it here early this spring and
all<00:04:09.100> I've<00:04:09.250> trained<00:04:09.580> it<00:04:09.700> up<00:04:09.820> to<00:04:09.940> about<00:04:10.090> this

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:10.270 
all I've trained it up to about this

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:12.300 
all I've trained it up to about this
high<00:04:10.600> and<00:04:10.960> the<00:04:11.320> reason<00:04:11.560> I<00:04:11.620> want<00:04:11.860> to<00:04:11.920> get<00:04:12.070> it<00:04:12.220> up

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
high and the reason I want to get it up

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:15.060 
high and the reason I want to get it up
this<00:04:12.460> high<00:04:12.730> is<00:04:12.790> because<00:04:13.150> our<00:04:13.450> local<00:04:14.440> cemetery

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:15.070

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:31.840 
this up real high and then I'm going to

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.660 
this up real high and then I'm going to
let<00:04:32.020> the<00:04:32.170> head<00:04:32.380> develop<00:04:32.860> way<00:04:33.010> up<00:04:33.160> here<00:04:33.400> so<00:04:33.550> when

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:33.670 
let the head develop way up here so when

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:35.550 
let the head develop way up here so when
the<00:04:33.790> guys<00:04:33.940> are<00:04:34.180> mowing<00:04:34.450> it's<00:04:35.110> not<00:04:35.320> going<00:04:35.500> to

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 
the guys are mowing it's not going to

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.230 
the guys are mowing it's not going to
come<00:04:35.740> along<00:04:35.950> and<00:04:36.130> interfere<00:04:36.460> with<00:04:36.520> them<00:04:36.790> so<00:04:37.180> I

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:37.240 
come along and interfere with them so I

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:38.400 
come along and interfere with them so I
came<00:04:37.330> down<00:04:37.660> here<00:04:37.690> a<00:04:37.810> couple<00:04:37.990> of<00:04:38.080> days<00:04:38.140> ago

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:38.410 
came down here a couple of days ago

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:40.050 
came down here a couple of days ago
because<00:04:38.830> this<00:04:38.980> had<00:04:39.220> leaves<00:04:39.520> all<00:04:39.760> the<00:04:39.790> way<00:04:39.970> up

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:40.060 
because this had leaves all the way up

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:41.760 
because this had leaves all the way up
and<00:04:40.180> down<00:04:40.270> it<00:04:40.600> which<00:04:40.960> is<00:04:41.140> important<00:04:41.680> during

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:41.770 
and down it which is important during

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:42.990 
and down it which is important during
the<00:04:41.920> growing<00:04:42.160> season<00:04:42.340> you<00:04:42.640> want<00:04:42.730> to<00:04:42.850> leave

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.000 
the growing season you want to leave

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.270 
the growing season you want to leave
leaves<00:04:43.330> on<00:04:43.630> there<00:04:43.930> so<00:04:44.350> it<00:04:44.470> continues<00:04:44.919> to<00:04:45.070> feed

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 
leaves on there so it continues to feed

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.460 
leaves on there so it continues to feed
the<00:04:45.400> plant<00:04:45.700> and<00:04:45.940> then<00:04:46.419> keep<00:04:46.690> training<00:04:47.050> this<00:04:47.320> up

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:47.470 
the plant and then keep training this up

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:49.500 
the plant and then keep training this up
right<00:04:47.710> so<00:04:48.190> now<00:04:48.400> we're<00:04:48.910> near<00:04:49.120> the<00:04:49.150> end<00:04:49.300> of<00:04:49.419> the

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:49.510 
right so now we're near the end of the

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:51.030 
right so now we're near the end of the
growing<00:04:49.690> season<00:04:49.810> so<00:04:50.080> I<00:04:50.140> took<00:04:50.200> all<00:04:50.590> this<00:04:50.860> new

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:51.040 
growing season so I took all this new

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.100 
growing season so I took all this new
growth<00:04:51.250> off<00:04:51.550> down<00:04:51.820> here<00:04:51.850> and<00:04:52.330> then<00:04:52.720> little<00:04:52.990> by

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.110 
growth off down here and then little by

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:54.960 
growth off down here and then little by
little<00:04:53.140> I'll<00:04:53.590> take<00:04:53.830> this<00:04:54.070> off<00:04:54.340> and<00:04:54.610> eventually

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:54.970 
little I'll take this off and eventually

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:57.030 
little I'll take this off and eventually
I'll<00:04:55.480> end<00:04:55.630> up<00:04:55.690> with<00:04:55.840> a<00:04:55.870> head<00:04:56.140> here<00:04:56.470> with<00:04:56.890> all

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:57.040 
I'll end up with a head here with all

and maintain things down here to be able
to<00:06:10.030> get<00:06:10.270> underneath<00:06:10.510> of<00:06:10.870> it<00:06:10.960> so<00:06:11.230> again<00:06:11.680> I'm

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:12.310 
to get underneath of it so again I'm

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:13.680 
to get underneath of it so again I'm
going<00:06:12.520> to<00:06:12.580> keep<00:06:12.760> training<00:06:13.090> this<00:06:13.360> thing

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:13.690 
going to keep training this thing

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:15.780 
going to keep training this thing
upright<00:06:14.110> and<00:06:14.380> as<00:06:14.500> I<00:06:14.590> do<00:06:14.650> I'll<00:06:14.980> probably<00:06:15.010> remove

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:15.790 
upright and as I do I'll probably remove

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:17.940 
upright and as I do I'll probably remove
more<00:06:16.090> of<00:06:16.150> these<00:06:16.210> low<00:06:16.420> branches<00:06:17.020> so<00:06:17.470> I<00:06:17.530> can<00:06:17.800> get

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:17.950 
more of these low branches so I can get

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:20.100 
more of these low branches so I can get
that<00:06:18.130> canopy<00:06:18.670> effect<00:06:19.150> like<00:06:19.360> a<00:06:19.390> big<00:06:19.960> umbrella
