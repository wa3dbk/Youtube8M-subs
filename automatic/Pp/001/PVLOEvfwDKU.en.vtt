this<00:00:06.000> is<00:00:06.180> hydrogen<00:00:06.540> tap<00:00:08.510> what<00:00:09.510> we're<00:00:09.690> doing

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
this is hydrogen tap what we're doing

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.360 
this is hydrogen tap what we're doing
right<00:00:10.380> now<00:00:10.440> is<00:00:11.059> looking<00:00:12.059> at<00:00:12.240> the<00:00:13.070> errands<00:00:14.070> l

right now is looking at the errands l
it's<00:00:14.610> 15<00:00:15.089> plate<00:00:15.420> sell<00:00:16.820> each<00:00:17.820> plate<00:00:18.390> is

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
it's 15 plate sell each plate is

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.720 
it's 15 plate sell each plate is
separated<00:00:19.320> by<00:00:19.350> one<00:00:19.650> eighth<00:00:19.800> of<00:00:19.949> an<00:00:20.100> inch<00:00:20.220> this

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
separated by one eighth of an inch this

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.689 
separated by one eighth of an inch this
is<00:00:20.939> a<00:00:20.970> test<00:00:21.390> that<00:00:21.830> you<00:00:22.830> have<00:00:23.010> to<00:00:23.130> look<00:00:23.310> from<00:00:23.550> the

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
is a test that you have to look from the

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.109 
is a test that you have to look from the
first<00:00:24.029> to<00:00:24.539> the<00:00:24.570> end<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:25.320> last<00:00:25.529> test<00:00:26.070> what<00:00:27.000> we

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
first to the end the last test what we

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.849 
first to the end the last test what we
did<00:00:27.359> is<00:00:27.630> we<00:00:27.660> demoed<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.699> use<00:00:29.699> of<00:00:30.289> the<00:00:31.289> spring

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
did is we demoed the use of the spring

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.930 
did is we demoed the use of the spring
water<00:00:32.130> in<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:33.059> cell<00:00:33.329> and<00:00:33.570> you<00:00:33.660> could<00:00:33.840> see<00:00:34.940> what

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
water in the cell and you could see what

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.209 
water in the cell and you could see what
it's<00:00:36.090> doing<00:00:36.180> here<00:00:36.989> I've<00:00:37.350> got<00:00:37.649> it<00:00:37.800> back<00:00:37.980> in<00:00:38.190> a

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
it's doing here I've got it back in a

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.580 
it's doing here I've got it back in a
spring<00:00:38.610> water<00:00:38.879> and<00:00:39.780> you<00:00:39.870> can<00:00:40.050> see<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.379> amount

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
spring water and you can see the amount

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.139 
spring water and you can see the amount
of<00:00:41.540> gas<00:00:42.540> it's<00:00:42.899> producing<00:00:43.579> which<00:00:44.579> isn't<00:00:44.940> too

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
of gas it's producing which isn't too

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.049 
of gas it's producing which isn't too
much<00:00:45.360> it<00:00:45.809> is<00:00:45.989> producing<00:00:46.559> it<00:00:46.739> and<00:00:46.920> it<00:00:47.129> seems<00:00:47.430> to

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
much it is producing it and it seems to

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.069 
much it is producing it and it seems to
be<00:00:48.090> clear<00:00:48.719> or<00:00:49.590> clean<00:00:50.539> in<00:00:51.539> just<00:00:51.809> a<00:00:51.899> minute

I'm showing you though the long video on
this<00:02:57.750> is<00:02:58.140> because<00:02:58.650> the<00:02:59.520> cell<00:02:59.850> is<00:03:00.060> not

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:00.240 
this is because the cell is not

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.410 
this is because the cell is not
operating<00:03:00.720> correctly<00:03:01.820> it<00:03:02.820> should<00:03:02.850> be<00:03:03.180> putting

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
operating correctly it should be putting

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.140 
operating correctly it should be putting
out<00:03:03.630> more<00:03:03.810> hydrogen<00:03:04.260> than<00:03:04.440> it<00:03:04.890> is<00:03:05.160> and<00:03:05.460> we're

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
out more hydrogen than it is and we're

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:12.610 
out more hydrogen than it is and we're
putting<00:03:06.390> out<00:03:06.720> more<00:03:06.990> than<00:03:07.230> 13<00:03:07.740> volts<00:03:08.130> at<00:03:11.030> almost

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
putting out more than 13 volts at almost

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:18.949 
putting out more than 13 volts at almost
15<00:03:13.620> amps<00:03:15.620> I'm<00:03:16.620> sorry<00:03:17.070> almost<00:03:17.490> 10<00:03:17.820> amps<00:03:18.209> I<00:03:18.390> don't

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 
15 amps I'm sorry almost 10 amps I don't

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:20.780 
15 amps I'm sorry almost 10 amps I don't
remember<00:03:19.110> what<00:03:19.530> it<00:03:19.650> was<00:03:19.800> we'll<00:03:20.190> look<00:03:20.370> at<00:03:20.550> it<00:03:20.700> in

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
remember what it was we'll look at it in

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.710 
remember what it was we'll look at it in
a<00:03:20.820> second<00:03:22.640> and<00:03:23.640> now<00:03:23.880> what<00:03:24.150> we're<00:03:24.300> going<00:03:24.390> to<00:03:24.510> do

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
a second and now what we're going to do

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.640 
a second and now what we're going to do
is<00:03:25.200> put<00:03:25.680> straight<00:03:26.100> tap<00:03:26.430> water<00:03:26.760> in<00:03:27.060> this<00:03:27.650> unit

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
is put straight tap water in this unit

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.670 
is put straight tap water in this unit
the<00:03:29.520> tap<00:03:29.820> where<00:03:30.060> has<00:03:30.209> been<00:03:30.240> run<00:03:30.630> for<00:03:31.080> 30

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
the tap where has been run for 30

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.120 
the tap where has been run for 30
seconds<00:03:32.750> same<00:03:33.750> tap<00:03:34.110> water<00:03:34.410> you<00:03:34.530> saw<00:03:34.740> in<00:03:35.070> the

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
seconds same tap water you saw in the

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:37.880 
seconds same tap water you saw in the
previous<00:03:35.670> video<00:03:36.290> that<00:03:37.290> showed<00:03:37.560> you<00:03:37.709> all<00:03:37.860> the

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
previous video that showed you all the

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:44.030 
previous video that showed you all the
garbage<00:03:38.280> now<00:03:39.120> watch<00:03:39.480> what<00:03:39.750> happens<00:03:42.770> if<00:03:43.770> you<00:03:43.860> go

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
garbage now watch what happens if you go

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.670 
garbage now watch what happens if you go
back<00:03:44.220> to<00:03:44.280> the<00:03:44.640> last<00:03:44.880> video<00:03:45.240> and<00:03:45.780> see<00:03:46.080> the<00:03:46.410> tap

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
back to the last video and see the tap

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.850 
back to the last video and see the tap
water<00:03:46.709> test<00:03:47.840> compare<00:03:48.840> it<00:03:48.870> with<00:03:49.020> this<00:03:49.350> video

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 
water test compare it with this video

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:50.810 
water test compare it with this video
and<00:03:50.010> you're<00:03:50.130> going<00:03:50.220> to<00:03:50.280> notice<00:03:50.490> something

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:50.820 
and you're going to notice something

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:53.240 
and you're going to notice something
really<00:03:51.300> interesting<00:03:51.650> this<00:03:52.650> is<00:03:52.800> putting<00:03:53.070> out

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
really interesting this is putting out

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.130 
really interesting this is putting out
so<00:03:53.640> much<00:03:53.820> hydrogen<00:03:54.209> that<00:03:54.630> I'm<00:03:54.750> going<00:03:54.900> to<00:03:54.959> have

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
so much hydrogen that I'm going to have

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.750 
so much hydrogen that I'm going to have
to<00:03:55.170> turn<00:03:55.530> it<00:03:55.680> off<00:03:55.860> and<00:03:57.410> it's<00:03:58.410> only<00:03:58.650> putting<00:03:59.160> out

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
to turn it off and it's only putting out

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.800 
to turn it off and it's only putting out
that<00:03:59.820> hydrogen<00:04:00.750> with<00:04:01.080> 11<00:04:01.680> volts<00:04:01.980> and<00:04:02.810> let's

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
that hydrogen with 11 volts and let's

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:09.890 
that hydrogen with 11 volts and let's
look<00:04:03.959> at<00:04:04.110> the<00:04:04.230> amp<00:04:04.410> meter<00:04:08.240> and<00:04:09.240> you<00:04:09.420> can<00:04:09.600> see

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
look at the amp meter and you can see

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.650 
look at the amp meter and you can see
it's<00:04:10.110> only<00:04:10.560> a<00:04:10.590> little<00:04:11.010> over<00:04:11.340> 10<00:04:11.760> to<00:04:12.000> about<00:04:12.060> 12

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
it's only a little over 10 to about 12

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:17.990 
it's only a little over 10 to about 12
amps<00:04:14.989> if<00:04:15.989> you<00:04:16.230> remember<00:04:16.709> a<00:04:17.040> lot<00:04:17.549> of<00:04:17.609> the<00:04:17.790> other

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
amps if you remember a lot of the other

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.479 
amps if you remember a lot of the other
videos<00:04:18.540> out<00:04:18.840> there<00:04:18.870> by<00:04:19.500> other<00:04:19.739> people<00:04:20.280> there

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
videos out there by other people there

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:22.790 
videos out there by other people there
they're<00:04:21.450> saying<00:04:21.870> that<00:04:22.049> they're<00:04:22.350> putting<00:04:22.680> out

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
they're saying that they're putting out

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.080 
they're saying that they're putting out
much<00:04:23.580> much<00:04:23.910> more<00:04:24.479> with<00:04:24.810> much<00:04:25.080> less

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
much much more with much less

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.460 
much much more with much less
look<00:04:28.090> how<00:04:28.240> much<00:04:28.390> hydrogen<00:04:28.750> is<00:04:29.020> coming<00:04:29.320> out<00:04:29.440> of

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:29.470 
look how much hydrogen is coming out of

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:31.800 
look how much hydrogen is coming out of
this<00:04:29.710> cell<00:04:29.980> this<00:04:30.220> is<00:04:30.280> the<00:04:30.550> air<00:04:30.730> and<00:04:31.000> sell<00:04:31.270> 15

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
this cell this is the air and sell 15

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:34.710 
this cell this is the air and sell 15
plate<00:04:32.080> system<00:04:32.440> now<00:04:33.370> look<00:04:33.730> at<00:04:33.880> the<00:04:34.150> voltage

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:34.720 
plate system now look at the voltage

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.700 
plate system now look at the voltage
that<00:04:34.930> we're<00:04:35.080> using<00:04:35.290> 11<00:04:36.040> in<00:04:36.700> just<00:04:37.030> a<00:04:37.180> moment

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:37.710 
that we're using 11 in just a moment

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:39.870 
that we're using 11 in just a moment
we're<00:04:38.710> going<00:04:38.740> to<00:04:38.920> see<00:04:39.130> it<00:04:39.220> go<00:04:39.370> down<00:04:39.400> because

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:39.880 
we're going to see it go down because

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:44.130 
we're going to see it go down because
I'm<00:04:40.120> not<00:04:40.180> using<00:04:40.750> a<00:04:40.960> charger<00:04:41.500> on<00:04:41.680> this<00:04:42.960> this<00:04:43.960> is

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:44.140 
I'm not using a charger on this this is

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:45.810 
I'm not using a charger on this this is
putting<00:04:44.440> out<00:04:44.530> so<00:04:44.830> much<00:04:44.950> hydrogen<00:04:45.400> that<00:04:45.730> I'm

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:45.820 
putting out so much hydrogen that I'm

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:53.610 
putting out so much hydrogen that I'm
going<00:04:46.000> to<00:04:46.090> have<00:04:46.240> to<00:04:46.270> turn
