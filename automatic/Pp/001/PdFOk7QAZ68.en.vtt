00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:08.750 
thought I'd make a video to clarify a

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:11.920 
thought I'd make a video to clarify a
few<00:00:08.780> things<00:00:10.000> so<00:00:11.000> what<00:00:11.510> we're<00:00:11.660> going<00:00:11.750> to<00:00:11.810> be

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:11.930 
few things so what we're going to be

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:16.089 
few things so what we're going to be
after<00:00:12.350> here<00:00:12.769> is<00:00:13.750> replicating<00:00:14.750> this<00:00:14.980> and<00:00:15.980> what

00:00:16.089 --> 00:00:16.099 
after here is replicating this and what

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:19.240 
after here is replicating this and what
we<00:00:16.250> have<00:00:16.430> is<00:00:16.960> side<00:00:17.960> streets<00:00:18.320> in<00:00:18.590> between<00:00:18.920> two

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:19.250 
we have is side streets in between two

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.840 
we have is side streets in between two
avenues<00:00:20.050> which<00:00:21.050> allows<00:00:21.770> for<00:00:21.800> three<00:00:22.640> high

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:22.850 
avenues which allows for three high

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:25.960 
avenues which allows for three high
density<00:00:23.300> buildings<00:00:23.690> with<00:00:24.680> a<00:00:24.710> little<00:00:25.010> Inlet

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:25.970 
density buildings with a little Inlet

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.960 
density buildings with a little Inlet
now<00:00:26.690> find<00:00:26.930> this<00:00:27.020> l-shape<00:00:27.470> very<00:00:27.800> useful<00:00:28.279> and

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:28.970 
now find this l-shape very useful and

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:31.770 
now find this l-shape very useful and
you<00:00:29.090> can<00:00:29.210> find<00:00:29.420> a<00:00:29.480> guide<00:00:29.630> to<00:00:29.810> that<00:00:30.130> in<00:00:31.130> my<00:00:31.340> guide

you can find a guide to that in my guide

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:34.149 
you can find a guide to that in my guide

not me
so<00:00:35.749> let's<00:00:36.050> get<00:00:36.170> to<00:00:36.229> replicating<00:00:37.069> this<00:00:38.319> so<00:00:39.319> all

00:00:39.459 --> 00:00:39.469 
so let's get to replicating this so all

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:41.500 
so let's get to replicating this so all
we<00:00:39.559> need<00:00:39.649> to<00:00:39.710> do<00:00:39.889> here<00:00:40.159> is<00:00:40.370> start<00:00:40.819> off<00:00:41.149> with

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:41.510 
we need to do here is start off with

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.309 
we need to do here is start off with
Avenue<00:00:42.319> so<00:00:43.309> this<00:00:43.429> is<00:00:43.579> our<00:00:43.760> main<00:00:44.690> traffic<00:00:44.989> this

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:45.319 
Avenue so this is our main traffic this

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:46.389 
Avenue so this is our main traffic this
is<00:00:45.379> where<00:00:45.559> all<00:00:45.710> our<00:00:45.739> traffic<00:00:46.039> is<00:00:46.190> going<00:00:46.339> to

00:00:46.389 --> 00:00:46.399 
is where all our traffic is going to

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:50.349 
is where all our traffic is going to
come<00:00:46.579> through

00:00:50.349 --> 00:00:50.359 

00:00:50.359 --> 00:00:54.099 

so<00:00:51.019> now<00:00:51.170> we<00:00:51.230> just<00:00:52.159> align<00:00:52.429> the<00:00:52.579> size<00:00:52.820> of<00:00:52.999> that<00:00:53.109> so

00:00:54.099 --> 00:00:54.109 
so now we just align the size of that so

00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:56.790 
so now we just align the size of that so
that's<00:00:54.260> pretty<00:00:54.320> good<00:00:54.760> you<00:00:55.760> want<00:00:55.940> it<00:00:56.030> to<00:00:56.149> be

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:56.800 
that's pretty good you want it to be

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.899 
that's pretty good you want it to be
basically<00:00:57.800> the<00:00:57.979> same<00:00:58.010> you<00:00:58.429> don't<00:00:58.519> want<00:00:58.699> it<00:00:58.760> any

00:00:58.899 --> 00:00:58.909 
basically the same you don't want it any

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:01.479 
basically the same you don't want it any
less<00:00:59.149> a<00:00:59.479> little<00:00:59.929> bit<00:01:00.019> more<00:01:00.199> or<00:01:00.409> is<00:01:00.559> okay<00:01:01.339> though

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 
less a little bit more or is okay though

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:04.929 
less a little bit more or is okay though
and<00:01:01.929> then<00:01:02.979> use<00:01:03.979> the<00:01:04.129> guides<00:01:04.339> to<00:01:04.549> make<00:01:04.670> a<00:01:04.729> new

00:01:04.929 --> 00:01:04.939 
and then use the guides to make a new

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:10.760 
and then use the guides to make a new
one<00:01:05.119> and<00:01:05.560> then<00:01:06.560> align<00:01:06.880> again

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.149 

you

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.270 

that'll<00:01:15.119> be<00:01:15.210> good<00:01:15.360> and<00:01:15.649> then<00:01:16.649> this<00:01:16.799> one<00:01:17.039> here

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
that'll be good and then this one here

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.609 
that'll be good and then this one here
this<00:01:17.700> is<00:01:17.759> where<00:01:18.119> our<00:01:18.509> side<00:01:19.049> streets<00:01:19.409> going<00:01:19.530> to

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
this is where our side streets going to

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.190 
this is where our side streets going to
be

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
be

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.540 
be
you

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:24.550 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:26.710 

now<00:01:25.550> this<00:01:25.790> is<00:01:25.940> going<00:01:26.120> to<00:01:26.240> be<00:01:26.420> our<00:01:26.540> future

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
now this is going to be our future

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.149 
now this is going to be our future
Avenue<00:01:27.260> so<00:01:27.470> we'll<00:01:27.590> get<00:01:27.740> that<00:01:27.800> in<00:01:27.950> place

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:30.159 
Avenue so we'll get that in place

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:32.800 
Avenue so we'll get that in place
you

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.899

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:56.940 
room the two high-density buildings here

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.020 
room the two high-density buildings here
and<00:01:57.540> one<00:01:57.810> high-density<00:01:58.380> building<00:01:58.740> here<00:01:59.030> now

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
and one high-density building here now

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.480 
and one high-density building here now
what<00:02:00.330> we're<00:02:00.420> going<00:02:00.540> to<00:02:00.600> do<00:02:00.750> to<00:02:00.960> get<00:02:01.110> our

what we're going to do to get our
horizontal<00:02:02.490> lines<00:02:02.930> it's<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.020> same<00:02:04.230> thing<00:02:04.410> we

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
horizontal lines it's the same thing we

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:12.220 
horizontal lines it's the same thing we
just<00:02:04.650> did<00:02:05.060> but<00:02:06.060> horizontally

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:17.600 

you

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:25.600 

a<00:02:21.730> little<00:02:22.730> bit<00:02:22.850> out<00:02:23.000> of<00:02:23.030> practice<00:02:24.550> okay<00:02:25.550> so

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
a little bit out of practice okay so

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.130 
a little bit out of practice okay so
this<00:02:25.880> is<00:02:26.060> our<00:02:26.450> starting<00:02:27.170> point<00:02:28.120> now<00:02:29.140> what

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
this is our starting point now what

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:35.120 
this is our starting point now what
we're<00:02:30.290> going<00:02:30.410> to<00:02:30.440> do<00:02:30.590> is<00:02:30.710> put<00:02:30.920> one<00:02:31.250> across<00:02:31.880> here

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:40.730 

my<00:02:35.940> lives

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.380 

I'm<00:02:41.070> just<00:02:41.370> going<00:02:41.550> to<00:02:41.610> delete<00:02:41.760> this<00:02:42.000> little<00:02:42.270> bit

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
I'm just going to delete this little bit

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.420 
I'm just going to delete this little bit
so<00:02:42.570> it's<00:02:42.690> not<00:02:42.870> connected<00:02:43.260> there<00:02:43.440> so<00:02:44.100> basically

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
so it's not connected there so basically

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.970 
so it's not connected there so basically
all<00:02:44.550> our<00:02:44.700> traffic<00:02:45.060> if<00:02:46.020> it<00:02:46.110> comes<00:02:46.320> from<00:02:46.560> over

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
all our traffic if it comes from over

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.150 
all our traffic if it comes from over
here<00:02:47.330> it<00:02:48.330> won't<00:02:48.660> want<00:02:49.110> to<00:02:49.200> go<00:02:49.380> in<00:02:49.740> this<00:02:49.920> side

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
here it won't want to go in this side

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.770 
here it won't want to go in this side
street<00:02:50.400> it<00:02:50.610> will<00:02:50.700> just<00:02:50.820> keep<00:02:50.970> going<00:02:51.240> down<00:02:51.450> and

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 
street it will just keep going down and

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.630 
street it will just keep going down and
then<00:02:52.020> across<00:02:52.320> if<00:02:53.010> it's<00:02:53.190> coming<00:02:53.340> from<00:02:53.490> over

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
then across if it's coming from over

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:54.140 
then across if it's coming from over
here

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
here

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.750 
here
it'll<00:02:54.810> want<00:02:54.930> to<00:02:55.020> do<00:02:55.170> the<00:02:55.560> same<00:02:55.740> thing<00:02:55.950> down<00:02:56.310> and

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
it'll want to do the same thing down and

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.940 
it'll want to do the same thing down and
then<00:02:56.940> across<00:02:57.230> someone<00:02:58.230> wants<00:02:58.410> to<00:02:58.470> get<00:02:58.680> here

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
then across someone wants to get here

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.190 
then across someone wants to get here
then<00:02:59.670> hopefully<00:03:00.360> they'll<00:03:00.540> just<00:03:00.570> go<00:03:00.840> also

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
then hopefully they'll just go also

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.790 
then hopefully they'll just go also
Avenue<00:03:01.920> here<00:03:02.130> and<00:03:02.310> down<00:03:02.490> but<00:03:03.230> yeah<00:03:04.230> it<00:03:04.680> won't

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
Avenue here and down but yeah it won't

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.920 
Avenue here and down but yeah it won't
really<00:03:05.010> matter

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
really matter

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:12.050 
really matter
tiny<00:03:07.290> bit<00:03:07.470> of<00:03:07.560> traffic<00:03:08.069> is<00:03:08.370> nothing<00:03:09.590> okay<00:03:11.060> so

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
tiny bit of traffic is nothing okay so

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.339 
tiny bit of traffic is nothing okay so
now<00:03:12.180> we're<00:03:12.299> going<00:03:12.390> to<00:03:12.450> keep<00:03:12.720> going<00:03:12.900> across<00:03:13.230> so

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:13.349 
now we're going to keep going across so

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:16.309 
now we're going to keep going across so
we<00:03:13.620> can<00:03:13.769> fit<00:03:14.480> three<00:03:15.480> high<00:03:15.629> density<00:03:16.019> buildings

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319 
we can fit three high density buildings

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:18.199 
we can fit three high density buildings
in<00:03:16.470> here<00:03:16.709> and<00:03:16.860> then<00:03:17.400> another<00:03:17.640> three<00:03:17.970> along

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
in here and then another three along

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:23.210 
in here and then another three along
again<00:03:18.920> we<00:03:19.920> use<00:03:20.069> the<00:03:20.099> guides<00:03:20.430> and<00:03:21.890> then<00:03:22.890> align

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
again we use the guides and then align

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.210 
again we use the guides and then align
again

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:31.430 

much<00:03:27.640> as<00:03:27.820> promoter<00:03:28.210> to<00:03:28.420> touch

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:36.400 

and<00:03:31.920> oh<00:03:31.980> my<00:03:32.100> god

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:39.860 

so<00:03:37.410> now<00:03:37.560> what<00:03:37.830> this<00:03:37.920> allows<00:03:37.980> for<00:03:38.250> is<00:03:38.760> six<00:03:39.690> high

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
so now what this allows for is six high

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.180 
so now what this allows for is six high
density<00:03:40.380> buildings<00:03:40.770> in<00:03:41.040> this<00:03:41.160> area<00:03:42.590> now<00:03:43.590> three

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
density buildings in this area now three

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:45.380 
density buildings in this area now three
of<00:03:44.280> them<00:03:44.400> are<00:03:44.490> going<00:03:44.580> to<00:03:44.640> be<00:03:44.700> zoned<00:03:44.970> off<00:03:45.180> this

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
of them are going to be zoned off this

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:47.490 
of them are going to be zoned off this
side

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
side

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.470 
side
and<00:03:47.980> three<00:03:48.700> of<00:03:48.790> them<00:03:48.910> are<00:03:49.000> going<00:03:49.090> to<00:03:49.150> be<00:03:49.210> zoned

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
and three of them are going to be zoned

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.300 
and three of them are going to be zoned
off<00:03:49.630> this<00:03:49.810> side<00:03:50.080> now<00:03:50.770> we<00:03:50.830> want<00:03:51.070> to<00:03:51.130> replicate

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
off this side now we want to replicate

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:58.010 
off this side now we want to replicate
this<00:03:51.790> but<00:03:52.060> in<00:03:52.150> Reverse<00:03:54.330> so<00:03:55.330> again<00:03:55.600> what<00:03:55.780> we<00:03:55.870> do

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:58.020 
this but in Reverse so again what we do

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:02.770 
this but in Reverse so again what we do
online<00:03:59.020> the<00:03:59.350> sides

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:08.530 

these<00:04:03.780> the<00:04:03.960> guides

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:19.940 

you

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:19.950 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:25.530 

you

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:25.540 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:28.540 

now<00:04:26.540> what<00:04:26.750> this<00:04:26.870> does<00:04:26.930> here<00:04:27.410> it<00:04:27.680> gives<00:04:28.400> us

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:28.550 
now what this does here it gives us

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:30.040 
now what this does here it gives us
exactly<00:04:28.880> the<00:04:29.150> same<00:04:29.360> as<00:04:29.570> what<00:04:29.720> we've<00:04:29.840> got<00:04:29.960> at

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.050 
exactly the same as what we've got at

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:35.290 
exactly the same as what we've got at
the<00:04:30.140> top<00:04:31.780> and<00:04:32.780> now<00:04:33.590> we<00:04:33.650> can<00:04:33.860> sort<00:04:34.070> out<00:04:34.250> the<00:04:34.940> area

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:35.300 
the top and now we can sort out the area

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.710 
the top and now we can sort out the area
in<00:04:35.510> here

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:38.720 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:41.399 

you

00:04:41.399 --> 00:04:41.409 

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:43.359 

which<00:04:42.409> is<00:04:42.559> going<00:04:42.679> to<00:04:42.739> be<00:04:42.860> from<00:04:43.009> the<00:04:43.159> guides

00:04:43.359 --> 00:04:43.369 
which is going to be from the guides

00:04:43.369 --> 00:04:46.610 
which is going to be from the guides
again

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:52.480 

and<00:04:46.920> then<00:04:47.460> we<00:04:47.580> use<00:04:47.760> an<00:04:47.910> Avenue

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:52.490 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:55.070 

now<00:04:53.490> we<00:04:53.580> want<00:04:53.760> to<00:04:53.820> give<00:04:53.910> this<00:04:54.030> one<00:04:54.270> just<00:04:54.600> a<00:04:54.720> tiny

00:05:14.839 --> 00:05:14.849 

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:19.579 

but<00:05:15.719> without<00:05:15.929> a<00:05:16.110> practice<00:05:16.589> books

00:05:19.579 --> 00:05:19.589 

00:05:19.589 --> 00:05:22.940

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:22.950 

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:26.620 

okay<00:05:23.730> now<00:05:24.090> for<00:05:24.150> the<00:05:24.330> zoning

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:26.630 
okay now for the zoning

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:30.469 
okay now for the zoning
you

00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:30.479 

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:34.170 

so<00:05:31.479> basically<00:05:31.810> what<00:05:32.080> we<00:05:32.169> have<00:05:32.289> here<00:05:32.320> is<00:05:33.180> the

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:34.180 
so basically what we have here is the

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:37.200 
so basically what we have here is the
way<00:05:34.300> I<00:05:34.330> zone<00:05:35.460> just<00:05:36.460> put<00:05:36.789> a<00:05:36.820> little<00:05:37.000> bit<00:05:37.090> of

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:37.210 
way I zone just put a little bit of

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:40.080 
way I zone just put a little bit of
commercial<00:05:37.630> along<00:05:38.110> this<00:05:38.229> side<00:05:38.470> a<00:05:39.000> little<00:05:40.000> bit

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:40.090 
commercial along this side a little bit

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:48.010 
commercial along this side a little bit
on<00:05:40.210> this<00:05:40.389> side<00:05:40.630> and<00:05:41.370> then<00:05:42.370> our<00:05:42.490> residential

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:48.020 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:51.310 

okay<00:05:48.980> so<00:05:49.040> now<00:05:49.220> what<00:05:49.370> this<00:05:49.490> allows<00:05:49.550> for<00:05:49.820> is<00:05:50.360> high

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:51.320 
okay so now what this allows for is high

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:53.110 
okay so now what this allows for is high
density<00:05:51.500> commercial<00:05:52.040> high<00:05:52.700> density

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:53.120 
density commercial high density

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:56.110 
density commercial high density
commercial<00:05:53.440> -<00:05:54.440> high<00:05:55.310> density<00:05:55.700> residential

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:56.120 
commercial - high density residential

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.540 
commercial - high density residential
and<00:05:56.870> then<00:05:56.990> we've<00:05:57.110> got<00:05:57.230> three<00:05:57.590> high<00:05:58.160> density

00:05:58.540 --> 00:05:58.550 
and then we've got three high density

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:00.940 
and then we've got three high density
residential<00:05:59.000> along<00:05:59.360> here<00:05:59.570> so<00:06:00.320> that's<00:06:00.440> six<00:06:00.770> in

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:00.950 
residential along here so that's six in

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:04.510 
residential along here so that's six in
there<00:06:01.070> and<00:06:01.280> then<00:06:02.320> two<00:06:03.320> more<00:06:03.620> high<00:06:03.830> residential

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:04.520 
there and then two more high residential

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:07.930 
there and then two more high residential
in<00:06:04.970> here<00:06:05.390> and<00:06:05.830> then<00:06:06.830> that<00:06:06.860> is<00:06:07.280> an<00:06:07.490> exact<00:06:07.790> copy

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:07.940 
in here and then that is an exact copy

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:10.560 
in here and then that is an exact copy
of<00:06:08.300> what<00:06:08.630> we<00:06:08.750> have<00:06:08.840> here<00:06:09.050> these<00:06:09.500> two<00:06:09.740> here

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:10.570 
of what we have here these two here

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:13.150 
of what we have here these two here
haven't<00:06:11.570> quite<00:06:12.020> made<00:06:12.410> it<00:06:12.470> up<00:06:12.740> to<00:06:12.890> the<00:06:12.920> next

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:13.160 
haven't quite made it up to the next

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.730 
haven't quite made it up to the next
density<00:06:13.640> so<00:06:14.080> that's<00:06:15.080> why<00:06:15.200> they<00:06:15.350> haven't<00:06:15.650> gone

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:15.740 
density so that's why they haven't gone

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:17.650 
density so that's why they haven't gone
across<00:06:15.950> but<00:06:16.370> as<00:06:16.940> you<00:06:17.090> can<00:06:17.210> see<00:06:17.330> here<00:06:17.540> we've<00:06:17.630> got

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:17.660 
across but as you can see here we've got

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:19.690 
across but as you can see here we've got
some<00:06:17.840> high<00:06:18.080> density<00:06:18.530> commercial<00:06:19.520> which

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:19.700 
some high density commercial which

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:21.390 
some high density commercial which
actually<00:06:20.090> can<00:06:20.240> fit<00:06:20.420> in<00:06:20.630> a<00:06:20.750> smaller<00:06:21.140> space

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:21.400 
actually can fit in a smaller space

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:23.740 
actually can fit in a smaller space
sometimes<00:06:22.400> it<00:06:22.700> goes<00:06:22.820> to<00:06:23.030> the<00:06:23.120> same<00:06:23.300> size<00:06:23.540> but

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:23.750 
sometimes it goes to the same size but

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:26.950 
sometimes it goes to the same size but
sometimes<00:06:24.080> about<00:06:25.330> anyway<00:06:26.360> I<00:06:26.480> hope<00:06:26.660> this<00:06:26.780> has

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:26.960 
sometimes about anyway I hope this has

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:29.830 
sometimes about anyway I hope this has
helped<00:06:27.590> as<00:06:28.160> you<00:06:28.430> can<00:06:28.520> see<00:06:28.640> there<00:06:28.820> this<00:06:29.510> is<00:06:29.690> my

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:29.840 
helped as you can see there this is my

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:31.620 
helped as you can see there this is my
only<00:06:30.050> residential

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:31.630 
only residential

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:34.980 
only residential
and<00:06:31.720> it's<00:06:32.580> 25,000<00:06:33.580> people<00:06:33.730> and<00:06:34.030> still<00:06:34.810> got<00:06:34.960> a

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:34.990 
and it's 25,000 people and still got a

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:37.400 
and it's 25,000 people and still got a
couple<00:06:35.170> more<00:06:35.410> to<00:06:35.500> go<00:06:35.560> highs<00:06:35.800> or<00:06:35.980> high<00:06:36.700> density

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:37.410 
couple more to go highs or high density

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:40.340 
couple more to go highs or high density
so<00:06:38.410> yeah<00:06:39.190> you<00:06:39.250> can<00:06:39.400> get<00:06:39.550> some<00:06:39.670> pretty<00:06:40.060> serious

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:40.350 
so yeah you can get some pretty serious

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:44.250 
so yeah you can get some pretty serious
population<00:06:41.350> if<00:06:42.010> you<00:06:42.190> cram<00:06:42.670> them<00:06:42.820> in<00:06:43.260> anybody

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:44.260 
population if you cram them in anybody

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:47.640 
population if you cram them in anybody
thinks<00:06:44.500> goes<00:06:44.680> Joe
