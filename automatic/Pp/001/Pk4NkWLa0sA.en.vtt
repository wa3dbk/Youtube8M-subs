00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:59.110
 perform the marking if all are set 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:02.640
 our molds bring an indication 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:04.739
 where they go assembled 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.460
 we are going to place by the top 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:10.560
 our comic so the heat goes up and 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:14.159
 we can do 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:17.369
 we spliced ​​it and the cousins ​​for the four 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:20.280
 sides to make our engraving since 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:23.130

 to trim all our little ones 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:42.100
 let's make four more petals for 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:45.159

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:03.640
 We will place our mold by the 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:07.479
 part of top and we're going to put the heat 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:10.149
 since we have the forn and hot we go 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:12.600
 to splice our two molds and press 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:12.600

 for the middle part we place a 

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:24.110

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:14.900
 net 

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:26.259
 since we have all of our 

00:07:23.289 --> 00:07:28.330
 rosebushes strategically let's go 

00:07:26.259 --> 00:07:30.880
 filling all the gaps that we 

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:34.070
 were left when placing our roses 

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:38.060
 we put one in red 

00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:39.220
 efe to go giving a different color to
