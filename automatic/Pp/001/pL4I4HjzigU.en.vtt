00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:06.809
 well here we present you unless the 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.580
 Terrarium is still finished but 

00:00:06.809 --> 00:00:10.360
 this is more or less generally how it 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.370
 must see 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:14.980
 if we leave on the left side 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:17.660
 we can see that here is an access 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.910
 rise for all that 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.500
 where you should eventually get to 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.660
 attack I still need is a connection 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:28.460
 between all places 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:30.410
 and with that I move to the second level only to 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:33.290
 level has a support pillar in that 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:35.450
 where it is loading weight too 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.910
 we have a hiding place 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:40.430
 in which he had to take it out for 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:42.140
 look at it whenever you want and we have a 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.990
 third level that as a step between the 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.790
 roof and roof to look at what there is 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:49.400
 against right is done because the 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:52.010
 second the third there is another hiding place 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:54.700
 warm that you can also get it out to 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.700
 work to observe 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:02.610
 foresee in our extreme careers 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:04.930
 level of the first I have other contexts 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:07.090
 clogged with sun and light 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:11.220
 paralysis by as sumen 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:14.370
 I have a main support 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:17.250
 I have a place where I could value almost 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:18.900
 insects I have a drinking fountain that is missing 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.470
 appear from behind where there is a see 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.470
 bottle with water 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.950
 in my other little bit down we have 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:29.760
 take out the layer as you can see 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.690
 and others 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.940
 and food more 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:35.920
 good is nothing yet a good report in 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:40.630
 factor the resource mind to impact the 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:42.250
 new s in oil mars with the cold and 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.920
 cement which gives him two of those 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:47.270
 immense and weights things that the one that 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.230
 know what coma 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.880
 this fund and it's completely 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:54.560
 finished a good see and add those 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:57.180
 details of really hard and firm color 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:00.540
 this still has the first part 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.370
 only need to do the talk between 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.220
 medium and give it a little more thickness 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:08.000
 I'm to paint 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.000
 this space that comes here 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.540
 are from the trunks here come two 

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:15.849
 trunks a trunk along with two 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.010
 tickets for two hiding places in one 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:22.260
 part out all this low until full 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.260
 sand calcium sand for reptiles 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:28.420
 and we had between a pound where are we going 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:31.290
 decorate but then not breathe 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:36.000
 anything the roof as you can see 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.000
 I still have one with a lamp 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.620
 and I 'm still missing 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:47.130
 it's a ventilation where the 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:47.130
 heat make this movement forever 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:52.650
 is missing another where to place the 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:54.830
 night light and a grid in case 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:58.460
 of whatever 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:00.200
 well that's right now I think that a 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:02.090
 more week I'll have it ready because 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.540
 as a job I can only play a 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:07.790
 day or two days a week but like it 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:11.350
 just in case the average is 1 meter 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:14.530
 long 60 deep and 60 high 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:17.080
 and we have been getting up and 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.520
 here are going to go two sliding doors of 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:21.540
 glass 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.540
 that would be until then
