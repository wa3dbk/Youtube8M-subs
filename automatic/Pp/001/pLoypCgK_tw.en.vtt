00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:07.529
 in addition there is blackberry 9300 which 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:10.230
 it comes because it gets too hot and 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:13.409
 the battery is discharged very quickly what 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.999
 first we have done or first thing 

00:00:13.409 --> 00:00:17.220
 What we have done is to do with a boat 

00:00:14.999 --> 00:00:19.380
 of the old solder some cables to each 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.349
 paticas and being able to release them to work for 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:25.050
 know precisely where you qualify 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:26.910
 more time to give them hope if you 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.769
 they warm these sectors down there are 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.199
 more possibilities than heating here 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.030
 up where is power elisa since 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.580
 if it's a propeller, we have to have a lot 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.220
 experience having the spare and knowing 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.960
 change it properly us sometimes 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.730
 with the experience we have and we are 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.850
 difficult 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.380
 sometimes we crown ourselves but if we have 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.270
 changed and we have changed it located 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:49.860
 mind in this case to warm up here in 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.230
 this area where everything is 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:57.140
 what to see with the signal everything that has 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:01:00.350
 what to do with data transmission 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:03.829
 of frequency and there we see that it 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.480
 it warms up and we have also observed here 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:10.700
 at the source 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:14.180
 of power to measure consumption 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:18.070
 we put a practice of the source in 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.070
 the positive and the other in the negative 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.850
 and we see that the consumption of that 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.280
 again excessive has almost the 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.880
 400,000 empires when it should be 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.880
 here 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.020
 0 50 milliamps 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:39.600
 then we are going to be here 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.780
 area that is heating up and review what 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:46.390
 circuit we can fix 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.390
 Well we have already removed the can 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:51.869
 good trowel to make a good cut 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:55.670
 well done well and we will now review 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.670
 that the circuit is the one that overheat 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.270
 good discovered here 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:05.869
 the circuit further heated 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.890
 but to the phone on normally 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:10.140
 either never 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:14.550
 and the circuit that heats the most is this one 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:17.700
 from here that are so close to 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:19.880
 the vibrator has to with one of the 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:23.610
 filters the end of this phone 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:25.740
 so in other cases I have withdrawn it and 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.960
 the phone works let's see in this 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:30.050
 case 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:31.930
 and it's the same thing I'm going to remove it and a 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:34.120
 I'm going to measure 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.799
 and after I remove it and measure with the 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.109
 source of power to see if you can already 

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:41.650
 remove the cut if you removed the short 

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:44.350
 we would change this circuit from another 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.240
 to blackberry or if we would not approve 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:48.490
 to see what 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:52.200
 how efficiently can it get to be 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:52.200
 however in the one that fix
