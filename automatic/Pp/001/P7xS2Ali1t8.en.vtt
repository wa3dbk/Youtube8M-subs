work and simple machines by mrs. dieter
when<00:00:07.259> you<00:00:07.350> think<00:00:07.589> of<00:00:07.710> the<00:00:07.830> word<00:00:08.010> work<00:00:08.400> what

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
when you think of the word work what

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.290 
when you think of the word work what
kinds<00:00:09.540> of<00:00:09.599> things<00:00:09.660> come<00:00:10.230> to<00:00:10.410> mind<00:00:11.300> you

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
kinds of things come to mind you

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.470 
kinds of things come to mind you
probably<00:00:12.690> think<00:00:13.080> of<00:00:13.200> things<00:00:13.500> like<00:00:14.480> homework

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
probably think of things like homework

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:21.620 
probably think of things like homework
or<00:00:17.630> working<00:00:18.630> at<00:00:18.869> a<00:00:18.900> job<00:00:19.820> or<00:00:20.820> maybe<00:00:21.480> even

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
or working at a job or maybe even

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.130 
or working at a job or maybe even
working<00:00:22.380> out<00:00:23.390> but<00:00:24.390> when<00:00:24.539> we<00:00:24.630> think<00:00:24.660> of<00:00:25.019> the

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
working out but when we think of the

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.240 
working out but when we think of the
scientific<00:00:25.920> way<00:00:26.130> of<00:00:26.369> thinking<00:00:27.210> about<00:00:27.300> work

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:28.250 
scientific way of thinking about work

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.630 
scientific way of thinking about work
it's<00:00:29.250> a<00:00:29.369> little<00:00:29.609> bit<00:00:29.760> different<00:00:31.489> when<00:00:32.489> we

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
it's a little bit different when we

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.430 
it's a little bit different when we
consider<00:00:33.090> work<00:00:33.950> work<00:00:34.950> is<00:00:35.160> done<00:00:35.930> when<00:00:36.930> a<00:00:36.989> force

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
consider work work is done when a force

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.630 
consider work work is done when a force
and<00:00:38.149> the<00:00:39.149> motion<00:00:39.540> of<00:00:39.660> an<00:00:39.780> object<00:00:39.930> are<00:00:40.590> in<00:00:41.550> the

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
and the motion of an object are in the

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.020 
and the motion of an object are in the
same<00:00:41.910> direction<00:00:42.860> so<00:00:43.860> in<00:00:44.010> this<00:00:44.160> case<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.820> man

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
same direction so in this case the man

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.779 
same direction so in this case the man
is<00:00:45.210> lifting<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:45.870> Box<00:00:46.250> providing<00:00:47.250> an<00:00:47.370> upward

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
is lifting the Box providing an upward

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.350 
is lifting the Box providing an upward
force<00:00:48.090> and<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:49.350> motion<00:00:50.219> of<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.430> box<00:00:50.730> is<00:00:51.059> in

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
force and the motion of the box is in

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.170 
force and the motion of the box is in
the<00:00:51.449> upward<00:00:51.629> direction<00:00:52.430> so<00:00:53.430> in<00:00:53.579> this<00:00:53.699> picture

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
the upward direction so in this picture

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:00.680 
the upward direction so in this picture
work<00:00:54.870> is<00:00:55.050> being<00:00:55.500> done<00:00:59.149> but<00:01:00.149> if<00:01:00.270> you<00:01:00.300> try<00:01:00.660> to

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
work is being done but if you try to

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.490 
work is being done but if you try to
lift<00:01:01.020> a<00:01:01.230> heavy<00:01:01.469> object<00:01:02.539> how<00:01:03.539> can<00:01:03.750> you<00:01:03.870> make<00:01:04.110> the

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
lift a heavy object how can you make the

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.580 
lift a heavy object how can you make the
work<00:01:04.739> easier<00:01:06.950> what<00:01:07.950> about<00:01:08.189> using<00:01:08.400> a<00:01:08.640> machine

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
work easier what about using a machine

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.740 
work easier what about using a machine
but<00:01:10.590> not<00:01:10.770> something<00:01:11.130> so<00:01:11.520> complicated<00:01:12.030> like

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
but not something so complicated like

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.100 
but not something so complicated like
the<00:01:12.900> one<00:01:13.080> shown<00:01:13.350> here<00:01:14.479> how<00:01:15.479> about<00:01:15.600> something

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
the one shown here how about something

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.590 
the one shown here how about something
simple<00:01:18.170> simple<00:01:19.170> machines<00:01:19.500> maybe<00:01:20.479> there's<00:01:21.479> a

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
simple simple machines maybe there's a

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.480 
simple simple machines maybe there's a
variety<00:01:21.840> of<00:01:22.200> simple<00:01:22.619> machines<00:01:22.979> that<00:01:23.220> we<00:01:23.310> can

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
variety of simple machines that we can

variety of simple machines that we can
use<00:01:23.700> to<00:01:23.729> make<00:01:24.180> work<00:01:24.540> easier<00:01:25.340> when<00:01:26.340> we<00:01:26.460> say

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
use to make work easier when we say

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.270 
use to make work easier when we say
we're<00:01:27.000> making<00:01:27.360> work<00:01:27.630> easier<00:01:28.170> we<00:01:28.860> mean<00:01:29.100> that

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
we're making work easier we mean that

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.719 
we're making work easier we mean that
it's<00:01:29.520> requiring<00:01:30.210> less<00:01:30.780> of<00:01:31.020> a<00:01:31.140> force<00:01:31.520> to<00:01:32.520> have

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
it's requiring less of a force to have

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.460 
it's requiring less of a force to have
an<00:01:32.880> object<00:01:33.380> produce<00:01:34.380> work<00:01:36.049> let's<00:01:37.049> go<00:01:37.229> through

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
an object produce work let's go through

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.499 
an object produce work let's go through
each<00:01:37.710> one<00:01:37.740> of<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.189> simple<00:01:38.520> machines<00:01:38.640> on<00:01:39.150> their

own and discuss how they make work

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.190 
own and discuss how they make work
easier<00:01:43.880> let's<00:01:44.880> start<00:01:45.240> with<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.600> inclined

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
easier let's start with the inclined

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.840 
easier let's start with the inclined
plane<00:01:46.409> an<00:01:48.020> inclined<00:01:49.020> plane<00:01:49.049> is<00:01:49.799> also<00:01:50.340> known<00:01:50.579> as

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
plane an inclined plane is also known as

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.069 
plane an inclined plane is also known as
a<00:01:50.909> ramp<00:01:53.030> imagine<00:01:54.030> that<00:01:54.180> you<00:01:54.299> have<00:01:54.509> to<00:01:54.720> move<00:01:54.960> an

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
a ramp imagine that you have to move an

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.200 
a ramp imagine that you have to move an
object<00:01:55.590> into<00:01:55.890> the<00:01:56.250> back<00:01:56.520> of<00:01:56.729> a<00:01:56.790> moving<00:01:57.060> truck

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
object into the back of a moving truck

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.620 
object into the back of a moving truck
if<00:01:57.829> you<00:01:58.829> had<00:01:59.040> to<00:01:59.189> lift<00:01:59.399> it<00:01:59.549> off<00:01:59.670> the<00:01:59.729> ground

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
if you had to lift it off the ground

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.990 
if you had to lift it off the ground
it<00:02:00.750> would<00:02:01.020> require<00:02:01.409> quite<00:02:01.799> a<00:02:01.920> bit<00:02:02.040> of<00:02:02.189> force<00:02:02.610> an

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
it would require quite a bit of force an

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.120 
it would require quite a bit of force an
effort<00:02:03.869> to<00:02:04.049> get<00:02:04.170> it<00:02:04.320> into<00:02:04.469> the<00:02:04.680> back<00:02:04.860> of<00:02:05.070> the

effort to get it into the back of the
vehicle<00:02:05.869> however<00:02:06.869> if<00:02:07.200> you<00:02:07.409> include<00:02:07.860> an

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
vehicle however if you include an
