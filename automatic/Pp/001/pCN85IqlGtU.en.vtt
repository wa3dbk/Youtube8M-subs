you<00:01:16.729> really<00:01:17.729> need<00:01:17.970> to<00:01:18.509> be<00:01:18.740> as<00:01:19.909> knowledgeable

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
you really need to be as knowledgeable

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.870 
you really need to be as knowledgeable
as<00:01:21.360> you<00:01:21.570> can<00:01:21.840> about<00:01:22.710> Dishman<00:01:23.130> investment

as you can about Dishman investment
trends<00:01:24.030> in<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.270> stock<00:01:24.570> market<00:01:24.600> and<00:01:25.549> the<00:01:26.549> thing

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
trends in the stock market and the thing

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.969 
trends in the stock market and the thing
is<00:01:26.820> there's<00:01:27.509> so<00:01:27.659> many<00:01:27.750> different<00:01:27.900> sectors<00:01:28.680> in

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
is there's so many different sectors in

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.670 
is there's so many different sectors in
global<00:01:29.700> markets<00:01:29.900> that<00:01:30.900> it's<00:01:31.380> really

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
global markets that it's really

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.380 
global markets that it's really
impossible<00:01:32.040> to<00:01:32.430> be<00:01:32.520> an<00:01:32.610> expert<00:01:32.970> in<00:01:33.180> everything

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
impossible to be an expert in everything

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.410 
impossible to be an expert in everything
and<00:01:33.960> that's<00:01:34.950> why<00:01:35.220> I<00:01:35.250> think<00:01:35.369> it's<00:01:35.579> useful<00:01:36.030> to

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
and that's why I think it's useful to

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.710 
and that's why I think it's useful to
have<00:01:36.680> what<00:01:37.680> I<00:01:37.710> consider<00:01:38.250> was<00:01:39.210> calling<00:01:39.570> a

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
have what I consider was calling a

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.520 
have what I consider was calling a
mastermind<00:01:40.380> group<00:01:40.409> and<00:01:41.000> you<00:01:42.000> know<00:01:42.119> I<00:01:42.150> try<00:01:42.420> to

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
mastermind group and you know I try to

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.109 
mastermind group and you know I try to
distill<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:44.009> lots<00:01:44.220> of<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:44.520> information<00:01:44.880> that

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
distill the lots of the information that

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.289 
distill the lots of the information that
I<00:01:45.600> read<00:01:46.200> and<00:01:46.380> hear<00:01:46.590> about<00:01:46.850> for<00:01:47.850> you<00:01:48.000> in<00:01:48.210> the

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
I read and hear about for you in the

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.499 
I read and hear about for you in the
newsletter<00:01:48.630> and<00:01:48.990> videos<00:01:49.320> I<00:01:49.560> put<00:01:49.829> out<00:01:50.479> but<00:01:51.479> I

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
newsletter and videos I put out but I

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.020 
newsletter and videos I put out but I
then<00:01:51.720> still<00:01:51.990> think<00:01:52.170> it's<00:01:52.259> useful<00:01:52.729> if<00:01:53.729> I<00:01:53.880> could

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
then still think it's useful if I could

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.560 
then still think it's useful if I could
somehow<00:01:54.240> provide<00:01:54.630> you<00:01:54.869> more<00:01:55.590> access<00:01:56.130> to<00:01:56.570> this
