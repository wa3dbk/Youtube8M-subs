00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:10.700
 About half of all women feel 

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:13.639
 due to uneven pigmentation 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.990
 their skin impaired devote stains 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:18.789
 affect her feeling of 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:21.560
 attractiveness and youthfulness negative 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:24.589
 a uniform pigmentation ours 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.810
 Skin is necessary it protects the DNA 

00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:30.859
 our skin 10 effectively before 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:33.110
 damaging uv rays for the 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:35.000
 regeneration of our skin are the 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.970
 cells of the basal layer responsible 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.920
 in this cell layer are the 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:43.160
 melanin producing cells 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:47.450
 the melanocytes divide the basal cells 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:49.130
 and thus the keratinocytes form that 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:51.260
 pigment that our skin is yours 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:52.850
 individual color is there in 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.060
 special cell organelles 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:58.850
 melanocytes are made for synthesis 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:00.610
 of the melanoma plays the enzyme tyrosine 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.680
 asa a decisive role 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:06.200
 the pink nose transforms the colorless 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:09.799
 tyrosine in a precursor of the colored 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:12.439
 melanin sum packed in 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:14.060
 so-called melanosomes will become the melanin 

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:19.119
 through the long foothills of the 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:19.119
 melanocytes also brought keratinocytes 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.970
 this happens in the keratinocytes 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:31.210
 melanin hats for me about the 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:35.440
 cell nucleus reflected and absorbed there 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:37.840
 it uv radiate the dna in the cell nucleus becomes 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:40.350
 so safe from uv conditional damage 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.350
 protected 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:48.220
 numerous factors such as age 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:50.170
 genetic susceptibility hormone status in 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.900
 pregnancy or hormonal 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:55.690
 contraception air pollution 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:58.300
 or inflammatory skin reactions 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:01.360
 affect the pigmentation of the skin 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:03.370
 at hyper pigmentation like mila smend 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.790
 age spots or freckles are 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:08.170
 the melanocytes actively increase 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.240
 especially under the influence of 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:13.150
 sunlight is melanie overly 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:15.040
 the consequence is the skin 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.800
 appears irregularly colored and 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.100
 spotty what the quality of life negative 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.510
 can influence 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.310
 That's why the outer skin research 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.470
 a special skin care series 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.330
 develops the excessive and 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.820
 irregular pigmentation of the skin 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:33.610
 reduced and at the same time before newer 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:36.580
 discoloration protects our deep 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:38.920
 wider the highly effective active 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:41.290
 drug would be so cute shirt that 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.090
 key enzyme tyrosine nose and 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:46.140
 regulates the melanin so effectively 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:48.670
 synthesis already at its origin 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:51.490
 Studies on cell cultures prove 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:53.830
 in similar concentrations is like that 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:55.750
 zinell in effect comparable to 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:58.870
 Brighten leading medical skin 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.520
 to active substances the result is dark 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:03.700
 Pigment spots are reduced 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:04.930
 The day will be even more in addition 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.970
 protects a particularly high 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.890
 sun protection factor 30 the skin 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:12.190
 future uneven 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:15.550
 pigmentation as he is wider in iven 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:17.580
 The care series protects and protects 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:20.970
 repaired 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:23.570
 when he gave him medical expertise for 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.570
 nice skin
