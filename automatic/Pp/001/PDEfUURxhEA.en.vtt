00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:07.120
 well they have now gained a first impression and now want a bet 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.710
 placing it will be a bit strange at the beginning compared to others 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.290
 Bookmakers you might know but honestly it could not 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:16.659
 look easier 

00:00:16.659 --> 00:00:21.039
 Prof first, you'll see that we are occupying decimal numbers for odds 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:25.069
 Contrary to some bookmakers who quote quotas about "two to one" 

00:00:25.069 --> 00:00:29.969
 but our power system time much clearer on how high their profit will be 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.960
 but I do not know how they are doing but I can not do it that fast 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.740
 Calculate how high one wins at a quota of 4 to 7 fails 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:43.620
 But with the decima threatening at Betfair, everything is completely transparent 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.900
 Number indicates how much you can win for a Euro bet on joke 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.350
 For example, suppose they are betting on a Barcelona victory 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:52.569
 Manchester United 

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:57.889
 for goals of free 25 for every euro you get three euros 25 

00:00:57.889 --> 00:01:04.949
 in case of profit back with a use of ten euros they hold 32 EUR 50 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.070
 back 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.560
 how easy is that? 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.290
 6 Perhaps you already noticed this little green symbol 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:19.020
 that's that in Pleasantville this means that it's just a live event 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.020
 You can bet on them while we are running 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.730
 Example of just Barcelona vs Manchester we accept Manchester 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:31.570
 is in the second half two back to zero although I set to Menu 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:36.410
 I now have many options during the game 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:40.530
 Either I write the victory and Vettel now finally especially of the dead 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.150
 but on Barcelona and write off my original values 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:49.080
 or is now on a draw or I believe in Manchester so tightly 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.310
 Now, as soon as children continue eating on them, Werner sets two then 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.310
 As you know, fast goals are scored against lower odds 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:02.259
 There are a lot of strategic ties in Oz 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:05.259
 for live bets we'll take a closer look later 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.889
 Prof 

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:14.779
 For all games there are pink columns for Leverkusen the blue column 

00:02:14.779 --> 00:02:18.799
 with the normal way worlds they already know small shops 10 but is something 

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:25.309
 The rest of you will notice something does not happen if you have one 

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:29.030
 When they talked to Barcelona they bet that Barcelona would not 

00:02:29.029 --> 00:02:32.029
 changed to a win by Menu or a draw 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.860
 such bets are interesting even if there are many potential winners 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.720
 At Fields or Formula 1 here they can win a level against 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.400
 that drives without the pilot put the from their point of view in any case 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.110
 will win if their forecast arrives they cashed the bet 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:52.560
 In their advertising partner's preaching, they have to offer the dead statements they offer 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.000
 have if she suffers a complete victory against Barcelona 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.700
 and Borstel I can return two rooms to you during the game 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.290
 their risk loosely secure as far as the first foundations for Lell will be now 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.420
 Let's look at where they want to put their money
