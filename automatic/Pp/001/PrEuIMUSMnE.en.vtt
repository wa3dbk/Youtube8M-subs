western saddle in it then there's some
boots<00:02:23.460> on<00:02:23.760> another<00:02:24.480> set<00:02:24.720> of<00:02:24.810> handmade<00:02:25.050> shelves

these are our halters and I think a

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.580 
these are our halters and I think a
couple<00:02:29.910> of<00:02:30.000> them<00:02:30.150> are<00:02:30.300> off<00:02:30.450> the<00:02:30.660> horses<00:02:30.960> in<00:02:31.530> the

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.670 
fields which is probably why I couldn't
find<00:02:33.480> them<00:02:33.840> because<00:02:34.380> they're<00:02:34.680> there<00:02:34.890> oops<00:02:35.670> and

stallion<00:04:29.890> thing<00:04:30.670> I<00:04:30.970> know<00:04:31.420> it's<00:04:31.660> crowded

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 
stallion thing I know it's crowded

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.570 
stallion thing I know it's crowded
please<00:04:32.260> didn't<00:04:32.590> comment<00:04:33.010> about<00:04:33.220> that<00:04:33.280> I<00:04:33.430> know

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:33.580 
please didn't comment about that I know

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:37.440 
please didn't comment about that I know
it's<00:04:33.790> crowded<00:04:35.790> actually<00:04:36.790> I<00:04:36.820> think<00:04:36.970> a<00:04:37.240> couple

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:37.450 
it's crowded actually I think a couple

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:39.420 
it's crowded actually I think a couple
of<00:04:37.540> these<00:04:37.690> should<00:04:37.930> be<00:04:37.960> in<00:04:38.140> the<00:04:38.200> barn<00:04:38.440> which<00:04:39.190> is

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
of these should be in the barn which is

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:42.090 
of these should be in the barn which is
probably<00:04:39.910> why<00:04:40.180> it's<00:04:40.420> so<00:04:40.630> crowded<00:04:40.960> that<00:04:41.560> would

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:42.100 
probably why it's so crowded that would
