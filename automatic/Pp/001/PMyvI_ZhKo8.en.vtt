00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:03.079
 two 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.800
 Hello good Morning 

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:11.350
 We will have decided to get rid of 

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:15.220
 all the magical material I have mine 

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:17.250
 personal for the sole reason that I'm going 

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:20.470
 accumulating and accumulating and accumulating 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.180
 since the providers serve him 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:23.320
 constantly material so that what 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.470
 try so you know how it works 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:29.770
 always paying what is unfortunately in 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:34.020
 This life does not aggravate anything and a 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:34.020
 I have existing point in huge boxes 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:46.230
 your products to the store as is 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:49.740
 in the handkerchiefs in the tube as is the 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:52.830
 phantom part and soon they do not arrive 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:54.450
 more and there he had two bars full of 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:56.910
 head part of all the bars 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:58.710
 personal than me four then 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.710
 well honestly this is one of the 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.210
 houses I have calculated that I have 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:06.270
 approximately 80 casualties are all 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.979
 the different collection design and 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.550
 resigned all that directly 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:13.350
 grows that it is not a standard blue deck 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.420
 or red that I also have them already 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.490
 I will get rid of some contest but 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:21.900
 this is how they are of some value 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:23.940
 thought of giving the quotes between and 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.800
 I say in quotes because the 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:29.119
 want the code will have to do is 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.119
 pay shipping costs 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:36.470
 is doing it like that because there are 81 I'm going to 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:39.800
 assume thirdly the cost of 80 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:43.550
 low so I as well indicates this 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:45.470
 video video by deck 1 means that 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:48.290
 every time someone has asked the 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:51.200
 shuffle shuffle let's say that way 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:54.480
 will put a new provision so that the 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:57.270
 want only paying the shipping costs 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:59.900
 how to proceed to it I have done well 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.810
 video like this 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:05.300
 you will find in the store a link that 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.430
 it's called video by deck in which 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:09.440
 you can proceed to the payment that I only say 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:12.160
 just pay the shipping costs that 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.160
 difference 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:18.750
 The amount indicated in the store is 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:22.260
 seven euros for who makes the payment 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:24.239
 by paypal because 7 paypal and 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.620
 transfer minus header of the 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:28.860
 entity simply because the 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.750
 ipad stays a small amount of 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.710
 commission for every sale I make 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.650
 so 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:39.750
 has calculated that I need a bit of 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:42.490
 margin why I have not done the calculation 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.770
 mathematical the feeling of the fact 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:46.420
 mentally and I can go cents up 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:48.310
 cents down gives exactly the same 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.640
 obviously with this I'm not going to do 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.680
 rich 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:55.680
 in the event that it is superior 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.329
 and then in this way then we do 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.980
 a difference for all sensual karen and 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:05.720
 a cost class in 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:08.659
 50 so whoever makes the payment of the 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:10.700
 shipping costs by paypal will pay 7 and 

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:12.470
 that they have clear and in mind that who 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.989
 make the payment by bank transfer 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:18.319
 that you enter 6 of you would take in the 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:20.840
 inscription and what it indicates good by 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:23.060
 So whenever you have to 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:25.459
 someone has acquired a said deck 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.920
 product is going to have a stop of 1 so in 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:31.760
 the moment someone makes the payment they 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:34.790
 finished the stock and we would proceed to the video 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:39.790
 by low number 2 as it shows the 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:41.799
 hand bicycle blanc scorpion 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:45.280
 to be the first one that we put in 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:47.890
 march so whoever wants that deck 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:50.560
 he only wants to pay the shipping costs 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:53.260
 that as I said 7 euros by paypal 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:56.069
 6 euros bank transfer if you are 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:57.870
 from outside Spain yes 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:04:00.990
 you want to make the payment of this amount 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:04.620
 another annual part of the world 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:07.080
 you must include the product and they load you 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:09.540
 shipping costs you can only do it 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.620
 by paypal the cases of outside and you 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.180
 They will earn the shipping costs with the 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.410
 pending to the weight of the product that goes to 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:16.230
 be higher and we are talking 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:19.080
 approximately of twelve euros 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:21.980
 apart from the down payment it means that in 

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:24.510
 scratched for two things I obviously 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:27.300
 would make a return of the first 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:29.910
 payment so you do not pay more than the bill 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:33.090
 applies to others who buy in 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:36.690
 Spain you already know payment from those of the 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:38.820
 carry and lower and keep in mind that 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:41.280
 let's be clear we are talking about my 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:43.730
 that is to say 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:47.160
 that each and every one of them are 

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:50.070
 open, each and every one of 

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:53.070
 them almost in all likelihood because 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:56.510
 is my mania started when I open them 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:56.510
 inspection 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:04.240
 I knew that the law of murphy would fall 

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:07.750
 used once and the clutter or in this 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:10.060
 case not not the messy black 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:12.460
 scorpion I did not do it yet so 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:16.150
 both you will find with a deck 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:18.790
 open with one or two uses thing that does not 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:21.160
 is going to notice in I will not be and 

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:25.360
 extremely worn decks a lot 

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:27.569
 less and possibly in disorder 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:29.039
 that you have been using 

00:05:27.569 --> 00:05:31.499
 I think that nothing is left to say 

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:34.380
 let's perform already I say a series of 

00:05:31.499 --> 00:05:38.960
 videos about all this 

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:38.960
 I have about 80 decks has shown us 

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:46.390
 scorpion 

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:48.790
 this is the rule the network network board 

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:51.990
 tech is the whole red deck is and can 

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:56.350
 seem like a bicycle but it is not is 

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:59.980
 red on its back and although it slipped a little 

00:05:56.350 --> 00:06:03.760
 bad some slip bad I do not know perfect 

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:08.220
 red for the face 

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:12.570
 I show you some how it can be 

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:12.570
 too long the low 

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:21.820
 speights the line 

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:21.820
 for valls and with 125 anniversary 

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:30.460
 bicycle and arrogant although this is a 

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:32.289
 the sale the root of white was black 

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:34.360

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:39.810
 white tiger 

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:43.020
 the piper such and that also for sale 

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:46.470
 some of them probably assault me ​​the 

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:49.900
 basic rival that is sonorous is that 

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:52.540
 generally there is a sale 

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:54.639

00:06:54.639 --> 00:06:57.990
 there was the root 

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:08.129
 I do not know that I do not have any 

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:12.270
