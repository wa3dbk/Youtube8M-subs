hey welcome back to whiteboard
wednesdays<00:00:12.590> want<00:00:12.890> to<00:00:12.950> give<00:00:13.070> you<00:00:13.130> a<00:00:13.190> quick

wednesdays want to give you a quick

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:15.310 
wednesdays want to give you a quick
hitter<00:00:13.760> on<00:00:13.940> lateral<00:00:14.330> movement<00:00:14.690> and<00:00:14.840> change<00:00:15.140> of

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:15.320 
hitter on lateral movement and change of

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:16.570 
hitter on lateral movement and change of
direction<00:00:15.500> so<00:00:16.040> we're<00:00:16.130> going<00:00:16.220> to<00:00:16.280> build<00:00:16.400> our

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:16.580 
direction so we're going to build our

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:26.900 
direction so we're going to build our
prototype<00:00:17.119> first

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.150 

pretty<00:00:27.750> crude<00:00:27.960> when<00:00:28.170> that<00:00:28.289> works<00:00:28.830> there's<00:00:29.039> our

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
pretty crude when that works there's our

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.250 
pretty crude when that works there's our
round<00:00:29.460> contact<00:00:29.940> so<00:00:30.150> three<00:00:30.750> things<00:00:30.990> we<00:00:31.080> want<00:00:31.200> to

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
round contact so three things we want to

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.020 
round contact so three things we want to
talk<00:00:31.410> to<00:00:31.560> you<00:00:31.650> about<00:00:31.740> today<00:00:32.070> first<00:00:32.460> one<00:00:32.820> is

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
talk to you about today first one is

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:39.049 
talk to you about today first one is
feet<00:00:35.989> only<00:00:36.989> two<00:00:37.140> points<00:00:37.470> of<00:00:37.559> contact<00:00:37.820> are<00:00:38.820> your

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
feet only two points of contact are your

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.060 
feet only two points of contact are your
feet<00:00:39.330> so<00:00:39.989> how<00:00:40.140> your<00:00:40.290> foot<00:00:40.440> interacts<00:00:40.860> with<00:00:41.010> the

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
feet so how your foot interacts with the

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.799 
feet so how your foot interacts with the
ground<00:00:41.250> is<00:00:41.400> super<00:00:41.760> important<00:00:42.239> sometimes<00:00:42.480> you

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
ground is super important sometimes you

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:44.810 
ground is super important sometimes you
want<00:00:42.989> a<00:00:43.019> lot<00:00:43.230> of<00:00:43.320> surface<00:00:43.680> area<00:00:43.830> sometimes<00:00:44.400> you

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
want a lot of surface area sometimes you

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.759 
want a lot of surface area sometimes you
don't<00:00:44.879> want<00:00:45.000> very<00:00:45.210> much<00:00:45.330> so<00:00:45.629> two<00:00:45.690> keys<00:00:46.440> that<00:00:46.620> we

00:00:46.759 --> 00:00:46.769 
don't want very much so two keys that we

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:48.799 
don't want very much so two keys that we
teach<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.010> first<00:00:47.340> one<00:00:47.610> is<00:00:48.030> pushing<00:00:48.390> your<00:00:48.600> toes

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
teach the first one is pushing your toes

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.509 
teach the first one is pushing your toes
down<00:00:49.140> through<00:00:49.500> your<00:00:49.650> toe<00:00:49.860> box<00:00:50.129> or<00:00:50.370> through

00:00:50.509 --> 00:00:50.519 
down through your toe box or through

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:51.799 
down through your toe box or through
your<00:00:50.670> shoe<00:00:50.850> like<00:00:51.059> you're<00:00:51.210> trying<00:00:51.390> to<00:00:51.480> rip<00:00:51.629> out

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
your shoe like you're trying to rip out

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.540 
your shoe like you're trying to rip out
that<00:00:52.019> front<00:00:52.199> part<00:00:52.410> of<00:00:52.470> the<00:00:52.530> shoe<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:53.129> second

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
that front part of the shoe the second

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.040 
that front part of the shoe the second
one<00:00:53.640> is<00:00:53.760> a<00:00:53.790> Paco<00:00:54.059> stop<00:00:54.330> when<00:00:54.540> I'm<00:00:54.629> pushed<00:00:54.840> up

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
one is a Paco stop when I'm pushed up

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.439 
one is a Paco stop when I'm pushed up
that's<00:00:55.620> using<00:00:55.980> your<00:00:56.070> lateral<00:00:56.519> lateral<00:00:57.120> side

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
that's using your lateral lateral side

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.180 
that's using your lateral lateral side
to<00:00:57.540> push<00:00:57.750> through<00:00:57.930> all<00:00:58.860> right

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
to push through all right

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.760 
to push through all right
so<00:00:59.430> ground<00:00:59.879> contact<00:01:00.420> time<00:01:00.600> and<00:01:00.899> your<00:01:01.050> feet<00:01:01.260> the

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
so ground contact time and your feet the

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.870 
so ground contact time and your feet the
second<00:01:02.190> one<00:01:02.370> is<00:01:02.940> angles<00:01:04.580> now<00:01:05.580> this<00:01:05.729> is

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
second one is angles now this is

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:06.770 
second one is angles now this is
something<00:01:06.180> that<00:01:06.210> we're<00:01:06.390> going<00:01:06.479> to<00:01:06.539> talk<00:01:06.720> about

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
something that we're going to talk about

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.330 
something that we're going to talk about
over<00:01:07.350> and<00:01:07.440> over<00:01:07.680> we<00:01:07.770> want<00:01:07.830> to<00:01:07.979> create<00:01:08.130> these

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
over and over we want to create these

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.670 
over and over we want to create these
positive<00:01:08.940> shin<00:01:09.180> angles<00:01:09.509> right<00:01:09.690> here<00:01:09.960> that's

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
positive shin angles right here that's

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.410 
positive shin angles right here that's
what<00:01:10.770> we<00:01:10.890> call<00:01:11.100> this<00:01:11.250> positive<00:01:11.520> shingles<00:01:12.300> and

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
what we call this positive shingles and

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.150 
what we call this positive shingles and
again<00:01:12.960> they're<00:01:13.140> pushing<00:01:13.530> down<00:01:14.100> and<00:01:15.050> away<00:01:16.160> both

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:17.160 
again they're pushing down and away both

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.719 
again they're pushing down and away both
head<00:01:17.340> in<00:01:17.430> same<00:01:17.640> direction<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:18.479> last<00:01:18.720> one<00:01:19.729> is

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
head in same direction the last one is

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.120 
head in same direction the last one is
this<00:01:20.940> hip<00:01:21.210> box<00:01:21.450> here<00:01:21.720> this<00:01:22.500> controls<00:01:22.979> your

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
this hip box here this controls your

one anytime your shoulders get outside
the<00:01:51.090> base<00:01:51.330> of<00:01:51.509> your<00:01:51.539> support<00:01:52.050> that<00:01:52.679> base<00:01:53.250> is

00:01:53.449 --> 00:01:53.459 
the base of your support that base is

00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:55.070 
the base of your support that base is
support<00:01:53.849> you're<00:01:54.179> gonna<00:01:54.270> be<00:01:54.450> off<00:01:54.569> balance<00:01:55.050> now

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.080 
support you're gonna be off balance now

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.839 
support you're gonna be off balance now
it's<00:01:55.289> gonna<00:01:55.440> happen<00:01:55.739> but<00:01:56.340> a<00:01:56.369> lot<00:01:56.550> of<00:01:56.640> times

00:01:56.839 --> 00:01:56.849 
it's gonna happen but a lot of times

00:01:56.849 --> 00:01:58.490 
it's gonna happen but a lot of times
most<00:01:57.179> times<00:01:57.509> you<00:01:57.899> want<00:01:58.080> to<00:01:58.140> keep<00:01:58.349> those

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
most times you want to keep those

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.529 
most times you want to keep those
shoulders<00:01:58.920> inside<00:01:59.550> the<00:01:59.700> base<00:01:59.880> of<00:02:00.060> the<00:02:00.149> support

00:02:00.529 --> 00:02:00.539 
shoulders inside the base of the support

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:02.660 
shoulders inside the base of the support
so<00:02:00.899> hope<00:02:01.440> that<00:02:01.619> helps<00:02:01.979> a<00:02:02.039> couple<00:02:02.310> of<00:02:02.369> tidbits
