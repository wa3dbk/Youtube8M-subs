00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
now the fuel scope a lot of individuals

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.860 
now the fuel scope a lot of individuals
don't<00:00:11.100> understand<00:00:11.460> it's<00:00:11.610> not<00:00:11.880> like<00:00:12.660> our

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
don't understand it's not like our

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.379 
don't understand it's not like our
electroscope<00:00:13.470> square<00:00:14.010> like<00:00:14.700> our<00:00:14.849> system<00:00:15.240> B

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
electroscope square like our system B

it<00:00:18.060> doesn't<00:00:18.449> have<00:00:18.539> the<00:00:18.720> discrimination<00:00:19.500> they

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
it doesn't have the discrimination they

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.830 
it doesn't have the discrimination they
have<00:00:19.860> it<00:00:20.190> is<00:00:20.520> a<00:00:20.550> reason<00:00:20.970> for<00:00:21.000> that<00:00:21.240> we<00:00:21.390> want<00:00:21.720> to

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
have it is a reason for that we want to

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.810 
have it is a reason for that we want to
pick<00:00:21.990> up<00:00:22.199> everything<00:00:22.500> out<00:00:22.830> here<00:00:23.100> that's<00:00:23.580> going

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
pick up everything out here that's going

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.980 
pick up everything out here that's going
to<00:00:23.880> rig<00:00:24.090> up<00:00:24.180> on<00:00:24.390> our<00:00:24.920> metal<00:00:25.920> detectors<00:00:26.430> and<00:00:26.990> we

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
to rig up on our metal detectors and we

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.870 
to rig up on our metal detectors and we
don't<00:00:28.140> want<00:00:28.260> to<00:00:28.320> miss<00:00:28.439> any<00:00:28.949> buttons<00:00:29.430> we<00:00:29.730> don't

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
don't want to miss any buttons we don't

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.759 
don't want to miss any buttons we don't
have<00:00:30.029> this<00:00:30.119> anything<00:00:30.570> small

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
have this anything small

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:37.010 
have this anything small
we'll<00:00:32.340> just<00:00:32.640> study<00:00:34.130> any<00:00:35.130> shot<00:00:35.820> at<00:00:36.090> all<00:00:36.239> what

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
we'll just study any shot at all what

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.690 
we'll just study any shot at all what
would<00:00:37.230> make<00:00:37.380> sure<00:00:37.559> that<00:00:37.590> we<00:00:37.739> get<00:00:37.950> everything

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
would make sure that we get everything

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.600 
would make sure that we get everything
that<00:00:39.630> comes<00:00:39.870> out<00:00:40.050> of<00:00:40.170> these<00:00:40.260> sites<00:00:40.590> so<00:00:40.920> they're

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
that comes out of these sites so they're

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.400 
that comes out of these sites so they're
they're<00:00:41.910> pretty<00:00:41.940> sensitive<00:00:42.809> for<00:00:43.079> that<00:00:43.200> now

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
they're pretty sensitive for that now

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.030 
they're pretty sensitive for that now
you<00:00:43.469> kid

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
you kid

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.979 
you kid
you<00:00:44.610> can't<00:00:44.880> discriminate<00:00:45.239> a<00:00:45.510> little<00:00:45.780> bit<00:00:45.899> if

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
you can't discriminate a little bit if

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.569 
you can't discriminate a little bit if
you<00:00:46.050> want<00:00:46.110> all<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.800> instruments<00:00:47.309> to<00:00:47.340> have<00:00:47.550> a

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
you want all the instruments to have a

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.030 
you want all the instruments to have a
different<00:00:47.940> type<00:00:48.090> of<00:00:48.120> discrimination<00:00:48.860> but<00:00:49.860> if

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:50.040 
different type of discrimination but if

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.850 
different type of discrimination but if
you<00:00:50.160> use<00:00:50.370> a<00:00:50.960> way<00:00:51.960> we<00:00:52.110> tell<00:00:52.320> you<00:00:52.410> to<00:00:52.500> use<00:00:52.649> what

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
you use a way we tell you to use what

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.069 
you use a way we tell you to use what
they<00:00:52.980> kill<00:00:53.190> produce<00:00:53.850> it<00:00:54.090> it's<00:00:54.600> kind<00:00:54.870> of<00:00:54.899> like

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
they kill produce it it's kind of like

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
like fishing we use to the scope out

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.880 
like fishing we use to the scope out
here<00:01:00.480> we're<00:01:00.600> not<00:01:00.719> even<00:01:00.960> running<00:01:01.680> our

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
here we're not even running our

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.470 
here we're not even running our
detectors<00:01:02.430> so<00:01:02.579> we've<00:01:02.730> already<00:01:02.910> done<00:01:03.270> all<00:01:03.449> that

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
detectors so we've already done all that

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.499 
detectors so we've already done all that
stuff<00:01:03.930> back<00:01:04.229> and<00:01:04.619> forth<00:01:04.979> up<00:01:05.279> and<00:01:05.339> down<00:01:05.759> all

stuff back and forth up and down all
over<00:01:06.569> the<00:01:06.990> place

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
over the place

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.199 
over the place
other<00:01:07.529> detector<00:01:08.159> individuals<00:01:08.759> have<00:01:08.909> been<00:01:08.939> out

00:01:09.199 --> 00:01:09.209 
other detector individuals have been out

00:01:09.209 --> 00:01:11.209 
other detector individuals have been out
here<00:01:09.329> doing<00:01:09.630> it<00:01:09.779> but<00:01:10.289> we're<00:01:10.499> doing<00:01:10.859> right<00:01:11.039> here

00:01:11.209 --> 00:01:11.219

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
right now it's coming out with our

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.190 
right now it's coming out with our
scopes<00:01:13.139> find<00:01:13.889> it<00:01:14.009> an<00:01:14.130> area<00:01:14.420> they'd<00:01:15.420> hit<00:01:15.899> that

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.129 
scopes find it an area they'd hit that
area<00:01:16.999> with<00:01:17.999> our<00:01:18.029> metal<00:01:18.270> detector<00:01:18.749> so<00:01:18.899> we're

00:01:19.129 --> 00:01:19.139 
area with our metal detector so we're

00:01:19.139 --> 00:01:40.080 
area with our metal detector so we're
going<00:01:19.319> into<00:01:19.469> about<00:01:19.679> a<00:01:19.740> six<00:01:20.099> foot<00:01:20.159> spot

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
tear a large Center so I'm thinking to

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.290 
tear a large Center so I'm thinking to
see<00:02:08.140> what<00:02:08.259> it<00:02:08.410> these<00:02:09.190> are<00:02:09.310> large<00:02:09.550> Centauri<00:02:10.209> our

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300 
see what it these are large Centauri our

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.960 
see what it these are large Centauri our
King<00:02:10.810> George<00:02:11.110> it's<00:02:11.769> large<00:02:12.069> set<00:02:12.400> tell<00:02:12.760> why<00:02:12.910> the
