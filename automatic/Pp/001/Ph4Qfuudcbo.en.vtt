00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
the collection looks a little bit more

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.290 
the collection looks a little bit more
powdery<00:02:14.830> on<00:02:15.070> the<00:02:15.220> cheek<00:02:15.520> and<00:02:15.730> it's<00:02:15.910> a<00:02:16.030> really

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
powdery on the cheek and it's a really

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.030 
powdery on the cheek and it's a really
pick<00:02:16.870> up<00:02:16.900> and<00:02:17.260> swatching<00:02:17.740> with<00:02:17.830> your<00:02:17.950> I've

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
consistency really sticky and thick so

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:08.880 
consistency really sticky and thick so
you<00:04:06.880> wouldn't<00:04:07.360> need<00:04:07.480> a<00:04:07.810> little<00:04:08.170> bit<00:04:08.470> of<00:04:08.530> this

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:08.890 
you wouldn't need a little bit of this

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:10.980 
you wouldn't need a little bit of this
and<00:04:09.190> I<00:04:09.459> could<00:04:09.640> definitely<00:04:09.940> see<00:04:10.270> you<00:04:10.630> needing

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:10.990 
and I could definitely see you needing

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:13.949 
and I could definitely see you needing
to<00:04:11.260> set<00:04:11.830> it<00:04:12.040> you<00:04:12.550> know<00:04:12.700> for<00:04:12.940> sure<00:04:13.240> but<00:04:13.450> it's<00:04:13.660> got

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:13.959 
to set it you know for sure but it's got

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:16.229 
to set it you know for sure but it's got
great<00:04:14.350> coverage<00:04:14.830> so<00:04:15.100> I'm<00:04:15.220> hoping<00:04:15.610> it<00:04:15.760> you<00:04:16.120> know

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 
great coverage so I'm hoping it you know

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:17.130 
great coverage so I'm hoping it you know
it<00:04:16.359> seems<00:04:16.510> like<00:04:16.600> it's<00:04:16.810> going<00:04:16.930> to<00:04:16.959> be

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:17.140 
it seems like it's going to be

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:19.949
