00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:33.650 
this just broken that's one piece then

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:35.110 
this just broken that's one piece then
what<00:01:33.830> you<00:01:33.920> do<00:01:34.100> is<00:01:34.250> you<00:01:34.340> move<00:01:34.490> your<00:01:34.670> left<00:01:34.820> hand

what you do is you move your left hand

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.240 
what you do is you move your left hand
up<00:01:35.570> one<00:01:36.140> octave<00:01:36.290> and<00:01:36.620> you<00:01:36.710> start<00:01:36.980> the<00:01:37.070> whole

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
up one octave and you start the whole

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:45.990 
up one octave and you start the whole
thing<00:01:37.280> over<00:01:37.580> again<00:01:40.480> up<00:01:41.480> again<00:01:43.900> and<00:01:44.900> one<00:01:45.110> more

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:46.000 
thing over again up again and one more

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.800 
thing over again up again and one more
and<00:01:47.800> then<00:01:48.800> you<00:01:48.920> end<00:01:49.190> with<00:01:49.520> the<00:01:50.060> highest<00:01:50.270> F<00:01:50.600> on

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
and then you end with the highest F on

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.180 
and then you end with the highest F on
the<00:01:50.900> keyboard<00:01:53.229> so<00:01:54.229> slowly<00:01:54.620> again<00:01:54.979> F

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:55.190 
the keyboard so slowly again F

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:05.610 
the keyboard so slowly again F
diminished<00:01:55.850> seventh<00:01:57.760> emajor<00:01:58.760> octave<00:02:03.880> and

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:05.620 
diminished seventh emajor octave and

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:09.969 
diminished seventh emajor octave and
with<00:02:06.620> F<00:02:07.869> now<00:02:08.869> coming<00:02:09.170> down<00:02:09.470> it's<00:02:09.740> a<00:02:09.830> bit

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
with F now coming down it's a bit

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:11.680 
with F now coming down it's a bit
trickier<00:02:10.429> and<00:02:10.610> this<00:02:10.729> is<00:02:10.910> what<00:02:11.120> you'll<00:02:11.330> need<00:02:11.450> to

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
trickier and this is what you'll need to

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.040 
trickier and this is what you'll need to
practice<00:02:12.140> on<00:02:12.290> the<00:02:12.470> most<00:02:13.180> this<00:02:14.180> is<00:02:14.480> just<00:02:14.930> a

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
practice on the most this is just a

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.550 
practice on the most this is just a
simple<00:02:15.290> pattern<00:02:15.860> of<00:02:16.400> four<00:02:16.880> notes<00:02:17.260> then<00:02:18.260> back

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
simple pattern of four notes then back

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.729 
simple pattern of four notes then back
up<00:02:18.770> one<00:02:19.010> and<00:02:19.250> down<00:02:19.400> four<00:02:19.760> so<00:02:20.530> you're<00:02:21.530> going<00:02:21.680> to

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:21.739 
up one and down four so you're going to

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:24.280 
up one and down four so you're going to
start<00:02:22.130> right<00:02:22.850> below<00:02:23.209> where<00:02:23.239> you<00:02:23.570> ended<00:02:23.870> which

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
start right below where you ended which

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.400 
start right below where you ended which
is<00:02:24.440> this<00:02:24.650> highest<00:02:25.040> e<00:02:25.989> with<00:02:26.989> your<00:02:27.200> ring<00:02:27.380> finger

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
is this highest e with your ring finger

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:35.590 
is this highest e with your ring finger
it's<00:02:28.010> going<00:02:28.280> to<00:02:28.370> be<00:02:28.520> e<00:02:30.280> d<00:02:31.280> c<00:02:31.630> b<00:02:34.239> now<00:02:35.239> what<00:02:35.450> you're

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
it's going to be e d c b now what you're

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.720 
it's going to be e d c b now what you're
going<00:02:35.750> to<00:02:35.780> do<00:02:35.989> is<00:02:36.320> squish<00:02:37.040> together<00:02:37.250> with<00:02:37.580> your

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
going to do is squish together with your

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:44.759 
going to do is squish together with your
rim<00:02:38.200> go<00:02:39.200> up<00:02:39.380> one<00:02:40.420> then<00:02:41.420> continue<00:02:42.260> this<00:02:42.350> pattern

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:44.769 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:03:01.120 

up<00:02:45.769> one

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:03.620 

once<00:03:02.130> you<00:03:02.280> pass<00:03:02.490> middle<00:03:02.970> C<00:03:03.180> you're<00:03:03.420> going<00:03:03.569> to

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
once you pass middle C you're going to

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:10.490 
once you pass middle C you're going to
end<00:03:03.840> on<00:03:04.610> the<00:03:05.610> G<00:03:05.850> sharp<00:03:07.820> so<00:03:08.820> once<00:03:09.000> again<00:03:09.500> it's

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
end on the G sharp so once again it's

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.970 
end on the G sharp so once again it's
four<00:03:10.920> steps<00:03:11.250> down<00:03:11.730> this<00:03:12.600> is<00:03:12.810> assuming<00:03:13.350> think

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
four steps down this is assuming think

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.710 
four steps down this is assuming think
of<00:03:14.070> it<00:03:14.190> like<00:03:14.280> a<00:03:14.340> C<00:03:14.610> major

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:38.990 

starting<00:03:18.720> on<00:03:18.810> e<00:03:18.840> and<00:03:19.470> you<00:03:20.030> push<00:03:21.030> me<00:03:21.180> to<00:03:21.300> win<00:03:38.000> in

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
starting on e and you push me to win in

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.380 
starting on e and you push me to win in
your<00:03:39.360> left<00:03:39.570> hand<00:03:39.870> for<00:03:40.380> the<00:03:40.500> C<00:03:40.739> sharp<00:03:41.390> you're

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
your left hand for the C sharp you're
