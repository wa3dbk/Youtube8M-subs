00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:15.379 

we<00:00:13.139> start<00:00:13.380> with<00:00:13.590> a<00:00:13.620> an<00:00:14.549> idea<00:00:14.940> usually<00:00:15.179> a

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
we start with a an idea usually a

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.660 
we start with a an idea usually a
subject<00:00:15.839> that<00:00:16.379> then<00:00:17.010> we<00:00:17.190> will<00:00:17.310> research

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
subject that then we will research

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.109 
subject that then we will research
several<00:00:18.449> months<00:00:19.369> at<00:00:20.369> some<00:00:20.609> point<00:00:20.789> we<00:00:20.910> start

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
several months at some point we start

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:22.370 
several months at some point we start
getting<00:00:21.390> a<00:00:21.480> sense<00:00:21.660> of<00:00:21.750> what<00:00:21.900> the<00:00:22.020> users

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
getting a sense of what the users

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.320 
getting a sense of what the users
interaction<00:00:22.800> with<00:00:23.580> the<00:00:23.730> system<00:00:24.000> is<00:00:24.150> going<00:00:24.269> to

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
interaction with the system is going to

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.080 
interaction with the system is going to
be<00:00:24.480> now<00:00:24.840> why<00:00:25.080> is<00:00:25.529> going<00:00:25.740> to<00:00:25.800> be<00:00:25.859> fun<00:00:26.070> and<00:00:26.250> then

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
be now why is going to be fun and then

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.490 
be now why is going to be fun and then
we<00:00:27.180> start<00:00:27.390> to<00:00:27.480> process<00:00:27.599> a<00:00:27.900> building<00:00:28.170> the<00:00:28.349> model

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
we start to process a building the model

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.049 
we start to process a building the model
and<00:00:29.090> we<00:00:30.090> have<00:00:30.480> to<00:00:30.689> take<00:00:30.840> a<00:00:30.900> very<00:00:32.059> layered

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
and we have to take a very layered

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.340 
and we have to take a very layered
approach<00:00:33.390> to<00:00:33.630> building<00:00:33.719> these<00:00:33.930> models

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
approach to building these models

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:35.569 
approach to building these models
because<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:34.739> kind<00:00:34.860> of<00:00:34.890> simulations<00:00:35.309> we<00:00:35.460> do

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
because the kind of simulations we do

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.360 
because the kind of simulations we do
are<00:00:36.260> generally<00:00:37.260> social<00:00:37.620> simulations<00:00:37.890> as

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
are generally social simulations as

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.729 
are generally social simulations as
opposed<00:00:39.239> to<00:00:39.420> vehicle<00:00:39.930> simulations<00:00:40.530> or

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
opposed to vehicle simulations or

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.060 
opposed to vehicle simulations or
whatnot<00:00:41.750> social<00:00:42.750> simulations<00:00:43.290> really<00:00:43.860> are<00:00:44.040> a

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
whatnot social simulations really are a

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.060 
whatnot social simulations really are a
lot<00:00:44.550> more<00:00:44.690> difficult<00:00:45.690> to<00:00:45.750> build<00:00:46.070> than

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
lot more difficult to build than

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.410 
lot more difficult to build than
something<00:00:47.579> like<00:00:47.789> in<00:00:47.910> a<00:00:47.940> flight<00:00:48.210> simulator

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
something like in a flight simulator

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.170 
something like in a flight simulator
which<00:00:48.989> is<00:00:49.170> much<00:00:49.320> more<00:00:49.469> straightforward<00:00:49.850> so<00:00:50.850> we

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
which is much more straightforward so we

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.630 
which is much more straightforward so we
start<00:00:51.480> with<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.690> core<00:00:52.020> behaviors<00:00:52.530> we<00:00:53.430> get

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
start with the core behaviors we get

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.459 
start with the core behaviors we get
those<00:00:53.760> tuned<00:00:54.210> and<00:00:54.570> then<00:00:54.840> we<00:00:55.020> start<00:00:55.230> layering

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
those tuned and then we start layering

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.580 
those tuned and then we start layering
on<00:00:55.829> more<00:00:56.610> and<00:00:56.850> more<00:00:56.960> subtle<00:00:57.960> behaviors<00:00:58.109> and

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
on more and more subtle behaviors and

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.500 
on more and more subtle behaviors and
the<00:00:59.070> process<00:00:59.430> of<00:00:59.579> building<00:00:59.670> that<00:00:59.940> model<00:01:00.359> is

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
the process of building that model is

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.990 
the process of building that model is
probably<00:01:01.440> one<00:01:01.800> of<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:01.949> most<00:01:02.100> critical<00:01:02.430> skills

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
probably one of the most critical skills

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.800 
probably one of the most critical skills
we<00:01:03.420> have<00:01:03.769> in<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:04.979> mark<00:01:05.189> place<00:01:05.450> so<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.540> process

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
we have in the mark place so the process

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.030 
we have in the mark place so the process
of<00:01:06.930> designing<00:01:07.200> a<00:01:07.320> game<00:01:07.350> is<00:01:07.590> very<00:01:07.770> much<00:01:07.860> like

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
of designing a game is very much like

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.810 
of designing a game is very much like
climbing<00:01:08.970> up<00:01:09.060> tree<00:01:09.360> every<00:01:10.290> branch<00:01:10.560> is<00:01:10.680> a

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
climbing up tree every branch is a

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.820 
climbing up tree every branch is a
potential<00:01:11.869> decision<00:01:12.869> point<00:01:13.200> a<00:01:13.380> different<00:01:13.740> way

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
potential decision point a different way

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.870 
potential decision point a different way
the<00:01:13.979> design<00:01:14.280> can<00:01:14.460> go<00:01:16.610> based<00:01:17.610> on<00:01:17.729> our

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
the design can go based on our

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.570 
the design can go based on our
experience<00:01:18.360> and<00:01:18.689> guided<00:01:19.350> by<00:01:19.439> intuition<00:01:19.830> we're

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
experience and guided by intuition we're

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:21.560 
experience and guided by intuition we're
getting<00:01:20.670> better<00:01:20.939> and<00:01:21.119> better<00:01:21.240> at<00:01:21.450> knowing

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
getting better and better at knowing

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.080 
getting better and better at knowing
which<00:01:21.979> branches<00:01:22.979> we<00:01:23.159> should<00:01:23.340> take<00:01:23.549> both<00:01:23.880> on<00:01:24.060> a

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
which branches we should take both on a

simulation<00:01:37.229> we<00:01:37.650> do<00:01:37.799> we<00:01:37.950> basically<00:01:38.280> built<00:01:38.400> from

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
simulation we do we basically built from

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.080 
simulation we do we basically built from
the<00:01:38.759> ground<00:01:38.850> up<00:01:39.270> and<00:01:40.700> really<00:01:41.700> it's<00:01:42.000> the

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
the ground up and really it's the

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.210 
the ground up and really it's the
experience<00:01:42.360> we<00:01:42.810> have<00:01:43.079> in<00:01:43.439> how<00:01:43.740> to<00:01:43.799> build<00:01:44.100> these

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
experience we have in how to build these

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:47.300 
experience we have in how to build these
models<00:01:44.700> that<00:01:45.659> gives<00:01:45.960> us<00:01:46.110> efficiency<00:01:46.799> if<00:01:47.130> we

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
models that gives us efficiency if we

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.980 
models that gives us efficiency if we
tried<00:01:47.549> to<00:01:47.579> reuse<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:48.149> same<00:01:48.180> code<00:01:48.570> over<00:01:48.869> and

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
tried to reuse the same code over and

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.560 
tried to reuse the same code over and
over<00:01:49.140> it<00:01:49.710> would<00:01:50.340> be<00:01:50.460> a<00:01:50.490> very<00:01:50.729> little<00:01:51.030> help<00:01:51.270> but

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
over it would be a very little help but

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:52.789 
over it would be a very little help but
the<00:01:51.720> fact<00:01:51.930> that<00:01:51.990> we<00:01:52.170> know<00:01:52.320> just<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.770> right

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
the fact that we know just the right

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.730 
the fact that we know just the right
order<00:01:53.159> to<00:01:53.670> build<00:01:53.820> and<00:01:54.090> two<00:01:54.240> models<00:01:54.750> saves<00:01:55.500> us<00:01:55.649> a

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
order to build and two models saves us a

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.459 
order to build and two models saves us a
lot<00:01:55.770> of<00:01:56.130> time<00:01:56.310> and<00:01:56.549> a<00:01:56.640> lot<00:01:56.670> of<00:01:56.790> experimentation

00:01:57.459 --> 00:01:57.469 
lot of time and a lot of experimentation

00:01:57.469 --> 00:02:00.469 
lot of time and a lot of experimentation
so<00:01:58.469> every<00:01:59.310> model<00:01:59.549> is<00:01:59.610> custom-built<00:01:59.820> for<00:02:00.240> it

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
so every model is custom-built for it

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.959 
so every model is custom-built for it
speaking<00:02:00.689> of<00:02:00.840> purpose<00:02:01.200> and<00:02:01.409> is<00:02:02.280> as<00:02:02.520> efficient

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
speaking of purpose and is as efficient

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.520 
speaking of purpose and is as efficient
as<00:02:03.000> we<00:02:03.149> can<00:02:03.240> possibly<00:02:03.270> make<00:02:03.719> it<00:02:03.899> I<00:02:04.020> just<00:02:04.350> know

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
as we can possibly make it I just know

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:05.959 
as we can possibly make it I just know
what<00:02:04.680> kind<00:02:04.799> of<00:02:04.829> games<00:02:05.040> I<00:02:05.159> like<00:02:05.310> to<00:02:05.399> play<00:02:05.490> I<00:02:05.759> mean

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
what kind of games I like to play I mean

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:10.040 
what kind of games I like to play I mean
in<00:02:06.210> in<00:02:06.479> essence<00:02:07.350> that<00:02:07.590> is<00:02:07.920> kind<00:02:08.849> of<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.599> way<00:02:10.020> I

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
in in essence that is kind of the way I

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.570 
in in essence that is kind of the way I
go<00:02:10.259> about<00:02:10.289> it<00:02:10.649> is<00:02:10.770> what<00:02:11.039> do<00:02:11.129> I<00:02:11.190> want<00:02:11.400> to<00:02:11.459> play

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
go about it is what do I want to play

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.240 
go about it is what do I want to play
what<00:02:11.730> kind<00:02:11.849> of<00:02:11.879> game

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
what kind of game

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.440 
what kind of game
what<00:02:12.340> I<00:02:12.370> really<00:02:12.670> enjoy<00:02:12.700> and<00:02:15.060> it's<00:02:16.060> really<00:02:16.270> hard

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
what I really enjoy and it's really hard

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:17.700 
what I really enjoy and it's really hard
to<00:02:16.540> go<00:02:16.630> back<00:02:16.660> and<00:02:16.810> say<00:02:17.050> what<00:02:17.350> would<00:02:17.500> this

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:17.710 
to go back and say what would this

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:19.140 
to go back and say what would this
person<00:02:17.920> like<00:02:18.250> I<00:02:18.280> know<00:02:18.490> he<00:02:18.670> doesn't<00:02:18.820> like<00:02:19.000> what

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
person like I know he doesn't like what

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:20.850 
person like I know he doesn't like what
I<00:02:19.210> like<00:02:19.390> so<00:02:19.420> I'm<00:02:19.630> gonna<00:02:19.750> have<00:02:19.870> to<00:02:19.990> think<00:02:20.650> put

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
I like so I'm gonna have to think put

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.290 
I like so I'm gonna have to think put
myself<00:02:21.010> in<00:02:21.250> his<00:02:21.340> mindset<00:02:21.670> and<00:02:21.880> design<00:02:22.120> a<00:02:22.150> game

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
myself in his mindset and design a game

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.030 
myself in his mindset and design a game
that<00:02:22.450> he<00:02:22.570> would<00:02:22.690> like<00:02:22.840> a<00:02:23.080> lot<00:02:23.680> of<00:02:23.710> people<00:02:23.770> do

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
that he would like a lot of people do

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.120 
that he would like a lot of people do
that<00:02:24.070> and<00:02:24.310> they<00:02:24.370> fail<00:02:24.550> miserably<00:02:24.730> um<00:02:26.130> really

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
that and they fail miserably um really

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:28.800 
that and they fail miserably um really
the<00:02:27.250> best<00:02:27.430> games<00:02:27.670> i've<00:02:27.820> seen<00:02:27.850> we're<00:02:28.510> designed

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
the best games i've seen we're designed

of these chaotic systems and that's what

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:49.089

we allow them to explore in our software

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
in a related aspect of that is what's

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.869 
in a related aspect of that is what's
known<00:03:51.900> as<00:03:52.019> emergent<00:03:52.439> behavior<00:03:52.579> where<00:03:53.579> you<00:03:53.760> can

00:03:53.869 --> 00:03:53.879 
known as emergent behavior where you can

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:55.819 
known as emergent behavior where you can
take<00:03:54.000> very<00:03:54.209> simple<00:03:54.569> rules<00:03:54.810> and<00:03:55.200> by<00:03:55.560> combining

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:55.829 
take very simple rules and by combining

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:57.440 
take very simple rules and by combining
them<00:03:56.099> you<00:03:56.219> get<00:03:56.310> very<00:03:56.549> elaborate<00:03:56.879> behavior<00:03:57.269> and

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
them you get very elaborate behavior and

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:00.020 
them you get very elaborate behavior and
this<00:03:58.319> is<00:03:58.530> really<00:03:59.010> the<00:03:59.099> essence<00:03:59.579> of<00:03:59.639> our<00:03:59.790> models

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
this is really the essence of our models

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:01.819 
this is really the essence of our models

complicated model and sort of a system
dynamics<00:04:06.389> approach<00:04:07.019> we<00:04:07.919> tend<00:04:08.159> to<00:04:08.340> fall<00:04:09.150> back

00:04:09.469 --> 00:04:09.479 
dynamics approach we tend to fall back

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:13.039 
dynamics approach we tend to fall back
to<00:04:10.190> more<00:04:11.190> of<00:04:11.430> a<00:04:11.609> emergent<00:04:12.599> cellular<00:04:13.019> dynamics

to more of a emergent cellular dynamics

rules<00:04:16.229> in<00:04:16.650> just<00:04:17.010> the<00:04:17.099> right<00:04:17.130> way<00:04:17.280> and<00:04:17.519> with<00:04:18.209> the

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:18.269 
rules in just the right way and with the

rules in just the right way and with the
right<00:04:18.389> balances<00:04:18.900> so<00:04:19.500> you<00:04:19.590> get<00:04:19.919> a<00:04:19.949> very<00:04:20.159> complex

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:20.579 
right balances so you get a very complex
