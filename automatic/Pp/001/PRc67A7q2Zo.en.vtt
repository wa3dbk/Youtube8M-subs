the one I use that button to record so

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:48.300 
the one I use that button to record so
that<00:02:45.130> one<00:02:45.340> if<00:02:45.580> u<00:02:45.760> is<00:02:46.510> free<00:02:46.930> you<00:02:47.769> can<00:02:47.800> use<00:02:48.070> it<00:02:48.190> for

that one if u is free you can use it for
such<00:02:48.550> things<00:02:48.580> as<00:02:48.970> if<00:02:49.269> say<00:02:49.660> you're<00:02:49.870> playing<00:02:50.080> a

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:50.140 
such things as if say you're playing a

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.500 
such things as if say you're playing a
warrior<00:02:50.440> and<00:02:50.680> use<00:02:50.769> it<00:02:50.920> for<00:02:51.040> Throwdown<00:02:51.459> and<00:02:51.700> for

warrior and use it for Throwdown and for
my<00:02:52.660> Razer<00:02:52.900> Naga<00:02:53.230> many<00:02:53.709> of<00:02:53.860> you<00:02:54.010> may<00:02:54.250> not<00:02:54.489> have

my Razer Naga many of you may not have
the<00:02:54.910> Razer<00:02:55.120> Naga<00:02:55.360> so<00:02:55.750> that's<00:02:56.140> why<00:02:56.350> this<00:02:56.650> is

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 
the Razer Naga so that's why this is

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.490 
the Razer Naga so that's why this is
optional<00:02:57.220> but<00:02:57.400> I<00:02:57.459> use<00:02:57.760> the<00:02:57.970> 1<00:02:58.180> through<00:02:58.450> 12<00:02:58.780> my

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
optional but I use the 1 through 12 my

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.340 
optional but I use the 1 through 12 my
1/3<00:03:00.250> equals<00:03:00.459> on<00:03:01.000> the<00:03:01.330> keyboard<00:03:01.840> and<00:03:02.019> I<00:03:02.110> use

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 
1/3 equals on the keyboard and I use

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:05.820 
1/3 equals on the keyboard and I use
Shift<00:03:02.680> +<00:03:03.010> Alt<00:03:03.130> +<00:03:03.370> ctrl<00:03:04.000> modifiers<00:03:04.480> to<00:03:05.170> get<00:03:05.380> even

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:05.830 
Shift + Alt + ctrl modifiers to get even

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:07.949 
Shift + Alt + ctrl modifiers to get even
more<00:03:05.980> binds<00:03:06.310> so<00:03:06.910> even<00:03:07.330> more<00:03:07.450> spells<00:03:07.750> so<00:03:07.930> I

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
more binds so even more spells so I

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:10.800 
more binds so even more spells so I
could<00:03:08.170> have<00:03:08.319> one<00:03:08.530> is<00:03:09.340> my<00:03:09.640> kick<00:03:09.970> and<00:03:10.269> then<00:03:10.420> shift

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
could have one is my kick and then shift

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.340 
could have one is my kick and then shift
one<00:03:11.080> is<00:03:11.319> my<00:03:11.620> is<00:03:12.040> my<00:03:12.610> focus<00:03:13.360> kick<00:03:13.750> but<00:03:13.989> I<00:03:14.170> can

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350 
one is my is my focus kick but I can

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:16.319 
one is my is my focus kick but I can
press<00:03:14.560> 1<00:03:14.799> on<00:03:14.829> my<00:03:15.040> race<00:03:15.220> Naga<00:03:15.519> so<00:03:15.790> that<00:03:15.970> frees<00:03:16.180> up

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:16.329 
press 1 on my race Naga so that frees up

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:17.940 
press 1 on my race Naga so that frees up
my<00:03:16.510> movement<00:03:16.930> so<00:03:17.049> I<00:03:17.079> can<00:03:17.260> move<00:03:17.410> around<00:03:17.620> freely

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
my movement so I can move around freely

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:19.770 
my movement so I can move around freely
and<00:03:18.160> still<00:03:18.579> use<00:03:18.820> spells<00:03:19.120> so<00:03:19.390> that's<00:03:19.600> why<00:03:19.750> I

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 
and still use spells so that's why I

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.160 
and still use spells so that's why I
think<00:03:19.959> Razer<00:03:20.680> Naga<00:03:20.890> is<00:03:21.100> probably<00:03:21.340> the<00:03:21.430> best

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
think Razer Naga is probably the best

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.350 
think Razer Naga is probably the best
