offensive<00:01:46.560> line<00:01:46.759> collapses<00:01:47.759> go<00:01:48.659> figure<00:01:49.009> it's

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
offensive line collapses go figure it's

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.920 
offensive line collapses go figure it's
not<00:01:50.159> polymers<00:01:50.579> fault<00:01:50.850> that<00:01:51.060> he<00:01:51.360> was<00:01:51.570> given<00:01:51.750> a

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
not polymers fault that he was given a

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.830 
not polymers fault that he was given a
second<00:01:52.259> or<00:01:52.380> two<00:01:52.409> to<00:01:52.530> throw<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:52.950> ball<00:01:53.840> the

second or two to throw the ball the

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.139 
second or two to throw the ball the
offensive<00:01:55.110> line<00:01:55.290> so<00:01:56.100> it's<00:01:56.399> showing<00:01:57.030> its

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149
