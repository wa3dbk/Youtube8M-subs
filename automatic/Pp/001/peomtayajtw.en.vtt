okay<00:00:07.040> this<00:00:07.550> is<00:00:07.640> a<00:00:07.730> great<00:00:07.970> bridge<00:00:08.270> here<00:00:08.720> the<00:00:09.469> the

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:09.500 
okay this is a great bridge here the the

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.520 
okay this is a great bridge here the the
red<00:00:10.280> bridge<00:00:10.490> is<00:00:10.610> beautiful<00:00:11.030> and<00:00:11.870> but<00:00:12.440> the

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:12.530 
red bridge is beautiful and but the

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:15.160 
red bridge is beautiful and but the
light<00:00:12.680> is<00:00:12.710> kind<00:00:13.010> of<00:00:13.129> patchy<00:00:13.400> so<00:00:13.850> and<00:00:14.150> only<00:00:15.020> one

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:15.170 
light is kind of patchy so and only one

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:17.170 
light is kind of patchy so and only one
side<00:00:15.350> of<00:00:15.410> it<00:00:15.559> has<00:00:15.709> great<00:00:15.860> flowers<00:00:16.309> on<00:00:16.460> it<00:00:16.490> so

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:17.180 
side of it has great flowers on it so

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:19.330 
side of it has great flowers on it so
this<00:00:17.330> is<00:00:17.360> a<00:00:17.480> perfect<00:00:18.230> candidate<00:00:18.650> for<00:00:18.710> a<00:00:18.949> mirror

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:19.340 
this is a perfect candidate for a mirror

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:21.189 
this is a perfect candidate for a mirror
image<00:00:19.610> so<00:00:20.300> I'm<00:00:20.390> going<00:00:20.449> to<00:00:20.630> shoot<00:00:20.750> half<00:00:21.050> the

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:21.199 
image so I'm going to shoot half the

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:23.980 
image so I'm going to shoot half the
bridge<00:00:21.759> five-shot<00:00:22.759> HDR<00:00:23.300> to<00:00:23.420> bring<00:00:23.599> in<00:00:23.720> all<00:00:23.869> the

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:23.990 
bridge five-shot HDR to bring in all the

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.200 
bridge five-shot HDR to bring in all the
detail<00:00:24.380> everywhere<00:00:24.769> and<00:00:25.130> then<00:00:25.789> doran

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:26.210 
detail everywhere and then doran

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:28.839 
detail everywhere and then doran
processing<00:00:26.929> I<00:00:27.109> will<00:00:27.710> actually<00:00:28.070> mirror<00:00:28.519> that

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:28.849 
processing I will actually mirror that

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:31.689 
processing I will actually mirror that
to<00:00:29.089> create<00:00:29.419> the<00:00:29.749> same<00:00:30.019> size<00:00:30.259> bridge<00:00:30.619> but<00:00:31.550> with

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:31.699 
to create the same size bridge but with

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:34.300 
to create the same size bridge but with
the<00:00:31.789> flowers<00:00:32.240> on<00:00:32.390> both<00:00:32.599> sides<00:00:32.870> and<00:00:33.230> also<00:00:34.160> the

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:34.310 
the flowers on both sides and also the

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:35.650 
the flowers on both sides and also the
right<00:00:34.460> side<00:00:34.640> of<00:00:34.700> the<00:00:34.760> bridge<00:00:34.880> is<00:00:35.090> obstructed

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:35.660 
right side of the bridge is obstructed

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:37.869 
right side of the bridge is obstructed
but<00:00:36.470> if<00:00:36.590> I<00:00:36.680> mirror<00:00:37.010> the<00:00:37.219> good<00:00:37.399> side<00:00:37.610> it<00:00:37.789> would

00:00:37.869 --> 00:00:37.879 
but if I mirror the good side it would

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:41.200 
but if I mirror the good side it would
be<00:00:38.000> a<00:00:38.030> full<00:00:38.469> full<00:00:39.469> frame<00:00:39.770> red<00:00:40.070> bridge<00:00:40.340> so<00:00:41.180> i

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:41.210 
be a full full frame red bridge so i

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:42.790 
be a full full frame red bridge so i
will<00:00:41.390> do<00:00:41.510> that<00:00:41.690> now<00:00:41.899> got<00:00:42.140> good<00:00:42.379> reflection

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800 
will do that now got good reflection

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.439 
will do that now got good reflection
good<00:00:43.340> color<00:00:43.640> and<00:00:44.559> we're<00:00:45.559> almost<00:00:45.770> level<00:00:46.449> there

00:00:47.439 --> 00:00:47.449 
good color and we're almost level there

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:49.150 
good color and we're almost level there
we<00:00:47.690> go<00:00:47.870> good<00:00:48.079> yeah<00:00:48.230> that's<00:00:48.320> tremendous<00:00:48.980> and

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:49.160 
we go good yeah that's tremendous and

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.939 
we go good yeah that's tremendous and
we'll<00:00:49.340> just<00:00:49.960> bring<00:00:50.960> it<00:00:51.079> up<00:00:51.170> one-third<00:00:51.739> there

00:00:51.939 --> 00:00:51.949 
we'll just bring it up one-third there

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:56.200 
we'll just bring it up one-third there
we<00:00:52.039> go<00:00:52.930> and<00:00:53.930> that's<00:00:54.320> our<00:00:54.469> five<00:00:54.710> shot<00:00:54.980> HDR<00:00:55.519> and

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.210 
we go and that's our five shot HDR and

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.340 
we go and that's our five shot HDR and
have<00:00:56.390> a<00:00:56.420> look<00:00:56.629> at<00:00:56.750> it<00:00:56.920> that's<00:00:57.920> way<00:00:58.280> over<00:00:59.350> way

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 
have a look at it that's way over way

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.049 
have a look at it that's way over way
under<00:01:00.739> and<00:01:01.719> right<00:01:02.719> on<00:01:02.750> let's<00:01:03.469> take<00:01:03.679> it<00:01:03.800> down

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.059 
under and right on let's take it down

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:08.320 
under and right on let's take it down
one<00:01:05.059> more<00:01:05.089> third<00:01:05.510> of<00:01:05.630> a<00:01:05.690> stop<00:01:05.960> and<00:01:06.970> shoot<00:01:07.970> one

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 
one more third of a stop and shoot one

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.200 
one more third of a stop and shoot one
more<00:01:08.630> just<00:01:08.780> for<00:01:08.840> good<00:01:09.050> measure<00:01:09.110> and<00:01:10.090> again<00:01:11.090> its

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
more just for good measure and again its

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.050 
more just for good measure and again its
own<00:01:11.360> continuous<00:01:11.870> high<00:01:12.110> with<00:01:13.010> a<00:01:13.040> higher<00:01:13.340> ISO

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 
own continuous high with a higher ISO

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:19.120 
own continuous high with a higher ISO
and<00:01:15.880> a<00:01:16.880> little<00:01:17.090> lower<00:01:17.380> f-stop<00:01:18.380> we<00:01:18.890> don't<00:01:18.980> need

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
and a little lower f-stop we don't need

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.120 
and a little lower f-stop we don't need
f-22<00:01:19.760> we<00:01:19.940> don't<00:01:20.120> need<00:01:20.300> iso<00:01:20.720> 200<00:01:21.350> and<00:01:21.830> we<00:01:21.980> need

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
f-22 we don't need iso 200 and we need

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:23.260 
f-22 we don't need iso 200 and we need
these<00:01:22.190> things<00:01:22.250> of<00:01:22.550> fire<00:01:22.730> off<00:01:22.940> in<00:01:23.060> a<00:01:23.120> hurry

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
these things of fire off in a hurry

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.570 
these things of fire off in a hurry
against<00:01:23.510> is<00:01:23.630> moving<00:01:23.960> water<00:01:24.200> and<00:01:24.470> if<00:01:25.400> the

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:25.580 
against is moving water and if the

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.280 
against is moving water and if the
exposures<00:01:26.030> are<00:01:26.120> very<00:01:26.300> long<00:01:26.570> it<00:01:26.900> looks<00:01:27.080> kind<00:01:27.260> of

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.290 
exposures are very long it looks kind of

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:28.870 
exposures are very long it looks kind of
weird<00:01:27.380> so<00:01:27.680> I<00:01:27.740> want<00:01:27.890> to<00:01:27.950> get<00:01:28.010> really<00:01:28.250> rapid<00:01:28.670> fire

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
weird so I want to get really rapid fire

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.750 
weird so I want to get really rapid fire
exposures<00:01:29.480> and<00:01:29.770> that<00:01:30.770> appears<00:01:31.190> to<00:01:31.340> be<00:01:31.490> what's

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:31.760 
exposures and that appears to be what's

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.930 
exposures and that appears to be what's
going<00:01:32.000> on<00:01:32.150> here<00:01:32.360> so<00:01:32.510> that's<00:01:32.660> good<00:01:32.870> 23<00:01:33.800> all<00:01:34.070> the

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:34.940 
going on here so that's good 23 all the

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.150 
going on here so that's good 23 all the
shadows<00:01:35.330> are<00:01:35.360> in<00:01:35.630> all<00:01:35.930> the<00:01:36.500> highlights<00:01:36.680> are<00:01:37.010> in

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:37.160 
shadows are in all the highlights are in

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:42.160 
shadows are in all the highlights are in
and<00:01:37.400> that'll<00:01:38.150> look<00:01:38.300> good<00:01:38.750> and<00:01:38.900> post<00:01:40.990> okay<00:01:41.990> one

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
and that'll look good and post okay one

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:43.630 
and that'll look good and post okay one
more<00:01:42.350> shot<00:01:42.650> here<00:01:42.830> before<00:01:43.010> we<00:01:43.100> get<00:01:43.220> out<00:01:43.280> of<00:01:43.520> here

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
more shot here before we get out of here

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.000 
more shot here before we get out of here
it's<00:01:43.790> basically<00:01:44.180> the<00:01:44.300> same<00:01:44.540> red<00:01:44.810> bridge<00:01:45.110> but

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:46.010 
it's basically the same red bridge but

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:48.100 
it's basically the same red bridge but
the<00:01:46.730> water<00:01:46.940> is<00:01:47.060> very<00:01:47.180> smooth<00:01:47.540> right<00:01:47.750> now<00:01:47.900> and<00:01:48.020> I

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
the water is very smooth right now and I

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.680 
the water is very smooth right now and I
can<00:01:48.230> do<00:01:48.290> a<00:01:48.350> real<00:01:48.530> nice<00:01:48.770> telephoto<00:01:49.340> pan<00:01:49.760> going

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:50.690 
can do a real nice telephoto pan going

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:52.990 
can do a real nice telephoto pan going
across<00:01:50.930> having<00:01:51.830> trees<00:01:52.070> on<00:01:52.220> both<00:01:52.280> sides<00:01:52.670> all

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
across having trees on both sides all

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.580 
across having trees on both sides all
the<00:01:53.150> stuff<00:01:53.360> in<00:01:53.480> the<00:01:53.540> middle<00:01:53.810> and<00:01:54.320> I<00:01:54.410> gotta

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
the stuff in the middle and I gotta

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:02.450 
the stuff in the middle and I gotta
hurry<00:01:54.770> get<00:01:55.010> windy<00:01:57.370> one<00:01:58.960> two<00:02:00.640> three
