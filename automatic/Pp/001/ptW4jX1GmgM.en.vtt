00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:14.879
 jesolo at a distance from the review 

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:21.529

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:23.480

 the nation exact time 4 40 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:32.230
 and obviously he buys navigator also for europe 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:38.050
 and the novelties are these icon places among the applications in so now we have 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:44.390

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.640

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:24.539
 so all the icons related to maps are biting 

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:29.499
 on the subdivision cap. they will be ridiculed when we install the 

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:31.390

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.930
 we will need a list of friends 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.299

00:02:08.299 --> 00:02:09.779
 a kick 

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:12.889

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:47.489
 1 things categories 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:50.489

00:03:11.689 --> 00:03:14.429
 comments 

00:03:14.429 --> 00:03:18.259
 here is how you have all been very interesting as it will provide 

00:03:18.779 --> 00:03:20.249
 also 

00:03:20.249 --> 00:03:23.499
 comments earth encarta is the ex 

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:25.800
 on the locations 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.099
 we're going to see 

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:30.520
 I said another thing that is worth going to 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:32.189
 sizing 

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:35.560
 we have the GPS mode is active 

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:39.929
 so let's go to contacts 

00:03:39.929 --> 00:03:42.929
 Marco - 

00:03:44.929 --> 00:03:48.239
 sunbeach ita destination 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:51.569
 ebay i love you panettone with destination 

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:56.560
 as you can see the gps stage accept the connection 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:59.169
 I was 

00:03:59.169 --> 00:04:02.169
 my name is an address 

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:06.349
 random 

00:04:07.219 --> 00:04:10.059
 turin castle 

00:04:10.059 --> 00:04:13.399
 the center of turin esse3 maps google maps navigation 

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:17.590
 processes driving directions 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:21.650
 but apparently d graphics changes by itself that why 

00:04:22.189 --> 00:04:26.090
 otherwise the relationship already tried by me seems identical 

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:28.870
 &amp; lt anyway 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:33.210
 channel 4 40 million google maps started to be 

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:37.510
 almost best navigator available on rem 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:42.410
 eastern fund we consider fact that 123 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:44.930
 milan 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:48.760
 therefore, data connection needs to work abroad is a bit difficult 

00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:49.979
 use it 

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:53.869
 and is inclined towards solutions such as the sygic hop film 

00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:58.409
 when I surf 

00:04:58.409 --> 00:05:02.249
 so now we have alice modem or gps signal here 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:10.230
 good under a roof so not having gps coverage let's host and say 

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:10.880
 that 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:17.220
 one of the best scop navigators really works on his Italian 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:18.849
 when 

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:22.279
 we can use our sadistic data connection 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:29.409
 by jesolo it's all% I hope to find myself on a little global world.it continues to 

00:05:29.409 --> 00:05:30.500
 follow us and happy holidays
