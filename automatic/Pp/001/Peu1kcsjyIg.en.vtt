00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
 g through the links that I will put in the 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.350
 description too so it's very simple 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.540
 it's a disk image you once 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.540
 downloaded want to double click 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:16.650
 above to open it so we wait for the 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.369
 checking - junior because I want 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.560
 that it goes faster 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.510
 and there we end up with one with a 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.710
 installer there is nothing else to do 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.920
 than to double click on it 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.390
 frankly it's very simple so good 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.099
 I've already installed the version 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:38.780
 geass but I'm going to do it again 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:38.780
 again so here we wait 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:52.920
 so here once arrived here we put 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:01:01.250
 ignore this version and laon but no 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:01:04.140
 used the present is there we wait 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.489
 so they ask us your word 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:10.410
 password 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:12.240
 we put the password of mak and there we have 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:14.790
 more than wait maybe five 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:18.000
 next minutes on your mac 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.259
 if he goes fast or not so here is once 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.950
 who wrote copy of the current files 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:28.100
 it means everything is good so 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:30.660
 once you have that bah 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:34.440
 here I am just waiting for stops 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:35.520
 who hoists themselves they start like that 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:40.710
 it was going much faster for you 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:42.210
 show here so here now he has 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.710
 installed I really nothing to 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.470
 make 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.670
 engineering nor activation key to put nor 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.040
 nothing so that's good I already 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.050
 windows 7 and windows 8 points a game the 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.060
 already installed so this one so for 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:56.520
 to add just the grace to that 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.650
 we press the most installed windows 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.200
 or any other and this from the dvd or 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:05.100
 So here the image file was bitten has 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:07.290
 continued there he'll check if he finally 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.740
 will he go get in all our our 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.100
 computer 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:13.080
 if we have an operating version he has 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.560
 an operating system that can 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.200
 install 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:19.290
 So is he looking for you if he 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.000
 not find it will have to locate it 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:24.750
 manually so me he found 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.560
 here is just pressed on continue there we 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.960
 remove that we will press on continue 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:33.200
 that's all and take your 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:36.280
 finally your need for windows no 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:39.500
 classified for games that would make a 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:42.260
 configuration with rams to type 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.150
 of use for windows and disk 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.140
 hard all that will make a setting 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.300
 automatic 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:50.000
 but you have to know that we can 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:52.940
 always change it's not it's not 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.280
 finally it's editable what 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.270
 So here I am, I support productivity 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:01.370
 what goes faster I have several 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:03.590
 so go on there how to say 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:06.470
 that you are used to windows 7 and you 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:08.990
 leave it like that either you already have where 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:11.570
 it was on windows 8 and where you want 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:12.260
 and the interface exactly the same as 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:14.120
 windows 8 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.940
 so I want the same as windows 8 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.980
 I press to continue there I put the name 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:21.050
 good me that but eight points again with 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:23.900
 one because I already have there the location 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:24.200
 where the virtual machine is going to be going to be 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.650
 setting 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:29.780
 this is my hard drive all to 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.550
 the space required for the machine 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:32.720
 virtual one only has to press 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:33.650
 continue and I will not do it 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.810
 because I'm going to have a second one 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:39.530
 and it's useless but so here is 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:43.130
 big and now for the cracker and 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:45.380
 well you will need kms picot this 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:48.380
 software so it will have to put it 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:50.930
 on windows and for the crack is 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:53.410
 it is precisely this video that is 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:56.810
 second naive youtube so who you 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:59.420
 will explain in detail this software 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:01.850
 finally there is something installed in it 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:03.470
 all stupid that there is a settle here 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:04.580
 once these are installed 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:07.130
 cracks and avicii so 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:08.420
 So here it is really stupid I 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:11.120
 will all put you in the in the 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:14.350
 description and and then and then it's 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.350
 everything so
