we've<00:01:15.100> got<00:01:15.280> our<00:01:15.310> kind<00:01:15.820> of<00:01:15.909> yield<00:01:16.360> setting<00:01:16.899> and

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.320 
we've got our kind of yield setting and

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:18.780 
we've got our kind of yield setting and
the<00:01:17.439> verticality<00:01:17.920> of<00:01:18.130> the<00:01:18.310> gameplay<00:01:18.729> so

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:18.790 
the verticality of the gameplay so

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:21.569 
the verticality of the gameplay so
suddenly<00:01:19.270> you're<00:01:19.540> able<00:01:19.869> to<00:01:20.049> power<00:01:20.560> jumpin<00:01:21.220> and

00:01:21.569 --> 00:01:21.579 
suddenly you're able to power jumpin and

00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:24.060 
suddenly you're able to power jumpin and
and<00:01:21.789> fluidly<00:01:22.329> move<00:01:22.720> around<00:01:22.960> the<00:01:23.110> levels<00:01:23.530> so

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.070 
and fluidly move around the levels so

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:25.980 
and fluidly move around the levels so
that<00:01:24.100> really<00:01:24.579> works<00:01:24.789> and<00:01:25.000> because<00:01:25.539> all<00:01:25.780> the

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
for securing those drop points what we

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.289 
for securing those drop points what we
wanted<00:02:17.590> to<00:02:17.650> do<00:02:17.890> is<00:02:17.920> we<00:02:18.459> we<00:02:18.760> looked<00:02:18.970> at<00:02:19.120> the

00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:19.299 
wanted to do is we we looked at the

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:22.440 
wanted to do is we we looked at the
whole<00:02:19.720> game<00:02:20.019> and<00:02:20.290> we<00:02:21.250> decided<00:02:21.850> to<00:02:22.239> look

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
whole game and we decided to look

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.449 
whole game and we decided to look
specifically<00:02:23.260> at<00:02:23.380> the<00:02:23.560> pacing<00:02:24.040> of<00:02:24.130> the<00:02:24.190> game

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
specifically at the pacing of the game

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:27.780 
specifically at the pacing of the game
so<00:02:25.090> we<00:02:25.510> really<00:02:25.840> wanted<00:02:26.140> to<00:02:26.260> bring<00:02:26.500> it<00:02:26.709> to<00:02:27.160> that

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
so we really wanted to bring it to that

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.240 
so we really wanted to bring it to that
kind<00:02:27.940> of<00:02:28.060> more<00:02:28.299> visceral<00:02:29.049> and<00:02:29.290> frenetic<00:02:29.650> kind

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:30.250 
kind of more visceral and frenetic kind

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.270 
kind of more visceral and frenetic kind
of<00:02:30.430> paste<00:02:30.730> gameplay<00:02:31.480> so<00:02:31.989> the<00:02:32.319> maps<00:02:32.560> are<00:02:32.769> a<00:02:32.980> lot

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
of paste gameplay so the maps are a lot

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.509 
of paste gameplay so the maps are a lot
tighter<00:02:33.489> the<00:02:33.910> actions<00:02:34.359> a<00:02:34.480> lot<00:02:34.660> sweeter<00:02:35.280> and<00:02:36.280> a

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:36.519 
tighter the actions a lot sweeter and a

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:38.400 
tighter the actions a lot sweeter and a
lot<00:02:36.700> more<00:02:36.850> intense<00:02:37.269> and<00:02:37.930> I<00:02:37.989> think<00:02:38.230> that's

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
lot more intense and I think that's

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.530 
lot more intense and I think that's
really<00:02:39.160> kind<00:02:39.670> of<00:02:39.790> where<00:02:39.970> we've<00:02:40.150> done<00:02:40.359> that

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:40.540 
really kind of where we've done that

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.210 
really kind of where we've done that
because<00:02:40.750> we<00:02:41.049> give<00:02:41.260> you<00:02:41.440> that<00:02:41.650> kind<00:02:41.829> of<00:02:41.950> action

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
because we give you that kind of action

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.849 
because we give you that kind of action
high-octane<00:02:43.060> action<00:02:43.359> and<00:02:44.170> then<00:02:44.440> you<00:02:44.590> have<00:02:44.739> the

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:44.859 
high-octane action and then you have the

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:49.150 
high-octane action and then you have the
Nanosuit<00:02:45.370> abilities<00:02:45.940> on<00:02:46.120> top<00:02:46.299> of<00:02:46.450> that

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.710 

the<00:02:50.160> person<00:02:50.610> we've<00:02:50.760> done<00:02:50.970> is<00:02:51.209> and<00:02:51.420> this<00:02:51.660> is

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
the person we've done is and this is

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.559 
the person we've done is and this is
cryengine<00:02:52.590> three<00:02:52.860> really<00:02:53.280> is<00:02:53.520> its<00:02:54.060> natural

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:54.569 
cryengine three really is its natural

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:57.140 
cryengine three really is its natural
evolution<00:02:55.319> was<00:02:55.650> to<00:02:55.860> take<00:02:56.040> it<00:02:56.250> from<00:02:56.430> the<00:02:56.550> pc<00:02:56.970> and

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
evolution was to take it from the pc and

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.330 
evolution was to take it from the pc and
bring<00:02:57.480> it<00:02:57.569> on<00:02:57.660> to<00:02:57.810> the<00:02:57.930> consult<00:02:58.410> and<00:02:58.590> we
