00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.010 
easiest way possible to jailbreak your
iDevice<00:00:03.780> so<00:00:04.500> it'll<00:00:05.160> take<00:00:05.310> about<00:00:05.460> 30<00:00:06.020> seconds

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
iDevice so it'll take about 30 seconds

iDevice so it'll take about 30 seconds
said<00:00:07.560> most<00:00:08.040> probably<00:00:08.550> but<00:00:09.330> unfortunately<00:00:10.320> it

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
said most probably but unfortunately it

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
different kind of situation so just

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.310
