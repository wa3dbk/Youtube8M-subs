like<00:03:52.299> about<00:03:52.540> this<00:03:52.900> hair<00:03:53.230> is<00:03:53.440> that<00:03:54.340> it<00:03:54.670> frizzes

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790 
up I can't really take that because

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:00.120 
up I can't really take that because
that's<00:03:58.450> not<00:03:58.810> the<00:03:58.870> style<00:03:59.260> that<00:03:59.440> I<00:03:59.650> was<00:03:59.920> going

that's not the style that I was going

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:03.800 
that's not the style that I was going
for<00:04:00.280> I<00:04:00.459> really<00:04:00.579> wanted<00:04:01.120> it<00:04:01.239> to<00:04:01.450> stay<00:04:02.170> wavy<00:04:02.769> so

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
for I really wanted it to stay wavy so

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.479 
for I really wanted it to stay wavy so
that's<00:04:04.810> pretty<00:04:05.049> much<00:04:05.140> all<00:04:05.440> about<00:04:05.980> this<00:04:06.220> hair

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:06.489 
that's pretty much all about this hair

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:12.210 
that's pretty much all about this hair
just<00:04:07.299> it<00:04:08.700> no<00:04:09.700> I<00:04:10.209> would<00:04:11.109> not<00:04:11.230> suggest<00:04:11.470> this<00:04:11.920> hair

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:12.220

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
because like I said it frizzes that's

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:17.940 
because like I said it frizzes that's
the<00:04:16.180> only<00:04:16.419> reason<00:04:16.810> why<00:04:17.169> I<00:04:17.200> wouldn't<00:04:17.739> suggest

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:17.950 
the only reason why I wouldn't suggest

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:20.849 
the only reason why I wouldn't suggest
it<00:04:18.400> but<00:04:18.970> if<00:04:19.239> you<00:04:19.479> don't<00:04:19.810> mind<00:04:19.900> the<00:04:20.320> frizz<00:04:20.590> if

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:20.859 
it but if you don't mind the frizz if

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:22.230 
it but if you don't mind the frizz if
you're<00:04:21.010> one<00:04:21.220> of<00:04:21.250> those<00:04:21.400> people<00:04:21.760> that<00:04:21.820> you<00:04:22.120> just

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
you're one of those people that you just

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.180 
you're one of those people that you just
want<00:04:22.479> to<00:04:22.599> get<00:04:22.720> your<00:04:22.900> paddle<00:04:23.110> brush<00:04:23.410> and<00:04:23.830> just

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.190 
want to get your paddle brush and just

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:27.180 
want to get your paddle brush and just
paddle<00:04:25.060> these<00:04:25.210> paddle<00:04:26.110> brush<00:04:26.320> these<00:04:26.740> curls

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
paddle these paddle brush these curls

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:29.430

out<00:04:27.370> I<00:04:27.880> do<00:04:28.180> not<00:04:28.660> know<00:04:28.870> what<00:04:29.020> it<00:04:29.169> would<00:04:29.260> look

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.440 
out I do not know what it would look

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.950 
out I do not know what it would look
like<00:04:29.500> if<00:04:29.890> you<00:04:30.039> did<00:04:30.250> that<00:04:30.280> so<00:04:31.210> I<00:04:31.240> don't<00:04:31.570> know<00:04:31.690> if

like if you did that so I don't know if

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.659 
like if you did that so I don't know if
the<00:04:32.140> curls<00:04:32.410> will<00:04:32.650> bounce<00:04:32.860> back<00:04:33.010> I<00:04:33.370> don't<00:04:33.550> know

the curls will bounce back I don't know

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:36.420 
the curls will bounce back I don't know
if<00:04:33.940> you<00:04:34.660> know<00:04:34.810> that<00:04:35.229> we<00:04:35.380> really<00:04:35.650> look<00:04:35.860> nice<00:04:36.070> I
