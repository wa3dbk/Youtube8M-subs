work on health and safety around it
because<00:01:10.010> so<00:01:11.010> we<00:01:11.100> looked<00:01:11.280> at<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.670> danger<00:01:12.210> zones

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
because so we looked at the danger zones

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.810 
because so we looked at the danger zones
and<00:01:12.659> in<00:01:12.750> turn<00:01:12.930> I<00:01:13.170> slipped<00:01:13.439> into<00:01:13.619> zones<00:01:13.890> only<00:01:14.700> me

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
and in turn I slipped into zones only me

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.910 
and in turn I slipped into zones only me
and<00:01:14.880> things<00:01:15.180> was<00:01:15.570> that<00:01:15.600> in<00:01:16.500> some<00:01:16.710> of<00:01:16.799> the

interrupt<00:01:20.100> with<00:01:20.729> no<00:01:20.880> control<00:01:21.240> so<00:01:21.990> by<00:01:22.140> using<00:01:22.290> it

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
interrupt with no control so by using it

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.230 
interrupt with no control so by using it
to<00:01:22.590> a<00:01:22.619> ROM<00:01:22.920> as<00:01:23.159> we<00:01:23.430> actually<00:01:23.729> have<00:01:23.850> control<00:01:24.210> of

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
how far the bit drops and the drops

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.370 
how far the bit drops and the drops
halfway<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:27.600> someone<00:01:27.810> goes<00:01:27.930> through<00:01:28.080> and<00:01:28.229> can

halfway and someone goes through and can

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.690 
halfway and someone goes through and can
actually<00:01:28.590> stop<00:01:28.829> up<00:01:28.979> there<00:01:29.159> as<00:01:29.369> opposed<00:01:29.640> to

were<00:01:33.150> working<00:01:33.420> on<00:01:33.479> a<00:01:33.509> research<00:01:33.810> project

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
were working on a research project

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.330 
were working on a research project
weren't<00:01:34.560> you<00:01:34.650> what<00:01:34.799> was<00:01:34.890> that<00:01:35.009> about

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
weren't you what was that about

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.520 
weren't you what was that about
so<00:01:35.909> we<00:01:36.299> were<00:01:36.420> looking<00:01:36.750> at<00:01:36.900> the<00:01:37.140> way<00:01:37.259> in<00:01:37.380> which

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
so we were looking at the way in which

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:38.810 
so we were looking at the way in which
this<00:01:37.770> drug<00:01:38.009> that<00:01:38.189> is<00:01:38.310> currently<00:01:38.610> used<00:01:38.759> to

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
this drug that is currently used to

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.580 
this drug that is currently used to
treat<00:01:39.000> irritable<00:01:39.180> bowel<00:01:39.509> syndrome<00:01:39.540> we<00:01:40.290> wanted

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
treat irritable bowel syndrome we wanted

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.140 
treat irritable bowel syndrome we wanted
to<00:01:40.650> understand<00:01:41.040> the<00:01:41.220> mechanism<00:01:41.759> by<00:01:41.970> which<00:01:42.000> it

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
to understand the mechanism by which it

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.389 
to understand the mechanism by which it
affects<00:01:42.390> human<00:01:43.380> airway<00:01:43.680> cells<00:01:43.920> and<00:01:44.189> we<00:01:44.250> hope

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
affects human airway cells and we hope

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.310 
affects human airway cells and we hope
by<00:01:44.610> understanding<00:01:45.060> that<00:01:45.360> further<00:01:45.720> we<00:01:46.170> might

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
by understanding that further we might

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.139 
by understanding that further we might
be<00:01:46.439> able<00:01:46.560> to<00:01:46.680> find<00:01:47.130> cheaper<00:01:47.729> and<00:01:48.000> more

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
be able to find cheaper and more

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.600 
be able to find cheaper and more
effective<00:01:48.570> treatments<00:01:48.990> for<00:01:49.079> cystic<00:01:49.409> fibrosis

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 
effective treatments for cystic fibrosis

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.490 
effective treatments for cystic fibrosis
because<00:01:50.610> it's<00:01:50.729> a<00:01:50.790> disease<00:01:51.090> that<00:01:51.200> affects<00:01:52.200> over

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
because it's a disease that affects over

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.980 
because it's a disease that affects over
10,000<00:01:53.100> people<00:01:53.250> in<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.549> UK<00:01:53.729> but<00:01:53.990> current

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
10,000 people in the UK but current

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.859 
10,000 people in the UK but current
drugs<00:01:55.439> cost<00:01:55.710> around<00:01:56.280> like<00:01:56.520> 40,000<00:01:57.390> pounds<00:01:57.659> per

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
drugs cost around like 40,000 pounds per

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.230 
drugs cost around like 40,000 pounds per
year<00:01:57.899> per<00:01:58.259> patient<00:01:58.520> and<00:01:59.520> aren't<00:01:59.759> effective<00:02:00.149> on

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
year per patient and aren't effective on

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.850 
year per patient and aren't effective on
your<00:02:00.270> mutation<00:02:00.869> so<00:02:01.079> obviously<00:02:01.409> if<00:02:01.530> we<00:02:01.590> can<00:02:01.740> get

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
your mutation so obviously if we can get

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.380 
your mutation so obviously if we can get
more<00:02:02.009> drugs<00:02:02.280> you've<00:02:02.670> much<00:02:02.850> about<00:02:03.030> to<00:02:03.210> even

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
more drugs you've much about to even

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.050 
more drugs you've much about to even
start<00:02:03.810> doing<00:02:04.049> that<00:02:04.399> I<00:02:05.399> think<00:02:05.610> it<00:02:05.850> kind<00:02:06.030> of

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
start doing that I think it kind of

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.830 
start doing that I think it kind of
stemmed<00:02:06.390> from<00:02:06.560> interested<00:02:07.560> in<00:02:07.649> medicine<00:02:08.099> so

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
stemmed from interested in medicine so

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.690 
stemmed from interested in medicine so
it's<00:02:09.840> such<00:02:10.080> a<00:02:10.110> broad<00:02:10.410> area<00:02:10.770> so<00:02:11.220> I<00:02:11.250> wanted<00:02:11.640> to

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
it's such a broad area so I wanted to

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.410 
it's such a broad area so I wanted to
kind<00:02:11.849> of<00:02:11.879> hone

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
kind of hone

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.510 
kind of hone
in<00:02:12.510> a<00:02:12.660> certain<00:02:13.230> area<00:02:13.440> and<00:02:13.590> like<00:02:13.920> cystic

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
in a certain area and like cystic

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.880 
in a certain area and like cystic
fibrosis<00:02:14.580> is<00:02:15.060> the<00:02:15.540> charity<00:02:16.530> disease<00:02:16.800> that

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
fibrosis is the charity disease that

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.500 
fibrosis is the charity disease that
affects<00:02:17.100> the<00:02:17.160> most<00:02:17.340> people<00:02:17.670> in<00:02:18.060> the<00:02:18.209> UK<00:02:18.360> so

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
affects the most people in the UK so

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.570 
affects the most people in the UK so
that<00:02:18.840> was<00:02:18.990> a<00:02:19.020> really<00:02:19.680> interesting<00:02:19.770> project

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
that was a really interesting project

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.220 
that was a really interesting project
and<00:02:20.670> I<00:02:20.790> was<00:02:20.910> really<00:02:21.180> excited<00:02:21.360> to<00:02:21.900> do<00:02:22.020> that

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
and I was really excited to do that

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.410 
and I was really excited to do that

put into it and the real world
application<00:02:32.550> in<00:02:32.670> cystic<00:02:33.030> fibrosis<00:02:33.060> is<00:02:33.630> very

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
application in cystic fibrosis is very

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.630 
application in cystic fibrosis is very
important<00:02:34.410> to<00:02:34.800> do<00:02:34.890> the<00:02:35.040> work<00:02:35.220> there<00:02:35.459> and

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
important to do the work there and
