00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:07.849
 the gent is fine, fine 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:10.920
 Imagine you doing in beautiful xis melo 

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:13.650
 with a chance to go to the 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:19.830
 summer only one meter person 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:27.199
 stress chain is a pair of 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:32.689
 slippers pencil serrated knife rubber 

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:32.689
 Night and this goes far. 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:39.950
 ok let's start with pencil and eraser 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:43.950
 do the transfer in the middle of the slipper act 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:50.489
 which will serve as a basis for cutting 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:53.850
 then how to do now in tasso 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:58.070
 other generic or mark the points 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.070
 based on the new one I had already done 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:04.910
 a starting point and the end 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:17.950
 If you make a mistake, you can use it to 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:20.190
 use the streak to pay to undo the 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.190
 error 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:32.830
 to make the biggest trace of them is the 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:36.480
 squares to help me with these traits 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:36.480
 It should be fine rules 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.970
 very carefully 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:08.930
 make a sign for autumn with 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:08.930
 very careful 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:16.610
 after you did 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.610
 the basic stroke 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:28.880
 for all the slip of the starting point until 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:28.880
 the point you do not get this 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:37.870
 and it is with the help of the knife you are going to do 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:37.870
 the cut 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:48.109
 very carefully but very careful 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:48.109
 make a cut for everyone, huh? 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.910
 the knife can be replaced by a 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.910
 stiletto 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:17.260
 this is the result of the cut with the 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:21.930
 hot knife or if you want to do 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.930
 not hot glue and if it is 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:30.950
 Today, after you finish cutting 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:34.090
 you can wash or use rubber to 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:37.090
 remove the markings made from can 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.090
 previously 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.129
 I advise you to put the amount for 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:46.159
 all the slippers 

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:47.540
 before passing the glue to feed I do not 

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:50.720
 like the result 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:56.030
 In case you do not like it, you only have to 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:04:01.040
 glue superco cut and press 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:02.750
 lightly to paste and then you will get 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:07.870
 the normal signal 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:11.239
 obviously will contain a short course but 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:12.459
 can be invisible can also be the 

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:15.560
 video 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:21.949
 now comes the most important part that is 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:25.070
 the part of gluing the chain in the slipper 

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:28.340
 this match was to sing very carefully 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:31.760
 because the glue is k quickly then you 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:33.770
 opening it puts a little glue and 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:38.840
 putting a little bit too 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:41.260
 keep getting it to any 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.260
 another thing 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:45.900
 repeat this procedure until the 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:01.490
 this is the partial result 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:04.100
 cut off excess current and make a 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:07.490
 call super glue to fix repeat 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:11.840
 procedure on the other slipper and so on. 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:14.030
 we finished this easy job, right? 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:17.500
 A great tip for summer I hope 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:17.500
 have resisted the block
