00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:07.290
 Time is so water park 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.760
 we go there guys and this circuit the 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.830
 truth that is pretty cool for the subject of 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.780
 that we get underwater and so on and 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.589
 apart it's also pretty nice as well 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.589
 that we go there 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.189
 Let's see if we get the first place 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.189
 as well 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.240
 let's say a couple of coins 

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:31.370
 there is 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:39.329
 excellent here we can crash to 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.940
 push us when we say when 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:45.210
 we have wheels with antigravity 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.350
 if we crash into someone or something 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.250
 let's say we hit a small turbo 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:53.199
 as there but now as the quite 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.460
 innovation not in terms of mario kart and 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:57.219
 the truth that I liked a lot 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:59.079
 that implementation not of antigravity 

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:01.019
 to follow a red wow maintained 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:04.119
 horns do not go bad time to use it 

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:05.560
 bad are out there careful I'm going to 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:06.909
 save in case they throw me blue 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.460
 to see if the boys have been cut and so on 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:11.780
 you can see how cool it destroyed put in 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:16.100
 carme de las malditas azul 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:17.090
 well well the tower is blue outside and my 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.799
 called also is that I was going to 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.470
 advance 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:23.810
 my mother because it was that I can face 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.210
 days you like everything you're comfortable 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.560
 once it's destroyed it's my mother's 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.600
 games that will have made me lose in 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:33.290
 mario kart 7 the points that will have me 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:35.690
 removed incredible 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:38.420
 Morelia there is 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:40.940
 juana rojas name to be able to cover as 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.280
 I say the red ones are hateful 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:47.000
 I think I hate red ones more than 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:49.250
 own blue in mario cardoso 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.990
 Okay we take the horn so I put on 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:54.390
 first smoked from the pump area 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.610
 It's worth the use I will not complicate too much 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.579
 I'm going third today we have that is the first 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.860
 put so let's go there guys be careful 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:04.799
 with good fire is worth this little red 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:09.300
 bad gift burns second air and you take 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:12.630
 friends for me is going to give me has not me 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.130
 come to give the perfect red we adjust 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.440
 a little bit in the curve that you want the 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:19.170
 First 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:21.870
 bomb it worth leaving behind 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.160
 there's the advance of guys here 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.540
 for example, I made myself here and when I hit 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.340
 let's say we've won a small 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:30.920
 turbo because we are with the antigravity 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.050
 so there are two first ways I carry a 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:36.400
 banana ten coins and well there's the 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.400
 first great post
