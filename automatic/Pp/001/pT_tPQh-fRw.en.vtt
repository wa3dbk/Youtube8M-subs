00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.020
 the national government reported that in the 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.059
 next 90 days the system will start 

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:14.309
 biometric in the country that has as 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.590
 purpose to combat smuggling and 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.900
 eliminate the shortage that exists 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.270
 in the country before this measure noticias24 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.910
 consulted the population that they fine-tune about 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.230
 this good thing should not be like that but you have to 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.630
 do it like that because if not while everything 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.529
 the world wants 10 piti of 20 packages and 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.529
 well for it to reach 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:41.670
 good because one buys how to buy what 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.820
 that one wants and the market as it has 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.820
 what to be 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:50.360
 10 minutes 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.280
 flour packages I can buy this 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:56.140
 let me break 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.670
 4 was now 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.550
 and agrees to make queues for 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:02.590
 to be able to buy flour but of things that 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:04.699
 you have to make the same tail that is 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:07.270
 a logical measure 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:09.820
 and it ends with speculation 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.500
 while other respondents are not 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.060
 according to the measure you want 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.929
 implement by the executive 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.899
 national 

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:18.640
 I do not think it's good because I do not 

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:22.450
 you have to buy what you need and 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:24.670
 I imagine that with that chip one is not 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.920
 as registered I buy so many things but 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:31.149
 can not buy more and I think that 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:33.939
 is not normal, because a normal economy does not 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:35.679
 it seems to me well affirmed that it is for 

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:36.969
 combat smuggling and so that 

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:38.510
 people can acquire all the 

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:41.170
 products 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:43.250
 the truth is that I do not think I do not think so 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.200
 because it can not be that a country 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.580
 oil 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.680
 we have living like this from this 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:51.350
 way we are living 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.690
 they do not get milk they do not get this for 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:56.930
 do to buy a simple compote 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:02:00.480
 it has to be a tail 6 compote per 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:03.840
 person then if you have two children 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:07.140
 then what gives him broth of caraota 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:10.489
 every day and if there's no face drop and 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:13.620
 if there is no rice and if there is no if 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:16.830
 oil because for oil you have to be 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.420
 another school and chicken 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.090
 right now there 's everything right now and meat 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.040
 imported and is that but that 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.349
 we are eating us where are they 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.790
 the strawberries here in Venezuela where 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:32.549
 is the cattle they brought from Argentina 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:34.860
 where is where is agriculture the 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:38.180
 famous agriculture here everything is a 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:40.819
 project does not live from project 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:44.120
 no way 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:46.969
 because I think that is, it does not feel 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.879
 a free one is something like a gag like 

00:02:46.969 --> 00:02:53.409
 how good is it divided into many things 

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:53.409
 but that does not agree with me 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:01.440
 I do not think 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:04.599
 I believe that this measure does not lead us to 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:06.190
 that the houses are finished because the 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:08.950
 measures that the government must take to 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:11.110
 it must be smarter or by 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.670
 example if without more raw material if not 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.100
 there are no persons dollars if the 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:18.010
 production you have to look for measures 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:21.370
 that you can have them at the 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:24.670
 people who can, that is, what 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:26.500
 have the production the companies all 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:29.200
 that because if there is no no production 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:32.380
 even if you do not have that measure, no no no 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:34.239
 is going to cabal is almost the same executive 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:36.760
 national seeks to implement the system 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:38.799
 biometric to reduce purchases 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.080
 repeated of the same item on the 

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:43.000
 of a group of people in the last 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.400
 weeks the authorities have assured 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.620
 that the deviation of the 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.660
 with different foods 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.880
 deposits and then sell them to the 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:54.100
 informal economy in the chamber of 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:58.319
