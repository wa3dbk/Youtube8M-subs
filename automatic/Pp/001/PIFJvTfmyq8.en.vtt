00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
so my article this week is basically

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:11.720 
so my article this week is basically
just<00:00:09.750> about<00:00:10.110> how<00:00:10.380> abs<00:00:10.620> in<00:00:10.860> is<00:00:11.070> the<00:00:11.309> best<00:00:11.550> deck

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
just about how abs in is the best deck

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.160 
just about how abs in is the best deck
in<00:00:11.849> the<00:00:11.910> format<00:00:12.269> it's<00:00:12.540> not<00:00:12.719> particularly

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
in the format it's not particularly

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.650 
in the format it's not particularly
close<00:00:13.530> and<00:00:14.099> the<00:00:14.880> decks<00:00:15.059> the<00:00:15.179> people<00:00:15.420> can<00:00:15.540> play

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
close and the decks the people can play

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.269 
close and the decks the people can play
in<00:00:16.020> order<00:00:16.170> to<00:00:16.379> try<00:00:16.560> and<00:00:16.590> beat<00:00:16.770> that<00:00:16.800> strategy

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
in order to try and beat that strategy

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.310 
in order to try and beat that strategy
so<00:00:17.670> the<00:00:17.940> top<00:00:18.119> two<00:00:18.330> are<00:00:18.630> definitely<00:00:18.869> green<00:00:19.140> red

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
so the top two are definitely green red

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
ninth in Grand Prix Providence with a

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.020 
ninth in Grand Prix Providence with a
deck<00:00:36.870> very<00:00:37.140> similar<00:00:37.469> to<00:00:37.530> this<00:00:37.770> and<00:00:38.160> at<00:00:38.730> this

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
deck very similar to this and at this

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.000 
deck very similar to this and at this
time<00:00:39.090> I<00:00:39.300> don't<00:00:39.629> have<00:00:39.780> his<00:00:40.140> exact<00:00:40.500> decklist<00:00:40.860> or

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
time I don't have his exact decklist or

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.299 
time I don't have his exact decklist or
anything<00:00:41.309> but<00:00:41.579> uh<00:00:42.350> I<00:00:43.350> know<00:00:43.770> it's<00:00:43.950> very<00:00:44.100> close

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
anything but uh I know it's very close

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.310 
anything but uh I know it's very close
to<00:00:44.340> this<00:00:44.640> so<00:00:44.940> man<00:00:45.629> race<00:00:45.809> might<00:00:46.050> be<00:00:46.140> different

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
to this so man race might be different

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.360 
to this so man race might be different
side<00:00:46.620> board<00:00:46.829> might<00:00:46.950> be<00:00:47.039> a<00:00:47.070> little<00:00:47.190> bit

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
side board might be a little bit

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.940 
side board might be a little bit
different<00:00:47.730> but<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:48.809> gist<00:00:49.260> is<00:00:49.440> there<00:00:49.620> you<00:00:49.829> know

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
different but the gist is there you know

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.400 
different but the gist is there you know
and<00:00:50.129> I<00:00:50.820> think<00:00:51.230> with<00:00:52.230> his<00:00:52.739> white<00:00:53.039> cards<00:00:53.520> and<00:00:54.410> dig

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
and I think with his white cards and dig

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:56.959 
and I think with his white cards and dig
through<00:00:55.590> times<00:00:55.800> and<00:00:56.309> you<00:00:56.579> know<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.850> dim

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
through times and you know the dim

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.459 
through times and you know the dim
protector<00:00:57.300> death<00:00:57.480> miss<00:00:57.660> Raptor<00:00:57.930> package<00:00:58.260> he's

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
protector death miss Raptor package he's

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.529 
protector death miss Raptor package he's
pretty<00:00:58.859> good<00:00:59.070> against<00:00:59.370> abs<00:00:59.550> in<00:00:59.760> hopefully

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
pretty good against abs in hopefully

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.810 
pretty good against abs in hopefully
we'll<00:01:00.750> be<00:01:00.870> able<00:01:00.899> to<00:01:01.050> figure<00:01:01.260> that<00:01:01.500> out<00:01:01.820> figure

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
we'll be able to figure that out figure

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.640 
we'll be able to figure that out figure
out<00:01:02.940> if<00:01:03.030> that's<00:01:03.210> actually<00:01:03.420> true<00:01:03.600> and<00:01:04.110> then

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
out if that's actually true and then

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.320 
out if that's actually true and then
again<00:01:05.129> screen<00:01:05.369> read<00:01:05.519> devotion<00:01:05.880> and<00:01:06.030> how<00:01:06.090> still

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
again screen read devotion and how still

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.460 
again screen read devotion and how still
these<00:01:06.479> is<00:01:06.630> one<00:01:06.780> of<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:06.930> best<00:01:07.049> cards<00:01:07.260> you<00:01:07.350> could

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
these is one of the best cards you could

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.160 
these is one of the best cards you could
have<00:01:07.619> because<00:01:07.950> they<00:01:08.850> tried<00:01:09.119> to<00:01:09.330> make<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:10.020> ABS

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
have because they tried to make the ABS

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.050 
have because they tried to make the ABS
index<00:01:10.530> cross<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:11.010> fates<00:01:11.220> really<00:01:11.610> awkward<00:01:11.939> by

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
index cross the fates really awkward by

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.880 
index cross the fates really awkward by
having<00:01:12.360> a<00:01:12.479> dragon<00:01:12.930> in<00:01:13.020> play<00:01:13.229> along<00:01:13.560> with<00:01:13.740> all

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
having a dragon in play along with all

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.789 
having a dragon in play along with all
their<00:01:14.010> other<00:01:14.100> creatures<00:01:14.520> so<00:01:15.200> in<00:01:16.200> hostilities

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
their other creatures so in hostilities

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.620 
their other creatures so in hostilities
is<00:01:16.979> basically<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.430> perfect<00:01:17.970> answer<00:01:18.240> there

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
is basically the perfect answer there

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.920 
is basically the perfect answer there
and<00:01:19.189> then<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:21.090> rest<00:01:21.240> of<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.420> sec<00:01:21.600> is<00:01:21.750> just

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
and then the rest of the sec is just

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.590 
and then the rest of the sec is just
motto<00:01:22.290> value<00:01:22.830> for<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.250> most<00:01:23.430> part<00:01:23.670> so<00:01:24.090> you

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
motto value for the most part so you

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.999 
motto value for the most part so you
have<00:01:24.689> disdainful<00:01:25.140> stroke<00:01:25.380> which<00:01:25.560> is<00:01:25.680> really

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
have disdainful stroke which is really

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.070 
have disdainful stroke which is really
really<00:01:26.220> good<00:01:26.460> against<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.030> expense<00:01:27.990> of

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
really good against the expense of

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.810 
really good against the expense of
spells<00:01:28.320> in<00:01:28.439> the<00:01:28.500> format<00:01:28.829> ditto<00:01:29.310> valorous

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
and I'd really like to get a second

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:48.859 
and I'd really like to get a second
haven<00:01:48.000> in<00:01:48.090> here<00:01:48.270> I<00:01:48.299> think<00:01:48.390> that'd<00:01:48.600> be<00:01:48.720> really

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
haven in here I think that'd be really

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.389 
haven in here I think that'd be really
good<00:01:49.079> but<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.380> mana<00:01:49.649> costs<00:01:50.040> are<00:01:50.159> really

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
good but the mana costs are really

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.460 
good but the mana costs are really
prohibitive<00:01:50.909> there's<00:01:51.090> a<00:01:51.149> lot<00:01:51.329> of<00:01:51.360> CC<00:01:51.869> stuff<00:01:52.170> in

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
prohibitive there's a lot of CC stuff in

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.469 
prohibitive there's a lot of CC stuff in
three<00:01:53.189> different<00:01:53.340> colors<00:01:53.490> so<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:54.060> man<00:01:54.210> is<00:01:54.360> not

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
three different colors so the man is not

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.090 
three different colors so the man is not
perfect<00:01:54.930> we<00:01:55.020> could<00:01:55.229> really<00:01:55.350> use<00:01:55.439> a<00:01:55.560> trial<00:01:55.860> and

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
perfect we could really use a trial and

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.429 
perfect we could really use a trial and
but<00:01:56.490> instead<00:01:57.329> we<00:01:57.540> have<00:01:57.630> nine<00:01:57.780> temples<00:01:58.229> and<00:01:58.380> a

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
but instead we have nine temples and a

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.010 
but instead we have nine temples and a
bunch<00:01:58.619> of<00:01:58.710> fetches<00:01:59.009> to<00:01:59.219> try<00:01:59.399> and<00:01:59.689> make<00:02:00.689> that<00:02:00.960> a

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
bunch of fetches to try and make that a

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.249 
bunch of fetches to try and make that a
reality<00:02:01.350> but<00:02:02.570> yeah<00:02:03.570> it's<00:02:03.780> basically<00:02:04.049> yeah

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
reality but yeah it's basically yeah

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.160 
reality but yeah it's basically yeah
this<00:02:04.469> is<00:02:04.619> this<00:02:04.890> is<00:02:05.009> kind<00:02:05.250> of<00:02:05.280> just<00:02:05.460> like<00:02:05.490> a

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
this is this is kind of just like a

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.710 
this is this is kind of just like a
mid-range<00:02:07.170> II<00:02:07.610> control<00:02:08.610> deck<00:02:08.819> with<00:02:09.060> a<00:02:09.090> little

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
mid-range II control deck with a little

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.449 
mid-range II control deck with a little
higher<00:02:09.959> top<00:02:10.319> end<00:02:10.590> than<00:02:10.950> you're<00:02:11.220> used<00:02:11.250> to

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
higher top end than you're used to

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:12.590 
higher top end than you're used to
seeing<00:02:11.640> out<00:02:11.940> of<00:02:12.060> a<00:02:12.120> lot<00:02:12.300> of<00:02:12.390> these

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
seeing out of a lot of these

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.290 
seeing out of a lot of these
decks<00:02:12.810> so<00:02:13.230> I<00:02:13.470> have<00:02:14.310> high<00:02:14.490> hopes<00:02:14.520> for<00:02:14.850> this<00:02:15.000> and

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
decks so I have high hopes for this and

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:16.970 
decks so I have high hopes for this and
I<00:02:15.330> think<00:02:15.390> it<00:02:15.570> could<00:02:15.720> be<00:02:15.810> pretty<00:02:15.960> good<00:02:16.320> you

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
I think it could be pretty good you

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.530 
I think it could be pretty good you
might<00:02:17.100> look<00:02:17.310> at<00:02:17.430> things<00:02:17.670> like<00:02:17.760> valores<00:02:18.210> dancin

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
might look at things like valores dancin

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:19.970 
might look at things like valores dancin
to<00:02:18.660> say<00:02:18.810> disdainful<00:02:19.440> stroke<00:02:19.650> and<00:02:19.800> be<00:02:19.860> like

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
to say disdainful stroke and be like

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.680 
to say disdainful stroke and be like

the engine those those two together are
very<00:02:29.430> very<00:02:29.640> good<00:02:29.970> against<00:02:30.450> red<00:02:30.720> decks<00:02:30.960> so<00:02:31.520> so

very very good against red decks so so
far<00:02:32.850> testing<00:02:33.510> has<00:02:33.690> been<00:02:33.900> not<00:02:34.500> bad<00:02:34.770> not<00:02:35.040> bad<00:02:35.280> at

far testing has been not bad not bad at

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.230 
far testing has been not bad not bad at
all<00:02:35.850> but<00:02:36.240> we<00:02:36.810> can<00:02:36.960> do<00:02:37.050> better<00:02:37.080> I'm<00:02:37.500> sure<00:02:37.770> and<00:02:38.240> as

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240 
all but we can do better I'm sure and as

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:40.940 
all but we can do better I'm sure and as
we<00:02:39.690> go<00:02:39.810> through<00:02:39.990> this<00:02:40.080> video<00:02:40.410> I'm<00:02:40.740> probably

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
we go through this video I'm probably

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.620 
we go through this video I'm probably
going<00:02:41.130> to<00:02:41.280> suggest<00:02:41.490> some<00:02:42.030> changes<00:02:42.390> here<00:02:42.420> and

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
going to suggest some changes here and

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.250 
going to suggest some changes here and
there<00:02:42.780> um<00:02:43.310> I<00:02:44.480> think<00:02:45.480> the<00:02:45.600> Manta<00:02:45.840> base<00:02:45.960> is<00:02:46.140> the

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
there um I think the Manta base is the

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.930 
there um I think the Manta base is the
biggest<00:02:46.590> issue<00:02:46.740> currently<00:02:47.310> because<00:02:47.610> I<00:02:47.730> don't

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
biggest issue currently because I don't

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.150 
biggest issue currently because I don't
know<00:02:48.120> what's<00:02:48.360> actually<00:02:48.570> good<00:02:48.960> I<00:02:49.200> like<00:02:49.890> I<00:02:49.980> said

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
know what's actually good I like I said

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.820 
know what's actually good I like I said
there's<00:02:50.370> a<00:02:50.430> lot<00:02:50.580> of<00:02:50.610> CC<00:02:51.030> stuff<00:02:51.330> and<00:02:51.830> that's

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
there's a lot of CC stuff and that's

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.110 
there's a lot of CC stuff and that's
that's<00:02:53.130> kind<00:02:53.400> of<00:02:53.430> awkward<00:02:53.580> it's<00:02:53.880> a<00:02:53.910> little

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
that's kind of awkward it's a little

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.390 
that's kind of awkward it's a little
scary<00:02:54.420> however<00:02:54.900> you<00:02:55.890> can<00:02:56.010> always<00:02:56.220> put

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
scary however you can always put

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.190 
scary however you can always put
deafness<00:02:56.790> Raptor<00:02:57.060> face<00:02:57.240> down<00:02:57.450> so<00:02:57.720> in<00:02:57.990> reality

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
deafness Raptor face down so in reality

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.190 
deafness Raptor face down so in reality
you<00:02:58.590> only<00:02:58.710> need<00:02:58.950> one<00:02:59.160> green<00:02:59.510> pretty<00:03:00.510> early<00:03:00.870> so

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
you only need one green pretty early so

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.940 
you only need one green pretty early so
on<00:03:01.820> the<00:03:02.820> blue<00:03:03.270> comes<00:03:03.540> pretty<00:03:03.750> late<00:03:04.110> and<00:03:04.650> the

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
on the blue comes pretty late and the

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.190 
on the blue comes pretty late and the
white<00:03:05.250> you<00:03:05.670> know<00:03:05.790> is<00:03:05.910> turn<00:03:06.120> 5<00:03:06.330> in<00:03:06.480> turn<00:03:06.630> 60<00:03:07.080> it's

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
white you know is turn 5 in turn 60 it's

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.920 
white you know is turn 5 in turn 60 it's
like<00:03:07.320> we<00:03:07.440> have<00:03:07.560> some<00:03:07.740> leeway<00:03:07.920> you<00:03:08.310> know<00:03:08.930> so

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
like we have some leeway you know so

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.180 
like we have some leeway you know so
really<00:03:10.110> we<00:03:10.350> only<00:03:10.470> need<00:03:10.710> one<00:03:10.860> of<00:03:10.890> each<00:03:11.010> color

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
really we only need one of each color

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.730 
really we only need one of each color
pretty<00:03:11.490> early<00:03:11.790> and<00:03:11.820> I<00:03:12.030> think<00:03:12.330> my<00:03:13.080> colored

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:13.740 
pretty early and I think my colored

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:16.520 
pretty early and I think my colored
sources<00:03:14.250> are<00:03:14.580> fairly<00:03:15.300> correct<00:03:15.720> for<00:03:15.960> that<00:03:15.990> so

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
sources are fairly correct for that so

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.890 
sources are fairly correct for that so
think<00:03:17.340> this<00:03:17.490> should<00:03:17.610> be<00:03:17.730> ok<00:03:18.030> the<00:03:18.330> sideboard<00:03:18.810> is

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
think this should be ok the sideboard is

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.900 
think this should be ok the sideboard is
kind<00:03:19.140> of<00:03:19.260> the<00:03:19.440> up<00:03:19.770> in<00:03:19.920> the<00:03:20.010> air<00:03:20.130> part<00:03:20.400> where<00:03:20.640> I

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
kind of the up in the air part where I

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.910 
kind of the up in the air part where I
feel<00:03:21.420> like<00:03:21.570> me<00:03:21.750> We<00:03:21.960> Need<00:03:22.080> to<00:03:22.230> plummets<00:03:22.680> for
