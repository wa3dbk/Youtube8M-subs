00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
through the window sometimes they'll

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.979 
through the window sometimes they'll
take<00:00:58.590> a<00:00:58.620> long<00:00:58.859> time<00:00:59.210> this<00:01:00.210> took<00:01:00.329> me<00:01:00.390> actually<00:01:00.780> a

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
take a long time this took me actually a

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.920 
take a long time this took me actually a
long<00:01:01.350> time<00:01:01.590> so<00:01:01.800> I<00:01:01.859> edit<00:01:02.250> it<00:01:02.399> so<00:01:02.579> it<00:01:02.820> didn't<00:01:03.750> seem

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
long time so I edit it so it didn't seem

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.620 
long time so I edit it so it didn't seem
so<00:01:04.140> long<00:01:04.700> yeah<00:01:05.700> it<00:01:05.820> takes<00:01:05.970> a<00:01:06.030> long<00:01:06.090> time<00:01:06.150> you'll

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
so long yeah it takes a long time you'll

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.070 
so long yeah it takes a long time you'll
just<00:01:06.840> jump<00:01:07.110> right<00:01:07.170> between<00:01:07.530> them<00:01:07.799> two<00:01:08.520> little

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:09.080 
just jump right between them two little

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.320 
just jump right between them two little
shade<00:01:10.080> things<00:01:10.549> guess<00:01:11.549> you<00:01:11.670> could<00:01:11.820> say<00:01:11.970> you

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
shade things guess you could say you

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.149 
shade things guess you could say you
want<00:01:12.510> to<00:01:12.540> just<00:01:12.689> walk<00:01:12.900> through<00:01:12.930> this<00:01:13.229> wall<00:01:13.890> here

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.060 
to walk in through this well i'll see if
i<00:01:22.170> could<00:01:22.229> do<00:01:22.380> it<00:01:22.439> again<00:01:22.619> but<00:01:22.860> it<00:01:23.250> won't<00:01:23.400> let<00:01:23.549> me

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
i could do it again but it won't let me

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.300 
i could do it again but it won't let me
yeah<00:01:26.070> this<00:01:26.460> is<00:01:26.580> glitch<00:01:26.790> i<00:01:27.380> only<00:01:28.380> works<00:01:28.560> on<00:01:28.770> GTA

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040 
walk through the door and then you can

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.630 
walk through the door and then you can
walk<00:01:49.160> down<00:01:49.310> this<00:01:49.490> hallway<00:01:50.470> um<00:01:51.470> if<00:01:51.770> you<00:01:52.460> weren't

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:52.640 
walk down this hallway um if you weren't

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.070 
walk down this hallway um if you weren't
in<00:01:52.850> the<00:01:52.940> glitch<00:01:53.120> it<00:01:53.300> wouldn't<00:01:53.630> let<00:01:53.690> you<00:01:53.840> it<00:01:53.960> on

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:54.080 
in the glitch it wouldn't let you it on

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.469 
in the glitch it wouldn't let you it on
this<00:01:54.200> hallway<00:01:54.560> and<00:01:54.850> it's<00:01:55.850> pretty<00:01:56.060> interesting

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
this hallway and it's pretty interesting

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:58.900 
this hallway and it's pretty interesting
because<00:01:57.010> there's<00:01:58.010> a<00:01:58.070> bunch<00:01:58.280> of<00:01:58.400> signs<00:01:58.610> and

00:01:58.900 --> 00:01:58.910 
because there's a bunch of signs and

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:03.430 
because there's a bunch of signs and
stuff<00:01:59.210> like<00:01:59.570> that<00:01:59.870> one<00:02:00.760> that<00:02:01.930> you<00:02:02.930> wouldn't

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:03.440 
stuff like that one that you wouldn't

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.820 
stuff like that one that you wouldn't
normally<00:02:03.590> see<00:02:04.070> so<00:02:04.550> it's<00:02:05.119> like<00:02:05.270> if<00:02:05.960> they<00:02:06.560> knew

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830 
normally see so it's like if they knew

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.249 
normally see so it's like if they knew
you're<00:02:07.100> gonna<00:02:07.310> get<00:02:07.490> in<00:02:07.640> there<00:02:07.820> or<00:02:08.060> I<00:02:08.450> don't

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:09.259 
you're gonna get in there or I don't

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.170 
you're gonna get in there or I don't
know<00:02:09.410> it's<00:02:09.590> just<00:02:09.679> really<00:02:09.920> really<00:02:10.550> weird<00:02:10.940> that

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
know it's just really really weird that

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:12.460 
know it's just really really weird that
they<00:02:11.270> would<00:02:11.420> put<00:02:11.600> signs<00:02:11.840> back<00:02:12.080> here<00:02:12.290> that

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
they would put signs back here that

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.229 
they would put signs back here that
you're<00:02:13.459> not<00:02:13.640> supposed<00:02:13.820> to<00:02:14.000> be<00:02:14.120> back<00:02:14.300> there

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239 
you're not supposed to be back there

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:19.120 
you're not supposed to be back there
also<00:02:17.239> I<00:02:17.570> know<00:02:17.720> there's<00:02:18.350> a<00:02:18.709> part<00:02:18.980> in<00:02:19.070> the

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
also I know there's a part in the

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.550
