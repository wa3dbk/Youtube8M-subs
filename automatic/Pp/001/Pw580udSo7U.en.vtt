00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 animal protection wants one 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:04.230
 general ban comes on the pheasants 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.910
 hunt 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.069
 Research has shown that there is in us 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.230
 thousands of pheasants become illegal 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.490
 bred for pleasure hunting 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.259
 to map that situation 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.830
 animal protection has a reporting point 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.870
 opened 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.439
 eyewitnesses can report the abuses to the 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.789
 van zanten yacht reported day and night 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:22.619
 the animal protection is illegal 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.550
 gambling of van zanten at a time on 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.140
 rail 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.119
 the organization is often tipped by 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.949
 residents of rural areas 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.810
 they regularly see inexplicable 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.880
 changes in the number of zanten 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.430
 in an environment that is to be turned off which 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.530
 are bred here at office atari and 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.450
 grown and plotted and the arrow up 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.950
 externally some they shoot 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.540
 give the wine to confess the week 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.430
 then they come again with that box and that 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.500
 and those and those people and again the whole 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.820
 field full of cogwheel it 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.800
 that you get a bad want for this 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.539
 each other following this kind 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.910
 the animal protection went on 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.489
 were investigated in three provinces 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.070
 25 illegal breeding farms alone were discovered 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.379
 with thousands of zanten turning it off 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.539
 of these birds for yachting is 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.220
 does rule rather than exception 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.049
 even official gamekeepers 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.920
 are guilty of this on a large scale 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.840
 practices 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.760
 mind you that people are actually the 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.140
 keep an eye on hunting 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.610
 we like that with people like that 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.380
 santeria found true even 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.970
 fifteen hundred pheasants are bred 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:22.140
 that is of course ridiculous and 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.850
 huge and we also heard that 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.439
 those people who just like santen 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.310
 stake out for hunting while it 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.520
 is forbidden 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.720
 it is estimated that half of the 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.880
 250,000 of zanten serve us every year 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.920
 land are shot from 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.479
 illegal from santeria de 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.670
 animal protection thinks that the government 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.500
 we must immediately intervene in one 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.909
 letter to the state secretary faber 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.040
 we asked the van santen yacht 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.119
 to stop only by banning the 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.740
 silence the hunt 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.509
 will deport it illegally and hunt 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.770
 then will stop 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.049
 on the other hand we ask the whole 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.939
 Dutch public to help us to 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.829
 locations of van santeria so before 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:02:00.530
 companies for van santen 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:03.530
 the number of the reporting point is 070 3142 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.530
 812
