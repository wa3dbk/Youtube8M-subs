00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
called the touchstone which is what this

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.720 
called the touchstone which is what this
base<00:00:39.329> station<00:00:39.780> is<00:00:39.930> now<00:00:40.530> wire<00:00:40.920> plugs<00:00:41.399> into<00:00:41.550> the

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
base station is now wire plugs into the

base station that plugs into an AC
adapter<00:00:43.469> and<00:00:44.190> then<00:00:44.610> you<00:00:44.879> use<00:00:45.059> a<00:00:45.090> special

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
adapter and then you use a special

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.840 
adapter and then you use a special
backplate<00:00:46.200> it<00:00:46.860> goes<00:00:47.100> on<00:00:47.190> to<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.430> touchstone

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
backplate it goes on to the touchstone

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.479 
backplate it goes on to the touchstone
and<00:00:48.090> that's<00:00:48.270> how<00:00:48.450> it<00:00:48.600> charges<00:00:49.140> now<00:00:49.950> palm<00:00:50.219> did<00:00:50.430> a

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
and that's how it charges now palm did a

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:51.979 
and that's how it charges now palm did a
really<00:00:50.670> good<00:00:50.879> job<00:00:50.940> with<00:00:51.180> this<00:00:51.449> touchstone

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
really good job with this touchstone

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.779 
really good job with this touchstone
because<00:00:52.289> it<00:00:52.410> only<00:00:52.559> had<00:00:52.770> to<00:00:52.800> design<00:00:53.070> it<00:00:53.399> for<00:00:53.430> one

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
because it only had to design it for one

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.910 
because it only had to design it for one
product<00:00:54.300> not<00:00:54.780> even<00:00:55.050> its<00:00:55.199> entire<00:00:55.530> line<00:00:55.890> of

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
product not even its entire line of

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.830 
product not even its entire line of
products<00:00:56.460> which<00:00:56.640> would<00:00:56.820> even<00:00:57.120> be<00:00:57.270> kind<00:00:57.750> of

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
products which would even be kind of

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.200 
products which would even be kind of
easy<00:00:58.020> just<00:00:58.710> for<00:00:58.859> one<00:00:59.039> product<00:00:59.579> so<00:00:59.969> a<00:01:00.000> new

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
easy just for one product so a new

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.970 
easy just for one product so a new
exactly<00:01:00.629> what<00:01:00.719> it<00:01:00.809> needed<00:01:00.960> to<00:01:01.050> do<00:01:01.260> and<00:01:01.440> it<00:01:01.829> did

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
exactly what it needed to do and it did

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.160 
exactly what it needed to do and it did
a<00:01:02.010> pretty<00:01:02.280> good<00:01:02.460> job<00:01:02.520> with<00:01:02.730> that<00:01:02.940> so<00:01:03.930> there's<00:01:04.080> a

use this so let's just saw it take a

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.590 
use this so let's just saw it take a
look<00:01:25.770> at<00:01:25.950> what<00:01:26.159> what<00:01:26.790> do<00:01:26.880> you<00:01:26.939> exactly<00:01:27.060> get

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
look at what what do you exactly get

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.740 
look at what what do you exactly get
with<00:01:27.750> a<00:01:27.780> wild<00:01:28.200> charge<00:01:28.409> you<00:01:28.710> make<00:01:29.360> so<00:01:30.360> you<00:01:30.450> can

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.899 

so<00:01:36.930> it's<00:01:37.049> really<00:01:37.259> pretty<00:01:37.409> simple<00:01:37.530> here<00:01:38.490> is<00:01:38.729> the

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
so it's really pretty simple here is the

some<00:02:09.149> books<00:02:10.009> anyway<00:02:11.009> so<00:02:12.140> basically<00:02:13.140> how<00:02:13.410> this

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
some books anyway so basically how this

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.160 
some books anyway so basically how this
works<00:02:13.950> is<00:02:14.220> you're<00:02:15.150> going<00:02:15.300> to<00:02:15.360> plug<00:02:15.780> that<00:02:15.810> in

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
works is you're going to plug that in

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.010 
works is you're going to plug that in
and<00:02:16.350> then<00:02:16.740> use<00:02:17.250> an<00:02:17.550> adaptor<00:02:18.210> to<00:02:18.240> attach<00:02:18.780> to

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
and then use an adaptor to attach to

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.540 
and then use an adaptor to attach to
your<00:02:19.110> phone<00:02:19.410> and<00:02:19.680> then<00:02:19.740> you're<00:02:20.220> going<00:02:20.310> to<00:02:20.370> be<00:02:20.520> a

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.270 
your phone and then you're going to be a
little<00:02:20.790> less<00:02:21.660> give<00:02:21.900> that<00:02:22.050> a<00:02:22.080> little<00:02:22.290> demo<00:02:22.710> all

bit<00:02:28.500> hard<00:02:28.830> to<00:02:28.890> tell<00:02:29.220> but<00:02:29.430> the<00:02:29.550> battery

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
bit hard to tell but the battery

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.550 
bit hard to tell but the battery
indicator<00:02:30.420> it's<00:02:30.750> actually<00:02:31.110> pretty<00:02:31.320> much
