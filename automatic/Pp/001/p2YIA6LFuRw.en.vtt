00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.330
 that the train had to brake and not 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:12.420
 I was braking this is a personal opinion what 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.759
 he hears the train came fast because 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.740
 in moron they had said it was fast 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.150
 then they changed and said it was a 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.410
 normal train that stopped at all 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:23.220
 stations put people went back to 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:25.859
 climb again saved and went fast and 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.300
 when I was not doing that for one that 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.010
 he travels all day he realizes that he 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.410
 they bring sometimes the event comes later 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.090
 it came quickly what caught my attention 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.880
 to me that as it was 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.500
 approaching the station did not come with that 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.100
 speed vittek you realize you're going 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:44.370
 braking and half quick and suddenly 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.780
 well do not imagine it was not going to crash either 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.210
 seen nor the previous situations 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.879
 I had stopped in a little horse in flowers 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.620
 they say yes because they went from that fast to a 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.730
 normal train that stopped all 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.160
 seasons 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.860
 after me 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.390
 I could recover and help some 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:01.640
 people of a poor lady who 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:04.339

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.140
 scared people we started to walk good 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:07.940

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.040
 some images that I do not know if you 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.770

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:15.500
 terrible more than everything in the first and 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.400
 second car people usually always 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.660

 I could not go out and dress if there are people 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:33.480
 that got stuck with the seats there 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.310
 people that were seen and an image that 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:39.430
 I did not forget that there is a person who 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:45.550

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.619

 Let's see if he can show us 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:26.379
 these were the first moments not 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.379
 to know with them so that a little 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.090
 that's the people who were already going down 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:39.870
 all this is something first I more or less 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.870

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:48.920
 I do not know if you can yes perfectly 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.920

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.930
 h of seats removed, including 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.760
 a lot of people are something cell phones are 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.629
 it started 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.629
 the space behind 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:12.310
 they were asking him questions 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:14.570
 completely in the wagon 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:17.060
 it came very well takes us with the first 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:20.020
 as always there is one that 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:24.810
 I do not know if I have it here 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:24.810
 for the advancement not on 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:33.430

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:33.430
 boy over there 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:46.820
 these are the moments after there is a 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:51.350
 trapped person 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:51.350
 it is probable that he is deceased 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:57.140
 I do not know if you can say the place where 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:58.840
 are the two wagons where the second 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:00.819
 of the first 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.540
 and where I traveled the most 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:03.540
 Clients 3 

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:17.240
 and I'm a trapped agent 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:23.669
 a passenger who is showing his 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.139
 children 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:29.790
 in this place is more than all the people 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:31.569
 which it is after the occurrence of the 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:34.539
 accident 

00:04:31.569 --> 00:04:35.860
 and also showing how that passage was 

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:37.419
 a person trapped and how had 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:41.039
 stayed the state is going man was coming 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:41.039
 full of passengers 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:47.009
 this fantastic really the possibility 

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:49.050
 what are the technologies that a 

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:50.759
 person that in this case are about 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:53.759
 the accident can show us in this 

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:56.210
 very precise instant what with your 

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:56.210
 cell phone 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:01.940
 and good and register a person 

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:04.800
 particularly trapped that intuits 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:06.720
 can be one of the fatal victims 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.740
 because I was really in a world 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:09.750
 complicated 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:12.330
 Bernard 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:15.060
 if I will ask how does he usually travel 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:17.190
 how many people enter more or less in 

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:18.660
 every wagon when it comes like this full of 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:20.460
 people 

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:22.740
 if you have more or less idea of ​​how many 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:25.650
 people could get to come traveling 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:28.350
 inside the car you do not see in this 13 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:30.450
 characterizes 20 to come 

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:32.980
 always more than what has to come 

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:36.270
 it makes that already 

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:39.340
 already normal that is sad to say but 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:40.930
 this boy who is here came with the 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:43.180
 bike 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:44.860
 the bicycle was thus 10 centimeters 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:47.560
 of crushing one of the three together 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:50.500
 he came out he could escape they were 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:51.960
 asking is the bicycle but it was 

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:53.880
 crushed 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:57.180
 how many how many wagons did the 

00:05:53.880 --> 00:06:00.110
 formation of this one pays attention 

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:00.110
 to those vital things 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:04.440
 many thanks 

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:07.240
 good they take someone else 

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:10.560
 apparently with him 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:10.560
 with a state of seriousness 

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:17.130
 if worse than him
