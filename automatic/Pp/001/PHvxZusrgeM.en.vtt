00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 what 3 friends I believe that if nintendo 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.850
 did not do his lecture live 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:06.629
 in front of an audience but preferred to do it 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.639
 on the Internet 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.010
 it was really out of the mass 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.250
 we had a lot of information about 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.269
 pokemon rubio mega sapphire alpha 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:17.699
 especially that this trailer 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.770
 beautiful we see a little boy who 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.779
 crosses an island that discovers an island 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.980
 an ancient cave with inscriptions 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.750
 he will fly away 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.119
 it's really like that we imagine 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.650
 pokemon against play they really 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.449
 managed to transcribe that we almost 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:34.290
 want a movie at the level of 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:37.110
 information no we already know that genco 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.910
 llagonne braz and gally mega evolved on 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.610
 saw it in coro coro good this 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.219
 version of the scenes in game 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.649
 we know that megan genco is not a rat 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.620
 the type of aragon that my guys at the 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:51.870
 grolle him anyway sacred 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:55.289
 testosterone and for my guys brazillier 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.660
 we already knew it looked like 2 megabits m6 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:00.329
 then presented that coro coro the 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.910
 present good I imagine it's like 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.519
 usually nintendo thinks that europe 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.600
 the bitters the Americans do not know 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.170
 what is happening in japan 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.670
 so my for the blow they did not do 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.150
 in the trailer they did his body 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:18.240
 at the clock you see nothing exceptional 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:21.509
 by whom the rodia now more 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.400
 nice here the mega evolution to create 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.439
 a time is not really a 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.570
 it's another name it's called the premium 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:31.070
 to the resurgences the region lists 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.700
 primitive damn place the name for 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:36.000
 primo created org 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.970
 he has that is the electric type that is 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.619
 effective on the ground so not a type 1 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.930
 an attack so it's still 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:46.049
 damn class for big dole yes 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.159
 which him the type fire so no 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:49.500
 wrong is the least 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:52.710
 they are much bigger and a lot 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:55.140
 more class 1 on the official website by 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.240
 against little mystery we have four slots 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.700
 we will have you necessarily but beware of 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.829
 gaza the other two lots are not sure 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.700
 too much so is these mega lazio under 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:07.970
 it's a fourth place a no I'm kidding 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.099
 we do not know how unlikely 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.000
 it would be a nice surprise no 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:13.379
 on the other hand what is interesting with 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.540
 the bonus to people is that it's worth 

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:17.340
 still a universe including the 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:21.030
 possibility that fossils and also 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:23.370
 their primitive evolution look on 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.720
 had then armado will sign these 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.670
 relics by burying fossil so this is 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.819
 still possible that they have them 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:33.510
 also entitled to a resonance bonus 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:35.970
 we do not know how to have for the 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:38.790
 bad guys now good the bad guys 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.799
 are more badass the look more 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.709
 modern more shÃ´nen since you want 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:46.110
 so we have a small gallery the big box 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:47.160
 silvan google thanks so it's inevitably 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.099
 a bad guy because we want to 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.780
 bang you see you disgust ice 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:56.190
 interesting on the other hand when we 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:58.650
 think well the two friends max the 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:01.470
 same pokemon except two pokemon 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.540
 signature each finally a pokemon 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:06.090
 signature everyone who are sharp and of 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.440
 to the cameras if we consider that there is 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.180
 still have chances that they have 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:12.750
 right at the ball and game at missions for 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:15.090
 a little more weighted in the mega sharp game 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.010
 and omega maka mary especially when we 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.840
 know they have not necessarily it's not 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.579
 necessarily pokemon it is in term 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.799
 statistics is more than likely 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:26.940
 so we put our hand to cut my guys 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:28.560
 sharp and omega mary for rossa others 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.480
 characters featured in the scans of 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.150
 coro coro and in the stone trailer 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.130
 richard who comes back to a mega 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.380
 bracelet so we know he'll be able 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:39.750
 to make my guys evolve pokemon and 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.709
 when we look at his team may be 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:42.900
 megan is at the bone 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:44.340
 maybe but park wall or so 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.799
 bonuses to the resurgence of vassilis 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:49.230
 arnaldo or karine at or all 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:51.959
 simply mega legal and who's good this 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:54.030
 would not be super original this same pack 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:55.560
 or besides, well, we hope that this 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.670
 will not that be that will send us 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.250
 white with new mega 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:02.760
 evolution now that we look at you 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:05.190
 they showed us a map on 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:08.160
 see a lot a lot a lot new 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:10.040
 It so surely new places 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.420
 explored and there 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:14.010
 the halle battle boundaries which is hidden 

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:15.840
 by the clouds as well as other flights 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:17.340
 or maybe new areas to 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.289
 explore so we hope it's okay 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:21.000
 send heavy also a small crater 

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:23.639
 like that we had not seen and 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.759
 this sanctuary sambre here all entry 

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:28.590
 it's scary so probably a 

00:04:26.759 --> 00:04:31.560
 new place to explore in shape hope 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:33.509
 and these mysterious good news 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:36.150
 but there is still a bad 

00:04:33.509 --> 00:04:38.430
 but a little shameful besides 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:42.479
 Americans will be held on November 21 and 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:44.639
 we on the 28th seven days after that's going to be 

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:46.500
 endless horrible know paul 

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:48.630
 everywhere on the internet and gurus 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:51.030
 do not care why why 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:52.979
 frankly they must have well 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:56.190
 managed to change the xbox one so I 

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:58.199
 you say good it will not work but we 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:00.150
 gets fucked hard it must be 

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:01.620
 so also on November 21st like all the 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:03.180
 world there is no reason to europe 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:05.190
 serving a great continent 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:06.479
 we also have the right to see the game so I 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:08.789
 do not know what their strategy is 

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:12.750
 behind pearson marketing cap years he 

00:05:08.789 --> 00:05:15.150
