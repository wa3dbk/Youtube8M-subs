piece here with a groove cut in it and a

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.189 
piece here with a groove cut in it and a
routine<00:00:34.910> rivet<00:00:35.390> just<00:00:35.600> like<00:00:35.720> you<00:00:35.809> have<00:00:35.930> on<00:00:35.960> your

00:00:36.189 --> 00:00:36.199 
routine rivet just like you have on your

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:37.900 
routine rivet just like you have on your
ar-15<00:00:36.590> you<00:00:37.010> know<00:00:37.100> so<00:00:37.250> it<00:00:37.309> won't<00:00:37.489> fall<00:00:37.699> out<00:00:37.730> in

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:37.910 
ar-15 you know so it won't fall out in

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:38.950 
ar-15 you know so it won't fall out in
the<00:00:37.970> field<00:00:38.210> when<00:00:38.420> you<00:00:38.510> need<00:00:38.629> to<00:00:38.720> take<00:00:38.840> the

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:38.960 
the field when you need to take the

the field when you need to take the
handle<00:00:39.260> off<00:00:39.410> it's<00:00:39.980> been<00:00:40.220> pinned<00:00:40.610> over<00:00:41.030> on<00:00:41.180> the

handle off it's been pinned over on the

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.530 
handle off it's been pinned over on the
end<00:00:41.650> there<00:00:42.650> so<00:00:43.280> it<00:00:43.339> won't<00:00:43.519> come<00:00:43.610> out<00:00:43.850> this<00:00:44.269> hole

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:44.540 
end there so it won't come out this hole

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.450 
end there so it won't come out this hole
just<00:00:44.780> being<00:00:45.350> a<00:00:45.410> slightly<00:00:45.650> bigger<00:00:46.010> than<00:00:46.129> this

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:46.460 
just being a slightly bigger than this

just being a slightly bigger than this
one<00:00:46.670> here<00:00:46.970> so<00:00:47.150> just<00:00:47.629> a<00:00:47.720> simple<00:00:47.930> clever<00:00:48.530> way<00:00:48.890> to

00:00:48.939 --> 00:00:48.949 
one here so just a simple clever way to

when<00:00:56.300> I<00:00:56.329> restored<00:00:56.900> a<00:00:57.170> Wanda<00:00:57.710> and<00:00:57.920> I<00:00:58.339> put<00:00:58.610> her

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
when I restored a Wanda and I put her

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.820 
when I restored a Wanda and I put her
back<00:00:58.729> together<00:00:59.059> the<00:00:59.839> handguard<00:01:00.379> was<00:01:00.650> in<00:01:00.769> a

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:00.830 
back together the handguard was in a

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:03.310 
back together the handguard was in a
reverse<00:01:01.220> position<00:01:01.909> that<00:01:02.150> it<00:01:02.269> was<00:01:02.479> from<00:01:03.229> the

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320 
reverse position that it was from the

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.950 
reverse position that it was from the
time<00:01:03.500> that<00:01:03.710> I<00:01:03.769> started<00:01:04.280> and<00:01:04.850> that<00:01:05.119> song<00:01:05.390> saw

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 
time that I started and that song saw

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.960 
time that I started and that song saw
belonged<00:01:06.320> to<00:01:06.439> my<00:01:06.560> grandfather<00:01:06.979> and<00:01:07.430> when<00:01:07.820> he

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:07.970 
belonged to my grandfather and when he

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:09.219 
belonged to my grandfather and when he
had<00:01:08.090> put<00:01:08.270> it<00:01:08.360> back<00:01:08.479> together<00:01:08.659> he'd<00:01:09.080> actually

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:09.229 
had put it back together he'd actually

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:12.280 
had put it back together he'd actually
put<00:01:09.590> the<00:01:09.710> handle<00:01:10.159> back<00:01:10.310> or<00:01:11.060> the<00:01:11.180> handguard<00:01:12.020> on

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290 
put the handle back or the handguard on

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.679 
put the handle back or the handguard on
backwards<00:01:12.920> and<00:01:13.189> the<00:01:13.729> reason<00:01:14.000> why<00:01:14.090> I<00:01:14.119> know<00:01:14.270> that

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:14.689 
backwards and the reason why I know that

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:16.780 
backwards and the reason why I know that
is<00:01:14.960> if<00:01:15.290> you<00:01:15.409> look<00:01:15.590> and<00:01:15.770> see<00:01:15.979> there<00:01:16.250> there's<00:01:16.729> a

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:16.790 
is if you look and see there there's a

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:18.910 
is if you look and see there there's a
groove<00:01:17.150> cut<00:01:17.509> in<00:01:17.630> it<00:01:17.750> see<00:01:18.259> how<00:01:18.350> that<00:01:18.500> groove<00:01:18.770> is

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
groove cut in it see how that groove is

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.740 
groove cut in it see how that groove is
lined<00:01:19.130> up<00:01:19.250> there<00:01:19.490> there's<00:01:19.970> not<00:01:20.210> a<00:01:20.240> groove<00:01:20.570> on

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
lined up there there's not a groove on

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:21.580 
lined up there there's not a groove on
the<00:01:20.869> back<00:01:21.049> side

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
the back side

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.370 
the back side
well<00:01:22.369> that<00:01:22.549> groove<00:01:22.880> is<00:01:23.240> an<00:01:23.780> essential

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
well that groove is an essential

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.679 
well that groove is an essential
component<00:01:24.560> with<00:01:24.979> the<00:01:25.009> handle<00:01:25.490> because<00:01:26.090> as<00:01:26.479> you

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:26.689 
component with the handle because as you

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:31.300 
component with the handle because as you
install<00:01:27.140> it<00:01:27.350> here<00:01:27.650> on<00:01:27.850> the<00:01:28.850> saw<00:01:29.119> that<00:01:30.310> groove

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
install it here on the saw that groove

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.450 
install it here on the saw that groove
fits<00:01:32.179> into<00:01:32.810> the<00:01:33.020> back<00:01:33.259> the<00:01:33.859> back<00:01:34.009> of<00:01:34.159> the<00:01:34.219> blade

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:34.460 
fits into the back the back of the blade

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.039 
fits into the back the back of the blade
fits<00:01:34.789> in<00:01:34.939> there<00:01:35.119> and<00:01:35.299> that's<00:01:35.600> what<00:01:35.719> gives<00:01:35.929> it

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:36.049 
fits in there and that's what gives it

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:39.130 
fits in there and that's what gives it
its<00:01:36.200> stability<00:01:36.439> and<00:01:36.950> strength<00:01:37.939> so<00:01:38.719> right<00:01:38.960> here

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
its stability and strength so right here

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:40.929 
its stability and strength so right here
you<00:01:39.289> can<00:01:39.469> see<00:01:39.499> the<00:01:39.799> advantage<00:01:40.249> of<00:01:40.369> the<00:01:40.520> Pacific

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:40.939 
you can see the advantage of the Pacific

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:43.239 
you can see the advantage of the Pacific
Coast<00:01:40.969> handle<00:01:41.630> because<00:01:41.929> you<00:01:42.469> could<00:01:42.829> if<00:01:43.130> you

00:01:43.239 --> 00:01:43.249 
Coast handle because you could if you

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:44.950 
Coast handle because you could if you
needed<00:01:43.460> to<00:01:43.640> use<00:01:43.819> this<00:01:43.999> to<00:01:44.210> cut<00:01:44.420> down<00:01:44.600> or<00:01:44.840> to

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
needed to use this to cut down or to

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.130 
needed to use this to cut down or to
fell<00:01:45.229> a<00:01:45.259> tree<00:01:45.380> you<00:01:46.249> could<00:01:46.460> run<00:01:46.670> your<00:01:46.850> handle<00:01:47.359> in

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
fell a tree you could run your handle in

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.410 
fell a tree you could run your handle in
a<00:01:48.259> vertical<00:01:48.710> position<00:01:48.890> and<00:01:49.399> cut<00:01:49.999> back<00:01:50.210> and

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
a vertical position and cut back and

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.200 
a vertical position and cut back and
forth<00:01:50.600> this<00:01:50.780> way<00:01:51.049> or<00:01:51.259> if<00:01:51.979> you're<00:01:52.280> bucking<00:01:52.729> you

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
forth this way or if you're bucking you

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.899 
forth this way or if you're bucking you
can<00:01:53.359> simply<00:01:53.749> move<00:01:53.990> this<00:01:54.350> over<00:01:54.560> and<00:01:54.979> line<00:01:55.759> up

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:55.909 
can simply move this over and line up

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:59.169 
can simply move this over and line up
the<00:01:55.939> teeth<00:01:56.270> and<00:01:56.590> then<00:01:57.590> you<00:01:57.770> have<00:01:58.039> it's<00:01:58.789> its

00:01:59.169 --> 00:01:59.179 
the teeth and then you have it's its

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:00.669 
the teeth and then you have it's its
traditional<00:01:59.840> shape<00:02:00.049> right<00:02:00.259> there<00:02:00.439> so<00:02:00.560> it<00:02:00.649> just

00:02:00.669 --> 00:02:00.679 
traditional shape right there so it just

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:03.760 
traditional shape right there so it just
gives<00:02:01.039> you<00:02:01.130> every<00:02:01.939> option<00:02:02.450> and<00:02:02.659> you<00:02:03.439> can<00:02:03.469> have

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
gives you every option and you can have

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.529 
gives you every option and you can have
the<00:02:03.889> handle<00:02:04.219> up<00:02:04.429> you<00:02:04.729> can<00:02:04.880> have<00:02:05.030> the<00:02:05.179> handle

00:02:05.529 --> 00:02:05.539
