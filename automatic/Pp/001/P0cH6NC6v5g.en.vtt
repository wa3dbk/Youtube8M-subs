00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:11.309
 optional automated transmission to sg 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.530
 comfort of an automatic car and the 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.750
 sportsmanship 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.190
 with it you can choose the best 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.740
 between two worlds 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.630
 the gears automatically switched or 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.420
 manual that provides a 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.220
 driving even more sporty the match 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.099
 only occurs with the foot in the 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.830
 brake and shift lever in position n 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.020
 neutral when the starter motor is 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.180
 triggered this action is supported by a 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.010
 assisted start-up device which 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.860
 protects the engine of the vehicle by 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.170
 user safety in these operations. 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.579
 this system brings a novelty of 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.950
 user comfort 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.140
 the starter is started after the 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.690
 driver only turn the key until the 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.910
 starting position without the need to 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.340
 hold it there until the engine 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.800
 pick up so that the first gear is 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.140
 automatically engaged by placing the 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.640
 moving vehicle with a soft touch 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.510
 to the left on the selector lever 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.729
 to activate the position afterwards is only 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.610
 release the parking brake and step on the 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.200
 accelerator to gain speed for 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.369
 selection of program marches 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.170
 manual driving 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.619
 just give one more touch to 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.600
 to the left by activating the position 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.790
 exchange is very simple with touches to 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.460
 on the shift lever the gears 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.290
 they advance and touch backwards 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.600
 gears are reduced 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.130
 even when the car is moving it is 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.490
 possible to switch 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.470
 driving between automatic and manual is only 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:41.009
 move lever gently to the 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:43.229
 left where the positions of om 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.360
 in the case of the model equipped with lever 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:48.420
 optional butterfly type on the steering wheel 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:51.180
 direction of a soft key press plus the 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.740
 advances and by pressing the - 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.409
 they are reduced 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.930
 unlike traditional automatic to 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:00.509
 transmission to that g allows you to 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:03.180
 car engine with o &amp; m leverage 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:05.640
 releasing key withdrawal 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.829
 however, the exchange rate is still leveraged 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.170
 you are in one of these positions 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:12.300
 the car does not release again and a 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.990
 message on the panel will inform you that 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.540
 need

 curling and starting to stop 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.420
 or park 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.820
 it is important to always keep your foot on the brake 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:24.810
 or engage the parking brake 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:27.060
 whether on flat or inclined sites 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.850
 sports function in automatic mode 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.920
 to improve car performance 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:34.950
 to activate it just press the key 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:37.470
 s with this sports mode 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.510
 themselves are carried out in a 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:42.120
 higher power output 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.250
 engine to preserve durability 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.950
 system prevents the 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.050
 speed is exceeded if you try to 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.210
 reduce abruptly or 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:53.550
 speed at a speed not 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:54.380
 compatible with the system shall not
