like under the apps if you don't have

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.700 
like under the apps if you don't have
absolutely<00:01:39.600> would<00:01:39.750> create<00:01:40.049> one<00:01:40.200> for<00:01:40.409> you<00:01:40.530> and

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
absolutely would create one for you and

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.200 
absolutely would create one for you and
this<00:01:41.070> is<00:01:41.130> where<00:01:41.369> you<00:01:41.460> put<00:01:41.579> all<00:01:41.700> your<00:01:41.729> apps<00:01:42.000> in

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
loader for the first time and next what

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:02.030 
loader for the first time and next what
you<00:01:57.570> want<00:01:57.750> to<00:01:57.840> do<00:01:57.930> now<00:01:58.110> is<00:01:58.790> go<00:01:59.790> and<00:02:00.030> get<00:02:00.299> the<00:02:01.040> WB

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
you want to do now is go and get the WB

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.209 
you want to do now is go and get the WB
EFS<00:02:02.549> manager<00:02:03.149> and<00:02:03.960> that's<00:02:04.799> going<00:02:05.040> to<00:02:05.130> be

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
EFS manager and that's going to be

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.779 
EFS manager and that's going to be
basically<00:02:05.700> a<00:02:06.740> program<00:02:07.740> that<00:02:08.039> you<00:02:08.160> can<00:02:08.220> use<00:02:08.550> to

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
basically a program that you can use to

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.089 
basically a program that you can use to
install<00:02:09.000> your<00:02:09.720> games<00:02:10.319> onto<00:02:10.560> the<00:02:10.800> hard<00:02:11.009> drive

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
install your games onto the hard drive

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.440 
install your games onto the hard drive
and<00:02:11.489> it's<00:02:11.640> going<00:02:11.730> to<00:02:11.819> be<00:02:11.879> the<00:02:11.970> format<00:02:12.270> your

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
and it's going to be the format your

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.340 
and it's going to be the format your
hard<00:02:12.480> drive<00:02:12.870> so<00:02:13.050> the

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
hard drive so the

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.560 
hard drive so the
-<00:02:13.440> USB<00:02:13.710> loader<00:02:13.950> can<00:02:14.220> read<00:02:14.460> it<00:02:14.670> that's<00:02:15.360> mainly

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570 
- USB loader can read it that's mainly

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:16.730 
- USB loader can read it that's mainly
what<00:02:15.690> that's<00:02:15.840> when<00:02:16.050> you<00:02:16.110> go<00:02:16.260> to<00:02:16.320> this<00:02:16.500> link

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
what that's when you go to this link

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.100 
what that's when you go to this link
that<00:02:16.890> opinion<00:02:17.130> description<00:02:17.700> and<00:02:17.930> the<00:02:18.930> one

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
that opinion description and the one

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.230 
that opinion description and the one
that<00:02:19.200> I'm<00:02:19.320> using<00:02:19.350> right<00:02:19.620> here<00:02:19.890> is<00:02:20.040> the<00:02:20.400> WPS

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
that I'm using right here is the WPS

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.280 
that I'm using right here is the WPS
manager<00:02:21.660> 2.5<00:02:22.380> x<00:02:23.220> 64<00:02:23.760> the<00:02:24.060> 64-bit<00:02:24.750> I'm<00:02:25.020> pretty

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
manager 2.5 x 64 the 64-bit I'm pretty

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.100 
manager 2.5 x 64 the 64-bit I'm pretty
sure<00:02:25.470> 64<00:02:26.460> or<00:02:26.640> 34<00:02:27.120> bit<00:02:27.300> computer<00:02:27.540> can<00:02:27.780> run<00:02:27.960> down

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
sure 64 or 34 bit computer can run down

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.170 
sure 64 or 34 bit computer can run down
so<00:02:28.260> I<00:02:28.290> haven't<00:02:28.530> really<00:02:28.710> tried<00:02:28.950> the<00:02:29.190> 86<00:02:29.730> bit<00:02:29.940> one

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
so I haven't really tried the 86 bit one

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.590 
so I haven't really tried the 86 bit one
just<00:02:31.110> click<00:02:31.350> that<00:02:31.530> one<00:02:31.680> agree<00:02:32.160> and<00:02:32.580> again<00:02:33.390> I'm

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
just click that one agree and again I'm

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.060 
just click that one agree and again I'm
going<00:02:33.750> to<00:02:33.840> save<00:02:34.050> this<00:02:34.230> into<00:02:34.410> my<00:02:34.590> desktop<00:02:34.920> for

into that sentence right there or you

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:09.200 
into that sentence right there or you
close<00:04:08.250> that<00:04:08.430> down<00:04:08.520> and<00:04:08.760> then<00:04:08.880> you<00:04:09.000> will<00:04:09.120> need

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:09.210 
close that down and then you will need

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:15.890 
close that down and then you will need
to<00:04:09.330> open<00:04:09.540> up<00:04:09.630> your<00:04:09.690> WBS<00:04:10.760> WB<00:04:11.760> FS<00:04:12.180> manager<00:04:14.900> and

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
then minus the H Drive so I'm going to

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:20.390 
then minus the H Drive so I'm going to
format<00:04:19.350> that<00:04:19.530> and<00:04:19.710> you<00:04:19.799> have<00:04:19.920> to<00:04:20.040> format<00:04:20.370> it

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
format that and you have to format it

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.070 
format that and you have to format it
inside<00:04:20.820> of<00:04:20.850> this<00:04:21.030> program<00:04:21.540> right<00:04:21.750> here<00:04:21.930> you

inside of this program right here you
have<00:04:22.200> to<00:04:22.350> also<00:04:22.530> have<00:04:22.770> to<00:04:22.860> format<00:04:23.130> it<00:04:23.190> again<00:04:23.460> and

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
have to also have to format it again and

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.480 
have to also have to format it again and
it<00:04:23.700> was<00:04:23.790> formatted<00:04:24.150> successfully<00:04:24.810> now

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:25.490 
it was formatted successfully now

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:30.110 
it was formatted successfully now
they<00:04:26.490> just<00:04:26.730> load<00:04:27.180> that<00:04:27.210> up<00:04:28.730> then<00:04:29.730> you<00:04:29.820> just<00:04:30.000> go
