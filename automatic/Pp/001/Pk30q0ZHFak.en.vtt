00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.600

 in this afternoon because they are already prepared mercedes and nuria costs 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.430
 Moreno Mercedes that is a painting laboratory we could say would be the 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.700
 last step but let's start at the beginning so that at home they take 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.880
 ballpoint pen and paper to make these cookies we have the following 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.570
 Butter 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.000
 and nuria that is the expert in this case that will start to show that mass bride if 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.790
 you think very well we just have to take all these ingredients and 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.620
 mixed about 250 grams of butter 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:20.110
 250 bouquets of butter that we put in 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.930
 per cent good this professional game that at home we could do it in a 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.590
 archenet we love by hand 1 we tell it all the program we are kneading 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:28.500
 it's the same thing that 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.880
 we welcome now the sugar 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.320
 we incorporate it 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.030
 going through here 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.570
 we get together so that it mixes 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.070
 Spain and our people 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.140
 sugar butter and egg is added 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.149
 we add 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:49.350
 vanilla powder 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.690
 vanilla powder marta I already knew that something was viral to me as an expert I'm not 

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:55.820
 stupid infor not to expose him in her life 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.710
 everything is for that frame we are seeing nothing more 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:05.030
 how will it be good then throwing darín until the mass is made 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:06.880
 I wanted to stay 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.299
 that mixture 

00:02:08.299 --> 00:02:12.239
 that you are seeing how it mixes and it would be marten as we are seeing it 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:12.889
 here 

00:02:12.889 --> 00:02:18.179
 and now the ferris wheel comes at the most difficult time the artisan passed the mass 

00:02:18.179 --> 00:02:22.229
 and with the roller we stretch artisan says marta like all the life a roller 

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:23.799
 there, suárez 

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:28.129
 entities we go to massa the we are going kneading we go towards the highest until 

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:31.479
 we get here I am in theory should the one who has to learn that is not 

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:34.980
 professional and yamin this costs me counting so we do not talk much 

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:39.069
 and then be able to cut with exporters easier 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:43.430
 knee in hand marta we have to do a good job well 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.559
 you have to concentrate 

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:49.949
 would be one more even the filmmaker is the trick is in vallecas and holidays 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:54.959
 to be able to work like one hour an hour the refrigerator before consistent and 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:55.640
 more cold 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.139
 and shorten the cookies I do not know 

00:02:58.139 --> 00:03:01.340
 shorten the difference ferris wheel with these molds 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.700
 what we are going to do was very much the domain truth we cut 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:08.429
 the boy 

00:03:08.429 --> 00:03:11.429

00:03:12.719 --> 00:03:14.100

 in this business to make these works of art we already had these four 

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:40.110
 cookies that you see them as good as normal, you have to take them I took 

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:43.690
 with me waking them up today I repeat that they accompany me better and the ones we had 

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:46.940
 but not how long a 12 to 15 minutes as we see it well 

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:51.479
 efe to 15 minutes took most of lightness of the truth 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:55.119
 that's shy throws watchmen 

00:03:55.119 --> 00:03:57.029
