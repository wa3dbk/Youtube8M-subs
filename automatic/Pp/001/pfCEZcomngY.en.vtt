what it's used for and what its main
purpose<00:00:40.440> is<00:00:41.190> so<00:00:41.430> this<00:00:41.610> sword<00:00:41.880> is<00:00:42.000> called<00:00:42.810> the

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
so this is very key because I'm thinking

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.080 
so this is very key because I'm thinking
this<00:00:51.900> might<00:00:52.260> be<00:00:52.680> you<00:00:53.370> know<00:00:53.490> don't<00:00:53.700> quote<00:00:53.880> me<00:00:54.060> on

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
this might be you know don't quote me on

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.270 
this might be you know don't quote me on
this<00:00:54.210> but<00:00:54.390> this<00:00:55.140> might<00:00:55.410> be<00:00:55.560> a<00:00:55.590> weapon<00:00:56.010> you<00:00:56.100> get

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
this but this might be a weapon you get

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.940 
this but this might be a weapon you get
from<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.610> raid<00:00:56.820> it's<00:00:57.150> kind<00:00:57.390> of<00:00:57.510> interesting

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:57.950 
from the raid it's kind of interesting

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:00.820 
from the raid it's kind of interesting
to<00:00:58.950> see<00:00:59.190> maybe<00:00:59.460> you<00:00:59.700> get<00:00:59.850> a<00:00:59.910> different<00:01:00.450> type<00:01:00.630> of

to see maybe you get a different type of

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:04.280 
to see maybe you get a different type of
element<00:01:01.830> different<00:01:02.760> type<00:01:02.940> of<00:01:02.970> weapon<00:01:03.510> for

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
element different type of weapon for

element different type of weapon for
your<00:01:04.530> each<00:01:04.830> character<00:01:05.309> so<00:01:05.550> this<00:01:05.970> is<00:01:06.120> just<00:01:06.300> pure

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
your each character so this is just pure

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.150 
your each character so this is just pure
speculation<00:01:06.840> right<00:01:07.350> now<00:01:07.380> so<00:01:07.680> please<00:01:07.860> don't

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:08.160 
speculation right now so please don't

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:09.560 
speculation right now so please don't
take<00:01:08.280> this<00:01:08.430> to<00:01:08.550> heart<00:01:08.670> it<00:01:08.940> could<00:01:09.360> just<00:01:09.450> be

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
take this to heart it could just be

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:10.880 
take this to heart it could just be
swords<00:01:10.110> or<00:01:10.230> it<00:01:10.320> could<00:01:10.410> just<00:01:10.440> be<00:01:10.590> something

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
swords or it could just be something

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.160 
swords or it could just be something
random<00:01:11.340> but<00:01:11.520> what<00:01:12.060> I'm<00:01:12.240> thinking<00:01:12.690> it<00:01:12.870> could<00:01:13.050> be

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
random but what I'm thinking it could be

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.990 
random but what I'm thinking it could be
something<00:01:13.530> like<00:01:13.890> this<00:01:14.100> so<00:01:14.340> let's<00:01:14.550> say<00:01:14.730> as<00:01:14.940> a

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
something like this so let's say as a

hunter you get a sword as a warlike you

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
actually swing the sword I'm assuming

actually swing the sword I'm assuming
there's<00:02:02.520> going<00:02:02.580> to<00:02:02.729> be<00:02:02.760> multiple<00:02:03.330> sorts

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
there's going to be multiple sorts

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.060 
there's going to be multiple sorts
because<00:02:03.690> we<00:02:04.049> have<00:02:04.200> a<00:02:04.229> speed<00:02:04.500> impact<00:02:04.890> range

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
because we have a speed impact range

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.430 
because we have a speed impact range
efficiency<00:02:05.640> deficit<00:02:06.180> and<00:02:06.270> energy<00:02:06.570> that<00:02:07.170> means

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 
efficiency deficit and energy that means

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:08.779 
efficiency deficit and energy that means
there's<00:02:07.680> different<00:02:08.039> types<00:02:08.069> of<00:02:08.369> sorts<00:02:08.670> for

there's<00:02:17.520> a<00:02:17.580> solar<00:02:17.940> damage<00:02:18.390> a<00:02:18.600> sword<00:02:19.230> or<00:02:19.440> you

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
there's a solar damage a sword or you

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.500 
there's a solar damage a sword or you

know if there's different types of

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:22.760 
know if there's different types of
artifact<00:02:21.959> it<00:02:22.080> would<00:02:22.200> be<00:02:22.350> cool<00:02:22.530> there<00:02:22.709> were

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
artifact it would be cool there were

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:23.930 
artifact it would be cool there were
different<00:02:23.069> types<00:02:23.190> of<00:02:23.250> artifacts<00:02:23.640> but<00:02:23.760> it<00:02:23.880> is

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
different types of artifacts but it is

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.790 
different types of artifacts but it is
just<00:02:24.030> a<00:02:24.180> sword<00:02:24.420> you<00:02:25.319> know<00:02:25.440> there<00:02:25.770> are

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
just a sword you know there are

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.530 
just a sword you know there are
different<00:02:26.370> types<00:02:26.400> of<00:02:26.819> elements<00:02:26.970> so<00:02:27.420> they

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
different types of elements so they

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.440 
different types of elements so they
would<00:02:27.660> beat<00:02:27.810> solar<00:02:28.110> void<00:02:28.770> in<00:02:29.010> arc<00:02:29.390> now<00:02:30.390> the

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
would beat solar void in arc now the

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:31.970 
would beat solar void in arc now the
energy<00:02:30.720> is<00:02:30.959> one<00:02:31.140> that<00:02:31.410> I<00:02:31.440> want<00:02:31.680> a<00:02:31.740> point

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
energy is one that I want a point

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.130 
energy is one that I want a point
because<00:02:32.280> that<00:02:32.790> is<00:02:32.910> going<00:02:33.060> to<00:02:33.120> be<00:02:33.240> based<00:02:33.450> on<00:02:33.720> the

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
because that is going to be based on the

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.080 
because that is going to be based on the
amount<00:02:34.620> of<00:02:34.770> energy<00:02:34.920> the<00:02:35.340> sword<00:02:35.610> has<00:02:35.670> that

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
amount of energy the sword has that

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.280 
amount of energy the sword has that
you're<00:02:36.209> able<00:02:36.360> to<00:02:36.540> use<00:02:36.660> it<00:02:36.690> because<00:02:36.959> you're<00:02:37.170> not

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
you're able to use it because you're not

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:38.660 
you're able to use it because you're not
going<00:02:37.410> to<00:02:37.470> be<00:02:37.560> running<00:02:37.740> around<00:02:37.920> crucible<00:02:38.640> or

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
going to be running around crucible or

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.850 
going to be running around crucible or
running<00:02:39.000> around<00:02:39.720> raids<00:02:40.200> or<00:02:40.320> running<00:02:40.560> around

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
running around raids or running around

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.270 
running around raids or running around
you<00:02:41.550> know<00:02:41.580> different<00:02:41.850> PvP<00:02:42.620> aspects<00:02:43.620> or<00:02:43.739> pvv

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
you know different PvP aspects or pvv

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.640 
you know different PvP aspects or pvv
aspects<00:02:44.880> just<00:02:45.360> using<00:02:45.630> the<00:02:45.720> sword<00:02:45.930> so<00:02:46.140> there's

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
aspects just using the sword so there's

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.710 
aspects just using the sword so there's
an<00:02:46.830> amount<00:02:47.070> of<00:02:47.370> time<00:02:47.610> the<00:02:47.820> sword<00:02:48.060> last<00:02:48.360> so<00:02:48.600> you

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
an amount of time the sword last so you

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.350 
an amount of time the sword last so you
have<00:02:48.870> energy<00:02:49.350> slot<00:02:49.860> or<00:02:50.010> an<00:02:50.220> energy<00:02:50.610> bar<00:02:50.820> what

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
have energy slot or an energy bar what

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.000 
have energy slot or an energy bar what
tells<00:02:51.600> you<00:02:51.720> how<00:02:51.900> much<00:02:52.019> energy<00:02:52.290> this<00:02:52.650> sword<00:02:52.950> has

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
tells you how much energy this sword has

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.699 
tells you how much energy this sword has
for<00:02:53.820> the<00:02:54.120> time<00:02:54.360> period<00:02:54.390> it<00:02:54.840> takes<00:02:55.350> for<00:02:55.560> it<00:02:55.680> to

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
for the time period it takes for it to

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:57.920 
for the time period it takes for it to
be<00:02:55.950> dismantled<00:02:56.340> or<00:02:56.730> for<00:02:57.150> you<00:02:57.239> not<00:02:57.420> be<00:02:57.570> able<00:02:57.780> to

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
be dismantled or for you not be able to

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.240 
be dismantled or for you not be able to
use<00:02:58.170> it<00:02:58.350> so<00:02:58.530> it's<00:02:58.920> going<00:02:59.010> to<00:02:59.070> be<00:02:59.220> very

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
use it so it's going to be very

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.220 
use it so it's going to be very
interesting<00:02:59.940> to<00:02:59.970> see<00:03:00.150> how<00:03:00.300> high<00:03:00.660> the<00:03:00.690> energy

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
interesting to see how high the energy

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:04.070 
interesting to see how high the energy
cap<00:03:01.470> goes<00:03:01.709> and<00:03:01.950> how<00:03:02.610> low<00:03:02.850> the<00:03:03.030> energy<00:03:03.420> cap<00:03:03.630> goes

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
cap goes and how low the energy cap goes

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.710 
cap goes and how low the energy cap goes
depending<00:03:04.320> on<00:03:04.709> the<00:03:04.830> impact<00:03:05.160> and<00:03:05.370> deranged<00:03:06.180> so

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
depending on the impact and deranged so

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.210 
depending on the impact and deranged so
the<00:03:06.840> energy<00:03:06.989> is<00:03:07.230> going<00:03:07.350> to<00:03:07.410> be<00:03:07.500> very<00:03:07.530> important

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
the energy is going to be very important

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.130 
the energy is going to be very important
when<00:03:08.430> we<00:03:08.610> pick<00:03:08.820> up<00:03:09.000> one<00:03:09.150> of<00:03:09.180> these<00:03:09.330> sorts<00:03:09.660> so

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
when we pick up one of these sorts so

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:11.900 
when we pick up one of these sorts so
the<00:03:10.350> thing<00:03:10.530> is<00:03:10.680> what<00:03:10.950> is<00:03:11.070> this<00:03:11.250> sword<00:03:11.519> do<00:03:11.670> like

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
the thing is what is this sword do like

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.759 
the thing is what is this sword do like
what<00:03:12.330> is<00:03:12.510> the<00:03:12.660> purpose<00:03:12.959> of<00:03:13.230> the<00:03:13.380> sword<00:03:13.620> right

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:13.769 
what is the purpose of the sword right

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:16.330 
what is the purpose of the sword right
so<00:03:13.980> it<00:03:14.400> says<00:03:14.459> you<00:03:14.940> sell<00:03:15.180> to<00:03:15.450> to<00:03:15.660> guard

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
so it says you sell to to guard

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.130 
so it says you sell to to guard
effectively<00:03:17.340> against<00:03:18.150> solar<00:03:18.510> and<00:03:18.840> void

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
effectively against solar and void

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.500 
effectively against solar and void
attacks<00:03:19.560> less<00:03:20.340> effective<00:03:20.910> against

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
attacks less effective against

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.210 
attacks less effective against
architects<00:03:22.170> I'm<00:03:22.380> believing<00:03:22.799> it's<00:03:22.950> going<00:03:23.160> to

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
architects I'm believing it's going to

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:24.890 
architects I'm believing it's going to
be<00:03:23.280> some<00:03:23.489> type<00:03:23.519> of<00:03:23.730> shield<00:03:24.150> that<00:03:24.630> you're<00:03:24.780> able

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
be some type of shield that you're able

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.190 
be some type of shield that you're able
to<00:03:25.079> guard<00:03:25.380> or<00:03:25.620> defend<00:03:26.070> yourself<00:03:26.459> from

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 
to guard or defend yourself from

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.110 
to guard or defend yourself from
anything<00:03:28.200> that<00:03:28.350> has<00:03:28.560> solar<00:03:28.980> or<00:03:29.250> void<00:03:29.760> attack

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
anything that has solar or void attack

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.800 
anything that has solar or void attack
so<00:03:30.329> let's<00:03:30.510> say<00:03:31.640> when<00:03:32.640> we<00:03:32.760> fight<00:03:32.940> Oryx<00:03:33.299> he

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
so let's say when we fight Oryx he

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.720 
so let's say when we fight Oryx he
shoots<00:03:34.049> out<00:03:34.230> like<00:03:34.470> a<00:03:34.500> solar<00:03:34.860> Grenadier<00:03:35.340> or

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
shoots out like a solar Grenadier or

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.030 
shoots out like a solar Grenadier or
some<00:03:36.450> void<00:03:36.720> thing<00:03:37.140> you<00:03:37.320> know<00:03:37.410> weird<00:03:37.709> looking

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
some void thing you know weird looking

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.620 
some void thing you know weird looking
thing<00:03:38.070> then<00:03:38.730> you're<00:03:38.880> able<00:03:39.030> to<00:03:39.239> pull<00:03:39.420> up<00:03:39.510> your

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
thing then you're able to pull up your

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.120 
thing then you're able to pull up your
soul<00:03:39.810> and<00:03:39.930> kind<00:03:40.140> of<00:03:40.230> defend<00:03:40.590> yourself<00:03:40.950> and

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
soul and kind of defend yourself and

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:43.550 
soul and kind of defend yourself and
guard<00:03:41.430> yourself<00:03:41.850> against<00:03:42.840> that<00:03:43.079> different

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
guard yourself against that different

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.979 
guard yourself against that different
type<00:03:43.739> of<00:03:43.769> element<00:03:44.100> effect<00:03:44.730> making<00:03:45.540> it<00:03:45.780> very

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
type of element effect making it very

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:47.569 
type of element effect making it very
very<00:03:46.350> interesting<00:03:46.829> because<00:03:46.980> this<00:03:47.310> kind<00:03:47.459> of

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:47.579 
very interesting because this kind of

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:50.180 
very interesting because this kind of
gives<00:03:47.730> us<00:03:47.910> a<00:03:48.030> sense<00:03:48.360> of<00:03:48.510> what<00:03:48.660> the<00:03:49.650> rave<00:03:49.920> might

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
gives us a sense of what the rave might

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:51.770 
gives us a sense of what the rave might
be<00:03:50.340> like<00:03:50.549> or<00:03:50.760> what<00:03:50.940> we<00:03:51.090> could<00:03:51.269> expect<00:03:51.420> out<00:03:51.750> of

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
be like or what we could expect out of

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.030 
be like or what we could expect out of
different<00:03:52.170> enemies<00:03:52.470> maybe<00:03:52.680> usually

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
different enemies maybe usually

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.740 
different enemies maybe usually
different<00:03:53.220> types<00:03:53.549> of<00:03:53.670> elements<00:03:53.820> against<00:03:54.630> us

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
different types of elements against us

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.110 
different types of elements against us
and<00:03:54.900> we're<00:03:55.500> us<00:03:55.680> needing<00:03:56.100> the<00:03:56.250> sword<00:03:56.549> to

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
and we're us needing the sword to

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.370 
and we're us needing the sword to
protect<00:03:57.150> ourselves<00:03:57.630> or<00:03:57.989> shield<00:03:58.260> ourselves

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
protect ourselves or shield ourselves

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.130 
protect ourselves or shield ourselves
from<00:03:58.769> this<00:03:59.220> type<00:03:59.579> of<00:03:59.610> elemental<00:04:00.299> damage<00:04:00.450> so

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
from this type of elemental damage so

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.289 
from this type of elemental damage so
very<00:04:01.380> very<00:04:01.440> interesting<00:04:02.100> but<00:04:02.370> another<00:04:03.090> thing

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:03.299 
very very interesting but another thing

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:05.000 
very very interesting but another thing
we<00:04:03.420> get<00:04:03.570> is<00:04:03.630> it's<00:04:03.959> less<00:04:04.230> effective<00:04:04.739> when

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
we get is it's less effective when

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.400 
we get is it's less effective when
you're<00:04:05.190> being<00:04:05.400> shot<00:04:05.700> or<00:04:05.880> attacked<00:04:06.780> with<00:04:07.079> arc

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
you're being shot or attacked with arc

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:10.160 
you're being shot or attacked with arc
so<00:04:08.130> this<00:04:08.489> is<00:04:08.519> where<00:04:08.880> I'm<00:04:09.120> referencing<00:04:09.390> to<00:04:09.810> that

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
so this is where I'm referencing to that

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:11.930 
so this is where I'm referencing to that
there<00:04:10.350> might<00:04:10.560> be<00:04:10.620> swords<00:04:11.280> with<00:04:11.459> void<00:04:11.700> and

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
there might be swords with void and

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.240 
there might be swords with void and
solar<00:04:12.510> so<00:04:13.019> very<00:04:13.230> interesting<00:04:13.709> stat<00:04:13.950> we<00:04:13.980> were

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
solar so very interesting stat we were

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:16.430 
solar so very interesting stat we were
able<00:04:14.340> to<00:04:14.519> get<00:04:14.700> from<00:04:15.150> this<00:04:15.299> specific<00:04:15.900> you<00:04:16.320> know

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
able to get from this specific you know

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.949 
able to get from this specific you know
item<00:04:16.859> it's<00:04:17.280> called<00:04:17.579> the<00:04:17.789> arcades<00:04:18.359> again<00:04:18.780> I

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
item it's called the arcades again I

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:20.360 
item it's called the arcades again I
kind<00:04:19.200> of<00:04:19.289> like<00:04:19.350> the<00:04:19.530> name<00:04:19.680> I<00:04:19.799> guess<00:04:19.950> our<00:04:20.160> cage

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
kind of like the name I guess our cage

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.279 
kind of like the name I guess our cage
means<00:04:20.609> it's<00:04:20.820> a<00:04:20.970> edge<00:04:21.150> you<00:04:21.479> know<00:04:21.600> since<00:04:21.930> it's<00:04:22.049> an

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:22.289 
means it's a edge you know since it's an

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:24.290 
means it's a edge you know since it's an
arc<00:04:22.590> damage<00:04:22.919> so<00:04:23.460> I'm<00:04:23.550> assuming<00:04:23.669> there<00:04:24.090> could

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
arc damage so I'm assuming there could

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.120 
arc damage so I'm assuming there could
be<00:04:24.330> void<00:04:24.720> edge<00:04:25.169> and<00:04:25.680> there<00:04:25.890> could<00:04:26.099> be

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
be void edge and there could be

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:27.470 
be void edge and there could be
SolarEdge<00:04:26.669> I'm

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:27.480 
SolarEdge I'm

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.330 
SolarEdge I'm
pretty<00:04:27.690> guessing<00:04:28.140> those<00:04:28.260> are<00:04:28.290> the<00:04:28.500> names<00:04:28.650> just

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
pretty guessing those are the names just

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:30.710 
pretty guessing those are the names just
because<00:04:29.580> it's<00:04:29.760> called<00:04:29.970> arcades<00:04:30.330> but<00:04:30.540> I<00:04:30.570> could

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
because it's called arcades but I could

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.450 
because it's called arcades but I could
be<00:04:30.810> completely<00:04:30.990> off<00:04:31.350> base<00:04:31.530> on<00:04:31.680> that<00:04:31.800> but<00:04:32.280> let

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
be completely off base on that but let

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:33.800 
be completely off base on that but let
me<00:04:32.490> know<00:04:32.580> what<00:04:32.850> you<00:04:32.910> guys<00:04:33.030> think<00:04:33.240> of<00:04:33.420> this<00:04:33.570> sort

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 
me know what you guys think of this sort

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:35.450 
me know what you guys think of this sort
then<00:04:34.020> later<00:04:34.290> on<00:04:34.380> the<00:04:34.620> clip<00:04:34.800> you<00:04:34.890> guys<00:04:35.010> are<00:04:35.220> able
