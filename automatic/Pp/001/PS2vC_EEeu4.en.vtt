introduced into the mix instead of

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:19.490 
introduced into the mix instead of
seeing<00:05:18.360> them<00:05:18.509> two<00:05:18.750> bullet<00:05:19.050> kills<00:05:19.259> we're

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:19.500 
seeing them two bullet kills we're

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:20.990 
seeing them two bullet kills we're
seeing<00:05:19.710> right<00:05:19.830> now<00:05:19.889> you're<00:05:20.580> gonna<00:05:20.729> be<00:05:20.789> putting

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:21.000 
seeing right now you're gonna be putting

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.279 
seeing right now you're gonna be putting
half<00:05:21.180> a<00:05:21.300> clip<00:05:21.509> in<00:05:21.659> somebody<00:05:21.930> and<00:05:22.020> they<00:05:22.080> still

00:05:22.279 --> 00:05:22.289 
half a clip in somebody and they still

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:24.679 
half a clip in somebody and they still
won't<00:05:22.379> die<00:05:22.589> you<00:05:22.830> guys<00:05:23.669> all<00:05:23.879> know<00:05:24.029> how<00:05:24.210> Treyarch

00:05:24.679 --> 00:05:24.689 
won't die you guys all know how Treyarch

00:05:24.689 --> 00:05:26.709

hit<00:05:25.169> detection<00:05:25.439> and<00:05:25.740> netcode<00:05:26.009> already<00:05:26.370> rolls

00:05:26.709 --> 00:05:26.719 
hit detection and netcode already rolls

00:05:26.719 --> 00:05:29.029 
hit detection and netcode already rolls
so<00:05:27.719> the<00:05:27.930> time<00:05:28.110> to<00:05:28.259> kill<00:05:28.409> looks<00:05:28.620> a<00:05:28.710> little<00:05:28.830> high

00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:29.039 
so the time to kill looks a little high

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:31.249 
so the time to kill looks a little high
which<00:05:29.219> I<00:05:29.370> did<00:05:29.969> not<00:05:30.180> like<00:05:30.419> but<00:05:30.659> again<00:05:30.749> man<00:05:31.110> it's
