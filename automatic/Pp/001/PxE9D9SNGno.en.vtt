00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:58.550 
i'll be back when I've found a cave and

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:01.390 
i'll be back when I've found a cave and
stuff<00:02:58.970> and

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.100

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
a cave afterlight digging right now to

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.340 
a cave afterlight digging right now to
bedrock<00:03:14.340> about<00:03:14.580> five<00:03:14.790> times<00:03:15.150> oh<00:03:15.570> yeah<00:03:16.140> let's

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
bedrock about five times oh yeah let's

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:20.120 
bedrock about five times oh yeah let's
see<00:03:16.440> what<00:03:16.560> I<00:03:16.590> can<00:03:16.770> do<00:03:17.900> yeah<00:03:18.900> you<00:03:19.290> can<00:03:19.470> you<00:03:19.890> can

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
see what I can do yeah you can you can

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:23.210 
see what I can do yeah you can you can
see<00:03:20.430> how<00:03:20.520> this<00:03:20.790> can<00:03:20.970> be<00:03:21.030> very<00:03:21.330> useful<00:03:22.040> yeah<00:03:23.040> it

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
see how this can be very useful yeah it

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.300 
see how this can be very useful yeah it
is<00:03:23.370> fired<00:03:23.640> and<00:03:24.000> then<00:03:24.090> it<00:03:24.270> just<00:03:24.380> I<00:03:25.380> think<00:03:26.100> it<00:03:26.190> is

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
is fired and then it just I think it is

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:28.660 
is fired and then it just I think it is
we're<00:03:26.730> just<00:03:27.030> so<00:03:27.240> tan<00:03:27.420> Endermen<00:03:27.780> for<00:03:27.990> the<00:03:28.320> war

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
we're just so tan Endermen for the war

we're just so tan Endermen for the war
is<00:03:29.670> awesome<00:03:30.210> it<00:03:31.170> seems<00:03:31.560> to<00:03:31.680> fly<00:03:31.890> around

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
is awesome it seems to fly around

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.940 
is awesome it seems to fly around
bouncing<00:03:32.730> off<00:03:32.910> things

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
bouncing off things

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:40.330 
bouncing off things
well<00:03:35.580> this<00:03:36.239> is<00:03:36.270> cool

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.410 

this<00:03:41.120> is<00:03:41.269> he<00:03:41.420> a<00:03:41.480> faster<00:03:41.810> faster<00:03:42.200> faster<00:03:43.420> this

go<00:04:09.099> get<00:04:09.310> out<00:04:09.489> there<00:04:09.879> we<00:04:10.000> go<00:04:11.370> and<00:04:12.370> I<00:04:13.230> imagine<00:04:14.230> if

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:14.709 
go get out there we go and I imagine if

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:18.629 
go get out there we go and I imagine if
with<00:04:15.040> some<00:04:15.250> skill<00:04:15.670> maybe<00:04:15.939> with<00:04:16.269> their<00:04:17.639> gravity

00:04:18.629 --> 00:04:18.639 
with some skill maybe with their gravity

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:20.159 
with some skill maybe with their gravity
mods<00:04:18.880> you<00:04:19.060> could<00:04:19.239> probably<00:04:19.449> even<00:04:19.750> just

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:20.169 
mods you could probably even just

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:23.400 
mods you could probably even just
shooter<00:04:21.030> you<00:04:22.030> could<00:04:22.210> black<00:04:22.540> grab<00:04:22.810> a<00:04:22.840> creep<00:04:23.169> and

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:23.410 
shooter you could black grab a creep and

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:25.860 
shooter you could black grab a creep and
then<00:04:23.710> just<00:04:24.130> as<00:04:24.280> a<00:04:24.430> butter<00:04:24.760> explode<00:04:25.210> like<00:04:25.479> fairy

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 
then just as a butter explode like fairy

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:29.670 
then just as a butter explode like fairy
teton<00:04:26.260> enemy<00:04:27.150> what<00:04:28.150> I<00:04:28.539> don't<00:04:29.110> forgot<00:04:29.350> be<00:04:29.530> able

teton enemy what I don't forgot be able

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.700 
teton enemy what I don't forgot be able
to<00:04:29.740> pull<00:04:29.919> that<00:04:30.039> off<00:04:30.389> but<00:04:31.389> you<00:04:32.320> might<00:04:32.530> be<00:04:32.560> able

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
to pull that off but you might be able

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.850 
to pull that off but you might be able

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:35.860 
to fear thank you if you think you got a

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.469 
to fear thank you if you think you got a
half<00:04:36.100> life<00:04:36.430> and<00:04:37.590> you<00:04:38.590> could<00:04:38.770> probably<00:04:39.449> do<00:04:40.449> that

00:04:40.469 --> 00:04:40.479 
half life and you could probably do that

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:45.810 
half life and you could probably do that
so<00:04:41.229> I<00:04:41.260> just<00:04:41.470> shot<00:04:41.620> like<00:04:41.830> five<00:04:42.070> of<00:04:42.100> them<00:04:42.310> and<00:04:44.820> so

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:45.820 
so I just shot like five of them and so

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:48.540 
so I just shot like five of them and so
yeah<00:04:46.000> they<00:04:46.180> combined<00:04:46.570> is<00:04:47.110> either<00:04:47.560> they<00:04:48.280> what

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:48.550 
yeah they combined is either they what

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:51.420 
yeah they combined is either they what
they<00:04:48.820> seem<00:04:49.000> to<00:04:49.030> combine<00:04:49.440> the<00:04:50.440> day<00:04:51.070> definite

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430 
they seem to combine the day definite

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:52.830 
they seem to combine the day definite
combine<00:04:51.669> that's<00:04:51.910> a<00:04:52.030> lot<00:04:52.210> more<00:04:52.330> powerful<00:04:52.720> than

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:52.840 
combine that's a lot more powerful than

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:56.129 
combine that's a lot more powerful than
it<00:04:52.990> was<00:04:53.110> before<00:04:53.490> so<00:04:54.490> if<00:04:54.820> I<00:04:54.970> get<00:04:55.180> lots<00:04:55.660> of<00:04:55.900> them

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:56.139 
it was before so if I get lots of them

00:04:56.139 --> 00:04:59.390 
it was before so if I get lots of them
in<00:04:56.169> fire<00:04:57.039> them<00:04:57.430> at<00:04:57.580> once<00:04:57.880> what<00:04:58.330> will<00:04:58.479> this<00:04:58.630> do

00:04:59.390 --> 00:04:59.400 
in fire them at once what will this do

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.800 
in fire them at once what will this do
no<00:05:00.400> I<00:05:00.430> don't<00:05:00.729> want<00:05:00.850> to<00:05:00.910> fire<00:05:01.030> a<00:05:01.060> piece<00:05:01.780> of

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:01.810 
no I don't want to fire a piece of

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:06.090 
no I don't want to fire a piece of
chicken<00:05:03.990> lots<00:05:04.990> of<00:05:05.110> gravity<00:05:05.560> couldn't<00:05:05.949> let

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:06.100 
chicken lots of gravity couldn't let

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:08.890 
chicken lots of gravity couldn't let
this<00:05:06.250> earth

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:08.900 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:13.180 

and<00:05:09.050> so<00:05:09.889> let's<00:05:10.310> see<00:05:11.530> it's<00:05:12.530> just<00:05:12.740> very<00:05:12.889> more

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:13.190 
and so let's see it's just very more

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:17.250 
and so let's see it's just very more
powerful<00:05:13.520> when<00:05:13.639> this<00:05:13.729> permit<00:05:14.680> yeah

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:17.260 
powerful when this permit yeah

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.370 
powerful when this permit yeah
now<00:05:17.830> it<00:05:18.610> makes<00:05:18.790> a<00:05:18.940> massive<00:05:19.180> blood<00:05:19.480> it<00:05:19.810> sucks<00:05:20.230> in

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:20.380 
now it makes a massive blood it sucks in

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:25.320 
now it makes a massive blood it sucks in
the<00:05:20.560> overflow<00:05:20.710> homes<00:05:21.510> that's<00:05:22.510> awesome<00:05:24.330> it

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:25.330 
the overflow homes that's awesome it

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:26.640 
the overflow homes that's awesome it
seems<00:05:25.510> to<00:05:25.600> be<00:05:25.630> stuck<00:05:25.900> in<00:05:26.050> a<00:05:26.140> mob<00:05:26.320> through<00:05:26.560> the

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:26.650 
seems to be stuck in a mob through the

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:30.350 
seems to be stuck in a mob through the
walls<00:05:26.860> and<00:05:27.130> stuff<00:05:27.340> as<00:05:27.490> well<00:05:27.930> nice<00:05:28.930> awesome

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:30.360 
walls and stuff as well nice awesome

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:34.980
