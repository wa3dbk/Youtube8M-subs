 as you know, it is identified by a great 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:59.580
 screen and the spain in the penn that we 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.070
 will allow many features 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.900
 for our day to day it facilitates us the 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.090
 how we interact with the terminal we 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.190
 allows you to create content all that 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.710
 have to do with notes and interacting 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.720
 with the screen to get the most out of it 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.330
 performance to this screen we can 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.050
 make use of the multi window the multi 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:21.840
 window we take out with the key 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:23.430
 go back and from this panel that 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.320
 we get out we can choose to what 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.320
 applications we access for example 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.050
 Internet 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.350
 Y 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:33.750
 the messages 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.689
 You see how we can simultaneously 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:39.150
 work with the two applications are 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:41.759
 running simultaneously and we can 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.580
 even interact with them by 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:48.810
 example if again I take out the 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:51.500
 multitasking I open the gallery works 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.630
 also horizontally that the interface is 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:58.619
 customizable we have the application of 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:01.260
 gallery and messages we can interact 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:04.200
 with them 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:06.750
 in this button we bring for example 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.729
 this image to the message directly you see 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:14.230
 how is inserted in the message 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:16.989
 other features of the screen and 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:19.239
 the spain is while we have a 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:20.560
 foreground application 

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:23.140
 we make a gesture from the corner 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.720
 top right and bring it to us 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:28.330
 floating window as before with two 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.250
 split windows to what we have is 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:33.849
 one application in the background and another 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:37.270
 floating we could minimize the the 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:39.250
 we still have to go to the menu 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:42.840
 and for example any other application 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:45.430
 that of contacts with the same gesture 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.770
 make it floating we can have up 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:51.030
 five floating windows with which 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:51.030
 we interact simultaneously 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.340
 that we are seeing how we get him 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.620
 performance to this screen is a 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:04.430
 57-inch screen with resolution 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:06.930
 qhd four times hd are 2560 x 1440 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:10.460
 pixels 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:13.380
 we will notice the quality 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:15.840
 when looking at images 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:18.270
 as for the resolution and the palette of 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.960
 colors that is able to represent I'll 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:24.350
 to close this window 

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:25.700
 that color palette representative of 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:28.690
 the super amoled screens that is the 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.690
 technology that we use 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:33.110
 and another very important aspect of 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:36.350
 terminal is the camera both the front 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:37.820
 as the main effort has been made 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:41.500
 in improving them 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:44.510
 the main camera you see for example 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:47.390
 our range of accessories the camera 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:50.930
 main has 16 megapixels with 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:53.180
 video recording in hd in 4k and also 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:55.430
 has optical image stabilizer is 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:57.650
 say the videos in motion or the 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:00.950
 photographs at night will improve a lot 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:02.840
 thanks to this feature also the 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:05.720
 frontal as we were not going to talk about the 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:11.510
 front camera we have improved the quality 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:14.120
 37 megapixels and the functionalities 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:16.489
 of self and we can make a being fill 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:18.590
 panoramic 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:21.130
 where we do the photography and 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:21.130
 spinning 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:24.109
 the terminal 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:31.830
 it takes us all that angle we will see how 

00:04:27.599 --> 00:04:34.259
 compile the image in that panoramic 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:38.360
 with which to take the group fis or in the 

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:38.360
 that the fund has more prominence 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:44.100
 apart from all these functionalities 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:48.060
 It is very important to design the 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:52.440
 Metallic steel frame terminal and 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:54.570
 painted over with this finish the 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:59.130
 back in a very comfortable material for 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:05:01.500
