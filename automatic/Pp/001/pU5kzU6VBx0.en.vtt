00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:00.160 
lay about a thousand eggs just for one
to<00:05:57.330> live<00:05:57.630> and<00:05:58.080> I<00:05:58.310> can't<00:05:59.310> help<00:05:59.700> but<00:05:59.820> remember

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:00.170 
to live and I can't help but remember

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:05.090 
to live and I can't help but remember
about<00:06:01.550> octopus<00:06:02.550> legs<00:06:02.990> networking<00:06:03.990> by<00:06:04.500> Chip

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:05.100 
about octopus legs networking by Chip

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:11.690 
about octopus legs networking by Chip
and<00:06:06.710> in<00:06:07.710> the<00:06:08.100> end<00:06:10.160> that

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:11.700 
and in the end that

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:17.740 
and in the end that
when<00:06:12.060> me<00:06:12.300> we<00:06:12.720> were<00:06:12.930> together<00:06:13.880> that's<00:06:14.880> just<00:06:15.510> it

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:17.750 
when me we were together that's just it

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:32.090 
when me we were together that's just it
that's<00:06:18.750> I<00:06:18.930> guess<00:06:18.990> that's<00:06:19.470> enough<00:06:25.010> us<00:06:30.950> there<00:06:31.950> in

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:32.100 
that's I guess that's enough us there in

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:33.410 
that's I guess that's enough us there in
I<00:06:32.400> think<00:06:32.670> that's<00:06:32.790> like<00:06:33.000> the<00:06:33.090> funniest

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:33.420 
I think that's like the funniest

00:06:33.420 --> 00:07:06.100 
I think that's like the funniest
possible<00:06:33.900> way<00:06:33.990> in<00:06:34.050> which<00:06:34.200> to<00:06:34.380> go<00:06:34.530> about<00:06:34.710> it

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:06.110 

00:07:06.110 --> 00:07:17.230 

you

00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:17.240 

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:33.410
