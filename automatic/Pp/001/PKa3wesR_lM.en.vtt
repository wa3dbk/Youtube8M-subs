I saw the trial of tutors and just the
technology<00:00:38.910> was<00:00:39.570> very<00:00:39.750> impressive<00:00:40.079> for<00:00:40.350> me<00:00:40.469> to

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
technology was very impressive for me to

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.650 
technology was very impressive for me to
begin<00:00:40.950> with<00:00:41.280> I<00:00:41.550> just<00:00:42.000> have<00:00:42.090> to<00:00:42.149> say<00:00:42.210> it<00:00:42.390> works

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
begin with I just have to say it works

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.330 
begin with I just have to say it works
amazingly<00:00:43.230> well<00:00:43.320> I<00:00:43.530> put<00:00:43.860> it<00:00:43.980> on<00:00:44.040> this<00:00:44.160> guitar

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
amazingly well I put it on this guitar

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.569 
amazingly well I put it on this guitar
it<00:00:44.850> got<00:00:45.270> installed<00:00:45.690> and<00:00:46.079> strung<00:00:46.710> up<00:00:46.920> faster

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
it got installed and strung up faster

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.130 
it got installed and strung up faster
than<00:00:47.610> literally<00:00:48.239> that<00:00:48.480> I<00:00:48.510> could<00:00:48.719> put<00:00:48.840> a<00:00:48.870> set<00:00:49.050> of

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
than literally that I could put a set of

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.920 
than literally that I could put a set of
strings<00:00:49.379> on<00:00:49.559> this<00:00:49.710> guitar<00:00:49.860> and<00:00:50.360> I<00:00:51.360> noticed

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
strings on this guitar and I noticed

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.119 
strings on this guitar and I noticed
right<00:00:52.079> away<00:00:52.140> that<00:00:52.379> seemed<00:00:52.770> to<00:00:52.829> have<00:00:52.949> more

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
right away that seemed to have more

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.029 
right away that seemed to have more
sustained<00:00:53.550> and<00:00:53.870> this<00:00:54.870> guitar<00:00:55.230> being<00:00:55.739> that<00:00:55.920> has

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
sustained and this guitar being that has

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.700 
sustained and this guitar being that has
a<00:00:56.070> big<00:00:56.370> screen<00:00:56.550> is<00:00:57.059> a<00:00:57.120> little<00:00:57.500> anyone<00:00:58.500> ever

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
a big screen is a little anyone ever

00:00:58.710 --> 00:00:59.720 
a big screen is a little anyone ever
plays<00:00:58.920> that<00:00:59.100> begs<00:00:59.280> me<00:00:59.399> they're<00:00:59.579> a<00:00:59.609> little

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
plays that begs me they're a little

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.500 
plays that begs me they're a little
finicky<00:01:00.239> their<00:01:01.050> sound<00:01:01.770> great<00:01:02.010> but<00:01:02.359> tuning<00:01:03.359> can

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
finicky their sound great but tuning can

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.030 
finicky their sound great but tuning can
be<00:01:03.600> a<00:01:03.629> bit<00:01:03.809> of<00:01:03.840> an<00:01:04.019> issue<00:01:04.140> with<00:01:04.470> them<00:01:04.589> slipping

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
be a bit of an issue with them slipping

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.740 
be a bit of an issue with them slipping
around<00:01:05.159> a<00:01:05.430> bit<00:01:05.610> but<00:01:06.060> I<00:01:06.119> noticed<00:01:06.479> right<00:01:06.540> away

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
around a bit but I noticed right away

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.929 
around a bit but I noticed right away
that<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.140> guitar<00:01:07.409> is<00:01:07.530> more<00:01:07.740> stable<00:01:08.040> these

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
that the guitar is more stable these

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.820 
that the guitar is more stable these
tutors<00:01:09.210> actually<00:01:09.540> locked<00:01:09.780> down<00:01:10.020> so<00:01:10.350> the

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
tutors actually locked down so the

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.010 
tutors actually locked down so the
tuning<00:01:11.189> just<00:01:11.790> in<00:01:11.939> general<00:01:11.970> is<00:01:12.510> more<00:01:12.780> stable

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
tuning just in general is more stable

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.609 
tuning just in general is more stable
other<00:01:13.890> than<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.850> fact<00:01:15.330> that<00:01:15.509> these<00:01:15.720> motorized

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619
