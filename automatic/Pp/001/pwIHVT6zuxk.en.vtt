a<00:03:07.700> big<00:03:08.000> role<00:03:08.030> that's<00:03:08.900> why<00:03:09.080> sometimes<00:03:09.320> if<00:03:09.710> you

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:09.860 
a big role that's why sometimes if you

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:11.800 
a big role that's why sometimes if you
want<00:03:10.010> me<00:03:10.160> to<00:03:10.190> do<00:03:10.460> an<00:03:10.640> interview<00:03:10.730> just<00:03:11.540> into<00:03:11.780> a

camera where I don't see anybody it's

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.070 
camera where I don't see anybody it's
harder<00:03:13.730> to<00:03:13.880> speak<00:03:14.150> because<00:03:14.450> you<00:03:14.690> don't<00:03:14.900> know

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:15.080 
harder to speak because you don't know

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.380 
harder to speak because you don't know
