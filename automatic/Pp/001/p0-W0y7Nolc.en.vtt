00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
really fun airplane to fly it is it's a

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.880 
really fun airplane to fly it is it's a
combination<00:01:57.420> of<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:58.079> flight<00:01:58.380> star<00:01:58.740> and

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
combination of the flight star and

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.100 
combination of the flight star and
flight<00:01:59.159> start<00:01:59.579> to<00:02:00.119> design<00:02:00.600> which<00:02:00.810> has<00:02:00.960> been

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
flight start to design which has been

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.289 
flight start to design which has been
around<00:02:01.380> since<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:01.829> 80s<00:02:02.100> designed<00:02:02.820> by<00:02:03.000> Tom

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
around since the 80s designed by Tom

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:04.730 
around since the 80s designed by Tom
beginning<00:02:03.810> it's<00:02:04.259> a<00:02:04.409> straightforward

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
beginning it's a straightforward

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.950 
beginning it's a straightforward
ultralight<00:02:05.579> airframe<00:02:06.000> but<00:02:06.479> it's<00:02:06.630> been<00:02:06.750> beefed

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
ultralight airframe but it's been beefed

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.930 
ultralight airframe but it's been beefed
up<00:02:07.140> for<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:07.799> heavier<00:02:08.069> loads<00:02:08.340> that

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
up for the heavier loads that

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.780 
up for the heavier loads that
electric<00:02:09.360> aircraft<00:02:09.570> takes<00:02:10.140> and<00:02:10.440> it<00:02:11.220> kind<00:02:11.670> of

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
electric aircraft takes and it kind of

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.240 
electric aircraft takes and it kind of
flies<00:02:11.970> like<00:02:12.240> a<00:02:12.270> Piper<00:02:12.570> Cub<00:02:12.690> it's<00:02:13.230> slow<00:02:13.650> it<00:02:14.070> gets

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
flies like a Piper Cub it's slow it gets

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:15.980 
flies like a Piper Cub it's slow it gets
off<00:02:14.430> the<00:02:14.580> ground<00:02:14.610> real<00:02:15.030> quick<00:02:15.360> a<00:02:15.570> little<00:02:15.840> heavy

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
off the ground real quick a little heavy

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.700 
off the ground real quick a little heavy
on<00:02:16.080> the<00:02:16.170> stick

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
on the stick

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:18.470 
on the stick
take<00:02:16.920> some<00:02:17.160> rudder<00:02:17.400> but<00:02:17.940> we<00:02:18.120> don't<00:02:18.300> have<00:02:18.420> the

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
take some rudder but we don't have the

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.150 
take some rudder but we don't have the
tail-dragger<00:02:18.690> problem<00:02:19.380> and<00:02:19.500> landing<00:02:19.830> so<00:02:20.010> it's

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
tail-dragger problem and landing so it's

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.490 
tail-dragger problem and landing so it's
really<00:02:20.490> nice<00:02:20.640> that<00:02:20.670> way<00:02:21.090> it<00:02:21.420> glides<00:02:21.930> real<00:02:22.230> nice

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
really nice that way it glides real nice

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.680 
really nice that way it glides real nice
it<00:02:22.830> makes<00:02:23.040> power<00:02:23.490> off<00:02:23.730> landings<00:02:24.180> real<00:02:24.360> nice<00:02:24.540> it

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
it makes power off landings real nice it

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.870 
it makes power off landings real nice it
does<00:02:24.870> all<00:02:25.020> of<00:02:25.080> that<00:02:25.320> like<00:02:26.070> a<00:02:26.100> normal<00:02:26.520> airplane

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
does all of that like a normal airplane

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.210 
does all of that like a normal airplane
does<00:02:27.270> and<00:02:27.570> yet<00:02:27.840> it's<00:02:28.080> very<00:02:28.530> light<00:02:28.800> it<00:02:29.040> weighs

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
does and yet it's very light it weighs

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.790 
does and yet it's very light it weighs
in<00:02:29.430> at<00:02:29.520> about<00:02:29.610> 400<00:02:30.240> pounds<00:02:30.660> empty<00:02:30.840> and<00:02:31.260> it<00:02:31.650> can

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
in at about 400 pounds empty and it can

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.000 
in at about 400 pounds empty and it can
hold<00:02:31.950> a<00:02:32.130> 220<00:02:32.910> pound<00:02:32.940> pilot<00:02:33.570> how<00:02:34.350> long<00:02:34.560> will<00:02:34.980> it

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
hold a 220 pound pilot how long will it

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.220 
hold a 220 pound pilot how long will it
fly<00:02:35.310> on<00:02:35.550> a<00:02:35.580> charge<00:02:35.880> right<00:02:36.540> now<00:02:36.720> we<00:02:36.780> get<00:02:36.990> about

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
fly on a charge right now we get about

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.800 
fly on a charge right now we get about
an<00:02:37.380> hour<00:02:37.530> of<00:02:37.950> cruise<00:02:38.430> flight<00:02:38.670> plus<00:02:39.330> a<00:02:39.450> reserve

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
an hour of cruise flight plus a reserve

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.870 
an hour of cruise flight plus a reserve
we<00:02:40.350> know<00:02:40.470> the<00:02:40.680> battery<00:02:40.860> technology<00:02:41.160> will

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
we know the battery technology will

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.000 
we know the battery technology will
increase<00:02:42.510> over<00:02:42.870> time<00:02:43.020> and<00:02:43.290> that'll<00:02:43.560> only<00:02:43.710> get

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
increase over time and that'll only get

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.680 
increase over time and that'll only get
better<00:02:44.160> so<00:02:44.820> for<00:02:45.030> about<00:02:45.120> an<00:02:45.300> hour's<00:02:45.510> flight

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
better so for about an hour's flight

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.420 
better so for about an hour's flight
takes<00:02:46.110> a<00:02:46.200> 2<00:02:46.380> hour<00:02:46.530> charge<00:02:46.920> and<00:02:47.160> you're<00:02:47.250> back<00:02:47.400> up

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
takes a 2 hour charge and you're back up

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.640 
takes a 2 hour charge and you're back up
in<00:02:47.730> the<00:02:47.820> air<00:02:47.940> again<00:02:48.060> as<00:02:48.330> many<00:02:48.900> ultralights<00:02:49.500> are
