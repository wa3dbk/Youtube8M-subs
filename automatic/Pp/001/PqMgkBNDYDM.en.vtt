00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:05.220
 hello to all the new ones of a Latin world 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.080
 finally after so much time e 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.990
 here we are again talking about our loved ones 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.929
 bunnies and I apologize very much for the 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:16.800
 long wait but unfortunately though 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:19.290
 camera this long absence 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.350
 here it is and they were due to the fact that 

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:24.750
 I got married I moved and 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:29.040
 so I was so busy that 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:31.579
 I could not make videos and uploaded 

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:34.879
 someone because he was older but 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:38.070
 all sung and various things 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:40.370
 so here we are already tibet problems 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:44.159
 it's about how you're finding yourself in the new one 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:47.690
 then he points out that with yamaha a lot 

00:00:44.159 --> 00:00:50.640
 curious so grandpa magician for him 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:54.870
 explore new homes new things 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.550
 places is a very thing indeed 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.159
 I must say that since I was born of 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.789
 live almost pretend to be happy too 

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:05.969
 because before in the old house 

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:08.850
 I'll take my room and bedroom 

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:11.280
 I could get out into the other rooms not 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.689
 we always say once a day half 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.490
 riina no more 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:18.030
 while in which all the available 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:20.549
 kitchen the hallway the stairs and the bathroom 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.799
 in the bedroom because of the 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:32.149
 bedroom is the faux leather bed 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:34.799
 and java scratched for years then asks 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:37.380
 even from the etta room there is no a 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.700
 arrangement because it is my studio there 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.869
 I am therefore 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:47.850
 and on the ground he was doing because he saw in 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:50.360
 hand but we avoided then I give myself a 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:53.210
 little bit today have not done their own 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:56.569
 how to set the rabbit in a 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:02:01.409
 apartment is very simple 

00:01:56.569 --> 00:02:05.039
 then you must first bring it in 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:08.849
 a new one then transferred to his 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:12.480
 same cage then place the cage 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:16.849
 in a closed room and professed one 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:19.709
 cooking a bedroom and then practically 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:21.989
 leave the cage closed for at least one 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:23.730
 couple of hours in such a way that is the 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:26.220
 rabbit realizes that it is a place 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.769
 sure to and feel more comfortable 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.510
 when you see that it calms down 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:33.180
 because there and then changing place yes 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.880
 scares when to see the bunny 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:38.790
 start you're quieter you can 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:41.630
 open the cage and wait for the 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:45.750
 rabbit and explore the first room 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:48.030
 maybe the next day to open at times to 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.209
 explore another room 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:54.090
 that is, this must all be gradual 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:57.389
 first of all because we risk the 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:03:00.540
 gorino exists symbolic too much and second 

00:02:57.389 --> 00:03:03.440
 I used it because we risk for rabbits 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:06.530
 unsterilized that starts to mark 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:08.800
 if as a type and your bunny is 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:11.120
 sterilized 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:14.600
 taricone does not have it marquez the 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:16.430
 new territory while if not yet 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.860
 to be realized 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.000
 get ready to collect ppe balls in 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:22.580
 all corners 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.950
 also for this reason it is a memory anyway 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.150
 very important sterilization for 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:28.130
 prevent a new design of the 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.960
 writer in the form then announces me 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:32.210
 I recommend if you don't have it yet 

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:34.720
 look at you my video and on 

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:37.310
 rabbit sterilization 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.620
 so I recommend the discovery of 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.270
 however home must be done in 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:45.320
 gradually 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:47.959
 I recommend you in a new home and there 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:50.420
 so however you are dangers 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:54.440
 be very careful to authorize all 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:57.020
 electric wires or maybe apparently the 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:04:00.170
 spaces that there may be three pieces of furniture 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:00.800
 I maybe come in but then can't anymore 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:03.650
 go out 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:06.560
 in fact, she was forced to do 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:09.620
 sofa because obviously she slipped on 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.830
 of the cathedral and no problem because already 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:15.230
 space sam and re-enter to exit 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:16.820
 he bit it and so it is called yes 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:19.370
 cloth risked to be come a 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:21.380
 Intestinal blockage at extreme is 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:24.530
 really happy to be here is 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:26.810
 really all the grating available does 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:29.800
 what he wants even if his corner 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:31.970
 favorite is the one next to the fridge 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:34.400
 another important thing that I owe you 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:36.800
 say about changing your colander 

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.630
 and awaits the temperature changes that 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:43.130
 I wanted to say he went to the air conditioner 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:44.960
 turned on because that is her in the house 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:47.300
 where a first man is the air conditioner 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:48.830
 it wasn't there but it was very windy and i'm 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.560
 very well 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:53.780
 and while in this house there is a lot 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:54.449
 hot so I stretch the conditioner 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:57.680
 switched on 

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:59.819
 I never less than 28 degrees 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.870
 leaving only during the hottest hours 

00:04:59.819 --> 00:05:03.089
 of the day 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:06.689
 I still hope this video looks good 

00:05:03.089 --> 00:05:11.219
 because unfortunately it is the kitchen does not have 

00:05:06.689 --> 00:05:14.729
 very bright and already it's half past six 

00:05:11.219 --> 00:05:16.469
 pass and therefore there is little light I hope in 

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:18.529
 video you may be dumb not kiss a 

00:05:16.469 --> 00:05:22.110
 all by me and by div 

00:05:18.529 --> 00:05:24.330
 I remind you that before entering the 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:26.909
 rabbit in any new new room 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:28.919
 home and check that there aren't any 

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:31.139
 objective dangers of plastic that 

00:05:28.919 --> 00:05:34.279
 can be chewed ingested and 

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:38.339
 stop accessories with me could 

00:05:34.279 --> 00:05:41.789
 then bite ingest ie against the 

00:05:38.339 --> 00:05:45.569
 the good side of everything so I guess 

00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:47.639
 this is all a kiss from but is the 

00:05:45.569 --> 00:05:51.740
 sweet girl from what time she is doing 

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:51.740
 a goodbye hello
