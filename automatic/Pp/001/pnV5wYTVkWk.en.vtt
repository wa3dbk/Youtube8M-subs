00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.370 
Dean okay so it's on you can see the
score<00:01:15.230> and<00:01:15.500> I<00:01:15.560> push<00:01:15.770> on<00:01:16.040> one<00:01:16.340> more<00:01:16.430> time<00:01:16.490> and

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380 
score and I push on one more time and

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.830 
score and I push on one more time and
for<00:01:18.380> the<00:01:18.620> sake<00:01:18.920> of<00:01:18.950> hearing<00:01:19.550> I<00:01:19.790> am<00:01:19.970> going<00:01:20.420> to

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
for the sake of hearing I am going to

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.440 
for the sake of hearing I am going to
just<00:01:21.680> turn<00:01:21.860> this<00:01:21.980> down<00:01:22.160> off<00:01:22.400> in<00:01:22.580> a<00:01:22.670> second<00:01:23.120> here

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
just turn this down off in a second here

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.440 
just turn this down off in a second here
so<00:01:23.480> they<00:01:23.750> can<00:01:24.400> but<00:01:25.400> that's<00:01:25.520> the<00:01:25.820> actual<00:01:26.180> music

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
so they can but that's the actual music

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.250 
so they can but that's the actual music
so<00:01:26.720> yeah<00:01:27.130> anyways<00:01:28.360> you're<00:01:29.360> just<00:01:29.600> basically

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:30.260 
so yeah anyways you're just basically

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:31.450 
so yeah anyways you're just basically
this<00:01:30.470> is<00:01:30.590> the<00:01:30.650> whole<00:01:30.770> game<00:01:30.920> you<00:01:30.980> just<00:01:31.280> keep

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460 
this is the whole game you just keep

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.720 
this is the whole game you just keep
walking<00:01:31.670> down<00:01:32.030> your<00:01:32.390> score<00:01:32.780> gets<00:01:32.990> higher<00:01:33.730> the

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:34.730 
walking down your score gets higher the

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:36.580 
walking down your score gets higher the
first<00:01:34.940> level<00:01:35.270> I<00:01:35.420> believe<00:01:35.450> is<00:01:35.930> just<00:01:35.960> hiding

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
first level I believe is just hiding

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.830 
first level I believe is just hiding
from<00:01:37.070> the<00:01:37.460> Beast<00:01:37.670> which<00:01:38.000> I<00:01:38.240> don't<00:01:38.300> know<00:01:38.540> why

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
from the Beast which I don't know why

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.260 
from the Beast which I don't know why
you're<00:01:39.140> hiding<00:01:39.530> but<00:01:39.800> you<00:01:40.100> are<00:01:40.280> and<00:01:40.610> the<00:01:41.030> reason

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
you're hiding but you are and the reason

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.030 
you're hiding but you are and the reason
I<00:01:41.360> know<00:01:41.390> that<00:01:41.510> is<00:01:41.660> because<00:01:42.110> if<00:01:42.410> he<00:01:42.620> sees<00:01:42.860> you

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.040 
I know that is because if he sees you

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.850 
I know that is because if he sees you
your<00:01:43.250> score<00:01:43.520> goes<00:01:43.550> down<00:01:44.210> and<00:01:44.750> I<00:01:45.500> think<00:01:45.620> the

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:45.860 
your score goes down and I think the

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.550 
your score goes down and I think the
flower<00:01:46.070> is<00:01:46.310> just<00:01:46.490> a<00:01:46.580> timer<00:01:46.910> I<00:01:47.350> used<00:01:48.350> to<00:01:48.470> think

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560 
flower is just a timer I used to think

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.260 
flower is just a timer I used to think
that<00:01:48.680> Oh<00:01:48.890> does<00:01:49.130> he<00:01:49.160> die<00:01:49.490> or<00:01:49.520> something<00:01:50.060> that

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
that Oh does he die or something that

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:51.880 
that Oh does he die or something that
the<00:01:50.360> flower<00:01:50.540> goes<00:01:50.750> down<00:01:50.930> or<00:01:51.170> do<00:01:51.320> you<00:01:51.410> lose<00:01:51.650> I

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:51.890 
the flower goes down or do you lose I

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.140 
the flower goes down or do you lose I
don't<00:01:52.130> know<00:01:52.850> I'm<00:01:53.600> pretty<00:01:53.659> sure<00:01:53.990> it's<00:01:54.200> timer<00:01:55.150> so

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:56.150 
don't know I'm pretty sure it's timer so

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.950 
don't know I'm pretty sure it's timer so
I'm<00:01:57.080> gonna<00:01:57.200> go<00:01:57.350> to<00:01:57.530> the<00:01:57.710> second<00:01:58.070> level<00:01:58.190> I

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
I'm gonna go to the second level I

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.320 
I'm gonna go to the second level I
believe<00:01:59.960> every<00:02:00.470> it<00:02:01.159> gets<00:02:01.370> more<00:02:01.640> complex

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:02.330 
believe every it gets more complex

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.390 
believe every it gets more complex
leader<00:02:02.720> which<00:02:03.409> is<00:02:03.440> why<00:02:03.680> I'm<00:02:03.770> gonna<00:02:03.920> just<00:02:04.130> go<00:02:04.280> on

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:04.400 
leader which is why I'm gonna just go on

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.719 
leader which is why I'm gonna just go on
to<00:02:04.520> that<00:02:04.640> level<00:02:04.820> I<00:02:06.430> don't<00:02:07.430> know<00:02:07.550> how<00:02:07.670> many

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
to that level I don't know how many

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:09.009 
to that level I don't know how many
levels<00:02:07.940> are<00:02:08.090> in<00:02:08.269> the<00:02:08.420> game<00:02:08.450> there<00:02:08.869> might<00:02:08.989> be

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:09.019 
levels are in the game there might be

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:12.130 
levels are in the game there might be
three<00:02:09.590> or<00:02:09.619> four<00:02:10.390> natori<00:02:11.390> one<00:02:11.599> was<00:02:11.750> like<00:02:11.840> four

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.110 
don't know what my friend actually beat
that<00:02:15.560> one

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.440 

yeah<00:02:20.050> so<00:02:20.379> like<00:02:20.950> I<00:02:21.099> said<00:02:21.160> it's<00:02:21.489> a<00:02:21.610> really<00:02:21.970> basic

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
yeah so like I said it's a really basic

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.699 
yeah so like I said it's a really basic
game<00:02:22.989> it's<00:02:23.230> just<00:02:23.349> a<00:02:23.500> whole<00:02:23.650> bunch<00:02:23.800> of<00:02:24.040> dodge<00:02:25.709> at

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
game it's just a whole bunch of dodge at

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:29.430 
game it's just a whole bunch of dodge at
least<00:02:26.890> for<00:02:27.040> the<00:02:27.129> first<00:02:27.280> level<00:02:27.730> it's<00:02:28.440> just

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
least for the first level it's just

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.400 
least for the first level it's just
ridiculous

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
ridiculous

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:39.839 
ridiculous

thinking of the toys everyone yeah
that's<00:03:30.549> pretty<00:03:30.850> much<00:03:30.970> the<00:03:31.480> whole<00:03:31.750> game<00:03:32.290> it

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:32.709 
that's pretty much the whole game it

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:35.629 
that's pretty much the whole game it
just<00:03:32.739> gets<00:03:33.519> more<00:03:33.760> complex<00:03:34.150> after<00:03:34.510> this<00:03:34.720> and

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:35.639 
just gets more complex after this and

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:39.120 
just gets more complex after this and
yeah<00:03:36.639> so<00:03:37.150> I<00:03:37.510> know<00:03:38.230> it's<00:03:38.500> not<00:03:38.620> that<00:03:38.680> great<00:03:38.950> of<00:03:39.010> a

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.130
