know what brain research lab does it's

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.649 
know what brain research lab does it's
pretty<00:01:38.640> much<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:38.850> heart<00:01:39.180> and<00:01:39.299> soul<00:01:39.479> behind

play<00:03:19.450> another<00:03:19.780> monster<00:03:19.989> in<00:03:20.349> the<00:03:20.440> same<00:03:20.650> turn<00:03:20.919> so

00:03:21.539 --> 00:03:21.549 
play another monster in the same turn so

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:24.629 
play another monster in the same turn so
there's<00:03:21.730> your<00:03:21.790> monster<00:03:22.209> now<00:03:23.019> here<00:03:23.230> begins<00:03:23.639> by

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:24.639 
there's your monster now here begins by

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:26.729 
there's your monster now here begins by
using<00:03:24.849> my<00:03:25.030> Master's<00:03:25.389> ability<00:03:25.750> we<00:03:26.470> can<00:03:26.590> place

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739 
using my Master's ability we can place

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:28.460 
using my Master's ability we can place
another<00:03:26.980> counter<00:03:27.370> on<00:03:27.549> brain<00:03:27.849> research<00:03:28.150> lab

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470

go through your deck for another card
and<00:03:32.430> pretty<00:03:33.430> much<00:03:33.489> what<00:03:33.910> we're<00:03:34.000> going<00:03:34.090> to<00:03:34.209> do

00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:34.299 
and pretty much what we're going to do

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:36.059 
and pretty much what we're going to do
now<00:03:34.480> is<00:03:34.750> just<00:03:34.780> keep<00:03:35.139> destroying<00:03:35.470> monsters<00:03:35.889> and

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:36.069 
now is just keep destroying monsters and

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:37.530 
now is just keep destroying monsters and
building<00:03:36.280> up<00:03:36.340> counters<00:03:36.730> until<00:03:37.180> you<00:03:37.329> have

00:05:04.719 --> 00:05:06.149 
telekinetic power well you'll have
plenty<00:05:04.840> of<00:05:05.139> monsters<00:05:05.289> in<00:05:05.530> the<00:05:05.620> graveyard<00:05:05.710> and

00:05:06.149 --> 00:05:06.159 
plenty of monsters in the graveyard and

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:07.680 
plenty of monsters in the graveyard and
especially<00:05:06.789> once<00:05:07.060> you<00:05:07.120> start<00:05:07.389> cycling

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:07.690 
especially once you start cycling

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:10.290 
especially once you start cycling
through<00:05:08.020> monsters<00:05:08.560> with<00:05:08.770> your<00:05:09.250> mind<00:05:09.940> master

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:10.300 
through monsters with your mind master

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:12.719 
through monsters with your mind master
and<00:05:10.500> then<00:05:11.500> each<00:05:11.740> one<00:05:11.979> of<00:05:12.069> your<00:05:12.159> boys<00:05:12.340> will<00:05:12.639> have

00:05:12.719 --> 00:05:12.729 
and then each one of your boys will have

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:14.760 
and then each one of your boys will have
4000<00:05:13.300> attack<00:05:13.389> and<00:05:13.810> be<00:05:14.050> able<00:05:14.110> to<00:05:14.289> attack<00:05:14.469> twice

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:14.770 
4000 attack and be able to attack twice

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:18.059 
4000 attack and be able to attack twice
and<00:05:15.039> that's<00:05:15.699> essentially<00:05:16.029> the<00:05:16.210> otk<00:05:16.569> at<00:05:17.069> this

00:05:18.059 --> 00:05:18.069 
and that's essentially the otk at this

00:05:18.069 --> 00:05:20.010 
and that's essentially the otk at this
point<00:05:18.370> you<00:05:18.520> do<00:05:18.729> want<00:05:19.000> to<00:05:19.240> have<00:05:19.419> these<00:05:19.629> cards

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:20.020 
point you do want to have these cards

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:21.059 
point you do want to have these cards
that<00:05:20.139> will<00:05:20.199> clear<00:05:20.409> out<00:05:20.529> your<00:05:20.560> opponent's<00:05:20.919> back

00:05:21.059 --> 00:05:21.069 
that will clear out your opponent's back

00:05:21.069 --> 00:05:22.499 
that will clear out your opponent's back
row<00:05:21.279> or<00:05:21.430> anything<00:05:21.639> like<00:05:21.669> that<00:05:21.789> so<00:05:22.150> they<00:05:22.300> can't

00:05:22.499 --> 00:05:22.509 
row or anything like that so they can't

00:05:22.509 --> 00:05:25.309 
row or anything like that so they can't
stop<00:05:22.750> it<00:05:22.930> but<00:05:23.770> if<00:05:24.039> you<00:05:24.159> don't<00:05:24.370> whatever<00:05:24.969> and

00:05:25.309 --> 00:05:25.319 
stop it but if you don't whatever and

00:05:25.319 --> 00:05:27.570 
stop it but if you don't whatever and
doing<00:05:26.319> the<00:05:26.409> duel<00:05:26.560> it's<00:05:26.919> always<00:05:27.129> good<00:05:27.370> to<00:05:27.400> have

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:27.580 
doing the duel it's always good to have

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:28.920 
doing the duel it's always good to have
counter<00:05:27.940> cleaners<00:05:28.210> especially<00:05:28.629> if<00:05:28.690> you<00:05:28.750> don't

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:28.930 
counter cleaners especially if you don't

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:30.300 
counter cleaners especially if you don't
get<00:05:29.080> though<00:05:29.229> TK<00:05:29.620> and<00:05:29.770> you<00:05:29.830> want<00:05:29.949> to<00:05:30.039> clear<00:05:30.190> off

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:30.310 
get though TK and you want to clear off

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:32.339 
get though TK and you want to clear off
the<00:05:30.430> counters<00:05:30.729> off<00:05:30.879> brain<00:05:31.180> research<00:05:31.509> because

00:05:32.339 --> 00:05:32.349 
the counters off brain research because

00:05:32.349 --> 00:05:33.480 
the counters off brain research because
it<00:05:32.469> will<00:05:32.650> kill<00:05:32.889> you<00:05:33.099> if<00:05:33.250> your<00:05:33.370> opponent

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:33.490 
it will kill you if your opponent

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:37.140 
it will kill you if your opponent
destroys<00:05:33.969> it<00:05:34.150> and<00:05:35.279> you<00:05:36.279> have<00:05:36.400> a<00:05:36.430> like<00:05:36.969> eight

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:37.150 
destroys it and you have a like eight

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:39.510 
destroys it and you have a like eight
counters<00:05:37.509> on<00:05:37.659> it<00:05:37.779> and<00:05:38.099> it's<00:05:39.099> always<00:05:39.370> good<00:05:39.490> to

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:39.520 
counters on it and it's always good to

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.700 
counters on it and it's always good to
have<00:05:39.729> some<00:05:39.909> reckless<00:05:40.089> greed<00:05:40.300> set<00:05:40.690> just<00:05:41.589> get

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:41.710 
have some reckless greed set just get

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:42.839 
have some reckless greed set just get
them<00:05:41.800> ready<00:05:41.919> especially<00:05:42.520> if<00:05:42.669> you<00:05:42.819> have

00:05:42.839 --> 00:05:42.849 
them ready especially if you have

00:05:42.849 --> 00:05:44.490 
them ready especially if you have
multiple<00:05:43.150> ones<00:05:43.539> in<00:05:43.659> the<00:05:43.719> same<00:05:43.900> turn<00:05:44.139> the<00:05:44.349> only

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:44.500 
multiple ones in the same turn the only

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:46.350 
multiple ones in the same turn the only
have<00:05:44.620> to<00:05:44.680> pay<00:05:44.800> the<00:05:44.919> cost<00:05:45.099> once<00:05:45.400> which<00:05:46.000> is<00:05:46.120> nice

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:46.360 
have to pay the cost once which is nice

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:48.570 
have to pay the cost once which is nice
so<00:05:46.629> you<00:05:47.199> can<00:05:47.319> get<00:05:47.409> like<00:05:47.589> four<00:05:47.800> or<00:05:47.979> six<00:05:48.219> cards

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:48.580 
so you can get like four or six cards

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:51.149 
so you can get like four or six cards
and<00:05:48.789> only<00:05:49.330> way<00:05:49.449> two<00:05:49.509> turns<00:05:49.919> that's<00:05:50.919> pretty

00:05:51.149 --> 00:05:51.159 
and only way two turns that's pretty

00:05:51.159 --> 00:05:53.760 
and only way two turns that's pretty
much<00:05:51.219> it<00:05:51.339> guys<00:05:52.139> okay<00:05:53.139> now<00:05:53.469> we're<00:05:53.560> going<00:05:53.650> to<00:05:53.710> go

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:53.770 
much it guys okay now we're going to go

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:55.170 
much it guys okay now we're going to go
over<00:05:53.860> how<00:05:54.190> to<00:05:54.219> duel<00:05:54.550> your<00:05:54.699> opponent<00:05:55.029> and<00:05:55.089> win

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:55.180 
over how to duel your opponent and win

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:58.439 
over how to duel your opponent and win
when<00:05:55.690> you<00:05:55.810> don't<00:05:56.080> get<00:05:56.229> the<00:05:56.319> otk<00:05:56.710> and<00:05:57.360> this<00:05:58.360> is

00:05:58.439 --> 00:05:58.449 
when you don't get the otk and this is

00:05:58.449 --> 00:06:01.589 
when you don't get the otk and this is
essentially<00:05:58.900> all<00:05:59.080> about<00:05:59.440> st.<00:06:00.279> growing<00:06:00.569> so<00:06:01.569> we

00:06:01.589 --> 00:06:01.599 
essentially all about st. growing so we

00:06:01.599 --> 00:06:04.499 
essentially all about st. growing so we
have<00:06:01.810> five<00:06:02.020> tuners<00:06:02.379> in<00:06:02.409> the<00:06:02.500> deck<00:06:02.740> and<00:06:03.389> most<00:06:04.389> of

00:06:04.499 --> 00:06:04.509 
have five tuners in the deck and most of

00:06:04.509 --> 00:06:06.589 
have five tuners in the deck and most of
the<00:06:04.569> monsters<00:06:04.900> that<00:06:04.930> we<00:06:05.139> have<00:06:05.349> our<00:06:05.680> four<00:06:06.009> stars

00:06:06.589 --> 00:06:06.599 
the monsters that we have our four stars

00:06:06.599 --> 00:06:09.629 
the monsters that we have our four stars
so<00:06:07.599> that<00:06:07.779> means<00:06:07.960> we<00:06:08.259> can<00:06:08.469> synchro<00:06:09.250> for<00:06:09.430> a<00:06:09.460> five

00:06:09.629 --> 00:06:09.639 
so that means we can synchro for a five

00:06:09.639 --> 00:06:15.390 
so that means we can synchro for a five
star<00:06:09.879> a<00:06:10.620> six-star<00:06:11.620> and<00:06:12.659> a<00:06:13.659> seven<00:06:13.900> star<00:06:14.080> and<00:06:14.400> if

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:15.400 
star a six-star and a seven star and if

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:17.189 
star a six-star and a seven star and if
you<00:06:15.520> pop<00:06:15.729> in<00:06:15.879> some<00:06:16.060> craniums<00:06:16.509> you<00:06:16.930> can<00:06:17.080> do

00:06:17.189 --> 00:06:17.199 
you pop in some craniums you can do

00:06:17.199 --> 00:06:18.659 
you pop in some craniums you can do
eight<00:06:17.379> and<00:06:17.560> nine<00:06:17.680> so<00:06:17.949> you<00:06:18.039> can<00:06:18.190> pretty<00:06:18.339> much<00:06:18.400> do

00:06:18.659 --> 00:06:18.669 
eight and nine so you can pretty much do

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:21.170 
eight and nine so you can pretty much do
whatever<00:06:19.060> you<00:06:19.270> want<00:06:19.479> here<00:06:19.659> and<00:06:19.779> that's

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:21.180 
whatever you want here and that's

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:23.159 
whatever you want here and that's
essentially<00:06:22.180> what<00:06:22.389> you<00:06:22.479> need<00:06:22.629> to<00:06:22.719> do<00:06:22.870> if<00:06:23.050> you

00:06:23.159 --> 00:06:23.169 
essentially what you need to do if you

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:25.019 
essentially what you need to do if you
don't<00:06:23.289> get<00:06:23.440> the<00:06:23.560> otk<00:06:23.949> and<00:06:24.159> there<00:06:24.699> are<00:06:24.819> some

00:06:25.019 --> 00:06:25.029 
don't get the otk and there are some

00:06:25.029 --> 00:06:26.309 
don't get the otk and there are some
good<00:06:25.060> cards<00:06:25.389> in<00:06:25.539> this<00:06:25.629> deck<00:06:25.690> some<00:06:26.169> good
