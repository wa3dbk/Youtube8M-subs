00:00:00.609 --> 00:00:03.090
 hello in touch with you gulevich pavel 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.180
 during the day did not see a lesson in work in 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:08.500
 photo shock program so in this tutorial I 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.740
 tell you about how modern 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.109
 photos convey a vintage look 

00:00:13.109 --> 00:00:15.249
 to complete this lesson to us 

00:00:15.249 --> 00:00:17.480
 take 2 and took a living 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.660
 the first image is an image 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:21.269
 old papers 

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:23.390
 you can find it in additional 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:24.340
 materials 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:26.760
 and the second image is an image 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.140
 whom you want to add age 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.069
 open the photoshop image data 

00:00:33.069 --> 00:00:35.429
 and then with the help and tools 

00:00:35.429 --> 00:00:36.440
 displacement 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.680
 drag your image may 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.200
 image of old paper 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.020
 if you use 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.880
 images of steel paper taken from 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:47.830
 additional materials 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:50.080
 need your image 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:53.140
 you can put a gray area 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.560
 it follows 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.130
 with the tool 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:59.070
 move combine game 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.910
 the value of your window image in return 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.810
 sides of the gray area 

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:07.280
 then in the main menu of the program and 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.620
 Kirov's ruler food not 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:11.030
 dissolving 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:12.640
 and select the command 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.020
 scaling 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.850
 further clamp and hold clamped 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:20.189
 shift keys 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.400
 and here are the way 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.759
 moving 1 of the corner 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:25.509
 markers 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:27.150
 achieve combination 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.230
 third party its image with 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:32.730
 one of the two remaining parties 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:34.750
 gray by area 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.770
 Of course it is possible that with 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:37.979
 scaling 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.020
 you can immediately match two 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.860
 remaining side 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:43.980
 to complete the scaling and its 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.840
 need to confirm 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.750
 feathers with a tool 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.899
 rectangular selection 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:53.529
 it is necessary to adjust however the remaining 

00:01:53.529 --> 00:01:56.159
 but itâ€™s worth considering 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.270
 the fact that he 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.630
 similar meetings will be held 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:00.299
 by 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.490
 removing a fragment from your icons 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.789
 image and if the given fragment is for 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:08.179
 you care who you can him 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:11.650
 save by moving the image and then 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.429
 removing less important points 

00:02:14.429 --> 00:02:17.429
 on the opposite side 

00:02:19.999 --> 00:02:22.879
 or how it happened in my case 

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:24.879
 remove 

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:26.919
 part image 

00:02:26.919 --> 00:02:29.919
 one side 

00:02:31.589 --> 00:02:32.869
 and then 

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:35.869
 with the opposite 

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:43.839
 now when the image 

00:02:43.839 --> 00:02:46.309
 placed in gray in the area due 

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:47.020
 way 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.200
 change her position 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.539
 top layer is heard by the image 

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:53.879
 overlap 

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:55.689
 and additives given conditions 

00:02:55.689 --> 00:02:58.099
 insignificant amount of noise 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:00.560
 setting to configure which you 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.809
 now see on your 

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:06.259
 screens then click next 

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:07.569
 next what will be 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:10.869
 further work is the adjustment of colors 

00:03:10.869 --> 00:03:12.699
 image or in other words 

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:15.589
 color correction image 

00:03:15.589 --> 00:03:17.449
 which is necessary for giving 

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:19.009
 images relevant 

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:20.529
 shades stadiums 

00:03:20.529 --> 00:03:22.770
 so the first thing we will do 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:24.970
 this abolished saturation for 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.390
 go to this main menu 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:29.149
 picture 

00:03:29.149 --> 00:03:32.479
 collection and select a color tone command 

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:33.899
 saturation 

00:03:33.899 --> 00:03:35.310
 in these settings 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.590
 set and game saturation value 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.289
 range from minus fifty 

00:03:40.289 --> 00:03:42.450
 to minus sixty 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:43.979
 or you can ask 

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:46.269
 This value is according to your 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:48.959
 wishes can also data 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:51.959
 settings change light 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:55.809
 and change the brightness 

00:03:55.809 --> 00:03:58.049
 after completing the data at the construction site 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:03:59.879
 Press "Next 

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:02.180
 and move on from setting the color 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.180
 of balance 

00:04:05.999 --> 00:04:07.799
 these settings are necessary 

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:09.029
 to produce 

00:04:09.029 --> 00:04:10.269
 gain 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:12.989
 Krasnov 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:15.949
 green 

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:18.949
 and everything had colors 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.240
 in summer, pay attention to 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.150
 quality to balance 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:27.090
 were the average goods 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:28.990
 upon completion of setup 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:32.400
 color balance click yes 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.380
 it remains to apply the latter 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.570
 corrective on the construction site which 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:38.879
 called photo filter 

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:42.349
 run yes but install m 

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:43.770
 as a color 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:45.830
 Orange 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:47.729
 set initially density 

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:50.620
 equal to 23 five percent 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:53.740
 and click cube where 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:54.970
 on this from on recreating 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:57.830
 vintage photos is complete 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:00.330
 I hope that the lesson data was for 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:01.559
 you useful 

00:05:01.559 --> 00:05:03.799
 Thank you for your attention and at the meeting in
