because that's what you guys like to see
over<00:00:26.550> here<00:00:26.580> at<00:00:26.760> cod<00:00:26.939> ops<00:00:27.090> foot<00:00:27.359> and<00:00:27.570> it<00:00:28.170> seems

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
over here at cod ops foot and it seems

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.169 
over here at cod ops foot and it seems
bit<00:00:28.560> impractical<00:00:28.830> seen<00:00:29.369> as<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:29.640> video<00:00:29.880> or<00:00:30.119> the

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
bit impractical seen as the video or the

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:31.820 
bit impractical seen as the video or the
gameplay<00:00:30.630> is<00:00:30.840> only<00:00:30.990> about<00:00:31.109> two<00:00:31.410> minutes<00:00:31.590> long

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
gameplay is only about two minutes long

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.650 
gameplay is only about two minutes long
so<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:32.850> people<00:00:33.059> who<00:00:33.149> were<00:00:33.210> playing<00:00:33.420> against

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
so the people who were playing against

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.630 
so the people who were playing against
as<00:00:33.809> you<00:00:33.840> can<00:00:34.050> see<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.350> bottom<00:00:34.710> and<00:00:34.860> their

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
as you can see the bottom and their

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.880 
as you can see the bottom and their
prestigious<00:00:36.239> are<00:00:37.079> quite<00:00:37.410> high<00:00:37.590> there's<00:00:37.860> a

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
prestigious are quite high there's a

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.190 
prestigious are quite high there's a
couple<00:00:38.070> of<00:00:38.190> force<00:00:38.430> there's<00:00:39.030> a<00:00:39.120> fifth<00:00:39.629> or<00:00:39.780> sixth

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200

relatively<00:00:44.879> high<00:00:45.030> prestige<00:00:45.270> is<00:00:45.510> that<00:00:45.660> I'm<00:00:45.719> not

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
relatively high prestige is that I'm not

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.540 
relatively high prestige is that I'm not
completely<00:00:46.200> sure<00:00:46.379> on<00:00:46.739> which<00:00:46.920> prestige<00:00:47.399> they

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
the scamper ready but I'm about to get

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.270 
the scamper ready but I'm about to get
the<00:02:00.270> MIB<00:02:00.479> it's<00:02:00.930> very<00:02:01.079> quick<00:02:01.439> I<00:02:01.649> would<00:02:02.189> have

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
the MIB it's very quick I would have

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.950 
the MIB it's very quick I would have
chosen<00:02:02.310> like<00:02:02.820> a<00:02:02.850> particular<00:02:03.390> topic<00:02:03.600> to<00:02:03.840> talk

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
chosen like a particular topic to talk

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.690 
chosen like a particular topic to talk
about<00:02:04.020> but<00:02:04.439> it<00:02:04.590> seems<00:02:04.860> that<00:02:04.979> soon<00:02:05.549> as<00:02:05.640> the

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
about but it seems that soon as the

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:06.980 
about but it seems that soon as the
video<00:02:05.909> or<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:06.210> game<00:02:06.450> players<00:02:06.659> let<00:02:06.780> me<00:02:06.840> turn

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
video or the game players let me turn

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.109 
video or the game players let me turn
this<00:02:07.170> long<00:02:07.350> it<00:02:07.530> seems<00:02:07.680> to<00:02:07.799> be<00:02:07.860> redundant<00:02:08.250> and

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
this long it seems to be redundant and

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.270 
this long it seems to be redundant and
these<00:02:09.780> people<00:02:10.110> they<00:02:10.379> dashboard<00:02:10.860> it<00:02:10.950> out<00:02:11.069> at

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
these people they dashboard it out at

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.130 
these people they dashboard it out at
the<00:02:11.310> end<00:02:11.400> they<00:02:11.760> also<00:02:11.940> do<00:02:12.090> care<00:02:12.299> about<00:02:12.330> their<00:02:12.750> KD

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
the end they also do care about their KD

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.720 
the end they also do care about their KD
I<00:02:13.230> was<00:02:13.379> little<00:02:13.590> bit<00:02:13.709> too<00:02:13.890> much<00:02:14.069> and<00:02:14.340> they<00:02:14.549> also

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
I was little bit too much and they also

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.580 
I was little bit too much and they also
need<00:02:15.090> some<00:02:15.330> abusive<00:02:15.750> messages<00:02:15.959> which<00:02:16.409> was

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590
