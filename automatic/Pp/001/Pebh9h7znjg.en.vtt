 that today I bring you a dessert 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.850
 delicious and it's very well easy to 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:38.370
 do so let's start 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:40.770
 [Music] 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.600
 ah 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:46.449
 mary cookies 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.760
 a half cup of lemon juice one can 

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:52.300
 of condensed milk a can of milk 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:54.460
 evaporated strawberries the ones you want and 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.680
 you are going to cut some can be in squares 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:59.109
 in slices I do not know how you want and you're going to 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.850
 leave another uncut to decorate 

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:02.350
 our dessert at the end to start 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.750
 we are going to put in the glass of the blender 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:07.810
 can of condensed milk can of 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:10.360
 evaporated milk and let's liquefy now 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.369
 let's put the half cup of juice 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.740
 lemon and they will see as immediately the 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:16.330
 mixture starts to get thicker and 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.700
 final you will have a consistency 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.740
 like this you have to mix our 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.319
 Weights simply puts a little more 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.240
 lemon juice and now let's ride the 

00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:27.700
 dessert for this we put a layer of 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.890
 cookies then they can like to cut 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.740
 little pieces like that in the parts 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:35.229
 where a full cookie does not fit then 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.240
 let's put the mixture just 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:39.460
 make a layer so with the help of 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.289
 the spatula you can spread the super cim 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.760
 well it depends if you want to do as 

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:45.400
 that the layer 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:47.650
 cream thicker and thin as the 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:50.320
 I did and now let's put some 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:53.680
 bits of strawberry then we put another 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.920
 cream biscuit layer strawberry pieces 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.530
 and so on 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.420
 At the end we will leave a layer of cream 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.939
 so help yourself with the spatula so that 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.920
 it is as smooth as possible and we will 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.750
 bring the dessert to the refrigerator 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.259
 on top of the frozen 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.880
 things for about two hours and 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.709
 after this time the dessert will be 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.050
 much now only wants to decorate 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:18.540
 for this I cut prey so well 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:20.700
 delgaditas and accommodate them in this way 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.370
 and in the center I put squares of strawberries 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.300
 and smaller and ready and only 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.419
 want to serve 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.419
 [Music] 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.600
 and how he told them that dessert is 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.220
 super easy to do if you want 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.710
 you can put less milk 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.720
 condensed that is no problem so 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:42.280
 I hope you are encouraged to do so if 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:44.290
 do you can share it with me in 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.790
