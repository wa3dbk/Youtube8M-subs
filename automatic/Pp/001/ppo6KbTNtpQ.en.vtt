00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:13.480
 hello welcome to my channel today what 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:15.430
 I bring is 5 cups bread so 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:20.190
 first thing you have to do is turn on 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:20.190
 your oven at 128 degrees 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:27.890
 We are going to use 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:30.820
 a house of wheat flour I use 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.820
 three stars 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.629
 this is a cup of wheat flour 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:53.040
 with the help of a strainer we are going to 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.040
 make them 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:02.950
 then we will use a cup of 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:06.990
 stops but can be of preference 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:06.990
 I'm going to use three stars 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.880
 and we are going to do a lot 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.860
 and then we're going to use two 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.450
 teaspoons 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:32.049
 of talking powders 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.049
 same 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.360
 we are not going to make them 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:47.800
 since we have this that are the 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:51.220
 dry ingredients after we're going to 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:53.170
 add the sugar we are going to sift the three 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:56.970
 times 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.970
 this so that our preparation 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.000
 and he is also a composer 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.590
 what we want is that the flour 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.590
 be final 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:19.020
 they keep coming out 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:47.210
 let's add the sugar cup 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:03.510
 good since we have the integrated sugar 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:12.490
 We are going to add 2 teaspoons 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.490
 from beni 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:27.410
 let's add three eggs 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:46.770
 after 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.770
 the milk cup 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.980
 you can not see if you're not staying 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:06.420
 and then the cup of oil 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:23.390
 I was wrong in the oven a while ago I left 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:23.390
 from 128 degrees to a 180 degrees 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:27.880
 we add the oil 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:39.990
 You can prepare this in your blender 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:42.870
 to throw it dry good 

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:44.550
 budding and afterwards in the blender 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:47.670
 made everything that is the liquid and 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:49.350
 up made the flour so you do not get 

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:52.090
 It costs work to grind it if it is not 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:55.930
 you have a blender 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:58.530
 let's beat until everything is very 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:58.530
 integrated 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:36.630
 good what you 're going to do now is in your 

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:39.630
 refractory where are you going to put your bread and 

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:43.170
 can be of those who are from 

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:45.960
 of aluminum or glass you are going to put 

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:49.520
 butter is going to throw flour this 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:49.520
 to prevent it from sticking in our bread 

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:54.050
 and what we are going to do is add it 

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:30.220
 you're going to put the mixture in turn for 30 

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:32.710
 minutes 

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:34.930
 you are going to introduce a knife if it comes out 

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:37.890
 clean is that your bread is ready 

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:41.670
 you turn off the oven and leave it a little longer 

00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:44.460
 about 10 minutes 

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:48.420
 and if your knife comes out dirty still you 

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:50.970
 missing but in if the title is left in 

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:53.720
 half an hour exactly good now we're going 

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:53.720
 to put it 

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:57.610
 well here I already know that bread takes 30 

00:06:56.919 --> 00:07:00.370
 minutes 

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:02.710
 here already with more to put the knife and 

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:05.890
 I saw that I was already 

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:07.930
 you have to let it cool so that 

00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:10.530
 you can unmold solito is going to start 

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:10.530
 to take off 

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:17.260
 good as you can see so we will 

00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:17.260
 stay our 5- cup plan 

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:26.920
