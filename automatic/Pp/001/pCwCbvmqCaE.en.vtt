hit in the dead center of the basket and

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.219 
hit in the dead center of the basket and
it<00:01:52.070> rolled<00:01:52.340> out<00:01:52.520> around<00:01:52.729> somehow<00:01:53.119> and<00:01:53.570> you

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 
it rolled out around somehow and you

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:56.230 
it rolled out around somehow and you
know<00:01:54.350> it<00:01:54.470> just<00:01:54.500> comes<00:01:54.770> down<00:01:54.940> you<00:01:55.940> know<00:01:56.060> it's

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:57.820 
know it just comes down you know it's
it's<00:01:56.450> really<00:01:56.720> nothing<00:01:57.020> that<00:01:57.170> you<00:01:57.560> could<00:01:57.710> ever

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:57.830 
it's really nothing that you could ever

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.070 
it's really nothing that you could ever
control<00:01:58.070> no<00:01:58.790> no<00:01:59.119> when<00:01:59.300> it<00:01:59.390> comes<00:01:59.570> down<00:01:59.660> to<00:01:59.930> it

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:00.080 
control no no when it comes down to it

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
it and I'll show those in slow-mo

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.490 
it and I'll show those in slow-mo
especially<00:02:08.030> the<00:02:08.149> second<00:02:08.539> pot<00:02:08.720> that<00:02:09.140> was<00:02:09.259> dead

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
especially the second pot that was dead

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.380 
especially the second pot that was dead
center<00:02:09.920> right<00:02:10.610> in<00:02:10.700> the<00:02:10.789> heart<00:02:10.910> of<00:02:11.030> the<00:02:11.090> chains

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
center right in the heart of the chains

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.449 
center right in the heart of the chains
how<00:02:12.050> it<00:02:12.260> popped<00:02:12.500> out<00:02:12.709> and<00:02:12.890> then<00:02:13.010> got<00:02:13.190> up<00:02:13.220> and

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
how it popped out and then got up and

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:15.360 
how it popped out and then got up and
rolled<00:02:13.640> all<00:02:13.790> the<00:02:13.819> way<00:02:13.940> out<00:02:14.030> of<00:02:14.209> bounds

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
rolled all the way out of bounds

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.440 
rolled all the way out of bounds
everybody<00:02:16.370> stepped<00:02:16.700> up<00:02:16.850> for<00:02:17.000> the<00:02:17.060> most<00:02:17.240> part

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
everybody stepped up for the most part

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.380 
everybody stepped up for the most part
got<00:02:17.990> hole<00:02:18.200> 17<00:02:18.560> and<00:02:18.920> then<00:02:19.010> on<00:02:19.190> 18<00:02:19.640> it<00:02:20.090> probably

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
got hole 17 and then on 18 it probably

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:21.580 
got hole 17 and then on 18 it probably
wasn't<00:02:20.540> quite<00:02:20.840> the<00:02:20.930> finish<00:02:21.170> you<00:02:21.260> guys<00:02:21.410> we're

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
looking for what are we looking for

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:24.730 
looking for what are we looking for
tomorrow<00:02:23.209> at<00:02:23.540> a<00:02:23.630> vista<00:02:23.810> AR<00:02:24.200> I'm<00:02:24.350> sorry<00:02:24.560> I<00:02:24.650> out

tomorrow at a vista AR I'm sorry I out

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.470 
tomorrow at a vista AR I'm sorry I out
ave<00:02:24.860> fountain<00:02:25.130> with<00:02:25.580> you<00:02:25.670> in<00:02:25.760> the<00:02:25.849> lead<00:02:26.000> we'll

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
ave fountain with you in the lead we'll

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.000 
ave fountain with you in the lead we'll
have<00:02:26.569> a<00:02:26.599> little<00:02:26.810> earlier<00:02:27.230> start<00:02:27.830> I<00:02:27.980> think

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
have a little earlier start I think

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.100 
have a little earlier start I think
because<00:02:28.310> we're<00:02:28.490> making<00:02:28.700> a<00:02:28.760> kind<00:02:29.030> so<00:02:29.450> hopefully

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
because we're making a kind so hopefully

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:31.510 
because we're making a kind so hopefully
it<00:02:30.290> was<00:02:30.380> not<00:02:30.560> as<00:02:30.650> many

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
it was not as many

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.190 
it was not as many
probably<00:02:31.970> a<00:02:32.000> three<00:02:32.300> group<00:02:32.570> back<00:02:32.780> up<00:02:32.990> on<00:02:33.140> the

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
probably a three group back up on the

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.110 
probably a three group back up on the
last<00:02:33.410> four<00:02:33.770> or<00:02:33.920> five<00:02:33.950> horas<00:02:34.460> on<00:02:34.730> every<00:02:35.000> single

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
last four or five horas on every single

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.810 
last four or five horas on every single
hole<00:02:35.390> so<00:02:35.720> it<00:02:35.960> was<00:02:36.950> a<00:02:36.980> really<00:02:37.130> long<00:02:37.400> round<00:02:37.700> I'm

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:37.820 
hole so it was a really long round I'm

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:39.430 
hole so it was a really long round I'm
hoping<00:02:38.120> that<00:02:38.270> tomorrow<00:02:38.420> won't<00:02:38.720> be<00:02:38.870> as<00:02:38.990> long<00:02:39.230> of

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
hoping that tomorrow won't be as long of

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.470 
hoping that tomorrow won't be as long of
around<00:02:39.740> so<00:02:40.100> you<00:02:40.400> know<00:02:40.760> that's<00:02:40.970> one<00:02:41.150> thing<00:02:41.330> to

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
around so you know that's one thing to

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.450 
around so you know that's one thing to
hopefully<00:02:41.750> look<00:02:42.080> forward<00:02:42.410> to<00:02:42.560> sure<00:02:42.950> sure

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:43.460 
hopefully look forward to sure sure

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:45.640 
hopefully look forward to sure sure
hopefully<00:02:43.700> no<00:02:43.970> wind<00:02:44.210> also<00:02:44.480> yeah<00:02:45.200> I<00:02:45.230> know<00:02:45.380> that

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
hopefully no wind also yeah I know that

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.470 
hopefully no wind also yeah I know that
they've<00:02:45.830> cut<00:02:46.100> fifty<00:02:46.760> percent<00:02:47.060> of<00:02:47.150> the<00:02:47.240> field

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
they've cut fifty percent of the field

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:48.850 
they've cut fifty percent of the field
so<00:02:48.020> as<00:02:48.140> you<00:02:48.260> said<00:02:48.410> they're<00:02:48.560> going<00:02:48.650> to<00:02:48.740> move

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
so as you said they're going to move

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.200 
so as you said they're going to move
things<00:02:49.010> up<00:02:49.220> a<00:02:49.280> little<00:02:49.400> earlier<00:02:49.760> and<00:02:50.000> these

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:50.210 
things up a little earlier and these

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:52.240 
things up a little earlier and these
last<00:02:50.450> few<00:02:50.600> holes<00:02:50.780> that<00:02:51.020> I've<00:02:51.140> shown<00:02:51.350> we're

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
last few holes that I've shown we're

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:53.560 
last few holes that I've shown we're
pretty<00:02:52.520> much<00:02:52.730> out<00:02:52.910> here<00:02:53.060> in<00:02:53.120> the<00:02:53.180> dark<00:02:53.300> I<00:02:53.450> mean

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
you guys could see but it definitely was

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.400 
you guys could see but it definitely was
a<00:02:55.040> little<00:02:55.310> dust<00:02:55.490> go<00:02:55.670> here<00:02:56.020> street<00:02:57.020> lights<00:02:57.170> came

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
a little dust go here street lights came

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.500 
a little dust go here street lights came
on<00:02:57.560> street<00:02:58.010> lights<00:02:58.190> came<00:02:58.430> on<00:02:58.610> so<00:02:59.000> you're<00:02:59.180> tied

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
on street lights came on so you're tied

on street lights came on so you're tied
with<00:02:59.540> Ricky<00:02:59.960> Wysocki<00:03:00.650> and<00:03:00.910> it<00:03:01.910> looks<00:03:02.090> like

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:02.210 
with Ricky Wysocki and it looks like

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:06.610
