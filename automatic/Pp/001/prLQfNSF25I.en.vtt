00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.530 
very stretchable because I have a big
hair<00:03:33.519> and<00:03:35.070> the<00:03:36.070> part<00:03:36.400> it<00:03:36.700> goes<00:03:36.880> up<00:03:37.120> the<00:03:37.239> part

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.110 
hair and the part it goes up the part
that<00:03:37.720> it<00:03:37.900> goes<00:03:38.019> a<00:03:38.350> little<00:03:38.769> bit<00:03:38.980> further<00:03:39.880> than

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
that it goes a little bit further than

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.949 
that it goes a little bit further than
regular<00:03:41.080> lace<00:03:41.350> front<00:03:41.739> wigs<00:03:41.950> too<00:03:42.220> so<00:03:43.120> that<00:03:43.570> is<00:03:43.750> a
