okay yeah so before I tell you guys
what's<00:00:28.880> going<00:00:29.150> on<00:00:29.270> I<00:00:29.570> am<00:00:30.079> a<00:00:30.110> hunter<00:00:30.469> that's<00:00:30.890> a

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:31.009 
what's going on I am a hunter that's a

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:33.340 
what's going on I am a hunter that's a
big<00:00:31.189> part<00:00:31.399> of<00:00:31.550> this<00:00:31.759> because<00:00:32.029> only<00:00:32.809> hunters

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:33.350 
big part of this because only hunters

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.459 
big part of this because only hunters
can<00:00:33.649> use<00:00:33.950> the<00:00:34.610> sapphire<00:00:35.149> wire<00:00:35.450> that<00:00:36.020> you<00:00:36.200> get

00:00:36.459 --> 00:00:36.469 
can use the sapphire wire that you get

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:39.160 
can use the sapphire wire that you get
when<00:00:36.649> you<00:00:36.800> sell<00:00:37.460> your<00:00:37.790> your<00:00:38.450> hunter<00:00:38.750> armor

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:39.170 
when you sell your your hunter armor

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.280 
when you sell your your hunter armor
because<00:00:39.940> what<00:00:40.940> the<00:00:41.090> sapphire<00:00:41.480> wire<00:00:41.660> does<00:00:41.989> is

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:42.290 
because what the sapphire wire does is

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:44.260 
because what the sapphire wire does is
you<00:00:42.680> can<00:00:42.860> actually<00:00:42.890> upgrade<00:00:43.760> your<00:00:43.910> armor
