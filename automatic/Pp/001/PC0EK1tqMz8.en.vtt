00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:08.580
 hi friends how are we good at this 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:14.250
 I bring them the jailbreak of the 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:17.880
 version 6.1 1.2 and 6.1 1.1 could be 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.770
 for iphone 4s and 6.1 point 2 for 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.359
 all other devices good 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.130
 we can see here that my iphone in that 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.250
 instantly it is in version 6.1 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.869
 point 2 and good without making longer this 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.939
 video then let's go once and start 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.099
 with what is the jailbreak of this 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:36.540
 version and we're going to occupy the program 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:39.810
 version 4.1 remember is compatible with 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:41.760
 windows with mac and with linux good for 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:44.100
 those who have windows must give 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.400
 right click and you have to execute it 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:51.110
 as a good administrator I also already 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:55.650
 I brought the jailbreak version 6.0 in 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:58.290
 6.0 6 points 0.1 to view for versions 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:01.140
 or good to break a tweeter for all 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:03.240
 the versions this jailbreak is identical 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.920
 but many people ask me yesterday break 

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:06.180
 they want to see the procedure and the only thing 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.550
 what we have to do is open the 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.480
 program and give it in jailbreak remember 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:15.160
 this jailbreak is 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:18.610
 with all the devices that support 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:20.850
 this the audio of 6 ok so good without 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:23.410
 take them more time boys 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.990
 I put the camera fast since I do not 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:27.940
 like you can make us lose time 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.620
 with so many things we can see that he has already 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:33.010
 started to restart in our 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:34.240
 device and well then I come back when 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:37.110
 I have finished all this procedure 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.110
 know boys 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.590
 good friends we can see on the screen 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:53.740
 from our computer of our amagÃ³ 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:56.170
 of our pc with linux that says that 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.369
 touch the icon that says gear break or 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.130
 that appears now in our 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:03.399
 screen here we give in ok and we get 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:06.640
 the new icon that I said yesterday break ok you 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:09.670
 we give and ready we leave to let 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:12.400
 work our as our iphone 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.989
 our ipad our ipod touch and good 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.780
 as we can see also here in the 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:19.329
 fun program tells us that this 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:25.000
 gear this jailbreak untethered and that 

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:25.900
 works from ios 6.0 to 6.0 to 6.1 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.660
 points 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:31.540
 ok guys that is compatible with 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:33.880
 each and every one of the servers there 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.750
 today I also wanted to make them 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:39.330
 mention that this one 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.980
 that in the description of the video and I'm going to 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.710
 try to leave it as response life 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.240
 I already have the video or a long time ago 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:47.580
 time I have the video of the best 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:50.460
 rest and explained many things too 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.459
 explained the repose that myths there are about 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:54.690
 the challenges for six and everything else 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:57.540
 I also have the jailbreak as they 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:03:00.840
 I say of version 6.0 when it came out in 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:03.230
 ebay are let's say version 1.0 today you 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:06.019
 we take until version 1.4 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:08.420
 and good guys, we do not have 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:10.489
 nothing more to do simply wait for 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.319
 to restart our device as 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:13.700
 he just did it and we can see that 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:16.940
 our program already says that the 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:18.680
 jailbreak the process has been completed 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:21.080
 has been completed and well simply 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.280
 we have to wait, he tells us he's 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:25.970
 analyzing 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:28.040
 we have to wait a few moments and 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:30.170
 Well, it seems to me that there where it says that 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.879
 where it says cleaning where else is it 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:34.879
 it takes but it is a matter of waiting 

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:36.860
 in the program of its version tells us 

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:39.110
 that you have to wait 5 minutes 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:42.140
 ok here we can see good here in the 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:43.970
 camera I get that we take 5 with 20 and 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:46.489
 continue with 26 but you are going to see 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:49.819
 much less since I put the camera fast 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:54.560
 but then without a fast camera we take 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:57.799
 at this moment 5 35 minutes and ready 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:01.340
 we have sidya working in our 

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:02.930
 device and good boys well hopefully 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.760

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.880
 for those who are advancing and for 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:12.920
 they need a jailbreak 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:14.930
 explained in version 6.1 point 2 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:17.329
 although also as I say you can see 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:19.790
 my video of version 6.0 that is 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:21.230
 exactly the same 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:22.730
