knee room now we want to lounge around
really<00:02:43.170> comfortably<00:02:43.709> that's<00:02:44.070> it<00:02:44.250> oh<00:02:44.340> there's

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
really comfortably that's it oh there's

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.160

pushed<00:02:44.880> all<00:02:45.030> the<00:02:45.090> way<00:02:45.330> forward<00:02:45.420> so<00:02:45.810> as<00:02:45.900> you<00:02:46.050> can

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
pushed all the way forward so as you can

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.650 
pushed all the way forward so as you can
see<00:02:46.230> there<00:02:46.830> is<00:02:46.950> a<00:02:46.980> lot<00:02:47.370> of<00:02:47.520> space<00:02:47.760> but<00:02:48.480> I

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
see there is a lot of space but I

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.120 
see there is a lot of space but I
wouldn't<00:02:49.050> advise<00:02:49.350> putting<00:02:49.530> more<00:02:49.860> than<00:02:49.980> two

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
wouldn't advise putting more than two

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:51.410 
wouldn't advise putting more than two
people<00:02:50.430> in<00:02:50.550> the<00:02:50.640> back<00:02:50.760> of<00:02:50.940> this<00:02:51.060> car<00:02:51.270> and

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
people in the back of this car and

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.600 
people in the back of this car and
there's<00:02:51.720> a<00:02:51.810> reason<00:02:52.080> for<00:02:52.110> that<00:02:52.260> first<00:02:53.010> up<00:02:53.250> you

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
there's a reason for that first up you

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.190 
there's a reason for that first up you
have<00:02:53.760> this<00:02:53.880> big<00:02:54.150> hump<00:02:54.420> over<00:02:54.690> here<00:02:54.870> so<00:02:55.020> there's

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
have this big hump over here so there's

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.380 
have this big hump over here so there's
no<00:02:55.260> space<00:02:55.590> for<00:02:55.890> your<00:02:56.010> feet<00:02:56.310> and<00:02:56.430> secondly<00:02:57.270> the

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
no space for your feet and secondly the

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:59.479 
no space for your feet and secondly the
car<00:02:57.570> has<00:02:57.750> rear<00:02:57.959> AC<00:02:58.140> vents<00:02:58.560> and<00:02:58.709> the<00:02:59.100> housing

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
car has rear AC vents and the housing

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:01.280 
car has rear AC vents and the housing
for<00:02:59.640> those<00:02:59.760> AC<00:02:59.940> vents<00:03:00.300> juts<00:03:00.570> out<00:03:00.750> a<00:03:00.780> little<00:03:01.019> bit

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
for those AC vents juts out a little bit

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.530 
for those AC vents juts out a little bit
so<00:03:01.470> there's<00:03:01.860> not<00:03:02.430> much<00:03:02.670> room<00:03:02.940> here<00:03:03.000> for<00:03:03.510> a

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
so there's not much room here for a

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.750 
so there's not much room here for a
