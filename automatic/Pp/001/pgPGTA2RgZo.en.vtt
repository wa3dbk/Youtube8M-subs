00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.140
 it's an amazing thing nothing stays 

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:48.330

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:50.070
 Arrocito so easy without a single drop 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.690
 of life and best of all is that when 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:54.030
 the rice is already well done when 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:57.120

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:59.730

00:05:10.529 --> 00:05:15.259
 it takes an hour in 20 minutes 

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:27.090
 and it's not easy but you have to call the 

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:28.860
 phones that are on screen 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:30.930
 true if you want to cook on the fly 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:34.500
 If you want to save gas if you want to save 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:37.110

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:39.360

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:41.310
 a trickle of water is not discarding 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:44.880

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:14.180
