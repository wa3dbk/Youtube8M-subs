00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
be a very good challenge for at least

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.730 
be a very good challenge for at least
four<00:01:12.570> different<00:01:12.780> skaters<00:01:13.320> how<00:01:13.470> you<00:01:13.530> think

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
four different skaters how you think

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.370 
four different skaters how you think
it'll<00:01:13.860> be<00:01:14.060> definitely<00:01:15.060> not<00:01:15.240> Nyjah<00:01:15.630> Huston<00:01:15.990> I

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
it'll be definitely not Nyjah Huston I

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.140 
it'll be definitely not Nyjah Huston I
mean<00:01:16.590> I'm<00:01:16.710> not<00:01:16.799> I'm<00:01:16.860> not<00:01:17.070> saying<00:01:17.820> that<00:01:17.909> Nyjah

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
mean I'm not I'm not saying that Nyjah

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.789 
mean I'm not I'm not saying that Nyjah
Huston<00:01:18.270> can't<00:01:18.810> win<00:01:19.049> but<00:01:19.350> I<00:01:19.380> mean<00:01:19.650> like

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
Huston can't win but I mean like

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.160 
Huston can't win but I mean like
obviously<00:01:20.700> he's<00:01:20.820> very<00:01:21.030> dominant<00:01:21.840> with<00:01:22.020> his

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
obviously he's very dominant with his

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:22.969 
obviously he's very dominant with his
rail

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
rail

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.530 
rail
you<00:01:23.400> know<00:01:23.520> his<00:01:23.640> rail<00:01:23.850> tricks<00:01:24.180> and<00:01:24.330> all<00:01:24.390> that

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
you know his rail tricks and all that

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:25.940 
you know his rail tricks and all that
