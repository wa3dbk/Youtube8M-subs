00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.450
 the newest pressures anyway well to close with a golden key to life 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:12.769
 of the psd leader 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:15.999
 nothing more fair since the laptop all with the best selling eyes of the 

00:00:15.999 --> 00:00:19.539
 biquinha franchise is one of the most profitable company 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:23.499
 however, the main highlight of these people is not the farewell tone but the 

00:00:23.499 --> 00:00:26.509
 evolution that they have received for a new generation 

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:29.919
 just do not expect to find anything revolutionary is the corner kick 

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:32.919
 in its best form 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.410
 if the truce proposal and ended off certainly objective was achieved 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:52.320
 starting with the amount of new pokÃ©mons are 156 new creatures to 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.520
 greater adhesion of the whole series 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.530
 This means that we have young people of all kinds since the presentation of 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.840
 animals as rather a fence to more abstract beings as a dream 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.780
 this variety can give new gas to the series 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.430
 if you thought the title repetitive try to capture all 649 pokemons 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.430
 in other words the game is practically infinite 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:17.560
 with so many options 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.590
 there are thousands of possible combinations when setting up your team 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:25.049
 not to mention the more than 90 attacks that increase the chances of 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.530
 strategy 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.020
 another point is the trio battles 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.710
 if up to the previous generation we can effect two of that same time changed 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.020
 now we can have six creatures together on the screen 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.750
 for this we have a differentiated system of combat prioritizes the tactic much more 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.990
 because the power to use 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.360
 the seasons are also one of the most significant actions 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.460
 these several monthly periods which makes the region a new 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.520
 I assume a different configuration as the year progresses 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.450
 in autumn the trees turn yellow while some areas are blocked 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:00.950
 during the winter 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.259
 for those who complained about the simplicity of the black and white versions and 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:06.890
 story a little deeper 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.390
 and complex than the views so far we have various elements of culture of 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:12.879
 leaving common place 

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:16.079
 and tried to kiss a less predictable plot 

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:19.849
 it is possible to perceive the preoccupation of those made by bringing a plot 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:23.849
 interesting in the presentation we are introduced to a background 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:28.629
 as it had never been done in the franchise the result is a willingness to move forward 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:31.629
 in search of answers about what is happening 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:35.889
 there is a considerable graphic improvement over previous games 

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:41.389
 the biggest change is in the camera position with a new screen perspective 

00:02:42.119 --> 00:02:46.019
 this allows a greater sense of depth in the scenario he makes clear 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:47.950
 that Nintendo wants to use a feature 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.049
 similar in 3ds 

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:54.229
 the effect can also be seen in battles which leaves everything more dynamic 

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:55.469
 it's less monotonous 

00:02:55.469 --> 00:02:59.419
 you can see improvements because we in the field and still accompany the camera 

00:02:59.419 --> 00:03:01.449
 agree with who is acting 

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:04.239
 but the big improvement is not inside the game 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:06.300
 in an attempt to combat piracy 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.510
 the company has maintained the sense of infrared present in the 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.160
 four goals and I'm silva 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.899
 and added a feature within the story to him 

00:03:13.899 --> 00:03:18.129
 It is now possible to use this system to battle another case that 

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:20.479
 friends advice in a more practical way 

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:23.699
 something that fake card users could not do 

00:03:33.419 --> 00:03:37.739
 On the other hand the 5th generation of low light practically ignores the improvements 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:41.789
 presented in the first two and takes a big step back in the matter 

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:43.429
 practicality 

00:03:43.429 --> 00:03:44.429
 example of this 

00:03:44.429 --> 00:03:47.919
 is the almost uselessness of the lower skin of the ps 

00:03:47.919 --> 00:03:51.969
 instead of using it to keep the menu simplified that done opted for 

00:03:51.969 --> 00:03:56.289
 connectivity system, even if it is a valid change, it is not as 

00:03:56.289 --> 00:03:59.379
 how to access your backpack organize your team 

00:04:00.169 --> 00:04:02.819
 the same can be said of the correct function 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:07.369
 if before it was enough to activate it, nothing is careless now you have to hold the button b is 

00:04:07.369 --> 00:04:10.119
 to make your ax character 

00:04:10.119 --> 00:04:13.079
 if before it was more practical it could complicate 

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:17.859
 another point she did not collectively with any other accessory that accompanied 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:22.349
 the versions made this the silver peripheral was a great success and 

00:04:22.349 --> 00:04:26.099
 allowed to expand the gaming experience out of the consoli 

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:29.559
 but it seems that nintendo did not bother to take the technology forward 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:35.590
 although betty white com decided to innovate in the way the series are still talking 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:36.520
 from anyone 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.850
 if you've never been interested in the capture and training system 

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:42.779
 do not expect something different in these versions 

00:04:42.779 --> 00:04:43.880
 What do we have here 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:47.569
 it's a different way of looking at what we've seen other times 

00:04:56.099 --> 00:04:59.729
 if you're an old fan of pocket monster dolls 

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:04.520
 what has changed is that the aek has a great game and that manages to innovate the old way 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:09.150
 although it maintains the same structure of always it is possible to realize that 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:12.150
 there was a concern have to bring new elements 

00:05:12.849 --> 00:05:17.330
 the new vehicles and the intense combat system are just a few of the 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:21.610
 new features that will make players realize their strategies before 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:24.279
 enter into championships 

00:05:24.279 --> 00:05:28.789
 it was said that it was possible to create the most varied combinations now that 

00:05:28.789 --> 00:05:31.789
 number p is an infinite 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:46.550
 if you had doubt about the evolution of the series 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:48.969
 know that everything is fine now 

00:05:48.969 --> 00:05:53.929
 the two new versions innovating several aspects but without escaping from what they do 

00:05:53.929 --> 00:05:54.520
 cold front 

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:56.879
 one of the golden girls of nintendo 

00:05:56.879 --> 00:06:00.629
 this means that anyone who has never been interested in the series of 

00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:02.060
 shelf but also 

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:04.540
 is the opportunity that many users have 

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:05.990
 to dive for good 

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:09.260
 in one of the best editions of the most famous creatures 

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:10.310
 and dear ones from 10
