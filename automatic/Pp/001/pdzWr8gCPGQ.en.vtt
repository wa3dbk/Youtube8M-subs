this video is a quick and a introduction

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.970 
this video is a quick and a introduction
to<00:00:18.300> two<00:00:18.690> new<00:00:18.900> techniques<00:00:19.380> that<00:00:19.500> i've<00:00:19.710> thought

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
to two new techniques that i've thought

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.550 
to two new techniques that i've thought
of<00:00:20.039> these<00:00:20.939> new<00:00:21.180> techniques<00:00:21.539> came<00:00:21.900> to<00:00:22.080> me<00:00:22.199> after

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
of these new techniques came to me after

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.290 
of these new techniques came to me after
having<00:00:22.680> some<00:00:23.039> Skype<00:00:23.340> sessions<00:00:23.850> with<00:00:24.090> some

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
having some Skype sessions with some

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.810 
having some Skype sessions with some
lovely<00:00:24.539> stripped<00:00:25.019> survivors<00:00:25.820> the

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
lovely stripped survivors the

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.609 
lovely stripped survivors the
instructions<00:00:27.570> that<00:00:27.660> I<00:00:27.779> usually<00:00:28.170> send<00:00:28.380> the

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
instructions that I usually send the

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.439 
instructions that I usually send the
hair<00:00:28.769> ties<00:00:28.980> for<00:00:29.369> weren't<00:00:29.550> quite<00:00:29.760> working<00:00:30.060> for

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
hair ties for weren't quite working for

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.659 
hair ties for weren't quite working for
them<00:00:30.660> so<00:00:31.260> I've<00:00:31.380> had<00:00:31.529> to<00:00:31.560> think<00:00:31.890> and<00:00:32.160> I've<00:00:32.460> come

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
them so I've had to think and I've come

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.180 
them so I've had to think and I've come
up<00:00:32.790> with<00:00:32.820> two<00:00:33.239> new<00:00:33.420> ideas<00:00:33.930> that<00:00:34.140> may<00:00:34.649> help<00:00:34.920> them

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
up with two new ideas that may help them

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.600 
up with two new ideas that may help them
and<00:00:35.460> others<00:00:36.329> to<00:00:37.050> simulate<00:00:37.320> stroke<00:00:38.309> paralysis

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
and others to simulate stroke paralysis

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.690 
and others to simulate stroke paralysis
I'm<00:00:39.360> wearing<00:00:39.750> my<00:00:39.960> trusty<00:00:40.440> old<00:00:40.469> man<00:00:40.980> hand<00:00:41.370> the

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
I'm wearing my trusty old man hand the

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.010 
I'm wearing my trusty old man hand the
videos<00:00:42.000> just<00:00:42.030> will<00:00:42.390> look<00:00:42.690> quite<00:00:42.989> right

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
videos just will look quite right

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.729 
videos just will look quite right
without<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:44.360> handle<00:00:45.360> so<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.289> first<00:00:46.500> method

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
without the handle so the first method

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.310 
without the handle so the first method
we're<00:00:47.070> doing<00:00:47.280> is<00:00:47.610> reverse<00:00:48.539> on<00:00:48.840> my<00:00:49.050> current

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
we're doing is reverse on my current

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.799 
we're doing is reverse on my current
instructions<00:00:50.039> we're<00:00:50.700> going<00:00:51.030> to<00:00:51.120> use<00:00:51.239> a<00:00:51.270> good

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
instructions we're going to use a good

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.560 
instructions we're going to use a good
hand<00:00:52.079> to<00:00:52.350> pull<00:00:52.920> and<00:00:53.250> create<00:00:53.550> tension<00:00:54.030> and

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
hand to pull and create tension and

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.080 
hand to pull and create tension and
we're<00:00:54.690> going<00:00:54.840> to<00:00:54.930> use<00:00:55.079> a<00:00:55.320> weakened<00:00:55.949> to<00:00:56.640> hold

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
we're going to use a weakened to hold

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.970 
we're going to use a weakened to hold
the<00:00:57.239> total<00:00:57.570> in<00:00:57.690> place<00:00:57.960> for<00:00:58.289> where<00:00:58.469> we<00:00:58.620> want<00:00:58.829> up

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
the total in place for where we want up

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.459

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
nice tight wrap and the very end if you

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.150 
nice tight wrap and the very end if you
have<00:02:00.119> the<00:02:00.390> ability<00:02:00.720> you<00:02:00.930> just<00:02:01.500> tuck<00:02:01.680> that<00:02:01.710> into

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:02.160 
have the ability you just tuck that into

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.969 
have the ability you just tuck that into
a<00:02:02.190> previous<00:02:02.670> loop<00:02:02.880> if<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.600> usual<00:02:04.350> pull<00:02:04.710> and

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
a previous loop if the usual pull and

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.300 
a previous loop if the usual pull and
tighten<00:02:05.670> isn't<00:02:06.390> working<00:02:06.690> for<00:02:06.720> you<00:02:07.160> so<00:02:08.160> the

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
tighten isn't working for you so the

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.080 
tighten isn't working for you so the
second<00:02:08.700> method<00:02:08.729> I'm<00:02:09.119> going<00:02:09.330> to<00:02:09.450> do<00:02:09.570> is<00:02:11.090> for

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
second method I'm going to do is for

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.820 
second method I'm going to do is for
those<00:02:12.240> of<00:02:12.480> you<00:02:12.630> that<00:02:12.840> may<00:02:13.200> not<00:02:13.230> be<00:02:13.380> able<00:02:13.590> to<00:02:13.680> get

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
those of you that may not be able to get

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.680 
those of you that may not be able to get
your<00:02:14.010> hand<00:02:14.190> all<00:02:14.790> the<00:02:14.970> way<00:02:15.000> up<00:02:15.209> to<00:02:15.390> the<00:02:15.480> top

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
your hand all the way up to the top

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.740 
your hand all the way up to the top
we're<00:02:16.500> actually<00:02:16.620> going<00:02:16.890> to<00:02:16.980> use<00:02:17.300> the<00:02:18.300> weaker

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
we're actually going to use the weaker

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.250 
we're actually going to use the weaker
arm<00:02:18.959> as<00:02:19.230> an<00:02:19.500> anchor<00:02:20.120> so<00:02:21.120> what<00:02:21.300> I<00:02:21.330> did<00:02:21.450> was<00:02:21.930> with

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
arm as an anchor so what I did was with

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.410 
arm as an anchor so what I did was with
the<00:02:22.950> air<00:02:23.100> tight<00:02:23.340> that<00:02:23.489> everybody<00:02:23.940> gets<00:02:24.180> in<00:02:24.330> the

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
the air tight that everybody gets in the

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.810 
the air tight that everybody gets in the
mail<00:02:24.630> I've<00:02:25.470> created<00:02:25.860> a<00:02:26.250> loop<00:02:27.180> on<00:02:28.190> one<00:02:29.190> end<00:02:29.400> and

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
mail I've created a loop on one end and

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.880 
mail I've created a loop on one end and
that<00:02:30.600> will<00:02:30.780> actually<00:02:30.959> go<00:02:31.260> over<00:02:31.290> the<00:02:31.620> week

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
that will actually go over the week

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:37.460 
that will actually go over the week
around<00:02:34.940> so<00:02:35.940> we'll<00:02:36.060> start<00:02:36.600> by<00:02:36.720> setting<00:02:37.170> it<00:02:37.350> up

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
around so we'll start by setting it up

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.729 
around so we'll start by setting it up
the<00:02:38.160> same<00:02:38.400> way<00:02:38.580> as<00:02:38.700> all<00:02:38.880> the<00:02:38.970> others<00:02:39.650> over<00:02:40.650> the

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
the same way as all the others over the

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:45.770 
the same way as all the others over the
head<00:02:41.360> under<00:02:42.360> the<00:02:42.480> hair<00:02:43.340> over<00:02:44.340> the<00:02:44.370> ears<00:02:44.780> then

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
head under the hair over the ears then

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.809 
head under the hair over the ears then
pull<00:02:46.140> tight

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:52.910 

now<00:02:51.390> I'm<00:02:51.569> pulling<00:02:51.810> the<00:02:52.080> end<00:02:52.260> this<00:02:52.560> what's<00:02:52.830> a

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
now I'm pulling the end this what's a

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.710 
now I'm pulling the end this what's a
loop<00:02:53.099> on<00:02:53.280> it<00:02:53.310> because<00:02:54.000> now<00:02:54.209> I've<00:02:54.390> got<00:02:54.420> some

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
loop on it because now I've got some

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.420 
loop on it because now I've got some
length<00:02:55.099> we<00:02:56.099> can<00:02:56.280> feed<00:02:56.519> that<00:02:56.720> over<00:02:57.720> our<00:02:57.840> hand

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
length we can feed that over our hand

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.630 
length we can feed that over our hand
and<00:02:59.430> that<00:02:59.760> becomes<00:03:00.090> the<00:03:00.569> anchor<00:03:01.400> now<00:03:02.400> then

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
and that becomes the anchor now then

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.860 
and that becomes the anchor now then
take<00:03:02.879> this<00:03:03.060> shorter<00:03:03.510> end<00:03:03.689> and<00:03:04.590> start<00:03:04.890> pulling

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
take this shorter end and start pulling

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.720 
take this shorter end and start pulling
with<00:03:06.870> the<00:03:06.900> previous<00:03:07.470> version<00:03:07.920> we<00:03:08.280> just<00:03:08.489> won't

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
with the previous version we just won't

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.630 
with the previous version we just won't
have<00:03:09.030> that<00:03:09.650> anchor<00:03:10.650> point<00:03:10.680> for<00:03:10.950> the<00:03:11.129> ponytail

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
have that anchor point for the ponytail

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:19.479 
have that anchor point for the ponytail
so<00:03:11.879> you<00:03:12.569> could<00:03:12.720> have<00:03:12.810> fun<00:03:13.230> fast<00:03:14.540> like<00:03:15.540> that

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:19.489 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:21.050 

there<00:03:20.489> you<00:03:20.609> go

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
there you go

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.160 
there you go
use<00:03:21.959> a<00:03:21.989> ponytail<00:03:22.409> I<00:03:23.450> said<00:03:24.450> I<00:03:24.659> haven't<00:03:24.930> had<00:03:25.019> much

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
use a ponytail I said I haven't had much

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.289 
use a ponytail I said I haven't had much
practice<00:03:25.440> these<00:03:25.950> additional<00:03:26.459> ideas<00:03:26.670> and<00:03:27.269> I

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299 
practice these additional ideas and I

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:52.500 
practice these additional ideas and I
hope<00:03:27.599> they<00:03:27.780> work<00:03:27.989> for<00:03:28.260> you<00:03:28.379> thank<00:03:29.310> you<00:03:29.519> I
