ages<00:01:20.369> because<00:01:20.729> they're<00:01:21.119> all<00:01:21.330> regions<00:01:21.810> at<00:01:22.020> this

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
ages because they're all regions at this

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.560 
ages because they're all regions at this
stage<00:01:22.350> obviously<00:01:22.860> so<00:01:23.369> it's<00:01:23.729> had<00:01:23.880> to<00:01:24.090> I<00:01:24.360> don't

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
stage obviously so it's had to I don't

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:25.999 
stage obviously so it's had to I don't
know<00:01:24.689> it's<00:01:25.049> hard<00:01:25.229> to<00:01:25.320> know<00:01:25.530> which<00:01:25.710> one<00:01:25.890> is

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
know it's hard to know which one is

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.070 
know it's hard to know which one is
which<00:01:26.130> I<00:01:26.280> guess<00:01:26.460> but<00:01:26.970> as<00:01:27.180> you<00:01:27.360> see<00:01:27.509> Cara<00:01:27.869> Bonnie

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
which I guess but as you see Cara Bonnie

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.840 
which I guess but as you see Cara Bonnie
I<00:01:28.200> had<00:01:28.439> this<00:01:28.560> shot<00:01:28.770> in<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:28.979> 32nd<00:01:29.520> minute<00:01:29.610> which

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
I had this shot in the 32nd minute which

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.399 
I had this shot in the 32nd minute which
almost<00:01:30.000> went<00:01:30.360> in<00:01:30.479> but<00:01:30.659> thankfully<00:01:31.079> it<00:01:31.170> didn't

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
almost went in but thankfully it didn't

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:32.899 
almost went in but thankfully it didn't

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
can see this five minutes of it in this

game we're Jose Villarreal coming

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.550 
game we're Jose Villarreal coming
forward<00:01:36.509> and<00:01:36.570> forcing<00:01:36.990> a<00:01:37.049> safe<00:01:37.290> from<00:01:37.439> the

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
forward and forcing a safe from the

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.560 
forward and forcing a safe from the
goalkeeper<00:01:38.040> and<00:01:38.159> into<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.060> second<00:01:39.329> half<00:01:39.360> we

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
goalkeeper and into the second half we

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.660 
goalkeeper and into the second half we
come<00:01:39.780> and<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.530> preview<00:01:40.979> floats<00:01:41.310> in<00:01:41.460> a<00:01:41.520> free

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.249 
come and the preview floats in a free
kick<00:01:41.880> towards<00:01:42.090> qurbani<00:01:42.509> I<00:01:42.720> think<00:01:43.020> it<00:01:43.110> comes

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
kick towards qurbani I think it comes

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:44.569 
kick towards qurbani I think it comes
out<00:01:43.350> to<00:01:43.470> a<00:01:43.500> Lebec<00:01:43.860> on<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.130> edge<00:01:44.250> of<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.430> area

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
out to a Lebec on the edge of the area

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.370 
out to a Lebec on the edge of the area
as<00:01:45.000> a<00:01:45.030> pretty<00:01:45.329> decent<00:01:45.689> strike<00:01:45.840> but<00:01:46.140> it<00:01:46.229> just

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
as a pretty decent strike but it just

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.840 
as a pretty decent strike but it just
goes<00:01:46.560> wide<00:01:46.860> and<00:01:47.070> that<00:01:47.159> was<00:01:47.280> kind<00:01:47.430> of<00:01:47.549> all<00:01:47.640> that

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
goes wide and that was kind of all that

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.850 
goes wide and that was kind of all that
happened<00:01:48.149> in<00:01:48.240> that<00:01:48.270> game<00:01:48.420> I've<00:01:49.259> said<00:01:49.590> it<00:01:49.710> many

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
happened in that game I've said it many

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.740 
happened in that game I've said it many
times<00:01:50.250> throughout<00:01:50.610> this<00:01:50.880> series<00:01:51.180> but<00:01:51.600> it

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
times throughout this series but it

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.870 
times throughout this series but it
seems<00:01:52.049> as<00:01:52.350> though<00:01:52.380> whenever<00:01:53.250> I<00:01:53.490> play<00:01:53.670> in<00:01:53.729> the

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
seems as though whenever I play in the

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.789 
seems as though whenever I play in the
rain<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.479> games<00:01:54.720> just<00:01:54.869> are<00:01:55.320> a<00:01:55.380> little<00:01:55.619> bit

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
rain the games just are a little bit

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.289 
rain the games just are a little bit
more<00:01:55.920> boring<00:01:56.219> and<00:01:56.490> I'm<00:01:56.549> not<00:01:56.700> too<00:01:56.880> sure<00:01:57.090> why

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
more boring and I'm not too sure why

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:58.730 
more boring and I'm not too sure why
that<00:01:57.329> is<00:01:57.659> I<00:01:57.810> don't<00:01:57.869> know<00:01:58.020> why<00:01:58.200> that<00:01:58.229> happens

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
that is I don't know why that happens

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.319 
that is I don't know why that happens
but<00:01:59.009> it's<00:01:59.250> a<00:01:59.430> thing<00:01:59.610> that<00:01:59.640> happens<00:02:00.060> and<00:02:00.210> that's

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
but it's a thing that happens and that's

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.899 
but it's a thing that happens and that's
just<00:02:00.570> that<00:02:00.810> an<00:02:01.049> ex<00:02:01.439> game<00:02:01.680> is<00:02:01.920> away<00:02:02.189> from<00:02:02.670> home

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.210 
other

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:13.700 
other
good<00:02:12.330> team<00:02:12.510> they've<00:02:12.660> got<00:02:12.810> ruin<00:02:13.140> his<00:02:13.260> Acula

he could have been a player that i

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.930 
he could have been a player that i

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
fortunate that the ball bounced off the

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:22.460 
fortunate that the ball bounced off the
goalkeeper<00:03:21.240> on<00:03:21.390> its<00:03:21.540> route<00:03:21.780> back<00:03:21.960> into<00:03:22.380> the

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
goalkeeper on its route back into the

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.290 
goalkeeper on its route back into the
box<00:03:22.680> and<00:03:22.890> that's<00:03:23.370> what<00:03:23.520> enabled<00:03:23.940> him<00:03:24.030> to<00:03:24.090> get

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:24.300 
box and that's what enabled him to get

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.120 
box and that's what enabled him to get
the<00:03:24.420> shot<00:03:24.630> off<00:03:24.660> so<00:03:24.930> that's<00:03:25.050> pretty<00:03:25.320> lucky<00:03:25.680> but

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
the shot off so that's pretty lucky but

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:27.800 
the shot off so that's pretty lucky but
in<00:03:26.250> the<00:03:26.340> 50<00:03:26.580> 50<00:03:26.820> minutes<00:03:27.030> asteroids<00:03:27.570> comes

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
in the 50 50 minutes asteroids comes

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.660 
in the 50 50 minutes asteroids comes
forward<00:03:28.080> he<00:03:28.260> does<00:03:28.440> the<00:03:28.590> add<00:03:28.830> the<00:03:29.010> scoop<00:03:29.430> turn<00:03:29.640> I

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
forward he does the add the scoop turn I

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.280 
forward he does the add the scoop turn I
think<00:03:29.820> it's<00:03:30.060> called<00:03:30.210> to<00:03:30.660> get<00:03:30.810> into<00:03:31.020> the<00:03:31.110> box

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
think it's called to get into the box

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:32.750 
think it's called to get into the box
and<00:03:31.470> he<00:03:31.530> has<00:03:31.620> a<00:03:31.650> really<00:03:31.860> good<00:03:32.040> finish<00:03:32.370> out<00:03:32.580> but

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
and he has a really good finish out but

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.160 
and he has a really good finish out but
it's<00:03:32.880> tipped<00:03:33.090> over<00:03:33.240> by<00:03:33.420> the<00:03:33.600> goalkeeper<00:03:34.140> and

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
it's tipped over by the goalkeeper and

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:35.540 
it's tipped over by the goalkeeper and
it<00:03:34.320> comes<00:03:34.470> out<00:03:34.620> for<00:03:34.770> a<00:03:34.860> corner<00:03:35.040> kick<00:03:35.190> which

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:35.550 
it comes out for a corner kick which

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.370 
it comes out for a corner kick which
sastre<00:03:35.970> royce<00:03:36.180> will<00:03:36.360> come<00:03:36.570> across<00:03:36.660> himself<00:03:37.230> to

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.480 
in towards kondogbia who goes up but

it's headed out towards my CL who hasn't

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:46.220 
it's headed out towards my CL who hasn't

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 
really been on the scoresheet a lot as

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.320 
really been on the scoresheet a lot as
of<00:03:46.410> late<00:03:46.560> I'm<00:03:46.770> and<00:03:47.460> this<00:03:47.670> shot<00:03:47.880> he<00:03:48.060> was<00:03:48.090> on

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:48.330 
of late I'm and this shot he was on

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:49.700 
of late I'm and this shot he was on
looking<00:03:48.630> not<00:03:48.750> to<00:03:48.900> score<00:03:49.140> i<00:03:49.170> guess<00:03:49.410> it<00:03:49.560> was<00:03:49.590> a

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:49.710 
looking not to score i guess it was a

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:51.650 
looking not to score i guess it was a
really<00:03:49.890> good<00:03:50.130> effort<00:03:50.460> but<00:03:50.700> i<00:03:50.970> guess<00:03:51.450> it<00:03:51.630> was

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
really good effort but i guess it was

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.210 
really good effort but i guess it was
reasonably<00:03:52.530> comfortable<00:03:52.800> for<00:03:53.160> the

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
reasonably comfortable for the

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:54.410 
reasonably comfortable for the

the<00:04:05.370> ball<00:04:05.520> away<00:04:05.640> more<00:04:06.030> than<00:04:06.060> catch<00:04:06.390> it<00:04:06.630> and

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
the ball away more than catch it and

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.510 
the ball away more than catch it and
obviously<00:04:07.200> the<00:04:07.590> ball<00:04:07.740> just<00:04:07.950> bounced<00:04:08.400> off<00:04:08.490> his

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:08.520 
obviously the ball just bounced off his

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:10.580 
obviously the ball just bounced off his
gloves<00:04:08.970> because<00:04:09.180> it<00:04:09.480> was<00:04:09.630> it<00:04:10.110> was<00:04:10.290> slippery

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590

and<00:04:10.770> there<00:04:10.830> was<00:04:10.980> no<00:04:11.100> way<00:04:11.250> he<00:04:11.280> could<00:04:11.460> have<00:04:11.610> held

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:11.820 
and there was no way he could have held

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:13.400 
and there was no way he could have held
on<00:04:11.970> to<00:04:12.000> it<00:04:12.180> so<00:04:12.390> that's<00:04:12.540> why<00:04:12.690> we<00:04:12.810> went<00:04:12.990> to<00:04:13.110> nil<00:04:13.290> up

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410

shame<00:05:09.580> that<00:05:09.610> we're<00:05:09.940> not<00:05:10.090> playing<00:05:10.330> in<00:05:10.449> a

00:05:10.499 --> 00:05:10.509 
shame that we're not playing in a

00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:12.180 
shame that we're not playing in a
glamorous<00:05:11.020> tournament<00:05:11.470> like<00:05:11.620> the<00:05:11.740> Champions

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:14.169 
League and for that reason this is a

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:16.680

all the teams beginning would be and the

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.689 
all the teams beginning would be and the
reason<00:05:19.509> that<00:05:19.750> I<00:05:19.930> played<00:05:20.440> such<00:05:20.800> a<00:05:20.830> well<00:05:21.310> I<00:05:21.340> guess

00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:23.199 
it's not really that weak a team i guess

this shows our strength and depth in the
team<00:05:24.849> this<00:05:25.030> year<00:05:25.180> but<00:05:25.389> our<00:05:25.479> team<00:05:25.659> is<00:05:25.780> entirely
