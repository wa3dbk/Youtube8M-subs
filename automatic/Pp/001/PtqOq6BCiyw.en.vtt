00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
Pokemon advanced action flips now they

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.480 
Pokemon advanced action flips now they
did<00:00:12.330> have<00:00:12.540> a<00:00:12.780> series<00:00:13.290> one<00:00:13.530> which<00:00:13.710> opened<00:00:14.160> a<00:00:14.250> few

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
did have a series one which opened a few

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.150 
did have a series one which opened a few
of<00:00:14.750> back<00:00:15.750> when<00:00:15.929> Pokemon<00:00:16.410> first<00:00:16.650> came<00:00:16.890> around

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
of back when Pokemon first came around

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.040 
of back when Pokemon first came around
basically<00:00:18.029> it's<00:00:18.150> just<00:00:18.300> these<00:00:18.420> little<00:00:18.600> cards

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
basically it's just these little cards

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.570 
basically it's just these little cards
that<00:00:19.199> you<00:00:19.320> can<00:00:19.470> see<00:00:19.680> on<00:00:19.710> the<00:00:19.980> booster<00:00:20.400> pack

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
that you can see on the booster pack

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.080 
that you can see on the booster pack
here<00:00:20.990> it's<00:00:21.990> kind<00:00:22.830> of<00:00:22.920> like<00:00:23.130> then<00:00:23.880> how<00:00:24.060> to

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
here it's kind of like then how to

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.759 
here it's kind of like then how to
explain<00:00:24.570> it<00:00:24.630> really<00:00:24.840> like<00:00:25.050> you<00:00:25.230> you<00:00:25.260> change

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
explain it really like you you change

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.830

the<00:00:26.160> angle<00:00:26.670> of<00:00:26.730> it<00:00:26.939> and<00:00:27.150> it<00:00:27.240> will<00:00:27.300> change<00:00:27.599> the

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
the angle of it and it will change the

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.050 
the angle of it and it will change the
picture<00:00:28.050> of<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:28.769> pokemon<00:00:29.580> that's<00:00:29.699> on<00:00:29.880> the

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
card kind of thing so you get three of

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.370 
card kind of thing so you get three of
them<00:00:32.369> per<00:00:32.669> pack<00:00:33.000> and<00:00:33.329> I<00:00:33.450> have<00:00:33.630> four<00:00:33.960> packs<00:00:34.200> to

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
them per pack and I have four packs to

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.549 
them per pack and I have four packs to
open<00:00:34.770> these<00:00:35.340> are<00:00:35.610> from<00:00:35.850> when<00:00:36.570> like<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.230> Hoenn

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
open these are from when like the Hoenn

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.080 
open these are from when like the Hoenn
region<00:00:37.920> came<00:00:38.160> around<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.670> third<00:00:38.940> generation

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
region came around the third generation

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:45.470 
region came around the third generation
of<00:00:39.600> Pokemon<00:00:39.750> and<00:00:40.200> let's<00:00:41.040> get<00:00:41.309> this<00:00:41.370> open<00:00:44.480> I'm

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
of Pokemon and let's get this open I'm

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.600 
of Pokemon and let's get this open I'm
not<00:00:45.660> hundred<00:00:46.230> percent<00:00:46.500> sure<00:00:46.559> like<00:00:47.100> if<00:00:47.370> there's

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
not hundred percent sure like if there's

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.430 
not hundred percent sure like if there's
anything<00:00:47.850> that's<00:00:48.120> rare<00:00:48.510> in<00:00:48.539> them<00:00:48.989> or<00:00:49.260> anything

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
anything that's rare in them or anything

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.220 
anything that's rare in them or anything
I<00:00:49.739> don't<00:00:49.950> think<00:00:50.280> there<00:00:50.520> is<00:00:50.550> I<00:00:50.969> think<00:00:51.960> it's<00:00:52.140> just

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
I don't think there is I think it's just

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.529 
I don't think there is I think it's just
whatever<00:00:53.129> you<00:00:53.340> get<00:00:53.610> you<00:00:53.760> get<00:00:53.940> so<00:00:54.270> let's<00:00:54.420> have<00:00:54.510> a

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
whatever you get you get so let's have a

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.010 
whatever you get you get so let's have a
look<00:00:54.719> so<00:00:55.530> we<00:00:55.649> have<00:00:55.860> the<00:00:56.449> evolution<00:00:57.449> chain<00:00:57.780> of

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
look so we have the evolution chain of

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.000 
look so we have the evolution chain of
Whismur<00:00:58.829> Loudred<00:00:59.460> and<00:00:59.640> Exploud<00:01:00.710> see<00:01:01.710> if<00:01:01.800> i<00:01:01.890> can

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
Whismur Loudred and Exploud see if i can

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.670 
Whismur Loudred and Exploud see if i can
get<00:01:02.129> better<00:01:02.719> image<00:01:03.719> of<00:01:03.899> that<00:01:03.930> there<00:01:04.260> we<00:01:04.350> go<00:01:04.500> so

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
get better image of that there we go so

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.380 
get better image of that there we go so
as<00:01:04.739> you<00:01:04.860> can<00:01:04.979> see<00:01:05.129> as<00:01:05.220> you<00:01:05.250> as<00:01:05.549> you<00:01:05.610> move<00:01:05.790> it<00:01:06.240> it

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
as you can see as you as you move it it

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.039 
as you can see as you as you move it it
will<00:01:06.479> change<00:01:08.030> which<00:01:09.030> point<00:01:09.330> one<00:01:09.540> is<00:01:09.750> showing

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
will change which point one is showing

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.539 
will change which point one is showing
see<00:01:10.350> what<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.590> evolution<00:01:11.040> chain<00:01:11.310> there

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
see what the evolution chain there

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.840 
see what the evolution chain there
Whismur<00:01:11.909> Loudred<00:01:12.299> and<00:01:12.510> explode<00:01:13.490> and<00:01:14.490> then<00:01:14.700> we

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
beautifly these ones have larger than

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.940 
beautifly these ones have larger than
the<00:01:29.189> ones<00:01:29.369> that<00:01:29.850> first<00:01:30.150> came<00:01:30.479> around<00:01:30.829> or<00:01:31.829> we

actually<00:03:41.669> I'm<00:03:42.180> guessing<00:03:42.780> that<00:03:42.810> this<00:03:42.959> is<00:03:43.139> a

00:03:43.369 --> 00:03:43.379 
actually I'm guessing that this is a

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:45.740 
actually I'm guessing that this is a
rare<00:03:44.340> one<00:03:44.549> oh<00:03:44.699> it<00:03:44.970> actually<00:03:45.120> says<00:03:45.510> they're

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
rare one oh it actually says they're

like our one or something in gold so I'm

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:52.670 
like our one or something in gold so I'm
guessing<00:03:49.409> that<00:03:49.650> means<00:03:49.889> it's<00:03:50.129> a<00:03:50.220> rare<00:03:51.680> there's

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
guessing that means it's a rare there's

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.059 
guessing that means it's a rare there's
a<00:03:52.769> 3d<00:03:53.280> was<00:03:53.790> it<00:03:53.940> yeah<00:03:54.599> our<00:03:54.989> one<00:03:55.439> up<00:03:55.590> here<00:03:55.769> so<00:03:56.010> I'm

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
guessing that's a rare that's 3d thing

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.530 
guessing that's a rare that's 3d thing
we're<00:04:00.389> thinned<00:04:00.720> it's<00:04:01.819> 3d<00:04:02.819> worse<00:04:02.970> the<00:04:03.209> others

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
we're thinned it's 3d worse the others
