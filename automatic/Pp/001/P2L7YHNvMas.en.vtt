scoop some treads right here and the

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:00.780 
scoop some treads right here and the
articulation<00:03:59.709> of<00:03:59.800> this<00:03:59.890> figure<00:04:00.220> is<00:04:00.280> just<00:04:00.400> as

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
articulation of this figure is just as

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:02.190 
articulation of this figure is just as
weak<00:04:01.000> as<00:04:01.150> it<00:04:01.180> is<00:04:01.390> on<00:04:01.540> the<00:04:01.630> other<00:04:01.750> one<00:04:01.959> so<00:04:01.989> his

outwards they move forward as an elbow

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.210 
outwards they move forward as an elbow
that<00:04:07.300> bends<00:04:07.570> 90<00:04:07.870> degrees<00:04:08.200> it<00:04:08.500> can<00:04:08.709> rotate<00:04:08.950> at

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220 
that bends 90 degrees it can rotate at

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.610 
that bends 90 degrees it can rotate at
the<00:04:09.250> elbow<00:04:09.340> as<00:04:09.730> well<00:04:10.000> no<00:04:10.480> torso<00:04:10.989> articulation

the elbow as well no torso articulation
his<00:04:11.739> legs<00:04:11.980> move<00:04:12.130> outward<00:04:12.489> they<00:04:12.970> move<00:04:13.180> forward

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:13.450 
his legs move outward they move forward

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:14.970 
his legs move outward they move forward
you<00:04:13.780> can't<00:04:13.989> rotate<00:04:14.110> right<00:04:14.380> here<00:04:14.560> at<00:04:14.680> the<00:04:14.800> upper

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980 
you can't rotate right here at the upper

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:16.710 
you can't rotate right here at the upper
thigh<00:04:15.190> he<00:04:15.670> has<00:04:15.700> a<00:04:15.790> single<00:04:16.030> jointed<00:04:16.359> knee<00:04:16.510> and

thigh he has a single jointed knee and

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:17.970 
thigh he has a single jointed knee and
it<00:04:16.840> rotates<00:04:16.989> at<00:04:17.260> the<00:04:17.290> knee<00:04:17.440> so<00:04:17.680> this<00:04:17.830> figure

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:17.980 
it rotates at the knee so this figure

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:19.890 
it rotates at the knee so this figure
stands<00:04:18.370> just<00:04:18.519> at<00:04:18.730> about<00:04:18.850> 4<00:04:19.209> inches<00:04:19.330> tall<00:04:19.690> so

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
stands just at about 4 inches tall so

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:21.509 
stands just at about 4 inches tall so

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
Universe figure and you can see how this

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:27.420 
Universe figure and you can see how this
is<00:04:25.810> based<00:04:26.229> off<00:04:26.440> of<00:04:26.500> this<00:04:26.770> figure<00:04:27.160> over<00:04:27.400> here

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:27.430 
is based off of this figure over here

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:29.550 
is based off of this figure over here
this<00:04:27.790> design<00:04:28.270> that<00:04:28.510> we<00:04:28.600> saw<00:04:28.810> in<00:04:28.960> the<00:04:29.080> comics

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
this design that we saw in the comics

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:30.990 
this design that we saw in the comics
which<00:04:30.010> is<00:04:30.100> pretty<00:04:30.340> neat<00:04:30.550> that<00:04:30.700> they're<00:04:30.820> doing

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
which is pretty neat that they're doing

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.040 
which is pretty neat that they're doing
that<00:04:31.180> in<00:04:31.300> the<00:04:31.360> movie<00:04:31.600> I<00:04:31.630> think<00:04:31.810> it's<00:04:31.930> pretty

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.050 
that in the movie I think it's pretty

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:34.560 
that in the movie I think it's pretty
cool<00:04:32.320> but<00:04:32.500> this<00:04:32.740> is<00:04:33.040> a<00:04:33.070> cool<00:04:33.460> figure<00:04:33.850> much<00:04:34.240> much

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:34.570 
cool but this is a cool figure much much

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:36.030 
cool but this is a cool figure much much
taller<00:04:34.900> than<00:04:35.050> this<00:04:35.290> guy<00:04:35.500> and<00:04:35.740> here<00:04:35.919> is

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:36.040 
taller than this guy and here is

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.440 
taller than this guy and here is
compared<00:04:36.430> to<00:04:36.520> the<00:04:36.640> new<00:04:36.790> Marvel<00:04:37.030> Universe

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:37.450 
compared to the new Marvel Universe

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:39.240 
compared to the new Marvel Universe
Captain<00:04:37.840> America<00:04:38.229> figure<00:04:38.560> and<00:04:38.830> here's<00:04:39.070> all

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.250 
Captain America figure and here's all

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:40.860 
Captain America figure and here's all
four<00:04:39.460> figures<00:04:39.760> on<00:04:39.940> the<00:04:40.030> wave<00:04:40.240> I<00:04:40.540> think<00:04:40.750> it's

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:40.870 
four figures on the wave I think it's

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:42.810 
four figures on the wave I think it's
very<00:04:41.080> funny<00:04:41.440> how<00:04:41.770> these<00:04:41.950> Captain<00:04:42.430> America's

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:42.820 
very funny how these Captain America's

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:44.580 
very funny how these Captain America's
are<00:04:42.940> not<00:04:43.090> the<00:04:43.240> same<00:04:43.419> height<00:04:43.690> we<00:04:44.320> have<00:04:44.350> our

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590 
are not the same height we have our

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:45.990 
are not the same height we have our
suction<00:04:44.919> cup<00:04:45.100> Captain<00:04:45.430> America<00:04:45.729> which<00:04:45.850> is<00:04:45.970> a

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.000 
suction cup Captain America which is a

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.120 
suction cup Captain America which is a
lot<00:04:46.240> smaller<00:04:46.750> and<00:04:47.050> at<00:04:47.620> least<00:04:47.830> a<00:04:47.919> Winter

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:48.130 
lot smaller and at least a Winter

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:49.440 
lot smaller and at least a Winter
Soldier<00:04:48.340> figure<00:04:48.669> from<00:04:48.760> this<00:04:48.970> wave<00:04:49.120> came<00:04:49.300> out

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:49.450 
Soldier figure from this wave came out

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:50.530 
Soldier figure from this wave came out
pretty<00:04:49.690> cool<00:04:49.960> looking

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:50.540 
pretty cool looking

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:51.940 
pretty cool looking
to<00:04:50.600> give<00:04:50.720> him<00:04:50.810> that<00:04:51.020> overall<00:04:51.500> I<00:04:51.560> have<00:04:51.680> to<00:04:51.800> say

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:51.950 
to give him that overall I have to say

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:53.890 
to give him that overall I have to say
as<00:04:52.070> an<00:04:52.190> adult<00:04:52.460> collector<00:04:52.970> I<00:04:53.240> don't<00:04:53.660> really

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:53.900 
as an adult collector I don't really

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.200 
as an adult collector I don't really
find<00:04:54.230> this<00:04:54.590> wave<00:04:54.920> of<00:04:54.950> figures<00:04:55.550> to<00:04:55.580> be<00:04:55.850> very

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:56.210 
find this wave of figures to be very

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:57.850 
find this wave of figures to be very
cool<00:04:56.600> I<00:04:56.930> didn't<00:04:57.170> really<00:04:57.320> like<00:04:57.410> to<00:04:57.560> throw<00:04:57.740> the

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:57.860

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:59.890 
cool I didn't really like to throw the
dark<00:04:58.100> world<00:04:58.370> figures<00:04:59.030> either<00:04:59.360> but<00:04:59.750> at<00:04:59.810> least

00:04:59.890 --> 00:04:59.900 
dark world figures either but at least

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:01.660 
dark world figures either but at least
