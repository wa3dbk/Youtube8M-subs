a saw it fits right inside that that
that<00:00:48.149> steel<00:00:48.480> bar<00:00:48.719> and<00:00:49.140> that's<00:00:49.800> what<00:00:50.010> makes<00:00:50.160> you

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
that steel bar and that's what makes you

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.979 
that steel bar and that's what makes you
cut<00:00:50.430> a<00:00:50.460> straight<00:00:50.730> line<00:00:50.940> so<00:00:51.539> I'm<00:00:51.660> going<00:00:51.780> to<00:00:51.809> show

follow that chalk line there you can see
what<00:01:43.350> I'm<00:01:43.439> talking<00:01:43.470> about<00:01:43.829> right<00:01:43.979> there

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
what I'm talking about right there

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.630 
what I'm talking about right there
there's<00:01:44.399> a<00:01:44.490> saw<00:01:44.880> and<00:01:45.240> there's<00:01:45.780> a<00:01:45.840> chalk<00:01:46.140> line

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
there's a saw and there's a chalk line

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.100 
there's a saw and there's a chalk line
that<00:01:47.640> chalk<00:01:47.939> line<00:01:48.149> right<00:01:48.299> there<00:01:48.479> is<00:01:48.689> where<00:01:48.899> the

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
that chalk line right there is where the

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.289 
that chalk line right there is where the
saw<00:01:49.350> is<00:01:49.500> going<00:01:49.590> to<00:01:49.710> cut<00:01:49.979> and<00:01:50.189> it<00:01:50.850> can't<00:01:51.060> fall

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
saw is going to cut and it can't fall

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.600 
saw is going to cut and it can't fall
out<00:01:51.329> because<00:01:52.079> it's<00:01:52.439> inside<00:01:52.829> that<00:01:53.040> channel<00:01:53.430> see

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
out because it's inside that channel see

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.149 
out because it's inside that channel see
what<00:01:53.729> I<00:01:53.790> mean<00:01:54.079> it's<00:01:55.079> inside<00:01:55.439> that<00:01:55.590> channel<00:01:56.009> so

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
what I mean it's inside that channel so

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.359 
what I mean it's inside that channel so
it<00:01:56.640> can<00:01:56.759> only<00:01:56.939> go<00:01:57.390> straight<00:01:57.810> and<00:01:58.200> that<00:01:58.920> saw<00:01:59.130> has

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
it can only go straight and that saw has

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.760 
it can only go straight and that saw has
a<00:01:59.399> blade<00:01:59.790> that<00:01:59.969> can<00:02:00.090> cut<00:02:00.360> concrete<00:02:00.930> so<00:02:01.500> now<00:02:01.649> I'm

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
a blade that can cut concrete so now I'm

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.560 
a blade that can cut concrete so now I'm
going<00:02:01.950> to<00:02:02.009> show<00:02:02.219> you<00:02:02.280> how<00:02:02.670> to<00:02:02.729> cut<00:02:03.299> this
