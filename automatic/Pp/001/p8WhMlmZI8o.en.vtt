00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
generally recommend is a polyurethane

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.080 
generally recommend is a polyurethane
caulking<00:00:58.020> now<00:00:58.620> we<00:00:59.309> don't<00:00:59.430> want<00:00:59.640> to<00:00:59.730> get<00:00:59.850> water

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.840 
and back of here and the caulking just
hides<00:01:03.090> this<00:01:03.329> unsightly<00:01:04.019> look<00:01:04.439> anyway<00:01:04.860> so<00:01:05.549> what
