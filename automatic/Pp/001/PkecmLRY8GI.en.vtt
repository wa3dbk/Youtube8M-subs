oily<00:01:01.320> skin<00:01:01.559> then<00:01:02.430> it<00:01:02.520> would<00:01:02.640> be<00:01:02.760> really<00:01:02.940> good

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
I'm really kind of bad at matching

foundations<00:01:24.689> to<00:01:24.960> my<00:01:25.080> skin<00:01:25.530> so<00:01:25.830> I<00:01:25.860> feel<00:01:26.189> like

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
foundations to my skin so I feel like

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.310 
foundations to my skin so I feel like
this<00:01:26.520> might<00:01:26.549> be<00:01:26.909> a<00:01:26.939> tad<00:01:27.299> bit<00:01:27.600> too<00:01:27.810> dark<00:01:28.020> for<00:01:28.140> me

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
this might be a tad bit too dark for me

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.710 
this might be a tad bit too dark for me
because<00:01:29.100> as<00:01:29.369> you<00:01:29.490> can<00:01:29.520> see<00:01:29.880> i'm<00:01:30.299> extremely

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
because as you can see i'm extremely

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.719 
because as you can see i'm extremely
pale<00:01:31.170> during<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.590> winter<00:01:31.829> which<00:01:32.040> stinks<00:01:32.549> and

pale during the winter which stinks and

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.249

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.600 
realized that I lost like all my colors
since<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:46.079> summer<00:01:46.290> and<00:01:46.649> then<00:01:46.860> it's<00:01:47.100> too<00:01:47.369> dark

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
since the summer and then it's too dark

since the summer and then it's too dark
for<00:01:47.700> me<00:01:47.880> so<00:01:48.270> this<00:01:48.750> might<00:01:48.930> be<00:01:49.079> a<00:01:49.110> little<00:01:49.649> bit<00:01:50.070> too

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
for me so this might be a little bit too

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.760 
for me so this might be a little bit too
dark<00:01:50.490> so<00:01:50.610> i'll<00:01:50.850> probably<00:01:51.200> go<00:01:52.200> out<00:01:52.229> and<00:01:52.409> like

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
dark so i'll probably go out and like

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.039 
dark so i'll probably go out and like
get<00:01:53.040> a<00:01:53.220> lighter<00:01:53.490> shade<00:01:53.579> maybe<00:01:54.119> but<00:01:54.720> anyway<00:01:55.020> i

days<00:02:53.630> ago<00:02:53.810> I<00:02:53.959> think<00:02:54.350> for<00:02:54.500> the<00:02:54.590> first<00:02:54.620> time<00:02:55.040> and

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
days ago I think for the first time and

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.420 
days ago I think for the first time and
I<00:02:55.489> decided<00:02:55.880> to<00:02:56.150> use<00:02:56.420> it<00:02:56.630> um<00:02:57.170> like<00:02:57.680> in<00:02:57.920> the

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
I decided to use it um like in the

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.520 
I decided to use it um like in the
morning<00:02:58.580> and<00:02:59.150> then<00:02:59.330> see<00:02:59.780> how<00:02:59.810> it<00:03:00.170> kind<00:03:00.350> of

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
morning and then see how it kind of

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.800 
morning and then see how it kind of
lasted<00:03:01.370> throughout<00:03:01.640> the<00:03:01.820> day<00:03:02.000> so<00:03:02.209> I<00:03:02.390> put<00:03:02.630> it<00:03:02.720> on

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
lasted throughout the day so I put it on

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.500 
lasted throughout the day so I put it on
it<00:03:03.080> was<00:03:03.320> pretty<00:03:03.950> full<00:03:04.400> coverage<00:03:04.880> I<00:03:05.150> would<00:03:05.300> say

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
it was pretty full coverage I would say

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.320 
it was pretty full coverage I would say
more<00:03:05.750> medium<00:03:06.230> coverage<00:03:06.980> but<00:03:07.700> I<00:03:07.760> don't<00:03:08.090> have<00:03:08.270> a

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330 
more medium coverage but I don't have a

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:10.540 
more medium coverage but I don't have a
whole<00:03:08.690> like<00:03:08.959> I<00:03:09.140> don't<00:03:09.200> have<00:03:09.350> acne<00:03:09.830> or<00:03:10.220> anything

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:10.550 
whole like I don't have acne or anything

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:12.910 
whole like I don't have acne or anything
so<00:03:10.790> I<00:03:11.000> don't<00:03:11.209> have<00:03:11.480> a<00:03:11.540> whole<00:03:11.840> lot<00:03:11.870> to<00:03:12.350> go<00:03:12.530> off<00:03:12.709> of

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 
so I don't have a whole lot to go off of

really well so if you maybe have some of
those<00:03:23.570> types<00:03:23.900> of<00:03:24.110> issues<00:03:24.320> or<00:03:25.010> whatever<00:03:25.459> then

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
this really does a good job as far as

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:30.699 
this really does a good job as far as
covering<00:03:28.400> all<00:03:28.549> of<00:03:28.580> that<00:03:28.970> so<00:03:29.840> for<00:03:30.110> me<00:03:30.260> it<00:03:30.470> did

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:30.709 
covering all of that so for me it did

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:33.550 
covering all of that so for me it did
like<00:03:30.950> it<00:03:31.190> made<00:03:31.640> my<00:03:31.790> skin<00:03:31.850> super<00:03:32.570> flawless<00:03:33.290> and

like it made my skin super flawless and

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.770 
like it made my skin super flawless and
it<00:03:33.680> covered<00:03:34.220> like<00:03:34.489> any<00:03:34.700> type<00:03:34.970> of<00:03:35.000> redness<00:03:35.540> or

it covered like any type of redness or

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.650 
it covered like any type of redness or
imperfection<00:03:36.500> and<00:03:37.280> it<00:03:37.610> made<00:03:37.790> my<00:03:37.970> skin<00:03:38.030> look

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:38.660 
imperfection and it made my skin look

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:40.600 
imperfection and it made my skin look
Matt<00:03:39.019> but<00:03:39.320> it<00:03:39.410> wasn't<00:03:39.739> too<00:03:40.010> Matt<00:03:40.250> where<00:03:40.519> it

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:40.610 
Matt but it wasn't too Matt where it

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:42.400 
Matt but it wasn't too Matt where it
looked<00:03:40.790> kind<00:03:41.060> of<00:03:41.150> like<00:03:41.209> weird<00:03:42.019> because<00:03:42.290> I

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
looked kind of like weird because I

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:45.009 
looked kind of like weird because I
still<00:03:42.950> do<00:03:43.220> like<00:03:43.250> a<00:03:43.790> little<00:03:44.180> bit<00:03:44.420> of<00:03:44.450> that<00:03:44.570> dewy

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:45.019 
still do like a little bit of that dewy

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:47.380 
still do like a little bit of that dewy
complexion<00:03:45.590> I<00:03:46.280> think<00:03:46.760> it<00:03:46.880> just<00:03:46.910> makes<00:03:47.180> you

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:47.390 
complexion I think it just makes you

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:50.259 
complexion I think it just makes you
look<00:03:47.570> more<00:03:47.630> awake<00:03:48.110> and<00:03:48.350> stuff<00:03:48.799> so<00:03:49.160> it<00:03:49.549> has<00:03:50.000> kind

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:50.269 
look more awake and stuff so it has kind

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:51.820 
look more awake and stuff so it has kind
of<00:03:50.360> like<00:03:50.510> the<00:03:50.600> perfect<00:03:50.630> combination<00:03:51.200> of<00:03:51.560> Matt

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:51.830 
of like the perfect combination of Matt

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:54.850 
of like the perfect combination of Matt
and<00:03:52.100> not<00:03:52.850> mad<00:03:53.299> it<00:03:54.110> also<00:03:54.230> claims<00:03:54.560> to<00:03:54.739> be

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:54.860 
and not mad it also claims to be

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:57.340 
and not mad it also claims to be
poreless<00:03:55.549> but<00:03:56.180> I<00:03:56.239> wouldn't<00:03:56.600> necessarily<00:03:56.720> say

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:57.350 
poreless but I wouldn't necessarily say

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:59.710 
poreless but I wouldn't necessarily say
that<00:03:57.980> like<00:03:58.459> obviously<00:03:58.820> nothing's<00:03:59.239> going<00:03:59.690> to

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
that like obviously nothing's going to

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.289 
that like obviously nothing's going to
be<00:03:59.959> perfect<00:04:00.230> and<00:04:00.650> this<00:04:01.130> is<00:04:01.310> no<00:04:01.459> exception<00:04:01.489> so

00:04:02.289 --> 00:04:02.299 
be perfect and this is no exception so

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:04.660 
be perfect and this is no exception so
it<00:04:02.570> doesn't<00:04:03.049> completely<00:04:03.709> make<00:04:04.190> your<00:04:04.370> pores

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:04.670

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:42.240 
sponge or anything because I don't have
one<00:04:38.740> so<00:04:39.280> I<00:04:39.310> don't<00:04:39.550> know<00:04:39.880> how<00:04:39.910> that<00:04:40.540> works<00:04:41.050> but<00:04:41.950> I

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:42.250 
one so I don't know how that works but I

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:43.650 
one so I don't know how that works but I
used<00:04:42.730> it<00:04:42.880> with<00:04:42.970> the<00:04:43.060> brush<00:04:43.240> and<00:04:43.450> it<00:04:43.510> worked

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:43.660 
used it with the brush and it worked

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:45.120 
used it with the brush and it worked
really<00:04:43.870> well<00:04:43.990> I<00:04:44.350> used<00:04:44.590> to<00:04:44.650> apply<00:04:44.920> foundation

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:45.130 
really well I used to apply foundation

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:46.770 
really well I used to apply foundation
with<00:04:45.580> my<00:04:45.700> fingers<00:04:46.150> but<00:04:46.390> I<00:04:46.420> don't<00:04:46.630> do<00:04:46.750> that

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:46.780 
with my fingers but I don't do that

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:49.230 
with my fingers but I don't do that
anymore<00:04:47.160> but<00:04:48.160> using<00:04:48.430> a<00:04:48.490> brush<00:04:48.670> works<00:04:49.000> really

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240 
anymore but using a brush works really

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:50.790 
anymore but using a brush works really
well<00:04:49.330> so<00:04:49.900> like<00:04:50.020> I<00:04:50.140> said<00:04:50.200> they've<00:04:50.470> only<00:04:50.620> been

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:48.010 
glass bottle but you just have to be

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:50.070 
glass bottle but you just have to be
careful<00:05:48.190> because<00:05:48.490> if<00:05:48.820> you<00:05:49.060> drop<00:05:49.270> it<00:05:49.450> obviously

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:51.640 
there's more of a chance at a little

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:54.120 
there's more of a chance at a little
break<00:05:51.850> and<00:05:52.060> you'll<00:05:52.510> lose<00:05:52.720> everything<00:05:53.560> I

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:54.130 
break and you'll lose everything I

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:55.770 
break and you'll lose everything I
really<00:05:54.580> like<00:05:54.760> the<00:05:54.910> finish<00:05:55.270> when<00:05:55.420> you<00:05:55.540> put<00:05:55.720> it

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:01.540 
of like that dewy look it does a really

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:03.540 
of like that dewy look it does a really
good<00:06:01.810> job<00:06:01.870> at<00:06:02.260> hiding<00:06:02.680> your<00:06:02.710> pores<00:06:03.070> like<00:06:03.430> I

good job at hiding your pores like I
said<00:06:03.760> it<00:06:03.910> doesn't<00:06:03.940> completely<00:06:04.600> make<00:06:04.840> them

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:04.870 
said it doesn't completely make them

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:07.320 
said it doesn't completely make them
disappear<00:06:05.170> but<00:06:06.010> nothing<00:06:06.370> is<00:06:06.700> like<00:06:07.000> a<00:06:07.060> miracle

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:07.330 
disappear but nothing is like a miracle

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:09.900 
disappear but nothing is like a miracle
worker<00:06:07.600> so<00:06:08.140> we<00:06:08.440> can't<00:06:08.650> really<00:06:08.710> expect<00:06:09.160> it<00:06:09.400> to

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:09.910 
worker so we can't really expect it to

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:11.640 
worker so we can't really expect it to
completely<00:06:10.510> make<00:06:10.810> your<00:06:10.990> skin<00:06:11.200> look<00:06:11.380> perfect

completely make your skin look perfect
the<00:06:12.520> applicator<00:06:13.030> is<00:06:13.150> a<00:06:13.300> poor<00:06:13.630> out<00:06:13.780> one<00:06:14.050> so<00:06:14.560> I

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:14.860 
the applicator is a poor out one so I

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:16.530 
the applicator is a poor out one so I
personally<00:06:15.550> like<00:06:15.730> the<00:06:15.880> pump<00:06:16.060> applicator

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:16.540 
personally like the pump applicator

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:18.660 
personally like the pump applicator
better<00:06:16.840> so<00:06:17.140> that<00:06:17.170> would<00:06:17.440> be<00:06:17.560> something<00:06:17.770> that<00:06:18.160> I

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:18.670 
better so that would be something that I

00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:20.400 
better so that would be something that I
would<00:06:18.880> change<00:06:19.120> about<00:06:19.480> it<00:06:19.810> but<00:06:19.990> like<00:06:20.230> I<00:06:20.350> said

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:20.410 
would change about it but like I said

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:22.530 
would change about it but like I said
before<00:06:20.680> it's<00:06:21.010> not<00:06:21.070> a<00:06:21.190> deal<00:06:21.430> breaker<00:06:21.490> and<00:06:22.120> yeah

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:22.540 
before it's not a deal breaker and yeah
