00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:06.080
 this story begins on the outskirts of 

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:10.240
 a town where Steve was finishing 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.240
 to build your own house 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:30.960
 and it has been that I thought it was listening 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:30.960
 something 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:40.410
 and if it is or that they want from there 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.870
 I thought I saw someone 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:49.670
 maybe it's that I'm very tired I do not know 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:51.670
 I'd better go back there I lay a 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:54.750
 I do not know how long 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.750
 it must be the dream 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:02.750
 but what 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.750
 has my house built 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.490
 what 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:16.149
 enter house 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:18.950
 of that nothing we are going to see this case is 

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:22.409
 building I belong to me 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:25.240
 I have an idea we can do one thing 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:28.170
 we can build the house between the two 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.170
 how about 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:37.520
 it seems that at least this is a grazed 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.520
 taking 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.820
 and so together they finished building the 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:49.470
 house where they can share the why not 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:51.619
 of steve and ender friends yes I think that 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.619
 yes
