golf ball if they want to be more

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.660 
golf ball if they want to be more
efficient<00:00:37.739> they're<00:00:37.920> actually<00:00:38.250> in<00:00:38.489> an

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
efficient they're actually in an

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.880 
efficient they're actually in an
efficient<00:00:39.329> manner<00:00:39.540> by<00:00:40.170> having<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.649> hands

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
efficient manner by having the hands

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.860 
efficient manner by having the hands
back<00:00:41.309> by<00:00:41.640> having<00:00:41.790> their<00:00:42.059> hips<00:00:42.300> not<00:00:42.510> turned

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
back by having their hips not turned

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.470 
back by having their hips not turned
enough<00:00:43.260> maybe<00:00:43.500> or<00:00:44.030> you<00:00:45.030> know<00:00:45.149> so<00:00:45.329> they<00:00:45.450> don't

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
enough maybe or you know so they don't

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.029 
enough maybe or you know so they don't
get<00:00:45.780> that<00:00:45.930> rotation<00:00:46.469> there<00:00:46.620> they<00:00:46.739> sort<00:00:46.920> of<00:00:46.980> in

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
get that rotation there they sort of in

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.260 
get that rotation there they sort of in
this<00:00:47.129> position<00:00:47.460> here<00:00:47.610> they're<00:00:47.760> on<00:00:47.850> their<00:00:48.000> toes

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
this position here they're on their toes

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.209 
this position here they're on their toes
so<00:00:49.110> what<00:00:49.289> we're<00:00:49.410> going<00:00:49.500> to<00:00:49.559> do<00:00:49.829> is<00:00:50.070> actually

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
so what we're going to do is actually

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.209 
so what we're going to do is actually
get<00:00:50.489> you<00:00:50.610> to<00:00:50.640> feel<00:00:51.059> what<00:00:51.329> it's<00:00:51.510> like<00:00:52.219> by

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
get you to feel what it's like by

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.910 
get you to feel what it's like by
presetting<00:00:53.910> your<00:00:54.180> impact<00:00:54.660> and<00:00:54.960> then<00:00:55.530> swinging

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
presetting your impact and then swinging

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.260 
presetting your impact and then swinging
back<00:00:56.039> and<00:00:56.219> then<00:00:56.309> returning<00:00:56.699> back<00:00:57.000> to<00:00:57.120> that

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
back and then returning back to that

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.450 
back and then returning back to that
position<00:00:57.840> so<00:00:58.609> I'll<00:00:59.609> take<00:00:59.730> my<00:00:59.789> normal<00:01:00.210> set<00:01:00.390> up

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:01.460 
position so I'll take my normal set up

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.929 
position so I'll take my normal set up
okay<00:01:02.460> where's<00:01:02.670> 7-iron<00:01:03.149> here<00:01:04.549> so<00:01:05.549> from<00:01:05.760> there

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
okay where's 7-iron here so from there
