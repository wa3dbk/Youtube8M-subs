sander<00:00:16.199> to<00:00:16.890> TNT<00:00:17.220> to<00:00:18.000> Pistons<00:00:18.480> doesn't<00:00:18.779> have<00:00:18.869> to

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
sander to TNT to Pistons doesn't have to

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.570 
sander to TNT to Pistons doesn't have to
be<00:00:19.080> sticky<00:00:19.439> pistons<00:00:19.859> but<00:00:20.160> it's<00:00:20.310> a<00:00:20.340> little<00:00:20.490> bit

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
be sticky pistons but it's a little bit

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.880 
be sticky pistons but it's a little bit
easier<00:00:20.939> 10<00:00:21.930> redstone<00:00:22.380> and<00:00:23.269> one<00:00:24.269> leaver<00:00:25.140> or

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
easier 10 redstone and one leaver or

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.859 
easier 10 redstone and one leaver or
lever<00:00:26.160> however<00:00:26.789> you<00:00:27.000> want<00:00:27.180> to<00:00:27.269> pronounce<00:00:27.449> it

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
lever however you want to pronounce it

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.860 
lever however you want to pronounce it
so<00:00:28.550> has<00:00:29.550> to<00:00:29.730> be<00:00:29.990> 2<00:00:30.990> now<00:00:31.140> for<00:00:31.669> white<00:00:32.669> or<00:00:33.450> I<00:00:33.660> guess

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
so has to be 2 now for white or I guess

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.770 
so has to be 2 now for white or I guess
for<00:00:34.140> long<00:00:36.829> like<00:00:37.829> that<00:00:38.040> and<00:00:38.879> you<00:00:39.270> also<00:00:39.420> want<00:00:39.690> to

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
for long like that and you also want to

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.930 
for long like that and you also want to
have<00:00:39.840> a<00:00:40.440> block<00:00:41.129> space<00:00:41.969> there<00:00:42.469> after<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:43.559> 4<00:00:43.940> so

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
have a block space there after the 4 so

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.330 
have a block space there after the 4 so
what<00:00:45.059> you're<00:00:45.180> gonna<00:00:45.300> do<00:00:45.390> now<00:00:45.570> is<00:00:45.899> you're<00:00:46.829> going

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
what you're gonna do now is you're going

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.139 
what you're gonna do now is you're going
to<00:00:47.610> going<00:00:47.789> that<00:00:48.030> and<00:00:48.719> then<00:00:49.079> like<00:00:49.200> that<00:00:49.379> and

00:00:50.139 --> 00:00:50.149 
to going that and then like that and

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:52.029 
to going that and then like that and
like<00:00:51.149> that

00:00:52.029 --> 00:00:52.039 
like that

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:56.450 
like that
so<00:00:53.780> dig<00:00:54.780> out<00:00:54.870> there<00:00:55.079> so<00:00:55.890> what<00:00:56.039> you're<00:00:56.160> gonna<00:00:56.219> do

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
so dig out there so what you're gonna do

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:03.380 
so dig out there so what you're gonna do
now<00:00:56.809> is<00:00:57.809> put<00:00:58.770> wire<00:00:58.949> there<00:01:01.280> all<00:01:02.280> right<00:01:02.340> so<00:01:02.699> it's

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
now is put wire there all right so it's

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.510 
now is put wire there all right so it's
gonna<00:01:03.449> happen<00:01:04.400> there's<00:01:05.400> a<00:01:05.519> lever<00:01:05.729> here<00:01:06.030> and

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 
gonna happen there's a lever here and

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.350 
gonna happen there's a lever here and
actually<00:01:08.520> I<00:01:08.760> guess<00:01:08.909> you<00:01:09.000> only<00:01:09.090> need<00:01:09.240> eight

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
actually I guess you only need eight

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.510 
actually I guess you only need eight
redstone<00:01:09.840> which<00:01:09.960> is<00:01:10.140> good<00:01:10.350> so<00:01:11.130> you<00:01:11.159> need<00:01:11.340> a

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
redstone which is good so you need a

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.420 
redstone which is good so you need a
redstone<00:01:11.790> instead<00:01:12.390> of<00:01:12.479> 10<00:01:13.040> so<00:01:14.040> there's<00:01:14.250> lovely

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
redstone instead of 10 so there's lovely

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.580 
redstone instead of 10 so there's lovely
lever<00:01:14.790> here<00:01:15.119> that's<00:01:15.450> gonna<00:01:15.659> push<00:01:16.049> these

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
lever here that's gonna push these

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.700 
lever here that's gonna push these
Pistons<00:01:17.330> into<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.600> TNT<00:01:19.020> and<00:01:19.290> I'm<00:01:19.500> gonna<00:01:19.619> be

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
Pistons into the TNT and I'm gonna be

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.820 
Pistons into the TNT and I'm gonna be
stuck<00:01:19.920> inside<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.369> TNT<00:01:20.729> and<00:01:20.970> I<00:01:21.150> don't<00:01:21.450> know<00:01:21.830> um

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
stuck inside the TNT and I don't know um

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.820 
stuck inside the TNT and I don't know um
this<00:01:23.340> doesn't<00:01:23.400> work<00:01:23.759> with<00:01:23.909> any<00:01:24.240> other<00:01:24.780> block<00:01:25.470> I

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
this doesn't work with any other block I

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.830 
this doesn't work with any other block I
think<00:01:26.280> I'll<00:01:26.610> try<00:01:26.909> it<00:01:27.030> in<00:01:27.119> a<00:01:27.180> sec<00:01:27.390> with<00:01:27.540> sand

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
think I'll try it in a sec with sand

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.179 
think I'll try it in a sec with sand
after<00:01:28.020> I<00:01:28.259> show<00:01:28.530> you<00:01:28.560> this<00:01:29.840> but<00:01:30.840> it's<00:01:31.409> yeah<00:01:31.950> it's
