00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
don't be afraid to get net clearance

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.990 
don't be afraid to get net clearance
because<00:02:26.300> if<00:02:26.630> your<00:02:26.810> drop<00:02:27.110> shot<00:02:27.760> starts<00:02:28.760> out

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.950 
not sure if the ball is coming back deep
they<00:02:37.310> may<00:02:37.580> read<00:02:37.970> it<00:02:38.180> wrong<00:02:38.420> is<00:02:38.660> what<00:02:38.840> I'm

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:38.960 
they may read it wrong is what I'm

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:39.430 
they may read it wrong is what I'm
saying

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
saying

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.000 
saying
so<00:02:39.880> make<00:02:40.880> sure<00:02:41.210> you<00:02:41.480> get<00:02:41.810> the<00:02:42.140> net<00:02:42.410> clearance

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
so make sure you get the net clearance

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:45.580 
so make sure you get the net clearance
that's<00:02:43.580> key<00:02:44.060> as<00:02:44.600> long<00:02:44.990> as<00:02:45.140> you<00:02:45.230> have<00:02:45.440> the

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
that's key as long as you have the

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.880 
that's key as long as you have the
backspin<00:02:46.160> in<00:02:46.430> the<00:02:46.550> slice<00:02:46.990> it's<00:02:47.990> not<00:02:48.290> going<00:02:48.740> to

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
backspin in the slice it's not going to

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.970 
backspin in the slice it's not going to
go<00:02:49.550> towards<00:02:50.240> your<00:02:50.450> opponent<00:02:50.530> so<00:02:51.530> let's<00:02:51.770> work
