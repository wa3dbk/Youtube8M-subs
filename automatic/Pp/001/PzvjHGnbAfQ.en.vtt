00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:52.540 
pretty full as you can see I'm kind of

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:54.030 
pretty full as you can see I'm kind of
skeptical<00:00:52.989> at<00:00:53.170> the<00:00:53.229> moment<00:00:53.530> this<00:00:53.680> actually

fit<00:00:54.220> up<00:00:54.339> to<00:00:54.369> 300<00:00:54.820> darts<00:00:55.119> in<00:00:56.110> a<00:00:56.229> way<00:00:56.350> like<00:00:56.530> this

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:57.150 
fit up to 300 darts in a way like this

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:59.250 
fit up to 300 darts in a way like this
because<00:00:58.150> when<00:00:58.299> they<00:00:58.390> package<00:00:58.809> the<00:00:58.960> hundred

00:00:59.250 --> 00:00:59.260 
because when they package the hundred

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.500 
because when they package the hundred
darts<00:00:59.589> you<00:00:59.769> know<00:00:59.920> it's<00:01:00.100> it's<00:01:00.580> all<00:01:00.790> stacked

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
know they're carrying a little carrying

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.570 
know they're carrying a little carrying
string<00:01:43.180> at<00:01:43.270> the<00:01:43.300> top<00:01:43.479> is<00:01:44.080> handy<00:01:44.620> and<00:01:44.920> at<00:01:45.460> the

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:45.580 
string at the top is handy and at the

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.440 
string at the top is handy and at the
bottom<00:01:47.520> but<00:01:48.520> when<00:01:48.550> opening<00:01:48.940> it<00:01:49.060> up<00:01:49.150> and<00:01:49.300> see

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
bottom but when opening it up and see

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:12.600 
they're all streamlines you know a few
whistlers

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
whistlers

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:13.920 
whistlers
that's<00:02:13.120> pretty<00:02:13.360> much<00:02:13.480> it<00:02:13.659> but<00:02:13.810> they're<00:02:13.900> all

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
that's pretty much it but they're all

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.990 
that's pretty much it but they're all
elite<00:02:14.200> darts<00:02:14.409> lifestream<00:02:14.950> lines<00:02:15.159> so<00:02:15.879> they're

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
elite darts lifestream lines so they're

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.089 
elite darts lifestream lines so they're
all<00:02:16.120> kind<00:02:16.390> of<00:02:16.420> like<00:02:16.510> the<00:02:16.629> same<00:02:16.810> size<00:02:17.019> and<00:02:18.010> I

00:02:18.089 --> 00:02:18.099 
all kind of like the same size and I

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:20.550 
all kind of like the same size and I
don't<00:02:18.159> think<00:02:18.549> this<00:02:19.150> can<00:02:19.330> this<00:02:19.900> range<00:02:20.140> of<00:02:20.260> darts

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
don't think this can this range of darts

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.170 
don't think this can this range of darts
again<00:02:21.129> I<00:02:21.400> don't<00:02:22.060> think<00:02:22.269> it'll<00:02:23.760> little<00:02:24.760> fit<00:02:24.999> I

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
again I don't think it'll little fit I

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.149 
again I don't think it'll little fit I
mean<00:02:25.389> like<00:02:25.569> I'm<00:02:26.200> ready<00:02:26.439> squad<00:02:26.799> I'm<00:02:26.950> gonna<00:02:27.069> feel

00:02:27.149 --> 00:02:27.159 
mean like I'm ready squad I'm gonna feel

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:28.559 
mean like I'm ready squad I'm gonna feel
like<00:02:27.279> I'm<00:02:27.370> a<00:02:27.430> squash<00:02:27.639> the<00:02:27.760> darts<00:02:28.060> if<00:02:28.180> I

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:28.569 
like I'm a squash the darts if I

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:31.289 
like I'm a squash the darts if I
keep<00:02:28.719> pushing<00:02:29.019> down<00:02:29.849> and<00:02:30.849> you<00:02:30.969> know<00:02:31.060> this<00:02:31.209> is

00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:31.299 
keep pushing down and you know this is

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:32.880 
keep pushing down and you know this is
probably<00:02:31.480> how<00:02:31.780> people<00:02:32.379> are<00:02:32.469> gonna<00:02:32.560> store

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
probably how people are gonna store

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:34.589 
probably how people are gonna store
their<00:02:33.069> darts<00:02:33.400> you<00:02:33.670> know<00:02:33.849> because<00:02:34.150> I<00:02:34.390> don't

00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:34.599 
their darts you know because I don't

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:35.729 
their darts you know because I don't
really<00:02:34.750> think<00:02:34.900> a<00:02:35.019> lot<00:02:35.170> of<00:02:35.200> people<00:02:35.409> have<00:02:35.530> time

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739 
really think a lot of people have time

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:39.509 
really think a lot of people have time
to<00:02:36.010> stack<00:02:36.879> up<00:02:36.930> starts<00:02:37.930> again<00:02:38.560> you<00:02:39.189> know<00:02:39.310> next

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:39.519 
to stack up starts again you know next

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:42.149 
to stack up starts again you know next
to<00:02:39.670> each<00:02:39.760> other<00:02:39.909> and<00:02:40.299> then<00:02:40.450> in<00:02:41.439> a<00:02:41.530> vertical<00:02:41.859> way

00:02:42.149 --> 00:02:42.159 
to each other and then in a vertical way

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:44.550 
to each other and then in a vertical way
people<00:02:42.790> are<00:02:42.909> just<00:02:43.030> gonna<00:02:43.150> talk<00:02:44.049> starts<00:02:44.409> and

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
people are just gonna talk starts and

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:45.839 
people are just gonna talk starts and
they're<00:02:44.650> like<00:02:44.799> after<00:02:45.069> their<00:02:45.250> games<00:02:45.430> like<00:02:45.670> I<00:02:45.790> do

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:45.849 
they're like after their games like I do

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:50.580 
they're like after their games like I do
so<00:02:46.720> I<00:02:47.079> feel<00:02:47.620> like<00:02:47.680> the<00:02:48.340> claim<00:02:49.019> it<00:02:50.019> could<00:02:50.439> be

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
so I feel like the claim it could be

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.530 
so I feel like the claim it could be
true<00:02:50.890> but<00:02:52.200> realistically<00:02:53.579> 200<00:02:54.579> to<00:02:54.760> 250<00:02:55.090> is

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
true but realistically 200 to 250 is

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.559 
true but realistically 200 to 250 is
what<00:02:56.349> you're<00:02:56.500> probably<00:02:56.709> going<00:02:57.430> to<00:02:57.670> a<00:02:57.700> store<00:02:58.000> be

00:02:58.559 --> 00:02:58.569 
what you're probably going to a store be

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:00.330 
what you're probably going to a store be
able<00:02:58.750> to<00:02:58.810> store<00:02:58.989> it<00:02:59.109> safely<00:02:59.260> in<00:02:59.590> here<00:02:59.799> and<00:03:00.069> in

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
able to store it safely in here and in

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:01.860 
able to store it safely in here and in
such<00:03:00.519> a<00:03:00.549> way<00:03:00.760> like<00:03:00.790> this<00:03:01.090> that<00:03:01.510> the<00:03:01.629> darts

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
such a way like this that the darts

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:03.929 
such a way like this that the darts
getting<00:03:02.200> too<00:03:02.889> squashed<00:03:03.250> over<00:03:03.579> each<00:03:03.700> other

00:03:03.929 --> 00:03:03.939 
getting too squashed over each other

00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:05.699 
getting too squashed over each other
when<00:03:04.120> you<00:03:04.150> try<00:03:04.359> to<00:03:04.389> close<00:03:04.689> it<00:03:04.720> all<00:03:05.590> right

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
when you try to close it all right

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:07.500 
when you try to close it all right
everyone's<00:03:06.069> just<00:03:06.340> sort<00:03:06.549> of<00:03:06.730> a<00:03:06.790> durability

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
everyone's just sort of a durability

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:13.080 
everyone's just sort of a durability
slash<00:03:08.430> examining<00:03:09.430> of<00:03:09.639> the<00:03:09.790> lis<00:03:09.970> ammo<00:03:10.180> box<00:03:12.090> you

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
know probably from the in the middle

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.220 
know probably from the in the middle
areas<00:03:17.430> and<00:03:18.629> probably<00:03:19.629> the<00:03:19.720> sides<00:03:19.930> where<00:03:20.169> I

areas and probably the sides where I

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:21.929 
areas and probably the sides where I
expect<00:03:20.590> the<00:03:20.709> most<00:03:20.919> stress<00:03:21.250> just<00:03:21.519> for<00:03:21.730> you<00:03:21.849> know

00:03:21.929 --> 00:03:21.939 
expect the most stress just for you know

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:23.490 
expect the most stress just for you know
it<00:03:22.150> to<00:03:22.239> be<00:03:22.269> tossed<00:03:22.540> around<00:03:22.750> things<00:03:23.139> like<00:03:23.290> that

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
it to be tossed around things like that

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.000 
it to be tossed around things like that
but<00:03:24.430> right<00:03:24.549> now<00:03:24.669> the<00:03:24.730> middle<00:03:25.769> you<00:03:26.769> know<00:03:26.859> it's

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
but right now the middle you know it's

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.800 
but right now the middle you know it's
not<00:03:27.129> caving<00:03:27.879> in<00:03:28.000> I<00:03:28.799> feel<00:03:29.799> like<00:03:29.919> I'm<00:03:30.040> putting<00:03:30.189> a

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
not caving in I feel like I'm putting a

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:35.490 
not caving in I feel like I'm putting a
decent<00:03:31.810> amount<00:03:31.900> of<00:03:32.079> force<00:03:32.290> in<00:03:32.590> here<00:03:34.440> so<00:03:35.440> you

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
decent amount of force in here so you

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.710 
decent amount of force in here so you
know<00:03:35.680> again<00:03:36.579> this<00:03:36.669> is<00:03:36.790> me<00:03:36.909> concentrating<00:03:37.599> it

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
know again this is me concentrating it

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.770 
know again this is me concentrating it
and<00:03:38.379> I<00:03:38.470> don't<00:03:38.530> think<00:03:38.769> it's<00:03:38.889> gonna<00:03:39.010> break<00:03:39.780> so

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
and I don't think it's gonna break so

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.300 
and I don't think it's gonna break so
unless<00:03:41.169> you<00:03:41.319> put<00:03:41.530> this<00:03:41.620> through<00:03:41.829> some<00:03:42.040> kind<00:03:42.220> of

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
unless you put this through some kind of

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:44.789 
unless you put this through some kind of
like<00:03:42.540> you<00:03:43.540> know<00:03:43.569> under<00:03:43.900> a<00:03:43.930> lot<00:03:44.169> of<00:03:44.199> stuff<00:03:44.620> I

00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:44.799 
like you know under a lot of stuff I

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:46.050 
like you know under a lot of stuff I
really<00:03:45.040> don't<00:03:45.220> think<00:03:45.250> it's<00:03:45.459> going<00:03:45.639> to<00:03:45.669> cave<00:03:45.849> in

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
really don't think it's going to cave in

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:50.580 
really don't think it's going to cave in
this<00:03:46.150> area<00:03:47.010> on<00:03:48.010> the<00:03:48.099> side<00:03:48.310> here<00:03:49.379> this<00:03:50.379> is<00:03:50.560> a

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
this area on the side here this is a

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:53.159 
this area on the side here this is a
little<00:03:50.799> bit<00:03:50.889> more<00:03:50.979> flimsy<00:03:51.250> than<00:03:52.049> Center<00:03:53.049> which

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:53.169 
little bit more flimsy than Center which

00:03:53.169 --> 00:03:55.140 
little bit more flimsy than Center which
I<00:03:53.260> just<00:03:53.440> revered<00:03:53.739> on<00:03:54.699> the<00:03:54.819> side<00:03:54.970> you<00:03:55.120> can

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
I just revered on the side you can

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.080 
I just revered on the side you can
definitely<00:03:55.359> see<00:03:55.629> the<00:03:55.750> plastic<00:03:56.909> giving<00:03:57.909> way<00:03:58.060> a

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
definitely see the plastic giving way a

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:59.939 
definitely see the plastic giving way a
little<00:03:58.269> bit<00:03:58.510> I<00:03:58.750> think<00:03:59.290> just<00:03:59.590> that's<00:03:59.829> just

00:03:59.939 --> 00:03:59.949 
little bit I think just that's just

00:03:59.949 --> 00:04:03.869 
little bit I think just that's just
partly<00:04:00.400> by<00:04:00.609> design<00:04:02.280> so<00:04:03.280> if<00:04:03.519> I<00:04:03.639> were<00:04:03.760> you<00:04:03.849> I

00:04:03.869 --> 00:04:03.879 
partly by design so if I were you I

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:06.089 
partly by design so if I were you I
would<00:04:04.090> try<00:04:04.239> to<00:04:04.409> store<00:04:05.409> it<00:04:05.530> like<00:04:05.620> this<00:04:05.769> and<00:04:05.949> put

00:04:06.089 --> 00:04:06.099 
would try to store it like this and put

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:09.210 
would try to store it like this and put
a<00:04:06.129> lot<00:04:06.250> of<00:04:06.340> heavy<00:04:06.430> stuff<00:04:06.549> here<00:04:07.769> or<00:04:08.769> at<00:04:09.069> least

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220 
a lot of heavy stuff here or at least

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:13.679 
a lot of heavy stuff here or at least
not<00:04:09.370> put<00:04:09.519> pressure<00:04:09.760> in<00:04:09.940> the<00:04:10.000> middle<00:04:12.689> I'm

00:04:13.679 --> 00:04:13.689 
not put pressure in the middle I'm

00:04:13.689 --> 00:04:19.469 
not put pressure in the middle I'm
moving<00:04:13.959> to<00:04:14.049> the<00:04:14.139> back<00:04:16.320> same<00:04:18.030> same<00:04:19.030> toughness

00:04:19.469 --> 00:04:19.479 
moving to the back same same toughness

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:21.659 
moving to the back same same toughness
as<00:04:19.900> the<00:04:20.109> other<00:04:20.229> side<00:04:20.440> if<00:04:20.949> anything<00:04:21.280> it<00:04:21.400> feels<00:04:21.579> a

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:21.669 
as the other side if anything it feels a

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:23.730 
as the other side if anything it feels a
little<00:04:21.760> bit<00:04:21.880> more<00:04:21.970> tougher<00:04:22.620> so<00:04:23.620> it's

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:23.740 
little bit more tougher so it's

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:26.580 
little bit more tougher so it's
definitely<00:04:24.099> good<00:04:25.050> alright<00:04:26.050> so<00:04:26.110> here<00:04:26.380> with<00:04:26.530> the

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
definitely good alright so here with the

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:32.029 
definitely good alright so here with the
hinges<00:04:26.949> and<00:04:28.800> Scott<00:04:29.970> metal<00:04:30.970> or<00:04:31.120> aluminum<00:04:31.270> bars

00:04:32.029 --> 00:04:32.039 
hinges and Scott metal or aluminum bars

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:37.350 
hinges and Scott metal or aluminum bars
through<00:04:33.039> here<00:04:33.720> as<00:04:34.720> you<00:04:34.840> guys<00:04:34.900> can<00:04:35.139> see<00:04:36.360> which

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 
through here as you guys can see which

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.260 
through here as you guys can see which
will<00:04:37.510> allow<00:04:37.690> to<00:04:37.750> open<00:04:38.880> people<00:04:39.880> usually<00:04:40.029> don't

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:40.270 
will allow to open people usually don't

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:41.970 
will allow to open people usually don't
store<00:04:40.539> stuff<00:04:40.719> on<00:04:40.900> the<00:04:40.990> hinges

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:41.980 
store stuff on the hinges

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:45.020 
store stuff on the hinges
but<00:04:42.070> if<00:04:42.160> they<00:04:42.250> did<00:04:42.810> inside<00:04:43.810> this<00:04:44.050> one<00:04:44.230> feels

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.030 
but if they did inside this one feels

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:47.490 
but if they did inside this one feels
you<00:04:46.030> know<00:04:46.120> you<00:04:46.390> can<00:04:46.480> see<00:04:46.600> the<00:04:46.720> plastic<00:04:46.930> giving

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:47.500 
you know you can see the plastic giving

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:48.240 
you know you can see the plastic giving
away<00:04:47.620> a<00:04:47.650> little<00:04:47.830> bit

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250 
away a little bit

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:51.240 
away a little bit
there's<00:04:48.580> even<00:04:48.850> a<00:04:48.910> little<00:04:48.940> bit<00:04:49.240> of<00:04:49.270> a<00:04:50.040> maybe<00:04:51.040> get

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:51.250 
there's even a little bit of a maybe get

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:53.630 
there's even a little bit of a maybe get
a<00:04:51.310> hole<00:04:51.580> here<00:04:51.790> that<00:04:51.970> goes<00:04:52.150> to<00:04:52.180> the<00:04:52.420> box<00:04:52.630> if<00:04:52.900> you

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:53.640 
a hole here that goes to the box if you

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.710 
a hole here that goes to the box if you
want<00:04:54.640> to<00:04:54.700> stick<00:04:54.850> your<00:04:54.880> finger<00:04:55.090> in<00:04:55.360> there<00:04:55.390> I

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:55.720 
want to stick your finger in there I

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:57.660 
want to stick your finger in there I
mean<00:04:56.680> I<00:04:56.740> don't<00:04:56.800> see<00:04:56.950> that<00:04:57.160> I<00:04:57.220> don't<00:04:57.400> see<00:04:57.550> the

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:57.670 
mean I don't see that I don't see the

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:01.010 
mean I don't see that I don't see the
dart<00:04:57.880> so<00:04:58.060> I<00:04:58.120> do<00:04:58.360> see<00:04:58.510> a<00:04:58.540> little<00:04:58.690> bit<00:04:58.780> the<00:04:58.900> darts

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020 
dart so I do see a little bit the darts

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.330 
dart so I do see a little bit the darts
so<00:05:02.020> I<00:05:02.050> guess<00:05:02.200> you<00:05:02.320> could<00:05:02.500> stick<00:05:02.950> your<00:05:02.980> finger

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:03.340 
so I guess you could stick your finger

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:04.620 
so I guess you could stick your finger
in<00:05:03.460> there<00:05:03.490> if<00:05:03.760> you<00:05:03.850> wanted<00:05:04.120> to<00:05:04.270> but<00:05:04.450> you<00:05:04.570> know

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:04.630 
in there if you wanted to but you know

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:07.710 
in there if you wanted to but you know
it's<00:05:04.840> definitely<00:05:04.930> not<00:05:05.230> recommended<00:05:06.720> that's

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:07.720 
it's definitely not recommended that's

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:15.000 
it's definitely not recommended that's
for<00:05:07.840> the<00:05:07.930> top<00:05:12.420> it's<00:05:13.420> part<00:05:13.720> of<00:05:13.810> our<00:05:13.960> this<00:05:14.770> side

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:15.010 
for the top it's part of our this side

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:19.470 
for the top it's part of our this side
so<00:05:15.250> I<00:05:15.280> guess<00:05:15.460> it<00:05:15.610> gives<00:05:15.930> gives<00:05:16.930> away<00:05:17.080> a<00:05:17.200> bit<00:05:18.480> in

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:19.480 
so I guess it gives gives away a bit in

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:25.830 
so I guess it gives gives away a bit in
the<00:05:19.600> bottom<00:05:23.700> not<00:05:24.700> just<00:05:25.030> easy<00:05:25.240> to<00:05:25.450> give<00:05:25.630> as<00:05:25.750> the

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:25.840 
the bottom not just easy to give as the

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:28.770 
the bottom not just easy to give as the
top<00:05:26.020> as<00:05:26.230> the<00:05:26.410> top<00:05:27.120> but<00:05:28.120> still<00:05:28.390> gives<00:05:28.570> a<00:05:28.660> little

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:28.780 
top as the top but still gives a little

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:37.190 
top as the top but still gives a little
bit<00:05:30.600> alright<00:05:31.600> so<00:05:31.780> for<00:05:31.900> the<00:05:32.020> latch<00:05:35.760> it's<00:05:36.760> very

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:37.200 
bit alright so for the latch it's very

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:39.600 
bit alright so for the latch it's very
it's<00:05:38.200> like<00:05:38.230> an<00:05:38.410> easy<00:05:38.590> sort<00:05:38.860> of<00:05:38.980> lock<00:05:39.160> to<00:05:39.460> get

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:39.610 
it's like an easy sort of lock to get

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:41.610 
it's like an easy sort of lock to get
out<00:05:39.790> but<00:05:40.120> it<00:05:40.540> serves<00:05:40.720> its<00:05:40.840> purpose<00:05:40.900> well<00:05:41.350> like

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:41.620 
out but it serves its purpose well like

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:43.680 
out but it serves its purpose well like
if<00:05:41.740> you're<00:05:41.860> just<00:05:41.940> pulling<00:05:42.940> it<00:05:43.060> and<00:05:43.210> maybe<00:05:43.390> you

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:43.690 
if you're just pulling it and maybe you

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:45.750 
if you're just pulling it and maybe you
you<00:05:44.470> know<00:05:44.560> I<00:05:44.590> didn't<00:05:44.800> want<00:05:44.950> to<00:05:45.010> open<00:05:45.070> it<00:05:45.370> there

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:45.760 
you know I didn't want to open it there

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:48.470 
you know I didn't want to open it there
were<00:05:45.880> someone<00:05:46.090> was<00:05:46.630> opening<00:05:46.870> it<00:05:46.990> accidentally

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:48.480 
were someone was opening it accidentally

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:50.850 
were someone was opening it accidentally
it's<00:05:49.480> not<00:05:49.600> going<00:05:49.810> to<00:05:49.900> give<00:05:50.050> unless<00:05:50.290> you<00:05:50.470> push

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:50.860 
it's not going to give unless you push

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:55.230 
it's not going to give unless you push
down<00:05:51.070> on<00:05:51.100> the<00:05:51.310> tab<00:05:51.490> and<00:05:52.090> then<00:05:52.210> pull<00:05:52.420> back<00:05:54.120> so<00:05:55.120> it

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:55.240 
down on the tab and then pull back so it

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:57.240 
down on the tab and then pull back so it
seems<00:05:55.420> like<00:05:55.570> a<00:05:55.600> fairly<00:05:55.840> easy<00:05:56.350> but<00:05:57.100> effective

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:57.250 
seems like a fairly easy but effective

00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:59.460 
seems like a fairly easy but effective
way<00:05:57.700> to<00:05:57.760> keep<00:05:58.210> keep<00:05:58.660> it<00:05:58.810> closed<00:05:59.020> so<00:05:59.170> darts

00:05:59.460 --> 00:05:59.470 
way to keep keep it closed so darts

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:00.690 
way to keep keep it closed so darts
don't<00:05:59.680> fall<00:05:59.860> out<00:05:59.890> and<00:06:00.160> things<00:06:00.370> don't<00:06:00.520> you

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:00.700 
don't fall out and things don't you

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:02.520 
don't fall out and things don't you
don't<00:06:00.850> cut<00:06:00.970> your<00:06:01.090> darts<00:06:01.480> it's<00:06:02.170> not<00:06:02.290> again

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:45.130 
I think the ability for the box to hold

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:48.030 
I think the ability for the box to hold
200<00:06:45.700> to<00:06:45.820> 250<00:06:46.090> elite<00:06:46.600> darts<00:06:46.810> in<00:06:47.230> a<00:06:47.560> messy<00:06:47.800> way<00:06:47.920> of
