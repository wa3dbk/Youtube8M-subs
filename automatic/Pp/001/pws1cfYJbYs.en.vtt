okay this is a video to show that mk2

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.150 
okay this is a video to show that mk2
can<00:00:04.110> be<00:00:04.259> displayed<00:00:04.710> with<00:00:04.980> a<00:00:05.009> converter<00:00:07.160> see

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
can be displayed with a converter see

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.490 
can be displayed with a converter see
it's<00:00:10.340> everything's<00:00:11.340> off<00:00:11.580> right<00:00:11.910> now<00:00:12.290> is<00:00:13.290> the

it's everything's off right now is the

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.210 
it's everything's off right now is the
test<00:00:13.799> board<00:00:14.240> it's<00:00:15.240> got<00:00:15.450> some<00:00:15.660> issues<00:00:16.220> let's

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
test board it's got some issues let's

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:34.600 
test board it's got some issues let's
turn<00:00:17.520> this<00:00:17.670> on<00:00:17.910> and<00:00:18.180> see<00:00:18.300> what<00:00:18.449> happens

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:34.610 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:37.510 

capacitors<00:00:35.610> and<00:00:36.059> I'll<00:00:36.180> have<00:00:36.329> a<00:00:36.360> control<00:00:36.930> so<00:00:37.260> I

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:37.520 
capacitors and I'll have a control so I

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.740 
capacitors and I'll have a control so I
do<00:00:38.520> this<00:00:38.730> through<00:00:38.969> my<00:00:39.180> sort<00:00:39.390> of<00:00:39.450> switches

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.590 

here<00:00:43.170> is<00:00:43.580> you<00:00:44.580> might<00:00:44.760> have<00:00:44.790> to<00:00:45.000> let<00:00:45.300> it<00:00:45.450> run

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
here is you might have to let it run

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.570 
here is you might have to let it run
through<00:00:45.660> so<00:00:46.530> you<00:00:46.620> got<00:00:46.800> some<00:00:46.980> problems<00:00:47.400> with

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:47.580 
through so you got some problems with

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:56.000 
through so you got some problems with
this<00:00:47.700> pork

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:18.390 

like<00:00:57.010> this<00:00:57.220> which<00:00:57.520> will<00:00:57.730> be<00:00:57.880> outside

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:18.400 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:27.609 

-<00:01:18.670> coin<00:01:18.940> buttons

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:27.619 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:30.279 

so<00:01:28.219> it's<00:01:28.520> not<00:01:28.700> locking<00:01:28.969> up<00:01:29.329> like<00:01:29.600> some<00:01:29.899> people

00:01:30.279 --> 00:01:30.289 
so it's not locking up like some people

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:40.359 
so it's not locking up like some people
have<00:01:30.409> reported

00:01:40.359 --> 00:01:40.369 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:43.770 

yeah<00:01:41.119> I<00:01:41.149> can<00:01:41.479> hear

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.370 

so<00:01:44.780> again<00:01:45.790> the<00:01:46.790> only<00:01:47.030> thing<00:01:47.300> I<00:01:47.450> did<00:01:47.720> maybe

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
so again the only thing I did maybe

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.570 
so again the only thing I did maybe
differently<00:01:48.950> as<00:01:49.400> I<00:01:49.550> did<00:01:49.790> hook<00:01:50.000> the<00:01:50.210> 5<00:01:50.420> volts<00:01:50.870> to

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:51.580 
differently as I did hook the 5 volts to

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.700 
differently as I did hook the 5 volts to
this<00:01:52.580> special<00:01:52.880> connector<00:01:53.540> from<00:01:53.750> paradise<00:01:54.290> I

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
this special connector from paradise I

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.770 
this special connector from paradise I
did<00:01:55.070> not<00:01:55.250> buy<00:01:55.430> my<00:01:55.640> converter<00:01:56.060> from<00:01:56.330> paradise

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
did not buy my converter from paradise

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:02.170 
did not buy my converter from paradise
oh<00:01:59.110> and<00:02:00.110> I'm<00:02:00.230> using<00:02:00.500> the<00:02:01.340> Jama<00:02:01.670> harness

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
oh and I'm using the Jama harness

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.340 
oh and I'm using the Jama harness
directly<00:02:02.720> to<00:02:02.930> it<00:02:03.110> and<00:02:03.290> no<00:02:03.470> adapters<00:02:05.350> so

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
directly to it and no adapters so

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.340 
directly to it and no adapters so
hopefully<00:02:06.860> that's<00:02:07.070> helpful
