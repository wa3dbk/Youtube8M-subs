00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
pounds since Thanksgiving when you add

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.960 
pounds since Thanksgiving when you add
that<00:01:30.240> up<00:01:30.570> that<00:01:31.320> is<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.710> perfect<00:01:32.310> amount<00:01:32.640> of

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
that up that is the perfect amount of

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.560 
that up that is the perfect amount of
weight<00:01:33.240> to<00:01:33.920> lose<00:01:34.920> on<00:01:35.250> a<00:01:35.310> monthly<00:01:36.000> basis

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
weight to lose on a monthly basis

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.090 
weight to lose on a monthly basis
because<00:01:36.990> if<00:01:37.259> you<00:01:37.380> lose<00:01:37.619> weight<00:01:37.829> too<00:01:38.070> quickly

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
because if you lose weight too quickly

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.550 
because if you lose weight too quickly
guess<00:01:38.909> what<00:01:39.180> it's<00:01:39.570> going<00:01:39.689> to<00:01:39.810> come<00:01:40.020> right<00:01:40.079> back

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.340 
guess what it's going to come right back
on<00:01:40.860> because<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.460> body<00:01:41.670> wasn't<00:01:41.970> designed<00:01:42.350> to
