00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:06.980
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:10.760
 Hello 

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:14.110
 Ryokan Minaki Kikuno House in Yonago City, Tottori Prefecture 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:20.570
 It is always a young girl Hiroko 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:29.150
 Thank you very much for watching the channel on the Kaikina youtube channel 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:35.360
 Today I would like to tell you more about the taste of the 2- year-old winter taste Matsuba crab in Matsuba . 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:42.290
 First one will be what Fu is the Tteyuu Matsuba crab 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:46.300
 In the first case, it's awkward, but it's too long for my brother to have a long leg 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:49.620
 That is swung Trevi Arno pine entering Kushira 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:55.560
 Also I like it but it is said it is 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:01:03.290
 There is a sense of being tagged with compatibility, what did that feel like? 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:09.870
 It was that the form of the red crab in that probably is the next to or that flower You know, Tottori Prefecture 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:13.980
 The tag that I wrote "Matsuha crab" was attached when the ban on the crab was around 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:17.909
 The opening day of the crab is 2 weeks of that November 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:22.310
 It will start about six days, yes 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:25.340
 I think there is a cage on the idea of 10 days 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.480
 That pond is that day-ban day 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.670

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:36.200

 I will buy that key and understand it at the same time and provide it to that customer 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:48.270
 I think you can be happy in the active pine needles crab very customer 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:48.270

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:08.020
