00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:12.360
 Hello, I want to share my 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:17.310
 observations about car bombs 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:21.289
 classics alive us classics that I saw 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:25.949
 what's the difference what options are about 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:33.420
 tom that is with such i met here 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:35.130
 For example, this is a native company 0 and 1 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:41.610
 complete set ravalal of 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:49.710
 cars 2101 clean and sixth and so 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:52.670
 Further models are the usual quality 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:01:00.170
 classic remember 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:01:05.489
 if u make out we see if the cup and 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:10.920
 see the case and see the case here 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:13.850
 look carefully there is housing 21 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.850
 073 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:25.439
 what is it different in appearance they are the same 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:30.920
 completely but different working 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:35.119
 work surface 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:40.680
 Where does the glove zone work? 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:42.720
 contact for example in this classic 0 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:49.700
 1 width 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:49.700
 working width 14 mm 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:56.880
 on pump 2107 10 years in the housing 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:08.490
 a distance of 18 millimeters in diameter 8 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:14.320
 millimeters of the border 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:20.170
 now if you put this impeller 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:24.940
 old type on case 073 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:31.590
 I think productivity and secretly you 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:37.530
 will decrease here I took new points this 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:38.680
 this company and for it as if 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:45.100
 original 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:58.299
 from the conveyor here there is a film these and here 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:03:02.769
 painted 2107 2107 here shows fell 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:10.380
 He's a set with a gasket that goes like this 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:10.380
 I remember compared to this classic 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:20.860
 diameter is much larger but original 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.850
 as all claim that the original 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:27.750
 Avtozavodskaya 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:31.500
 pump comes with a plastic impeller 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.500
 I do not know why 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:38.110
 and how do they go too, do not know but here 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:42.950
 if such 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:45.160
 fiber to put on a classic 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:45.160
 body 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:51.740
 performance may be less 

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:54.820
 because contact width is width 

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:58.150
 contact is much less than in the body 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:58.150
 2107 10 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:14.350
 there are also firms of the Belarusian company 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:19.060
 ratings firm written body 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:23.060
 2101 because casting is the same they are all 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:28.570
 housing 2101 complex but impeller here 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:31.670
 youth construction 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:38.870
 slightly different here in the spring can be seen 

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:41.560
 and here the spring is closed in this you can see 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:50.660
 the diameter of the diameter they are the same 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:55.370
 the same pump and body 021 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:57.940
 073 will just work fine 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:05:01.820
 because width 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:04.430
 contact of contact zone and fiber zone 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:07.910
 match and there will be performance 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:12.830
 points are maximum but insert wide 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:16.910
 large fiber to the pump housing 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:21.680
 pump 2101 performance I think not 

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:27.190
 increase but so short that I noticed 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:27.190
 difference and all thanks for your attention
