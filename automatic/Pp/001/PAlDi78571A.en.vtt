we're<00:01:02.699> actually<00:01:02.879> seeing<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.840> identity<00:01:04.350> plate

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
we're actually seeing the identity plate

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.010 
we're actually seeing the identity plate
up<00:01:04.799> here<00:01:05.070> in<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.339> upper<00:01:05.369> left<00:01:06.240> hand<00:01:06.450> corner<00:01:06.600> so

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
up here in the upper left hand corner so

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.109 
up here in the upper left hand corner so
this<00:01:07.200> is<00:01:07.350> a<00:01:07.470> great<00:01:07.890> way<00:01:08.130> for<00:01:08.369> example<00:01:08.700> if<00:01:09.030> you

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
this is a great way for example if you

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.480 
this is a great way for example if you
wanted<00:01:09.390> to<00:01:09.450> brand<00:01:09.960> your<00:01:10.229> studio<00:01:10.650> maybe<00:01:11.189> in<00:01:11.369> the

sales room if you're selling through
Lightroom<00:01:13.200> you<00:01:13.590> would<00:01:13.770> have<00:01:13.950> that<00:01:14.220> identity

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
Lightroom you would have that identity

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.300 
Lightroom you would have that identity
plate<00:01:15.180> up<00:01:15.420> there<00:01:15.750> alright<00:01:16.619> once<00:01:17.130> we've

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
plate up there alright once we've

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.429 
plate up there alright once we've
created<00:01:17.490> this<00:01:17.909> identity<00:01:18.420> plate<00:01:18.659> then<00:01:19.170> I'll

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
created this identity plate then I'll

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.370 
created this identity plate then I'll
use<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:20.009> custom<00:01:20.490> option<00:01:20.700> to<00:01:21.150> save<00:01:21.540> as<00:01:21.840> and

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
use the custom option to save as and

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.270 
use the custom option to save as and
I'll<00:01:22.950> save<00:01:23.310> this<00:01:23.610> as<00:01:23.820> P<00:01:24.810> B<00:01:25.140> for<00:01:25.470> photography<00:01:26.070> by

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
I'll save this as P B for photography by

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.749 
I'll save this as P B for photography by

to the print module you can see that in

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.980 
to the print module you can see that in
the<00:02:53.070> page<00:02:53.430> area<00:02:53.940> here<00:02:54.270> this<00:02:54.450> is<00:02:54.630> where<00:02:54.810> I<00:02:54.840> would

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:54.990 
the page area here this is where I would

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:58.640 
the page area here this is where I would
add<00:02:55.380> my<00:02:55.650> identity<00:02:56.220> plate<00:02:56.430> so<00:02:56.940> I<00:02:57.210> can<00:02:57.570> add<00:02:57.990> not

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
add my identity plate so I can add not

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.890 
add my identity plate so I can add not
only<00:02:59.070> a<00:02:59.100> watermark<00:02:59.970> so<00:03:00.210> for<00:03:00.390> example<00:03:00.720> if<00:03:00.810> I

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
only a watermark so for example if I

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.140 
only a watermark so for example if I
wanted<00:03:01.170> to<00:03:01.260> put<00:03:01.470> the<00:03:01.620> word<00:03:01.770> proof<00:03:02.190> over<00:03:02.460> all<00:03:02.880> of

wanted to put the word proof over all of

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.630 
wanted to put the word proof over all of
my<00:03:03.270> images<00:03:03.420> I<00:03:03.810> can<00:03:04.290> add<00:03:04.530> that<00:03:04.800> as<00:03:05.040> a<00:03:05.070> watermark

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
my images I can add that as a watermark

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.910 
my images I can add that as a watermark
but<00:03:06.090> then<00:03:06.210> I<00:03:06.270> can<00:03:06.450> change<00:03:06.750> the<00:03:07.080> margin<00:03:07.560> here<00:03:07.590> at

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
but then I can change the margin here at

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.790 
but then I can change the margin here at
the<00:03:08.070> top<00:03:08.340> and<00:03:08.640> go<00:03:08.670> ahead<00:03:09.360> and<00:03:09.540> add<00:03:09.750> my<00:03:09.800> identity
