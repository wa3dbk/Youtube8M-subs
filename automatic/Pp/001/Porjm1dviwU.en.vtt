 I just finished avoiding my first 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:22.500
 short called overdose is a 

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:25.140
 parody that goes on the hysteria of 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.360
 pasotism and about the difficulties of 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.030

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.470

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.160

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.260
 I am this forest is waste with the 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.690

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.399
 which is an essay for medium projects 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.290
 I have but that is to say that this 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.620
 truly for me it has been like my 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.930
 first great video project let's say 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.340
 that today I only have a sketch edeeste in 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.059
 this channel that is that of shakira 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.559
 previously it was almost all improvised in 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.820
 they are really there was not so much preparation 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.200
 how has this fair and so 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.200
 excited and about time I do it and such 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:03.510
 what we are going to do is like a 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:06.149
 teaser vicenÃ§ ferrer make a video 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.100
 to summarize a trailer fuck in plan 

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:09.840
 30 seconds of the video last three minutes 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.060
 and means that appearing feel rich 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:16.459
 as for and I'm just going to hang in 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.459
 my channel is already like a piece of 

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:20.609
 overdose for me has been explained before 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.679
 the fact of having an idea in the head 

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:24.600
 and then see it on the screen after 

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:26.579
 a process of writing do a 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.139
 storyboard because in this case in three 

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:30.090
 characters are taxed separately and 

00:01:28.139 --> 00:01:31.859
 you have to record the whole subject of 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.810
 character then another and then another and 

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:36.550
 clear in a lot of preparation behind 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.080
 a video of these 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:41.870
 and 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:44.420
 why do not you shut up because you do not shut up 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:46.220

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.690
 in the edit part that the most 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.450
 fun you can record brand new super 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:56.780
