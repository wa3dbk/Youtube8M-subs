00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 hello friends of the community what in 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.960
 deraa and youtube I hope you are very well 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.790
 today I come as the title says a top 5 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.849
 of which in my opinion are the bosses 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:14.070
 more difficult breaks frustrating balls and 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.049
 shit from video games from 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.090
 right now I tell you I will not put bosses 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.580
 known and beaten as sephiroth or 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.800
 mike tyson because while they are bosses 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.320
 quite expensive this is a list 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.960
 staff and just rank and bosses against 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.630
 those that I have faced because top 5 and 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.940
 no top 10 simple because bosses that 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.219
 they really screwed up my life 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.250
 have made me scream and despair only 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:40.710
 I can mention these five and the worst of 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.870
 all all that I will mention are bosses 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.940
 obligatory so you must egg 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.700
 kill him if you want to advance the plot 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.550
 let's not give more thought to the matter and 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.699
 let's start the video in 5th place 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.890
 We have ridley of the meter gone trm fuck 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.379
 what trauma and pain of fingers left me this 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.449
 son of a bitch to start you're just 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.030
 can do harm with the plasma beam 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.519
 his attacks go down quite a bit and be careful if 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.659
 he grabs you because I do not exaggerate when saying that 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.329
 You can download one 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.759
 whole life when you manage to hit 

00:01:09.329 --> 00:01:13.679
 some shots your skin becomes so hard 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:15.539
 that neither the plasma beam can make 

00:01:13.679 --> 00:01:18.149
 nothing at this time you just have to worry 

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:19.920
 for trying to dodge their attacks and for 

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:22.229
 please do not bother trying to 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.420
 shoot him when he's in this mode not 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.179
 matter how loaded you have the shot 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.700
 You will not do anything to him when he runs out of this 

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:31.289
 you must do the same and so several 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.829
 times to kill him 

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:37.349
 ridley spit we go to post 4 here 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:40.530
 we have the addon of the star fox adventure 

00:01:37.349 --> 00:01:42.599
 is this boss no matter how many times I 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.179
 in front of him has always cost me 

00:01:42.599 --> 00:01:47.640
 a lot of work killing him is a dinosaur 

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:50.189
 that is frozen in a cavern and at 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.890
 Killing him will give you the first spellstore of 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.840
 fire to kill him you must shoot him in 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.060
 the tail and to catch its tail is very 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.069
 difficult since it moves a lot and to 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.259
 shoot the attack that harms you must 

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:03.509
 put the look and if it moves and you lose the 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:06.119
 You did not have to try 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:08.399
 catch the tail again after that 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.379
 he eats you and I do not remember what happens next 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:13.440
 but the gift deserves very well this 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:15.660
 put in the 'top in position 3 we have 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.000
 dark lord of the game 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.220
 castlevania lords of shadow ' is the 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.770
 first of the three dark lords and 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.480
 so far the most difficult eye yet 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:27.420
 I have not fought against the dark lord 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.580
 necromancer has two phases first is a 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.890
 bearded and muscular man with a stranger 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.780
 cane that constantly creates waves 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.180
 expansive ones that go down a quantity 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.310
 considerable life this phase is not very 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.350
 difficult you just have to try to dodge 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.170
 his attacks and attack him quickly 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:45.000
 When you kill him, he becomes a wolf 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:48.150
 more bastard and here the 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.160
 butchery good in itself he should not be 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.320
 so difficult the problem is that I from 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.030
 asshole I spent all the magic and part 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:56.700
 of my life killing the previous wii 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.470
 believing that it would be everything and finally finish 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.140
 without magic and with half my life 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:03.240
 fighting with this monster his attacks 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.700
 they were devastating despite their size 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:08.130
 it was quite fast and the only way to 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.200
 replenish my life was with light magic and 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:12.480
 to get it I had to go into mode 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.610
 concentration and to get to this mode 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.710
 you must hit the enemy all that 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.810
 you can do anything without you and when 

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:20.160
 finally arrived at that mode in chinga 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.530
 I stuck everything I could 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.900
 to get more magic and when finally 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.850
 killed him there was a minigame in the 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.400
 that appeared some statues that you should 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:30.180
 break them all each more resistant 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.700
 than the previous 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.620
 the wolf followed you and if he killed you you should 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:37.350
 start the minigame again from scratch 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.600
 then there was a session of buttons 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:41.910
 that was to fit a stake 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:44.670
 giant silver to finally kill the son 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:47.310
 of literal bitch this certainly a boss 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:49.740
 difficult to death in position 2 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.500
 there is a boss who sure few know 

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:54.990
 but it will seriously make your life miserable 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:57.480
 and it's the giant spiderman robot one 

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:59.610
 of mubi many say that the boss more 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:02.430
 difficult of this game is the end the 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:04.770
 Green Goblin but they know fuck is 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:06.930
 assholes for me it's not only you should 

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:09.330
 throw him off the glider dodge his 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:11.430
 bombs shoot at distance cobwebs 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:13.860
 and there was the asshole not me 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:15.810
 misunderstand the green elf was difficult 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:18.480
 but it's not close to being so 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:20.519
 difficult like this is more a test than 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:22.830
 a boss you must deactivate the 10 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:25.350
 generators that make it work these 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:27.000
 they are quite separated from each other and 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:29.280
 while you try to get there 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.380
 and the robots that help you will be 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.360
 shooting and these do not go down so little 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:35.940
 life that we say and if the giant robot 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.920
 throw your laser beam there if you've already 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:39.930
 because devastating falls short 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:42.480
 compared to the damage that does to you 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:45.780
 mother finally we come to the end of this 

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:48.630
 top let's review put ridley 5 meter 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:51.360
 and tote lm put 4 galdÃ³n of the star fox 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:53.400
 adventure is put 3 the dark lord 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.500
 Werewolf and position 2 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:58.470
 the giant robot spider-man one 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:01.410
 mubi thanks for watching this video score 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:03.419
 and comment and move to position 1 in the 

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:05.580
 throne and winner of the gold medal and 

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:07.470
 the recognition to the most difficult boss to 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:09.830
 that I have faced takes it without 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:12.600
 place to doubt lucifer of dante's inferno 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:14.669
 has two phases in the first one 

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:15.900
 shoot crosses to circles that 

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:17.820
 has on his forehead 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:20.220
 while jumping to avoid the waves 

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:22.620
 expansive that leaves on the floor after 

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:24.750
 of that will let show its weak point 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:26.940
 you must shoot with the cross everything that 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:29.400
 you can to lower life so that 's all the 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:31.980
 phase alone that will constantly be made more 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.840
 fast and your attacks will fall more 

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:36.300
 this phase was so serious to me 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:38.010
 so fucking hard mind that I said to 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:39.750
 fuck your mother and lower her 

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:42.630
 difficulty to easy because of what 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:44.250
 otherwise I would never have beaten him in his 

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:46.800
 second phase is in its traditional form 

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:49.290
 a great design and very well done by 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:51.480
 true his attacks do not go down so much but 

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:53.790
 teleport can avoid launching 

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:56.070
 swords that go down a lot of life and for 

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:58.650
 high throws some light bombs that put 

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:59.700
 white the screen does not come down, but if 

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:02.130
 they are very annoying 

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:04.500
 no matter if you attack away their 

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:07.230
 swords will reach wherever you are and 

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:07.650
 the stage is quite big because of that 

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:10.170
 and more 

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:12.000
 lucifer deserves the position one as the 

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:14.580
 most difficult boss of videogames 

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.400
 good friends, I hope you enjoyed 

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:20.340
 this video and do not worry anymore soon 

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:22.580
 I will upload the results of the exam is all 

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:22.580
 chayito
