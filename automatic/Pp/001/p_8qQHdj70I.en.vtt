00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.840
 Oh 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.750
 Today is nice house and nice flat 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.490
 sinning seems to be no problem 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.399
 collab stay together so always 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:23.530
 can row nicely with manure and will google 

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:24.939
 much heavier especially with the is 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.649
 part and top down say 

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:29.890
 that is of course as flat as 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:32.049
 billiard cloth so there is not much to it now 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:35.020
 I am already looking forward I have none 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:37.119
 of course pretty good Ray and me 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.340
 feel really good on your bike and yes 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:42.549
 I take another look from there to here you 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:44.289
 again for intra i have i have your last 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:46.659
 once with the cooking stage to stand mx2 

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:49.020
 back then so I hope this would 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:49.020
 to calculate 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:10.390
 enter there already 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.980
 yes treacherous is in too light, it is 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.830
 is not really sand is not really hard 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.750
 bit in yes or sloeber own in shovel 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.860
 row is always the question you are as one as 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.319
 In the morning, welmers group of people is more 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.510
 no more it is of course yes one 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:24.610
 non-dutch job as will be given 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.920
 with the winch on a mountain it is really something 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.239
 foreign in dutch and i think that 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.680
 therefore many people are the one 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:32.080
 find a nice job and why to drive 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.840
 is n't really my favorite 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.040
 jobs prefer them in this sand however 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.769
 it's just a second beautiful see 

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.120
 that would be the top that are still 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:42.190
 fairly insidious 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.230
 after this a boat sinks up or 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.069
 over the boulders or 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.230
 yes it is always a bit 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:49.590
 watch out here like this 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.590
 with this 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:18.180
 if you look like that the mouse is the job of 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.430
 in terms of running because it is free 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.290
 hilly and yet speed a bit 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.920
 it is more American with it up there 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.860
 down 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.270
 only the competition is a bit difficult 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.010
 turn around and then the jobs come whole 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:31.860
 hard to lie in and quite the whole 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:34.110
 very high for how long the bay comes 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.250
 lies with or by the bye bye and 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:38.300
 Yes 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.300
 hope to be cheap there 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:54.450
 you 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.069
 yes makes me not really matter 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:13.110
 no met is important very well 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:16.829
 I have had good result no move 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:18.389
 and more one is always a very 

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:20.310
 difficult job in the race to get on 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:21.780
 drive and I really like it until now 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:23.400
 always very good 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:25.290
 and we hope this year it has always 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.790
 We've been together for curfew it 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:29.340
 would name a thousandth of the room 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:31.410
 was Braille and I was seven and first 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:33.960
 mars was turning 4x and second heat was 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:35.610
 16 x 7 Braille and that's how we always sit 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.290
 well Harry's times together I don't know 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:38.850
 how it comes and how what where it is 

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:40.229
 always like that 

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:42.240
 yes it is actually always funny 

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:43.830
 if you like the results ct we are stuck 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.130
 already close together so it is beautiful 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.130
 actually 

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:52.729
 here
