00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:06.120
 [Music] 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.040
 Hello Hello everyone I hope you 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.929
 find very well in this video 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.080
 I'm going to teach how I did this organizer 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:16.500
 of enamels and shelves that fit more 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.779
 or less here are between 85 to 100 enamels 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.689
 everything depends on what size they are or what 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.849
 so wide they are if they are like these 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:27.269
 obvious and 8m klein that are a little bit more 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:29.880
 widths fit 85 exactly but if 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:33.090
 you have varnishes that are more 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.130
 thin like these from estelÃ­ hansen or 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.290
 those skinny ones that are with the brochita 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.300
 although skinny maybe if they fit 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.550
 up to 100 glazes everything depends on what 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.340
 size are the varnishes that I have in 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.920
 this time are 100 varnishes that I have 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.450
 right now in the organizer or this idea of 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.240
 make this enamel organizer 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.040
 because I kept them in a little box and 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:57.120
 it was already filling and I could not 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:01:00.270
 so I wanted to do something where where 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.760
 I could see them and be choosing the 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.979
 colors that I was going to use and so I can 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.950
 see what colors I want to use and it's more 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:11.840
 easy for me to choose 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.840
 enamel I will use for that day 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:14.130
 i 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.549
 I made this enamel organizer 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.600
 wood so it's a bit more 

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:22.969
 long lasting 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.979
 there are some videos of organizers of 

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:29.149
 glazes that are made like cardboard 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:31.130
 but I do not know if those who endure so much 

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:32.119
 weight I do not know why that always if it's 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.539
 heavy 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:38.119
 I do not know if ps like until then and 25 

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:41.060
 free I'm not sure but yes yes it's 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:42.560
 a bit heavy maybe being an organizer 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.689
 that was lasting so it is that 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:48.979
 I can move through several parts and I do not know 

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:52.099
 is going to undo and I have raised it and I do not know 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:53.990
 he has undone me good girls if you 

00:01:52.099 --> 00:01:56.470
 I would like to see how I did keep seeing 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.470
 this video 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.770
 the materials that they will need is going to 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.320
 be painting your taste and use a 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:06.350
 white paint a pencil a tape for 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:09.319
 measure nails a hammer a few skewers 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.729
 to paint and wood the first thing that 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:13.160
 they're going to do is they're going to start doing 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:15.080
 the base 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.510
 you are going to nail some nails well 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.650
 delgadito I put between 3 to 4 nails 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:38.550
 at every turn 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:41.010
 [Music] 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:43.050
 since they have nailed the four woods 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.380
 that's how the base is 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:48.660
 now we are going to finish the woods in 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:51.690
 more or less are between 4 points 6 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:54.120
 inches are going to grab your pencil and they're going 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:57.860
 to paint so they know where they are going to go 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.860
 riveted from the woods in 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:05.220
 the reason why I made it 4.6 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:09.290
 inches away was for me to 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.290
 they saw my varnishes the highest 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:14.500
 to nail the woods in also 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:16.599
 you can put between 4 to 7 nails all 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.810
 it depends on how stable they want 

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:18.810
 stay 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:23.969
 [Music] 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:29.790
 and that's how the base with the 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.690
 woods inside now we are going to put 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:37.669
 the wood you will see back 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:37.669
 [Music] 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:42.800
 One little thing we want to mention is 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:44.900
 I 'm not a portfolio nor am I an expert in 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:46.760
 this but more in the speech of an idea of 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.040
 how I wanted this organizer to stay 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.750
 and with the help of my husband the Chinese 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.340
 what I am doing here I am 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:54.830
 living to know and understand today to 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:56.060
 put nails and again you 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:58.550
 you can put the nails that this 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:01.430
 dismissal that then offers seven to 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:05.310
 ten keys so that an organizer 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:13.470
 That is stable and durable 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:15.630
 [Music] 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:18.390
 using the white paint I put it in a 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:21.000
 cup like this and using a skewer 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:23.060
 how I started painting the organizer 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.550
 of enamels 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:28.250
 what I did was that I put three 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:32.030
 past of the same painting and between each 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:34.800
 last I used the enamel organizer to 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:57.399
 dry are not like about 10 minutes 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:57.399
 [Music] 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:03.639
 and finally grab these plastics and 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:06.120
 I put glue on them and I started to paste them 

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:07.280
 in the enamel organizer 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.560
 [Music] 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:11.600
 I wanted to grab some plastics that were 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:14.870
 transparent because I can see what 

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:16.610
 enamel I'm going to use and also when I'm 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:18.950
 moving my organizer a lot 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:21.820
 enamels are not going to come towards me 

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:28.960
 opposite the varnishes 

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:30.740
 [Music] 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:56.130
 do not 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:56.130
 [Music] 

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:04.270
 very soon I will make the video of the 

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:05.830
 collection of my varnishes I'm not going to 

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:08.500
 put on this video because I do not want that 

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:10.180
 this video is so something but I hope that 

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:12.340
 you are very well all of you 

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:13.690
