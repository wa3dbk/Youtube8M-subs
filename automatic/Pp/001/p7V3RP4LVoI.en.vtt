00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:07.390 
fall into a pile of it on the way here

00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:09.330 
fall into a pile of it on the way here
you<00:07:07.510> worked<00:07:07.690> hard<00:07:07.930> for<00:07:08.260> it<00:07:08.290> and<00:07:08.470> you<00:07:08.920> want<00:07:09.100> more

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:09.340 
you worked hard for it and you want more

of it and you hate to see it go away
unnecessarily<00:07:11.680> I<00:07:12.400> think<00:07:13.240> you<00:07:13.330> need<00:07:13.480> to<00:07:13.570> do

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:13.690 
unnecessarily I think you need to do

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:15.090 
unnecessarily I think you need to do
something<00:07:13.930> a<00:07:14.230> little<00:07:14.290> bit<00:07:14.560> different<00:07:15.010> with

00:07:15.090 --> 00:07:15.100 
something a little bit different with

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:17.100 
something a little bit different with
your<00:07:15.190> approach<00:07:15.550> because<00:07:16.420> if<00:07:16.540> you<00:07:16.660> do<00:07:16.810> the<00:07:16.960> same

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:17.110 
your approach because if you do the same

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:18.810 
your approach because if you do the same
as<00:07:17.290> most<00:07:17.470> people<00:07:17.890> you're<00:07:18.280> probably<00:07:18.520> going<00:07:18.730> to

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:18.820 
as most people you're probably going to

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:21.570 
as most people you're probably going to
struggle<00:07:19.270> to<00:07:19.690> beat<00:07:20.260> the<00:07:20.410> markets<00:07:20.860> and<00:07:21.100> that

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:21.580 
struggle to beat the markets and that

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:24.360 
struggle to beat the markets and that
means<00:07:21.790> that<00:07:21.940> when<00:07:22.030> the<00:07:22.120> markets<00:07:22.480> go<00:07:22.660> up<00:07:23.220> we<00:07:24.220> do

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:24.370 
means that when the markets go up we do

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:26.310 
means that when the markets go up we do
okay<00:07:24.790> but<00:07:25.030> we<00:07:25.120> don't<00:07:25.360> beat<00:07:25.660> the<00:07:25.840> markets<00:07:26.200> when

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:26.320 
okay but we don't beat the markets when

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:28.920 
okay but we don't beat the markets when
the<00:07:26.380> markets<00:07:26.710> go<00:07:26.860> down<00:07:27.270> we<00:07:28.270> get<00:07:28.450> wiped<00:07:28.660> out
