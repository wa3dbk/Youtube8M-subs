he's not taught that to me but um I

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.330 
he's not taught that to me but um I
think<00:01:48.990> that's<00:01:49.409> that's<00:01:49.680> a<00:01:49.799> great<00:01:49.979> thing<00:01:50.159> I

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
think that's that's a great thing I

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.210 
think that's that's a great thing I
think<00:01:50.520> he's<00:01:50.640> got<00:01:50.820> great<00:01:51.030> taste<00:01:51.060> in<00:01:51.799> music<00:01:52.799> and

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
think he's got great taste in music and

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.490 
think he's got great taste in music and
in<00:01:53.369> song<00:01:53.970> so<00:01:54.240> if<00:01:54.329> he<00:01:54.420> likes<00:01:54.630> it<00:01:54.810> that's<00:01:54.899> great<00:01:55.259> I

in song so if he likes it that's great I

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.380 
in song so if he likes it that's great I

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
think the response for techne to really

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.060 
think the response for techne to really
has<00:01:57.570> been<00:01:57.780> really<00:01:58.079> it's<00:01:58.320> been<00:01:58.500> really<00:01:58.619> fun<00:01:58.829> so

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
has been really it's been really fun so

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.399 
has been really it's been really fun so
far<00:01:59.310> and<00:01:59.549> I<00:01:59.729> mean<00:02:00.420> it<00:02:00.509> was<00:02:00.659> hard<00:02:00.840> work<00:02:01.079> you're

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
far and I mean it was hard work you're

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:02.959 
far and I mean it was hard work you're
right<00:02:01.560> about<00:02:01.680> that<00:02:01.829> it<00:02:02.100> was<00:02:02.189> very<00:02:02.399> fast<00:02:02.700> then

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
right about that it was very fast then

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.749 
right about that it was very fast then
it's<00:02:03.119> not<00:02:03.270> a<00:02:03.299> style<00:02:03.659> that<00:02:03.990> I<00:02:04.380> was<00:02:05.219> used<00:02:05.460> to<00:02:05.549> but

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
it's not a style that I was used to but

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.219 
it's not a style that I was used to but
I<00:02:05.790> think<00:02:05.820> that's<00:02:06.180> that<00:02:06.570> was<00:02:06.750> for<00:02:06.990> me<00:02:07.110> the

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
I think that's that was for me the

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:08.869 
I think that's that was for me the
challenge<00:02:07.409> I<00:02:07.770> took<00:02:07.950> it<00:02:08.039> as<00:02:08.129> a<00:02:08.160> challenge<00:02:08.250> and<00:02:08.819> I

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
challenge I took it as a challenge and I

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.760 
challenge I took it as a challenge and I
just<00:02:09.119> I<00:02:09.390> think<00:02:09.780> we<00:02:09.899> all<00:02:10.140> went<00:02:10.379> for<00:02:10.560> it<00:02:10.649> as<00:02:10.739> a

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
just I think we all went for it as a

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:11.740 
just I think we all went for it as a
team<00:02:11.039> and<00:02:11.250> did<00:02:11.370> the<00:02:11.459> best

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
team and did the best

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.140 
team and did the best
so<00:02:12.320> I'm<00:02:12.740> happy<00:02:12.980> people<00:02:13.370> are<00:02:13.430> liking<00:02:13.610> it<00:02:13.850> but

Katrina<00:03:11.570> couch<00:03:11.750> I'm<00:03:12.590> thinking<00:03:13.040> but<00:03:13.430> now<00:03:13.670> that

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:13.850 
Katrina couch I'm thinking but now that

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:15.759 
Katrina couch I'm thinking but now that
I<00:03:13.880> think<00:03:13.970> about<00:03:14.239> it<00:03:14.480> actually<00:03:14.630> if<00:03:15.110> we<00:03:15.530> had

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:15.769 
I think about it actually if we had

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:18.970 
I think about it actually if we had
these<00:03:16.730> ACS<00:03:17.390> on<00:03:17.540> the<00:03:17.690> sets<00:03:17.959> of<00:03:18.260> when<00:03:18.769> we<00:03:18.860> are

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
these ACS on the sets of when we are

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:20.050 
these ACS on the sets of when we are
shooting<00:03:19.100> in<00:03:19.250> check<00:03:19.430> Nietzsche<00:03:19.670> maybe<00:03:19.850> that

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
shooting in check Nietzsche maybe that

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.220 
shooting in check Nietzsche maybe that
would<00:03:20.209> have<00:03:20.330> helped<00:03:20.600> because<00:03:20.959> it<00:03:21.080> was

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
would have helped because it was

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.979 
would have helped because it was
extremely<00:03:22.040> hot<00:03:22.370> so<00:03:22.640> maybe<00:03:23.150> next<00:03:23.360> time<00:03:23.600> you<00:03:23.840> can

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:23.989 
extremely hot so maybe next time you can

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:26.050 
extremely hot so maybe next time you can
come<00:03:24.200> in<00:03:24.380> you<00:03:24.830> know<00:03:24.860> fix<00:03:25.250> up<00:03:25.430> the<00:03:25.549> set<00:03:25.760> for<00:03:26.000> us

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060
