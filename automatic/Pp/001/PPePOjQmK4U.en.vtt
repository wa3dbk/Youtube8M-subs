no<00:02:23.120> nothing<00:02:23.799> I'm<00:02:24.799> happy<00:02:25.220> with<00:02:25.340> that<00:02:25.519> I<00:02:25.730> think

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.060 
no nothing I'm happy with that I think
it<00:02:26.180> does<00:02:26.359> the<00:02:26.600> ammo<00:02:26.900> justice<00:02:27.380> and<00:02:27.709> it<00:02:27.799> shows

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.070 
it does the ammo justice and it shows

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:30.849 
it does the ammo justice and it shows
what<00:02:28.310> it's<00:02:28.459> actually<00:02:28.790> capable<00:02:29.000> of<00:02:29.419> I<00:02:29.829> want<00:02:30.829> to

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:30.859 
what it's actually capable of I want to

00:02:30.859 --> 00:02:31.600 
what it's actually capable of I want to
go<00:02:30.980> ahead<00:02:31.040> and

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
go ahead and

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:37.760 
shots on the head I want to show you a

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.860 
shots on the head I want to show you a
couple<00:02:38.360> more<00:02:38.720> that<00:02:39.320> I<00:02:39.470> did<00:02:40.120> a<00:02:41.120> standing

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
couple more that I did a standing

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.090 
couple more that I did a standing
position<00:02:42.050> a<00:02:42.850> little<00:02:43.850> bit<00:02:43.970> farther<00:02:44.210> away<00:02:44.360> I<00:02:45.100> was

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
position a little bit farther away I was

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.090 
position a little bit farther away I was
actually<00:02:46.460> aiming<00:02:46.930> at<00:02:47.930> the<00:02:48.140> center<00:02:48.650> of<00:02:48.920> the

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.100 
actually aiming at the center of the

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.730 
actually aiming at the center of the
hand<00:02:49.340> there<00:02:49.580> and<00:02:49.760> I<00:02:50.690> guess<00:02:51.260> I<00:02:51.410> was<00:02:51.500> shooting

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:51.740 
hand there and I guess I was shooting

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.400 
hand there and I guess I was shooting
right<00:02:52.460> obviously<00:02:53.360> I<00:02:53.540> don't<00:02:54.020> know<00:02:54.110> if<00:02:54.230> that's

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
right obviously I don't know if that's

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.470 
right obviously I don't know if that's
his<00:02:54.680> side<00:02:54.980> Center<00:02:55.370> off<00:02:55.550> or<00:02:55.790> four<00:02:55.910> that's<00:02:56.000> me

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
his side Center off or four that's me

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.030 
his side Center off or four that's me
jerking<00:02:56.990> the<00:02:57.110> trigger<00:02:57.350> or<00:02:57.650> whatever<00:02:58.300> but<00:03:00.040> this

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
jerking the trigger or whatever but this

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.220 
jerking the trigger or whatever but this
was<00:03:01.280> a<00:03:01.310> I<00:03:02.030> think<00:03:02.450> this<00:03:02.630> is<00:03:02.750> that<00:03:02.840> like<00:03:02.960> thirty

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
was a I think this is that like thirty

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.510 
was a I think this is that like thirty
five<00:03:03.320> or<00:03:03.470> forty<00:03:03.680> feet<00:03:03.950> away<00:03:04.130> and<00:03:05.800> again<00:03:06.800> we<00:03:07.370> had

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:07.520 
five or forty feet away and again we had

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.990 
five or forty feet away and again we had
one<00:03:07.790> to<00:03:07.940> three<00:03:08.270> shots<00:03:08.540> here<00:03:08.870> one<00:03:09.170> real<00:03:09.560> high

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
one to three shots here one real high

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.270 
one to three shots here one real high
one<00:03:11.000> in<00:03:11.180> the<00:03:11.270> middle<00:03:11.570> one<00:03:11.990> low<00:03:12.230> and<00:03:12.530> this<00:03:13.100> is

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
one in the middle one low and this is

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.210 
one in the middle one low and this is
actually<00:03:13.640> two<00:03:13.880> shots<00:03:14.320> that<00:03:15.320> are<00:03:15.470> touching<00:03:15.709> you

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
actually two shots that are touching you

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.150 
actually two shots that are touching you
guys<00:03:16.400> can<00:03:17.020> make<00:03:18.020> that<00:03:18.230> out<00:03:18.260> see<00:03:18.890> the<00:03:19.010> high

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
guys can make that out see the high

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.430 
guys can make that out see the high
circle<00:03:19.670> and<00:03:19.790> low<00:03:20.000> circle<00:03:20.510> it's<00:03:21.020> actually<00:03:21.260> two

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
circle and low circle it's actually two

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.220

group I'm satisfied with at that

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.560 
group I'm satisfied with at that
distance<00:03:26.590> that<00:03:27.590> would<00:03:28.160> have<00:03:28.280> all<00:03:28.400> been<00:03:28.430> a<00:03:28.940> zone

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:29.570 
distance that would have all been a zone

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:32.650 
distance that would have all been a zone
shots<00:03:29.930> there<00:03:30.740> on<00:03:30.920> the<00:03:31.130> eight<00:03:31.610> inch<00:03:31.850> circle<00:03:32.270> had

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.660 
shots there on the eight inch circle had

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:34.480 
shots there on the eight inch circle had
it<00:03:32.840> been<00:03:32.959> in<00:03:32.990> the<00:03:33.170> middle<00:03:33.440> so<00:03:34.220> I'm<00:03:34.310> pretty

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:34.490

the distance I want to say it was

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:01.630 
the distance I want to say it was
probably<00:03:58.040> about<00:03:58.340> 55<00:03:58.790> 60<00:03:59.360> feet<00:03:59.540> away<00:03:59.660> and<00:04:00.640> I'm

I just tried to throw together to show a
difference<00:04:28.700> in<00:04:29.380> standing<00:04:31.000> unsupported<00:04:32.000> and

00:04:32.219 --> 00:04:32.229 
difference in standing unsupported and

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:34.990 
difference in standing unsupported and
having<00:04:33.229> a<00:04:33.320> support<00:04:33.500> and<00:04:34.160> it<00:04:34.610> didn't<00:04:34.880> really

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:51.470 
again I don't know the distance probably

the target and again that would have all

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.020 
the target and again that would have all

well I do want to get out and get on a

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:07.060 
well I do want to get out and get on a

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:10.250 
real ammo test at 25 yards and see how

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:12.610 
real ammo test at 25 yards and see how
this<00:05:10.430> ammo<00:05:10.760> patterns<00:05:11.180> at<00:05:11.390> that<00:05:11.599> distance<00:05:12.020> I

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:12.620 
this ammo patterns at that distance I

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:15.520 
this ammo patterns at that distance I
don't<00:05:12.950> think<00:05:13.250> it'll<00:05:13.370> have<00:05:13.520> any<00:05:13.789> issues<00:05:14.530> maybe

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:15.530 
don't think it'll have any issues maybe

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:17.170 
don't think it'll have any issues maybe
having<00:05:15.919> a<00:05:16.010> three<00:05:16.220> or<00:05:16.370> four<00:05:16.580> inch<00:05:16.610> group<00:05:17.030> at

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:17.180 
having a three or four inch group at

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:19.990 
having a three or four inch group at
that<00:05:17.210> distance<00:05:17.950> and<00:05:18.950> definitely<00:05:19.789> at<00:05:19.910> the

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:20.000 
that distance and definitely at the

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.080 
that distance and definitely at the
distances<00:05:20.479> I<00:05:20.539> shot<00:05:20.930> on<00:05:21.140> this<00:05:21.710> target<00:05:22.190> it<00:05:22.700> could

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:23.090 
distances I shot on this target it could

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:25.930 
distances I shot on this target it could
have<00:05:23.210> been<00:05:23.390> better<00:05:23.830> but<00:05:24.830> this<00:05:25.310> is<00:05:25.460> also<00:05:25.640> me

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:25.940 
have been better but this is also me

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:27.310 
have been better but this is also me
pulling<00:05:26.150> the<00:05:26.270> trigger<00:05:26.599> and<00:05:26.870> I'm<00:05:27.110> not<00:05:27.289> a

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:27.320 
pulling the trigger and I'm not a

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:31.719 
pulling the trigger and I'm not a
perfect<00:05:27.770> shot<00:05:28.419> so<00:05:30.010> all<00:05:31.010> in<00:05:31.160> all<00:05:31.280> this<00:05:31.490> ammo

00:05:31.719 --> 00:05:31.729 
perfect shot so all in all this ammo

00:05:31.729 --> 00:05:34.180 
perfect shot so all in all this ammo
performs<00:05:32.270> very<00:05:32.479> well<00:05:32.570> and<00:05:33.140> I<00:05:33.650> think<00:05:33.680> that<00:05:33.979> you

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:34.190 
performs very well and I think that you

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:35.710 
performs very well and I think that you
can<00:05:34.310> do<00:05:34.400> a<00:05:34.430> lot<00:05:34.700> worse<00:05:35.000> for<00:05:35.030> the<00:05:35.479> price<00:05:35.690> that

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:35.720 
can do a lot worse for the price that

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:37.480 
can do a lot worse for the price that
you<00:05:35.930> pay<00:05:36.020> for<00:05:36.440> it<00:05:36.560> you<00:05:36.680> can<00:05:36.830> do<00:05:36.919> a<00:05:36.950> lot<00:05:37.220> worse

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:37.490 
you pay for it you can do a lot worse

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:39.130 
you pay for it you can do a lot worse

an M&amp;P

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:00.159 
an M&amp;P
but<00:05:58.400> I<00:05:58.430> do<00:05:58.580> believe<00:05:58.849> that<00:05:59.060> that<00:05:59.240> was<00:05:59.570> a<00:05:59.630> weak

00:06:00.159 --> 00:06:00.169 
but I do believe that that was a weak

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:02.050 
but I do believe that that was a weak
firing<00:06:00.890> pin<00:06:01.070> spring<00:06:01.220> and<00:06:01.610> all<00:06:01.700> that<00:06:01.849> type<00:06:02.030> of

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:04.640 
stuff that that they have a weak striker

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:07.180 
stuff that that they have a weak striker
spring<00:06:05.030> I<00:06:05.150> should<00:06:05.300> say<00:06:05.680> that<00:06:06.680> they<00:06:06.830> had<00:06:06.979> going

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:07.190 
spring I should say that they had going
