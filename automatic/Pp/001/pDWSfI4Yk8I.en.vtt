00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:06.240
 hello we end up in this video 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:10.110
 for a new creation in fimo air 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.849
 lines so I made a few 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.000
 and I'll introduce them to you all 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:24.529
 suite so I made two forms in tiff 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:24.529
 chamallow this is the first 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:33.600
 so it's the same marshmallows 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:40.200
 I just put a little bit of a 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:42.450
 small number of receipts then I have a 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.629
 small scared keychain chamallows 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:49.969
 always so with the little pearls 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.969
 that reminds the color and a funny fold 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.750
 then I made little cats 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:01:01.980
 sick like that that I ride in code 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:04.710
 orange so then I actually did 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.030
 a cake dough is fimo 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:11.340
 highlight language I simply 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:14.549
 to lie down a brown painting with and that 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:18.840
 actually gives super realistic no for 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:22.799
 to show you I did a whole series 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:25.880
 small pendants like this so this 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.880
 horse support theme 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:35.369
 and it's super light know it's great 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.140
 here and I find it can really 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.409
 really really realistic 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:46.170
 so I'm doing them in black and white with 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:48.240
 a little stress on the hat 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.630
 rhinois always the little stress on the 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.630
 hat 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:02:05.710
 black and red that stresses Japan and 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:09.220
 white and red always the little stress 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:11.620
 So here's the game it's really 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:14.290
 realistic and more here are some 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.030
 small cracks that really gives 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.239
 still indeed a little bit more 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:23.620
 realistic 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:26.590
 I love it so I thought 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.180
 it worked the slopes of the slopes I 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.519
 guess that enough to work with 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.680
 the cupcakes and so I did some 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:37.000
 small so what is with all the 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:40.120
 couples of the final then have to know 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:45.730
 so I weighed with the same base of 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:48.400
 mussels the same whipped cream in cupcakes 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:52.930
 makes a normal film drop of 23 grams 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:56.800
 and a cupcake made by filming airlines 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:58.959
 weighs Wigram world there's still this 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:01.780
 really super light comfortable to wear 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:09.549
 I have one for now it weighs 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:14.829
 absolutely nothing is great so that's it 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:17.980
 here the base and pastel orange so here 

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:23.609
 everything is done in a smoking room and therefore 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:26.590
 the base cake and whipped cream 

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:29.910
 which made by filming arlette to 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.910
 from the can they are 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:36.250
 I did this one orange salon 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:04:00.010
 so I made a pastel yellow flavors 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:04:10.490
 mother grapefruit pastel glass of water 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:15.230
 lime and one I therefore door 

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:19.600
 its orange flavors also here I have 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:22.580
 go around the base with the novel 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:25.960
 as the super light says it's nice 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:32.570
 to wear it's great 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:36.520
 and so I also tried to make a 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:40.090
 early childhood street like these so 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.090
 it's a study 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:48.580
 so in fact two I had done in 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:52.850
 white and I came with makeup 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:57.380
 or to actually have a little 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:05:02.170
 little pearly and so I tried the vanni 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:05.270
 I guess it's going to work 

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:09.800
 I will tell you that some time a 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:13.150
 next video to tell you if it has 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:13.150
 not spoiled the creation 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:27.789
 so frankly I love the filmo 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:34.210
 highlight it's nice to work 

00:05:27.789 --> 00:05:35.219
 it's nice to touch it's the only one 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:40.240
 snag 

00:05:35.219 --> 00:05:41.889
 yeah that's just the colors 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:44.199
 do not hang together so one objects 

00:05:41.889 --> 00:05:47.409
 of all glued separately so they 

00:05:44.199 --> 00:05:51.840
 were forced to stick the cake to the 

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:54.009
 base to paste the cake whipped cream 

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:57.159
 that's because it does not hang at all 

00:05:54.009 --> 00:06:01.479
 set of objects glued together 

00:05:57.159 --> 00:06:05.110
 it's really the only little problem that I 

00:06:01.479 --> 00:06:06.490
 could read if you do not 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:08.610
 can do as many colors as we 

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:13.000
 wish 

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:18.339
 this is the effect of the cupcake is right and 

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:19.810
 just realistic to chantilly also when 

00:06:18.339 --> 00:06:22.150
 I went out with this one today 

00:06:19.810 --> 00:06:24.389
 and there are guys from people who would 

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:31.270
 say at best in D it's great 

00:06:24.389 --> 00:06:33.879
 so here is I hope that my 

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:37.529
 creations you liked and I tell you to 

00:06:33.879 --> 00:06:37.529
 soon ask for a next video
