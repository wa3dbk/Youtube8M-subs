00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
those are ddr3 2000 kits 2 by 2 gig so

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.760 
those are ddr3 2000 kits 2 by 2 gig so
these<00:00:38.940> are<00:00:39.149> a<00:00:39.180> 2<00:00:39.390> by<00:00:39.540> 4<00:00:39.570> gig<00:00:40.079> kit<00:00:40.290> so<00:00:40.469> they'll<00:00:40.620> be
