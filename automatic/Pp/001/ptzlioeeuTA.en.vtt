for today I'm going to show you a quick

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:04.970 
for today I'm going to show you a quick
trick<00:00:03.149> to<00:00:03.510> increase<00:00:03.990> your<00:00:04.380> throttle<00:00:04.859> response

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
trick to increase your throttle response

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.379 
trick to increase your throttle response
it<00:00:05.819> can<00:00:06.089> be<00:00:06.240> applied<00:00:06.569> to<00:00:07.460> many<00:00:08.460> many<00:00:08.820> vehicles

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
it can be applied to many many vehicles

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.270 
it can be applied to many many vehicles
that<00:00:09.660> have<00:00:09.809> a<00:00:09.840> throttle<00:00:10.170> cable<00:00:10.710> if<00:00:10.950> you<00:00:11.010> got<00:00:11.250> a

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
that have a throttle cable if you got a

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.810 
that have a throttle cable if you got a
little<00:00:11.759> electric<00:00:12.450> wire<00:00:12.690> connecting<00:00:13.320> your<00:00:13.820> gas

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
little electric wire connecting your gas

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.640 
little electric wire connecting your gas
pedal<00:00:15.089> to<00:00:15.389> the<00:00:15.540> throttle<00:00:15.960> body<00:00:16.109> then<00:00:16.379> you

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
pedal to the throttle body then you

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.640 
pedal to the throttle body then you
really<00:00:16.890> can't<00:00:17.100> do<00:00:17.250> this<00:00:17.460> at<00:00:17.609> all<00:00:18.650> this

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
really can't do this at all this

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.460 
really can't do this at all this
modification<00:00:20.210> will<00:00:21.210> include<00:00:21.539> zip<00:00:21.840> ties

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
modification will include zip ties

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.679 
modification will include zip ties
get<00:00:23.279> a<00:00:23.310> couple<00:00:23.699> of<00:00:23.789> them<00:00:23.939> or<00:00:24.090> whatever<00:00:24.269> on

thing<00:00:24.930> we're<00:00:25.050> gonna<00:00:25.140> need<00:00:25.260> more<00:00:25.410> than<00:00:25.470> two

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
thing we're gonna need more than two

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.450 
thing we're gonna need more than two
though<00:00:27.050> and<00:00:28.050> I'll<00:00:28.800> show<00:00:28.980> you<00:00:29.039> what<00:00:29.220> needs<00:00:29.429> to

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
though and I'll show you what needs to

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:30.950 
though and I'll show you what needs to
be<00:00:29.550> done<00:00:29.670> I'm<00:00:30.179> going<00:00:30.300> to<00:00:30.390> be<00:00:30.449> demonstrating

be done I'm going to be demonstrating

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.910 
be done I'm going to be demonstrating
this<00:00:31.050> on<00:00:31.199> a<00:00:31.260> Ford<00:00:31.560> Ranger<00:00:31.740> and<00:00:33.290> well<00:00:34.290> first<00:00:34.770> of

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
this on a Ford Ranger and well first of

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.520 
this on a Ford Ranger and well first of
all<00:00:34.980> I<00:00:35.070> gotta<00:00:35.250> move<00:00:35.399> this<00:00:36.380> plastic<00:00:37.380> cover

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
all I gotta move this plastic cover

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:38.750 
all I gotta move this plastic cover
because<00:00:37.800> it's<00:00:38.040> gonna<00:00:38.160> make<00:00:38.250> it<00:00:38.460> a<00:00:38.520> whole<00:00:38.730> lot

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
because it's gonna make it a whole lot

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.850 
because it's gonna make it a whole lot
easier<00:00:38.969> if<00:00:39.570> I<00:00:39.690> do<00:00:42.170> those<00:00:43.170> it<00:00:43.379> comes<00:00:43.530> out<00:00:43.680> to

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
easier if I do those it comes out to

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.700 
easier if I do those it comes out to
find<00:00:44.629> don't<00:00:45.629> need<00:00:45.750> to<00:00:45.809> move<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.170> plastic<00:00:46.379> pins

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
find don't need to move the plastic pins

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:47.869 
find don't need to move the plastic pins
because<00:00:46.860> they're<00:00:47.070> just<00:00:47.250> going<00:00:47.610> to<00:00:47.700> be<00:00:47.789> another

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
because they're just going to be another

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.139 
because they're just going to be another
piece<00:00:48.270> right<00:00:48.420> there<00:00:48.719> and<00:00:49.309> whole<00:00:50.309> point<00:00:50.640> is<00:00:50.789> not

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
piece right there and whole point is not

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.200 
piece right there and whole point is not
to<00:00:51.390> be<00:00:52.379> difficult<00:00:52.920> to<00:00:52.980> do<00:00:53.160> at<00:00:53.370> all<00:00:53.520> so<00:00:53.879> I'm<00:00:54.000> not

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
to be difficult to do at all so I'm not

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.639 
to be difficult to do at all so I'm not
going<00:00:54.390> to<00:00:54.449> take<00:00:54.600> apart<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:54.960> -<00:00:55.199> get<00:00:55.530> it

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
going to take apart the - get it

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.369 
going to take apart the - get it
something<00:00:55.860> simple<00:00:56.100> so<00:00:56.809> I'll<00:00:57.809> pop<00:00:57.989> this<00:00:58.170> back

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
something simple so I'll pop this back

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.680 
something simple so I'll pop this back
on<00:00:58.590> and<00:00:58.620> then<00:00:59.010> I'll<00:00:59.160> just<00:00:59.460> crawl<00:01:00.329> under<00:01:00.570> there

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
on and then I'll just crawl under there

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.740 
on and then I'll just crawl under there
and<00:01:00.840> show<00:01:00.960> you<00:01:01.020> you<00:01:01.910> know<00:01:02.910> sorta<00:01:03.270> point<00:01:03.600> this

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
and show you you know sorta point this

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:10.250 
and show you you know sorta point this
whole<00:01:03.899> video<00:01:04.610> get<00:01:05.610> light<00:01:05.820> on<00:01:07.820> shoot

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
whole video get light on shoot

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.430 
whole video get light on shoot
okay<00:01:11.619> you<00:01:11.979> see<00:01:12.130> gas<00:01:12.340> pedal<00:01:12.760> followed<00:01:13.210> up<00:01:13.409> okay

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:14.440 
okay you see gas pedal followed up okay

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.010 
okay you see gas pedal followed up okay
there's<00:01:14.799> a<00:01:14.890> spring<00:01:15.540> now<00:01:16.540> with<00:01:16.690> this<00:01:16.810> mod<00:01:16.990> does

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020 
there's a spring now with this mod does

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.890 
there's a spring now with this mod does
is<00:01:17.500> you<00:01:17.650> pull<00:01:17.950> back<00:01:18.159> the<00:01:18.310> spring<00:01:18.610> and<00:01:19.600> you<00:01:19.720> put

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:19.900 
is you pull back the spring and you put

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.539 
is you pull back the spring and you put
a<00:01:19.930> bunch<00:01:20.080> of<00:01:20.229> zip<00:01:20.470> ties<00:01:20.680> in<00:01:20.950> now<00:01:21.100> what<00:01:21.400> this

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:21.549 
a bunch of zip ties in now what this

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:23.850 
a bunch of zip ties in now what this
does<00:01:21.759> is<00:01:21.880> it<00:01:22.000> tightens<00:01:22.330> up<00:01:22.390> the<00:01:22.450> spring<00:01:22.900> which

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:23.860 
does is it tightens up the spring which

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:25.680 
does is it tightens up the spring which
reduces<00:01:24.310> all<00:01:24.490> slack<00:01:24.820> in<00:01:25.060> the<00:01:25.150> throttle<00:01:25.360> cable

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:25.690 
reduces all slack in the throttle cable

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:28.230 
reduces all slack in the throttle cable
and<00:01:26.110> we<00:01:26.800> do<00:01:26.950> slack<00:01:27.250> will<00:01:27.520> end<00:01:27.790> up<00:01:27.909> to<00:01:28.060> better

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.240 
and we do slack will end up to better

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.960 
and we do slack will end up to better
throttle<00:01:28.509> response<00:01:29.159> it's<00:01:30.159> pretty<00:01:30.369> simple<00:01:30.880> the

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:30.970 
throttle response it's pretty simple the

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.719 
throttle response it's pretty simple the
only<00:01:31.060> hard<00:01:31.450> part<00:01:31.509> would<00:01:31.840> be<00:01:32.490> reaching<00:01:33.490> up

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:33.729 
only hard part would be reaching up

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:35.070 
only hard part would be reaching up
there<00:01:33.940> and<00:01:34.090> trying<00:01:34.330> to<00:01:34.450> figure<00:01:34.869> out

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.080 
there and trying to figure out

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.270 
there and trying to figure out
everything<00:01:35.170> by<00:01:35.500> hand<00:01:35.740> because<00:01:35.920> there's

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 
everything by hand because there's

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.160 
everything by hand because there's
really<00:01:36.399> not<00:01:36.580> much<00:01:36.729> room<00:01:36.880> to<00:01:36.940> work<00:01:37.060> with<00:01:37.330> some

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
really not much room to work with some

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.260 
really not much room to work with some
cars<00:01:38.409> might<00:01:38.590> be<00:01:38.710> different<00:01:39.130> so<00:01:39.369> but<00:01:40.030> that's

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
cars might be different so but that's

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:49.969 
cars might be different so but that's
really<00:01:40.930> the<00:01:41.049> whole<00:01:41.200> mod<00:01:41.440> right<00:01:41.680> there

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.840 

there's<00:01:50.979> your<00:01:51.190> room<00:01:51.369> right<00:01:51.580> there

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 
there's your room right there

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.590 
there's your room right there
I<00:01:52.500> put<00:01:53.500> zip<00:01:53.710> ties<00:01:53.920> right<00:01:54.369> in<00:01:55.179> the<00:01:55.270> middle<00:01:55.509> at

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:55.600 
I put zip ties right in the middle at

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.919 
I put zip ties right in the middle at
screen<00:01:55.869> so<00:01:56.050> you<00:01:56.140> space<00:01:56.970> have<00:01:57.970> to<00:01:58.270> reuse<00:01:58.360> it<00:01:58.600> as

00:01:58.919 --> 00:01:58.929 
screen so you space have to reuse it as

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:07.940 
screen so you space have to reuse it as
we<00:01:59.050> go<00:02:00.149> and<00:02:01.149> that<00:02:01.210> would<00:02:01.690> be<00:02:01.780> the<00:02:01.899> mod<00:02:02.080> oh

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.830 

there's<00:02:08.950> the<00:02:09.220> mod<00:02:09.429> in<00:02:09.700> action<00:02:10.149> right<00:02:10.330> there

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
there's the mod in action right there

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.470 
there's the mod in action right there
