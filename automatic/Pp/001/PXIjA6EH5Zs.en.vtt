00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.499 
which of course relates back to that's a
very<00:01:49.110> common<00:01:49.759> technique<00:01:50.759> I<00:01:51.149> guess<00:01:51.299> we<00:01:51.420> could

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
very common technique I guess we could

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.389 
very common technique I guess we could
say<00:01:51.689> in<00:01:51.869> realism<00:01:52.619> if<00:01:52.740> we<00:01:52.829> look<00:01:52.979> at<00:01:53.100> paintings

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
say in realism if we look at paintings

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.460 
say in realism if we look at paintings
like<00:01:53.579> Gustave<00:01:53.939> Courbet<00:01:54.329> is<00:01:54.390> a<00:01:54.600> burial<00:01:55.200> at<00:01:55.350> our

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
like Gustave Courbet is a burial at our

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.859 
like Gustave Courbet is a burial at our
nons<00:01:55.649> it's<00:01:55.920> a<00:01:55.950> very<00:01:56.159> large<00:01:56.520> painting<00:01:56.939> of<00:01:57.270> of<00:01:57.719> a

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
nons it's a very large painting of of a

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.899 
nons it's a very large painting of of a
funeral<00:01:58.350> which<00:01:58.500> is<00:01:58.649> very<00:01:59.040> unusual<00:01:59.579> at<00:01:59.729> least

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
funeral which is very unusual at least

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.600 
funeral which is very unusual at least
it<00:02:00.090> was<00:02:00.240> at<00:02:00.420> that<00:02:00.450> time<00:02:01.130> but<00:02:02.130> it's<00:02:02.310> also<00:02:02.460> I

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
it was at that time but it's also I

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.580 
it was at that time but it's also I
think<00:02:02.729> in<00:02:03.119> some<00:02:03.570> ways<00:02:03.719> is<00:02:03.930> meant<00:02:04.140> to<00:02:04.229> say<00:02:04.380> that

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
think in some ways is meant to say that

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.340 
think in some ways is meant to say that
men<00:02:04.770> a<00:02:04.969> really<00:02:05.969> wanted<00:02:06.270> to<00:02:06.420> be<00:02:06.540> associated

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
men a really wanted to be associated

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.109 
men a really wanted to be associated
with<00:02:07.469> this<00:02:07.710> particular<00:02:08.069> painting<00:02:08.580> he<00:02:08.879> wanted

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
with this particular painting he wanted

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.029 
with this particular painting he wanted
to<00:02:09.179> be<00:02:09.300> remembered<00:02:09.720> for<00:02:09.959> this<00:02:10.560> and<00:02:10.770> that's<00:02:10.890> why

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
to be remembered for this and that's why

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.860 
to be remembered for this and that's why
he<00:02:11.129> made<00:02:11.250> it<00:02:11.400> such<00:02:11.670> a<00:02:11.700> large<00:02:12.030> canvas

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
he made it such a large canvas

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.509 
he made it such a large canvas
let's<00:02:13.290> talk<00:02:13.530> first<00:02:13.890> we're<00:02:14.220> going<00:02:14.340> to<00:02:14.400> talk

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:14.519 
let's talk first we're going to talk

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:16.280 
let's talk first we're going to talk
some<00:02:14.670> similarities<00:02:15.300> between<00:02:15.450> between<00:02:16.110> the

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
some similarities between between the

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.250 
some similarities between between the
Goya<00:02:16.560> and<00:02:16.680> this<00:02:16.830> men<00:02:17.069> a<00:02:17.250> I<00:02:17.489> think<00:02:18.330> both<00:02:18.720> artists

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
Goya and this men a I think both artists

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.150 
Goya and this men a I think both artists
really<00:02:19.920> attempted<00:02:20.700> to<00:02:20.790> step<00:02:21.060> outside<00:02:21.239> of<00:02:21.540> the

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
really attempted to step outside of the

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.710 
really attempted to step outside of the
kind<00:02:23.160> of<00:02:23.250> ambass<00:02:23.849> decor<00:02:24.239> the<00:02:24.330> Papas

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
kind of ambass decor the Papas

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:25.610 
kind of ambass decor the Papas
boundaries<00:02:25.140> that<00:02:25.260> have<00:02:25.319> been<00:02:25.410> established

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
boundaries that have been established

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.220 
boundaries that have been established
for<00:02:26.160> the<00:02:26.280> genre<00:02:26.310> of<00:02:26.819> history<00:02:27.660> painting<00:02:27.900> and

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
for the genre of history painting and

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:29.270 
for the genre of history painting and
we've<00:02:28.319> talked<00:02:28.530> about<00:02:28.650> what<00:02:28.920> that<00:02:29.040> means

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
we've talked about what that means

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.610 
we've talked about what that means
before<00:02:29.760> and<00:02:30.030> in<00:02:30.510> that<00:02:30.660> sense<00:02:30.930> this<00:02:31.140> is<00:02:31.200> really

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
before and in that sense this is really

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.640 
before and in that sense this is really
I<00:02:32.000> was<00:02:33.000> saying<00:02:33.209> before<00:02:33.299> that<00:02:33.540> the<00:02:33.810> men<00:02:34.019> a<00:02:34.170> was<00:02:34.410> a

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
I was saying before that the men a was a

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.070 
I was saying before that the men a was a
realist<00:02:35.099> and<00:02:35.400> that's<00:02:36.239> definitely<00:02:36.450> depicted

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
realist and that's definitely depicted

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.780 
realist and that's definitely depicted
here<00:02:37.290> in<00:02:37.410> terms<00:02:37.620> of<00:02:37.830> the<00:02:37.980> the<00:02:38.160> subject<00:02:38.400> matter

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
here in terms of the the subject matter

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.000 
here in terms of the the subject matter
that<00:02:38.910> is<00:02:39.299> being<00:02:39.569> treated<00:02:39.810> and<00:02:40.110> in<00:02:40.650> that<00:02:40.769> sense

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
that is being treated and in that sense

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.930 
that is being treated and in that sense
this<00:02:41.190> is<00:02:41.340> really<00:02:41.580> a<00:02:41.610> piece<00:02:41.879> of<00:02:42.150> modern<00:02:42.900> artwork

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
this is really a piece of modern artwork

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.870 
this is really a piece of modern artwork
we<00:02:44.940> have<00:02:45.030> a<00:02:45.090> very<00:02:45.269> similar<00:02:45.569> geometric<00:02:45.900> motif

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
we have a very similar geometric motif

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.839 
we have a very similar geometric motif
here<00:02:47.880> that<00:02:48.090> we<00:02:48.599> also<00:02:49.010> noticed<00:02:50.010> in<00:02:50.190> in<00:02:50.459> the<00:02:50.610> Goya

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:50.849 
here that we also noticed in in the Goya

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:54.170 
here that we also noticed in in the Goya
the<00:02:51.799> right<00:02:52.799> angles<00:02:53.250> that<00:02:53.579> are<00:02:53.640> formed<00:02:54.030> between

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
the right angles that are formed between

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.410 
the right angles that are formed between
the<00:02:54.690> soldiers<00:02:54.959> rifles<00:02:55.739> and<00:02:55.950> their<00:02:56.819> swords<00:02:57.150> and

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
the soldiers rifles and their swords and

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.630 
the soldiers rifles and their swords and
that's<00:02:58.049> repeated<00:02:58.560> over<00:02:58.769> and<00:02:58.920> over<00:02:59.069> again<00:02:59.220> it

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
that's repeated over and over again it

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.610 
that's repeated over and over again it
provides<00:02:59.940> a<00:03:00.030> sort<00:03:00.239> of<00:03:00.329> structural<00:03:02.450> theme<00:03:03.620> into

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
provides a sort of structural theme into

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.089 
provides a sort of structural theme into
the<00:03:04.709> painting<00:03:06.019> the<00:03:07.019> soldiers<00:03:07.500> once<00:03:07.739> again<00:03:07.980> of

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:08.099 
the painting the soldiers once again of

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:09.589 
the painting the soldiers once again of
course<00:03:08.310> have<00:03:08.610> their<00:03:08.790> backs<00:03:09.000> to<00:03:09.239> the<00:03:09.299> viewers

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:09.599 
course have their backs to the viewers

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:11.150 
course have their backs to the viewers
as<00:03:09.750> well<00:03:09.780> so<00:03:10.200> that<00:03:10.319> was<00:03:10.440> definitely<00:03:10.560> something

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
as well so that was definitely something

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.809 
as well so that was definitely something
that<00:03:11.190> was<00:03:11.459> borrowed<00:03:12.329> from<00:03:12.360> from<00:03:13.079> Goya

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:13.819 
that was borrowed from from Goya

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:17.000 
that was borrowed from from Goya
one<00:03:14.819> thing<00:03:15.000> that<00:03:15.150> is<00:03:15.390> immediately<00:03:16.010> noticeable

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
one thing that is immediately noticeable

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:18.650 
one thing that is immediately noticeable
though<00:03:17.280> that's<00:03:17.519> it's<00:03:18.060> quite<00:03:18.269> different<00:03:18.450> from

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
though that's it's quite different from

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.840 
though that's it's quite different from
Goya<00:03:18.930> is<00:03:19.200> that<00:03:19.799> the<00:03:19.889> canvas<00:03:20.100> is<00:03:20.400> a<00:03:20.430> lot<00:03:20.639> more

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
Goya is that the canvas is a lot more

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:23.210 
Goya is that the canvas is a lot more
subtle<00:03:21.180> the<00:03:22.049> the<00:03:22.410> colors<00:03:22.739> here<00:03:22.980> are<00:03:23.100> much

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
subtle the the colors here are much

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.340 
subtle the the colors here are much
cooler<00:03:23.489> we<00:03:23.819> see<00:03:23.970> a<00:03:24.000> lot<00:03:24.180> more<00:03:24.209> blues<00:03:24.690> and<00:03:25.079> grays

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
cooler we see a lot more blues and grays

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:28.339 
cooler we see a lot more blues and grays
and<00:03:25.739> less<00:03:26.220> of<00:03:26.370> the<00:03:26.660> the<00:03:27.660> Reds<00:03:27.959> and<00:03:28.230> the<00:03:28.319> yellows

00:03:28.339 --> 00:03:28.349 
and less of the the Reds and the yellows

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:30.800 
and less of the the Reds and the yellows
the<00:03:28.829> kind<00:03:29.010> of<00:03:29.099> heat<00:03:29.430> that<00:03:29.459> we<00:03:30.000> would<00:03:30.150> find<00:03:30.420> in

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
the kind of heat that we would find in

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.190 
the kind of heat that we would find in
in<00:03:31.109> Goya's<00:03:31.500> romanticism<00:03:32.370> and<00:03:33.200> there's

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
in Goya's romanticism and there's

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.039 
in Goya's romanticism and there's
definitely<00:03:34.319> a<00:03:34.620> sort<00:03:34.889> of<00:03:34.980> detachment<00:03:35.400> here<00:03:36.049> if

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
definitely a sort of detachment here if

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:39.170 
definitely a sort of detachment here if
we<00:03:37.680> look<00:03:37.889> at<00:03:37.980> the<00:03:38.099> positioning<00:03:38.700> of<00:03:38.880> the

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
we look at the positioning of the

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.280 
we look at the positioning of the
soldiers<00:03:39.599> feet<00:03:39.900> very<00:03:40.530> different<00:03:41.069> from<00:03:41.220> Goya's

the<00:03:43.290> stance<00:03:44.280> here<00:03:44.579> is<00:03:44.700> a<00:03:44.730> lot<00:03:44.970> more

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
the stance here is a lot more

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.690 
the stance here is a lot more
matter-of-fact<00:03:45.739> much<00:03:46.739> it's<00:03:47.130> much<00:03:47.310> less<00:03:47.459> of<00:03:47.519> an

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
matter-of-fact much it's much less of an

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:51.020 
matter-of-fact much it's much less of an
aggressive<00:03:48.030> pose<00:03:48.620> than<00:03:49.620> the<00:03:50.130> the<00:03:50.579> positioning

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
aggressive pose than the the positioning

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.120 
aggressive pose than the the positioning
of<00:03:51.180> the<00:03:51.269> soldiers<00:03:51.599> that<00:03:51.630> we<00:03:51.840> saw<00:03:52.019> in<00:03:52.230> Goya<00:03:52.500> keep

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
of the soldiers that we saw in Goya keep

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:54.740 
of the soldiers that we saw in Goya keep
in<00:03:53.220> mind<00:03:53.400> too<00:03:53.579> that<00:03:53.609> this<00:03:53.849> firing<00:03:54.299> squad<00:03:54.599> is

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
in mind too that this firing squad is

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.680 
in mind too that this firing squad is
made<00:03:54.959> up<00:03:55.109> of<00:03:55.290> Mexican<00:03:56.220> soldiers<00:03:56.639> not<00:03:56.819> the

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
made up of Mexican soldiers not the

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.349 
made up of Mexican soldiers not the
French<00:03:57.989> like<00:03:58.380> in<00:03:58.680> in<00:03:59.250> Goya's<00:04:00.120> painting

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:00.359 
French like in in Goya's painting

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:01.729 
French like in in Goya's painting
although<00:04:00.660> the<00:04:00.810> French<00:04:01.019> were<00:04:01.169> implicated<00:04:01.650> of

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
although the French were implicated of

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:04.190 
although the French were implicated of
course<00:04:01.919> in<00:04:02.099> both<00:04:02.220> in<00:04:03.120> both<00:04:03.200> historical

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
course in both in both historical

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.349 
course in both in both historical
instances<00:04:04.730> we're<00:04:05.730> also<00:04:05.910> looking<00:04:06.090> at<00:04:06.269> a

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:06.359 
instances we're also looking at a

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:07.729 
instances we're also looking at a
different<00:04:06.660> moment<00:04:06.780> in<00:04:06.989> time<00:04:07.260> here<00:04:07.530> than<00:04:07.650> we

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:07.739 
different moment in time here than we

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:09.319 
different moment in time here than we
were<00:04:07.859> on<00:04:07.889> goiás<00:04:08.310> paintings<00:04:08.730> so<00:04:08.849> this<00:04:09.000> is<00:04:09.090> after

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:09.329 
were on goiás paintings so this is after

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:11.300 
were on goiás paintings so this is after
the<00:04:09.660> soldiers<00:04:10.019> have<00:04:10.169> already<00:04:10.230> fired<00:04:10.769> we<00:04:11.160> can

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
the soldiers have already fired we can

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:13.550 
the soldiers have already fired we can
see<00:04:11.459> the<00:04:11.579> smoke<00:04:11.880> here<00:04:12.239> from<00:04:12.780> their<00:04:12.930> rifles<00:04:13.349> and

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
see the smoke here from their rifles and

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.259 
see the smoke here from their rifles and
what<00:04:13.919> I<00:04:13.950> really<00:04:14.280> love<00:04:14.459> is<00:04:14.489> that<00:04:14.609> MANET<00:04:15.060> has

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269 
what I really love is that MANET has

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:16.670 
what I really love is that MANET has
painted<00:04:15.720> these<00:04:15.840> three<00:04:16.200> men<00:04:16.410> this<00:04:16.620> is

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
painted these three men this is

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.680 
painted these three men this is
Maximilian<00:04:17.669> right<00:04:17.820> here<00:04:18.000> in<00:04:18.150> the<00:04:18.239> center<00:04:18.539> and

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
Maximilian right here in the center and

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:20.899 
Maximilian right here in the center and
two<00:04:18.750> of<00:04:19.440> his<00:04:19.530> generals<00:04:19.979> they<00:04:20.489> all<00:04:20.669> have

00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:20.909 
two of his generals they all have

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:22.940 
two of his generals they all have
different<00:04:20.940> facial<00:04:21.539> expressions<00:04:21.780> and<00:04:22.349> this

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950 
different facial expressions and this

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:25.159 
different facial expressions and this
person<00:04:23.669> seems<00:04:23.880> to<00:04:24.000> be<00:04:24.060> the<00:04:24.150> only<00:04:24.300> one<00:04:24.930> who<00:04:25.050> was

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:25.169 
person seems to be the only one who was

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:26.210 
person seems to be the only one who was
actually<00:04:25.320> hit

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
actually hit

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:30.530 
actually hit
and<00:04:27.380> also<00:04:28.380> notice<00:04:29.040> that<00:04:29.670> they're<00:04:29.880> all<00:04:29.910> holding

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:30.540 
and also notice that they're all holding

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:33.880 
and also notice that they're all holding
hands<00:04:30.980> which<00:04:31.980> I<00:04:32.100> think<00:04:32.310> has<00:04:32.430> a<00:04:32.460> very<00:04:32.790> kind<00:04:33.180> of<00:04:33.300> a

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:33.890 
hands which I think has a very kind of a

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:36.020 
hands which I think has a very kind of a
somber<00:04:34.890> tone<00:04:35.130> to<00:04:35.400> the<00:04:35.520> painting<00:04:35.850> that<00:04:35.880> we

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
somber tone to the painting that we

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:39.200 
somber tone to the painting that we
don't<00:04:36.210> get<00:04:36.420> in<00:04:36.990> in<00:04:37.350> Goya's<00:04:37.800> we<00:04:38.550> also<00:04:38.730> have<00:04:38.970> this

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.210 
don't get in in Goya's we also have this

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:43.280 
don't get in in Goya's we also have this
large<00:04:39.660> wall<00:04:40.140> here<00:04:41.510> which<00:04:42.510> is<00:04:42.870> the<00:04:42.960> device

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:43.290 
large wall here which is the device

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:45.530 
large wall here which is the device
that's<00:04:43.530> similar<00:04:44.070> to<00:04:44.280> that<00:04:44.460> that<00:04:45.030> was<00:04:45.150> used<00:04:45.360> in

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:45.540 
that's similar to that that was used in

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:48.260 
that's similar to that that was used in
Goya's<00:04:46.080> the<00:04:46.740> kind<00:04:46.920> of<00:04:47.040> I<00:04:47.280> guess<00:04:47.820> we<00:04:48.030> could<00:04:48.120> say

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
Goya's the kind of I guess we could say

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.630 
Goya's the kind of I guess we could say
stage<00:04:48.630> the<00:04:49.140> scene<00:04:49.410> in<00:04:49.590> a<00:04:49.680> sense<00:04:49.980> the

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:50.640 
stage the scene in a sense the

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:53.240 
stage the scene in a sense the
background<00:04:51.120> as<00:04:51.270> well<00:04:51.300> is<00:04:52.100> relying<00:04:53.100> on

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:53.250 
background as well is relying on

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:54.710 
background as well is relying on
atmospheric<00:04:53.850> perspective<00:04:53.970> particularly

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 
atmospheric perspective particularly

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.260 
atmospheric perspective particularly
right<00:04:55.170> here<00:04:55.410> to<00:04:55.530> try<00:04:55.680> to<00:04:55.710> establish<00:04:56.270> distance

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:57.270 
right here to try to establish distance

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:59.330 
right here to try to establish distance
which<00:04:57.870> is<00:04:57.900> something<00:04:58.200> we<00:04:58.410> also<00:04:58.560> saw<00:04:58.920> in<00:04:58.950> in

00:04:59.330 --> 00:04:59.340 
which is something we also saw in in

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.820 
which is something we also saw in in
Koya<00:04:59.640> but<00:05:00.480> my<00:05:01.080> name's<00:05:01.290> background<00:05:01.710> it's

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830 
Koya but my name's background it's

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:03.500 
Koya but my name's background it's
definitely<00:05:02.310> characteristically<00:05:03.210> a<00:05:03.240> much

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:03.510 
definitely characteristically a much

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:04.910 
definitely characteristically a much
more<00:05:03.690> impressionist<00:05:04.320> which<00:05:04.500> should<00:05:04.680> not<00:05:04.800> be

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:04.920 
more impressionist which should not be

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:06.890 
more impressionist which should not be
surprising<00:05:05.310> more<00:05:06.300> interesting<00:05:06.750> though<00:05:06.870> is

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:06.900 
surprising more interesting though is

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.290 
surprising more interesting though is
this<00:05:07.140> crowd<00:05:07.350> of<00:05:07.530> onlookers<00:05:07.680> that's<00:05:08.340> peering

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
this crowd of onlookers that's peering

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:12.160 
this crowd of onlookers that's peering
over<00:05:09.510> the<00:05:09.780> wall<00:05:10.050> and<00:05:10.350> this<00:05:10.830> is<00:05:11.010> probably

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:12.170 
over the wall and this is probably

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:16.220 
over the wall and this is probably
something<00:05:13.170> that<00:05:13.500> many<00:05:14.450> borrowed<00:05:15.450> from<00:05:15.690> or<00:05:16.110> was

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:16.230 
something that many borrowed from or was

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:17.660 
something that many borrowed from or was
inspired<00:05:16.560> by<00:05:16.710> Goya's<00:05:17.070> paintings<00:05:17.520> of

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:17.670 
inspired by Goya's paintings of

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:19.610 
inspired by Goya's paintings of
bullfights<00:05:18.150> but<00:05:18.840> this<00:05:19.020> isn't<00:05:19.320> really<00:05:19.440> the

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:19.620 
bullfights but this isn't really the

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:22.070 
bullfights but this isn't really the
raucous<00:05:20.100> crowd<00:05:20.370> of<00:05:20.760> Spaniards<00:05:21.600> that<00:05:22.050> a

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 
raucous crowd of Spaniards that a

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.470 
raucous crowd of Spaniards that a
bullfighter<00:05:22.620> like<00:05:23.070> maybe<00:05:23.310> the<00:05:23.550> we<00:05:24.180> think<00:05:24.390> of

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:24.480 
bullfighter like maybe the we think of

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:27.020 
bullfighter like maybe the we think of
like<00:05:24.630> bloodthirsty<00:05:25.380> Romans<00:05:26.190> in<00:05:26.340> the<00:05:26.370> Coliseum

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:27.030 
like bloodthirsty Romans in the Coliseum

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:28.550 
like bloodthirsty Romans in the Coliseum
peering<00:05:27.360> over<00:05:27.420> the<00:05:27.570> wall<00:05:27.810> watching<00:05:28.290> someone

getting<00:05:28.710> killed<00:05:28.980> these<00:05:29.550> people<00:05:29.880> would<00:05:30.000> really

looking<00:06:03.419> at<00:06:03.540> the<00:06:03.630> painting<00:06:04.080> and<00:06:05.030> then<00:06:06.030> we're

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:06.360 
looking at the painting and then we're

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:08.630 
looking at the painting and then we're
facing<00:06:06.600> the<00:06:07.080> sergeant<00:06:07.590> who<00:06:07.919> seems<00:06:08.220> to<00:06:08.280> be<00:06:08.430> kind

facing the sergeant who seems to be kind

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:12.730 
facing the sergeant who seems to be kind
of<00:06:08.730> oblivious<00:06:09.360> to<00:06:09.390> what's<00:06:09.720> going<00:06:09.900> on<00:06:10.200> here<00:06:10.500> and

of oblivious to what's going on here and

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:15.110 
of oblivious to what's going on here and
in<00:06:13.740> this<00:06:13.950> sense<00:06:14.190> and<00:06:14.460> of<00:06:14.580> course<00:06:14.790> people<00:06:15.000> can

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:15.120 
in this sense and of course people can

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:17.300 
in this sense and of course people can
disagree<00:06:15.419> with<00:06:15.720> me<00:06:15.840> on<00:06:15.930> this<00:06:16.080> but<00:06:16.290> I<00:06:16.350> think<00:06:16.470> the

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:17.310 
disagree with me on this but I think the

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:18.860 
disagree with me on this but I think the
message<00:06:17.760> here<00:06:17.940> the<00:06:18.060> political<00:06:18.450> measures<00:06:18.600> of

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:18.870 
message here the political measures of

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:20.030 
message here the political measures of
the<00:06:18.960> painting<00:06:19.290> is<00:06:19.410> really<00:06:19.620> a<00:06:19.650> lot<00:06:19.860> more

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:20.040 
the painting is really a lot more

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:21.770 
the painting is really a lot more
complex<00:06:20.520> than<00:06:20.669> Goya's<00:06:21.180> and<00:06:21.390> it's<00:06:21.510> definitely

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:21.780 
complex than Goya's and it's definitely

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:23.960 
complex than Goya's and it's definitely
less<00:06:22.440> explicit<00:06:23.040> as<00:06:23.130> well<00:06:23.310> there<00:06:23.730> isn't<00:06:23.850> a

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:23.970 
less explicit as well there isn't a

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:25.820 
less explicit as well there isn't a
clear<00:06:24.210> dichotomy<00:06:24.450> that's<00:06:24.990> being<00:06:25.260> laid<00:06:25.590> out<00:06:25.620> on

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:25.830 
clear dichotomy that's being laid out on

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:27.440 
clear dichotomy that's being laid out on
the<00:06:25.919> canvas<00:06:26.310> here<00:06:26.460> for<00:06:26.700> us<00:06:26.790> man<00:06:27.000> he<00:06:27.180> hasn't

the canvas here for us man he hasn't

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:30.080 
the canvas here for us man he hasn't
taken<00:06:27.600> an<00:06:27.840> obvious<00:06:28.200> side<00:06:28.440> are<00:06:29.130> we<00:06:29.610> supposed<00:06:29.970> to

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:30.090 
taken an obvious side are we supposed to

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:31.970 
taken an obvious side are we supposed to
who's<00:06:30.780> the<00:06:30.930> victim<00:06:31.110> here<00:06:31.440> is<00:06:31.470> it<00:06:31.620> the<00:06:31.710> Spanish

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:37.110 
it Maximilian in a sense he was just

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:38.490 
it Maximilian in a sense he was just
sort<00:06:37.200> of<00:06:37.320> Napoleon's<00:06:37.890> puppet

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:38.500 
sort of Napoleon's puppet

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:40.170 
sort of Napoleon's puppet
and<00:06:38.620> it's<00:06:38.860> now<00:06:38.950> getting<00:06:39.250> killed<00:06:39.730> because<00:06:40.000> of

and it's now getting killed because of

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:43.170 
and it's now getting killed because of
his<00:06:40.360> negligence<00:06:40.870> this<00:06:41.860> violence<00:06:42.430> once<00:06:42.880> again

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:43.180 
his negligence this violence once again

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:45.600 
his negligence this violence once again
like<00:06:43.420> we<00:06:43.720> saw<00:06:43.930> in<00:06:44.080> the<00:06:44.560> Goya<00:06:44.860> has<00:06:45.130> just<00:06:45.340> kind<00:06:45.520> of

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:45.610 
like we saw in the Goya has just kind of

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:46.800 
like we saw in the Goya has just kind of
happened<00:06:46.030> and<00:06:46.120> we're<00:06:46.270> left<00:06:46.420> with<00:06:46.600> this

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:46.810 
happened and we're left with this

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:48.570 
happened and we're left with this
cognitive<00:06:47.740> void<00:06:48.130> this<00:06:48.340> lack<00:06:48.550> of

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:48.580 
cognitive void this lack of

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:50.310 
cognitive void this lack of
comprehension<00:06:49.270> this<00:06:49.570> violence<00:06:49.930> just<00:06:50.050> doesn't

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:50.320 
comprehension this violence just doesn't

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:52.560 
comprehension this violence just doesn't
really<00:06:50.410> seem<00:06:50.680> necessary<00:06:50.890> and<00:06:51.550> it<00:06:52.360> kind<00:06:52.540> of

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:52.570 
really seem necessary and it kind of

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:54.390 
really seem necessary and it kind of
reminds<00:06:52.960> me<00:06:53.080> sometimes<00:06:53.470> of<00:06:53.650> how<00:06:54.070> we<00:06:54.130> ask

00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:54.400 
reminds me sometimes of how we ask

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:56.250 
reminds me sometimes of how we ask
ourselves<00:06:54.610> like<00:06:55.180> how<00:06:55.360> something<00:06:55.960> like<00:06:56.170> the

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:56.260 
ourselves like how something like the

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:57.990 
ourselves like how something like the
Holocaust<00:06:56.380> could<00:06:56.920> have<00:06:57.010> happened<00:06:57.340> the<00:06:57.730> answer

00:06:57.990 --> 00:06:58.000 
Holocaust could have happened the answer

00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.220 
Holocaust could have happened the answer
is<00:06:58.090> that<00:06:58.150> we<00:06:58.270> can<00:06:58.390> think<00:06:58.540> of<00:06:58.690> our<00:06:58.810> never<00:06:58.990> really

00:06:59.220 --> 00:06:59.230 
is that we can think of our never really

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:00.600 
is that we can think of our never really
satisfying<00:06:59.800> we<00:06:59.950> just<00:07:00.100> know<00:07:00.220> that<00:07:00.340> it<00:07:00.430> did

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:00.610 
satisfying we just know that it did

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:03.690 
satisfying we just know that it did
happen<00:07:01.020> so<00:07:02.020> what<00:07:02.290> I<00:07:02.470> think<00:07:02.740> both<00:07:02.980> Goya<00:07:03.340> and

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:03.700 
happen so what I think both Goya and

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:05.910 
happen so what I think both Goya and
MANET<00:07:04.270> are<00:07:04.450> really<00:07:04.960> trying<00:07:05.170> to<00:07:05.290> say<00:07:05.470> here<00:07:05.770> is

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:05.920 
MANET are really trying to say here is

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:08.490 
MANET are really trying to say here is
that<00:07:05.950> sanctioned<00:07:06.730> violence<00:07:06.970> and<00:07:07.390> cruelty<00:07:08.080> are

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:08.500 
that sanctioned violence and cruelty are

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:11.690 
that sanctioned violence and cruelty are
oftentimes<00:07:09.370> best<00:07:09.850> depicted<00:07:10.390> as<00:07:10.540> a<00:07:10.600> sort<00:07:11.440> of

00:07:11.690 --> 00:07:11.700 
oftentimes best depicted as a sort of
