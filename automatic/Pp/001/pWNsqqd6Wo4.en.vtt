00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:06.930
 Hello everyone would like to because of this 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:09.090
 a small review by a mass pharmacy gainer 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.330
 100% premium mass gainer 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:16.560
 I have not found an overview of this on the Internet 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.640
 geyner therefore decided to make himself that 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.090
 say like 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.600
 gainer good reviews about him good too 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.880
 were 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.580
 and the bad were but wanted to make sure 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.680
 this wanted to take also Sirius masses but 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:33.570
 the presence was not therefore took this 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:41.100
 the product he also took a good taste 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:42.559
 chocolate took packaging also weighing 544 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:47.730
 kilogram 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:49.309
 get such a big gainer with him 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:55.440
 together took also 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:57.510
 shaker from olimp company let's see 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:02.010
 that as part of the manufacturer writes that 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:03.750
 The lineup includes fighter minerals glutamine and 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.390
 others others probably others 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:12.049
 vitamins that are in this geineri 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:14.970
 also it says here that this gainer 

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:19.890
 increases weight 2 does not give double 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:22.430
 the mass seems to increase strength and narrowly 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:27.330
 narrowly accelerates you but u say how 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:31.960
 recovery let's see done 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:34.390
 also let's say so in america 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:38.560
 let's see what is written here 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:43.060
 there is as i would say it was valin 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:44.860
 and isoleucine and leucine is let's say a fighter 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:48.100
 they recover or 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:51.420
 and also our muscles are at 35 percent 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:54.159
 composed of these amino acids 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.390
 let's see in more detail what 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:59.740
 writes the manufacturer 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:03.190
 about the composition so a portion consists of two 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:05.649
 chirp points is 330 grams i.e. 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:10.630
 5 and 44 kg packs 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:12.900
 contains about 16 servings in 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:17.590
 Do you mix one serving with water? 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:21.580
 there is a mix of 500 milliliters serving 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:23.560
 water then it turns out 1290 kilocalories of 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:28.180
 there are 35 kilocalories of fat 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:31.269
 also includes 261 grams of carbohydrates 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:34.090
 of which 13 grams of sugar that is, it will give 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:37.269
 attacks good show that the thirteenth 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:41.560
 sugar contained in this product also 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:44.010
 composition includes protein here its 53 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:47.890
 grams as well as various vitamins 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:51.070
 also if you specify what to mix 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:54.400
 this product with milk 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:58.239
 so from fat milk it turns out in 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.890
 composition of 1460 kilocalories well you see yes 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:01.980
 there as the amount will increase 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:04.299
 kilocalories so now I will tell you that 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:07.600
 other indicators also increase 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:12.850
 composition is enriched as well as in composition 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:15.310
 cult whole 85 grams of carbohydrates and here 37 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:18.510
 a gram of sugar well as i told it 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:23.109
 a good figure is also 70 grams of protein 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:25.440
 it seems to me that I read that at a time 

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:28.840
 all the drink it somehow will 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:32.290
 difficult and not fully digested 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:35.140
 when divided into two parts one portion 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:37.450
 or do as follows 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.480
 going to do direct weight 70 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.720
 kilogram 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:44.650
 and growing 180 I will do as follows 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:49.370
 no workout i'll use 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:51.709
 masal so premium masses 40 minutes to 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:54.409
 training 40 minutes before training and 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:59.629
 we have 20 minutes after training 

00:03:54.409 --> 00:04:01.760
 Immediately and not say so not disturbing I 

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:04.069
 I will use this gainer in the morning 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:06.010
 fasting because before that I don't 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:09.500
 have time to eat something there 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:11.690
 in the morning on an empty stomach and after lunch somewhere in 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:14.150
 a half or two hours after lunch I will 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:15.829
 suppresses their gainer let's open 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:17.329
 see since this is my first money I 

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:20.449
 I am not very familiar with him 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:25.669
 let's look goes inside like me 

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:26.960
 told the chocolate taste I opened it 

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:30.110
 saw what's inside 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:34.130
 Now I show you how to see yes such 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:35.090
 powder inside the scoop here I want to show 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:38.479
 you such a scoop 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:40.639
 he is very big who saw there in my 

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:45.110
 and in Sirius masses the same scoop he 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:46.039
 very big i don't know how many 250 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:49.820
 probably graunder 

00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:55.370
 200 250 grams is contained in this 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:56.680
 contain a scoop but a very large merck 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:05:00.410
 very large 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:03.710
 so you need to take this one third or 

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:08.020
 there is one second part of this scoop and on 

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:12.400
 consume one portion well well I think 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:16.400
 after how this is a gainer if i 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:18.950
 I can gather to gain my weight there as 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:21.919
 would be 10 grams my goal and if I type this 

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:24.229
 weight then I will no longer consume 

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:26.389
 Gainer will continue to train as if 

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:28.970
 without sportpit but there will not work 

00:05:26.389 --> 00:05:32.060
 second time i think i'll take some serious mass 

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:34.370
 Well, let's see a banana or something there 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:37.220
 would be strawberry flavor well for 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:40.880
 diversity also I as noted the beginning 

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:42.470
 video I took a shaker from the company olimp guys 

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:45.979
 this is not an advertisement I just tell you something 

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:49.430
 that i bought this shaker they didn't like 

00:05:45.979 --> 00:05:50.720
 because here let's say three sections 1 

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:54.770
 the main section 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:56.650
 well for the gainer 2 sections for 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:59.660
 vitamins there or some 

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:01.490
 pills there maybe someone who loves 

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:03.590
 inserts both lift and also 

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:05.870
 respectively for powder if you drink 

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:07.490
 as I said after training if 

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:10.160
 want to take something here to add 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:13.220
 powder and takes along normally so 

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.880
 guys do not need to use this genius as 

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:16.970
 replacement 

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:19.310
 as a substitute for natural food that is 

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:21.770
 you need to eat a day 

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:24.380
 guys who are thin 

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:27.080
 physique need to eat 4 times as 

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:32.120
 at least two servings as i was waiting for this 

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:34.430
 gainer between meals and in my 

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:37.220
 all i have said i want to do more 

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:38.960
 video in two weeks today or 

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:43.100
 tomorrow I will have the first day of admission 

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:45.440
 this product in two weeks will do 

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:48.410
 another review will tell you what kind of snake 

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:52.640
 happened to me and i hope that i 

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:54.860
 I will collect my desired 10 kilograms and 

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:57.860
 you had the same dial if you 

00:06:54.860 --> 00:07:00.770
 want to reach your goal there 

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:04.930
 the right weight for you and exercise 

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:04.930
 diligently and thanks for watching
