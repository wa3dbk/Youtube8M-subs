00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
things like that so I played around with

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.119 
things like that so I played around with
it<00:00:41.399> for<00:00:41.520> a<00:00:41.700> little<00:00:41.910> bit<00:00:42.059> and<00:00:42.680> I've<00:00:43.680> done<00:00:44.100> a

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
it for a little bit and I've done a

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.459 
it for a little bit and I've done a
little<00:00:44.399> trial<00:00:44.789> and<00:00:45.000> error<00:00:45.180> and<00:00:45.750> so<00:00:46.020> I<00:00:46.050> decided

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
little trial and error and so I decided

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.529 
little trial and error and so I decided
to<00:00:46.620> pass<00:00:46.890> on<00:00:47.129> some<00:00:47.399> of<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.579> things<00:00:47.760> that<00:00:48.059> I've

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
to pass on some of the things that I've

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.939 
to pass on some of the things that I've
picked<00:00:48.600> up<00:00:49.140> that<00:00:49.410> were<00:00:51.050> useful<00:00:52.050> and<00:00:52.559> hopefully

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
picked up that were useful and hopefully

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.130

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
too light the thing that I found that

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.920 
too light the thing that I found that
works<00:04:00.240> out<00:04:00.420> the<00:04:00.570> best

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.390 
period work a whole lot better than

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:17.390

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
cheaper polish is anything up under I'll

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.310 
cheaper polish is anything up under I'll
say<00:04:20.609> four<00:04:20.880> bucks<00:04:21.120> because<00:04:21.780> they<00:04:22.109> have<00:04:22.290> a

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
say four bucks because they have a

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.629 
say four bucks because they have a
really<00:04:22.680> watery<00:04:23.160> consistency<00:04:23.430> and<00:04:24.180> when<00:04:24.270> you

00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:24.639 
really watery consistency and when you

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:27.450 
really watery consistency and when you
to<00:04:24.849> use<00:04:25.090> the<00:04:25.449> scraper<00:04:25.870> to<00:04:26.590> scrape<00:04:26.710> it<00:04:27.009> off<00:04:27.189> a

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
to use the scraper to scrape it off a

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.570 
to use the scraper to scrape it off a
lot<00:04:27.789> of<00:04:27.969> the<00:04:28.120> polish<00:04:28.539> comes<00:04:28.870> up<00:04:29.169> with<00:04:30.009> the

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:30.580 
lot of the polish comes up with the

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.179 
lot of the polish comes up with the
scraper<00:04:30.909> and<00:04:31.270> doesn't<00:04:31.840> adhere<00:04:31.960> to<00:04:32.620> the<00:04:32.800> design

00:04:33.179 --> 00:04:33.189

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:36.510
