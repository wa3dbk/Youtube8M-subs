00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:40.140
 huge path in the sector 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.040
 juvenile ends with spring 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.900
 arrive in the spring group 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.630
 means training here in milanello 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:48.390
 next to the first team 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:51.130
 a fundamental experience 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.980
 very important because it is really the dream 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:56.100
 to be part of this first team 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.100
 it actually becomes 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:04.580
 all of course they do it for us is 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:06.350
 important to have the awareness that 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.810
 we gave all these guys a 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:12.670
 help to make them grow from the point of 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.670
 personal view from the human point of view 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:18.650
 the passage to say the spring is 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:21.350
 it was very difficult because you see the 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.120
 change of the rhythms above all 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:27.130
 you play with people who are not of your age but 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:27.130
 however, bigger players 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.490
 for me it is important to love next door too 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:15.870
 a skoda because you always learn 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:15.870
 so much from these great champions 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:25.590
 the semi-ring is definitely a big one 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.810
 help for my personal growth like 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.450
 structure there is everything from the gym to 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:33.980
 beautiful fields and therefore you can grow 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.980
 in an appropriate way 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.319
 to young people in the youth sector 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:45.980
 I always recommend being very 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:47.930
 disciplined is an aspect I have 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.420
 learned when I wasn't part of it 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:53.510
 of the youth and I remember that mine 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:55.730
 coach when pd for example that 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.890
 the slippers arrive or carry over came the 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.720
 month in place the slippers and told me to 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:01.819
 things you ordered out of 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.549
 then camp will also be ordered in the field 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:21.049
 my peasant family take root like 

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:23.239
 owner would be great to be the 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:26.989
 milan san shirt the people on 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:28.250
 stands when you reach your dream 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:28.810
 realize that the journey is alone 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.579
 at the beginning 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:33.700
 everything is outside the tunnel in the field 

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:36.410
 what you've always dreamed of 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:38.690
 when I go up the stairs and do all 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:39.500
 the people at that point I remember why 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.330
 I'm free 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:45.100
 I have not arrived and I have to do 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:45.100
 what i like most about playing
