let's take it for a little tour here
gonna<00:01:01.469> throw<00:01:01.829> it<00:01:01.920> in<00:01:02.010> some<00:01:02.159> dirt<00:01:02.429> and<00:01:02.730> check<00:01:03.390> it

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:03.479 
gonna throw it in some dirt and check it

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:08.289

so with the dirt you're not going to
notice<00:01:11.130> any<00:01:11.399> real<00:01:11.580> difference<00:01:11.790> because<00:01:12.210> it

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
notice any real difference because it

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.149

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
does protect it so actually the screen

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.969 
does protect it so actually the screen
wise<00:01:14.399> you<00:01:15.240> can<00:01:15.420> see<00:01:15.630> that<00:01:15.840> this<00:01:16.560> screen<00:01:16.950> here

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
wise you can see that this screen here

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.810 
wise you can see that this screen here
it<00:01:17.570> somehow<00:01:18.570> resists<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.670> fingerprints<00:01:20.670> will

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
it somehow resists the fingerprints will

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.460 
it somehow resists the fingerprints will
lessen<00:01:21.149> a<00:01:21.390> wood<00:01:21.539> on<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.780> actual<00:01:22.049> life<00:01:22.289> on

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
lessen a wood on the actual life on

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.609 
lessen a wood on the actual life on
itself<00:01:23.600> let's<00:01:24.600> take<00:01:24.720> it<00:01:24.840> for<00:01:25.020> a<00:01:25.049> tour<00:01:25.289> down<00:01:25.500> the
