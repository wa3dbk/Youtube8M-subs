some webbing on the maverick barrels

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:50.340 
some webbing on the maverick barrels
themselves<00:01:48.550> now<00:01:48.700> that<00:01:48.730> is<00:01:49.000> two<00:01:49.660> separate<00:01:50.110> webs

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
themselves now that is two separate webs

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:52.500 
themselves now that is two separate webs
this<00:01:50.650> one<00:01:50.830> goes<00:01:51.010> this<00:01:51.220> way<00:01:51.520> and<00:01:51.790> this<00:01:52.330> one

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
Mavericks it is getting I guess tin feet

Mavericks it is getting I guess tin feet
less<00:02:20.900> than<00:02:20.930> mine<00:02:21.410> yet<00:02:21.710> which<00:02:21.980> puts<00:02:22.280> it<00:02:22.370> at

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
less than mine yet which puts it at

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.600 
less than mine yet which puts it at
solid<00:02:23.030> 40<00:02:23.450> foot<00:02:23.660> ranges<00:02:24.200> it<00:02:25.190> would<00:02:25.310> probably

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
solid 40 foot ranges it would probably

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.160 
solid 40 foot ranges it would probably
get<00:02:25.700> 40<00:02:25.940> feet<00:02:26.210> with<00:02:26.360> Stefan's<00:02:26.750> it's<00:02:26.930> getting
