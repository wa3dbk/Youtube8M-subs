00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.859
 egg fettuccine with a very good one 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.620
 champignon cream then how 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.870
 ingredients we need half an onion 1 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.990
 clove of butter garlic a 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:21.240
 pack of cream 450 grams 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:23.430
 of champignon mushrooms that I have here 200 g of 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.310
 fettuccine with egg I use those barilla 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.890
 however what that is is fine of the 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:32.880
 milk using ruby that milk them e 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.860
 of parsley then we begin with rita 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.280
 the garlic and then we clean and 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.280
 host 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.870
 garlic is also well chopped 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.730
 roughly so much then it must 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.730
 shake so there are no problems 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:12.560
 chop it in half onion 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.160
 add some butter 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:40.360
 look a little bit more we start to do 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:43.640
 brown the onion the garlic with the boom 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:47.120
 after which they started washing our names 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:51.680
 mushrooms and cut them to clean them once 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:54.740
 washed we cut the mushrooms into small pieces 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:59.870
 the privet, in short, not too much maybe not 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:01.700
 too much pigtails so then these 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:04.550
 they decrease to many once 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:13.670

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:23.690
 let it soften after about ten 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:26.590
 minutes of cooking 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.590
