00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
a haystack exactly what legs turn over

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.610 
a haystack exactly what legs turn over
though<00:03:33.269> again<00:03:33.629> like<00:03:33.870> we<00:03:33.989> said<00:03:34.139> earlier<00:03:34.199> you

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.559 
though again like we said earlier you
can't<00:03:34.859> be<00:03:35.010> frustrating<00:03:35.579> you<00:03:35.669> gotta<00:03:35.849> go<00:03:36.030> to<00:03:36.269> try

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:36.569 
can't be frustrating you gotta go to try

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:38.180 
can't be frustrating you gotta go to try
everything<00:03:36.900> because<00:03:37.410> if<00:03:37.560> some<00:03:37.859> fish<00:03:38.069> are

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
everything because if some fish are

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.039 
everything because if some fish are
still<00:03:38.310> feeding<00:03:38.639> out<00:03:38.849> there<00:03:39.090> just<00:03:39.900> the<00:03:40.019> whole

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:40.049 
still feeding out there just the whole

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:42.319 
still feeding out there just the whole
lake<00:03:40.590> becomes<00:03:40.980> one<00:03:41.220> big<00:03:41.250> isotherm<00:03:41.970> all<00:03:42.180> the

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:42.329 
lake becomes one big isotherm all the

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:44.240 
lake becomes one big isotherm all the
same<00:03:42.510> temperature<00:03:43.079> and<00:03:43.260> the<00:03:43.829> fish<00:03:44.010> move

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
same temperature and the fish move

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:45.860 
same temperature and the fish move
around<00:03:44.519> them<00:03:44.730> they<00:03:44.970> move<00:03:45.150> everywhere<00:03:45.540> so<00:03:45.750> you

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
around them they move everywhere so you

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.390
