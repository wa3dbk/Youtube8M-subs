 'the fantastic 4 ' 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:33.799
 I really took about seven or eight 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:35.600
 months or nine maybe or maybe ten but 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:37.759
 less than a year , however, there is no 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.469
 be an old sea wolf to know that 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:41.539
 Latin America is rising in 

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:43.399

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:46.060
 the next few years we will see an evolution 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:46.060
 about 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.460
 could name a chorizo ​​of concepts 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.890
 that help a project to get out 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:57.320
 forward but the truth is that only two 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.659
 They are the most important 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.369

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:03.289

 remarkably in everything and this results 

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:08.300
 always in positive things the other 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:11.180
 aspect is perseverance since it is 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.019
 fundamental there will be difficult times but 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.430
 if you do not give up 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:16.989
 you will reap the fruits of your effort 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.989
