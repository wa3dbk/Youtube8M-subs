experiences with this weapon so far this

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:36.889 
experiences with this weapon so far this
was<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:35.730> very<00:00:35.880> first<00:00:36.180> game<00:00:36.420> that<00:00:36.450> I<00:00:36.660> ever

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
was the very first game that I ever

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.369 
was the very first game that I ever
played<00:00:37.340> with<00:00:38.340> this<00:00:38.520> weapon<00:00:39.379> learned

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
played with this weapon learned

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.990 
played with this weapon learned
something<00:00:40.890> about<00:00:41.010> it<00:00:41.399> very<00:00:42.059> quickly<00:00:43.579> that<00:00:44.579> I

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
something about it very quickly that I

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.090 
something about it very quickly that I
don't<00:00:45.210> really<00:00:45.420> like<00:00:45.690> about<00:00:45.719> it<00:00:46.200> so<00:00:46.320> this<00:00:46.920> gun

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
don't really like about it so this gun

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.100 
don't really like about it so this gun
is<00:00:47.219> definitely<00:00:47.610> changed<00:00:48.000> and<00:00:48.180> I<00:00:48.719> will<00:00:48.930> get

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
is definitely changed and I will get

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.540 
is definitely changed and I will get
into<00:00:49.260> that<00:00:49.410> in<00:00:49.530> short<00:00:49.680> time<00:00:49.920> but<00:00:50.219> let's<00:00:50.460> talk

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
into that in short time but let's talk

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.639 
into that in short time but let's talk
about<00:00:50.610> how<00:00:50.850> you<00:00:51.000> actually<00:00:51.300> unlock<00:00:51.809> it<00:00:52.050> and<00:00:52.230> the

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
about how you actually unlock it and the

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.709 
about how you actually unlock it and the
Dow<00:00:52.829> Kung<00:00:53.129> Pao<00:00:53.160> is<00:00:53.640> definitely<00:00:54.239> one<00:00:54.480> of<00:00:54.510> the

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
Dow Kung Pao is definitely one of the

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.500 
Dow Kung Pao is definitely one of the
easier<00:00:55.199> ones<00:00:55.469> to<00:00:55.710> unlock<00:00:56.280> in<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.820> game<00:00:57.180> it's

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
easier ones to unlock in the game it's

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:58.880 
easier ones to unlock in the game it's
it's<00:00:57.780> fairly<00:00:58.050> easy<00:00:58.199> it's<00:00:58.559> pretty<00:00:58.739> much

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
it's fairly easy it's pretty much

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.709 
it's fairly easy it's pretty much
guaranteed<00:00:59.489> to<00:00:59.670> happen<00:00:59.820> within<00:01:00.210> like<00:01:00.510> two

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
guaranteed to happen within like two

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.930 
guaranteed to happen within like two
minutes<00:01:00.960> so<00:01:01.410> what<00:01:02.100> you<00:01:02.219> do<00:01:02.370> is<00:01:02.489> you<00:01:02.609> hop<00:01:02.789> on

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
minutes so what you do is you hop on

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.579 
minutes so what you do is you hop on
caspian<00:01:03.510> border<00:01:03.809> and<00:01:03.930> i<00:01:03.989> believe<00:01:04.229> you<00:01:04.379> have<00:01:04.409> to

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
caspian border and i believe you have to

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.649 
caspian border and i believe you have to
do<00:01:04.710> all<00:01:04.920> of<00:01:04.949> this<00:01:05.189> at<00:01:05.430> once<00:01:05.760> because<00:01:06.150> i<00:01:06.180> think<00:01:06.299> i

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
do all of this at once because i think i

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.960 
do all of this at once because i think i
have<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:07.020> shotgun<00:01:07.320> ribbon<00:01:08.010> in<00:01:08.159> a<00:01:08.580> different

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
have the shotgun ribbon in a different

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.700 
have the shotgun ribbon in a different
gameplay<00:01:09.420> and<00:01:09.689> it<00:01:09.780> didn't<00:01:10.020> apply<00:01:10.200> to<00:01:10.320> it<00:01:10.590> so<00:01:10.680> i

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
gameplay and it didn't apply to it so i

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.050 
gameplay and it didn't apply to it so i
think<00:01:10.799> you<00:01:10.979> need<00:01:11.130> to<00:01:11.159> have<00:01:11.280> a<00:01:11.340> shotgun<00:01:11.610> ribbon

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
think you need to have a shotgun ribbon

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.249 
think you need to have a shotgun ribbon
and<00:01:12.240> lower<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.869> gate<00:01:13.140> or<00:01:13.380> raise<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.189> gate<00:01:14.430> on

00:01:15.249 --> 00:01:15.259 
and lower the gate or raise the gate on

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:17.390 
and lower the gate or raise the gate on
caspian<00:01:16.259> border<00:01:16.710> now<00:01:16.890> if<00:01:17.130> you<00:01:17.250> guys<00:01:17.340> are

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
caspian border now if you guys are

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.770 
caspian border now if you guys are
curious<00:01:17.640> about<00:01:17.850> what<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.150> gate<00:01:18.360> is<00:01:18.540> it's

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
curious about what the gate is it's

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.120 
curious about what the gate is it's
basically<00:01:19.229> this<00:01:19.380> little<00:01:19.619> thing<00:01:19.920> there's

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
basically this little thing there's

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.700 
basically this little thing there's
buttons<00:01:20.400> there's<00:01:20.880> a<00:01:20.939> giant<00:01:21.360> wall<00:01:21.570> now<00:01:21.900> over<00:01:22.530> by

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
buttons there's a giant wall now over by

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.130 
buttons there's a giant wall now over by
I<00:01:22.740> think<00:01:23.040> what<00:01:23.189> is<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.460> be<00:01:23.640> objective<00:01:24.360> there's

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
I think what is the be objective there's

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.050 
I think what is the be objective there's
a<00:01:25.229> giant<00:01:25.560> wall<00:01:25.680> there<00:01:25.920> on<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.460> outside<00:01:26.820> or<00:01:27.000> a

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
a giant wall there on the outside or a

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.850 
a giant wall there on the outside or a
couple<00:01:27.330> kiosks<00:01:27.869> ticket<00:01:28.229> booths<00:01:28.439> whatever<00:01:28.770> the

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
couple kiosks ticket booths whatever the

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.590 
couple kiosks ticket booths whatever the
hell<00:01:28.979> you<00:01:29.040> want<00:01:29.189> to<00:01:29.220> call<00:01:29.310> them<00:01:29.490> both<00:01:30.000> sides<00:01:30.360> of

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
hell you want to call them both sides of

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.539 
hell you want to call them both sides of
that<00:01:30.630> giant<00:01:30.990> wall<00:01:31.259> there<00:01:31.920> are<00:01:32.070> two<00:01:32.250> switches

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
that giant wall there are two switches

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.280 
that giant wall there are two switches
you<00:01:32.759> go<00:01:32.850> push<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.270> button<00:01:33.570> you<00:01:33.600> do<00:01:33.810> that<00:01:34.020> and

know rounds and and it is pump action or
slow<00:03:17.760> rate<00:03:17.910> of<00:03:17.940> fire<00:03:18.060> anything<00:03:18.450> like<00:03:18.600> this

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
slow rate of fire anything like this

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.330 
slow rate of fire anything like this
this<00:03:18.930> is<00:03:19.109> somewhat<00:03:19.470> spammable<00:03:19.859> at<00:03:20.040> a<00:03:20.069> decent

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
this is somewhat spammable at a decent

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.490 
this is somewhat spammable at a decent
rate<00:03:20.639> of<00:03:20.760> fire<00:03:20.970> its<00:03:21.540> reload<00:03:21.900> really<00:03:22.200> holds<00:03:22.410> it

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
rate of fire its reload really holds it

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.080 
rate of fire its reload really holds it
back<00:03:22.680> and<00:03:22.889> I<00:03:22.950> find<00:03:23.190> that<00:03:23.280> a<00:03:23.370> lot<00:03:23.670> of<00:03:23.760> times<00:03:23.940> I

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
back and I find that a lot of times I

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:25.610 
back and I find that a lot of times I
needed<00:03:24.359> ammo<00:03:24.630> I<00:03:24.750> think<00:03:24.959> within<00:03:25.109> the<00:03:25.260> 15

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
needed ammo I think within the 15

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.199 
needed ammo I think within the 15
minutes<00:03:25.859> I<00:03:25.950> played<00:03:26.190> I<00:03:26.220> needed<00:03:26.700> to<00:03:26.790> wait<00:03:26.970> for<00:03:27.180> a

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
minutes I played I needed to wait for a

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:29.930 
minutes I played I needed to wait for a
meal<00:03:27.480> or<00:03:27.569> weapon<00:03:27.870> swap<00:03:28.079> like<00:03:28.410> six<00:03:29.400> times<00:03:29.579> and

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
meal or weapon swap like six times and

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.370 
meal or weapon swap like six times and
that's<00:03:30.150> that's<00:03:30.450> quite<00:03:30.690> excessive<00:03:31.200> because

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
that's that's quite excessive because

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:32.270 
that's that's quite excessive because
you're<00:03:31.470> gonna<00:03:31.560> spend<00:03:31.709> a<00:03:31.859> lot<00:03:32.010> of<00:03:32.040> time

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
you're gonna spend a lot of time

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.539 
you're gonna spend a lot of time
spraying<00:03:32.700> four<00:03:32.970> shots<00:03:33.239> to<00:03:33.420> kill<00:03:33.540> one<00:03:33.750> guy<00:03:33.780> and

00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:34.549 
spraying four shots to kill one guy and

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:37.819 
spraying four shots to kill one guy and
it<00:03:35.549> just<00:03:35.910> time<00:03:36.090> flies<00:03:36.450> when<00:03:37.170> you're<00:03:37.290> reloading

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:37.829 
it just time flies when you're reloading

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:40.430 
it just time flies when you're reloading
so<00:03:38.069> that's<00:03:38.730> just<00:03:39.030> kind<00:03:39.239> of<00:03:39.299> what<00:03:39.420> happens<00:03:39.810> so

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
so that's just kind of what happens so

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.650 
so that's just kind of what happens so
again<00:03:40.829> the<00:03:41.130> gun<00:03:41.310> is<00:03:41.430> great<00:03:41.670> it's<00:03:41.940> very<00:03:42.420> very

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
again the gun is great it's very very

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.629 
again the gun is great it's very very
easy<00:03:42.720> to<00:03:42.959> unlock<00:03:43.139> I<00:03:43.560> love<00:03:43.889> it<00:03:44.100> the<00:03:44.280> one<00:03:44.459> thing

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:44.639 
easy to unlock I love it the one thing

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:45.979 
easy to unlock I love it the one thing
that<00:03:44.700> they<00:03:44.910> really<00:03:45.239> need<00:03:45.389> to<00:03:45.480> work<00:03:45.630> on<00:03:45.810> is<00:03:45.959> the

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
that they really need to work on is the

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:47.539 
that they really need to work on is the
reload<00:03:46.410> now<00:03:46.590> I'm<00:03:46.709> not<00:03:46.859> saying<00:03:47.040> it<00:03:47.220> needs<00:03:47.310> to<00:03:47.459> be

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 
reload now I'm not saying it needs to be

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:51.289 
reload now I'm not saying it needs to be
super<00:03:48.000> fast<00:03:48.239> or<00:03:48.569> anything<00:03:48.810> like<00:03:49.170> that<00:03:50.030> but<00:03:51.030> it

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299 
super fast or anything like that but it

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:52.940 
super fast or anything like that but it
really<00:03:51.329> is<00:03:51.780> a<00:03:51.930> slow<00:03:52.260> thing<00:03:52.500> because<00:03:52.680> when<00:03:52.859> you

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
really is a slow thing because when you

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:54.259 
really is a slow thing because when you
walk<00:03:53.160> in<00:03:53.340> there<00:03:53.489> and<00:03:53.519> you<00:03:53.670> clear<00:03:53.880> out<00:03:53.910> a<00:03:54.030> room

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
walk in there and you clear out a room

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:55.520 
walk in there and you clear out a room
if<00:03:54.389> you<00:03:54.510> get<00:03:54.630> behind<00:03:54.989> like<00:03:55.200> four<00:03:55.410> or<00:03:55.500> five

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
if you get behind like four or five

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:56.900 
if you get behind like four or five
dudes<00:03:55.920> those<00:03:56.100> four<00:03:56.280> or<00:03:56.370> five<00:03:56.400> dudes<00:03:56.760> are

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
dudes those four or five dudes are

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:58.430 
dudes those four or five dudes are
basically<00:03:57.299> guaranteed<00:03:57.750> dead<00:03:57.959> before<00:03:58.170> you're

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
basically guaranteed dead before you're

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.830 
basically guaranteed dead before you're
empty<00:03:58.769> the<00:03:59.190> only<00:03:59.400> true<00:03:59.579> downfall<00:04:00.269> is<00:04:00.480> the<00:04:00.599> fact

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
empty the only true downfall is the fact

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.330 
empty the only true downfall is the fact
that<00:04:00.930> you<00:04:01.109> have<00:04:01.230> to<00:04:01.349> worry<00:04:01.530> about<00:04:01.590> the<00:04:01.950> reload

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
that you have to worry about the reload

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.069 
that you have to worry about the reload
so<00:04:02.609> if<00:04:02.940> ever<00:04:03.120> need<00:04:03.359> be<00:04:03.510> find<00:04:03.840> a<00:04:03.930> nice

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:04.079 
so if ever need be find a nice

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:05.720 
so if ever need be find a nice
complimentary<00:04:04.739> secondary<00:04:05.280> something<00:04:05.579> like

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
complimentary secondary something like

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:07.699 
complimentary secondary something like
the<00:04:05.849> g18<00:04:06.150> if<00:04:06.630> you're<00:04:06.750> good<00:04:06.959> with<00:04:07.139> that<00:04:07.440> or

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
the g18 if you're good with that or

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:09.349 
the g18 if you're good with that or
something<00:04:08.160> like<00:04:08.250> p226<00:04:08.819> that<00:04:09.030> there's<00:04:09.150> a<00:04:09.209> lot

something like p226 that there's a lot

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:10.580 
something like p226 that there's a lot
of<00:04:09.389> ammo<00:04:09.690> if<00:04:09.780> you<00:04:09.840> need<00:04:09.989> to<00:04:10.049> clean<00:04:10.139> up<00:04:10.260> an<00:04:10.380> extra

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
of ammo if you need to clean up an extra

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:11.839 
of ammo if you need to clean up an extra

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:17.039 
inside the shotgun but that's it I

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:18.529 
inside the shotgun but that's it I
wanted<00:04:17.430> to<00:04:17.519> show<00:04:17.669> this<00:04:17.849> thing<00:04:18.030> off<00:04:18.209> to<00:04:18.329> let<00:04:18.450> you

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:19.979 
guys know it's a great weapon it's only

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:22.039 
guys know it's a great weapon it's only
real<00:04:20.400> flaw<00:04:20.729> is<00:04:20.970> the<00:04:21.090> reload<00:04:21.389> rate<00:04:21.599> but<00:04:21.780> I<00:04:21.840> think

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
real flaw is the reload rate but I think

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:23.690 
real flaw is the reload rate but I think
I<00:04:22.200> think<00:04:22.380> I<00:04:22.470> think<00:04:22.500> with<00:04:22.800> a<00:04:23.099> little<00:04:23.550> bit<00:04:23.640> of

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700 
I think I think with a little bit of

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.520 
I think I think with a little bit of
experience<00:04:24.030> and<00:04:24.300> you<00:04:24.360> learn<00:04:24.750> to<00:04:24.780> get<00:04:25.050> used<00:04:25.349> to

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
experience and you learn to get used to

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:25.820 
experience and you learn to get used to
it

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
it

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:27.600 
it
you'll<00:04:26.190> know<00:04:26.340> how<00:04:26.610> to
