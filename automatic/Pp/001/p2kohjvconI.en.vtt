 in it we just installed nothing 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.550
 according to the program , I feel fine 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.500
 will you do if someone here to examine 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:11.170
 for him to check and look for any 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.380
 kind of virus or evil is the thing that 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.700
 is messing with your computer 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.860
 beauty by completing the check it goes 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.900
 give you a report now these tabs 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:23.380
 Here all that he found here is 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.910
 a service that is service is a service 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.220
 that runs with the heat you run 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:29.920
 something that was not you that created 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.540
 a part of the world says something 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.970
 so we made a fighter 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.310
 if there is anything it will be 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:39.130
 only just this folder than step 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:41.140
 I created a part he probably 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.209
 program creates to make the order 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.310
 this is to take and this he considers with 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:47.830
 malware in case you want no 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:50.290
 install in nepal you just mark here me 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:53.500
 I do not know everything about cleaning everything 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:55.630
 even here files he creates that do not 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.390
 should it be the systax installers to 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:00.850
 advertising that creates shortcuts will also 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.860
 search here then windows registry 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:05.980
 that such programs generally create a 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:08.040
 Windows registry to leave saved and 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:11.230
 here is the part of the browsers 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:13.420
 it messes with internet explorer firefox and 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:15.520
 what chrome you will do if you have any 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:19.300
 thing in that browser year that was not in the 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:21.190
 default browser it will remove can 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.680
 rest assured that you will not 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.090
 remove your accounts and settings 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.680
 everything will be normal 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:30.340
 in August will eliminate this publicity 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:32.170
 Beauty syrup takes a look here in the 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.000
 that you find if you do not want it 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.769
 This is only a May thing and it will 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.830
 You will see and will click on me. 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:40.900
 for he will ask to close everything 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:42.519
 good beauty after he finishes 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.290
 clean if you click ok 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:46.780
 it will appear this message that he 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:49.150
 will need to restart the computer 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.650
 because it needs to restart because it has 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:53.200
 program has things you can not 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.880
 remove when running it 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.680
 have to do before you start windows 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:00.100
 this is why he asks for 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:01.840
 start what he does all the cleaning without 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:04.989
 no problem from any other web 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:06.760
 installed it can not remove and 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:08.739
 restarting after you started 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.660
 the player back you can check the 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:12.700
 browsers that all remove that 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:13.630
 boring advertising is that it disrupts your 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:16.150
 navigation 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:17.260
 I hope you have enjoyed it until 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:20.019

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:21.400

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:24.810
 comment on beauty
