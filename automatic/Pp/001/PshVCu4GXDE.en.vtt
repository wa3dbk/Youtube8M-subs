00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.619 

I<00:00:00.770> think<00:00:01.770> you<00:00:01.949> know<00:00:02.159> what<00:00:02.370> this<00:00:02.580> is<00:00:02.820> this<00:00:03.360> is<00:00:03.600> a

00:00:03.619 --> 00:00:03.629 
I think you know what this is this is a

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:06.920 
I think you know what this is this is a
brain<00:00:04.580> you<00:00:05.580> could<00:00:05.730> see<00:00:06.029> that<00:00:06.330> this<00:00:06.569> little

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
brain you could see that this little

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.440 
brain you could see that this little
Ridge<00:00:07.200> here<00:00:07.230> is<00:00:07.740> probably<00:00:08.730> part<00:00:09.150> of<00:00:09.269> the

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
Ridge here is probably part of the

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.480 
Ridge here is probably part of the
sphenoid<00:00:09.750> that<00:00:10.559> separates<00:00:11.280> the<00:00:13.490> anterior

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
sphenoid that separates the anterior

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.599 
sphenoid that separates the anterior
cranial<00:00:15.330> fossa<00:00:15.870> from<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:16.890> middle<00:00:17.250> cranial

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
cranial fossa from the middle cranial

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.900 
cranial fossa from the middle cranial
fossa<00:00:18.090> on<00:00:18.630> the<00:00:19.320> other<00:00:19.470> hand<00:00:19.830> this<00:00:20.490> looks<00:00:20.730> like

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
fossa on the other hand this looks like

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.150 
fossa on the other hand this looks like
it<00:00:21.090> might<00:00:21.300> be<00:00:21.480> part<00:00:21.779> of<00:00:21.869> the<00:00:22.020> tentorium<00:00:22.560> here

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
it might be part of the tentorium here

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.670 
it might be part of the tentorium here
that<00:00:23.670> separates<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.480> middle<00:00:24.810> cranial<00:00:25.199> fossa

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
that separates the middle cranial fossa

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.429 
that separates the middle cranial fossa
in<00:00:26.430> which<00:00:26.580> the<00:00:26.730> temporal<00:00:27.180> lobes<00:00:27.420> like<00:00:27.750> from

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
in which the temporal lobes like from

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.550 
in which the temporal lobes like from
this<00:00:28.619> posterior<00:00:29.340> cranial<00:00:29.910> fossa<00:00:30.449> which<00:00:30.900> the

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
this posterior cranial fossa which the

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.430 
this posterior cranial fossa which the
cerebellum<00:00:32.279> lies<00:00:32.489> inand<00:00:33.030> I<00:00:33.090> believe<00:00:33.510> I<00:00:33.930> would

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
cerebellum lies inand I believe I would

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.790 
cerebellum lies inand I believe I would
probably<00:00:35.070> call<00:00:35.280> that<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.790> foramen<00:00:36.180> magnum

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:36.800 
probably call that the foramen magnum

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.340 
probably call that the foramen magnum
what<00:00:37.800> you<00:00:37.980> see<00:00:38.360> exactly<00:00:39.360> in<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.750> area<00:00:40.140> where

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
what you see exactly in the area where

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.310 
what you see exactly in the area where
the<00:00:40.500> pituitary<00:00:40.860> should<00:00:41.579> be<00:00:41.820> is<00:00:42.030> a<00:00:42.420> large<00:00:42.899> tumor

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
the pituitary should be is a large tumor

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.350 
the pituitary should be is a large tumor
that<00:00:43.680> looks<00:00:43.920> like<00:00:44.100> it's<00:00:44.370> about<00:00:44.520> three<00:00:44.670> or<00:00:45.090> four

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
that looks like it's about three or four

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.869 
that looks like it's about three or four
centimeters<00:00:45.750> in<00:00:46.200> diameter<00:00:46.410> has<00:00:46.950> a<00:00:47.340> very

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
centimeters in diameter has a very

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.720 
centimeters in diameter has a very
smooth<00:00:48.300> capsule<00:00:48.989> here's<00:00:49.890> another<00:00:50.190> picture<00:00:50.489> of

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
smooth capsule here's another picture of

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.979 
smooth capsule here's another picture of
it<00:00:51.030> and<00:00:52.489> you<00:00:53.489> know<00:00:53.699> that<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.149> pituitary<00:00:54.510> is

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
it and you know that the pituitary is

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.529 
it and you know that the pituitary is
only<00:00:55.230> about<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.710> size<00:00:55.739> of<00:00:56.190> a<00:00:56.309> pea<00:00:56.579> but<00:00:57.270> look

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
only about the size of a pea but look

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.110 
only about the size of a pea but look
this<00:00:57.809> is<00:00:57.870> a<00:00:58.020> massive<00:00:58.620> tumor<00:00:58.920> this<00:00:59.670> looks<00:00:59.969> like

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
this is a massive tumor this looks like

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.180 
this is a massive tumor this looks like
it's<00:01:00.329> about<00:01:00.449> as<00:01:00.809> big<00:01:01.079> as<00:01:01.140> one<00:01:01.590> of<00:01:01.739> any<00:01:01.920> of<00:01:02.100> the

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
it's about as big as one of any of the

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.490 
it's about as big as one of any of the
temporal<00:01:02.670> lobes<00:01:02.910> and<00:01:03.390> if<00:01:03.660> you<00:01:03.809> project<00:01:04.350> this

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
temporal lobes and if you project this

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.800 
temporal lobes and if you project this
down<00:01:04.799> once<00:01:05.159> again<00:01:05.489> it<00:01:05.939> looks<00:01:06.180> it<00:01:06.390> gets<00:01:06.540> about

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
down once again it looks it gets about

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.140 
down once again it looks it gets about
roughly<00:01:07.770> spherical<00:01:08.400> and<00:01:08.580> three<00:01:08.820> to<00:01:08.939> four

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
roughly spherical and three to four

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.690 
roughly spherical and three to four
centimeters<00:01:09.510> in<00:01:09.960> diameter<00:01:10.280> let's<00:01:11.280> look<00:01:11.460> at<00:01:11.580> it

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
centimeters in diameter let's look at it

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.520 
centimeters in diameter let's look at it
microscopically<00:01:13.460> you<00:01:14.460> could<00:01:14.700> see<00:01:15.000> that<00:01:15.840> like

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
microscopically you could see that like

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.710 
microscopically you could see that like
many<00:01:16.799> tumors<00:01:17.250> it's<00:01:17.520> basically<00:01:18.030> a<00:01:18.590> uniform

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:20.720 
many tumors it's basically a uniform

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.210 
many tumors it's basically a uniform
proliferation<00:01:21.720> of<00:01:21.930> basically<00:01:22.470> one<00:01:22.799> kind<00:01:23.100> of

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
proliferation of basically one kind of

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.380 
proliferation of basically one kind of
cell<00:01:24.049> and<00:01:25.049> you<00:01:25.799> know<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.130> pituitary<00:01:26.460> has<00:01:27.150> an

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
cell and you know the pituitary has an

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.200 
cell and you know the pituitary has an
anterior<00:01:28.049> lobe<00:01:28.259> in<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.530> posterior<00:01:29.100> lobe<00:01:29.490> the

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
anterior lobe in the posterior lobe the

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.270 
anterior lobe in the posterior lobe the
posterior<00:01:30.659> lobe<00:01:31.110> looks<00:01:31.409> like<00:01:31.590> brain<00:01:31.890> and<00:01:32.189> the

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
posterior lobe looks like brain and the

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.399 
posterior lobe looks like brain and the
anterior<00:01:32.790> lobe<00:01:33.000> looks<00:01:33.299> like<00:01:33.509> glands<00:01:33.869> and

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
anterior lobe looks like glands and

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.109 
anterior lobe looks like glands and
almost<00:01:35.040> all<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.340> tumors<00:01:35.729> are<00:01:35.909> in<00:01:36.030> the

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
almost all the tumors are in the

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.600 
almost all the tumors are in the
anterior<00:01:36.659> lobe<00:01:36.900> anyway<00:01:37.350> and<00:01:37.590> because<00:01:38.400> there's

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
anterior lobe anyway and because there's

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:39.950 
anterior lobe anyway and because there's
only<00:01:38.700> three<00:01:38.820> kinds<00:01:39.210> of<00:01:39.450> cells<00:01:39.689> in<00:01:39.930> the

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
only three kinds of cells in the

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.410 
only three kinds of cells in the
anterior<00:01:40.560> lobe<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:41.610> heceta<00:01:41.939> fills<00:01:42.240> the

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
anterior lobe the heceta fills the

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.020 
anterior lobe the heceta fills the
basophils<00:01:42.810> in<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.229> chromosomes<00:01:43.890> I<00:01:44.189> gotta<00:01:44.939> do

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
basophils in the chromosomes I gotta do

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.819 
basophils in the chromosomes I gotta do
is<00:01:45.149> figure<00:01:45.390> out<00:01:45.540> which<00:01:45.840> kind<00:01:46.140> of<00:01:46.259> cell<00:01:46.500> this

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
is figure out which kind of cell this

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.120 
is figure out which kind of cell this
looks<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.490> most<00:01:47.640> like<00:01:47.869> and<00:01:48.869> you<00:01:49.590> got<00:01:49.770> yourself

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
looks the most like and you got yourself

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.660 
looks the most like and you got yourself
a<00:01:50.250> diagnosis<00:01:51.060> this<00:01:51.270> seems<00:01:51.509> to<00:01:51.689> be<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:52.079> general

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
a diagnosis this seems to be the general

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.260 
a diagnosis this seems to be the general
type<00:01:53.670> of<00:01:53.700> pattern<00:01:54.360> in<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:55.219> gland<00:01:56.219> notice<00:01:57.090> that

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
type of pattern in the gland notice that

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.660 
type of pattern in the gland notice that
all<00:01:57.540> these<00:01:57.810> little<00:01:58.140> septa<00:01:58.890> here<00:01:59.219> are<00:01:59.399> not<00:01:59.549> only

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
all these little septa here are not only

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.179 
all these little septa here are not only
fibrous<00:02:00.210> tissue<00:02:00.450> but<00:02:01.350> they<00:02:01.590> are<00:02:01.649> carrying

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
fibrous tissue but they are carrying

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.630 
fibrous tissue but they are carrying
rich<00:02:02.579> blood<00:02:03.000> vessels<00:02:03.509> to<00:02:03.960> supply<00:02:04.950> all<00:02:05.430> of

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
rich blood vessels to supply all of

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.940 
rich blood vessels to supply all of
these<00:02:05.850> cells<00:02:06.149> now<00:02:06.479> if<00:02:07.049> you<00:02:07.170> go<00:02:07.350> back<00:02:07.380> to<00:02:07.770> your

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
these cells now if you go back to your

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.140 
these cells now if you go back to your
histology<00:02:08.700> and<00:02:08.989> take<00:02:09.989> a<00:02:10.020> picture<00:02:10.349> of<00:02:10.530> this<00:02:10.800> and

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
histology and take a picture of this and

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.260

nurture non endocrine glands like for

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
nurture non endocrine glands like for
