dead<00:00:23.369> yeah<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:24.600> iphone<00:00:24.840> 6<00:00:25.080> is<00:00:25.410> definitely

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
dead yeah the iphone 6 is definitely

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.000 
dead yeah the iphone 6 is definitely
easier<00:00:26.250> to<00:00:26.640> hold<00:00:27.320> and<00:00:28.320> it's<00:00:28.590> probably<00:00:28.740> one<00:00:28.980> of

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
easier to hold and it's probably one of

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.269 
easier to hold and it's probably one of
the<00:00:29.189> most<00:00:29.670> best<00:00:30.539> slices<00:00:31.260> here<00:00:31.289> for<00:00:31.830> the

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
the most best slices here for the

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.760 
the most best slices here for the
average<00:00:32.430> consumer<00:00:32.700> because<00:00:33.600> is<00:00:34.050> so<00:00:34.469> easy<00:00:34.649> to

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
average consumer because is so easy to

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.280 
average consumer because is so easy to
hold<00:00:35.070> but<00:00:36.059> it's<00:00:36.210> just<00:00:36.390> like<00:00:36.630> a<00:00:36.660> smaller

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
hold but it's just like a smaller

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.229 
hold but it's just like a smaller
variant<00:00:37.860> of<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.070> iphone<00:00:38.280> 6<00:00:38.399> plus<00:00:38.520> with<00:00:39.210> a

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
variant of the iphone 6 plus with a

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.549 
variant of the iphone 6 plus with a
worse<00:00:39.480> camera<00:00:40.399> still<00:00:41.399> sinking<00:00:41.850> a<00:00:41.940> lockdown

00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:42.559 
worse camera still sinking a lockdown

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
that many improvements over the years as

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.350 
that many improvements over the years as
Android<00:02:08.550> has<00:02:08.789> been<00:02:09.030> always<00:02:09.390> constantly

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
Android has been always constantly

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.350 
Android has been always constantly
adding<00:02:11.080> new<00:02:11.260> features<00:02:11.500> the<00:02:12.280> tunnel<00:02:12.880> toggles

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
adding new features the tunnel toggles

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.360 
adding new features the tunnel toggles
in<00:02:13.600> here<00:02:13.900> here<00:02:14.410> we<00:02:14.560> only<00:02:14.680> have<00:02:14.860> five<00:02:15.160> different

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
in here here we only have five different

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.420 
in here here we only have five different
toggle<00:02:15.940> so<00:02:16.060> you<00:02:16.150> can<00:02:16.300> change<00:02:16.600> between<00:02:17.430> and

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
toggle so you can change between and

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.070 
toggle so you can change between and
then<00:02:18.640> you<00:02:18.790> have<00:02:18.910> to<00:02:19.030> go<00:02:19.180> into<00:02:19.450> settings<00:02:19.900> area

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
then you have to go into settings area

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.540 
then you have to go into settings area
if<00:02:20.320> you<00:02:20.470> want<00:02:20.710> to<00:02:20.800> change<00:02:21.790> something<00:02:22.210> but<00:02:22.780> then

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
if you want to change something but then

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.000 
if you want to change something but then
we<00:02:24.550> do<00:02:24.670> have<00:02:24.760> multitasking<00:02:25.150> button<00:02:25.600> here<00:02:25.840> and

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
we do have multitasking button here and

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.570 
we do have multitasking button here and
a<00:02:27.010> brand<00:02:27.310> new<00:02:27.400> user<00:02:27.910> interface<00:02:28.060> for<00:02:28.840> that<00:02:29.020> so

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
a brand new user interface for that so

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.160 
a brand new user interface for that so
let's<00:02:30.580> compare<00:02:30.880> multitasking<00:02:31.660> here<00:02:31.900> a<00:02:31.930> little

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
let's compare multitasking here a little

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:37.970 
let's compare multitasking here a little
bit<00:02:34.740> so<00:02:35.740> here<00:02:35.980> you<00:02:36.160> do<00:02:36.280> have<00:02:36.310> no<00:02:36.640> more<00:02:36.880> swiped

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
bit so here you do have no more swiped

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.300 
bit so here you do have no more swiped
and<00:02:39.900> just<00:02:40.900> open<00:02:41.050> up<00:02:41.320> some<00:02:41.560> more<00:02:41.770> things<00:02:42.100> in

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
and just open up some more things in

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:51.910 
and just open up some more things in
here

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.710 

so<00:02:52.920> you<00:02:53.040> can<00:02:53.220> see<00:02:53.370> here<00:02:53.670> you<00:02:53.849> have<00:02:53.880> this<00:02:54.150> kind

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
so you can see here you have this kind

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:02.960 
so you can see here you have this kind
of<00:02:54.840> like<00:02:55.050> sort<00:02:55.290> of<00:02:55.349> swype<00:02:55.860> py<00:03:01.730> which<00:03:02.730> i<00:03:02.910> think

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
of like sort of swype py which i think

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.330 
of like sort of swype py which i think
looks<00:03:03.360> a<00:03:03.660> little<00:03:03.780> bit<00:03:03.930> more<00:03:04.110> badass<00:03:04.349> and<00:03:05.010> the

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
looks a little bit more badass and the

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.090

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.000 
difference there on the iphone side
definitely<00:04:36.360> not<00:04:36.870> is<00:04:37.080> slightly<00:04:37.470> improving

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.010 
definitely not is slightly improving

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:40.610 
definitely not is slightly improving
performance<00:04:38.250> but<00:04:38.880> yeah<00:04:39.570> it's<00:04:39.960> not<00:04:40.350> a<00:04:40.380> big

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:40.620 
performance but yeah it's not a big

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.159 
performance but yeah it's not a big
thing<00:04:41.240> you<00:04:42.240> do<00:04:42.419> get<00:04:42.600> a<00:04:42.630> little<00:04:42.750> bit<00:04:42.990> big

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:43.169 
thing you do get a little bit big

the with the galaxy note update and
because<00:04:51.840> i'm<00:04:51.930> pretty<00:04:52.050> sure<00:04:52.260> the<00:04:52.410> galaxy<00:04:52.830> note

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860 
because i'm pretty sure the galaxy note

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.300 
because i'm pretty sure the galaxy note
3<00:04:53.310> year<00:04:53.789> had<00:04:54.389> the

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:55.310 
3 year had the

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:58.660 
3 year had the
it's<00:04:55.490> not<00:04:55.580> going<00:04:55.790> to<00:04:55.880> 800<00:04:56.420> inside<00:04:57.410> and<00:04:57.830> now<00:04:58.610> you

00:04:58.660 --> 00:04:58.670 
it's not going to 800 inside and now you

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:01.060 
it's not going to 800 inside and now you
do<00:04:58.940> get<00:04:59.090> something<00:04:59.420> in<00:04:59.510> 805<00:05:00.200> instead<00:05:00.830> of<00:05:00.860> this

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:01.070 
do get something in 805 instead of this

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:04.300 
do get something in 805 instead of this
baby<00:05:01.310> it<00:05:02.030> definitely<00:05:02.690> performs<00:05:03.350> way<00:05:04.070> better

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:04.310 
baby it definitely performs way better

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:07.630 
baby it definitely performs way better
