00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.390
 Hey, what 's up, what 's the radio line with 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:09.330
 one more tutorial for you there 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:13.490
 and today I'll teach you how you solved it 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:16.289
 the problem of off-scale that is the 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:20.730
 resolution of its overall strike character 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:24.570
 offensive with your monitor resolution 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:27.449
 I play on a monitor here , actually. 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.619
 a perception is not a 42 LED TV 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.399
 inches 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:35.250
 but this is for any pc tv 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:37.590
 monitor tv monitor or even your 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:41.940
 monitor is dull smaller than 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:46.140
 You have so I have space here. 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:48.059
 I have a more complex complex 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:53.160
 plus the two will solve the problem and 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:55.289
 of its resolution the first so that 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.379
 extra caution and have the instinct 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:01.469
 this is going to open that steam 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:09.119
 that's the easy part will come there 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:13.439
 here in sting it will not turn that the 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:15.360
 library all the games right here at 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.009
 moment I only have four global pond 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.830
 and the king turned off 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:25.250
 then I came right here on top 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:27.689
 of cartel strike and properties and flight 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:30.180
 iraq will have all these settings 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:34.680
 neighbors here I came here to define 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:36.750
 boot options I'll leave in the 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:41.150
 description of the video there but you will have 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:53.970
 you type following command h 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:56.939
 space 800 is dash 600 w16 space 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:02:02.369
 the configuration that we will give in cs 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:04.380
 so it can start with resolution 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:08.399
 smaller for those who are giving the error off 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:12.030
 and you are not able to start 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:13.380
 Your game will be able to have fun. 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:17.670

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:21.060

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:42.120
 Come in because you have ssd. 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:47.090
