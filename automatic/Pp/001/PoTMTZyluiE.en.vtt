00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:10.320
 Hello everyone, so welcome, you love me 

00:00:07.769 --> 00:00:12.269
 today I bring you a tiny hall is 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.700
 also if that is really tiny and 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.800
 is that I buy a couple of things from mac 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.290
 and the truth is that I did not know whether to teach you 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.989
 in the big hall or make a separate 

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:24.270
 because they are tiny but good at the end 

00:00:21.989 --> 00:00:26.610
 I decided to do it separately because there is only one 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:30.270
 you're interested in mac things 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:32.160
 a separate little hall so I do not 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:33.780
 I laugh a lot more and it starts telling me 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.190
 nothing like the end there's always someone 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.890
 who asks me I'm going to tell you what 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:41.010
 I have on my lips what I wear is this 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.230
 kiko lip gloss and style 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.850
 I think you know what they are and well this 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.850
 It's 814 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.870
 and this is because purple rosita 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.360
 I wear purple tirana 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.920
 blurred the truth because I wanted that 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.559
 It tells me a little bit of color, but well 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.020
 it's very cute so that's what I recommend and 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:04.890
 I start now 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:07.780
 first of all say that I am not very 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.570
 but I also want to say that I'm not 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.970
 very in favor of buying in brand by the 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:15.310
 theme that you are in animals and is 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.080
 something that was good I recognize that there 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:20.140
 little things that others do not have 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:22.750
 brands that in certain products are the 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:25.270
 better and sometimes it costs a lot 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:28.030
 resist as happened to me this time and 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:30.100
 piquÃ© si piquÃ© I went shopping with my 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.200
 sister-in-law and it's a bad influence so 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.160
 At the end I piqued in two little things that 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.880
 I'm going to teach you 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:40.920
 I begin with this, for example, 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:45.300
 I bought the prolong eyeliner which is a 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:47.909
 pencil eyeliner this is in the black tone 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:50.640
 ice 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.350
 and well I think you already know a little 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.569
 more you know the good shape of these 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.549
 pencils because apart from this super 

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:58.710
 intense super pigmented once it 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.509
 they fix there is no one who erases them the truth 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.130
 there I do recognize that there are few 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:05.609
 brands that make such a good product 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.580
 like this what I told you a pencil 

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:12.220
 eyes 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:12.220
 this is in the black tone 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:22.450
 it's pretty creamy I was painting super super 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:25.150
 black and as I'm telling you it's waterproof no 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:28.030
 there is someone who moves it from the eye the truth is 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:31.660
 that lasts me all the day and for 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:35.349
 I bought that because it's awesome 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:38.650
 it's a very, very good product and the 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:41.590
 price of this is 21 euros is expensive 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:43.540
 but good sometimes the quality that stops 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:47.049
 the other one that I bought is this here is 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:50.620
 a cream of these multipurpose that sell 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:52.180
 in mac they want more products in 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.310
 cream that can be used both for 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:57.730
 the cheeks as for the eyelids as 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:03:01.250
 for the lips has many uses 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:04.940
 the truth the color the tone 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:07.890
 the tone that I bought myself you leave and I 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:10.800
 I teach now when I get it open 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:13.390
 well this brings your prospect of these 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:16.540
 types to the doctor 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:21.690
 in formats that serve both this one and 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:24.090
 the like the pencil for the bat schumacher 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:28.340
 and good as I say is a product 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:28.340
 in cream this is a peach tone 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:33.290
 frosty is not a smooth tone has like 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:37.220
 a slight reflection the truth is that I 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:39.200
 It seemed super nice and I'm going to tell you what 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.790
 I will associate but I will not put my finger 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.099
 because you already know that these products in 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:45.799
 cream they have in mind the ego is a 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:48.200
 I keep the truth because it is not nothing 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:50.940
 hygienic so I'm going to take it out with the 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:53.130
 Brush 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.050
 I do not think he's going to notice much because 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:57.520
 It is a tone quite similar to my skin 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:04:00.310
 it's over here 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:03.670
 I think you're not going to see it but hey 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:06.250
 about everything I bought for the base for 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:08.440
 shadows for the lips for some day 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:10.780
 I want to go a bit more newt it seems to me 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:13.180
 which is a color that will be very useful to me 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.800
 I'm going to give you an infinity of uses and not 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.150
 you would be forgotten because the truth 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.400
 is that it bothers me a bit to spend the 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:20.350
 money if then I do not see it I prefer 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:22.120
 spend it on things that I know I'm going to use 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:24.640
 and I'm going to finish and the price of this 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:27.130
 Multipurpose cream is 19 with 50 up 

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:29.920
 here the hall and I told you that it was something very 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:31.690
 cortito are two things told but 

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:34.330
 Well, I really wanted to teach 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:35.800
 others since they are not are not things that 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:38.530
 only to buy the truth is that german 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:40.330
 I do not usually buy practically ever and 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:42.160
 if I buy then they are things that for me 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:44.290
 They are worth the money 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.000
 that's why I want to teach them also and 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:47.410
 nothing up here the video I hope that you 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.600
 have liked as you always liked 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:52.440
 hit like and see you in the next 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.440
 bye
