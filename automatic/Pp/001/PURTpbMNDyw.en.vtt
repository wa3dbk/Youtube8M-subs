00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.800 
against them and there's a lot riding on
that<00:04:48.560> game<00:04:48.980> because<00:04:49.940> of<00:04:50.270> these<00:04:50.450> circumstances

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:50.810 
that game because of these circumstances

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:53.050 
that game because of these circumstances
of<00:04:51.440> if<00:04:51.740> we<00:04:52.100> didn't<00:04:52.310> get<00:04:52.430> a<00:04:52.460> result<00:04:52.790> there<00:04:52.940> we

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:53.060 
of if we didn't get a result there we

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:55.150 
of if we didn't get a result there we
get<00:04:53.240> relegated<00:04:53.810> but<00:04:54.410> we<00:04:54.650> ended<00:04:54.860> up<00:04:54.950> winning

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:55.160 
get relegated but we ended up winning

get relegated but we ended up winning
the<00:04:55.400> game<00:04:55.510> which<00:04:56.510> I<00:04:56.750> don't<00:04:56.840> think<00:04:57.050> anyone

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:57.290 
the game which I don't think anyone

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:59.190 
the game which I don't think anyone
believed<00:04:57.590> I<00:04:57.740> think<00:04:57.980> everyone<00:04:58.820> on<00:04:58.850> our<00:04:58.910> team

00:04:59.190 --> 00:04:59.200 
believed I think everyone on our team

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:02.290 
believed I think everyone on our team
felt<00:05:00.200> we'd<00:05:00.410> be<00:05:00.530> able<00:05:00.620> to<00:05:00.770> to<00:05:01.460> get<00:05:01.610> a<00:05:01.640> draw<00:05:01.910> but

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:02.300 
felt we'd be able to to get a draw but

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:05.500 
felt we'd be able to to get a draw but
I'm<00:05:02.480> not<00:05:02.630> sure<00:05:02.780> if<00:05:02.870> anyone<00:05:03.140> expected<00:05:03.680> a<00:05:03.860> win<00:05:04.550> in

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:05.510 
I'm not sure if anyone expected a win in

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:14.049 
I'm not sure if anyone expected a win in
front<00:05:05.900> of<00:05:07.120> 74,000<00:05:08.170> Manchester<00:05:09.170> United<00:05:09.470> fans

00:05:14.049 --> 00:05:14.059 

00:05:14.059 --> 00:05:16.419 

the<00:05:14.719> funny<00:05:14.869> thing<00:05:15.079> is<00:05:15.110> even<00:05:15.679> though<00:05:16.189> we<00:05:16.309> got

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:16.429 
the funny thing is even though we got

00:05:16.429 --> 00:05:19.029 
the funny thing is even though we got
like<00:05:16.759> 16<00:05:17.629> to<00:05:17.719> 15<00:05:17.839> this<00:05:18.319> season<00:05:18.679> if<00:05:18.769> we'd<00:05:18.919> have

00:05:19.029 --> 00:05:19.039 
like 16 to 15 this season if we'd have

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:22.629 
like 16 to 15 this season if we'd have
won<00:05:19.509> the<00:05:20.509> last<00:05:20.659> game<00:05:21.069> we<00:05:22.069> could<00:05:22.219> have<00:05:22.339> got<00:05:22.459> like

00:05:22.629 --> 00:05:22.639 
won the last game we could have got like

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:24.429 
won the last game we could have got like
you<00:05:23.239> know<00:05:23.360> like<00:05:23.539> 13th<00:05:24.019> or<00:05:24.169> something<00:05:24.379> like

00:05:24.429 --> 00:05:24.439

that
which<00:05:25.459> is<00:05:25.610> crazy<00:05:25.819> to<00:05:26.149> think<00:05:26.179> that<00:05:26.419> we<00:05:27.110> were

00:05:27.219 --> 00:05:27.229 
which is crazy to think that we were

00:05:27.229 --> 00:05:29.199 
which is crazy to think that we were
pretty<00:05:27.589> much<00:05:27.769> a<00:05:27.799> game<00:05:28.069> away<00:05:28.339> from<00:05:28.369> relegation

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:29.209 
pretty much a game away from relegation

00:05:29.209 --> 00:05:32.679 
pretty much a game away from relegation
