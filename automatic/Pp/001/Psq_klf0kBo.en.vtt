I'm not using this protocol and I I'm

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.509 
I'm not using this protocol and I I'm
thinking<00:01:02.550> it<00:01:02.730> just<00:01:02.760> will<00:01:03.329> be<00:01:03.480> overwhelming

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:04.519 
thinking it just will be overwhelming

command<00:01:05.519> station<00:01:06.030> but<00:01:06.299> just<00:01:06.510> my<00:01:06.659> theory<00:01:07.110> okay

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070

to<00:01:09.060> connect<00:01:10.189> navigator<00:01:11.189> you<00:01:11.850> just<00:01:12.060> need<00:01:12.240> to

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
to connect navigator you just need to

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.890 
to connect navigator you just need to
use<00:01:12.540> two<00:01:12.960> wires<00:01:13.229> of<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:13.890> back<00:01:14.460> of<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:15.240> output

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
use two wires of the back of the output

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:22.460 
use two wires of the back of the output
the<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:17.490> command<00:01:17.909> station<00:01:18.770> to<00:01:20.570> eCos<00:01:21.600> special

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
the the command station to eCos special

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:28.160 
the the command station to eCos special
port<00:01:22.770> snuffer<00:01:23.490> just<00:01:24.360> two<00:01:25.850> wires<00:01:26.850> so<00:01:27.659> now<00:01:27.900> they

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
port snuffer just two wires so now they

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.440 
port snuffer just two wires so now they
connected<00:01:28.770> to<00:01:29.759> each<00:01:29.880> other

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450

the<00:01:31.380> trick<00:01:31.710> is<00:01:33.380> eCos<00:01:34.380> translates<00:01:36.470> commands

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
the trick is eCos translates commands

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.969 
the trick is eCos translates commands
from<00:01:38.659> actually<00:01:39.659> any<00:01:39.900> digital<00:01:40.439> system<00:01:40.500> I

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
from actually any digital system I

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.179 
from actually any digital system I
tested<00:01:41.970> it<00:01:42.060> as<00:01:42.270> well<00:01:42.600> with<00:01:42.810> lens<00:01:43.140> and<00:01:43.470> it's

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
tested it as well with lens and it's

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.499 
tested it as well with lens and it's
working<00:01:44.460> perfectly<00:01:45.119> to<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:47.509> locomotive

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
working perfectly to the locomotive

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:54.850 
working perfectly to the locomotive
assign<00:01:49.439> and<00:01:50.840> to<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:51.990> specific<00:01:53.509> address

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
assign and to the specific address

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.149 
assign and to the specific address
called<00:01:55.860> snuffer<00:01:56.460> address<00:01:56.969> then<00:01:57.840> all<00:01:58.290> commands

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
called snuffer address then all commands

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.889 
called snuffer address then all commands
going<00:02:00.140> to<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.320> decoder<00:02:01.680> through<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.899> digital

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
going to the decoder through the digital

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:11.540 
going to the decoder through the digital
system<00:02:05.990> so<00:02:06.990> now<00:02:07.229> I<00:02:07.910> have<00:02:08.910> two<00:02:09.149> locals<00:02:10.370> sorry<00:02:11.370> if

it's

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
it's

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.899 
it's
that's<00:02:13.440> good<00:02:13.680> I<00:02:13.860> have<00:02:14.310> two<00:02:14.519> locals

three since in that Marklin locomotive
140<00:02:39.989> there<00:02:40.650> is<00:02:41.450> sound<00:02:42.450> m<00:02:43.019> FX<00:02:43.980> install<00:02:44.579> and<00:02:45.030> i

140 there is sound m FX install and i

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:48.199 
140 there is sound m FX install and i
really<00:02:46.440> care<00:02:46.620> less<00:02:46.890> which<00:02:47.340> addresses<00:02:47.849> right

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
really care less which addresses right

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:51.770 
really care less which addresses right
now<00:02:48.890> because<00:02:49.890> it<00:02:50.160> saves<00:02:50.519> in<00:02:50.790> the<00:02:51.030> command

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780

it's this is the best feature of the
system<00:04:38.259> and<00:04:38.650> actually<00:04:38.800> I<00:04:39.009> like<00:04:39.280> it<00:04:39.310> a<00:04:39.580> lot<00:04:39.759> very

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:40.360

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:52.810 
locomotive under function for there we

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:57.330 
locomotive under function for there we
go<00:04:53.639> it's<00:04:54.639> actually<00:04:55.060> yellow<00:04:55.419> but<00:04:55.780> camera<00:04:56.340> not

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:57.340 
go it's actually yellow but camera not

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:02.610 
go it's actually yellow but camera not
catching<00:04:57.880> that<00:04:58.060> color<00:04:59.849> a<00:05:00.849> yellow<00:05:01.509> LED<00:05:01.690> that's

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:02.620 
catching that color a yellow LED that's

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:06.839 
catching that color a yellow LED that's
probably<00:05:03.070> the<00:05:03.759> reason<00:05:03.960> turn<00:05:04.960> the<00:05:05.110> lights<00:05:05.849> see

00:05:06.839 --> 00:05:06.849 
probably the reason turn the lights see

00:05:06.849 --> 00:05:09.330 
probably the reason turn the lights see
the<00:05:07.030> lights<00:05:07.240> and<00:05:07.509> just<00:05:08.410> will<00:05:08.680> quit<00:05:08.949> start

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:09.340 
the lights and just will quit start

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:14.189 
the lights and just will quit start
running<00:05:09.820> it<00:05:09.970> it<00:05:10.840> has<00:05:11.139> no<00:05:11.349> sound<00:05:11.620> adjust<00:05:13.199> model

running it it has no sound adjust model
decoder<00:05:14.590> installed<00:05:15.180> okay<00:05:16.620> turn<00:05:17.620> it<00:05:17.650> off<00:05:18.449> going

00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:19.449 
decoder installed okay turn it off going

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:23.100 
decoder installed okay turn it off going
back<00:05:19.690> to<00:05:19.720> my<00:05:21.210> morphing<00:05:22.210> locomotive<00:05:22.900> with

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:23.110 
back to my morphing locomotive with

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:29.990 
back to my morphing locomotive with
motorola<00:05:24.659> address<00:05:25.659> and<00:05:26.110> turn<00:05:27.010> the<00:05:27.220> sound<00:05:27.430> off

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:30.000 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.790 

okay<00:05:31.000> so<00:05:32.340> hopefully<00:05:33.340> you<00:05:33.760> understand<00:05:34.389> what<00:05:35.289> my

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:35.800 
okay so hopefully you understand what my

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:43.490 
okay so hopefully you understand what my
point<00:05:36.190> was<00:05:37.770> you<00:05:38.770> have<00:05:40.050> easy<00:05:41.050> way<00:05:41.500> to<00:05:42.190> use

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:43.500 
point was you have easy way to use

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:46.860 
point was you have easy way to use
navigator<00:05:44.500> with<00:05:44.889> echoes<00:05:45.820> as<00:05:46.120> a<00:05:46.180> wireless

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:46.870 
navigator with echoes as a wireless

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:50.610 
navigator with echoes as a wireless
throttle<00:05:47.650> and<00:05:47.860> you<00:05:48.729> can<00:05:48.970> add<00:05:49.210> up<00:05:49.599> to<00:05:50.050> four

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:50.620 
throttle and you can add up to four

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:54.540 
throttle and you can add up to four
throttles<00:05:51.310> to<00:05:52.289> navigator<00:05:53.289> and<00:05:53.620> also<00:05:54.340> i

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:54.550 
throttles to navigator and also i

00:05:54.550 --> 00:06:00.170 
throttles to navigator and also i
believe<00:05:54.789> it's<00:05:55.419> for<00:05:56.310> additional<00:05:58.440> infrared

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:00.180 
believe it's for additional infrared

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:03.719 
believe it's for additional infrared
devices<00:06:01.180> so<00:06:01.870> you<00:06:01.900> can<00:06:02.110> put<00:06:02.650> like<00:06:02.889> trim<00:06:03.370> around

00:06:03.719 --> 00:06:03.729 
devices so you can put like trim around

00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:05.879 
devices so you can put like trim around
perimeter<00:06:04.599> of<00:06:04.630> your<00:06:04.810> room<00:06:05.169> and<00:06:05.440> it<00:06:05.590> will<00:06:05.740> be<00:06:05.860> a

00:06:05.879 --> 00:06:05.889 
perimeter of your room and it will be a

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:09.170 
perimeter of your room and it will be a
hundred<00:06:06.130> percent<00:06:07.199> accessible<00:06:08.199> in<00:06:08.590> different

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:09.180 
hundred percent accessible in different

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:13.589 
hundred percent accessible in different
areas<00:06:10.180> of<00:06:10.210> your<00:06:10.830> layout<00:06:11.830> if<00:06:12.280> it's<00:06:13.000> a<00:06:13.150> small

00:06:13.589 --> 00:06:13.599 
areas of your layout if it's a small

00:06:13.599 --> 00:06:19.950 
areas of your layout if it's a small
room<00:06:13.870> or<00:06:14.080> big<00:06:14.500> room<00:06:14.800> so<00:06:15.900> that<00:06:18.450> will<00:06:19.450> be<00:06:19.599> all<00:06:19.930> for

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:19.960 
room or big room so that will be all for

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:21.600 
room or big room so that will be all for
today

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:21.610 
today

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:24.460 
today
it's<00:06:21.940> the<00:06:22.300> first<00:06:22.539> time<00:06:22.750> for<00:06:22.810> I<00:06:23.110> am<00:06:23.169> trying<00:06:23.529> this

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:24.470 
it's the first time for I am trying this

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:28.060 
it's the first time for I am trying this
I<00:06:24.800> believe<00:06:25.580> it's<00:06:25.760> a<00:06:25.850> lot<00:06:26.000> of<00:06:26.320> questions<00:06:27.320> will

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:28.070 
I believe it's a lot of questions will

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:32.560 
I believe it's a lot of questions will
come<00:06:28.100> up<00:06:28.960> but<00:06:29.960> as<00:06:30.740> soon<00:06:30.860> as<00:06:31.280> it's<00:06:31.570> translating

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:32.570 
come up but as soon as it's translating

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:35.110 
come up but as soon as it's translating
between<00:06:33.500> two<00:06:33.980> locomotives<00:06:34.370> I<00:06:34.790> have<00:06:34.970> no

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:35.120 
between two locomotives I have no

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:37.120 
between two locomotives I have no
problem<00:06:35.510> and<00:06:35.660> I<00:06:35.720> believe<00:06:35.780> the<00:06:36.260> system<00:06:36.470> capable

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:37.130 
problem and I believe the system capable

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:40.840 
problem and I believe the system capable
to<00:06:37.310> handle<00:06:37.520> more<00:06:39.460> simultaneously<00:06:40.460> running

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:40.850 
to handle more simultaneously running

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:44.320 
to handle more simultaneously running
locomotives<00:06:42.130> thank<00:06:43.130> you<00:06:43.220> very<00:06:43.370> much<00:06:43.610> and<00:06:43.850> have
