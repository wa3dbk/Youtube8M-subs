00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:27.440 
now i will say depending on the light
and<00:02:23.900> I<00:02:24.900> in<00:02:25.500> my<00:02:25.560> past<00:02:26.190> experience<00:02:26.820> with<00:02:27.030> it<00:02:27.270> it

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
and I in my past experience with it it

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.360 
and I in my past experience with it it
has<00:02:28.110> come<00:02:28.440> out<00:02:28.620> a<00:02:28.860> little<00:02:29.370> bit<00:02:29.960> grayish<00:02:30.960> a

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
has come out a little bit grayish a

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:40.040 
has come out a little bit grayish a
little<00:02:32.370> um<00:02:33.830> but<00:02:35.780> for<00:02:36.780> my<00:02:36.990> skin<00:02:37.470> color<00:02:37.770> I<00:02:39.050> think

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
little um but for my skin color I think

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:56.420

in<00:03:20.720> another<00:03:20.780> review<00:03:21.470> i<00:03:21.500> did<00:03:21.920> of<00:03:22.130> a<00:03:22.450> ole<00:03:23.450> a

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:23.630 
in another review i did of a ole a

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:26.410 
in another review i did of a ole a
product<00:03:24.280> where<00:03:25.280> my<00:03:25.400> face<00:03:25.610> was<00:03:25.670> going<00:03:26.239> through

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
product where my face was going through

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:27.280 
product where my face was going through
some<00:03:26.540> things<00:03:26.600> that<00:03:26.810> i<00:03:26.930> have<00:03:26.959> been<00:03:27.140> using

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
some things that i have been using

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.430 
some things that i have been using
retin-a<00:03:27.739> i'm<00:03:28.580> not<00:03:28.850> using<00:03:29.090> it<00:03:29.300> right<00:03:29.510> now<00:03:29.540> and<00:03:30.140> i

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
retin-a i'm not using it right now and i

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:36.670 
retin-a i'm not using it right now and i
probably<00:03:30.739> should<00:03:31.370> start<00:03:31.760> back<00:03:32.480> so<00:03:35.440> there<00:03:36.440> you

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
probably should start back so there you

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.300 
probably should start back so there you
have<00:03:36.709> it<00:03:37.010> I<00:03:37.430> mean<00:03:37.700> I<00:03:38.470> i<00:03:39.470> would<00:03:39.800> say<00:03:40.040> that<00:03:40.220> I'm

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
have it I mean I i would say that I'm

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:43.270 
have it I mean I i would say that I'm
camera<00:03:40.730> ready<00:03:40.910> I<00:03:41.239> think<00:03:42.200> that<00:03:42.440> it<00:03:42.650> provides<00:03:43.040> a

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
camera ready I think that it provides a

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.920 
camera ready I think that it provides a
nice<00:03:43.640> amount<00:03:44.150> of<00:03:44.480> coverage<00:03:46.180> there<00:03:47.180> are<00:03:47.420> times

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
nice amount of coverage there are times

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:51.400 
nice amount of coverage there are times
when<00:03:48.860> I<00:03:49.310> think<00:03:50.000> that<00:03:50.569> I<00:03:50.630> should<00:03:50.810> maybe<00:03:51.110> add

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
when I think that I should maybe add

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:56.070 
when I think that I should maybe add
something<00:03:51.769> like<00:03:52.420> would<00:03:53.420> my<00:03:53.450> well<00:03:53.870> use<00:03:54.230> fit<00:03:54.880> 355

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:56.080 
something like would my well use fit 355

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:59.350 
something like would my well use fit 355
on<00:03:57.080> top<00:03:57.410> of<00:03:57.620> it<00:03:57.739> if<00:03:58.010> I<00:03:58.430> just<00:03:58.640> want<00:03:58.850> to<00:03:58.970> blend<00:03:59.180> the

00:03:59.350 --> 00:03:59.360 
on top of it if I just want to blend the

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:00.970 
on top of it if I just want to blend the
color<00:03:59.600> bit<00:03:59.959> more<00:04:00.140> and<00:04:00.290> it<00:04:00.410> also<00:04:00.590> kind<00:04:00.920> of

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:00.980 
color bit more and it also kind of

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:03.220 
color bit more and it also kind of
depends<00:04:01.400> on<00:04:01.569> whether<00:04:02.569> or<00:04:02.660> not<00:04:02.750> I've<00:04:02.959> been<00:04:03.140> in

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230

see it in more colors I think that's one

that they only come in a limited number
of<00:05:01.729> colors<00:05:02.270> but<00:05:02.810> if<00:05:03.080> you<00:05:03.320> are<00:05:03.350> my<00:05:03.650> complexion

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:04.160 
of colors but if you are my complexion

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.930 
of colors but if you are my complexion
or<00:05:04.990> lighter<00:05:05.990> you<00:05:06.620> could<00:05:06.800> probably<00:05:07.100> find<00:05:07.729> one

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:07.940 
or lighter you could probably find one

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:10.330 
or lighter you could probably find one
of<00:05:08.389> I<00:05:08.600> believe<00:05:08.840> they<00:05:08.960> have<00:05:09.110> four<00:05:09.350> or<00:05:09.500> five<00:05:09.770> that

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:10.340 
of I believe they have four or five that

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:13.540 
of I believe they have four or five that
will<00:05:10.550> work<00:05:10.760> with<00:05:10.970> you<00:05:11.180> and<00:05:11.389> if<00:05:12.169> it's<00:05:13.160> obviously

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:13.550 
will work with you and if it's obviously

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:16.300 
will work with you and if it's obviously
not<00:05:13.639> going<00:05:13.850> to<00:05:13.970> be<00:05:14.090> an<00:05:14.240> exact<00:05:14.630> match<00:05:15.220> so<00:05:16.220> you

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:16.310 
not going to be an exact match so you

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:17.920 
not going to be an exact match so you
might<00:05:16.669> want<00:05:16.909> to<00:05:16.940> mix<00:05:17.180> it<00:05:17.419> you<00:05:17.570> know<00:05:17.659> after<00:05:17.780> you

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:17.930 
might want to mix it you know after you

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:20.950 
might want to mix it you know after you
put<00:05:18.110> it<00:05:18.200> on<00:05:18.320> maybe<00:05:18.979> as<00:05:19.159> like<00:05:19.340> a<00:05:19.430> primer<00:05:19.789> and<00:05:20.210> mix

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:20.960 
put it on maybe as like a primer and mix

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:21.410 
put it on maybe as like a primer and mix
it<00:05:21.110> in<00:05:21.200> with

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:21.420 
it in with

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:23.840 
it in with
what<00:05:21.510> your<00:05:21.660> favorite<00:05:21.990> foundation<00:05:22.200> is<00:05:22.710> so<00:05:23.430> I

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:23.850 
what your favorite foundation is so I

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:26.510 
what your favorite foundation is so I
would<00:05:24.360> give<00:05:24.630> the<00:05:25.140> Smashbox<00:05:25.980> camera-ready

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:26.520 
would give the Smashbox camera-ready

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.840 
would give the Smashbox camera-ready
actually<00:05:27.210> two<00:05:27.720> thumbs<00:05:28.020> up<00:05:28.230> I<00:05:28.500> will<00:05:29.100> use<00:05:29.370> it<00:05:29.610> and

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:29.850 
actually two thumbs up I will use it and

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:31.370 
actually two thumbs up I will use it and
like<00:05:29.970> I<00:05:30.060> said<00:05:30.120> I<00:05:30.270> probably<00:05:30.570> will<00:05:30.930> mix<00:05:31.200> it

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:31.380 
like I said I probably will mix it

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:33.440 
like I said I probably will mix it
depending<00:05:31.890> on<00:05:32.010> my<00:05:32.190> complexion<00:05:32.880> on<00:05:33.120> any<00:05:33.300> given

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:33.450 
depending on my complexion on any given

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:35.510 
depending on my complexion on any given
day<00:05:33.630> but<00:05:34.260> for<00:05:34.410> today<00:05:34.620> it<00:05:34.830> works<00:05:35.100> and<00:05:35.370> I<00:05:35.460> do

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:35.520 
day but for today it works and I do

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.460 
day but for today it works and I do
think<00:05:35.880> I'm<00:05:36.000> camera<00:05:36.360> ready<00:05:36.540> and<00:05:36.840> it<00:05:37.290> wasn't

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:37.470 
think I'm camera ready and it wasn't

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:39.260 
think I'm camera ready and it wasn't
that<00:05:37.710> mind<00:05:37.950> like<00:05:38.070> I<00:05:38.130> didn't<00:05:38.280> apply<00:05:38.520> a<00:05:38.550> lot<00:05:39.060> it

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:39.270 
that mind like I didn't apply a lot it

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:41.330 
that mind like I didn't apply a lot it
only<00:05:39.450> took<00:05:39.630> a<00:05:39.750> little<00:05:39.900> bit<00:05:40.110> and<00:05:40.350> this<00:05:40.770> isn't<00:05:41.190> a

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:41.340 
only took a little bit and this isn't a

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:44.810 
only took a little bit and this isn't a
great<00:05:41.700> big<00:05:42.120> it's<00:05:42.510> a<00:05:42.780> 1<00:05:43.440> fluid<00:05:43.650> ounce<00:05:43.860> but<00:05:44.520> this

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:44.820 
great big it's a 1 fluid ounce but this

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:46.820 
great big it's a 1 fluid ounce but this
amount<00:05:45.210> would<00:05:45.390> probably<00:05:45.930> last<00:05:46.140> me<00:05:46.440> for<00:05:46.710> at

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:46.830 
amount would probably last me for at

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:49.820 
amount would probably last me for at
least<00:05:47.100> three<00:05:48.030> months<00:05:48.240> so<00:05:49.230> it<00:05:49.380> is<00:05:49.500> little<00:05:49.740> I

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:49.830 
least three months so it is little I

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:51.710 
least three months so it is little I
think<00:05:49.860> it's<00:05:50.190> around<00:05:50.280> fifty<00:05:50.850> dollars<00:05:51.240> I'm<00:05:51.450> not
