you<00:04:15.790> can<00:04:15.940> calibrate<00:04:16.180> your<00:04:16.480> scores<00:04:16.989> and

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:17.230 
you can calibrate your scores and

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:19.920 
you can calibrate your scores and
everything<00:04:17.669> you<00:04:18.669> can<00:04:18.790> go<00:04:18.880> through<00:04:18.910> gate<00:04:19.329> in<00:04:19.780> it

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:19.930 
everything you can go through gate in it

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.530 
everything you can go through gate in it
so<00:04:20.680> you<00:04:20.739> get<00:04:20.919> some<00:04:21.160> point<00:04:21.400> you<00:04:21.850> got<00:04:22.000> multiplier

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:22.540 
so you get some point you got multiplier

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:25.440 
so you get some point you got multiplier
right<00:04:22.780> there<00:04:23.020> you<00:04:23.169> can<00:04:23.350> boost<00:04:24.180> make<00:04:25.180> sure<00:04:25.210> you

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:25.450 
right there you can boost make sure you

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:27.810 
right there you can boost make sure you

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:33.430 
the middle east again you can jump I

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:40.860 
the middle east again you can jump I
just<00:04:33.610> happen<00:04:33.970> at<00:04:34.060> once<00:04:34.860> whoa<00:04:36.120> whoa<00:04:37.120> I<00:04:39.690> can<00:04:40.690> pick

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:27.310 
this lap let me just read what's out for

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:28.890 
this lap let me just read what's out for
trees<00:05:27.490> and<00:05:27.760> everything<00:05:27.970> obstacles<00:05:28.780> in<00:05:28.870> your

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:28.900 
trees and everything obstacles in your

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:33.280

anime

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:46.080 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:49.440 

so<00:05:47.080> it<00:05:47.590> does<00:05:47.740> have<00:05:47.920> a<00:05:47.980> pretty<00:05:48.130> long<00:05:48.580> trek<00:05:49.060> and

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:49.450 
so it does have a pretty long trek and

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:51.600 
so it does have a pretty long trek and
the<00:05:49.780> tracks<00:05:50.080> to<00:05:50.290> depend<00:05:50.770> on<00:05:50.890> what<00:05:51.130> map<00:05:51.340> you're

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:51.610 
the tracks to depend on what map you're

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:57.960 
the tracks to depend on what map you're
on<00:05:51.760> and<00:05:52.090> anything<00:05:54.300> and<00:05:55.300> you<00:05:55.690> run<00:05:56.370> so<00:05:57.370> I<00:05:57.670> don't
