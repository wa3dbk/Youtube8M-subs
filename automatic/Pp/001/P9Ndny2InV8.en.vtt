00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:05.790
 Hello everyone I am prieto and 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.950
 Welcome to a new episode of 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.600
 let's compare here in head and today guys 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.880
 I bring a chapter something different from the 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.769
 others first because apart from 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.360
 be the first time we compare the 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.430
 tactical equipment of modern warfare 3 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.110
 It's also going to be the first time for 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.060
 do it let's consider more than 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:22.949
 two elements I explain myself a little better 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.630
 many of you will know that the tactical team 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.310
 of modern warfare terso offers us a 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.320
 lots of possibilities a lot 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.180
 very many I think even that is the 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.009
 modern warfare 3 game that offers us 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.079
 more possibilities when choosing 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.120
 the tactical team element that most 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.089
 we want the one that we like the most 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.319
 well there are three specific elements of 

00:00:39.089 --> 00:00:42.269
 this collective that have 

00:00:40.319 --> 00:00:44.639
 quite different functionalities are 

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:46.530
 very similar but a lot then then 

00:00:44.639 --> 00:00:48.839
 I thought it was convenient, you have believed 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.519
 convenient among all that would be fine 

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:52.409
 do a small compilation of 

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:54.269
 data statistics of these three 

00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:56.039
 tactical grenades and at the end of the video 

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:57.870
 determine which one is better or which 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.969
 we should use in each of the 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.859
 situations well to do so we have 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.619
 taken into account various factors such as 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.730
 the quantity first the quantity 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.920
 of grenades that will provide us with 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:09.509
 whenever we reappears time 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.700
 preparation both with unsheathed 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:13.200
 fast or without that advantage equipped the 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.000
 explosion time and finally the 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.950
 range of explosion range of each 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.140
 one of the grenades so as says one 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.259
 old friend of ours if you think 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:23.940
 let's start so first of all both 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.619
 in the grenade shocked now as in 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.299
 the blinding is going to provide us with a 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.729
 total of two grenades each time 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.740
 reappear we have always been this way 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.750
 in virtually all call of duty 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.119
 but is that in modern warfare 3 appeared 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.700
 a new friend a new grenade the 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:41.399
 misunderstood the marginalized the lonely 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.229
 granada pm call her as you want good 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:45.479
 because with this one is only going to offer us 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.429
 a single unit each time it reappears 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.960
 and this is an aspect in my opinion 

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:51.000
 quite negative especially in 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.039
 comparison to the other two and having 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.750
 note also that with scavenger only 

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:57.049
 we can recover the ammunition of the 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.049
 weapons 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.810
 but do not worry that the pomegranate pm 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:05.450
 will be able to face them in the 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.970
 preparation time that is 1.2 without 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.770
 quickly unsheathed and 0 73 with the 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.750
 Advantage equipped both in the blinding 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:13.700
 as in the shocked now you are going to 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.770
 see that with the grenade pm the time of 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.900
 preparation is very fast even 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.280
 we can do without this advantage in 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.860
 that class in which we take him to 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.510
 equipped to occupy your site with shield 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.040
 protector for example and any other 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.959
 advantage that can help us in 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.890
 very extreme situations always depends 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:29.710
 of the situation in which we 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.720
 let's find 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:34.569
 let's see now if you think how it 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.400
 behave on the battlefield 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:37.689
 you see that the grenade shocked now 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.010
 it will not explode until it touches the 

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:42.239
 soil that is to say has a time of 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.239
 unlimited explosion 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.230
 the blinding grenade is going to explode just 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.750
 after describing his bow 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:53.080
 in the air so it's a time of 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:55.090
 mean explosion of 146 while with 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.910
 the grenade apm you're going to see that it's going to 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.190
 exploit practically only throw it 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.830
 in the air 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.330
 so good in summary taking in 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.010
 account these aspects the time of 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:08.490
 burst of the blinding already said 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.810
 146 if I remember correctly while with 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:11.700
 the shocked now is a time of 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.320
 unlimited explosion so in this 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.270
 aspect that wins the game of 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:17.070
 clear way the shocked grenade 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:20.130
 Now because this will allow 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:22.440
 we can use it in many in 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.300
 many different situations is going to be 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.800
 a grenade much more versatile than 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:27.720
 we can use mostly in battles 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:30.300
 horizontal when we want to launch 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.590
 very very far the gain of now 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.600
 to go pretty well in spaces 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.700
 closed on maps where there is one or two 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:38.640
 levels and where it is convenient to strain the 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:42.130
 by a window or by some other place 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:44.380
 that is located above us 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:47.380
 and the grenade pm an explosion time 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:49.600
 very short less than a second 096 this 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:51.730
 will greatly harm this grenade and 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:53.590
 is going to make us only be able to use it in 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:56.380
 our anti-aircraft class against aircraft 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:58.750
 of recognition s my turrets both 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:00.940
 manned as unmanned is a 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:03.100
 very specific grenade only for cases 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.840
 very extreme and that goes well if the 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:06.820
 we have equipped in one of the classes 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:09.460
 to choose the in some situation in 

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:11.350
 concrete let's see the scope I got 

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:12.760
 in a private game to test the 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:15.250
 explosion range of each of the 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.900
 grenades and here you are seeing that the 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:18.700
 blinding grenade is the pomegranate by the 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.230
 moment that has more scope since with 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:22.150
 the shocked now when trying 

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:23.710
 throw it from the same place I have 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.960
 that approach a little more and it's there 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:27.400
 when it will affect me while 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.770
 that with the grenade pm I have to 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:31.690
 approach practically until licking the 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:33.910
 ass because you see that has a range 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:35.770
 of explosion very very very short so 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:37.960
 forget to use it against infantry 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.730
 only centered if you want to use it against 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:42.520
 enemies the blinding in the shocked 

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:44.420
 and within these two 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.950
 I recommend above all the commotion 

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:48.620
 now for the fact that it has a 

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:50.450
 unlimited explosion time but yes 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:53.480
 that it is true that the scope of 

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:55.190
 blinding is much higher than not in the 

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:56.660
 shocked now but think that the 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:58.790
 Call of duty maps are usually very 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:00.440
 small and if they are not small then 

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:02.660
 there are usually many nooks and 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:03.860
 difference is not going to be so remarkable you see 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:05.300
 Granada that has now shocked to 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:07.280
 said medium range although it continues 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:08.960
 having a range a very good range 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:11.060
 especially to use against infantry 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:12.980
 and the grenade pm because it has a scope 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:14.780
 very short in general is a grenade that 

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:16.640
 he stays far behind and he's going to go 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:19.250
 well in very specific cases like I've 

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:21.440
 said the blinding grenade especially in 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:24.050
 Vertical combats in combats where 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:25.130
 there are buildings of 23 levels while 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:26.900
 with the shocked now 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:28.640
 you can use it where you want it and how 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:30.260
 you want and in the situation that I give you 

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:32.720
 I do not want to 

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:34.160
 so good guys recommendation use 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:35.960
 the grenade shocked now in my 

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:37.790
 opinion is a much more grenade 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:39.530
 versatile is going to allow you to launch it a lot 

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:41.900
 farther where you want you will not have 

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:43.460
 to worry about what situation will go 

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:44.870
 well and what situation is going to go wrong and 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:46.850
 also the effect it has on the 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:48.500
 enemy is much more disturbing to him 

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:50.450
 since it privatizes a movement 

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:51.770
 complete and it's very complicated when you 

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:53.510
 shocks when defending a position 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:55.070
 while with the shocked now 

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:57.050
 it's true that you stay stuck and you do not see 

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:58.610
 absolutely nothing but you can follow 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:00.110
 moving you can keep shooting and 

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:02.150
 considering that we are going to use it 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:03.830
 in closed spaces it will not be very 

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:05.900
 difficult for the player to shoot 

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:07.370
 point-blank is not killing and we 

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:09.650
 You can kill who who does not 

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:11.540
 has happened that not so good in 

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:13.130
 summary I would use the shocked now 

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:15.770
 since it is a much more versatile grenade 

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:17.420
 and he now uses it on maps where 

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:20.690
 There are two levels where there are many 

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:23.060
 windows is more to go trying to go testing 

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:24.500
 and you then determine what grenade 

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:26.450
 is better suited to your gameplay 

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:27.770
 so good guys here is over the 

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:32.110
 video see you in the next 

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:32.110
 comparison only here remember from in gt
