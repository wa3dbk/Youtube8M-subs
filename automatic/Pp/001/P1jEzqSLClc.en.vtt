 inexpensive and budget 15 days 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:11.990
 printer-scanner-copier 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:40.430
 just here we have the same 20 black 1 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.649
 color accordingly could not power 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:45.660
 to enable suite 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:48.289
 also with driver cables do i need 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.289
 purchase separately 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:58.039
 here through a couple of instructions on different 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.039
 languages 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:09.930
 well first thing to do any 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:21.030
 protective fixed for 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:22.950
 transportation here at the connector is available 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.820
 we have a key that is, on the contrary, it is not 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:42.299
 turn on the top so it is certain 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:42.990
 way in this size is now 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:46.520
 need the same 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.520
 he connect here it is with us here on top 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:56.850
 printer initialization occurs we 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.740
 we see that we have two droplets down here 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.170
 the indicators are flashing ie he is talking about 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.710
 that they are not installed here 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.710
 ink cartridge 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:20.810
 open the edema and see now the carriage 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:23.450
 will be on position means here 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:26.400
 use the same 120 on the steering wheel number 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:30.660
 from the left us erotica becomes colored 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:35.670
 cartridge and to the right of which we open first 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:38.010
 color cartridge is visible here protective 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:42.380
 orange in the film which is understand and 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.380
 the printhead itself with food for 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.540
 set here in this way to 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:54.540
 flick 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:08.670
 now we set black 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:08.670
 but peaceful alike. out black here 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:26.519
 respectively 2k 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:30.409
 ja at our place we close here 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:35.250
 all indicators which megalit abnormally 

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:38.400
 go out and we can use already for 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:41.269
 In order to page you can hold the buttons 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.269
 several 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:50.700
 data learn the language to print here their 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:53.359
 system data serial number and number 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:56.760
 firmware and other technical data 

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:59.519
 now we can try to execute 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:02.549
 photocopy let's see the block 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:04.590
 scanner more here we have 

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:07.170
 designation of what you need sheet 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:09.299
 lay a4 lower right corner 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:16.430
 and there are also marks for others 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:20.090
 formats 10 by 15 4 by 6 inches you are cooler 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:27.180
 i will take this multiplication table 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:31.729
 open the scanner block put the right 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:34.229
 lower corner make for example color 

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:36.240
 process button means here it is with us 

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:38.490
 button this is responsible for black and white 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:42.180
 copy this button for color 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:44.880
 copy this is the cancel button that is 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:46.110
 In principle, everything is just some kind of speed 

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.300
 here here 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:51.539
 signals some technical 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:56.190
 malfunctions in this case, everything is in order 

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:56.750
 you can start the power button 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:59.440
 are starting 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:40.520
 flickering means the printer is performing 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:42.500
 note some process here 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:45.980
 extends an extra stand for 

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:47.390
 In order to have the paper does not fall here well 

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:48.890
 and the actual result as you can see on 

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:58.190
 ordinary office paper is very even 

00:05:48.890 --> 00:06:00.830
 good quality here is the original on 

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:04.550
 photo paper is our copy on a regular office 

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:09.710
 paper that is the clarity of colors in 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:11.030
 no complaints principle 

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:14.570
 the device works autonomously without 

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:17.750
 computer in copier mode quietly 

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:19.820
 can use this video on this 

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:23.080
 I finish all thanks for your attention and
