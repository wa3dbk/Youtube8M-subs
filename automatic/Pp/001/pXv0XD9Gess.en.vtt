00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:09.870
 good afternoon my name is elena i had 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:13.590
 The situation in the train I rode in Feodosia and in 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:18.119
 caught our carriage absolutely insane 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:21.180
 a sober spicy conductor he shouted 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.740
 swearing ran on the car prevented 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.240
 sleep 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.609
 small children were already eleven 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:31.619
 o'clock in the evening when i started asking him 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:33.930
 calmed down well since he was drunk 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.210
 seeing it completely our remarks are not 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.760
 worried I called the european 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.040
 legal service explained the situation 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.309
 they told me that they were coming to me 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.059
 will have to go to the headquarters car and 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:47.820
 ask for a complaint book 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.250
 I did not know that there is a book of sting in the train 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.010
 i say you think it will work they 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.680
 say go look you will 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:59.399
 very surprised I came to the staff car 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.590
 and asked the book to be the head of the train 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.650
 literally jumped on revenge that 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.850
 happened I explained the situation literally 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.060
 in 3 minutes 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.369
 she said something on the radio and said 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.409
 go quietly sleep say you sure 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.180
 she says sure when i come in 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.220
 your car 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:19.830
 I did not have this conductor at all 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.590
 even till the morning I saw him instead 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:25.860
 worked pretty young in white 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:28.400
 the shirt conductor carried the tea helped 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.659
 moms for shooting the second shelf and 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:33.479
 there was silence in our carriage and 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:36.360
 peace of mind to which everyone was very happy 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.500
 and in the morning the European one did nâ€™t call 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.380
 legal service 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:43.619
 and gave the cabinet phone number 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:46.079
 and the Ministry of Transport and Communications 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.909
 I asked why the cabinet minister he 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:51.119
 don't give a phone number they say everything 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:53.430
 similar situations that are associated with 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.700
 any ministries can contact in 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.950

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.020

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.969

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.750
