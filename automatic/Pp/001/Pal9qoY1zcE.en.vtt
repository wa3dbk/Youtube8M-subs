um but at the end of the day the blades

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.160 
um but at the end of the day the blades
were<00:01:58.079> still<00:01:58.350> on<00:01:59.479> that<00:02:00.479> was<00:02:00.600> my<00:02:00.780> mistake

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
were still on that was my mistake

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.649 
were still on that was my mistake
I<00:02:01.439> could<00:02:02.189> have<00:02:02.280> very<00:02:02.490> easily<00:02:02.579> killed<00:02:03.390> my

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
I could have very easily killed my

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.730 
I could have very easily killed my
parents<00:02:05.509> I<00:02:06.509> have<00:02:06.990> my<00:02:07.079> brother<00:02:07.259> not<00:02:07.439> turned<00:02:07.649> on

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
parents I have my brother not turned on

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.999 
parents I have my brother not turned on
the<00:02:07.829> light<00:02:08.690> before<00:02:09.690> he<00:02:09.929> should<00:02:10.170> have

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
the light before he should have

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.190 
the light before he should have
so<00:02:11.849> I<00:02:12.180> guess<00:02:12.420> I<00:02:13.010> guess<00:02:14.010> it's<00:02:14.190> justified<00:02:14.730> I

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
so I guess I guess it's justified I

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.270 
so I guess I guess it's justified I

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
upsetting but I heard that it's hard to

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.550 
upsetting but I heard that it's hard to
get<00:02:29.099> match<00:02:29.310> matches<00:02:30.150> online<00:02:30.569> and<00:02:31.319> they've
