00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:17.210
 Hello and welcome to 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:19.550
 export if I have now very short me 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.230
 I just uploaded the mac it was 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.000
 a video of the set itself yesterday 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.439
 but now pushes completely 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.720
 quickly an ass behind and that goes 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:28.790
 it was my call to the kita went 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.919
 nutrition or anabolic in the now 

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:32.270
 so were now on because the 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:34.550
 very many questions now build up 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.809
 that's a thing I'm more or 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.489
 have forgotten less in childhood 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:39.140
 in nutrition of the children their nutrition 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:41.090
 It is so that you can be in a certain rhythm 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.489
 Should you drive so should a five 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.989
 plus two or six +1 rhythm drive 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:48.289
 depending on the carbohydrates always 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:51.309
 of course, six +1 still responds 

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:53.719
 a tick more extreme and another tick 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:55.640
 more effective that is why it is great 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:59.749
 because you just monday to saturday too 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:02.239
 For example, carry the coal of the 100 to Saturday 

00:00:59.749 --> 00:01:04.100
 lid is so in the crisis then stays 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:06.770
 on sunday therefore beginning 7 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.270
 just then I cried this 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.760
 Personally, experience with the five 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.320
 plus two systems with the 5 2 and must 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.450
 I'm fine, I'm fine 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.710
 quickly the water again 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.840
 does not pull too fast 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.189
 It says there are three and in the crisis 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.049
 I'm actually already well 

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:22.549
 Tuesday mornings Tuesday mornings mostly 

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:24.979
 if I go back to the monday 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:26.530
 nutrition indicators return to 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:30.110
 called him to him 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:32.329
 the reed itself is in my opinion 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:35.030
 another diet day so it gives her 

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:36.649
 you will not get that many anywhere 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.630
 different opinions hear how about 

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:40.880
 the one I called can only tell you so 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.280
 how I personally do it like that 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.109
 Personally, it's best to hit me 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:48.469
 personally strikes best when i am 

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:50.630
 just these two repeat days 

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:52.609
 do not exaggerate the calories ago 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.859
 at the calories now also two 

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:57.710
 So three thousand calories remain 

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:59.630
 taking my total sales and me 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.909
 Just recommend everyone it works 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.799
 that's why the glycogen storage again 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:05.479
 to replenish many carbohydrates 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:07.549
 eat that's what it's about when I called 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:09.380
 but still recommend two different 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:12.890
 Two very important things in my opinion 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.630
 Please do not continue after designs 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.400
 collide and separate fans 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:19.970
 in this how much wear there is 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.510
 the rules are simply not 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.040
 exclude 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.620
 that's just the connection between 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.200
 carbohydrate and insulin insulin 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.489
 high is one stores just the fat that 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.260
 does not necessarily have to be that one 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:33.659
 possibly even if you are there 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:37.260
 somehow junkfood rhein pulls 

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:38.549
 so to speak, the whole hut again 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.739
 broken down what to do during the week 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:44.400
 actually brought in and number two 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:46.230
 remains with the carbohydrates ago 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.299
 your glycogen store for example 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.099
 I now have about 92 kilos 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:52.290
 that means my happy with are good 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:54.889
 400 grams means I look that me 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:57.450
 from saturday and sunday only 

00:02:54.889 --> 00:02:59.250
 Take 400 grams of carbs to me 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.000
 that's 1600 calories out 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.310
 carbohydrates 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.109
 the rest will be made from protein and 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:07.379
 Aspects are based on how high I am 

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:09.180
 go to 2002 stop 3008 like me at that 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:12.269
 a lot of what I feel today today 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.920
 I just want to eat while being there 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:17.340
 still under a total turnover of good 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:20.519
 3500 or so that means I am 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:24.690
 are still looking at the question 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:26.430
 but still called as diet days the 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.379
 all of course with the carbohydrates 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.269
 but I would not go up then 

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:32.459
 want to issue a letter 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:34.560
 but I would say oriented 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:36.780
 to the glycogen stores and the 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.530
 glycogen storage how big the course 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.659
 are with you 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.489
 We have that in the video already 

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:43.829
 clarified i believe about a part one 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:45.659
 or two of the doku series is watching you 

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:47.340
 that again at once it comes down 

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:49.889
 but there were a lot of questions 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:52.019
 have it made easy to 

00:03:49.889 --> 00:03:54.720
 its because i have this song in the video 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:56.190
 myself have not not treated 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.479
 That's why I wanted it all the time 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.889
 shoot very fast afterwards 

00:03:57.479 --> 00:04:00.120
 See you again next time 

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:02.780
 it is then certainly not with 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:05.560
 jack and until then I stay natural 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:05.560
 as a kutcher
