00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.820 
pressure on this as you can see it
starts<00:02:17.250> to<00:02:17.360> come<00:02:18.360> up<00:02:18.420> and<00:02:18.840> it's<00:02:19.410> going<00:02:19.530> to<00:02:19.590> fall

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
well to a point but that's just kind of

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.370 
well to a point but that's just kind of
unacceptable<00:02:25.350> I<00:02:25.890> got<00:02:26.190> a<00:02:26.220> thing<00:02:26.610> into<00:02:27.380> Stanley

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
unacceptable I got a thing into Stanley

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.280 
unacceptable I got a thing into Stanley
here<00:02:28.800> and<00:02:29.040> I'm<00:02:29.670> hoping<00:02:30.060> that<00:02:30.330> they<00:02:31.260> will

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
here and I'm hoping that they will

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.880 
here and I'm hoping that they will
replace<00:02:31.770> that<00:02:32.400> I<00:02:32.900> doubt<00:02:33.900> if<00:02:34.170> they'll<00:02:34.410> do<00:02:34.710> it

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
replace that I doubt if they'll do it

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.310 
replace that I doubt if they'll do it
for<00:02:34.920> free<00:02:35.400> of<00:02:35.520> charge<00:02:35.850> but<00:02:36.270> today<00:02:36.510> we'll<00:02:37.140> see

what happens
like<00:02:39.330> I<00:02:39.420> said<00:02:39.510> nice<00:02:39.900> concept<00:02:40.560> just<00:02:41.280> a<00:02:41.370> little

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
like I said nice concept just a little

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.060 
like I said nice concept just a little
bit<00:02:41.880> weak<00:02:42.120> and<00:02:42.300> a<00:02:42.360> poop<00:02:42.570> on<00:02:42.810> this<00:02:43.530> part<00:02:43.860> of<00:02:43.980> it

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
bit weak and a poop on this part of it

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:49.850 
bit weak and a poop on this part of it
this<00:02:44.730> here<00:02:46.370> also<00:02:47.900> just<00:02:48.900> about<00:02:49.050> the<00:02:49.350> first<00:02:49.620> week

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
this here also just about the first week

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.350 
this here also just about the first week
I<00:02:50.040> had<00:02:50.280> it

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
I had it

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.020 
I had it
the<00:02:51.780> handles<00:02:52.230> not<00:02:52.440> long<00:02:52.710> enough<00:02:53.040> you<00:02:53.580> pull<00:02:53.850> it

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
the handles not long enough you pull it

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.350 
the handles not long enough you pull it
and<00:02:54.180> it's<00:02:54.540> constantly<00:02:55.170> hitting<00:02:55.470> in<00:02:55.680> the<00:02:55.830> heels

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
and it's constantly hitting in the heels

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:57.890 
and it's constantly hitting in the heels
kind<00:02:57.360> of<00:02:57.480> knowing

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
kind of knowing

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.720 
kind of knowing
I<00:02:58.080> think<00:02:58.440> the<00:02:58.560> pant<00:02:58.800> the<00:02:59.070> handle<00:02:59.430> should<00:02:59.610> have

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
I think the pant the handle should have

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.210 
I think the pant the handle should have
came<00:02:59.880> out<00:03:00.030> way<00:03:00.300> out<00:03:00.330> to<00:03:00.690> the<00:03:00.810> ends<00:03:01.200> and<00:03:01.350> then

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
came out way out to the ends and then

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:03.380 
came out way out to the ends and then
they<00:03:02.370> could<00:03:02.610> that<00:03:02.700> you<00:03:02.760> could<00:03:02.850> have<00:03:03.090> been<00:03:03.120> able

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
they could that you could have been able

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.350 
they could that you could have been able
to<00:03:03.540> get<00:03:03.960> this<00:03:04.110> thing<00:03:04.320> passed<00:03:04.590> your<00:03:04.860> back<00:03:05.360> heel

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
to get this thing passed your back heel

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.230 
to get this thing passed your back heel

this<00:03:42.300> thing<00:03:42.810> as<00:03:43.080> she'd<00:03:43.410> now<00:03:43.950> that<00:03:44.250> it's<00:03:44.460> here<00:03:45.300> I

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:45.570 
this thing as she'd now that it's here I

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:49.790 
this thing as she'd now that it's here I
guess<00:03:45.960> now<00:03:46.800> that<00:03:46.830> it's<00:03:47.340> uh<00:03:47.580> panning<00:03:48.480> up<00:03:49.320> it's<00:03:49.710> a

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:49.800 
guess now that it's uh panning up it's a

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.420 
guess now that it's uh panning up it's a
little<00:03:49.890> hard<00:03:50.250> to<00:03:50.430> open<00:03:50.520> this<00:03:50.850> up<00:03:51.380> but<00:03:52.400> what<00:03:53.400> I

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
little hard to open this up but what I

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.320 
little hard to open this up but what I
found<00:03:53.730> is<00:03:53.970> if<00:03:54.150> I<00:03:54.210> flip<00:03:54.540> this<00:03:54.720> down<00:03:55.050> first<00:03:55.500> and

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:56.330 
found is if I flip this down first and

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:59.390 
found is if I flip this down first and
then<00:03:57.330> we'll<00:03:57.540> start<00:03:57.780> working<00:03:58.050> I'm<00:03:58.440> much<00:03:59.160> better

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
then we'll start working I'm much better

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.430 
then we'll start working I'm much better
off<00:03:59.490> otherwise<00:03:59.940> I'm<00:04:00.240> going<00:04:00.330> to<00:04:00.450> push<00:04:00.900> those<00:04:01.110> he

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
off otherwise I'm going to push those he

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.160 
off otherwise I'm going to push those he
had<00:04:01.650> pipes<00:04:02.340> right<00:04:02.610> through<00:04:02.970> the<00:04:03.150> deal<00:04:03.870> there

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
had pipes right through the deal there

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:05.650 
had pipes right through the deal there
and<00:04:04.350> it's<00:04:04.440> just<00:04:04.590> going<00:04:04.710> to<00:04:04.800> collapse<00:04:05.100> on<00:04:05.400> me

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:05.660 
and it's just going to collapse on me

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:08.870 
and it's just going to collapse on me
but<00:04:06.660> if<00:04:07.200> I<00:04:07.380> are<00:04:07.440> using<00:04:07.830> this<00:04:08.040> saying<00:04:08.310> I<00:04:08.520> guess<00:04:08.700> I

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
but if I are using this saying I guess I

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.720 
but if I are using this saying I guess I
would<00:04:09.060> use<00:04:09.270> it<00:04:09.480> for<00:04:09.630> something<00:04:09.870> light<00:04:10.730> very

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
would use it for something light very

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.450 
would use it for something light very
nice<00:04:12.030> setup<00:04:12.870> maybe<00:04:13.710> to<00:04:13.890> take<00:04:14.100> with<00:04:14.310> you

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:14.460 
nice setup maybe to take with you

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:17.360 
nice setup maybe to take with you
somewhere<00:04:14.880> on<00:04:14.940> trip<00:04:15.420> a<00:04:15.660> venir<00:04:16.500> RV<00:04:16.859> or<00:04:17.040> whatever

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
somewhere on trip a venir RV or whatever

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.870 
somewhere on trip a venir RV or whatever
to<00:04:17.520> keep<00:04:17.700> your<00:04:17.850> tools<00:04:18.000> in<00:04:18.330> it<00:04:19.640> but<00:04:20.640> or

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
to keep your tools in it but or

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:23.260 
to keep your tools in it but or
something<00:04:21.330> like<00:04:21.419> that<00:04:21.660> but<00:04:21.960> light<00:04:22.410> crafts

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 
something like that but light crafts

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:26.730 
something like that but light crafts
stuff<00:04:24.270> like<00:04:24.479> that<00:04:24.740> be<00:04:25.740> great

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
stuff like that be great

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.760 
stuff like that be great
and<00:04:26.889> tote<00:04:27.610> heavy<00:04:27.910> tools<00:04:28.330> in<00:04:28.569> it<00:04:28.750> I<00:04:28.930> don't<00:04:29.500> think

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770 
and tote heavy tools in it I don't think

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:31.170 
and tote heavy tools in it I don't think
so

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.180 
so

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:35.250 
so
