00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:12.929
 the current sale stop of the pc 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.250
 version of batman arkham sorry is the 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.470
 sad peak in the long 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.050
 story of completely messed up pc 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.490
 Implementations of games already 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.680
 long before the new appearance of the 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.779
 bat gave you the ports you after the 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.000
 installation preferably with pc from the 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.039
 would have thrown windows in ours 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.269
 we put two-part video special 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.920
 some of them 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.680
 of course without claim 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.079
 completeness also requires that 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.480
 We explicitly refer to the status of the game 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.430
 release including day one patch talk 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.110
 Meanwhile , the situation has changed 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.110
 Of course, possibly 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.670
 Improve us feedback if you 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.489
 to come up with more titles 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:57.600
 Let's start with five games from 2007 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:01:00.210
 until 2014 much fun as the playful 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.730
 actually great resident evil 4 im 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.010
 years 2007 the jump from the gamecube up 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.900
 the pc managed to rewrite the word 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.270
 Probably the first thing to worry about is the feeling 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.299
 that the inclined players first 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.340
 behold the pc graphic captured what in 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.770
 three devil names had capcom 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.780
 only one thought perfect 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.119
 even messed up missing light 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.159
 programming barely visible fog and fog 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.780
 Textures that looked like they had 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.909
 the developers vomited about it 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.549
 even the previously ok in film sequences 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.560
 were muddy from the insufficient mouse 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.810
 keyboard control not to mention 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.030
 a patch beat the worst 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.909
 Error while off to the gamecube template 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.079
 However, the game never came up 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:42.540
 tragically meanwhile there is of 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:44.549
 resident evil 4 an old with hd edition 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.070
 which are the external values ​​of survival 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.990
 game thanks to higher-resolution graphics though 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.220
 still makes more bearable 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.710
 far below the possibilities of one 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.810
 reasonable pc implementation remains the us 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.610
 by the way here in the video show the 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.979
 Graphics quality of the original pc 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.750
 version exists in our database 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:04.040
 only in the form of screenshots 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.040
 take a look at this 

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:12.470
 enough or what a pity that all 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:14.209
 is resident evil 4 true and 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.040
 recognize the series as absolute 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:17.599
 atmosphere highlight the 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:22.790
 Responsible one wants reflexively 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:24.950
 a zombie plague on the neck rage the 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.870
 Last software shooter on the graphic 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.489
 magician and the creator john i came 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.010
 from the beginning to the end of development 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:32.510
 involved was not exactly one 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.180
 Shine on the parquet 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:37.340
 and that just on the pc the 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.530
 origin system of the famous adtech 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:42.380
 engines from classics like doom and 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.660
 quake thering textures poppins and 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.349
 poor graphics 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.880
 Settings options resulted 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:49.430
 Altogether, they are an unworthy one 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:52.670
 Presentation of the once innovative pc 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:54.380
 But the masters of development came to the fore 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.569
 Rage engine was just for consoles 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.579
 optimized and whether now the so-called 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:00.290
 memory- hungry mega textures blame 

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:01.940
 By the way, they were crazy 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.530
 installation- biggest worries and in 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.870
 the new version of the e tech engine 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.010
 no longer used or 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.840
 any drivers or settings 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:10.940
 interested in the end of the day year only 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.859
 technicians and engine professionals 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.480
 ordinary pc player wants visibility 

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:17.299
 you look straight from a game one 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.489
 fantastic performance retro thus one 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:21.680
 nice end time shooter in this form 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:24.370
 but a disappointment and that is still 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.370
 nicely expressed 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:31.180
 with the addition of prepaid udai edition 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:33.010
 should dark souls 2012 also on the pc 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.650
 for the one-off alternating bath between 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:37.180
 frustration and feelings of happiness worry that only 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:39.160
 developer from software so good 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.650
 staging can even be extra 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.450
 contents were announced it would have everything 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.890
 be so beautiful 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.110
 but then it's just that 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:50.010
 pc player heart because there would be the one 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:53.530
 maximum resolution of 1024 x 768 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:55.780
 picture points in 2012 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:57.640
 Although you could still the resolution 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:00.250
 higher then the picture was 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:02.920
 just plump upscale and say ugly 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:04.930
 then the frame blog on 30 frames 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.790
 per second for owners 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:08.890
 current hardware is always a bad one 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:10.930
 joke is a settings menu with three 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:12.580
 get setting options one 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:15.280
 keyboard assignment from hell 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:17.920
 only gamepad overlay in the game one 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.810
 as well console user interface already 

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:22.030
 from the first boss opponent was as 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:24.460
 pc player ready by dark souls 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:25.930
 Luckily, a fan fix improvement 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:27.490
 then you just have to have a gamepad 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:30.400
 connect and then it works too 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:32.410
 dark souls on the pc v light hits it 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.390
 probably best to the pc implementation of 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:37.120
 to describe dark souls in total 

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:40.680
 and that hurts more than the hard tip 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:40.680
 a dark soul fieslings 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:45.470
 actually a pretty old one 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:47.780
 discussion is the so-called downgrade 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:49.970
 debate if trailer or screenshots 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:51.110
 look better then release version then 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:53.360
 is the screaming big 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:54.980
 whether rightly or wrongly not in the 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.360
 Eye of the observer is probably 

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:59.090
 anyway dependent on case 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:00.680
 in the run-up to hot stocks was synonymous 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:01.910
 Differences between release version 

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:03.530
 and announcement trailer 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:05.540
 but then the game came on the market 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:07.460
 and be on ultra settings actually 

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:09.380
 really fantastic if you like him 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:11.300
 files voodoo a few missing 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:12.920
 graphic effects had been activated 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:15.650
 nobody could complain there 

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:16.940
 really wrong because fantastic too 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:19.160
 the system requirements for a 

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:20.630
 smooth play pleasure sets with one 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.970
 High settings were high end 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:25.160
 systems with a lot of video memory needed around 

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:26.720
 to pay reasonable fps without memory 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:28.790
 Hiccup come because you two 

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:30.890
 gigabyte graphics memory or cpu s with 

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:33.230
 less than four cores and under 3 5 

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:35.000
 ghz clock hot stocks is no longer that 

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:36.860
 highly praised technique fireworks but 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.660
 a ball orgy par excellence 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:40.940
 Not every player can get a system 

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:42.500
 to be able to play watchdog like this 

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:44.300
 how to actually play it 

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:45.940
 After all, the performance has to be 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:48.710
 thanks to patches meanwhile improved 

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:50.270
 Nevertheless, a rather embarrassing pc occurs 

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:53.320
 a really good game with 

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:53.320
 an exciting concept 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:58.220
 Assassin's creed unitis one of the 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.840
 prettiest games ever and one 

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:01.910
 The most common thing is performance 

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:03.620
 other fun on the 

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:06.290
 pc as well as so at least in the 

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:08.150
 original version already on xbox and ps 

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:10.820
 4 were 30 frames and jp the 

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:12.770
 maximum values ​​in things graphic if then 

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:14.870
 still such a sloppy optimized 

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:16.670
 pc version comes to you want to smooth 

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:18.950
 an assassin to the responsible 

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:20.300
 send framerate slumps missing 

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:22.340
 or popping in the textures 

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:24.200
 flickering shadows and others 

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:26.180
 like a camera lying around 

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:28.820
 and clipping errors the list of fun 

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:30.410
 kicker was a long time considering that 

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:32.420
 the system requirements of unity 

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:33.590
 comparatively high and you can 

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:34.730
 the implementation actually only as 

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:37.370
 called impudence 

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:38.360
 after all, ubisoft has promised from the 

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:40.520
 to learn to fail 

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:42.470
 also playful the technique was at 

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:44.330
 Assassin's creed unity is not the only one 

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:45.950
 problem and we believe the developer 

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:49.700
 if he is such a naked 

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:51.920
 Do not give them that again 

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:53.840
 first five messed up pc implementation of 

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:56.360
 they would have played so well 

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:57.500
 No need to be in the next 

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:59.150
 days continue 

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:02.740
 Until then we wish you good and good 

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:02.740
 all functioning pc games
