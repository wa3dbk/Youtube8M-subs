 How ugly 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:21.939
 connected to the computer 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:25.359
 exile is a dictator 

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:28.839

 the cabinet 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:33.430
 we will go on the field to 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.430
 the best handling 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:44.120

 the control 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.280
 the fifth 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.840
 now remove the cap 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.370

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:18.010
 Pull on me 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:21.010
 yes depending on the fit of your 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.830

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.860
 a terrorist year 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.860
 Our computer died. 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:35.660
 now let's make a living the memory 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:39.510
 the memory it fits ministers 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.999
 invite me to visualize I have two memories 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.790
 in 4 these lots 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:52.660
 so is each memory 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:54.140
 each 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.140
 but the weak memory book bewilder 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.440
 with both hands we press 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:05.909
 this item is a great club 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.649
 down 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:09.979
 and another also 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:11.169
 together 

00:02:11.169 --> 00:02:12.459
 rl 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:14.069
 already celebrates growth 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:17.069
 the detention is stopped 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:27.719
 we will use both low 

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:30.719
 d between these white pieces 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:33.410
 which can be rotated 8 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.410
 away from the computer 

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:39.249

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:03.069
 we avoided another side 

00:03:15.749 --> 00:03:19.789
 Now let's go and go back to the computer, we fit the memory. 

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:21.589

 gently does not affect very strongly not 

00:03:33.669 --> 00:03:38.810
 and when it snaps the spikes it is automatically closes the memory 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:39.809
 debate 

00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:42.809
