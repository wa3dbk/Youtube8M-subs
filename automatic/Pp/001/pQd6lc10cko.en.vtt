and by the way make sure that you put it

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:32.720 
and by the way make sure that you put it
on<00:03:30.450> when<00:03:31.200> the<00:03:31.530> temperature<00:03:32.040> is<00:03:32.310> going<00:03:32.519> to<00:03:32.640> be

if we have a warming trend sometime this
month<00:03:37.769> get<00:03:38.160> your<00:03:38.340> dormant<00:03:38.670> oil<00:03:38.819> on<00:03:39.030> that<00:03:39.329> way

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
month get your dormant oil on that way

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.349 
month get your dormant oil on that way
you'll<00:03:39.660> avoid<00:03:39.989> any<00:03:40.530> damage<00:03:41.040> to<00:03:41.400> the<00:03:41.489> buds<00:03:41.730> one
