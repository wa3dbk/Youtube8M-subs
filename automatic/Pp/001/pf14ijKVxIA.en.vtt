developer platform the developer edition

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.090 
developer platform the developer edition
it<00:00:35.790> doesn't<00:00:36.270> bomb<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.630> same<00:00:36.930> kind<00:00:37.800> of<00:00:37.950> like

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
developing for this n-no not end on a

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.119 
developing for this n-no not end on a
platform<00:00:50.010> but<00:00:50.430> then<00:00:50.989> the<00:00:51.989> may<00:00:52.199> go<00:00:52.410> home<00:00:52.680> at<00:00:52.860> and

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
platform but then the may go home at and

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.770 
platform but then the may go home at and
1<00:00:53.340> p-2<00:00:53.640> platform<00:00:54.480> so<00:00:55.199> n<00:00:55.829> 9<00:00:56.309> 50<00:00:56.760> aluminum<00:00:57.510> body

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
1 p-2 platform so n 9 50 aluminum body

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.490 
1 p-2 platform so n 9 50 aluminum body
obviously<00:00:58.160> slide-out<00:00:59.160> qwerty<00:00:59.489> keyboard<00:01:00.059> and

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:00.500 
obviously slide-out qwerty keyboard and

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.520 
obviously slide-out qwerty keyboard and
also<00:01:01.500> it<00:01:01.770> doesn't<00:01:02.160> come<00:01:02.399> with<00:01:02.430> this<00:01:02.760> and

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
also it doesn't come with this and

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.350 
also it doesn't come with this and
emulate<00:01:04.530> display<00:01:05.159> through<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.700> 9<00:01:05.880> inch<00:01:05.909> that

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
emulate display through the 9 inch that

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.500 
emulate display through the 9 inch that
the<00:01:06.540> n9<00:01:06.900> have<00:01:07.170> comes<00:01:07.740> to<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:07.950> 4-inch<00:01:08.369> TFT<00:01:08.549> unit

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
the n9 have comes to the 4-inch TFT unit

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.219 
the n9 have comes to the 4-inch TFT unit
with<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.500> fw<00:01:11.250> vga<00:01:11.729> resolution<00:01:12.020> so<00:01:13.020> i<00:01:13.049> don't

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
with the fw vga resolution so i don't

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.960 
with the fw vga resolution so i don't
think<00:01:13.409> that's<00:01:13.619> good<00:01:13.950> and<00:01:14.280> we<00:01:14.549> haven't<00:01:14.729> seen

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
think that's good and we haven't seen

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.910 
think that's good and we haven't seen
like<00:01:15.119> a<00:01:15.180> picture<00:01:15.450> of<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.720> back<00:01:15.990> of<00:01:16.290> this

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
like a picture of the back of this

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.289 
like a picture of the back of this
device<00:01:17.490> but<00:01:18.470> we<00:01:19.470> assume<00:01:19.979> that<00:01:20.040> it<00:01:20.700> also<00:01:20.939> packs

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
device but we assume that it also packs

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.840 
device but we assume that it also packs
the<00:01:21.600> 82<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:22.049> pixel<00:01:22.350> camera<00:01:22.590> that<00:01:23.310> comes<00:01:23.490> on

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
the 82 and pixel camera that comes on

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.560 
the 82 and pixel camera that comes on
the<00:01:24.000> n<00:01:24.150> line<00:01:24.180> 50<00:01:25.049> not<00:01:25.890> like<00:01:26.130> 12<00:01:26.759> x<00:01:27.119> all<00:01:27.299> that

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
the n line 50 not like 12 x all that

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.330 
the n line 50 not like 12 x all that
we've<00:01:27.780> heard<00:01:28.080> rumors<00:01:28.409> from<00:01:28.740> other<00:01:29.009> people

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
we've heard rumors from other people

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.080 
we've heard rumors from other people
saying<00:01:29.640> so<00:01:30.479> yeah<00:01:31.380> 12<00:01:31.829> 12<00:01:32.250> megapixel<00:01:32.939> would

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
saying so yeah 12 12 megapixel would

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.300 
saying so yeah 12 12 megapixel would
become<00:01:33.450> insane<00:01:33.869> for<00:01:34.110> a<00:01:34.170> developer<00:01:34.409> build<00:01:34.829> so<00:01:35.130> i

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
become insane for a developer build so i

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.789 
become insane for a developer build so i
don't<00:01:35.909> think<00:01:36.119> they<00:01:36.360> like<00:01:36.600> you<00:01:36.780> have<00:01:36.930> included

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
don't think they like you have included

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.060 
don't think they like you have included
that<00:01:38.009> in<00:01:38.579> that<00:01:38.970> version<00:01:39.329> so<00:01:40.229> you're<00:01:40.710> something

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
that in that version so you're something

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.800 
that in that version so you're something
that<00:01:41.189> you<00:01:41.369> should<00:01:41.850> think<00:01:42.090> about<00:01:42.210> also<00:01:42.720> you

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
that you should think about also you

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.319 
that you should think about also you
don't<00:01:42.960> get<00:01:43.229> in<00:01:43.350> NFC<00:01:44.009> or<00:01:44.250> this<00:01:44.460> or<00:01:44.700> compass<00:01:45.149> but

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
don't get in NFC or this or compass but

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.090 
don't get in NFC or this or compass but
hey<00:01:45.509> this<00:01:45.990> is<00:01:46.140> only<00:01:46.320> what<00:01:46.500> developers<00:01:46.890> and

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
hey this is only what developers and

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.800 
hey this is only what developers and
also<00:01:47.310> a<00:01:47.340> little<00:01:47.549> smaller<00:01:47.820> battery<00:01:48.509> no

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
also a little smaller battery no

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.660 
also a little smaller battery no
over-the-air<00:01:49.229> update<00:01:49.619> as<00:01:49.799> well<00:01:49.979> but

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.460 
over-the-air update as well but
someone's<00:01:51.509> probably<00:01:51.689> going<00:01:51.930> to<00:01:51.990> pour<00:01:52.229> ten

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
someone's probably going to pour ten

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.510 
someone's probably going to pour ten
nine<00:01:52.770> me<00:01:53.579> your<00:01:53.850> version<00:01:54.000> to<00:01:54.630> this<00:01:55.219> twice<00:01:56.219> so
