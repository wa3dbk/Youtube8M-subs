there's a very very simple reason why

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.660 
there's a very very simple reason why
they're<00:00:18.390> just<00:00:18.420> not<00:00:18.949> eating<00:00:20.330> quality<00:00:21.410> fruit

they're<00:00:30.269> not<00:00:30.840> worth<00:00:31.140> eating<00:00:31.439> I<00:00:31.769> just<00:00:32.130> throw

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
they're not worth eating I just throw

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.549 
they're not worth eating I just throw
them<00:00:32.610> away<00:00:32.730> I<00:00:33.149> just<00:00:33.420> don't<00:00:34.079> eat<00:00:34.260> them<00:00:34.440> because

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.639 
them away I just don't eat them because
they're<00:00:35.309> not<00:00:35.340> sweet<00:00:35.910> at<00:00:36.149> all<00:00:36.360> so<00:00:36.899> if<00:00:37.110> I<00:00:37.290> were<00:00:37.440> to

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
they're not sweet at all so if I were to

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.780

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
satisfied because the sugar is what

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.319 
satisfied because the sugar is what
gives<00:00:48.510> us<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:49.129> fuel<00:00:50.129> that<00:00:50.370> we<00:00:50.489> need<00:00:50.700> so

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:48.580 
right we need sugar to fuel our cells
that's<00:02:46.950> why<00:02:47.130> the<00:02:47.190> banana<00:02:47.700> is<00:02:47.970> such<00:02:48.150> a<00:02:48.180> good

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
should so you have to basically learn by

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.690 
should so you have to basically learn by
experience<00:03:33.290> but<00:03:34.290> just<00:03:34.560> to<00:03:35.069> realize<00:03:35.310> that<00:03:35.340> if

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700 
experience but just to realize that if

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.699 
experience but just to realize that if
you're<00:03:35.910> if<00:03:36.810> you're<00:03:36.870> opening<00:03:37.319> up<00:03:37.410> the<00:03:37.530> food

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
you're if you're opening up the food

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:40.099 
you're if you're opening up the food
starting<00:03:38.519> to<00:03:38.609> eat<00:03:38.760> it<00:03:38.940> and<00:03:39.090> you<00:03:39.239> realize<00:03:39.450> this

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:40.109 
starting to eat it and you realize this

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:42.979 
starting to eat it and you realize this
isn't<00:03:40.350> sweet<00:03:40.680> it's<00:03:41.670> not<00:03:41.850> worth<00:03:42.060> eating<00:03:42.269> find

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
isn't sweet it's not worth eating find

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:45.379 
isn't sweet it's not worth eating find
something<00:03:43.350> else<00:03:43.549> so<00:03:44.549> make<00:03:44.850> sure<00:03:44.880> you<00:03:45.090> get<00:03:45.209> that

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:45.389

dense<00:03:51.750> foods<00:03:52.200> and<00:03:52.560> typically<00:03:53.069> you'll<00:03:53.579> go<00:03:53.760> to

00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:53.819 
dense foods and typically you'll go to

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:56.569
