00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:09.080
 jam on the way to work who 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.309
 does not know that 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.840
 jasper lot will reign times 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.410
 that stupid five crossroads there 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.160
 built 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:19.140
 oh that's what we were as 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.640
 mayors of city skylines are us 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.560
 for all the problems of a growing 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.510
 city ​​responsible for traffic 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.170
 over the power supply up to the 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.869
 luck drove 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.460
 the experienced city planner like that 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.960
 some detail of that catastrophes 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.140
 play simcity from two years ago 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.670
 remembering is no coincidence 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:38.040
 skylines copied cheeky good aspects 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.510
 the macs of the game made ours 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.129
 on game date but already one 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.079
 much stronger impression 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.550
 we were only allowed one 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.800
 good hour in our self 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.780
 created pc games town spend in 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.190
 Naturally only such a short time was possible 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.039
 on the surface of the complex 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.219
 Game principle scratch city skylines 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.570
 offers two modes in the conventional 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:59.129
 game variant generates your money 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.649
 and switches through growth more 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.690
 Buildings free in free mode are all 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.479
 Buildings available from the beginning and yours 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.130
 financial means unlimited on 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.610
 basic gameplay changes 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.159
 but nothing 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.020
 he lays straight or winding roads and 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.479
 highways and pointing to both sides 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.610
 residential and industrial areas 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.170
 it works the same as in sin 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.250
 city ​​and can be thanks to smarter 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.720
 operate tools similar to intuitive 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.890
 unlike the last simcity you have to 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.409
 again water and power lines 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.180
 separately laid in reverse 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.799
 that means not all buildings 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.079
 mandatory placed on a street 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.090
 be a water tower or a 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.729
 Wind turbine can skylines the city 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.710
 even off the road are developers 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.810
 but colossal law order wants unnecessary 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.579
 avoid micromanagement that works 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.170
 very good, especially since it is unique 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:49.430
 feedback directly in the games graphic 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.430
 if problems arise 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.470
 Of course, a city needs it too 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.810
 public buildings such as firefighters 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:05.330
 police station school and hospital 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.260
 Nice idea who no second building 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.210
 wants to build 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.860
 to meet the rising demand of 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:13.810
 can also easily budget for 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.810
 increase water supply and co 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.660
 although in comparison to the city only one 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.790
 comparatively manageable number of 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.740
 The building seems to have given us the 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.590
 typical genre spiral also in 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:29.540
 City skylines powerful motivates it makes 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.610
 fun of settling while growing watch 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.840
 and the never-ending needs 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.520
 the resident to breastfeed 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.690
 but at the same time you can also do that 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.790
 big whole not out of sight 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.300
 lose and have to clever new quarters 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.430
 to plan 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:43.010
 for this purpose are per card 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:45.320
 fabulous 25 of these giant squares 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.660
 you are ready to take up to nine of them 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.980
 buy one after the other for their very own 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.290
 to build a metropolis 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:54.350
 mini cities like in simcity are here 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:56.090
 definitely the exception to the overview 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:58.610
 you can keep your own quarter 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.500
 to give him a name and 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.930
 then gets specific 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:05.269
 statistics for this sector are displayed 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.340
 In addition, you may order as a 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:09.340
 smoking ban that boosts the 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.269
 quality of life or you are committed 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.080
 industrial smoke detector 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:15.519
 retrofit 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.519
 this reduces the risk of fire 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.980
 But too many new ideas should not 

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:28.930
 expect 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.849
 city ​​skylines focuses on it 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.379
 to optimize known and that 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:32.829
 forget about the disappointing simcity 

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:35.079
 do 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:36.760
 But there are a few of your own ideas 

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:37.420
 but how about that realistic 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.940
 flowing water 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.920
 who the pumping station downstream from 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.629
 drainage pipe of the sewage system 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.110
 thereby infuses its citizens with its citizens 

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:48.700
 own dirt a 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:50.379
 despite the great similarities with the city 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.659
 order school of law order with you 

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:55.239
 skylines but not the same 

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:56.950
 sloppy crap before as mexes and city 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:58.720
 skylines is in comparison to the big one 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:59.440
 prototype namely completely offline 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.450
 playable 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:04.659
 You can always save from and 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:06.159
 older games load mods are from 

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:08.109
 supported and with the house 

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:10.239
 enclosed editors can be new 

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:11.739
 building and card design the 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:13.590
 featureliste actually sounds like that 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:15.519
 dream of every urban planner 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:17.260
 however, you have to go for one 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:19.090
 Multiplayer mode and the exchange of goods 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.590
 between different cities within 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:22.930
 to renounce a region 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:25.330
 in return, everyone should passively one 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:27.820
 own identity including permanent residence 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:29.560
 and workplace have the simulation 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:31.240
 depth should be much greater 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:34.479
 fail than when in this regard 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.830
 disappointing simcity the finnish 

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:37.780
 Developers of the game have previously 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.530
 By the way, to cities in motion 1 and 2 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:40.060
 worked 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:42.130
 So they know each other out 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:43.330
 public transport this 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:45.430
 you use experience for one 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:47.680
 Sophisticated traffic systems in the game 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:50.169
 so the campers are different than in 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.940
 simcity uses smart shortcuts and 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:54.400
 so narrow the traffic jam 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:56.110
 next to the cars around this car 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.510
 There are also buses and trains 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:59.770
 They also deliver ships and planes 

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:04.210
 automatically trade goods and tourists 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:06.340
 to cityskylines makes so close 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:06.820
 release on march 10 an excellent 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:08.680
 impression 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:10.599
 colossi law order seems to succeed 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:12.490
 the ease of use of simcity too 

00:05:10.599 --> 00:05:14.080
 Duplicate without the problems 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:15.820
 traceability long-term motivation 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:18.430
 and ease of use 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:20.289
 competition to take over whether the 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:22.180
 very good first impression in the long-term test 

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:24.780
 confirms her release in 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:24.780
 our test
