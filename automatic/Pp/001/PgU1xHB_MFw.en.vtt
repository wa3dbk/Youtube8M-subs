simple<00:03:08.950> this<00:03:09.610> is<00:03:10.140> probably<00:03:11.140> the<00:03:11.380> first<00:03:11.500> thing

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
simple this is probably the first thing

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.350 
simple this is probably the first thing
you're<00:03:12.130> going<00:03:12.280> to<00:03:12.370> look<00:03:12.489> for<00:03:12.760> this<00:03:13.030> is<00:03:13.209> the

you're going to look for this is the

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.050 
you're going to look for this is the
controls<00:03:13.840> as<00:03:14.140> tells<00:03:14.410> you<00:03:14.650> what<00:03:14.860> to<00:03:14.890> use<00:03:15.220> with

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
controls as tells you what to use with

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.000 
controls as tells you what to use with
sod<00:03:16.330> that's<00:03:16.720> originally<00:03:17.320> the<00:03:17.470> movement<00:03:17.920> if

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
sod that's originally the movement if

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:19.650 
sod that's originally the movement if
you<00:03:18.130> don't<00:03:18.310> like<00:03:18.550> that<00:03:18.730> you<00:03:18.940> can<00:03:19.120> change<00:03:19.360> it

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
you don't like that you can change it

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:24.000 
you don't like that you can change it

that's transformable and these are

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.759 
that's transformable and these are
macros<00:03:31.209> you<00:03:31.390> can<00:03:31.570> type<00:03:31.780> anything<00:03:32.110> in<00:03:32.380> here<00:03:32.650> and

if you click those buttons it'll say it

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:39.050 
if you click those buttons it'll say it
in<00:03:34.630> game
