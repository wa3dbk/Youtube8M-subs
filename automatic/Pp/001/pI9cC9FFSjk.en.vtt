00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.720 
off now what this means is the band is
only<00:00:56.940> adjustable<00:00:57.719> in<00:00:57.899> one<00:00:58.469> way<00:00:58.829> you<00:00:59.430> can<00:00:59.609> keep

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
only adjustable in one way you can keep

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.610 
only adjustable in one way you can keep
cutting<00:01:00.059> it<00:01:00.120> down<00:01:00.359> but<00:01:00.780> there's<00:01:01.140> no<00:01:01.350> way<00:01:01.559> to

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
cutting it down but there's no way to

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.280 
cutting it down but there's no way to
make<00:01:02.010> it<00:01:02.190> fit<00:01:02.370> a<00:01:02.399> larger<00:01:02.879> wrist<00:01:03.090> again<00:01:03.420> so<00:01:04.080> if

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
make it fit a larger wrist again so if

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.859 
make it fit a larger wrist again so if
you<00:01:04.379> fall<00:01:04.589> off<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:04.799> workout<00:01:05.339> wagon<00:01:05.880> or<00:01:06.090> really

you fall off the workout wagon or really

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.289

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
work those wrist muscles you might be

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.080 
work those wrist muscles you might be
unable<00:01:09.510> to<00:01:09.659> put<00:01:10.020> on<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.590> watch<00:01:10.770> also<00:01:11.549> I'd<00:01:11.939> like

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
unable to put on the watch also I'd like

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.789 
unable to put on the watch also I'd like
to<00:01:12.150> think<00:01:12.390> I<00:01:12.540> have<00:01:12.689> a<00:01:12.720> fairly<00:01:13.229> normal<00:01:13.380> sized

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
to think I have a fairly normal sized

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.880 
to think I have a fairly normal sized
wrist<00:01:14.400> and<00:01:14.640> arm<00:01:14.909> yet<00:01:15.299> once<00:01:15.869> adjusted<00:01:16.530> when<00:01:16.770> you

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
wrist and arm yet once adjusted when you

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.590 
wrist and arm yet once adjusted when you
put<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.159> watch<00:01:17.340> on<00:01:17.610> its<00:01:17.909> it's<00:01:18.270> a<00:01:18.360> tight<00:01:18.570> fit

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
put the watch on its it's a tight fit

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.780 
put the watch on its it's a tight fit
it's<00:01:19.110> hard<00:01:19.259> to<00:01:19.350> get<00:01:19.500> it<00:01:19.619> over<00:01:19.860> your<00:01:20.009> hand<00:01:20.189> this

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
it's hard to get it over your hand this

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.340 
it's hard to get it over your hand this
is<00:01:20.850> because<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.360> metal<00:01:21.570> closing<00:01:22.200> mechanism

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
is because the metal closing mechanism

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.219 
is because the metal closing mechanism
doesn't<00:01:23.009> open<00:01:23.520> completely<00:01:23.880> out<00:01:24.780> of<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:25.049> box

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
doesn't open completely out of the box

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.870 
doesn't open completely out of the box
one<00:01:25.590> of<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:25.740> first<00:01:26.009> things<00:01:26.250> to<00:01:26.369> catch<00:01:26.670> your

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
one of the first things to catch your

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.600 
one of the first things to catch your
attention<00:01:27.360> is<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.540> cool<00:01:27.869> LED<00:01:28.439> display<00:01:28.890> by

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
attention is the cool LED display by

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.429 
attention is the cool LED display by
pressing<00:01:30.000> a<00:01:30.060> button<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.509> time<00:01:30.540> is<00:01:30.960> displayed

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
pressing a button the time is displayed

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.770 
pressing a button the time is displayed
well<00:01:31.950> first<00:01:32.250> in<00:01:32.400> hours<00:01:32.700> and<00:01:32.729> then<00:01:33.060> minutes<00:01:33.390> on

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
well first in hours and then minutes on

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.870 
well first in hours and then minutes on
what<00:01:34.020> otherwise<00:01:34.409> looks<00:01:34.710> like<00:01:34.920> simply<00:01:35.310> a<00:01:35.340> sleek

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
what otherwise looks like simply a sleek

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.990 
what otherwise looks like simply a sleek
black<00:01:36.329> band<00:01:36.780> while<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:37.890> design<00:01:38.220> is<00:01:38.430> striking

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
black band while the design is striking

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.929 
black band while the design is striking
it's<00:01:39.210> also<00:01:39.799> impractical<00:01:40.799> as<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.430> readout<00:01:41.729> is

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
it's also impractical as the readout is

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.240 
it's also impractical as the readout is
just<00:01:42.540> indecipherable<00:01:43.409> while<00:01:43.649> running<00:01:43.979> and

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
just indecipherable while running and

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.800 
just indecipherable while running and
even<00:01:44.640> if<00:01:44.820> you're<00:01:44.939> not<00:01:44.970> running<00:01:45.390> if<00:01:45.689> you're

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
even if you're not running if you're

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.240 
even if you're not running if you're
trying<00:01:46.020> to<00:01:46.110> read<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.409> display<00:01:46.770> and<00:01:47.100> even

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
trying to read the display and even
