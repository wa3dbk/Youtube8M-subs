00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 so welcome to the fourth exercises of 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:06.660
 yoga for athletes and here it goes 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:16.609
 again that we the upper body 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:19.260
 make yourself more agile in the next exercise 

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:22.789
 is again a poorly supported exercise 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:25.619
 that means we come in the push up 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:27.210
 push up and from here in 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.250
 youth this position of the 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.520
 look down healthy you go with that 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.590
 head down with the ground 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.480
 basin direction sky 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.129
 and the idea has its head closer 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.110
 toes and closer to the to 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.100
 come while at the same time your arms 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.770
 get stuck more 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.050
 his cunt goes blanket and then 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.670
 you can feel the stretching in the legs 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.570
 Backs counts by taking the heel 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:54.510
 pushes down 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:57.090
 from here we can push into the high 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.620
 up back but thinks now a poor after 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.789
 above 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.379
 we come down again 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.739
 looking dog but stay on one 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:08.939
 poor the arm the top is diagonally 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:11.510
 down the heel and from here 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:14.360
 to open again 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:19.350
 Both hands on the floor again 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:21.979
 for the upper body impression down again 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.979
 comes up 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:28.050
 and we grow the side home again 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:31.110
 but now take the other arm 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:36.480
 up remain on a walk arm 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:39.140
 diagonal down through open again and 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:42.270
 can you again push up his brings 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:44.580
 look down again 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.930
 so you can practice the exercise alternately 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.930
 one side to another 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:58.140
 you have to really body tension 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:00.450
 So I should raise these 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.790
 body tension to hold what you hold 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.070
 also community helps with the small ones 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.210
 joint-stabilizing muscles a 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.229
 effect 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:11.459
 which also holds in other sports 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.980
 especially when moving fast 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:14.910
 vigorously are very very effective I can 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.700
 only recommend it 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.560
 how many passes would you get here 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.720
 so if you are making the exercise 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.850
 I would recommend that again 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.950
 Exercise once around the body 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:31.400
 build up voltage and then 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:34.620
 alternately alternating 35 passes 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.810
 it means how many times you manage to do it 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.660
 clean of course in the execution and 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:42.840
 because how often in the week so here 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.530
 often as you can if the idea be 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:46.260
 should 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.670
 that should affect you quickly 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.390
 your agility then I would 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:52.940
 practice often 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.940
 okay also for the fifth exercise
