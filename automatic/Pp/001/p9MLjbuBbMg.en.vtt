this<00:03:49.709> market<00:03:50.069> actually<00:03:50.250> really<00:03:50.550> fun<00:03:50.730> and<00:03:51.319> now

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319 
this market actually really fun and now

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:56.380 
this market actually really fun and now
here's<00:03:52.530> the<00:03:52.620> most<00:03:52.769> important<00:03:53.370> part<00:03:53.400> to<00:03:53.880> blend

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:56.390 
here's the most important part to blend

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:00.840 
here's the most important part to blend
your<00:03:57.390> actual<00:03:58.220> foundation

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:00.850 
your actual foundation

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:03.960 
your actual foundation
this<00:04:01.480> is<00:04:01.570> more<00:04:01.750> the<00:04:01.870> contouring<00:04:02.530> part<00:04:02.950> it<00:04:03.850> will

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
this is more the contouring part it will

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.990 
this is more the contouring part it will
blend<00:04:04.270> into<00:04:04.600> a<00:04:04.840> foundation<00:04:05.700> but<00:04:06.700> what<00:04:06.850> we're

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000 
blend into a foundation but what we're

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.250 
blend into a foundation but what we're
doing<00:04:07.030> is<00:04:07.300> we're<00:04:07.480> trying<00:04:07.600> to<00:04:07.750> make<00:04:07.900> it<00:04:08.020> look<00:04:08.110> as

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:08.260 
doing is we're trying to make it look as

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:09.900 
doing is we're trying to make it look as
subtle<00:04:08.590> as<00:04:08.800> possible<00:04:09.340> so<00:04:09.400> it<00:04:09.490> looks<00:04:09.610> much

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:09.910 
subtle as possible so it looks much

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:11.340 
subtle as possible so it looks much
better<00:04:10.060> here<00:04:10.330> than<00:04:10.360> I<00:04:10.480> did<00:04:10.630> before<00:04:10.810> and<00:04:11.110> that

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:11.350 
better here than I did before and that

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:12.990 
better here than I did before and that
was<00:04:11.410> all<00:04:11.680> due<00:04:11.920> to<00:04:12.100> blending<00:04:12.490> blending<00:04:12.670> is<00:04:12.910> one

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
was all due to blending blending is one

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.280 
was all due to blending blending is one
of<00:04:13.060> the<00:04:13.150> most<00:04:13.240> important<00:04:13.660> things<00:04:13.840> to<00:04:13.990> wanna<00:04:14.110> do

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:14.290 
of the most important things to wanna do

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:16.410 
of the most important things to wanna do
after<00:04:14.920> I<00:04:15.220> finished<00:04:15.580> that<00:04:15.670> what<00:04:15.970> I<00:04:16.000> did<00:04:16.120> is<00:04:16.330> I

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:16.420 
after I finished that what I did is I

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:17.970 
after I finished that what I did is I
just<00:04:16.450> took<00:04:16.600> a<00:04:16.780> little<00:04:16.900> bit<00:04:17.140> and<00:04:17.290> apply<00:04:17.920> this

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:17.980 
just took a little bit and apply this

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:25.830 
just took a little bit and apply this
all<00:04:18.370> over<00:04:18.520> my<00:04:18.880> face

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.630 

since<00:04:26.840> the<00:04:26.960> Clarence<00:04:27.350> Lipton<00:04:27.800> my<00:04:28.340> favorite

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:28.640 
since the Clarence Lipton my favorite

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:31.660 
since the Clarence Lipton my favorite
products<00:04:29.120> it<00:04:29.600> does<00:04:29.810> down<00:04:29.990> it<00:04:30.350> uh<00:04:30.380> I<00:04:30.830> saw<00:04:31.520> how

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:31.670 
products it does down it uh I saw how

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:33.130 
products it does down it uh I saw how
red<00:04:31.940> my<00:04:31.970> lips<00:04:32.270> were<00:04:32.420> before<00:04:32.810> it's<00:04:32.930> kind<00:04:33.050> of

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:33.140 
red my lips were before it's kind of

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.560 
red my lips were before it's kind of
dull<00:04:33.470> the<00:04:33.710> color<00:04:33.950> a<00:04:34.070> little<00:04:34.190> bit<00:04:34.340> and<00:04:35.240> there's

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:35.570 
dull the color a little bit and there's

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:38.380 
dull the color a little bit and there's
a<00:04:35.630> Clarence<00:04:36.020> little<00:04:36.230> crown<00:04:36.910> and<00:04:37.910> what<00:04:38.090> this

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:38.390 
a Clarence little crown and what this

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:40.180 
a Clarence little crown and what this
one<00:04:38.660> does<00:04:38.690> this<00:04:39.050> matches<00:04:39.380> my<00:04:39.410> top<00:04:39.740> lip<00:04:39.980> color

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:40.190 
one does this matches my top lip color

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:42.820 
one does this matches my top lip color
so<00:04:40.550> the<00:04:41.120> bottom<00:04:41.540> lip<00:04:41.750> will<00:04:42.380> end<00:04:42.530> up<00:04:42.650> matching

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:42.830 
so the bottom lip will end up matching

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:45.850 
so the bottom lip will end up matching
the<00:04:43.070> top<00:04:43.310> lip<00:04:43.550> color<00:04:43.760> so<00:04:44.720> I<00:04:44.750> just<00:04:44.900> apply<00:04:45.200> just<00:04:45.590> a

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:45.860
