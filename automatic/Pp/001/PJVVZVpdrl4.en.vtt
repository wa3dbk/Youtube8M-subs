00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.870
 before creating our first line of code 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.840
 it will be necessary to type in the pile more + hours it is called a code 

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:09.289
 minimum 

00:00:09.289 --> 00:00:12.039
 it will ultimately be a kind of skeleton 

00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:15.509
 who will specify that the language we will use and well the xhtml 

00:00:16.839 --> 00:00:20.269
 so now i'm going to open note a + more alone 

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:23.369
 to introduce you to these famous lines of code 

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:27.169
 it seems a bit complicated 

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:30.539
 but in the end it is not necessary to hold me back we know that for our beginners 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.850
 we will enter our first code between the tag in 32 10 and the tag 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.020
 fermente baudis 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:40.800
 baudis meaning the body of our page 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.160
 so we'll position our cursor here and we'll go back like that 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.700
 we will be able to enter our first line of code 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.019
 we start with an incoming chevron 

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:51.380
 we have been 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:53.060
 a chevron close 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:57.690
 learn write our welcome sentence if they could the site 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.400
 2 doggie 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.600
 then we put our tags 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:02.960
 ferments 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.380
 by donating kent I see returning 

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:07.350
 this 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.600
 the rafters close 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.310
 this is the sentence we want to display a year for our first web page and 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.880
 so France welcome to the doggie site 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.240
 and so we created our first paragraph with the tag 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.920
 and as for example 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.790
 all the tags must be written in lowercase it's very important if not 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.070
 it does not work 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.390
 we are now going to save the clotte bed of our code gives 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.390
 that is to say all the basic skeleton x html 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.170
 with the line we just added 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.250
 so we will open the file menu 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.700
 we will register under 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.710
 we will select our folder my website when we have just created 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:49.480
 previously 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:50.880
 so we open it 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.880
 and then we'll have to write the name of the file 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:55.730
 who will be 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:58.390
 trial 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.180
 html 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.220
 then obviously the name of the file and kessel it is followed by its extension 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.280
 html point 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.709
 we register 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:12.859
 now no more leaving our text editor I can not anymore + 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:15.179
 making files 

00:02:15.179 --> 00:02:17.119
 equity 

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:19.779
 to see now the result of our work m 

00:02:19.779 --> 00:02:23.019
 it will be open the operator of a dose 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:26.239
 to position itself on optimhome website ouèbe 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:29.239
 find the file the holà I double click on it 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:34.419
 and then we notice that our file and it is for html appears well 

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:37.439
 we just double click on it 

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:40.579
 and thanks to the extension for html 

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:44.139
 for a dose covers the browser explorer years 

00:02:44.139 --> 00:02:47.139
 and displays the result of our work 

00:02:47.139 --> 00:02:50.139
 so we have just created a first web page 

00:02:51.869 --> 00:02:53.619
 we obviously realize that 

00:02:53.619 --> 00:02:58.209
 the p tag and all the rest of the original skeleton do not appear 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:02:59.949
 on screen happily 

00:02:59.949 --> 00:03:03.049
 the internet browser to differentiate between what's needed 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:06.049
 display lines of code 

00:03:08.779 --> 00:03:13.479
 there is in line 12 a trick that allows you to do what is called a 

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:14.969
 shortcut 

00:03:14.969 --> 00:03:19.540
 we go in this example the shortcuts for our file and 7 points html 

00:03:20.679 --> 00:03:24.619
 the shortcut is ultimately an icon that is placed on the desktop 

00:03:25.289 --> 00:03:29.069
 and they represent either file that are on our hard drive or a 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:30.449
 program launched 

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:33.049
 we will be a record also of our hard drive 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:36.049
 and double-clicking on this icon 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:40.279
 file is the program associated with this file with the extension va 

00:03:40.279 --> 00:03:42.169
 open automatically 

00:03:42.169 --> 00:03:43.980
 so to make a shortcut 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.980
 on our desktop to launch windows explorer this 

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:49.779
 so we go 

00:03:49.779 --> 00:03:53.269
 resize the explorer window to have access to the 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:55.239
 windows office or 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:57.669
 then we will get our file 

00:03:57.669 --> 00:03:59.589
 and what is html 

00:03:59.589 --> 00:04:03.369
 the art at the click of it with the right button of the mouse how does it have 

00:04:03.369 --> 00:04:04.479
 down 

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:06.419
 and we bring our file 

00:04:06.419 --> 00:04:07.609
 on the desk 

00:04:07.609 --> 00:04:11.230
 and release the right mouse button so there came up after 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:14.509
 fillon quick create the shortcuts here 

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:17.509
 and here is our accor and now on the desk 

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:20.829
 we have more than to close the explorer 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:25.030
 and so we have our accorsi essays for html that will allow us to 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:29.190
 launch our browser with the file and its relatives mn 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:32.039
 then double click on it 

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:36.620
 our browser often with the display of our page and these points 

00:04:36.619 --> 00:04:39.779
 html 

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:43.189
 you can also hold down the left mouse button 

00:04:43.189 --> 00:04:45.150
 repositioned our 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.580
 the icon on the desktop 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:51.470
 we will now address an end a very useful function of windows zone 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:54.330
 which is the kohler copy function 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.960
 this function will allow us to avoid typing it is a text m 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.830
 which can be displayed either on a self-time range in a treatment 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:01.689
 text 

00:05:01.689 --> 00:05:06.129
 in the following samples we will copy and paste on the skeleton code 

00:05:06.129 --> 00:05:08.569
 which is at the beginning of this article 

00:05:08.569 --> 00:05:12.379
 this manipulation will save you from typing code to save time 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:16.219
 so we're going to have the governor perry 14 an actor 

00:05:16.219 --> 00:05:19.219
 in order to access the page what interests us 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:24.780
 we will offer the computer section click here on articles 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:27.330
 created a web page 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:31.660
 then we will scroll our article to find our code 

00:05:31.659 --> 00:05:32.480
 what you are 

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:34.159
 x html 

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:35.889
 what we want to copy 

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:37.499
 so here it is 

00:05:37.499 --> 00:05:40.939
 holding the left mouse button is folded we can select 

00:05:40.939 --> 00:05:45.519
 so place the text that interests us then in the blue part ii we go 

00:05:45.519 --> 00:05:48.519
 right-click with the mouse but we will copy 

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:52.169
 we can now close the browser 

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:56.579
 now here is our text is in what's called the buffer or 

00:05:56.579 --> 00:05:57.430
 dose 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:00.889
 ie windows that concert in his memory what we just 

00:06:00.889 --> 00:06:04.369
 copy so you can use it later 

00:06:04.369 --> 00:06:08.629
 the goal now is to insert the text that we have copied into our 

00:06:08.629 --> 00:06:11.169
 aa2 note text editor 

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:14.409
 so for that obviously one must open note a little weaker 

00:06:16.189 --> 00:06:20.930
 we will make a right-click with the mouse which will bring us a menu that will 

00:06:20.929 --> 00:06:23.059
 allow us to paste the text 

00:06:23.059 --> 00:06:25.439
 where the cursor was 

00:06:25.439 --> 00:06:30.259
 so we did not have to attack the text that we took in the article the 

00:06:30.259 --> 00:06:31.789
 first web page 

00:06:31.789 --> 00:06:34.900
 the copy and paste function allows us to save a lot of time 

00:06:36.219 --> 00:06:39.329
 this is a valuable feature found in most programs 

00:06:39.329 --> 00:06:40.059
 of windows 7
