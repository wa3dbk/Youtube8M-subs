guards<00:00:23.609> you<00:00:24.150> know<00:00:24.269> work<00:00:24.600> to<00:00:24.750> just<00:00:24.930> protect

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
guards you know work to just protect

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:26.929 
guards you know work to just protect
your<00:00:25.470> hook<00:00:25.680> but<00:00:25.920> what<00:00:26.099> you<00:00:26.189> want<00:00:26.369> to<00:00:26.460> do<00:00:26.580> is

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
your hook but what you want to do is

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.849 
your hook but what you want to do is
trim<00:00:27.390> them<00:00:27.510> off<00:00:27.599> just<00:00:28.050> a<00:00:28.199> little<00:00:28.230> bit<00:00:28.529> and

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
trim them off just a little bit and

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.650 
trim them off just a little bit and
actually<00:00:29.490> trim<00:00:29.730> them<00:00:29.880> at<00:00:29.939> a<00:00:29.970> slight<00:00:30.240> angle<00:00:30.449> so

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
actually trim them at a slight angle so

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.089 
actually trim them at a slight angle so
instead<00:00:30.960> of<00:00:31.019> trimming<00:00:31.260> them<00:00:31.439> straight<00:00:31.890> I'm

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
instead of trimming them straight I'm

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.310 
instead of trimming them straight I'm
gonna<00:00:32.250> follow<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.300> same<00:00:33.450> contours<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.110> hook

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
gonna follow the same contours the hook

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.950 
gonna follow the same contours the hook
and<00:00:34.530> then<00:00:35.190> trim<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.670> weed<00:00:35.820> guard<00:00:36.090> and<00:00:36.329> to<00:00:36.809> do

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
and then trim the weed guard and to do

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.600 
and then trim the weed guard and to do
that<00:00:37.170> generally<00:00:37.800> I'm<00:00:37.890> gonna<00:00:38.040> put<00:00:38.250> this<00:00:38.399> in<00:00:38.579> my

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
that generally I'm gonna put this in my

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.709 
that generally I'm gonna put this in my
hand<00:00:38.969> to<00:00:39.149> hold<00:00:39.360> it<00:00:39.600> steady<00:00:39.950> lay<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.129> hook<00:00:41.719> you

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
hand to hold it steady lay the hook you

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.440 
hand to hold it steady lay the hook you
know<00:00:42.809> same<00:00:43.350> same<00:00:43.940> perpendicular<00:00:44.940> parallel<00:00:45.090> to

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
know same same perpendicular parallel to

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:54.740 
know same same perpendicular parallel to
the<00:00:45.570> hook<00:00:46.079> and<00:00:46.320> then<00:00:47.039> just<00:00:47.280> cut<00:00:47.520> off<00:00:53.480> to<00:00:54.480> really

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
the hook and then just cut off to really

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.660 
the hook and then just cut off to really
work<00:00:55.050> most<00:00:55.680> of<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:55.920> times<00:00:56.190> when<00:00:56.430> I'm<00:00:56.550> fishing

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
work most of the times when I'm fishing

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.610 
work most of the times when I'm fishing
a<00:00:56.850> football<00:00:57.180> jig<00:00:57.390> this<00:00:57.750> is<00:00:57.899> in<00:00:58.020> rocks<00:00:58.350> and

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
a football jig this is in rocks and

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.110 
a football jig this is in rocks and
cover<00:00:58.859> like<00:00:59.039> that<00:00:59.250> so<00:00:59.520> it's<00:00:59.670> not<00:00:59.820> something

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
cover like that so it's not something

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.790 
cover like that so it's not something
where<00:01:00.270> I<00:01:00.390> really<00:01:00.899> need<00:01:01.079> that<00:01:01.109> if<00:01:01.350> I<00:01:01.410> got<00:01:01.559> brush

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
where I really need that if I got brush

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.680 
where I really need that if I got brush
possible<00:01:02.280> I<00:01:02.430> might<00:01:02.879> leave<00:01:03.120> it<00:01:03.270> just<00:01:03.300> a<00:01:03.570> little

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
possible I might leave it just a little

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:04.460 
possible I might leave it just a little
bit<00:01:03.809> longer

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
bit longer

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:05.870 
bit longer
the<00:01:04.650> next<00:01:04.830> thing<00:01:04.920> I'm<00:01:05.010> gonna<00:01:05.100> do<00:01:05.189> is<00:01:05.220> flex<00:01:05.549> the

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
the next thing I'm gonna do is flex the

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.910 
the next thing I'm gonna do is flex the
Flex<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.600> weak<00:01:06.780> parts<00:01:07.020> of<00:01:07.140> back<00:01:07.350> and<00:01:07.560> forwards

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
Flex the weak parts of back and forwards

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.289 
Flex the weak parts of back and forwards
and<00:01:08.130> what<00:01:08.460> that's<00:01:08.700> gonna<00:01:08.790> do<00:01:08.939> it<00:01:09.060> you<00:01:09.150> can

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
and what that's gonna do it you can

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:10.640 
and what that's gonna do it you can
split<00:01:09.570> it<00:01:09.630> if<00:01:09.810> you<00:01:09.930> like<00:01:10.110> there's<00:01:10.439> a<00:01:10.500> number

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
split it if you like there's a number

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:11.840 
split it if you like there's a number
ways<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:10.950> do<00:01:11.040> this<00:01:11.130> but<00:01:11.310> what<00:01:11.430> I'm<00:01:11.520> gonna<00:01:11.640> do<00:01:11.760> is

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
ways to do this but what I'm gonna do is

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.190 
ways to do this but what I'm gonna do is
just<00:01:12.030> kind<00:01:12.180> of<00:01:12.210> loosen<00:01:12.479> it<00:01:12.659> up<00:01:12.780> sometimes

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
just kind of loosen it up sometimes

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.510 
just kind of loosen it up sometimes
you'll<00:01:13.350> get<00:01:13.470> glue<00:01:13.830> or<00:01:13.979> something<00:01:14.220> that<00:01:14.340> makes

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
you'll get glue or something that makes

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.219 
you'll get glue or something that makes
it<00:01:14.640> real<00:01:14.790> stiff<00:01:15.090> I<00:01:15.330> want<00:01:15.810> something<00:01:16.080> that's

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
it real stiff I want something that's

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.929 
it real stiff I want something that's
going<00:01:16.439> to<00:01:16.500> collapse<00:01:16.860> really<00:01:17.100> easy<00:01:17.280> allow<00:01:17.880> that

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
going to collapse really easy allow that

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.480 
going to collapse really easy allow that
hook<00:01:18.450> to<00:01:18.479> do<00:01:18.720> its<00:01:18.900> job<00:01:19.049> to<00:01:19.229> penetrate<00:01:19.710> and<00:01:20.310> next

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
hook to do its job to penetrate and next

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:21.530 
hook to do its job to penetrate and next
thing<00:01:20.549> I<00:01:20.610> look<00:01:20.759> at<00:01:20.850> is<00:01:20.909> I<00:01:21.060> look<00:01:21.210> at<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.330> cert

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
thing I look at is I look at the cert

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.649 
thing I look at is I look at the cert
link<00:01:21.920> and<00:01:22.920> in<00:01:23.640> most<00:01:23.909> situations

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
link and in most situations

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.929 
link and in most situations
I<00:01:24.810> like<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.710> same<00:01:26.189> stroke<00:01:26.460> link<00:01:26.670> that's<00:01:26.820> on

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
I like the same stroke link that's on

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.820 
I like the same stroke link that's on
there<00:01:27.150> if<00:01:27.270> you're<00:01:27.420> in<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:27.600> summertime<00:01:28.110> you<00:01:28.290> go

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
water what I'll do is I put my fingers

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.710 
water what I'll do is I put my fingers
across<00:01:30.840> it<00:01:31.050> and<00:01:31.410> trim<00:01:31.740> it<00:01:31.860> just<00:01:31.890> slightly<00:01:32.720> and

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
across it and trim it just slightly and

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.090 
across it and trim it just slightly and
what<00:01:33.930> I'll<00:01:34.020> do<00:01:34.140> is<00:01:34.230> trimming<00:01:34.470> it<00:01:34.650> upwards

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
what I'll do is trimming it upwards

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.970 
what I'll do is trimming it upwards
angle<00:01:35.490> like<00:01:36.150> this<00:01:38.570> and<00:01:39.570> all<00:01:40.320> that's<00:01:40.590> gonna<00:01:40.740> do

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:40.980 
angle like this and all that's gonna do

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:43.520 
angle like this and all that's gonna do
is<00:01:41.520> allow<00:01:41.700> that<00:01:42.060> skirt<00:01:42.420> to<00:01:42.600> flare<00:01:42.960> a<00:01:42.990> little

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
is allow that skirt to flare a little

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.620 
is allow that skirt to flare a little
bit<00:01:43.620> more<00:01:43.830> a<00:01:44.070> little<00:01:44.400> quicker<00:01:44.640> as<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:45.270> shorter

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
bit more a little quicker as the shorter

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.210 
bit more a little quicker as the shorter
your<00:01:45.750> skirt<00:01:45.990> is<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.470> more<00:01:46.650> it'll<00:01:46.800> come<00:01:47.010> out

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220
