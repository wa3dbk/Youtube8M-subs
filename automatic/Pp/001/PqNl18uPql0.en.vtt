00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.860
 that day 

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:11.730
 as well 

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:13.350
 very ones all guys that I like and 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.380
 not as I say I bring you the second 

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:17.910
 episode of the series let's say miniseries 

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:20.550
 of tricks in which the guys again 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.560
 by the logic camera the first three 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.150
 groups I bring a little trick on stone front 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.980
 of the second senate quito in whitehouse 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.960
 the names of the weapon for shadow no longer 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.849
 I know it's costing me to do work 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.349
 to learn me and well first what 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.940
 we have here in this melts if there 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.200
 here to the cornice above to monitor 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.150
 a little the map the truth when it's a 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.980
 very good trick is simply a spot 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:39.329
 so I do not know to improve the 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.280
 competitive or anything else is 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.840
 easy enough but let's say the trick 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.400
 trick that there is in this map that is very 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.860
 cool is to get on this poster of 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.180
 advertising and good, well, sometimes at 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.410
 better is a little harder and that's 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.940
 to do it carefully with the sea and 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.950
 that as I told you in the previous trick 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.410
 be the easiest things but good 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:57.030
 can do perfectly without the maniac 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:58.560
 from this advertising poster because we 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.580
 We got some cables that are here 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.320
 of those cables and we go through the 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.820
 cornice we reached the other cable and 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.199
 we started to raise the cable little by little 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.759
 on the left without touching us with the 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.350
 right part we make a little jump 

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:10.110
 so to be able to jump to the next 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.970
 to be able to free let's say that's what 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.429
 there is and we jump forward and we 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.170
 we managed to get incredibly into the 

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:19.909
 roof or ceiling 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.500
 we can monitor obviously we can 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:23.750
 kill obviously we can kill who 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.220
 is simply expect us to then 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.890
 they wait for us to be there 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:30.770
 the example that I think has brought out another 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.630
 who doing this this truquillo lara 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.119
 that is a very good trick but it has 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.170
 perfected because we know what good 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:38.300
 that we were looking for 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.460
 internet and such and we have managed then 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.530
 try to get behind because it's a bit 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.090
 I do not know if you do not get it right at the 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.030
 first play the video again what 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.470
 see how many times it is needed and when 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.440
 put the edge and consider throwing 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.729
 So, let's say, go kidnapping and 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.159
 hey, he managed to get into the room 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:56.360
 Right, the truth is that it's a little mess 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:58.550
 as I'm saying is a trick that 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.170
 they are very cool you can put with the 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:02.929
 franco there are crouched you can put os 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.940
 you can go out they're going to kill us below 

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:06.500
 obviously he can simply kill you in 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.300
 your line sniper divisions 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.619
 that you have in the house opposite 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.970
 you can move around the area that 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:12.019
 you want and all that but with a lot 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.690
 care of the allies because their 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:16.790
 expulsion you go then suicidal and when 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.650
 Let 's finish the site map MorÃ­s you the 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.000
 second touch is here on the east map of 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.950
 wilson that is the map of the mine that 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.060
 good that always in this frame is where 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.190
 the champions are put 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.660
 the controller and all that is to get on the 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.099
 water that the truth is pretty cool 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.099
 you can put it on a little 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:32.690
 out of the map I tell you then you see 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:34.040
 you have the camera to be able 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.739
 upload or if such I think it 's still 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.030
 no it's not a trick trick just do not 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:39.680
 it's like it's been said is a head life 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.430
 after that it's pretty good for 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.690
 do it but let's say how good they are 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.370
 exhibitions or sites that people do not 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.680
 knows that it is very good and that it can 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.940
 save one course other than that good 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.130
 so you can go to the ships that are 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.920
 moored on the outside and that and if there 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:56.450
 to the mast of this ship, you can 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.769
 good forgiveness to the play of this mast 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.540
 you can go to the cornice of this 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:01.489
 building but with the pity that it is not 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.560
 same as in the freight map that you 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:04.940
 we teach getting is the roof here 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.769
 can climb the ledge but do not know 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.360
 can climb to the roof top does not leave 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:09.799
 the truth that would be a hoot but 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.650
 well you can put us here the wta that 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:15.230
 It is is fine is not a lot is 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:17.299
 other than me quite interesting and good 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.709
 because on Sunday I have more tricks guys 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:22.120
 so I hope you liked this one 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:22.120
 mini video the favorite is this following
