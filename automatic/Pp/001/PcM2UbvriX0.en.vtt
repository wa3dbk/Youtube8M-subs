00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
instead of buying one obviously we have

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.430 
instead of buying one obviously we have
to<00:00:38.250> consider<00:00:38.730> the<00:00:38.820> depreciation<00:00:39.660> of<00:00:40.079> a

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
home you'll be looking at perhaps losing

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.240 
home you'll be looking at perhaps losing
twenty<00:00:45.329> percent<00:00:45.570> in<00:00:45.780> your<00:00:45.899> first<00:00:46.170> year<00:00:46.289> so

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
twenty percent in your first year so

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.250 
twenty percent in your first year so
actually<00:00:47.520> that's<00:00:47.579> an<00:00:47.969> issue<00:00:48.090> and<00:00:48.780> a<00:00:49.110> lot<00:00:49.200> of

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
actually that's an issue and a lot of

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.810 
actually that's an issue and a lot of
people<00:00:49.530> don't<00:00:49.680> have<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:49.920> room<00:00:50.070> to<00:00:50.340> keep<00:00:50.700> a

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820

motor<00:00:51.000> home<00:00:51.120> on<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.390> dry<00:00:51.629> for<00:00:51.930> example<00:00:52.500> so<00:00:53.250> we

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
motor home on the dry for example so we

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.100 
motor home on the dry for example so we
solve<00:00:53.699> that<00:00:53.850> problem<00:00:54.120> you<00:00:54.480> also<00:00:54.750> get<00:00:54.840> a<00:00:54.899> motor

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
solve that problem you also get a motor

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.080 
solve that problem you also get a motor
that's<00:00:55.260> fully<00:00:55.590> equipped<00:00:55.920> you'll<00:00:56.160> get<00:00:56.370> while

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
that's fully equipped you'll get while

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.639 
that's fully equipped you'll get while
it<00:00:57.210> comes<00:00:57.449> with<00:00:57.600> your<00:00:57.750> insurance<00:00:58.140> and

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
someone has a mic down from us what they

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.080 
someone has a mic down from us what they
can<00:01:33.479> expect<00:01:33.630> is<00:01:34.200> is<00:01:34.979> a<00:01:35.040> new<00:01:35.340> clean<00:01:35.670> fully

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
can expect is is a new clean fully

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.880 
can expect is is a new clean fully
equipped<00:01:36.270> motor<00:01:36.540> home<00:01:36.840> so<00:01:37.140> what<00:01:37.350> we'll<00:01:37.500> put<00:01:37.770> in
