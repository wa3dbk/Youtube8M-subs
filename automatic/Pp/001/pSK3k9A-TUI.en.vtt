00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
my back though not really this is just

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.609 
my back though not really this is just
what<00:01:42.150> it's<00:01:42.270> like<00:01:42.479> when<00:01:42.659> I'm<00:01:42.810> productive<00:01:43.439> with

my time instead of being a lazy ass

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.480 
my time instead of being a lazy ass
that's<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.350> way<00:01:46.439> it<00:01:46.560> should<00:01:46.619> be<00:01:46.829> all<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.189> time

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490
