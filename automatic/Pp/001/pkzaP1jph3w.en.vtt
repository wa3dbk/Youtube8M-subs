that<00:01:03.329> we're<00:01:03.510> aware<00:01:03.629> of<00:01:03.949> the<00:01:04.949> concept<00:01:05.369> came

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
that we're aware of the concept came

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.700 
that we're aware of the concept came
about<00:01:05.790> from<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.090> owner<00:01:06.360> of<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.869> park<00:01:07.260> he<00:01:07.590> had

about from the owner of the park he had

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.160 
about from the owner of the park he had
repelled<00:01:08.070> down<00:01:08.159> into<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.670> canyons<00:01:09.180> and<00:01:09.390> was

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
repelled down into the canyons and was

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.140 
repelled down into the canyons and was
very<00:01:10.350> fascinated<00:01:10.650> by<00:01:11.220> it<00:01:11.280> and<00:01:11.460> decided<00:01:12.030> that

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
very fascinated by it and decided that

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.640 
very fascinated by it and decided that
he'd<00:01:12.420> need<00:01:12.540> to<00:01:12.689> get<00:01:12.840> some<00:01:12.990> visitors<00:01:13.409> down

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
he'd need to get some visitors down

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:15.969 
he'd need to get some visitors down
there<00:01:13.890> to<00:01:14.130> see<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.640> raw<00:01:14.760> space<00:01:15.030> in<00:01:15.299> himself

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:15.979 
there to see the raw space in himself

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:19.370 
there to see the raw space in himself
the<00:01:16.979> highest<00:01:17.280> part<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.820> cliff<00:01:18.330> walk<00:01:18.570> is<00:01:18.780> 300

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
the highest part the cliff walk is 300

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.249 
the highest part the cliff walk is 300
feet<00:01:19.700> above<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:20.909> river<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.509> capilano<00:01:21.869> river

so<00:01:22.740> if<00:01:22.830> you<00:01:22.890> took<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.130> Statue<00:01:23.369> of<00:01:23.549> Liberty

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
so if you took the Statue of Liberty

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.670 
so if you took the Statue of Liberty
from<00:01:24.030> New<00:01:24.210> York<00:01:24.450> and<00:01:24.689> had<00:01:25.110> two<00:01:25.290> of<00:01:25.320> them<00:01:25.500> made

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
from New York and had two of them made

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:26.960 
from New York and had two of them made
and<00:01:25.920> stuck<00:01:26.130> one<00:01:26.310> on<00:01:26.430> top<00:01:26.640> of<00:01:26.759> each<00:01:26.820> other

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
and stuck one on top of each other

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.210 
and stuck one on top of each other
that's<00:01:27.299> about<00:01:28.020> how<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.290> eyes<00:01:28.619> point<00:01:28.979> to<00:01:29.130> the

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
that's about how the eyes point to the

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.330 
that's about how the eyes point to the
