00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.950 
practically begging for me to do camp
videos<00:00:07.049> so<00:00:07.980> I<00:00:08.400> thought<00:00:08.910> I<00:00:09.090> would<00:00:09.480> get<00:00:09.750> an

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
videos so I thought I would get an

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.129 
videos so I thought I would get an
earlier<00:00:10.349> start<00:00:10.860> this<00:00:11.280> year<00:00:11.519> because<00:00:11.900> you<00:00:12.900> guys

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
earlier start this year because you guys

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.220 
earlier start this year because you guys
have<00:00:13.590> been<00:00:13.740> wanting<00:00:14.009> them<00:00:14.370> for<00:00:14.880> a<00:00:14.910> while<00:00:15.330> so<00:00:15.900> I

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
have been wanting them for a while so I

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.220 
have been wanting them for a while so I
thought<00:00:16.680> why<00:00:17.070> not<00:00:17.100> just<00:00:17.699> you<00:00:17.880> know<00:00:18.090> get<00:00:18.720> to<00:00:19.080> it

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
thought why not just you know get to it

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.150 
thought why not just you know get to it
so<00:00:19.560> I'm<00:00:19.890> doing<00:00:20.279> a<00:00:20.609> two-part<00:00:21.420> series<00:00:21.810> and<00:00:22.289> today

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
so I'm doing a two-part series and today

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.730 
so I'm doing a two-part series and today

because<00:00:26.220> I<00:00:26.250> think<00:00:26.609> most<00:00:26.820> of<00:00:26.910> you<00:00:27.029> guys<00:00:27.119> have

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
because I think most of you guys have

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.000 
because I think most of you guys have
more<00:00:27.480> questions<00:00:27.660> about<00:00:27.960> what<00:00:28.680> to<00:00:28.800> pack<00:00:28.949> for
