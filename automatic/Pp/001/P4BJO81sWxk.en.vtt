00:00:09.089 --> 00:00:13.730
 Guadalajara 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:16.630
 it's like we all know the second city 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:20.769
 from this country 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:23.660
 and it has a long complicated history and 

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:29.840
 often hazardous 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:31.580
 it is a settlement whose origins were 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:35.600
 very complicated since they had to 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:39.440
 give four foundations remember that a 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:42.170
 Guzman's boy wanted a capital for 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:45.290
 an imaginary kingdom that for him 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:47.570
 would represent an immense fortune and 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:50.390
 then a group of 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:53.390
 Spaniards look for the west of the 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:57.610
 country the seat for the capital of a 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:59.680
 kingdom that was going to be the new galicia 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:02.190
 after wandering through different 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:05.850
 locations 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:08.190
 this group of Spaniards found in 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.880
 the valley of atemajac its seat 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:14.390
 definitive 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:16.760
 is the valley of atemajac a region in 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:20.390
 many senses privileged 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:23.600
 where they found themselves but resources 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:27.530
 too abundant if a noble land 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:31.010
 upon which the 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:33.800
 beginning of what is now a 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:35.480
 conurbation that has four million 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.400
 three hundred thousand inhabitants 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:41.330
 approximately 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:43.820
 and that keeps a rich history 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:47.210
 a series of characteristics very 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:50.420
 specials that make it a 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:52.810
 Particularly endearing city in 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.810
 many senses 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:58.610
 Guadalajara was the limit when it was 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:03.590
 founded from the west 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:06.670
 it was the most extreme part of a 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.700
 colonization that had started in 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.640
 1521 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:15.420
 and that extended to all 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:19.760
 winds but particularly towards the 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:22.110
 Pacific Ocean where 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:25.410
 Guadalajara is a key piece for the 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:29.580
 articulation of the entire coast e 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:32.540
 even for colonization beyond 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:36.690
 the seas through what was done 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:40.569
 as great efforts towards 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:43.829
 philippines and even more 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:43.829
 distant destinations 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.870
 I'm going to talk a little bit about the 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.890
 Bone morphology of the general forms 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.890
 of the main elements 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:03:00.550
 this region of Guadalajara to explain 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:03.740
 a little bit its location and its way of 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:07.070
 be on this planet 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:09.650
 in this graph that we have here is 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:14.600
 let's say seen from the north and 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:16.700
 clearly understandable as the city 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:19.480
 whose main core was in this 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:23.330
 part settled in the valley of atemajac 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:26.090
 that is limited by an accident that 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:28.190
 is fundamental not only for the 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.680
 history of Guadalajara but for the 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:32.780
 history of colonization and of 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.550
 civilization of the whole country 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:39.430
 this 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:43.870
 natural failure caused by the 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:48.420
 riverbed of the great river of santiago limits 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:51.609
 to the north and very drastically 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:53.879
 the possibilities of progress towards these 

00:03:51.609 --> 00:03:53.879
 territories 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:59.799
 in fact the functions of Guadalajara 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:02.980
 They hesitated to do it north of the 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:06.219
 Oblate canyon or over the valley of 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:09.650
 atemajac until they finally had 

00:04:06.219 --> 00:04:12.739
 what to do in this part 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:16.109
 fundamental information about birth 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:19.530
 Guadalajara and about your 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:22.039
 nature is the existence of the river of san 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:22.039
 juan de dios 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:29.270
 it was 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:34.069
 let's say a few hundred rods 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:36.199
 then of the original foundation and 

00:04:34.069 --> 00:04:38.240
 that was the birthmark of the 

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:40.400
 city that settled here those 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:43.159
 Spanish because they had evidently in 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:46.689
 an aquatic resource on hand that is 

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:49.119
 this river of san juan de dios what 

00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:52.989
 with the passage of time and advancing in 

00:04:49.119 --> 00:04:56.610
 a little was years after tubing 

00:04:52.989 --> 00:04:59.919
 and sadly turned into a cloaca 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:02.849
 which precisely leads to 

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:06.039
 oblate canyon but going back to the 

00:05:02.849 --> 00:05:09.909
 the general morphology around 

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:12.279
 atemajac valley that is limited to 

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:15.249
 this way we already found towards this 

00:05:12.279 --> 00:05:18.279
 side the valley of tesistÃ¡n a valley of 

00:05:15.249 --> 00:05:20.259
 an amazing fertility where you 

00:05:18.279 --> 00:05:24.550
 obtain or obtain crops 

00:05:20.259 --> 00:05:27.780
 extraordinary towards this side that is 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:30.570
 the south side the valley of toluquilla 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:32.490
 here is the mountains of spring 

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:36.289
 which is one of the elements 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:40.789
 fundamental to achieve 

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:43.729
 a microclimate that is privileged is 

00:05:40.789 --> 00:05:45.360
 observe here the lagoon of 

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:49.349
 chapala 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:52.729
 whose existence also helps to have 

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:56.099
 absolutely environmental conditions 

00:05:52.729 --> 00:05:59.460
 favorable for the entire region after 

00:05:56.099 --> 00:06:01.740
 follow the valleys of sayula 

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:03.960
 that are all this part that are lakes 

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:06.660
 now almost extinct but that in a 

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:09.150
 given a part of a whole 

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:13.639
 great lake that extended even 

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:16.969
 to this direction and to the bottom 

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:20.749
 the volcano of colima that is like the 

00:06:16.969 --> 00:06:23.779
 end of the entire neovolcanic axis that 

00:06:20.749 --> 00:06:26.599
 ends in Lake Chapala these 

00:06:23.779 --> 00:06:28.789
 are let's say the fundamental elements 

00:06:26.599 --> 00:06:32.210
 that make up the general region of 

00:06:28.789 --> 00:06:36.639
 Guadalajara and without whose understanding is 

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:40.639
 very difficult to understand why and how it was 

00:06:36.639 --> 00:06:43.849
 established here this city that now 

00:06:40.639 --> 00:06:47.349
 we know but its principles was very 

00:06:43.849 --> 00:06:47.349
 modest responded 

00:06:47.969 --> 00:06:56.059
 let's say very immediate needs and 

00:06:51.179 --> 00:06:56.059
 gradually began to evolve
