so<00:02:01.890> guys<00:02:02.070> I<00:02:02.250> just<00:02:02.280> got<00:02:02.460> out<00:02:02.700> of<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:02.850> water<00:02:03.060> with

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:03.510 
so guys I just got out of the water with

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:05.300 
so guys I just got out of the water with
the<00:02:03.630> hip<00:02:03.780> case<00:02:04.020> bro<00:02:04.380> and<00:02:04.530> I<00:02:04.620> just<00:02:04.830> noticed

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
the hip case bro and I just noticed

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.490 
the hip case bro and I just noticed
coming<00:02:05.760> out<00:02:05.880> there's<00:02:06.600> actually<00:02:06.750> water<00:02:07.110> in<00:02:07.350> my

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
coming out there's actually water in my

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.680 
coming out there's actually water in my
case<00:02:07.860> but<00:02:08.070> I'm<00:02:08.220> still<00:02:08.520> recording<00:02:09.030> this<00:02:09.360> video

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
case but I'm still recording this video

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.080 
case but I'm still recording this video
so<00:02:10.290> I<00:02:10.530> don't<00:02:11.100> think<00:02:11.250> the<00:02:11.340> water<00:02:11.520> damage<00:02:11.910> is

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
so I don't think the water damage is

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.270 
so I don't think the water damage is
extensive<00:02:12.390> or<00:02:12.960> maybe<00:02:13.380> not<00:02:13.590> at<00:02:13.770> all<00:02:13.950> but<00:02:14.130> there

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
extensive or maybe not at all but there

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.730 
extensive or maybe not at all but there
is<00:02:14.370> definitely<00:02:14.610> water<00:02:15.180> in<00:02:15.420> this<00:02:15.570> soft<00:02:16.470> part<00:02:16.680> of

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
is definitely water in this soft part of

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.030 
is definitely water in this soft part of
the<00:02:16.800> case<00:02:17.100> so<00:02:17.490> given<00:02:18.270> that<00:02:18.300> I've<00:02:18.480> only<00:02:18.690> got<00:02:18.930> one

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
the case so given that I've only got one

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.950 
the case so given that I've only got one
camera<00:02:20.210> you<00:02:21.210> might<00:02:21.300> have<00:02:21.480> to<00:02:21.570> try<00:02:21.720> to<00:02:21.780> look

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
camera you might have to try to look

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.590 
camera you might have to try to look
inside<00:02:22.110> my<00:02:22.940> reflection<00:02:23.940> of<00:02:24.030> my<00:02:24.090> glasses<00:02:24.360> to

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
inside my reflection of my glasses to

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:25.850 
inside my reflection of my glasses to
see<00:02:24.630> what's<00:02:24.900> kind<00:02:25.140> of<00:02:25.200> going<00:02:25.260> off<00:02:25.620> I<00:02:25.710> gonna

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
see what's kind of going off I gonna

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.800 
see what's kind of going off I gonna
crack<00:02:26.130> it<00:02:26.280> open<00:02:26.370> and<00:02:26.550> see<00:02:26.670> how<00:02:26.970> awful<00:02:27.690> the

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
crack it open and see how awful the

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.960 
crack it open and see how awful the
damage<00:02:28.140> is<00:02:30.800> so<00:02:31.800> as<00:02:31.920> you<00:02:32.070> can<00:02:32.160> see<00:02:32.220> here<00:02:32.700> there

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
damage is so as you can see here there

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.400 
damage is so as you can see here there
is<00:02:33.000> water<00:02:33.300> it<00:02:33.570> looks<00:02:33.660> like<00:02:33.840> there's<00:02:34.050> water<00:02:34.170> on

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
is water it looks like there's water on

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.620 
is water it looks like there's water on
the<00:02:34.500> inside<00:02:34.890> of<00:02:35.040> the<00:02:35.160> HCL<00:02:35.730> if<00:02:36.000> you<00:02:36.180> look<00:02:36.300> at<00:02:36.450> the

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
the inside of the HCL if you look at the

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.390 
the inside of the HCL if you look at the
stuff<00:02:37.080> at<00:02:37.230> the<00:02:37.260> top<00:02:37.350> there<00:02:37.800> is<00:02:37.830> water<00:02:38.100> on<00:02:38.220> the

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
stuff at the top there is water on the

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.980 
stuff at the top there is water on the
outside<00:02:38.760> of<00:02:38.880> âge<00:02:39.030> just<00:02:39.390> I<00:02:39.480> don't<00:02:39.600> think<00:02:39.750> water

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
outside of âge just I don't think water

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:41.960 
outside of âge just I don't think water
got<00:02:40.230> it<00:02:40.350> through<00:02:40.530> the<00:02:40.620> top<00:02:40.890> I<00:02:41.160> think<00:02:41.700> it<00:02:41.790> kind

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
got it through the top I think it kind

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.730 
got it through the top I think it kind
of<00:02:42.030> came<00:02:42.240> in<00:02:42.360> through<00:02:42.540> the<00:02:42.660> side<00:02:42.990> where<00:02:43.680> I

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740 
of came in through the side where I

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.410 
of came in through the side where I
pointed<00:02:44.100> to<00:02:44.220> in<00:02:44.370> the<00:02:44.459> first<00:02:44.670> place<00:02:44.790> I'd<00:02:45.240> have

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
pointed to in the first place I'd have

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.060 
pointed to in the first place I'd have
to<00:02:45.510> go<00:02:45.630> back<00:02:45.810> outside<00:02:46.020> again<00:02:46.290> I<00:02:46.530> was<00:02:46.770> doing<00:02:47.010> a

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
to go back outside again I was doing a

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:48.650 
to go back outside again I was doing a
couple<00:02:47.340> of<00:02:47.430> pretty<00:02:47.730> deep<00:02:47.970> dives<00:02:48.240> I<00:02:48.450> would<00:02:48.540> say

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
couple of pretty deep dives I would say

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.699 
couple of pretty deep dives I would say
about<00:02:48.810> 15<00:02:49.140> to<00:02:49.230> 20<00:02:49.470> feet<00:02:49.709> so<00:02:51.650> apparently<00:02:52.650> this

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
about 15 to 20 feet so apparently this

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:54.320 
about 15 to 20 feet so apparently this
case<00:02:52.920> isn't<00:02:53.130> as<00:02:53.310> waterproof<00:02:53.790> as<00:02:53.910> we<00:02:54.060> thought

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
case isn't as waterproof as we thought

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.780 
case isn't as waterproof as we thought
the<00:02:54.810> Chester<00:02:55.230> was<00:02:55.380> nice<00:02:55.620> nice<00:02:56.130> not<00:02:56.489> fit<00:02:56.700> around

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
the Chester was nice nice not fit around

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.560 
the Chester was nice nice not fit around
