00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290

your<00:00:10.740> view<00:00:10.980> that<00:00:11.040> history<00:00:11.550> is<00:00:11.580> fundamentally

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
your view that history is fundamentally

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.450 
your view that history is fundamentally
absurd<00:00:12.600> or<00:00:12.870> are<00:00:13.110> you<00:00:13.230> do<00:00:13.980> you<00:00:14.220> are<00:00:14.280> more

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
absurd or are you do you are more

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.640 
absurd or are you do you are more
positive<00:00:14.880> about<00:00:15.000> human<00:00:15.720> history<00:00:16.049> than<00:00:16.230> that<00:00:16.410> I

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
positive about human history than that I

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.609 
positive about human history than that I
think<00:00:17.130> first<00:00:17.669> I<00:00:17.849> think<00:00:17.910> that<00:00:18.300> history<00:00:18.509> is<00:00:18.810> a<00:00:18.960> is

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
think first I think that history is a is

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.579 
think first I think that history is a is
a<00:00:19.710> material<00:00:20.669> it's<00:00:21.329> our<00:00:21.539> drill<00:00:21.839> until<00:00:22.230> you<00:00:22.380> say

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:22.589 
a material it's our drill until you say

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:26.859 
a material it's our drill until you say
it<00:00:22.800> can<00:00:23.460> form<00:00:23.789> like<00:00:24.300> a<00:00:24.329> sculpture<00:00:24.779> so<00:00:25.529> and<00:00:26.189> then

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:26.869 
it can form like a sculpture so and then

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:30.079 
it can form like a sculpture so and then
in<00:00:27.869> this<00:00:28.439> way<00:00:28.650> history<00:00:29.310> becomes<00:00:29.759> less

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:30.089 
in this way history becomes less

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:32.510 
in this way history becomes less
catastrophic<00:00:30.929> because<00:00:31.769> you<00:00:31.919> can<00:00:31.949> you<00:00:32.250> can<00:00:32.399> do

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
catastrophic because you can you can do

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.490 
catastrophic because you can you can do
something<00:00:32.759> history<00:00:33.359> you<00:00:33.510> can<00:00:33.690> you<00:00:34.230> can

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
something history you can you can

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.220 
something history you can you can
correct<00:00:34.859> it<00:00:35.100> you<00:00:35.340> can<00:00:35.609> not<00:00:36.300> correct<00:00:36.690> you<00:00:36.989> can

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
correct it you can not correct you can

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.430 
correct it you can not correct you can
read<00:00:37.829> you<00:00:38.160> can<00:00:38.190> form<00:00:38.640> it<00:00:38.820> reformat<00:00:39.660> reform<00:00:40.260> it

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
read you can form it reformat reform it

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.849 
read you can form it reformat reform it
but<00:00:40.949> in<00:00:41.129> but<00:00:41.550> in<00:00:41.699> general<00:00:41.879> when<00:00:42.269> I<00:00:42.300> look<00:00:42.570> as

know<00:01:08.759> if<00:01:08.970> you<00:01:09.090> would<00:01:09.270> construct<00:01:09.659> like<00:01:09.900> this<00:01:10.049> in

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
know if you would construct like this in

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.830 
know if you would construct like this in
a<00:01:10.590> plane<00:01:10.860> it<00:01:11.520> will<00:01:11.700> fall<00:01:11.909> down<00:01:12.119> all<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.630> time

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
a plane it will fall down all the time

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.950 
a plane it will fall down all the time
you<00:01:13.020> know<00:01:13.170> no<00:01:13.770> it's<00:01:14.189> really<00:01:14.520> badly<00:01:14.759> done<00:01:15.150> yeah

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
you know no it's really badly done yeah

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.010 
you know no it's really badly done yeah
and<00:01:16.670> is<00:01:17.670> there<00:01:17.850> any<00:01:17.909> hope<00:01:18.119> that<00:01:18.600> it<00:01:18.689> might<00:01:18.810> ever

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
and is there any hope that it might ever

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.780 
and is there any hope that it might ever
be<00:01:19.079> rectified<00:01:19.500> or<00:01:19.799> is<00:01:19.890> your<00:01:19.950> view<00:01:20.189> of<00:01:20.250> human
