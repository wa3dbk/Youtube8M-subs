00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:24.300 
the body from pathogens that can make us

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.300 
the body from pathogens that can make us
sick<00:01:24.540> there<00:01:25.229> are<00:01:25.380> lots<00:01:25.650> of<00:01:25.800> different<00:01:26.130> types

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
sick there are lots of different types

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.070 
sick there are lots of different types
of<00:01:26.520> white<00:01:26.670> blood<00:01:26.820> cells<00:01:27.150> but<00:01:27.630> we'll<00:01:27.780> get<00:01:27.930> to

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
of white blood cells but we'll get to

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.060 
of white blood cells but we'll get to
that<00:01:28.110> later<00:01:28.850> this<00:01:29.850> is<00:01:30.270> a<00:01:30.600> red<00:01:30.930> blood<00:01:31.170> cell<00:01:31.200> its

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
that later this is a red blood cell its

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.130 
that later this is a red blood cell its
role<00:01:32.430> is<00:01:32.670> to<00:01:32.700> transport<00:01:33.240> oxygen<00:01:33.450> around<00:01:33.900> the

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
role is to transport oxygen around the

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
body to keep us alive let's see them in

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.950 
body to keep us alive let's see them in
action

yeah<00:01:39.979> we<00:01:40.979> can<00:01:41.160> see<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.850> pathogen<00:01:42.390> has<00:01:42.570> entered

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
yeah we can see the pathogen has entered

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:52.400 
yeah we can see the pathogen has entered
