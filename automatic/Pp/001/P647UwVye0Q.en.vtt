School of Architecture at University of
Queensland<00:00:10.639> now<00:00:11.639> I've<00:00:12.570> added<00:00:12.809> some<00:00:13.230> more

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
Queensland now I've added some more

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.300 
Queensland now I've added some more
elements<00:00:13.830> to<00:00:14.099> the<00:00:14.549> very<00:00:14.759> basic<00:00:15.179> model

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:16.310 
elements to the very basic model

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:19.070 
elements to the very basic model
completed<00:00:17.310> it<00:00:17.460> but<00:00:18.090> now<00:00:18.270> what<00:00:18.599> we<00:00:18.720> want<00:00:18.840> to<00:00:18.960> do

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
completed it but now what we want to do

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.410 
completed it but now what we want to do
is<00:00:19.260> just<00:00:19.410> play<00:00:19.680> around<00:00:20.099> with<00:00:20.849> some<00:00:21.090> viewing

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
is just play around with some viewing

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.189 
is just play around with some viewing
options<00:00:21.810> of<00:00:22.140> the<00:00:22.500> model<00:00:23.060> now<00:00:24.060> primarily<00:00:24.449> one

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
options of the model now primarily one

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.980 
options of the model now primarily one
of<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:25.439> more<00:00:25.679> useful<00:00:26.220> tools<00:00:26.460> with<00:00:26.670> any<00:00:26.820> 3d<00:00:27.599> CAD

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
of the more useful tools with any 3d CAD

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.589 
of the more useful tools with any 3d CAD
package<00:00:28.410> is<00:00:29.009> to<00:00:29.279> study<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:29.730> way<00:00:29.880> that<00:00:30.119> light

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
package is to study the way that light

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.080 
package is to study the way that light
and<00:00:30.630> shade<00:00:31.109> affect<00:00:32.070> our<00:00:32.220> building<00:00:32.700> so<00:00:32.850> we<00:00:32.970> can

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
and shade affect our building so we can

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.530 
and shade affect our building so we can
make<00:00:33.270> some<00:00:33.870> more<00:00:34.020> informed<00:00:34.470> design<00:00:34.770> decisions

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:35.540 
make some more informed design decisions

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:41.510 
make some more informed design decisions
now<00:00:36.540> we<00:00:36.900> can<00:00:37.140> display<00:00:38.130> shadows<00:00:39.120> in<00:00:39.860> a<00:00:40.860> Sketchup

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
now we can display shadows in a Sketchup

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.420 
now we can display shadows in a Sketchup
model<00:00:41.820> simply<00:00:42.330> by<00:00:42.600> going<00:00:42.870> to<00:00:43.160> the<00:00:44.160> view

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
model simply by going to the view

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.440 
model simply by going to the view
pulldown<00:00:44.730> menu<00:00:45.330> and<00:00:45.890> selecting<00:00:47.030> the<00:00:48.030> display

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
pulldown menu and selecting the display

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.200 
pulldown menu and selecting the display
shadows<00:00:48.870> option<00:00:49.290> and<00:00:49.590> if<00:00:50.490> we<00:00:50.550> extend<00:00:50.940> it<00:00:51.120> out

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
shadows option and if we extend it out

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.020 
shadows option and if we extend it out
there<00:00:51.480> we<00:00:52.290> can<00:00:52.440> see<00:00:52.650> that<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:53.430> Sun<00:00:53.760> is

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
there we can see that the Sun is

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.420 
there we can see that the Sun is
projecting<00:00:54.840> from<00:00:54.960> this<00:00:55.170> side<00:00:55.380> predicting<00:00:56.370> a

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
projecting from this side predicting a

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.300 
projecting from this side predicting a
shadow<00:00:56.640> onto<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:57.060> ground<00:00:57.300> here<00:00:57.510> somewhere

00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:58.310 
shadow onto the ground here somewhere

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:01.340 
shadow onto the ground here somewhere
now<00:00:59.310> that's<00:00:59.940> all<00:01:00.150> and<00:01:00.360> well<00:01:00.510> but<00:01:00.750> how<00:01:01.170> do<00:01:01.230> we

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
now that's all and well but how do we

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.920 
now that's all and well but how do we
know<00:01:01.440> whether<00:01:02.160> this<00:01:02.400> is<00:01:02.460> accurate<00:01:03.030> where<00:01:03.840> it

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
know whether this is accurate where it

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.810 
know whether this is accurate where it
is<00:01:04.049> in<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.260> world<00:01:04.500> what<00:01:05.100> time<00:01:05.339> it<00:01:05.489> is<00:01:05.519> in<00:01:05.610> the

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
is in the world what time it is in the

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:12.020 
is in the world what time it is in the
world<00:01:06.409> now<00:01:07.409> there<00:01:08.310> is<00:01:08.460> a<00:01:08.810> shadows<00:01:10.670> menu<00:01:11.670> item

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
world now there is a shadows menu item

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.569 
world now there is a shadows menu item
if<00:01:12.450> we<00:01:12.630> go<00:01:12.750> to<00:01:12.810> window<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.500> pulldown<00:01:13.920> shadows

00:01:14.569 --> 00:01:14.579 
if we go to window the pulldown shadows

00:01:14.579 --> 00:01:17.840 
if we go to window the pulldown shadows
and<00:01:15.509> we<00:01:15.840> can<00:01:16.020> then<00:01:16.140> open<00:01:16.289> up<00:01:16.649> the<00:01:16.850> shadow

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
and we can then open up the shadow

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.380 
and we can then open up the shadow
setting<00:01:18.390> now<00:01:19.259> you'll<00:01:19.409> see<00:01:19.499> here<00:01:20.009> that<00:01:20.390> the

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
setting now you'll see here that the

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.289 
setting now you'll see here that the
time<00:01:21.630> zone<00:01:21.899> is<00:01:22.079> different<00:01:22.759> to<00:01:23.759> where<00:01:23.939> we<00:01:24.090> are

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
time zone is different to where we are

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.270 
time zone is different to where we are
in<00:01:24.420> fact<00:01:24.600> I<00:01:24.719> really<00:01:25.079> have<00:01:25.200> no<00:01:25.380> clue<00:01:25.409> where<00:01:26.219> that

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
in fact I really have no clue where that

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.730 
in fact I really have no clue where that
is<00:01:26.579> but<00:01:26.789> you<00:01:27.630> can<00:01:27.780> see<00:01:27.960> here<00:01:28.200> there's<00:01:28.350> a<00:01:28.409> series

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
is but you can see here there's a series

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.980 
is but you can see here there's a series
of<00:01:28.770> sliders<00:01:29.219> that<00:01:29.579> as<00:01:29.939> we<00:01:30.149> move<00:01:30.359> them<00:01:30.780> back<00:01:30.810> and

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
of sliders that as we move them back and

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.370 
of sliders that as we move them back and
forth<00:01:31.490> for<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.520> time<00:01:32.819> of<00:01:32.969> the<00:01:33.030> day<00:01:33.240> and<00:01:33.539> the

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
forth for the time of the day and the

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.059 
forth for the time of the day and the
month<00:01:34.409> of<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:34.799> year<00:01:35.329> we<00:01:36.329> can<00:01:36.479> dynamically

00:01:37.059 --> 00:01:37.069 
month of the year we can dynamically

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:40.160 
month of the year we can dynamically
interact<00:01:38.069> with<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.060> shadows<00:01:39.450> that<00:01:39.810> our

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
interact with the shadows that our

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.580 
interact with the shadows that our
building<00:01:40.530> will<00:01:40.679> cast<00:01:41.630> now<00:01:42.630> we<00:01:42.990> can<00:01:43.229> figure<00:01:43.469> out

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
building will cast now we can figure out

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.830 
building will cast now we can figure out
where<00:01:44.310> North<00:01:44.579> is<00:01:45.649> by<00:01:46.649> simply<00:01:46.710> going<00:01:47.310> to

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
where North is by simply going to

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.889 
where North is by simply going to
toolbars<00:01:48.840> and<00:01:49.490> there<00:01:50.490> is<00:01:50.759> a<00:01:51.090> tool<00:01:51.450> down<00:01:51.659> here

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
toolbars and there is a tool down here

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.889 
toolbars and there is a tool down here
called<00:01:52.109> solar<00:01:52.380> north<00:01:53.119> and<00:01:54.119> we<00:01:54.450> can<00:01:54.600> display

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
called solar north and we can display

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.649 
called solar north and we can display
where<00:01:55.560> the<00:01:55.679> North<00:01:55.859> Point<00:01:56.130> is<00:01:56.369> so<00:01:57.359> in<00:01:57.569> this

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
where the North Point is so in this

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.440 
where the North Point is so in this
instance<00:01:57.719> North<00:01:58.499> is<00:01:58.789> pointing<00:01:59.789> directly<00:02:00.030> up

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
instance North is pointing directly up

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.749 
instance North is pointing directly up
the<00:02:01.049> page<00:02:01.289> in<00:02:01.499> that<00:02:01.619> direction<00:02:02.270> so<00:02:03.270> we<00:02:04.759> the

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
the page in that direction so we the

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.309 
the page in that direction so we the
intention<00:02:06.240> here<00:02:06.509> is<00:02:06.539> that<00:02:06.689> the<00:02:06.780> veranda<00:02:07.170> would

00:02:07.309 --> 00:02:07.319 
intention here is that the veranda would

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:09.680 
intention here is that the veranda would
be<00:02:07.439> facing<00:02:07.679> north<00:02:08.039> so<00:02:08.310> in<00:02:08.399> fact<00:02:08.610> a<00:02:08.880> building<00:02:09.569> is

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
be facing north so in fact a building is

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.490 
be facing north so in fact a building is
facing<00:02:10.440> the<00:02:10.530> wrong<00:02:10.680> way<00:02:11.720> now<00:02:12.720> in<00:02:13.020> the<00:02:13.170> sketchup

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
facing the wrong way now in the sketchup

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.340 
facing the wrong way now in the sketchup
pro<00:02:13.530> version<00:02:14.130> we<00:02:14.310> can<00:02:14.520> actually<00:02:14.940> adjust

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
pro version we can actually adjust

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.340 
pro version we can actually adjust
the<00:02:16.440> North<00:02:16.650> points<00:02:17.130> in<00:02:17.820> the<00:02:18.000> model<00:02:18.270> itself<00:02:18.390> but

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
the North points in the model itself but

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.860 
the North points in the model itself but
with<00:02:19.500> the<00:02:19.620> free<00:02:19.830> version<00:02:20.420> we're<00:02:21.420> fixed<00:02:21.720> with

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
with the free version we're fixed with

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.340 
with the free version we're fixed with
just<00:02:22.080> identifying<00:02:22.800> where<00:02:23.130> it<00:02:23.220> is<00:02:23.400> so<00:02:24.360> to

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
just identifying where it is so to

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.160 
just identifying where it is so to
remedy<00:02:25.920> the<00:02:26.430> orientation<00:02:27.210> aspect<00:02:27.630> we're

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
remedy the orientation aspect we're

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.500 
remedy the orientation aspect we're
going<00:02:28.350> to<00:02:28.470> have<00:02:28.650> to<00:02:28.800> move<00:02:28.980> the<00:02:29.010> whole<00:02:29.340> model<00:02:29.760> so

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
going to have to move the whole model so

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.450 
going to have to move the whole model so
what<00:02:30.660> I'm<00:02:30.750> going<00:02:30.900> to<00:02:30.990> do<00:02:31.200> is<00:02:31.350> I'll<00:02:31.530> just<00:02:32.040> select

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
what I'm going to do is I'll just select

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:36.110 
what I'm going to do is I'll just select
pretty<00:02:33.060> much<00:02:33.210> everything<00:02:34.580> get<00:02:35.580> my<00:02:35.700> rotate

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
pretty much everything get my rotate

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:41.270 
pretty much everything get my rotate
tool<00:02:37.490> I'll<00:02:38.490> do<00:02:38.640> it<00:02:38.760> around<00:02:38.970> the<00:02:39.120> origin<00:02:40.280> just

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
tool I'll do it around the origin just

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:47.210 
tool I'll do it around the origin just
select<00:02:42.200> 180<00:02:43.200> degrees<00:02:44.240> enter<00:02:45.650> and<00:02:46.650> I'll<00:02:46.980> move

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
select 180 degrees enter and I'll move

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:55.340 
select 180 degrees enter and I'll move
it<00:02:50.930> approximately<00:02:51.930> into<00:02:52.170> position<00:02:54.110> well<00:02:55.110> then

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
it approximately into position well then

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.350 
it approximately into position well then
do<00:02:56.040> you<00:02:56.130> select<00:02:56.280> everything<00:02:56.670> look<00:02:57.150> how<00:02:57.300> I'm

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
do you select everything look how I'm

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.040 
do you select everything look how I'm
going<00:02:57.890> now<00:02:58.890> this<00:02:59.820> still<00:03:00.150> isn't<00:03:00.330> right<00:03:00.600> because

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
going now this still isn't right because

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:04.040 
going now this still isn't right because
although<00:03:01.950> my<00:03:02.220> model<00:03:02.520> is<00:03:02.610> facing<00:03:03.060> north<00:03:03.330> the

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
although my model is facing north the

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:05.770 
although my model is facing north the
Sun<00:03:04.290> is<00:03:04.380> actually<00:03:04.710> coming<00:03:05.010> from<00:03:05.280> the<00:03:05.460> south

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
Sun is actually coming from the south

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.280 
Sun is actually coming from the south
which<00:03:06.780> indicates<00:03:07.440> to<00:03:07.590> me<00:03:07.620> that<00:03:08.010> we've<00:03:08.610> got<00:03:08.880> a

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
which indicates to me that we've got a

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.800 
which indicates to me that we've got a
geo<00:03:10.290> location<00:03:11.250> somewhere<00:03:12.240> in<00:03:12.390> the<00:03:12.480> northern

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
the new version of sketchup is that we

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:21.590 
the new version of sketchup is that we
can<00:03:18.570> g<00:03:18.810> ok<00:03:19.110> geo<00:03:19.830> locate<00:03:20.430> the<00:03:20.580> model<00:03:20.880> through

can g ok geo locate the model through

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.640 
can g ok geo locate the model through

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
the use of google maps so to do that if

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.610 
the use of google maps so to do that if
we<00:03:25.890> go<00:03:26.070> to<00:03:26.550> the<00:03:26.640> pulldown<00:03:26.970> menu<00:03:27.480> window<00:03:27.810> we've

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
we go to the pulldown menu window we've

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.760 
we go to the pulldown menu window we've
got<00:03:28.770> a<00:03:28.800> model<00:03:28.950> info<00:03:30.320> now<00:03:31.320> the<00:03:31.440> geolocation

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:31.770 
got a model info now the geolocation

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:33.890 
got a model info now the geolocation
this<00:03:32.490> is<00:03:32.610> different<00:03:32.790> to<00:03:33.120> the<00:03:33.510> previous

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
this is different to the previous

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.390 
this is different to the previous
version<00:03:34.080> of<00:03:34.350> sketchup<00:03:34.530> for<00:03:34.860> those<00:03:35.010> familiar

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
version of sketchup for those familiar

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.570 
version of sketchup for those familiar
with<00:03:35.820> that<00:03:35.850> here<00:03:36.810> we<00:03:36.930> actually<00:03:37.230> go<00:03:37.410> through<00:03:37.580> an

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 
with that here we actually go through an

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:42.440 
with that here we actually go through an
interface<00:03:39.420> that<00:03:39.690> is<00:03:40.620> like<00:03:41.190> a<00:03:41.220> google<00:03:41.910> map<00:03:42.060> so

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
interface that is like a google map so

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.040 
interface that is like a google map so
we're<00:03:42.570> going<00:03:42.660> to<00:03:42.810> add<00:03:42.960> a<00:03:43.350> location<00:03:44.870> now<00:03:45.870> what

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:46.050 
we're going to add a location now what

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:49.850 
we're going to add a location now what
it<00:03:46.140> should<00:03:46.320> pull<00:03:46.590> up<00:03:48.110> in<00:03:49.110> fact<00:03:49.380> you<00:03:49.500> can<00:03:49.650> see

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 
it should pull up in fact you can see

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.910 
it should pull up in fact you can see
here<00:03:50.220> it's<00:03:50.900> remembered<00:03:51.900> where<00:03:52.110> I<00:03:52.380> looked<00:03:52.770> at

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
here it's remembered where I looked at

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.460 
here it's remembered where I looked at
last<00:03:53.100> time<00:03:53.480> so<00:03:54.480> it's<00:03:54.810> brought<00:03:54.960> up<00:03:55.080> at<00:03:55.200> Google

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
last time so it's brought up at Google

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:57.320 
last time so it's brought up at Google
Maps<00:03:55.620> and<00:03:55.800> really<00:03:56.070> what<00:03:56.220> we<00:03:56.340> can<00:03:56.490> do<00:03:56.640> is<00:03:56.970> zoom

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:57.330 
Maps and really what we can do is zoom

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:59.960 
Maps and really what we can do is zoom
in<00:03:57.510> on<00:03:57.720> the<00:03:58.020> location<00:03:58.520> where<00:03:59.520> we<00:03:59.700> want<00:03:59.910> to

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
in on the location where we want to

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.440 
in on the location where we want to
place<00:04:00.680> our<00:04:01.680> building<00:04:02.100> now<00:04:02.670> I'm<00:04:02.790> going<00:04:03.000> to<00:04:03.210> put

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
place our building now I'm going to put

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.520 
place our building now I'm going to put
my<00:04:03.660> building<00:04:04.200> somewhere<00:04:04.440> in<00:04:04.710> west<00:04:05.640> end<00:04:05.940> in

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 
my building somewhere in west end in

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:10.190 
my building somewhere in west end in
someone's<00:04:07.530> backyard<00:04:08.330> where's<00:04:09.330> a<00:04:09.420> likely

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
candidate is one up here this block here

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:18.979 
candidate is one up here this block here
block<00:04:14.490> 59<00:04:15.000> it<00:04:15.210> looks<00:04:15.360> empty<00:04:17.299> so<00:04:18.299> I'm<00:04:18.630> going<00:04:18.900> to

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
block 59 it looks empty so I'm going to

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:23.360 
block 59 it looks empty so I'm going to
position<00:04:19.710> myself<00:04:20.540> select<00:04:21.540> a<00:04:21.630> region<00:04:22.250> so<00:04:23.250> I'm

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
position myself select a region so I'm

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:24.330 
position myself select a region so I'm
going<00:04:23.400> to

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
going to

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:29.340 
going to
just<00:04:25.270> use<00:04:26.230> that<00:04:26.260> back<00:04:26.710> a<00:04:26.740> bit<00:04:27.870> so<00:04:28.870> that's<00:04:28.990> the

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:29.350 
just use that back a bit so that's the

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:32.520 
just use that back a bit so that's the
region<00:04:30.130> that<00:04:30.250> I<00:04:30.310> want<00:04:30.520> to<00:04:30.639> use<00:04:31.169> going<00:04:32.169> to<00:04:32.290> grab

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:32.530 
region that I want to use going to grab

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:39.870 
region that I want to use going to grab
that<00:04:33.240> and<00:04:35.400> then<00:04:36.400> it's<00:04:36.550> going<00:04:36.760> to<00:04:37.080> position<00:04:38.880> my

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:39.880 
that and then it's going to position my

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:45.300 
that and then it's going to position my
model<00:04:41.070> with<00:04:42.070> that<00:04:42.280> grab<00:04:42.639> underneath<00:04:43.060> it<00:04:44.310> now

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:45.310 
model with that grab underneath it now

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:46.980 
model with that grab underneath it now
the<00:04:45.880> brilliant<00:04:46.240> thing<00:04:46.270> is<00:04:46.510> is<00:04:46.630> that<00:04:46.780> it's

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:46.990 
the brilliant thing is is that it's

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:49.379 
the brilliant thing is is that it's
recognized<00:04:47.620> where<00:04:48.580> we<00:04:48.729> are<00:04:48.910> in<00:04:49.090> the<00:04:49.180> world

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:49.389 
recognized where we are in the world

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:52.950 
recognized where we are in the world
quite<00:04:50.199> accurately<00:04:50.710> and<00:04:51.070> so<00:04:51.940> now<00:04:52.240> when<00:04:52.810> we

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:52.960 
quite accurately and so now when we

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.850 
quite accurately and so now when we
start<00:04:53.199> to<00:04:53.410> scroll<00:04:53.710> the<00:04:54.669> shadow<00:04:55.560> from<00:04:56.560> sort<00:04:56.830> of

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:56.860 
start to scroll the shadow from sort of

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.490 
start to scroll the shadow from sort of
north-south<00:04:57.430> the<00:04:58.150> Sun<00:04:58.450> we<00:04:58.840> can<00:04:58.870> see<00:04:59.260> is

00:04:59.490 --> 00:04:59.500 
north-south the Sun we can see is

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.860 
north-south the Sun we can see is
actually<00:05:00.040> coming<00:05:00.490> from<00:05:01.210> the<00:05:01.360> north<00:05:01.570> and

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:01.870 
actually coming from the north and

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:06.570 
actually coming from the north and
projecting<00:05:02.410> the<00:05:02.620> shadows<00:05:02.979> back<00:05:04.139> now<00:05:05.310> we<00:05:06.310> can

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:06.580 
projecting the shadows back now we can

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:09.510 
projecting the shadows back now we can
you<00:05:07.270> can<00:05:07.450> see<00:05:07.690> here<00:05:08.050> in<00:05:08.169> that<00:05:08.620> doing<00:05:09.130> the<00:05:09.250> grab

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:09.520 
you can see here in that doing the grab

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:15.570 
you can see here in that doing the grab
it's<00:05:10.440> added<00:05:11.440> in<00:05:11.590> a<00:05:11.800> couple<00:05:12.190> of<00:05:12.510> extra<00:05:14.580> elements

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:15.580 
it's added in a couple of extra elements

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:19.200 
it's added in a couple of extra elements
through<00:05:15.880> here<00:05:16.620> now<00:05:17.669> the<00:05:18.669> other<00:05:18.789> thing<00:05:18.910> with

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:19.210 
through here now the other thing with

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:24.090 
through here now the other thing with
google<00:05:22.169> google<00:05:23.169> maps<00:05:23.380> is<00:05:23.590> that<00:05:23.710> there's<00:05:23.889> a<00:05:23.949> lot

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:24.100 
google google maps is that there's a lot

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:26.730 
google google maps is that there's a lot
of<00:05:24.130> terrain<00:05:24.520> information<00:05:25.240> currently<00:05:26.229> if<00:05:26.500> we

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:26.740 
of terrain information currently if we

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:31.200 
of terrain information currently if we
look<00:05:26.889> at<00:05:27.010> this<00:05:27.220> in<00:05:28.650> our<00:05:29.650> end<00:05:30.010> elevation<00:05:30.729> we<00:05:31.030> can

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:31.210 
look at this in our end elevation we can

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:35.550 
look at this in our end elevation we can
see<00:05:31.450> that<00:05:32.440> the<00:05:32.560> world<00:05:32.800> is<00:05:32.979> flat<00:05:34.289> now<00:05:35.289> what<00:05:35.470> we

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:35.560 
see that the world is flat now what we

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:42.659 
see that the world is flat now what we
can<00:05:35.800> do<00:05:36.990> though<00:05:37.990> is<00:05:38.400> turn<00:05:39.400> on<00:05:39.630> the<00:05:40.630> terrain<00:05:41.669> so

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:42.669 
can do though is turn on the terrain so

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:44.670 
can do though is turn on the terrain so
we<00:05:42.820> can<00:05:42.970> toggle<00:05:43.180> the<00:05:43.360> terrain<00:05:43.690> on<00:05:43.870> and<00:05:44.050> now

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:44.680 
we can toggle the terrain on and now

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:45.870 
we can toggle the terrain on and now
what<00:05:44.860> it's<00:05:44.979> doing<00:05:45.070> is<00:05:45.400> that<00:05:45.550> it's<00:05:45.700> actually

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:45.880 
what it's doing is that it's actually

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:49.950 
what it's doing is that it's actually
pulling<00:05:46.300> up<00:05:46.979> the<00:05:47.979> terrain<00:05:48.720> coming<00:05:49.720> straight

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:49.960 
pulling up the terrain coming straight

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:53.100 
pulling up the terrain coming straight
out<00:05:50.020> of<00:05:50.320> google<00:05:51.280> maps<00:05:51.479> so<00:05:52.479> if<00:05:52.660> i<00:05:52.750> look<00:05:52.780> at<00:05:52.990> it

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:53.110 
out of google maps so if i look at it

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:56.219 
out of google maps so if i look at it
now<00:05:53.289> straight<00:05:53.830> on<00:05:53.979> we<00:05:54.340> can<00:05:54.550> see<00:05:55.169> that<00:05:56.169> the

00:05:56.219 --> 00:05:56.229 
now straight on we can see that the

00:05:56.229 --> 00:06:00.060 
now straight on we can see that the
terrain<00:05:56.650> is<00:05:56.800> actually<00:05:57.190> warped<00:05:58.320> now<00:05:59.320> we<00:05:59.950> can

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:00.070 
terrain is actually warped now we can

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:03.089 
terrain is actually warped now we can
adjust<00:06:00.370> the<00:06:00.550> height<00:06:00.729> of<00:06:01.030> our<00:06:01.900> building<00:06:02.349> so

00:06:03.089 --> 00:06:03.099 
adjust the height of our building so

00:06:03.099 --> 00:06:05.040 
adjust the height of our building so
that<00:06:03.280> it's<00:06:03.430> it's<00:06:03.639> either<00:06:04.360> in<00:06:04.599> the<00:06:04.720> train

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:05.050 
that it's it's either in the train

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:07.800 
that it's it's either in the train
properly<00:06:05.349> if<00:06:05.740> it's<00:06:06.610> floating<00:06:07.000> above<00:06:07.240> like

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:07.810 
properly if it's floating above like

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:10.469 
properly if it's floating above like
that<00:06:07.990> column<00:06:08.380> is<00:06:08.530> there<00:06:08.849> then<00:06:09.849> what<00:06:10.000> we<00:06:10.120> can<00:06:10.150> do

00:06:10.469 --> 00:06:10.479 
that column is there then what we can do

00:06:10.479 --> 00:06:12.360 
that column is there then what we can do
is<00:06:10.810> that<00:06:11.169> we<00:06:11.260> can<00:06:11.380> just<00:06:11.410> turn<00:06:11.710> that<00:06:11.770> terrain

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:12.370 
is that we can just turn that terrain

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:16.469 
is that we can just turn that terrain
off<00:06:13.410> select<00:06:14.410> everything<00:06:15.000> turn<00:06:16.000> the<00:06:16.150> terrain

00:06:16.469 --> 00:06:16.479 
off select everything turn the terrain

00:06:16.479 --> 00:06:26.540 
off select everything turn the terrain
on<00:06:16.690> and<00:06:17.190> then<00:06:18.190> just<00:06:18.400> move<00:06:18.580> it<00:06:18.760> down<00:06:20.370> maybe<00:06:21.690> 300

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:26.550 

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:31.860 

and<00:06:27.550> let's<00:06:27.730> have<00:06:27.880> a<00:06:27.970> look<00:06:28.980> in<00:06:29.980> fact<00:06:30.870> we're

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:31.870 
and let's have a look in fact we're

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:39.260 
and let's have a look in fact we're
still<00:06:32.170> not<00:06:32.350> quite<00:06:32.590> there<00:06:34.830> select<00:06:35.830> everything

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:39.270 

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:47.790 

pull<00:06:40.270> it<00:06:40.390> down<00:06:41.280> 400<00:06:42.660> enter<00:06:45.780> so<00:06:46.780> now<00:06:47.080> all<00:06:47.350> of<00:06:47.680> our

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:47.800 
pull it down 400 enter so now all of our

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:50.670 
pull it down 400 enter so now all of our
stumps<00:06:48.480> are<00:06:49.480> firmly<00:06:49.780> bet<00:06:50.110> it<00:06:50.230> in<00:06:50.320> the<00:06:50.440> ground

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:50.680 
stumps are firmly bet it in the ground

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:54.330 
stumps are firmly bet it in the ground
now<00:06:51.460> the<00:06:51.520> building<00:06:51.850> thing<00:06:52.030> is<00:06:52.180> is<00:06:52.360> that<00:06:53.340> the

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:54.340 
now the building thing is is that the

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:59.640 
now the building thing is is that the
terrain<00:06:54.760> now<00:06:55.090> that<00:06:55.390> we<00:06:55.510> have<00:06:56.430> distorts<00:06:58.650> or

00:06:59.640 --> 00:06:59.650 
terrain now that we have distorts or

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:02.760 
terrain now that we have distorts or
accurately<00:07:00.220> because<00:07:01.180> we<00:07:02.110> know<00:07:02.290> that<00:07:02.320> the

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:02.770 
accurately because we know that the

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:06.930 
accurately because we know that the
projection<00:07:03.340> on<00:07:03.990> the<00:07:04.990> ground<00:07:05.290> if<00:07:05.800> it's<00:07:06.700> sloping

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:06.940 
projection on the ground if it's sloping

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:08.790 
projection on the ground if it's sloping
away<00:07:07.180> we'll<00:07:07.570> get<00:07:07.690> a<00:07:07.720> longer<00:07:07.960> shadow<00:07:08.320> if<00:07:08.590> it's

00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:08.800 
away we'll get a longer shadow if it's

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:11.850 
away we'll get a longer shadow if it's
sloping<00:07:09.040> up<00:07:09.340> we'll<00:07:10.030> get<00:07:10.150> a<00:07:10.180> shorter<00:07:10.570> shadow<00:07:10.860> so

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:11.860 
sloping up we'll get a shorter shadow so

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:15.540 
sloping up we'll get a shorter shadow so
it's<00:07:12.850> a<00:07:12.940> brilliant<00:07:13.150> way<00:07:13.960> of<00:07:14.550> contextualizing

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:15.550 
it's a brilliant way of contextualizing

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:18.720 
it's a brilliant way of contextualizing
our<00:07:15.820> project<00:07:16.300> getting<00:07:17.050> quite<00:07:17.290> accurate<00:07:17.920> solar

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:18.730 
our project getting quite accurate solar

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:22.050 
our project getting quite accurate solar
studies<00:07:19.210> and<00:07:19.830> we<00:07:20.830> can<00:07:21.010> then<00:07:21.160> choose<00:07:21.820> specific

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:22.060 
studies and we can then choose specific

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:25.050 
studies and we can then choose specific
times<00:07:22.690> that<00:07:22.990> day<00:07:23.200> and<00:07:23.470> save<00:07:24.160> images<00:07:24.580> off<00:07:24.790> and

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:25.060 
times that day and save images off and

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:28.410 
times that day and save images off and
create<00:07:25.720> ourselves<00:07:26.670> very<00:07:27.670> simple<00:07:28.300> but

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:28.420 
create ourselves very simple but

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:32.130 
create ourselves very simple but
effective<00:07:28.740> solar<00:07:29.740> study
