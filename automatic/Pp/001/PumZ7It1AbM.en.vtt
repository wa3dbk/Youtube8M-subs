alright so the good wood board test the

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:04.760 
alright so the good wood board test the
format's<00:00:03.629> changed<00:00:04.140> a<00:00:04.259> little<00:00:04.410> bit<00:00:04.560> this<00:00:04.710> year

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:04.770 
format's changed a little bit this year

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.970 
format's changed a little bit this year
they<00:00:05.460> have<00:00:05.640> like<00:00:05.970> no<00:00:06.870> longer<00:00:07.140> the<00:00:07.259> blanks<00:00:07.649> and

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
they have like no longer the blanks and

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.400 
they have like no longer the blanks and
they<00:00:08.099> have<00:00:08.250> the<00:00:08.550> vendors<00:00:09.330> coming<00:00:09.570> in<00:00:09.809> with

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
they have the vendors coming in with

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:11.810 
they have the vendors coming in with
like<00:00:10.559> complete<00:00:10.889> size<00:00:11.099> runs<00:00:11.370> of<00:00:11.490> the<00:00:11.550> boards

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
like complete size runs of the boards

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.910 
like complete size runs of the boards
why<00:00:12.690> has<00:00:12.840> that<00:00:12.870> changed<00:00:12.990> from<00:00:13.410> last<00:00:13.620> year

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
why has that changed from last year

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.200 
why has that changed from last year
what's<00:00:14.429> the<00:00:14.519> reasoning<00:00:14.790> like<00:00:14.940> that<00:00:15.089> but

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
what's the reasoning like that but

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.060 
what's the reasoning like that but
basically<00:00:15.299> why<00:00:15.719> we<00:00:15.839> went<00:00:16.020> to<00:00:16.109> full<00:00:16.590> graphics

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
basically why we went to full graphics

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.910 
basically why we went to full graphics
and<00:00:17.430> the<00:00:17.460> full<00:00:17.970> line<00:00:18.180> and<00:00:18.600> having<00:00:19.350> the<00:00:19.470> actual

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
and the full line and having the actual

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.340 
and the full line and having the actual
manufacturers<00:00:20.550> here<00:00:20.760> is<00:00:21.000> because<00:00:21.350> the

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
manufacturers here is because the

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:23.540 
manufacturers here is because the
previous<00:00:22.650> year<00:00:22.800> is<00:00:22.920> we're<00:00:23.039> going<00:00:23.130> to<00:00:23.189> have<00:00:23.340> one

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
previous year is we're going to have one

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.179 
previous year is we're going to have one
but<00:00:23.820> the<00:00:24.330> model<00:00:24.600> is<00:00:24.720> AG<00:00:24.840> one<00:00:25.019> size<00:00:25.260> so<00:00:25.949> if<00:00:26.070> the

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
but the model is AG one size so if the

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:27.950 
but the model is AG one size so if the
riders<00:00:26.519> is<00:00:26.939> not<00:00:27.240> the<00:00:27.359> right<00:00:27.449> size<00:00:27.689> for<00:00:27.750> that

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
riders is not the right size for that

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.330 
riders is not the right size for that
board<00:00:28.320> like<00:00:28.500> you<00:00:28.830> know<00:00:28.920> if<00:00:29.039> they<00:00:29.130> need<00:00:29.220> to

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
board like you know if they need to

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.209 
board like you know if they need to
write<00:00:29.490> a<00:00:29.750> 56<00:00:30.750> but<00:00:30.990> there's<00:00:31.140> only<00:00:31.320> a<00:00:31.560> 61<00:00:32.070> it

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
write a 56 but there's only a 61 it

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.130 
write a 56 but there's only a 61 it
doesn't<00:00:32.430> really<00:00:32.520> work<00:00:33.090> out<00:00:33.239> so<00:00:33.300> not<00:00:33.989> really

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
doesn't really work out so not really

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.470 
doesn't really work out so not really
getting<00:00:34.350> a<00:00:34.469> fair<00:00:34.620> judgment<00:00:35.100> on<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.250> board<00:00:35.480> so

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
getting a fair judgment on the board so

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.479 
getting a fair judgment on the board so
this<00:00:37.020> year<00:00:37.260> just<00:00:37.950> to<00:00:38.010> make<00:00:38.100> it<00:00:38.129> easy<00:00:38.309> on<00:00:38.399> the

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
this year just to make it easy on the

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:39.950 
this year just to make it easy on the
companies<00:00:38.910> they<00:00:39.329> already<00:00:39.450> have<00:00:39.629> their<00:00:39.660> lines

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
companies they already have their lines

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.560 
companies they already have their lines
ready<00:00:40.260> do<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.340> full<00:00:41.550> graphics<00:00:42.030> but<00:00:42.300> you<00:00:42.420> also

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570
