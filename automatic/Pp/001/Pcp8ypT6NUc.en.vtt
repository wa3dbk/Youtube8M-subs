00:00:00.069 --> 00:00:05.390
 for again for increasingly diminished middle class that already from this 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:07.430
 papa will travel to aa 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:08.569
 the bad 

00:00:08.569 --> 00:00:10.389
 the fair asks 

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:12.840
 more imagination is going to take out the finances of this country 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.909
 of general gentleman 

00:00:14.909 --> 00:00:18.839
 the pancha paz public policies of those who have governed us 

00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:23.939
 both blue and tricolors the one you want and I purposely come to the 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.810
 head this I put them to sync 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:28.919
 that comes from a specialist 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:32.159
 who can not even be expected to be from the opposition 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.420
 because he has ill will to the president 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.160
 nor politics has a single goal 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.040
 create well-paid jobs so you and your family can live better 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.840
 and for that I'm going to be four things 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:55.210
 I'm going to reduce taxes for those who work to produce jobs and 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.170
 I will simplify your payment 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:58.580
 second 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:02.080
 I'm trying to appear totally 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:03.920
 the taxes we pay 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.950
 third I will invest your money better 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.700
 and fourth I will guarantee economic stability to take care of your heritage 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:12.850
 so first 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.910
 I'm going to lower the income tax rate 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:20.670
 because the Mexicans that produce that invests in that they work that generate 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:21.790
 other jobs 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.950
 You must not pay more taxes than those paid in other parts of the world 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.380
 that will allow us to have more investment and more employment that is what I am looking for and 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.500
 paying taxes was easier than ever 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.050
 make a statement you can do it simply and without the help of anyone 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:37.620
 second 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:42.450
 I'm going to handle the money from the town in a glass box. There's not going to be 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.870
 hidden fidecomisos or mysterious boxes you to you to know where you are going to whom 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:51.340
 spend it how you spend up to the last dime you pay taxes 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.050
 I will invest better what we have 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.110
 I'm going to invest money, what I really left will not lose my mind 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.040
 you need 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.940
 I will invest in quality schools and universities for your children 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.040
 I'm going to invest in health 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.479
 not only to continue with the popular insurance if I do not go for health insurance 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:13.170
 for all because my goal is that no Mexican this without doctors and 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.210
 medicines and without treatment and I'll start with all the children that are born 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:20.569
 when I am president of the republic 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:24.299
 I will also use the money precisely in the communities 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:28.229
 indigenous people on the roads that are needed in drinking water 

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:31.859
 I'm going to invest the money in the security we need to get back out to 

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:34.459
 the streets with tranquility 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:38.150
 and fourth point he said I will support when stepping economic stability for 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.849
 what 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:40.899
 to take care of your heritage 

00:02:40.899 --> 00:02:44.099
 I am going to launch economic stability so that the rates of 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:47.389
 interest and you can acquire a house 

00:02:47.389 --> 00:02:52.019
 so you can renovate your kitchen so you can truly have a car 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:55.099
 I'm going to lower interest rates so there's more investment in Mexico and 

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:58.439
 there is more employment in synthesis my fiscal policy will be 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:03.299
 lower taxes for those who produce so that there is more investment more 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:06.689
 employment and so that we can live better 

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:07.579
 it 

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:09.799
 what the gentleman said
