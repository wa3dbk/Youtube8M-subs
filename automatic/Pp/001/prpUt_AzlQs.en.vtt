00:00:00.809 --> 00:00:07.149
 and the flowers and the real ones are all arranged to create a 

00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:09.869
 ambient 

00:00:09.869 --> 00:00:13.519
 let's make a juicy cod omelette we're going to need goats 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:16.419
 Onion parsley is just finished or oil and salt 

00:00:16.419 --> 00:00:21.189
 we chop the onion and the green pepper the davis security we use until the 

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:22.769
 with which we are 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.249
 to despise anything for turkey we will serve the tails of the onion 

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:31.529
 I prefer the onion the forest the fresh onion too 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.529
 we can do it with dry onion 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.010
 let's suffer the onions that chopped up along with the pepper that 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.010
 we are also what we have previously stung 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:46.280
 in a pot part 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.240
 poch we will make the cod in hot waters but in this event with the foa 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.960
 paid out 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.600
 we will not do it with the sofrito with its face but rather badly in the end we will mix 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.799
 the cod you hear is the two minutes together 

00:00:58.799 --> 00:01:01.799
 with the onion that together with the pepper well mixed 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.920
 we separate more egg whites 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.790
 and we beat the egg whites so the tortilla will be much more spongy because 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.790
 we get people a lot more if they do not 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.720
 and once we have beaten the lara 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.610
 we have a little bit of saints 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:23.080
 i add the yolk the game and others we mix everything well 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.690
 after this operation we can only add 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:31.170
 the mixture of sofrito and cod 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.320
 we mix everything again and add a little parsley 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.350
 it's going to be very tasty 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.080
 and with all that mixture we will have everything ready 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.190
 for the pan to start making the tortilla 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:49.280
 we will put oil that is logically hot that the northeast if the mind 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.900
 hot tasted we want it to go curd little bit that wrong 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:58.660
 for something inside the printer demoscopia seen with patience with 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.660
 honey, that was excessive and good 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.250
 let's go working the tortilla transform it 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.349
 the cod omelet is usually made 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:11.449
 delegate 

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:14.449
 we could do it as we please yoquese for honda 

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:16.919
 triangular 

00:02:16.919 --> 00:02:18.559
 of any type 

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:20.929
 octagonal customers 

00:02:20.929 --> 00:02:23.929
 the important thing is to make it well that juicy 

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:27.809
 that's why we do it with pleasure little in the face of the return 

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:34.069
 take the pan if the albos art the former villa gesell is very nice that's 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:36.549
 so we turn it around 

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:40.059
 and this is ready we form a little bit of parsley 

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:43.319
 to decorate and that of that left bold expensive juicy 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:47.399
