00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:58.070 
just did that because if you get on the

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:59.710 
just did that because if you get on the
skin<00:02:58.310> and<00:02:58.460> you<00:02:58.520> cure<00:02:58.730> it<00:02:58.790> it<00:02:59.150> goes<00:02:59.300> into<00:02:59.480> like<00:02:59.600> a

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
skin and you cure it it goes into like a

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.820 
skin and you cure it it goes into like a
hot<00:02:59.960> gel<00:03:00.290> and<00:03:01.510> once<00:03:02.510> it's<00:03:02.750> hard<00:03:03.050> you<00:03:03.530> can<00:03:03.680> just

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830
