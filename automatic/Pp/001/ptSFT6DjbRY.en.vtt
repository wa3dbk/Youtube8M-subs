00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:02.159 
vector it was you know I think it wasn't

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:04.070 
vector it was you know I think it wasn't
no<00:00:02.399> its<00:00:02.580> bladder<00:00:02.879> it<00:00:03.149> splatters<00:00:03.629> the<00:00:03.780> inks

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.080 
no its bladder it splatters the inks

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:05.809 
no its bladder it splatters the inks
different<00:00:04.500> if<00:00:04.770> you<00:00:04.920> throw<00:00:05.100> in<00:00:05.160> ink<00:00:05.430> and<00:00:05.580> it<00:00:05.700> hit

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819 
different if you throw in ink and it hit

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:08.330 
different if you throw in ink and it hit
somewhere<00:00:06.299> like<00:00:06.600> at<00:00:07.290> an<00:00:07.440> angle<00:00:07.830> like<00:00:08.010> if<00:00:08.280> you

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
somewhere like at an angle like if you

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.580 
somewhere like at an angle like if you
throw<00:00:08.490> from<00:00:08.670> low<00:00:08.880> the<00:00:09.330> throat<00:00:09.510> hi<00:00:09.719> where<00:00:10.380> it

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
throw from low the throat hi where it

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.589 
throw from low the throat hi where it
lands<00:00:10.950> it'll<00:00:11.130> splatter<00:00:11.519> effect<00:00:11.730> so<00:00:12.420> that's

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
lands it'll splatter effect so that's

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.570 
lands it'll splatter effect so that's
why<00:00:12.750> if<00:00:12.870> you<00:00:13.019> throw<00:00:13.380> it<00:00:13.530> like<00:00:13.679> on<00:00:13.889> gridlock

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
why if you throw it like on gridlock

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.340 
why if you throw it like on gridlock
near<00:00:14.849> the<00:00:14.969> top<00:00:15.150> of<00:00:15.179> the<00:00:15.450> steps<00:00:15.719> we're<00:00:16.139> snipe

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
near the top of the steps we're snipe

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.529 
near the top of the steps we're snipe
said<00:00:16.590> it'll<00:00:17.100> splatter<00:00:17.640> all<00:00:17.940> the<00:00:18.090> way<00:00:18.180> down<00:00:18.390> the

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
said it'll splatter all the way down the

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.510 
said it'll splatter all the way down the
steps<00:00:18.840> so<00:00:19.470> you<00:00:19.529> can<00:00:19.740> potentially<00:00:20.189> have<00:00:20.369> the

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
steps so you can potentially have the

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.220 
steps so you can potentially have the
whole<00:00:20.699> steps<00:00:21.090> there's<00:00:21.449> that<00:00:21.630> covered<00:00:21.960> with<00:00:22.109> an

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
whole steps there's that covered with an

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.679 
whole steps there's that covered with an
ink<00:00:22.640> that's<00:00:23.640> how<00:00:23.880> it<00:00:23.939> work<00:00:24.119> yeah<00:00:24.330> I<00:00:24.600> I<00:00:25.880> had<00:00:26.880> we
