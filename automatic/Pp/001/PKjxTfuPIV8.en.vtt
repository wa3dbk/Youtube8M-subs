00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
is incredibly helpful see like if says

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.199 
is incredibly helpful see like if says
if<00:02:43.230> you're<00:02:43.350> dry<00:02:43.770> oily<00:02:44.190> combination<00:02:44.670> are

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
if you're dry oily combination are

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:46.580 
if you're dry oily combination are
normal<00:02:45.600> and<00:02:45.630> then<00:02:45.810> it<00:02:45.930> tells<00:02:46.080> you<00:02:46.290> what<00:02:46.560> kind

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
normal and then it tells you what kind

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.070 
normal and then it tells you what kind
of<00:02:46.980> foundation<00:02:47.670> or<00:02:47.850> skincare<00:02:48.330> products<00:02:48.989> you

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
of foundation or skincare products you

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.780 
of foundation or skincare products you
should<00:02:49.290> look<00:02:49.470> for<00:02:49.530> based<00:02:50.100> on<00:02:50.310> that<00:02:50.459> skin<00:02:50.760> tone

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
should look for based on that skin tone

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.900 
should look for based on that skin tone
and<00:02:51.390> based<00:02:52.350> on<00:02:52.530> your<00:02:52.620> skin<00:02:53.160> type<00:02:53.430> so<00:02:53.700> I<00:02:53.730> thought

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
and based on your skin type so I thought

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.850 
and based on your skin type so I thought
that<00:02:53.970> was<00:02:54.180> incredibly<00:02:54.840> useful<00:02:55.110> and<00:02:55.560> very

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
that was incredibly useful and very

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.520 
that was incredibly useful and very
great<00:02:56.280> to<00:02:56.519> mention<00:02:56.970> first<00:02:57.360> rather<00:02:58.019> than<00:02:58.200> just

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
great to mention first rather than just

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.259 
great to mention first rather than just
like<00:02:58.800> jumping<00:02:59.220> into<00:02:59.370> makeup<00:02:59.670> and<00:02:59.940> things<00:03:00.150> like

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 
like jumping into makeup and things like

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:04.160 
like jumping into makeup and things like
that<00:03:00.440> so<00:03:01.440> if<00:03:01.709> you<00:03:01.980> combine<00:03:02.600> these<00:03:03.600> two<00:03:03.900> books

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
that so if you combine these two books

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.160 
that so if you combine these two books
you<00:03:04.980> seriously<00:03:05.400> have<00:03:05.489> an<00:03:05.900> encyclopedia<00:03:06.900> on

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
you seriously have an encyclopedia on

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.380 
you seriously have an encyclopedia on
beauty<00:03:07.680> like<00:03:08.310> lauren<00:03:08.670> luke<00:03:08.819> is<00:03:09.030> the<00:03:09.150> go-to
