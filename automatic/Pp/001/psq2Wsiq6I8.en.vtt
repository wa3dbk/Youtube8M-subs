00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
very contrived two type of curl and what

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.290 
very contrived two type of curl and what
we<00:00:31.349> want<00:00:31.590> is<00:00:31.710> a<00:00:31.740> sexy<00:00:32.279> more<00:00:32.430> irregular<00:00:32.940> type<00:00:33.120> of

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.510 
we want is a sexy more irregular type of
curl<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:34.079> reason<00:00:34.350> why<00:00:34.469> we're<00:00:34.649> curling<00:00:35.130> curly

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
curl the reason why we're curling curly

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.549 
curl the reason why we're curling curly
hair<00:00:35.760> ironically<00:00:36.360> is<00:00:36.600> because<00:00:36.989> the<00:00:37.350> heat

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
hair ironically is because the heat

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.560 
hair ironically is because the heat
actually<00:00:37.860> smooth<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.670> cuticle<00:00:38.820> and<00:00:39.239> creates

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
actually smooth the cuticle and creates

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.299 
actually smooth the cuticle and creates
this<00:00:39.750> more<00:00:39.989> of<00:00:40.050> a<00:00:40.110> dramatic<00:00:40.260> shine<00:00:40.829> you<00:00:41.040> just

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
this more of a dramatic shine you just

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:42.650 
this more of a dramatic shine you just
don't<00:00:41.489> get<00:00:41.610> that<00:00:41.850> from<00:00:41.969> blow-drying<00:00:42.450> or

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
don't get that from blow-drying or

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.299 
don't get that from blow-drying or
applying<00:00:42.960> a<00:00:43.079> little<00:00:43.170> bit<00:00:43.290> of<00:00:43.379> a<00:00:43.469> product<00:00:43.950> the

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
applying a little bit of a product the

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:45.950 
applying a little bit of a product the
heat<00:00:44.520> actually<00:00:44.700> smooths<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.390> cuticle<00:00:45.840> so

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
heat actually smooths the cuticle so

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:46.880 
heat actually smooths the cuticle so
that's<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.260> first<00:00:46.500> thing<00:00:46.649> that<00:00:46.800> you're

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
that's the first thing that you're

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.979 
that's the first thing that you're
looking<00:00:47.160> for<00:00:47.340> to<00:00:47.430> get<00:00:47.550> that<00:00:47.730> red-carpet<00:00:48.660> sort

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
looking for to get that red-carpet sort

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.319 
looking for to get that red-carpet sort
of<00:00:49.079> shine<00:00:49.320> the<00:00:50.280> next<00:00:50.489> thing<00:00:50.670> instead<00:00:51.270> of

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
of shine the next thing instead of

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:52.850 
of shine the next thing instead of
conventionally<00:00:52.050> wrapping<00:00:52.440> it<00:00:52.559> around<00:00:52.590> the

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
conventionally wrapping it around the

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.979 
conventionally wrapping it around the
iron<00:00:53.010> as<00:00:53.190> you<00:00:53.280> might<00:00:53.489> normally<00:00:53.730> do<00:00:54.059> so<00:00:54.090> what<00:00:54.870> we

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
iron as you might normally do so what we

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.470 
iron as you might normally do so what we
were<00:00:55.110> looking<00:00:55.410> at<00:00:55.559> is<00:00:55.829> wrapping<00:00:56.760> it<00:00:56.940> by<00:00:57.149> hand

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
were looking at is wrapping it by hand

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.150 
were looking at is wrapping it by hand
around<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:58.020> iron<00:00:58.320> so<00:00:58.739> you<00:00:58.800> can<00:00:58.920> get<00:00:59.010> a<00:00:59.039> little

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
around the iron so you can get a little

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.340 
around the iron so you can get a little
bit<00:00:59.280> more<00:00:59.430> of<00:00:59.550> an<00:00:59.670> irregular<00:01:00.030> effect<00:01:00.840> that

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
bit more of an irregular effect that

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.650 
bit more of an irregular effect that
falls<00:01:01.649> onto<00:01:01.859> a<00:01:01.980> spiral<00:01:02.520> so<00:01:03.000> wrapping<00:01:03.570> it

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
falls onto a spiral so wrapping it

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:04.939 
falls onto a spiral so wrapping it
around<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:03.930> iron<00:01:04.170> as<00:01:04.290> a<00:01:04.320> technique<00:01:04.650> we'll<00:01:04.860> be

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
around the iron as a technique we'll be

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.859 
around the iron as a technique we'll be
looking<00:01:05.100> at<00:01:05.369> in<00:01:05.489> this<00:01:05.610> video<00:01:05.760> to<00:01:06.450> create<00:01:06.600> this

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
looking at in this video to create this

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.859 
looking at in this video to create this
type<00:01:07.080> of<00:01:07.110> effect<00:01:07.590> and<00:01:07.979> another<00:01:08.430> tip<00:01:08.729> that<00:01:09.000> I'd

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
type of effect and another tip that I'd

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.630 
type of effect and another tip that I'd
like<00:01:10.020> to<00:01:10.049> share<00:01:10.350> is<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.740> actual<00:01:11.070> placement<00:01:11.520> of

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
like to share is the actual placement of

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:12.800 
like to share is the actual placement of
the<00:01:11.700> iron<00:01:11.850> so<00:01:12.119> that<00:01:12.150> you're<00:01:12.330> not<00:01:12.420> going<00:01:12.570> to<00:01:12.659> see

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
the iron so that you're not going to see

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.320 
the iron so that you're not going to see
the<00:01:12.930> iron<00:01:13.229> up<00:01:13.439> on<00:01:14.310> an<00:01:14.520> angle<00:01:14.820> like<00:01:14.909> this<00:01:15.150> you're

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
the iron up on an angle like this you're

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.200 
the iron up on an angle like this you're
gonna<00:01:15.390> see<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:15.810> iron<00:01:15.960> actually<00:01:17.210> simulating

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
gonna see the iron actually simulating

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.999 
gonna see the iron actually simulating
how<00:01:18.390> the<00:01:18.450> hair<00:01:18.659> Falls<00:01:18.960> that<00:01:19.590> way<00:01:19.710> you<00:01:19.770> don't

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
how the hair Falls that way you don't

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.450 
how the hair Falls that way you don't
get<00:01:20.250> a<00:01:20.880> crazy<00:01:21.710> outward<00:01:22.710> movement<00:01:23.220> from<00:01:23.340> the

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
get a crazy outward movement from the

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.399 
get a crazy outward movement from the
hair<00:01:23.610> there's<00:01:23.759> nothing<00:01:24.000> like<00:01:24.150> ironing<00:01:25.110> the

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
hair there's nothing like ironing the

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.050 
hair there's nothing like ironing the
hair<00:01:25.650> to<00:01:25.860> go<00:01:25.979> outward<00:01:26.220> like<00:01:26.580> a<00:01:26.610> horn<00:01:26.939> that

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
hair to go outward like a horn that

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.999 
hair to go outward like a horn that
would<00:01:27.330> be<00:01:27.450> a<00:01:27.479> mistake<00:01:27.630> so<00:01:28.409> you'll<00:01:28.619> notice<00:01:28.860> that

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
would be a mistake so you'll notice that

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.830 
would be a mistake so you'll notice that
when<00:01:29.250> I'm<00:01:29.369> using<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.759> iron<00:01:30.000> I'm<00:01:30.450> coming<00:01:30.750> in

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
when I'm using the iron I'm coming in

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.569 
when I'm using the iron I'm coming in
with<00:01:30.869> the<00:01:31.049> base<00:01:31.259> it's<00:01:31.860> actually<00:01:32.189> angling

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
with the base it's actually angling

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:33.920 
with the base it's actually angling
downward<00:01:33.030> in<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.210> direction<00:01:33.450> you<00:01:33.630> want<00:01:33.659> it<00:01:33.810> to

downward in the direction you want it to
fall<00:01:34.140> and<00:01:34.500> then<00:01:34.619> as<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.860> hair<00:01:35.009> wraps<00:01:35.280> around

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:35.540 
fall and then as the hair wraps around

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.480 
fall and then as the hair wraps around
it's<00:01:36.540> actually<00:01:37.049> ready<00:01:37.290> to<00:01:37.470> fall<00:01:37.770> in<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.460> right

finish on it and so today I wanted to
introduce<00:02:09.210> the<00:02:09.600> use<00:02:09.780> of<00:02:10.020> a<00:02:10.230> hot<00:02:10.410> tool<00:02:10.680> a

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
introduce the use of a hot tool a

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.730 
introduce the use of a hot tool a
curling<00:02:11.490> iron<00:02:11.640> and<00:02:12.000> in<00:02:12.570> this<00:02:12.690> instance<00:02:12.960> what

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
curling iron and in this instance what

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.830 
curling iron and in this instance what
I'd<00:02:13.860> like<00:02:14.040> to<00:02:14.190> do<00:02:14.370> is<00:02:14.610> take<00:02:14.850> this<00:02:15.090> first<00:02:15.450> piece

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
I'd like to do is take this first piece

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.450 
I'd like to do is take this first piece
and<00:02:16.080> start<00:02:16.230> to<00:02:16.410> accessorize<00:02:17.010> this<00:02:17.220> with<00:02:17.400> a

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
and start to accessorize this with a

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.010 
and start to accessorize this with a
little<00:02:17.670> bit<00:02:17.790> more<00:02:17.910> finish<00:02:18.240> now<00:02:18.750> the<00:02:18.810> neat

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
little bit more finish now the neat

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.570 
little bit more finish now the neat
thing<00:02:19.200> about<00:02:19.380> hot<00:02:19.620> tools<00:02:19.890> is<00:02:20.130> is<00:02:20.310> that<00:02:20.490> the

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
thing about hot tools is is that the

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.520 
thing about hot tools is is that the
heat<00:02:20.820> actually<00:02:21.000> smoothes<00:02:21.600> the<00:02:21.780> cuticle<00:02:22.290> and

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
heat actually smoothes the cuticle and

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.590 
heat actually smoothes the cuticle and
in<00:02:22.710> that<00:02:22.890> process<00:02:23.370> makes<00:02:23.940> the<00:02:24.030> hair<00:02:24.270> shiny

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
in that process makes the hair shiny

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.080 
in that process makes the hair shiny
more<00:02:25.200> dramatic<00:02:25.710> finish<00:02:26.100> and<00:02:26.370> so<00:02:26.760> in<00:02:26.910> some

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
more dramatic finish and so in some

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.400 
more dramatic finish and so in some
instances<00:02:27.120> where<00:02:27.780> you<00:02:27.840> see<00:02:28.050> more<00:02:28.200> of<00:02:28.260> a

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
instances where you see more of a

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.430 
instances where you see more of a
natural<00:02:28.650> kind<00:02:29.550> of<00:02:29.820> edgy<00:02:30.510> more<00:02:30.990> editorial

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
natural kind of edgy more editorial

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.200 
natural kind of edgy more editorial
quality<00:02:32.040> well<00:02:32.430> if<00:02:32.550> you<00:02:32.670> want<00:02:32.880> a<00:02:32.970> little<00:02:33.120> bit

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:33.210 
quality well if you want a little bit

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:34.700 
quality well if you want a little bit
more<00:02:33.420> of<00:02:33.480> a<00:02:33.540> dramatic<00:02:33.660> finish<00:02:34.170> than<00:02:34.470> what<00:02:34.590> we

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:34.710 
more of a dramatic finish than what we

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:36.770 
more of a dramatic finish than what we
can<00:02:34.860> start<00:02:35.130> to<00:02:35.220> do<00:02:35.400> here<00:02:35.730> you<00:02:36.330> don't<00:02:36.510> even<00:02:36.630> have

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
can start to do here you don't even have

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.360 
can start to do here you don't even have
to<00:02:37.020> wind<00:02:37.380> the<00:02:37.530> hair<00:02:37.710> around<00:02:37.830> the<00:02:37.950> iron<00:02:38.010> you<00:02:38.280> can

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
to wind the hair around the iron you can

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.110 
to wind the hair around the iron you can
actually<00:02:39.290> wrap<00:02:40.290> it<00:02:40.470> around<00:02:40.560> like<00:02:41.130> this<00:02:41.460> in

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
actually wrap it around like this in

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.570 
actually wrap it around like this in
this<00:02:42.480> case<00:02:42.920> and<00:02:43.920> then<00:02:44.070> you<00:02:44.160> can<00:02:44.310> touch<00:02:44.550> a

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
this case and then you can touch a

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.190 
this case and then you can touch a
little<00:02:44.850> bit<00:02:45.060> just<00:02:45.330> to<00:02:45.480> see<00:02:45.510> how<00:02:45.840> hot<00:02:46.020> it's

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
little bit just to see how hot it's

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.710 
little bit just to see how hot it's
getting<00:02:46.260> you<00:02:46.740> don't<00:02:46.920> want<00:02:47.070> to<00:02:47.360> overheat<00:02:48.360> the

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
getting you don't want to overheat the

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.570 
getting you don't want to overheat the
hair<00:02:48.930> but<00:02:49.170> you're<00:02:49.410> just<00:02:49.590> keeping<00:02:49.740> mindful<00:02:50.370> of

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
hair but you're just keeping mindful of

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.240 
hair but you're just keeping mindful of
the<00:02:51.300> temperature<00:02:51.780> and<00:02:51.990> then<00:02:52.530> as<00:02:52.680> we<00:02:52.800> pull<00:02:53.070> that

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
the temperature and then as we pull that

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.370 
the temperature and then as we pull that
away<00:02:53.490> you<00:02:53.880> start<00:02:54.450> to<00:02:54.600> see<00:02:54.780> much<00:02:54.960> more<00:02:54.990> of<00:02:55.260> a

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
away you start to see much more of a

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.160 
away you start to see much more of a
finished<00:02:56.360> effect<00:02:57.360> a<00:02:57.480> little<00:02:57.570> more<00:02:57.780> of<00:02:57.840> a<00:02:57.900> shiny

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
finished effect a little more of a shiny

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:59.960 
finished effect a little more of a shiny
quality<00:02:58.680> going<00:02:58.950> on<00:02:59.100> in<00:02:59.220> the<00:02:59.310> hair<00:02:59.520> and<00:02:59.670> we<00:02:59.820> can

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
quality going on in the hair and we can

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:00.650 
quality going on in the hair and we can
just<00:03:00.060> let<00:03:00.210> that<00:03:00.270> go

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
just let that go

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:05.270 
just let that go
if<00:03:01.050> it<00:03:01.350> was<00:03:01.850> too<00:03:03.410> curled<00:03:04.410> which<00:03:04.800> is<00:03:04.980> not<00:03:05.130> the

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
if it was too curled which is not the

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.410 
if it was too curled which is not the
case<00:03:05.459> because<00:03:05.610> we<00:03:05.820> have<00:03:05.910> a<00:03:05.940> little<00:03:06.090> bit<00:03:06.240> of<00:03:06.330> a

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
case because we have a little bit of a

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.000 
case because we have a little bit of a
waxy<00:03:06.870> product<00:03:07.260> on<00:03:07.380> here<00:03:07.530> at<00:03:07.590> the<00:03:07.680> moment<00:03:07.709> but
