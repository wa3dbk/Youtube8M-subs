around good you go to this wall you
target<00:00:17.279> it<00:00:17.400> you're<00:00:17.970> gonna<00:00:18.060> right<00:00:18.359> side<00:00:18.779> hop

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
target it you're gonna right side hop

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.130 
target it you're gonna right side hop
side<00:00:19.740> roll<00:00:20.010> and<00:00:20.250> target<00:00:20.670> retarget<00:00:21.359> back<00:00:21.869> walk

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
side roll and target retarget back walk

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.380 
side roll and target retarget back walk
really<00:00:22.320> slow<00:00:22.710> okay<00:00:23.699> sometimes<00:00:23.760> it<00:00:24.240> does<00:00:24.359> that

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
really slow okay sometimes it does that

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.750 
really slow okay sometimes it does that
I<00:00:24.600> don't<00:00:24.779> know<00:00:24.840> why<00:00:24.960> it's<00:00:25.109> doing<00:00:25.170> that<00:00:25.640> this<00:00:26.640> is

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
I don't know why it's doing that this is

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.029 
I don't know why it's doing that this is
just<00:00:26.939> to<00:00:27.090> do<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.480> way<00:00:27.660> the<00:00:27.720> method<00:00:28.470> is<00:00:28.560> because

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
just to do the way the method is because

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.959 
just to do the way the method is because
it's<00:00:30.679> you<00:00:31.679> back<00:00:31.859> walk<00:00:32.160> really<00:00:32.369> slowly<00:00:32.790> and

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
it's you back walk really slowly and

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.180 
it's you back walk really slowly and
then<00:00:33.270> roll<00:00:33.630> on<00:00:33.899> target<00:00:34.350> retarget<00:00:34.890> and<00:00:35.070> then

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
then roll on target retarget and then

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.350 
then roll on target retarget and then
we're<00:00:35.280> just<00:00:35.309> going<00:00:35.579> to<00:00:35.640> I<00:00:35.790> thought<00:00:35.880> that<00:00:36.180> right

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
we're just going to I thought that right

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.069 
we're just going to I thought that right
over<00:00:36.570> here<00:00:36.750> you<00:00:37.710> could<00:00:37.829> do<00:00:37.890> any<00:00:38.719> setup<00:00:39.719> methyl

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
over here you could do any setup methyl

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.260 
over here you could do any setup methyl
to<00:00:40.200> this<00:00:40.350> but<00:00:40.590> this<00:00:40.710> is<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:40.980> one<00:00:41.070> I<00:00:41.160> choose<00:00:41.340> so

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
to this but this is the one I choose so

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.670 
to this but this is the one I choose so
we're<00:00:42.390> gonna<00:00:42.510> get<00:00:42.690> into<00:00:42.840> this<00:00:42.989> corner<00:00:43.320> back

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
we're gonna get into this corner back

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.490 
we're gonna get into this corner back
flip<00:00:43.980> we're<00:00:44.460> gonna<00:00:44.550> hold<00:00:44.910> slightly<00:00:45.690> down<00:00:45.899> left

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
flip we're gonna hold slightly down left

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.209 
flip we're gonna hold slightly down left
on<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:47.820> control<00:00:48.149> stick<00:00:48.180> and<00:00:48.690> then<00:00:49.289> mash<00:00:49.739> down

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
on the control stick and then mash down

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.930 
on the control stick and then mash down
left<00:00:50.579> to<00:00:51.059> side<00:00:51.300> hop<00:00:51.510> so<00:00:52.440> mad<00:00:53.190> like<00:00:53.520> basically

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
left to side hop so mad like basically

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.840 
left to side hop so mad like basically
hold<00:00:54.239> down<00:00:54.539> left<00:00:54.809> and<00:00:55.079> mash<00:00:55.320> a<00:00:55.620> and<00:00:55.890> then<00:00:56.520> all

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
hold down left and mash a and then all

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.599 
hold down left and mash a and then all
the<00:00:56.910> way<00:00:57.270> down<00:00:57.480> left<00:00:57.750> and<00:00:58.050> mesh<00:00:58.559> a<00:00:58.770> again<00:00:59.809> so

00:01:01.599 --> 00:01:01.609 
the way down left and mesh a again so

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:05.810 
the way down left and mesh a again so
all<00:01:02.609> right<00:01:04.040> okay<00:01:05.040> I<00:01:05.070> didn't<00:01:05.400> get<00:01:05.489> it<00:01:05.610> there

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
all right okay I didn't get it there

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.850 
all right okay I didn't get it there
basically<00:01:06.510> I<00:01:06.540> pause<00:01:06.780> right<00:01:07.049> after<00:01:07.320> I<00:01:07.350> side<00:01:07.619> hop

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
basically I pause right after I side hop

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.350 
basically I pause right after I side hop
just<00:01:08.280> to<00:01:08.400> make<00:01:08.430> sure<00:01:08.580> I<00:01:08.729> get<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:09.000> clip<00:01:09.210> and

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
just to make sure I get the clip and

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.149 
just to make sure I get the clip and

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
a weird angle when I have to redo my

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
a weird angle when I have to redo my
angle<00:01:22.049> Oh<00:01:23.210> nope<00:01:24.350> so<00:01:25.350> I<00:01:27.049> was<00:01:28.049> too<00:01:28.229> worried<00:01:28.500> right

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
thing but we're gonna hold up and let go

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.460 
thing but we're gonna hold up and let go
of<00:01:37.380> Z<00:01:37.530> target<00:01:37.920> so<00:01:38.759> I'm<00:01:39.090> just<00:01:39.329> holding<00:01:39.869> up<00:01:40.200> and

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
of Z target so I'm just holding up and

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.830 
of Z target so I'm just holding up and
we're<00:01:41.070> gonna<00:01:41.130> pause<00:01:41.400> buffer<00:01:41.700> yeah<00:01:42.180> that<00:01:42.689> was

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
we're gonna pause buffer yeah that was

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.740 
we're gonna pause buffer yeah that was
bad<00:01:42.990> I<00:01:43.280> didn't<00:01:44.280> hold<00:01:44.460> up<00:01:44.640> long<00:01:45.030> enough<00:01:45.210> so

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
bad I didn't hold up long enough so

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.130 
bad I didn't hold up long enough so
that's<00:01:45.990> well<00:01:46.920> there<00:01:47.070> you<00:01:47.100> go<00:01:47.840> it's<00:01:48.840> good<00:01:49.020> that

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
that's well there you go it's good that

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.100 
that's well there you go it's good that
I<00:01:49.170> show<00:01:49.439> some<00:01:49.649> failures<00:01:50.070> so<00:01:50.729> that<00:01:51.030> you<00:01:51.540> can<00:01:51.780> see

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
I show some failures so that you can see

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.840 
I show some failures so that you can see
what<00:01:52.259> not<00:01:52.439> to<00:01:52.470> do<00:01:52.740> and<00:01:52.770> what<00:01:53.009> it<00:01:53.100> looks<00:01:53.310> like<00:01:53.490> so

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
what not to do and what it looks like so

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.740 
what not to do and what it looks like so
that<00:01:54.030> was<00:01:54.210> if<00:01:54.600> you<00:01:54.990> don't<00:01:55.409> hold<00:01:55.710> up<00:01:56.450> without<00:01:57.450> Z

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
that was if you don't hold up without Z

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.709 
that was if you don't hold up without Z
targeting

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:04.020 

so<00:02:01.719> if<00:02:01.869> you<00:02:01.990> don't<00:02:02.250> if<00:02:03.250> you<00:02:03.399> don't<00:02:03.549> hold<00:02:03.789> up

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
so if you don't if you don't hold up

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:05.819 
so if you don't if you don't hold up
without<00:02:04.450> Z<00:02:04.659> targeting<00:02:05.079> right<00:02:05.259> after<00:02:05.530> you<00:02:05.619> set

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:05.829 
without Z targeting right after you set

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:07.260 
without Z targeting right after you set
hop<00:02:06.070> and<00:02:06.340> click<00:02:06.549> through<00:02:06.729> the<00:02:06.820> door<00:02:06.969> then<00:02:07.240> that

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
hop and click through the door then that

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:12.890 
hop and click through the door then that
happens<00:02:09.179> okay<00:02:10.179> that's<00:02:10.630> not<00:02:10.840> a<00:02:10.869> good<00:02:11.130> frame

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
happens okay that's not a good frame

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.870 
happens okay that's not a good frame
that's<00:02:13.900> not<00:02:14.110> either<00:02:14.319> one<00:02:15.280> second<00:02:15.550> only<00:02:15.670> to<00:02:15.760> my

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
that's not either one second only to my

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:20.040 
that's not either one second only to my
clip<00:02:17.130> there<00:02:18.130> we<00:02:18.220> go<00:02:18.310> so<00:02:18.640> you<00:02:19.330> see<00:02:19.510> kind<00:02:19.810> of<00:02:19.870> went

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
clip there we go so you see kind of went

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:21.900 
clip there we go so you see kind of went
past<00:02:20.380> the<00:02:20.530> door<00:02:20.739> so<00:02:21.370> now<00:02:21.489> I'm<00:02:21.550> going<00:02:21.670> to<00:02:21.790> hold

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
past the door so now I'm going to hold

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.790 
past the door so now I'm going to hold
up<00:02:22.060> and<00:02:22.269> not<00:02:22.330> z<00:02:22.750> target<00:02:23.140> and<00:02:23.319> I<00:02:23.440> gotta<00:02:23.590> pause

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
up and not z target and I gotta pause

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.589 
up and not z target and I gotta pause
buffer<00:02:24.040> this<00:02:24.340> till<00:02:24.700> I<00:02:24.760> get<00:02:24.910> to<00:02:25.000> that<00:02:25.120> frame<00:02:25.390> and

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:25.599 
buffer this till I get to that frame and

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:27.750 
buffer this till I get to that frame and
now<00:02:26.440> i'm<00:02:26.769> going<00:02:26.920> to<00:02:26.980> buffer<00:02:27.370> I'm<00:02:27.580> going<00:02:27.700> to

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
now i'm going to buffer I'm going to

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.550 
now i'm going to buffer I'm going to
hold<00:02:27.910> left<00:02:28.209> on<00:02:28.569> my<00:02:28.840> control<00:02:29.170> stick<00:02:29.410> you<00:02:29.530> can

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
hold left on my control stick you can

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.309 
hold left on my control stick you can
hold<00:02:29.769> left<00:02:29.980> now<00:02:30.160> and<00:02:30.430> then<00:02:31.239> during<00:02:32.080> the

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:32.319 
hold left now and then during the

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:34.440 
hold left now and then during the
unpause<00:02:32.620> lag<00:02:32.890> you<00:02:33.130> need<00:02:33.280> to<00:02:33.370> hold<00:02:33.580> Z<00:02:34.060> target

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
unpause lag you need to hold Z target

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:39.809 
unpause lag you need to hold Z target
and<00:02:37.709> you<00:02:38.709> need<00:02:38.860> to<00:02:38.920> do<00:02:39.040> it<00:02:39.160> during<00:02:39.340> the<00:02:39.519> unpause

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:39.819 
and you need to do it during the unpause

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:42.000 
and you need to do it during the unpause
lag<00:02:40.090> if<00:02:40.269> you<00:02:40.390> do<00:02:40.569> it<00:02:40.720> now<00:02:41.080> then<00:02:41.739> it<00:02:41.890> won't

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
lag if you do it now then it won't

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.339 
lag if you do it now then it won't
register<00:02:42.250> so<00:02:43.120> this<00:02:43.599> is<00:02:43.780> probably<00:02:44.080> the

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:44.349 
register so this is probably the

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:45.870 
register so this is probably the
trickiest<00:02:44.590> part<00:02:45.099> and<00:02:45.280> where<00:02:45.370> most<00:02:45.640> people

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
trickiest part and where most people

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.720 
trickiest part and where most people
mess<00:02:46.060> up<00:02:46.090> is<00:02:46.450> that<00:02:46.989> you<00:02:47.080> need<00:02:47.290> to<00:02:47.500> buffer<00:02:48.040> the<00:02:48.069> Z

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
mess up is that you need to buffer the Z

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.910 
mess up is that you need to buffer the Z
target<00:02:49.150> for<00:02:49.900> it<00:02:49.989> to<00:02:50.110> work<00:02:50.260> and<00:02:50.500> then<00:02:50.650> if<00:02:50.799> it

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
target for it to work and then if it

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.110 
target for it to work and then if it
does<00:02:51.069> work<00:02:51.220> and<00:02:51.430> you<00:02:51.489> get<00:02:51.610> a<00:02:51.640> frame<00:02:51.880> then

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
does work and you get a frame then

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.370 
does work and you get a frame then
you'll<00:02:52.209> kind<00:02:52.420> of<00:02:52.510> hear<00:02:52.690> that<00:02:52.840> sound<00:02:53.140> that<00:02:53.230> it

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
you'll kind of hear that sound that it

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.140 
you'll kind of hear that sound that it
makes<00:02:53.410> like<00:02:53.799> that<00:02:53.980> wool<00:02:54.160> that<00:02:54.700> it<00:02:54.819> makes<00:02:54.970> when

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
makes like that wool that it makes when

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.720 
makes like that wool that it makes when
you<00:02:55.299> Z<00:02:55.599> target<00:02:56.019> that's<00:02:56.920> if<00:02:57.069> it<00:02:57.190> works<00:02:57.370> and<00:02:57.670> you

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
you Z target that's if it works and you

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.670 
you Z target that's if it works and you
get<00:02:58.090> one<00:02:58.239> frame<00:02:58.510> so<00:02:58.989> I'm<00:02:59.110> going<00:02:59.230> to<00:02:59.290> hold<00:02:59.440> left

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
get one frame so I'm going to hold left

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.410 
get one frame so I'm going to hold left
and<00:03:00.299> when<00:03:01.299> I<00:03:01.329> unpause<00:03:01.660> I'm<00:03:01.900> gonna<00:03:02.019> hold<00:03:02.140> see

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
and when I unpause I'm gonna hold see

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.960 
and when I unpause I'm gonna hold see
there<00:03:04.420> we<00:03:04.480> go<00:03:04.600> ec<00:03:05.019> heard<00:03:05.260> the<00:03:05.410> sound<00:03:05.650> and<00:03:05.950> I<00:03:05.980> got

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
there we go ec heard the sound and I got

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:08.789 
there we go ec heard the sound and I got
that<00:03:07.120> one<00:03:07.239> frame<00:03:07.540> so<00:03:08.350> now<00:03:08.500> we're<00:03:08.709> gonna

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:08.799 
that one frame so now we're gonna

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:12.270 
that one frame so now we're gonna
continue<00:03:09.069> holding<00:03:09.519> Z<00:03:09.700> target<00:03:10.060> and<00:03:10.209> left<00:03:10.450> and<00:03:11.280> I

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
continue holding Z target and left and I

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.979 
continue holding Z target and left and I
hate<00:03:12.519> how<00:03:12.640> the<00:03:12.700> screen<00:03:13.239> goes<00:03:13.390> like<00:03:13.569> this<00:03:13.750> that

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:13.989 
hate how the screen goes like this that

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:17.129 
hate how the screen goes like this that
messes<00:03:14.319> me<00:03:14.440> up<00:03:14.470> a<00:03:14.680> lot<00:03:14.859> so<00:03:15.750> okay<00:03:16.750> so<00:03:16.780> I'm<00:03:16.989> going

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:17.139 
messes me up a lot so okay so I'm going

00:03:17.139 --> 00:03:19.319 
messes me up a lot so okay so I'm going
to<00:03:17.170> hold<00:03:17.319> left<00:03:17.590> and<00:03:17.980> we're<00:03:18.700> gonna<00:03:18.790> go<00:03:19.030> until

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:19.329 
to hold left and we're gonna go until

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:21.410 
to hold left and we're gonna go until
the<00:03:19.450> second<00:03:19.810> frame<00:03:19.989> we<00:03:20.109> can<00:03:20.260> see<00:03:20.440> links<00:03:20.620> hair

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
the second frame we can see links hair

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:27.030 
the second frame we can see links hair
so<00:03:22.420> let<00:03:23.109> me<00:03:23.230> just<00:03:23.380> get<00:03:23.560> those<00:03:23.769> frames<00:03:26.040> that's

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
so let me just get those frames that's

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:32.450 
so let me just get those frames that's
one<00:03:29.310> come<00:03:30.310> on

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:32.460 

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:35.940

oops and okay well good this is this is
the<00:03:36.040> other<00:03:36.130> frame<00:03:36.400> if<00:03:36.580> you<00:03:36.820> go<00:03:36.940> too<00:03:37.000> far<00:03:37.300> like

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
the other frame if you go too far like

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.630 
the other frame if you go too far like
this<00:03:37.510> like<00:03:38.410> I<00:03:38.530> just<00:03:38.590> got<00:03:38.740> two<00:03:38.980> frames<00:03:39.250> instead

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640 
this like I just got two frames instead

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.460 
this like I just got two frames instead
of<00:03:39.730> one<00:03:39.880> then<00:03:40.540> there's<00:03:40.900> nothing<00:03:41.110> you<00:03:41.230> can<00:03:41.350> do

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
of one then there's nothing you can do

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:43.830 
of one then there's nothing you can do
link<00:03:41.740> avoid<00:03:42.010> up<00:03:42.190> they'll<00:03:42.970> just<00:03:43.150> get<00:03:43.330> sucked<00:03:43.690> up

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 
link avoid up they'll just get sucked up

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.270 
link avoid up they'll just get sucked up
into<00:03:44.020> the<00:03:44.140> door<00:03:44.290> and<00:03:44.530> like<00:03:44.680> void<00:03:44.890> out<00:03:45.100> it's

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
into the door and like void out it's

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:50.490 
into the door and like void out it's
really<00:03:45.460> weird<00:03:46.560> so<00:03:47.560> now<00:03:48.990> I'm<00:03:49.990> gonna<00:03:50.170> have<00:03:50.320> to<00:03:50.410> do

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
really weird so now I'm gonna have to do

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.590 
really weird so now I'm gonna have to do
it<00:03:50.530> all<00:03:50.710> again<00:03:50.830> I'll<00:03:51.790> try<00:03:51.940> to<00:03:51.970> get<00:03:52.120> their<00:03:52.300> kind

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:52.600

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:03.070 
let's recap so we hold up without Z

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:06.000 
let's recap so we hold up without Z
target<00:05:04.169> until<00:05:05.169> we<00:05:05.290> get<00:05:05.410> to<00:05:05.500> the<00:05:05.620> weird<00:05:05.800> door

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:06.010 
target until we get to the weird door

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:10.020 
target until we get to the weird door
frame<00:05:06.280> and<00:05:06.520> then<00:05:07.480> we<00:05:08.050> hold<00:05:08.320> left<00:05:08.800> and<00:05:09.070> z<00:05:09.640> target

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:10.030 
frame and then we hold left and z target

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:12.830 
frame and then we hold left and z target
and<00:05:10.180> then<00:05:10.660> once<00:05:11.230> we<00:05:11.410> get<00:05:11.530> to<00:05:11.590> this<00:05:11.890> frame<00:05:12.190> here

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:12.840 
and then once we get to this frame here

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:15.890 
and then once we get to this frame here
I'll<00:05:13.840> show<00:05:13.870> you<00:05:14.050> this<00:05:14.380> frame<00:05:15.280> right<00:05:15.580> there

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:15.900 
I'll show you this frame right there

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.060 
I'll show you this frame right there

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:18.070 
should look something like that might be

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:20.400

like<00:06:09.730> that<00:06:10.620> nice<00:06:11.620> and<00:06:11.830> easy<00:06:11.920> so<00:06:12.760> I'd<00:06:13.690> showed

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:13.930 
like that nice and easy so I'd showed

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:15.480 
like that nice and easy so I'd showed
again<00:06:14.170> but<00:06:14.380> I<00:06:14.530> don't<00:06:14.680> know<00:06:14.740> how<00:06:14.860> to<00:06:14.920> do<00:06:15.160> a<00:06:15.190> verse

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:15.490 
again but I don't know how to do a verse

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:18.420 
again but I don't know how to do a verse
door<00:06:15.790> skip<00:06:16.060> but<00:06:16.840> basically<00:06:17.440> that's<00:06:18.070> how<00:06:18.250> it's

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:18.430 
door skip but basically that's how it's

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:19.920 
door skip but basically that's how it's
going<00:06:18.520> to<00:06:18.610> be<00:06:18.730> every<00:06:19.000> time<00:06:19.210> and<00:06:19.510> I<00:06:19.570> could<00:06:19.750> show

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:19.930 
going to be every time and I could show

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:22.740 
going to be every time and I could show
you<00:06:19.960> doing<00:06:20.260> it<00:06:20.350> fast<00:06:20.590> but<00:06:21.330> it's<00:06:22.330> it's

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:22.750 
you doing it fast but it's it's

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:25.080 
you doing it fast but it's it's
difficult<00:06:23.260> it's<00:06:23.440> it's<00:06:23.680> it's<00:06:24.010> probably<00:06:24.910> the

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:25.090 
difficult it's it's it's probably the

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:31.110 
difficult it's it's it's probably the
most<00:06:25.240> difficult<00:06:25.420> skip<00:06:26.020> or<00:06:27.010> a<00:06:27.070> trick<00:06:27.730> in<00:06:28.450> the<00:06:30.120> no

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:31.120 
most difficult skip or a trick in the no

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:32.820 
most difficult skip or a trick in the no
wrong<00:06:31.300> warp<00:06:31.570> category<00:06:32.110> because<00:06:32.380> I<00:06:32.560> don't

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:32.830 
wrong warp category because I don't

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:34.200 
wrong warp category because I don't
really<00:06:33.010> think<00:06:33.280> there's<00:06:33.430> enough<00:06:33.670> a<00:06:33.730> category

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:34.210 
really think there's enough a category

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:36.420 
really think there's enough a category
that<00:06:34.390> does<00:06:34.600> swordless<00:06:35.170> thought<00:06:35.470> skip<00:06:35.800> besides

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:36.430 
that does swordless thought skip besides

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:40.890 
that does swordless thought skip besides
no<00:06:36.670> wrong<00:06:36.880> work<00:06:37.710> so<00:06:39.240> yeah<00:06:40.240> that's<00:06:40.420> sort<00:06:40.690> list

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:40.900 
no wrong work so yeah that's sort list

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:43.170 
no wrong work so yeah that's sort list
dot<00:06:41.020> skip<00:06:41.380> you<00:06:41.650> can<00:06:41.920> play<00:06:42.250> with<00:06:42.400> it<00:06:42.460> like<00:06:42.970> play

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:43.180 
dot skip you can play with it like play

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:46.830 
dot skip you can play with it like play
around<00:06:43.330> with<00:06:43.510> it<00:06:43.540> yourself<00:06:44.020> try<00:06:44.980> to<00:06:45.040> get<00:06:45.840> like

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:46.840 
around with it yourself try to get like

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:50.310 
around with it yourself try to get like
buffer<00:06:47.350> list<00:06:47.560> or<00:06:48.160> something<00:06:48.390> hard<00:06:49.390> I<00:06:49.780> don't

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:50.320 
buffer list or something hard I don't

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:51.540 
buffer list or something hard I don't
know<00:06:50.380> it's<00:06:50.560> so<00:06:50.680> hard<00:06:50.920> to<00:06:50.950> get<00:06:51.100> buffer<00:06:51.370> list

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:51.550 
know it's so hard to get buffer list

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:54.870 
know it's so hard to get buffer list
it's<00:06:51.700> ridiculous<00:06:53.010> so<00:06:54.010> I'll<00:06:54.400> just<00:06:54.460> go<00:06:54.670> into<00:06:54.790> the

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:54.880 
it's ridiculous so I'll just go into the

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:56.910 
it's ridiculous so I'll just go into the
cutscene<00:06:55.270> show<00:06:55.750> you<00:06:55.810> that<00:06:56.260> everything<00:06:56.710> works

00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:56.920 
cutscene show you that everything works

00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:01.439 
cutscene show you that everything works
and<00:06:57.220> that's<00:06:57.790> it<00:06:59.190> so

00:07:01.439 --> 00:07:01.449 
and that's it so

00:07:01.449 --> 00:07:05.100 
and that's it so
yeah<00:07:02.340> that's<00:07:03.340> about<00:07:03.490> it<00:07:03.639> I<00:07:04.029> think<00:07:05.020> I'll

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:05.110 
yeah that's about it I think I'll

00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:06.929 
yeah that's about it I think I'll
probably<00:07:05.259> make<00:07:05.469> this<00:07:05.529> is<00:07:06.129> there<00:07:06.550> a<00:07:06.580> YouTube

00:07:06.929 --> 00:07:06.939 
probably make this is there a YouTube

00:07:06.939 --> 00:07:10.049 
probably make this is there a YouTube
tutorial<00:07:06.969> for<00:07:07.659> that<00:07:07.779> no<00:07:08.189> there<00:07:09.189> is<00:07:09.430> but

00:07:10.049 --> 00:07:10.059 
tutorial for that no there is but

00:07:10.059 --> 00:07:12.929 
tutorial for that no there is but
there's<00:07:10.360> no<00:07:10.509> like<00:07:11.279> commentary<00:07:12.279> or<00:07:12.610> help

00:07:12.929 --> 00:07:12.939 
there's no like commentary or help

00:07:12.939 --> 00:07:15.299 
there's no like commentary or help
usually<00:07:13.749> it's<00:07:13.900> just<00:07:14.169> some<00:07:14.349> guy<00:07:14.499> doing<00:07:15.159> it

00:07:15.299 --> 00:07:15.309 
usually it's just some guy doing it

00:07:15.309 --> 00:07:19.409 
usually it's just some guy doing it
really<00:07:15.669> fast<00:07:15.789> and<00:07:16.360> then<00:07:17.159> and<00:07:18.159> then<00:07:18.759> he'll<00:07:19.029> put

00:07:19.409 --> 00:07:19.419 
really fast and then and then he'll put

00:07:19.419 --> 00:07:21.510 
really fast and then and then he'll put
like<00:07:19.629> how<00:07:19.659> to<00:07:19.900> do<00:07:20.110> it<00:07:20.199> in<00:07:20.259> the<00:07:20.319> description<00:07:20.520> but

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:21.520 
like how to do it in the description but

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:23.879 
like how to do it in the description but
pretty<00:07:21.969> much<00:07:22.029> I<00:07:22.360> spent<00:07:22.659> like<00:07:22.779> a<00:07:23.080> day<00:07:23.680> and<00:07:23.800> a

00:07:23.879 --> 00:07:23.889 
pretty much I spent like a day and a

00:07:23.889 --> 00:07:25.469 
pretty much I spent like a day and a
half<00:07:23.919> trying<00:07:24.460> to<00:07:24.580> figure<00:07:24.789> out<00:07:24.849> how<00:07:24.999> to<00:07:25.059> do<00:07:25.300> this

00:07:25.469 --> 00:07:25.479 
half trying to figure out how to do this

00:07:25.479 --> 00:07:28.439 
half trying to figure out how to do this
and<00:07:25.809> I<00:07:26.800> had<00:07:26.979> to<00:07:27.099> figure<00:07:27.279> it<00:07:27.460> out<00:07:27.550> a<00:07:27.849> lot<00:07:28.240> for

00:07:28.439 --> 00:07:28.449 
and I had to figure it out a lot for

00:07:28.449 --> 00:07:30.149 
and I had to figure it out a lot for
myself<00:07:28.809> so<00:07:29.080> I<00:07:29.110> just<00:07:29.379> I'm<00:07:29.620> probably<00:07:29.830> gonna<00:07:29.979> make

00:07:30.149 --> 00:07:30.159 
myself so I just I'm probably gonna make

00:07:30.159 --> 00:07:32.670 
myself so I just I'm probably gonna make
this<00:07:30.279> video<00:07:30.460> on<00:07:30.909> YouTube<00:07:31.539> and<00:07:32.259> it<00:07:32.439> might<00:07:32.559> be

00:07:32.670 --> 00:07:32.680 
this video on YouTube and it might be

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:34.230 
this video on YouTube and it might be
really<00:07:32.889> long<00:07:33.129> but<00:07:33.460> you<00:07:33.580> know<00:07:33.669> what<00:07:33.819> people<00:07:33.999> can

00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:34.240 
really long but you know what people can

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:35.519 
really long but you know what people can
sit<00:07:34.449> through<00:07:34.659> it<00:07:34.689> if<00:07:34.870> they<00:07:34.990> really<00:07:35.199> don't<00:07:35.469> know

00:07:35.519 --> 00:07:35.529 
sit through it if they really don't know

00:07:35.529 --> 00:07:39.089 
sit through it if they really don't know
how<00:07:35.710> to<00:07:35.740> do<00:07:35.949> it<00:07:36.069> so<00:07:37.199> for<00:07:38.199> for<00:07:38.710> the<00:07:38.800> YouTube
