00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:15.690
 hi gt guys and well found with 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:18.150
 this we call purely way test 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.050
 completeness are here to introduce you to the 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:24.480
 darfur 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:27.000
 the 7200 50 tv black edition is in fact 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.010
 what you can download if one 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.820
 goes to buy the practically la 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:36.120
 digital version of the game I was a bit 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.100
 forgotten and to install the mode e 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.920
 since I did some cleaning I got it 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.540
 visa and tomasi for completeness let's throw away 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.000
 inside and we also make a video that is 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.700
 Always a video more 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.260
 substantially the same is the same 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:55.190
 just let's say it's changed a little 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:59.280
 point the aesthetics or with black so from a 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:03.600
 make scoma a little more a little bit worse 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:07.740
 and everything else works 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:09.810
 all very well and we have a month with 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.950
 a little detail of the taking of 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.430
 power 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.530
 That's why I've seen a bit by now to 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.800
 to which, however, we also say exiting means 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:22.130
 original though they are 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:27.200
 are facts are made well you want to 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:28.970
 light lights behind and more 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:33.470
 the interiors are put a little like that 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:38.150
 we usually use our hand and hold on 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:42.790
 fund because of those there depends on 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:45.800
 graphics you have and others have anyway 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:47.900
 just a fashion is good and it comes 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:50.480
 added so you find them in the category 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:55.250
 to Modena after a point ahead 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:58.340
 with the menu it is more for competence where 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:01.310
 I do it more than to test true way e 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:06.920
 right here maximum speed will take in 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:12.140
 mind 62 tried to come up we say with the 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:14.650
 wagon I have and I must say that I know how I feel 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.650
 in stone 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.300
 here is dispelled fences 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:28.940
 no because I have to say more beautiful so that 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:31.159
 what to do that greenish than for the fans 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:33.860
 of the others he turns around but it's not me 

00:02:31.159 --> 00:02:37.810
 like those who look at us we usually do 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:40.730
 but our man is a little injured 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:46.129
 a little broken at the elbow 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:48.049
 you can see both a little injured at 

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:51.019
 elbow that turns losing while the other 

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:57.980
 arm is because it does not go ital right 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:03:00.739
 evening injuries things that are from 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.650
 arrange kids for the rest of culture 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:06.129
 well it pulls well 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:08.170
 other fact video point for completeness 

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:10.269
 you have a massive found music 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.819
 let's see that we put that one 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:16.180
 go jargon too but revolve this 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:21.510
 marilungo can pull out or pass o 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:25.950
 more then we'll see here anyway 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:30.459
 this is fashion is like a little flute 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:32.280
 pines yes that of what they give with 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:35.799
 the collector edition I had done there 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:39.000
 see someone still take 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:42.549
 the game you know the collector edition 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.340
 it comes to the bottle if you take it 

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:51.639
 seas the digital game this 29 euros e 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:54.280
 99 and now on the farming then the name said 

00:03:51.639 --> 00:03:56.409
 on steam it costs less but I always have to 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:59.409
 have the boxes in between 

00:03:56.409 --> 00:04:02.859
 open game and I prefer to have only 

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:08.470
 after for his cabbages 

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:10.959

 to unify it with others, everything and from 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:28.139
