actor like this one here okay so you

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.120 
actor like this one here okay so you
could<00:03:12.880> obviously<00:03:13.240> use<00:03:13.510> the<00:03:13.990> templates<00:03:14.470> the

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.130 
could obviously use the templates the

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:17.009 
could obviously use the templates the
bit<00:03:15.400> comments<00:03:15.790> that<00:03:15.940> we<00:03:16.060> have<00:03:16.180> inside<00:03:16.570> let's

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:17.019 
bit comments that we have inside let's

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:18.750 
bit comments that we have inside let's
say<00:03:17.230> like<00:03:17.500> the<00:03:17.620> blue<00:03:17.769> templates<00:03:18.250> but<00:03:18.640> they

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
say like the blue templates but they

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.610 
say like the blue templates but they
don't<00:03:18.940> really<00:03:19.360> look<00:03:19.690> it<00:03:20.050> looks<00:03:20.320> like<00:03:20.440> he's

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
wearing eye contacts so you can use

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.060 
wearing eye contacts so you can use
Asian<00:03:25.360> design<00:03:25.690> eyes<00:03:26.050> like<00:03:26.440> this<00:03:26.650> one<00:03:26.860> and<00:03:27.040> he
