00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
things have been scaling well we've been

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:20.449 
things have been scaling well we've been
growing<00:02:17.670> exponentially<00:02:18.800> so<00:02:19.800> for<00:02:20.070> example

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
growing exponentially so for example

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:23.210 
growing exponentially so for example
last<00:02:20.640> year<00:02:20.790> we<00:02:20.970> did<00:02:21.090> about<00:02:21.150> 300<00:02:21.780> crores<00:02:22.220> before

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
last year we did about 300 crores before

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.190 
last year we did about 300 crores before
that<00:02:23.310> we<00:02:23.520> did<00:02:23.640> another<00:02:24.120> course<00:02:24.570> before<00:02:24.930> that

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
that we did another course before that

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.979 
that we did another course before that
20<00:02:25.440> or<00:02:25.500> 50<00:02:25.860> and<00:02:26.070> 25<00:02:26.400> and<00:02:26.820> then<00:02:27.000> before<00:02:27.600> that<00:02:27.780> I

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
20 or 50 and 25 and then before that I

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:29.509 
20 or 50 and 25 and then before that I
think<00:02:28.050> we<00:02:28.470> did<00:02:28.620> about<00:02:28.800> five<00:02:28.980> curves<00:02:29.340> and

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:29.519 
think we did about five curves and

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:32.540 
think we did about five curves and
etcetera<00:02:29.760> so<00:02:30.390> that<00:02:30.600> way<00:02:30.800> like<00:02:31.800> last<00:02:32.040> year<00:02:32.250> from

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
etcetera so that way like last year from

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.180 
etcetera so that way like last year from
hundred<00:02:32.880> plus<00:02:33.000> 15<00:02:33.390> 300<00:02:33.959> or<00:02:34.080> we<00:02:34.890> wrote<00:02:35.160> about

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
hundred plus 15 300 or we wrote about

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.300 
hundred plus 15 300 or we wrote about
two<00:02:35.400> and<00:02:35.610> a<00:02:35.670> half<00:02:35.820> times<00:02:36.450> and<00:02:37.230> I<00:02:37.860> think<00:02:38.040> this

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
two and a half times and I think this

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.060 
two and a half times and I think this
year<00:02:38.340> again<00:02:38.760> we<00:02:39.060> probably<00:02:39.360> grow<00:02:39.959> very<00:02:40.200> well

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
year again we probably grow very well

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.070 
year again we probably grow very well
so<00:02:41.730> things<00:02:41.910> are<00:02:42.030> getting<00:02:42.269> better<00:02:42.390> and<00:02:42.780> the

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
so things are getting better and the

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.930 
so things are getting better and the
team<00:02:43.110> size<00:02:43.440> is<00:02:43.620> growing<00:02:43.950> along<00:02:44.250> with<00:02:44.760> the

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
team size is growing along with the

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.210 
team size is growing along with the
business<00:02:45.630> growth<00:02:45.870> right<00:02:46.680> now<00:02:46.709> we<00:02:46.890> should<00:02:46.980> be

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
business growth right now we should be

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.759 
business growth right now we should be
about<00:02:47.370> four<00:02:47.670> four<00:02:48.239> four<00:02:48.690> hundred<00:02:49.080> four

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:49.769 
about four four four hundred four

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:52.070 
about four four four hundred four
hundred<00:02:49.799> and<00:02:50.130> sixty<00:02:50.430> or<00:02:50.519> people<00:02:51.080> tending

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
hundred and sixty or people tending

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.500 
hundred and sixty or people tending
towards<00:02:52.320> five<00:02:52.500> hundred<00:02:52.890> we<00:02:53.820> have<00:02:54.030> offices<00:02:54.390> in

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
towards five hundred we have offices in

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.350 
towards five hundred we have offices in
about<00:02:54.750> twenty<00:02:54.989> six<00:02:55.110> cities<00:02:55.440> in<00:02:55.470> the<00:02:55.650> country

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
about twenty six cities in the country

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.770 
about twenty six cities in the country
yeah<00:02:57.890> and<00:02:58.890> I<00:02:59.280> think<00:02:59.430> what<00:02:59.910> are<00:03:00.030> the<00:03:00.150> challenges

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
yeah and I think what are the challenges

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.229 
yeah and I think what are the challenges
that<00:03:00.810> you<00:03:00.959> face<00:03:01.080> at<00:03:01.500> this<00:03:01.739> point<00:03:02.670> in<00:03:02.820> time<00:03:03.000> and

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
that you face at this point in time and

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:07.280 
that you face at this point in time and
how<00:03:03.720> are<00:03:04.350> you<00:03:04.440> talking<00:03:04.799> them<00:03:05.450> see<00:03:06.450> obvious<00:03:06.959> the

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
how are you talking them see obvious the

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.030 
how are you talking them see obvious the
for<00:03:07.620> us<00:03:07.739> the<00:03:08.400> challenge<00:03:08.760> has<00:03:08.850> been<00:03:08.910> of<00:03:10.040> scaling

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
for us the challenge has been of scaling

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.550 
for us the challenge has been of scaling
up<00:03:11.160> internally<00:03:11.780> because<00:03:12.780> for<00:03:13.290> us<00:03:13.320> the

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
up internally because for us the

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:14.580 
up internally because for us the
advantages<00:03:13.980> that

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
advantages that

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.070 
advantages that
a<00:03:14.620> Texas<00:03:15.069> and<00:03:15.340> it's<00:03:15.459> a<00:03:15.550> huge<00:03:15.730> market<00:03:16.180> and<00:03:16.390> with

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:17.080 
a Texas and it's a huge market and with

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.690 
a Texas and it's a huge market and with
selling<00:03:17.470> about<00:03:17.650> one<00:03:17.830> proceeds<00:03:18.280> there<00:03:18.489> is<00:03:18.610> a

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
selling about one proceeds there is a

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.180 
selling about one proceeds there is a
proof<00:03:18.910> that<00:03:18.940> customers<00:03:19.629> will<00:03:19.900> buy<00:03:20.110> us<00:03:21.010> tickets

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
proof that customers will buy us tickets

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:23.729 
proof that customers will buy us tickets
through<00:03:21.580> these<00:03:22.140> technology<00:03:23.140> edible<00:03:23.410> channels

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:23.739 
through these technology edible channels

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:25.559 
through these technology edible channels
whether<00:03:23.920> it<00:03:24.040> is<00:03:24.160> mobile<00:03:24.340> or<00:03:24.760> call<00:03:24.970> center<00:03:25.180> or

00:03:25.559 --> 00:03:25.569 
whether it is mobile or call center or

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:28.470 
whether it is mobile or call center or
through<00:03:26.170> internet<00:03:26.560> and<00:03:26.590> etc<00:03:26.950> so<00:03:27.519> there<00:03:28.360> is<00:03:28.450> a

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
through internet and etc so there is a

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.059 
through internet and etc so there is a
proof<00:03:28.810> of<00:03:28.930> the<00:03:29.019> concept<00:03:29.230> and<00:03:29.590> there's<00:03:29.769> a<00:03:29.830> huge

00:03:30.059 --> 00:03:30.069 
proof of the concept and there's a huge

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:32.070 
proof of the concept and there's a huge
market<00:03:30.280> in<00:03:30.459> front<00:03:30.760> of<00:03:30.849> us<00:03:31.000> so<00:03:31.510> and<00:03:31.870> we<00:03:32.049> are

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:32.080 
market in front of us so and we are

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:33.960 
market in front of us so and we are
market<00:03:32.410> leaders<00:03:32.440> in<00:03:32.709> that<00:03:32.980> market<00:03:33.340> and<00:03:33.519> we

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
market leaders in that market and we

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:35.789 
market leaders in that market and we
have<00:03:34.150> the<00:03:34.299> whole<00:03:34.450> ecosystem<00:03:34.720> set<00:03:35.260> up<00:03:35.410> which<00:03:35.650> is

00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:35.799 
have the whole ecosystem set up which is

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:37.920 
have the whole ecosystem set up which is
the<00:03:36.040> software<00:03:36.730> focus<00:03:37.060> operators<00:03:37.510> of<00:03:37.629> the<00:03:37.810> free

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
the software focus operators of the free

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:39.360 
the software focus operators of the free
travel<00:03:38.230> agents<00:03:38.500> of<00:03:38.650> therefore<00:03:38.950> consumers

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
travel agents of therefore consumers

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:43.500 
travel agents of therefore consumers
right<00:03:40.209> so<00:03:41.129> we<00:03:42.129> couldn't<00:03:42.340> ask<00:03:42.640> for<00:03:42.879> anything

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:43.510 
right so we couldn't ask for anything

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.289 
right so we couldn't ask for anything
better<00:03:44.010> it<00:03:45.010> I'd<00:03:45.190> be<00:03:45.340> a<00:03:45.370> profitable<00:03:45.790> last<00:03:46.120> year

00:03:46.289 --> 00:03:46.299 
better it I'd be a profitable last year

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:48.030 
better it I'd be a profitable last year
so<00:03:46.599> lot<00:03:46.870> of<00:03:46.959> things<00:03:47.140> going<00:03:47.349> ran<00:03:47.590> fast

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
so lot of things going ran fast

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.250 
so lot of things going ran fast
I<00:03:48.069> think<00:03:48.400> right<00:03:49.150> now<00:03:49.180> the<00:03:49.420> only<00:03:49.660> challenge<00:03:50.170> in

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:50.260 
I think right now the only challenge in

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.650 
I think right now the only challenge in
front<00:03:50.500> of<00:03:50.620> their<00:03:50.799> cells<00:03:51.069> as<00:03:52.060> the<00:03:52.239> companies

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:52.660 
front of their cells as the companies

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.530 
front of their cells as the companies
keeps<00:03:52.930> up<00:03:53.140> power<00:03:53.500> V<00:03:54.160> scaling<00:03:54.549> up<00:03:54.700> how<00:03:55.269> is<00:03:55.450> our

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
keeps up power V scaling up how is our

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.270 
keeps up power V scaling up how is our
teams<00:03:55.840> getting<00:03:56.110> our<00:03:56.349> power<00:03:56.680> of<00:03:56.829> the<00:03:56.920> skill<00:03:57.099> set

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
teams getting our power of the skill set

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.089 
teams getting our power of the skill set
scaling<00:03:57.640> up<00:03:57.790> for<00:03:58.060> example<00:03:58.180> from<00:03:59.110> last<00:03:59.709> year<00:03:59.920> to

00:04:00.089 --> 00:04:00.099 
scaling up for example from last year to

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:01.710 
scaling up for example from last year to
this<00:04:00.129> year<00:04:00.430> let's<00:04:01.000> say<00:04:01.060> when<00:04:01.480> it<00:04:01.569> was<00:04:01.660> a

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:01.720 
this year let's say when it was a

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:04.520 
this year let's say when it was a
hundred<00:04:01.959> per<00:04:02.200> company<00:04:02.440> to<00:04:02.799> 300<00:04:03.160> per<00:04:03.340> company

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
hundred per company to 300 per company

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.500 
hundred per company to 300 per company
just<00:04:05.530> at<00:04:05.680> 12<00:04:06.010> months<00:04:06.220> I<00:04:06.579> have<00:04:06.910> to<00:04:07.030> scale<00:04:07.299> up

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
just at 12 months I have to scale up

every time we believe that mentors and

00:07:22.979 --> 00:07:25.129 
every time we believe that mentors and
investors<00:07:23.099> are<00:07:23.759> with<00:07:24.210> us<00:07:24.449> and<00:07:24.690> helping<00:07:25.020> us

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:37.050 
board members I would say that if there

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:38.809 
board members I would say that if there
were<00:07:37.139> a<00:07:37.169> lot<00:07:37.319> of<00:07:37.409> importance<00:07:37.889> because<00:07:38.370> they

00:07:38.809 --> 00:07:38.819 
were a lot of importance because they

00:07:38.819 --> 00:07:40.450 
were a lot of importance because they
are<00:07:38.880> people<00:07:39.120> who've<00:07:39.360> been<00:07:39.539> there<00:07:39.780> done<00:07:40.080> it<00:07:40.110> all

are people who've been there done it all

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:44.570 
are people who've been there done it all
