00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.409 

you<00:00:01.050> just<00:00:01.230> want<00:00:01.439> to<00:00:01.530> start<00:00:01.740> with<00:00:01.949> the<00:00:02.070> bagger

00:00:02.409 --> 00:00:02.419 
you just want to start with the bagger

00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:04.519 
you just want to start with the bagger
collection<00:00:03.419> of<00:00:03.510> bags<00:00:03.720> so<00:00:04.110> when<00:00:04.230> you<00:00:04.290> get<00:00:04.440> the

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:04.529 
collection of bags so when you get the

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:06.019 
collection of bags so when you get the
bags<00:00:04.740> they're<00:00:05.009> probably<00:00:05.190> going<00:00:05.400> to<00:00:05.460> look<00:00:05.609> like

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
bags they're probably going to look like

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:08.690 
bags they're probably going to look like
this<00:00:06.210> so<00:00:06.560> what<00:00:07.560> we'll<00:00:07.710> need<00:00:07.830> to<00:00:07.890> do<00:00:08.160> to<00:00:08.519> be<00:00:08.610> able

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
this so what we'll need to do to be able

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.180 
this so what we'll need to do to be able
to<00:00:08.880> cut<00:00:09.059> them<00:00:09.150> into<00:00:09.300> strips<00:00:09.800> they<00:00:10.800> still<00:00:11.040> have

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
to cut them into strips they still have

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.039 
to cut them into strips they still have
to<00:00:11.309> iron<00:00:11.519> it<00:00:11.759> out<00:00:11.910> sort<00:00:12.300> of<00:00:12.360> with<00:00:12.509> your<00:00:12.660> hands

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
to iron it out sort of with your hands

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:14.749 
to iron it out sort of with your hands
well<00:00:13.230> I<00:00:13.290> found<00:00:13.530> the<00:00:13.710> easiest<00:00:13.740> way<00:00:14.280> to<00:00:14.309> do<00:00:14.519> it<00:00:14.639> is

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
well I found the easiest way to do it is

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.160 
well I found the easiest way to do it is
to<00:00:14.880> put<00:00:14.910> my<00:00:15.150> finger<00:00:15.480> in<00:00:15.570> this<00:00:15.660> pleat<00:00:15.960> right

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
to put my finger in this pleat right

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.160 
to put my finger in this pleat right
here<00:00:16.440> and<00:00:16.830> use<00:00:17.130> the<00:00:17.310> handle<00:00:17.930> straight<00:00:18.930> them

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
here and use the handle straight them

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:19.910 
here and use the handle straight them
out<00:00:19.289> like<00:00:19.500> that

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
out like that

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.910 
out like that
and<00:00:20.070> then<00:00:20.220> you'll<00:00:20.340> just<00:00:20.369> pull<00:00:20.760> the<00:00:20.910> tips<00:00:21.180> and

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:21.920 
and then you'll just pull the tips and

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.900 
and then you'll just pull the tips and
just<00:00:22.920> kind<00:00:23.160> of<00:00:23.220> iron<00:00:23.460> them<00:00:23.609> out<00:00:23.730> like<00:00:24.029> this<00:00:25.910> so

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
just kind of iron them out like this so

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.560 
just kind of iron them out like this so
then<00:00:27.090> you<00:00:27.269> just<00:00:27.300> fold<00:00:27.779> it<00:00:27.930> over<00:00:28.640> one<00:00:29.640> time<00:00:30.000> and

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
then you just fold it over one time and

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.740 
then you just fold it over one time and
then<00:00:31.260> again<00:00:31.529> and<00:00:32.430> because<00:00:33.390> we're<00:00:33.570> going<00:00:33.690> to

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
then again and because we're going to

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.410 
then again and because we're going to
use<00:00:33.809> these<00:00:34.170> bags<00:00:34.500> two<00:00:34.829> cuts<00:00:35.130> like<00:00:35.610> loops<00:00:36.059> we

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
use these bags two cuts like loops we

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.090 
use these bags two cuts like loops we
have<00:00:36.600> to<00:00:36.719> cut<00:00:36.960> off<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.350> seam<00:00:37.620> on<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:37.950> bottom

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
have to cut off the seam on the bottom

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.340 
have to cut off the seam on the bottom
because<00:00:38.550> it's<00:00:38.700> not<00:00:38.879> usable<00:00:39.239> and<00:00:39.899> nor<00:00:40.170> on<00:00:40.320> the

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
because it's not usable and nor on the

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:41.690 
because it's not usable and nor on the
handles<00:00:40.890> so<00:00:41.010> you<00:00:41.160> have<00:00:41.280> to<00:00:41.399> cut<00:00:41.550> off<00:00:41.670> the

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
handles so you have to cut off the

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.740 
handles so you have to cut off the
handles<00:00:42.270> here<00:00:43.129> and<00:00:44.129> I<00:00:44.219> keep<00:00:44.430> one<00:00:44.760> bag<00:00:45.000> of<00:00:45.030> just

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
handles here and I keep one bag of just

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.260 
handles here and I keep one bag of just
the<00:00:45.989> scraps<00:00:46.350> and<00:00:47.100> you<00:00:47.309> stuff<00:00:47.610> those<00:00:47.820> in<00:00:48.030> there

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
the scraps and you stuff those in there

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.260 
the scraps and you stuff those in there
and<00:00:48.719> then<00:00:48.780> I<00:00:49.140> make<00:00:49.289> a<00:00:49.320> trip<00:00:49.739> to<00:00:49.879> Publix<00:00:50.879> I<00:00:51.059> just

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
and then I make a trip to Publix I just

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.049 
and then I make a trip to Publix I just
put<00:00:51.449> those<00:00:51.600> back<00:00:51.840> in<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:52.020> recycling<00:00:52.590> bin

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:53.059 
put those back in the recycling bin

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:55.160 
put those back in the recycling bin
so<00:00:54.059> they're<00:00:54.180> not<00:00:54.300> wasted<00:00:54.690> in<00:00:54.809> I'm<00:00:54.899> harness

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
so they're not wasted in I'm harness

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.680 
attraction so typical grocery bag you
can<00:00:59.190> make<00:00:59.309> about<00:00:59.430> ten<00:00:59.820> strips<00:01:00.239> on<00:01:00.420> them<00:01:00.570> at

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
can make about ten strips on them at

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.209 
can make about ten strips on them at
about<00:01:00.780> maybe<00:01:01.140> little<00:01:01.620> over<00:01:01.800> an<00:01:01.890> inch<00:01:01.980> or<00:01:02.190> so

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
about maybe little over an inch or so

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.440 
about maybe little over an inch or so
wide<00:01:04.400> the<00:01:05.400> thick<00:01:05.640> of<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.850> plastic<00:01:06.299> though

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
wide the thick of the plastic though

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.030 
wide the thick of the plastic though
they've<00:01:06.659> been<00:01:06.689> on<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.080> strip<00:01:07.470> because<00:01:07.710> it's

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
they've been on the strip because it's

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.679 
they've been on the strip because it's
too<00:01:08.280> much<00:01:08.310> of<00:01:08.490> work<00:01:08.760> with<00:01:09.000> that<00:01:09.150> it's<00:01:09.390> really

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
too much of work with that it's really

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:16.160 
too much of work with that it's really
wide<00:01:09.900> so<00:01:13.580> after<00:01:14.580> several<00:01:15.030> of<00:01:15.119> those<00:01:15.299> bags<00:01:15.689> will

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
wide so after several of those bags will

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.800 
wide so after several of those bags will
have<00:01:16.380> hundreds<00:01:16.950> of<00:01:17.100> strips<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:17.820> what<00:01:18.090> I<00:01:18.270> do<00:01:18.420> is

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
have hundreds of strips and what I do is

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.350 
have hundreds of strips and what I do is
keep<00:01:19.080> them<00:01:20.900> in<00:01:21.900> a<00:01:22.049> separate<00:01:22.530> bag<00:01:22.680> and<00:01:23.670> when<00:01:24.299> I

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
keep them in a separate bag and when I

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.420 
keep them in a separate bag and when I
get<00:01:24.540> ready<00:01:24.720> to<00:01:24.810> make<00:01:24.960> a<00:01:25.020> big<00:01:25.200> ball<00:01:25.439> of<00:01:25.590> yarn<00:01:26.100> I

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
get ready to make a big ball of yarn I

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:27.100 
get ready to make a big ball of yarn I
just<00:01:26.700> don't

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
just don't

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.610 
just don't
and<00:01:27.200> I'll<00:01:27.350> start<00:01:28.250> with<00:01:28.460> them<00:01:28.640> yep<00:01:29.530> so<00:01:30.530> when

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:30.620 
and I'll start with them yep so when

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:31.840 
and I'll start with them yep so when
you're<00:01:30.740> ready<00:01:30.890> to<00:01:30.980> make<00:01:31.130> the<00:01:31.250> yarn<00:01:31.460> you<00:01:31.670> just

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 
you're ready to make the yarn you just

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.550 
you're ready to make the yarn you just
take<00:01:32.060> the<00:01:32.210> loops<00:01:33.580> and<00:01:34.630> slip<00:01:35.630> one<00:01:35.900> into<00:01:36.410> the

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
take the loops and slip one into the

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.690 
take the loops and slip one into the
other<00:01:37.030> slip<00:01:38.030> one<00:01:38.210> loop<00:01:39.040> into<00:01:40.040> this<00:01:40.190> one<00:01:40.400> and

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
other slip one loop into this one and

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.930 
other slip one loop into this one and
then<00:01:41.690> back<00:01:41.870> through<00:01:42.140> itself<00:01:42.700> to<00:01:43.700> tie<00:01:43.880> it

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:43.940 
then back through itself to tie it

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.060 
then back through itself to tie it
together<00:01:44.530> you<00:01:45.530> want<00:01:45.710> to<00:01:45.770> pull<00:01:45.890> it<00:01:45.980> a<00:01:46.040> little

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
together you want to pull it a little

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:47.620 
together you want to pull it a little
top<00:01:46.430> but<00:01:46.610> not<00:01:46.760> too<00:01:46.940> much<00:01:47.060> because<00:01:47.210> they<00:01:47.450> won't

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
top but not too much because they won't

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.110 
top but not too much because they won't
break<00:01:47.750> pretty<00:01:47.990> easily<00:01:48.580> so<00:01:49.580> you<00:01:49.640> just<00:01:49.880> slip

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:50.120 
break pretty easily so you just slip

00:01:50.120 --> 00:02:17.080 
break pretty easily so you just slip
several<00:01:50.570> pieces<00:01:50.750> together

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.540 

so<00:02:18.090> what<00:02:18.300> was<00:02:18.480> that<00:02:18.690> that<00:02:19.590> I<00:02:19.920> split<00:02:20.250> it<00:02:20.280> but<00:02:20.490> I

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
so what was that that I split it but I

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.460 
so what was that that I split it but I
pulled<00:02:20.850> it<00:02:20.970> too<00:02:21.150> tight<00:02:21.420> so<00:02:21.450> I<00:02:21.960> tied<00:02:22.230> another

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
pulled it too tight so I tied another

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.230 
pulled it too tight so I tied another
small<00:02:22.830> loop<00:02:23.220> on<00:02:23.430> there<00:02:23.610> so<00:02:23.790> I<00:02:23.880> could<00:02:24.030> still

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
small loop on there so I could still

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.840 
small loop on there so I could still
utilize<00:02:24.660> it<00:02:25.160> and<00:02:26.160> then<00:02:26.280> when<00:02:26.370> I<00:02:26.400> get<00:02:26.520> to<00:02:26.640> this

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:26.850 
utilize it and then when I get to this

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:28.580 
utilize it and then when I get to this
part<00:02:27.150> of<00:02:27.300> the<00:02:27.390> yarn<00:02:27.660> when<00:02:27.930> I'm<00:02:28.050> weaving<00:02:28.230> it<00:02:28.470> in

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
part of the yarn when I'm weaving it in

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:29.930 
part of the yarn when I'm weaving it in
and<00:02:28.710> I'll<00:02:28.770> just<00:02:28.950> sweep<00:02:29.160> this<00:02:29.310> day<00:02:29.520> like<00:02:29.760> then

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
and I'll just sweep this day like then

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.020 
and I'll just sweep this day like then
and<00:02:29.970> it<00:02:30.180> gives<00:02:30.360> it<00:02:30.480> just<00:02:30.510> a<00:02:30.720> little<00:02:30.810> extra

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
and it gives it just a little extra

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:39.560 
and it gives it just a little extra
reinforcement<00:02:37.730> so<00:02:38.730> you<00:02:38.790> have<00:02:39.030> a<00:02:39.060> big<00:02:39.270> pile<00:02:39.540> of

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
reinforcement so you have a big pile of

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.270 
reinforcement so you have a big pile of
this<00:02:39.900> and<00:02:40.230> basically<00:02:40.410> my<00:02:40.740> name<00:02:40.980> is<00:02:41.100> just

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
this and basically my name is just

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.850 
this and basically my name is just
rolled<00:02:41.490> up<00:02:41.610> like<00:02:41.670> you<00:02:41.910> would<00:02:42.410> you<00:02:43.410> know<00:02:43.560> some

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
rolled up like you would you know some

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:51.210 
rolled up like you would you know some
some<00:02:44.400> yarn<00:02:44.670> just<00:02:44.940> make<00:02:45.150> a<00:02:45.180> big<00:02:45.390> ball<00:02:45.600> out<00:02:45.840> of<00:02:45.930> it

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:58.030 

then<00:02:52.220> you<00:02:52.340> wanted<00:02:52.549> up<00:02:52.730> with<00:02:53.530> that's<00:02:54.530> the<00:02:57.040> the

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
then you wanted up with that's the the

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.800 
then you wanted up with that's the the
hardest<00:02:58.310> part<00:02:58.579> about<00:02:58.670> this<00:02:59.060> probably<00:02:59.450> is

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
hardest part about this probably is

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.270 
hardest part about this probably is
starting<00:03:00.500> to<00:03:00.680> change<00:03:00.709> that<00:03:01.549> is<00:03:02.860> the<00:03:03.860> beginning

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
starting to change that is the beginning

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.140 
starting to change that is the beginning
of<00:03:04.640> the<00:03:05.769> beginning<00:03:06.769> of<00:03:07.159> the<00:03:07.280> payroll<00:03:07.670> itself

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
of the beginning of the payroll itself

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:14.949 
of the beginning of the payroll itself
is<00:03:08.450> a<00:03:10.030> single<00:03:11.030> chain<00:03:13.000> crochet<00:03:14.000> one<00:03:14.450> one<00:03:14.689> stitch

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
is a single chain crochet one one stitch

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:16.330 
is a single chain crochet one one stitch
if<00:03:15.109> that<00:03:15.230> makes<00:03:15.409> sense<00:03:15.470> I<00:03:15.739> think<00:03:15.920> I<00:03:15.980> explained

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
if that makes sense I think I explained

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:17.800 
if that makes sense I think I explained
that<00:03:16.579> correctly<00:03:17.030> this<00:03:17.269> was<00:03:17.510> the<00:03:17.659> beginning

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:17.810 
that correctly this was the beginning

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:19.300 
that correctly this was the beginning
stitch<00:03:18.260> and<00:03:18.500> in<00:03:18.560> the<00:03:18.590> second<00:03:18.980> row<00:03:19.069> and<00:03:19.250> now

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
stitch and in the second row and now

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:20.710 
stitch and in the second row and now
here's<00:03:19.549> the<00:03:19.700> third<00:03:19.879> row<00:03:20.000> I'm<00:03:20.120> working<00:03:20.420> on<00:03:20.480> that

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
here's the third row I'm working on that

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.440 
here's the third row I'm working on that
so<00:03:21.560> if<00:03:21.950> you're<00:03:22.129> not<00:03:22.250> experienced<00:03:22.849> with<00:03:22.909> single

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
so if you're not experienced with single

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:24.879 
so if you're not experienced with single
crochet<00:03:23.810> stitch<00:03:24.049> I<00:03:24.200> suggest<00:03:24.590> you<00:03:24.680> start

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:24.889 
crochet stitch I suggest you start

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:27.460 
crochet stitch I suggest you start
practicing<00:03:25.459> with<00:03:25.489> some<00:03:26.060> yarn<00:03:26.480> and<00:03:27.260> go<00:03:27.290> on

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
practicing with some yarn and go on

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:29.559 
practicing with some yarn and go on
YouTube<00:03:27.829> and<00:03:28.069> see<00:03:28.220> how<00:03:28.340> to<00:03:28.400> do<00:03:29.239> a<00:03:29.269> slip<00:03:29.540> knot

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:29.569 
YouTube and see how to do a slip knot

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:31.539 
YouTube and see how to do a slip knot
and<00:03:29.900> do<00:03:29.959> a<00:03:29.989> first<00:03:30.260> chain<00:03:30.530> on<00:03:30.560> it's<00:03:31.069> very<00:03:31.129> simple

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:31.549 
and do a first chain on it's very simple

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:33.369 
and do a first chain on it's very simple
but<00:03:32.209> after<00:03:32.420> you<00:03:32.480> get<00:03:32.569> started<00:03:32.959> it<00:03:33.049> goes<00:03:33.170> quite

00:03:33.369 --> 00:03:33.379 
but after you get started it goes quite

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:37.119 
but after you get started it goes quite
quite<00:03:33.739> quickly<00:03:33.950> so<00:03:35.500> you<00:03:36.500> want<00:03:36.680> to<00:03:36.739> make<00:03:36.889> them

00:03:37.119 --> 00:03:37.129 
quite quickly so you want to make them

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:39.520 
quite quickly so you want to make them
probably<00:03:37.700> three<00:03:38.120> feet<00:03:38.329> wide<00:03:38.599> by<00:03:38.900> six<00:03:39.290> feet

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
probably three feet wide by six feet

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:42.250 
probably three feet wide by six feet
long<00:03:39.590> if<00:03:40.250> you're<00:03:40.489> using<00:03:40.730> them<00:03:41.030> for<00:03:41.090> bed<00:03:42.019> mats

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
long if you're using them for bed mats

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.379 
long if you're using them for bed mats
you<00:03:42.590> could<00:03:43.159> make<00:03:43.310> them<00:03:43.549> shorter<00:03:44.030> if<00:03:44.150> you<00:03:44.269> were

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:44.389 
you could make them shorter if you were

00:03:44.389 --> 00:03:45.550 
you could make them shorter if you were
just<00:03:44.540> going<00:03:44.659> to<00:03:44.689> use<00:03:44.840> them<00:03:44.989> for<00:03:45.019> like<00:03:45.290> sitting

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
just going to use them for like sitting

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.319 
just going to use them for like sitting
pads<00:03:45.889> or<00:03:46.250> like<00:03:46.400> Boy<00:03:46.579> Scouts<00:03:46.609> or<00:03:47.060> something

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:47.329 
pads or like Boy Scouts or something

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:49.420 
pads or like Boy Scouts or something
like<00:03:47.420> that<00:03:47.480> but<00:03:48.290> for<00:03:48.349> an<00:03:48.530> actual<00:03:48.769> mat<00:03:49.099> to<00:03:49.310> go

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
like that but for an actual mat to go

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.210 
like that but for an actual mat to go
under<00:03:49.819> this<00:03:50.599> someone's<00:03:50.989> blankets<00:03:51.950> on<00:03:52.129> the

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.220 
under this someone's blankets on the

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:53.800 
under this someone's blankets on the
street<00:03:52.549> you<00:03:52.730> would<00:03:52.879> probably<00:03:53.209> want<00:03:53.239> on<00:03:53.480> three

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
street you would probably want on three

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:55.659 
street you would probably want on three
feet<00:03:54.049> wide<00:03:54.079> at<00:03:54.500> least<00:03:54.680> by<00:03:54.859> six<00:03:55.069> feet<00:03:55.280> long

00:03:55.659 --> 00:03:55.669 
feet wide at least by six feet long

00:03:55.669 --> 00:03:58.420 
feet wide at least by six feet long
so<00:03:55.940> you<00:03:56.030> just<00:03:56.269> chain<00:03:56.540> on<00:03:56.949> and<00:03:57.949> let<00:03:58.069> it<00:03:58.129> sit<00:03:58.280> do<00:03:58.400> a

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
so you just chain on and let it sit do a

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:07.660 
so you just chain on and let it sit do a
single<00:03:58.819> stitch<00:04:00.579> and<00:04:01.579> just<00:04:01.609> graduate

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:07.670 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:12.140 

to<00:04:08.670> join<00:04:09.360> it<00:04:09.480> better<00:04:09.660> all<00:04:09.810> like<00:04:09.959> this<00:04:11.150> this

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
to join it better all like this this

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:13.790 
to join it better all like this this
one's<00:04:12.360> almost<00:04:12.510> finished<00:04:12.959> so<00:04:13.380> I<00:04:13.440> say<00:04:13.650> it's<00:04:13.770> a

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:13.800 
one's almost finished so I say it's a

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.050 
one's almost finished so I say it's a
little<00:04:14.010> slow<00:04:14.220> going<00:04:14.550> when<00:04:14.700> you're<00:04:14.760> working

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
little slow going when you're working

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:16.550 
little slow going when you're working
with<00:04:15.150> a<00:04:15.180> small<00:04:15.510> piece<00:04:15.690> like<00:04:15.930> this<00:04:16.109> because

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
with a small piece like this because

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.640 
with a small piece like this because
it's<00:04:17.489> hard<00:04:17.579> to<00:04:17.790> handle<00:04:18.060> but<00:04:18.389> once<00:04:18.720> it's<00:04:18.959> you

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
it's hard to handle but once it's you

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.039 
it's hard to handle but once it's you
know<00:04:19.769> seven<00:04:20.250> or<00:04:20.310> eight<00:04:20.430> rows<00:04:20.760> long<00:04:21.120> rows

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
know seven or eight rows long rows

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:24.590 
know seven or eight rows long rows
yeah<00:04:22.950> rows<00:04:23.220> long<00:04:23.490> then<00:04:23.820> it's<00:04:23.970> much<00:04:24.090> easier<00:04:24.150> to

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600 
yeah rows long then it's much easier to

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.230 
yeah rows long then it's much easier to
handle<00:04:25.200> and<00:04:25.410> it<00:04:25.560> goes<00:04:25.710> very<00:04:25.980> quickly<00:04:26.280> so<00:04:27.180> I

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
handle and it goes very quickly so I

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:31.220 
handle and it goes very quickly so I
have<00:04:27.389> probably<00:04:29.570> probably<00:04:30.570> four<00:04:30.870> or<00:04:30.900> five<00:04:30.960> more

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:31.230 
have probably probably four or five more

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:34.070 
have probably probably four or five more
rows<00:04:31.350> on<00:04:31.560> this<00:04:31.710> one<00:04:31.889> it's<00:04:32.370> completely<00:04:33.080> I'll

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 
rows on this one it's completely I'll

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:43.340 
rows on this one it's completely I'll
show<00:04:34.230> you<00:04:34.320> how<00:04:34.410> long<00:04:34.590> it<00:04:34.710> is<00:04:41.450> so<00:04:42.450> what<00:04:42.960> I<00:04:42.990> do<00:04:43.080> is

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:43.350 
show you how long it is so what I do is

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:44.690 
show you how long it is so what I do is
I<00:04:43.470> need<00:04:43.590> to<00:04:43.710> just<00:04:43.860> work<00:04:44.040> on<00:04:44.160> the<00:04:44.250> lines<00:04:44.430> sitting
