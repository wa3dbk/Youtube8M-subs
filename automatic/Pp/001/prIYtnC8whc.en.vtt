00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:14.000

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:16.460
 required for the operation of their 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.470
 trade establishments then 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.539
 during an evaluation conducted this 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:23.600
 weekend to the nightclubs of the 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:26.810
 city a large percentage of these are 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:28.490
 They cracked the exam if I said it for 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.680
 for now, but we can say that 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:32.170
 we are in a 100 in a rating 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.250
 of 7 because we have found 

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:35.780
 establishments that does not have the 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.730
 regulations that do not comply with the use 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.780
 of the soil and ones that are short in the 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.120
 signage for evacuation 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.100
 extinguished extinguishers lack of 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.620
 signage as well as good departures from 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:48.649
 emergencies are the constant in some 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:51.680
 night rumba sites of cali este 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:53.150
 type of connections in which you should not 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.400
 do 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:59.140
 of being previously channeled there is a 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.140
 channel that is not being used 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.489
 unite such is one of travel 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.000
 can fortunately no more than 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.710
 which has nearby 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.580
 suddenly they were always 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.710
 coatings 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.510
 but I'm not going to do that 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.950
 however, the vast majority of 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:19.420
 night businessmen showed up 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.820
 receptive to the rules of 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.800
 security and they agreed to abide by 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.020
 Well, the truth seems very good 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.670
 for reasons then for clients to 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.560
 the security so that everyone is 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.690
 well that rumba is healthy and nothing happens to him 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.490
 For security reasons, it seems very good to me 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:35.350
 what are they doing and of course I have 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.240
 a lot of desire in that people because 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.550
 to what happened there we have conscious 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.250
 what one thing happened to him and that all of us 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.899
 let's join so that we act 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:45.940
 establishments as required 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:48.039
 by firefighters by government by 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:49.509
 police whatever we are aware of 

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:51.700
 that and that people collaborate with everything 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:53.530
 this I see it very viable these measures 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.630
 they are adopted by the municipal administration 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.000
 after the tragedy that happened in brazil 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.490
 where 232 people lost their lives 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.250
 and after a fire that was registered 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.649
 in a nightclub where 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.659
 fortune there were no victims a 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:09.640
 call for attention so that they 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:11.590
 enter waist and understand that the 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.310
 human life is very precious and that is the 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.310
 that we have to take care of
