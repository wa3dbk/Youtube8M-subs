00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:05.609
 hello people and welcome to one 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:08.940
 others had to be yes and indeed 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:11.550
 Anyway, today we are at the minimap v2 anyway 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:16.260
 not that's from epic brothers who has 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:19.320
 that is made my card looks like that 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.330
 nice but does not do anything so am 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.220
 At the beginning you only have 12,000 and you have 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.740
 not a single vehicle that means me 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.599
 can still get in here if he is up 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.970
 We have no other vehicle 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:34.230
 nothing we have 12,000 on construction 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:37.890
 and nothing else there a bit 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:40.910
 important sometime was there in front 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.910
 the cow pasture right away 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:51.350
 The ups whitewash the whole aimlessly 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:56.000
 traffic 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:57.920
 yes that was it already here I have 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.340
 first briefly the doors like this 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.340
 appearance 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:11.810
 I'm interested are so small 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:14.180
 you can apply 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:18.680
 I think again 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.680
 and since had a round here on 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:24.990
 I told you a little bit not very big 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.990
 that's why they are minimal 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:33.920
 just out 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:37.570
 now also at gas stations then 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.570
 Let's just go the direction 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:45.500
 it is not so nice but also well 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:47.509
 yes not so bad but here are 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:53.440
 just re-appraised that too 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:53.440
 good on here grass on the ground we here 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:02:03.850
 directly and what do we have there yet 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:03.850
 nice lots of trees 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:14.090
 and here is then empty suddenly ok 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:17.200
 then you would actually have the mountains 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:21.490
 can directly grain 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:25.000
 so that this is not endless in poland 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:26.560
 I'm doing all this quasi the road is 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.600
 not so nice out of time 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:33.550
 you should be realistic, maybe better 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:36.570
 edit we were still fast times 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.570
 along a path 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.250
 also in the field 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:52.270
 the ferry is just about all 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:55.750
 that you can harvest so beautifully 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:03:05.300
 almost even too good in my opinion 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:08.720
 some go just too shallow fields would 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:11.239
 I saw it so grossly and completely 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.580
 is there just the small yard because she is 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:17.540
 nice kept small gives a few 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:19.069
 smaller fields was large error as 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:22.910
 said at the beginning you have to stop with 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:26.299
 Credit only has 12,000 and 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:27.950
 you have no no vehicle and then 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:29.660
 I would say that was it until the 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:33.099
 next to the next presentation 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:33.099
 until then it's good
