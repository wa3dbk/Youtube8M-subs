00:00:15.279 --> 00:00:16.199
 period 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.150
 so in the end 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.699
 a period of a bit of 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:21.829
 of everything 

00:00:21.829 --> 00:00:23.359

 As for Israel, it was removed from the mix venue that I made 

00:00:27.649 --> 00:00:29.689

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.580
 I do not know if I'll be 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.730
 we are worried and sad as a basis to remember to blur very well because 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.580
 if it is not asked 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.310
 other 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:04.310
 moralito 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.850
 efe 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:10.740
 and other 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.740
 the color is 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.170
 drug jo 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.160
 dark Rose 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.160
 I like these costumes a lot 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:28.660
 these other two 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:31.140
 I did not like anything 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.560
 I thought I thought I would paint 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.100
 the judge this one 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.360
 moraíto co 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.360
 and there it is 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:43.260
 it's transparent 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.050
 I do not know if you see it up there 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.050
 vilorio that leaves is 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.040
 and this other judge art the so many of it 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.960
 I thought it would be green 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.170
 it is normal Vaseline color 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:04.470
 with that 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:06.100
 yes at least 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.359
 the green glitter 

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:13.930
 so who percent of this collection of the scientist I will not buy 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.239
 none 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:18.919
 and instead of these normal colored hotels 

00:02:18.919 --> 00:02:21.519
 I'm going to buy it because 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:24.179
 I liked it a lot 

00:02:24.179 --> 00:02:27.179

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.509
 with winds of videos 

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:32.860
 short videos 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.379

00:02:41.179 --> 00:02:43.219
 of the century 

00:02:43.219 --> 00:02:44.529
 this palette 

00:02:44.529 --> 00:02:45.589

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:04.719
 the shakhtar 

00:03:04.719 --> 00:03:07.459
 of lares for that instead of crimes 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:08.949

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:21.359
 but he regrets that he would have nothing 

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:25.400
 if the potassium presses and also that the charges 

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:28.479
 compare example 

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:31.859
 but this palette is a palette of watercolors 

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:34.339
 of the 110 hectares 

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:36.349

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:41.249
 resolved 

00:03:41.249 --> 00:03:43.249
 and now that I'm 40 

00:03:43.249 --> 00:03:44.340
 well go cloth 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.409

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:48.889

00:03:48.889 --> 00:03:50.469
 let's go with him 

00:03:50.469 --> 00:03:51.869

00:03:51.869 --> 00:03:55.329
 in fact the batch day gives a week 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:59.459
 and it has come to me I think that in fact I arrived on Friday 

00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:01.840
 but I could not pass 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.199

00:04:13.929 --> 00:04:16.929
 one for correct 

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:20.079
 under a temporary 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:23.389
 that the name 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:27.289
 I did not like it very much because even for the plane's correct 

00:04:27.849 --> 00:04:30.520
 a tough one 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.020
 impec and is not too big 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:35.020

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.629
 according to the experts for nadal 

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:40.629

00:04:47.849 --> 00:04:50.499

00:04:50.499 --> 00:04:53.499
 What are the little sponges that come in the pallet 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.879
 of that I prefer eyes 

00:04:56.879 --> 00:04:58.389
 if not 

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:00.259
 if you win 

00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:01.789
 this tour and such 

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:05.789
 paradis fumigate when you do an outline 

00:05:08.169 --> 00:05:10.020
 without specifying details 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.150
 I think it will go well 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:15.180
 I have this style but 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:16.930
 tougher 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:19.960
 so try this up latitas 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:22.979

00:05:25.719 --> 00:05:28.969
 that is blurred 

00:05:28.969 --> 00:05:32.319
 the hair is shorter than the ones I have for example 

00:05:32.319 --> 00:05:34.800
 highlight this demand 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.710
 it is clear that 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:38.839
 it's shorter 

00:05:38.839 --> 00:05:41.839
 all for example 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:46.110
 that has been present in all 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:49.110
 that this other deliplus is also shorter hair 

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:53.580
 we are doing very well even if they are free 

00:05:56.659 --> 00:05:59.659
 they go pretty well this aunt is very soft 

00:06:00.199 --> 00:06:02.369

00:06:02.369 --> 00:06:05.199

00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:07.699
 everything ended in divorce 

00:06:07.699 --> 00:06:10.369
 I have a friend who called me flatts 

00:06:10.369 --> 00:06:13.180
 so nothing I think they know very well 

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:15.650
 I asked for those three nights 

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:17.759

00:06:25.559 --> 00:06:26.740
 nerves 

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:28.169
 I believe 

00:06:28.169 --> 00:06:30.129
 and if it was an agreement soon 

00:06:30.129 --> 00:06:33.089
