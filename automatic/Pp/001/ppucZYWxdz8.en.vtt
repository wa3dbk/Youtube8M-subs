00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.050 

and<00:00:00.089> now<00:00:00.780> it's<00:00:01.050> time<00:00:01.350> for<00:00:01.650> the<00:00:01.680> twisty<00:00:02.370> trials

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:03.060 
and now it's time for the twisty trials

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.710 
and now it's time for the twisty trials
galaxy<00:00:04.490> which<00:00:05.490> might<00:00:05.910> seem<00:00:06.180> kind<00:00:06.569> of

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
galaxy which might seem kind of

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.080 
galaxy which might seem kind of
difficult<00:00:07.290> but<00:00:07.589> in<00:00:07.830> reality<00:00:08.040> it's<00:00:08.700> rather

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
difficult but in reality it's rather

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.310 
difficult but in reality it's rather
simple<00:00:09.510> I<00:00:10.670> only<00:00:11.670> died<00:00:11.880> once<00:00:11.910> on<00:00:12.480> this<00:00:12.660> galaxy

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
simple I only died once on this galaxy

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.279 
simple I only died once on this galaxy
so<00:00:13.769> if<00:00:14.670> I<00:00:14.880> can<00:00:15.089> beat<00:00:15.240> this<00:00:15.389> galaxy<00:00:15.960> on<00:00:16.080> my

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
so if I can beat this galaxy on my

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:31.910 
so if I can beat this galaxy on my
second<00:00:16.800> try<00:00:17.070> it<00:00:17.820> can<00:00:18.060> be<00:00:18.270> too<00:00:18.720> difficult<00:00:19.050> right

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.700 

the<00:00:32.920> trick<00:00:33.370> to<00:00:33.400> this<00:00:33.700> galaxy<00:00:34.420> is<00:00:34.750> that<00:00:35.380> the

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:35.710 
the trick to this galaxy is that the

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.680 
the trick to this galaxy is that the
platforms<00:00:36.550> are<00:00:36.760> always<00:00:37.420> spinning<00:00:39.690> that's

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:40.690 
platforms are always spinning that's

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:43.290 
platforms are always spinning that's
basically<00:00:41.560> it<00:00:41.739> the<00:00:42.070> platforms<00:00:42.730> are<00:00:42.850> always

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:43.300 
basically it the platforms are always

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.720 
basically it the platforms are always
spinning<00:00:43.739> so<00:00:44.739> you<00:00:44.830> want<00:00:45.070> to<00:00:45.190> jump<00:00:45.460> from

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:45.730 
spinning so you want to jump from

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:47.400 
spinning so you want to jump from
platform<00:00:46.360> the<00:00:46.450> platform<00:00:46.480> and<00:00:47.080> get<00:00:47.230> through

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:47.410 
platform the platform and get through

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.340 
platform the platform and get through
this<00:00:47.500> area<00:00:47.830> and<00:00:48.670> you<00:00:49.270> want<00:00:49.449> to<00:00:49.570> run<00:00:49.809> from<00:00:50.110> one

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:50.350 
this area and you want to run from one

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.750 
this area and you want to run from one
side<00:00:50.710> of<00:00:50.739> the<00:00:50.980> platform<00:00:51.220> to<00:00:51.820> the<00:00:51.850> other<00:00:53.760> for

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:54.760 
side of the platform to the other for

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.729 
side of the platform to the other for
example<00:00:55.180> here<00:00:55.210> I<00:00:55.510> am<00:00:55.780> running<00:00:56.080> to<00:00:56.230> the<00:00:56.470> right

00:00:56.729 --> 00:00:56.739 
example here I am running to the right

00:00:56.739 --> 00:00:59.400 
example here I am running to the right
so<00:00:57.220> I<00:00:57.250> will<00:00:57.520> still<00:00:58.030> be<00:00:58.480> on<00:00:58.720> top<00:00:59.110> of<00:00:59.320> the

00:00:59.400 --> 00:00:59.410 
so I will still be on top of the

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:01.619 
so I will still be on top of the
platform<00:00:59.680> even<00:01:00.610> though<00:01:00.940> it's<00:01:01.120> spinning<00:01:01.510> to

00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:01.629 
platform even though it's spinning to

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:05.550 
platform even though it's spinning to
the<00:01:01.659> left<00:01:03.809> you're<00:01:04.809> ever<00:01:04.960> in<00:01:05.110> a<00:01:05.170> tricky

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:05.560 
the left you're ever in a tricky

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.250 
the left you're ever in a tricky
situation<00:01:05.940> you<00:01:06.940> can<00:01:07.150> use<00:01:07.300> cloud<00:01:07.690> Mario's

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:08.260 
situation you can use cloud Mario's

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.550 
situation you can use cloud Mario's
powers<00:01:08.830> to<00:01:09.159> get<00:01:09.280> yourself<00:01:09.520> out<00:01:09.940> of<00:01:10.000> it<00:01:10.409> just<00:01:11.409> to

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 
powers to get yourself out of it just to

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.770 
powers to get yourself out of it just to
create<00:01:11.860> an<00:01:12.070> emergency<00:01:12.760> platform<00:01:13.360> should<00:01:13.659> you

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:13.780 
create an emergency platform should you

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:20.730 
create an emergency platform should you
ever<00:01:13.930> need<00:01:14.049> one<00:01:18.240> and<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:20.320> good<00:01:20.470> thing<00:01:20.530> about

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:20.740 
ever need one and the good thing about

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.980 
ever need one and the good thing about
this<00:01:21.159> level<00:01:21.580> is<00:01:21.790> that<00:01:22.030> it's<00:01:22.210> absolutely

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990 
this level is that it's absolutely

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:37.120 
this level is that it's absolutely
filled<00:01:23.409> with<00:01:23.770> Starbase

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.340 

so<00:01:37.969> really<00:01:38.180> there's<00:01:38.450> not<00:01:38.600> much<00:01:38.810> to<00:01:39.020> say<00:01:39.229> about

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
so really there's not much to say about

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.499 
so really there's not much to say about
this<00:01:39.649> level<00:01:40.039> you<00:01:40.070> just<00:01:40.219> go<00:01:40.729> from<00:01:40.939> platform<00:01:41.390> to

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:41.509 
this level you just go from platform to

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:50.740 
this level you just go from platform to
platform<00:01:45.880> am<00:01:46.880> I<00:01:47.180> gonna<00:01:47.360> get<00:01:47.509> that<00:01:47.689> one<00:01:47.899> i<00:01:49.750> miss

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
platform am I gonna get that one i miss

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:56.850 
platform am I gonna get that one i miss
the<00:01:50.929> one<00:01:51.079> up<00:01:51.229> oh<00:01:51.439> well<00:01:52.119> i'm<00:01:53.119> going<00:01:53.450> to<00:01:53.509> move<00:01:53.659> on

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860

00:02:01.389 --> 00:02:01.399 
comment little comment metal mario you

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:07.990 
comment little comment metal mario you
got<00:02:01.640> the<00:02:01.789> comet<00:02:02.299> metal<00:02:05.259> and<00:02:06.460> it<00:02:07.460> looks<00:02:07.819> like

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
got the comet metal and it looks like

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.500 
got the comet metal and it looks like
i'm<00:02:08.179> already<00:02:08.599> at<00:02:08.840> the<00:02:09.019> end<00:02:09.170> of<00:02:09.289> this<00:02:09.470> level

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:10.510 
i'm already at the end of this level

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:14.199 
i'm already at the end of this level
very<00:02:11.510> very<00:02:11.870> simple<00:02:12.340> just<00:02:13.340> keep<00:02:13.549> moving<00:02:13.760> across

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
very very simple just keep moving across

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:16.089 
very very simple just keep moving across
the<00:02:14.450> platforms<00:02:15.019> internationally<00:02:15.680> you<00:02:15.860> make

00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:16.099 
the platforms internationally you make

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:18.700 
the platforms internationally you make
it<00:02:16.280> to<00:02:16.400> the<00:02:16.489> end
