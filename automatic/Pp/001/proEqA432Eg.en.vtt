00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:10.300 
like now this is another PVC application
here<00:02:04.450> but<00:02:05.450> this<00:02:05.600> is<00:02:05.960> this<00:02:06.619> 3/4<00:02:07.340> PVC<00:02:07.580> and<00:02:09.310> this

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
here but this is this 3/4 PVC and this

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:11.800 
here but this is this 3/4 PVC and this
is<00:02:10.429> a<00:02:10.489> three<00:02:10.700> quarter<00:02:10.970> inch<00:02:11.060> coupling<00:02:11.599> and<00:02:11.689> I

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
is a three quarter inch coupling and I

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.259 
is a three quarter inch coupling and I
drilled<00:02:12.049> a<00:02:12.140> hole<00:02:12.170> here<00:02:12.680> this<00:02:13.640> coupling<00:02:13.970> to<00:02:14.090> fit

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:14.269 
drilled a hole here this coupling to fit

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:18.570 
drilled a hole here this coupling to fit
into<00:02:14.500> and<00:02:15.500> I<00:02:15.590> ran<00:02:15.799> the<00:02:16.040> coax<00:02:16.939> from<00:02:17.629> the

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
into and I ran the coax from the

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.619 
into and I ran the coax from the
transducer<00:02:19.580> up<00:02:20.480> through<00:02:20.780> the

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:21.629 
transducer up through the

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:25.539 
transducer up through the
PVC<00:02:22.590> out<00:02:23.069> the<00:02:23.280> back<00:02:23.569> to<00:02:24.569> the<00:02:24.659> back<00:02:24.840> of<00:02:25.109> the

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:25.549 
PVC out the back to the back of the

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:29.569 
PVC out the back to the back of the
depth<00:02:26.549> finder<00:02:26.969> well<00:02:27.359> step<00:02:27.689> finder<00:02:28.310> you<00:02:29.310> move

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:29.579 
depth finder well step finder you move

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:31.429 
depth finder well step finder you move
it<00:02:29.700> up<00:02:29.790> and<00:02:29.999> down<00:02:30.030> so<00:02:30.569> when<00:02:30.719> you're<00:02:30.900> rolling

00:02:31.429 --> 00:02:31.439 
it up and down so when you're rolling

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:34.069 
it up and down so when you're rolling
down<00:02:31.799> the<00:02:31.950> road<00:02:32.450> you<00:02:33.450> know<00:02:33.480> that<00:02:33.719> thing<00:02:33.900> don't

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:34.079 
down the road you know that thing don't

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:37.610 
down the road you know that thing don't
hit<00:02:34.319> the<00:02:34.950> road<00:02:35.159> keeps<00:02:35.730> getting<00:02:36.180> damaged<00:02:36.620> when

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
hit the road keeps getting damaged when

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.080 
hit the road keeps getting damaged when
you<00:02:37.709> really<00:02:37.980> go<00:02:38.099> fish<00:02:38.400> and<00:02:38.549> just<00:02:38.670> put<00:02:38.849> it<00:02:38.939> down

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
you really go fish and just put it down

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.539 
you really go fish and just put it down
like<00:02:39.359> that<00:02:39.599> so<00:02:40.040> hopefully<00:02:41.040> that'll<00:02:41.370> work

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:41.549 
like that so hopefully that'll work

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:42.110 
like that so hopefully that'll work
pretty<00:02:41.849> good

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
pretty good

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.789 
pretty good
I<00:02:42.590> bought<00:02:43.590> a<00:02:44.150> first<00:02:45.150> time<00:02:45.329> I<00:02:45.389> use<00:02:45.689> it<00:02:45.719> I<00:02:46.079> think

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:46.799 
I bought a first time I use it I think

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:48.110 
I bought a first time I use it I think
I'm<00:02:46.950> just<00:02:47.129> gonna<00:02:47.310> take<00:02:47.519> it<00:02:47.549> out<00:02:47.760> and<00:02:47.909> rode

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
I'm just gonna take it out and rode

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.240 
I'm just gonna take it out and rode
around<00:02:48.450> because<00:02:49.439> I<00:02:49.530> think<00:02:49.590> that'd<00:02:49.980> be<00:02:50.010> the

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
around because I think that'd be the

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.569 
around because I think that'd be the
safest<00:02:50.579> way<00:02:50.790> to<00:02:50.819> do<00:02:51.090> it<00:02:51.269> and<00:02:52.159> I'll<00:02:53.159> take<00:02:53.430> it

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:53.579 
safest way to do it and I'll take it

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:56.229 
safest way to do it and I'll take it
rolled<00:02:54.209> over<00:02:54.359> the<00:02:54.540> beach<00:02:54.719> and<00:02:55.019> I'll<00:02:55.109> probably

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239 
rolled over the beach and I'll probably

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:58.399 
rolled over the beach and I'll probably
everybody<00:02:57.239> see<00:02:57.480> that<00:02:57.510> when<00:02:57.840> I<00:02:57.870> do<00:02:58.049> that<00:02:58.230> on

00:02:58.399 --> 00:02:58.409 
everybody see that when I do that on

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:00.890 
everybody see that when I do that on
maiden<00:02:58.799> voyage<00:02:59.129> but<00:02:59.370> if<00:02:59.939> we<00:03:00.120> do<00:03:00.269> that<00:03:00.480> then<00:03:00.780> I'm

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
maiden voyage but if we do that then I'm

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.379 
maiden voyage but if we do that then I'm
going<00:03:01.079> to<00:03:01.139> put<00:03:02.069> power<00:03:02.340> on<00:03:02.639> it<00:03:02.819> little<00:03:03.090> outboard

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:03.389 
going to put power on it little outboard

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:05.179 
going to put power on it little outboard
motor<00:03:03.719> I<00:03:03.870> got<00:03:04.049> little<00:03:04.379> two<00:03:04.889> and<00:03:04.919> a<00:03:05.040> half

00:03:05.179 --> 00:03:05.189 
motor I got little two and a half

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:09.640 
motor I got little two and a half
horsepower<00:03:05.579> Suzuki<00:03:06.359> over<00:03:06.569> here<00:03:06.750> than<00:03:06.959> I<00:03:07.489> word

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
horsepower Suzuki over here than I word

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:12.500 
horsepower Suzuki over here than I word
nice<00:03:10.650> for<00:03:10.949> the<00:03:11.040> motors<00:03:11.370> four-stroke<00:03:12.030> straight

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
nice for the motors four-stroke straight

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.990 
nice for the motors four-stroke straight
gasoline<00:03:13.280> and<00:03:14.280> according<00:03:14.790> to<00:03:14.909> the

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000

horse<00:03:17.129> ought<00:03:17.370> to<00:03:17.459> push<00:03:17.669> that<00:03:17.849> boat<00:03:18.120> about

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:18.359 
horse ought to push that boat about

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:20.750 
horse ought to push that boat about
eight<00:03:18.569> or<00:03:18.689> ten<00:03:18.870> mile<00:03:19.109> an<00:03:19.260> hour<00:03:19.409> so<00:03:19.919> I<00:03:20.189> think

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
eight or ten mile an hour so I think

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.509 
eight or ten mile an hour so I think
that'd<00:03:21.180> be<00:03:21.209> fast<00:03:21.689> enough<00:03:21.870> for<00:03:22.260> it<00:03:22.349> and<00:03:22.620> to

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
that'd be fast enough for it and to

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:25.670 
that'd be fast enough for it and to
probably<00:03:23.819> run<00:03:24.090> all<00:03:24.329> day<00:03:24.599> on<00:03:24.870> about<00:03:25.169> a<00:03:25.199> gallon

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
probably run all day on about a gallon

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.559 
probably run all day on about a gallon
of<00:03:25.709> gas<00:03:26.180> so<00:03:27.180> till<00:03:28.079> next<00:03:28.319> time<00:03:28.620> when<00:03:29.419> do<00:03:30.419> the

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:30.569 
of gas so till next time when do the

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:33.530 
of gas so till next time when do the
maiden<00:03:30.840> voyage<00:03:31.229> will<00:03:31.879> be<00:03:32.879> working<00:03:33.209> on<00:03:33.329> it<00:03:33.479> and

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
maiden voyage will be working on it and

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:34.969 
maiden voyage will be working on it and
I'll<00:03:33.659> let<00:03:33.810> you<00:03:33.959> know<00:03:33.989> anything<00:03:34.349> else<00:03:34.650> I<00:03:34.829> get

00:03:34.969 --> 00:03:34.979 
I'll let you know anything else I get

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:37.519 
I'll let you know anything else I get
