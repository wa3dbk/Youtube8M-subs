00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
your arms around when you're doing them

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.689 
your arms around when you're doing them
what<00:00:52.739> we're<00:00:52.860> gonna<00:00:52.980> do<00:00:53.250> is<00:00:53.399> we're<00:00:53.520> going<00:00:53.610> to

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
what we're gonna do is we're going to

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.119 
what we're gonna do is we're going to
put<00:00:53.820> a<00:00:53.850> BOSU<00:00:54.329> ball<00:00:54.629> down<00:00:54.899> and<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.559> BOSU<00:00:55.920> ball

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
put a BOSU ball down and the BOSU ball

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.939 
put a BOSU ball down and the BOSU ball
is<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.640> blue<00:00:56.969> ball<00:00:57.239> tends<00:00:58.079> to<00:00:58.230> be<00:00:58.320> blue<00:00:58.530> where

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
is the blue ball tends to be blue where

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.790 
is the blue ball tends to be blue where
it's<00:00:59.250> a<00:00:59.690> circle<00:01:00.690> on<00:01:00.750> this<00:01:00.870> side<00:01:01.109> and<00:01:01.379> just<00:01:01.530> flat

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
it's a circle on this side and just flat

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.260 
it's a circle on this side and just flat
on<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:02.039> other<00:01:02.070> side<00:01:02.430> you're<00:01:02.940> gonna<00:01:03.030> put<00:01:03.239> that

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
on the other side you're gonna put that

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.060 
on the other side you're gonna put that
facing<00:01:03.809> down<00:01:03.960> you're<00:01:04.229> gonna<00:01:04.320> get<00:01:04.530> on<00:01:04.650> that<00:01:04.680> and

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
facing down you're gonna get on that and

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.550 
facing down you're gonna get on that and
squat<00:01:05.460> on<00:01:05.489> that<00:01:06.200> now

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
squat on that now

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.429 
squat on that now
thus<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.640> BOSU<00:01:09.180> ball<00:01:09.390> is<00:01:09.600> going<00:01:09.810> to<00:01:09.869> bring<00:01:10.170> in

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
thus the BOSU ball is going to bring in

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.039 
thus the BOSU ball is going to bring in
all<00:01:10.650> of<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.670> stabilizing<00:01:12.330> muscles<00:01:12.780> which

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049

all of the stabilizing muscles which
you're<00:01:13.950> going<00:01:14.369> to<00:01:14.460> be<00:01:14.549> firing<00:01:15.030> as<00:01:15.390> you<00:01:15.570> use

you're going to be firing that by
keeping<00:01:44.909> your<00:01:45.180> stomach<00:01:45.299> sucked<00:01:45.750> in<00:01:45.930> keeping

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
keeping your stomach sucked in keeping

00:01:46.619 --> 00:02:03.639 
keeping your stomach sucked in keeping
everything<00:01:46.860> really<00:01:47.189> tight<00:02:01.009> and<00:02:02.600> very

00:02:03.639 --> 00:02:03.649 
everything really tight and very

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:08.449 
everything really tight and very
somewhere<00:02:04.649> between<00:02:04.799> 30<00:02:05.460> to<00:02:06.030> 60<00:02:06.780> feet<00:02:07.459> the

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
somewhere between 30 to 60 feet the

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.330 
somewhere between 30 to 60 feet the
board<00:02:09.000> is<00:02:09.179> more<00:02:09.450> challenging<00:02:09.840> this<00:02:10.349> this<00:02:10.979> rope

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
board is more challenging this this rope

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.150 
board is more challenging this this rope
is<00:02:11.670> probably<00:02:12.629> around<00:02:12.980> 40<00:02:13.980> inch<00:02:14.430> 45<00:02:15.239> feet<00:02:15.540> long

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
is probably around 40 inch 45 feet long

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.589 
is probably around 40 inch 45 feet long
so<00:02:17.160> the<00:02:17.370> bigger<00:02:17.580> the<00:02:17.670> rope<00:02:17.940> obviously<00:02:18.450> the

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 
so the bigger the rope obviously the

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:20.210 
so the bigger the rope obviously the
higher<00:02:18.780> it's<00:02:19.020> going<00:02:19.140> to<00:02:19.200> be<00:02:19.290> as<00:02:19.379> well<00:02:19.530> so<00:02:19.980> after

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
higher it's going to be as well so after

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.449 
higher it's going to be as well so after
you<00:02:20.610> pick<00:02:20.760> up<00:02:20.970> the<00:02:21.120> rope<00:02:21.959> you're<00:02:22.530> going<00:02:22.920> to<00:02:23.190> get

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
you pick up the rope you're going to get

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:27.710 
you pick up the rope you're going to get
on<00:02:23.670> to<00:02:23.940> the<00:02:24.120> BOSU<00:02:24.660> ball<00:02:24.900> and<00:02:25.800> from<00:02:26.730> there<00:02:26.970> we're

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
on to the BOSU ball and from there we're

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.570 
on to the BOSU ball and from there we're
going<00:02:28.020> to<00:02:28.200> squat<00:02:28.650> down<00:02:29.010> so<00:02:31.129> already<00:02:32.129> as<00:02:32.370> we're

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
going to squat down so already as we're

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.000 
going to squat down so already as we're
squatting<00:02:32.879> it's<00:02:33.780> probably<00:02:34.260> difficult<00:02:34.680> to<00:02:34.800> see

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
squatting it's probably difficult to see

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.270 
squatting it's probably difficult to see
the<00:02:35.810> camera<00:02:36.810> but<00:02:37.620> my<00:02:37.769> legs<00:02:38.010> are<00:02:38.190> already

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
the camera but my legs are already

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.199 
the camera but my legs are already
shaking<00:02:38.760> a<00:02:38.819> little<00:02:38.910> bit

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
shaking a little bit

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:41.360 
shaking a little bit
not<00:02:39.599> so<00:02:39.750> much<00:02:39.840> my<00:02:39.900> legs<00:02:40.260> but<00:02:40.500> the<00:02:40.709> the<00:02:41.129> ball

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
not so much my legs but the the ball

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:42.949 
not so much my legs but the the ball
because<00:02:41.760> I'm<00:02:41.879> trying<00:02:42.060> to<00:02:42.150> balance<00:02:42.569> you<00:02:42.720> and

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
because I'm trying to balance you and

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.589 
because I'm trying to balance you and
then<00:02:43.680> from<00:02:43.890> here<00:02:44.220> we're<00:02:45.060> just<00:02:45.269> going<00:02:45.420> to<00:02:45.450> go

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:45.599 
then from here we're just going to go

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:51.170 
then from here we're just going to go
into<00:02:45.750> it<00:02:46.019> so<00:02:48.140> I'm<00:02:49.160> balancing<00:02:50.160> here<00:02:50.459> which<00:02:51.000> is

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
into it so I'm balancing here which is

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.360 
into it so I'm balancing here which is
flowering<00:02:51.599> my<00:02:52.080> core<00:02:52.500> and<00:02:52.830> all<00:02:53.250> the

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
stabilizing muscles not only in my core

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.440 
stabilizing muscles not only in my core
but<00:02:56.069> in<00:02:56.190> the<00:02:56.310> rest<00:02:56.489> of<00:02:56.610> my<00:02:56.730> body<00:02:56.940> to<00:02:57.090> keep<00:02:57.300> my

forth now your vailable sitting on the

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:30.830 
forth now your vailable sitting on the
ball<00:03:27.870> at<00:03:28.590> the<00:03:28.739> same<00:03:28.950> time<00:03:29.250> is<00:03:29.459> your<00:03:29.840> brilliant

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
ball at the same time is your brilliant

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.500 
ball at the same time is your brilliant
back<00:03:31.019> to<00:03:31.170> point<00:03:31.549> so<00:03:32.549> you're<00:03:32.970> gonna<00:03:33.090> feel<00:03:33.330> this

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
back to point so you're gonna feel this

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:40.930 
back to point so you're gonna feel this
in<00:03:33.750> your<00:03:33.780> core<00:03:34.110> as<00:03:34.260> long<00:03:34.440> as<00:03:34.560> your<00:03:34.680> obliques<00:03:35.069> so

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:45.229 

so<00:03:42.140> try<00:03:43.140> this<00:03:43.200> out<00:03:43.530> for<00:03:43.950> three<00:03:44.489> to<00:03:44.610> four<00:03:44.819> sets

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
so try this out for three to four sets

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:47.899 
so try this out for three to four sets
of<00:03:45.480> around<00:03:45.780> 30<00:03:46.110> to<00:03:46.349> 45<00:03:46.860> seconds<00:03:47.370> so<00:03:47.580> get<00:03:47.760> on<00:03:47.879> the
