00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:08.870
 well continuing with the beautiful chords 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:12.799
 and guitar specials of course 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:17.330
 part of a song of mine besides the 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:18.560
 you have by youtube called and ashes that 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:19.700
 start with the chords as well as the 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.800
 I composed a lot of years ago without 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:24.560
 no pretension is to say I was 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.150
 looking to make chords like that with strings 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.600
 to the air and I get a sequence that 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.600
 liked it very much 

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:36.210
 then this the name then is complicated 

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:37.800
 to put because is that having so many 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:42.060
 things to the air leave many alterations 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:47.090
 but many extra notes on that side of 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:47.090
 the chords and very nice people 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.130
 two 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.430
 that's it 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.100
 is the typical positions that always 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:07.670
 I say 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.670
 no no 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:15.329
 It's very important 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.180
 then also that post 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:39.509
 A song of 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:41.500
 cover of the jimmy page that is a ballad 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.170
 with so 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.110
 it's a very sonorous combination and very very 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.180
 characteristic 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.060
 so then you have a lot 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:54.710
 of you see for example this 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.930
 these also I put them enough times 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:00.220
 we are left with the story because 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.220
 this chord is very interesting 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:08.599
 a little like that appear and use some 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.160
 some songs we realize that 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:13.670
 Nor is it easy to put on because it takes 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:15.260
 4 pulsed with the little there 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.060
 you will see a lot of notes put one 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:21.819
 under three how do I put this 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.819
 you have to figure a little in thinking 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:32.430
 and this is good agreed a sequence 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.430
 stereo smaller 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.290
 yes 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.930
 i 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.310
 it would be less 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:03.220
 we then have a topic that is 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:03.220
 done all with chords of these 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.239
 which is a friend issue many years ago 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:21.879
 call or and ashes that you have it in 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:23.590
 cyber on youtube and on those chords and 

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:26.260
 a melody and well it is a theme 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:28.840
 pretty rigged and it's great for 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:31.329
 learn because why do you have 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:32.560
 so let's say of product you have like ten 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:35.319
 or twelve chords that probably do not 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.670
 had never seen and less linked very 

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:38.970
 sound and very characteristic of 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:38.970
 guitar
