00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 the mayor of the possession the casino of 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:09.320
 saint-gilles hype energy and binds to fc 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:12.150
 presents the leo pancrace gala 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:19.980
 fc2id actually fighters a 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:22.630
 influential and the second less than 70 but 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.240
 half bard delivered 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:27.189
 true battle of waele also a fund 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:30.910
 would be brought to puts right forward 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:33.010
 suggests fights are not here for nothing 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:34.780
 and have been preparing for months they 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.140
 are there to pick up the desire belt 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.140
 fc 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.680
 everyone 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:47.570
 a prediction on it 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.570
 mangane then predictions 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.800
 Mathieu Grondin 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.970
 I think that physically he is more 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.970
 sharpened 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:09.120
 this says a fight is not played here 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:13.130
 above and mathieu aarburg man to all 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:13.130
 his chances will be able to take away this fight 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:25.220
 so we will carve out pride will see everything from 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.220
 following the trend 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.280
 but I think it's going to end at 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.280
 ground 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:39.410
 the 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.720
 start 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.620
 never 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:57.040
 it starts right away this effort in 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:02:01.020
 percussion and that's how we had 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.020
 predicts so it goes very fast and alone 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:10.110
 Mathieu Grondin who takes in his guard 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:10.110
 matthieu aron gum 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:19.530
 try to grab his arm to make 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.530
 one that murat but it did not work 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:29.030
 no and a bourgoin match that prefers 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:29.030
 come back up 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.069
 will kick away where she is 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:41.060
 black and that's how you predicted 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:44.780
 a middle tick from mathieu 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:50.709
 grondin finally migdal followed by a goal 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:50.709
 right in summer bring it to the ground 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:59.280
 I have this time that is to say that 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:03:01.980
 would give a benefit in kind round 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.319
 actually for the moment so there 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.060
 this systematize it is mathieu 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:07.650
 gurney who is in the custody of a slack 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.569
 as he gets by 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.469
 here it is he who returns his control 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:12.469
 against the lateral 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:21.160
 bay it was working on an arm for 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:21.610
 have a solution that happen to get 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:26.410
 return 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:27.970
 mahmoud are very beautiful against two 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:29.950
 hot games like mathieu grondin a 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.020
 tried to take his past back by 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:36.640
 behind that was concrete right now 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:39.590
 and it's still standing up one more 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:41.480
 biological materials grandin afte 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:46.489
 they cling they bring to the ground the 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:48.170
 kingdom I think mathieu grandin is going 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:48.680
 try to work on a head 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:51.830
 ankle 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:53.269
 here we go here we go on 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:54.830
 ankles you have to be careful for 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:04:03.620
 mature butt as who got 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:04:06.860
 like that a year ago same place it happens 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:09.140
 to turn out for now there is always 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:12.610
 a key but mathieu armougom shows at 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:12.610
 public and that there is no submission 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:16.729
 another attempt by mathieu grondin 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:20.060
 on the other ankle 

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:22.370
 oh that's it he abandoned he does not know 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:25.330
 vain on chile 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:25.330
 luckily this is not the point 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:30.600
 ankles to 300 air actually 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:32.630
 facing a jujitsu specialist 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.630
 Brazilian 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:39.450
 we see that the fighters all of 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:40.950
 next congratulate themselves on the cactus 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:45.810
 once again respect the fair play 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:49.020
 is on the way tonight big gala we cut 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:49.500
 great show but especially very good 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.630
 mind 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:54.090
 on the latter doing believe that 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:55.850
 Mathieu robben escaped under 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:57.150
 of fate he actually escaped 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:59.340
 I am aiming 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:01.080
 this says to mathieu grondin right now 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:03.180
 continued to work on quÃ©bec 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.890
 was due to expose alas this phase he 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:07.260
 will kill google could not do anything 

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:10.860
 nora rupo as cp 

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:12.140
 hit by an ankle guide he lost 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:15.900
 a little stupidly 

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:18.630
 yes it's true but hey this fight is 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:21.350
 like that there are always phases where we 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:21.350
 can be had 

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:26.920
 unfortunately possession does not carry 

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:30.600
 no chance to build google that is done 

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:30.600
 have on the same type of key in addition 

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:37.249
 while we thought he was released 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:39.139
 yeah 

00:05:37.249 --> 00:05:41.209
 but he freed himself but I did not 

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:42.559
 caught for the other ankle but 

00:05:41.209 --> 00:05:44.949
 unfortunately he got himself on 

00:05:42.559 --> 00:05:44.949
 this solution 

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:52.290
 no 

00:05:56.009 --> 00:06:09.349
 the here and 6 have for the belt and a 

00:06:03.469 --> 00:06:13.039
 93 kg presented by casino is the 

00:06:09.349 --> 00:06:16.669
 decision of the judges is therefore declared 

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:26.849
 winner by submission the height 

00:06:16.669 --> 00:06:29.699
 so mathieu has no this world to whom 

00:06:26.849 --> 00:06:31.710
 won this belt more 

00:06:29.699 --> 00:06:34.009
 93 kg 

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:34.009
 deserved victory 

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:38.849
 yet he did not have anyone 

00:06:36.779 --> 00:06:41.270
 face him in the person of matthieu 

00:06:38.849 --> 00:06:41.270
 aron com 

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:45.690
 but still managed to sleep
