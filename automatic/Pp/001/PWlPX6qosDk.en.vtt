Primo's i've heard a lot of reviews from
like<00:07:10.130> six<00:07:10.940> months<00:07:11.330> ago<00:07:11.450> that<00:07:12.039> they're<00:07:13.039> having

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:13.280 
like six months ago that they're having

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:16.950 
like six months ago that they're having
problems<00:07:13.490> with<00:07:14.090> it<00:07:14.510> and<00:07:15.610> you<00:07:16.610> know

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:16.960 
problems with it and you know

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:18.450 
problems with it and you know
it's<00:07:17.110> been<00:07:17.259> a<00:07:17.289> couple<00:07:17.680> of<00:07:17.740> rough<00:07:17.889> edges<00:07:18.069> for

00:07:18.450 --> 00:07:18.460

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:21.809 
this thing but I think they must have
really<00:07:20.319> refined<00:07:20.680> this<00:07:20.889> because<00:07:21.340> I<00:07:21.370> don't

00:07:21.809 --> 00:07:21.819 
really refined this because I don't

00:07:21.819 --> 00:07:24.870 
really refined this because I don't
notice<00:07:22.150> any<00:07:22.419> of<00:07:22.630> those<00:07:22.780> things<00:07:23.340> in<00:07:24.340> this<00:07:24.580> call
