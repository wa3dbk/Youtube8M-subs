00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:36.060
 prepare a rich lemon country 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:36.060

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:42.870

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.740

 grams 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:49.660
 we are going to need a package of 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.580
 cream cheese the brand that you 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:54.940
 prefer me I like to use this 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:57.040
 but if they have another, it also serves them 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.329
 We are going to need a jelly 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.999

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:04.320

00:01:01.999 --> 00:01:06.720
 have at home 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.970
 We're going to need a milk can 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.640
 condensed 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.729
 here I have it 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.979
 we will also need a lemon this 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:20.010
 halfway through we're going to need what 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:23.790
 we are going to need only the juice we are going to 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:26.340
 need a liter of water and biscuits 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:30.060
 vanilla we will also need 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:32.460
 can occupy these or they can also 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.229
 occupy of the Maria type I had of 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.210
 these in the house then I 'm going to 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.850
 occupy these 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.610
 let's also take a spoonful of 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:47.240
 grenetina the grenetina is that the tub 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.240
 no flavor is this is a spoonful 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:54.100
 and well let's start 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:56.890
 The first thing we are going to do is set aside 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:59.740
 half a cup of this water that we have here 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:01.430
 of the liter of water we will set aside half 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:04.340
 Cup 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:06.940
 and there we are going to add the grenetina for 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.940
 hydrate it 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.710
 let's stir very well 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:40.010
 and now I'm going to take this water that I 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.250
 I'm going to take it to the stove and the 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:46.410
 I'm going to warm up 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.410
 to prepare my lemon jelly 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:56.709
 while the water heats up to 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:59.800
 prepare the lemon gelatin I'm going to 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:02.310
 empty my cookies to the processor for 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.310
 grind 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:12.209
 because it is our water heater let 

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:12.209
 to empty the gelatin 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:16.739
 and we are going to dissolve it very well 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:27.600
 I call you read my cats here I have them 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.430
 I had three packages and just ground myself 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.240
 I think that with these they reach me for the 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.830
 base of my country 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:36.580
 what I'm going to do now 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:38.830
 is to put my butter 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:41.770
 I already removed it from the refrigerator 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:44.020
 before we started preparing everything 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:46.200
 for our country and then it is very 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:49.310
 soft 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.940
 and I'm going to add it 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:53.990
 here 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.990
 to my cookie 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:03.580
 and I'm going to start 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:03.580
 knead it 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:11.689
 to have a paste with which I can 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:11.689
 lining my mold 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:18.049
 since we have our cookie with the 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:21.590
 Butter 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:24.520
 already well integrated we are going to cover our 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:24.520
 mold for bread 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:32.900
 I'm going to occupy a mold like this 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:32.900
 removable 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.240
 and I'm going to start putting 

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:40.500
 the cookie 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:52.710
 since it is well lined I'm going to take it 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:57.470
 to the refrigerator for 15 or 20 minutes 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:57.470
 in which our gelatin cools 

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:04.170
 since it cooled our gelatin I'm going to 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:06.960
 bring to the microwave oven my 

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:10.710
 grenetina that is already hydrated and I'm going 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:13.130
 to put for about 30 seconds so that it 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:13.130
 dilute 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:17.670
 while our big tub is diluted 

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:21.020
 I'm going to put in the glass of the blender 

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:21.020
 our gelatin 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:33.970
 Y 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:33.970
 I will also put the text 

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:45.050
 Y 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:45.050
 condensed milk 

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:01.050
 I will also add the grenetina 

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:20.580
 and the lemon juice 

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:20.580
 ah 

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:40.400
 and I'm going to take it to liquefy 

00:06:43.689 --> 00:06:50.789
 since we have our mixture liquefied 

00:06:46.199 --> 00:06:50.789
 I'm going to empty it into my mold 

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:03.650
 we will bring cool 

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:03.650
 to set 

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:11.070
 here we have our country finished 

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:13.410
 here is if we have left 

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:15.620
 what I'm going to do now is unmold 

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:15.620
 the 

00:07:22.139 --> 00:07:24.590
 ah 

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:31.670
 and here we have it we can see 

00:07:29.249 --> 00:07:34.910
 the cookie 

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:37.540
 and what is the lemon mousse 

00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:40.400
