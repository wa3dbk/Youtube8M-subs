00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:02.929 

why<00:00:01.199> is<00:00:01.260> the<00:00:01.530> earth<00:00:01.560> so<00:00:02.010> hospitable<00:00:02.639> to<00:00:02.909> life

00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:02.939 
why is the earth so hospitable to life

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:06.590 
why is the earth so hospitable to life
is<00:00:03.740> it<00:00:04.740> because<00:00:05.040> God<00:00:05.250> crafted<00:00:05.970> it<00:00:06.120> to<00:00:06.240> be<00:00:06.390> that

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
is it because God crafted it to be that

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.280 
is it because God crafted it to be that
way<00:00:06.779> or<00:00:07.350> did<00:00:08.220> life<00:00:08.429> just<00:00:08.790> adapt<00:00:09.450> itself<00:00:09.900> to<00:00:10.050> the

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
way or did life just adapt itself to the

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:11.259 
way or did life just adapt itself to the
world

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:11.269 
world

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:14.120 
world
did<00:00:12.269> God<00:00:12.480> shape<00:00:12.900> the<00:00:13.080> Earth's<00:00:13.230> environment<00:00:13.530> to

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
did God shape the Earth's environment to

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.790 
did God shape the Earth's environment to
help<00:00:14.250> his<00:00:14.490> creation<00:00:14.969> survive<00:00:15.450> or<00:00:16.320> did<00:00:16.590> life

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
help his creation survive or did life

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.220 
help his creation survive or did life
arise<00:00:17.160> in<00:00:17.520> response<00:00:18.210> to<00:00:18.480> the<00:00:18.600> environment

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
arise in response to the environment

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.000 
arise in response to the environment
with<00:00:19.680> no<00:00:19.859> intentional<00:00:20.520> plan<00:00:21.680> for<00:00:22.680> believers

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
with no intentional plan for believers

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.019 
with no intentional plan for believers
like<00:00:23.160> me<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:24.150> answer<00:00:24.480> is<00:00:24.660> pretty<00:00:25.170> obvious<00:00:26.029> but

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
like me the answer is pretty obvious but

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.730 
like me the answer is pretty obvious but
to<00:00:27.330> approach<00:00:27.689> these<00:00:27.960> questions<00:00:28.170> in<00:00:28.650> a

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
to approach these questions in a

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.490 
to approach these questions in a
rational<00:00:29.010> unbiased<00:00:29.970> manner<00:00:30.140> let's<00:00:31.140> look<00:00:31.349> at

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
rational unbiased manner let's look at

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.209 
rational unbiased manner let's look at
what<00:00:31.650> God<00:00:31.859> created<00:00:32.160> in<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:32.790> first<00:00:32.969> place<00:00:34.219> the

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
what God created in the first place the

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.549 
what God created in the first place the
Earth<00:00:35.399> orbits<00:00:35.969> the<00:00:36.059> Sun<00:00:36.149> in<00:00:36.570> a<00:00:36.660> habitable<00:00:37.140> zone

Earth orbits the Sun in a habitable zone

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.530 
Earth orbits the Sun in a habitable zone
of<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:37.860> solar<00:00:38.219> system<00:00:38.730> where<00:00:38.910> it<00:00:39.030> isn't<00:00:39.180> too

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
of the solar system where it isn't too

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.160 
to me it's pretty obvious caves on earth
might<00:02:17.760> have<00:02:18.000> been<00:02:18.180> caused<00:02:18.420> by<00:02:18.600> rain<00:02:18.900> water

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
might have been caused by rain water

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.760 
might have been caused by rain water

slowly percolating through rock or

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.650 
slowly percolating through rock or
perhaps<00:02:22.770> God<00:02:23.100> carved<00:02:23.550> them<00:02:23.700> out<00:02:23.850> because<00:02:24.150> he

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
perhaps God carved them out because he

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.900 
perhaps God carved them out because he
knew<00:02:24.690> that<00:02:24.900> bears<00:02:25.560> and<00:02:25.890> blind<00:02:26.130> salamanders

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
knew that bears and blind salamanders

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.750 
knew that bears and blind salamanders
would<00:02:27.060> need<00:02:27.240> a<00:02:27.270> place<00:02:27.570> to<00:02:27.780> live<00:02:28.430> why<00:02:29.430> are<00:02:29.490> there

would need a place to live why are there
rocks<00:02:30.410> maybe<00:02:31.410> so<00:02:31.830> that<00:02:31.860> lichens<00:02:32.700> and<00:02:32.880> mosses

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
rocks maybe so that lichens and mosses

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.980 
rocks maybe so that lichens and mosses
