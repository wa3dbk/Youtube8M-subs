 you know how it goes because it's a building where 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.920
 we can store the whole theme of the 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.840
 good of the resources that we win then 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.330
 the war victories of clans and 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.730
 we also have to keep troops for 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:52.320
 attack or to defend then then 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:54.240
 as you are seeing we have two floodgates 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.060
 two doors as what to call what 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.670
 they are like metallic so colored a blue 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.410
 gray and we have two the one on the left and 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.270
 the one on the right the one on the right is 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:05.190
 a bit like more enlightened and that of the 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.900
 left is a little more off now 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.090
 same I am going to put a capture of 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.910
 screen that you are going to flip guys yes yes 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.670
 the part on the left looks like a 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.890
 barbarian king yes yes or are you watching 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.440
 because the subject of the mustache the theme of 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.690
 eyes the subject of hair and everything in general 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.310
 it looks a lot like the king's 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.319
 verbal or I do not know is a coincidence 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.290
 I do not know if he threw me the pot I do not know if 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:30.000
 is that I smoked some other joint 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.380
 of those that go badly in the head but 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.480
 they are not guys the truth is that I think that 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.069
 I have nailed it enough or at least 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.330
 it looks a lot and I do not think it's a 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:38.220
 chance as you are seeing 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.260
 Well, the other buildings do not have 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.880
 no peculiarity that you say ostia 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.440
 this looks like a thing not no 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.420
 our buildings are normal each 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.010
 It has its stories but punishment field 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.360
 is the theme of the floodgates because it has 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.370
 called quite the attention then 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.080
 Well, I thought this was the best 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.400
 will be delegated and this has 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.870
 happened simply because it was the 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.459

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.590
