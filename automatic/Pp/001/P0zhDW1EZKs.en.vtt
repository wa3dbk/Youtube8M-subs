00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:07.620
 so first I give the six eggs in 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:07.620
 a dish rejected 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.720
 then I give the sugar and the two 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.720
 packages of Vanilla sugar 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.720
 the whole for me until the sugar 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.720
 stops completely 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.400
 by debris and mail under the 1 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.300

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.300
 the melted butter added 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:21.310
 the dough in part evenly on six 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:24.660
 shots and before that with the 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.660

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:44.070
 I have the colors blue red yellow orange 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:44.070

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.610

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.610

00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:17.420
 Grad for about 40 minutes in the oven 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.730
 during the freshly baked cake 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:25.049
 the white melts off 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.049
 chocolate in a water bath 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:38.200
 now only the creation was like that 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.200

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:42.440
