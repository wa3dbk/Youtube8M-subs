00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:51.370 
so why do you think this would be a good
base<00:04:48.170> camp<00:04:49.000> cuz<00:04:50.000> it's<00:04:50.120> high<00:04:50.240> up<00:04:50.270> away<00:04:51.140> from

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:51.380

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:55.730 
water so it doesn't flood up here and we

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:56.950 
water so it doesn't flood up here and we
can<00:04:55.850> work<00:04:55.970> out<00:04:56.120> a<00:04:56.150> signal<00:04:56.450> that<00:04:56.690> they<00:04:56.840> could

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:56.960 
can work out a signal that they could

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:59.320 
can work out a signal that they could
see<00:04:57.080> from<00:04:57.200> the<00:04:57.350> air<00:04:57.640> not<00:04:58.640> really<00:04:59.000> because<00:04:59.090> it
