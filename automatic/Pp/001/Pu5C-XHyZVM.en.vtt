00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:19.610
 gives us light is any aircraft that 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:21.439
 weighs less than 450 kilos at takeoff and 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:26.200
 have a minimum flight speed 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:26.200
 less than 65 kilometers per hour 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:33.210
 in any championship gives light 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.890
 we have three types of tests are 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.989
 most tests are tests of 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.640
 navigation for example how are you 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.690
 we have done this morning here is the 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:45.840
 route that they have made us do we have to go 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.870
 flying giving before taking off 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.629
 estimated speed then we calculate 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:57.130
 the points in the times of passage through 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:59.860
 each turning point and we can measure it 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:01.510
 the speed at any point the route 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:03.160
 we have to follow her also with a lot 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:06.400
 precision because there is also a margin 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:08.570
 of about 250 meters what 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.430
 practically at least one millimeter in 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.920
 the map then there are also tests of 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.450
 consumption 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.180
 they give you for example a quantity of 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:18.220
 fuel we made one of us 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:21.180
 they gave 8 kilos of fuel and to see 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:24.050
 who does more kilometers 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:27.900
 and then there are other tests that are from 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:29.480
 accuracy of expertise but good because 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.160
 example what we are going to do this afternoon 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:34.410
 you have to climb 300 meters to be 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:37.500
 engine and downs with the engine stopped and 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:40.659
 you have to enter a rectangle of 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:43.090
 100 x 25 meters 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:46.569
 trying to adjust as much as possible 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:48.249
 moment of the touch to an exact minute you 

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:51.770
 to be an engine and you have to enter 

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:54.640
 example there are 52 minutes 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:57.640
 brand 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.640
 ah 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:06.300
 This year is very difficult because 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:08.640
 all the good people of all countries 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:12.450
 because it has come does not arise it seems that 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:14.600
 they have a special appeal and do not miss 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.600
 to nobody
