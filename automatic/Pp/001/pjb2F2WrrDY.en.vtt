particular card is a club car so just
about<00:01:22.080> all<00:01:22.320> your<00:01:22.530> club<00:01:22.710> cars<00:01:22.979> you're<00:01:23.250> going<00:01:23.369> to

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
about all your club cars you're going to

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.580 
about all your club cars you're going to
see<00:01:23.670> your<00:01:24.060> two<00:01:24.299> main<00:01:24.479> wires<00:01:24.840> are<00:01:25.200> coming<00:01:25.350> off

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
see your two main wires are coming off

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.179 
see your two main wires are coming off
of<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.860> batteries

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:28.189 
of the batteries

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:31.359 
of the batteries
the<00:01:28.520> driver<00:01:28.790> side<00:01:29.060> on<00:01:30.049> the<00:01:30.259> passenger<00:01:30.799> side

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:31.369 
the driver side on the passenger side

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:33.789 
the driver side on the passenger side
these<00:01:32.329> are<00:01:32.630> headed<00:01:32.899> back<00:01:33.049> towards<00:01:33.409> the<00:01:33.560> motor

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:33.799 
these are headed back towards the motor

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:36.249 
these are headed back towards the motor
so<00:01:34.369> we<00:01:34.399> know<00:01:34.820> if<00:01:35.329> we<00:01:35.539> take<00:01:35.750> this<00:01:35.990> and<00:01:36.229> just

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:36.259 
so we know if we take this and just

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:39.910 
so we know if we take this and just
probe<00:01:36.649> it<00:01:36.890> at<00:01:37.549> both<00:01:37.939> ends<00:01:38.270> our<00:01:39.200> meter<00:01:39.500> should

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
probe it at both ends our meter should

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.179 
probe it at both ends our meter should
be<00:01:40.100> over<00:01:40.369> 48<00:01:40.820> volts<00:01:41.439> and<00:01:42.439> right<00:01:42.799> here<00:01:42.979> we're

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:43.189 
be over 48 volts and right here we're

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:45.609 
be over 48 volts and right here we're
showing<00:01:43.509> 48.4<00:01:44.509> so<00:01:44.840> we<00:01:44.990> know<00:01:45.200> that<00:01:45.229> these<00:01:45.560> two

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:45.619 
showing 48.4 so we know that these two

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:48.190 
showing 48.4 so we know that these two
batteries<00:01:46.310> are<00:01:46.670> the<00:01:47.000> two<00:01:47.240> batteries<00:01:47.840> that<00:01:48.049> we

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
batteries are the two batteries that we

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.550 
batteries are the two batteries that we
need<00:01:48.409> to<00:01:48.530> hook<00:01:48.649> up<00:01:48.890> to<00:01:49.479> so<00:01:50.479> at<00:01:50.869> that<00:01:51.289> point

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
need to hook up to so at that point

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.380 
need to hook up to so at that point
we're<00:01:52.250> going<00:01:52.429> to<00:01:52.520> get<00:01:52.670> our<00:01:52.789> wire<00:01:53.000> and<00:01:53.299> we

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
we're going to get our wire and we

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.450 
we're going to get our wire and we
typically<00:01:53.750> this<00:01:53.899> use<00:01:54.140> 14<00:01:54.649> gauge<00:01:54.829> wire<00:01:54.860> here

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
typically this use 14 gauge wire here

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.210 
typically this use 14 gauge wire here
and<00:01:56.119> we're<00:01:56.420> going<00:01:56.750> to<00:01:56.780> run<00:01:57.110> our<00:01:57.259> wire<00:01:57.470> to<00:01:58.009> these

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220 
and we're going to run our wire to these

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.490 
and we're going to run our wire to these
first<00:01:58.549> two<00:01:58.789> pegs<00:01:59.030> up<00:01:59.390> here<00:01:59.600> we<00:02:00.200> got<00:02:00.349> our

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
first two pegs up here we got our

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.800 
first two pegs up here we got our
positive<00:02:00.970> and<00:02:01.970> our<00:02:02.149> negative

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
positive and our negative

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.020 
positive and our negative
so<00:02:03.619> we'll<00:02:03.830> just<00:02:03.979> run<00:02:04.039> our<00:02:04.310> wires<00:02:04.549> from<00:02:04.909> the

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
so we'll just run our wires from the

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.270 
so we'll just run our wires from the
battery<00:02:05.450> up<00:02:06.049> to<00:02:06.110> the<00:02:06.409> -<00:02:06.590> to<00:02:06.979> where<00:02:07.130> we're<00:02:07.250> going

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
battery up to the - to where we're going

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.719 
battery up to the - to where we're going
to<00:02:07.429> install<00:02:07.729> these

positive<00:03:38.359> you'll<00:03:39.139> see<00:03:39.350> your<00:03:39.500> plus<00:03:39.709> mark<00:03:40.069> on

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280 
positive you'll see your plus mark on

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.160 
positive you'll see your plus mark on
there<00:03:40.519> that's<00:03:41.090> going<00:03:41.269> to<00:03:41.329> go<00:03:41.480> up<00:03:41.600> to<00:03:42.019> the

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:42.170 
there that's going to go up to the

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:44.170 
there that's going to go up to the
positive<00:03:42.709> wire<00:03:42.920> at<00:03:43.220> the<00:03:43.370> end<00:03:43.549> of<00:03:43.700> the<00:03:43.790> series

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:44.180 
positive wire at the end of the series

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.539 
positive wire at the end of the series
and<00:03:44.540> then<00:03:44.750> to<00:03:45.079> our<00:03:45.200> negative<00:03:45.650> we<00:03:46.160> showed<00:03:46.400> you

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:46.549 
and then to our negative we showed you

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:48.520 
and then to our negative we showed you
earlier<00:03:46.579> where<00:03:47.299> to<00:03:47.510> find<00:03:47.720> those<00:03:47.959> last<00:03:48.230> two

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:48.530 
earlier where to find those last two

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:50.050 
earlier where to find those last two
wires<00:03:48.769> since<00:03:49.040> the<00:03:49.130> last<00:03:49.310> two<00:03:49.549> had<00:03:49.790> at<00:03:49.910> back

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
wires since the last two had at back

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.569 
wires since the last two had at back
forcing<00:03:50.510> motor<00:03:50.690> controller<00:03:51.530> area<00:03:51.799> that<00:03:52.459> will

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:52.579 
forcing motor controller area that will

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:54.610 
forcing motor controller area that will
be<00:03:52.670> the<00:03:52.790> two<00:03:52.970> that<00:03:53.120> you<00:03:53.269> hook<00:03:53.420> up<00:03:53.599> to<00:03:53.840> another

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
be the two that you hook up to another

be the two that you hook up to another
question<00:03:55.069> we<00:03:55.160> get<00:03:55.280> on<00:03:55.400> this<00:03:55.519> particular<00:03:56.000> meter

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:56.209 
question we get on this particular meter

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:58.330 
question we get on this particular meter
is<00:03:56.450> that<00:03:56.870> we<00:03:56.989> don't<00:03:57.139> that<00:03:57.799> people<00:03:58.190> are

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340 
is that we don't that people are

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:59.949 
is that we don't that people are
worrying<00:03:58.639> about<00:03:58.819> them<00:03:59.120> running<00:03:59.329> all<00:03:59.660> the<00:03:59.810> time

00:03:59.949 --> 00:03:59.959 
worrying about them running all the time

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:01.750 
worrying about them running all the time
while<00:04:00.230> all<00:04:00.319> this<00:04:00.440> is<00:04:00.650> is<00:04:00.829> a<00:04:00.859> monitoring<00:04:01.430> system

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 
while all this is is a monitoring system

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.180 
while all this is is a monitoring system
so<00:04:02.269> it's<00:04:02.989> not<00:04:03.139> pulling<00:04:03.500> no<00:04:03.650> power<00:04:03.889> whatsoever

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190 
so it's not pulling no power whatsoever

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:05.860 
so it's not pulling no power whatsoever
it's<00:04:04.790> hooked<00:04:05.000> up<00:04:05.150> directly<00:04:05.269> to<00:04:05.599> your

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 
it's hooked up directly to your
