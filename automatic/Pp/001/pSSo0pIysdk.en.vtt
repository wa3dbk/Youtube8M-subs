and today are going to be looking at a
game<00:00:04.830> called<00:00:05.180> taija<00:00:06.180> to<00:00:06.420> I<00:00:06.450> think<00:00:06.779> it's

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
game called taija to I think it's

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:08.660 
game called taija to I think it's
pronounced<00:00:07.410> if<00:00:07.529> not<00:00:08.069> I'm<00:00:08.250> sure<00:00:08.280> you<00:00:08.460> can<00:00:08.550> let

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
pronounced if not I'm sure you can let

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.879 
pronounced if not I'm sure you can let
me<00:00:08.700> know<00:00:08.760> in<00:00:08.880> the<00:00:08.940> comments<00:00:09.300> below<00:00:09.330> and<00:00:09.690> it's<00:00:10.500> a

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
me know in the comments below and it's a

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:12.530 
me know in the comments below and it's a
puzzle<00:00:11.340> game<00:00:11.370> which<00:00:11.759> is<00:00:11.880> inspired<00:00:12.090> by<00:00:12.389> the

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
puzzle game which is inspired by the

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.499 
puzzle game which is inspired by the
Chinese<00:00:13.290> mythology<00:00:13.469> Yuna<00:00:14.370> and<00:00:14.610> yang<00:00:14.849> and<00:00:15.150> this

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
Chinese mythology Yuna and yang and this

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.750 
Chinese mythology Yuna and yang and this
one<00:00:15.690> is<00:00:15.870> all<00:00:16.049> about<00:00:16.289> balancing<00:00:17.070> colors<00:00:17.490> and

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
one is all about balancing colors and

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.179 
one is all about balancing colors and
harmony<00:00:18.150> so<00:00:18.869> the<00:00:18.960> idea<00:00:18.990> is<00:00:19.289> with<00:00:19.590> this<00:00:19.830> you've

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
harmony so the idea is with this you've

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.820 
harmony so the idea is with this you've
got<00:00:20.340> to<00:00:20.550> tap<00:00:21.300> the<00:00:21.510> different<00:00:21.750> elements<00:00:21.900> to

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
got to tap the different elements to

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.009 
got to tap the different elements to
make<00:00:23.130> them<00:00:23.490> balance<00:00:23.850> color<00:00:24.210> balance<00:00:24.539> on<00:00:24.810> both

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
make them balance color balance on both

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.450 
make them balance color balance on both
sides<00:00:26.269> both<00:00:27.269> sides<00:00:27.570> been<00:00:27.869> one<00:00:28.769> side<00:00:29.010> is<00:00:29.220> above

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
sides both sides been one side is above

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:30.980 
sides both sides been one side is above
the<00:00:29.490> white<00:00:29.699> line<00:00:29.910> and<00:00:30.269> the<00:00:30.420> other<00:00:30.539> side<00:00:30.720> is

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
the white line and the other side is

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.510 
the white line and the other side is
below<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:31.260> white<00:00:31.500> line<00:00:31.679> so<00:00:32.099> i<00:00:32.130> can<00:00:32.309> see<00:00:32.489> that

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
below the white line so i can see that

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.120 
below the white line so i can see that
element<00:00:33.000> here<00:00:33.590> kappa<00:00:34.590> there<00:00:34.829> cuz<00:00:34.980> it's<00:00:35.070> the

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
element here kappa there cuz it's the

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.530 
element here kappa there cuz it's the
same<00:00:35.340> color<00:00:35.640> so<00:00:35.969> you<00:00:36.030> got<00:00:36.149> to<00:00:36.210> move<00:00:36.300> it<00:00:36.420> down

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
same color so you got to move it down

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:37.760 
same color so you got to move it down
here<00:00:36.719> and<00:00:36.899> we'll<00:00:37.020> move<00:00:37.170> this<00:00:37.290> one<00:00:37.440> here<00:00:37.680> as

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
here and we'll move this one here as

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.080 
here and we'll move this one here as
well<00:00:39.500> now<00:00:40.500> know<00:00:40.710> to<00:00:41.040> same<00:00:41.340> colors<00:00:41.670> that<00:00:41.790> can<00:00:41.940> be

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
well now know to same colors that can be

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.350 
well now know to same colors that can be
in<00:00:42.149> the<00:00:42.210> same<00:00:42.390> side<00:00:42.690> as<00:00:42.719> well<00:00:44.030> so<00:00:45.030> you<00:00:45.090> just<00:00:45.210> got

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
in the same side as well so you just got

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.940 
in the same side as well so you just got
to<00:00:45.390> make<00:00:45.570> sure<00:00:45.629> that<00:00:46.020> you<00:00:46.110> color<00:00:46.350> balance<00:00:46.710> them

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
to make sure that you color balance them

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.010 
to make sure that you color balance them
equally<00:00:47.760> it's<00:00:48.180> like<00:00:48.300> this<00:00:48.450> one<00:00:48.570> here<00:00:48.690> kappa

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
equally it's like this one here kappa

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.840 
equally it's like this one here kappa
there<00:00:49.230> because<00:00:49.440> it's<00:00:49.559> already<00:00:49.710> pink<00:00:50.039> so<00:00:50.789> i

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
there because it's already pink so i

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.639 
there because it's already pink so i
move<00:00:51.030> that<00:00:51.059> one<00:00:51.239> around<00:00:51.480> and<00:00:52.320> that's<00:00:52.500> already

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
move that one around and that's already

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:58.569 
move that one around and that's already
got<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:52.860> purple<00:00:53.219> on<00:00:53.340> again<00:00:53.940> move<00:00:54.149> that<00:00:54.300> around

00:00:58.569 --> 00:00:58.579 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:01.099 

and<00:00:59.579> at<00:00:59.699> the<00:00:59.760> beginning<00:01:00.180> it<00:01:00.359> will<00:01:00.570> start<00:01:00.930> off

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
and at the beginning it will start off

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.229 
and at the beginning it will start off
nice<00:01:01.410> and<00:01:01.469> easy<00:01:01.739> just<00:01:02.489> so<00:01:02.640> you<00:01:02.699> get<00:01:03.000> a<00:01:03.059> good

mystical and calming it so it's ideal if
you<00:01:36.479> get<00:01:36.630> laid<00:01:36.780> phones<00:01:36.990> on<00:01:37.170> as<00:01:37.290> well

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.430 

we<00:01:47.390> can't<00:01:47.630> go<00:01:47.750> wrong<00:01:47.900> with<00:01:48.110> it<00:01:48.230> if<00:01:48.290> you<00:01:48.350> just

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:48.440 
we can't go wrong with it if you just

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:49.870 
we can't go wrong with it if you just
make<00:01:48.650> sure<00:01:48.800> that<00:01:48.830> you<00:01:49.010> balance<00:01:49.340> these<00:01:49.460> colors

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
make sure that you balance these colors

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.800 
make sure that you balance these colors
out<00:01:50.000> properly<00:01:51.280> like<00:01:52.280> so<00:01:52.550> and<00:01:52.880> just<00:01:53.450> make<00:01:53.630> sure

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
out properly like so and just make sure

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.210 
out properly like so and just make sure
they<00:01:53.930> have<00:01:53.960> equal<00:01:54.380> amount<00:01:54.620> of<00:01:54.740> color<00:01:55.010> on<00:01:55.190> both

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:55.220 
they have equal amount of color on both

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:01.240 
they have equal amount of color on both
sides<00:01:59.260> it's<00:02:00.260> a<00:02:00.290> nice<00:02:00.380> different<00:02:00.830> puzzle<00:02:01.100> game

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
sides it's a nice different puzzle game

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:02.410 
sides it's a nice different puzzle game
so<00:02:01.490> if<00:02:01.580> you<00:02:01.640> want<00:02:01.790> something<00:02:02.090> a<00:02:02.150> little<00:02:02.180> bit

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
so if you want something a little bit

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:03.640 
so if you want something a little bit
differently<00:02:02.840> may<00:02:03.020> have<00:02:03.110> not<00:02:03.230> played<00:02:03.410> if<00:02:03.530> I

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:03.650 
differently may have not played if I
