Premier League bar none his kicking
ability<00:03:42.850> is<00:03:43.150> great<00:03:43.389> and<00:03:43.720> he<00:03:43.900> will<00:03:44.049> save

Liverpool<00:03:44.799> many<00:03:45.010> many<00:03:45.250> times<00:03:45.519> a<00:03:45.700> season<00:03:45.910> right

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:46.329 
Liverpool many many times a season right

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:48.150 
Liverpool many many times a season right
in<00:03:46.420> front<00:03:46.569> of<00:03:46.690> him<00:03:46.750> with<00:03:46.989> the<00:03:47.079> defense<00:03:47.470> again

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.160 
in front of him with the defense again

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:49.289 
in front of him with the defense again
it's<00:03:48.340> an<00:03:48.430> area<00:03:48.760> that<00:03:48.790> I<00:03:48.940> think<00:03:48.970> Liverpool

00:03:49.289 --> 00:03:49.299 
it's an area that I think Liverpool

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:51.960 
it's an area that I think Liverpool
shaky<00:03:50.019> on<00:03:50.049> the<00:03:50.200> season<00:03:50.709> and<00:03:50.889> centre-back<00:03:51.790> is

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
shaky on the season and centre-back is

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:53.099 
shaky on the season and centre-back is
definitely<00:03:52.420> a<00:03:52.450> position<00:03:52.840> to<00:03:52.930> watch

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:53.109 
definitely a position to watch

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:54.840 
definitely a position to watch
especially<00:03:53.410> if<00:03:53.859> Liverpool<00:03:54.310> don't<00:03:54.549> end<00:03:54.700> up

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:54.850 
especially if Liverpool don't end up

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:56.879 
especially if Liverpool don't end up
getting<00:03:55.120> Cahill<00:03:55.450> but<00:03:56.260> with<00:03:56.380> the<00:03:56.470> addition<00:03:56.560> of

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:56.889 
getting Cahill but with the addition of

00:03:56.889 --> 00:03:58.949 
getting Cahill but with the addition of
Rica<00:03:57.280> if<00:03:57.609> agri<00:03:57.970> can<00:03:58.120> maintain<00:03:58.299> his<00:03:58.600> health<00:03:58.780> and

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 
Rica if agri can maintain his health and

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:00.539 
Rica if agri can maintain his health and
when<00:03:59.109> Johnson<00:03:59.530> comes<00:03:59.680> back<00:03:59.889> from<00:04:00.040> injury<00:04:00.340> I

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:00.549 
when Johnson comes back from injury I

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:02.460 
when Johnson comes back from injury I
think<00:04:01.150> that<00:04:01.180> could<00:04:01.480> turn<00:04:01.660> him<00:04:01.810> to<00:04:01.959> a<00:04:01.989> possible

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
think that could turn him to a possible

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:04.170 
think that could turn him to a possible
position<00:04:02.859> of<00:04:02.950> strength<00:04:03.069> and<00:04:03.489> I<00:04:03.549> think<00:04:03.609> moving

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
position of strength and I think moving

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:06.150 
position of strength and I think moving
on<00:04:04.329> I<00:04:04.359> think<00:04:04.540> the<00:04:04.720> area<00:04:04.930> that<00:04:05.230> is<00:04:05.470> undoubtedly

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160 
on I think the area that is undoubtedly

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:07.819 
on I think the area that is undoubtedly
Liverpool<00:04:06.700> strength<00:04:06.970> is<00:04:07.120> in<00:04:07.239> the<00:04:07.299> midfield

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:07.829 
Liverpool strength is in the midfield

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:09.990 
Liverpool strength is in the midfield
Liverpool<00:04:08.829> has<00:04:08.950> a<00:04:08.980> surplus<00:04:09.340> and<00:04:09.549> midfielders

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 
Liverpool has a surplus and midfielders

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:11.709 
right now proof of that was after Lonnie

Sunderland after a great preseason
Liverpool<00:04:15.340> was<00:04:15.430> actually<00:04:15.670> spoiled<00:04:16.090> for<00:04:16.209> death

Carroll<00:04:48.849> and<00:04:49.030> much<00:04:49.210> of<00:04:49.240> Liverpool<00:04:49.660> success

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.080 
Carroll and much of Liverpool success

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.689 
Carroll and much of Liverpool success
will<00:04:50.289> be<00:04:50.410> determined<00:04:50.860> of<00:04:50.919> how<00:04:51.069> those<00:04:51.280> to<00:04:51.490> link

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:51.699 
will be determined of how those to link

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:53.430 
will be determined of how those to link
up<00:04:51.880> and<00:04:52.150> how<00:04:52.569> the<00:04:52.660> chemistry<00:04:52.840> works<00:04:53.289> out

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:53.440 
up and how the chemistry works out

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:56.370 
up and how the chemistry works out
between<00:04:53.560> the<00:04:53.830> two<00:04:53.860> I<00:04:54.759> think<00:04:55.389> auntie<00:04:55.900> Carla<00:04:56.110> is

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:56.380 
between the two I think auntie Carla is

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:57.570 
between the two I think auntie Carla is
in<00:04:56.530> the<00:04:56.590> position<00:04:56.800> to<00:04:56.949> become<00:04:57.099> a<00:04:57.220> world-class

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:57.580 
in the position to become a world-class

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.610 
in the position to become a world-class
striker<00:04:57.910> I<00:04:58.180> think<00:04:58.539> Luis<00:04:58.870> Suarez<00:04:59.110> has<00:04:59.229> proved

00:04:59.610 --> 00:04:59.620 
striker I think Luis Suarez has proved

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:01.560 
striker I think Luis Suarez has proved
that<00:04:59.800> he<00:04:59.979> is<00:05:00.130> a<00:05:00.280> world-class<00:05:00.520> striker<00:05:01.030> but

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:01.570 
that he is a world-class striker but

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:03.510 
that he is a world-class striker but
behind<00:05:01.810> any<00:05:02.050> Carol<00:05:02.440> there<00:05:02.889> really<00:05:03.130> is<00:05:03.250> a<00:05:03.280> much

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:03.520 
behind any Carol there really is a much

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.100 
behind any Carol there really is a much
to<00:05:03.669> offer<00:05:03.759> of<00:05:04.000> the<00:05:04.060> striking<00:05:04.300> position<00:05:04.539> dirt

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:05.110 
to offer of the striking position dirt

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:08.310 
to offer of the striking position dirt
cow<00:05:05.289> can<00:05:05.530> also<00:05:05.710> play<00:05:06.039> as<00:05:06.160> a<00:05:06.190> striker<00:05:06.520> but<00:05:07.320> he

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:08.320 
cow can also play as a striker but he

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:09.689 
cow can also play as a striker but he
isn't<00:05:08.560> exactly<00:05:08.949> the<00:05:09.070> most<00:05:09.160> technically

00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:09.699 
isn't exactly the most technically

which we would of course welcome but I

think Liverpool's biggest problem this

00:05:37.499 --> 00:05:37.509 
challenge but like I said in the past

00:05:37.509 --> 00:05:39.719 
challenge but like I said in the past
with<00:05:38.470> all<00:05:38.620> the<00:05:38.740> new<00:05:38.860> players<00:05:39.130> and<00:05:39.250> especially

with all the new players and especially
in<00:05:40.000> midfield<00:05:40.180> and<00:05:40.630> the<00:05:40.719> depth<00:05:41.080> that's<00:05:41.259> coming

in<00:05:41.680> and<00:05:41.800> defense<00:05:42.159> that<00:05:42.969> should<00:05:43.120> be<00:05:43.210> a<00:05:43.240> lot

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:43.419 
in and defense that should be a lot

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:44.790 
in and defense that should be a lot
easier<00:05:43.449> this<00:05:43.930> year<00:05:43.990> because<00:05:44.289> Kenny<00:05:44.620> Dalglish

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:16.270

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:19.960 
a correct shape for Liverpool I think

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:21.180 
a correct shape for Liverpool I think
Liverpool<00:06:20.110> lined<00:06:20.530> up<00:06:20.650> against<00:06:20.860> Southern

think it is a very real possibility to

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:56.619 
think it is a very real possibility to

really be surprised if Liverpool is sort
of<00:07:09.770> in<00:07:10.039> the<00:07:10.279> running<00:07:10.580> to<00:07:11.180> possibly<00:07:11.509> pick<00:07:11.719> up<00:07:11.840> a

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:11.960 
of in the running to possibly pick up a

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:13.659 
of in the running to possibly pick up a
second<00:07:12.289> place<00:07:12.439> or<00:07:12.650> the<00:07:12.740> title<00:07:13.069> by<00:07:13.400> the<00:07:13.460> end<00:07:13.639> of

00:07:13.659 --> 00:07:13.669 
second place or the title by the end of

00:07:13.669 --> 00:07:16.119 
second place or the title by the end of
the<00:07:13.759> season<00:07:13.909> but<00:07:14.689> realistically<00:07:15.259> speaking<00:07:15.740> it

00:07:16.119 --> 00:07:16.129 
the season but realistically speaking it

00:07:16.129 --> 00:07:17.950 
the season but realistically speaking it
will<00:07:16.310> be<00:07:16.490> a<00:07:16.520> battle<00:07:16.729> for<00:07:17.210> fourth<00:07:17.330> place<00:07:17.509> maybe

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:17.960 
will be a battle for fourth place maybe

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:19.659 
will be a battle for fourth place maybe
third<00:07:18.259> place<00:07:18.500> but<00:07:18.800> really<00:07:19.009> fourth<00:07:19.279> place<00:07:19.490> the

00:07:19.659 --> 00:07:19.669 
third place but really fourth place the

00:07:19.669 --> 00:07:21.339 
third place but really fourth place the
entire<00:07:19.909> season<00:07:20.150> if<00:07:20.449> Liverpool<00:07:20.930> don't<00:07:21.169> get

00:07:21.339 --> 00:07:21.349 
entire season if Liverpool don't get

00:07:21.349 --> 00:07:22.390 
entire season if Liverpool don't get
fourth<00:07:21.590> place<00:07:21.740> I<00:07:21.919> think<00:07:21.949> it<00:07:22.189> will<00:07:22.250> be<00:07:22.310> a

00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:22.400 
fourth place I think it will be a

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:24.159 
fourth place I think it will be a
massive<00:07:22.669> disappointment<00:07:23.150> and<00:07:23.659> the<00:07:23.719> campaign

00:07:24.159 --> 00:07:24.169 
massive disappointment and the campaign

00:07:24.169 --> 00:07:27.670 
massive disappointment and the campaign
will<00:07:24.319> be<00:07:24.379> deemed<00:07:24.650> a<00:07:24.740> failure<00:07:25.900> when<00:07:26.900> any<00:07:27.259> team

00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:27.680 
will be deemed a failure when any team

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:29.019 
will be deemed a failure when any team
goes<00:07:27.889> out<00:07:28.039> and<00:07:28.219> signs<00:07:28.430> a<00:07:28.550> hundred<00:07:28.879> million

00:07:29.019 --> 00:07:29.029 
goes out and signs a hundred million

00:07:29.029 --> 00:07:30.579 
goes out and signs a hundred million
pounds<00:07:29.569> worth<00:07:29.599> of<00:07:29.779> players<00:07:29.990> in<00:07:30.080> less<00:07:30.379> than<00:07:30.500> a

00:07:30.579 --> 00:07:30.589 
pounds worth of players in less than a

00:07:30.589 --> 00:07:32.559 
pounds worth of players in less than a
year<00:07:30.620> I<00:07:30.949> expected<00:07:31.759> top<00:07:31.939> four<00:07:32.150> finish<00:07:32.419> the

00:07:32.559 --> 00:07:32.569 
year I expected top four finish the

00:07:32.569 --> 00:07:34.029 
year I expected top four finish the
following<00:07:32.930> season<00:07:33.110> no<00:07:33.319> matter<00:07:33.499> what<00:07:33.770> so
