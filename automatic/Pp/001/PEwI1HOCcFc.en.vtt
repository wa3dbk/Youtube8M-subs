is<00:01:52.900> now<00:01:53.110> down<00:01:54.090> so<00:01:55.090> I've<00:01:55.330> chosen<00:01:55.630> to<00:01:55.870> go<00:01:55.990> for<00:01:56.170> the

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:56.230 
is now down so I've chosen to go for the

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:58.710 
is now down so I've chosen to go for the
haul<00:01:56.380> line<00:01:56.590> here<00:01:56.890> and<00:01:57.070> I<00:01:57.610> traded<00:01:57.880> one<00:01:58.270> for<00:01:58.570> one

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 
haul line here and I traded one for one

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.930 
haul line here and I traded one for one
but<00:01:59.470> this<00:01:59.560> is<00:01:59.620> actually<00:02:00.100> a<00:02:00.130> really<00:02:00.370> good<00:02:00.610> trade

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:00.940 
but this is actually a really good trade

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:02.760 
but this is actually a really good trade
because<00:02:01.270> he<00:02:01.330> misses<00:02:01.570> all<00:02:01.870> this<00:02:02.140> experience

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
because he misses all this experience

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.000 
because he misses all this experience
and<00:02:03.210> I<00:02:04.210> potentially<00:02:05.020> waste<00:02:05.350> their<00:02:05.620> junglers

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.010 
and I potentially waste their junglers

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:07.800 
and I potentially waste their junglers
time<00:02:06.280> because<00:02:06.700> he<00:02:06.790> was<00:02:06.820> coming<00:02:07.270> to<00:02:07.390> save<00:02:07.570> their

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
time because he was coming to save their

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.420 
time because he was coming to save their
top<00:02:07.990> laner<00:02:08.259> from<00:02:08.530> this<00:02:08.679> dive<00:02:10.920> so<00:02:11.920> on<00:02:12.280> my<00:02:12.400> first

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
top laner from this dive so on my first

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.910 
top laner from this dive so on my first
back<00:02:12.909> I<00:02:13.300> only<00:02:13.780> had<00:02:14.019> enough<00:02:14.260> for<00:02:14.290> a<00:02:14.500> green<00:02:14.739> word

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
back I only had enough for a green word

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.309 
back I only had enough for a green word
but<00:02:15.250> usually<00:02:15.579> I<00:02:15.609> buy<00:02:15.849> pink<00:02:16.150> wards<00:02:16.480> but<00:02:16.719> words

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:17.319 
but usually I buy pink wards but words

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:20.390 
but usually I buy pink wards but words
are<00:02:17.409> essential<00:02:17.980> for<00:02:18.010> top<00:02:18.310> lane

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.890 

a<00:02:21.620> little<00:02:22.620> trick<00:02:23.040> I'm<00:02:23.250> doing<00:02:23.579> here<00:02:23.879> is<00:02:24.090> I'm<00:02:24.569> I'm

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
a little trick I'm doing here is I'm I'm

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.319 
a little trick I'm doing here is I'm I'm
faking<00:02:25.560> that<00:02:25.890> awarding<00:02:26.370> the<00:02:26.489> tribush<00:02:26.970> by

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:27.329 
faking that awarding the tribush by

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:29.960 
faking that awarding the tribush by
hugging<00:02:27.659> this<00:02:28.079> wall<00:02:28.370> but<00:02:29.370> really<00:02:29.730> I'm<00:02:29.819> gonna

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
hugging this wall but really I'm gonna

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.970 
hugging this wall but really I'm gonna
word<00:02:30.180> this<00:02:30.420> so<00:02:31.019> their<00:02:31.200> jungler<00:02:31.409> thinks<00:02:31.860> the

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
word this so their jungler thinks the

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.369 
word this so their jungler thinks the
Tri<00:02:32.159> Bush<00:02:32.370> is<00:02:32.519> warded<00:02:32.909> because<00:02:33.840> the<00:02:33.959> top<00:02:34.140> laner

00:02:34.369 --> 00:02:34.379 
Tri Bush is warded because the top laner

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:37.490 
Tri Bush is warded because the top laner
will<00:02:34.530> tell<00:02:34.709> on<00:02:34.829> that<00:02:35.780> just<00:02:36.780> by<00:02:36.959> hugging<00:02:37.200> this

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
will tell on that just by hugging this

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.589 
will tell on that just by hugging this
wall<00:02:37.769> it's<00:02:38.010> like<00:02:38.569> yeah<00:02:39.569> and<00:02:40.189> then<00:02:41.189> here<00:02:41.970> once

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
wall it's like yeah and then here once

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:44.149 
wall it's like yeah and then here once
again<00:02:42.689> I'm<00:02:43.019> going<00:02:43.170> to<00:02:43.349> bully<00:02:43.560> or<00:02:43.739> an<00:02:43.799> icon<00:02:43.920> as

00:02:44.149 --> 00:02:44.159 
again I'm going to bully or an icon as

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:46.039 
again I'm going to bully or an icon as
much<00:02:44.400> as<00:02:44.579> possible<00:02:44.790> and<00:02:45.540> I'm<00:02:45.629> actually<00:02:45.840> not

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:46.049 
much as possible and I'm actually not

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:48.410 
much as possible and I'm actually not
gonna<00:02:46.470> push<00:02:46.859> the<00:02:46.890> wave<00:02:47.250> I<00:02:47.640> don't<00:02:48.120> have<00:02:48.299> any

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
gonna push the wave I don't have any

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.990 
gonna push the wave I don't have any
site<00:02:48.750> over<00:02:49.109> here<00:02:49.280> so<00:02:50.280> I'm<00:02:50.609> better<00:02:50.849> off

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
site over here so I'm better off

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.030 
site over here so I'm better off
freezing<00:02:51.540> the<00:02:51.659> wave<00:02:51.870> and<00:02:52.200> just<00:02:52.260> harassing<00:02:52.920> him

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
freezing the wave and just harassing him

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:58.250 
freezing the wave and just harassing him
with<00:02:53.190> my<00:02:53.310> otters<00:02:53.700> that<00:02:56.900> was<00:02:57.900> a<00:02:57.930> little

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
with my otters that was a little

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:59.839 
with my otters that was a little
aggressive<00:02:58.560> of<00:02:58.859> me<00:02:59.010> just<00:02:59.400> in<00:02:59.489> case<00:02:59.549> their

00:02:59.839 --> 00:02:59.849 
aggressive of me just in case their

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:01.099 
aggressive of me just in case their
jungler<00:03:00.060> was<00:03:00.239> here<00:03:00.389> but<00:03:00.540> I'm<00:03:00.690> gonna<00:03:00.840> assume

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:01.109 
jungler was here but I'm gonna assume

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:04.610 
jungler was here but I'm gonna assume
this<00:03:01.290> ward<00:03:01.560> would<00:03:01.709> have<00:03:01.829> seen<00:03:02.010> him<00:03:03.440> but<00:03:04.440> yeah

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
this ward would have seen him but yeah

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.710 
this ward would have seen him but yeah
he's<00:03:05.069> missing<00:03:05.459> a<00:03:05.639> lot<00:03:05.909> of<00:03:05.939> minions<00:03:06.209> now<00:03:06.510> he

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
he's missing a lot of minions now he

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.780 
he's missing a lot of minions now he
actually<00:03:06.870> only<00:03:07.230> has<00:03:07.349> 11<00:03:07.799> CS<00:03:08.250> because<00:03:08.639> I've

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
actually only has 11 CS because I've

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.520 
actually only has 11 CS because I've
been<00:03:08.909> auditing<00:03:09.359> him<00:03:09.510> and<00:03:09.780> letting<00:03:10.260> the<00:03:10.349> wave

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
been auditing him and letting the wave

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:20.449 
been auditing him and letting the wave
push<00:03:10.829> into<00:03:11.099> me<00:03:18.170> once<00:03:19.170> again<00:03:19.319> I'm<00:03:19.769> zoning<00:03:20.220> him

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
push into me once again I'm zoning him

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:22.399 
push into me once again I'm zoning him
off<00:03:20.639> and<00:03:20.970> letting<00:03:21.150> the<00:03:21.329> lane<00:03:21.480> push<00:03:21.750> towards<00:03:22.230> me

00:03:22.399 --> 00:03:22.409 
off and letting the lane push towards me

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:25.159 
off and letting the lane push towards me
that<00:03:22.439> way<00:03:22.829> I<00:03:22.859> get<00:03:23.099> to<00:03:23.220> zone<00:03:23.430> him<00:03:23.549> the<00:03:23.670> most<00:03:24.049> if<00:03:25.049> I

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:25.169 
that way I get to zone him the most if I

00:03:25.169 --> 00:03:27.020 
that way I get to zone him the most if I
was<00:03:25.319> pushing<00:03:25.560> towards<00:03:25.949> him<00:03:26.160> I<00:03:26.430> would<00:03:26.639> put<00:03:26.849> me

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:27.030 
was pushing towards him I would put me

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.180 
was pushing towards him I would put me
in<00:03:27.060> danger<00:03:27.359> and<00:03:27.780> he<00:03:28.620> would<00:03:28.709> have<00:03:28.889> a<00:03:28.919> better

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
in danger and he would have a better

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.720 
in danger and he would have a better
chance<00:03:29.280> of<00:03:29.699> getting<00:03:29.849> farmed<00:03:30.329> here<00:03:31.370> I<00:03:32.370> took<00:03:32.430> him

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
chance of getting farmed here I took him

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.250 
chance of getting farmed here I took him
down<00:03:32.760> to<00:03:33.030> a<00:03:33.060> hundred<00:03:33.269> life<00:03:33.599> and<00:03:33.870> he<00:03:33.930> has<00:03:34.019> no

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
down to a hundred life and he has no

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.619 
down to a hundred life and he has no
health<00:03:34.470> potions<00:03:35.010> I<00:03:35.250> know<00:03:35.790> he's<00:03:36.090> gonna<00:03:36.269> have<00:03:36.359> to

00:03:36.619 --> 00:03:36.629 
health potions I know he's gonna have to

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:40.069 
health potions I know he's gonna have to
recall<00:03:37.159> here<00:03:38.159> is<00:03:38.430> a<00:03:38.489> very<00:03:39.060> good<00:03:39.419> decision<00:03:39.900> by

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:40.079 
recall here is a very good decision by

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:42.559 
recall here is a very good decision by
me<00:03:40.260> because<00:03:40.919> a<00:03:41.069> lot<00:03:41.370> of<00:03:41.400> top<00:03:41.669> laners<00:03:42.060> would

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:42.569 
me because a lot of top laners would

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:45.199 
me because a lot of top laners would
choose<00:03:42.810> to<00:03:42.840> shove<00:03:43.199> the<00:03:43.379> wave<00:03:43.590> here<00:03:44.000> however<00:03:45.000> I

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
choose to shove the wave here however I

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:46.939 
choose to shove the wave here however I
notice<00:03:45.510> he's<00:03:45.720> pushing<00:03:46.109> towards<00:03:46.379> me<00:03:46.590> and<00:03:46.889> he

00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:46.949 
notice he's pushing towards me and he

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:49.610 
notice he's pushing towards me and he
has<00:03:47.340> to<00:03:47.519> recall<00:03:47.940> by<00:03:48.690> letting<00:03:48.900> the<00:03:49.079> wave<00:03:49.290> just

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
has to recall by letting the wave just

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.890 
has to recall by letting the wave just
push<00:03:50.099> towards<00:03:50.430> me<00:03:50.579> slightly<00:03:50.970> it<00:03:51.419> has<00:03:51.599> two

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
push towards me slightly it has two

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.849 
push towards me slightly it has two
extra<00:03:52.199> minions<00:03:52.590> we're<00:03:53.459> both<00:03:53.609> gonna<00:03:53.819> back<00:03:54.120> and

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:54.859 
extra minions we're both gonna back and

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:57.589 
extra minions we're both gonna back and
we're<00:03:55.859> going<00:03:56.220> to<00:03:56.250> arrive<00:03:56.729> at<00:03:56.970> the<00:03:57.090> lane<00:03:57.269> around

00:03:57.589 --> 00:03:57.599 
we're going to arrive at the lane around

00:03:57.599 --> 00:03:59.780 
we're going to arrive at the lane around
the<00:03:57.720> same<00:03:57.959> time<00:03:58.229> except<00:03:58.949> he<00:03:59.250> missed<00:03:59.489> an<00:03:59.699> entire

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
the same time except he missed an entire

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.420 
the same time except he missed an entire
wave<00:04:00.389> and<00:04:00.690> I<00:04:00.750> missed<00:04:01.319> like<00:04:01.530> I<00:04:01.769> can't<00:04:02.010> in<00:04:02.129> minion

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
wave and I missed like I can't in minion

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.059 
wave and I missed like I can't in minion
if<00:04:03.389> I<00:04:03.569> had<00:04:03.720> decided<00:04:04.109> to<00:04:04.319> shove<00:04:04.680> the<00:04:04.889> wave

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:05.069 
if I had decided to shove the wave

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:07.360 
if I had decided to shove the wave
rather<00:04:05.790> than<00:04:06.060> just<00:04:06.239> letting<00:04:06.449> the<00:04:06.569> wave<00:04:06.720> freeze

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:07.370 
rather than just letting the wave freeze

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:10.369 
rather than just letting the wave freeze
that<00:04:08.370> would<00:04:08.579> make<00:04:09.030> it<00:04:09.180> so<00:04:09.389> he<00:04:09.780> gets<00:04:09.959> back<00:04:10.199> in

00:04:10.369 --> 00:04:10.379 
that would make it so he gets back in

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:11.689 
that would make it so he gets back in
lane<00:04:10.560> in<00:04:10.709> time<00:04:10.889> and<00:04:11.069> doesn't<00:04:11.310> miss<00:04:11.430> anything

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:11.699 
lane in time and doesn't miss anything

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:15.710 
lane in time and doesn't miss anything
and<00:04:11.940> I<00:04:12.060> actually<00:04:12.239> might<00:04:12.540> miss<00:04:12.870> a<00:04:12.900> wave<00:04:14.510> so<00:04:15.510> once

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
and I actually might miss a wave so once

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.960 
and I actually might miss a wave so once
again<00:04:15.840> I'm<00:04:16.139> playing<00:04:16.349> very<00:04:16.650> aggressive<00:04:17.190> I<00:04:17.430> know

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
again I'm playing very aggressive I know

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:19.819 
again I'm playing very aggressive I know
their<00:04:18.329> junglers<00:04:18.690> probably<00:04:19.260> around<00:04:19.500> their<00:04:19.650> red

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:19.829 
their junglers probably around their red

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:21.680 
their junglers probably around their red
buff<00:04:20.010> right<00:04:20.250> now<00:04:20.400> he<00:04:20.459> is<00:04:20.699> that's<00:04:20.970> where<00:04:21.419> he

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:21.690 
buff right now he is that's where he

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:22.250 
buff right now he is that's where he
started

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
started

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.460 
started
so<00:04:22.650> around<00:04:22.800> 720<00:04:23.550> is<00:04:23.820> when<00:04:24.570> junglers<00:04:25.110> go<00:04:25.320> to

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
so around 720 is when junglers go to

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.409 
so around 720 is when junglers go to
their<00:04:25.620> first<00:04:26.039> off<00:04:26.280> again<00:04:26.580> and<00:04:26.789> here<00:04:27.270> I<00:04:27.300> just

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:27.419 
their first off again and here I just

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:30.260 
their first off again and here I just
like<00:04:27.780> I<00:04:27.960> alt<00:04:28.139> nothing<00:04:28.560> that's<00:04:29.400> that's

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
like I alt nothing that's that's

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.000 
like I alt nothing that's that's
probably<00:04:30.510> if<00:04:30.599> that<00:04:30.750> finger<00:04:31.080> is<00:04:31.169> something

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.010 
probably if that finger is something

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:35.110 
probably if that finger is something
so<00:04:34.010> once<00:04:34.190> again<00:04:34.280> I'm<00:04:34.580> letting<00:04:34.850> it<00:04:34.940> push

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:35.120 
so once again I'm letting it push

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.870 
so once again I'm letting it push
towards<00:04:35.450> me<00:04:35.690> that<00:04:35.930> way<00:04:36.290> I'm<00:04:36.620> not<00:04:37.040> in<00:04:37.310> danger<00:04:37.640> of

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:37.880 
towards me that way I'm not in danger of

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.570 
towards me that way I'm not in danger of
their<00:04:38.060> jungler<00:04:38.440> I'm<00:04:39.440> actually<00:04:39.680> going<00:04:40.130> to<00:04:40.370> try

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:40.580 
their jungler I'm actually going to try

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:43.030 
their jungler I'm actually going to try
it<00:04:40.640> all<00:04:40.820> and<00:04:41.030> I'm<00:04:41.090> here<00:04:41.330> and<00:04:41.920> it<00:04:42.920> was<00:04:43.010> a

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:43.040 
it all and I'm here and it was a

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:47.320 
it all and I'm here and it was a
successful<00:04:43.520> all<00:04:43.850> end<00:04:45.790> so<00:04:46.790> now<00:04:46.910> I'm<00:04:47.210> gonna

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:47.330 
successful all end so now I'm gonna

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:49.720 
successful all end so now I'm gonna
shove<00:04:47.630> this<00:04:47.780> wave<00:04:48.020> out<00:04:48.200> and<00:04:48.440> their<00:04:49.430> jungler

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:49.730 
shove this wave out and their jungler

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:51.730 
shove this wave out and their jungler
could<00:04:50.120> be<00:04:50.270> around<00:04:50.570> the<00:04:50.690> area<00:04:50.960> because<00:04:51.200> like<00:04:51.620> I

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:51.740 
could be around the area because like I

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:53.890 
could be around the area because like I
said<00:04:51.800> you<00:04:51.950> started<00:04:52.310> red<00:04:52.520> buff<00:04:52.700> so<00:04:53.450> rather<00:04:53.660> than

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:53.900 
said you started red buff so rather than

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.620 
said you started red buff so rather than
pushing<00:04:54.290> this<00:04:54.410> next<00:04:54.920> wave<00:04:55.160> which<00:04:56.090> that<00:04:56.510> would

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:56.630 
pushing this next wave which that would

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:59.800 
pushing this next wave which that would
be<00:04:56.750> very<00:04:56.960> greedy<00:04:57.290> of<00:04:57.470> me<00:04:57.680> but<00:04:58.510> their<00:04:59.510> jungler

00:04:59.800 --> 00:04:59.810 
be very greedy of me but their jungler

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:02.230 
be very greedy of me but their jungler
could<00:05:00.020> be<00:05:00.140> here<00:05:00.380> so<00:05:01.220> rather<00:05:01.700> than<00:05:01.910> risking

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.240 
could be here so rather than risking

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.630 
could be here so rather than risking
this<00:05:02.390> I'm<00:05:02.630> just<00:05:02.780> going<00:05:02.960> to<00:05:02.990> back<00:05:03.230> and<00:05:03.470> I'm<00:05:04.220> not

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:04.640 
this I'm just going to back and I'm not

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:05.650 
this I'm just going to back and I'm not
going<00:05:04.850> to<00:05:04.940> be<00:05:05.000> able<00:05:05.060> to<00:05:05.150> get<00:05:05.300> these<00:05:05.450> six

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:05.660 
going to be able to get these six

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:09.940 
going to be able to get these six
minions<00:05:06.160> and<00:05:07.160> yeah<00:05:08.150> so<00:05:09.050> I<00:05:09.080> guess<00:05:09.500> I<00:05:09.620> was<00:05:09.770> just

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:09.950 
minions and yeah so I guess I was just

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:12.970 
minions and yeah so I guess I was just
like<00:05:10.070> my<00:05:10.250> little<00:05:10.400> guide<00:05:10.640> to<00:05:10.790> top<00:05:10.940> lane<00:05:11.980> the

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:12.980 
like my little guide to top lane the

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:14.710 
like my little guide to top lane the
main<00:05:13.190> things<00:05:13.490> to<00:05:13.610> keep<00:05:13.730> track<00:05:13.910> of<00:05:14.270> here<00:05:14.450> is

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:14.720 
main things to keep track of here is

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:17.200 
main things to keep track of here is
always<00:05:15.380> know<00:05:15.650> where<00:05:15.800> the<00:05:15.920> jungler<00:05:16.280> is<00:05:16.460> based

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:17.210 
always know where the jungler is based

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:19.240 
always know where the jungler is based
off<00:05:17.450> of<00:05:17.480> like<00:05:17.840> things<00:05:18.470> you<00:05:18.650> see<00:05:18.830> around<00:05:18.860> them

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:19.250 
off of like things you see around them

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:20.590 
off of like things you see around them
that<00:05:19.370> like<00:05:19.670> if<00:05:19.820> I<00:05:19.910> see<00:05:20.060> your<00:05:20.180> neck<00:05:20.300> goon<00:05:20.480> has

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:20.600 
that like if I see your neck goon has

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.140 
that like if I see your neck goon has
fury<00:05:21.050> from<00:05:21.680> the<00:05:21.770> jungle<00:05:22.100> camps<00:05:22.490> there's<00:05:22.850> a

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:23.150 
fury from the jungle camps there's a

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:26.230 
fury from the jungle camps there's a
good<00:05:23.510> chance<00:05:23.980> their<00:05:24.980> jungler<00:05:25.190> started<00:05:25.580> red<00:05:25.790> if

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:26.240 
good chance their jungler started red if

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.120 
good chance their jungler started red if
I<00:05:26.360> see<00:05:26.510> their<00:05:26.690> bot<00:05:26.900> lane<00:05:27.110> gets<00:05:27.320> to<00:05:27.470> Lane<00:05:27.740> really

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:28.130 
I see their bot lane gets to Lane really

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:28.570 
I see their bot lane gets to Lane really
