who came to me with what turned out to

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.240 
who came to me with what turned out to
be<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.630> earliest<00:00:30.960> wine<00:00:31.349> vessel<00:00:31.859> at<00:00:31.920> the<00:00:32.009> time

that<00:00:32.489> when<00:00:32.610> she<00:00:32.790> brought<00:00:32.969> us<00:00:33.149> this<00:00:33.329> beautiful

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
that when she brought us this beautiful

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.500 
that when she brought us this beautiful
jar<00:00:34.500> when<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.370> reddish<00:00:35.700> deposit<00:00:36.300> on<00:00:36.390> the

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
Zagros Mountains it just made sense that

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.630 
Zagros Mountains it just made sense that
we'd<00:00:43.200> go<00:00:43.350> ahead<00:00:43.590> and<00:00:43.739> try<00:00:43.920> to<00:00:43.980> see<00:00:44.340> if<00:00:44.399> we<00:00:44.520> could

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
we'd go ahead and try to see if we could

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.670 
we'd go ahead and try to see if we could
determine<00:00:45.210> whether<00:00:45.450> we<00:00:45.750> had<00:00:45.930> chemical

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
determine whether we had chemical

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:47.930 
determine whether we had chemical
evidence<00:00:46.920> that<00:00:47.219> this<00:00:47.370> was<00:00:47.430> some<00:00:47.820> of<00:00:47.879> the

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
evidence that this was some of the

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.360 
evidence that this was some of the
earliest<00:00:48.270> wine<00:00:48.600> and<00:00:49.079> it<00:00:49.590> did<00:00:49.739> turn<00:00:49.890> out<00:00:50.070> to<00:00:50.250> be

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
earliest wine and it did turn out to be

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.490 
earliest wine and it did turn out to be
the<00:00:50.520> case<00:00:50.670> and<00:00:51.120> then<00:00:51.629> we<00:00:51.719> just<00:00:51.930> had<00:00:52.050> one<00:00:52.260> sample

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
the case and then we just had one sample

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.299 
the case and then we just had one sample
after<00:00:52.980> another<00:00:53.309> coming<00:00:53.969> to<00:00:54.210> us<00:00:54.329> after<00:00:54.690> that<00:00:54.870> we

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:55.309 
after another coming to us after that we

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:57.680 
after another coming to us after that we
subsequently<00:00:56.309> looked<00:00:56.789> for<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.239> earliest

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
subsequently looked for the earliest

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.410 
subsequently looked for the earliest
barley<00:00:58.350> beer<00:00:58.649> from<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.340> same<00:00:59.550> site<00:00:59.850> in<00:01:00.120> Iran
