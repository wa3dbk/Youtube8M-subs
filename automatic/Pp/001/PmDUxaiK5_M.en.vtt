battery versus the sill lead acid

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:36.770 
battery versus the sill lead acid
battery<00:01:35.880> that's<00:01:36.030> in<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.299> classic<00:01:36.750> version

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
battery that's in the classic version

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.960 
battery that's in the classic version
and<00:01:37.229> this<00:01:37.650> program<00:01:37.829> is<00:01:38.159> going<00:01:38.490> to<00:01:38.670> be<00:01:38.759> a<00:01:38.790> lot

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
and this program is going to be a lot

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.609 
and this program is going to be a lot
lighter<00:01:39.270> because<00:01:39.509> of<00:01:39.720> this<00:01:39.780> battery<00:01:40.170> and<00:01:40.500> so

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
lighter because of this battery and so

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:41.810 
lighter because of this battery and so
although<00:01:40.799> all<00:01:41.009> this<00:01:41.130> perverse<00:01:41.490> is<00:01:41.610> going<00:01:41.759> to

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
although all this perverse is going to

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.249 
although all this perverse is going to
cost<00:01:42.000> you<00:01:42.180> nine<00:01:42.360> hundred<00:01:42.720> and<00:01:42.810> forty<00:01:43.110> nine

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
cost you nine hundred and forty nine

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:44.569 
cost you nine hundred and forty nine
dollars<00:01:43.290> so<00:01:43.829> either<00:01:44.009> one<00:01:44.250> of<00:01:44.280> these<00:01:44.399> versions

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
dollars so either one of these versions

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.399 
dollars so either one of these versions
is<00:01:44.850> definitely<00:01:45.210> going<00:01:45.329> to<00:01:45.420> be<00:01:45.509> an<00:01:45.750> investment

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
is definitely going to be an investment

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.020 
is definitely going to be an investment
but<00:01:46.860> I<00:01:46.890> think<00:01:47.040> it's<00:01:47.159> a<00:01:47.189> pretty<00:01:47.430> cool<00:01:47.640> product

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
but I think it's a pretty cool product

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.880 
but I think it's a pretty cool product
for<00:01:48.149> people<00:01:48.450> who<00:01:48.540> may<00:01:48.750> be<00:01:48.810> having<00:01:49.350> a<00:01:49.560> short

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
for people who may be having a short

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.260 
for people who may be having a short
commute<00:01:50.189> they<00:01:50.460> may<00:01:50.579> want<00:01:50.729> to<00:01:50.790> do<00:01:50.909> this<00:01:51.030> instead

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
commute they may want to do this instead

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.910 
commute they may want to do this instead
of<00:01:51.390> having<00:01:51.540> a<00:01:51.659> bike<00:01:51.869> or<00:01:52.110> trying<00:01:52.649> to<00:01:52.710> ride<00:01:52.890> a

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
of having a bike or trying to ride a

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.830 
of having a bike or trying to ride a
real<00:01:53.520> skateboard<00:01:54.119> and<00:01:54.270> this<00:01:54.450> definitely<00:01:54.540> has

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
real skateboard and this definitely has

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.569 
real skateboard and this definitely has
a<00:01:54.899> little<00:01:55.200> bit<00:01:55.290> of<00:01:55.320> a<00:01:55.409> learning<00:01:55.530> curve<00:01:55.770> but<00:01:56.219> I

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
a little bit of a learning curve but I

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:57.560 
a little bit of a learning curve but I
think<00:01:56.759> they<00:01:56.820> did<00:01:56.939> a<00:01:56.969> really<00:01:57.149> good<00:01:57.299> job<00:01:57.360> with

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
think they did a really good job with

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.060 
think they did a really good job with
everything<00:01:58.079> with<00:01:58.259> this<00:01:58.439> board<00:01:58.710> it<00:01:58.799> feels<00:01:58.979> very
