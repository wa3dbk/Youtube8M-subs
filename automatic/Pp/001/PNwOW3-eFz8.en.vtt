00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:49.379 
much that like I said that the standard
sh2<00:04:47.740> version<00:04:48.160> is<00:04:48.280> almost<00:04:48.669> complete<00:04:49.150> all<00:04:49.360> I

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:49.389 
sh2 version is almost complete all I

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:50.879 
sh2 version is almost complete all I
need<00:04:49.660> to<00:04:49.720> be<00:04:49.780> done<00:04:49.900> a<00:04:49.960> second<00:04:50.410> impact<00:04:50.650> is

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:50.889 
need to be done a second impact is

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:53.340 
need to be done a second impact is
actually<00:04:51.220> farther<00:04:51.490> along<00:04:51.729> than<00:04:52.270> the<00:04:52.900> standard

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:53.350 
actually farther along than the standard

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:55.379 
actually farther along than the standard
sh2<00:04:53.919> version<00:04:54.310> which<00:04:54.760> is<00:04:55.000> the<00:04:55.180> normal

00:04:55.379 --> 00:04:55.389 
sh2 version which is the normal

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:58.529 
sh2 version which is the normal
cartridge<00:04:55.960> that<00:04:55.990> Capcom<00:04:56.620> used<00:04:57.370> they<00:04:58.240> sent<00:04:58.479> out
