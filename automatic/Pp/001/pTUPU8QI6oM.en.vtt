and<00:00:00.319> do<00:00:01.319> that<00:00:01.530> will<00:00:01.680> load<00:00:01.890> the<00:00:02.070> edge<00:00:02.250> selection

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:02.580 
and do that will load the edge selection

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.170 
and do that will load the edge selection
selection<00:00:03.270> mode<00:00:03.600> here<00:00:03.840> so<00:00:04.830> let's<00:00:05.040> select<00:00:05.250> this

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
selection mode here so let's select this

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.470 
selection mode here so let's select this
edge<00:00:06.390> here<00:00:06.450> what<00:00:07.259> goods<00:00:07.560> from<00:00:08.460> the<00:00:08.519> armhole

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
edge here what goods from the armhole

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.490 
edge here what goods from the armhole
here<00:00:09.840> to<00:00:10.620> the<00:00:11.179> obvious<00:00:12.179> thing<00:00:12.420> here<00:00:12.690> and<00:00:13.410> I

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
here to the obvious thing here and I

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.140 
here to the obvious thing here and I
want<00:00:13.650> to<00:00:13.740> go<00:00:13.860> take<00:00:14.130> this<00:00:14.340> somewhere<00:00:14.700> and

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
want to go take this somewhere and

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.970 
want to go take this somewhere and
selected<00:00:15.570> right<00:00:15.719> here<00:00:15.929> so<00:00:16.230> I<00:00:16.440> can<00:00:16.529> just<00:00:16.680> flip

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
selected right here so I can just flip

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.830 
selected right here so I can just flip
one<00:00:17.220> and<00:00:17.490> i<00:00:17.580> believe<00:00:17.850> i<00:00:17.880> can<00:00:18.060> just<00:00:18.240> go<00:00:18.390> up<00:00:18.420> here

which is grow connecticut is edges and

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:23.870 
which is grow connecticut is edges and
they<00:00:22.740> will<00:00:22.859> say<00:00:23.039> let's<00:00:23.369> lift<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:23.760> entire

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
they will say let's lift the entire

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.380 
they will say let's lift the entire
thing<00:00:24.470> depending<00:00:25.470> on<00:00:25.619> your<00:00:25.910> makeup<00:00:26.910> separate

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
thing depending on your makeup separate

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.269 
thing depending on your makeup separate
complexity<00:00:28.019> of<00:00:28.050> your<00:00:28.260> modeling<00:00:28.890> this<00:00:29.039> might

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
complexity of your modeling this might

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.179 
complexity of your modeling this might
not<00:00:29.429> work<00:00:29.490> but<00:00:30.029> for<00:00:30.630> me<00:00:30.750> works<00:00:31.019> oh<00:00:31.260> ok<00:00:31.650> it's<00:00:32.009> the

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
not work but for me works oh ok it's the

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.520 
not work but for me works oh ok it's the
same<00:00:32.489> thing<00:00:32.730> oops<00:00:33.300> let's<00:00:33.660> do<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:34.079> same<00:00:34.320> thing

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
same thing oops let's do the same thing

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.040 
same thing oops let's do the same thing
right<00:00:34.680> there<00:00:35.120> so<00:00:36.120> now<00:00:36.210> we<00:00:36.329> are<00:00:36.360> both<00:00:36.719> of<00:00:36.960> those

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
right there so now we are both of those

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.190 
right there so now we are both of those
selected<00:00:38.420> these<00:00:39.420> are<00:00:39.629> pretty<00:00:39.750> much<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:39.899> only

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
selected these are pretty much the only

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.979 
selected these are pretty much the only
seems<00:00:40.890> that<00:00:40.980> he<00:00:41.160> will<00:00:41.280> have<00:00:41.399> to<00:00:41.520> do<00:00:41.989> together

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
seems that he will have to do together

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.160 
seems that he will have to do together
to<00:00:43.680> get<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:43.980> UV<00:00:44.430> slipcase<00:00:45.210> so<00:00:45.450> let's<00:00:45.629> go<00:00:45.809> here

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
to get the UV slipcase so let's go here

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.819 
to get the UV slipcase so let's go here
and<00:00:46.940> you<00:00:47.940> can<00:00:48.090> see<00:00:48.239> now<00:00:48.450> when<00:00:49.079> we<00:00:49.260> selected

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
and you can see now when we selected

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.220 
and you can see now when we selected
those<00:00:50.010> edges<00:00:50.640> we<00:00:50.940> also<00:00:51.090> selected<00:00:51.600> those<00:00:51.750> edges

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
those edges we also selected those edges

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.410 
those edges we also selected those edges
and<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.649> UV<00:00:53.100> texture<00:00:53.399> editor<00:00:53.520> because<00:00:54.059> all

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420

at all ah that's because we have it

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.960 
at all ah that's because we have it
unwrapped<00:01:34.259> it<00:01:34.409> yet<00:01:34.470> which<00:01:34.890> is<00:01:34.920> say<00:01:35.520> that<00:01:35.790> we

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
unwrapped it yet which is say that we

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.170 
unwrapped it yet which is say that we
haven't<00:01:36.180> unfold<00:01:36.900> if<00:01:37.229> you<00:01:37.350> so<00:01:37.740> way<00:01:38.430> to<00:01:38.820> do<00:01:38.939> that

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
haven't unfold if you so way to do that

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.380 
haven't unfold if you so way to do that
will<00:01:39.450> go<00:01:39.689> into<00:01:39.810> you<00:01:40.170> be<00:01:40.320> sketchy<00:01:40.619> road

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
will go into you be sketchy road

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.190 
will go into you be sketchy road
actually<00:01:42.390> will<00:01:42.540> go<00:01:42.689> into<00:01:42.810> this<00:01:43.290> Widow<00:01:43.590> here

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
actually will go into this Widow here

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.590 
actually will go into this Widow here
and<00:01:46.200> we'll<00:01:46.530> go<00:01:46.680> to<00:01:46.740> UV<00:01:47.189> section<00:01:47.549> 1<00:01:47.700> movies

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
and we'll go to UV section 1 movies

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.600 
and we'll go to UV section 1 movies
basically<00:01:49.110> they<00:01:49.229> look<00:01:49.470> like<00:01:49.649> vs<00:01:50.130> but<00:01:50.430> they

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
basically they look like vs but they

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.359 
basically they look like vs but they
don't<00:01:51.299> add<00:01:51.509> tech<00:01:51.810> vs<00:01:52.259> they<00:01:52.470> are<00:01:52.590> movie

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
don't add tech vs they are movie

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.929 
don't add tech vs they are movie
specific<00:01:53.549> the<00:01:54.000> represent<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:54.750> points<00:01:55.490> the<00:01:56.490> UV

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
specific the represent the points the UV

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.399 
specific the represent the points the UV
points<00:01:57.420> basically<00:01:57.630> so<00:01:59.479> to<00:02:00.479> do<00:02:00.630> this<00:02:00.659> if<00:02:01.140> we

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
points basically so to do this if we

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.109 
points basically so to do this if we
just<00:02:01.619> add<00:02:01.770> rapid<00:02:02.130> life<00:02:02.310> I<00:02:02.430> see<00:02:02.579> this<00:02:02.790> sort<00:02:03.060> of

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
just add rapid life I see this sort of

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.420 
just add rapid life I see this sort of
like<00:02:03.329> all<00:02:03.540> right<00:02:03.689> here<00:02:04.020> or<00:02:04.200> go<00:02:04.590> to<00:02:04.649> polygons

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
like all right here or go to polygons

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.309 
like all right here or go to polygons
and<00:02:05.670> then<00:02:06.030> unwrap<00:02:06.450> or<00:02:07.160> unfold<00:02:08.160> rather<00:02:08.640> um<00:02:09.319> you

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
and then unwrap or unfold rather um you

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.199 
and then unwrap or unfold rather um you
see<00:02:10.500> what<00:02:10.649> happens<00:02:11.069> here<00:02:11.220> we<00:02:11.340> get<00:02:11.520> this<00:02:11.819> which

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
see what happens here we get this which

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:14.030 
see what happens here we get this which
this<00:02:13.050> is<00:02:13.200> ok<00:02:13.680> if<00:02:13.890> you

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
this is ok if you

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.259 
this is ok if you
CD<00:02:14.340> player<00:02:14.640> it<00:02:15.150> is<00:02:15.329> a<00:02:15.360> very<00:02:15.780> nice<00:02:16.170> pattern<00:02:16.769> d

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:17.269 
CD player it is a very nice pattern d

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:20.869 
CD player it is a very nice pattern d
the<00:02:18.269> little<00:02:18.840> things<00:02:19.109> here<00:02:19.379> or<00:02:19.439> go<00:02:20.340> fix<00:02:20.790> the

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:20.879 
the little things here or go fix the

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:23.420 
the little things here or go fix the
checkers<00:02:21.510> here<00:02:21.750> are<00:02:21.900> very<00:02:22.530> square<00:02:22.890> and<00:02:23.159> they

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
checkers here are very square and they

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.459 
checkers here are very square and they
actually<00:02:23.819> don't<00:02:24.329> have<00:02:24.540> any<00:02:24.719> real<00:02:25.019> a<00:02:25.049> storage

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:25.469 
actually don't have any real a storage

00:02:25.469 --> 00:02:27.890 
actually don't have any real a storage
it'll<00:02:25.709> go<00:02:25.859> well<00:02:26.790> not<00:02:27.030> that<00:02:27.209> much<00:02:27.239> this<00:02:27.719> one

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
it'll go well not that much this one

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.059 
it'll go well not that much this one
last<00:02:28.109> bit<00:02:28.379> but<00:02:28.650> that<00:02:28.920> was<00:02:29.069> we<00:02:29.219> can<00:02:29.370> fix<00:02:29.549> later

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:31.069 
last bit but that was we can fix later

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:34.520 
last bit but that was we can fix later
so<00:02:32.069> that's<00:02:32.730> pretty<00:02:33.000> that's<00:02:33.500> prettier<00:02:34.500> eyes

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
so that's pretty that's prettier eyes

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.250 
so that's pretty that's prettier eyes
right<00:02:34.890> but<00:02:35.220> as<00:02:35.430> you<00:02:35.670> see<00:02:35.879> here<00:02:36.060> the<00:02:36.810> back<00:02:37.230> is

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
right but as you see here the back is

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.479 
right but as you see here the back is
much<00:02:37.769> smaller<00:02:38.159> which<00:02:38.640> that<00:02:39.629> the<00:02:39.859> front<00:02:40.859> which

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
much smaller which that the front which

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:43.670 
much smaller which that the front which
creates<00:02:41.909> that's<00:02:42.359> why<00:02:42.540> the<00:02:42.599> checks<00:02:43.409> are<00:02:43.530> so

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
creates that's why the checks are so

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.530 
creates that's why the checks are so
huge<00:02:43.950> on<00:02:44.250> the<00:02:44.310> back<00:02:44.549> here<00:02:44.790> and<00:02:45.120> that<00:02:45.510> means

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
huge on the back here and that means

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.479 
huge on the back here and that means
that<00:02:45.900> we<00:02:46.049> have<00:02:46.079> less<00:02:46.709> texture<00:02:47.370> resolution

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
that we have less texture resolution

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:51.259 
that we have less texture resolution
work<00:02:48.239> on<00:02:48.420> the<00:02:48.510> back<00:02:48.689> and<00:02:49.879> that's<00:02:50.879> bad

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
work on the back and that's bad

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:53.539 
work on the back and that's bad
basically<00:02:51.959> that's<00:02:52.079> real<00:02:52.319> bad<00:02:52.560> we<00:02:53.220> want<00:02:53.400> to

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:53.549 
basically that's real bad we want to

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:56.089 
basically that's real bad we want to
have<00:02:53.669> generally<00:02:54.209> the<00:02:54.419> same<00:02:54.720> size<00:02:55.560> on<00:02:55.919> the

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:56.099 
have generally the same size on the

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:57.979 
have generally the same size on the
front<00:02:56.549> and<00:02:56.700> the<00:02:56.970> back<00:02:57.000> so<00:02:57.419> we<00:02:57.510> can<00:02:57.629> have<00:02:57.810> the

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
front and the back so we can have the

00:02:57.989 --> 00:02:59.960 
front and the back so we can have the
same<00:02:58.230> amount<00:02:58.590> of<00:02:58.650> quality<00:02:58.980> all<00:02:59.400> our<00:02:59.549> texture

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
same amount of quality all our texture

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.679 
same amount of quality all our texture
only<00:03:00.389> something<00:03:01.109> back<00:03:01.290> so<00:03:02.099> today<00:03:03.030> let's<00:03:03.329> undo

00:03:03.679 --> 00:03:03.689 
only something back so today let's undo

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:06.319 
only something back so today let's undo
that<00:03:03.900> and<00:03:04.079> let's<00:03:05.040> just<00:03:05.159> say<00:03:05.459> here<00:03:06.000> we<00:03:06.150> select

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:06.329 
that and let's just say here we select

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:09.349 
that and let's just say here we select
the<00:03:06.870> top<00:03:07.379> 16<00:03:07.829> list<00:03:08.099> we<00:03:08.489> only<00:03:08.639> use<00:03:08.879> section<00:03:09.239> but

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:09.359 
the top 16 list we only use section but

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:12.319 
the top 16 list we only use section but
let's<00:03:09.569> make<00:03:09.629> sure<00:03:09.750> that<00:03:10.400> let's<00:03:11.400> deselect<00:03:11.879> or

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:12.329 
let's make sure that let's deselect or

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:16.280 
let's make sure that let's deselect or
pin<00:03:12.959> this<00:03:13.560> which<00:03:14.069> is<00:03:14.220> the<00:03:14.250> uppermost<00:03:15.030> and<00:03:15.450> the

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
pin this which is the uppermost and the

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.439 
pin this which is the uppermost and the
bottommost<00:03:16.919> on<00:03:17.189> all<00:03:17.459> the<00:03:17.609> front<00:03:17.909> here<00:03:18.120> so<00:03:18.329> this

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:18.449 
bottommost on all the front here so this

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:21.890 
bottommost on all the front here so this
basic<00:03:19.409> that<00:03:19.819> what<00:03:20.819> you<00:03:20.909> will<00:03:21.000> do<00:03:21.150> now<00:03:21.359> is<00:03:21.599> this

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
basic that what you will do now is this

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.080 
basic that what you will do now is this
will<00:03:22.590> actually<00:03:22.769> change<00:03:23.340> these<00:03:23.639> to<00:03:23.940> its

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
will actually change these to its

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.439 
will actually change these to its
location<00:03:24.299> so<00:03:24.900> when<00:03:25.470> you<00:03:25.590> are<00:03:25.650> unfolded<00:03:26.579> those

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:27.449 
location so when you are unfolded those

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:31.309 
location so when you are unfolded those
two<00:03:27.840> won't<00:03:28.349> actually<00:03:28.680> move<00:03:29.720> so<00:03:30.720> you<00:03:31.169> will<00:03:31.260> see

00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:31.319 
two won't actually move so you will see

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:33.530 
two won't actually move so you will see
here<00:03:31.680> when<00:03:31.949> you<00:03:32.040> got<00:03:32.190> to<00:03:32.310> wrap<00:03:32.489> this<00:03:32.540> or

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
here when you got to wrap this or

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.129 
here when you got to wrap this or
passaic<00:03:34.019> on<00:03:34.199> it<00:03:34.470> looks<00:03:34.650> much<00:03:34.919> better<00:03:35.159> actually

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:36.139 
passaic on it looks much better actually

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:38.659 
passaic on it looks much better actually
if<00:03:37.139> you<00:03:37.440> can<00:03:37.590> see<00:03:37.709> that<00:03:37.859> this<00:03:38.129> has<00:03:38.430> much<00:03:38.639> more

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:38.669 
if you can see that this has much more

00:03:38.669 --> 00:03:41.569 
if you can see that this has much more
even<00:03:39.090> and<00:03:39.389> this<00:03:40.019> is<00:03:40.169> actually<00:03:40.530> a<00:03:40.560> bit<00:03:41.129> larger

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:41.579 
even and this is actually a bit larger

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:44.330 
even and this is actually a bit larger
and<00:03:41.840> now<00:03:42.840> you<00:03:42.900> can<00:03:43.139> see<00:03:43.290> that<00:03:43.319> we<00:03:43.590> have<00:03:43.620> a<00:03:44.010> nice

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
and now you can see that we have a nice

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.729 
and now you can see that we have a nice
even<00:03:44.790> texture<00:03:45.269> right<00:03:45.389> here<00:03:45.629> but<00:03:46.440> as<00:03:46.560> you<00:03:46.650> can

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
even texture right here but as you can

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:49.159 
even texture right here but as you can
see<00:03:46.919> these<00:03:47.129> are<00:03:47.190> still<00:03:47.519> way<00:03:47.849> larger<00:03:48.209> than<00:03:48.540> this

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:49.169 
see these are still way larger than this

00:03:49.169 --> 00:03:54.469 
see these are still way larger than this
which<00:03:50.010> we<00:03:50.400> cannot<00:03:50.669> fix<00:03:51.680> by<00:03:53.120> first<00:03:54.120> of<00:03:54.239> all<00:03:54.299> you

00:03:54.469 --> 00:03:54.479 
which we cannot fix by first of all you

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:57.020 
which we cannot fix by first of all you
can<00:03:54.599> just<00:03:54.780> take<00:03:55.199> this<00:03:55.440> mercy<00:03:56.010> here<00:03:56.280> and<00:03:56.760> we<00:03:56.879> can

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
can just take this mercy here and we can

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.659 
can just take this mercy here and we can
pull<00:03:57.750> up<00:03:57.959> a<00:03:58.229> little<00:03:58.409> bit<00:03:58.590> maybe<00:03:58.889> a<00:03:59.040> light<00:03:59.400> up

00:03:59.659 --> 00:03:59.669 
pull up a little bit maybe a light up

00:03:59.669 --> 00:04:02.599 
pull up a little bit maybe a light up
there<00:03:59.849> and<00:04:00.389> as<00:04:01.049> always<00:04:01.290> look<00:04:01.650> we're<00:04:01.979> now<00:04:02.250> but

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:02.609 
there and as always look we're now but

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:04.520 
there and as always look we're now but
it<00:04:02.760> won't<00:04:02.879> better<00:04:03.269> right<00:04:03.449> now<00:04:03.659> that<00:04:04.109> look

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
it won't better right now that look

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.670 
it won't better right now that look
right<00:04:04.650> now<00:04:04.859> later<00:04:05.189> on<00:04:05.810> so<00:04:06.810> let's<00:04:06.989> also<00:04:07.439> sit

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
right now later on so let's also sit

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.089 
right now later on so let's also sit
this<00:04:07.919> one<00:04:08.479> because<00:04:09.479> we<00:04:09.900> warm<00:04:10.139> up<00:04:10.319> on<00:04:10.560> this<00:04:10.829> one

00:04:11.089 --> 00:04:11.099 
this one because we warm up on this one

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:14.179 
this one because we warm up on this one
to<00:04:11.250> freak<00:04:11.579> when<00:04:11.609> we<00:04:12.060> shrink<00:04:12.900> when<00:04:13.349> we<00:04:13.829> will

00:04:14.179 --> 00:04:14.189 
to freak when we shrink when we will

00:04:14.189 --> 00:04:17.360 
to freak when we shrink when we will
enlarge<00:04:14.519> this<00:04:14.819> one<00:04:15.090> so<00:04:16.049> let's<00:04:16.560> also<00:04:16.799> slipped

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
enlarge this one so let's also slipped

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:22.610 
enlarge this one so let's also slipped
the<00:04:17.789> same<00:04:18.030> well<00:04:18.239> step<00:04:18.630> we<00:04:18.810> did<00:04:19.019> before<00:04:20.810> so<00:04:21.810> so

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
the same well step we did before so so

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.790 
the same well step we did before so so
strict<00:04:22.919> that<00:04:23.159> one<00:04:23.479> and<00:04:24.479> now<00:04:25.349> I<00:04:25.380> don't<00:04:25.560> have

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
strict that one and now I don't have

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.620 
strict that one and now I don't have
these<00:04:26.070> so<00:04:26.400> we<00:04:26.490> have<00:04:26.610> 2<00:04:26.760> inverse

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
these so we have 2 inverse

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:30.800 
these so we have 2 inverse
this<00:04:27.780> lecture<00:04:28.260> so<00:04:28.620> the<00:04:29.160> solar<00:04:29.490> shift<00:04:29.850> a<00:04:30.120> dragon

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
this lecture so the solar shift a dragon

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:33.080 
this lecture so the solar shift a dragon
this<00:04:30.960> will<00:04:31.140> inverse<00:04:31.530> the<00:04:31.800> selection<00:04:31.830> so<00:04:32.460> now

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.090 
this will inverse the selection so now

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:34.880 
this will inverse the selection so now
we<00:04:33.150> have<00:04:33.240> everything<00:04:33.810> but<00:04:34.080> those<00:04:34.410> selected

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:34.890 
we have everything but those selected

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:37.490 
we have everything but those selected
which<00:04:35.160> will<00:04:35.400> pin<00:04:35.640> them<00:04:36.110> so<00:04:37.110> let's<00:04:37.260> press

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
which will pin them so let's press

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.950 
which will pin them so let's press
unfold<00:04:37.980> here<00:04:38.160> and<00:04:38.610> because<00:04:39.390> you<00:04:39.510> know<00:04:39.660> the

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 
unfold here and because you know the

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.320 
unfold here and because you know the
back<00:04:40.290> is<00:04:40.590> much<00:04:40.920> more<00:04:41.160> likely<00:04:41.430> from<00:04:41.820> the<00:04:42.150> back

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
back is much more likely from the back

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:45.290 
back is much more likely from the back
is<00:04:42.480> much<00:04:42.720> larger<00:04:42.990> and<00:04:43.380> it<00:04:44.070> is<00:04:44.250> is<00:04:44.670> still<00:04:45.270> a

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 
is much larger and it is is still a

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.350 
is much larger and it is is still a
little<00:04:45.540> bit<00:04:45.720> too<00:04:45.900> big<00:04:46.140> so<00:04:46.470> I'm<00:04:46.740> not<00:04:46.950> just<00:04:47.360> going

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 
little bit too big so I'm not just going

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.450 
little bit too big so I'm not just going
through<00:04:48.660> and<00:04:48.870> pull<00:04:49.350> this<00:04:49.470> up<00:04:49.650> a<00:04:49.710> little<00:04:50.160> bit

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
through and pull this up a little bit

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:54.530 
through and pull this up a little bit
more<00:04:50.810> time<00:04:51.810> with<00:04:52.020> answer<00:04:52.560> that<00:04:52.680> they<00:04:52.860> say<00:04:53.540> yuly

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:54.540 
more time with answer that they say yuly

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:58.370 
more time with answer that they say yuly
search<00:04:54.870> for<00:04:55.460> inverse<00:04:56.460> and<00:04:56.880> unwrapped<00:04:57.870> so<00:04:58.230> now

00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:58.380 
search for inverse and unwrapped so now

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:00.080 
search for inverse and unwrapped so now
now<00:04:58.800> they're<00:04:59.070> pretty<00:04:59.370> much<00:04:59.490> the<00:04:59.730> backs<00:04:59.940> a

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.090 
now they're pretty much the backs a

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:03.530 
now they're pretty much the backs a
little<00:05:00.330> bigger<00:05:00.810> but<00:05:01.020> that's<00:05:01.230> no<00:05:01.380> problem<00:05:02.540> so

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:03.540 
little bigger but that's no problem so

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:05.630 
little bigger but that's no problem so
as<00:05:03.990> you<00:05:04.110> can<00:05:04.200> see<00:05:04.350> now<00:05:04.500> you<00:05:04.800> have<00:05:04.980> it<00:05:05.160> is<00:05:05.340> even

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:05.640 
as you can see now you have it is even

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:08.750 
as you can see now you have it is even
chicken<00:05:06.360> pattern<00:05:06.690> all<00:05:06.870> over<00:05:06.900> the<00:05:07.410> place<00:05:07.760> and

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:08.760 
chicken pattern all over the place and

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:13.280 
chicken pattern all over the place and
one<00:05:09.540> here<00:05:10.140> but<00:05:10.670> that's<00:05:11.670> really<00:05:12.630> bargainer

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:13.290 
one here but that's really bargainer

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:14.810 
one here but that's really bargainer
distortion<00:05:13.890> which<00:05:13.980> we<00:05:14.190> can<00:05:14.340> actually<00:05:14.610> live

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:14.820 
distortion which we can actually live

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:17.900 
distortion which we can actually live
with<00:05:15.350> just<00:05:16.350> for<00:05:17.040> the<00:05:17.130> sake<00:05:17.370> of<00:05:17.400> it<00:05:17.550> i'll<00:05:17.670> go

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:17.910 
with just for the sake of it i'll go

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:20.290 
with just for the sake of it i'll go
through<00:05:18.180> and<00:05:18.330> select<00:05:18.600> several<00:05:19.020> couple<00:05:19.890> horses

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:20.300 
through and select several couple horses

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.610 
through and select several couple horses
versus<00:05:21.300> a<00:05:21.420> couple<00:05:21.660> of<00:05:21.780> UV<00:05:22.080> set<00:05:22.320> a<00:05:22.350> time<00:05:22.590> and

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:22.620 
versus a couple of UV set a time and

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:28.460 
versus a couple of UV set a time and
unwrap<00:05:23.250> them<00:05:25.250> so<00:05:26.250> okay<00:05:26.850> there<00:05:27.060> we<00:05:27.210> go<00:05:27.470> it's

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:28.470 
unwrap them so okay there we go it's

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:30.590 
unwrap them so okay there we go it's
pretty<00:05:28.680> much<00:05:28.800> it<00:05:28.980> for<00:05:29.010> this<00:05:29.220> coil<00:05:29.970> actually<00:05:30.450> we

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:30.600 
pretty much it for this coil actually we

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.410 
pretty much it for this coil actually we
have<00:05:30.810> the<00:05:31.080> complete<00:05:31.980> auto<00:05:32.190> draft<00:05:32.640> organic

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:33.420 
have the complete auto draft organic

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:36.530 
have the complete auto draft organic
pieces<00:05:33.780> are<00:05:33.990> easier<00:05:34.560> to<00:05:34.590> unwrap<00:05:35.010> they<00:05:35.280> are<00:05:35.430> I<00:05:36.060> i

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:36.540 
pieces are easier to unwrap they are I i

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:38.420 
pieces are easier to unwrap they are I i
liked<00:05:36.810> called<00:05:37.080> come<00:05:37.320> rapido<00:05:37.860> to<00:05:37.920> UV<00:05:38.220> map

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:38.430 
liked called come rapido to UV map

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:41.150 
liked called come rapido to UV map
because<00:05:38.820> you've<00:05:39.060> FS<00:05:39.510> i<00:05:39.720> know<00:05:40.170> i<00:05:40.500> would<00:05:40.860> like<00:05:40.980> to

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:41.160 
because you've FS i know i would like to

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:44.120 
because you've FS i know i would like to
say<00:05:41.340> that<00:05:41.520> I<00:05:41.730> think<00:05:42.120> that<00:05:42.600> unwrapped<00:05:43.500> sounds

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:44.130 
say that I think that unwrapped sounds

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:47.960 
say that I think that unwrapped sounds
tells<00:05:44.400> you<00:05:44.640> so<00:05:45.360> hit<00:05:45.690> no<00:05:45.900> mine<00:05:46.790> so<00:05:47.790> that's

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:47.970 
tells you so hit no mine so that's

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:49.340 
tells you so hit no mine so that's
pretty<00:05:48.120> much<00:05:48.180> it<00:05:48.270> for<00:05:48.420> this<00:05:48.600> story<00:05:49.050> I<00:05:49.110> would

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:49.350 
pretty much it for this story I would

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:51.770 
pretty much it for this story I would
make<00:05:49.500> another<00:05:50.340> tutorial<00:05:50.700> for<00:05:51.060> the<00:05:51.180> lace<00:05:51.450> and

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:51.780 
make another tutorial for the lace and

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:54.080 
make another tutorial for the lace and
one<00:05:51.930> for<00:05:52.110> the<00:05:52.170> arms<00:05:52.560> as<00:05:52.710> well<00:05:52.860> and<00:05:53.580> white<00:05:53.880> one

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:54.090 
one for the arms as well and white one

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:56.720 
one for the arms as well and white one
for<00:05:54.120> a<00:05:54.330> chance<00:05:54.570> so<00:05:54.960> get<00:05:55.230> ready<00:05:56.040> pretty<00:05:56.400> much<00:05:56.550> it

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:56.730 
for a chance so get ready pretty much it

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:59.960 
for a chance so get ready pretty much it
