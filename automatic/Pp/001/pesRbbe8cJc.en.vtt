00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
in the moment I feel bad now I'm going

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.800

beliefs that are in your future they do

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.910 
beliefs that are in your future they do
become<00:01:23.040> beliefs<00:01:23.430> now<00:01:23.790> that<00:01:24.479> your<00:01:24.659> brain<00:01:25.080> puts

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
become beliefs now that your brain puts

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.980 
become beliefs now that your brain puts
in<00:01:26.189> that<00:01:26.340> deepest<00:01:26.820> place<00:01:27.090> where<00:01:27.570> you<00:01:27.689> carry

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
in that deepest place where you carry

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.929 
in that deepest place where you carry
your<00:01:28.110> core<00:01:28.380> beliefs<00:01:28.680> and<00:01:28.890> as<00:01:29.430> a<00:01:29.460> result<00:01:29.670> of

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
your core beliefs and as a result of

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.359 
your core beliefs and as a result of
those<00:01:30.119> beliefs<00:01:30.479> you<00:01:30.990> create<00:01:31.290> values<00:01:31.770> that

those beliefs you create values that

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.280 
those beliefs you create values that
support<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:32.820> beliefs<00:01:33.119> those<00:01:33.540> values<00:01:33.960> create

behaviors and those behaviors create the

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.249

future and you have created specific

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.560 
future and you have created specific
things<00:02:16.860> that<00:02:16.980> you<00:02:17.160> want<00:02:17.430> you<00:02:17.820> also<00:02:18.330> when<00:02:18.480> you

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
things that you want you also when you

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.080 
things that you want you also when you
go<00:02:18.750> into<00:02:18.930> these<00:02:19.140> future<00:02:19.500> points<00:02:19.950> you<00:02:20.430> discover

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
go into these future points you discover

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.630 
go into these future points you discover
things<00:02:21.420> that<00:02:21.690> maybe<00:02:21.870> you<00:02:22.080> weren't<00:02:22.260> expecting

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
things that maybe you weren't expecting

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.000 
things that maybe you weren't expecting
certain<00:02:23.640> feelings<00:02:24.360> or<00:02:24.890> accomplishments<00:02:25.890> or

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
certain feelings or accomplishments or

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.490 
certain feelings or accomplishments or
or<00:02:26.280> just<00:02:26.910> ways<00:02:27.300> of<00:02:27.510> seeing<00:02:27.780> the<00:02:27.990> world<00:02:28.020> that

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
or just ways of seeing the world that

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.560 
or just ways of seeing the world that
you<00:02:28.620> couldn't<00:02:29.010> even<00:02:29.220> conceive<00:02:29.760> of<00:02:29.820> right<00:02:30.330> now

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
you couldn't even conceive of right now

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:33.670 
you couldn't even conceive of right now
so<00:02:31.290> now<00:02:31.560> you<00:02:31.620> put<00:02:32.040> these<00:02:32.190> points<00:02:32.640> in<00:02:32.760> time<00:02:32.940> like

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
so now you put these points in time like

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.010 
so now you put these points in time like
like<00:02:34.680> 30<00:02:35.010> days<00:02:35.280> 60<00:02:35.790> days<00:02:35.910> six<00:02:36.390> months<00:02:36.750> one<00:02:36.990> year

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:38.870 
like 30 days 60 days six months one year
five<00:02:37.590> years<00:02:37.860> in<00:02:38.010> the<00:02:38.130> future<00:02:38.310> and<00:02:38.670> you<00:02:38.730> go<00:02:38.850> and

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
five years in the future and you go and

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.940 
five years in the future and you go and
visit<00:02:39.270> them<00:02:39.570> it's<00:02:39.750> like<00:02:39.840> you<00:02:40.020> drop<00:02:40.440> into<00:02:40.830> them

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
visit them it's like you drop into them

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.790 
visit them it's like you drop into them
every<00:02:41.670> time<00:02:41.940> you<00:02:42.150> do<00:02:42.360> that<00:02:42.630> you<00:02:43.170> are<00:02:43.290> creating

that even by just imagining it and this

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.090 
that even by just imagining it and this
is<00:03:27.269> the<00:03:27.390> coolest<00:03:27.630> part<00:03:28.019> of<00:03:28.049> the<00:03:28.140> research<00:03:28.500> is

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
is the coolest part of the research is

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:31.280 
is the coolest part of the research is
it<00:03:29.370> just<00:03:29.730> by<00:03:29.880> imagining<00:03:30.720> these<00:03:30.959> things

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
it just by imagining these things

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.530 
it just by imagining these things
happening<00:03:31.799> your<00:03:32.370> brain<00:03:32.670> starts<00:03:33.030> to<00:03:33.239> change

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
happening your brain starts to change

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.740 
happening your brain starts to change
it's<00:03:33.810> like<00:03:33.989> an<00:03:34.140> athlete<00:03:34.709> who<00:03:35.750> visualizes

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
it's like an athlete who visualizes

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.990 
it's like an athlete who visualizes
making<00:03:37.200> baskets<00:03:37.440> or<00:03:37.890> visualizes<00:03:38.640> a<00:03:38.670> golf

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
making baskets or visualizes a golf

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.030 
making baskets or visualizes a golf
swing<00:03:39.239> and<00:03:39.360> they<00:03:39.570> get<00:03:39.690> so<00:03:40.080> much<00:03:40.410> better<00:03:40.739> almost

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
swing and they get so much better almost

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.190 
swing and they get so much better almost
instantly<00:03:41.730> because<00:03:42.630> they<00:03:42.750> built<00:03:43.049> these

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
instantly because they built these

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.970 
instantly because they built these
neural<00:03:43.530> networks<00:03:43.890> now<00:03:44.070> what<00:03:44.280> I<00:03:44.310> think<00:03:44.760> is<00:03:45.000> that

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980 
neural networks now what I think is that

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:51.500 
neural networks now what I think is that
it<00:03:46.980> happens<00:03:47.430> so<00:03:47.760> fast<00:03:48.410> and<00:03:49.410> it<00:03:50.010> happens<00:03:50.549> faster

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
it happens so fast and it happens faster

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.410 
it happens so fast and it happens faster
than<00:03:51.660> we<00:03:51.840> even<00:03:51.870> can<00:03:52.560> imagine<00:03:52.860> it<00:03:53.190> happening

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
than we even can imagine it happening

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:56.300 
than we even can imagine it happening
that's<00:03:54.420> why<00:03:54.660> people<00:03:54.900> get<00:03:55.230> over<00:03:55.530> depression<00:03:55.560> so

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
that's why people get over depression so

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.310 
that's why people get over depression so
quickly<00:03:56.760> or<00:03:56.970> they<00:03:57.000> get<00:03:57.269> over<00:03:57.510> their<00:03:57.660> anxiety

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:58.320 
quickly or they get over their anxiety

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.580 
quickly or they get over their anxiety
or<00:03:58.530> they<00:03:59.220> go<00:03:59.489> like<00:03:59.940> in<00:04:00.180> one<00:04:00.930> or<00:04:01.110> two<00:04:01.140> or<00:04:01.380> three

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
or they go like in one or two or three

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.410 
or they go like in one or two or three
days<00:04:01.620> all<00:04:02.130> the<00:04:02.340> sudden<00:04:02.549> their<00:04:02.730> life<00:04:02.880> changes

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
days all the sudden their life changes

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.539 
days all the sudden their life changes
and<00:04:03.570> I<00:04:04.080> also<00:04:04.290> think<00:04:04.680> that<00:04:04.799> because<00:04:05.190> the<00:04:05.340> way

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:05.549 
and I also think that because the way

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:09.890 
and I also think that because the way
that<00:04:05.790> I<00:04:05.850> create<00:04:06.630> these<00:04:07.019> programs<00:04:07.790> I<00:04:08.900> just

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
that I create these programs I just

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.100 
that I create these programs I just
infuse<00:04:10.769> your<00:04:11.100> brain<00:04:11.430> and<00:04:11.850> your<00:04:12.150> soul<00:04:12.570> and<00:04:12.900> your

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.110 
infuse your brain and your soul and your

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:16.009 
infuse your brain and your soul and your
core<00:04:13.590> beliefs<00:04:14.100> with<00:04:15.090> all<00:04:15.299> of<00:04:15.600> the<00:04:15.690> things<00:04:15.870> that

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019 
core beliefs with all of the things that

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:17.870 
core beliefs with all of the things that
you<00:04:16.200> need<00:04:16.440> to<00:04:16.500> create<00:04:16.950> the<00:04:17.160> most<00:04:17.459> massive

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
you need to create the most massive

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.050 
you need to create the most massive
neural<00:04:18.419> network<00:04:18.870> and<00:04:19.140> then<00:04:20.100> create<00:04:20.579> triggers

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
neural network and then create triggers

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:22.730 
neural network and then create triggers
that<00:04:21.090> that<00:04:21.780> trigger<00:04:22.109> it<00:04:22.289> so<00:04:22.470> that<00:04:22.620> you're

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
that that trigger it so that you're

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.860 
that that trigger it so that you're
operating<00:04:23.640> off<00:04:23.910> of<00:04:23.940> those<00:04:24.210> feelings<00:04:24.479> and

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
operating off of those feelings and

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.130 
of the way that I do it I think that it

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:31.880 
of the way that I do it I think that it
just<00:04:29.310> happens<00:04:29.700> so<00:04:30.060> quickly<00:04:30.390> and<00:04:30.780> you<00:04:31.620> know<00:04:31.710> and

in when your brain changes it changes

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:26.900 
in when your brain changes it changes
the<00:06:24.210> chemicals<00:06:24.840> that<00:06:24.960> flood<00:06:25.530> your<00:06:25.740> body<00:06:25.910> when

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:34.080 
chemicals of depression there's these

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:35.600 
chemicals of depression there's these
receptor<00:06:34.620> sites<00:06:34.830> on<00:06:34.980> the<00:06:35.010> cells<00:06:35.310> and<00:06:35.520> we're

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:35.610 
receptor sites on the cells and we're

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:37.010 
receptor sites on the cells and we're
learning<00:06:35.760> that<00:06:36.030> receptor<00:06:36.510> sites<00:06:36.720> are<00:06:36.900> the

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:37.020 
learning that receptor sites are the

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:39.260 
learning that receptor sites are the
brain<00:06:37.290> of<00:06:37.320> the<00:06:37.560> cell<00:06:37.770> these<00:06:38.550> receptor<00:06:39.060> sites

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:39.270 
brain of the cell these receptor sites

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:40.100 
brain of the cell these receptor sites
suck<00:06:39.660> in<00:06:39.900> all

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:40.110 
suck in all

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:41.570 
suck in all
the<00:06:40.200> chemicals<00:06:40.680> of<00:06:40.800> depression<00:06:41.310> and<00:06:41.430> that's

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:41.580 
the chemicals of depression and that's

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:44.000 
the chemicals of depression and that's
what<00:06:41.790> feeds<00:06:42.060> that<00:06:42.300> gene<00:06:42.660> that<00:06:43.200> tells<00:06:43.500> the<00:06:43.710> gene

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:44.010 
what feeds that gene that tells the gene

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:47.990 
what feeds that gene that tells the gene
how<00:06:44.400> to<00:06:44.460> code<00:06:44.820> itself<00:06:46.010> is<00:06:47.010> it<00:06:47.280> make<00:06:47.430> sense<00:06:47.700> it's

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:48.000 
how to code itself is it make sense it's

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.930 
how to code itself is it make sense it's
so<00:06:48.270> cool<00:06:48.510> high<00:06:48.690> five<00:06:48.960> yeah<00:06:49.350> I<00:06:49.640> know<00:06:50.640> I<00:06:50.700> get
