the<00:01:40.560> words<00:01:40.770> but<00:01:41.490> at<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.759> same<00:01:41.939> time<00:01:42.180> it's<00:01:42.420> like

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
the words but at the same time it's like

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.270 
the words but at the same time it's like
well<00:01:42.810> I<00:01:42.869> still<00:01:43.110> see<00:01:43.259> my<00:01:43.380> avatar<00:01:43.860> in<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.009> screen

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
well I still see my avatar in the screen

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.980 
well I still see my avatar in the screen
so<00:01:44.430> I<00:01:44.460> guess<00:01:44.670> I'll<00:01:44.790> just<00:01:44.820> fool<00:01:45.149> around<00:01:45.180> I<00:01:45.840> mean

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
so I guess I'll just fool around I mean

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.840 
so I guess I'll just fool around I mean
it<00:01:46.200> just<00:01:46.320> destroys<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:46.979> flow<00:01:47.220> of<00:01:47.250> it<00:01:47.520> all<00:01:47.670> and

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
it just destroys the flow of it all and

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.700 
it just destroys the flow of it all and
it<00:01:47.909> feels<00:01:48.119> kind<00:01:48.390> of<00:01:48.420> awkward<00:01:48.930> at<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.500> same

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
it feels kind of awkward at the same

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.499 
it feels kind of awkward at the same
time<00:01:49.770> when<00:01:50.310> you're<00:01:50.430> going<00:01:50.700> and<00:01:50.970> singing

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
time when you're going and singing

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.719 
time when you're going and singing
there's<00:01:52.020> no<00:01:52.200> pitch<00:01:52.530> meter<00:01:52.829> so<00:01:53.159> you're<00:01:53.460> kind<00:01:53.700> of

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
there's no pitch meter so you're kind of

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.100 
there's no pitch meter so you're kind of
just<00:01:53.790> saying<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.360> words<00:01:54.570> and<00:01:54.840> it's<00:01:54.960> either

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
just saying the words and it's either

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.100 
just saying the words and it's either
going<00:01:55.320> to<00:01:55.380> say<00:01:55.590> okay<00:01:56.430> or<00:01:56.460> bad<00:01:57.149> or<00:01:57.509> you<00:01:57.960> know

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
going to say okay or bad or you know

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.200 
going to say okay or bad or you know
perfect<00:01:58.680> and<00:01:59.009> I'm<00:01:59.399> not<00:01:59.579> really<00:01:59.759> one<00:01:59.939> hundred

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
perfect and I'm not really one hundred

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.690 
perfect and I'm not really one hundred
percent<00:02:00.240> sure<00:02:00.570> exactly<00:02:01.259> how<00:02:01.770> to<00:02:01.829> make<00:02:02.159> myself

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
percent sure exactly how to make myself

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.450 
percent sure exactly how to make myself
sound<00:02:03.450> better<00:02:03.750> with<00:02:04.290> in<00:02:04.469> this<00:02:04.649> game<00:02:04.890> I<00:02:04.920> mean<00:02:05.369> I

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
sound better with in this game I mean I

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.249 
sound better with in this game I mean I
guess<00:02:05.490> all<00:02:06.000> you<00:02:06.060> could<00:02:06.299> do<00:02:06.479> is<00:02:06.509> just<00:02:06.840> go<00:02:07.020> on

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
guess all you could do is just go on

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.320 
guess all you could do is just go on
tempo<00:02:07.710> with<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.399> bar<00:02:08.580> that's<00:02:08.819> going<00:02:09.090> across

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
tempo with the bar that's going across

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.089 
tempo with the bar that's going across
and<00:02:09.450> hopefully<00:02:09.989> you're<00:02:10.140> saying<00:02:10.500> the<00:02:10.619> words<00:02:10.800> in

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
and hopefully you're saying the words in

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.309 
and hopefully you're saying the words in
sync<00:02:11.400> with<00:02:11.550> that<00:02:11.730> bar<00:02:11.970> and<00:02:12.150> maybe<00:02:12.569> that's<00:02:12.840> how

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
sync with that bar and maybe that's how

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.770 
sync with that bar and maybe that's how
li<00:02:13.560> Hao<00:02:13.739> is<00:02:13.769> judging<00:02:14.459> you<00:02:14.730> but<00:02:15.299> there's<00:02:15.540> really

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
li Hao is judging you but there's really

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.349 
li Hao is judging you but there's really
again<00:02:16.200> like<00:02:16.739> a<00:02:16.920> lack<00:02:17.159> of<00:02:17.400> communication<00:02:18.329> to

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:18.359 
again like a lack of communication to

00:02:18.359 --> 00:02:20.089 
again like a lack of communication to
the<00:02:18.540> player<00:02:18.840> that<00:02:19.049> you're<00:02:19.230> really<00:02:19.650> doing<00:02:19.829> this

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.099 
the player that you're really doing this

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:22.879 
the player that you're really doing this
well<00:02:20.370> or<00:02:20.670> poorly<00:02:21.180> so<00:02:21.900> the<00:02:22.049> dancing<00:02:22.530> is<00:02:22.650> pretty

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:22.889 
well or poorly so the dancing is pretty

00:02:22.889 --> 00:02:25.220 
well or poorly so the dancing is pretty
cool<00:02:23.129> because<00:02:23.400> there<00:02:23.730> again<00:02:24.060> these<00:02:24.510> really

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
cool because there again these really

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.259 
cool because there again these really
complicated<00:02:25.980> moves<00:02:26.310> so<00:02:26.579> if<00:02:26.730> you<00:02:26.879> think<00:02:26.939> that

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
complicated moves so if you think that

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:29.300 
complicated moves so if you think that
damn<00:02:27.480> central<00:02:27.930> is<00:02:28.079> too<00:02:28.260> easy<00:02:28.290> for<00:02:28.620> you<00:02:28.889> because

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
damn central is too easy for you because

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.300 
damn central is too easy for you because
it<00:02:29.489> breaks<00:02:29.879> it<00:02:30.150> the<00:02:30.510> moves<00:02:30.780> down<00:02:30.989> into<00:02:31.739> life<00:02:31.980> by

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
it breaks it the moves down into life by

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.910 
it breaks it the moves down into life by
minut<00:02:32.790> sort<00:02:33.299> of<00:02:33.389> details<00:02:33.840> then<00:02:34.379> go<00:02:34.530> ahead<00:02:34.709> and

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
minut sort of details then go ahead and

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.920 
minut sort of details then go ahead and
try<00:02:35.370> this<00:02:35.400> game<00:02:35.849> michael<00:02:36.359> jackson<00:02:36.840> the

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
try this game michael jackson the

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.449 
try this game michael jackson the
experience<00:02:37.049> because<00:02:37.620> it's<00:02:37.859> going<00:02:38.069> to<00:02:38.219> beat

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
experience because it's going to beat

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:39.979 
experience because it's going to beat

you can dance like Michael Jackson I
don't<00:02:42.030> know<00:02:42.090> play<00:02:42.329> this<00:02:42.480> game<00:02:42.719> and<00:02:42.959> you<00:02:43.200> might

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:43.349 
don't know play this game and you might

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:45.409 
don't know play this game and you might
be<00:02:43.499> dancing<00:02:43.919> like<00:02:44.069> a<00:02:44.099> fool<00:02:44.189> all<00:02:44.700> right<00:02:44.969> because

be dancing like a fool all right because

00:02:45.419 --> 00:02:47.569 
be dancing like a fool all right because
this<00:02:45.629> is<00:02:45.810> really<00:02:46.200> difficult<00:02:46.530> unless<00:02:47.099> you

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:47.579 
this is really difficult unless you

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:50.629 
this is really difficult unless you
practice<00:02:47.849> and<00:02:48.359> practicing<00:02:49.349> allows<00:02:49.620> you<00:02:50.400> to

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:50.639 
practice and practicing allows you to

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:53.030 
practice and practicing allows you to
break<00:02:50.879> down<00:02:51.120> the<00:02:51.389> songs<00:02:51.659> and<00:02:51.930> moves<00:02:52.319> into<00:02:52.620> each

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
break down the songs and moves into each

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.159 
break down the songs and moves into each
particular<00:02:53.639> movement<00:02:54.090> but<00:02:54.629> if<00:02:54.719> you<00:02:54.810> just<00:02:55.019> go

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:55.169 
particular movement but if you just go

00:02:55.169 --> 00:02:57.080 
particular movement but if you just go
into<00:02:55.379> the<00:02:55.469> concert<00:02:55.859> moda<00:02:56.099> and<00:02:56.400> perform<00:02:56.849> for

people the audience there you're not
going<00:02:59.639> to<00:02:59.699> do<00:02:59.849> so<00:03:00.090> well<00:03:00.299> and<00:03:00.540> it's<00:03:00.750> really

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 
going to do so well and it's really

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:04.280 
going to do so well and it's really
crazy<00:03:01.980> because<00:03:02.459> I<00:03:02.909> mean<00:03:03.209> even<00:03:03.659> though<00:03:03.930> it<00:03:04.079> does

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
crazy because I mean even though it does

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.080 
crazy because I mean even though it does
have<00:03:04.500> those<00:03:04.650> sort<00:03:04.949> of<00:03:05.010> sections<00:03:05.549> of<00:03:05.699> like<00:03:05.879> this

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
have those sort of sections of like this

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:07.490 
have those sort of sections of like this
is<00:03:06.239> what<00:03:06.419> the<00:03:06.569> move<00:03:06.719> is<00:03:06.750> supposed<00:03:07.169> to<00:03:07.290> be<00:03:07.409> about

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
is what the move is supposed to be about

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:08.990 
is what the move is supposed to be about
these<00:03:07.829> little<00:03:07.980> squares<00:03:08.280> that<00:03:08.519> give<00:03:08.849> you<00:03:08.969> the

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
these little squares that give you the

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.149 
these little squares that give you the
gist<00:03:09.419> and<00:03:09.659> not<00:03:10.169> only<00:03:10.379> the<00:03:10.500> gist<00:03:10.709> of<00:03:10.829> what<00:03:11.010> the

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:11.159 
gist and not only the gist of what the

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:13.069 
gist and not only the gist of what the
current<00:03:11.400> move<00:03:11.669> is<00:03:11.849> but<00:03:12.150> the<00:03:12.329> previous<00:03:12.810> moves

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:13.079 
current move is but the previous moves

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:15.470 
current move is but the previous moves
as<00:03:13.349> well<00:03:13.530> as<00:03:13.620> the<00:03:13.739> future<00:03:14.129> moves<00:03:14.370> it<00:03:14.579> still<00:03:15.299> is

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
as well as the future moves it still is

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.509 
as well as the future moves it still is
way<00:03:15.719> too<00:03:15.780> difficult<00:03:16.139> and<00:03:16.680> the<00:03:16.980> moves<00:03:17.159> are<00:03:17.340> too

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
way too difficult and the moves are too

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:19.969 
way too difficult and the moves are too
complicated<00:03:18.060> and<00:03:18.629> they<00:03:19.079> don't<00:03:19.229> show<00:03:19.680> enough

00:03:19.969 --> 00:03:19.979 
complicated and they don't show enough

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:22.039 
complicated and they don't show enough
of<00:03:20.459> the<00:03:20.579> movement<00:03:21.030> within<00:03:21.389> those<00:03:21.659> little

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049 
of the movement within those little

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:23.780 
of the movement within those little
squares<00:03:22.259> you<00:03:22.560> do<00:03:22.709> sit<00:03:22.919> have<00:03:23.040> some<00:03:23.310> backup

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
squares you do sit have some backup

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.610 
squares you do sit have some backup
dancers<00:03:24.269> to<00:03:24.479> you<00:03:24.569> which<00:03:25.019> is<00:03:25.199> great<00:03:25.349> because

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
dancers to you which is great because

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.289 
dancers to you which is great because
you'll<00:03:25.919> tend<00:03:26.220> to<00:03:26.310> just<00:03:26.430> like<00:03:26.729> follow<00:03:27.030> whatever

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299 
you'll tend to just like follow whatever

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:29.179 
you'll tend to just like follow whatever
they're<00:03:27.750> doing<00:03:27.780> even<00:03:28.259> though<00:03:28.620> you<00:03:28.739> might<00:03:28.979> be<00:03:29.159> a

00:03:29.179 --> 00:03:29.189 
they're doing even though you might be a

00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:30.860 
they're doing even though you might be a
little<00:03:29.370> bit<00:03:29.549> behind<00:03:29.699> and<00:03:30.180> catching<00:03:30.569> up<00:03:30.659> to

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
little bit behind and catching up to

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.599 
little bit behind and catching up to
whatever<00:03:31.109> like<00:03:31.590> dance<00:03:31.949> move<00:03:32.189> they're<00:03:32.370> doing

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:32.609 
whatever like dance move they're doing

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:34.219 
whatever like dance move they're doing
you're<00:03:32.970> still<00:03:33.269> going<00:03:33.509> to<00:03:33.599> be<00:03:33.689> watching<00:03:33.840> them

00:03:34.219 --> 00:03:34.229 
you're still going to be watching them

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:36.110 
you're still going to be watching them
because<00:03:34.530> they<00:03:34.739> know<00:03:34.919> what<00:03:35.519> exactly<00:03:35.669> you're

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
because they know what exactly you're

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.759 
because they know what exactly you're
supposed<00:03:36.509> to<00:03:36.629> be<00:03:36.720> doing<00:03:36.959> but<00:03:37.079> every<00:03:37.319> now<00:03:37.530> and

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
supposed to be doing but every now and

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:39.830 
supposed to be doing but every now and
then<00:03:37.859> though<00:03:38.069> they<00:03:38.519> disappear<00:03:39.180> and<00:03:39.419> I'm<00:03:39.689> not

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
then though they disappear and I'm not

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.330 
then though they disappear and I'm not
laundry<00:03:40.169> percent<00:03:40.500> sure<00:03:40.620> one<00:03:40.859> thing<00:03:41.099> to<00:03:41.310> that

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
laundry percent sure one thing to that

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.399 
laundry percent sure one thing to that
but<00:03:41.939> it's<00:03:42.060> like<00:03:42.209> it's<00:03:42.389> part<00:03:42.659> of<00:03:42.720> the<00:03:42.840> act<00:03:43.049> and

00:03:43.399 --> 00:03:43.409 
but it's like it's part of the act and

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:45.800 
but it's like it's part of the act and
it's<00:03:43.590> again<00:03:44.250> kind<00:03:44.759> of<00:03:44.819> confusing<00:03:45.509> to<00:03:45.689> the

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
it's again kind of confusing to the

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.330 
it's again kind of confusing to the
player<00:03:46.019> at<00:03:46.229> least<00:03:46.439> because<00:03:46.769> it's<00:03:47.009> like<00:03:47.129> wait

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
player at least because it's like wait

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:50.050 
player at least because it's like wait
word<00:03:47.699> now<00:03:48.180> what<00:03:48.479> do<00:03:48.540> I<00:03:48.599> do<00:03:48.689> now<00:03:49.049> oh<00:03:49.349> great<00:03:49.709> oh

to me but uh yeah it was very much so

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.779 
to me but uh yeah it was very much so
weird<00:04:10.139> that<00:04:10.379> again<00:04:10.949> it<00:04:11.219> doesn't<00:04:11.459> seem<00:04:11.759> like

00:04:11.779 --> 00:04:11.789 
weird that again it doesn't seem like

00:04:11.789 --> 00:04:13.729 
weird that again it doesn't seem like
this<00:04:12.090> game<00:04:12.299> entirely<00:04:12.689> understands<00:04:13.530> what

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
this game entirely understands what

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:15.740 
this game entirely understands what
exactly<00:04:14.250> you're<00:04:14.699> supposed<00:04:15.090> to<00:04:15.209> be<00:04:15.299> doing<00:04:15.659> and

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
exactly you're supposed to be doing and

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.120 
exactly you're supposed to be doing and
it<00:04:15.900> doesn't<00:04:16.169> seem<00:04:16.259> like<00:04:16.320> it's<00:04:16.590> reading<00:04:17.009> you

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
it doesn't seem like it's reading you

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.249 
it doesn't seem like it's reading you
correctly<00:04:17.400> which<00:04:17.909> is<00:04:18.090> a<00:04:18.120> problem<00:04:18.719> if<00:04:18.900> you

00:04:19.249 --> 00:04:19.259 
correctly which is a problem if you

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:21.319 
correctly which is a problem if you
really<00:04:19.650> want<00:04:19.859> to<00:04:19.949> get<00:04:20.130> the<00:04:20.310> major<00:04:20.579> points<00:04:21.150> and

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:21.329 
really want to get the major points and

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:23.260 
really want to get the major points and
scores<00:04:21.659> like<00:04:21.900> that<00:04:22.079> but<00:04:22.409> if<00:04:22.500> you<00:04:22.560> just<00:04:22.770> want<00:04:22.830> to

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 
scores like that but if you just want to

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:25.119 
scores like that but if you just want to
actually<00:04:23.509> dance<00:04:23.750> the<00:04:24.050> songs<00:04:24.379> then<00:04:24.830> you<00:04:25.009> know

00:04:25.119 --> 00:04:25.129 
actually dance the songs then you know

00:04:25.129 --> 00:04:27.309 
actually dance the songs then you know
that's<00:04:25.430> perfectly<00:04:26.060> fine<00:04:26.150> in<00:04:26.690> addition<00:04:26.960> to<00:04:27.199> the

00:04:27.309 --> 00:04:27.319 
that's perfectly fine in addition to the

00:04:27.319 --> 00:04:29.230 
that's perfectly fine in addition to the
single<00:04:27.650> player<00:04:27.770> there<00:04:28.099> is<00:04:28.190> multi<00:04:28.669> player<00:04:28.910> and

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240 
single player there is multi player and

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:30.969 
single player there is multi player and
this<00:04:29.509> is<00:04:29.660> where<00:04:29.900> I<00:04:29.930> question<00:04:30.500> whether<00:04:30.680> or<00:04:30.889> not

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:30.979 
this is where I question whether or not

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:32.740 
this is where I question whether or not
this<00:04:31.160> game<00:04:31.400> is<00:04:31.550> going<00:04:31.699> to<00:04:31.849> really<00:04:32.090> be<00:04:32.210> like

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:32.750 
this game is going to really be like

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:35.439 
this game is going to really be like
that<00:04:33.289> well<00:04:33.650> accepted<00:04:34.460> within<00:04:34.669> the<00:04:35.060> party

00:04:35.439 --> 00:04:35.449 
that well accepted within the party

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:36.790 
that well accepted within the party
unless<00:04:35.870> you're<00:04:35.930> having<00:04:36.289> like<00:04:36.440> a<00:04:36.470> Michael

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:36.800 
unless you're having like a Michael

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.040 
unless you're having like a Michael
Jackson<00:04:37.129> party<00:04:37.550> I'm<00:04:37.639> not<00:04:37.729> 100%<00:04:38.389> sure<00:04:38.449> that<00:04:38.569> the

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.050 
Jackson party I'm not 100% sure that the

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:40.570 
Jackson party I'm not 100% sure that the
partygoers<00:04:39.440> are<00:04:39.860> really<00:04:40.190> going<00:04:40.340> to<00:04:40.490> enjoy

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:40.580

video<00:05:26.750> at<00:05:27.110> the<00:05:27.530> same<00:05:27.560> time<00:05:27.979> it's<00:05:28.430> not

00:05:29.129 --> 00:05:29.139 
video at the same time it's not

interactive like video games tend to be

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:33.520 
interactive like video games tend to be
so<00:05:31.969> I<00:05:32.000> guess<00:05:32.330> we<00:05:32.539> have<00:05:32.750> to<00:05:32.780> do<00:05:33.020> is<00:05:33.050> take<00:05:33.319> that

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:33.530 
so I guess we have to do is take that

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:35.110 
so I guess we have to do is take that
knowledge<00:05:33.710> that<00:05:34.099> you<00:05:34.190> gain<00:05:34.400> from<00:05:34.639> this<00:05:34.789> video

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:35.120

and apply to practice mode and apply

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:38.920 
and apply to practice mode and apply
that<00:05:37.460> practice<00:05:37.969> mode<00:05:38.120> over<00:05:38.300> to<00:05:38.509> concert

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:38.930 
that practice mode over to concert

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:40.390 
that practice mode over to concert
moment<00:05:39.169> there's<00:05:39.440> one<00:05:39.650> thing<00:05:39.830> that<00:05:39.889> this<00:05:40.130> game
