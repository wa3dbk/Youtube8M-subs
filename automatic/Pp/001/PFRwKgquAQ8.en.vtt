00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:04.710
 to avoid complications 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.149
 cardiovascular diseases 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.069
 the patient must do a series of 

00:00:06.149 --> 00:00:10.080
 restrictions in your diet that can 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.139
 make him think that his diet is going to 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.459
 become monotonous and boring but 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.350
 things do not have to be this way 

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:18.480
 because in reality a renal patient 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.460
 can do a varied diet and 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.820
 rich in all phases of the disease 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.650
 kidney is recommended to avoid fat 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.130
 animal especially sausages 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:31.259
 including ham cheese and milk 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.290
 whole skim is allowed and 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:36.510
 semi-skimmed reduce salt consumption 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.430
 not only the use of a salt shaker but 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.290
 products with high salt content as 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.080
 cheese broth tablets 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.120
 concentrated the canned products or 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:47.810
 those who come in envelopes those who 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.950
 they sell frozen and precooked 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:52.230
 reduce the amount of proteins in the 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.840
 diet so it is recommended to take a 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.270
 single serving of meat or fish per day 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.640
 reduce the intake of dairy products to a ration 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.220
 of dairy a day a small cup of 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.630
 milk a yogurt or custard and take a 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:04.530
 average of no more than three eggs to the 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:06.750
 week 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.670
 to achieve this goal it is important 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.950
 get used to dinner not a second 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.090
 meat or fish dish but something 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.880
 belonging to what we usually call 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:18.150
 first courses be vegetable vegetables 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.560
 pasta or rice in general will be much more 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.350
 easy to meet these goals if we 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.000
 we usually use exclusively 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:26.940
 fresh products avoiding food 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.890
 packaged or precooked to improve the 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.780
 flavor of the food when it comes to seasoning 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.820
 instead of salt it is recommended 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.860
 use additives such as chopped garlic 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.289
 pepper the parsley or any herb 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.450
 aromatic is important to make a 

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:40.830
 varied food taking all kinds 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.050
 of food allowed in a way 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:45.720
 balanced and thus avoiding excess 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.190
 one type of food and the lack of another 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.690
 when the disease is in 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.240
 advanced phase there are two other substances 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.040
 whose excess we should avoid because they can 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.630
 pose a serious risk to the function 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.660
 of the heart and for circulation 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.610
 blood phosphorus and potassium for 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:01.380
 control phosphorus you have to insist on 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.410
 the taking of small amounts of milk 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:07.110
 or yogurt custard derivatives and so on 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:09.450
 blue fish avoiding its skin 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.940
 cocacola and beer and it is also 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.910
 It is fundamental to avoid as much as possible 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.620
 cocoa chocolate and nuts 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.360
 to reduce potassium we must 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.270
 get used to leaving a few hours to soak 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.200
 potatoes vegetables and legumes 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.450
 removing the water before starting the 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.850
 preparation and changing the water in half 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.190
 cooking you must reduce the pieces of 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:31.110
 tomato or fruit to one a day avoiding 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.270
 the banana also in this case is 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.770
 essential to avoid chocolate cocoa and 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.660
 the nuts 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:39.120
 instead they can eat freely 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.710
 apples and pears and to prepare a 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.840
 salad there is a series of foods that 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:45.510
 they contain little potassium like lettuce 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:48.420
 onions or scallions pepper the 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.860
 asparagus or cucumber although it seems that 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.050
 the restrictions advised to the 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.120
 kidney patients affect much of 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.320
 our food is much higher 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.450
 food ratio that we can 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.640
 consume freely provided that as 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:02.700
 has said the food is varied and it 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.200
 follow the recommendations given thus a 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.080
 kidney patient can enjoy as 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.600
 first course of both rice pasta or 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.850
 potatoes prepared in multiple ways or 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.710
 rich vegetables and legumes of second 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:15.630
 dish can include almost all 

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:19.020
 ways of preparing meat 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:21.150
 fish or egg so it's clear 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:23.660
 that the renal patient should not give up 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.660
 to good food 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.830
 Y 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.390
 Y 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.470
