00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 
now watch Reddick as he goes up and the

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.760 
now watch Reddick as he goes up and the
fan<00:01:45.640> is<00:01:45.940> over<00:01:46.600> the<00:01:46.750> wall<00:01:46.960> redick's<00:01:47.440> got<00:01:47.619> it

played<00:01:48.039> perfectly<00:01:48.429> and<00:01:49.090> then<00:01:50.080> the<00:01:50.229> question

00:01:50.669 --> 00:01:50.679 
played perfectly and then the question

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:52.620 
played perfectly and then the question
is<00:01:50.800> whether<00:01:51.069> or<00:01:51.280> not<00:01:51.429> the<00:01:51.729> trajectory<00:01:52.420> of<00:01:52.450> that

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
is whether or not the trajectory of that

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:55.020 
is whether or not the trajectory of that
ball<00:01:52.869> would<00:01:53.050> have<00:01:53.140> taken<00:01:53.410> it<00:01:53.679> beyond<00:01:54.670> his

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
ball would have taken it beyond his

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:56.790 
ball would have taken it beyond his
glove<00:01:55.450> that's<00:01:55.720> gonna<00:01:55.869> be<00:01:56.050> a<00:01:56.080> tough<00:01:56.380> that's<00:01:56.410> a

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:56.800 
glove that's gonna be a tough that's a

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.840 
glove that's gonna be a tough that's a
tough<00:01:57.100> that's<00:01:57.130> as<00:01:57.700> tough<00:01:58.000> as<00:01:58.179> it<00:01:58.360> gets<00:01:59.850> this

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
tough that's as tough as it gets this

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:02.999 
tough that's as tough as it gets this
would<00:02:01.090> have<00:02:01.209> been<00:02:01.330> a<00:02:01.390> spectacular<00:02:01.780> catch<00:02:02.740> I

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:03.009 
would have been a spectacular catch I

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:05.340 
would have been a spectacular catch I
don't<00:02:03.190> know<00:02:03.369> if<00:02:03.580> the<00:02:03.729> fan<00:02:03.970> really<00:02:04.600> I<00:02:04.630> mean<00:02:05.050> he
