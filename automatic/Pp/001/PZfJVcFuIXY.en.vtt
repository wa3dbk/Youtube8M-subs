00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
think for the 52 partners film we did a

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.109 
think for the 52 partners film we did a
favor<00:01:53.680> for<00:01:53.800> objects<00:01:54.369> from<00:01:54.460> the<00:01:54.550> same<00:01:54.820> books

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:55.119 
favor for objects from the same books

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:58.050 
favor for objects from the same books
abroad<00:01:55.659> it's<00:01:56.470> kind<00:01:56.619> of<00:01:56.740> one<00:01:57.130> story<00:01:57.520> I<00:01:57.820> think

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
abroad it's kind of one story I think

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.760 
abroad it's kind of one story I think
it's<00:01:58.360> very<00:01:58.390> interesting<00:01:58.960> display<00:01:59.380> I<00:01:59.560> think

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
it's very interesting display I think

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:06.660 
it's very interesting display I think
and<00:02:00.430> also<00:02:00.460> well<00:02:00.850> they<00:02:00.940> actually<00:02:05.130> it's<00:02:06.130> perfect

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 
and also well they actually it's perfect

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.020 
and also well they actually it's perfect
and<00:02:06.850> I<00:02:07.660> think<00:02:08.590> they<00:02:08.860> are<00:02:08.979> see<00:02:09.160> various<00:02:09.459> films

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
and I think they are see various films

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.210 
and I think they are see various films
and<00:02:10.179> it<00:02:10.269> was<00:02:10.390> very<00:02:10.570> mindful<00:02:10.959> to<00:02:11.350> to<00:02:11.769> have<00:02:12.010> two

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
and it was very mindful to to have two

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.479 
and it was very mindful to to have two
movies<00:02:12.610> and<00:02:13.269> I<00:02:13.390> think<00:02:13.630> for<00:02:13.780> me<00:02:13.810> in<00:02:14.230> the<00:02:14.440> most<00:02:15.370> of

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.489 
movies and I think for me in the most of

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:17.370 
movies and I think for me in the most of
the<00:02:15.550> last<00:02:15.760> week<00:02:16.000> for<00:02:16.209> filming<00:02:16.600> what<00:02:16.780> to<00:02:16.959> do

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
the last week for filming what to do

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.500 
the last week for filming what to do
with<00:02:17.470> the<00:02:17.560> last<00:02:17.769> one<00:02:18.040> which<00:02:18.220> is<00:02:18.250> kind<00:02:19.150> of<00:02:19.180> quite

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
with the last one which is kind of quite

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.680 
with the last one which is kind of quite
crazy<00:02:19.840> some<00:02:20.769> intense<00:02:21.250> battle<00:02:21.880> sequences<00:02:22.390> I

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
crazy some intense battle sequences I

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.830 
crazy some intense battle sequences I
think<00:02:23.320> that<00:02:23.440> really<00:02:23.620> gave<00:02:23.830> me<00:02:24.300> another<00:02:25.300> energy

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
think that really gave me another energy

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.949 
think that really gave me another energy
that<00:02:26.230> was<00:02:26.350> really<00:02:26.590> exciting<00:02:27.390> it's<00:02:28.390> in<00:02:28.540> writing

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
that was really exciting it's in writing

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:29.940 
that was really exciting it's in writing
I<00:02:29.080> think<00:02:29.260> that's<00:02:29.380> what<00:02:29.500> you<00:02:29.590> get<00:02:29.709> from

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
I think that's what you get from

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.470 
I think that's what you get from
formatting<00:02:30.850> that<00:02:32.790> very<00:02:33.790> hard<00:02:34.060> too<00:02:34.450> fast

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
formatting that very hard too fast

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.020 
formatting that very hard too fast
heartbeat<00:02:35.260> and<00:02:35.650> active<00:02:36.010> excited<00:02:36.610> when<00:02:36.790> to

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
heartbeat and active excited when to

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.550 
heartbeat and active excited when to
when<00:02:37.150> the<00:02:37.239> tapes<00:02:37.480> finished<00:02:37.959> and<00:02:38.230> that<00:02:38.320> sense

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
when the tapes finished and that sense

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.740 
when the tapes finished and that sense
of<00:02:38.739> I<00:02:38.980> think<00:02:39.610> the<00:02:39.820> collective<00:02:40.360> sense<00:02:40.600> of

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
of I think the collective sense of

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.870 
of I think the collective sense of
achievement<00:02:40.810> when<00:02:41.320> something<00:02:41.709> is<00:02:42.180> completed

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
achievement when something is completed

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.400 
achievement when something is completed
and<00:02:44.880> I<00:02:44.940> think<00:02:45.000> I<00:02:45.420> think<00:02:45.960> also<00:02:46.080> the<00:02:46.290> whole

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
and I think I think also the whole

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.410 
and I think I think also the whole
experience<00:02:46.560> is<00:02:47.070> a<00:02:47.280> proud<00:02:47.580> of<00:02:47.880> the<00:02:48.000> frizzle

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
experience is a proud of the frizzle

00:02:48.420 --> 00:03:59.270 
experience is a proud of the frizzle
matter<00:02:48.630> to<00:02:49.320> complete<00:02:51.380> always

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:19.970 

I<00:04:16.850> really<00:04:17.850> this<00:04:18.329> something<00:04:18.989> already<00:04:19.380> quite<00:04:19.919> a

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:19.980
