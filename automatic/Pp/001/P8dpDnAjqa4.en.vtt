00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 hey people today there is one again 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.779
 Review of me and that is about today 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.429
 the movement of gosch and equal to 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.349
 It's my favorite, right from the start 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:13.019
 baby cream from the lottery area why 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.320
 I'll just tell you from scratch 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.410
 path 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.880
 what is a comfortable most people 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.900
 from rich most people of you 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.460
 most of you know 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.170
 Probably something green is just 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.850
 for those who do not know it yet 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.810
 away so if the baby can come 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:30.769
 originally from asia and it more or 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.610
 less foundation primer and 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:36.149
 moisturizing day care in 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:38.190
 One of them was the gymnasium 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.989
 very popular seems to know so well 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.059
 Lightly skin lighten the particles in it 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.280
 Does that have so much healthier 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.200
 aspirationally no matter is put there 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.940
 I wanted to say that out of this 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.920
 direction only this corner of the world of 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.180
 trend has come to ours and me 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.829
 I have to say that I am actually from the 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.800
 BBQ excited because they are during the day 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.180
 really a nice care are okay 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.649
 I just want to be honest now 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.180
 just explain why this how much 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.550
 can my favorite is motives 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.129
 We drive from the drugstore area 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.799
 at the price have the movement of 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.600
 Gosch costs 13 Euro 99 at the beaver in 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.340
 Austria how much they are in now 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.770
 unfortunately I do not know Germany 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.700
 because I am in Germany and 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.320
 I do not have it on the internet either 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.610
 that means who can find out 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.830
 No one of you knows how much you know 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.030
 costs or where you keep them until Switzerland 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.890
 and in the comments 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.780
 many people who do not know it and 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.119
 Of course, I'm interested too 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.030
 who is super nice if someone from 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.770
 you could do that knows exactly so 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.659
 generally the magic brand I think 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.329
 very cool if you generally have a review 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.740
 or we are what an idea of 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.820
 I want to have this brand 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.540
 Write that down in the 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.280
 Comments 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.659
 because i would definitely do it 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.979
 because this brand is actually pretty 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:48.689
 cool so price 13 eur 99 is natural 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.810
 now not exactly cheap is from the 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:53.520
 drug area one of the most expensive okay 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.229
 I just said I think so 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.840
 actually very justified because this bw 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.560
 Can really keep what they do 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.770
 promises 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.119
 she promises a great together so the 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.600
 Chamber really advancing foundation very much 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.460
 nice spoiled 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.890
 She promises to donate moisture 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.440
 that is what she is and she promises 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.000
 of course to be a foundation and 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.550
 I'll come to that later why 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.260
 I think that's good now well a 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.580
 It is so color palette there are four 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.080
 colors to choose from 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.970
 okay I do not think so now 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.450
 absolutely the madness 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:26.880
 Compared to late for baby baby baby 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.730
 film is only one color allegedly 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.319
 should suit all skin tones 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.819
 it suits me yes i'm sure it will 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:35.160
 in people who are very very bright 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:36.780
 looked weird because they were a bit reddish 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.510
 is that and then in bright people like that 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.250
 it could be dangerous there are many 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.530
 tones as I said there are very bright 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.150
 to medium dark that is the problem 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.620
 It will be dark-skinned women I believe 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.110
 is not really the darkest either 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.610
 what for you the about the same printer 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.989
 are driving from home like me until now 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.920
 there is a little bit darker on everyone 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:57.090
 still remember the colors of the symphony 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.410
 as well as wrap the fit 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.239
 I do not agree with that 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:02.819
 There are only four colors to choose from 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:04.799
 because it is beaver so that the 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:08.190
 own car more or less adapts 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:10.410
 that is, if you are doing easier 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:13.320
 So take the right color 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:17.100
 then it corrects more or less 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:18.900
 on your skin this mistake and exactly 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:22.500
 when the consistency he is very very 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:24.060
 creamy means that she is so creamy 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.459
 It is very good for very dry skin 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.720
 suitable because she is really beautiful 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:29.040
 puts on the skin and somehow 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:29.820
 So somehow and also good 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.920
 moves in 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:33.720
 by being creamy it is her too 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.420
 I'll show it all now 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.730
 short on the back of your hand so you see 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:40.410
 here it really looks like that 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.690
 foundation instead i'm scared some 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:44.250
 others like creams and if you like that 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:46.769
 on the dog on the back of the hand 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:49.290
 to keep a massaged work so ok it is 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:50.940
 not quite my color and with time 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.739
 but if you are really good at it 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.590
 it starts to work so well 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:58.980
 merge with that of your own 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:59.880
 skin with the skin tone of your own and 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.030
 Welcome to the next one 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:04.739
 point to the opacity and the 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.540
 tbb determined cream from the drugstore 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:09.180
 area the most cover 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:11.159
 It is very strong because of that 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.260
 pigmented it resembles it very much 

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:14.700
 strong a foundation so she's more 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.609
 foundation I think as the others 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:19.079
 favors have tested what, of course 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:21.930
 really good for people who say 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:23.280
 okay i just want to go with it during the day 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:25.289
 a little more opacity with one 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.380
 normal toned day creams but the 

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:29.759
 foundation anyway somehow too violent 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:30.990
 then this baby is sure to come 

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:33.419
 for you because it really is such a nice one 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:35.280
 Mittelding is for people who say okay 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:37.380
 I really really want to 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:39.630
 actually only have care and me 

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:42.750
 Do not want too much opacity now 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:44.099
 I do not want me 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:45.810
 just wants easy carers more 

00:04:44.099 --> 00:04:47.669
 or less, this movement is more likely 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:49.740
 nothing for you which locations of 

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:51.539
 maybelline recommend the latte like 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.949
 said unfortunately has a slight red sting in it 

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:57.330
 despite everything, not too heavily pigmented 

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:58.889
 that like it here so I have to say 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:01.949
 That's why I thought she was so cool 

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:03.930
 because you just because you are his 

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:05.759
 foundations just give me too much 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:07.440
 The day I just want to be nice and fresh 

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:09.389
 look like and not like I have 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:11.460
 Now tons of foundation face 

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:12.840
 then just take the kripo please 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:14.849
 Wait until you have one to us 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:17.039
 moved in and it was just that 

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:19.590
 It's really great for people too 

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:21.389
 let's say stronger skin blemishes 

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:23.729
 or redness has as much as I have 

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:25.440
 very very strong redness due to war 

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:27.599
 They almost go away with the pattern in the 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:29.130
 Soil pools have not been that culture 

00:05:27.599 --> 00:05:30.750
 completely gets away but I go with it 

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:34.710
 a concealer with a slightly darker one 

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:37.139
 even more about the durability I have 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:38.820
 this movement under extreme conditions 

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:41.340
 tested and rich in the middle 

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:44.280
 I would not do it though 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:46.440
 especially for makeup but I know 

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:48.090
 at least some people do that 

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:49.560
 really very impertinent 

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:50.789
 first I do not want to go now 

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:53.099
 build up and I just have it now 

00:05:50.789 --> 00:05:54.449
 this movement do in the face and times 

00:05:53.099 --> 00:05:56.520
 two hours of sports that you for one 

00:05:54.449 --> 00:06:00.930
 hour I was at the zumba and one 

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:03.300
 hour I was cycling and this 

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:04.830
 Vehicle still holds and not easy 

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:07.979
 the whole thing just wrong there I am 

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:09.990
 really excited that was so on the 

00:06:07.979 --> 00:06:11.460
 finish okay at the places where I extreme 

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:13.470
 have rubbed 

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:15.780
 Due to the salary here exactly the edges 

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:17.220
 Of course, the movement away, though 

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:18.660
 in that he is so beautiful and skin 

00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:19.650
 adapts and that was the imagine where 

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:22.860
 I do not really really 

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:24.990
 cover deck cover strong hiding power 

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:26.550
 but only here and I need stop there 

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:28.500
 just did not push that way again 

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:30.090
 she has really stayed upstairs me 

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:31.440
 my that's so amazing now 

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:33.780
 and the main route can breathe 

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:37.530
 but no, but she keeps everyone 

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:39.150
 case for a very long time exactly 

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:42.330
 it was actually all points 

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:44.520
 I am very positive and very positive 

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:45.930
 excited because of this course 

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:46.560
 deliver quickly excited about this 

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:48.180
 Movie 

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:49.680
 there is only one small thing left 

00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:51.570
 I want to say and that's very important 

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:54.090
 interesting for all vegans and by 

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:55.500
 and this baby creamy put on now 

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:57.810
 not my hand is because i have myself 

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:58.710
 I googled on the internet and me 

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:00.660
 Got me at a beaver 

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:02.580
 saleswoman inquires if that 

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:04.500
 really true and she meant yes 

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:07.740
 so i do not know i lay my hand 

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:09.930
 two but apparently this way is free 

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:12.180
 from animal experiments and in a legal way 

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:14.580
 This speaks for everyone 

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:16.650
 vegetarian and vegan and extreme heat 

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:18.270
 nobody wants you to do that 

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:20.130
 cosmetics are tested on animals 

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:21.780
 but of course, it's all the more fun 

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:22.979
 always really knows that was okay 

00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:25.940
 apparently do not really like animals 

00:07:22.979 --> 00:07:29.909
 tested and so I think that he completely 

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:31.469
 interesting side aspect and yes that was 

00:07:29.909 --> 00:07:33.300
 it actually already from me I hope 

00:07:31.469 --> 00:07:34.560
 should i like i got one 

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:35.009
 bring the product closer 

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:36.810
 can 

00:07:35.009 --> 00:07:38.759
 and as always if any questions 

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:40.979

00:07:38.759 --> 00:07:42.389
