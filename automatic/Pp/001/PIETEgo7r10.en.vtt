00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:35.410 
different skin types just because it is

00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:37.439 
different skin types just because it is
more<00:07:35.710> of<00:07:35.740> like<00:07:35.800> an<00:07:36.010> iridescent<00:07:36.580> kind<00:07:37.180> of<00:07:37.270> glow

00:07:37.439 --> 00:07:37.449 
more of like an iridescent kind of glow

00:07:37.449 --> 00:07:39.990 
more of like an iridescent kind of glow
eNOS<00:07:37.780> versus<00:07:38.740> like<00:07:38.889> a<00:07:38.919> gold<00:07:39.340> glitter<00:07:39.760> or<00:07:39.970> a

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:40.000 
eNOS versus like a gold glitter or a

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.850 
eNOS versus like a gold glitter or a
silver<00:07:40.419> glitter<00:07:40.660> so<00:07:41.290> yeah<00:07:41.410> I<00:07:41.440> think<00:07:41.530> a<00:07:41.710> lot<00:07:41.740> of

silver glitter so yeah I think a lot of
different<00:07:41.949> skin<00:07:42.280> tones<00:07:42.400> would<00:07:42.639> actually

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:43.000 
different skin tones would actually

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.030 
different skin tones would actually
would<00:07:43.570> really<00:07:43.810> suit<00:07:43.930> this<00:07:44.080> color<00:07:44.290> while<00:07:44.500> so

00:07:45.030 --> 00:07:45.040
