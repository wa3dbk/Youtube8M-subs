to the Past was released and before we

they didn't it they didn't make it so
that<00:02:57.040> it<00:02:57.160> was<00:02:57.310> super<00:02:57.790> tricky<00:02:58.090> like<00:02:58.420> you<00:02:58.569> had

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.010 
feel more like a platformer it was just

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.390 
feel more like a platformer it was just
sort<00:03:03.130> of<00:03:03.250> like<00:03:03.400> oh<00:03:03.610> there's<00:03:03.940> a<00:03:04.000> gap<00:03:04.330> in<00:03:04.830> the<00:03:05.830> on

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
sort of like oh there's a gap in the on

sort of like oh there's a gap in the on
the<00:03:06.519> floor<00:03:06.819> you've<00:03:07.239> gotta<00:03:07.450> just<00:03:07.720> jump<00:03:08.049> over<00:03:08.170> it

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
the floor you've gotta just jump over it

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:09.870 
the floor you've gotta just jump over it
it<00:03:08.530> was<00:03:08.650> pretty<00:03:08.829> straightforward<00:03:09.519> and<00:03:09.640> simple

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:09.880 
it was pretty straightforward and simple

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.560 
it was pretty straightforward and simple
and<00:03:10.239> nothing<00:03:10.750> super<00:03:11.170> tricky<00:03:11.470> so<00:03:11.920> I<00:03:12.130> mean<00:03:12.880> I<00:03:13.090> I

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:13.570 
and nothing super tricky so I mean I I

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:15.780 
and nothing super tricky so I mean I I
feel<00:03:13.989> like<00:03:14.110> that's<00:03:14.350> a<00:03:14.680> good<00:03:14.950> argument<00:03:15.160> for<00:03:15.579> why

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
feel like that's a good argument for why

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.300 
feel like that's a good argument for why
they<00:03:16.750> could<00:03:17.019> go<00:03:17.290> ahead<00:03:17.440> and<00:03:17.590> add<00:03:17.829> a<00:03:17.860> jump

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310

that hard anybody can do what's a little
bit<00:03:39.040> different<00:03:39.519> from<00:03:39.670> Zelda<00:03:40.150> is<00:03:40.329> that<00:03:40.840> it's

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
bit different from Zelda is that it's

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.770 
bit different from Zelda is that it's
kind<00:03:41.560> of<00:03:41.680> more<00:03:41.890> rpg-like<00:03:42.640> in<00:03:43.030> the<00:03:43.150> way<00:03:43.359> that<00:03:43.600> it

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
kind of more rpg-like in the way that it

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.910 
kind of more rpg-like in the way that it
has<00:03:44.049> spells<00:03:44.620> that<00:03:45.130> you<00:03:45.280> can<00:03:45.519> cast<00:03:45.760> up<00:03:46.209> to<00:03:46.920> four

different<00:03:48.280> staff<00:03:49.180> things<00:03:49.810> and<00:03:50.230> then<00:03:50.890> four

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
different staff things and then four

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.150 
different staff things and then four
different<00:03:51.790> crystal<00:03:52.390> or<00:03:52.720> things<00:03:53.410> that<00:03:53.620> you<00:03:53.859> mix

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.160 
different crystal or things that you mix

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.819 
different crystal or things that you mix
and<00:03:54.430> match<00:03:54.609> and<00:03:54.970> that<00:03:55.030> creates<00:03:55.530> 16<00:03:56.530> different

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:56.829 
and match and that creates 16 different

00:03:59.789 --> 00:03:59.799 
spells that you can cast so some enemies

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:02.009

for<00:04:00.130> instance<00:04:00.579> you're<00:04:01.299> not<00:04:01.510> really<00:04:01.660> going<00:04:01.930> to

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:02.019 
for instance you're not really going to

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:03.900 
for instance you're not really going to
do<00:04:02.230> much<00:04:02.380> damage<00:04:02.650> to<00:04:03.040> them<00:04:03.220> with<00:04:03.459> just<00:04:03.700> your

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:06.539 
do much damage to them with just your
sword<00:04:04.329> so<00:04:05.019> they<00:04:05.140> might<00:04:05.170> be<00:04:05.530> weak<00:04:05.799> against<00:04:06.310> fire

00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:06.549 
sword so they might be weak against fire

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:10.500 
sword so they might be weak against fire
or<00:04:06.940> a<00:04:07.390> tornado<00:04:07.450> it<00:04:08.350> is<00:04:08.680> more<00:04:08.980> rpg-like<00:04:09.790> in<00:04:10.299> that

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 
or a tornado it is more rpg-like in that

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:12.990 
or a tornado it is more rpg-like in that
respect<00:04:10.989> and<00:04:11.350> also<00:04:11.859> in<00:04:12.040> the<00:04:12.160> fact<00:04:12.400> that<00:04:12.549> you<00:04:12.790> do

from defeating enemies just like my an
RPG<00:04:19.660> and<00:04:19.840> then<00:04:19.930> you<00:04:20.050> level<00:04:20.380> up<00:04:20.500> and<00:04:20.770> that<00:04:20.890> lets

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.130 
RPG and then you level up and that lets

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:24.690 
RPG and then you level up and that lets
you<00:04:21.400> attack<00:04:22.210> stronger<00:04:23.140> have<00:04:23.980> better<00:04:24.220> defense

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:24.700 
you attack stronger have better defense

you attack stronger have better defense
and<00:04:25.060> so<00:04:25.330> on<00:04:25.980> also<00:04:26.980> it's<00:04:27.190> kind<00:04:27.490> of<00:04:27.550> a<00:04:27.760> little<00:04:27.970> I

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
and so on also it's kind of a little I

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:29.940 
and so on also it's kind of a little I
guess<00:04:28.420> the<00:04:28.810> fact<00:04:29.080> that<00:04:29.200> there<00:04:29.530> are<00:04:29.560> a<00:04:29.710> lot<00:04:29.920> of

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:29.950 
guess the fact that there are a lot of

guess the fact that there are a lot of
towns<00:04:30.430> is<00:04:31.330> kind<00:04:31.720> of<00:04:31.810> more<00:04:31.990> rpg-like<00:04:32.710> because<00:04:33.460> I

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:33.490 
towns is kind of more rpg-like because I

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:35.520 
towns is kind of more rpg-like because I
