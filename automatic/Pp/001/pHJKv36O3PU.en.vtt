on<00:00:09.030> neocortex<00:00:09.690> again<00:00:09.929> no<00:00:10.139> let<00:00:10.769> I<00:00:10.920> just<00:00:11.070> want<00:00:11.219> to

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
on neocortex again no let I just want to

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:12.950 
on neocortex again no let I just want to
point<00:00:11.639> out<00:00:11.820> I've<00:00:12.059> got<00:00:12.210> a<00:00:12.240> hundred<00:00:12.389> percent<00:00:12.540> you

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
point out I've got a hundred percent you

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.470 
point out I've got a hundred percent you
know<00:00:13.380> and<00:00:13.790> however<00:00:14.790> there<00:00:14.910> is<00:00:15.000> an<00:00:15.120> extra

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
know and however there is an extra

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.330 
know and however there is an extra
percentage<00:00:15.809> left<00:00:16.379> and<00:00:16.890> that's<00:00:17.039> what<00:00:17.190> this<00:00:17.279> is

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
percentage left and that's what this is

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:17.840 
percentage left and that's what this is
for

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
for

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.519 
for
so<00:00:18.119> there's<00:00:18.480> actual<00:00:18.810> final<00:00:19.140> percentage<00:00:19.439> you

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
so there's actual final percentage you

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:20.420 
so there's actual final percentage you
can<00:00:19.560> get<00:00:19.800> is<00:00:19.890> off<00:00:19.980> and<00:00:20.100> you're<00:00:20.189> done<00:00:20.220> one

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
can get is off and you're done one

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:31.690 
can get is off and you're done one

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:31.700 
percent this boss again so slow come on

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.340 
percent this boss again so slow come on
I<00:00:32.700> think<00:00:33.300> I<00:00:33.390> use<00:00:33.570> this<00:00:33.690> as<00:00:33.809> an<00:00:33.870> opportunity<00:00:34.020> to

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
I think I use this as an opportunity to

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.440 
I think I use this as an opportunity to
point<00:00:34.500> out<00:00:34.739> that<00:00:34.829> I<00:00:34.920> was<00:00:35.070> wrong<00:00:35.280> before<00:00:35.489> about

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
point out that I was wrong before about

point out that I was wrong before about
the<00:00:36.600> fact<00:00:36.630> that<00:00:36.899> you<00:00:37.590> know<00:00:38.690> that<00:00:39.690> one<00:00:39.930> scream

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
the fact that you know that one scream

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.350 
the fact that you know that one scream
was<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:40.739> only<00:00:40.920> thing<00:00:41.370> in<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.790> original

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
was the only thing in the original

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.490 
was the only thing in the original
ending<00:00:42.510> there's<00:00:42.840> actually<00:00:43.079> couple<00:00:43.320> more

you<00:00:51.809> know<00:00:51.840> cortex<00:00:52.410> can<00:00:52.559> still<00:00:52.739> powers

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
you know cortex can still powers

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.410 
you know cortex can still powers
planetary<00:00:54.059> minimize<00:00:54.390> and<00:00:54.570> roll<00:00:54.660> on<00:00:54.809> crap<00:00:56.420> so

on yes there we go done yes
stabilizer<00:01:17.960> crystals<00:01:18.410> so<00:01:18.860> you<00:01:18.950> get<00:01:21.400> highly

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:22.400 
stabilizer crystals so you get highly

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.980 
stabilizer crystals so you get highly

well now but I don't know I find I'm

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.630 
well now but I don't know I find I'm
using<00:01:35.990> something<00:01:36.259> anyway<00:01:36.860> now<00:01:37.310> now<00:01:37.460> let's

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
using something anyway now now let's

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.580 
using something anyway now now let's
each<00:01:37.729> a<00:01:37.880> scene<00:01:38.210> just<00:01:38.899> go<00:01:39.050> for<00:01:39.200> it<00:01:39.229> fast<00:01:39.500> as

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
each a scene just go for it fast as

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:40.540 
each a scene just go for it fast as
possible<00:01:39.860> don't<00:01:40.009> worry<00:01:40.130> about<00:01:40.250> getting<00:01:40.460> all

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:40.550 
possible don't worry about getting all

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:45.370 
possible don't worry about getting all
the<00:01:40.580> boxes<00:01:41.119> oh<00:01:42.490> damn<00:01:43.490> it<00:01:44.050> okay<00:01:45.050> that<00:01:45.200> went<00:01:45.320> a

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
the boxes oh damn it okay that went a

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.050 
the boxes oh damn it okay that went a
bit<00:01:45.470> wrong<00:01:45.530> in<00:01:46.039> with<00:01:46.280> like<00:01:46.399> support<00:01:46.759> and<00:01:46.940> all

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:47.060 
bit wrong in with like support and all

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:48.670 
bit wrong in with like support and all
obviously<00:01:47.479> would<00:01:47.690> use<00:01:48.110> the<00:01:48.229> rain<00:01:48.410> power

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:48.680 
obviously would use the rain power

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.150 
obviously would use the rain power
because<00:01:49.100> you<00:01:49.690> know<00:01:50.690> otherwise<00:01:50.750> it's<00:01:51.710> possible

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:52.160 
because you know otherwise it's possible

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:53.469 
because you know otherwise it's possible
to<00:01:52.220> do<00:01:52.310> it<00:01:52.340> without<00:01:52.460> it<00:01:52.610> but<00:01:52.940> it's<00:01:53.119> a<00:01:53.390> lot

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
to do it without it but it's a lot

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:56.170 
to do it without it but it's a lot
harder<00:01:53.539> and<00:01:54.110> you<00:01:54.500> need<00:01:54.649> to<00:01:54.770> play<00:01:54.920> backs<00:01:55.160> and<00:01:55.520> a

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 
harder and you need to play backs and a

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.930 
harder and you need to play backs and a
cooter<00:01:56.630> get<00:01:57.050> through<00:01:57.229> this<00:01:57.320> wall<00:01:57.500> of<00:01:57.619> nitro

00:01:59.930 --> 00:01:59.940 
cooter get through this wall of nitro

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:06.700 
cooter get through this wall of nitro
Oh<00:02:00.000> God

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209 
did use like I said before to use the

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:49.870 
did use like I said before to use the
powers<00:03:47.450> a<00:03:47.630> lot<00:03:47.750> more<00:03:48.310> and<00:03:49.310> the<00:03:49.430> levels<00:03:49.700> weren't

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:49.880 
powers a lot more and the levels weren't

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:50.920 
powers a lot more and the levels weren't
bad<00:03:50.030> although<00:03:50.450> there<00:03:50.570> were<00:03:50.630> a<00:03:50.660> lot<00:03:50.900> of

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
bad although there were a lot of

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:53.800 
bad although there were a lot of
duplicates<00:03:51.709> I<00:03:51.860> mean<00:03:52.400> come<00:03:52.700> on<00:03:52.790> there<00:03:53.299> was<00:03:53.420> free

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900 
different even really the only time

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:06.940 
different even really the only time
there's<00:04:06.049> any<00:04:06.079> sort<00:04:06.410> of<00:04:06.500> difference<00:04:06.620> was<00:04:06.860> the

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:06.950 
there's any sort of difference was the

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:08.000
