00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:09.870
 hamburger proudly calls her the tor of the world 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:12.030
 city ​​port and trading metropolis in 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.190
 north of germany for many years 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:18.810
 host international sports events 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:21.029
 cyclassics hanse marathon triathlon now 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.010
 the big goal the Hanseatic city wants 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.420
 the olympic games supreme 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.250
 werbeträgers the just re-elected 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.250
 mayor olaf scholz 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.760
 we have it all very well 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.190
 I feel that there are many 

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.810
 are very enthusiastic and of course hope 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.480
 me that the enthusiasm here many 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:40.250
 then others have motivated us too 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.510
 to give order with germany 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.340
 Join us for these games too 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.809
 apply 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.670
 Games of short distances should become it 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:48.949
 the olympic terrain planned on one 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.600
 central area in the harbor most 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:52.550
 venues in the area of ​​ten 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.440
 kilometers one part should after the 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:57.290
 play be dismantled again 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.350
 from previous gigantism this concept 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:01.430
 arrives 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.809
 I think that hamburg actually one 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.370
 has a very good chance because it is just one 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:06.080
 very good overall concept of the example 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:07.280
 now perceived and the city 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.159
 of course a lot 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.590
 hamburg has good chances because that 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:13.729
 yes, make everything sustainable, of course 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.950
 difficult to Berlin, it was the 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:18.229
 is capital and has been there before 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.820
 because we have something to hamburg 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:21.560
 starts then does not bring to an end 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.150
 best examples have before we do that 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.820
 should not have the money at olympia 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:28.190
 advertise the concert house elbphilharmonie 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:30.380
 still under construction and now ten times 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:32.270
 as expensive as originally planned that 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.000
 favorite example of the olympia critic 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:37.250
 around two billion euros are alone 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.020
 estimated for the sports 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:43.660
 not just the hard to calculate 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:45.620
 Total costs disturb the opponents in a lot 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:47.780
 You can really do inner city areas 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:49.460
 say the hell is going on the quarters 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.420
 We now have rent the 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.700
 explode 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.130
 and here comes an olympia country 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.740
 within a short time that is called here 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.600
 I'll massively increase the critic 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.820
 get into the boat with the wild frederik 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.710
 brown from the initiative for olympia 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.410
 his team relies on the reform will of the 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.730
 ioc for more modest games and you 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:10.190
 kindly restrained is not in vain 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:11.540
 hamburg hamburg slogan i believe we 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.890
 can do that and that's what you do 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.690
 if you feel with the skeptics 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.280
 she does not want to talk anymore 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.239
 this gigantism you want the sport 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.860
 again in the foreground have the 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:20.420
 humanity and hamburg also wants that 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:23.090
 and I think that fits together 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.860
 last week staged 20,000 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.349
 People symbolic the Olympic fire 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.660
 around the binnenalster four times as 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:32.390
 many as expected a signal for the 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:35.170
 Organizers hamburgs citizens stand 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.170
 behind the application
