do this so they expected Trank to do
this<00:03:34.990> after<00:03:35.990> that<00:03:36.140> it<00:03:36.440> is<00:03:36.560> alleged<00:03:37.160> that<00:03:37.550> Trank

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
this after that it is alleged that Trank

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:39.490 
this after that it is alleged that Trank
brought<00:03:38.810> something<00:03:39.140> to<00:03:39.170> them<00:03:39.350> that<00:03:39.470> they

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
brought something to them that they

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.020 
brought something to them that they
didn't<00:03:39.770> like<00:03:39.950> so<00:03:40.130> they<00:03:40.220> tweaked<00:03:40.520> it<00:03:40.640> anyway

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
didn't like so they tweaked it anyway

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:42.790 
didn't like so they tweaked it anyway
and<00:03:41.060> that's<00:03:41.630> what<00:03:41.900> we<00:03:41.990> have<00:03:42.200> is<00:03:42.380> the<00:03:42.500> final

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:42.800 
and that's what we have is the final

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.680 
and that's what we have is the final
product<00:03:43.220> it<00:03:43.400> is<00:03:43.580> not<00:03:43.820> reviewed<00:03:44.209> well<00:03:44.420> by

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
product it is not reviewed well by

product it is not reviewed well by
critics<00:03:45.050> it<00:03:45.260> is<00:03:45.410> not<00:03:45.620> received<00:03:46.520> well<00:03:46.700> by

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 
critics it is not received well by

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.930 
critics it is not received well by
audiences<00:03:47.300> and<00:03:47.810> it<00:03:48.650> probably<00:03:48.950> is<00:03:49.250> not<00:03:49.430> going<00:03:49.730> I

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:49.940 
audiences and it probably is not going I

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:52.720 
audiences and it probably is not going I
think<00:03:50.209> it's<00:03:50.330> the<00:03:50.540> worst<00:03:50.930> superhero<00:03:51.890> movie

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:52.730 
think it's the worst superhero movie

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:54.880 
think it's the worst superhero movie
opening<00:03:53.180> so<00:03:53.570> yeah<00:03:53.780> it's<00:03:53.930> it's<00:03:54.170> nine<00:03:54.410> percent

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:54.890 
opening so yeah it's it's nine percent

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:56.710 
opening so yeah it's it's nine percent

from the start was with studio meddling

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:19.090 
from the start was with studio meddling
and<00:04:15.980> maybe<00:04:16.850> the<00:04:17.090> director<00:04:17.570> didn't<00:04:17.959> work<00:04:18.920> as

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:19.100 
and maybe the director didn't work as

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:23.290 
and maybe the director didn't work as
well<00:04:19.130> as<00:04:19.520> he<00:04:19.640> could<00:04:19.820> have<00:04:20.060> with<00:04:21.020> people<00:04:22.300> it's

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.300

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130 
hard to say yeah it's really hard to say

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:26.080 
hard to say yeah it's really hard to say
but

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090 
but

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:29.409 
but
how<00:04:26.600> do<00:04:26.900> movies<00:04:27.320> escape<00:04:27.710> this<00:04:27.949> fate<00:04:28.220> with<00:04:29.210> you

00:04:29.409 --> 00:04:29.419 
how do movies escape this fate with you

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:32.409 
how do movies escape this fate with you
know<00:04:29.540> having<00:04:30.020> certain<00:04:31.210> requirements<00:04:32.210> put<00:04:32.330> on

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:32.419 
know having certain requirements put on

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:33.820 
know having certain requirements put on
by<00:04:32.540> the<00:04:32.570> studio's<00:04:33.050> like<00:04:33.199> we<00:04:33.320> we<00:04:33.620> knew<00:04:33.800> that

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:33.830 
by the studio's like we we knew that

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:35.890 
by the studio's like we we knew that
dark<00:04:34.370> night<00:04:34.430> had<00:04:34.790> to<00:04:34.820> be<00:04:34.940> have<00:04:35.270> this<00:04:35.510> certain

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:35.900 
dark night had to be have this certain

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:39.219 
dark night had to be have this certain
tone<00:04:36.350> and<00:04:36.620> it<00:04:36.830> worked<00:04:37.100> great<00:04:37.699> but<00:04:38.270> obviously

00:04:39.219 --> 00:04:39.229 
tone and it worked great but obviously

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:40.870 
tone and it worked great but obviously
it<00:04:39.350> doesn't<00:04:39.500> work<00:04:39.710> all<00:04:39.919> the<00:04:40.010> way<00:04:40.040> around<00:04:40.220> and

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:40.880 
it doesn't work all the way around and

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.060 
it doesn't work all the way around and
certain<00:04:41.570> things<00:04:41.600> needed<00:04:42.199> to<00:04:42.229> be<00:04:42.320> followed<00:04:42.830> I

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:43.070 
certain things needed to be followed I

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:45.250 
certain things needed to be followed I
think<00:04:43.669> you<00:04:44.030> know<00:04:44.120> in<00:04:44.240> terms<00:04:44.360> of<00:04:44.570> all<00:04:44.780> the<00:04:44.990> the

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:45.260 
think you know in terms of all the the

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.110 
think you know in terms of all the the
superhero<00:04:45.710> properties<00:04:46.280> that<00:04:46.490> Fox<00:04:46.820> has<00:04:46.970> had

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.120 
superhero properties that Fox has had

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.580 
superhero properties that Fox has had
control<00:04:47.360> over<00:04:47.540> i<00:04:47.780> think<00:04:48.050> deadpool<00:04:48.350> is<00:04:48.380> going

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:48.590 
control over i think deadpool is going

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:50.040 
control over i think deadpool is going
to<00:04:48.650> be<00:04:48.740> one<00:04:48.860> of<00:04:48.889> the<00:04:48.979> most<00:04:49.100> fully<00:04:49.610> realized

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050 
to be one of the most fully realized

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:53.020 
to be one of the most fully realized
superhero<00:04:51.050> films<00:04:51.380> in<00:04:51.590> in<00:04:51.919> their<00:04:52.100> pocket<00:04:52.520> and<00:04:52.699> i

this is from the girl who hates
Fantastic<00:05:00.710> Four<00:05:00.889> by<00:05:01.070> the<00:05:01.130> way<00:05:01.340> I<00:05:01.550> just<00:05:02.180> feel

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:02.300 
Fantastic Four by the way I just feel

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:03.460 
Fantastic Four by the way I just feel
like<00:05:02.450> everyone's<00:05:02.870> like<00:05:02.930> they<00:05:03.080> should<00:05:03.260> give<00:05:03.350> it

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:03.470 
like everyone's like they should give it

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:04.840 
like everyone's like they should give it
back<00:05:03.530> to<00:05:03.680> Marvel<00:05:04.040> and<00:05:04.070> I'm<00:05:04.220> like<00:05:04.340> I<00:05:04.490> don't<00:05:04.520> know

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:04.850 
back to Marvel and I'm like I don't know

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:05.890 
back to Marvel and I'm like I don't know
I<00:05:04.880> think<00:05:05.210> if<00:05:05.300> they're<00:05:05.450> going<00:05:05.570> to<00:05:05.630> do<00:05:05.720> another

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:05.900 
I think if they're going to do another

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:07.330 
I think if they're going to do another
one<00:05:06.110> they<00:05:06.530> need<00:05:06.680> to<00:05:06.800> drop<00:05:07.070> this<00:05:07.130> whole

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:07.340 
one they need to drop this whole

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:09.640 
one they need to drop this whole
nitty-gritty<00:05:08.120> idea<00:05:08.840> and<00:05:09.110> just<00:05:09.290> let<00:05:09.410> it<00:05:09.500> be<00:05:09.530> a

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:09.650 
nitty-gritty idea and just let it be a

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:11.350 
nitty-gritty idea and just let it be a
fun<00:05:09.889> movie<00:05:10.190> I<00:05:10.310> mean<00:05:10.460> it<00:05:10.610> seems<00:05:10.850> like<00:05:10.940> this<00:05:11.180> is<00:05:11.240> a

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:11.360 
fun movie I mean it seems like this is a

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.030 
fun movie I mean it seems like this is a
