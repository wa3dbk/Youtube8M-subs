a charcoal gray one a black one and this
like<00:03:42.000> oatmeal<00:03:42.480> color<00:03:42.810> dish<00:03:43.320> grey<00:03:43.860> one<00:03:45.140> but<00:03:46.140> I

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
like oatmeal color dish grey one but I

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:47.360 
like oatmeal color dish grey one but I
figured<00:03:46.530> you<00:03:46.590> can't<00:03:46.769> really<00:03:46.890> beat<00:03:47.130> three

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
figured you can't really beat three

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:48.890 
figured you can't really beat three
dollars<00:03:47.670> and<00:03:47.790> eighty<00:03:47.880> cents<00:03:48.150> and<00:03:48.420> even<00:03:48.810> if

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
dollars and eighty cents and even if

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:49.820 
dollars and eighty cents and even if
they're<00:03:49.080> probably<00:03:49.260> not<00:03:49.620> the<00:03:49.800> greatest

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:49.830 
they're probably not the greatest

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:52.790 
they're probably not the greatest
quality<00:03:50.519> the<00:03:50.670> last<00:03:50.910> min<00:03:51.120> couple<00:03:51.330> uses<00:03:51.660> so<00:03:51.930> why

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:52.800 
quality the last min couple uses so why

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.320 
quality the last min couple uses so why
not<00:03:52.980> and<00:03:53.280> I'm<00:03:53.370> kind<00:03:53.580> of<00:03:53.640> low<00:03:53.790> on<00:03:53.940> basics

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.330 
not and I'm kind of low on basics

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:57.500 
not and I'm kind of low on basics

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
anyways so worked out perfectly then I

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:00.410
