00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:04.850 
going to be really split throughout the

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:06.340 
going to be really split throughout the
fight<00:04:05.030> most<00:04:05.269> of<00:04:05.330> the<00:04:05.390> time<00:04:05.600> it's<00:04:06.080> going<00:04:06.170> to<00:04:06.260> be

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:06.350 
fight most of the time it's going to be

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:07.570 
fight most of the time it's going to be
a<00:04:06.380> lot<00:04:06.530> on<00:04:06.650> the<00:04:06.739> front<00:04:06.980> line<00:04:07.130> unless<00:04:07.340> the

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:07.580 
a lot on the front line unless the

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:09.280 
a lot on the front line unless the
priority<00:04:07.910> target<00:04:08.209> is<00:04:08.299> out<00:04:08.420> of<00:04:08.450> position<00:04:08.570> and

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.290 
priority target is out of position and

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:10.990 
priority target is out of position and
so<00:04:09.470> with<00:04:09.650> lich<00:04:09.830> bane<00:04:10.040> then<00:04:10.400> you<00:04:10.549> can<00:04:10.700> kind<00:04:10.910> of

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:11.000 
so with lich bane then you can kind of

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.729 
so with lich bane then you can kind of
be<00:04:11.090> using<00:04:11.390> a<00:04:11.420> lip<00:04:11.540> rocks<00:04:11.959> and<00:04:12.080> everyone<00:04:12.380> rather

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:12.739 
be using a lip rocks and everyone rather

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:14.289 
be using a lip rocks and everyone rather
than<00:04:12.920> only<00:04:13.130> putting<00:04:13.489> the<00:04:13.640> death<00:04:13.820> glare<00:04:13.940> on<00:04:14.060> one

00:04:14.289 --> 00:04:14.299 
than only putting the death glare on one

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:16.719 
than only putting the death glare on one
and<00:04:14.540> so<00:04:15.140> I<00:04:15.470> don't<00:04:15.890> always<00:04:16.190> go<00:04:16.310> deaf<00:04:16.519> by<00:04:16.669> a

00:04:16.719 --> 00:04:16.729 
and so I don't always go deaf by a

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:18.280 
and so I don't always go deaf by a
second<00:04:17.150> but<00:04:17.330> for<00:04:17.479> most<00:04:17.600> of<00:04:17.750> the<00:04:17.840> time<00:04:18.019> i<00:04:18.049> will

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:18.290 
second but for most of the time i will

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:19.779 
second but for most of the time i will
like<00:04:18.590> that<00:04:18.620> game<00:04:18.950> you<00:04:19.070> saw<00:04:19.220> me<00:04:19.280> go<00:04:19.430> zone<00:04:19.640> use

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:19.789 
like that game you saw me go zone use

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:21.670 
like that game you saw me go zone use

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:21.680 
because of the car thistle and so I

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:22.960 
because of the car thistle and so I
don't<00:04:21.830> know<00:04:21.890> I<00:04:21.919> just<00:04:22.010> feel<00:04:22.220> like<00:04:22.340> it<00:04:22.580> fits<00:04:22.610> my

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:22.970 
don't know I just feel like it fits my

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:23.300 
don't know I just feel like it fits my
side

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
side

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:24.770
