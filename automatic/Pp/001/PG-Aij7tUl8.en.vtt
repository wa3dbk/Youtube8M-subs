Sweets Tales

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Today's tale is of a new kind of macaron made
at a sushi bar.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Kachidoki, Tokyo

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.500
The Tsukiji fish markets sits across the bridge.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:34.900
In this neighbourhood abundant with fish merchants,
plenty of fresh fish and shellfish can be found.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:42.000
Here in Kachidoki is Sushidokoro Hashida.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.000
"Welcome"

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.800
At first glance, it seems like a normal sushi bar...

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.500
Here's your macaron.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.600
Desserts is none other than a macaron!

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.200
Wow, that's soft!

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.500
This pairs great with the green tea.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:11.000
The idea came from the second-genertaion owner,
Kenjiro Hashida.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.500
Kenjiro was catering a party for fashion brand
Junko Koshino.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.600
Kenjiro's sushi was a hit,

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:32.200
but when macarons were brought out for dessert,
the guests at once moved over to try them.

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.700
I felt like I had lost,
so I thought I should make macarons too.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Kenjiro made up his mind to create Japanese-style macarons that only a sushi chef could make.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:52.000
First he grinds fragrant roasted houjicha green tea into a powder, which he kneads into the macaron mixture.

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:58.900
I chose houjicha because I didnâ€™t want to use matcha as everyone does to add Japanese flavor.

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:07.100
For filling, red bean paste.
Butter is added to give it a smoother texture.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.200
I thought I wold have not chance of winning if I just made regular macarons.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:21.500
Over half a year of trial and error and the houjicha macarons were perfected.

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.300
In addition, a citrusy yuzu macaron

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.100
and a bitter-yet-fragrant bamboo charcoal matcha macaron were created.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.600
You only get to choose one flavor for desserts.

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.800
Make sure you choose carefully.
