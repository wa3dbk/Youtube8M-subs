 that nude lipstick that I'm wearing 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:05.880
 What I'm going to show you is the eudora. 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:07.679

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.149
 can replace your lipstick with 

00:01:07.679 --> 00:01:11.009

 and so I get the original color lyon 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.530
 is a contour very similar to the tone of the 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.210
