00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
anybody to jump in the past we use the

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.980 
anybody to jump in the past we use the
present<00:01:50.549> day<00:01:50.670> as<00:01:50.909> also<00:01:51.270> a<00:01:51.420> place<00:01:51.689> where<00:01:51.899> you

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
present day as also a place where you

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.020

can have a lot of collectibles of course

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.450 
can have a lot of collectibles of course
there<00:01:54.210> will<00:01:54.329> be<00:01:54.390> sick<00:01:55.290> fats<00:01:55.530> perhaps<00:01:56.159> taboo

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
there will be sick fats perhaps taboo

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.310 
there will be sick fats perhaps taboo
but<00:01:56.670> we<00:01:56.820> also<00:01:56.969> decided<00:01:57.540> to<00:01:57.719> do<00:01:57.869> something<00:01:58.079> that

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
but we also decided to do something that

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.139 
but we also decided to do something that
is<00:01:58.469> a<00:01:58.500> crossover<00:01:58.920> for<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.399> past<00:01:59.670> and<00:01:59.909> the

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
is a crossover for the past and the

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.810 
is a crossover for the past and the
multiplayer<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:01.409> idea<00:02:01.740> is<00:02:01.860> that<00:02:02.040> when<00:02:02.670> you're

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
multiplayer the idea is that when you're

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.310 
multiplayer the idea is that when you're
doing<00:02:02.969> good<00:02:03.270> when<00:02:03.479> you're<00:02:03.630> progressing<00:02:03.840> in

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
doing good when you're progressing in

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.260 
doing good when you're progressing in
the<00:02:04.439> game<00:02:04.649> you<00:02:05.040> receive<00:02:05.430> some<00:02:05.729> action<00:02:06.090> figures
