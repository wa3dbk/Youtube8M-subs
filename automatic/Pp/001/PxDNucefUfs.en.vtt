00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.240
 in Brazil the average consumption per person of 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.990
 ovine meat is 700 grams per year in the 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.150
 power 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.130
 the amount is still small if 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.790
 compared with the consumption of beef 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:17.279
 for example that reaches 46 kilos per 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.320
 person / year comprising the southern region 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.170
 country and location factor 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:25.350
 geography of the gaucho towns 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.630
 as gay Uruguayan and Santana of the 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:31.349
 are the ones that consume the most 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:34.890
 ovine meat reaching 32 kilos per year 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:37.590
 despite being a meat considered expensive 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.050
 for the low supply a municipality of marau 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.870
 there are people who prefer to swap the sim 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:46.649
 BBQ for this type of meat is more 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:49.170
 I like tasty is really like in every 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.920
 buy is also kind affection is good thanks 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.870
 the penalty 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.360
 the draft and the sheep meat is difficult 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:58.530
 choose but still think that stay novel 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:01.469
 It's still but it 's hot but light so there's 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:04.260
 15 years Erley keeps this restaurant 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:07.020
 together with his sister and brother-in-law in 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.450
 the investment that at the time cost 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.760
 one million and a half Reais with erlei 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.520
 first decided to invest in a herd 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.960
 of sheep came to work five years 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.750
 with dairy cattle 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.180
 but the need to serve beef 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.490
 of quality in the restaurant made him 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.369
 working with a herd today 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.860
 to create a lamb so good the cost 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.619
 his annual turnover is around $ 150 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:35.040
 producing is not easy but I have a 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:38.640

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.689
 Lambs insurance they closed until the 60 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.270
 days of data 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:44.430

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.680
 confinement there I prepare the lopes to 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.350

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.929
 every need to have a good goalkeeper 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.970
 the whole process goes from production 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:13.800
 reproduction to confinement 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.770
 for slaughter and 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:21.360
 where major difficulties appear 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:23.760

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.030
 over here takes you there but the return of 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.370
 charge back right 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.170
 concerned with the health of animals of 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.330

 they are careful in the handling part 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:04.560
 sanitation is mainly about 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:06.780
 verminoses, not the university of step 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.250

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:21.330

 developing production cap 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.880
 and methodologies in ways that 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:34.560
 producers may use to produce 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:37.050
 quality sheepmeat in its 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:39.360
