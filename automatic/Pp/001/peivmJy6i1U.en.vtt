handhold and elderberry just kind of

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.340 
handhold and elderberry just kind of
double<00:00:42.329> looped<00:00:42.510> around<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:43.070> spindle<00:00:44.070> and

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:45.350 
double looped around the spindle and

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.840 
double looped around the spindle and
just<00:00:46.350> some<00:00:46.559> nylon<00:00:47.010> point<00:00:47.340> I've<00:00:47.700> been

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
just some nylon point I've been

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.090 
just some nylon point I've been
experimenting<00:00:48.600> with<00:00:48.899> natural<00:00:49.410> cordage<00:00:49.770> but

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
experimenting with natural cordage but

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.490 
experimenting with natural cordage but
it<00:00:50.160> hasn't<00:00:50.460> been<00:00:50.550> working<00:00:50.730> out<00:00:50.940> too<00:00:51.149> well<00:00:51.500> but

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
it hasn't been working out too well but

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.740 
it hasn't been working out too well but
at<00:00:52.590> least<00:00:52.730> the<00:00:53.730> goal<00:00:53.940> is<00:00:54.149> just<00:00:54.180> to<00:00:54.420> see<00:00:54.600> how

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
at least the goal is just to see how

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:27.590 
at least the goal is just to see how
elderberry<00:00:55.440> works<00:00:55.940> so<00:00:56.940> here<00:00:57.210> goes

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:51.310 

mmm

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:02:02.430 

Wow<00:01:51.890> very<00:01:52.340> nice

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:02.440 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:07.420 

awesome

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:07.430 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.690 

alright<00:02:08.240> just<00:02:08.539> found<00:02:08.750> another<00:02:09.399> would<00:02:10.399> it's

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
alright just found another would it's

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.080 
alright just found another would it's
reasonably<00:02:11.420> prevalent<00:02:12.070> in<00:02:13.070> the<00:02:13.250> woods<00:02:13.460> my

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
reasonably prevalent in the woods my

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:21.780 
reasonably prevalent in the woods my
area<00:02:15.010> so<00:02:16.010> the<00:02:16.070> elderberry<00:02:16.490> bush<00:02:20.500> Nicole<00:02:21.500> here

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
area so the elderberry bush Nicole here

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.820 
area so the elderberry bush Nicole here
not<00:02:22.790> too<00:02:23.060> hard<00:02:23.270> I<00:02:23.480> guess<00:02:23.540> effort<00:02:24.320> wise<00:02:24.470> so

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
not too hard I guess effort wise so

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:30.100 
not too hard I guess effort wise so
that's<00:02:25.010> a<00:02:25.340> plus<00:02:26.740> as<00:02:27.740> well<00:02:28.870> and<00:02:29.870> it<00:02:29.930> works

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
that's a plus as well and it works

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.550 
that's a plus as well and it works
pretty<00:02:30.290> well<00:02:30.440> for<00:02:30.560> a<00:02:30.950> smaller<00:02:31.220> set
