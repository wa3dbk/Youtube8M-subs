00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:13.980
 hello my name is william sanchez 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.740
 work team lose the belly 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.830
 puntocom in this video I want to share 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.860
 with you what mechanisms push us to 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.840
 eat more than necessary to know the 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:26.939
 mechanisms that push us to eat more 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.550
 what we need we can help 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:32.160
 neutralize them and thereby lose weight and 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.200
 maintain a healthy weight what we 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.970
 push to eat is not only the 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.250
 need to maintain the balance 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:40.980
 energetic of our body is to say 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:44.280
 replenish the spent energy but there is 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.770
 certain foods basically the sweets 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.320
 greasy and salty whose intake we 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:52.650
 produces great satisfaction and there 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:55.050
 the scientific problems of the 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:57.000
 University of Birmingham united kingdom 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.010
 They proposed to find out what the 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.230
 common factors of the foods that 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.720
 more they awaken the desire to eat in the 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.700
 people found that they are the ones who 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:08.759
 flavor is enhanced by some of 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.369
 these three ingredients salt sugar and 

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:13.710
 fats are three ingredients that 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.750
 consumed in excess can be 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.010
 dangerous to health 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.750
 the last two also produce obesity 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:24.630
 it seems clear that they like the appetizers 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.470
 salty sweet desserts drinks 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:30.479
 sugary fried foods junk food 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:33.240
 but because they are precisely those 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.880
 flavors the ones we like the most is something 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.910
 cultural or on the contrary a kind 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.950
 of natural tendency the experts 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:43.260
 they claim that people tend to 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.869
 consume sweets and salty beyond the 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:48.509
 mere energy replacement by the 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.970
 otherwise, we tend to reject flavors 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.160
 bitter and sour and that's something they do 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.830
 also animals even if they are 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:58.050
 deprive of food therefore you are 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:01.080
 preferences would be conditioned by 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:03.600
 natural factors there may be in them 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.580
 evolutionary factors since the flavors 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.009
 bitter are often related to 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:10.440
 certain toxic compounds some 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.510
 of them deadly while the taste 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.150
 acid is frequently given in food 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.550
 that are in poor condition like this 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.500
 preferences already discussed would protect 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.910
 animals and people from the intake of 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.790
 foods that can be very 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.849
 harmful 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:27.280
 for health before serving us a 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:29.530
 certain ration open a bag of 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.840
 potatoes while we watch television or 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:34.269
 order a tasty and fattening dessert in 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:37.569
 the restaurant we should ask ourselves 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:40.989
 I'm really hungry and we'll see that the 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:44.950
 answer often is not gluttony 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:47.170
 is to eat for pleasure if we act then 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.900
 consequently we will realize 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.700
 that many times to lose weight is not 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.220
 need to go hungry 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.959
 it is enough to contain it in gluttony if the 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.780
 information that I just shared 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:03.220
