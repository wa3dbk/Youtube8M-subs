middle pickup or the middle switch and

roll off the bridge pick up a little bit

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:28.099 
roll off the bridge pick up a little bit
now<00:02:26.819> you<00:02:26.879> get<00:02:27.120> a<00:02:27.150> little<00:02:27.209> bit<00:02:27.569> of<00:02:27.689> the<00:02:27.780> bleed

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:28.109 
now you get a little bit of the bleed

00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:29.390 
now you get a little bit of the bleed
through<00:02:28.349> of<00:02:28.560> this<00:02:28.739> but<00:02:28.950> you<00:02:29.069> still<00:02:29.280> get

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
through of this but you still get

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:39.410
