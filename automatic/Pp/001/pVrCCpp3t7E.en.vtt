00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.740 
we'll just do half a clove to start with
get<00:01:52.560> that<00:01:52.710> in<00:01:52.939> and<00:01:53.939> then<00:01:54.390> we'll<00:01:54.479> mix<00:01:54.569> those

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
get that in and then we'll mix those

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.929 
get that in and then we'll mix those
together<00:01:55.280> now<00:01:56.280> this<00:01:56.399> is<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:56.579> important<00:01:56.969> part

00:01:58.929 --> 00:01:58.939 
together now this is the important part

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:01.940 
together now this is the important part

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
you add the oil too fast it will split

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.140 
you add the oil too fast it will split
and<00:02:15.900> it<00:02:15.989> won't<00:02:16.140> look<00:02:16.260> nice<00:02:16.760> it's<00:02:17.760> the<00:02:17.819> only<00:02:17.940> one

enough<00:03:18.690> I<00:03:19.049> don't<00:03:19.349> think<00:03:19.470> I'm<00:03:19.620> probably<00:03:19.769> going

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
enough I don't think I'm probably going

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.000 
enough I don't think I'm probably going
to<00:03:20.010> need<00:03:20.099> any<00:03:20.310> more<00:03:20.430> I<00:03:21.410> do<00:03:22.410> want<00:03:22.620> to<00:03:22.650> have<00:03:22.799> it<00:03:22.919> a

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
little bit thicker than this so I'm

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:25.580

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019 
oil once it started to thicken up you

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:33.409

can<00:03:31.319> add<00:03:31.530> the<00:03:31.650> oil<00:03:31.769> a<00:03:32.040> little<00:03:32.489> bit<00:03:32.639> quicker<00:03:32.940> but

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:33.419 
can add the oil a little bit quicker but

00:03:33.419 --> 00:03:36.370 
can add the oil a little bit quicker but
be<00:03:33.569> careful<00:03:34.010> still<00:03:35.010> keep<00:03:35.190> it<00:03:35.310> nice<00:03:35.430> and<00:03:35.459> slow
