away<00:02:20.819> from<00:02:20.849> the<00:02:21.090> box<00:02:21.390> it<00:02:21.629> is<00:02:21.659> sitting<00:02:22.140> up<00:02:22.260> on

00:02:22.399 --> 00:02:22.409 
away from the box it is sitting up on

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:27.460 
away from the box it is sitting up on
some<00:02:22.620> saw<00:02:22.829> horses<00:02:23.250> and<00:02:23.970> as<00:02:24.840> you<00:02:25.140> can<00:02:25.379> see<00:02:25.849> the

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
some saw horses and as you can see the

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.539 
some saw horses and as you can see the

lighting the top back cover and a couple

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:37.190 
lighting the top back cover and a couple
other<00:02:32.790> things<00:02:33.109> maybe<00:02:34.109> even<00:02:34.530> the<00:02:35.780> the<00:02:36.780> ballast

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
other things maybe even the the ballast

other things maybe even the the ballast
and<00:02:37.439> etc<00:02:37.739> may<00:02:38.310> be<00:02:38.370> boxed<00:02:38.879> inside<00:02:39.239> that<00:02:39.510> appears

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
and etc may be boxed inside that appears

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.059 
and etc may be boxed inside that appears
to<00:02:40.140> be<00:02:40.319> some<00:02:40.950> type<00:02:40.980> of<00:02:41.269> electrical<00:02:43.069> packaging

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069 
to be some type of electrical packaging

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:47.360 
to be some type of electrical packaging
inside<00:02:44.519> the<00:02:44.879> tank<00:02:45.500> the<00:02:46.500> electrical<00:02:47.190> side

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
inside the tank the electrical side

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.110 
inside the tank the electrical side
panel<00:02:47.909> is<00:02:48.180> missing<00:02:49.079> in<00:02:49.440> shipping<00:02:50.400> so<00:02:50.579> I<00:02:50.609> assume

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
panel is missing in shipping so I assume

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.199 
panel is missing in shipping so I assume
that<00:02:51.150> may<00:02:51.510> be<00:02:51.569> in<00:02:51.750> that<00:02:51.900> box<00:02:52.109> as<00:02:52.409> well<00:02:52.970> the<00:02:53.970> top

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
that may be in that box as well the top

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:56.960 
that may be in that box as well the top
according<00:02:55.200> to<00:02:55.290> the<00:02:55.409> instructions<00:02:55.980> needs<00:02:56.760> to

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
according to the instructions needs to

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.360 
according to the instructions needs to
be<00:02:57.120> removed<00:02:57.540> now<00:02:57.930> one<00:02:58.739> thing<00:02:58.920> that<00:02:58.980> I<00:02:59.159> found

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
be removed now one thing that I found

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.649 
be removed now one thing that I found
interesting<00:02:59.609> is<00:03:00.450> the<00:03:00.840> the<00:03:01.470> back<00:03:01.790> is<00:03:02.790> black

00:03:03.649 --> 00:03:03.659 
interesting is the the back is black

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:06.199 
interesting is the the back is black
glass<00:03:04.049> so<00:03:04.769> you<00:03:04.829> can't<00:03:05.220> actually<00:03:05.459> see<00:03:05.670> into<00:03:06.090> the

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
glass so you can't actually see into the

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:10.089 
glass so you can't actually see into the
tank<00:03:06.450> from<00:03:06.840> the<00:03:06.930> back<00:03:07.260> sort<00:03:07.920> of<00:03:08.040> kinda<00:03:08.400> and

00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:10.099 
tank from the back sort of kinda and

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:13.099 
tank from the back sort of kinda and
walking<00:03:11.099> around<00:03:11.489> you<00:03:12.120> can<00:03:12.239> see<00:03:12.510> that<00:03:12.870> there<00:03:13.079> is

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:13.109 
walking around you can see that there is

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:17.180 
walking around you can see that there is
a<00:03:13.409> water<00:03:13.709> level<00:03:14.689> window<00:03:15.689> that<00:03:16.650> you<00:03:16.859> can<00:03:17.010> also

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
a water level window that you can also

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:22.099 
a water level window that you can also
see<00:03:18.500> into<00:03:19.500> the<00:03:20.340> sump<00:03:21.120> area<00:03:21.269> for<00:03:21.720> lack<00:03:21.870> of<00:03:21.900> a

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:22.109 
see into the sump area for lack of a

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:23.330 
see into the sump area for lack of a
better<00:03:22.230> word<00:03:22.500> of<00:03:22.709> the<00:03:22.799> tank

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
better word of the tank

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.210 
better word of the tank
but<00:03:24.030> anyway<00:03:24.329> I'm<00:03:24.690> going<00:03:24.840> to<00:03:24.959> take<00:03:25.169> the<00:03:25.410> top<00:03:25.949> off

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
but anyway I'm going to take the top off

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.720 
but anyway I'm going to take the top off
it<00:03:26.609> says<00:03:27.599> it's<00:03:27.810> time<00:03:28.230> to<00:03:28.290> remove<00:03:28.769> the<00:03:28.949> top<00:03:29.190> and

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
it says it's time to remove the top and

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.309 
it says it's time to remove the top and
I'm<00:03:29.970> going<00:03:30.090> to<00:03:30.150> take<00:03:30.329> that<00:03:30.540> into<00:03:30.780> the<00:03:30.810> kitchen

00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:31.319 
I'm going to take that into the kitchen

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:33.860 
I'm going to take that into the kitchen
and<00:03:31.650> empty<00:03:32.459> the<00:03:32.609> inside<00:03:33.000> out<00:03:33.269> taking<00:03:33.720> those

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
and empty the inside out taking those

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.420 
and empty the inside out taking those
into<00:03:34.199> the<00:03:34.319> kitchen<00:03:34.620> as<00:03:34.709> well<00:03:34.859> and<00:03:35.099> we'll<00:03:35.220> see

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
into the kitchen as well and we'll see

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.240 
into the kitchen as well and we'll see
if<00:03:35.549> I've<00:03:35.699> got<00:03:36.260> the<00:03:37.260> strength<00:03:37.560> to<00:03:37.859> you<00:03:37.949> carry

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
if I've got the strength to you carry

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.500 
if I've got the strength to you carry
this<00:03:38.569> bad<00:03:39.569> boy<00:03:40.250> by<00:03:41.250> myself<00:03:41.729> I<00:03:42.030> may<00:03:42.269> have<00:03:42.389> to

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
this bad boy by myself I may have to

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:47.210 
this bad boy by myself I may have to
call<00:03:42.659> for<00:03:42.930> a<00:03:42.989> backup<00:03:45.409> sorry<00:03:46.409> folks<00:03:46.769> but<00:03:46.949> it's

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
call for a backup sorry folks but it's

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.289 
call for a backup sorry folks but it's
getting<00:03:47.579> late<00:03:47.760> and<00:03:47.790> I'm<00:03:48.060> losing<00:03:48.510> light<00:03:48.780> but

00:03:50.289 --> 00:03:50.299 
getting late and I'm losing light but

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:52.789 
getting late and I'm losing light but
unbeknownst<00:03:51.299> to<00:03:51.449> me<00:03:51.870> there<00:03:52.139> is<00:03:52.500> a<00:03:52.530> little

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:52.799 
unbeknownst to me there is a little

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:56.240 
unbeknownst to me there is a little
assembly<00:03:53.340> required<00:03:54.560> the<00:03:55.560> instructions<00:03:56.099> are

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
assembly required the instructions are

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.089 
assembly required the instructions are
pretty<00:03:56.430> straightforward<00:03:57.180> but<00:03:57.989> you<00:03:58.680> have<00:03:58.859> two

00:03:59.089 --> 00:03:59.099 
pretty straightforward but you have two

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:03.580 
pretty straightforward but you have two
pumps<00:04:00.079> protein<00:04:01.079> skimmer<00:04:01.440> the<00:04:02.159> lights

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
pumps protein skimmer the lights

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:08.719 
pumps protein skimmer the lights
temperature<00:04:04.590> excuse<00:04:05.489> me<00:04:05.639> a<00:04:05.940> heater<00:04:06.269> and<00:04:07.729> the

00:04:08.719 --> 00:04:08.729 
temperature excuse me a heater and the

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:10.250 
temperature excuse me a heater and the
top<00:04:08.909> part<00:04:09.180> of<00:04:09.209> the<00:04:09.299> protein<00:04:09.599> skimmer<00:04:09.780> and<00:04:10.199> of

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
top part of the protein skimmer and of

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.619 
top part of the protein skimmer and of
course<00:04:10.440> some<00:04:10.650> filter<00:04:10.979> elements<00:04:11.400> but<00:04:12.090> it<00:04:12.419> looks

00:04:12.619 --> 00:04:12.629 
course some filter elements but it looks

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:14.119 
course some filter elements but it looks
pretty<00:04:12.870> straightforward<00:04:13.139> and<00:04:13.680> I<00:04:13.739> don't<00:04:13.799> think

00:04:14.119 --> 00:04:14.129 
pretty straightforward and I don't think

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:16.670 
pretty straightforward and I don't think
it'll<00:04:14.250> take<00:04:14.519> but<00:04:14.699> a<00:04:14.760> few<00:04:14.819> minutes<00:04:15.409> there<00:04:16.409> is

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
it'll take but a few minutes there is

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.330 
it'll take but a few minutes there is
the<00:04:16.859> tank

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:18.340 
the tank

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:22.470 
the tank
on<00:04:18.700> the<00:04:18.790> table<00:04:19.180> there<00:04:20.019> is<00:04:20.049> the<00:04:20.530> tank<00:04:20.889> I<00:04:21.310> did<00:04:22.270> not

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:22.480 
on the table there is the tank I did not

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:25.590 
on the table there is the tank I did not
water<00:04:22.840> test<00:04:23.290> it<00:04:23.560> because<00:04:24.460> I<00:04:24.970> quite<00:04:25.389> frankly

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:25.600 
water test it because I quite frankly

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.590 
water test it because I quite frankly
don't<00:04:25.930> have<00:04:26.260> the<00:04:26.530> time<00:04:26.790> and<00:04:27.790> I'm<00:04:28.270> assuming

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.600 
don't have the time and I'm assuming

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:29.909 
don't have the time and I'm assuming
they<00:04:28.900> wouldn't<00:04:29.139> have<00:04:29.230> shipped<00:04:29.440> it<00:04:29.560> to<00:04:29.590> me<00:04:29.830> if

00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:29.919 
they wouldn't have shipped it to me if

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:31.920 
they wouldn't have shipped it to me if
it's<00:04:30.040> gonna<00:04:30.160> leak<00:04:30.430> if<00:04:30.700> it<00:04:30.850> is<00:04:31.000> I<00:04:31.330> got<00:04:31.630> a<00:04:31.660> problem

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930 
it's gonna leak if it is I got a problem

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:35.190 
it's gonna leak if it is I got a problem
so<00:04:32.700> I'll<00:04:33.700> get<00:04:33.970> it<00:04:34.090> all<00:04:34.210> assembled<00:04:34.570> and<00:04:34.900> we'll

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:35.200 
so I'll get it all assembled and we'll

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.350 
so I'll get it all assembled and we'll
put<00:04:35.470> it<00:04:35.560> together<00:04:35.680> with<00:04:36.100> the<00:04:36.490> lights<00:04:36.910> turn<00:04:37.210> it

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 
put it together with the lights turn it

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.190 
put it together with the lights turn it
on<00:04:37.510> and<00:04:37.720> see<00:04:38.050> what<00:04:38.169> you<00:04:38.230> think<00:04:39.720> okay

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:41.200 
on and see what you think okay

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:48.080 
on and see what you think okay
so<00:04:41.700> there<00:04:42.700> is<00:04:43.060> the<00:04:43.540> red<00:04:44.080> c-max<00:04:44.850> 250<00:04:46.560> completely

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 
so there is the red c-max 250 completely

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:51.600 
so there is the red c-max 250 completely
assembled<00:04:49.090> certainly<00:04:49.870> not<00:04:50.020> ready<00:04:50.290> to<00:04:50.380> go<00:04:50.610> but

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:51.610 
assembled certainly not ready to go but

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:56.219 
assembled certainly not ready to go but
I<00:04:52.060> showed<00:04:52.960> you<00:04:53.110> earlier<00:04:53.139> all<00:04:53.770> of<00:04:53.979> the<00:04:55.200> you<00:04:56.200> know

00:04:56.219 --> 00:04:56.229 
I showed you earlier all of the you know

00:04:56.229 --> 00:04:58.500 
I showed you earlier all of the you know
the<00:04:56.470> protein<00:04:56.889> skimmer<00:04:57.070> and<00:04:57.490> all<00:04:57.580> the<00:04:57.729> add-ons

00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:58.510 
the protein skimmer and all the add-ons

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:01.320 
the protein skimmer and all the add-ons
that<00:04:58.690> go<00:04:58.900> in<00:04:59.200> the<00:04:59.350> back<00:04:59.850> behind<00:05:00.850> the<00:05:01.150> black

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:01.330 
that go in the back behind the black

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:04.469 
that go in the back behind the black
area<00:05:01.720> of<00:05:01.900> the<00:05:02.050> tank<00:05:02.290> and<00:05:02.919> I<00:05:03.880> got<00:05:04.150> to<00:05:04.270> believe

00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:04.479 
area of the tank and I got to believe

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:08.040 
area of the tank and I got to believe
that<00:05:04.540> it<00:05:04.840> took<00:05:05.050> me<00:05:05.200> all<00:05:05.320> of<00:05:05.350> 45<00:05:06.190> minutes<00:05:06.870> at<00:05:07.870> the

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.050 
that it took me all of 45 minutes at the

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:12.780 
that it took me all of 45 minutes at the
most<00:05:08.080> to<00:05:09.870> to<00:05:10.870> put<00:05:11.080> those<00:05:11.260> all<00:05:11.530> in<00:05:11.790> the

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:12.790 
most to to put those all in the

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:14.990 
most to to put those all in the
instructions<00:05:13.389> were<00:05:13.479> very<00:05:13.720> straightforward

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:15.000 
instructions were very straightforward

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.730 
instructions were very straightforward
everything<00:05:16.000> appears<00:05:16.720> to<00:05:16.810> be<00:05:16.930> working<00:05:17.050> I<00:05:17.530> did

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:17.740 
everything appears to be working I did

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:20.909 
everything appears to be working I did
run<00:05:17.860> the<00:05:17.919> pump<00:05:18.220> for<00:05:18.460> a<00:05:18.490> matter<00:05:19.450> of<00:05:19.570> seconds

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:20.919 
run the pump for a matter of seconds

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:23.610 
run the pump for a matter of seconds
I<00:05:20.950> saw<00:05:21.580> the<00:05:21.639> heater<00:05:21.940> come<00:05:22.240> on<00:05:22.479> and<00:05:23.350> of<00:05:23.410> course

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:23.620 
I saw the heater come on and of course

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:25.650 
I saw the heater come on and of course
turned<00:05:24.010> that<00:05:24.130> off<00:05:24.340> immediately<00:05:24.660> and

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:25.660 
turned that off immediately and

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:28.040 
turned that off immediately and
obviously<00:05:26.289> the<00:05:26.470> lights<00:05:26.680> are<00:05:26.890> working<00:05:27.039> so

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:28.050 
obviously the lights are working so

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:32.670 
obviously the lights are working so
everything<00:05:29.250> looks<00:05:30.250> really<00:05:30.880> good<00:05:31.140> and<00:05:32.140> what<00:05:32.620> a

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:32.680 
everything looks really good and what a

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.409 
everything looks really good and what a
dump<00:05:32.890> couple<00:05:33.520> bags<00:05:33.669> of<00:05:33.850> sand<00:05:34.090> in<00:05:34.300> there

00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:34.419 
dump couple bags of sand in there

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:37.529 
dump couple bags of sand in there
tonight<00:05:34.570> and<00:05:35.310> perhaps<00:05:36.310> some<00:05:36.669> water<00:05:36.940> let<00:05:37.419> it

00:05:37.529 --> 00:05:37.539 
tonight and perhaps some water let it

00:05:37.539 --> 00:05:39.750 
tonight and perhaps some water let it
settle<00:05:37.780> out<00:05:38.020> and<00:05:38.320> start<00:05:39.160> adding<00:05:39.460> some<00:05:39.610> more

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:39.760 
settle out and start adding some more

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:42.240 
settle out and start adding some more
water<00:05:39.970> in<00:05:40.240> the<00:05:40.330> morning<00:05:40.690> and<00:05:41.590> I'll<00:05:41.860> be<00:05:42.039> back

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:42.250

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:44.880 
water in the morning and I'll be back
with<00:05:42.520> you<00:05:42.930> when<00:05:43.930> I<00:05:43.960> get<00:05:44.110> that<00:05:44.380> done

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:44.890 
with you when I get that done

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:47.940 
with you when I get that done
so<00:05:45.460> it's<00:05:46.090> a<00:05:46.270> little<00:05:46.479> late<00:05:46.660> here<00:05:46.960> it's<00:05:47.620> past
