Xperia z2 gaming performance test I've
got<00:00:17.390> quite<00:00:17.540> a<00:00:17.599> few<00:00:17.660> additional<00:00:18.110> games<00:00:18.320> here<00:00:18.560> as

opposed<00:00:18.980> to<00:00:19.099> the<00:00:19.250> standard<00:00:19.430> ones<00:00:19.820> I've<00:00:19.939> been

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:19.970 
opposed to the standard ones I've been

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.210 
opposed to the standard ones I've been
doing<00:00:20.300> but<00:00:21.110> let's<00:00:21.410> start<00:00:21.619> off<00:00:21.710> with<00:00:21.920> this<00:00:22.009> new

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:22.220 
doing but let's start off with this new

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.010 
doing but let's start off with this new
one<00:00:22.369> Godzilla<00:00:22.880> strike<00:00:23.450> zone

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:24.020 
one Godzilla strike zone

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:25.450 
one Godzilla strike zone
now<00:00:24.439> suppose<00:00:24.650> were<00:00:24.800> on<00:00:24.890> the<00:00:24.950> Play<00:00:25.070> Store<00:00:25.340> and<00:00:25.399> I

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:25.460 
now suppose were on the Play Store and I

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:26.409 
now suppose were on the Play Store and I
was<00:00:25.550> very<00:00:25.640> very<00:00:25.820> interested<00:00:26.239> in<00:00:26.329> actually

00:00:26.409 --> 00:00:26.419 
was very very interested in actually

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:28.060 
was very very interested in actually
checking<00:00:26.750> it<00:00:26.930> out<00:00:27.050> and<00:00:27.259> there's<00:00:27.710> three<00:00:27.890> stages

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:28.070 
checking it out and there's three stages

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:29.440 
checking it out and there's three stages
as<00:00:28.369> you<00:00:28.460> can<00:00:28.579> see<00:00:28.790> and<00:00:29.000> we're<00:00:29.090> gonna<00:00:29.210> start

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:29.450 
as you can see and we're gonna start

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:32.440 
as you can see and we're gonna start
with<00:00:29.599> halo<00:00:30.020> jump<00:00:30.349> now<00:00:31.279> this<00:00:31.489> replicates<00:00:32.300> the

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:32.450 
with halo jump now this replicates the

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:34.750 
with halo jump now this replicates the
exact<00:00:32.809> same<00:00:33.079> part<00:00:33.649> of<00:00:33.770> the<00:00:33.920> movie<00:00:34.280> and<00:00:34.430> I<00:00:34.610> think

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:34.760 
exact same part of the movie and I think

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:35.979 
exact same part of the movie and I think
it<00:00:34.850> does<00:00:34.940> it<00:00:35.059> very<00:00:35.239> very<00:00:35.390> well<00:00:35.600> the<00:00:35.809> graphics

00:00:35.979 --> 00:00:35.989 
it does it very very well the graphics

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:38.170 
it does it very very well the graphics
camera<00:00:36.530> angle<00:00:36.829> eerie<00:00:37.070> tone<00:00:37.520> and<00:00:37.730> music<00:00:38.059> is

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:38.180 
camera angle eerie tone and music is

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:45.040 
camera angle eerie tone and music is
really<00:00:38.600> accurate<00:00:38.809> to<00:00:39.170> the<00:00:39.200> movie<00:00:43.750> the<00:00:44.750> movie<00:00:44.990> I

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.050 
really accurate to the movie the movie I

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:46.360 
really accurate to the movie the movie I
did<00:00:45.170> not<00:00:45.260> like<00:00:45.410> by<00:00:45.560> the<00:00:45.620> way<00:00:45.800> and<00:00:45.980> I've<00:00:46.040> got<00:00:46.160> a<00:00:46.190> 5

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:49.400 
video description now basically with

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:50.500 
video description now basically with
this<00:00:49.490> egg<00:00:49.700> app<00:00:49.850> to<00:00:50.030> make<00:00:50.120> sure<00:00:50.300> you<00:00:50.390> do<00:00:50.480> not

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
this egg app to make sure you do not

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.450 
this egg app to make sure you do not
bump<00:00:50.930> into<00:00:51.080> your<00:00:51.350> teammates<00:00:51.890> whilst<00:00:52.190> you're

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.460 
bump into your teammates whilst you're

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.700 
bump into your teammates whilst you're
dropping<00:00:52.760> down<00:00:52.790> at<00:00:53.120> the<00:00:53.240> altitude<00:00:53.930> and<00:00:54.620> I

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:54.710 
dropping down at the altitude and I

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:55.750 
dropping down at the altitude and I
figured<00:00:54.950> actually<00:00:55.160> just<00:00:55.280> a<00:00:55.370> to<00:00:55.430> the<00:00:55.520> bottom

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
figured actually just a to the bottom

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:56.800 
figured actually just a to the bottom
right<00:00:55.880> hand<00:00:55.970> corner<00:00:56.060> you're<00:00:56.480> not<00:00:56.600> going<00:00:56.750> to

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:56.810 
right hand corner you're not going to

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:57.910 
right hand corner you're not going to
get<00:00:56.900> hit<00:00:57.020> at<00:00:57.110> all<00:00:57.200> by<00:00:57.320> your<00:00:57.470> teammates<00:00:57.740> and

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920 
get hit at all by your teammates and

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.170 
get hit at all by your teammates and
then<00:00:58.040> it's<00:00:58.130> just<00:00:58.190> a<00:00:58.310> waiting<00:00:58.460> game<00:00:58.640> for<00:00:59.090> the

00:00:59.170 --> 00:00:59.180 
then it's just a waiting game for the

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:04.240 
then it's just a waiting game for the
altitude<00:00:59.510> to<00:01:00.200> drop<00:01:00.440> down<00:01:00.650> to<00:01:00.829> zero<00:01:01.250> and<00:01:03.250> when

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
altitude to drop down to zero and when

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:05.830 
altitude to drop down to zero and when
it<00:01:04.339> does<00:01:04.460> drop<00:01:04.610> down<00:01:04.759> you<00:01:04.850> know<00:01:04.909> in<00:01:05.150> for<00:01:05.360> a<00:01:05.420> real

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:05.840 
it does drop down you know in for a real

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.300 
it does drop down you know in for a real
treat<00:01:05.869> in<00:01:06.259> terms<00:01:06.470> of<00:01:06.590> graphics<00:01:06.920> just<00:01:07.009> look<00:01:07.220> at

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310 
treat in terms of graphics just look at

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:19.850 
treat in terms of graphics just look at
this

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.050 

that<00:01:20.860> was<00:01:21.280> awesome

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060 
that was awesome

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.630 
that was awesome
now<00:01:22.990> the<00:01:23.049> game<00:01:23.320> turns<00:01:23.680> out<00:01:23.860> less<00:01:24.070> awesome<00:01:24.490> from

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 
now the game turns out less awesome from

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.550 
now the game turns out less awesome from
this<00:01:24.820> point<00:01:25.060> on<00:01:25.240> in<00:01:25.479> fact<00:01:25.900> it<00:01:26.020> turns<00:01:26.229> into<00:01:26.440> a

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560 
this point on in fact it turns into a

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.130 
this point on in fact it turns into a
glitch<00:01:26.920> zone<00:01:27.299> it<00:01:28.299> is<00:01:28.330> hard<00:01:28.630> to<00:01:28.720> do<00:01:28.840> something

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.140 
glitch zone it is hard to do something

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:30.840 
glitch zone it is hard to do something
for<00:01:29.259> other<00:01:29.350> cameras<00:01:29.860> especially<00:01:30.159> all<00:01:30.700> you

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:30.850 
for other cameras especially all you

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:31.920 
for other cameras especially all you
could<00:01:31.000> actually<00:01:31.299> have<00:01:31.509> to<00:01:31.570> do<00:01:31.690> here<00:01:31.869> is

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:31.930 
could actually have to do here is

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:34.560 
could actually have to do here is
maneuver<00:01:32.320> your<00:01:32.440> way<00:01:32.979> down<00:01:33.369> to<00:01:33.729> the<00:01:34.030> ground<00:01:34.300> or

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.570 
maneuver your way down to the ground or

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:36.540 
maneuver your way down to the ground or
something<00:01:35.020> I<00:01:35.170> have<00:01:35.619> never<00:01:35.950> managed<00:01:36.250> to<00:01:36.280> do<00:01:36.460> it

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:36.550 
something I have never managed to do it

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:37.920 
something I have never managed to do it
because<00:01:36.759> this<00:01:36.820> is<00:01:36.970> full<00:01:37.180> of<00:01:37.330> glitches<00:01:37.570> there

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:37.930 
because this is full of glitches there

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.380 
because this is full of glitches there
