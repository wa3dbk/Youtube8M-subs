00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.400
 hello ponytail and this will add 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.930
 us a stone through which you can 

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:10.170
 teleport the same fireplaces were i 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:13.530
 I don't seem to remember the secret room and in 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:16.490
 hawker stones harry potter harry 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:19.020
 potter and philosopher's stone 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:21.060
 to make such to her to us 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.840
 you will need a brick more 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:28.680
 Nothing necessarily lighter now 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:33.149
 take and build just such a scheme 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.180
 we do like this we do like this 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:38.950
 here 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:42.910
 so here so here and here 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:46.450
 so here it is so here it is removed 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:51.490
 Means to successfully make the fireplace namaz 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:56.320
 make a plan a torch and then attach 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:59.590
 sign and write any then 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:03.100
 ignite it all and throw there well what 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:05.140
 use the magic dust of the whole movie 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:10.380
 we can go and teleport where 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:14.410
 again we want to craft from themselves 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:18.490
 ingredients dropped to 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:19.630
 And this magic dust she is crafting with us 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:24.430
 from pearl 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:27.910
 endor and 1 1 gunpowder and we will 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:31.800
 how many 1 I would personally like three at once 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:34.570
 dust well profitable take on 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:37.360
 magic then clothe tablets tablets 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:41.440
 like with she from the usual nameplate and 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.220
 out of the magic dust and it will come out 1 a 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.130
 crafting 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.929
 but such a torch is now something to him 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.850
 everything 

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:49.630
 drank it looks like this he is so vision as 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.020
 ordinary torch 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:02:00.789
 shines probably also create let's see 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:02:04.179
 didn't check the light yes he even also even 

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:10.170
 we fly the evidence because it is invented better 

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:10.170
 than the torch is now comparable in person 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:19.670
 In principle, there are no differences 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:23.870
 further the torch itself is crafted also 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:25.820
 um and the magic dust from the wand will come out 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:30.770
 at once it is four that is like a 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:32.660
 craft ordinary yes ordinary torch only 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:35.180
 there are places of magic dust we need 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:37.520
 instead of coal we will need a magic 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:42.970
 I have exhausted the dust here and 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:42.970
 with you there was a tail all good luck to all bye
