00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.349
 September 20 was a very date 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.160
 important for the online poker world 

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:13.170
 gdpoker in fact had just announced 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.120
 the division of its liquidity at least 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.760
 in the cash tables they give 30 limits up to 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.949
 100 and over the limit hundred what 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.750
 the members of the then thought 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.949
 pro team of the skins and also of gd 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.949
 let's go there feel 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.050
 look I play the 4 100 bio and for me 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.940
 there has not been much difference because 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.010
 for the 400 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.800
 we say and most of the traffic 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.640
 and dg then there was no for me 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.890
 much difference 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.489
 now I must say that the seventeenth century has fallen 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.770
 in a thousand almost dead, but I realize that with the 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.620
 things aside we can 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:52.829
 they can change for the better and above all 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:55.160
 12 months of adjustment are needed 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.690
 be able to see what they will do like 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:01.739
 the others will answer as a triune 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:04.650
 operators c'Ã¨ 0 action that is 1 2 reg 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.780
 who are jumping heads up not 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.540
 they play against other regs against me 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.939
 do not play against do not play then 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.580
 it is a total deadlock 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:17.159
 Well you can't play the situation anymore 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.409
 to be honest it is a bit nasty because 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:22.619
 a lot of tables have been closed 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.540
 been made private by gd and therefore me that 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.820
 grindo on the platform I know that i 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.329
 jewelry that always runs was a game a 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:34.070
 free but with all the people on the site 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:35.870
 only 400 and 200 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.510
 the game obviously in the other levels 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:40.370
 it has dropped a lot almost to say 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:42.830
 the truth no longer exists 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:46.550
 we did not feel a significant drop 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:51.020
 even in the numbers that I passed on 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:53.000
 poker manager for now you sure travel is 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.640
 a nice assist at pokerstars that maybe 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.100
 in short, he didn't need it 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:01.130
 happy their movement is more or less 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.540
 I have to say the same for a short time 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:06.080
 period of tables were enough 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:09.709
 softer then actually for us dg 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:12.350
 better so he spoke about it 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:14.510
 and for a while the 200 I don't know if even two 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:16.940
 now we would not pay game sa 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.350
 still the 200 and 400 which are the limits 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.970
 which anyway I'm playing more are 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:23.510
 remained intact so it has not changed 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:25.310
 nothing I'm mixing even 100 and them 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.470
 a little bit has changed a little softer 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:31.420
 however from a gd point of view it has not 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.420
 the situation hasn't changed much 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.519
 I honestly don't know what he can do in the future 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.799
 but from what I understood it is 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:42.500
 been made to this gaming formula 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:44.600
 digital because it must then be combined with 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.780
 partypoker and therefore wants to keep the 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:50.209
 own players on their backs 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.570
 in short, they really do well not 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:54.709
 does everything good on the ongame movement 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:58.400
 I think everyone is talking to 

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:59.090
 everyone and something will eventually move 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.120
 of the year 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:05.980
 surely but look at the voices I have 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:07.820
 they are rumors and they say 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:11.580
 the beginning of 2013 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:13.950
 then it is not known these things are 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:16.860
 the situation of the future is not exactly the case 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:19.200
 I can tell you the truth because i know 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:22.250
 their managers know it in short 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:25.470
 management and in any case they told me that 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:26.700
 this will be resolved soon 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.580
 I don't know exactly what it means 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.980
 I believe that of the other skins it is 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:35.330
 they will attack a game and I do n't think that 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.330
 we will change ourselves from a game
