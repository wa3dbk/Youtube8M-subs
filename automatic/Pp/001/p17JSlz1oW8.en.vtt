00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.450
 porn 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:52.970
 let's talk about which layer 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:55.050
 though such stick future back 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:57.890
 hunt come into the soul no meat 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:01.730

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:04.690
 very powerful machines losing and your 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.690
 teams will remain 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:15.520
 are you technicians if time is worth so you 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.520
 of course you can h 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:23.220
 Well, not in general, the essence of all this reception 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:27.460
 just search but 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.380
 switches in most counterattack 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:33.580
 case number new test 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:36.460
 and we see sit down as our answer workers 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:39.310
 a little bit better than the lift angle our guns 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:41.890
 push back i mean he blame everything and 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:44.380
 slow enough when you have time I 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.930
 heard shoes a big angle about these 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:50.110
 very forward and store the gun back but not 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:52.380
 answer the hill no more so that was 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:55.840
 so far right there and because when 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:58.150
 the helicopter will reach a high angle above you 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.810
 he's low enough down so you 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:03.310
 could kill 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.770
 I myself will be pleasant 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:09.670
 best to aging speak and 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:12.090
 how does the helicopter get out is in 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:14.810
 this sense is very disadvantaged 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:18.709
 very low height 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:21.080
 enough of throws airplanes grade 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:23.209
 much harder of the many drives rays 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.599
 only non- skill pilots who 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:26.569
 are flying 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:29.440
 at a small angle on you and not the same 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:32.440
 enter the maneuver at low speed 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.440
 enough 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:38.190
 Well , on this I think we finish 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:41.280
 be smarter 4 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:43.770
 play on the opponent's mistakes and also not 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.070
 forget to raise your personal skill 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:48.150
 which is also very standard give 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:51.530
