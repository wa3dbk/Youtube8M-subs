00:02:17.619 --> 00:02:17.629 
and the way that this locks on I don't

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:20.110 
and the way that this locks on I don't
want<00:02:17.829> you<00:02:18.829> could<00:02:18.950> only<00:02:19.370> you<00:02:19.670> can't<00:02:19.849> really<00:02:20.000> see

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
that but you can see right here so you

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:23.589 
that but you can see right here so you
like<00:02:22.609> it<00:02:22.640> works<00:02:22.819> like<00:02:22.939> a<00:02:23.000> little<00:02:23.329> miniature

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:23.599
