00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.560
 hi it's marco dr von today 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.330
 small unpacking video of zouk pau 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.160
 gold collar it's a bad that you 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.230
 will find soon in video of 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.580
 test so a mobile that was provided to me 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.349
 directly by the mark I want to 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.759
 thank zoppo so who play the game 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.320
 so we'll see what happens when 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.369
 test it's not the first time I 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.869
 tests the mobiles of the tax mark 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.710
 so until now it's been 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.050
 always went well because the 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.670
 mobile and has good relationships 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.170
 price specifications so we'll see this 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.300
 that it is precisely with the color 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.070
 that's one of the last borns of the 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.570
 Chinese constructor a builder 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.800
 Chinese who is very angry we see 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.899
 especially since they really have 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.260
 ambitions for commercialization in 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.180
 Europe 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.890
 we had found them already on the show 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.530
 mwc in barcelona in 2015 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.730
 they are still at the salon of the medpi which is 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.260
 Holds in Monaco in 2015 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.430
 so we feel that the brand has 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.140
 really want to go to 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.460
 the international and especially more 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.230
 especially in europe 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.489
 probably more in europe as 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.020
 United States by the way since we 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.820
 inevitably found on the salons 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.890
 European and less still on 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.969
 American salons so the phone I 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.379
 wanted to say I'm already in the process of 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.780
 test 

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:02.489
 well here we have the pink version 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.260
 it exists in full of colors there is 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.299
 return when testing colors 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.180
 original just very girly very 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.380
 feminine necessarily also but it's 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.600
 not a problem that will not stop me 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.520
 just to test it I 'm going to the side 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.540
 I will come back during the test I would say 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.770
 my feeling so I want to give my 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.540
 feeling during the test for the moment there 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.680
 is still a little too early then the 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.210
 phone it is packed in this 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.159
 very original little box at the 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.689
 packaging also on the front of the 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.189
 box we find the branding pot 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.810
 it is the mark then stopped 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.490
 model we find a whole lot of specs 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.720
 and that's what's interesting 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.970
 will learn especially that the phone is 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.189
 at 4g lte and e then we talk about the test 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.960
 precisely from this collection we will speak 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.369
 covered frequencies we learn that 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.220
 it's a target duel that it has a 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:43.920
 4.5-inch screen with a resolution 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:45.060
 ffw vga 1 gig of ram 8 gigas of rome 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.220
 we will see how truly remain 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.880
 space available during the first 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.439
 1.1 android startup and yes it's fine 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.689
 with android 5 for 1 it is already 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:57.240
 day a battery of 1700 thousands in 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:59.219
 eur pair a priori it may be a 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.450
 little light we have on the left side of the 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.540
 box all the colors 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.520
 include gray white white rose 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.799
 of the game's white blue 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.509
 white and black see that these are the 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.560
 different declinations good on the side 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:10.819
 of the case not much more to 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.590
 say 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:15.900
 in the back a little reminder the specs 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.129
 especially that we learn that we learn 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.989
 therefore by the operating system and 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:20.400
 on lying with an overlay that 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:21.840
 called opposing the rail 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.840
 we also learn that the resolution 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.340
 that I gave you as being the w 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.799
 the aef wta is actually a resolution 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.330
 but it's confirmed so 854 pixels 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:31.860
 by 480 pixels 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.400
 we know clearly from the entry level 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.720
 it is also on a procession mt 67 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.489
 35 4 hearts it's a processor 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.599
 media 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:41.190
 what more can this photo sensor 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:42.870
 frontal 2 megapixel dorsal 5 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.269
 megapixels I remember it's from 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.220
 the entry-level micro sd up to 64th 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:48.630
 max of additional memory and 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.860
 proximity light sensor 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:53.130
 accelerometer etc 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.360
 So it is a good 10 th entry phone 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.860
 did you understand that I repeat myself 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.060
 this is the third time then the earth 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.290
 of the questions voice is the 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.819
 phone itself on a cradle 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.290
 that you imagine 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:03.599
 gold the phone well packed action that 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:04.530
 is protective and that's the cradle when 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:07.110
 we rent what is found at 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:10.290
 below the documentation guide 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:12.569
 multilingual quick start goodguide 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.380
 quick start guide with an accent 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:16.920
 missing a 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:18.359
 that's it jumped here but hey that's it 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.400
 the merit of being there is for you 

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:21.480
 learn to open the phone to know 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.350
 place it correctly against your 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.340
 ear because they tell you where 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:26.069
 found the earpiece cool 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.959
 etc etc well we also find a 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:31.889
 warranty guide warranty card 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:32.850
 here is to have a little in English that you 

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:34.250
 will learn how to use your 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:36.510
 guarantee 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:38.760
 go the brand seems to want to do the 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.470
 things correctly we find in the 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.500
 box a pedestrian kit then for the shot 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.579
 it's the very classic earphone 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.889
 raw plastic 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:48.810
 so that's the diam's entry and even the 

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:50.010
 very cheap we find a usb cable 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.630
 micro usb 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.620
 nothing significant to say about it is 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:54.840
 what you will need to synchronize 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:57.680
 the phone also recharge it via 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:01.109
 precisely the AC adapter here 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:02.549
 europe format so France format the most 

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:05.459
 classic of the world with a connector 

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:07.079
 usb for m the cable itself with the 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:09.599
 opposite marking that proves it's not 

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:11.280
 from the discounted AC adapter a 

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:13.530
 bought by the tonne on the markets 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.850
 Chinese is even a little here is a 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.840
 small marking which proves that the 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:17.970
 she has 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.320
 the sun this detail it's worth nothing at all 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:22.199
 a mark like that is worth a penny 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:23.460
 to do but well ben that's it proves that 

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:24.210
 the brand she wants to do the 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.370
 things correctly 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.389
 I think it's positive so here 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:30.000
 reminder of what is found in the 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:32.430
 box at the apd is an area that pedestrians 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.449
 very cheap anyway very very cheap 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:35.400
 there is not even need to test it 

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:38.850
 to find out we also find a 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:40.050
 usb micro usb cable douala doc 1 in want
