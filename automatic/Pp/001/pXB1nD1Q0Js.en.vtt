now the first thing I want to show you

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.890 
now the first thing I want to show you
is<00:00:25.800> just<00:00:26.010> how<00:00:26.160> blazingly<00:00:26.849> fast<00:00:27.000> this<00:00:27.480> ROM<00:00:27.750> is

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
is just how blazingly fast this ROM is

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.060 
is just how blazingly fast this ROM is
I'm<00:00:28.050> just<00:00:28.199> going<00:00:28.349> to<00:00:28.380> jump<00:00:28.590> into<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:28.859> app

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
I'm just going to jump into the app

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.339 
I'm just going to jump into the app
drawer<00:00:29.250> here<00:00:29.519> and<00:00:29.699> speed<00:00:30.660> through<00:00:30.929> these<00:00:31.109> apps

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
drawer here and speed through these apps

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.080 
drawer here and speed through these apps
as<00:00:31.560> fast<00:00:31.800> as<00:00:31.949> I<00:00:32.009> can<00:00:32.070> you'll<00:00:32.430> just<00:00:32.700> see<00:00:32.880> there

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
as fast as I can you'll just see there

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.330 
as fast as I can you'll just see there
is<00:00:33.210> no<00:00:33.450> lag<00:00:33.719> whatsoever<00:00:33.960> it<00:00:34.469> is<00:00:34.590> very<00:00:34.980> very

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
is no lag whatsoever it is very very

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.880 
is no lag whatsoever it is very very
quick<00:00:35.640> and<00:00:35.850> very<00:00:35.880> very<00:00:36.510> fast<00:00:36.870> and<00:00:37.559> I<00:00:37.649> guess

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
quick and very very fast and I guess

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.920 
quick and very very fast and I guess
that's<00:00:38.100> down<00:00:38.309> to<00:00:38.340> llanera<00:00:38.820> optimizations<00:00:39.690> and

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
that's down to llanera optimizations and

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.139 
that's down to llanera optimizations and
the<00:00:40.200> purity<00:00:40.559> kernel<00:00:40.920> so<00:00:41.040> that's<00:00:41.190> pretty<00:00:41.640> cool

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
the purity kernel so that's pretty cool

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.229 
the purity kernel so that's pretty cool
in<00:00:42.329> terms<00:00:42.809> of<00:00:42.930> customization<00:00:43.739> this<00:00:44.670> isn't<00:00:45.090> a

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
in terms of customization this isn't a

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
customization it has a few bits in
