00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:51.640 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.630 

we<00:00:51.970> took<00:00:52.240> a<00:00:52.300> unique<00:00:52.660> approach<00:00:53.080> on<00:00:53.440> our

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
we took a unique approach on our

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.620 
we took a unique approach on our
engineering<00:00:54.640> and<00:00:54.850> design<00:00:55.120> to<00:00:55.270> this<00:00:55.360> product

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:55.630 
engineering and design to this product

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:58.250 
engineering and design to this product
so<00:00:55.990> it<00:00:56.110> started<00:00:56.440> with<00:00:56.500> a<00:00:56.650> global<00:00:57.040> team<00:00:57.190> those

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
so it started with a global team those

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.390 
so it started with a global team those
engineers<00:00:59.260> from<00:00:59.410> around<00:00:59.560> the<00:00:59.800> world<00:00:59.920> working

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:00.400 
engineers from around the world working

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.030 
engineers from around the world working
on<00:01:00.520> this<00:01:00.730> and<00:01:00.940> their<00:01:01.510> task<00:01:01.810> was<00:01:02.260> to<00:01:02.410> design<00:01:02.560> an

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:03.040 
on this and their task was to design an

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:05.700 
on this and their task was to design an
engine<00:01:03.400> a<00:01:03.550> world<00:01:04.300> engine<00:01:04.720> that<00:01:05.260> could<00:01:05.500> meet

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:05.710 
engine a world engine that could meet

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.800 
engine a world engine that could meet
emission<00:01:06.460> standards<00:01:06.970> varying<00:01:07.480> emission

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:07.810 
emission standards varying emission

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:09.360 
emission standards varying emission
standards<00:01:08.320> and<00:01:08.560> different<00:01:08.650> requirements

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:09.370 
standards and different requirements

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:11.700 
standards and different requirements
around<00:01:09.460> the<00:01:09.729> world<00:01:09.910> and<00:01:10.270> so<00:01:11.020> as<00:01:11.290> part<00:01:11.470> of<00:01:11.590> this

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:11.710 
around the world and so as part of this

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:13.320 
around the world and so as part of this
approach<00:01:12.040> we<00:01:12.280> started<00:01:12.729> with<00:01:12.880> a<00:01:12.910> clean<00:01:13.150> sheet

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:13.330 
approach we started with a clean sheet

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.719 
approach we started with a clean sheet
of<00:01:13.390> paper<00:01:13.510> and<00:01:13.960> so<00:01:14.620> no<00:01:14.860> constraints<00:01:15.460> on<00:01:15.610> the

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:15.729 
of paper and so no constraints on the

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:17.610 
of paper and so no constraints on the
design<00:01:16.060> what<00:01:16.450> do<00:01:16.510> we<00:01:16.600> need<00:01:16.750> to<00:01:16.870> do<00:01:17.020> to<00:01:17.260> design

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:17.620 
design what do we need to do to design

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:21.390 
design what do we need to do to design
that<00:01:17.800> engine<00:01:18.479> and<00:01:19.479> of<00:01:19.810> course<00:01:20.020> we<00:01:20.200> drew<00:01:21.070> on<00:01:21.250> our

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:21.400 
that engine and of course we drew on our

that engine and of course we drew on our
