00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:47.530 
had the same problem with it's a little

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:50.160 
had the same problem with it's a little
bit<00:06:47.650> short<00:06:47.950> um<00:06:48.220> once<00:06:49.030> again<00:06:49.180> a<00:06:49.270> one<00:06:49.570> size<00:06:50.140> fits

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:50.170 
bit short um once again a one size fits

00:06:50.170 --> 00:06:52.170 
bit short um once again a one size fits
all<00:06:50.620> kind<00:06:50.920> of<00:06:50.980> deal<00:06:51.160> but<00:06:51.640> instead<00:06:51.850> it<00:06:51.970> fit<00:06:52.150> like

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:52.180 
all kind of deal but instead it fit like

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:55.800 
all kind of deal but instead it fit like
small<00:06:53.140> and<00:06:53.410> medium<00:06:53.770> so<00:06:54.460> I<00:06:55.090> figured<00:06:55.600> it<00:06:55.720> would

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:55.810 
small and medium so I figured it would

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:57.120 
small and medium so I figured it would
be<00:06:55.870> like<00:06:55.990> a<00:06:56.050> little<00:06:56.380> bit<00:06:56.530> like<00:06:56.740> it<00:06:56.890> would<00:06:57.100> work

be like a little bit like it would work

00:06:57.130 --> 00:06:58.980 
be like a little bit like it would work
like<00:06:57.700> it<00:06:57.820> would<00:06:57.910> be<00:06:57.940> good<00:06:58.180> but<00:06:58.660> this<00:06:58.780> is<00:06:58.930> very
