so<00:00:33.399> when<00:00:33.520> we<00:00:33.640> think<00:00:33.790> of<00:00:33.940> penguins<00:00:34.360> we<00:00:34.690> think<00:00:34.899> of

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:35.050 
so when we think of penguins we think of

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.610 
so when we think of penguins we think of
cold<00:00:35.350> snow<00:00:36.040> and<00:00:36.399> the<00:00:36.579> South<00:00:36.790> Pole<00:00:37.120> in<00:00:37.620> fact

cold snow and the South Pole in fact
there<00:00:39.190> are<00:00:39.309> no<00:00:39.399> penguins<00:00:39.879> at<00:00:40.030> the<00:00:40.059> South<00:00:40.329> Pole

there are no penguins at the South Pole

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.540 
there are no penguins at the South Pole
and<00:00:40.899> most<00:00:41.410> penguins<00:00:41.620> never<00:00:42.040> venture<00:00:42.430> to
