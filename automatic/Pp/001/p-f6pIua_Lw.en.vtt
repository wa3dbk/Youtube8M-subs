00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:52.770 
if I had a beer and I've been dreaming
about<00:04:51.590> a<00:04:51.770> book<00:04:52.010> for<00:04:52.160> a<00:04:52.250> really<00:04:52.520> long<00:04:52.550> time

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:52.780 
about a book for a really long time

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:56.230 
about a book for a really long time
because<00:04:53.780> I<00:04:54.080> always<00:04:54.410> say<00:04:54.790> we<00:04:55.790> can't<00:04:56.090> be

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.240 
because I always say we can't be

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.300 
because I always say we can't be
burdened<00:04:56.660> down<00:04:56.750> with<00:04:56.810> work<00:04:57.200> we<00:04:57.860> can't<00:04:58.130> be

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:58.310 
burdened down with work we can't be

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:01.270

stressed out working 15 hours a day so

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.790 
stressed out working 15 hours a day so
one<00:05:01.820> of<00:05:01.880> the<00:05:02.120> big<00:05:02.150> important<00:05:02.900> health<00:05:03.140> aspects

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:03.800 
one of the big important health aspects

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:07.420 
one of the big important health aspects
is<00:05:04.000> to<00:05:05.000> not<00:05:05.270> overwork<00:05:05.960> another<00:05:06.890> one<00:05:07.100> is<00:05:07.130> we

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:09.680 
have to be fooled with our food people

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:12.490 
have to be fooled with our food people
simply<00:05:10.040> overeat<00:05:10.610> day<00:05:10.850> too<00:05:10.910> much<00:05:11.500> another

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:12.500 
simply overeat day too much another

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:14.530 
simply overeat day too much another
thing<00:05:12.770> is<00:05:12.919> people<00:05:13.190> made<00:05:14.060> when<00:05:14.270> they<00:05:14.360> sleep

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:14.540 
thing is people made when they sleep

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:16.990 
thing is people made when they sleep
inside<00:05:15.020> to<00:05:15.260> have<00:05:15.440> their<00:05:15.620> windows<00:05:15.830> closed<00:05:16.430> they

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:17.000 
inside to have their windows closed they

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.460 
inside to have their windows closed they
don't<00:05:17.210> get<00:05:17.330> any<00:05:17.480> fresh<00:05:17.750> air<00:05:17.960> I<00:05:17.990> talked<00:05:18.440> about

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:23.390 
not being confined to four walls so

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:25.210 
not being confined to four walls so
there's<00:05:23.630> so<00:05:23.810> many<00:05:23.930> things<00:05:24.050> out<00:05:24.440> there<00:05:24.500> another

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:25.220 
there's so many things out there another

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:27.430 
there's so many things out there another
one<00:05:25.490> is<00:05:25.669> I<00:05:25.850> believe<00:05:25.910> walking<00:05:26.660> is<00:05:26.810> so<00:05:26.960> important

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:27.440 
one is I believe walking is so important

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:29.469 
one is I believe walking is so important
and<00:05:27.500> getting<00:05:27.800> good<00:05:27.919> exercise<00:05:28.370> all<00:05:29.000> of<00:05:29.300> these

00:05:29.469 --> 00:05:29.479 
and getting good exercise all of these

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:31.659 
and getting good exercise all of these
things<00:05:29.510> are<00:05:30.140> important<00:05:30.919> for<00:05:31.010> good<00:05:31.190> health<00:05:31.250> and

00:05:31.659 --> 00:05:31.669 
things are important for good health and

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:33.909 
things are important for good health and
what<00:05:32.419> is<00:05:32.540> all<00:05:32.690> this<00:05:32.810> leading<00:05:32.870> up<00:05:33.229> to<00:05:33.440> it's

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:33.919 
what is all this leading up to it's

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:36.040 
what is all this leading up to it's
probably<00:05:34.220> leading<00:05:34.700> up<00:05:34.880> to<00:05:35.000> my<00:05:35.120> new<00:05:35.300> book<00:05:35.540> which

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:36.050 
probably leading up to my new book which

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:39.730 
probably leading up to my new book which
I<00:05:36.229> should<00:05:36.650> call<00:05:36.880> the<00:05:37.880> homeless<00:05:38.360> diet<00:05:38.740> because
