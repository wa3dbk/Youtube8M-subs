00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
work has been taught with the clicker

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.790 
work has been taught with the clicker
we<00:00:38.910> began<00:00:39.300> with<00:00:39.660> her<00:00:39.809> training<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.500> way<00:00:40.620> we

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
we began with her training the way we

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.299 
we began with her training the way we
begin<00:00:41.219> with<00:00:41.460> all<00:00:42.270> horses<00:00:42.750> we<00:00:43.410> taught<00:00:43.680> her<00:00:43.980> to

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
begin with all horses we taught her to

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.549 
begin with all horses we taught her to
touch<00:00:44.550> targets<00:00:46.489> this<00:00:47.489> is<00:00:47.670> her<00:00:47.850> very<00:00:48.000> first<00:00:48.559> day

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
touch targets this is her very first day

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.709 
touch targets this is her very first day
in<00:00:49.800> training<00:00:50.100> and<00:00:50.789> we're<00:00:50.940> just<00:00:51.059> using<00:00:51.360> this

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
in training and we're just using this

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.430 
in training and we're just using this
foam<00:00:51.989> pool<00:00:52.350> little<00:00:52.860> noodle<00:00:53.730> to<00:00:54.230> get<00:00:55.230> her

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
foam pool little noodle to get her

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.889 
foam pool little noodle to get her
introduced<00:00:56.039> to<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.610> concept<00:00:57.149> of<00:00:57.329> clicker

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
introduced to the concept of clicker

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.650 
introduced to the concept of clicker
training<00:00:58.109> her<00:00:59.100> training<00:00:59.550> began<00:00:59.910> unlike<00:01:00.270> most

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
training her training began unlike most

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.360 
training her training began unlike most
other<00:01:00.930> horses<00:01:01.410> but<00:01:01.649> then<00:01:01.800> it<00:01:01.949> took<00:01:02.160> some

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
other horses but then it took some

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.899 
other horses but then it took some
interesting<00:01:04.040> twists<00:01:05.040> and<00:01:05.220> turns<00:01:05.430> so<00:01:05.880> we

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
interesting twists and turns so we

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.609 
interesting twists and turns so we
taught<00:01:06.330> her<00:01:06.540> some<00:01:06.900> things<00:01:07.110> we<00:01:07.409> wouldn't

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
taught her some things we wouldn't

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.390 
taught her some things we wouldn't
normally<00:01:08.010> be<00:01:08.340> teaching<00:01:08.909> such<00:01:09.210> as<00:01:10.070> getting<00:01:11.070> in

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
normally be teaching such as getting in

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.700 
normally be teaching such as getting in
a<00:01:11.490> car<00:01:11.700> so<00:01:12.330> actually<00:01:12.720> this<00:01:12.869> is<00:01:12.930> trailer

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710

really trying to get in this car it's

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.649 
really trying to get in this car it's
just<00:01:19.470> she<00:01:19.619> doesn't<00:01:19.860> know<00:01:20.130> how<00:01:20.369> and<00:01:20.759> what<00:01:21.479> I'm

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
get a big jackpot for that we also

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.920 
get a big jackpot for that we also
taught<00:01:36.570> her<00:01:36.750> to<00:01:37.229> go<00:01:37.350> up<00:01:37.590> and<00:01:37.860> down<00:01:38.009> stairs<00:01:38.520> and

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:38.930 
taught her to go up and down stairs and

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.920 
taught her to go up and down stairs and
here<00:01:39.930> she's<00:01:40.229> doing<00:01:40.619> some<00:01:41.220> of<00:01:41.369> her<00:01:41.490> early<00:01:42.030> lead

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
here she's doing some of her early lead

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.389 
here she's doing some of her early lead
work<00:01:43.229> and<00:01:43.970> I'm<00:01:44.970> teaching<00:01:45.899> her<00:01:46.320> to<00:01:46.860> stop<00:01:47.159> it

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
work and I'm teaching her to stop it

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.270 
work and I'm teaching her to stop it
curbs<00:01:47.759> so<00:01:48.360> every<00:01:48.869> time<00:01:49.110> we<00:01:49.380> get<00:01:49.590> to<00:01:49.890> a<00:01:49.920> curb

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
curbs so every time we get to a curb

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.270 
curbs so every time we get to a curb
crossing<00:01:50.880> at<00:01:51.720> this<00:01:51.930> juncture<00:01:52.350> I<00:01:52.649> would<00:01:52.950> stop

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
crossing at this juncture I would stop

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.730 
crossing at this juncture I would stop
her<00:01:53.490> and<00:01:53.729> click<00:01:54.060> and<00:01:54.329> then<00:01:54.810> give<00:01:55.079> her<00:01:55.320> a<00:01:55.350> treat

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
her and click and then give her a treat

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.030 
her and click and then give her a treat
so<00:01:56.040> that<00:01:56.189> she<00:01:56.460> began<00:01:56.790> to<00:01:57.000> associate<00:01:58.040> curbs

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
so that she began to associate curbs

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.069 
so that she began to associate curbs
with<00:01:59.280> a<00:01:59.310> place<00:01:59.640> to<00:01:59.670> stop<00:02:00.210> and<00:02:00.509> also<00:02:00.810> a<00:02:00.840> place

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
with a place to stop and also a place

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.639 
with a place to stop and also a place
where<00:02:01.350> she<00:02:01.560> got<00:02:01.710> reinforced<00:02:03.170> the<00:02:04.170> key<00:02:04.469> to

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
where she got reinforced the key to

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.830 
where she got reinforced the key to
guide<00:02:04.860> training<00:02:05.189> is<00:02:05.600> really<00:02:06.600> being

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
guide training is really being

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.900 
guide training is really being
consistent<00:02:07.560> and<00:02:07.619> if<00:02:07.770> we<00:02:07.890> took<00:02:08.099> that<00:02:08.310> into<00:02:08.879> our

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
consistent and if we took that into our

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.390 
consistent and if we took that into our
big<00:02:09.360> horse<00:02:09.629> training<00:02:10.140> we<00:02:10.709> just<00:02:10.950> thought<00:02:11.220> of

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
big horse training we just thought of

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.750 
big horse training we just thought of
our<00:02:11.550> horses<00:02:11.849> as

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
our horses as

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.390 
our horses as
with<00:02:13.060> the<00:02:13.269> that<00:02:14.140> we<00:02:14.290> needed<00:02:14.530> to<00:02:14.680> train<00:02:15.099> to<00:02:15.370> the

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
with the that we needed to train to the

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.399 
with the that we needed to train to the
same<00:02:15.730> standard<00:02:16.330> that<00:02:16.360> we<00:02:16.599> train<00:02:16.930> the<00:02:17.230> guide

00:02:17.399 --> 00:02:17.409 
same standard that we train the guide

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:20.880 
same standard that we train the guide
horses<00:02:18.000> our<00:02:19.000> big<00:02:19.239> horses<00:02:19.540> would<00:02:19.870> have<00:02:20.080> far

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
horses our big horses would have far

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.789 
horses our big horses would have far
fewer<00:02:21.190> problems<00:02:21.930> what<00:02:22.930> you're<00:02:23.110> about<00:02:23.319> to<00:02:23.560> see

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:23.799 
fewer problems what you're about to see

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:25.979 
fewer problems what you're about to see
is<00:02:23.950> some<00:02:24.220> of<00:02:24.370> her<00:02:24.670> early<00:02:25.150> obstacle<00:02:25.810> training

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:25.989 
is some of her early obstacle training

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:27.869 
is some of her early obstacle training
I'm<00:02:26.620> gonna<00:02:26.799> take<00:02:27.099> advantage<00:02:27.580> of<00:02:27.730> this

00:02:27.869 --> 00:02:27.879 
I'm gonna take advantage of this

this<00:03:16.209> coming<00:03:16.690> up<00:03:16.840> is<00:03:17.079> a<00:03:17.109> really<00:03:17.500> interesting

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
this coming up is a really interesting

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.330 
this coming up is a really interesting
obstacle<00:03:18.970> this<00:03:19.120> was<00:03:19.359> pandas<00:03:20.139> very<00:03:20.829> first

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
obstacle this was pandas very first

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.699 
obstacle this was pandas very first
experience<00:03:22.150> with<00:03:22.450> overhead<00:03:22.930> obstacles<00:03:23.530> and<00:03:23.650> I

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
experience with overhead obstacles and I

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:25.949 
experience with overhead obstacles and I
asked<00:03:24.010> her<00:03:24.099> to<00:03:24.130> go<00:03:24.340> forward<00:03:24.819> and<00:03:25.239> she<00:03:25.690> could<00:03:25.840> go

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
asked her to go forward and she could go

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:28.140 
asked her to go forward and she could go
under<00:03:26.260> the<00:03:26.380> chain<00:03:26.620> so<00:03:26.950> she<00:03:27.010> went<00:03:27.459> under<00:03:27.609> no

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
under the chain so she went under no

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.900 
under the chain so she went under no
problem<00:03:28.599> for<00:03:28.810> her<00:03:28.959> but<00:03:29.260> I<00:03:29.380> ran<00:03:29.590> into<00:03:29.950> it<00:03:30.130> so<00:03:30.880> I

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:30.910 
problem for her but I ran into it so I

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.690 
problem for her but I ran into it so I
repositioned<00:03:31.690> her<00:03:31.840> and<00:03:32.250> second<00:03:33.250> time<00:03:33.370> look

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
repositioned her and second time look

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.670 
repositioned her and second time look
what<00:03:33.730> she<00:03:34.000> did<00:03:34.150> she<00:03:34.180> reaches<00:03:34.750> up<00:03:34.930> she<00:03:35.200> touches

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
what she did she reaches up she touches

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.550 
what she did she reaches up she touches
it<00:03:35.709> I<00:03:36.069> asked<00:03:36.669> her<00:03:36.730> to<00:03:36.760> go<00:03:36.940> forward<00:03:37.359> again<00:03:37.560> she

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
it I asked her to go forward again she

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.270 
it I asked her to go forward again she
tried<00:03:38.829> to<00:03:38.859> go<00:03:39.130> forward<00:03:39.549> I<00:03:39.639> again<00:03:40.030> ran<00:03:40.329> into<00:03:40.780> the

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
tried to go forward I again ran into the

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.150 
tried to go forward I again ran into the
chain<00:03:42.690> and<00:03:43.690> now<00:03:43.930> I'm<00:03:44.019> going<00:03:44.200> to<00:03:44.319> read<00:03:44.560> present

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160 
chain and now I'm going to read present

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.490 
chain and now I'm going to read present
her<00:03:45.340> again<00:03:45.730> and<00:03:46.030> on<00:03:46.450> her<00:03:46.599> third<00:03:46.870> try<00:03:47.169> I<00:03:47.200> asked

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
her again and on her third try I asked

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.670 
her again and on her third try I asked
her<00:03:47.709> to<00:03:47.799> go<00:03:47.919> forward<00:03:48.400> and<00:03:48.579> this<00:03:49.150> time<00:03:49.450> she<00:03:50.410> took

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680 
her to go forward and this time she took

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.159 
her to go forward and this time she took
me<00:03:50.950> around<00:03:51.400> it<00:03:51.639> so<00:03:51.819> she<00:03:51.880> gets<00:03:52.269> a<00:03:52.450> big<00:03:52.660> click<00:03:52.989> and

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:53.169 
me around it so she gets a big click and

00:03:53.169 --> 00:03:55.050 
me around it so she gets a big click and
a<00:03:53.230> treat<00:03:53.470> for<00:03:53.709> that<00:03:53.769> and<00:03:54.280> this<00:03:54.700> is<00:03:54.910> the

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
a treat for that and this is the

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:56.759 
a treat for that and this is the
beginning<00:03:55.180> of<00:03:55.540> what<00:03:55.720> we<00:03:55.840> call<00:03:55.870> intelligent

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:56.769
