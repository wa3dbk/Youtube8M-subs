00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.780
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:09.410
 Alpha together 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.410

 bejean 

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:22.100
 Do you know today about the docomo's exposure e-mail that has been available since December 17? 

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:26.029
 I think that I want to do it 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:33.300
 Though mode number email has been started for a while 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:39.210
 This time the skills will be expanded The functions to be expanded are now usable by everyone 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:40.480
 It is very important for docomo's iphone, which I have started, so I would like to explain it this time 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:46.660
 I think 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:51.820
 First of all, I would like to explain what has been enhanced. 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:57.130
 First of all , provision of browser version docomo mail 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:01:04.930
 That's one and docomo mail imap support 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:07.540
 And is It is do you or I ima p corresponding say with timer I junk e-mail you 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:11.810
 It is offer of makase block 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:17.509
 It is these three It is three newly each 13 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:20.780
 Has it and is referred to as here? Which is important for iphone of the DOCOMO 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:24.770
 Aima ima b 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:30.020
 It is what very important that became the corresponding 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:31.830
 First of all I like DoCoMo e-mail can be used in one eye browser after the band also e-mail browser 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:36.900
 There are various things to say 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:40.370
 Devices will be able to use docomo mail 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:45.230
 Of course the same is true for PCs and tablets 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:47.300
 And I can use it with a non-contracted smartphone called white rom 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:50.420
 That 's one thing 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:54.650
 And the second docomo mail 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:59.000
 Aima ima p correspondence but this is what 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:02:00.360
 It is ima p 4 correspondence when saying to disillusionment 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:06.900
 ima p 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:07.560
 It means that e 4 can receive the DoCoMo e-mail if you use the corresponding rail app 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.460
 I 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:16.110
 I said from the beginning docomo mail via iphone 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:20.380
 But what's important here is that iphone downloads various apps 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:25.120
 You can use Te course various up by other carriers 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:29.110
 We can choose a to use, but until now 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:32.230
 Those who do not earn are originally in iphone 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:38.950
 It could not be used unless it was a standard email app 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:40.370
 Not always go get the mail yet to say that to say this is a 15-minute interval 30-minute interval and h 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.459
 A home without 's 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:48.560
 The center of gravity at a certain time 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:52.140
 We You're But this time I was not made only to set such that 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:03:00.110
 In this ima p 4 correspondence 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:03:02.730
 That green is also found, and often seen in such Notice 2 death Softbank that made 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:06.360
 I wonder if it is a frame 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:10.379
 It seems that such a function is attached 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:14.050
 It seems that you do not have a contract with DoCoMo's iphone. 

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:18.970
 I can not get confirmation a little 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:22.300
 And the third one is the spam e-mail block 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:25.710
 Is this an enhanced version of spam? 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:31.310
 This side will fly a little this time 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:34.880
 I have an app called Garden Eco Mailer, but 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:39.739
 It is when making docomo mail compatible 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:46.099
 At first it is procedure of setting, but please issue docomo id tu 

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:46.550
 If you do not have one , please issue it and where do you use the email settings? 

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:49.790
 is not it 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:51.330
 Here are two things that are important first 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:55.170
 It is detailed here 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:59.070
 I would like to explain good settings though 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:04:04.830
 Rather than explaining with animations 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:05.190
 I will put a link in the description section below, so how about setting it as a reference ? 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:11.319
 Or 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:16.030
 This time finally Docomo Mail says that it corresponds to the ima p yes method 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:17.049
 It's news is that various mail applications will be available on docomo's iphone 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:21.699
 What is it 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:25.530
 It's apparently not be used and the car e-mail a lot of a little scene now 

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:30.490
 Because it will also be usable 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:33.620
 Good news for docomo users 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:40.720
 It's kind of a line now 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:44.940
 So heavy user Well at'm mainstream but I think that has been reduced 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.940
 It is safe if it corresponds well 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:51.189
 It was a story 

00:04:48.529 --> 00:04:51.189
 That's why
