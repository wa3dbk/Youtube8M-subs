00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.850 
do so I decided not to do that plus I
was<00:01:44.700> onto<00:01:44.880> said<00:01:45.240> sure<00:01:45.420> on<00:01:45.570> how<00:01:45.840> good<00:01:46.560> was<00:01:46.740> gonna

because<00:02:34.530> really<00:02:34.860> these<00:02:35.520> braids<00:02:35.940> probably

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
because really these braids probably

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:42.920 
because really these braids probably
took<00:02:36.540> me<00:02:38.000> roughly<00:02:40.010> five<00:02:41.010> hours<00:02:41.490> um<00:02:41.930> enough

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
took me roughly five hours um enough

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.710 
took me roughly five hours um enough
because<00:02:43.290> I<00:02:43.650> did<00:02:44.310> a<00:02:44.340> lot<00:02:44.730> more<00:02:44.970> than<00:02:45.210> I<00:02:45.360> did<00:02:45.570> a

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
because I did a lot more than I did a

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:46.970 
because I did a lot more than I did a
lot<00:02:45.810> less<00:02:46.050> than<00:02:46.260> last<00:02:46.380> time<00:02:46.500> last<00:02:46.770> time<00:02:46.860> I

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
lot less than last time last time I

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.530 
lot less than last time last time I
probably<00:02:47.340> bent<00:02:47.520> over<00:02:47.670> on<00:02:47.730> two<00:02:47.940> braids<00:02:48.150> to<00:02:48.450> be

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
probably bent over on two braids to be

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.100 
probably bent over on two braids to be
honest<00:02:48.810> to<00:02:48.960> you<00:02:49.080> because<00:02:50.040> I<00:02:50.900> hadn't<00:02:51.900> really

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
honest to you because I hadn't really

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.140 
honest to you because I hadn't really
done<00:02:52.500> brave<00:02:52.830> this<00:02:53.040> long<00:02:53.280> so<00:02:53.820> I<00:02:53.850> wasn't<00:02:54.060> really

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150
