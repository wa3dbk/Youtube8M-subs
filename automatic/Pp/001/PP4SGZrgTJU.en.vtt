beginners to go for the next distance
and<00:01:21.869> I<00:01:21.960> think<00:01:22.170> five<00:01:22.350> kids<00:01:22.619> at<00:01:22.710> 10k<00:01:23.009> is<00:01:23.159> a<00:01:23.189> good

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
and I think five kids at 10k is a good

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.609 
and I think five kids at 10k is a good
step<00:01:23.759> I'm<00:01:24.540> glad<00:01:24.689> you<00:01:24.900> didn't<00:01:25.110> say<00:01:25.229> you<00:01:25.290> want<00:01:25.530> to

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.149 
step I'm glad you didn't say you want to
do<00:01:25.680> a<00:01:25.710> marathon<00:01:25.920> next<00:01:27.409> but<00:01:28.409> and<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.829> reason<00:01:29.070> I

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
do a marathon next but and the reason I

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.030 
do a marathon next but and the reason I
say<00:01:29.189> that<00:01:29.369> is<00:01:29.759> that<00:01:30.479> when<00:01:31.079> you<00:01:31.200> do<00:01:31.500> a<00:01:31.530> 10k

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
say that is that when you do a 10k

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.609 
say that is that when you do a 10k
that's<00:01:32.670> going<00:01:32.909> to<00:01:32.970> require<00:01:33.479> you<00:01:33.990> to<00:01:34.170> do<00:01:34.380> a

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
that's going to require you to do a

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.010 
that's going to require you to do a
little<00:01:34.890> bit<00:01:35.040> more<00:01:35.159> mileage<00:01:35.400> not<00:01:35.759> a<00:01:35.790> lot<00:01:36.000> do<00:01:36.990> a

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
little bit more mileage not a lot do a

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.830 
little bit more mileage not a lot do a
little<00:01:37.259> bit<00:01:37.409> further<00:01:37.920> long<00:01:38.250> runs<00:01:38.549> and<00:01:39.509> that

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
little bit further long runs and that

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.420 
little bit further long runs and that
all<00:01:39.990> goes<00:01:40.170> back<00:01:40.380> to<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.619> aerobic<00:01:40.950> system<00:01:41.070> so

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
all goes back to the aerobic system so

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:42.530 
all goes back to the aerobic system so
you're<00:01:41.549> going<00:01:41.670> to<00:01:41.729> be<00:01:41.820> doing<00:01:41.909> more<00:01:42.210> mileage

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
you're going to be doing more mileage

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.080 
you're going to be doing more mileage
training<00:01:43.380> consistently<00:01:43.979> doing<00:01:44.520> longer<00:01:44.909> long

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.730 
training consistently doing longer long
runs<00:01:45.329> developing<00:01:45.810> your<00:01:45.930> aerobic<00:01:46.259> system<00:01:46.380> and

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
runs developing your aerobic system and

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.620 
runs developing your aerobic system and
that<00:01:47.280> is<00:01:47.460> actually<00:01:47.670> going<00:01:48.030> to<00:01:48.210> make<00:01:48.450> you

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
that is actually going to make you

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.980 
that is actually going to make you
faster<00:01:48.960> at<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.680> 5k<00:01:50.130> just<00:01:50.850> in<00:01:50.970> general<00:01:51.030> because

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
faster at the 5k just in general because

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.260 
faster at the 5k just in general because
the<00:01:52.290> strong<00:01:52.530> your<00:01:52.740> aerobic<00:01:53.100> system<00:01:53.250> gets<00:01:53.610> the

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
the strong your aerobic system gets the

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.300 
the strong your aerobic system gets the
easier<00:01:54.659> it's<00:01:54.810> going<00:01:54.840> to<00:01:55.020> be<00:01:55.140> to<00:01:55.439> run<00:01:55.590> a<00:01:55.619> 5k<00:01:55.890> and

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
easier it's going to be to run a 5k and

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.149 
easier it's going to be to run a 5k and
so<00:01:56.850> I<00:01:57.210> think<00:01:58.140> you're<00:01:58.320> you<00:01:58.590> could<00:01:58.770> train<00:01:58.979> for

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
so I think you're you could train for

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.249 
so I think you're you could train for
the<00:01:59.219> 10k<00:01:59.579> and<00:01:59.820> get<00:02:00.180> to<00:02:00.299> that<00:02:00.390> distance<00:02:00.810> and<00:02:01.020> I

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
the 10k and get to that distance and I

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.260 
the 10k and get to that distance and I
think<00:02:01.460> automatically<00:02:02.460> you'll<00:02:02.640> get<00:02:02.790> faster<00:02:03.180> at

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
think automatically you'll get faster at

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.959 
think automatically you'll get faster at
5k<00:02:03.479> so<00:02:03.719> if<00:02:04.259> you<00:02:04.710> want<00:02:04.950> my<00:02:05.070> specific<00:02:05.520> advice<00:02:05.729> I

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
5k so if you want my specific advice I

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.570 
5k so if you want my specific advice I
would<00:02:06.030> say<00:02:06.320> try<00:02:07.320> to<00:02:07.409> run<00:02:07.619> a<00:02:07.649> 10k<00:02:07.860> and<00:02:08.250> then<00:02:08.550> I

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
would say try to run a 10k and then I

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.130 
would say try to run a 10k and then I
think<00:02:09.030> it's<00:02:09.300> also<00:02:09.509> going<00:02:09.720> to<00:02:09.780> be<00:02:09.929> the

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
think it's also going to be the

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.500 
think it's also going to be the
contributing<00:02:11.129> factor<00:02:11.430> of<00:02:11.520> also<00:02:11.790> allowing<00:02:12.270> you

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
contributing factor of also allowing you

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.370 
contributing factor of also allowing you
to<00:02:12.690> run<00:02:12.870> faster

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
to run faster

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.440 
to run faster
5k<00:02:14.510> cool<00:02:15.510> yeah<00:02:16.020> I<00:02:16.050> mean<00:02:16.200> one<00:02:17.010> stone<00:02:17.450> that's

5k cool yeah I mean one stone that's

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.930 
5k cool yeah I mean one stone that's

themselves<00:02:29.880> with<00:02:30.630> the<00:02:30.750> key<00:02:30.960> yeah<00:02:31.650> it<00:02:32.070> can

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
themselves with the key yeah it can

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.060 
themselves with the key yeah it can
become<00:02:32.280> yeah<00:02:33.240> as<00:02:33.510> we<00:02:33.690> found<00:02:33.960> with<00:02:34.200> one<00:02:34.950> of

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
become yeah as we found with one of

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.160 
become yeah as we found with one of
those<00:02:35.160> questions<00:02:35.610> I<00:02:35.730> think<00:02:35.970> I<00:02:36.120> think<00:02:36.420> been

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
those questions I think I think been

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.440 
those questions I think I think been
directly<00:02:37.620> talk<00:02:37.920> about<00:02:38.190> heat<00:02:38.460> but<00:02:38.910> I<00:02:38.940> think

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
directly talk about heat but I think

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.450 
directly talk about heat but I think
that<00:02:40.260> I<00:02:40.290> think<00:02:40.500> that's<00:02:40.710> probably<00:02:40.920> what's<00:02:41.220> part

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:41.460 
that I think that's probably what's part

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.910 
that I think that's probably what's part
in<00:02:41.940> that<00:02:42.150> particular<00:02:42.330> case<00:02:42.660> because<00:02:43.050> I<00:02:43.770> know<00:02:43.830> I

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
in that particular case because I know I

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.890 
in that particular case because I know I
suffer<00:02:44.400> too<00:02:44.580> in<00:02:44.760> the<00:02:45.030> heat<00:02:45.210> if<00:02:45.360> I<00:02:45.480> tried<00:02:45.720> to<00:02:45.810> do

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
suffer too in the heat if I tried to do

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.140 
suffer too in the heat if I tried to do
a<00:02:45.930> hard<00:02:46.140> workout<00:02:46.470> my<00:02:47.190> stomach<00:02:47.580> is<00:02:47.700> upside<00:02:48.120> down
