00:00:11.619 --> 00:00:14.469
 as you can see and at a first glance 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:16.169
 we have wanted 

00:00:16.169 --> 00:00:19.279
 that from there the device has been opened to be bought 

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:22.749
 sun screens to the air 

00:00:22.749 --> 00:00:25.419
 xie touch screen 

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:29.869
 i the keyboard qwerty the peculiarity that hits positive apart from many others 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:32.940
 Multimedia features that it offers we will explain in this year 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:35.640
 let's start 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.490
 without further delay to 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:41.310
 to work with the speech of riÃ­to acs from which our without 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:43.160
 orange 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.160
 as you see incorporates a card of four giant headquarters of series is possible 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:47.750
 to love 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.750
 insert any other up to 32 gigs 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:53.500
 percent is very positive 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.030
 it has a light weight 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.300
 we are talking about 160 grams or so 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:01.600
 the dimensions are 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.510
 quite contained regarding what is your 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:07.420
 a conventional blackberry with qwerty only 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.560
 everything is screen in this case it takes advantage of all the space I went through 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.430
 crystalline 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.820
 what to say then the 624 megawatt processor 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.080
 we have the 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.060
 the trackpad 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.579
 optical for them by themselves apart from the touch screen and the 

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:25.150
 conventional keyboard 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.170
 your screen has 3 with 2 inches 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.380
 i a resolution of 3 60 by 4 80 pixels 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:36.400
 the camera while they were so bad the risk indicated it 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.170
 here we found a camera in the back of 5 megapixels with 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.870
 autofocus 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:44.649
 by the way image stabilizer 

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:50.009
 multiple scene modes to suit the conditions of the mines doing the 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.050
 around the photo did not affect us 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.830
 geolocation of the photo ie with the integrated GPS says where it has been done 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:56.950
 the photo 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.950
 and a fundecyt to d2 commented 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.359
 also of course record video vg anses account for 4 80 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.009
 and the device incorporates the classics because it exposes stores 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:11.829
 on the side we have 

00:02:11.829 --> 00:02:14.829
 to win was to listen to our favorite music 

00:02:15.369 --> 00:02:17.210
 internally how not 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:21.010
 We have wi-fi connectivity with all protocols included in the ere 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:27.530
 and the showest incorporates is the star show of rim at this moment that is 

00:02:27.529 --> 00:02:29.100
 the operating system os 6 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.239
 this most advanced hostage operating system 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:33.839
 that was an exponential jump regards five 

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:36.839
 and it brings a lot of improvements in the navigation or the menu system 

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:40.959
 Of course 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:44.309
 on social networks, internet and messaging 

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:45.550
 all that 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:47.390
 Well, let's go holy 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:50.620
 very important to become a more common reference 

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:54.039
 we got it 

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:55.789
 13 Andean 

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:58.789
 6th 6th initial hoisting 

00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:03.309
 let's enter the pin code of the sim card 

00:03:04.499 --> 00:03:07.819
 we will be so for example with the qwerty keyboard 

00:03:08.779 --> 00:03:12.239
 because I was losing is allows that will play before the touch screen and the 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:14.929
 qwerty keyboard with whatever is most comfortable for us and we're 

00:03:14.929 --> 00:03:18.229
 customary keyboard we can do it if we want 

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:20.889
 the touch experience of the screen also 

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:23.889
 we have it validated 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:28.419
 since we have the interface of the two 

00:03:28.419 --> 00:03:32.789
 totally renewed nothing to do with the previous version 5 of the show system 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:39.519
 system of this distant 

00:03:40.339 --> 00:03:42.419
 we have the option 

00:03:42.419 --> 00:03:45.979
 where we observe all the applications and adjustments of the speech berry 

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:52.799
 totally slidable between screens the most frequent the downloads only 

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:55.559
 a tab next to the multimedia 

00:03:55.559 --> 00:03:59.379
 our favorites and here we find nothing the tab or better said 

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:02.079
 demarcate all 

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:05.169
 they still keep doing the menu key of blackberry 

00:04:05.839 --> 00:04:08.299
 a classic of the house 

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:11.299
 we are not allowed to do all the actions with tactility 

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:15.349
 and from here 

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:18.619
 we will start gentlemen some things device
