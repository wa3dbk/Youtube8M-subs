for the Osprey gunner to fly you over to
the<00:01:10.380> other<00:01:10.500> side<00:01:10.770> of<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:10.920> map<00:01:11.130> on<00:01:11.280> this<00:01:11.460> hill

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
the other side of the map on this hill

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.240 
the other side of the map on this hill
and<00:01:12.200> once<00:01:13.200> you<00:01:13.290> hit<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.500> ground<00:01:13.650> you<00:01:14.010> can<00:01:14.130> just

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
and once you hit the ground you can just

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.740 
and once you hit the ground you can just
place<00:01:14.400> your<00:01:14.520> attack<00:01:14.760> and<00:01:15.030> you<00:01:15.119> will<00:01:15.299> spawn<00:01:15.600> out

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
place your attack and you will spawn out

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.749 
place your attack and you will spawn out
here<00:01:15.930> every<00:01:16.140> time<00:01:16.320> so<00:01:17.009> I<00:01:17.040> recommend<00:01:17.369> putting

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
here every time so I recommend putting

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.010 
here every time so I recommend putting
attack<00:01:18.090> on<00:01:18.330> so<00:01:18.450> you<00:01:18.509> don't<00:01:18.570> have<00:01:18.720> to<00:01:18.840> do<00:01:18.900> this

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
attack on so you don't have to do this

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.480 
attack on so you don't have to do this
every<00:01:19.200> time<00:01:19.530> because<00:01:19.920> we're<00:01:20.040> probably<00:01:20.280> going

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
every time because we're probably going

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.969 
every time because we're probably going
to<00:01:20.549> knowing<00:01:21.110> and<00:01:22.110> that<00:01:22.259> is<00:01:22.350> all<00:01:22.530> that<00:01:22.560> you<00:01:22.740> guys
