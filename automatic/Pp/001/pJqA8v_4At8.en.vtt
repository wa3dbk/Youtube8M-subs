some Instagram pictures and a video

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.930 
some Instagram pictures and a video
recently<00:00:06.540> because<00:00:07.259> I<00:00:07.290> got<00:00:07.649> so<00:00:08.040> many<00:00:08.370> requests

recently because I got so many requests

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.400 
recently because I got so many requests
for<00:00:09.090> it<00:00:09.240> because<00:00:09.510> it's<00:00:09.780> kind<00:00:09.900> of<00:00:10.019> different

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
for it because it's kind of different

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:11.780 
for it because it's kind of different
from<00:00:10.740> the<00:00:10.889> way<00:00:11.010> that<00:00:11.219> I<00:00:11.250> usually<00:00:11.460> wear<00:00:11.759> my

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
from the way that I usually wear my

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.430 
from the way that I usually wear my
makeup<00:00:12.269> so<00:00:12.450> I<00:00:12.480> think<00:00:12.570> a<00:00:12.780> lot<00:00:12.929> of<00:00:13.019> people<00:00:13.290> just

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
makeup so I think a lot of people just

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.709 
makeup so I think a lot of people just
kind<00:00:13.650> of<00:00:13.710> noticed<00:00:14.040> but<00:00:14.400> it's<00:00:14.730> a<00:00:14.790> super<00:00:15.269> simple

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
kind of noticed but it's a super simple

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.480 
kind of noticed but it's a super simple
easy<00:00:16.020> look<00:00:16.350> so<00:00:16.590> I<00:00:16.619> thought<00:00:16.920> I<00:00:16.949> would<00:00:17.070> film<00:00:17.310> it

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
but I accidentally bought this one so

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.180 
but I accidentally bought this one so
we're<00:02:18.870> going<00:02:18.990> to<00:02:19.050> use<00:02:19.170> it<00:02:19.350> in<00:02:19.560> the<00:02:19.770> photo<00:02:20.010> I'm

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
we're going to use it in the photo I'm

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.190 
we're going to use it in the photo I'm
pretty<00:02:20.430> sure<00:02:20.640> I<00:02:20.820> used<00:02:21.060> my<00:02:21.300> dip<00:02:21.570> brow<00:02:21.810> but<00:02:22.140> I

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
pretty sure I used my dip brow but I

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.650 
pretty sure I used my dip brow but I
can't<00:02:22.590> currently<00:02:23.100> find<00:02:23.370> it<00:02:23.520> at<00:02:23.850> the<00:02:23.970> moment<00:02:24.150> so

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
can't currently find it at the moment so

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.290 
can't currently find it at the moment so
this<00:02:25.560> will<00:02:25.770> have<00:02:26.010> to<00:02:26.190> do<00:02:26.340> using<00:02:26.760> this<00:02:27.060> color

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
this will have to do using this color

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.580 
this will have to do using this color
just<00:02:27.480> kind<00:02:27.660> of<00:02:27.750> makes<00:02:27.930> it<00:02:28.050> more<00:02:28.230> like<00:02:28.410> my

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
just kind of makes it more like my

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.890 
just kind of makes it more like my
natural<00:02:28.770> brow<00:02:29.250> color<00:02:29.490> rather<00:02:30.270> than<00:02:30.570> a<00:02:30.600> bit

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
natural brow color rather than a bit

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.330 
natural brow color rather than a bit
darker<00:02:31.350> so<00:02:31.380> that<00:02:31.740> would<00:02:31.830> be<00:02:31.890> like<00:02:32.010> the<00:02:32.160> main

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
darker so that would be like the main

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:33.830 
darker so that would be like the main
difference<00:02:32.760> now<00:02:33.060> I'm<00:02:33.120> going<00:02:33.390> to<00:02:33.450> set<00:02:33.660> them
