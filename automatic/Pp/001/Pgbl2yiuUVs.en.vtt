00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.460
 gentlemen today let's analyze 

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:10.040
 test and say in depth the 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.040
 our hard disk initials and follow me 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:20.730
 then gentlemen I have already made a video 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.800
 a previous video on the benchmark of 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.570
 our on the record I also want to talk 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.920
 of this software because it is worth it 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:32.130
 penalty and is done well then first of all 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:35.190
 you will find a link below my chair 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:38.149
 I meant under the video that few 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:41.430
 words will bring you back hey daddy of gulu 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:44.520
 that is where I apologize 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:47.879
 what does it mean and hdd is the 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:51.090
 acronym of hard disk as hard 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:57.170
 disk because ssd instead the nord disk allo 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:01:01.020
 solid state only in solid status only 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:03.750
 so now let's pass how many bullshit 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.790
 indicating in a repeating video 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.850
 I wonder as well yet they succeed without 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:13.920
 think of it I do n't sign anything I teach 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:15.750
 then nothing I say then once 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.310
 It comes on this site come form 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.869
 with the scooter parked by 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.590
 surprising of a smoke coffee of 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:24.689
 cigarette then download the program 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.970
 here it is as a version logically 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:31.170
 when I'm doing the video there is the 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:33.180
 version 3.1 logically if there is one 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.900
 most updated version downloaded with the 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.720
 your day 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.490
 because as I repeat always you don't have to 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.369
 take everything as my own 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:44.070
 although I am using the 3.1 and we will be 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:48.360
 3.5 sata da 3.5 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:51.240
 now once the rar file is downloaded 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.920
 we have to extract it because this 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.320
 software needs no installation 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.600
 we need to extract the file 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.479
 here he is once he did this 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:04.070
 we look for the only executable file that 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.070
 dance an exe file words 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.539
 here it is, it started under I don't know 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.239
 why 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:13.160
 at this point we select ours 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:16.520
 hard disk that interests us in this 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.400
 In case we go with my sst we click 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.959
 on smart to get information 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.239
 continue look with beautiful formations 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:25.780
 here it is 1 and 2 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:28.819
 these are the artist's information 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:33.200
 then to pass the test we have to 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:37.130
 let's go to surface des and we can 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:39.019
 in a few words we can see on 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.750
 our selected disc make a 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:44.900
 verification of our hard disk the 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:47.420
 verifies the verification here in reading e 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:50.390
 written reis in a few words and she wants 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:53.209
 say cancellation that leads to word 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:57.370
 it means writing that is readings 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:03:01.670
 writings in this case butterfly reed 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:04.209
 I read this butterfly here too 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:09.470
 using the sense of this 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:11.660
 functionality in smart tests I don't know 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.549
 because they put it explained to me 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:16.670
 comments work because there is this 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:19.340
 function because I consider myself worthless you 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:22.970
 I apologize if in case but I consider it 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:25.489
 useless but now we go with the first 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:29.180
 let's not testing directly 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:31.370
 we go in reed to test we click 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:34.489
 here it is as you are seeing below in the 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:37.639
 test manager we can put more 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:41.329
 texts at the same time we go to and 

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:45.870
 race a nov 

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:56.940
 then I apologize for a moment 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:04:00.659
 stop a test yes perfect here it is 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:04.349
 we can do two tests put two tests 

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:06.450
 good for one case for information 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:08.730
 you can also put them on 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.950
 break we can also as you are 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:14.340
 seeing them we can cancel 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:16.440
 now we put red test again 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:20.340
 once this is done we click two 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:24.539
 sometimes on the test that interests us here it is 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:28.020
 here and another table opens this one 

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:30.720
 table is divided into the graphs here are true 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:33.419
 He explains in a very simple way there 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:36.660
 both with the graph in a few words 

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:38.280
 this here to waves and yes to express oneself 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.620
 turned the head so it is expressed e 

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.030
 megabit 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:48.030
 which means beautiful green bay 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:51.270
 so clearly it's reading at 350 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:53.880
 I do not understand megabytes for fine 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:56.039
 however the text here is why anyway 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:58.320
 the test has yet to finish 

00:04:56.039 --> 00:04:59.760
 try to get it to the end but 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.130
 I can't talk to get to the end 

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:04.800
 because this will take some time 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:08.400
 here compared to what I reviewed 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:10.289
 before it is more particular it lasts longer 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:13.680
 assures you it lasts longer than you watch 

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:17.039
 to 7 percent already here no more 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:19.560
 then we also have the graphic in style 

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:22.650
 type let's say but here I have to turn again 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:25.380
 in the kit when you can fill and 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:27.510
 It in the report style is good for 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:29.370
 have everything when under control 

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:32.639
 click on hicks 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:35.729
 then I recommend this software 

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:36.120
 if then there are other options I do 

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:39.000
 the example 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:42.000
 We have four smart smart generates 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:45.840
 the shortest let me give you an example 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:49.740
 are so many options 

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:53.229
 top here is the other party 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:57.219
 here it is a short head and this one 

00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:59.650
 fast test okay I recommend it 

00:05:57.219 --> 00:06:02.349
 this also because it is not so much 

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:05.050
 known I am not for I am not one 

00:06:02.349 --> 00:06:07.990
 of those types who must be good at 

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:09.939
 find alternativity because being 

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:13.419
 already good at something you are 

00:06:09.939 --> 00:06:16.840
 automatically alternative for the mass 

00:06:13.419 --> 00:06:18.819
 okay so i'm not one of those that 

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:21.039
 go to find the alternative because yes 

00:06:18.819 --> 00:06:23.590
 the second software is cool though 

00:06:21.039 --> 00:06:26.080
 me must be more rewarded because it is 

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:29.379
 really in my opinion efficient of 

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:30.819
 good really really good is a 

00:06:29.379 --> 00:06:33.129
 other people who talked about it 

00:06:30.819 --> 00:06:36.939
 really good and yet he was a savior 

00:06:33.129 --> 00:06:39.729
 I will say that I don't feel so much but myself 

00:06:36.939 --> 00:06:41.529
 the absolute because he is a great I follow him 

00:06:39.729 --> 00:06:44.620
 maybe since his blog didn't count 

00:06:41.529 --> 00:06:48.849
 shit to what he has done has been in 

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:49.690
 television with belen of ex 

00:06:48.849 --> 00:06:53.650
 stands 

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:55.779
 no viruses spy a few words very good 

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:58.779
 he also reviewed this thing here 

00:06:55.779 --> 00:07:01.479
 then gentlemen I have finished 

00:06:58.779 --> 00:07:02.800
 do your tests as well thank you 

00:07:01.479 --> 00:07:08.729
 again of the time you have dedicated to me 

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:08.729
 vice on 17 I salute you and who can
