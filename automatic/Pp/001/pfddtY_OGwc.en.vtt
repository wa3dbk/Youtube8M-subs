00:02:53.330 --> 00:03:08.590

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:41.620
 top 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:43.780
 It's like a game of 3 countries Jed on the second fret 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:46.350
 second strings third on an arc and 1 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:46.350

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:59.910
 chord there are 5 4 strings clamped on the second 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:02.020

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:22.180
 the same chords because they played with you 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:24.610
 here we play in the example and in the couplet 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:28.210
 we just add the same and the other 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:36.060
 we remove such castling for chess players 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:36.060
