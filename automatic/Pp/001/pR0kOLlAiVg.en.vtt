00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:11.730 
magnesium rod that's on there and you

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:14.330 
magnesium rod that's on there and you
scrape<00:01:12.000> off<00:01:12.210> a<00:01:12.510> little<00:01:13.080> shavings<00:01:13.530> of<00:01:13.620> it<00:01:13.830> make

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
scrape off a little shavings of it make

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.490 
scrape off a little shavings of it make
a<00:01:14.370> little<00:01:14.610> pile<00:01:14.790> of<00:01:14.820> them<00:01:15.150> and<00:01:15.390> then<00:01:16.170> use<00:01:16.350> the

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
a little pile of them and then use the

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.940 
a little pile of them and then use the
fire<00:01:16.710> steel<00:01:17.070> to<00:01:17.700> like<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.260> life<00:01:19.260> of<00:01:19.380> magnesium

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
fire steel to like the life of magnesium

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.070 
fire steel to like the life of magnesium
which<00:01:20.130> build<00:01:20.580> in<00:01:20.670> like<00:01:20.880> the<00:01:21.600> other<00:01:21.630> tinder

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
which build in like the other tinder

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.650 
which build in like the other tinder
that's<00:01:22.260> a<00:01:22.350> little<00:01:22.470> bit<00:01:22.620> harder<00:01:22.920> to<00:01:22.980> get<00:01:23.160> going

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:23.660 
that's a little bit harder to get going

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.360 
that's a little bit harder to get going
so<00:01:24.660> we're<00:01:24.780> just<00:01:24.810> going<00:01:25.020> to<00:01:25.110> use<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.620> attached

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:26.370 
so we're just going to use the attached

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:28.820 
so we're just going to use the attached
striker<00:01:26.760> and<00:01:27.090> make<00:01:27.900> a<00:01:27.930> little<00:01:28.170> pile<00:01:28.470> of<00:01:28.680> the

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:28.830 
striker and make a little pile of the

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:34.429 
striker and make a little pile of the
magnesium<00:01:29.100> shavings

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.319

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
it's now that we have a little bit of

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.779 
it's now that we have a little bit of
that<00:01:36.479> we're<00:01:36.780> gonna<00:01:36.899> gather<00:01:37.140> it<00:01:37.409> up<00:01:37.640> make<00:01:38.640> it

00:01:38.779 --> 00:01:38.789 
that we're gonna gather it up make it

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:41.200 
that we're gonna gather it up make it
easier<00:01:39.180> to<00:01:39.240> light<00:01:39.539> you<00:01:40.289> can<00:01:40.439> stick<00:01:40.619> together<00:01:40.770> a

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
easier to light you can stick together a

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:43.700 
easier to light you can stick together a
