this<00:01:53.920> way<00:01:54.130> and<00:01:54.160> that<00:01:54.430> was<00:01:54.700> just<00:01:54.880> really<00:01:55.180> a<00:01:55.270> pain

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:55.540 
this way and that was just really a pain

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.500 
this way and that was just really a pain
so<00:01:56.140> I<00:01:56.170> lay<00:01:56.560> my<00:01:56.740> fingernail<00:01:57.310> on<00:01:57.580> here<00:01:58.180> and<00:01:58.300> I<00:01:58.330> see

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:58.510 
so I lay my fingernail on here and I see

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:59.670 
so I lay my fingernail on here and I see
how<00:01:58.660> long<00:01:58.780> I<00:01:58.930> need<00:01:58.990> it<00:01:59.200> and<00:01:59.320> then<00:01:59.470> I<00:01:59.500> actually

00:01:59.670 --> 00:01:59.680 
how long I need it and then I actually

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.530 
how long I need it and then I actually
come<00:02:00.100> in<00:02:00.250> from<00:02:00.460> the<00:02:00.610> side<00:02:02.250> and<00:02:03.250> it's<00:02:04.000> obviously

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:04.540 
come in from the side and it's obviously

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:06.720 
come in from the side and it's obviously
easier<00:02:05.050> when<00:02:05.710> it's<00:02:05.860> the<00:02:05.980> full<00:02:06.160> sheet<00:02:06.430> but

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:06.730 
easier when it's the full sheet but

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:09.090 
easier when it's the full sheet but
these<00:02:07.180> are<00:02:07.330> my<00:02:07.450> bits<00:02:07.690> and<00:02:07.870> pieces<00:02:08.050> for<00:02:08.920> this

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.100 
these are my bits and pieces for this

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.280 
these are my bits and pieces for this
application<00:02:09.460> so<00:02:10.000> I<00:02:10.090> cut<00:02:10.330> out<00:02:10.360> what<00:02:10.720> I<00:02:10.750> need<00:02:11.050> and

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
application so I cut out what I need and

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.770 
application so I cut out what I need and
then<00:02:11.560> if<00:02:11.710> you<00:02:11.830> see<00:02:12.010> it<00:02:12.280> just<00:02:12.460> kind<00:02:12.940> of<00:02:13.000> folds

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
then if you see it just kind of folds

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.440 
then if you see it just kind of folds
right<00:02:14.050> off<00:02:14.350> like<00:02:15.160> that<00:02:15.400> so<00:02:15.700> I<00:02:15.940> come<00:02:16.180> in<00:02:16.300> with<00:02:16.390> my

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
right off like that so I come in with my

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.240 
right off like that so I come in with my
tweezers<00:02:16.990> and<00:02:17.140> I'll<00:02:17.230> grab<00:02:17.440> that<00:02:17.620> and<00:02:17.950> I<00:02:20.250> heat

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
tweezers and I'll grab that and I heat

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:27.690 
tweezers and I'll grab that and I heat
it<00:02:21.280> up<00:02:21.460> just<00:02:21.520> like<00:02:21.880> normal<00:02:26.310> you<00:02:27.310> want<00:02:27.520> to<00:02:27.580> make

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
it up just like normal you want to make

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.010 
it up just like normal you want to make
sure<00:02:27.730> that<00:02:28.060> it's<00:02:28.180> getting<00:02:28.360> nice<00:02:28.660> and<00:02:28.690> heated

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020 
sure that it's getting nice and heated

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:30.780 
sure that it's getting nice and heated
so<00:02:29.320> as<00:02:29.380> soon<00:02:29.530> as<00:02:29.620> it<00:02:29.739> starts<00:02:29.950> to<00:02:30.040> curl<00:02:30.520> and

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
so as soon as it starts to curl and

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.720 
so as soon as it starts to curl and
bends<00:02:31.000> that's<00:02:31.300> when<00:02:31.450> it's<00:02:31.600> going<00:02:31.750> to<00:02:31.810> be<00:02:31.930> ready

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
bends that's when it's going to be ready

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.300 
bends that's when it's going to be ready
remember<00:02:33.730> it<00:02:33.940> gets<00:02:34.090> nice<00:02:34.239> and<00:02:34.300> floppy<00:02:35.070> so<00:02:36.070> come

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
remember it gets nice and floppy so come

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:37.710 
remember it gets nice and floppy so come
in<00:02:36.430> here<00:02:36.640> as<00:02:36.730> close<00:02:37.000> to<00:02:37.150> the<00:02:37.239> cuticle<00:02:37.360> as

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
in here as close to the cuticle as

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:49.880 
in here as close to the cuticle as
possible

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.540

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
okay so I have it sitting here then I

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:56.780

come and I push outward first and then I

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.790 
come and I push outward first and then I
go<00:02:56.970> down<00:02:57.180> the<00:02:57.390> sides<00:02:57.690> when<00:02:58.290> I'm<00:02:58.380> going<00:02:58.650> down

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
I push it with my cuticle pusher this is

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.550 
I push it with my cuticle pusher this is
my<00:03:26.490> rubber<00:03:26.730> cuticle<00:03:26.970> pusher<00:03:27.510> not<00:03:28.050> my<00:03:28.260> metal

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
my rubber cuticle pusher not my metal

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:36.040 
my rubber cuticle pusher not my metal
one<00:03:28.739> I<00:03:28.950> used<00:03:29.370> that<00:03:29.610> for<00:03:29.910> the<00:03:30.000> very<00:03:30.239> end<00:03:34.489> okay<00:03:35.489> I

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
have a lot of excess here because I

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.550 
have a lot of excess here because I
wasn't<00:03:39.000> really<00:03:39.390> paying<00:03:39.630> attention<00:03:39.750> of<00:03:40.380> how

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560

much I was cutting on the wrap because I

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.070 
much I was cutting on the wrap because I
was<00:03:43.620> making<00:03:43.890> a<00:03:43.980> video<00:03:44.220> but<00:03:45.030> I<00:03:45.360> trimmed<00:03:45.930> that

here and I go back and forth let me show

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:27.200 
here and I go back and forth let me show
you<00:04:24.020> so<00:04:25.020> I'll<00:04:25.110> go<00:04:25.229> back<00:04:25.380> and<00:04:25.740> forth<00:04:26.040> like<00:04:26.340> this

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
you so I'll go back and forth like this

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:31.940 
you so I'll go back and forth like this
and<00:04:27.990> you<00:04:28.620> can<00:04:28.860> use<00:04:29.030> your<00:04:30.290> tweezers<00:04:31.290> if<00:04:31.770> you

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:31.950 
and you can use your tweezers if you

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:34.580 
and you can use your tweezers if you
have<00:04:32.130> metal<00:04:32.400> tweezers<00:04:32.840> for<00:04:33.840> that<00:04:33.960> I<00:04:34.140> just<00:04:34.169> like

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.590 
have metal tweezers for that I just like

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:36.830 
have metal tweezers for that I just like
these<00:04:35.160> metal<00:04:36.030> spoon<00:04:36.210> cuticle<00:04:36.600> pushers

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
these metal spoon cuticle pushers

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.310 
these metal spoon cuticle pushers
because<00:04:37.169> it's<00:04:37.370> rounded<00:04:38.370> like<00:04:38.820> the<00:04:39.720> nail<00:04:40.020> is

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 
because it's rounded like the nail is

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.680 
because it's rounded like the nail is
and<00:04:40.680> so<00:04:41.280> I<00:04:41.310> feel<00:04:41.640> like<00:04:41.669> it<00:04:41.970> irons<00:04:42.300> it<00:04:42.510> and

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
and so I feel like it irons it and

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:46.430 
and so I feel like it irons it and
really<00:04:43.490> gets<00:04:44.490> all<00:04:44.669> of<00:04:44.820> those<00:04:44.970> little<00:04:45.240> spots<00:04:46.200> on

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.440 
really gets all of those little spots on

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:47.719 
really gets all of those little spots on
your<00:04:46.470> nail<00:04:46.740> that<00:04:46.919> maybe<00:04:47.130> the<00:04:47.310> tweezers

00:04:47.719 --> 00:04:47.729 
your nail that maybe the tweezers

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:51.050 
your nail that maybe the tweezers
wouldn't<00:04:48.210> get<00:04:48.470> so<00:04:49.470> after<00:04:50.070> it<00:04:50.220> is<00:04:50.400> nice<00:04:51.030> and

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
wouldn't get so after it is nice and

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:53.120 
wouldn't get so after it is nice and
ironed<00:04:51.750> on<00:04:51.900> then<00:04:52.470> I<00:04:52.530> just<00:04:52.710> wait<00:04:52.830> for<00:04:52.860> it<00:04:53.040> to

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.130 
ironed on then I just wait for it to

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:57.159 
ironed on then I just wait for it to
cool<00:04:53.310> and<00:04:53.520> I<00:04:53.760> will<00:04:54.000> file<00:04:54.210> it<00:04:54.360> off<00:04:54.510> and<00:04:54.750> I'm<00:04:54.930> good

Dean and I used to have that issue until

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:08.240 
Dean and I used to have that issue until
I<00:05:06.120> found<00:05:06.509> out<00:05:06.690> this<00:05:06.930> little<00:05:07.259> trick<00:05:07.470> so<00:05:07.889> I'm

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.250 
I found out this little trick so I'm

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:10.879 
I found out this little trick so I'm
normal<00:05:08.669> I<00:05:08.759> do<00:05:08.850> my<00:05:09.180> normal<00:05:09.240> filing<00:05:09.990> I<00:05:10.199> come<00:05:10.770> in

00:05:10.879 --> 00:05:10.889 
normal I do my normal filing I come in

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:15.740 
normal I do my normal filing I come in
here<00:05:11.280> and<00:05:11.699> I'll<00:05:11.820> go<00:05:11.970> straight<00:05:12.030> down<00:05:14.750> only

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:15.750 
here and I'll go straight down only

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:17.900 
here and I'll go straight down only
going<00:05:16.320> downwards<00:05:16.860> right<00:05:17.310> you<00:05:17.580> don't<00:05:17.729> want<00:05:17.850> to

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:17.910 
going downwards right you don't want to

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:19.760 
going downwards right you don't want to
be<00:05:17.970> going<00:05:18.090> back<00:05:18.360> up<00:05:18.570> and<00:05:18.750> down<00:05:19.169> or<00:05:19.470> else<00:05:19.650> it

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:19.770 
be going back up and down or else it

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:22.129 
be going back up and down or else it
will<00:05:19.830> actually<00:05:20.190> make<00:05:20.370> your<00:05:20.550> layers<00:05:21.300> kind<00:05:21.960> of

00:05:22.129 --> 00:05:22.139 
will actually make your layers kind of

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:25.249 
will actually make your layers kind of
fall<00:05:22.380> off<00:05:22.620> and<00:05:23.130> split<00:05:23.850> and<00:05:23.970> divide<00:05:24.300> so<00:05:24.780> you

00:05:25.249 --> 00:05:25.259 
fall off and split and divide so you

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:26.360 
fall off and split and divide so you
just<00:05:25.380> want<00:05:25.560> to<00:05:25.590> come<00:05:25.770> in<00:05:25.889> and<00:05:26.039> go<00:05:26.100> straight

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:26.370 
just want to come in and go straight

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:31.070 
just want to come in and go straight
down<00:05:28.250> once<00:05:29.250> you<00:05:29.370> have<00:05:29.580> all<00:05:29.789> of<00:05:29.820> the<00:05:30.060> pieces<00:05:30.360> off

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:31.080 
down once you have all of the pieces off

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:33.890 
down once you have all of the pieces off
of<00:05:31.410> there<00:05:31.590> all<00:05:31.740> the<00:05:31.889> excess<00:05:32.370> then<00:05:33.180> I<00:05:33.449> like<00:05:33.720> to

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:33.900 
of there all the excess then I like to

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:36.020 
of there all the excess then I like to
use<00:05:34.050> this<00:05:34.289> little<00:05:34.590> buffer<00:05:35.009> this<00:05:35.849> is<00:05:36.000> a

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:36.030 
use this little buffer this is a

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:38.480 
use this little buffer this is a
seven-way<00:05:36.479> buffer<00:05:36.960> you<00:05:37.830> could<00:05:37.979> probably<00:05:38.160> use

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:38.490 
seven-way buffer you could probably use

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:41.029 
seven-way buffer you could probably use
a<00:05:38.520> threeway<00:05:38.910> as<00:05:39.210> well<00:05:39.479> but<00:05:40.199> these<00:05:40.590> are<00:05:40.889> the

00:05:41.029 --> 00:05:41.039 
a threeway as well but these are the

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:43.580 
a threeway as well but these are the
ones<00:05:41.220> that<00:05:41.340> I<00:05:41.460> really<00:05:41.789> like<00:05:41.970> so<00:05:42.570> I<00:05:42.930> picked<00:05:43.380> this

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:43.590 
ones that I really like so I picked this

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:46.460 
ones that I really like so I picked this
up<00:05:43.740> at<00:05:43.860> Walmart<00:05:44.099> since<00:05:45.000> I<00:05:45.150> just<00:05:45.210> used<00:05:45.599> a<00:05:45.840> fairly

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:46.470 
up at Walmart since I just used a fairly

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:48.080 
up at Walmart since I just used a fairly
coarse<00:05:46.800> file<00:05:47.160> I'm<00:05:47.400> not<00:05:47.550> going<00:05:47.669> to<00:05:47.729> use<00:05:47.849> number

00:06:26.089 --> 00:06:26.099 
to show you how you can do it with

00:06:26.099 --> 00:06:28.370 
to show you how you can do it with
fingernail<00:06:26.729> clippers<00:06:27.120> some<00:06:27.810> people<00:06:28.080> you<00:06:28.320> know

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:28.380 
fingernail clippers some people you know

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:31.100 
fingernail clippers some people you know
if<00:06:28.560> you<00:06:28.680> have<00:06:28.860> short<00:06:29.310> nails<00:06:29.669> you<00:06:30.570> may<00:06:30.750> not<00:06:30.960> be

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:33.030 
able to use a file and so you can use a

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:36.170 
able to use a file and so you can use a
fingernail<00:06:33.449> clipper<00:06:33.870> to<00:06:34.830> trim<00:06:35.340> off<00:06:35.610> the

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:36.180 
fingernail clipper to trim off the

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:38.839 
fingernail clipper to trim off the
excess<00:06:36.630> of<00:06:36.870> your<00:06:36.990> wrap<00:06:37.259> and<00:06:37.650> then<00:06:38.400> you<00:06:38.520> can<00:06:38.699> do

00:06:38.839 --> 00:06:38.849 
excess of your wrap and then you can do

00:06:38.849 --> 00:06:40.640 
excess of your wrap and then you can do
the<00:06:39.240> seven<00:06:39.630> way<00:06:39.750> buffer<00:06:40.050> or<00:06:40.199> the<00:06:40.229> three<00:06:40.530> way

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:40.650 
the seven way buffer or the three way

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:49.629 
the seven way buffer or the three way
buffer<00:06:41.009> I<00:06:44.599> like<00:06:45.599> to<00:06:45.780> get<00:06:45.900> it<00:06:46.050> nice<00:06:46.259> and<00:06:46.340> pretty

00:06:49.629 --> 00:06:49.639 

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:52.070 

and<00:06:50.639> then<00:06:50.849> do<00:06:51.060> the<00:06:51.180> buffering<00:06:51.509> just<00:06:51.870> like<00:06:51.990> I

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:52.080 
and then do the buffering just like I

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:55.370 
and then do the buffering just like I
did<00:06:52.259> before<00:06:52.289> where<00:06:52.830> I<00:06:52.860> start<00:06:53.220> at<00:06:53.310> three<00:06:54.380> and

00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:55.380 
did before where I start at three and

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:57.529 
did before where I start at three and
still<00:06:55.680> a<00:06:55.710> three<00:06:56.039> I'm<00:06:56.130> doing<00:06:56.400> about<00:06:56.699> straight

00:06:57.529 --> 00:06:57.539 
still a three I'm doing about straight

00:06:57.539 --> 00:07:06.159 
still a three I'm doing about straight
up<00:06:57.659> and<00:06:57.810> down<00:06:57.870> and<00:06:58.289> then<00:06:59.159> we<00:06:59.940> go<00:07:00.090> to<00:07:00.120> four<00:07:02.509> five

00:07:06.159 --> 00:07:06.169 

00:07:06.169 --> 00:07:13.300 

six<00:07:08.439> and<00:07:09.439> seven<00:07:10.629> and<00:07:11.710> that's<00:07:12.710> going<00:07:13.009> to<00:07:13.159> leave

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:13.310 
six and seven and that's going to leave

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:15.459 
six and seven and that's going to leave
you<00:07:13.460> with<00:07:13.580> a<00:07:13.610> nice<00:07:13.849> smooth<00:07:14.449> edge<00:07:14.689> that's<00:07:15.289> not

00:07:15.459 --> 00:07:15.469 
you with a nice smooth edge that's not

00:07:15.469 --> 00:07:18.400 
you with a nice smooth edge that's not
gonna<00:07:15.620> do<00:07:15.800> any<00:07:15.949> lifting
