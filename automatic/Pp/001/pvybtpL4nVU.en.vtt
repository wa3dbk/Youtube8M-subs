00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 hello to all youtube friends or I am 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:08.069
 wolverine and today we will not play in the a 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:10.440
 gta 5 other things today simply 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.809
 straw in the playstation menu 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:16.139
 but I promise you that in the next videos 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:18.240
 I will do gta 5 online because it is not known 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.359
 my friends won't upload the video badly 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.970
 upload another friend of mine 

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:25.800
 then today we are here on the menu 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.500
 playstation will explain how to put it like 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.960
 sfondo this gta 5 few words this 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:35.489
 image then we go to the camera 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:37.770
 let's find ourselves then explain myself 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.840
 first of all you have to look for it on 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:42.510
 internet search there is no one else 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:46.110
 so if you can attach a usb cable 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:49.410
 to a smartphone and mobile tablet 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:55.850
 download my image to the flat in 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:59.219
 all so wrong already 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:02.670
 now let's go up after trying ct to 5 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:05.939
 years on images there are two ways though 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:09.240
 I will explain me explain all hard or 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:15.210
 been on the finger on the image made 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:17.100
 triangle file save image and scale 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.400
 will automatically download it will put us 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:23.430
 really little guys look like me type 10 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:26.490
 seconds also put less let's go on photo 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.890
 and we will find it here but as you see it does 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.409
 sucks so really grainy guy 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.049
 so let's go and eliminate it because not 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:38.090
 it will be absolutely not seen 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.090
 as a background then what we should do 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:46.280
 Meanwhile we wait for you to come back 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:46.280
 ok then we always go on the internet 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:59.820
 5 always on the internet because it's ok then 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:02.220
 let's go on images always the same 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.649
 what guys and instead of crushing i 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:07.200
 file all with triangle we click 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:10.890
 above it is written in green it will be written 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.570
 the site we are going to go to but we are not there 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.269
 nothing matters because we care 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:16.500
 only that there is an image like 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:20.160
 this 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:24.000
 Here we will do the same thing because it makes 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:26.730
 being in a page the playstation does not 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:31.560
 load the whole page but load those 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:36.530
 inaccurate images ok then let's go up 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:39.600
 photo and as you see 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:46.230
 let's say it's not one of the best 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:47.790
 he already tried very well already for and for it 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.160
 you can set as background but already this 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.690
 I don't like it because it's too grainy but 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.410
 as you can see this is less grainy than 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.410
 all the others 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:01.620
 this is where I downloaded it from 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:06.570
 always from the things of gta 5 enough that you 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:09.600
 look for gta 5 then all over 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:14.000
 just go on the internet to look for it then 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.000
 I downloaded this from 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:21.050
 this was just always unloaded with the 

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:26.370
 the first method was really bad 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:27.000
 example if i want to download this here 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.750
 which is better 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:37.520
 I do it that will always put me up 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:37.520
 this site of gta 5 at birth 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:48.829
 you know this about this new minister 

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:51.939
 gta 5 to 0 site I know that here, however, the 

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:55.489
 photo indeed there is perhaps this you know 

00:03:51.939 --> 00:03:57.250
 this video is different but it seems to me 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:59.659
 no because it seems strange to me 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:02.209
 ok guys we made a fool 

00:03:59.659 --> 00:04:03.709
 because some sites just don't make you 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:10.000
 go to the right page for example 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:14.269
 this is pretty cool like what 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:18.500
 diary of the first se with gta 5 c 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:21.530
 expect here above it seems that 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:23.870
 should upload the image if it is not there 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:25.550
 the charge is under charge because 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:28.340
 as you can see I'm still loading 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:31.120
 anyway but now that it takes so much 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:37.820
 it's just that the wifi is near 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:40.310
 so we summarize everything for two 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:43.669
 ways to download them you can take the 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:47.060
 so grainy or go this 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:51.020
 guys is really cool like a photo 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:54.310
 anyway then how do we do this not 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:56.930
 I saw it then we always go to file 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:59.810
 which does not tell us unless image for 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:02.659
 who the hell will be will be under the image 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:04.340
 perhaps for example this yes this tower 

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:07.669
 see it save image 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:11.770
 this is where he tells us you know why 

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:11.770
 maybe that's a cover image 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:18.409
 and now I'll explain why the bike doesn't 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:20.930
 understands that as we do then we do 

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:24.020
 let's always take the image on a photo 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:26.360
 we have downloaded that will be no less 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:29.960
 grainy we go to the panel of 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:34.840
 background check and now I'll explain how 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:34.840
 then we'll have to work a little bit 

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:39.450
 then 

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:46.950
 It's a bit difficult 

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:51.719
 now we must not be there 

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:58.010
 9 however this kidneys less because not 

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:59.600
 I like it a lot but it's you anyway 

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:03.020
 understood how guys do this was one 

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:06.050
 video say introduction is very beautiful 

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:09.230
 however as a screen as a video I have 

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:12.830
 done because nothing is just beautiful from 

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:14.990
 do to enrich the playstation a little 

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:15.830
 if this video is liked put a 

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:19.540
 pleasure 

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:21.650
 subscribe to the davide lentini e 

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:23.630

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:27.670
