00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:43.730 
here is the reason why you cut it flat
in<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.359> first<00:01:42.569> place<00:01:42.779> oh<00:01:42.959> it<00:01:43.109> will<00:01:43.259> stand<00:01:43.560> up

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
in the first place oh it will stand up

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.739 
in the first place oh it will stand up
on<00:01:43.889> a<00:01:43.950> fruit<00:01:44.279> board<00:01:44.549> and<00:01:44.759> a<00:01:45.149> good<00:01:45.420> test<00:01:45.689> for

00:01:45.739 --> 00:01:45.749 
on a fruit board and a good test for

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:46.849 
on a fruit board and a good test for
that<00:01:45.959> is<00:01:46.079> you<00:01:46.170> want<00:01:46.319> to<00:01:46.349> just<00:01:46.409> go<00:01:46.649> ahead<00:01:46.679> and

00:01:46.849 --> 00:01:46.859 
that is you want to just go ahead and

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:49.999 
that is you want to just go ahead and
fan<00:01:47.819> out<00:01:48.060> your<00:01:48.299> pineapple<00:01:48.899> strips<00:01:49.200> as<00:01:49.439> shown

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
fan out your pineapple strips as shown

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.129 
fan out your pineapple strips as shown
here<00:01:50.549> and<00:01:50.700> if<00:01:51.329> they<00:01:51.450> can<00:01:51.599> stand<00:01:51.869> up<00:01:52.079> by

00:01:52.129 --> 00:01:52.139 
here and if they can stand up by

00:01:52.139 --> 00:01:53.629 
here and if they can stand up by
themselves<00:01:52.439> then<00:01:53.009> you<00:01:53.099> know<00:01:53.249> that<00:01:53.429> you<00:01:53.490> have
