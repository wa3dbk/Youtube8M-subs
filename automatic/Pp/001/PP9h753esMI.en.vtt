okay<00:00:28.400> we<00:00:28.550> have<00:00:28.640> the<00:00:28.699> Canon<00:00:29.119> 7d<00:00:29.330> here<00:00:29.869> we're

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:30.410 
okay we have the Canon 7d here we're

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:32.109 
okay we have the Canon 7d here we're
gonna<00:00:30.500> be<00:00:30.619> setting<00:00:30.949> this<00:00:31.039> up<00:00:31.100> on<00:00:31.580> the<00:00:31.880> glide

00:00:32.109 --> 00:00:32.119 
gonna be setting this up on the glide

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:35.470 
gonna be setting this up on the glide
cam<00:00:32.360> HD<00:00:32.809> mm<00:00:33.500> so<00:00:34.370> what<00:00:34.550> we've<00:00:34.699> determined<00:00:34.910> is

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:35.480 
cam HD mm so what we've determined is

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.750 
cam HD mm so what we've determined is
that<00:00:35.720> the<00:00:35.809> cameras<00:00:36.170> center<00:00:36.470> of<00:00:36.559> gravity<00:00:37.010> is

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:37.760 
that the cameras center of gravity is

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:38.920 
that the cameras center of gravity is
pretty<00:00:38.090> much<00:00:38.210> right<00:00:38.420> in<00:00:38.449> the<00:00:38.570> middle<00:00:38.750> between

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:38.930 
pretty much right in the middle between

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:40.810 
pretty much right in the middle between
the<00:00:39.199> lens<00:00:39.410> and<00:00:39.620> the<00:00:39.890> housing<00:00:39.920> for<00:00:40.340> the<00:00:40.430> camera

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:40.820 
the lens and the housing for the camera

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.470 
the lens and the housing for the camera
let's<00:00:41.360> give<00:00:41.510> it<00:00:41.570> a<00:00:41.660> shot

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:43.480 
let's give it a shot

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.790 
let's give it a shot
first<00:00:44.480> we<00:00:44.630> take<00:00:44.840> off<00:00:45.020> the<00:00:45.050> camera<00:00:45.500> mounting

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:45.800 
first we take off the camera mounting

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.020 
first we take off the camera mounting
plate<00:00:46.510> we<00:00:47.510> position<00:00:48.020> the<00:00:48.140> plate<00:00:48.879> so<00:00:49.879> the

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
plate we position the plate so the

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:51.670 
plate we position the plate so the
center<00:00:50.390> of<00:00:50.480> the<00:00:50.600> camera<00:00:51.020> is<00:00:51.110> lining<00:00:51.530> up<00:00:51.649> with

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:51.680 
center of the camera is lining up with

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.270 
center of the camera is lining up with
the<00:00:51.890> center<00:00:52.219> of<00:00:52.309> the<00:00:52.370> plate<00:00:53.710> next<00:00:54.710> step<00:00:54.980> is<00:00:55.160> we

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:55.280 
the center of the plate next step is we

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:56.920 
the center of the plate next step is we
want<00:00:55.340> to<00:00:55.550> take<00:00:55.700> the<00:00:55.820> camera<00:00:56.059> mounting<00:00:56.570> screw

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
of the glide cam HD mm let's do it we

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.920 
of the glide cam HD mm let's do it we
fit<00:01:16.159> the<00:01:16.310> top<00:01:16.490> plate<00:01:16.790> on

lock<00:01:20.620> the<00:01:20.650> knobs

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.340 

and<00:01:24.150> then<00:01:24.270> fasten<00:01:24.750> them<00:01:24.840> to<00:01:24.960> make<00:01:25.140> sure<00:01:25.170> that

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
and then fasten them to make sure that

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.820 
and then fasten them to make sure that
they<00:01:25.620> secure<00:01:27.050> now<00:01:28.050> that<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.380> camera<00:01:28.770> is

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:28.830 
they secure now that the camera is

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.640 
they secure now that the camera is
securely<00:01:29.220> attached<00:01:29.760> to<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.150> glidecam<00:01:30.570> HC<00:01:30.930> mm

securely attached to the glidecam HC mm

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.620 
securely attached to the glidecam HC mm
the<00:01:32.310> next<00:01:32.430> thing<00:01:32.670> we<00:01:32.760> want<00:01:32.940> to<00:01:33.030> take<00:01:33.150> a<00:01:33.180> look<00:01:33.450> at

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
the next thing we want to take a look at

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.140 
the next thing we want to take a look at
is<00:01:34.050> the<00:01:34.290> horizontal<00:01:34.680> balance<00:01:35.430> so<00:01:35.970> we're<00:01:36.060> gonna

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
is the horizontal balance so we're gonna

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.730 
is the horizontal balance so we're gonna
pick<00:01:36.360> it<00:01:36.420> up<00:01:36.630> off<00:01:36.780> the<00:01:36.810> docking<00:01:37.350> bracket<00:01:39.740> using

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
pick it up off the docking bracket using

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.499 
pick it up off the docking bracket using
the<00:01:40.800> foam<00:01:41.040> grip<00:01:41.340> on<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.610> handle<00:01:41.940> we<00:01:42.119> lift<00:01:42.390> it

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
the foam grip on the handle we lift it

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.969 
the foam grip on the handle we lift it
up<00:01:42.660> off<00:01:42.900> the<00:01:42.960> docking<00:01:43.560> bracket<00:01:45.650> it<00:01:46.650> actually

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
up off the docking bracket it actually

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.070 
up off the docking bracket it actually
appears<00:01:47.280> to<00:01:47.400> be<00:01:47.520> pretty<00:01:47.700> level<00:01:48.119> so<00:01:48.690> we<00:01:48.840> don't

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:49.080 
appears to be pretty level so we don't

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.560 
appears to be pretty level so we don't
need<00:01:49.259> to<00:01:49.409> make<00:01:49.560> much<00:01:49.770> adjustment<00:01:50.330> however<00:01:51.330> if

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
need to make much adjustment however if

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.920 
need to make much adjustment however if
we<00:01:51.780> did<00:01:52.080> what<00:01:52.650> we<00:01:52.800> would<00:01:52.920> do<00:01:53.100> is<00:01:53.750> we<00:01:54.750> would<00:01:54.780> use

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
we did what we would do is we would use

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.770 
we did what we would do is we would use
this<00:01:55.320> knob<00:01:55.500> here<00:01:55.880> to<00:01:56.880> adjust<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.390> front<00:01:57.660> to

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
this knob here to adjust the front to

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.290 
this knob here to adjust the front to
back<00:01:57.960> by<00:01:58.740> either<00:01:59.009> turning<00:01:59.220> it<00:01:59.399> clockwise<00:01:59.550> or

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:00.300 
back by either turning it clockwise or

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.320 
back by either turning it clockwise or
counterclockwise<00:02:01.009> to<00:02:02.009> either<00:02:02.220> advance<00:02:02.520> the

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:03.330 
counterclockwise to either advance the

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
backward so the side-to-side this

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:12.710 
backward so the side-to-side this
particular<00:02:10.709> knob<00:02:11.070> can<00:02:11.310> be<00:02:11.430> used<00:02:11.670> to<00:02:12.360> adjust

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
particular knob can be used to adjust

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.470 
particular knob can be used to adjust
the<00:02:12.780> cameras<00:02:13.230> center<00:02:13.769> of<00:02:13.890> gravity

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
the cameras center of gravity

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.410 
the cameras center of gravity
horizontally<00:02:15.480> to<00:02:15.720> the<00:02:15.810> left<00:02:16.050> or<00:02:16.650> to<00:02:17.010> the<00:02:17.040> right

horizontally to the left or to the right
and<00:02:18.420> as<00:02:18.810> we<00:02:18.989> just<00:02:19.019> determined<00:02:19.800> it's<00:02:19.920> pretty

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
and as we just determined it's pretty

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.420 
and as we just determined it's pretty
well<00:02:20.340> level<00:02:21.260> and<00:02:22.260> no<00:02:22.440> adjustments<00:02:23.010> needed<00:02:23.250> at

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
well level and no adjustments needed at

what<00:03:16.459> you<00:03:16.610> need<00:03:16.760> to<00:03:16.880> do<00:03:17.000> is<00:03:17.120> you<00:03:17.239> need<00:03:17.360> to<00:03:17.420> add

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
what you need to do is you need to add

what you need to do is you need to add
counterweight<00:03:21.430> this<00:03:22.430> particular

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:25.840 
counterweight this particular
counterweight<00:03:23.630> design<00:03:24.459> fits<00:03:25.459> right<00:03:25.640> on<00:03:25.760> the

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850 
counterweight design fits right on the

counterweight design fits right on the
base<00:03:26.030> platform<00:03:26.300> would<00:03:27.200> simply<00:03:27.650> remove<00:03:27.980> these

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
base platform would simply remove these

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:32.290 
base platform would simply remove these
knobs<00:03:28.430> and<00:03:29.739> place<00:03:30.739> the<00:03:31.250> counterweight<00:03:31.790> on<00:03:32.000> top

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:32.300 
knobs and place the counterweight on top

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.509 
knobs and place the counterweight on top
in<00:03:32.569> even<00:03:33.050> increments<00:03:33.560> it's<00:03:34.160> all<00:03:34.280> about

00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:34.519 
in even increments it's all about

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:36.940 
in even increments it's all about
symmetry<00:03:35.120> so<00:03:35.810> we<00:03:35.900> want<00:03:36.140> one<00:03:36.410> weight<00:03:36.650> on<00:03:36.800> each

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
symmetry so we want one weight on each

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:42.190 
symmetry so we want one weight on each
side<00:03:37.220> 2<00:03:38.120> 4<00:03:38.750> 6<00:03:39.290> etc<00:03:40.090> so<00:03:41.090> if<00:03:41.209> we<00:03:41.390> can't<00:03:41.630> telescope

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
side 2 4 6 etc so if we can't telescope

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.059 
side 2 4 6 etc so if we can't telescope
this<00:03:42.350> out<00:03:42.530> anymore<00:03:42.950> to<00:03:43.190> increase<00:03:44.030> that<00:03:44.239> drop

00:03:45.059 --> 00:03:45.069 
this out anymore to increase that drop

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:49.750 
this out anymore to increase that drop
we<00:03:46.069> add<00:03:46.250> more<00:03:46.549> weight<00:03:47.080> simply<00:03:48.080> pick<00:03:48.530> the<00:03:48.680> HT<00:03:49.069> mm

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
we add more weight simply pick the HT mm

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.390 
we add more weight simply pick the HT mm
