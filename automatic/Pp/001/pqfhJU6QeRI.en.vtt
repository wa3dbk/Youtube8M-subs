 They want to see your face is to 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.569
 end of this video since since almost 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:51.300

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:52.950

 you want to see vegetar and paracas we have 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.610
 more trees actually is to say 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.890
 focus more on what mountains are 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:02.819
 they are really huge see this mountain 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:05.069
 it is also very very giant and good here 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:07.769
 we have a very flat very flat area for 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:10.290
 build if they like to build and for 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:12.450
 this part I think it's the back 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:15.060
 I do not know which part would be we have a biome 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.799
 of really extensive snow see how much 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:20.220
 snow is here for millions and millions 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:21.750
 of snowballs and good meiners I think 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.130
 that this would be everything I hope there 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.569

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:26.310
 subscribe and share networks 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:29.160
 remember that the goal is now 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.450
 two link meiners and there is no stop or that 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.549
 there is no deadline to get to that 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.430
 goal then I guess it would be a bit 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:36.579
 less pressure 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:38.019

 bring them two daily videos or a video 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.959

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:46.180
 time and please do not spam guys 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:48.329

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:51.519
 nobody would like to use their videos 

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:54.549

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:56.739
