00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.150
 would have to come together for a new 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.919
 video is today we find ourselves 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.840
 for the very first video of the 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.780
 Androgenic chain so the 100% chain 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.610
 android so you really brakes a 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.320
 presentation video sorry for 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.150

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.060
 upcoming projects on the channel so there 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.920
 today we talked about the Roma 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.170
 that I have to introduce you right away 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.170
 on the glacier so it's rome it's a 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.490
 4.4 dress that I found on isere 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.410
 developers will put you online a 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.759
 teaser mandarom if you want it so 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.100
 if we are based on stage I have two 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.660
 words of 11 essays in rome in 4.4 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.280
 so I think it's like enough 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.899
 pleasant to see a Roma investigation points 4 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.250
 for a galaxy is to be like 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.350
 three years I remember it or bronze 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.350
 a galaxy ace have been updated 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.760
 2.2 is experiencing saranais it laguait lm 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.070
 we find it is much more fluid 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.989
 and it's but it's much better but 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.789
 if I use these games anymore for going 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.379
 present us to prove to you that 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:01:00.600
 it's really a dress 14.2 I showed 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:07.110
 in the settings about the 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:10.380
 phone here is android version 4 - 4 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.850
 no number ten models gts 5130 for 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.549
 cover some guys is done for that 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.890
 you did not believe so here I showed the 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.560
 any little history be a 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.330
 times Hungary 4 what is it then 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.380
 really not bad at all so it's based 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.850
 on scene embarrassment so we still 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.180
 full of nice little options 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.850
 without needing the application that 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.020
 make tweaks or for example by 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.799
 the amp a few small bugs for 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.570
 the moment because it's still a 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.119
 experimental version not even yet 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.560
 unia who by cons if we want there is the 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.670
 netiquette by three but mons and allows 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.460
 to have the frame in question are crazy 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.500
 and ben and some small talking bugs 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.240
 when did you have that talent exposed 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.250
 installer so for those who know 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.350
 it's not an application that you 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.210
 allows to make lots of little ones 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.750
 advanced customization on your on 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.259
 your phone 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:57.240
 frankly it's really not bad except 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.369
 that when you set up the low walk 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.360
 may it be such a bug so maybe it's 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.610
 because it is still rising very 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.250
 experimental but it's not so serious 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.840
 that that's it I'm trying on our values 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.369
 that's why I move like that but 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.569
 it's exactly the same thing for 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.940
 to leave without the run is the same thing 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.450
 that we do not move like that, so here it 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.459
 ya c 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.170
 loc so it's really not bad at all 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:19.680
 at least with the reasons that worried me 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.879
 we can have wants to have all the 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.470
 obligations that are not compatible 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:24.750
 so usually confess I had been 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.000
 loaded gravity purse that break from my 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.069
 foot here it does not eat but my 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.120
 otherwise it's a little here I swear 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:35.190
 that after the camera and the like 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:38.610
 it's not being millicom ruts in 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.209
 the gas versions 4 there you see so 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.590
 he is not bad 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:42.870
 so afterwards there is no 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.630
 fashion for now that they are who are going 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:48.120
 increase and pix mc by importing beaumont 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.709

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.880
 hours stumble so you can funds can 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:53.250
 do a lot of stuff filled the price 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.150
 we can change without having to have 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.700
 applications what I told you 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.410
