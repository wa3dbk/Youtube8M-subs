00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
are a decent sized brake it's hard to

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.880 
are a decent sized brake it's hard to
see<00:02:54.820> with<00:02:55.030> this<00:02:55.150> one<00:02:55.209> in<00:02:55.510> the<00:02:56.290> condition<00:02:56.770> it's

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
see with this one in the condition it's

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:00.330 
see with this one in the condition it's
in<00:02:57.040> now<00:02:57.420> but<00:02:58.420> in<00:02:58.720> overall<00:02:58.890> well<00:02:59.890> yeah<00:03:00.010> this<00:03:00.190> one

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
in now but in overall well yeah this one

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:01.650 
in now but in overall well yeah this one
actually<00:03:00.520> has<00:03:00.880> the<00:03:01.060> electronic<00:03:01.510> suspension

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
actually has the electronic suspension

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.930 
actually has the electronic suspension
too<00:03:02.230> so<00:03:02.890> you<00:03:02.950> could<00:03:03.160> actually<00:03:03.310> choose<00:03:03.670> between

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
too so you could actually choose between

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:08.180 
too so you could actually choose between
hard<00:03:04.720> and<00:03:04.930> soft<00:03:05.020> on<00:03:05.980> the<00:03:06.130> suspension<00:03:06.670> as<00:03:06.790> such

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
hard and soft on the suspension as such

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.410 
hard and soft on the suspension as such
of<00:03:09.190> course<00:03:09.250> like<00:03:09.580> I<00:03:09.670> said<00:03:09.700> dance<00:03:10.060> started

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:25.949 
the week after it got panel beaded and
the<00:03:23.800> week<00:03:23.950> before<00:03:24.160> I<00:03:24.370> was<00:03:24.580> going<00:03:24.760> in<00:03:25.030> for<00:03:25.209> paint

a Land Cruiser hit it in the arse end

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.620 
a Land Cruiser hit it in the arse end
that's<00:03:28.480> why<00:03:28.630> it's<00:03:28.840> all<00:03:28.930> bent<00:03:29.200> up<00:03:29.380> and

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
that's why it's all bent up and

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.270 
that's why it's all bent up and
unfortunately<00:03:31.630> it<00:03:32.230> has<00:03:32.380> actually<00:03:32.739> kinked<00:03:33.100> the

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
unfortunately it has actually kinked the

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.699 
unfortunately it has actually kinked the
floor<00:03:33.750> one<00:03:34.750> of<00:03:34.870> the<00:03:34.930> rails<00:03:35.140> I<00:03:35.290> can't<00:03:35.500> remember

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:35.709 
floor one of the rails I can't remember

floor one of the rails I can't remember
where<00:03:35.980> it<00:03:36.100> was<00:03:36.130> but<00:03:36.480> my<00:03:37.480> brother<00:03:37.690> found<00:03:37.959> it

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
where it was but my brother found it

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:39.720 
where it was but my brother found it
it's<00:03:38.410> actually<00:03:38.769> kinked<00:03:39.100> the<00:03:39.190> floor<00:03:39.400> slightly

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
it's actually kinked the floor slightly

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.150 
it's actually kinked the floor slightly
saw<00:03:40.090> it<00:03:40.180> actually<00:03:40.540> pretty<00:03:41.380> much<00:03:41.470> twisted<00:03:42.040> the

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160 
saw it actually pretty much twisted the

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.000 
saw it actually pretty much twisted the
whole<00:03:42.190> car<00:03:42.610> in<00:03:42.850> that<00:03:42.940> incident<00:03:43.680> even<00:03:44.680> though

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
whole car in that incident even though

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.070 
whole car in that incident even though
you<00:03:45.070> can't<00:03:45.489> really<00:03:45.700> tell<00:03:46.360> from<00:03:46.600> the<00:03:46.810> front

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:47.080 
you can't really tell from the front

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.490 
you can't really tell from the front
here<00:03:48.299> underneath<00:03:49.299> you<00:03:49.540> can<00:03:49.810> it<00:03:50.049> does<00:03:50.230> look<00:03:50.440> a

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
here underneath you can it does look a

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.199
