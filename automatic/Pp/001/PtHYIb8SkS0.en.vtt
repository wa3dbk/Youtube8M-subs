00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:08.840
 I'm doing 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:12.320
 thinks dufermont first he believes 

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:14.090
 in 1987 I have not missed a lot since 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:18.500
 I knew a lot were co-pilot of 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:22.390
 renÃ© de lost I made an edition in 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:26.260
 the famous but arid championship and 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:28.390
 for two years I have 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:29.830
 I ride with my car so it's 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.960
 you have to see everyone the 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:32.970
 knows it's the smallest car of the 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.140
 rally 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:37.660
 it's a small challenge the pilot is 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:43.230
 a bit beefy so the car is everything 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:43.230
 it was suzuki jimny 13.5 cm cube 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.470
 here we do not do a lot of show 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.330
 we are not going very fast but we have 85 horses 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:52.830
 we do what we can we are at the maximum 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:52.830
 of the car of the pestle 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.739
 the goal is of course the summit of 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.879
 the madeleine Sunday night then the 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:06.890
 top of the madeleine we did it 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:08.090
 last year it's a whole 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.850
 story my pot it's actually it's a 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.890
 little my co-driver who brought me to 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.030
 pick up a car the first time 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.940
 I took them to see the rally of 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:19.550
 he was a journalist photographer 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:21.320
 of the automotive press and the proof at the 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.450
 game bring them to a rally all 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.640
 interest decimate and after the 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.050
 first special he told me it's 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.390
 bartenders but it's bartenders 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.950
 fantastic and since he came back to 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.990
 all rallies is the year of the years 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.550
 he told me is sometimes therefore supported 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.210
 I had to rent a car the secret me 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.880
 never be able 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:42.530
 so we will buy this car 5000 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:44.300
 euros in Spain and we did the rally 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.500
 and when we are the goal the year 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.570
 last it was due to raise the 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.009
 madeleine sets his dream and the year 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.960
 last when we got to the top 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:53.810
 from the madeleine 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.220
 the first thought that made me in 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.229
 the car the pressure I heard 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:00.229
 in the radio this is now I 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:02.330
 be part of the barges here is a 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:06.200
 nice conclusion thanks thank you very much and 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:07.460
 so go on the tracks of the 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.959
 summit rally maybe you 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.090
 do not see me because you passed 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:12.739
 so fast that but I will be on 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.700
 the edge as in all cases no but 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:15.700
 I'll have time to see me 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:27.079
 yeah that's because we 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:27.079
 in fact no 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:37.370
 and here I am the smallest car 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:39.790
 rally is the smallest car 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.630
 of the rally 13 cubic centimeters 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.170
 entirely original entirely 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.240
 original 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.190
 there are four ohlins dampers that 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.720
 that's all yes and have managed to put 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.120
 safety equipment for example 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:52.100
 the arches inside had looked 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.480
 by 3 meters it just goes and it's 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.050
 especially the pilot after two strokes who 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.510
 is following me 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:03:01.880
 but finally get ready sophie bot super 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:04.400
 so he is a co-pilot who is happy 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.690
 now to be part of the crazy 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.210
 furious I remember most of 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:12.170
 the expression he used burries 

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:14.240
 Barrels it's paschal it's a bit 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.620
 him who revived me in I stopped 

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:19.070
 a little bit of running and it's him who 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:21.290
 mark that revived me and this said between 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:22.280
 we did well it did well 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.470

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:35.990
 smaller lap the goal of the game if you 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.430
 want me to see you that I took for 

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:39.290
 me when I was a kid I dreamed of 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:39.680
 acting up today do 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:41.780
 summits 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.590
 you have cars that are worth a hundred 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.480
 fifty 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:48.140
 they have all the kids they are afraid that 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:50.480
 I will never be able to 1000 euros 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:54.010
 we will make 60 liters of gasoline in the 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:56.480
 weekend giving back the possibility 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:58.430
 so it's possible the summit rally 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.349

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:02.680
 with 68.3 of the elders it is for this 

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:02.680

 French convention here the cabbages is 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.280

 true 

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:55.300

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:58.080
 yeah I saw this is a job not 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:06:01.260
 assistance and the car 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:01.260
 it's good 

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:16.500

 yes it's the joy tonight that's it 

00:06:45.389 --> 00:06:51.060
 we're going to have to go 

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:52.529
 it was very hard I think you would have 

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:55.409
 many my life the one I did I 

00:06:52.529 --> 00:06:56.219
 think but some but sees the 

00:06:55.409 --> 00:07:00.050
 dividend 

00:06:56.219 --> 00:07:00.050
 we learn advanced techniques 

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:05.140
 work but less expensive for my and 

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:06.520
 Gold finished second euros for 

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:08.259
 breakages 

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:11.259
 nothing asked either happiness 

00:07:08.259 --> 00:07:13.840
 for the co-pilot too I guess 

00:07:11.259 --> 00:07:15.879
 obviously disappointed in already being on arrival 

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:18.250
 de simon but that's between second 

00:07:15.879 --> 00:07:20.740
 sim with denis of forney on arrival 

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:24.460
 to ride with a boy as a denial of a 

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:26.530
 such kindness is something 

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:28.120
 of extraordinary and then it's true that 

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:30.280
 it was very very hard we did a lot of trouble 

00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:31.750
 both this weekend for the tib 

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:33.729
 the mechanics big thanks to the mechanics 

00:07:31.750 --> 00:07:38.199
 goes on like this under debates is there 

00:07:33.729 --> 00:07:40.569
 a year past a few kilos family that's 

00:07:38.199 --> 00:07:42.849
 awesome I remembered is the cactus 

00:07:40.569 --> 00:07:45.520
 more beautiful and the following now to read 

00:07:42.849 --> 00:07:48.370
 then we have a big challenge there in a 

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:50.289
 month since in fact one drives a blow 

00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:51.880
 not reported even roy tecan and before 

00:07:50.289 --> 00:07:54.490
 young targets with a point of advance on 

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:55.870
 him at the championship so we made 2nd of 

00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:58.600
 jump profits 

00:07:55.870 --> 00:08:00.430
 it will start and what we need moore 

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:04.480
 that we need to go before at 

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:05.830
 championship we will try but good 

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:06.190
 I would be surprised if the student passed the 

00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:10.060
 master 

00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:12.690
 to put cabbage here is when 

00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:12.690
 necessarily the goal
