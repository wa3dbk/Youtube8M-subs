00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.690
 so let's go now that her breasts percent and speed 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.930
 surely not but by the end of each 

00:00:11.499 --> 00:00:12.609
 so 

00:00:12.609 --> 00:00:14.069
 10 

00:00:14.069 --> 00:00:16.650
 we take the volume of gas 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.119
 as it is now certain time 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:21.200
 this virus 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.200
 and sure the chairlift sense 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:27.090
 so 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.839
 we will test it 

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:31.839
 the same site at the same time 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.250
 for him something new for orange reminds that one is strangled six 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.060
 hours on the same network so iran 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:49.240
 then the sense where we seem 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.520
 have taken the advantage is ensuivie phone 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:55.130
 he threw his actions 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:58.120
 that's what it is for the browser then 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.600
 watching the pepper criticize him on both fronts 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.810
 as for the Spartans not I have completely finished changing some 

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:07.810
 slowdowns but it stays fluid enough 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.470
 on the iphone 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.410
 is that for two years 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:14.420
 even the very powerful 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.220
 and on the site here 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:21.180
 leaks the missing pvs better i find this maybe hard percent at the 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.180
 size of the screen that really has navigation by hand 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.610
 enthusiasts focused on a small slowdown compared to 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.440
 issues compared to others in addition a month 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.810
 an article 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.810
 on France 2 6 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.240
 since then we recognize what is fast enough for me it is not far 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.430
 percent after these allegations 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:54.110
 emmanuel small midfielder slight slowdown compared compared 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:55.950
 to other phones 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.640
 but it remains five other writers elmar brok I think the best the 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.160
 collectivity 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.720
 percentage of those who return to the screen for its part the great means 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.920
 for internet browsing etc 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:07.859
 % 

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:10.859
 they will not appear on the phone 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:15.659
 that's what it is for the time internet browsing 

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:18.879
 so the more we will now spend percent the system itself
