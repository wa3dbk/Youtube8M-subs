basically what I like to do is call the

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:15.060 
basically what I like to do is call the
stick<00:00:13.059> concept<00:00:13.870> out<00:00:14.080> of<00:00:14.170> the<00:00:14.259> gun<00:00:14.440> snugs<00:00:14.830> and

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:15.070 
stick concept out of the gun snugs and

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:16.800 
stick concept out of the gun snugs and
use<00:00:15.219> this<00:00:15.460> now<00:00:15.940> also<00:00:16.150> use<00:00:16.419> this<00:00:16.540> out<00:00:16.689> of<00:00:16.750> the

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:16.810 
use this now also use this out of the

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:18.900 
use this now also use this out of the
gun<00:00:16.990> snugs<00:00:17.349> flip<00:00:17.650> out<00:00:17.830> of<00:00:17.860> this<00:00:17.980> Patriots

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:18.910 
gun snugs flip out of this Patriots

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:21.090 
gun snugs flip out of this Patriots
playbook<00:00:19.300> so<00:00:19.750> it's<00:00:19.900> ran<00:00:20.080> similar<00:00:20.470> but<00:00:21.039> a

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:21.100 
playbook so it's ran similar but a

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:22.529 
playbook so it's ran similar but a
little<00:00:21.310> bit<00:00:21.400> different<00:00:21.699> because<00:00:21.789> the<00:00:22.150> outside

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:22.539 
little bit different because the outside

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:24.210 
little bit different because the outside
receivers<00:00:22.960> actually<00:00:23.260> run<00:00:23.439> this<00:00:23.590> on<00:00:23.800> flat

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:24.220 
receivers actually run this on flat

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.310 
receivers actually run this on flat
routes<00:00:24.460> and<00:00:24.730> the<00:00:25.090> inside<00:00:25.390> receivers<00:00:25.990> run<00:00:26.170> the

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:26.320 
routes and the inside receivers run the

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:27.689 
routes and the inside receivers run the
stick<00:00:26.529> routes<00:00:26.769> when<00:00:27.220> running<00:00:27.369> down<00:00:27.580> the

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:27.699 
stick routes when running down the

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:29.250 
stick routes when running down the
stillers<00:00:28.060> playbook<00:00:28.420> out<00:00:28.570> of<00:00:28.660> the<00:00:28.720> snugs<00:00:28.960> out

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:29.260 
stillers playbook out of the snugs out

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:30.990 
stillers playbook out of the snugs out
of<00:00:29.619> the<00:00:29.679> snugs<00:00:29.980> flip<00:00:30.310> it's<00:00:30.550> the<00:00:30.670> inside

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:31.000 
of the snugs flip it's the inside

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.700 
of the snugs flip it's the inside
receivers<00:00:31.420> that<00:00:31.539> run<00:00:31.720> the<00:00:31.840> flats<00:00:32.110> while<00:00:32.559> the

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:32.710 
receivers that run the flats while the

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:34.680 
receivers that run the flats while the
outside<00:00:33.070> receivers<00:00:33.460> run<00:00:33.610> the<00:00:33.730> stick<00:00:34.000> but<00:00:34.600> you

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:34.690 
outside receivers run the stick but you

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:36.000 
outside receivers run the stick but you
can<00:00:34.809> pretty<00:00:34.930> much<00:00:35.019> run<00:00:35.290> this<00:00:35.379> concept<00:00:35.920> the

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.010 
can pretty much run this concept the

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:37.619 
can pretty much run this concept the
same<00:00:36.220> way<00:00:36.430> I'm<00:00:36.760> going<00:00:37.059> to<00:00:37.149> show<00:00:37.270> it<00:00:37.390> against

00:00:37.619 --> 00:00:37.629 
same way I'm going to show it against

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:40.080 
same way I'm going to show it against
nickel<00:00:38.110> 335<00:00:38.680> cover<00:00:38.980> 3<00:00:39.250> because<00:00:39.489> actually<00:00:39.969> when

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:40.090 
nickel 335 cover 3 because actually when

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:41.220 
nickel 335 cover 3 because actually when
I<00:00:40.120> came<00:00:40.239> up<00:00:40.510> with<00:00:40.540> a<00:00:40.629> horizontal<00:00:41.140> stretch

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:41.230 
I came up with a horizontal stretch

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.049 
I came up with a horizontal stretch
concept<00:00:41.950> this<00:00:42.340> was<00:00:42.489> the<00:00:42.520> defense<00:00:42.940> I<00:00:43.030> was

00:00:43.049 --> 00:00:43.059 
concept this was the defense I was

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:44.670 
concept this was the defense I was
looking<00:00:43.390> to<00:00:43.480> beat<00:00:43.660> and<00:00:43.870> this<00:00:44.320> is<00:00:44.440> how<00:00:44.530> I<00:00:44.559> came

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:44.680 
looking to beat and this is how I came

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.119 
looking to beat and this is how I came
up<00:00:44.829> with<00:00:45.010> it<00:00:45.280> so<00:00:45.789> basically<00:00:46.320> now<00:00:47.320> if<00:00:47.739> you<00:00:47.920> ruin

00:00:48.119 --> 00:00:48.129 
up with it so basically now if you ruin

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:50.220 
up with it so basically now if you ruin
this<00:00:48.190> play<00:00:48.520> as<00:00:48.789> is<00:00:49.300> right<00:00:49.510> now<00:00:49.660> you<00:00:49.719> can<00:00:49.930> run<00:00:50.079> it

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:50.230 
this play as is right now you can run it

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:51.900 
this play as is right now you can run it
the<00:00:50.410> thing<00:00:50.620> is<00:00:50.649> you<00:00:51.370> got<00:00:51.489> to<00:00:51.520> watch<00:00:51.760> the

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:51.910 
the thing is you got to watch the

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.150 
the thing is you got to watch the
defense<00:00:52.270> if<00:00:52.690> the<00:00:52.899> defense<00:00:53.320> is<00:00:53.530> playing<00:00:53.710> like<00:00:54.100> a

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:54.160 
defense if the defense is playing like a

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.760 
defense if the defense is playing like a
nickel<00:00:54.789> dollar<00:00:55.210> normal<00:00:55.690> whatever<00:00:55.840> if<00:00:56.469> they

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:56.770 
nickel dollar normal whatever if they

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:59.310 
nickel dollar normal whatever if they
call<00:00:57.010> and<00:00:57.219> cover<00:00:57.430> three<00:00:57.850> those<00:00:58.780> two<00:00:58.989> inside

00:00:59.310 --> 00:00:59.320 
call and cover three those two inside

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:00.779 
call and cover three those two inside
receivers<00:00:59.800> which<00:00:59.980> is<00:01:00.100> Williams<00:01:00.430> and<00:01:00.520> Porter

00:01:00.779 --> 00:01:00.789 
receivers which is Williams and Porter

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:02.160 
receivers which is Williams and Porter
both<00:01:00.910> running<00:01:01.149> the<00:01:01.239> stick<00:01:01.449> concept<00:01:01.899> are<00:01:02.020> going

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:02.170 
both running the stick concept are going

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.439 
both running the stick concept are going
to<00:01:02.230> get<00:01:02.350> a<00:01:02.379> jam<00:01:02.739> and<00:01:03.119> basically<00:01:04.119> what<00:01:04.330> that's

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:04.449 
to get a jam and basically what that's

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:06.180 
to get a jam and basically what that's
going<00:01:04.690> to<00:01:04.750> allow<00:01:04.839> is<00:01:05.080> Jones<00:01:05.410> or<00:01:05.680> williamson

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:06.190 
going to allow is Jones or williamson

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:07.529 
going to allow is Jones or williamson
depending<00:01:06.550> on<00:01:06.670> what<00:01:06.759> the<00:01:06.789> coverage<00:01:07.090> is<00:01:07.210> to<00:01:07.420> get

00:01:07.529 --> 00:01:07.539 
depending on what the coverage is to get

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:09.359 
depending on what the coverage is to get
open<00:01:07.690> since<00:01:08.440> it's<00:01:08.619> the<00:01:08.709> nickel<00:01:08.979> three<00:01:09.099> through

00:01:09.359 --> 00:01:09.369 
open since it's the nickel three through

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:12.150 
open since it's the nickel three through
five<00:01:10.259> Porter<00:01:11.259> isn't<00:01:11.500> going<00:01:11.770> to<00:01:11.830> be<00:01:11.920> jammed

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:12.160 
five Porter isn't going to be jammed

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:13.499 
five Porter isn't going to be jammed
because<00:01:12.399> a<00:01:12.429> linebackers<00:01:12.940> across<00:01:13.209> from<00:01:13.390> him

00:01:13.499 --> 00:01:13.509 
because a linebackers across from him

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:15.150 
because a linebackers across from him
but<00:01:13.810> if<00:01:13.929> a<00:01:13.990> defensive<00:01:14.440> back<00:01:14.590> with<00:01:14.740> across<00:01:14.979> from

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:15.160 
but if a defensive back with across from

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:16.889 
but if a defensive back with across from
he<00:01:15.429> would<00:01:15.580> get<00:01:15.759> jammed<00:01:16.030> so<00:01:16.509> that<00:01:16.690> basically

00:01:16.889 --> 00:01:16.899 
he would get jammed so that basically

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:19.199 
he would get jammed so that basically
i'm<00:01:17.259> trying<00:01:17.470> to<00:01:17.530> say<00:01:17.740> if<00:01:18.310> defensive<00:01:18.880> backs<00:01:19.060> are

00:01:19.199 --> 00:01:19.209 
i'm trying to say if defensive backs are

00:01:19.209 --> 00:01:20.490 
i'm trying to say if defensive backs are
lined<00:01:19.390> up<00:01:19.450> across<00:01:19.539> these<00:01:19.959> guys<00:01:20.170> those<00:01:20.470> two

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:20.500 
lined up across these guys those two

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.020 
lined up across these guys those two
guys<00:01:20.679> are<00:01:20.890> going<00:01:21.009> to<00:01:21.069> get<00:01:21.190> jam<00:01:21.369> if<00:01:21.550> only<00:01:21.729> ones

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.030 
guys are going to get jam if only ones

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:23.910 
guys are going to get jam if only ones
lined<00:01:22.539> up<00:01:22.660> across<00:01:22.780> like<00:01:23.229> for<00:01:23.410> instance<00:01:23.470> porter

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
lined up across like for instance porter

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.559 
lined up across like for instance porter
has<00:01:24.039> a<00:01:24.069> linebacker<00:01:24.550> he's<00:01:25.209> going<00:01:25.390> to<00:01:25.450> get

00:01:25.559 --> 00:01:25.569 
has a linebacker he's going to get

00:01:25.569 --> 00:01:27.150 
has a linebacker he's going to get
jammed<00:01:25.810> but<00:01:26.050> Williams<00:01:26.410> has<00:01:26.590> a<00:01:26.619> Nickelback

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:27.160 
jammed but Williams has a Nickelback

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.279 
jammed but Williams has a Nickelback
which<00:01:27.640> is<00:01:27.759> a<00:01:27.789> defensive<00:01:28.209> back<00:01:28.390> he<00:01:28.630> is<00:01:28.660> he<00:01:28.990> will

00:01:29.279 --> 00:01:29.289 
which is a defensive back he is he will

Jam<00:02:08.830> Porter<00:02:09.250> and<00:02:09.429> he<00:02:09.970> would<00:02:10.060> actually<00:02:10.330> go<00:02:10.420> out

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539 
Jam Porter and he would actually go out

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:11.970 
Jam Porter and he would actually go out
there<00:02:10.690> to<00:02:10.810> cover<00:02:10.989> now<00:02:11.349> you<00:02:11.410> still<00:02:11.680> may<00:02:11.770> really

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
there to cover now you still may really

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.820 
there to cover now you still may really
get<00:02:12.099> that<00:02:12.190> pass<00:02:12.459> over<00:02:12.880> to<00:02:13.090> the<00:02:13.690> receiver<00:02:14.050> but

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
get that pass over to the receiver but

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.230 
get that pass over to the receiver but
there's<00:02:15.130> a<00:02:15.190> chance<00:02:15.460> that<00:02:15.610> he's<00:02:15.880> going<00:02:16.060> to<00:02:16.120> be

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.240 
there's a chance that he's going to be

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:17.670 
there's a chance that he's going to be
jammed<00:02:16.540> or<00:02:16.780> a<00:02:16.810> chance<00:02:17.110> and<00:02:17.260> he<00:02:17.350> may<00:02:17.470> get<00:02:17.620> a

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
jammed or a chance and he may get a

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:18.120 
jammed or a chance and he may get a
picked<00:02:17.860> off

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
picked off

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:19.740 
picked off
but<00:02:18.250> most<00:02:18.430> of<00:02:18.520> the<00:02:18.580> case<00:02:18.760> the<00:02:19.270> linebackers

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:19.750 
but most of the case the linebackers

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:20.910 
but most of the case the linebackers
still<00:02:19.960> may<00:02:20.050> not<00:02:20.200> really<00:02:20.350> get<00:02:20.530> over<00:02:20.590> fast

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
still may not really get over fast

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.320 
still may not really get over fast
enough<00:02:21.220> so<00:02:21.250> you<00:02:21.430> can<00:02:21.460> still<00:02:21.760> make<00:02:21.880> that<00:02:22.060> throw

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
enough so you can still make that throw

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.210 
enough so you can still make that throw
just<00:02:23.020> be<00:02:23.140> careful<00:02:23.290> when<00:02:23.650> making<00:02:23.680> the<00:02:24.010> throw

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
just be careful when making the throw

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.730 
just be careful when making the throw
though<00:02:24.390> there<00:02:25.390> you<00:02:25.450> go<00:02:25.620> apparently<00:02:26.620> my

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:26.740 
though there you go apparently my

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:28.230 
though there you go apparently my
receiver<00:02:27.070> can't<00:02:27.250> catch<00:02:27.460> it<00:02:27.640> now<00:02:27.970> let's<00:02:28.120> go

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:28.240 
receiver can't catch it now let's go

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:29.520 
receiver can't catch it now let's go
ahead<00:02:28.300> and<00:02:28.390> go<00:02:28.510> back<00:02:28.540> in<00:02:28.900> this<00:02:29.050> one<00:02:29.230> more<00:02:29.380> time

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530

ahead and go back in this one more time
the<00:02:29.710> sack<00:02:29.920> same<00:02:30.100> concept<00:02:30.700> that<00:02:30.820> I've<00:02:30.970> been

pretty much so again you can run that

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:56.760 
pretty much so again you can run that
concept<00:03:55.810> pretty<00:03:56.020> much<00:03:56.170> against<00:03:56.440> almost<00:03:56.590> any

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:56.770 
concept pretty much against almost any

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:58.230 
concept pretty much against almost any
zone<00:03:57.070> coverage<00:03:57.459> for<00:03:57.760> instance<00:03:58.000> let's<00:03:58.150> go

00:03:58.230 --> 00:03:58.240 
zone coverage for instance let's go

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.330 
zone coverage for instance let's go
ahead<00:03:58.300> and<00:03:58.390> look<00:03:58.510> at<00:03:58.600> another<00:03:58.810> one<00:03:59.080> as<00:03:59.310> far<00:04:00.310> as

running this play or this concept it

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:03.870 
running this play or this concept it
gets<00:04:02.140> another<00:04:02.290> defense<00:04:02.740> let's<00:04:03.520> go<00:04:03.640> ahead<00:04:03.790> and

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:03.880 
gets another defense let's go ahead and

gets another defense let's go ahead and
run<00:04:04.000> it<00:04:04.120> against<00:04:04.360> some<00:04:04.630> something<00:04:05.380> like<00:04:05.470> out

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 
run it against some something like out

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:07.590 
run it against some something like out
at<00:04:05.770> a<00:04:05.830> dollar<00:04:06.010> let's<00:04:06.850> run<00:04:07.060> it<00:04:07.090> against<00:04:07.420> cover

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:07.600 
at a dollar let's run it against cover

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.890 
at a dollar let's run it against cover
to<00:04:07.950> this<00:04:08.950> time<00:04:09.130> we<00:04:09.250> got<00:04:09.400> basically<00:04:09.970> we've<00:04:10.660> got

a<00:04:52.929> concept<00:04:53.319> you<00:04:53.469> can<00:04:53.589> run<00:04:53.739> against<00:04:53.949> most<00:04:54.189> zone

00:04:54.329 --> 00:04:54.339

coverages<00:04:54.849> I<00:04:55.029> like<00:04:55.749> to<00:04:55.839> run<00:04:55.989> that<00:04:56.079> inside<00:04:56.409> the

00:04:56.519 --> 00:04:56.529 
coverages I like to run that inside the

00:04:56.529 --> 00:04:57.629 
coverages I like to run that inside the
red<00:04:56.679> zone<00:04:56.709> because<00:04:57.249> it's<00:04:57.369> been<00:04:57.459> very

00:04:57.629 --> 00:04:57.639 
red zone because it's been very

00:04:57.639 --> 00:04:59.009 
red zone because it's been very
consistent<00:04:57.969> for<00:04:58.299> me<00:04:58.419> as<00:04:58.479> far<00:04:58.599> as<00:04:58.719> picking<00:04:58.899> up

00:04:59.009 --> 00:04:59.019 
consistent for me as far as picking up

00:04:59.019 --> 00:05:01.589 
consistent for me as far as picking up
yardage<00:04:59.349> goes
