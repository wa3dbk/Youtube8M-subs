00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 In the past youtube only needed one 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.620
 normal headset around the viewer too 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.240
 excite 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.680
 since youtube but massive 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.330
 has professionalized own self 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.740
 smallest channels professional 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.210
 equipment and how I like my sound 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.670
 produce and what I recommend you 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.289
 can you hear in this video sounds 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.150
 caused by vibrations of the air 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.130
 have the vibrations of low tones 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.320
 a low and dead a high one 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.670
 Frequency with a microphone you can 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.279
 Track these and electrical 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.720
 Convert signals xlr cables offer 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.820
 the least disturbances and can 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.399
 phantom power also exists 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.980
 it still 63 5 and 3 5 for sound transmission 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.750
 mm jack for all cables there is one 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.850
 male and female form at the 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.500
 There are two options for the microphone 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.510
 the sound from the microphone should be directly in 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.250
 go to the pc or through an audio before 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.510
 interface or mixing console are hunted 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.100
 to increase the quality 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.480
 this is the sound, for example 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.550
 from the orient dancer if he without 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.870
 editing in the pc flows and now 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.699
 I use again the settings of 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.110
 my microphone processor the whole 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.090
 sound from the video was no longer with 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.649
 software post-processed as a microphone 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.870
 I use the helm in tsa 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.430
 It is a condenser microphone needed 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.619
 to work 48 volt 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.540
 phantom power capacitor microphone 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.979
 you actually have to sing and take 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.790
 for voice recordings he dynamic 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.080
 microphones 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.939
 However, I am in the sound 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.010
 Commentary extremely satisfied and will 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.060
 for the time being not to change the interest has 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.259
 also no audible 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.060
 background noise and is in the 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.979
 German youtube scene strongly represented 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.600
 at the roder internets is located 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.860
 in front of the micro a head protection around the 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.689
 attenuate pilots 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.369
 how strong these plates are you can 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.990
 effortlessly find out by simply 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.860
 during the pi loud hand before 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.689
 keep your mouth shut 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.490
 In addition, the microphone spinner provides 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.450
 for that eg bumps at the table 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.950
 be intercepted 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.450
 the best sound can be achieved if you 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.310
 talking about the golden point and not 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.570
 too far away from the micro is after 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.329
 My sound is processed by the 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.520
 microphone prix m processor 286 it from 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.439
 db-x with a xlr cable I have that 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.390
 or a dancer from behind the processor 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.280
 plugged in front left I determine in 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.140
 the premium area with the game controller 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.149
 how strong the microphone processor is 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.799
 audio editing should light up during 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.990
 the reception of the green lamps is everything 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.460
 okay orange on the border and red 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.329
 Gives us the signal for the amplified 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.130
 to reduce 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:04.530
 next to the lamps is the button 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.210
 for the 48 volt phantom power this 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.190
 you can only use if the micro you 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.410
 we really need activated 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.050
 The 80 yards will automatically be the 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.040
 Noise filtered out though 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.120
 I do not agree with that anymore 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.580
 that's why I have that 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.110
 There the process deactivates at pass 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.520
 button gives us the possibility of all 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.630
 subsequent effects and 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.280
 turn off one 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.320
 make before-after-comparison 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.180
 it continues with the compressor ensures 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:28.190
 for that our voice always as possible 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.690
 on the same volume remains with the 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.460
 drive we determine how strong the 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.900
 compressor should work the intensity 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:35.060
 can we do with the red lamps 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.980
 seen with the density one determines how 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:40.250
 direct the compressor should react 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.900
 can be with the ds there and louder 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.580
 We conclude that we decide the left 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.680
 frequency of our loud and right the 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.570
 Strength of the effect fully turned on 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.820
 we can add the robben babies to the sauce 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:51.710
 Katja Burkard parodies that 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.750
 the heart of db-x is a hot one 

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:55.520
 With it details can be a high 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.140
 and deep frequencies 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.330
 right there you can get out of the rudder nth 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.370
 to bring out a lot of sound quality with 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.320
 the expander will be quietly disturbed 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.030
 filtered out left we determine from 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.380
 which volume is filtered and 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.070
 right how strong the whole thing done 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.660
 shall be 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:10.580
 When we speak the lamp will turn green 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.810
 shine and if not threatened 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.190
 with you quiet noise of the 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.380
 You can hear this soundtrack here 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:17.360
 completely remove with the output 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.250
 game we determine how loud the finished 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.350
 the product is passed on the lights 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.810
 red lamp over controls the sound uses 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:27.920
 you only need the dbx you still need 1 6 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:30.110
 3 5 mm jack male to 35 mm small 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.750
 jack cable around the processor with the 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:34.550
 standard 35 mm jack micro connection 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:36.350
 a computer to connect my sound 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:39.380
 band before that in addition by the 

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:40.940
 equalizer of my behringer 6002 with him 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.440
 you can reinforce the voice by that 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.120
 the middle and low tones something 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.590
 but passive make it is also 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.630
 easy with the equalizer in the city 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.550
 make that behringer 1002 or 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:51.920
 alternatively also the brother of 802 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:54.410
 offers the user a second microphone 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.730
 slot for the recordings also 48 volts 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:57.620
 phantom feed videos the mixer 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:00.230
 cheaper is s with the wÃ¤hringer 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:02.239
 axsionics 302, however, has this 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:04.700
 mixer only one connection no 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:06.860
 equalizer and only 15 instead of 48 volt 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:08.450
 phantom power you want to save space 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:10.040
 Dispense with unnecessary controls and one 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:11.209
 nice design with a slightly better sound 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:14.570
 may be also the 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:16.310
 grow phocuswright scarlett 22 or 24 

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:17.840
 Suppose someone would do all of my work 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:19.549
 Equipment clown and I had to do everything 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.109
 I would buy new from today 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:23.740
 probably that rohde pro 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:25.960
 buy caster together with the dbx 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:28.270
 The program is called in from the top 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.410
 so no micro would like the comment 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.509
 cover face struggles 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:33.220
 it is optimal as a dynamic micro for 

00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:34.539
 voice recording suitable and owns 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:36.729
 an integrated pop protection 

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:38.680
 it does not need phantom power 

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:39.190
 but still only connected via xlr 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.590
 become 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:43.000
 prominent user is the one with too 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:45.580
 You could also get that much money 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.630
 electro like 20 from dehner can 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.220
 otherwise there are also the 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:50.380
 just change the red one 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:52.419
 podcast to order and directly by usb 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:55.060
 to connect to the pc recommends to 

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:57.789
 the microphone spider psm 1 and the 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:59.740
 microphone joint on psa 1 the spider will 

00:04:57.789 --> 00:05:01.449
 only supplied with the red dancer at 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:03.610
 rest you have to order separately 

00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:05.289
 I currently use this cheap 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:07.030
 table tripod with actually solid 

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:08.349
 stood the micro is with it however 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:08.979
 still twice on the table 

00:05:08.349 --> 00:05:10.210
 flown 

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:12.159
 Luck is not fortunate 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:14.319
 an external sound card was created 

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:16.840
 I do not need the sound with me 

00:05:14.319 --> 00:05:18.819
 over the 3.5 mm jack connection the 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:20.409
 mainboard usb alternatives go with it 

00:05:18.819 --> 00:05:21.789
 Generally also completely okay 

00:05:20.409 --> 00:05:23.020
 At the end you just have to look at it 

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:24.490
 pay attention to a cup of tea or the 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:26.500
 openbroadcast the right source 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:27.789
 chosen to have dbx over 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:28.990
 The included power supply unit with power 

00:05:27.789 --> 00:05:30.789
 be connected 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:32.259
 Power cables are always included 

00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:34.419
 All other audio cables you have to go 

00:05:32.259 --> 00:05:35.770
 Buy separately all products from it 

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:37.300
 The video is clearly arranged in the 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:38.770
 video description linked to questions
