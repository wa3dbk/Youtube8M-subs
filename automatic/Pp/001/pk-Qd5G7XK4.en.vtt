00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
additional stuff that they add into a

additional stuff that they add into a
flight<00:02:50.870> booked<00:02:51.080> v5<00:02:52.000> just<00:02:53.000> a<00:02:53.150> light<00:02:53.360> indicator

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
flight booked v5 just a light indicator

00:02:53.900 --> 00:03:00.370 
flight booked v5 just a light indicator
on<00:02:53.989> the<00:02:54.110> bottom<00:02:54.560> and<00:02:55.810> the<00:02:57.340> stylus<00:02:59.019> let<00:03:00.019> me<00:03:00.140> turn

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380 
on the bottom and the stylus let me turn

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.730 
on the bottom and the stylus let me turn
this<00:03:00.590> thing<00:03:00.650> on

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:03.740 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:14.780 

okay<00:03:11.870> okay<00:03:12.870> its<00:03:13.110> power<00:03:13.380> up<00:03:13.560> the<00:03:14.250> unit<00:03:14.580> come

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
okay okay its power up the unit come

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:19.760 
okay okay its power up the unit come
with<00:03:15.030> windows<00:03:15.420> vista<00:03:17.480> so<00:03:18.480> it's<00:03:19.260> a<00:03:19.410> vista

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:19.770 
with windows vista so it's a vista

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:23.030 
with windows vista so it's a vista
business<00:03:19.950> units<00:03:21.620> performance<00:03:22.620> i<00:03:22.740> think<00:03:22.980> is

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
business units performance i think is

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.580 
business units performance i think is
pretty<00:03:23.370> it's<00:03:23.820> much<00:03:24.150> better<00:03:24.360> than<00:03:24.570> V<00:03:24.810> I<00:03:25.020> don't

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
pretty it's much better than V I don't

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.740 
pretty it's much better than V I don't
know<00:03:25.650> if<00:03:25.740> it's<00:03:25.860> better<00:03:26.100> than<00:03:26.310> B<00:03:26.459> 338<00:03:26.820> but<00:03:27.270> it

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
know if it's better than B 338 but it

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.449 
know if it's better than B 338 but it
does<00:03:27.959> seems<00:03:28.170> a<00:03:28.290> little<00:03:28.440> bit<00:03:28.620> faster<00:03:29.070> but<00:03:29.280> ah

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
does seems a little bit faster but ah

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:34.820 
does seems a little bit faster but ah
but<00:03:30.680> because<00:03:31.680> of<00:03:31.709> the<00:03:31.920> Vista<00:03:33.470> somehow<00:03:34.470> I<00:03:34.500> have

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:34.830 
but because of the Vista somehow I have

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:37.910 
but because of the Vista somehow I have
a<00:03:34.860> kind<00:03:35.340> of<00:03:35.430> a<00:03:36.060> feeling<00:03:37.050> it's<00:03:37.590> a<00:03:37.709> right<00:03:37.890> a

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
a kind of a feeling it's a right a

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.670 
a kind of a feeling it's a right a
little<00:03:38.010> bit<00:03:38.160> slower<00:03:38.520> but<00:03:38.900> spec<00:03:39.900> wise<00:03:40.140> is<00:03:40.410> come

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
little bit slower but spec wise is come

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.110 
little bit slower but spec wise is come
with<00:03:40.830> the<00:03:40.950> core<00:03:41.280> duo<00:03:41.840> processor<00:03:43.040> so<00:03:44.040> it's<00:03:44.340> it's

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
with the core duo processor so it's it's

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.400 
with the core duo processor so it's it's
pretty<00:03:45.450> powerful<00:03:46.220> you<00:03:47.269> 2500<00:03:48.269> come<00:03:49.170> with<00:03:49.290> the

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
pretty powerful you 2500 come with the

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:54.380 
pretty powerful you 2500 come with the
1.2<00:03:50.310> gigahertz<00:03:50.640> core<00:03:51.180> duo<00:03:52.430> and<00:03:53.430> one<00:03:54.120> gig

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
1.2 gigahertz core duo and one gig

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:59.780 
1.2 gigahertz core duo and one gig
memory<00:03:55.880> 60<00:03:56.880> gig<00:03:57.330> hard<00:03:57.630> drive<00:03:57.720> I<00:03:58.670> believe<00:03:59.670> it's

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
memory 60 gig hard drive I believe it's

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:03.050 
memory 60 gig hard drive I believe it's
using<00:04:00.269> a<00:04:00.769> 1.8<00:04:01.769> inch<00:04:02.010> hard<00:04:02.370> drive<00:04:02.430> but<00:04:02.730> I<00:04:02.850> can

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
using a 1.8 inch hard drive but I can

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:07.670 
using a 1.8 inch hard drive but I can
really<00:04:03.330> tell<00:04:05.150> could<00:04:06.150> be<00:04:06.300> the<00:04:06.450> same<00:04:06.690> 2.5<00:04:07.380> but

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
really tell could be the same 2.5 but

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.670 
really tell could be the same 2.5 but
it's<00:04:07.910> used<00:04:08.910> to<00:04:09.030> be<00:04:09.150> the<00:04:09.329> you<00:04:09.510> you<00:04:09.780> are<00:04:10.079> on<00:04:10.350> the<00:04:10.530> v

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
it's used to be the you you are on the v

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.740 
it's used to be the you you are on the v
33<00:04:11.010> I<00:04:11.220> you<00:04:11.370> can<00:04:11.640> open<00:04:12.000> up<00:04:12.060> the<00:04:12.120> units<00:04:12.510> and<00:04:12.660> you

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
33 I you can open up the units and you

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.530 
33 I you can open up the units and you
can<00:04:12.930> replace<00:04:13.290> the<00:04:13.440> hard<00:04:13.560> drive<00:04:13.680> yourself<00:04:14.540> but

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
can replace the hard drive yourself but

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.020 
can replace the hard drive yourself but
this<00:04:15.840> is<00:04:16.049> no<00:04:16.229> longer<00:04:16.440> the<00:04:16.650> case<00:04:16.919> with<00:04:17.160> v<00:04:17.310> 33<00:04:17.609> I

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
this is no longer the case with v 33 I

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:20.690 
this is no longer the case with v 33 I
mean<00:04:18.209> revive<00:04:18.690> everything<00:04:19.380> is<00:04:19.530> basically<00:04:19.890> silt

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700 
mean revive everything is basically silt

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:24.650 
mean revive everything is basically silt
down<00:04:21.090> and<00:04:22.370> you<00:04:23.370> don't<00:04:23.669> really<00:04:24.300> have<00:04:24.600> the

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
down and you don't really have the

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:27.260 
down and you don't really have the
chance<00:04:25.080> to<00:04:25.200> be<00:04:25.710> able<00:04:25.800> I<00:04:26.430> mean<00:04:26.729> if<00:04:26.790> you<00:04:26.880> open<00:04:27.210> up

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
chance to be able I mean if you open up

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:30.590 
chance to be able I mean if you open up
then<00:04:27.510> you'd<00:04:27.690> basically<00:04:27.930> lose<00:04:28.380> to<00:04:28.530> oranjee<00:04:29.600> the

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:30.600 
then you'd basically lose to oranjee the

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.900 
then you'd basically lose to oranjee the
batter<00:04:30.840> is<00:04:31.080> much<00:04:31.350> bigger<00:04:31.620> it's<00:04:32.340> like<00:04:32.610> taking

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:32.910 
batter is much bigger it's like taking

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:35.390 
batter is much bigger it's like taking
almost<00:04:33.180> like<00:04:33.510> half<00:04:33.870> of<00:04:34.110> the<00:04:34.290> units<00:04:34.650> that's

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
almost like half of the units that's

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.270 
almost like half of the units that's
also<00:04:35.850> translated<00:04:36.720> into<00:04:36.810> a<00:04:36.990> better<00:04:37.740> battery

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 
also translated into a better battery

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.020 
also translated into a better battery
life<00:04:38.490> also<00:04:38.970> used<00:04:39.930> to<00:04:40.080> being<00:04:40.290> the<00:04:40.410> v<00:04:40.770> 33<00:04:41.220> i<00:04:41.430> only

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.030 
life also used to being the v 33 i only

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:45.860 
life also used to being the v 33 i only
got<00:04:42.180> about<00:04:42.240> two<00:04:42.690> hours<00:04:42.890> this<00:04:43.890> one<00:04:44.190> the<00:04:45.030> vista

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
got about two hours this one the vista

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:49.219

00:04:58.969 --> 00:04:58.979 
three hours battery so a little bit

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:03.219 
three hours battery so a little bit
better<00:04:59.130> in<00:04:59.400> the<00:04:59.490> battery<00:04:59.760> life<00:05:00.000> section<00:05:01.340> now

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:03.229 
better in the battery life section now

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:05.779 
better in the battery life section now
the<00:05:04.229> only<00:05:04.410> complaint<00:05:04.560> i<00:05:04.860> have<00:05:04.890> with<00:05:05.280> the<00:05:05.400> units

00:05:05.779 --> 00:05:05.789 
the only complaint i have with the units

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:08.900 
the only complaint i have with the units
is<00:05:06.030> it's<00:05:06.419> a<00:05:06.690> it's<00:05:07.289> a<00:05:07.470> heavier<00:05:07.950> munits<00:05:08.580> than<00:05:08.789> the

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:08.910 
is it's a it's a heavier munits than the

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:13.339 
is it's a it's a heavier munits than the
victory<00:05:09.330> to<00:05:09.390> be<00:05:09.539> high<00:05:09.890> v<00:05:10.890> 33<00:05:11.220> is<00:05:11.610> about<00:05:12.349> 2.5

00:05:13.339 --> 00:05:13.349 
victory to be high v 33 is about 2.5

00:05:13.349 --> 00:05:14.200 
victory to be high v 33 is about 2.5
pounds

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:14.210 
pounds

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:17.050 
pounds
if<00:05:14.330> which<00:05:14.840> is<00:05:15.080> on<00:05:15.350> the<00:05:16.160> heavy<00:05:16.400> side<00:05:16.550> are

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:17.060 
if which is on the heavy side are

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:20.110 
if which is on the heavy side are
compared<00:05:17.960> to<00:05:18.169> competitor<00:05:18.710> like<00:05:18.919> a<00:05:18.949> piece<00:05:19.310> 610

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:20.120

compared to competitor like a piece 610
fujitsu<00:05:20.860> producer<00:05:21.860> is<00:05:22.100> only<00:05:22.250> about<00:05:22.370> 2.2<00:05:23.180> a

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:23.210 
fujitsu producer is only about 2.2 a

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:28.420 
fujitsu producer is only about 2.2 a
pound<00:05:23.539> and<00:05:23.750> this<00:05:24.470> guy<00:05:24.800> the<00:05:26.410> v5<00:05:27.410> is<00:05:27.889> actually<00:05:28.400> I

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:28.430 
pound and this guy the v5 is actually I

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:34.439 
pound and this guy the v5 is actually I
put<00:05:29.150> into<00:05:29.840> a<00:05:29.870> scale<00:05:30.410> it's<00:05:31.280> almost<00:05:31.720> 2.8<00:05:32.720> 2.9<00:05:33.620> so

00:05:34.439 --> 00:05:34.449 
put into a scale it's almost 2.8 2.9 so

00:05:34.449 --> 00:05:38.050 
put into a scale it's almost 2.8 2.9 so
it's<00:05:35.449> on<00:05:35.720> the<00:05:35.870> heavy<00:05:36.080> side<00:05:36.259> I<00:05:36.770> guess<00:05:37.729> it's<00:05:37.970> just

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:38.060 
it's on the heavy side I guess it's just

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:40.570 
it's on the heavy side I guess it's just
because<00:05:38.419> of<00:05:38.870> the<00:05:38.900> material<00:05:39.710> that<00:05:39.860> they<00:05:39.889> use<00:05:40.280> is

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:40.580 
because of the material that they use is

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:45.839 
because of the material that they use is
make<00:05:41.180> it<00:05:41.210> much<00:05:41.569> heavier<00:05:43.720> but<00:05:44.720> I<00:05:45.080> mean<00:05:45.229> still

00:05:45.839 --> 00:05:45.849 
make it much heavier but I mean still

00:05:45.849 --> 00:05:48.580 
make it much heavier but I mean still
consider<00:05:46.849> like<00:05:47.120> I<00:05:47.360> mean<00:05:47.509> I<00:05:47.720> mean<00:05:47.960> it's<00:05:48.199> under

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:48.590 
consider like I mean I mean it's under

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:51.070 
consider like I mean I mean it's under
three<00:05:48.919> pounds<00:05:49.400> so<00:05:49.639> one<00:05:50.270> of<00:05:50.300> those<00:05:50.630> I<00:05:50.840> mean
