got a lot of promise but we'll have to

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:55.910 
got a lot of promise but we'll have to
see<00:02:53.670> how<00:02:53.790> he<00:02:53.970> can<00:02:54.209> can<00:02:54.720> do<00:02:54.840> in<00:02:55.020> here<00:02:55.230> across<00:02:55.800> the

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
see how he can can do in here across the

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.120 
see how he can can do in here across the
line<00:02:56.280> will<00:02:56.550> be<00:02:56.640> the<00:02:56.790> three<00:02:57.140> his<00:02:58.140> speed<00:02:58.860> figures

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
line will be the three his speed figures

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:00.710 
line will be the three his speed figures
are<00:02:59.250> improving<00:02:59.700> but<00:02:59.760> but<00:03:00.120> he's<00:03:00.239> much<00:03:00.450> slower

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
are improving but but he's much slower

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.600 
are improving but but he's much slower
than<00:03:00.930> the<00:03:00.989> others<00:03:01.320> he's<00:03:01.950> going<00:03:02.250> the<00:03:02.430> right<00:03:02.550> way

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
than the others he's going the right way

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.250 
than the others he's going the right way
but<00:03:02.820> I<00:03:02.940> think<00:03:03.120> he's<00:03:03.209> overmatched<00:03:03.360> in<00:03:03.930> here<00:03:04.140> a

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
but I think he's overmatched in here a

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.020 
but I think he's overmatched in here a
bolo<00:03:05.100> is<00:03:05.160> probably<00:03:05.489> going<00:03:05.610> to<00:03:05.670> take<00:03:05.820> some

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030

make the Kentucky Derby let's hope think
he's<00:03:22.260> probably<00:03:22.440> better<00:03:22.680> on<00:03:22.860> turf<00:03:23.130> but<00:03:23.459> i<00:03:23.700> will

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
he's probably better on turf but i will

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:25.640 
he's probably better on turf but i will
see<00:03:24.390> if<00:03:24.420> he<00:03:24.570> can<00:03:24.690> improve<00:03:24.810> second<00:03:25.350> off<00:03:25.470> the

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650

to<00:03:27.750> be<00:03:27.840> my<00:03:27.989> top<00:03:28.200> choice<00:03:28.440> in<00:03:28.590> here<00:03:28.769> i'm<00:03:29.040> going<00:03:29.190> to

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
to be my top choice in here i'm going to

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.570 
to be my top choice in here i'm going to
try<00:03:29.370> to<00:03:29.930> beat<00:03:30.930> Dortmund<00:03:31.260> with<00:03:31.440> him<00:03:31.650> last<00:03:32.400> time

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 
try to beat Dortmund with him last time

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.400 
try to beat Dortmund with him last time
that<00:03:32.640> was<00:03:32.820> a<00:03:32.880> good<00:03:33.090> effort<00:03:33.209> he<00:03:33.750> ran<00:03:33.989> a<00:03:34.170> nice

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
that was a good effort he ran a nice

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.410 
that was a good effort he ran a nice
second<00:03:34.860> to<00:03:34.950> Dortmund<00:03:35.370> wasn't<00:03:35.910> a<00:03:35.970> lot<00:03:36.090> of<00:03:36.239> pace

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
second to Dortmund wasn't a lot of pace

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.420 
second to Dortmund wasn't a lot of pace
he<00:03:36.660> rallied<00:03:37.019> he<00:03:37.110> finished<00:03:37.470> well<00:03:37.650> I<00:03:37.920> think<00:03:38.190> this

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
he rallied he finished well I think this

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:39.949 
he rallied he finished well I think this
extra<00:03:38.820> distance<00:03:39.030> is<00:03:39.360> going<00:03:39.540> to<00:03:39.600> help<00:03:39.750> his

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
extra distance is going to help his

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:42.410 
extra distance is going to help his
cause<00:03:40.170> and<00:03:40.519> to<00:03:41.519> show<00:03:41.670> the<00:03:41.790> difference<00:03:42.090> between

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
cause and to show the difference between

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.360 
cause and to show the difference between
how<00:03:42.660> much<00:03:42.810> improvement<00:03:43.170> he's<00:03:43.440> shown<00:03:43.620> and<00:03:44.010> bolo

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
how much improvement he's shown and bolo

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.910 
how much improvement he's shown and bolo
back<00:03:44.880> I<00:03:44.910> decide<00:03:45.269> on<00:03:45.390> December<00:03:45.780> 27th<00:03:46.380> bolo<00:03:46.620> one

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
back I decide on December 27th bolo one

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.259

Park Seabrook is maiden by a neck and he

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:55.759 
Park Seabrook is maiden by a neck and he
earned<00:03:54.150> on<00:03:54.390> a<00:03:54.630> slow<00:03:54.959> much<00:03:55.230> slower<00:03:55.470> speed

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
earned on a slow much slower speed

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:57.740 
earned on a slow much slower speed
figure<00:03:56.040> than<00:03:56.190> bolo<00:03:56.370> but<00:03:56.730> now<00:03:56.850> fast-forward<00:03:57.120> to

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
figure than bolo but now fast-forward to

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:59.630 
figure than bolo but now fast-forward to
the<00:03:57.870> San<00:03:58.049> Felipe<00:03:58.500> and<00:03:58.739> to<00:03:59.040> this<00:03:59.190> race<00:03:59.430> now

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 
the San Felipe and to this race now

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.940 
the San Felipe and to this race now
prospect<00:04:00.150> park<00:04:00.360> is<00:04:00.480> much<00:04:00.720> faster<00:04:00.989> actually<00:04:01.890> if

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
prospect park is much faster actually if

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.380 
prospect park is much faster actually if
you<00:04:02.010> look<00:04:02.040> at<00:04:02.250> all<00:04:02.430> of<00:04:02.459> his<00:04:02.670> speed<00:04:02.880> figures<00:04:03.180> in

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
you look at all of his speed figures in

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:05.210 
you look at all of his speed figures in
each<00:04:03.600> race<00:04:03.840> he's<00:04:04.110> earned<00:04:04.320> a<00:04:04.380> better<00:04:04.560> number<00:04:04.739> so

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
each race he's earned a better number so

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:06.320 
each race he's earned a better number so
he<00:04:05.280> continues<00:04:05.430> to<00:04:05.730> get<00:04:05.910> better<00:04:06.090> that's

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:06.330 
he continues to get better that's

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:08.420 
he continues to get better that's
exactly<00:04:06.750> what<00:04:06.959> you<00:04:07.049> want<00:04:07.200> to<00:04:07.290> see<00:04:07.470> and<00:04:07.890> I<00:04:08.190> think

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
exactly what you want to see and I think

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.009 
exactly what you want to see and I think
that<00:04:08.580> maybe<00:04:08.880> there'll<00:04:09.090> be<00:04:09.120> enough<00:04:09.450> pace<00:04:09.660> up<00:04:09.870> in

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:10.019 
that maybe there'll be enough pace up in

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:11.600 
that maybe there'll be enough pace up in
here<00:04:10.230> and<00:04:10.410> he<00:04:10.500> can<00:04:10.620> get<00:04:10.799> up<00:04:10.950> at<00:04:11.160> a<00:04:11.190> mountain<00:04:11.400> and

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:11.610 
here and he can get up at a mountain and

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:14.509 
here and he can get up at a mountain and
