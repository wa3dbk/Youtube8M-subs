rhododendrons<00:00:17.460> azaleas<00:00:18.029> naturally<00:00:18.630> growing

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
rhododendrons azaleas naturally growing

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.439 
rhododendrons azaleas naturally growing
and<00:00:19.199> they<00:00:19.619> were<00:00:19.680> just<00:00:19.949> gorgeous<00:00:20.640> so<00:00:21.300> when

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
and they were just gorgeous so when

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:22.820 
and they were just gorgeous so when
you're<00:00:21.570> growing<00:00:21.810> them<00:00:22.080> in<00:00:22.350> your<00:00:22.529> garden

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
you're growing them in your garden

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.349 
you're growing them in your garden
you've<00:00:23.279> got<00:00:23.430> to<00:00:23.519> remember<00:00:23.699> their<00:00:23.970> natural

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
you've got to remember their natural

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.060 
you've got to remember their natural
conditions<00:00:24.810> they<00:00:24.960> like<00:00:25.170> mountains<00:00:25.710> I<00:00:25.859> am

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
conditions they like mountains I am

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.550 
conditions they like mountains I am
convinced<00:00:26.580> they<00:00:26.760> do<00:00:26.910> not<00:00:27.119> grow<00:00:27.390> well<00:00:27.750> next<00:00:28.439> to

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
convinced they do not grow well next to

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.890 
convinced they do not grow well next to
a<00:00:28.590> lake<00:00:28.890> I<00:00:29.160> lived<00:00:29.730> next<00:00:30.000> to<00:00:30.179> Lake<00:00:30.390> Vancouver

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
a lake I lived next to Lake Vancouver

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.569 
a lake I lived next to Lake Vancouver
for<00:00:31.080> a<00:00:31.140> while<00:00:31.289> and<00:00:31.590> tried<00:00:31.980> to<00:00:32.099> grow<00:00:32.250> them<00:00:32.430> in

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
for a while and tried to grow them in

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.490 
for a while and tried to grow them in
the<00:00:32.669> muck<00:00:32.850> and<00:00:33.210> they<00:00:33.540> just<00:00:33.690> rotted<00:00:34.140> right<00:00:34.320> out

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
the muck and they just rotted right out

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.799 
the muck and they just rotted right out
so<00:00:35.130> even<00:00:35.430> if<00:00:35.520> you<00:00:35.610> live<00:00:35.850> next<00:00:36.059> to<00:00:36.239> Lake<00:00:36.540> or<00:00:36.750> you

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
so even if you live next to Lake or you

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.979 
so even if you live next to Lake or you
have<00:00:36.960> really<00:00:37.440> clay<00:00:37.829> really<00:00:38.610> dense<00:00:38.910> soil<00:00:39.270> make

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
have really clay really dense soil make

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.330 
have really clay really dense soil make
raised<00:00:40.260> beds<00:00:40.680> with<00:00:40.829> lots<00:00:41.100> of<00:00:41.190> organic

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
raised beds with lots of organic

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.180 
raised beds with lots of organic
material<00:00:42.270> they<00:00:42.809> grow<00:00:43.110> in<00:00:43.350> the<00:00:43.379> canopy<00:00:43.920> of<00:00:44.100> the

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
material they grow in the canopy of the

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.970 
material they grow in the canopy of the
pine<00:00:44.820> trees<00:00:45.210> in<00:00:45.480> North<00:00:45.510> America<00:00:46.170> so<00:00:46.739> they

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
pine trees in North America so they

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.490 
pine trees in North America so they
really<00:00:47.430> like<00:00:47.730> lots<00:00:48.390> of<00:00:48.600> moisture<00:00:48.870> in<00:00:49.350> there

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
really like lots of moisture in there

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.139 
really like lots of moisture in there
growing<00:00:49.710> right<00:00:50.010> on<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.250> pine<00:00:50.489> needles<00:00:50.670> and

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
growing right on the pine needles and

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.569 
growing right on the pine needles and
the<00:00:51.570> leaves<00:00:51.840> from<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.230> deciduous<00:00:52.680> trees<00:00:53.039> so

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
the leaves from the deciduous trees so

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:54.860 
the leaves from the deciduous trees so
we're<00:00:53.699> not<00:00:53.760> really<00:00:54.030> even<00:00:54.239> growing<00:00:54.449> in<00:00:54.660> soil

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
we're not really even growing in soil

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.240 
we're not really even growing in soil
they're<00:00:55.110> kind<00:00:55.260> of<00:00:55.320> growing<00:00:55.530> just<00:00:55.920> in<00:00:56.100> that

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
they're kind of growing just in that

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.580 
they're kind of growing just in that
mulch<00:00:56.579> so<00:00:57.300> raise<00:00:57.719> them<00:00:57.960> up<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:58.379> give<00:00:58.559> them

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
mulch so raise them up and give them

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.439 
mulch so raise them up and give them
lots<00:00:58.859> of<00:00:59.010> mulch<00:00:59.250> and<00:00:59.520> lots<00:00:59.789> and<00:01:00.090> lots<00:01:00.180> of

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
lots of mulch and lots and lots of

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.750 
lots of mulch and lots and lots of
drainage<00:01:00.899> so<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.620> trick<00:01:01.829> with<00:01:01.859> azaleas<00:01:02.550> is

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
drainage so the trick with azaleas is

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.179 
drainage so the trick with azaleas is
they<00:01:02.910> want<00:01:03.090> to<00:01:03.149> be<00:01:03.239> moist<00:01:03.510> and<00:01:03.840> never<00:01:04.080> dry<00:01:04.500> but

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
they want to be moist and never dry but

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:06.620 
they want to be moist and never dry but
yet<00:01:05.369> they<00:01:05.489> need<00:01:05.640> good<00:01:05.880> drainage<00:01:06.180> and<00:01:06.479> they

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
yet they need good drainage and they

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.240 
yet they need good drainage and they
want<00:01:06.840> to<00:01:06.930> grow<00:01:07.260> where<00:01:07.530> there's<00:01:07.680> lots<00:01:07.830> of<00:01:08.010> mulch

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
want to grow where there's lots of mulch

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.800 
want to grow where there's lots of mulch
and<00:01:08.400> where<00:01:08.580> it's<00:01:08.670> you<00:01:09.090> know<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.330> water<00:01:09.570> just

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
and where it's you know the water just

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.960 
and where it's you know the water just
flows<00:01:10.110> right<00:01:10.229> out<00:01:10.409> and<00:01:10.799> they<00:01:11.460> want<00:01:11.700> some

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
flows right out and they want some

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.609 
flows right out and they want some
humidity<00:01:12.270> they<00:01:12.689> don't<00:01:12.869> do<00:01:13.049> well<00:01:13.200> in<00:01:13.260> real

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
humidity they don't do well in real

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.280 
humidity they don't do well in real
desert<00:01:14.040> conditions<00:01:14.540> but<00:01:15.540> they're<00:01:15.750> easy<00:01:16.049> to

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
desert conditions but they're easy to

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.990 
desert conditions but they're easy to
grow<00:01:16.560> as<00:01:16.860> long<00:01:17.130> as<00:01:17.310> you<00:01:17.400> give<00:01:17.549> them<00:01:17.670> lots<00:01:17.790> of

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
grow as long as you give them lots of

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.420 
grow as long as you give them lots of
water<00:01:18.180> and<00:01:18.570> a<00:01:19.140> lot<00:01:19.290> of<00:01:19.350> times<00:01:19.710> if<00:01:20.009> you<00:01:20.040> live<00:01:20.310> in

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
water and a lot of times if you live in

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.310 
water and a lot of times if you live in
a<00:01:20.490> really<00:01:20.700> hot<00:01:20.970> climate<00:01:21.450> hot<00:01:21.659> Sun<00:01:21.960> will<00:01:22.110> fry

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
a really hot climate hot Sun will fry

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.440 
a really hot climate hot Sun will fry
them<00:01:22.590> so<00:01:22.770> put<00:01:23.310> them<00:01:23.430> in<00:01:23.520> part<00:01:23.790> shade<00:01:24.090> or

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
them so put them in part shade or

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.570 
them so put them in part shade or
underneath<00:01:24.810> some<00:01:25.110> other<00:01:25.320> trees<00:01:25.740> and<00:01:26.100> they'll

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
underneath some other trees and they'll

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.429 
underneath some other trees and they'll
do<00:01:26.759> really<00:01:27.060> well<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.990> thing<00:01:28.170> I<00:01:28.229> like<00:01:28.409> about

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
do really well the thing I like about

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.740 
do really well the thing I like about
azaleas<00:01:29.159> is<00:01:29.369> they're<00:01:29.520> very<00:01:29.700> forgiving<00:01:30.270> so

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
azaleas is they're very forgiving so

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.179 
azaleas is they're very forgiving so
even<00:01:30.990> if<00:01:31.079> they<00:01:31.200> get<00:01:31.350> sunburned<00:01:31.770> or<00:01:31.950> they<00:01:32.070> get

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
even if they get sunburned or they get

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.399 
even if they get sunburned or they get
ratty<00:01:32.490> just<00:01:32.970> trim<00:01:33.270> them<00:01:33.390> down<00:01:33.450> and<00:01:33.930> they<00:01:34.079> love

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
ratty just trim them down and they love

ratty just trim them down and they love
to<00:01:34.439> be<00:01:34.619> trimmed<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.130> more<00:01:35.310> they<00:01:35.460> trim<00:01:35.759> them

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
to be trimmed the more they trim them

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.539 
to be trimmed the more they trim them
the<00:01:36.329> better<00:01:36.570> they<00:01:36.810> do<00:01:36.869> now<00:01:37.710> they<00:01:37.979> say<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.250> best

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
the better they do now they say the best

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.429 
the better they do now they say the best
time<00:01:38.939> to<00:01:39.240> trim<00:01:39.450> them<00:01:39.600> down<00:01:39.630> is<00:01:40.110> in<00:01:40.290> early

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
time to trim them down is in early

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:41.870 
time to trim them down is in early
spring<00:01:40.710> when<00:01:40.890> they've<00:01:41.100> started<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.460> set<00:01:41.670> buds

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
spring when they've started to set buds

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.060 
spring when they've started to set buds
and<00:01:42.090> they're<00:01:42.210> still<00:01:42.659> kind<00:01:42.899> of<00:01:42.990> lanky<00:01:43.200> and<00:01:43.590> then

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
and they're still kind of lanky and then

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.530 
and they're still kind of lanky and then
you<00:01:44.159> kind<00:01:44.340> of<00:01:44.430> even<00:01:44.729> it<00:01:44.850> all<00:01:44.970> out<00:01:45.030> maybe

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
you kind of even it all out maybe

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.020 
you kind of even it all out maybe
cutting<00:01:45.899> a<00:01:45.990> third<00:01:46.259> of<00:01:46.380> it<00:01:46.500> down<00:01:46.710> and<00:01:47.040> then<00:01:47.729> the

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
cutting a third of it down and then the

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.580 
cutting a third of it down and then the
blooms<00:01:48.329> that<00:01:48.540> are<00:01:48.600> remaining<00:01:49.020> or<00:01:49.259> become

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
blooms that are remaining or become

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.469 
blooms that are remaining or become
stronger<00:01:50.070> and<00:01:50.159> I'm<00:01:50.250> going<00:01:50.369> to<00:01:50.399> fill<00:01:50.610> it<00:01:50.759> up<00:01:50.850> but

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
stronger and I'm going to fill it up but

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.749 
stronger and I'm going to fill it up but
my<00:01:51.630> attitude<00:01:52.110> is<00:01:52.350> prune<00:01:52.770> plants<00:01:53.369> when<00:01:53.549> you<00:01:53.640> get

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
my attitude is prune plants when you get

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.280 
my attitude is prune plants when you get
the<00:01:53.880> chance<00:01:54.119> because<00:01:54.360> I<00:01:54.689> don't<00:01:54.990> do<00:01:55.110> anything

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
the chance because I don't do anything

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.350 
the chance because I don't do anything
on<00:01:55.470> a<00:01:55.530> schedule<00:01:55.860> I<00:01:55.920> can't<00:01:56.189> keep<00:01:56.340> up<00:01:56.520> so<00:01:57.180> if<00:01:57.270> I

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
on a schedule I can't keep up so if I

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.090 
on a schedule I can't keep up so if I
look<00:01:57.689> outside<00:01:57.930> and<00:01:58.500> it<00:01:58.590> looks<00:01:58.740> a<00:01:58.799> little<00:01:58.890> bit

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
look outside and it looks a little bit

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.800 
look outside and it looks a little bit
rowdy<00:01:59.280> ratty<00:01:59.880> I<00:02:00.030> just<00:02:00.299> kind<00:02:00.450> of<00:02:00.479> trim<00:02:00.689> it<00:02:00.719> down

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
rowdy ratty I just kind of trim it down

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.780 
rowdy ratty I just kind of trim it down
and<00:02:01.140> even<00:02:01.229> it<00:02:01.590> out<00:02:01.740> and<00:02:02.250> as<00:02:02.340> soon<00:02:02.520> as<00:02:02.610> the

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
and even it out and as soon as the

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.090 
and even it out and as soon as the
blooms<00:02:03.060> are<00:02:03.360> done<00:02:03.570> -<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.560> best<00:02:04.740> thing<00:02:04.920> you<00:02:04.979> can

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
blooms are done - the best thing you can

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.249 
blooms are done - the best thing you can
do<00:02:05.189> is<00:02:05.280> pinch<00:02:05.549> them<00:02:05.700> off<00:02:05.850> some<00:02:06.630> people<00:02:06.930> say<00:02:07.020> cut

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
do is pinch them off some people say cut

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.290 
do is pinch them off some people say cut
them<00:02:07.380> off<00:02:07.500> or<00:02:07.770> pinch<00:02:08.310> them<00:02:08.489> off<00:02:08.580> right<00:02:08.970> as<00:02:09.149> they

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
them off or pinch them off right as they

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.390 
them off or pinch them off right as they
turn<00:02:09.539> dry<00:02:09.869> and<00:02:10.200> then<00:02:10.679> that<00:02:10.920> way<00:02:11.099> you'll<00:02:11.280> get

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
turn dry and then that way you'll get

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.490 
turn dry and then that way you'll get
more<00:02:11.670> blooms<00:02:11.940> for<00:02:12.300> the<00:02:12.360> next<00:02:12.629> year<00:02:12.840> but

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
more blooms for the next year but

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.070 
more blooms for the next year but
attitude<00:02:13.950> about<00:02:14.100> most<00:02:14.430> plants<00:02:14.940> is<00:02:15.060> they<00:02:15.840> grow

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
attitude about most plants is they grow

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.660 
attitude about most plants is they grow
in<00:02:16.230> the<00:02:16.320> forest<00:02:16.650> without<00:02:16.800> anyone<00:02:17.310> pinching

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
in the forest without anyone pinching

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.580 
in the forest without anyone pinching
them<00:02:17.790> down<00:02:17.940> or<00:02:18.180> anyone<00:02:18.450> really<00:02:18.690> taking<00:02:19.440> care

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
them down or anyone really taking care

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.050 
them down or anyone really taking care
of<00:02:19.650> them<00:02:19.830> as<00:02:19.950> long<00:02:20.070> as<00:02:20.250> they<00:02:20.340> get<00:02:20.460> the<00:02:20.610> moisture

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
of them as long as they get the moisture

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.550 
of them as long as they get the moisture
and<00:02:21.240> the<00:02:21.330> right<00:02:21.480> conditions<00:02:22.020> they'll<00:02:22.230> do<00:02:22.380> well

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
and the right conditions they'll do well

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.500 
and the right conditions they'll do well
in<00:02:22.800> your<00:02:23.220> garden<00:02:23.610> just<00:02:23.940> as<00:02:24.060> they<00:02:24.180> do<00:02:24.240> in<00:02:24.330> the

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
in your garden just as they do in the

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.660 
in your garden just as they do in the
wild
