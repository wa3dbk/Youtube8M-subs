00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:06.299
 hello to all we will see in this 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:09.750
 first real time how to download 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:12.509
 and install an adventure map so 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:15.290
 first step you type matchcraft 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.290
 point fr 

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:27.470
 it's a pretty adventure map site 

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:32.030
 complete I did not know go there 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:32.030
 you then select a category 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:39.380
 4 categories we can see there I go them 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.380
 hardship 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:49.690
 then there is a map list that you 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:52.230
 can download for example I 'm going 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:59.200
 download any case part 1 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:01:01.750
 here is a presentation description you 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:04.420
 look at it a little bit after that 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:07.720
 you download it then there first 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:10.450
 launch the author's link the second 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.810
 well this is the link of the site 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.810
 bob kraft 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.740
 you download 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:26.840
 so here you wait a little bit 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:26.840
 so amap is downloading 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.810
 so here is the map is it is loaded 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:51.300
 then you go to 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:57.400
 location 12 the cetacean file 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:59.580
 ended up so the way the talqa hop 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:07.290
 I right click 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:07.290
 tolkien lapel extract 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:14.900
 you get a double talk folder you 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:17.520
 click on it 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.800
 then another folder appears in 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.140
 General where there may be a pack 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:25.560
 of textures either notes that the author 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:30.480
 added so you check well that 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:32.430
 in this case there is it's on 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.459
 the oc level point data the little ones 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:39.209
 folders that are necessary to play 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:44.720
 at this map so you check that 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:47.670
 it is this folder made a copy 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:51.690
 here 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:57.930
 then you make yourself a windows more 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:03:00.959
 and makes you windows + r so the windows 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:06.410
 is between the key fn and stop 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:13.069
 on my keyboard so windows do more 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:16.560
 you type a percent slot ap data % 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:18.890
 like this you do 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.890
 okay 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:25.050
 logically you will have your file 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:26.819
 for minecraft that interests us so 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:30.480
 there I advise you to do it a 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:32.130
 copy a little copy paste on 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.610
 your office like that will have you in courcy 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:36.780
 will be much faster to install or 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.700
 of our texture packs or 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:42.739
 new maps will be much simpler 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:45.390
 there I do it here or double click and 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:46.519
 you have several folders and the 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:50.670
 folder that will interest us 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:52.950
 today is the double cei folder 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:56.150
 click and you can see maps 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:59.370
 already installed so we had it done 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:04.049
 we had taken our maps the folder that 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:06.380
 we are interested we make a copy we do 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:06.380
 a collar 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:11.250
 There you go 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:11.250
 you have your mac to install 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:14.790
 now 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:23.519
 we will see if the map is well installed 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:43.270
 so that's my texture pack 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:49.160

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:54.730

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:01.910
