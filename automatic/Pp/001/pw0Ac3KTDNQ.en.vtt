00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
to be able to something slightly more I

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:08.899 
to be able to something slightly more I
think<00:01:07.979> I<00:01:08.159> probably<00:01:08.250> been<00:01:08.520> a<00:01:08.549> bit<00:01:08.729> too

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
think I probably been a bit too

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.450 
think I probably been a bit too
ambitious<00:01:09.360> with<00:01:09.540> this<00:01:09.780> one<00:01:10.010> but<00:01:11.010> you<00:01:11.130> know<00:01:11.250> it

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
ambitious with this one but you know it

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.510 
ambitious with this one but you know it
doesn't<00:01:11.670> matter<00:01:11.790> two<00:01:12.510> three<00:01:12.960> I<00:01:13.229> think<00:01:13.950> three<00:01:14.280> I

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
doesn't matter two three I think three I

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.039 
doesn't matter two three I think three I
think<00:01:14.580> three<00:01:15.060> high<00:01:15.180> is<00:01:15.240> enough<00:01:15.509> yeah

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
think three high is enough yeah

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.690 
think three high is enough yeah
and<00:01:16.350> then<00:01:16.560> we<00:01:16.619> could<00:01:16.740> put<00:01:16.799> like<00:01:16.920> a<00:01:16.979> scarf

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
and then we could put like a scarf

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.310 
and then we could put like a scarf
around<00:01:17.880> it<00:01:18.150> or<00:01:18.270> something<00:01:18.600> yeah<00:01:18.900> that'd<00:01:19.170> be

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
around it or something yeah that'd be

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:19.999 
around it or something yeah that'd be
awesome

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009
