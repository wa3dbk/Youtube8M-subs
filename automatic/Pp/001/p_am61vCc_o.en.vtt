this<00:00:00.870> is<00:00:01.050> going<00:00:01.230> to<00:00:01.350> be<00:00:01.439> the<00:00:01.530> first<00:00:01.680> block

00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:01.949 
this is going to be the first block

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:04.610 
this is going to be the first block
tutorial<00:00:02.460> video<00:00:02.730> now<00:00:03.629> despite<00:00:04.049> this<00:00:04.170> being<00:00:04.230> a

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620 
tutorial video now despite this being a

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.530 
tutorial video now despite this being a
tutorial<00:00:04.980> video<00:00:05.310> I<00:00:05.640> can't<00:00:05.970> really<00:00:06.150> teach

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
tutorial video I can't really teach

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.240 
tutorial video I can't really teach
block<00:00:06.990> bullying<00:00:07.319> because<00:00:07.620> it's<00:00:07.859> more<00:00:08.040> of<00:00:08.130> a

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
block bullying because it's more of a

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.450 
block bullying because it's more of a
conceptual<00:00:08.910> thing<00:00:09.320> so<00:00:10.320> I<00:00:10.349> guess<00:00:10.650> I<00:00:10.920> can<00:00:11.250> give

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
conceptual thing so I guess I can give

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.999 
conceptual thing so I guess I can give
you<00:00:11.610> guys<00:00:11.639> the<00:00:12.150> basic<00:00:12.929> idea<00:00:13.230> on<00:00:13.500> how<00:00:13.710> to<00:00:13.740> build

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
you guys the basic idea on how to build

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.939 
you guys the basic idea on how to build
blocks<00:00:14.400> and<00:00:15.170> even<00:00:16.170> if<00:00:16.350> you<00:00:16.440> guys<00:00:16.560> can<00:00:16.800> figure

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
blocks and even if you guys can figure

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.070 
blocks and even if you guys can figure
it<00:00:17.250> out<00:00:17.369> from<00:00:17.550> there

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:18.080 
it out from there

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.870 
it out from there
so<00:00:19.080> a<00:00:19.109> few<00:00:19.560> things<00:00:19.830> that<00:00:20.340> you<00:00:20.490> need<00:00:20.520> to<00:00:20.670> know

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
so a few things that you need to know

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.120 
so a few things that you need to know
about<00:00:21.090> rue<00:00:21.390> blocks<00:00:21.689> is<00:00:21.990> that<00:00:22.289> there's<00:00:22.650> a<00:00:22.800> heavy

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
about rue blocks is that there's a heavy

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.330 
about rue blocks is that there's a heavy
reliance<00:00:23.400> on<00:00:24.199> an<00:00:25.199> moves<00:00:25.619> if<00:00:25.890> you<00:00:26.010> watched<00:00:26.189> my

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
reliance on an moves if you watched my

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.859 
reliance on an moves if you watched my
overview<00:00:26.849> video<00:00:27.390> you<00:00:27.480> saw<00:00:28.019> that<00:00:28.380> a<00:00:28.849> lot<00:00:29.849> of<00:00:30.150> the

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
overview video you saw that a lot of the

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.620 
overview video you saw that a lot of the
M<00:00:31.320> slices<00:00:31.890> common<00:00:32.279> last<00:00:32.460> six<00:00:32.730> edges<00:00:33.090> but<00:00:33.390> it's

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
M slices common last six edges but it's

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.780 
M slices common last six edges but it's
also<00:00:33.870> very<00:00:34.050> crucial<00:00:34.590> to<00:00:34.710> be<00:00:34.829> doing<00:00:35.100> M<00:00:35.250> moves<00:00:35.520> in

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
also very crucial to be doing M moves in

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.209 
also very crucial to be doing M moves in
block<00:00:36.630> building<00:00:36.930> and<00:00:37.140> I<00:00:37.500> guess<00:00:37.710> I'll<00:00:37.890> go<00:00:38.040> over

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
block building and I guess I'll go over

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.940 
block building and I guess I'll go over
that<00:00:38.399> yourself<00:00:39.290> the<00:00:40.290> easiest<00:00:40.590> way<00:00:40.770> to<00:00:40.800> show

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
that yourself the easiest way to show

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.280 
that yourself the easiest way to show
you<00:00:41.160> how<00:00:41.460> I<00:00:41.489> build<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:42.000> 1<00:00:42.180> by<00:00:42.300> 2<00:00:42.329> by<00:00:42.660> 3<00:00:42.899> block<00:00:43.140> on

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
you how I build the 1 by 2 by 3 block on

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.889 
you how I build the 1 by 2 by 3 block on
the<00:00:43.350> left<00:00:43.530> side<00:00:43.739> is<00:00:44.280> by<00:00:44.460> example<00:00:45.000> but<00:00:45.539> before<00:00:45.870> I

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
the left side is by example but before I

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.119 
the left side is by example but before I
do<00:00:45.989> that<00:00:46.140> I<00:00:46.320> need<00:00:46.469> to<00:00:46.590> explain<00:00:46.860> a<00:00:46.920> few<00:00:47.010> things

00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:49.129 
do that I need to explain a few things

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:52.580 
do that I need to explain a few things
first<00:00:50.129> I<00:00:50.489> like<00:00:50.760> to<00:00:50.879> make<00:00:51.030> a<00:00:51.180> 1<00:00:51.510> by<00:00:51.780> 2<00:00:51.840> by<00:00:52.260> 2<00:00:52.289> block

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
first I like to make a 1 by 2 by 2 block

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.319 
first I like to make a 1 by 2 by 2 block
now<00:00:52.860> 1<00:00:53.100> by<00:00:53.219> 2<00:00:53.280> by<00:00:53.550> 2<00:00:53.579> blocks<00:00:53.969> should<00:00:54.120> look

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
now 1 by 2 by 2 blocks should look

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.380 
now 1 by 2 by 2 blocks should look
something<00:00:54.780> like<00:00:54.809> this<00:00:55.910> this<00:00:56.910> right<00:00:57.180> here

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
something like this this right here

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.319 
something like this this right here
where<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.260> 1<00:00:58.410> by<00:00:58.559> 2<00:00:58.620> by<00:00:58.859> 2<00:00:58.890> block<00:00:59.190> is<00:00:59.520> just<00:00:59.730> a<00:00:59.879> 1

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
where the 1 by 2 by 2 block is just a 1

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.470 
where the 1 by 2 by 2 block is just a 1
by<00:01:00.719> 2<00:01:00.780> by<00:01:01.260> 2<00:01:01.289> block<00:01:01.620> and<00:01:01.920> then<00:01:02.820> I'll<00:01:03.059> take<00:01:03.270> that

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
by 2 by 2 block and then I'll take that

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.780 
by 2 by 2 block and then I'll take that
and<00:01:03.750> then<00:01:03.989> expand<00:01:04.379> it<00:01:04.530> to<00:01:04.559> a<00:01:04.710> 1<00:01:04.890> by<00:01:05.010> 2<00:01:05.070> by<00:01:05.309> 3<00:01:05.580> and

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
and then expand it to a 1 by 2 by 3 and

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.460 
and then expand it to a 1 by 2 by 3 and
you'll<00:01:06.330> see<00:01:06.540> that<00:01:06.689> throughout<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:07.200> entire

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
you'll see that throughout the entire

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.190 
you'll see that throughout the entire
tutorial<00:01:08.280> so<00:01:09.210> I'm<00:01:09.479> going<00:01:09.659> to<00:01:09.720> go<00:01:09.780> ahead<00:01:09.900> and<00:01:10.110> do

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
tutorial so I'm going to go ahead and do

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.770 
tutorial so I'm going to go ahead and do
a<00:01:10.229> really<00:01:10.710> quick<00:01:10.830> example<00:01:11.040> of<00:01:11.640> that<00:01:11.790> and<00:01:12.600> I'll

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
a really quick example of that and I'll

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.450 
a really quick example of that and I'll
be<00:01:12.930> posting<00:01:13.049> this<00:01:13.729> scramble<00:01:14.780> on<00:01:16.369> pretty<00:01:17.369> much

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
be posting this scramble on pretty much

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:30.300 
be posting this scramble on pretty much
here<00:01:27.380> ok

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310 
here ok

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.170 
here ok
so<00:01:31.470> because<00:01:32.470> I'm<00:01:32.680> keeping<00:01:33.130> it<00:01:33.340> that<00:01:33.610> green<00:01:33.880> as

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:34.180 
so because I'm keeping it that green as

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:35.700 
so because I'm keeping it that green as
on<00:01:34.299> left<00:01:34.510> I'm<00:01:34.659> going<00:01:34.900> to<00:01:34.990> go<00:01:35.140> ahead<00:01:35.260> and<00:01:35.530> keep

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710 
on left I'm going to go ahead and keep

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.660 
on left I'm going to go ahead and keep
green<00:01:36.190> on<00:01:36.280> left<00:01:36.490> so<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:38.770> easiest<00:01:39.009> way<00:01:39.130> to<00:01:39.490> make

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:39.670 
green on left so the easiest way to make

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.149 
green on left so the easiest way to make
a<00:01:39.729> 1<00:01:40.000> by<00:01:40.119> 2<00:01:40.180> by<00:01:40.420> 2<00:01:40.450> is<00:01:41.140> to<00:01:41.500> make<00:01:41.619> a<00:01:41.650> corner<00:01:42.009> edge

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:42.159 
a 1 by 2 by 2 is to make a corner edge

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:45.870 
a 1 by 2 by 2 is to make a corner edge
pair<00:01:42.520> and<00:01:42.759> inserting<00:01:43.450> the<00:01:43.570> edge<00:01:44.280> so<00:01:45.280> I<00:01:45.520> would

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 
pair and inserting the edge so I would

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.330 
pair and inserting the edge so I would
make<00:01:46.000> a<00:01:46.030> corner<00:01:46.390> in<00:01:46.479> edge<00:01:46.630> pair<00:01:46.990> first<00:01:47.530> now<00:01:48.130> I

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
make a corner in edge pair first now I

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.370 
make a corner in edge pair first now I
see<00:01:48.640> that<00:01:48.670> this<00:01:49.030> corner<00:01:49.420> and<00:01:49.570> this<00:01:49.840> edge<00:01:50.080> would

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
see that this corner and this edge would

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.859 
see that this corner and this edge would
make<00:01:50.560> a<00:01:50.590> corner<00:01:50.950> edge<00:01:51.100> pair<00:01:51.369> really<00:01:52.119> easily<00:01:52.479> so

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:52.869 
make a corner edge pair really easily so

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:55.050 
make a corner edge pair really easily so
I<00:01:52.899> would<00:01:53.140> go<00:01:53.259> ahead<00:01:53.290> and<00:01:53.710> do<00:01:54.190> that<00:01:54.220> and<00:01:54.580> for

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
I would go ahead and do that and for

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.639 
I would go ahead and do that and for
that<00:01:55.270> I<00:01:55.509> would<00:01:55.659> just<00:01:55.840> do<00:01:56.049> like<00:01:56.710> this<00:01:56.860> I<00:01:58.619> use<00:01:59.619> a

00:01:59.639 --> 00:01:59.649 
that I would just do like this I use a

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:02.010 
that I would just do like this I use a
lot<00:01:59.860> of<00:01:59.890> em<00:02:00.100> slices<00:02:00.640> and<00:02:00.940> block<00:02:01.330> buildings<00:02:01.750> so

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
lot of em slices and block buildings so

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.080 
lot of em slices and block buildings so
that's<00:02:02.530> really<00:02:02.860> really<00:02:03.100> normal<00:02:03.490> and<00:02:04.170> yeah<00:02:05.170> I

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
that's really really normal and yeah I

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.240 
that's really really normal and yeah I
would<00:02:07.090> then<00:02:07.330> insert<00:02:07.840> the<00:02:08.410> edge<00:02:08.590> that<00:02:09.039> goes

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
would then insert the edge that goes

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:10.979 
would then insert the edge that goes
with<00:02:09.489> the<00:02:09.550> corner<00:02:09.850> edge<00:02:09.970> pair<00:02:10.300> and<00:02:10.509> the<00:02:10.600> center

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:10.989 
with the corner edge pair and the center

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:14.340 
with the corner edge pair and the center
so<00:02:11.920> I<00:02:12.250> would<00:02:12.940> just<00:02:12.970> do<00:02:13.360> something<00:02:13.989> like<00:02:14.050> a<00:02:14.110> nap

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
so I would just do something like a nap

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:19.930 
so I would just do something like a nap
-<00:02:14.890> like<00:02:15.130> that<00:02:15.930> no<00:02:16.930> priority

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.450 

okay<00:02:20.630> so<00:02:21.110> here's<00:02:21.350> a<00:02:21.410> pair<00:02:21.620> that<00:02:21.650> we<00:02:21.860> made<00:02:22.040> but

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:22.460 
okay so here's a pair that we made but

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:23.800 
okay so here's a pair that we made but
while<00:02:22.730> doing<00:02:22.850> that<00:02:23.000> we<00:02:23.240> also<00:02:23.360> made<00:02:23.630> another

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
while doing that we also made another

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.580 
while doing that we also made another
pair<00:02:24.320> in<00:02:24.350> the<00:02:24.530> back<00:02:24.680> over<00:02:24.890> here<00:02:25.390> so<00:02:26.390> I<00:02:26.690> would

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
pair in the back over here so I would

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.350 
pair in the back over here so I would
first<00:02:27.800> insert<00:02:28.280> this<00:02:28.490> pair<00:02:28.790> that<00:02:29.030> when<00:02:29.150> I<00:02:29.180> was

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
first insert this pair that when I was

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:35.170 
first insert this pair that when I was
making<00:02:29.800> and<00:02:31.300> here<00:02:32.300> you<00:02:32.480> have<00:02:32.690> a<00:02:32.900> 1<00:02:33.350> by<00:02:34.070> 2<00:02:34.150> by<00:02:35.150> 2

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
making and here you have a 1 by 2 by 2

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.530 
making and here you have a 1 by 2 by 2
block<00:02:35.630> and<00:02:36.550> if<00:02:37.550> you<00:02:37.670> didn't<00:02:37.910> already<00:02:38.000> we<00:02:38.420> would

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
block and if you didn't already we would

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.930 
block and if you didn't already we would
make<00:02:38.750> this<00:02:38.930> pair<00:02:39.260> right<00:02:39.980> here<00:02:40.370> and<00:02:40.550> then

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
make this pair right here and then

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.090 
make this pair right here and then
insert<00:02:41.360> it<00:02:41.480> over<00:02:41.750> here<00:02:41.990> since<00:02:42.650> this<00:02:42.770> pair<00:02:42.980> has

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100 
insert it over here since this pair has

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:44.380 
insert it over here since this pair has
already<00:02:43.340> made<00:02:43.460> all<00:02:43.700> you<00:02:43.790> would<00:02:43.910> have<00:02:44.000> to<00:02:44.060> do<00:02:44.270> is

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
already made all you would have to do is

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:49.180 
already made all you would have to do is
just<00:02:44.510> insert<00:02:44.930> like<00:02:45.110> that<00:02:47.470> now<00:02:48.470> that<00:02:48.680> 1<00:02:48.800> by<00:02:48.920> 2<00:02:48.980> by

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
just insert like that now that 1 by 2 by

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.520 
just insert like that now that 1 by 2 by
2<00:02:49.220> block<00:02:49.520> didn't<00:02:50.150> really<00:02:50.420> have<00:02:50.630> to<00:02:51.020> you<00:02:51.440> know

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
2 block didn't really have to you know

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.830 
2 block didn't really have to you know
start<00:02:51.950> at<00:02:52.160> the<00:02:52.250> back<00:02:52.430> like<00:02:52.670> I<00:02:52.940> did<00:02:53.480> for<00:02:53.660> this

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
start at the back like I did for this

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.260 
start at the back like I did for this
example<00:02:54.200> solve<00:02:54.530> like<00:02:54.890> this<00:02:55.100> it<00:02:55.730> also<00:02:55.880> started

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:56.270 
example solve like this it also started

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:59.470 
example solve like this it also started
the<00:02:56.360> front<00:02:56.570> like<00:02:56.720> this<00:02:56.930> where<00:02:58.270> it<00:02:59.270> would<00:02:59.360> look

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
the front like this where it would look

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.940 
the front like this where it would look
something<00:02:59.630> like<00:02:59.840> this<00:03:00.110> where<00:03:01.070> you<00:03:01.160> have<00:03:01.400> the<00:03:02.950> 1

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
something like this where you have the 1

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.880 
something like this where you have the 1
by<00:03:04.070> 2<00:03:04.130> by<00:03:04.460> 2<00:03:04.490> block<00:03:05.170> based<00:03:06.170> around<00:03:06.380> the<00:03:06.500> front<00:03:06.740> 2

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890 
by 2 by 2 block based around the front 2

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.880 
by 2 by 2 block based around the front 2
Q<00:03:07.160> and<00:03:07.400> then<00:03:08.030> you<00:03:08.150> would<00:03:08.300> make<00:03:08.510> that<00:03:08.570> pair<00:03:09.020> like

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:09.890 
Q and then you would make that pair like

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:13.510 
Q and then you would make that pair like
I<00:03:10.510> would<00:03:11.510> right<00:03:11.720> here<00:03:11.960> and<00:03:12.140> just<00:03:12.860> insert<00:03:13.280> like

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:13.520 
I would right here and just insert like

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:18.970 
I would right here and just insert like
that<00:03:15.160> or<00:03:16.540> if<00:03:17.540> you<00:03:17.690> had<00:03:17.780> the<00:03:18.200> case<00:03:18.470> where<00:03:18.890> you

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
that or if you had the case where you

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.670 
that or if you had the case where you
had<00:03:19.160> it<00:03:19.280> in<00:03:19.370> the<00:03:19.490> back<00:03:20.020> you<00:03:21.020> can<00:03:21.170> make<00:03:21.320> the<00:03:21.410> pair

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
had it in the back you can make the pair

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.970 
had it in the back you can make the pair
and<00:03:22.550> then<00:03:22.730> you<00:03:22.850> insert<00:03:23.260> now<00:03:24.260> both<00:03:24.470> ways<00:03:24.770> are

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
and then you insert now both ways are

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.070 
and then you insert now both ways are
pretty<00:03:25.610> much<00:03:25.760> valid<00:03:26.180> and<00:03:26.420> it<00:03:26.630> will<00:03:26.750> really

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:27.080 
pretty much valid and it will really

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.650 
pretty much valid and it will really
help<00:03:27.260> you<00:03:27.380> when<00:03:28.310> block<00:03:28.670> making<00:03:29.420> the<00:03:29.480> first

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:29.660 
help you when block making the first

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:31.420 
help you when block making the first
block<00:03:29.900> in<00:03:30.080> room<00:03:30.260> so<00:03:31.010> I'm<00:03:31.100> going<00:03:31.220> to<00:03:31.280> go<00:03:31.370> ahead

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
block in room so I'm going to go ahead

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:50.420 
block in room so I'm going to go ahead
and<00:03:31.640> do<00:03:31.760> another<00:03:31.790> example<00:03:32.060> solve

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.800 

so<00:03:51.430> when<00:03:51.579> making<00:03:51.760> the<00:03:52.000> first<00:03:52.209> block<00:03:52.450> in<00:03:52.629> room

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
so when making the first block in room

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.369 
so when making the first block in room
and<00:03:53.159> making<00:03:54.159> the<00:03:54.250> 1<00:03:54.400> by<00:03:54.519> 2<00:03:54.549> by<00:03:54.879> 2<00:03:54.909> I<00:03:55.349> said<00:03:56.349> I

00:03:56.369 --> 00:03:56.379 
and making the 1 by 2 by 2 I said I

00:03:56.379 --> 00:03:58.199 
and making the 1 by 2 by 2 I said I
really<00:03:56.739> like<00:03:56.829> making<00:03:57.340> a<00:03:57.459> corner<00:03:57.790> edge<00:03:57.939> pair

00:03:58.199 --> 00:03:58.209 
really like making a corner edge pair

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:00.089 
really like making a corner edge pair
and<00:03:58.329> then<00:03:58.420> inserting<00:03:58.989> another<00:03:59.140> edge<00:03:59.560> to<00:03:59.859> make

00:04:00.089 --> 00:04:00.099 
and then inserting another edge to make

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:03.660 
and then inserting another edge to make
it<00:04:00.359> make<00:04:01.359> the<00:04:01.659> 1<00:04:01.840> by<00:04:01.959> 2<00:04:02.019> by<00:04:02.230> 2<00:04:02.370> corner<00:04:03.370> edge

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
it make the 1 by 2 by 2 corner edge

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:05.550 
it make the 1 by 2 by 2 corner edge
doesn't<00:04:04.060> necessarily<00:04:04.540> mean<00:04:04.719> that<00:04:04.750> it<00:04:05.260> has<00:04:05.409> to

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 
doesn't necessarily mean that it has to

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:10.080 
doesn't necessarily mean that it has to
be<00:04:05.680> a<00:04:06.180> f2l<00:04:07.180> style<00:04:08.129> corner<00:04:09.129> edge<00:04:09.250> pair<00:04:09.549> now<00:04:10.000> an

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090 
be a f2l style corner edge pair now an

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:11.339 
be a f2l style corner edge pair now an
f2<00:04:10.329> I'll<00:04:10.450> corner<00:04:10.780> edge<00:04:10.959> pair<00:04:11.200> would<00:04:11.290> be

00:04:11.339 --> 00:04:11.349 
f2 I'll corner edge pair would be

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:16.199 
f2 I'll corner edge pair would be
something<00:04:11.739> like<00:04:12.750> these<00:04:13.750> two<00:04:13.959> pieces<00:04:15.209> put

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 
something like these two pieces put

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:18.979 
something like these two pieces put
together<00:04:16.359> and<00:04:16.810> then<00:04:17.259> put<00:04:17.560> in<00:04:17.799> to<00:04:18.310> the<00:04:18.400> cross

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
together and then put in to the cross

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:25.409 
together and then put in to the cross
instead<00:04:19.989> in<00:04:20.199> rew<00:04:20.380> it<00:04:20.829> can<00:04:21.570> something<00:04:22.570> like<00:04:24.419> you

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:25.419 
instead in rew it can something like you

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:29.310 
instead in rew it can something like you
just<00:04:25.630> find<00:04:25.900> it<00:04:26.080> quick<00:04:26.560> okay<00:04:27.570> Andrew<00:04:28.570> it<00:04:28.930> can<00:04:29.199> be

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:29.320 
just find it quick okay Andrew it can be

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.950 
just find it quick okay Andrew it can be
something<00:04:29.560> like<00:04:29.830> this<00:04:30.060> where<00:04:31.060> is<00:04:31.270> a<00:04:31.660> corner

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:31.960 
something like this where is a corner

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:36.240 
something like this where is a corner
edge<00:04:32.110> pair<00:04:32.440> but<00:04:32.740> it<00:04:32.979> belongs<00:04:33.340> here<00:04:33.990> in<00:04:35.250> this

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.250 
edge pair but it belongs here in this

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:39.120 
edge pair but it belongs here in this
slot<00:04:36.639> on<00:04:36.940> the<00:04:37.660> bottom<00:04:37.960> and<00:04:38.139> then<00:04:38.919> you<00:04:39.009> would

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.130 
slot on the bottom and then you would

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:40.800 
slot on the bottom and then you would
just<00:04:39.160> insert<00:04:39.610> the<00:04:39.759> edge<00:04:39.849> that<00:04:40.060> goes<00:04:40.210> here<00:04:40.570> to

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810 
just insert the edge that goes here to

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:44.279 
just insert the edge that goes here to
complete<00:04:41.289> the<00:04:41.740> 1<00:04:41.949> by<00:04:42.099> 2<00:04:42.130> by<00:04:42.430> 2<00:04:42.660> so<00:04:43.660> for<00:04:44.139> your

00:04:44.279 --> 00:04:44.289 
complete the 1 by 2 by 2 so for your

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:47.340 
complete the 1 by 2 by 2 so for your
nose

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:47.350 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:49.950 

like<00:04:47.860> so<00:04:48.070> that<00:04:48.970> completes<00:04:49.360> the<00:04:49.420> one<00:04:49.570> by<00:04:49.690> two<00:04:49.750> by

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:49.960 
like so that completes the one by two by

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.070 
like so that completes the one by two by
two<00:04:50.020> and<00:04:50.320> then<00:04:51.220> all<00:04:51.790> you<00:04:52.000> have<00:04:52.210> to<00:04:52.240> do<00:04:52.450> next<00:04:52.660> is

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080 
two and then all you have to do next is

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.520 
two and then all you have to do next is
just<00:04:53.170> insert<00:04:54.450> or<00:04:55.450> rather<00:04:55.840> make<00:04:56.110> that<00:04:56.290> pair

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:56.530 
just insert or rather make that pair

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:00.420 
just insert or rather make that pair
first<00:04:56.800> and<00:04:57.070> then<00:04:57.370> insert<00:04:58.800> to<00:04:59.800> make<00:04:59.950> the<00:05:00.070> 1<00:05:00.220> by<00:05:00.370> 2

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:00.430 
first and then insert to make the 1 by 2

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:02.910 
first and then insert to make the 1 by 2
by<00:05:00.700> 3<00:05:00.970> in<00:05:01.090> the<00:05:01.600> description<00:05:02.110> I've<00:05:02.260> linked<00:05:02.710> a
