00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
I'm going to go out on a limb and call

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:37.710 
I'm going to go out on a limb and call
this<00:02:31.370> the<00:02:31.550> battery<00:02:33.970> very<00:02:34.970> straightforward

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.310 

this<00:02:38.720> is<00:02:39.020> the<00:02:39.410> power<00:02:39.710> supply<00:02:40.870> it<00:02:41.870> has<00:02:42.020> to<00:02:42.200> be

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:42.320 
this is the power supply it has to be

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:43.930 
this is the power supply it has to be
the<00:02:42.440> brightest<00:02:42.950> power<00:02:43.160> supply<00:02:43.580> I've<00:02:43.730> ever

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
the brightest power supply I've ever

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.470 
the brightest power supply I've ever
seen<00:02:44.180> look<00:02:44.360> at<00:02:44.450> that<00:02:44.570> lime<00:02:45.230> green<00:02:46.240> that<00:02:47.240> means

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
seen look at that lime green that means

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:56.050 
seen look at that lime green that means
children<00:02:50.230> and<00:02:51.460> left<00:02:52.460> we<00:02:53.180> have<00:02:53.390> the<00:02:54.610> PC<00:02:55.610> itself

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
children and left we have the PC itself

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.260 
children and left we have the PC itself
let's<00:02:56.890> break<00:02:57.890> it<00:02:58.040> out<00:02:58.130> of<00:02:58.250> these<00:02:58.370> egg<00:02:58.850> carton

00:02:59.260 --> 00:02:59.270 
let's break it out of these egg carton

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:01.810 
let's break it out of these egg carton
things<00:02:59.770> and<00:03:00.770> put<00:03:00.980> that<00:03:01.130> off<00:03:01.280> to<00:03:01.310> the<00:03:01.490> side

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:01.820 
things and put that off to the side

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:05.440 
things and put that off to the side
there<00:03:02.530> all<00:03:03.530> right<00:03:03.680> so<00:03:03.940> you<00:03:04.940> should<00:03:05.120> recycle

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
there all right so you should recycle

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.300 
there all right so you should recycle
this<00:03:05.810> you<00:03:06.170> should<00:03:06.380> not<00:03:06.560> suffocate<00:03:07.160> yourself

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
this you should not suffocate yourself

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:10.240 
this you should not suffocate yourself
with<00:03:07.850> it<00:03:07.970> and<00:03:08.440> don't<00:03:09.440> put<00:03:09.620> it<00:03:09.650> on<00:03:09.800> your<00:03:09.860> baby's

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
with it and don't put it on your baby's

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.420 
with it and don't put it on your baby's
head<00:03:10.430> as<00:03:10.790> it's<00:03:11.030> crawling<00:03:11.330> around<00:03:12.220> once<00:03:13.220> you

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
head as it's crawling around once you

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.960 
head as it's crawling around once you
agree<00:03:13.730> to<00:03:13.940> those<00:03:14.060> terms<00:03:14.120> of<00:03:14.630> service<00:03:15.110> and

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
agree to those terms of service and

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:24.040 
agree to those terms of service and
remove<00:03:16.970> it<00:03:20.470> and<00:03:21.470> there<00:03:21.709> that<00:03:21.890> is<00:03:22.090> so<00:03:23.090> and

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:24.050 
remove it and there that is so and

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:26.949 
remove it and there that is so and
actually<00:03:24.530> this<00:03:24.740> these<00:03:25.490> two<00:03:25.760> things<00:03:26.030> here<00:03:26.420> will

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 
actually this these two things here will

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:29.650 
actually this these two things here will
be<00:03:27.110> different<00:03:27.470> colors<00:03:27.800> depending<00:03:28.610> on<00:03:29.030> what<00:03:29.300> PC

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:29.660 
be different colors depending on what PC

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:31.840 
be different colors depending on what PC
you<00:03:29.810> get<00:03:30.020> and<00:03:30.230> the<00:03:30.890> reason<00:03:31.220> they<00:03:31.340> did<00:03:31.580> that<00:03:31.610> is

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:31.850 
you get and the reason they did that is

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:35.650 
you get and the reason they did that is
because<00:03:32.230> it's<00:03:33.230> a<00:03:33.320> way<00:03:33.470> to<00:03:33.530> differentiate<00:03:34.660> the

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
because it's a way to differentiate the

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:37.390 
because it's a way to differentiate the
computers<00:03:36.080> from<00:03:36.170> each<00:03:36.350> other<00:03:36.530> so<00:03:36.740> that<00:03:36.920> when

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 
computers from each other so that when

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.290 
computers from each other so that when
you<00:03:37.490> have<00:03:37.640> a<00:03:37.670> classroom<00:03:38.060> full<00:03:38.660> of<00:03:38.810> 30<00:03:39.080> kids<00:03:40.300> the

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:41.300 
you have a classroom full of 30 kids the

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:46.120 
you have a classroom full of 30 kids the
the<00:03:41.330> head<00:03:42.200> and<00:03:42.530> the<00:03:43.070> body<00:03:43.370> of<00:03:44.500> this<00:03:45.500> logo<00:03:45.950> will

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:46.130 
the head and the body of this logo will

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:48.449 
the head and the body of this logo will
be<00:03:46.220> different<00:03:46.550> colors<00:03:46.640> for<00:03:46.880> each<00:03:46.970> kid<00:03:47.269> so

00:03:48.449 --> 00:03:48.459 
be different colors for each kid so

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:53.770 
be different colors for each kid so
easier<00:03:49.459> to<00:03:50.380> avoid<00:03:51.380> them<00:03:51.620> getting<00:03:51.860> mixed<00:03:52.040> up<00:03:52.780> on

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
easier to avoid them getting mixed up on

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.380 
easier to avoid them getting mixed up on
back<00:03:54.170> you<00:03:54.350> can<00:03:54.500> see<00:03:54.830> that<00:03:55.130> is<00:03:56.120> where<00:03:56.269> the

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:56.390 
back you can see that is where the

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:59.920 
back you can see that is where the
battery<00:03:56.780> slips<00:03:57.230> in<00:03:57.489> so<00:03:58.489> let's<00:03:58.700> just<00:03:59.000> go<00:03:59.900> ahead

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
battery slips in so let's just go ahead

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:05.320 
battery slips in so let's just go ahead
and<00:04:00.140> do<00:04:00.350> that<00:04:02.530> easy<00:04:03.530> enough<00:04:03.890> and<00:04:04.160> to<00:04:05.060> get<00:04:05.209> it

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:05.330 
and do that easy enough and to get it

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:07.900 
and do that easy enough and to get it
out<00:04:05.480> we<00:04:05.690> would<00:04:05.840> just<00:04:06.070> push<00:04:07.070> those<00:04:07.250> both<00:04:07.549> over

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:07.910 
out we would just push those both over

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:12.400 
out we would just push those both over
to<00:04:07.940> the<00:04:08.150> right<00:04:08.590> and<00:04:09.700> pull<00:04:10.750> somehow<00:04:11.750> and<00:04:12.200> if<00:04:12.290> you

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:12.410 
to the right and pull somehow and if you

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:16.390 
to the right and pull somehow and if you
need<00:04:12.590> nails<00:04:13.090> come<00:04:14.090> on<00:04:14.269> I<00:04:14.500> know<00:04:15.500> I<00:04:15.680> know<00:04:16.010> you<00:04:16.160> can

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
need nails come on I know I know you can

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.699 
need nails come on I know I know you can
do<00:04:16.519> it<00:04:16.700> come<00:04:17.120> on<00:04:17.390> there<00:04:18.320> we<00:04:18.410> go

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709 
do it come on there we go

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:20.440 
do it come on there we go
they<00:04:19.430> both<00:04:19.609> have<00:04:19.729> to<00:04:19.820> go<00:04:19.910> the<00:04:20.030> opposite

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:20.450 
they both have to go the opposite

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:23.230 
they both have to go the opposite
direction<00:04:20.510> I'm<00:04:21.080> sorry<00:04:21.410> my<00:04:21.830> bad<00:04:22.070> so<00:04:22.970> there<00:04:23.150> we

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:33.020 
way okay nice handle and let's open this

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:36.930 
way okay nice handle and let's open this
thing<00:04:33.080> up

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:36.940 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:38.770 

see<00:04:37.940> this<00:04:38.030> is<00:04:38.150> what<00:04:38.240> happens<00:04:38.509> when<00:04:38.569> you<00:04:38.660> don't

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:38.780 
see this is what happens when you don't

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:40.809 
see this is what happens when you don't
read<00:04:38.870> the<00:04:38.930> instructions<00:04:39.349> you<00:04:39.500> get<00:04:39.620> a<00:04:39.669> lift<00:04:40.669> up

00:04:40.809 --> 00:04:40.819 
read the instructions you get a lift up

00:04:40.819 --> 00:04:46.510 
read the instructions you get a lift up
the<00:04:40.910> antenna<00:04:43.210> and<00:04:44.210> there<00:04:44.389> we<00:04:44.509> go<00:04:45.220> so<00:04:46.220> there's

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:46.520 
the antenna and there we go so there's

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:50.439 
the antenna and there we go so there's
the<00:04:46.729> screen<00:04:48.400> with<00:04:49.400> some<00:04:49.610> controls<00:04:50.090> there

00:04:50.439 --> 00:04:50.449 
the screen with some controls there

00:04:50.449 --> 00:04:51.850 
the screen with some controls there
let's<00:04:50.750> see<00:04:50.870> if<00:04:50.960> we<00:04:51.050> can<00:04:51.169> turn<00:04:51.289> it<00:04:51.470> on<00:04:51.560> if<00:04:51.710> it's

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:51.860 
let's see if we can turn it on if it's

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:58.330 
let's see if we can turn it on if it's
if<00:04:52.400> it's<00:04:52.520> chips<00:04:52.789> charged<00:04:53.419> at<00:04:53.659> all<00:04:56.919> nice<00:04:57.919> chime

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:58.340 
if it's chips charged at all nice chime

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:59.980 
if it's chips charged at all nice chime
and<00:04:58.610> then<00:04:59.210> if<00:04:59.300> you<00:04:59.389> I<00:04:59.539> don't<00:04:59.659> know<00:04:59.780> if<00:04:59.840> you<00:04:59.900> can

00:04:59.980 --> 00:04:59.990 
and then if you I don't know if you can

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:01.390 
and then if you I don't know if you can
see<00:05:00.110> this<00:05:00.199> but<00:05:00.349> the<00:05:00.440> keyboard<00:05:00.860> is<00:05:01.039> actually

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:01.400 
see this but the keyboard is actually

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:05.860 
see this but the keyboard is actually
pretty<00:05:01.610> much<00:05:02.409> rubber<00:05:03.940> it's<00:05:04.940> really<00:05:05.479> easy<00:05:05.750> to
