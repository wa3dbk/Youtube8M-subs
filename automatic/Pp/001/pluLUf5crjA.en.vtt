so let's go inside the case right here
lets<00:01:11.170> you<00:01:11.320> see<00:01:11.469> it's<00:01:11.590> 25<00:01:11.950> centimeter<00:01:12.369> pin<00:01:12.899> open

00:01:13.889 --> 00:01:13.899 
lets you see it's 25 centimeter pin open

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:22.450 
lets you see it's 25 centimeter pin open
the<00:01:13.990> case<00:01:14.200> up<00:01:14.439> here<00:01:15.840> okay<00:01:18.179> let's<00:01:19.179> go<00:01:20.039> okay

see there's not a lot of wires hanging
out<00:01:30.950> just<00:01:31.190> the<00:01:32.030> core<00:01:32.270> ones<00:01:32.479> that<00:01:32.720> really<00:01:32.810> need

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:33.050 
out just the core ones that really need

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:36.840 
out just the core ones that really need
to<00:01:33.080> be<00:01:33.170> like<00:01:33.440> this<00:01:33.560> 24<00:01:34.220> pin<00:01:34.670> power<00:01:34.940> power<00:01:35.840> wire

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:36.850 
to be like this 24 pin power power wire

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.290 
to be like this 24 pin power power wire
okay<00:01:37.900> so<00:01:38.900> start<00:01:39.229> it's<00:01:39.590> got<00:01:39.830> these<00:01:40.490> two<00:01:41.000> little
