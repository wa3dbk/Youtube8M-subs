00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
don't like about them the cons so to

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.130 
don't like about them the cons so to

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.950

one<00:00:31.830> it's<00:00:32.189> too<00:00:32.759> thin<00:00:33.059> so<00:00:33.210> I<00:00:33.360> feel<00:00:33.660> like<00:00:33.690> it's

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
one it's too thin so I feel like it's

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.139 
one it's too thin so I feel like it's
going<00:00:34.140> to<00:00:34.200> break<00:00:34.350> like<00:00:34.800> my<00:00:34.950> ex500<00:00:35.460> did<00:00:35.969> or

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
going to break like my ex500 did or

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.440 
going to break like my ex500 did or
cabling<00:00:37.110> at<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.320> ax<00:00:37.559> seven<00:00:37.860> hundred<00:00:38.450> and

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
cabling at the ax seven hundred and

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.530

they're<00:00:39.870> worried<00:00:40.140> it's<00:00:40.530> just<00:00:40.829> so<00:00:41.190> long<00:00:41.670> I've

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
they're worried it's just so long I've

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.000 
they're worried it's just so long I've
actually<00:00:42.690> gone<00:00:43.050> on<00:00:43.200> ebay<00:00:43.530> and<00:00:43.800> I've<00:00:43.890> actually

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
actually gone on ebay and I've actually

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.130 
actually gone on ebay and I've actually
purchased<00:00:44.610> myself<00:00:44.969> an<00:00:45.090> extension<00:00:45.600> cable<00:00:45.960> you

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
purchased myself an extension cable you

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.639 
purchased myself an extension cable you
see<00:00:46.260> this<00:00:46.350> actual<00:00:46.710> cable<00:00:46.890> which<00:00:47.100> goes<00:00:47.280> there<00:00:47.520> I

00:00:48.639 --> 00:00:48.649 
see this actual cable which goes there I

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:50.779 
see this actual cable which goes there I
bought<00:00:49.649> myself<00:00:49.860> a<00:00:50.160> shorter<00:00:50.460> one<00:00:50.579> this<00:00:50.730> is

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
bought myself a shorter one this is

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.889 
bought myself a shorter one this is
about<00:00:51.149> it's<00:00:52.110> about<00:00:52.199> a<00:00:52.350> meter<00:00:53.570> run<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.719> meter

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
about it's about a meter run the meter

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.779 
about it's about a meter run the meter
or<00:00:55.199> no<00:00:55.410> point<00:00:55.710> eight<00:00:55.920> no<00:00:56.280> point<00:00:56.550> eight<00:00:56.640> I<00:00:56.760> think

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
or no point eight no point eight I think

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.610 
or no point eight no point eight I think
it<00:00:57.030> was<00:00:57.149> I<00:00:57.270> bought<00:00:57.660> one<00:00:57.809> for<00:00:57.960> nor<00:00:58.140> point<00:00:58.350> five

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
it was I bought one for nor point five

00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:59.930 
it was I bought one for nor point five
so<00:00:59.010> it<00:00:59.160> might<00:00:59.340> make<00:00:59.489> a<00:00:59.550> little<00:00:59.640> bit<00:00:59.910> of

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
so it might make a little bit of

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.450 
so it might make a little bit of
difference<00:01:00.059> this<00:01:00.870> is<00:01:01.109> just<00:01:01.590> two<00:01:01.829> shorts<00:01:02.309> like

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
difference this is just two shorts like

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.399 
difference this is just two shorts like
when<00:01:02.609> I've<00:01:02.699> have<00:01:02.850> it<00:01:02.969> in<00:01:03.030> my<00:01:03.120> pockets<00:01:03.570> like<00:01:03.840> it

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
when I've have it in my pockets like it

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.140 
when I've have it in my pockets like it
needs<00:01:04.650> just<00:01:04.710> an<00:01:04.949> extra<00:01:05.400> so<00:01:05.790> they<00:01:05.909> should<00:01:06.060> have

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
needs just an extra so they should have

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.490 
needs just an extra so they should have
just<00:01:06.240> made<00:01:06.390> a<00:01:06.420> little<00:01:06.630> bit<00:01:06.869> longer<00:01:07.260> it

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
just made a little bit longer it

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.380 
just made a little bit longer it

department<00:01:42.030> it's<00:01:42.509> exactly<00:01:43.200> or<00:01:43.439> identical<00:01:44.040> to

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
department it's exactly or identical to

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.330 
department it's exactly or identical to
the<00:01:44.340> 75<00:01:44.790> ones<00:01:45.170> the<00:01:46.170> highs<00:01:46.439> and<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:46.829> trebles

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
the 75 ones the highs and the trebles

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.929 
the 75 ones the highs and the trebles
are<00:01:48.240> much<00:01:48.600> more<00:01:48.840> apparent<00:01:49.380> and<00:01:49.590> thus<00:01:50.189> it<00:01:50.729> might

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
are much more apparent and thus it might

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.730 
are much more apparent and thus it might
be<00:01:51.060> a<00:01:51.090> little<00:01:51.240> bit<00:01:51.450> a<00:01:51.720> bright<00:01:52.079> saying<00:01:52.500> that

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
be a little bit a bright saying that

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.850 
be a little bit a bright saying that
over<00:01:53.579> time<00:01:53.790> with<00:01:54.030> burning<00:01:54.450> that<00:01:54.990> might<00:01:55.229> fade

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
over time with burning that might fade

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.289 
over time with burning that might fade
away<00:01:56.159> so<00:01:56.219> to<00:01:56.369> speak<00:01:56.640> especially<00:01:56.880> with<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:57.180> use

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
away so to speak especially with the use

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.690 
away so to speak especially with the use
of<00:01:57.329> the<00:01:57.509> calm<00:01:57.719> please<00:01:57.950> it<00:01:58.950> sort<00:01:59.189> of<00:01:59.219> reduces

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
of the calm please it sort of reduces

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.959 
of the calm please it sort of reduces
that<00:01:59.850> effect<00:02:00.180> so<00:02:00.869> that<00:02:01.049> might<00:02:01.229> get<00:02:01.409> better

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:01.969 
that effect so that might get better

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:06.499 
that effect so that might get better
we're<00:02:02.969> just<00:02:03.090> time<00:02:03.659> I<00:02:04.159> have<00:02:05.159> to<00:02:05.310> wait<00:02:05.460> wait<00:02:06.299> for

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
we're just time I have to wait wait for

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.839 
we're just time I have to wait wait for
a<00:02:06.540> while<00:02:06.689> and<00:02:06.930> burning<00:02:07.560> like<00:02:07.680> the<00:02:07.770> 751<00:02:08.220> so<00:02:08.580> good

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
a while and burning like the 751 so good

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.729 
a while and burning like the 751 so good
two<00:02:09.060> months<00:02:09.270> of<00:02:09.539> listening<00:02:09.899> off<00:02:10.050> and<00:02:10.259> on<00:02:10.349> until

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
two months of listening off and on until

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.430 
two months of listening off and on until
I<00:02:11.069> saw<00:02:11.400> heard<00:02:11.940> the<00:02:12.209> heist<00:02:12.480> come<00:02:12.870> through

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
I saw heard the heist come through

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.800 
I saw heard the heist come through
they<00:02:13.500> sound<00:02:13.710> really<00:02:13.770> muddy<00:02:14.250> at<00:02:14.430> first<00:02:14.810> gotta

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
they sound really muddy at first gotta

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.410 
they sound really muddy at first gotta
say<00:02:15.930> that<00:02:16.080> the<00:02:16.260> base<00:02:16.860> is<00:02:17.130> was<00:02:17.700> bloated<00:02:18.120> at

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
say that the base is was bloated at

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:19.880 
say that the base is was bloated at
first<00:02:18.660> when<00:02:18.840> I<00:02:18.870> first<00:02:19.110> got<00:02:19.320> them<00:02:19.470> at<00:02:19.560> the<00:02:19.680> box

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
first when I first got them at the box

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.920 
first when I first got them at the box
so<00:02:20.550> do<00:02:20.670> not<00:02:20.790> worry<00:02:21.000> about<00:02:21.060> that<00:02:21.240> if<00:02:21.420> you<00:02:21.630> do<00:02:21.750> get

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
so do not worry about that if you do get

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.860 
so do not worry about that if you do get
them<00:02:22.110> be<00:02:22.770> around<00:02:23.600> 90<00:02:24.600> 95<00:02:25.380> pounds<00:02:25.860> to<00:02:26.010> buy<00:02:26.160> them

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
them be around 90 95 pounds to buy them

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.360 
them be around 90 95 pounds to buy them
and<00:02:27.870> that's<00:02:28.050> about<00:02:28.170> it<00:02:28.320> the<00:02:28.650> case<00:02:28.920> that<00:02:28.980> comes

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
and that's about it the case that comes

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.960 
and that's about it the case that comes
with<00:02:29.580> it<00:02:29.610> it's<00:02:30.540> quite<00:02:30.810> handy<00:02:31.370> I'll<00:02:32.370> start

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
with it it's quite handy I'll start

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.120 
with it it's quite handy I'll start
using<00:02:33.180> it<00:02:33.360> soon<00:02:33.600> and<00:02:33.900> I<00:02:34.470> haven't<00:02:34.830> been<00:02:34.950> using

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
using it soon and I haven't been using

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.190 
using it soon and I haven't been using
case<00:02:35.430> as<00:02:35.610> much<00:02:35.790> because<00:02:36.750> I'm<00:02:36.900> not<00:02:36.990> going<00:02:37.140> to

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
case as much because I'm not going to

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.960 
case as much because I'm not going to
put<00:02:37.320> that<00:02:37.440> in<00:02:37.560> my<00:02:37.680> pockets<00:02:38.550> quite<00:02:38.730> chunky

poor cabling as i said sibilants now
sibilants<00:02:51.780> is<00:02:52.290> basically<00:02:52.770> when<00:02:52.950> you<00:02:53.040> can<00:02:53.160> hear

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
sibilants is basically when you can hear

sibilants is basically when you can hear
a<00:02:53.460> hiss<00:02:53.760> so<00:02:54.150> it<00:02:54.450> goes<00:02:54.690> Shh<00:02:55.640> literally<00:02:56.640> that

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
a hiss so it goes Shh literally that

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.390 
a hiss so it goes Shh literally that
it's<00:02:57.600> when<00:02:57.810> you<00:02:57.900> plug<00:02:58.080> it<00:02:58.230> through<00:02:58.500> for<00:02:59.250> you<00:02:59.310> on

i've<00:03:09.600> posted<00:03:10.050> another<00:03:10.410> video<00:03:10.950> about<00:03:10.980> that<00:03:12.740> you

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:13.740 
i've posted another video about that you

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:19.690 
i've posted another video about that you
can<00:03:13.860> get<00:03:14.040> a<00:03:14.070> resistor<00:03:14.730> adapter<00:03:15.440> 75<00:03:16.440> ohms<00:03:16.890> of

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:21.680 

Independence<00:03:20.700> which<00:03:20.880> basically<00:03:21.150> removes<00:03:21.570> the

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
Independence which basically removes the

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.750 
Independence which basically removes the
hiss<00:03:21.930> however<00:03:22.320> brings<00:03:22.590> down<00:03:22.800> the<00:03:22.860> volume<00:03:23.280> of

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760

hiss however brings down the volume of
the<00:03:24.030> total<00:03:24.989> volumes<00:03:25.350> or<00:03:25.560> so<00:03:25.890> to<00:03:25.950> speak<00:03:26.160> of<00:03:26.430> the

perfectly loud I have to play that
volume<00:03:34.560> 13<00:03:35.370> or<00:03:35.550> 14<00:03:36.050> with<00:03:37.050> this<00:03:37.290> on<00:03:37.500> to<00:03:38.330> have<00:03:39.330> the

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
volume 13 or 14 with this on to have the

volume 13 or 14 with this on to have the
same<00:03:39.690> volume<00:03:40.500> so<00:03:41.250> as<00:03:41.580> you<00:03:41.670> can<00:03:41.760> see<00:03:41.880> it<00:03:41.970> brings

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
same volume so as you can see it brings

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:44.120 
same volume so as you can see it brings
it<00:03:42.420> down<00:03:42.540> in<00:03:42.720> volume<00:03:43.050> so<00:03:43.200> that<00:03:43.260> thus<00:03:43.680> I've<00:03:43.980> been

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
make like a warmer sound and a base is

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.000 
make like a warmer sound and a base is
kind<00:04:06.209> of<00:04:06.300> brought<00:04:07.050> out<00:04:07.320> and<00:04:07.650> the<00:04:07.800> highs<00:04:07.980> and

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
kind of brought out and the highs and

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:12.080 
kind of brought out and the highs and
mids<00:04:08.610> to<00:04:08.880> tone<00:04:09.120> down<00:04:10.519> except<00:04:11.519> for<00:04:11.640> that<00:04:11.760> or

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
mids to tone down except for that or

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:14.600 
mids to tone down except for that or
apart<00:04:12.450> from<00:04:12.600> that<00:04:12.630> should<00:04:12.870> I<00:04:12.930> say<00:04:13.080> it<00:04:13.500> 175<00:04:14.190> ones

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:14.610 
apart from that should I say it 175 ones

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:17.240 
apart from that should I say it 175 ones
they're<00:04:15.150> just<00:04:15.480> so<00:04:16.350> much<00:04:16.530> better<00:04:16.830> just<00:04:17.040> because

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
they're just so much better just because

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.820 
they're just so much better just because

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:19.830 
of their on the highs and mids I just

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:22.099 
of their on the highs and mids I just
brought<00:04:20.070> out<00:04:20.340> so<00:04:20.669> much<00:04:20.820> more<00:04:21.060> something<00:04:21.840> that

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109 
brought out so much more something that
