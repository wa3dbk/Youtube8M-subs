00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
looked lackluster you know there was

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:42.120 
looked lackluster you know there was
never<00:02:40.960> a<00:02:41.140> period<00:02:41.530> in<00:02:41.620> the<00:02:41.710> game<00:02:41.890> where<00:02:42.100> I

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
never a period in the game where I

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:43.530 
never a period in the game where I
thought<00:02:42.460> you<00:02:42.550> know<00:02:42.670> we<00:02:42.970> are<00:02:43.090> the<00:02:43.300> better<00:02:43.450> team

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
thought you know we are the better team

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.510 
thought you know we are the better team
we<00:02:44.110> are<00:02:44.140> the<00:02:44.470> one<00:02:44.620> in<00:02:44.710> the<00:02:44.830> ascendancy<00:02:45.220> I

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520 
we are the one in the ascendancy I

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.730 
we are the one in the ascendancy I
always<00:02:46.210> thought<00:02:46.540> that<00:02:46.810> it's<00:02:47.110> all<00:02:47.320> just<00:02:47.620> add

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:47.740 
always thought that it's all just add

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:50.100 
always thought that it's all just add
that<00:02:47.890> little<00:02:48.070> bit<00:02:48.370> extra<00:02:48.400> and<00:02:48.910> that<00:02:49.600> once

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
that little bit extra and that once

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.320 
that little bit extra and that once
again<00:02:50.380> we<00:02:50.560> say<00:02:50.890> there's<00:02:51.070> quite<00:02:51.610> a<00:02:51.640> lot<00:02:51.850> this

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
again we say there's quite a lot this

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.960 
again we say there's quite a lot this
season<00:02:52.570> and<00:02:52.870> last<00:02:53.020> season<00:02:53.470> blues<00:02:54.070> take<00:02:54.340> a<00:02:54.370> few
