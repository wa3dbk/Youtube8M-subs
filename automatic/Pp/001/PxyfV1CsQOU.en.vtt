00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:10.200
 good people here who speaks is daniel 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:13.679
 I am here to show that time to 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:17.640
 You and we also questioned. 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:21.090
 about that situation but he would have 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.340
 what happened this month about 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:28.199
 those lines are not those points 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:31.619
 was found on the moon until it was mo 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.260
 controversy in those in social networks and in 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:37.140
 youtube 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:40.290
 then delivered up to science 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.390
 Let's sail on the moon but what I wanted 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:47.730
 to show you that there is more 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:53.660
 things but most are you will see 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.660
 well let's dictate those coordinates 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:41.930
 the example has a photo taken from 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:52.700
 low and high resolution shows a lot 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:55.220
 Franco tries to explain the failures of 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:58.180
 pixels 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.180
 I find it very unlikely 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:31.790
 now exists so what happens is that 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:52.820
 the human being he always think that the factor 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:56.110
 from life to earth you see where the 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:03:00.940
 life is able to adapt 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.940
 you can say that life is a thing 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:29.100
 at this level is much higher than that 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:33.840
 What else can be up to one year 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:38.780
 It is a natural thing to receive keeps the 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:41.280
 practically perfect symmetry risks 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:46.200
 reminds you a lot of those lines of 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:47.570
 born girls they showed some 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:53.940
 thing 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:55.100
 the actor calling himself someone legal to use 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:58.110
 Internet 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:04:03.930
 then you see the full moon 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:12.380
 information with this line drawing or 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:12.380
 be 35 of the natural world 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:21.419
 the starting salary is not an evil exists 

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:22.949
 much a proposal to incorporate and 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:25.710
 never the club can now say that this 

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:29.699
 it's difficult here 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:31.830
 another day there is much in common with 

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:36.509
 team block a college 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:38.990
 today they are very light as their daughter's target 

00:04:36.509 --> 00:04:38.990
 on the side 

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:50.650
 Do you see that one way? 

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:21.860
 they think they own the village but what 

00:05:14.129 --> 00:05:28.339
 It intrigues me is that even more to do with 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:28.339
 the hard way task 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:39.840
 be also 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:49.860
 what this naked girl 

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.860
 the cicv 

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:56.470
 but what is certain is that the law is 

00:05:53.410 --> 00:06:03.990
 hide my bag 

00:05:56.470 --> 00:06:03.990
 a lot of things away from our back knowing 

00:06:10.889 --> 00:06:32.639
 by majority and image is not me 

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:39.180
 stone
