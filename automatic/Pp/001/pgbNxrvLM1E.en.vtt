the<00:02:19.890> scientific<00:02:20.190> name<00:02:20.610> and<00:02:21.450> look<00:02:21.750> you<00:02:21.989> didn't

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
the scientific name and look you didn't

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.470 
the scientific name and look you didn't
stumble<00:02:22.500> one<00:02:22.890> no<00:02:23.160> and<00:02:23.549> I<00:02:23.700> remember<00:02:24.180> that<00:02:24.299> for
