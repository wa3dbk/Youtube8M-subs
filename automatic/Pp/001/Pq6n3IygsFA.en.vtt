00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
 palau have finished this rugby day with the 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.640
 last poster of the 16th day is 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.140
 clearly we were receiving the derby 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.360
 marcel michelin where we find fabien 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.340
 pelous and françois trillo clearly 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.599
 that they had the pressure after the 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.549
 French victory win 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.090
 enhanced mandatory to find the 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:20.130
 leader throne 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:22.350
 yes double press this evening isabelle 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.199
 for for clearly clearly who 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.699
 receives brive it's the enemy of the center 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.539
 this is the best enemy of Clermont 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.029
 for the derby 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:33.010
 and necessarily derby although there are 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.780
 the mood already has the emotion for me 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:38.109
 the victims and the tribute to the victims 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:40.719
 attacks in Paris but there are also 

00:00:38.109 --> 00:00:43.180
 a team of clearly finally pelous 

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:45.789
 kéké reworked that send the game from the 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.440
 start of the match mike tried tried to 

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:50.430
 look for intervals and who try 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:52.110
 of the alternation of the game and 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.720
 which offers in any case the first 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.580
 penalty that transforms a cable lopez 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.200
 yes and this team of Clermont who 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:00.630
 remains on a convincing victory to 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:03.390
 home against toulouse also benefits 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:06.120
 a fairly fast numerical superiority 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:09.930
 from the 20th minute the right pillar baills 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:12.720
 bribe is excluded a yellow card that 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:15.810
 will enjoy but just at the end of the period 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.970
 7 of 10 minutes at the end of life on this 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.380
 rush this difference of davies is going to be 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.350
 in front of davies and who does that do the 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:25.259
 difference and then the action follows 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:28.619
 the brivists are still recovering 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:31.200
 and it takes a camille lopez inspired this 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:34.350
 evening to come back to do a redoubled 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:38.100
 one jumped behind and then is that 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.720
 is that its partners can do 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.330
 continue the action we found after 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:45.640
 an ellipse ceja marcellin buttin that goes 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:48.920
 make unlock 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.810
 in the Brive goal that had resisted 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.090
 so far everything is gone from 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.549
 this counter attack that cross you between 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.200
 gilford and john allan davis who was in 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:59.420
 view tonight the Welsh Center 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.039
 and then this telescopic arm the 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.049
 spoils the future bordelais which allows 

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:05.509
 his team to lead 11 0 before this 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:06.979
 Germain penalty on the siren 11.3 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:09.679
 that's the score at halftime a match 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:11.810
 rather bridled a lot of garbage in this 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:14.450
 derby from the center of a little nervousness the 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.620
 short wind difficulties that are quickly 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.900
 overcome at the beginning of the second period 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.910
 42nd minute a long move it's 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.530
 they start right from the start and 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.670
 who's going to end up while 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.430
 power by the Clermont 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:27.709
 the breezes went to get the ball 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.660
 on that one-month-long blow in their goal 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:32.750
 since they do not have they have not seen the 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:35.000
 balloon has been for two minutes and that's 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:38.239
 it's never kaiser who will find the 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.739
 fault after the concession a break 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:41.900
 of a very long position the 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:43.459
 Clermont who can alternate again 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.549
 once their game but who this time 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:48.349
 we find the efficiency and the score and 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:50.690
 the match will change its physiognomy 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:52.459
 because it's going to get excited have had this 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.319
 second test clermontois kaiser 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:55.910
 and then there is the few replica 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:58.100
 minutes later of brive with 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.170
 especially you tara morrison who typed 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.959
 the coupe was countered a little game of 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:05.660
 pinball there with melehi for massive and 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:08.630
 you the brivist arrow who inscribes his 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:10.489
 7th and this superb essay brian test 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:12.560
 superb Brive essay to a dominance 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:14.630
 without sharing of Clermont but 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:18.049
 some flashes of the Brivists who 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:20.239
 gives this magnificent and its operations 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:22.130
 bonus for clearly with nalaga who one 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:23.660
 remembered had been whistled in the 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:26.150
 public three weeks ago against kas 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.980
 and who takes his team while 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.290
 power especially in thexe because 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:32.090
 that was one of the tactical keys to this 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:34.220
 second period and nalaga that concludes 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.840
 this movement is for 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:38.030
 his nose is what is the third 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.680
 synonymous for the moment not yet 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:42.320
 bonus since there are three tries to 1 I 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.210
 I'm racing 23 to 10 for for clearly 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:47.780
 but nalaga also answers fed there are three 

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:49.190
 weeks while beauty and then 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:52.970
 and then redoubled again between 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:55.490
 stanley and lopez the beautiful pass and 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:59.420
 long pass of lopez for the doubled of 

00:03:55.490 --> 00:04:00.710
 malaga 179th tests in top 14 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:02.480
 and above all it's on the test that he has 

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:04.010
 offered the bonus at that moment for his 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:06.020
 team the complicated period for them 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:07.760
 brivists that no longer existed is on the 

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:10.790
 land that was coming over to advance on 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:12.350
 the impacts nor on the conquest that was 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:14.720
 dominated a little bit in all the camps 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:16.340
 all sectors and the monferranais 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:19.100
 were ruthlessly scored three 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:19.459
 essays almost in quick succession 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.140
 tears 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:23.120
 in any case the fate of the match at that moment 

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:25.550
 there thirty seven to ten after this test of 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.260
 penalty following a balloon 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:29.330
 worn and then look at this penalty 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:31.220
 played quickly by arnaud mela le 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:33.800
 brian captain the coyah relay 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:37.160
 mambo them and then then that's the 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:39.290
 Georgian pillar at a physical seat he 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.840
 makes an incredible sprint for a pillar 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:43.070
 who resists fucking plating and that 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:45.970
 will end beautifully fabien 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:48.440
 yeah that ends on the is there after 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:48.830
 passes in contact with the passes at 

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.990
 chalk 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.840
 behind the defense and it is in contact 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:53.520
 finished 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.290
 times the couple who come to point in 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:58.630
 the fight for the finest attempts to 

00:04:55.290 --> 00:05:02.230
 the evening despite the 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:05.810
 thivel to the undivided dominance of 

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:07.430
 Clermont 37 to 15 5 tests to 2 the 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:09.980
 are still in the bonus 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:12.620
 but the clearly preferring to come 

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:15.590
 drive the nail with ludovic 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:17.270
 radosaljevic who made his entrance there 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:18.950
 is take this balloon a lodge 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:20.210
 he quickly replaced morgan parra 

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:22.370
 who was running tonight 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:24.620
 and then he enters this sixth try 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:28.430
 Clermont who allows the blaye asm 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:30.110
 44 to 15 to 13 minutes from the end of this 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:31.550
 match but the brivists and well not 

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:32.960
 do not leave the arms on the contrary 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:34.370
 is even the hand on the ball in this 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:35.570
 end of game fabien 3 the hand on the 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:37.130
 balloon they played a little bit with 

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:38.660
 the energy of despair and also 

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:40.190
 the intelligence that some of their 

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:41.660
 players but the acquired and that comes back 

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:44.270
 play on my telly back and oman 

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:45.140
 come to conclude what this overcrowding in 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:47.000
 end of line 

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:48.820
 and we feasted on this second half 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.920
 show time trials it was 

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:53.210
 a good match Uruguay six tries to 3 

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:54.920
 clearly to shake for his bonus 

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:56.870
 offensive but clermont remains leader 

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:57.890
 clearly already turned to cutting 

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:59.360
 of Europe you see it these are the 

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:01.340
 post-match pictures where aurélien 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:02.750
 blush that was replacing tonight at 

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:04.430
 well already thinking about his moving to 

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:06.410
 seilh receiving saracens and 

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:08.270
 then moving to la rochelle on 

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:10.070
 will listen precisely and well benjamin 

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:13.310
 kayzer one of the international author 

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:15.050
 of an essay tonight here at clermont 

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:16.730
 the overall benefit is far from 

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:17.810
 perfect but before the match we would have 

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:19.610
 signed right away for a win at 

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:20.960
 four points so get by with a 

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:23.360
 honestly honored victory that's 

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:25.580
 it's really perfect 

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:27.740
 after including a defensive performance 

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:28.819
 has not been quite awesome 

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:31.789
 I think we could have been a little 

00:06:28.819 --> 00:06:33.050
 beefier and a little more this performance 

00:06:31.789 --> 00:06:33.979
 of the party a little bit easier if 

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:36.340
 we had been more precise and more 

00:06:33.979 --> 00:06:36.340
 beefy in defense
