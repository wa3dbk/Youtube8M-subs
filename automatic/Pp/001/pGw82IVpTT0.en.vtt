industry<00:01:26.790> as<00:01:27.090> a<00:01:27.180> DCT<00:01:27.600> this<00:01:28.380> is<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:28.560> first<00:01:28.800> time

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
industry as a DCT this is the first time

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.770 
industry as a DCT this is the first time
this<00:01:29.550> type<00:01:29.729> of<00:01:29.759> transmission<00:01:30.270> has<00:01:30.479> ever<00:01:30.600> been

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
this type of transmission has ever been

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.870 
this type of transmission has ever been
used<00:01:30.960> in<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.200> side-by-side<00:01:31.740> industry<00:01:32.280> it's

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
used in the side-by-side industry it's

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.510 
used in the side-by-side industry it's
an<00:01:33.030> all<00:01:33.240> gear<00:01:33.540> transmission<00:01:34.259> it<00:01:34.590> has<00:01:34.979> no<00:01:35.220> belt

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
an all gear transmission it has no belt

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.359 
an all gear transmission it has no belt
so<00:01:36.300> it<00:01:36.330> has<00:01:36.750> a<00:01:36.780> very<00:01:37.140> direct<00:01:37.380> connected<00:01:38.130> feel

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
so it has a very direct connected feel

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.670 
so it has a very direct connected feel
and<00:01:38.700> a<00:01:39.270> very<00:01:39.509> efficient<00:01:39.990> transfer<00:01:40.320> of<00:01:40.440> power

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
and a very efficient transfer of power

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.430 
and a very efficient transfer of power
to<00:01:40.800> the<00:01:40.979> ground<00:01:41.190> this<00:01:42.030> vehicle<00:01:42.539> actually<00:01:42.720> uses

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:43.440 
to the ground this vehicle actually uses

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.710 
to the ground this vehicle actually uses
your<00:01:43.619> throttle<00:01:44.039> input<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:44.789> engine<00:01:45.149> rpm<00:01:45.600> the

your throttle input the engine rpm the

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.410 
your throttle input the engine rpm the
vehicle<00:01:46.140> speed<00:01:46.470> what<00:01:47.100> that<00:01:47.310> does<00:01:47.610> is<00:01:47.910> it

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
vehicle speed what that does is it

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.240 
vehicle speed what that does is it
allows<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:48.930> engine<00:01:49.050> to<00:01:49.350> interpret<00:01:50.100> how

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
allows the engine to interpret how

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.249 
allows the engine to interpret how
you're<00:01:50.430> driving<00:01:50.880> so<00:01:51.479> when<00:01:51.600> you're<00:01:51.720> driving<00:01:51.960> in

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
you're driving so when you're driving in

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.040 
you're driving so when you're driving in
a<00:01:52.350> relaxed<00:01:53.070> non<00:01:53.550> aggressive<00:01:53.940> way<00:01:54.270> it<00:01:54.810> up

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:55.050 
a relaxed non aggressive way it up

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.070 
a relaxed non aggressive way it up
shifts<00:01:55.410> early<00:01:55.740> and<00:01:56.429> down<00:01:56.729> shifts<00:01:57.090> later<00:01:57.300> when

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.080 
shifts early and down shifts later when

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.010 
shifts early and down shifts later when
you<00:01:58.259> start<00:01:58.619> giving<00:01:58.770> an<00:01:59.009> aggressive<00:01:59.460> inputs

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
you start giving an aggressive inputs

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.740 
you start giving an aggressive inputs
it<00:02:00.409> holds<00:02:00.649> the<00:02:00.920> gears<00:02:01.219> goes<00:02:02.119> up<00:02:02.329> to<00:02:02.450> a<00:02:02.479> very

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
the driver we have a sport mode and what

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:10.420 
the driver we have a sport mode and what
sport<00:03:09.350> mode<00:03:09.470> does<00:03:09.680> is<00:03:09.709> it<00:03:09.980> changes<00:03:10.190> the

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
sport mode does is it changes the

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:12.879 
sport mode does is it changes the
transmission<00:03:11.150> shift<00:03:11.389> points<00:03:11.480> the<00:03:12.290> vehicle<00:03:12.709> up

also<00:03:16.700> at<00:03:16.819> a<00:03:16.850> higher<00:03:17.060> rpm<00:03:17.660> so<00:03:18.200> it<00:03:18.350> really<00:03:18.709> keeps

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:18.889 
also at a higher rpm so it really keeps

00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:21.009 
also at a higher rpm so it really keeps
