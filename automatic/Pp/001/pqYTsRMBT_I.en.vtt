00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
add a scratch effect or this is the

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:10.650 
add a scratch effect or this is the
quickest<00:02:09.940> way<00:02:10.060> to<00:02:10.090> do<00:02:10.300> it

quickest way to do it

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.790 
quickest way to do it
so<00:02:11.110> to<00:02:11.230> plug-in<00:02:11.709> by<00:02:12.840> sugar<00:02:13.840> bytes<00:02:14.140> I<00:02:14.530> believe

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
so to plug-in by sugar bytes I believe

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:15.900 
so to plug-in by sugar bytes I believe
yeah<00:02:15.130> sugar<00:02:15.340> bytes

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
yeah sugar bytes

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:23.430 
yeah sugar bytes
it's<00:02:16.239> called<00:02:16.450> you<00:02:16.510> fake<00:02:16.750> tricks<00:02:17.610> and<00:02:22.440> it's

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
it's called you fake tricks and it's

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:29.910 
it's called you fake tricks and it's
quite<00:02:23.890> interesting<00:02:25.620> and<00:02:27.660> once<00:02:28.660> you<00:02:28.840> get<00:02:29.739> it

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
quite interesting and once you get it

00:02:29.920 --> 00:04:06.440 
quite interesting and once you get it
set<00:02:30.100> up

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.500 

so<00:04:07.450> you<00:04:07.510> kind<00:04:07.780> of<00:04:07.840> get<00:04:07.989> the<00:04:08.340> gist<00:04:09.340> of<00:04:09.579> that<00:04:09.760> and

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 
so you kind of get the gist of that and

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:12.420 
so you kind of get the gist of that and
say<00:04:10.720> yeah<00:04:10.900> I<00:04:11.109> have<00:04:11.230> another<00:04:11.500> plug-in<00:04:12.130> that

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430 
say yeah I have another plug-in that

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.800 
say yeah I have another plug-in that
does<00:04:12.700> some<00:04:12.910> crazy<00:04:13.150> stuff<00:04:13.450> too<00:04:13.630> now<00:04:13.870> tornado

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
does some crazy stuff too now tornado

00:04:15.810 --> 00:06:39.580 
does some crazy stuff too now tornado
I'm<00:04:16.810> gonna<00:04:16.959> bypass<00:04:17.229> you<00:04:18.810> okay<00:04:19.810> I<00:04:21.900> pass<00:04:22.900> you

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:39.590 

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:43.070 

so<00:06:40.590> you<00:06:40.650> gotta<00:06:41.100> give<00:06:41.340> that<00:06:41.570> can<00:06:42.570> I<00:06:42.600> trust<00:06:42.930> this

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:43.080 
so you gotta give that can I trust this

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:46.880 
so you gotta give that can I trust this
a<00:06:43.140> couple<00:06:43.560> simple<00:06:44.390> now<00:06:45.410> actually<00:06:46.410> you<00:06:46.680> have<00:06:46.800> to

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:46.890 
a couple simple now actually you have to

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:48.860 
a couple simple now actually you have to
get<00:06:47.040> into<00:06:47.220> the<00:06:47.310> plugins<00:06:47.790> and<00:06:48.000> tweak<00:06:48.300> them<00:06:48.510> if

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:48.870 
get into the plugins and tweak them if

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:50.510 
get into the plugins and tweak them if
you<00:06:49.020> want<00:06:49.200> to<00:06:49.230> get<00:06:49.380> the<00:06:49.470> exact<00:06:49.800> scratch<00:06:50.160> and

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:50.520 
you want to get the exact scratch and

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:52.280 
you want to get the exact scratch and
all<00:06:50.610> that<00:06:50.790> sort<00:06:50.970> of<00:06:51.000> thing<00:06:51.210> but<00:06:51.390> that's<00:06:51.540> I<00:06:51.780> do<00:06:51.840> a

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:52.290 
all that sort of thing but that's I do a

00:06:52.290 --> 00:06:55.220 
all that sort of thing but that's I do a
lot<00:06:52.590> of<00:06:52.620> my<00:06:52.800> scratch<00:06:53.100> effects<00:06:53.750> and<00:06:54.750> I<00:06:55.020> just

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:55.230 
lot of my scratch effects and I just

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:57.860 
lot of my scratch effects and I just
thought<00:06:55.380> I'd<00:06:55.560> make<00:06:55.770> it<00:06:56.420> simple<00:06:57.420> for<00:06:57.450> you<00:06:57.630> to

00:06:57.860 --> 00:06:57.870 
thought I'd make it simple for you to

00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:01.160 
thought I'd make it simple for you to
kind<00:06:58.410> of<00:06:58.620> see<00:06:58.830> what<00:06:58.950> I<00:06:59.040> do<00:06:59.100> so<00:06:59.700> that's<00:07:00.240> it<00:07:00.510> hope

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:01.170 
kind of see what I do so that's it hope

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:05.180 
kind of see what I do so that's it hope
you<00:07:01.320> enjoyed<00:07:01.560> that<00:07:01.590> quick<00:07:02.180> dip
