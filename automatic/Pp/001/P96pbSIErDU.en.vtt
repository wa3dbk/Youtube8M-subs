map in the store and it appears from

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:35.260 
map in the store and it appears from
rebirth<00:00:32.029> 10<00:00:32.509> onwards<00:00:33.170> it's<00:00:33.950> the<00:00:34.220> last<00:00:34.460> map<00:00:34.940> and

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:35.270 
rebirth 10 onwards it's the last map and

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.590 
rebirth 10 onwards it's the last map and
the<00:00:35.390> most<00:00:35.570> expensive<00:00:36.310> but<00:00:37.310> one<00:00:37.910> large<00:00:38.180> key

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:38.600 
the most expensive but one large key

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:41.960 
will cover that cost so then we had to

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.500 
will cover that cost so then we had to
look<00:00:41.989> at<00:00:42.290> the<00:00:42.470> map<00:00:42.680> and<00:00:42.980> it<00:00:43.609> shows<00:00:43.969> you<00:00:44.149> that

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:44.510 
look at the map and it shows you that

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.979 
look at the map and it shows you that
