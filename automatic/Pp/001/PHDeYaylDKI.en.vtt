and remembered a moment when I was about
his<00:01:51.260> age<00:01:51.310> the<00:01:52.310> meaning<00:01:52.790> of<00:01:52.910> which<00:01:53.180> was

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.870 
watching the festival but I will see
something<00:02:07.820> different<00:02:09.040> between<00:02:10.040> men<00:02:10.580> and

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:10.880
