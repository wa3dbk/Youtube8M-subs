00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 hello girls in today's video to teach 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.960
 to make two accessories for the hair and 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.940
 these accessories to be seen very much 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.440
 lately not so much in stores 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.840
 although one of them I have seen more 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.639
 stores but on the internet the pinches in 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.220
 a lot of videos in a lot of 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.170
 different sites on how it exists 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.330
 interviews 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.510
 Fashion blogs on a lot of sites and 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.580
 are the wreaths and also a 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.800
 sort of chains or necklaces for the 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.110
 hair I do not know how they are called in Spanish and 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.910
 the nest that we can also 

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:35.100
 do at home because it's very easy to 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.350
 do and is to teach exactly how 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.930
 I have made my own wreath of flowers and 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.190
 my own and about for the hair I have a 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.230
 hair chain and I have been left 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.300
 super nice and I promise you that I have not 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.640
 tried more than 5 minutes to do each 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:51.470
 one so it's extremely easy to 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.470
 do and stay to see how the eyes 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.320
 or not 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:23.580
 what we are going to need is a chain 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.410
 pliers a piece of decoration and 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.360
 rings and everything you can find in 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:30.670
 your nearest bazaar 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.530
 we take the chain and we are going to measure it 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.360
 around our head to be able to 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.250
 cut it and then we will take another 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:39.160
 time the chain and measure from the front 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:42.360
 to the back of the head and 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:44.640
 let's cut two pieces of string 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.470
 once we have the chains cut 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.120
 we are going to use the little ring and 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.120
 let's connect the three chains 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.869
 once the three chains are 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.850
 together in the ring we are going to close it very 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.859
 well so they do not know we're going to put 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.259
 the chain on the ground I'm going to stretch it and 

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:06.450
 where the center strip coincides with the 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.039
 another side the other side of the chain there 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.470
 is where are we going to put the next 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:12.180
 ring and we will also add the piece 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.980
 of decoration and then we're going to 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.750
 close very well so that nothing separates 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.459
 and we're done with the chain that 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.480
 you have seen is super easy to do and 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:20.480
 this is the final result 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.890
 and now let's start with the next 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:32.500
 part of the video that is the crown of 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.670
 flowers and this crown is very easy to 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.950
 do and it was so easy that I decided 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.810
 make one for my baby and he has left 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.799
 precious also does not even realize 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:40.799
 who has it on 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:55.790
 what we are going to need are different 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.220
 flowers of different colors and these are 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:00.320
 I found in a fabric store and 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.870
 we are also going to need a cable 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:04.370
 metallic coated green plastic and 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.470
 this found in the part of 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.450
 florist let's measure our heads 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.620
 with the cable and we are going to cut the double 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.360
 of that measure 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:14.860
 now we are going to wind a cable with the 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.860
 another so that they remain subject 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:18.260
 and now comes the best part that is 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:20.510
 start putting the flowers 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:24.830
 and what I did was take a sequence 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:26.690
 which is pink and beige green one behind 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:28.430
 another and so keep putting the flowers 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.320
 until the crown was completely 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:32.450
 done and this is the final result as 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:33.800
 you can see is super super pretty and 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:36.260
 I'm sure in other colors 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:38.270
 it also looks great and as we have seen 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.740
 the accessories are super easy to 

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:41.660
 to do is taking more time buying 

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:44.150
 all the things that I'm really sitting on 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:46.010
 to do it and if by chance you have 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.570
 been looking for a wreath of flowers or 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.670
 something like that to put in your hair and not 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:51.320
 you find anywhere to try 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:53.150
 do that because you have a necklace that 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:55.160
 which many do not use you can 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:57.260
 break it and make your own piece 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:59.450
 accessory for the hair and grotesque that 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.580
 you have not taken anything in doing it and not 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:02.870
 you are going to regret it because for me 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:05.090
 at least it seems to me that it is very 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:06.830
 very nice and I await your accounts if 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.300
 some of these recreates jce and sessa 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:10.040
