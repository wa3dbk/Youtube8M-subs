00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:09.929
 op personal training direct all right 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:13.440
 let's stop the letter v letter v 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:15.000
 so space checking is because 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.400
 check me out in the middle of 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.529
 application response is simple because 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.500
 this application of verification of 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:25.410
 space it is from the beta labs of nokia and 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.210
 This is serious or give a touch that you 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.260
 They will see that it not only makes check 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.849
 of space 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.070
 this function here you find in the 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.899
 configuration of the device but 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.790
 my surprise and perhaps to the surprise of 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.660
 Many that's why I brought it to you. 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.700
 here on the channel 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.340
 this application does more than 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:44.100
 serious space verification is a 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.719
 beta of nokia maps that is available 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.600
 for everyone in the store the link is on 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.700
 description of the video for you to make the 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.860
 download certain set going to see only one 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.879
 of the fire is not to let it end 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:59.129
 to analyze and then an issue I do not know 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.770
 the device already has at least this 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:05.189
 fire 120 in version although not 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:08.159
 option to move the maps and that the maps 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.600
 the river maps and the river drive is pro yours 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.460
 memory card 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.580
 but you see it up here in 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:17.580
 details we go here in maps are seeing 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:23.220
 maps I go to near here maps 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:25.140
 occupying 240 lie occupying 20 4 megs 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.250
 anyway it's more than that but anyway let's go 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:32.040
 give a change here and here comes the question 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:34.710
 store maps on the SD card or the 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.049
 phone this option is not available 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.729
 on this unit in the 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.470
 it is only available through this 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:44.820
 application that is called 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.899
 space on the fire then sd card and ready 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.509
 and maps 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:52.350
 You will see that I have installed 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:53.790
 nothing 400 megs of map nunes device is 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.399
 one passed from Brazil 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.829
 imagine you traveling the world you who 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:01.680
 She likes to have maps. 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:04.469
 You who like many maps every map 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.299
 it sucks so freaking so you just got it 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.799
 a map of the region because the entire map 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.460
 of Brazil was much to their 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.890
 memory 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:13.920
 can see that the app actually 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:17.340
 has a good behind unfortunately it goes 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.950
 read all your storage if you have 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:23.790
 a lot that will not even be long 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:25.740
 There you have it, 460 mega bytes. 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.600
 the option to store maps on the sd card 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.670
 and to prove that I'm not crazy 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.500
 lumiar palace check is a 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.920
 application just like I said here 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.550
 let's then in settings there in the letter 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.260
 W 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:41.520
 The girl does not know that I'm not cheating. 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:44.820
 in settings we go down here in 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:46.830
 check space in a 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.970
 Storage Telephone Tea Storage 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.940
 phone 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.620
 there it will do exactly the same 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.840
 thing we just saw what we 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:59.040
 will generate that graphic for us 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:01.110
 to store new musicians 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:04.410
 videos on SD cards at points where the 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:07.320
 crowd has nothing serious about maps 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:09.090
 neither side understood if I'm not mistaken 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.530
 Space check was on 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.330
 space verification 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:16.320
 let's look let us 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:18.720
 load that it will read again all 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:21.990
 the data of our card but the tip well 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:24.870
 cool for you and you can move the 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:27.180
 maps of you officially without 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.400
 hacks on nothing your memory card 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.050
 has not yet discovered a legal way to 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.740
 move applications to card 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:33.930
 memory 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:36.030
 As soon as you find out, you have direct q 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.630
 brings you because we also hope 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.520
 for that day 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:40.800
 we go there you're watching we have 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:42.780
 nothing be eight used twins 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.520
 we are here for one side let's go 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.100
 here then for maps 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:48.090
 you have seen that you have no option to move 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.580
 the maps 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:52.550
 this is the system version if it was too 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:54.480
 Quick you're in configurations. 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:57.870
 space check here 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:00.450
 Brazil when 60 mega only it does not give 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:03.210
 option to move the maps to the sd card 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:04.680
 same as the other app worked fine 

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:06.960
 You are seeing details here and everything. 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.860
 plus there is no sd card option for 

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:09.990
 maps 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:12.840
 This is it, everybody is getting out of today's tip. 

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:15.570
 a beta application that is available 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.139
 in the store that is the space verification of 

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:18.090
 fire 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:19.829
 I'll leave the link for you attention. 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:22.469
 in the video like I told you 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:25.229
 and that's it, the staff until the next 

00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:27.060
 video and test and there is a space 

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:30.569
 the fire is official 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:33.180
 it's beta it's from nokia beta to light 

00:04:30.569 --> 00:04:35.849
 nokia is so aquino side you're going to have

00:04:35.849 --> 00:04:39.060
 sd 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:42.120
 if you have an SD card it is clear that 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:44.490
 is not the case of the 920 is this personal here 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:46.110

 Guys, I hope you enjoyed it. 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:57.569
 have been repetitive but that is 

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:59.819
 important for many people then download 

00:04:57.569 --> 00:05:01.949
 the application will map settings 

00:04:59.819 --> 00:05:04.110
 space verification is not in the 

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:06.389
 and you're ready to move 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:09.000

 additional favorites 

00:05:12.719 --> 00:05:17.009
 It was so exciting that the setting up 

00:05:14.249 --> 00:05:20.990
 fell before the staff went to the next 

00:05:17.009 --> 00:05:20.990
 video than direct and bye
