hey guys it's merlini i'm going to

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:04.910 
hey guys it's merlini i'm going to
enlighten<00:00:03.210> you<00:00:03.419> on<00:00:03.449> armor<00:00:04.200> and<00:00:04.380> try<00:00:04.680> and<00:00:04.740> help

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:04.920 
enlighten you on armor and try and help

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.590 
enlighten you on armor and try and help
you<00:00:05.069> understand<00:00:05.549> it<00:00:05.700> just<00:00:05.940> a<00:00:06.150> little<00:00:06.180> bit

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
you understand it just a little bit

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.980 
you understand it just a little bit
better<00:00:07.140> so<00:00:07.890> first<00:00:08.580> i'm<00:00:08.820> going<00:00:09.059> to<00:00:09.360> simplify<00:00:09.780> it

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
better so first i'm going to simplify it

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.009 
better so first i'm going to simplify it
down<00:00:10.349> with<00:00:10.740> a<00:00:10.980> few<00:00:11.340> assumptions<00:00:11.840> firstly<00:00:12.840> all

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
down with a few assumptions firstly all

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.020 
down with a few assumptions firstly all
damage<00:00:13.620> will<00:00:13.740> be<00:00:13.769> treated<00:00:14.190> as<00:00:14.370> physical

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
damage will be treated as physical

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.170 
damage will be treated as physical
damage<00:00:16.100> for<00:00:17.100> the<00:00:17.160> purposes<00:00:17.580> of<00:00:17.640> this

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
damage for the purposes of this

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.779 
damage for the purposes of this
presentation<00:00:18.619> because<00:00:19.619> armor<00:00:20.400> doesn't<00:00:20.490> do

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
presentation because armor doesn't do

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.759 
presentation because armor doesn't do
anything<00:00:21.119> vs<00:00:21.539> magic<00:00:21.750> nor<00:00:22.380> does<00:00:22.529> it<00:00:22.590> do

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
anything vs magic nor does it do

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.849 
anything vs magic nor does it do
anything<00:00:22.850> vs.<00:00:23.850> pure<00:00:24.119> damage<00:00:24.390> next<00:00:25.199> all<00:00:25.350> armor

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
anything vs. pure damage next all armor

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.830 
anything vs. pure damage next all armor
values<00:00:26.189> are<00:00:26.400> going<00:00:26.699> to<00:00:26.849> be<00:00:27.000> greater<00:00:27.480> than<00:00:27.779> or

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
values are going to be greater than or

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.830 
values are going to be greater than or
equal<00:00:28.289> to<00:00:28.529> 0<00:00:29.039> this<00:00:29.609> is<00:00:29.789> because<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.330> formula

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
equal to 0 this is because the formula

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.350 
equal to 0 this is because the formula
for<00:00:30.869> calculating<00:00:31.610> armor<00:00:32.610> and<00:00:32.759> damage<00:00:33.180> is

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
for calculating armor and damage is

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.270 
for calculating armor and damage is
going<00:00:33.600> to<00:00:33.660> be<00:00:33.719> different<00:00:33.989> at<00:00:34.440> positive<00:00:34.800> armor

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
going to be different at positive armor

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.400 
going to be different at positive armor
values<00:00:35.579> and<00:00:35.730> negative<00:00:36.420> armor<00:00:36.960> values<00:00:37.260> and

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
values and negative armor values and

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:38.810 
values and negative armor values and
since<00:00:37.620> you'll<00:00:37.829> mostly<00:00:38.190> be<00:00:38.280> dealing<00:00:38.790> with

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
since you'll mostly be dealing with

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.869 
since you'll mostly be dealing with
positive<00:00:39.510> armor<00:00:39.870> I'm<00:00:40.860> going<00:00:41.190> to<00:00:41.340> simplify<00:00:41.730> and

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
positive armor I'm going to simplify and

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.779 
positive armor I'm going to simplify and
make<00:00:42.000> it<00:00:42.149> non<00:00:42.360> negative<00:00:42.840> so<00:00:43.739> all<00:00:44.070> armor<00:00:44.489> values

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
make it non negative so all armor values

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.940 
make it non negative so all armor values
are<00:00:44.910> all<00:00:45.180> going<00:00:45.600> to<00:00:45.660> be<00:00:45.809> integers<00:00:46.289> just<00:00:46.770> so<00:00:46.860> we

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
are all going to be integers just so we

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.889 
are all going to be integers just so we
don't<00:00:46.980> have<00:00:47.160> to<00:00:47.250> deal<00:00:47.399> with<00:00:47.520> any<00:00:47.899> nasty

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
don't have to deal with any nasty

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.630 
don't have to deal with any nasty
decimals<00:00:49.680> god<00:00:50.039> forbid<00:00:51.350> so<00:00:52.350> we<00:00:52.710> have<00:00:52.949> effective

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
your HP now your eh p is going to go up

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.840 
your HP now your eh p is going to go up
and<00:01:57.299> this<00:01:57.840> is<00:01:58.049> a<00:01:58.079> linear<00:01:58.710> relationship<00:01:58.950> so

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
and this is a linear relationship so

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.999 
and this is a linear relationship so
each<00:02:00.119> point<00:02:00.450> of<00:02:00.600> armor<00:02:00.990> is<00:02:01.140> going<00:02:01.619> to<00:02:01.680> give<00:02:01.799> you

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
each point of armor is going to give you

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.510 
each point of armor is going to give you
the<00:02:02.040> same<00:02:02.490> amount<00:02:02.640> of<00:02:03.060> vhp<00:02:03.570> so<00:02:04.380> slope<00:02:05.070> like

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
the same amount of vhp so slope like

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.809 
the same amount of vhp so slope like
this<00:02:05.549> if<00:02:06.299> you<00:02:06.329> graph<00:02:06.899> HP<00:02:07.560> versus<00:02:08.009> armor

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
this if you graph HP versus armor

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.830 
this if you graph HP versus armor
and<00:02:09.769> now<00:02:10.769> that<00:02:11.009> we<00:02:11.099> have<00:02:11.129> that<00:02:11.249> formula<00:02:11.849> 40<00:02:12.359> HP

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
and now that we have that formula 40 HP

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.319 
and now that we have that formula 40 HP
again<00:02:13.469> listen<00:02:13.980> right<00:02:14.129> here<00:02:14.489> we're<00:02:15.150> going<00:02:15.269> to

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:15.329 
again listen right here we're going to

00:02:15.329 --> 00:02:18.640 
again listen right here we're going to
calculate<00:02:15.629> the<00:02:15.840> HP<00:02:16.590> with<00:02:16.920> some<00:02:17.280> basic<00:02:17.909> values

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
calculate the HP with some basic values

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.009 
calculate the HP with some basic values
1,000<00:02:19.650> HP<00:02:19.829> with<00:02:20.069> 0<00:02:20.340> armour<00:02:20.579> than<00:02:21.120> for<00:02:21.510> armor

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:22.019 
1,000 HP with 0 armour than for armor

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:25.009 
1,000 HP with 0 armour than for armor
and<00:02:22.230> then<00:02:22.560> 17<00:02:23.370> armor<00:02:23.819> and<00:02:24.030> I'll<00:02:24.599> make<00:02:24.749> more

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:25.019 
and then 17 armor and I'll make more

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:26.929 
and then 17 armor and I'll make more
sense<00:02:25.230> why<00:02:25.500> I<00:02:25.530> chose<00:02:25.859> these<00:02:26.129> specific<00:02:26.639> values

00:02:26.929 --> 00:02:26.939 
sense why I chose these specific values

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:31.339 
sense why I chose these specific values
later<00:02:27.709> so<00:02:28.709> using<00:02:29.430> the<00:02:29.519> formula<00:02:30.000> with<00:02:30.840> zero

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:31.349 
later so using the formula with zero

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:35.780 
later so using the formula with zero
armory<00:02:31.739> of<00:02:31.859> thousand<00:02:32.430> ehp<00:02:33.290> with<00:02:34.290> for<00:02:34.739> armor<00:02:35.159> it

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
armory of thousand ehp with for armor it

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.059 
armory of thousand ehp with for armor it
becomes<00:02:36.150> zero<00:02:36.719> point<00:02:36.930> zero<00:02:36.959> six<00:02:37.349> times<00:02:37.709> 4

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
becomes zero point zero six times 4

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:41.360 
becomes zero point zero six times 4
which<00:02:38.099> is<00:02:38.519> 0.24<00:02:39.359> add<00:02:40.349> 1<00:02:40.769> multiplied<00:02:41.219> by<00:02:41.340> a

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
which is 0.24 add 1 multiplied by a

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:46.789 
which is 0.24 add 1 multiplied by a
thousand<00:02:41.879> twelve<00:02:42.239> 40<00:02:42.689> HP<00:02:43.230> and<00:02:44.719> with<00:02:45.719> 17<00:02:46.049> armor

thousand twelve 40 HP and with 17 armor

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:53.470 
thousand twelve 40 HP and with 17 armor
this<00:02:47.189> term<00:02:47.400> becomes<00:02:47.639> 1.02<00:02:48.329> for<00:02:49.400> 2020<00:02:50.400> eh<00:02:51.030> p<00:02:52.159> but

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
this term becomes 1.02 for 2020 eh p but

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.149 
this term becomes 1.02 for 2020 eh p but
now<00:02:54.480> that<00:02:54.659> we<00:02:54.750> have<00:02:54.780> all<00:02:54.930> the<00:02:55.049> CHP<00:02:55.500> mumbo<00:02:55.769> jumbo

00:02:56.149 --> 00:02:56.159 
now that we have all the CHP mumbo jumbo

00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:57.679 
now that we have all the CHP mumbo jumbo
we<00:02:56.489> actually<00:02:56.849> want<00:02:57.000> to<00:02:57.030> see<00:02:57.150> how<00:02:57.239> much<00:02:57.389> damage

00:02:57.679 --> 00:02:57.689 
we actually want to see how much damage

00:02:57.689 --> 00:03:01.250 
we actually want to see how much damage
is<00:02:58.099> mitigated<00:02:59.099> or<00:02:59.480> it's<00:03:00.480> just<00:03:00.840> a<00:03:00.900> fancy<00:03:01.109> term

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
is mitigated or it's just a fancy term

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.220 
is mitigated or it's just a fancy term
for<00:03:01.409> reduction<00:03:02.370> damage<00:03:02.730> reduction<00:03:02.969> so<00:03:03.659> the

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
for reduction damage reduction so the

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.119 
for reduction damage reduction so the
same<00:03:04.409> values<00:03:04.859> as<00:03:05.040> before<00:03:05.370> 0<00:03:05.669> for<00:03:06.030> 17<00:03:06.510> armor

00:03:07.119 --> 00:03:07.129 
same values as before 0 for 17 armor

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:10.909 
same values as before 0 for 17 armor
1012<00:03:08.129> 40<00:03:08.489> 20<00:03:09.000> 20<00:03:09.299> hp<00:03:09.930> Helmer<00:03:10.439> damage<00:03:10.709> are<00:03:10.799> you

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:10.919 
1012 40 20 20 hp Helmer damage are you

00:03:10.919 --> 00:03:16.009 
1012 40 20 20 hp Helmer damage are you
actually<00:03:11.069> mitigating<00:03:12.290> so<00:03:13.729> you're<00:03:14.729> with<00:03:15.389> 12<00:03:15.750> 40

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
actually mitigating so you're with 12 40

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:20.449 
actually mitigating so you're with 12 40
HP<00:03:16.500> versus<00:03:16.949> 1000hp<00:03:17.790> you're<00:03:18.150> not<00:03:18.629> taking<00:03:19.459> 240

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
HP versus 1000hp you're not taking 240

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:22.159 
HP versus 1000hp you're not taking 240
of<00:03:20.549> the<00:03:20.639> damage<00:03:21.000> that's<00:03:21.359> how<00:03:21.509> much<00:03:21.689> damage<00:03:21.900> is

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:22.169 
of the damage that's how much damage is

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:27.319 
of the damage that's how much damage is
reduced<00:03:22.379> so<00:03:23.180> 240<00:03:24.180> /<00:03:24.479> 12<00:03:25.290> 40<00:03:25.680> HP<00:03:26.370> it's<00:03:26.909> around

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:27.329 
reduced so 240 / 12 40 HP it's around

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:31.580 
reduced so 240 / 12 40 HP it's around
twenty<00:03:28.199> percent<00:03:28.790> reduction<00:03:29.790> and<00:03:30.439> how<00:03:31.439> much

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
twenty percent reduction and how much

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.479 
twenty percent reduction and how much
damage<00:03:31.799> there<00:03:32.069> taking<00:03:32.400> and<00:03:34.040> that's<00:03:35.040> with<00:03:35.220> for

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:35.489 
damage there taking and that's with for

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:38.210 
damage there taking and that's with for
armor<00:03:35.879> and<00:03:36.060> there<00:03:36.389> was<00:03:36.509> 17<00:03:36.989> armor<00:03:37.379> you<00:03:37.769> have<00:03:37.859> 20

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
armor and there was 17 armor you have 20

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.140 
armor and there was 17 armor you have 20
20<00:03:38.459> hp<00:03:38.970> you're<00:03:39.269> blocking<00:03:39.629> or<00:03:40.220> reducing<00:03:41.220> 1020

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
20 hp you're blocking or reducing 1020

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.509 
20 hp you're blocking or reducing 1020
of<00:03:42.329> the<00:03:42.840> 20<00:03:43.199> 20<00:03:43.500> damage<00:03:43.680> that<00:03:43.919> is<00:03:44.069> coming<00:03:44.370> in

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
of the 20 20 damage that is coming in

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:48.259 
of the 20 20 damage that is coming in
and<00:03:44.729> that's<00:03:45.180> roughly<00:03:45.720> half<00:03:46.109> of<00:03:46.400> the<00:03:47.400> physical

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:48.269 
and that's roughly half of the physical

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:49.699 
and that's roughly half of the physical
damage<00:03:48.599> that's<00:03:48.810> being<00:03:48.930> reduced<00:03:49.229> which<00:03:49.530> is

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
damage that's being reduced which is

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:52.009 
damage that's being reduced which is
significantly<00:03:50.609> high<00:03:50.790> so<00:03:51.090> for<00:03:51.389> armor<00:03:51.659> you<00:03:51.870> get

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 
significantly high so for armor you get

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:53.869 
significantly high so for armor you get
twenty<00:03:52.379> percent<00:03:52.620> reduction<00:03:52.799> that's<00:03:53.639> about

00:03:53.869 --> 00:03:53.879 
twenty percent reduction that's about

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:56.569 
twenty percent reduction that's about
you<00:03:54.540> know<00:03:54.629> roughly<00:03:54.840> five<00:03:55.259> percent<00:03:55.709> per<00:03:56.250> and

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:56.579 
you know roughly five percent per and

00:03:56.579 --> 00:03:59.149 
you know roughly five percent per and
then<00:03:56.790> was<00:03:56.939> 17<00:03:57.359> armor<00:03:57.689> you<00:03:57.989> get<00:03:58.319> fifty<00:03:58.979> percent

00:03:59.149 --> 00:03:59.159 
then was 17 armor you get fifty percent

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:02.449 
then was 17 armor you get fifty percent
reduction<00:03:59.370> which<00:03:59.669> is<00:03:59.819> roughly<00:04:00.150> three<00:04:01.459> percent

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
reduction which is roughly three percent

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:05.270 
reduction which is roughly three percent
reduction<00:04:02.609> per<00:04:03.269> so<00:04:03.599> you<00:04:03.689> can<00:04:03.900> see<00:04:04.079> like<00:04:04.379> as<00:04:04.560> you

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
reduction per so you can see like as you

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.490 
reduction per so you can see like as you
grow<00:04:05.519> higher<00:04:06.299> with<00:04:06.599> arm<00:04:06.840> of<00:04:06.989> values<00:04:07.259> and<00:04:07.289> you

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
grow higher with arm of values and you

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.170 
grow higher with arm of values and you
get<00:04:07.709> more<00:04:07.949> and<00:04:08.009> more<00:04:08.189> your<00:04:08.609> damage<00:04:09.000> mitigation

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
get more and more your damage mitigation

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:10.699 
get more and more your damage mitigation
is<00:04:09.599> going<00:04:09.750> to<00:04:09.810> be<00:04:09.870> less<00:04:10.079> so<00:04:10.289> it's<00:04:10.439> going<00:04:10.590> to

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709
