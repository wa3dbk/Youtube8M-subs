that<00:00:19.740> voice<00:00:20.279> chat<00:00:20.609> is<00:00:20.820> an<00:00:21.000> inherently

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
negative aspect of online gaming and I'm

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.500 
negative aspect of online gaming and I'm
sure<00:00:25.109> a<00:00:25.470> ton<00:00:25.859> of<00:00:25.890> gamers<00:00:26.340> would<00:00:26.699> passionately

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
sure a ton of gamers would passionately

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.019 
sure a ton of gamers would passionately
argue<00:00:27.900> against<00:00:28.289> that<00:00:28.640> whether<00:00:29.640> or<00:00:29.789> not<00:00:29.880> you

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
argue against that whether or not you

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.389 
argue against that whether or not you
think<00:00:30.060> that<00:00:30.420> though<00:00:30.630> that<00:00:31.590> begs<00:00:31.890> the<00:00:31.980> question

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
think that though that begs the question

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.880 
think that though that begs the question
why<00:00:32.640> not<00:00:32.820> make<00:00:33.059> voice<00:00:33.540> chat<00:00:33.870> an<00:00:34.079> option<00:00:34.620> that's

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
why not make voice chat an option that's

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.830 
why not make voice chat an option that's
disabled<00:00:35.520> by<00:00:35.700> default<00:00:35.760> yeah<00:00:36.600> I<00:00:36.630> can

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
disabled by default yeah I can

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.299 
disabled by default yeah I can
understand<00:00:37.230> Nintendo's<00:00:37.649> mentality<00:00:38.129> of

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
understand Nintendo's mentality of

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:39.799 
understand Nintendo's mentality of
wanting<00:00:38.610> to<00:00:38.640> appeal<00:00:39.210> to<00:00:39.239> families<00:00:39.540> and

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
wanting that on Nintendo's platforms but

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.990 
wanting that on Nintendo's platforms but
you<00:00:52.320> know<00:00:52.410> just<00:00:52.680> set<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.219> default<00:00:53.399> to<00:00:53.789> mute

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
and have people you know turn it on if

they want to I don't really see the

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.150 
they want to I don't really see the
point<00:00:57.719> in<00:00:57.960> completely<00:00:58.379> restricting<00:00:58.980> voice

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
point in completely restricting voice

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.369 
point in completely restricting voice
chat<00:00:59.460> for<00:00:59.699> a<00:00:59.730> primarily<00:01:00.359> team-based<00:01:00.989> game

chat for a primarily team-based game

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.709 
chat for a primarily team-based game
right<00:01:02.070> and<00:01:02.340> I<00:01:02.430> think<00:01:02.969> it's<00:01:03.059> a<00:01:03.120> classic<00:01:03.510> case<00:01:03.660> of

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
right and I think it's a classic case of

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:04.969 
right and I think it's a classic case of
a<00:01:03.899> developer<00:01:04.350> who<00:01:04.470> has<00:01:04.500> a<00:01:04.680> really

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
a developer who has a really

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.950 
a developer who has a really
well-intentioned<00:01:05.250> idea<00:01:06.090> but<00:01:06.390> just<00:01:06.570> a<00:01:06.630> total

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
well-intentioned idea but just a total

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.899 
well-intentioned idea but just a total
misunderstanding<00:01:07.260> of<00:01:07.979> how<00:01:08.040> to<00:01:08.159> approach<00:01:08.670> that

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
misunderstanding of how to approach that

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.789 
misunderstanding of how to approach that
idea<00:01:09.180> when<00:01:09.750> it's<00:01:09.869> put<00:01:10.049> into<00:01:10.170> practice<00:01:10.560> because

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
idea when it's put into practice because

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.520 
idea when it's put into practice because
team-based<00:01:11.250> shooters<00:01:12.020> basically<00:01:13.020> require

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
team-based shooters basically require

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.999 
team-based shooters basically require
voice<00:01:13.860> chat<00:01:14.840> I'm<00:01:15.840> not<00:01:16.110> sure<00:01:16.170> that<00:01:16.439> this<00:01:16.799> is<00:01:16.860> a

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
voice chat I'm not sure that this is a

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.030 
voice chat I'm not sure that this is a
decision<00:01:17.430> made<00:01:17.790> by<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:18.030> developers<00:01:18.720> of

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.040 
decision made by the developers of

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.560 
decision made by the developers of
splatoon<00:01:20.040> I<00:01:20.310> think<00:01:20.670> this<00:01:20.790> might<00:01:21.060> be<00:01:21.090> more<00:01:21.450> of

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
splatoon I think this might be more of

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.990 
splatoon I think this might be more of
an<00:01:21.689> organizational<00:01:22.380> policy<00:01:22.740> thing<00:01:23.000> because

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
an organizational policy thing because

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.640 
an organizational policy thing because
the<00:01:24.150> fact<00:01:24.360> that<00:01:24.450> party<00:01:24.840> chat<00:01:25.110> isn't<00:01:25.560> a

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
the fact that party chat isn't a

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.399 
the fact that party chat isn't a
standard<00:01:26.310> feature<00:01:26.460> on<00:01:26.850> Wii<00:01:27.060> U<00:01:27.240> is<00:01:27.479> pretty

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
standard feature on Wii U is pretty

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.800 
standard feature on Wii U is pretty
telling<00:01:28.740> as<00:01:29.040> far<00:01:29.490> as<00:01:29.520> what<00:01:29.909> Nintendo<00:01:30.390> the

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
telling as far as what Nintendo the

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.289 
telling as far as what Nintendo the
company<00:01:31.200> thinks<00:01:32.189> about<00:01:32.400> voice<00:01:32.850> chat<00:01:33.119> and<00:01:33.270> a

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
company thinks about voice chat and a

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.300 
company thinks about voice chat and a
value<00:01:33.540> of<00:01:33.630> OI<00:01:33.720> chat<00:01:34.020> I<00:01:34.259> mean<00:01:35.070> at<00:01:35.130> this<00:01:35.220> point

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
value of OI chat I mean at this point

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.710 
value of OI chat I mean at this point
it's<00:01:35.549> too<00:01:35.700> late<00:01:35.820> obviously<00:01:36.360> it's<00:01:36.509> not<00:01:36.540> going

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
it's too late obviously it's not going

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.920 
it's too late obviously it's not going
to<00:01:36.810> be<00:01:36.990> a<00:01:37.340> standard<00:01:38.340> feature<00:01:38.520> but<00:01:39.210> I<00:01:39.479> really

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
to be a standard feature but I really

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.359 
to be a standard feature but I really
really<00:01:40.259> doubt<00:01:40.439> it<00:01:40.680> has<00:01:40.770> to<00:01:40.950> do<00:01:41.100> with<00:01:41.220> their

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
really doubt it has to do with their

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:42.999 
really doubt it has to do with their

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
its to cut down on lag and I guess that

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.270 
its to cut down on lag and I guess that

with your friends I have six yeah

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:33.210 
with your friends I have six yeah
exactly<00:02:31.200> because<00:02:32.200> the<00:02:32.350> same<00:02:32.710> Otis<00:02:33.010> four

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
exactly because the same Otis four

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.700 
exactly because the same Otis four
versus<00:02:33.490> four<00:02:33.520> I<00:02:34.050> think<00:02:35.050> part<00:02:35.230> of<00:02:35.290> this<00:02:35.380> can<00:02:35.590> be

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:35.710 
versus four I think part of this can be

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:37.830 
versus four I think part of this can be
a<00:02:35.740> little<00:02:36.040> bit<00:02:36.250> just<00:02:36.400> um<00:02:36.670> lack<00:02:37.330> of<00:02:37.510> experience

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
a little bit just um lack of experience

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.800 
a little bit just um lack of experience
on<00:02:38.170> Nintendo's<00:02:38.650> part<00:02:38.920> with<00:02:39.160> creating<00:02:39.880> heavily

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
on Nintendo's part with creating heavily

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.570 
on Nintendo's part with creating heavily
online<00:02:41.380> experiences<00:02:42.070> and<00:02:42.310> heavily

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
online experiences and heavily

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.010 
online experiences and heavily
team-based<00:02:42.970> experiences<00:02:43.660> you<00:02:43.750> know<00:02:43.810> that's

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:44.020 
team-based experiences you know that's

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:45.630 
team-based experiences you know that's
that's<00:02:44.200> all<00:02:44.410> fairly<00:02:44.650> new<00:02:44.890> for<00:02:45.070> Nintendo<00:02:45.460> so

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
that's all fairly new for Nintendo so

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:46.890 
that's all fairly new for Nintendo so
maybe<00:02:45.820> they're<00:02:46.030> just<00:02:46.120> not<00:02:46.330> at<00:02:46.420> a<00:02:46.480> point<00:02:46.660> yet

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
maybe they're just not at a point yet

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.020 
maybe they're just not at a point yet
where<00:02:46.930> they<00:02:47.170> understand<00:02:47.860> the<00:02:48.490> importance<00:02:48.940> of

where they understand the importance of

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:50.820 
where they understand the importance of
that<00:02:49.180> feature<00:02:49.420> right<00:02:49.930> so<00:02:50.320> Nintendo<00:02:50.710> is

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
that feature right so Nintendo is

for<00:03:26.920> this<00:03:27.010> choice<00:03:27.250> is<00:03:27.550> so<00:03:28.090> that<00:03:28.239> battles

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
for this choice is so that battles

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:30.900 
for this choice is so that battles
online<00:03:29.470> can<00:03:29.860> really<00:03:30.130> focus<00:03:30.280> on<00:03:30.520> the<00:03:30.670> skill

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:30.910 
online can really focus on the skill

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.000 
online can really focus on the skill
that<00:03:30.940> you<00:03:31.060> gain<00:03:31.450> instead<00:03:32.320> of<00:03:32.440> the<00:03:32.530> money<00:03:32.800> and

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
that you gain instead of the money and

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:34.890 
that you gain instead of the money and
gear<00:03:33.280> that<00:03:33.459> you<00:03:33.550> have<00:03:33.820> and<00:03:34.180> then<00:03:34.360> bring<00:03:34.660> into

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
gear that you have and then bring into

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.870 
gear that you have and then bring into
the<00:03:34.989> match<00:03:35.200> which<00:03:36.130> i<00:03:36.220> think<00:03:36.280> is<00:03:36.489> actually<00:03:36.640> a

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 
the match which i think is actually a

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.850 
the match which i think is actually a
really<00:03:37.239> really<00:03:37.750> good<00:03:37.989> choice<00:03:38.290> because<00:03:38.620> it

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:38.860 
really really good choice because it

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:40.740 
really really good choice because it
makes<00:03:39.010> the<00:03:39.489> online<00:03:39.850> match<00:03:40.030> so<00:03:40.450> much<00:03:40.600> more

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
makes the online match so much more

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.340 
makes the online match so much more
about<00:03:40.930> skill<00:03:41.290> rather<00:03:41.860> than<00:03:42.209> the

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
about skill rather than the

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:45.000 
about skill rather than the
accomplishments<00:03:44.350> you've<00:03:44.470> made<00:03:44.650> in<00:03:44.860> the

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
accomplishments you've made in the

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.699 
accomplishments you've made in the
single-player<00:03:45.310> campaign<00:03:46.170> it<00:03:47.170> takes<00:03:47.410> away

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
single-player campaign it takes away

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:50.699 
single-player campaign it takes away
that<00:03:47.739> imbalance<00:03:48.400> so<00:03:49.239> i<00:03:49.780> just<00:03:50.470> think<00:03:50.650> that

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
that imbalance so i just think that

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:52.890 
that imbalance so i just think that
because<00:03:50.920> it's<00:03:51.340> so<00:03:51.550> intentionally<00:03:52.060> different

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
because it's so intentionally different

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.870 
because it's so intentionally different
from<00:03:53.380> the<00:03:53.500> way<00:03:53.650> that<00:03:53.800> other<00:03:54.010> shooters<00:03:54.459> handle

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:54.880 
from the way that other shooters handle

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.420 
from the way that other shooters handle
gear<00:03:55.450> between<00:03:56.320> offline<00:03:56.769> and<00:03:56.920> online<00:03:56.950> play

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
gear between offline and online play

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.699 
gear between offline and online play
that<00:03:58.209> people<00:03:58.450> will<00:03:58.720> struggle<00:03:59.050> to<00:03:59.230> see<00:03:59.680> the

00:03:59.699 --> 00:03:59.709 
that people will struggle to see the

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:01.800 
that people will struggle to see the
positive<00:04:00.220> effect<00:04:00.820> that<00:04:01.030> it<00:04:01.150> that<00:04:01.510> it<00:04:01.540> has<00:04:01.780> on

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:01.810 
positive effect that it that it has on

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:03.780 
positive effect that it that it has on
the<00:04:02.110> outcome<00:04:02.410> of<00:04:02.440> the<00:04:02.530> game<00:04:02.560> i<00:04:02.890> mean<00:04:03.459> i<00:04:03.489> think<00:04:03.640> a

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790 
the outcome of the game i mean i think a

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:05.850 
the outcome of the game i mean i think a
lot<00:04:03.820> of<00:04:03.970> it<00:04:04.120> depends<00:04:04.390> on<00:04:04.570> how<00:04:04.870> gear<00:04:05.380> winds<00:04:05.769> up

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:05.860 
lot of it depends on how gear winds up

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:08.820 
lot of it depends on how gear winds up
working<00:04:06.250> or<00:04:06.640> how<00:04:06.880> you<00:04:06.940> wind<00:04:07.360> up<00:04:07.769> sort<00:04:08.769> of

maybe they're they're going for an

maybe they're they're going for an
audience<00:04:39.280> that<00:04:39.550> really<00:04:39.940> isn't<00:04:40.120> used<00:04:40.480> to<00:04:40.630> like

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:42.700 
the established protocol for what you do

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:44.520 
the established protocol for what you do

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:44.530 
or don't do in an online shooter and

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:46.230 
or don't do in an online shooter and
therefore<00:04:45.310> you<00:04:45.580> know<00:04:45.670> they<00:04:45.850> can<00:04:46.000> set<00:04:46.210> their

own protocol I don't know because the

own protocol I don't know because the

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:49.810 
audience for shooters is just so big

that<00:04:50.080> I<00:04:50.230> find<00:04:50.590> it<00:04:50.710> hard<00:04:50.860> to<00:04:51.130> imagine<00:04:51.670> them

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:52.120 
that I find it hard to imagine them

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.330 
that I find it hard to imagine them
hitting<00:04:52.540> some<00:04:52.960> untapped<00:04:53.650> audience<00:04:54.130> that

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:03.430 
years precisely yeah yeah like I don't I

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:05.370 
years precisely yeah yeah like I don't I
was<00:05:03.580> gonna<00:05:03.730> so<00:05:04.000> I<00:05:04.030> would<00:05:04.540> be<00:05:04.570> careful<00:05:04.690> to

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:05.380 
was gonna so I would be careful to

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:07.560 
was gonna so I would be careful to
assume<00:05:05.950> that<00:05:06.280> they<00:05:06.670> because<00:05:07.060> they<00:05:07.210> are<00:05:07.270> trying

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:07.570 
assume that they because they are trying

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:09.090 
assume that they because they are trying
to<00:05:07.750> tread<00:05:07.930> new<00:05:08.110> ground<00:05:08.380> that<00:05:08.740> they'll<00:05:08.950> be

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:09.100 
to tread new ground that they'll be

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:10.500 
to tread new ground that they'll be
hitting<00:05:09.490> an<00:05:09.580> audience<00:05:09.940> that<00:05:10.030> has<00:05:10.270> no

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:10.510 
hitting an audience that has no

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:12.540 
hitting an audience that has no
pre-existing<00:05:11.140> assumption<00:05:11.890> well<00:05:12.070> it's<00:05:12.250> not<00:05:12.370> so

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:12.550 
pre-existing assumption well it's not so

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:13.890 
pre-existing assumption well it's not so
much<00:05:12.610> that<00:05:12.730> I<00:05:12.940> think<00:05:13.210> they<00:05:13.360> will<00:05:13.570> be<00:05:13.720> hitting

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:13.900 
much that I think they will be hitting

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:15.570 
much that I think they will be hitting
the<00:05:13.990> audience<00:05:14.470> as<00:05:14.650> it<00:05:14.770> is<00:05:14.890> I<00:05:15.040> think<00:05:15.280> they<00:05:15.430> might

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:15.580 
the audience as it is I think they might

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:18.180 
the audience as it is I think they might
be<00:05:15.610> attempting<00:05:16.300> to<00:05:16.620> hello<00:05:17.620> everybody<00:05:17.980> thank
