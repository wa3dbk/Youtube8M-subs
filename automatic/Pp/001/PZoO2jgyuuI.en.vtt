00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:53.590
 many things but I do not know if really 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:56.559
 you know what coaching is, look at the 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:58.379
 coaching is an ongoing process that

 allows you to get results 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:04.420
 extraordinary in the life of the 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:08.330
 business people and companies 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:11.290
 it has been clear to you yes no 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.290
 I already assumed 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.720
 let me tell you a story very very 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.180
 very special that for me illustrates 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.810
 perfectly what is this coaching 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.810
 yes 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:34.210
 there was once a very nice town between 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:37.570
 the mountains in which there was a group of 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:40.300
 hardened lumberjacks all of them very 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:43.440
 strong and brave who earned the 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:46.540
 life felling trees but one day 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:48.430
 they started arguing between him to see 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:52.320
 who was the strongest of all who 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.320
 was able to cut down more and more trees 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:03.070
 I am the strongest, said one not 

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:04.600
 how are you going to be you, I am the strongest 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:06.899
 I go I know the one I'm going to cut more 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.640
 trees I will not be me I'm the best 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:11.980
 and so they argued until they were 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.319
 it happened a great idea to do the first 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:17.590
 tree cutters championship 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:20.739
 of the people and so they began to compete 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:23.560
 between them until the day of the 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:26.549
 grand finale on the day when the 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.549
 two finalists 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:32.430
 if they put each of the finalists 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:35.280
 at one end of the tree and the 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.880
 two to cut down as strong as it is 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.160
 possible 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:41.450
 the champion would be the one who cut more 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.450
 trees in an hour 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:49.280
 the two began to fell and fell 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:52.190
 until after about 15 minutes the 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:55.190
 second woodcutter stopped the blows of the 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:58.610
 first lumberjack and he thought this up 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:00.860
 tired must be exhausted sure not 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:03.230
 can more but I'm going to win I'll be 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:05.840
 the champion and I will not stop cutting and 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:08.150
 he kept cutting and chopping until out 

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:11.770
 after a while back the blows of 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:11.770
 how is your opponent washing 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:19.250
 and so they kept chopping the two until 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:22.440
 that after about fifteen minutes again 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:25.590
 he stopped the blows of his opponent and 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.569
 he thought this one must be exhausted and I'm 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.760
 very tired but I will not stop I will not 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:31.800
 stop because I want to be the champion I'm going to 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.860
 prove that I am the best cutter 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:37.470
 trees all over the town and so it continued 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:39.510
 cutting until within a while of 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:42.120
 new to live the blows of his 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:44.730
 opponent who cut again and so 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:47.819
 until the time came 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:50.340
 both the two dreamers set out 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:51.659
 well up to the position where there was the 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:54.659
 jury 

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:56.640
 logically the second woodcutter was 

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:59.610
 convinced of his triumph in no 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:02.750
 moment had stopped cutting but 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:02.750
 you know who won 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.520
 He was the first woodcutter and you know 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:08.750
 what 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:12.020
 why? 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:14.350
 every time he stopped was to sharpen his 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:14.350
 ax 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:27.610
 and while I was taking the opportunity to sharpen the 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:31.180
 ax also rested 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:33.310
 and then with the sharp ax and more 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:37.110
 rested again banging more 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:37.110
 accurate and more powerful long 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:44.530
 how many times do we say we have done 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:46.540
 everything we could but without 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:48.490
 results 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:50.620
 how many times do we say we have done 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:55.260
 everything we could do before a 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:58.960
 problem but it really was like that and 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:05:01.350
 We have really done what we should 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.350
 do 

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:15.280
 this is coaching a powerful vision 

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:18.070
 Exterior 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:21.230
 see and discover things that we alone 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:23.690
 we are not able to find 

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:25.520
 the tools we need to 

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:29.360
 make our goals and 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:32.140
 get to see light where before there was only 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.140
 darkness 

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:37.520
 If you want to start a new life 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:41.449
 if you want to achieve your goals and 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:43.430
 make you your dreams call me remember the 

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:47.900
 Longest path starts with a simple 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:50.020
 step if you want you can you can 

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:50.020
 to get it
