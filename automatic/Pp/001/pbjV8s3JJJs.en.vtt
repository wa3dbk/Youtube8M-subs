you're studying anatomy biology etc
human<00:00:29.429> biology<00:00:29.779> one<00:00:30.779> of<00:00:30.840> the<00:00:30.900> things<00:00:31.050> to<00:00:32.690> note

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
human biology one of the things to note

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.299 
human biology one of the things to note
is<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:34.670> slider<00:00:36.350> object<00:00:37.350> here<00:00:37.649> allows<00:00:38.010> you<00:00:38.190> to

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
is the slider object here allows you to

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.380 
is the slider object here allows you to
slide<00:00:38.579> down<00:00:38.879> in<00:00:39.149> to<00:00:39.360> see<00:00:40.640> specific<00:00:41.640> things<00:00:41.879> or

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
slide down in to see specific things or

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.330 
slide down in to see specific things or
rather<00:00:42.899> remove<00:00:43.710> layers<00:00:45.620> and<00:00:46.620> one<00:00:47.129> of<00:00:47.250> the

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
rather remove layers and one of the

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.389 
rather remove layers and one of the
things<00:00:47.610> I<00:00:48.000> am<00:00:48.420> interested<00:00:49.050> in<00:00:49.200> is<00:00:49.469> kidneys<00:00:50.010> and

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
things I am interested in is kidneys and

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.850 
things I am interested in is kidneys and
bladder<00:00:51.559> so<00:00:52.559> let's<00:00:53.340> zoom<00:00:53.610> in<00:00:54.270> and<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:55.500> kidneys

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
bladder so let's zoom in and the kidneys

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.220 
bladder so let's zoom in and the kidneys
are<00:00:55.890> right<00:00:56.879> here<00:00:58.520> click<00:00:59.520> on<00:00:59.670> it<00:01:00.020> kidney<00:01:01.020> and

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
are right here click on it kidney and

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.889 
are right here click on it kidney and
then<00:01:01.440> you<00:01:01.680> can<00:01:01.800> use<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.190> staple<00:01:03.149> or<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.690> pen

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
then you can use the staple or the pen

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.039 
then you can use the staple or the pen
tool<00:01:04.140> so<00:01:04.500> it<00:01:04.680> stays<00:01:04.949> and<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:06.510> same<00:01:06.720> for<00:01:06.960> the

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
tool so it stays and the same for the

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:13.850 
tool so it stays and the same for the
other<00:01:07.140> one<00:01:07.320> and<00:01:08.960> the<00:01:10.250> these<00:01:11.250> two<00:01:11.960> tubes<00:01:12.960> this

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
other one and the these two tubes this

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.370 
other one and the these two tubes this
one<00:01:14.100> let's<00:01:14.640> see<00:01:14.790> if<00:01:14.880> it'll<00:01:15.060> yes<00:01:15.869> okay<00:01:16.229> the

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
one let's see if it'll yes okay the

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.920 
one let's see if it'll yes okay the
ureter<00:01:16.650> one<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:18.299> you<00:01:19.259> Reacher

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:20.930 
ureter one and you Reacher

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.810 
ureter one and you Reacher
two

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
two

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:29.410 
two
and<00:01:23.940> of<00:01:24.420> course<00:01:24.690> the<00:01:24.960> bladder<00:01:27.170> right<00:01:28.170> here<00:01:28.770> and

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
and of course the bladder right here and

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.670 
and of course the bladder right here and
bladder<00:01:31.130> so<00:01:32.130> now<00:01:32.280> we<00:01:32.340> can<00:01:32.780> assume<00:01:33.780> rather

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
bladder so now we can assume rather

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.330 
bladder so now we can assume rather
remove<00:01:35.580> all<00:01:35.940> of<00:01:36.090> the<00:01:36.210> other<00:01:37.340> surrounding

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
remove all of the other surrounding

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.640 
remove all of the other surrounding
organs<00:01:38.940> for<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.480> most<00:01:39.630> part<00:01:39.930> I<00:01:40.110> think<00:01:40.380> these

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
organs for the most part I think these

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:46.340 
organs for the most part I think these
are<00:01:41.430> arteries<00:01:42.420> and<00:01:42.630> veins<00:01:44.330> or<00:01:45.330> bones<00:01:45.900> they

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
are arteries and veins or bones they

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.040 
are arteries and veins or bones they
might<00:01:46.530> be<00:01:46.650> the<00:01:46.800> bones<00:01:47.070> no<00:01:47.760> I'm<00:01:48.150> not<00:01:48.630> sure<00:01:48.840> what

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:49.050 
might be the bones no I'm not sure what

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:51.700 
might be the bones no I'm not sure what
those<00:01:49.200> are<00:01:49.470> let's<00:01:49.680> see<00:01:49.920> we<00:01:50.790> zoom<00:01:51.030> in<00:01:51.270> on<00:01:51.450> one

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710 
those are let's see we zoom in on one

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.240 
those are let's see we zoom in on one
see<00:01:52.710> what<00:01:52.860> it<00:01:52.950> says<00:01:53.160> oh<00:01:54.830> these<00:01:55.830> are<00:01:56.010> nerves

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
see what it says oh these are nerves

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:03.260 
see what it says oh these are nerves
okay<00:01:56.640> so<00:01:59.690> these<00:02:00.690> are<00:02:00.750> the<00:02:00.930> nerves<00:02:02.270> major

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
okay so these are the nerves major

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:04.820 
okay so these are the nerves major
nerves<00:02:03.630> presumably<00:02:04.229> and<00:02:04.410> let's<00:02:04.560> see<00:02:04.680> what

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:04.830 
nerves presumably and let's see what

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:09.380 
nerves presumably and let's see what
this<00:02:05.010> is<00:02:06.770> it's<00:02:07.770> a<00:02:08.040> sciatic<00:02:08.580> nerve<00:02:08.760> yes<00:02:09.000> okay<00:02:09.330> so

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
this is it's a sciatic nerve yes okay so

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.820 
this is it's a sciatic nerve yes okay so
we're<00:02:09.630> looking<00:02:09.899> at<00:02:09.990> major<00:02:10.170> nerves<00:02:10.500> here<00:02:10.770> so

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
we're looking at major nerves here so

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.780 
we're looking at major nerves here so
here's<00:02:13.830> the<00:02:14.100> bladder<00:02:14.340> and<00:02:14.670> the<00:02:15.120> ureter<00:02:15.360> and

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
here's the bladder and the ureter and

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.100 
here's the bladder and the ureter and
look<00:02:17.790> at<00:02:17.910> that<00:02:18.000> you<00:02:18.180> can<00:02:18.330> actually<00:02:18.480> look<00:02:18.810> at<00:02:18.990> it

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
look at that you can actually look at it

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:24.290 
look at that you can actually look at it
from<00:02:19.350> the<00:02:19.590> top<00:02:19.620> as<00:02:20.100> well<00:02:20.130> so<00:02:22.580> that's<00:02:23.580> what<00:02:24.090> the

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
from the top as well so that's what the

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.740 
from the top as well so that's what the
bladder<00:02:24.600> and<00:02:25.340> that's<00:02:26.340> how<00:02:26.459> the<00:02:26.520> kidneys<00:02:27.150> drain

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
bladder and that's how the kidneys drain

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.680 
bladder and that's how the kidneys drain
into<00:02:28.230> the<00:02:28.680> bladder<00:02:28.890> and<00:02:31.010> there<00:02:32.010> are<00:02:32.250> two

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
into the bladder and there are two

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.740 
into the bladder and there are two
entries<00:02:33.690> into<00:02:34.020> the<00:02:34.260> bladder<00:02:35.360> and<00:02:36.360> of<00:02:36.510> course

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
entries into the bladder and of course

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.180 
entries into the bladder and of course
one<00:02:36.930> exit<00:02:37.850> so<00:02:39.500> yeah<00:02:40.500> if<00:02:40.680> you're<00:02:40.890> studying

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
one exit so yeah if you're studying

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.440 
one exit so yeah if you're studying
human<00:02:42.180> biology<00:02:42.739> zygote<00:02:43.739> body<00:02:44.040> calm<00:02:44.610> very<00:02:45.120> well

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
human biology zygote body calm very well

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.960 
human biology zygote body calm very well
worth<00:02:45.690> your<00:02:45.900> time<00:02:46.110> and<00:02:46.519> again<00:02:47.519> if<00:02:47.640> you<00:02:47.730> want<00:02:47.910> to

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
worth your time and again if you want to

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.630 
worth your time and again if you want to
zoom<00:02:48.330> out<00:02:48.800> to<00:02:49.800> see<00:02:49.830> everything<00:02:50.519> and

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
zoom out to see everything and

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.850 
zoom out to see everything and
surrounding<00:02:51.180> it<00:02:51.300> just<00:02:51.840> as<00:02:51.989> easy<00:02:52.200> is<00:02:52.680> that<00:02:54.860> okay

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
surrounding it just as easy is that okay

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:01.740 
surrounding it just as easy is that okay
