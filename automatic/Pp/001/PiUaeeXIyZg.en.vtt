00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
screen you can tell right now that this

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.590 
screen you can tell right now that this
touchscreen<00:01:47.080> is<00:01:47.530> not<00:01:47.770> a<00:01:48.600> capacitance

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 
touchscreen is not a capacitance

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.270 
touchscreen is not a capacitance
touchscreen<00:01:50.140> like<00:01:50.680> on<00:01:50.830> the<00:01:50.920> iphone

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
touchscreen like on the iphone

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.430 
touchscreen like on the iphone
unfortunately<00:01:51.970> it's<00:01:52.600> a<00:01:52.720> resistance<00:01:53.140> screen

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:53.440 
unfortunately it's a resistance screen

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.440 
unfortunately it's a resistance screen
it<00:01:53.560> requires<00:01:53.860> a<00:01:53.980> little<00:01:54.130> bit<00:01:54.280> of<00:01:54.370> pushing<00:01:54.640> to

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
it requires a little bit of pushing to

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:02.010 
it requires a little bit of pushing to
make<00:01:55.480> it<00:01:55.720> work<00:01:55.900> but<00:01:55.930> it<00:01:56.620> does<00:01:56.770> work<00:01:57.240> and<00:02:01.020> let's

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
make it work but it does work and let's

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:09.570 
make it work but it does work and let's
try<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:03.610> dice<00:02:03.820> game<00:02:03.850> oh<00:02:07.980> yeah<00:02:08.980> you<00:02:09.369> have<00:02:09.490> an

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
try the dice game oh yeah you have an

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.460 
try the dice game oh yeah you have an
accelerometer<00:02:09.910> is<00:02:10.330> 22<00:02:10.810> just<00:02:11.140> like<00:02:11.230> I<00:02:11.260> do<00:02:11.440> in

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
accelerometer is 22 just like I do in

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.760 
accelerometer is 22 just like I do in
the<00:02:11.620> iphone<00:02:11.980> pretty<00:02:12.580> fun<00:02:13.200> and<00:02:14.200> then<00:02:14.500> you<00:02:14.620> get

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
the iphone pretty fun and then you get

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:19.520 
the iphone pretty fun and then you get
into<00:02:15.330> some<00:02:16.330> pretty<00:02:16.410> I<00:02:17.410> guess<00:02:18.400> only<00:02:18.850> in<00:02:19.000> Korea

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
into some pretty I guess only in Korea

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.640 
into some pretty I guess only in Korea
applications<00:02:20.820> this<00:02:21.820> one<00:02:22.030> I<00:02:22.380> sort<00:02:23.380> of<00:02:23.470> love
