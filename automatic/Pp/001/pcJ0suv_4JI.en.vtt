00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:20.840
 Greetings to all I am Diana 10 bringing you 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:22.280
 the most important news in the world 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:26.360
 geek 

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:29.480
 let's start a long time ago they went to the 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:32.360
 light some pictures of a supposed costume 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:35.810
 spider-man in civil war that many 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:38.650
 they claimed was the officer in shades red 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:41.270
 and black but the same joe quesada 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:44.360
 confirmed that the suit will respect the 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:48.290
 original blue and color scheme 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:50.330
 red being the blue a darker tone and 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:53.660
 the cobwebs that draw the costume 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:57.350
 they would be black with a glimpse 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:01:00.680
 Also, there could be more than one 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:03.050
 spider-man costume in the movie and 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.570
 making reference to this that can 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:08.360
 have more than one suit a new 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.580
 rumor because they can not miss talks about 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:13.659
 that the first suit that we would see 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:17.210
 trepamuros would be one created by himself 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:20.479
 it would be later in the course of the 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:23.690
 movie that Tony Stark would give him the 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:26.900
 classic costume that we all know 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:29.690
 even on the internet a 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:32.360
 poor quality image that allows us 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:35.690
 see spider-man in what will be the costume 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:38.960
 which will be shown next Saturday in the 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:42.680
 of 23 can not be confirmed to science 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:45.470
 true if the image is real or another frame 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.720
 like that of the post-credit scene of 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:50.780
 the avengers the era of a throne where 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:54.560
 it was supposed to appear spider-man 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:57.619
 soon we will know and if they believed that 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:00.229
 it was all about civil war because they have not 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:02.750
 Rumors have emerged of the possible cause of 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:05.240
 trigger that will give way to the events of 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:08.929
 the civil war in the third part of the 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:11.150
 captain america this is another spoiler in 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:14.739
 if it is confirmed that it is true 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:17.870
 so continue at your own risk 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:20.900
 this says that the america captain and the 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:23.450
 Scarlet witch try to stop to cross 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:27.320
 ghosn who wore a suicide vest 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:29.840
 full of bombs the cap commands the witch 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:32.840
 scarlet that makes the villain levitate 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.940
 to avoid disaster unfortunately not 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.700
 was able to contain the powerful 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:41.030
 explosion that takes place near a 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:44.330
 building full of people causing many 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:47.269
 deaths and great destruction certainly 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:50.510
 it's something that had already been speculated but 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:53.599
 there were not many details 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.519
 only time will tell if this rumor is 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:57.980
 true 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:03:00.500
 let's continue 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:03.290
 a shared image through 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:05.000
 twitter by the same jared leto who 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:08.720
 will give life to the joker in 'the squadron 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.450
 suicide has sparked a debate over whether 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.870
 in the movie we will see a version of the 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:16.690
 murderous joke 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:20.080
 although it is only a shadow that is left 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:21.580
 see this reminds us of a vignette of 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.400
 said comic 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:26.019
 maybe it's true or maybe they're just 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.019
 playing with our minds 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:32.140
 the rumors make the expectation grow 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:35.190
 of the fans and without a doubt this 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:38.020
 image has succeeded 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:41.230
 let's continue 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:44.410
 the konstantin series was canceled in 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:47.380
 May this year with very few episodes 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:51.150
 but for fans who want to see more 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:53.890
 there's good news john constantine 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:56.680
 will appear in the arrow series as 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:59.710
 special guest in an episode of the 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:03.580
 fourth season although not specified 

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:05.940
 which is the same Matt Ryan actor who gave him 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:09.580
 life to constantin in the television series 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:11.530
 I would interpret it as a consolation 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:14.800
 for those who want to see a little 

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:16.760
 more of this character 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:19.340
 to end 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:21.860
 at this point it's no surprise 

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:25.070
 the bad reception that the 

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:27.710
 movie of the fantastic four but 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:31.460
 fox has not given up on these 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:33.770
 characters ensuring their commitment without 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:36.590
 rule out that there may be a 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:39.890
 but then at the same time it has 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:43.280
 emerged rumor that perhaps cox 

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:45.710
 do not be so sure leaving aside the 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:48.770
 second part of the fantastic four 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:50.110
 to make way for a sequel to 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:52.840
 deadpool 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:55.690
 although it has not been released nor the first 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:58.150
 part of the good reception that the 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:05:01.600
 trailer and the fandom that follows this 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:05.080
 character would give them something safer with 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:07.770
 what may be more successful but still 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:10.960
 it's too early to say anything 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:13.810
 but for now the future of the universe 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:18.370
 superheroic the fox is in the 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:20.260
 uncertainty what do you think you would say 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:23.320
 that the image in which the 

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:26.740
 Spider-man costume is real or just a 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:29.860
 fake that seems to them the possible cause that 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:32.880
 it is speculated would be the trigger for 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:35.490
 make way for this war 

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:38.190
 would like to see a version of the joke 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:39.680
 murderer in the squad film 

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:42.740
 suicide 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:46.039
 what can they say about the appearance of 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:49.039
 constantin in the series of arrow that 

00:05:46.039 --> 00:05:52.759
 believe that fox should do with the 

00:05:49.039 --> 00:05:54.490
 fantastic four let me know in 

00:05:52.759 --> 00:05:57.910
 the comments 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:57.910
 until next time
