this Red Ranger Power Ranger you know

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:22.130 
this Red Ranger Power Ranger you know
stuff<00:00:20.610> I<00:00:21.090> feel<00:00:21.570> like<00:00:21.660> I've<00:00:21.810> been<00:00:21.840> doing<00:00:22.110> this

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
stuff I feel like I've been doing this

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.750 
stuff I feel like I've been doing this
way<00:00:22.500> too<00:00:22.560> much<00:00:22.890> over<00:00:23.100> the<00:00:23.220> last<00:00:23.250> couple<00:00:23.460> days

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
way too much over the last couple days

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.940 
way too much over the last couple days
but<00:00:24.060> um<00:00:24.300> the<00:00:25.020> technique<00:00:25.380> that<00:00:25.529> I'm<00:00:25.650> coloring

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:25.950 
but um the technique that I'm coloring

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:29.540 
but um the technique that I'm coloring
in<00:00:26.250> here<00:00:26.310> is<00:00:27.060> it's<00:00:27.360> a<00:00:27.480> quick<00:00:27.690> simple<00:00:28.290> way<00:00:28.590> well

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
in here is it's a quick simple way well

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.220 
in here is it's a quick simple way well
I<00:00:29.820> don't<00:00:30.360> say<00:00:30.570> quick<00:00:30.750> and<00:00:30.900> simple<00:00:31.020> because

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
I don't say quick and simple because

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.570 
I don't say quick and simple because
that<00:00:31.380> makes<00:00:31.530> it<00:00:31.620> sound<00:00:31.830> a<00:00:32.160> little<00:00:32.309> bit<00:00:32.460> easier

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:32.580 
that makes it sound a little bit easier

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:34.940 
that makes it sound a little bit easier
than<00:00:32.850> it<00:00:32.970> is<00:00:33.090> but<00:00:33.330> I<00:00:33.600> learned<00:00:34.440> how<00:00:34.590> to<00:00:34.650> do<00:00:34.800> this

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
than it is but I learned how to do this

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.100

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
you're into it so ideally what i'm doing

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.580 
you're into it so ideally what i'm doing
here<00:01:21.360> is<00:01:21.420> i'm<00:01:21.600> just<00:01:21.659> working<00:01:21.930> in<00:01:22.140> grayscale

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
here is i'm just working in grayscale

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.260 
here is i'm just working in grayscale
that<00:01:23.250> way<00:01:23.340> i<00:01:23.369> could<00:01:23.610> see<00:01:23.850> what's<00:01:24.000> going<00:01:24.210> on

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.670 
that way i could see what's going on
it's<00:01:24.479> much<00:01:24.659> simpler<00:01:25.049> it's<00:01:25.229> much<00:01:25.350> easier<00:01:25.380> for

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
it's much simpler it's much easier for

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.279 
it's much simpler it's much easier for
me<00:01:25.920> to<00:01:25.950> pick<00:01:26.430> it<00:01:26.549> out<00:01:26.750> you<00:01:27.750> know<00:01:27.869> i'm<00:01:28.079> only

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:47.510 
that's in there all I wanted to do is
lighten<00:04:44.190> it<00:04:44.340> up<00:04:44.430> and<00:04:46.040> it'll<00:04:47.040> look<00:04:47.160> weird<00:04:47.340> at

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
lighten it up and it'll look weird at

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.310 
lighten it up and it'll look weird at
first<00:04:47.550> but<00:04:48.180> I<00:04:48.600> do<00:04:48.690> a<00:04:48.720> little<00:04:48.870> trick<00:04:49.080> to<00:04:49.200> get

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:49.320 
first but I do a little trick to get

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:53.390 
first but I do a little trick to get
around<00:04:49.470> that<00:04:50.960> and<00:04:51.960> you'll<00:04:52.950> see<00:04:53.070> me<00:04:53.190> here<00:04:53.340> I'm

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.400 
around that and you'll see me here I'm

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:54.890 
around that and you'll see me here I'm
changing<00:04:53.790> a<00:04:53.850> hue/saturation<00:04:54.030> you<00:04:54.690> can<00:04:54.810> see

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900 
changing a hue/saturation you can see

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:56.060 
changing a hue/saturation you can see
like<00:04:55.020> the<00:04:55.110> white<00:04:55.260> looks<00:04:55.470> cool<00:04:55.680> like<00:04:55.890> I<00:04:55.950> thought

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:56.070 
like the white looks cool like I thought

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:57.500 
like the white looks cool like I thought
it<00:04:56.130> looked<00:04:56.250> cool<00:04:56.340> but<00:04:56.790> it<00:04:56.910> flattens<00:04:57.270> it<00:04:57.360> out

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:57.510 
it looked cool but it flattens it out

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:59.480 
it looked cool but it flattens it out
and<00:04:57.780> it<00:04:58.290> doesn't<00:04:58.560> make<00:04:58.650> it<00:04:58.830> you<00:04:59.130> know<00:04:59.160> i'm

00:04:59.480 --> 00:04:59.490 
and it doesn't make it you know i'm

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:00.710 
and it doesn't make it you know i'm
losing<00:04:59.669> all<00:04:59.940> that<00:05:00.030> cool<00:05:00.240> detail<00:05:00.600> and<00:05:00.690> the

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720 
losing all that cool detail and the

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.440 
losing all that cool detail and the
knuckles<00:05:01.110> and<00:05:01.229> stuff<00:05:01.790> so<00:05:02.790> again<00:05:03.000> worrying

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:03.450 
knuckles and stuff so again worrying

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:04.909 
knuckles and stuff so again worrying
about<00:05:03.660> that<00:05:03.900> color<00:05:04.169> bounce<00:05:04.380> that<00:05:04.590> wasn't

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:04.919 
about that color bounce that wasn't

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:07.159 
about that color bounce that wasn't
working<00:05:05.330> black<00:05:06.330> and<00:05:06.510> white<00:05:06.660> I<00:05:06.870> tried<00:05:07.140> that

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:07.169 
working black and white I tried that

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:08.570 
working black and white I tried that
that<00:05:07.560> I<00:05:07.830> don't<00:05:08.130> even<00:05:08.190> know<00:05:08.310> what<00:05:08.400> the<00:05:08.550> hell

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:08.580 
that I don't even know what the hell

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:12.969 
that I don't even know what the hell
that<00:05:08.729> did<00:05:10.640> so<00:05:11.640> i<00:05:11.669> just<00:05:11.850> made<00:05:12.000> a<00:05:12.030> new<00:05:12.090> layer<00:05:12.510> and

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:12.979 
that did so i just made a new layer and

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:15.860 
that did so i just made a new layer and
i<00:05:13.979> picked<00:05:14.580> white<00:05:14.850> and<00:05:15.090> i<00:05:15.180> just<00:05:15.360> drew<00:05:15.600> over

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:15.870 
i picked white and i just drew over

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:18.830 
i picked white and i just drew over
everything<00:05:16.800> with<00:05:17.550> the<00:05:17.850> airbrush<00:05:18.120> again<00:05:18.479> just
