sometimes looking at our code and help
us<00:02:36.640> out<00:02:36.760> with<00:02:36.880> shaders<00:02:37.270> and<00:02:37.300> eating<00:02:37.840> us<00:02:37.930> up<00:02:38.080> to

people out here for a set period of time
working<00:02:42.750> independent<00:02:43.750> and<00:02:43.900> really

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
working independent and really

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.390

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:47.739 
done and I think that the relationship

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:49.260 
done and I think that the relationship
worked<00:02:48.220> out<00:02:48.310> really<00:02:48.430> well<00:02:48.580> and<00:02:48.850> the<00:02:49.120> work

worked out really well and the work

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:51.600 
worked out really well and the work

that<00:02:51.730> we<00:02:51.819> really<00:02:52.060> knew<00:02:52.209> Houdini<00:02:52.569> was

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
that we really knew Houdini was

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.420 
that we really knew Houdini was
excellent<00:02:53.200> with<00:02:53.290> particles<00:02:53.800> and<00:02:54.160> effects

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
excellent with particles and effects

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:55.860 
excellent with particles and effects

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
animation things like that and certainly

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.229 
animation things like that and certainly
unique<00:02:56.800> has<00:02:56.950> become<00:02:57.220> really<00:02:57.640> entrenched<00:02:58.090> on

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
unique has become really entrenched on

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:00.150

how<00:02:58.390> to<00:02:58.450> continue<00:02:59.260> to<00:02:59.320> use<00:02:59.440> it<00:02:59.590> for<00:02:59.709> dynamics

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
how to continue to use it for dynamics

and<00:03:00.280> particles<00:03:00.640> and<00:03:00.820> things<00:03:01.000> like<00:03:01.180> that<00:03:01.500> but

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
and particles and things like that but

create an entire digital environment was

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.520 
create an entire digital environment was
something<00:03:06.880> that<00:03:07.060> was<00:03:07.300> new<00:03:07.750> to<00:03:07.900> me<00:03:07.930> when<00:03:08.380> we

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
something that was new to me when we

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.199 
something that was new to me when we
when<00:03:08.800> we<00:03:08.890> can<00:03:09.070> start<00:03:09.310> talking<00:03:09.459> about<00:03:09.640> it<00:03:09.910> did<00:03:10.180> a

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209 
when we can start talking about it did a

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:12.540 
when we can start talking about it did a
fantastic<00:03:10.360> job<00:03:10.750> it<00:03:11.110> really<00:03:11.410> improved<00:03:12.250> itself

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:12.550 
fantastic job it really improved itself

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:39.040 
fantastic job it really improved itself
to<00:03:12.640> me<00:03:12.700> as<00:03:12.820> being<00:03:13.030> an<00:03:13.300> entire<00:03:13.630> 3d<00:03:14.620> solution

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:39.050 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:41.270 

we<00:03:40.050> were<00:03:40.110> able<00:03:40.290> to<00:03:40.470> create<00:03:40.770> this<00:03:40.920> entire

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
we were able to create this entire

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.220 
we were able to create this entire
environment<00:03:41.610> set<00:03:42.510> up<00:03:42.600> where<00:03:42.780> we<00:03:42.900> wanted<00:03:43.140> the

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
environment set up where we wanted the

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:44.450 
environment set up where we wanted the
light<00:03:43.410> to<00:03:43.560> be<00:03:43.710> and<00:03:43.920> what<00:03:44.100> all<00:03:44.250> the

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:44.460 
light to be and what all the

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:45.920 
light to be and what all the
displacement<00:03:45.000> and<00:03:45.090> the<00:03:45.120> shaders<00:03:45.480> and<00:03:45.690> all<00:03:45.780> the

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
displacement and the shaders and all the

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:47.150 
displacement and the shaders and all the
stuff<00:03:46.110> looked<00:03:46.380> like<00:03:46.560> then<00:03:46.740> really<00:03:46.950> kind<00:03:47.040> of

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
stuff looked like then really kind of

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.160 
stuff looked like then really kind of
established<00:03:47.550> it<00:03:47.640> once<00:03:47.940> and<00:03:48.600> at<00:03:48.690> that<00:03:48.840> point<00:03:48.990> it

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 
established it once and at that point it

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:50.660 
established it once and at that point it
really<00:03:49.200> was<00:03:49.500> pretty<00:03:49.560> fairly<00:03:50.100> straightforward

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
really was pretty fairly straightforward

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.430 
really was pretty fairly straightforward
on<00:03:50.730> a<00:03:50.760> shop<00:03:51.060> production<00:03:51.480> level<00:03:51.810> to<00:03:52.080> to<00:03:52.290> just

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
on a shop production level to to just

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.140 
on a shop production level to to just
bring<00:03:52.800> in<00:03:52.950> the<00:03:52.980> camera<00:03:53.370> and<00:03:53.490> render<00:03:53.850> it<00:03:53.880> and

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
bring in the camera and render it and

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:55.850 
bring in the camera and render it and
you<00:03:54.870> know<00:03:54.960> we<00:03:55.080> knew<00:03:55.200> that<00:03:55.320> wherever<00:03:55.620> you<00:03:55.740> put

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:55.860 
you know we knew that wherever you put

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:58.880 
you know we knew that wherever you put
the<00:03:55.980> camera<00:03:56.190> it<00:03:56.340> was<00:03:56.400> going<00:03:56.580> to<00:03:56.670> look<00:03:56.730> good
