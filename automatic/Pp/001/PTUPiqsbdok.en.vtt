00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:11.440
 hello how about galaxy friends that I 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:14.049
 I am a very g is a brancheau of the new 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:16.419
 driver of this channel because today they 

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:18.490
 we have to talk about this case that we 

00:00:16.419 --> 00:00:22.300
 They did please send our friends 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:24.939
 of urban ar because it is a cover for 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.890
 nou 3 stay right there because I already 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:30.009
 we started and well let's see what comes 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:32.529
 inside the box to see then as 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:34.120
 how are these accessories and you 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:37.120
 can see what they get 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.739
 Once they want one of these covers 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.629
 well then before opening the box to 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:42.220
 see the content let's review the 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:45.820
 specifications that come on the back 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:49.180
 of the same the second says that it is of 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:52.059
 easy access so we can put it 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:55.360
 and remove easily 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:57.339
 let's ask him a little about some 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.229
 tests that we have done but good 

00:00:57.339 --> 00:01:00.210
 we continue good also has 

00:00:59.229 --> 00:01:02.920
 surfaces 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.930
 anti-skid that I think we 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.549
 he agreed a lot in the moment he leaves in those 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.810
 uncomfortable moments that we drop the 

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:08.790
 cell phones and we balance the 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.980
 hands 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:14.310
 another characteristic is that it is 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:16.680
 ultra light right now let's see if yes 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:20.010
 an important one is also that he has the 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.110
 flash did not reflect this this 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:25.230
 characteristic is good because I do not know if 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:28.050
 it has happened to them that sometimes with 12 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:30.479
 sets of colors when taking a 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:31.979
 photo with flash returns the color of 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.590
 the cover for example if they have a board 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.790
 Rose maybe the photos they take 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:41.810
 to buy 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:43.430
 because he returns to this disguise is a 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.860
 new reflex because it is a good 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.870
 characteristic and finally we also 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:51.290
 says that this box contains a protector 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:53.660
 HD is to protect our 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.760
 any extra rayon device that 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:57.410
 can be provoked and well we are going to 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.600
 see what 's in the box for 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:01.550
 see what you receive when you acquire 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:05.290
 one of these multiple urban covers 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:05.290
 Well, this is the back 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:13.990
 there is the surface that is what we 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:17.650
 will serve to defend them from 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:19.900
 cellular impacts to how we see the 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.640
 sides has the surface 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.380
 anti-slip that we had commented 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.710
 Also honeycomb like design 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.710
 previous 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:31.470
 this is rubber which makes me have a 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:33.990
 better grip and it feels very good and in 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.090
 true that the case is light 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:37.440
 complements very well with the team and 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.750
 good about all the details as they are 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.030
 extremely good they do not have any 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.890
 type of discounts on it is very good and 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.900
 the materials that I certainly have santé 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.760
 a very good finish then here 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.130
 we will also see the holes that 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:53.550
 they come well pretty well they do not have 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:55.650
 any kind of detail of revavá here in 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:58.050
 the bottom part because they have the space 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:01.020
 for the spin for the speakers for the 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:03.450
 3.0 usb port and for the microphone there 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:05.490
 It has no little detail it works 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.230
 well fits perfectly in our 

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:10.080
 team on top too 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:12.720
 we found the port the hole for 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.400
 infrared sport and for the other 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.220
 microphone and for the hearing aid port 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.320
 3.5 millimeter urman designs 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.450
 when dying they are finished pretty 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:23.340
 good as you can see fit the 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:26.130
 perfection and they do not have any kind of 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:28.350
 details this here as you can see it 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:30.600
 complements it because it perfectly gives 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:36.550
 a design a look 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:39.190
 interesting and so it is in this design as 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:42.040
 kind of astronaut something like this you see is very 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:44.650
 striking the case feels very good 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:48.690
 has a very good king gives night 3 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:52.330
 and this one here to see because it looks 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:54.580
 extremely good already on your device 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:57.840
 well now let's try how easy 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:57.840
 is to remove it 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:04.620
 that's right let's see how fast we're going 

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:04.620
 to start 3 2 1 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.900
 Y 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:26.560
 and ready to see the armor hormone covers 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:26.560
 they have an excellent grip 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:33.560
 It's a bit slow to remove it 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:35.060
 say it but that ensures that then 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.220
 device will be completely 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:39.080
 fixed and secure within one of them 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:42.260
 so then if we recommend them 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:44.630

 operation as you can see is a 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:56.120
 Very striking case but it looks pretty 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:58.310

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:02.419
