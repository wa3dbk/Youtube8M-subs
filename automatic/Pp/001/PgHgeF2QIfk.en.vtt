 the staff is fine if it will be well 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.210
 specific to who is starting the 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.550
 confrontation for some specific reason 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.190
 It has to be opening his body. 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.980

 model 1.1.1're ready actually just right 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.230
 that with another controller is as follows 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.730
 It would be the second version of the futon okay I 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.560
 I will not get into the understanding of the then it 's just 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.859
 The first step you take the apps is 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.380
 they happy to accent the labels 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.540
 where the front is suddenly stuck 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.850
 on the bottom as you can see 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.140
 already loosened the screws and that's what I 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.300
 I will show you what the 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.800
 products you need to drop 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.020

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.430
 installed the team follow ball and returned 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.710

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.090
 How to configure it is there at last 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.070
 so the people are going to have to drop 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.430
 four bolts here more internally 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.899

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:05.010
 drop and I'll show you'll have to 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:08.670

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:11.159

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.820

 A screw with the philips connection is a 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:39.240
