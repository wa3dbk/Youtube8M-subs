00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.279
 one of the things that can not be 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.200
 the good fisherman is the bait but how will it 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.210
 that they are produced 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.219
 You will meet two breeders who 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.950
 saw on earth a new kind of 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.080
 investment for the account of the 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.600
 low cost many people are interested 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.880
 by my culture that, besides serving as a 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.160
 attractive for fish is used as 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.529
 cheap source of meat for food 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.109
 production of small animals and also in 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:31.199
 of humus for the fisherman 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:34.950
 the image is very familiar and on the ground as 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:36.809
 this israel that is not lacking in the municipality 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.390
 of victory Brazil we met two 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.430
 seven months ago started 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.850
 to see on earth a new kind of 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.950
 investment with a little puppy and 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.910
 Thank God it was there. 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.840
 increasing 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:54.510
 we have a pretty puppy today 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.809
 we're getting enough big worms 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.960
 already selling and it's okay well 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.399
 assuming the position is Eduard 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.979
 which has guaranteed the sale to the 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.560
 shops and for fishermen who 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.650
 look for the baits the place is still 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.680
 small are 16 beds of 50 meters 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:17.189
 where they are produced from 80 to 100 kilograms 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:20.549
 African worm per week 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:22.590
 the price per liter comes to 10 reais and so 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.900
 as in other creations here it is also 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:28.049
 I need to make fat and feed 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.299
 reinforced filter cake more known 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.549
 by the residue of the sugarcane 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.500
 buchinho that is nothing more than the grass 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.090
 that stays in the stomach of the cow 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.119
 after the animal is slaughtered in the 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.340
 refrigerator and everything is mixed to the ground 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.170
 wait just two 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.409
 months and has another ingredient 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:50.520
 indispensable can not help missing 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:53.970
 Water in you has put a link here is in the 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:57.060
 myocardium and in fashion twice a day 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:02:00.000
 which have to maintain uniform humidity because 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.350
 They do not like the heat. 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.469
 sun very hot 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:07.350
 production is reduced, so it is 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:09.509
 keep the soil moist in days 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.970
 As cold as it is today it is not as 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.069
 The challenge is to ensure the 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:15.560
 production on day 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:18.170
 with warmer temperatures by 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.030
 that they make this mulch 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.069
 are coconut leaves as you can 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:25.010
 see or sink that is very similar to the 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:28.219
 cane to ensure even this unit 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:30.230
 carlos why make this mulch 

00:02:28.219 --> 00:02:35.450
 and that's what 's most important here 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:37.129
 this cover is made little because if 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.310
 not have such coverage 

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:43.400
 can not keep the worms because 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:45.500
 her as soon as you play for boxwood 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.040
 keep them always have to keep a 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:51.739
 temperature and this coverage 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:54.109
 including making the shadow because it 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:56.989
 do not have the probe what's going to happen 

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:58.730
 they will not go up they will if she 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:59.359
 It does not descend even living in it you will 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.129
 go down 

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:03.560
 you can see that this side 

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:05.209
 If it is to move and now I want to see my 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.159
 path and there are many earthworms 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:09.109
 better climate because they do not have 

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:12.049
 and who thinks that there are no famous 

00:03:09.109 --> 00:03:14.599
 villains in my dear is mistaken one 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:17.030
 common problem is leeches 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:19.280
 they are very similar to earthworms. 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:22.099
 difference is the reddish color and the 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:24.169
 slightly smaller size and control by 

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:27.199
 being manual is not so simple to be 

00:03:24.169 --> 00:03:30.409
 If they are resolved, they can end 

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:32.750
 he enters the earthworm he does not 

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:34.579
 How can you see that he does not eat it? 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:37.519
 kills her and she cuts herself like that later 

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:39.829
 a Stephano and is hard to find and is 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:41.599
 difficult to find because when you have 

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:43.189
 rather on the bed being a coffee and yes 

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:46.189
 I know about catalonia when people 

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:48.680
 accepts worm that happens you see the 

00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:50.299
 People think she sees us now if she is. 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.430
 able to now move it no longer 

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:53.180
 Can you find why it's cool, she's gone. 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.609
 on earth 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.629
 one of the advantages is that nothing here is 

00:03:55.609 --> 00:03:58.969
 wasted 

00:03:56.629 --> 00:04:01.129
 the formation of humus organic matter is 

00:03:58.969 --> 00:04:03.590
 composed by the earthworm serves as fertilizer 

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:06.049
 for all segments of the 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:08.299
 agriculture on the same property by 

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:11.569
 example it is used in this career of 

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:14.780
 grape and we produce it for the production 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:19.310
 grapes that benefits or the owner 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:22.690
 of the site here and the earthworm people 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:22.690
 A good income for us, right?
