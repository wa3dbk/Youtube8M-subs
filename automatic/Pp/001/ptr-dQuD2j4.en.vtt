times<00:04:30.410> of<00:04:30.680> landed<00:04:31.190> but<00:04:31.340> it<00:04:31.490> wasn't<00:04:32.270> that<00:04:32.450> as<00:04:32.810> a

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:33.110 
times of landed but it wasn't that as a

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:35.920 
times of landed but it wasn't that as a
fake<00:04:33.410> visit<00:04:33.800> I<00:04:34.040> thought<00:04:34.220> it<00:04:34.370> would<00:04:34.460> be<00:04:34.930> this

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:35.930 
fake visit I thought it would be this

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:37.270 
fake visit I thought it would be this
may<00:04:36.169> might<00:04:36.380> have<00:04:36.560> something<00:04:36.830> to<00:04:36.860> do<00:04:37.010> with<00:04:37.160> it

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:37.280 
may might have something to do with it

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.629 
may might have something to do with it
I'm<00:04:37.430> sure<00:04:37.460> and<00:04:38.020> they<00:04:39.020> use<00:04:39.260> in<00:04:39.440> jan<00:04:39.650> 12<00:04:39.919> and<00:04:40.370> i

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:40.639 
I'm sure and they use in jan 12 and i

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:41.800 
I'm sure and they use in jan 12 and i
thought<00:04:40.790> it<00:04:40.910> was<00:04:41.000> better<00:04:41.150> be<00:04:41.300> sitting<00:04:41.600> up<00:04:41.630> for

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:41.810 
thought it was better be sitting up for

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:43.600 
thought it was better be sitting up for
left<00:04:41.930> him<00:04:42.080> with<00:04:42.200> the<00:04:42.260> jab<00:04:42.290> overly<00:04:43.160> the<00:04:43.340> title

left him with the jab overly the title

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:48.580 
left him with the jab overly the title
of<00:04:43.639> the<00:04:43.760> double<00:04:44.030> jab<00:04:44.210> but<00:04:45.130> again<00:04:47.380> it<00:04:48.380> was<00:04:48.560> a

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:48.590 
of the double jab but again it was a

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:50.290 
of the double jab but again it was a
perfect<00:04:49.070> tonight<00:04:49.190> look<00:04:49.700> like<00:04:49.910> we<00:04:50.030> thought<00:04:50.180> it

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:50.300 
perfect tonight look like we thought it

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:51.880 
perfect tonight look like we thought it
was<00:04:50.419> going<00:04:50.539> to<00:04:50.600> be<00:04:50.750> but<00:04:50.960> the<00:04:51.169> thing<00:04:51.350> is<00:04:51.380> i<00:04:51.590> think

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:51.890 
was going to be but the thing is i think

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:53.260 
was going to be but the thing is i think
your<00:04:52.160> opponent<00:04:52.490> had<00:04:52.580> a<00:04:52.610> lot<00:04:52.789> to<00:04:52.880> do<00:04:53.030> with<00:04:53.060> that

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:53.270 
your opponent had a lot to do with that

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:54.909 
your opponent had a lot to do with that
because<00:04:53.479> he's<00:04:53.690> a<00:04:53.810> very<00:04:53.990> clever<00:04:54.140> fighter<00:04:54.500> and

00:04:54.909 --> 00:04:54.919 
because he's a very clever fighter and

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:57.820 
because he's a very clever fighter and
he<00:04:54.979> you<00:04:55.789> know<00:04:55.910> he<00:04:56.090> made<00:04:56.270> adjustments<00:04:56.390> and<00:04:57.050> then

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:57.830 
he you know he made adjustments and then

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:04.800 
he you know he made adjustments and then
we<00:04:58.010> add<00:04:58.240> yes<00:04:59.240> his<00:04:59.450> back
