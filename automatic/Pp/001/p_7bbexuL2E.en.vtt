00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
environmental studies and I really

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.099 
environmental studies and I really
wanted<00:00:19.830> to<00:00:19.890> study<00:00:20.189> development<00:00:20.510> but<00:00:21.510> I<00:00:21.750> felt

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
wanted to study development but I felt

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.080 
wanted to study development but I felt
that<00:00:22.230> I<00:00:22.560> should<00:00:22.590> have<00:00:23.310> an<00:00:23.490> environmental

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
that I should have an environmental

that I should have an environmental
background<00:00:24.420> as<00:00:24.750> well<00:00:24.990> in<00:00:25.230> my<00:00:25.380> course<00:00:25.650> and<00:00:25.830> this

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
background as well in my course and this

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.279 
background as well in my course and this
was<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:26.519> perfect<00:00:26.699> course<00:00:27.090> for<00:00:27.300> me<00:00:27.420> it<00:00:27.810> was<00:00:28.199> the

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
was the perfect course for me it was the

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.439 
was the perfect course for me it was the
best<00:00:28.470> of<00:00:28.590> both<00:00:28.769> worlds<00:00:28.970> so<00:00:29.970> one<00:00:30.150> of<00:00:30.179> the<00:00:30.300> great

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
things about UAA is the is the diversity

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.479 
things about UAA is the is the diversity

to explain them to us I decided to study

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:57.860

environment I think my favourite module

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.609 
environment I think my favourite module
was<00:01:18.299> understanding<00:01:18.930> global<00:01:19.229> environmental

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619
