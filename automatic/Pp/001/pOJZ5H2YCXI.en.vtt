00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:20.610
 and 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.120
 not 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:47.770
 hello to everyone who watches my videos and 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:51.220
 today for you a small test drive 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:54.580
 will be the car nissan sentra which 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:58.390
 my company rented me here at 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:01:01.660
 texas and car new so i'm 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:05.140
 decided to make such a small review 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:08.680
 in this car I don't know how they are 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:10.390
 popular in Ukraine and Russia and you 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:13.660
 watch my video but here in america 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:17.020
 these are nissan and they are sold pretty 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:19.630
 not bad because firstly what 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:23.320
 this is a japanese car secondly she 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.539
 economical and third price pretty 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:28.539
 not bad 

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:30.460
 This economy class cars at 

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:34.869
 least so it is considered here connected 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:39.300
 states he's pretty inexpensive i 

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:44.459
 I think it starts with 15 thousand dollars and 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:44.459
 complete set goes to 22 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:05.440
 I set up the driver's seat for my 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:07.390
 height 181 centimeters and we'll see 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.160
 how much space is left behind 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:12.280
 passengers I mean for legs and 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:15.880
 clearance over your head and with such 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:18.400
 setting up the seat that's how much remains 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:22.210
 I think the seats are pretty pretty 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:26.850
 not bad for economy class like this 

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:26.850
 looks like key nissan malls 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:43.110
 this grade with in or close asv and 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.799
 Additionally, you can order yourself 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:45.799
 navigator 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.660
 or 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:12.000
 the trunk opens with a key and you can 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:14.900
 do this by pressing this button and also 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.970
 there is another button inside 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:20.070
 the only drawback is that there is no 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:21.720
 no buttons on the trunk lid itself 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:26.400
 and also you can not open the trunk 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:28.500
 key and spare wheel 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.960
 why I decided to show that the spare 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:33.900
 the wheel now went such a trend in 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:37.890
 America to sell cars with tires 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:42.630
 glad ranflet and personally i had with them very 

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:46.400
 negative experience and and believe that nothing is 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:46.400
 will replace the normal normal for the board 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:06.330
 nissan sentra has 2 driving modes that 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:09.950
 economic and also sport mode 

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:09.950
 let's look under the hood 

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:24.550
 nissan sentra has a four cylinder 

00:05:20.319 --> 00:05:27.360
 engine volume of 1 and 8 liters and 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:31.180
 130 horsepower 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:36.960
 pretty good flow rate of 7 liters 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:36.960
 at 100 kilometers it is in mixed mode
