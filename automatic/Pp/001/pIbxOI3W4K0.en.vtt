seemed kind of compare and contrast the

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.320 
seemed kind of compare and contrast the
differences<00:01:43.070> between<00:01:43.220> the<00:01:43.490> hybrids<00:01:43.910> versus

differences between the hybrids versus
the<00:01:44.450> big<00:01:44.600> data<00:01:44.930> and<00:01:45.350> what<00:01:46.160> most<00:01:46.340> people<00:01:46.670> are

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:46.760 
the big data and what most people are

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.600 
the big data and what most people are
coming<00:01:47.000> away<00:01:47.210> with<00:01:47.240> is<00:01:47.630> the<00:01:48.260> hybrid<00:01:48.500> is<00:01:48.890> pretty

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:49.610 
coming away with is the hybrid is pretty

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.610 
coming away with is the hybrid is pretty
much<00:01:49.790> the<00:01:50.180> same<00:01:50.360> type<00:01:50.720> of<00:01:50.750> performance<00:01:51.050> as<00:01:51.590> the

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:51.620 
much the same type of performance as the

00:01:51.620 --> 00:02:04.560 
much the same type of performance as the
v8<00:01:52.070> is<00:01:52.280> but<00:01:52.880> a<00:01:52.910> lot<00:01:53.060> better<00:01:53.180> fuel<00:01:53.480> economy

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.420 

the<00:02:05.570> biggest<00:02:05.840> leak<00:02:06.530> is<00:02:06.740> that<00:02:06.920> you<00:02:07.280> have

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:07.430 
the biggest leak is that you have

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:09.880 
the biggest leak is that you have
customers<00:02:07.940> that<00:02:07.970> were<00:02:08.210> coming<00:02:08.509> out<00:02:08.630> of<00:02:08.660> 9<00:02:09.440> 97

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
customers that were coming out of 9 97

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.700 
customers that were coming out of 9 97
and<00:02:10.250> now<00:02:10.700> they're<00:02:10.940> getting<00:02:11.120> into<00:02:11.360> the<00:02:11.540> 991<00:02:12.080> 911

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:12.710 
and now they're getting into the 991 911

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:14.110 
and now they're getting into the 991 911
and<00:02:13.280> they're<00:02:13.400> seeing<00:02:13.610> what<00:02:13.820> a<00:02:13.850> huge

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
and they're seeing what a huge

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.360 
and they're seeing what a huge
difference<00:02:14.150> it<00:02:14.630> is<00:02:14.660> and<00:02:14.990> and<00:02:15.590> both<00:02:16.010> vehicles

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
difference it is and and both vehicles

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.760 
difference it is and and both vehicles
is<00:02:16.700> making<00:02:17.000> a<00:02:17.030> huge<00:02:17.240> leap<00:02:17.540> forward<00:02:17.570> as<00:02:18.380> far<00:02:18.620> as

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:18.770 
is making a huge leap forward as far as

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:21.190 
is making a huge leap forward as far as
technology<00:02:19.180> driveability<00:02:20.180> verga<00:02:20.570> nomics<00:02:20.959> and

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
technology driveability verga nomics and

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.660 
technology driveability verga nomics and
i<00:02:22.100> think<00:02:22.490> overall<00:02:22.820> has<00:02:23.060> been<00:02:23.209> a<00:02:23.240> great<00:02:23.480> success
