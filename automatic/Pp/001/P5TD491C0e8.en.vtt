another<00:00:00.420> killer<00:00:00.810> planes<00:00:01.230> video

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:08.410 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:10.900 

where's<00:00:09.410> the<00:00:09.530> real<00:00:09.679> airforce<00:00:10.130> were<00:00:10.340> like<00:00:10.519> that

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:10.910 
where's the real airforce were like that

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:13.360 
where's the real airforce were like that
no<00:00:11.240> put<00:00:11.570> a<00:00:11.630> bigger<00:00:11.900> motor<00:00:12.320> in<00:00:12.560> it<00:00:12.680> sir<00:00:13.190> the

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:13.370 
no put a bigger motor in it sir the

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:15.880 
no put a bigger motor in it sir the
fuselage<00:00:13.880> is<00:00:14.059> only<00:00:14.210> this<00:00:14.420> big<00:00:14.480> around<00:00:14.960> make<00:00:15.860> it

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:15.890 
fuselage is only this big around make it

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:20.200 
fuselage is only this big around make it
fatter

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:20.210 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.060 

hey<00:00:21.210> there<00:00:21.420> are<00:00:21.449> steam<00:00:21.840> daddies<00:00:22.080> from<00:00:22.529> planes

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
hey there are steam daddies from planes

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.679 
hey there are steam daddies from planes
down<00:00:23.250> to<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:23.460> airport<00:00:23.789> with<00:00:23.970> an<00:00:24.240> airplane

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
down to the airport with an airplane

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.990 
down to the airport with an airplane
hate<00:00:24.960> how<00:00:25.200> about<00:00:25.380> that<00:00:25.590> this<00:00:25.920> an<00:00:26.220> f-86<00:00:26.610> from

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
hate how about that this an f-86 from

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.390 
hate how about that this an f-86 from
free<00:00:27.180> wings<00:00:27.360> and<00:00:27.630> mini<00:00:27.779> like<00:00:28.140> 700<00:00:28.680> millimeters

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
free wings and mini like 700 millimeters

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.370 
free wings and mini like 700 millimeters
postcodes<00:00:29.849> a<00:00:30.000> milligram<00:00:30.240> so<00:00:30.869> as<00:00:31.080> you<00:00:31.200> can<00:00:31.320> see

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
postcodes a milligram so as you can see

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.890 
postcodes a milligram so as you can see
this<00:00:31.680> is<00:00:31.829> a<00:00:31.860> phat<00:00:32.309> plane<00:00:32.879> it's<00:00:33.360> a<00:00:33.510> little<00:00:33.780> bit

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:33.900 
this is a phat plane it's a little bit

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.930 
this is a phat plane it's a little bit
bigger<00:00:34.170> around<00:00:34.530> than<00:00:34.739> the<00:00:34.980> original<00:00:35.430> or<00:00:35.730> maybe

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
bigger around than the original or maybe

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.020 
bigger around than the original or maybe
it's<00:00:36.300> old<00:00:36.720> it<00:00:37.170> probably<00:00:37.530> just<00:00:38.220> got<00:00:38.430> fat<00:00:38.730> right

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
it's old it probably just got fat right

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.360 
it's old it probably just got fat right
now<00:00:39.059> they<00:00:39.570> put<00:00:39.720> a<00:00:39.780> big<00:00:39.989> motor<00:00:40.199> in<00:00:40.320> here<00:00:40.590> as<00:00:40.710> a<00:00:40.739> 64

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
now they put a big motor in here as a 64

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.790 
now they put a big motor in here as a 64
millimeter<00:00:41.850> fan<00:00:42.180> which<00:00:42.839> is<00:00:42.870> probably<00:00:43.470> enough

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
millimeter fan which is probably enough

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:44.720 
millimeter fan which is probably enough
to<00:00:43.920> give<00:00:44.040> it<00:00:44.129> some<00:00:44.280> good<00:00:44.400> thrust

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
to give it some good thrust

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.490 
to give it some good thrust
theoretically<00:00:45.300> this<00:00:45.600> is<00:00:45.660> a<00:00:45.750> fast<00:00:46.019> plane<00:00:46.290> I

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
theoretically this is a fast plane I

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.810 
theoretically this is a fast plane I
keep<00:00:46.710> saying<00:00:46.920> theoretically<00:00:47.339> because<00:00:47.519> I

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
keep saying theoretically because I

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.280 
keep saying theoretically because I
haven't<00:00:48.120> flown<00:00:48.300> it<00:00:48.420> yet<00:00:48.510> but<00:00:49.080> it's<00:00:49.170> supposed

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:49.290 
haven't flown it yet but it's supposed

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:51.320 
haven't flown it yet but it's supposed
to<00:00:49.410> be<00:00:49.470> fast<00:00:49.710> and<00:00:50.550> I'm<00:00:50.640> gonna<00:00:50.760> see<00:00:50.940> how<00:00:51.000> fast<00:00:51.210> it

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:51.330 
to be fast and I'm gonna see how fast it

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:52.310 
to be fast and I'm gonna see how fast it
is<00:00:51.449> it's<00:00:51.720> a<00:00:51.780> hand<00:00:51.960> launched

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
is it's a hand launched

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.959 
is it's a hand launched
I<00:00:52.469> love<00:00:52.739> hand<00:00:52.890> launch<00:00:53.070> plans<00:00:53.399> because<00:00:53.700> you

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
I love hand launch plans because you

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.160 
I love hand launch plans because you
don't<00:00:54.120> need<00:00:54.239> a<00:00:54.300> runway<00:00:54.600> just<00:00:54.840> go<00:00:55.020> down

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
don't need a runway just go down

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.690 
don't need a runway just go down
someplace<00:00:55.440> where<00:00:55.770> there's<00:00:55.950> a<00:00:56.010> field<00:00:56.219> throw

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:56.700 
someplace where there's a field throw

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:57.860 
someplace where there's a field throw
the<00:00:56.820> thing<00:00:56.910> up<00:00:57.059> in<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.239> air<00:00:57.270> and<00:00:57.510> landing<00:00:57.780> on

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
the thing up in the air and landing on

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.619 
the thing up in the air and landing on
the<00:00:57.960> grass<00:00:58.170> this<00:00:58.949> comes<00:00:59.190> with<00:00:59.280> plastic<00:01:00.270> covers

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
the grass this comes with plastic covers

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.660 
the grass this comes with plastic covers
on<00:01:00.899> these<00:01:01.079> babies<00:01:01.469> for<00:01:01.500> skids<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:02.250> also<00:01:02.489> one

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
on these babies for skids and also one

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:03.740 
on these babies for skids and also one
they<00:01:02.789> put<00:01:03.090> on<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.300> nose

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
they put on the nose

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.840 
they put on the nose
we<00:01:04.080> also<00:01:04.379> lined<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.920> inside<00:01:05.250> on<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.550> bottom

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
we also lined the inside on the bottom

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.820 
we also lined the inside on the bottom
with<00:01:06.000> plastic<00:01:06.450> and<00:01:06.630> put<00:01:07.050> some<00:01:07.259> more<00:01:07.350> rods<00:01:07.619> in

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
with plastic and put some more rods in

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:10.070 
with plastic and put some more rods in
here<00:01:08.039> because<00:01:08.190> this<00:01:08.670> is<00:01:08.940> a<00:01:09.000> perfect<00:01:09.570> example

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
here because this is a perfect example

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.690 
here because this is a perfect example
of<00:01:10.200> why<00:01:10.470> I<00:01:10.500> think<00:01:10.830> you<00:01:11.250> should<00:01:11.280> reinforce

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
of why I think you should reinforce

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:12.380 
of why I think you should reinforce
plans

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
plans

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.529 
plans
yes<00:01:13.320> it's<00:01:13.500> EPO<00:01:13.890> foam<00:01:14.250> but<00:01:14.820> it's<00:01:14.940> a<00:01:15.030> hollow<00:01:15.240> tool

00:01:15.529 --> 00:01:15.539 
yes it's EPO foam but it's a hollow tool

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:17.870 
yes it's EPO foam but it's a hollow tool
with<00:01:15.869> foam<00:01:16.140> this<00:01:16.530> thick<00:01:16.860> and<00:01:17.100> if<00:01:17.520> this<00:01:17.640> plane

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
with foam this thick and if this plane

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.910 
with foam this thick and if this plane
goes<00:01:17.910> fast<00:01:18.390> like<00:01:18.720> it's<00:01:18.899> supposed<00:01:19.320> to<00:01:19.530> let's

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
goes fast like it's supposed to let's

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.880 
goes fast like it's supposed to let's
say<00:01:20.100> 65<00:01:20.640> miles<00:01:20.970> an<00:01:21.090> hour<00:01:21.240> and<00:01:21.660> it<00:01:22.470> hits

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
say 65 miles an hour and it hits

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.090 
say 65 miles an hour and it hits
something<00:01:23.310> let's<00:01:24.060> say<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.840> ground<00:01:25.140> this<00:01:26.040> is

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
something let's say the ground this is

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.710 
something let's say the ground this is
just<00:01:26.369> gonna<00:01:26.490> vaporize<00:01:26.670> probably<00:01:27.360> from<00:01:27.509> here

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
just gonna vaporize probably from here

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.359 
just gonna vaporize probably from here
to<00:01:27.840> here<00:01:28.200> there<00:01:28.799> won't<00:01:28.920> be<00:01:29.040> anything<00:01:29.250> to

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
to here there won't be anything to

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.170 
to here there won't be anything to
repair<00:01:29.790> it'll<00:01:30.299> just<00:01:30.330> be<00:01:30.509> little<00:01:30.930> shreds<00:01:31.409> so

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 
repair it'll just be little shreds so

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.179 
repair it'll just be little shreds so
this<00:01:33.180> is<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.720> reason<00:01:34.080> that<00:01:34.290> you<00:01:34.650> should<00:01:34.890> put

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
this is the reason that you should put

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.730 
this is the reason that you should put
carbon<00:01:35.610> fiber<00:01:35.880> rods<00:01:36.150> into<00:01:36.869> your<00:01:37.049> foam<00:01:37.320> planes

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
carbon fiber rods into your foam planes

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.520 
carbon fiber rods into your foam planes
which<00:01:38.369> we<00:01:38.579> did<00:01:38.790> here<00:01:39.150> so<00:01:39.299> we<00:01:40.020> put<00:01:40.170> them<00:01:40.290> out<00:01:40.350> to

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
which we did here so we put them out to

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.350 
which we did here so we put them out to
the<00:01:40.619> tips<00:01:40.860> we<00:01:41.159> put<00:01:41.369> them<00:01:41.460> to<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.700> nose<00:01:41.909> to<00:01:42.240> the

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
the tips we put them to the nose to the

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.300 
the tips we put them to the nose to the
tail<00:01:42.570> we<00:01:42.900> put<00:01:42.930> logs<00:01:43.259> everywhere<00:01:43.590> why<00:01:43.920> because

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
tail we put logs everywhere why because

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.120 
tail we put logs everywhere why because
planes<00:01:44.549> break<00:01:44.909> everywhere<00:01:45.390> don't<00:01:45.600> they<00:01:45.810> so

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
planes break everywhere don't they so

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.200 
planes break everywhere don't they so
let's<00:01:47.130> see<00:01:47.250> how<00:01:47.310> this<00:01:47.430> baby<00:01:47.640> flies<00:01:48.000> around

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
let's see how this baby flies around

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.359 
let's see how this baby flies around
with<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.810> I<00:01:49.200> guess<00:01:49.710> you<00:01:49.860> would<00:01:50.100> call<00:01:50.130> the

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
with the I guess you would call the

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.149 
with the I guess you would call the
Supermax<00:01:50.790> kit<00:01:51.060> installed<00:01:51.450> in<00:01:51.600> here<00:01:51.810> and<00:01:52.159> you

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
Supermax kit installed in here and you

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.469 
Supermax kit installed in here and you
can<00:01:53.280> pick<00:01:53.430> one<00:01:53.549> up<00:01:53.579> the<00:01:53.729> killer<00:01:53.939> planes<00:01:54.210> for

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
can pick one up the killer planes for

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.690 
can pick one up the killer planes for
yourself<00:01:54.840> after<00:01:55.799> you've<00:01:55.920> seen<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:56.399> amazing

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
yourself after you've seen the amazing

yourself after you've seen the amazing
performance

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.420 

it<00:02:13.260> is<00:02:13.500> kind<00:02:13.830> of<00:02:13.920> breezy

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
it is kind of breezy

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:21.680 
it is kind of breezy
yeah<00:02:14.580> I<00:02:14.610> saw<00:02:14.910> her<00:02:15.030> wavering<00:02:15.420> there<00:02:20.420> this<00:02:21.420> would

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
yeah I saw her wavering there this would

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.050 
yeah I saw her wavering there this would
want<00:02:21.930> to<00:02:22.049> use<00:02:22.230> a<00:02:22.260> higher<00:02:22.620> C<00:02:23.190> rating<00:02:23.670> battery

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
want to use a higher C rating battery

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.369 
want to use a higher C rating battery
this<00:02:24.720> is<00:02:24.780> a<00:02:24.959> 25<00:02:25.680> and<00:02:26.160> I<00:02:26.970> have<00:02:27.120> a<00:02:27.150> feeling<00:02:27.629> that<00:02:27.840> a

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:28.379 
this is a 25 and I have a feeling that a

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:30.440 
this is a 25 and I have a feeling that a
higher<00:02:28.860> key<00:02:29.220> rating<00:02:29.549> battery<00:02:29.910> this<00:02:30.150> advice

hands off by the way when I when I got

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.130 
hands off by the way when I when I got
it<00:02:32.549> down<00:02:32.670> flat<00:02:33.000> let's<00:02:33.180> do<00:02:33.360> it<00:02:33.480> this<00:02:33.629> away<00:02:33.870> he

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
it down flat let's do it this away he

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.830 
it down flat let's do it this away he
gets<00:02:34.260> small<00:02:34.680> real<00:02:35.010> fast<00:02:35.310> flat<00:02:36.269> hands<00:02:36.720> off

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
gets small real fast flat hands off

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:43.670 
gets small real fast flat hands off
hands<00:02:37.290> off<00:02:37.470> playing<00:02:42.049> put<00:02:43.049> your<00:02:43.170> hands<00:02:43.319> back<00:02:43.470> on

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
hands off playing put your hands back on

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.430 
hands off playing put your hands back on
for<00:02:43.890> a<00:02:43.920> second<00:02:44.280> all<00:02:44.790> right<00:02:44.849> let's<00:02:45.269> do<00:02:45.480> a<00:02:45.780> melon

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
for a second all right let's do a melon

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.680 
for a second all right let's do a melon
and<00:02:46.650> fuel<00:02:46.890> kind<00:02:47.190> of<00:02:47.280> face<00:02:47.519> it<00:02:47.700> big<00:02:47.879> see<00:02:48.510> that's

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
and fuel kind of face it big see that's

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:55.699 
and fuel kind of face it big see that's
not<00:02:48.840> a<00:02:48.900> tiny<00:02:49.230> little<00:02:54.019> okay<00:02:55.019> it's<00:02:55.230> got<00:02:55.440> some

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
not a tiny little okay it's got some

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:12.850 
not a tiny little okay it's got some
nice<00:02:55.980> lime<00:02:56.989> let's<00:02:57.989> see<00:02:58.200> how<00:02:58.319> the<00:02:58.379> divers<00:03:04.970> right

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.250 

so<00:03:13.860> he's<00:03:14.280> around<00:03:14.670> rather<00:03:15.030> nicely<00:03:15.390> and<00:03:15.930> I<00:03:16.020> think

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
so he's around rather nicely and I think

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.470 
so he's around rather nicely and I think
probably<00:03:16.530> you<00:03:16.860> get<00:03:17.280> like<00:03:17.520> a<00:03:17.550> four<00:03:18.000> or<00:03:18.030> five

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
probably you get like a four or five

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.680 
probably you get like a four or five
minutes<00:03:18.810> flight<00:03:19.020> out<00:03:19.170> of<00:03:19.200> an<00:03:19.350> 1800s<00:03:20.570> but<00:03:21.570> make

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
minutes flight out of an 1800s but make

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.510 
minutes flight out of an 1800s but make
sure<00:03:21.810> you<00:03:21.900> bring<00:03:22.020> a<00:03:22.110> couple<00:03:22.290> batteries<00:03:22.620> for

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:23.520 
sure you bring a couple batteries for

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:26.750 
sure you bring a couple batteries for
maximum<00:03:23.970> funds<00:03:24.470> for<00:03:25.470> the<00:03:25.650> price<00:03:25.890> this<00:03:26.490> baby

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
maximum funds for the price this baby

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.910 
maximum funds for the price this baby
performs<00:03:27.360> rather<00:03:27.630> well<00:03:27.990> as<00:03:28.260> its<00:03:28.440> jet<00:03:28.650> doesn't

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
performs rather well as its jet doesn't

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:35.590 
performs rather well as its jet doesn't
it<00:03:32.120> all<00:03:33.120> right<00:03:33.270> let's<00:03:33.450> try<00:03:33.660> some<00:03:33.900> mmm

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:35.600 
it all right let's try some mmm

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.510 
it all right let's try some mmm
so<00:03:36.600> this<00:03:36.840> you<00:03:37.050> know<00:03:37.170> what<00:03:37.380> this<00:03:37.680> has<00:03:37.890> a<00:03:37.950> big

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:38.520 
so this you know what this has a big

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:42.260 
so this you know what this has a big
loop<00:03:39.440> so<00:03:40.440> you<00:03:40.740> wouldn't<00:03:41.160> want<00:03:41.340> to<00:03:41.400> try<00:03:41.580> a<00:03:41.670> split

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:42.270 
loop so you wouldn't want to try a split

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:44.000 
loop so you wouldn't want to try a split
s<00:03:42.450> too<00:03:42.750> close<00:03:42.990> to<00:03:43.200> the<00:03:43.290> ground<00:03:43.470> in<00:03:43.740> one<00:03:43.920> of

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
s too close to the ground in one of

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:48.680 
s too close to the ground in one of
these<00:03:44.070> babies<00:03:44.370> the<00:03:45.090> funny<00:03:45.330> thing<00:03:45.600> is<00:03:46.370> I<00:03:47.690> heard

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
these babies the funny thing is I heard

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.670 
these babies the funny thing is I heard
about<00:03:48.840> that<00:03:50.810> now<00:03:51.810> let's<00:03:52.050> try<00:03:52.230> it<00:03:52.290> at<00:03:52.470> some

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
about that now let's try it at some

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.120 
about that now let's try it at some
lower<00:03:52.980> throttle<00:03:54.080> okay<00:03:55.080> so<00:03:55.440> you<00:03:55.920> heard<00:03:55.980> about

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
lower throttle okay so you heard about

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:03.260 
lower throttle okay so you heard about
what<00:03:57.080> the<00:03:59.690> babies<00:04:00.690> had<00:04:00.900> a<00:04:01.459> large<00:04:02.459> loop<00:04:03.030> and

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:03.270 
what the babies had a large loop and

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:05.949 
what the babies had a large loop and
trying<00:04:03.810> to<00:04:03.870> do<00:04:04.020> a<00:04:04.050> split<00:04:04.440> s<00:04:04.620> the<00:04:05.130> real<00:04:05.310> planes

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:05.959 
trying to do a split s the real planes

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:08.390 
trying to do a split s the real planes
you<00:04:06.959> didn't<00:04:07.230> want<00:04:07.380> to<00:04:07.470> try<00:04:07.620> to<00:04:07.680> do<00:04:07.860> a<00:04:07.890> split<00:04:08.250> s

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
you didn't want to try to do a split s

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.520 
you didn't want to try to do a split s
for<00:04:08.670> many<00:04:08.850> I<00:04:08.940> think<00:04:09.180> the<00:04:09.510> minimum<00:04:09.870> height

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:10.530 
for many I think the minimum height

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:17.920 
for many I think the minimum height
requirement<00:04:10.590> was<00:04:11.489> like<00:04:11.670> 7,000<00:04:12.540> feet

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:17.930 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:21.050 

I'd<00:04:18.930> say<00:04:19.230> that<00:04:19.410> those<00:04:19.530> skids<00:04:19.889> worked<00:04:20.220> well

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
I'd say that those skids worked well

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.810 
I'd say that those skids worked well
enough<00:04:21.090> in<00:04:21.660> grass<00:04:22.019> that's<00:04:22.290> all<00:04:22.530> I<00:04:22.860> was

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
enough in grass that's all I was

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.310 
enough in grass that's all I was
expecting<00:04:24.389> it<00:04:24.480> to<00:04:24.510> be<00:04:24.630> a<00:04:24.750> little<00:04:24.990> thought<00:04:25.169> up

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
expecting it to be a little thought up

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:26.420 
expecting it to be a little thought up
you<00:04:25.470> know<00:04:25.560> what<00:04:25.680> I<00:04:25.710> should<00:04:25.889> have<00:04:25.919> done<00:04:26.070> take

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
you know what I should have done take

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:27.860 
you know what I should have done take
the<00:04:26.580> front<00:04:26.790> edge<00:04:26.910> of<00:04:27.060> these<00:04:27.180> wings<00:04:27.419> because

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:27.870 
the front edge of these wings because

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:30.530 
the front edge of these wings because
even<00:04:28.740> these<00:04:28.889> skids<00:04:29.310> grass<00:04:29.940> is<00:04:30.150> usually<00:04:30.510> a

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:30.540 
even these skids grass is usually a

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:32.960
