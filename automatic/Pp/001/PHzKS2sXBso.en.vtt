00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 Hello de amor with you and my rubric 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:17.550
 5 facts about the hero in dota today I will 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:20.010
 broadcast to you agar or so the fact is the first 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.560
 the model of this hero essentially suffered 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.539
 change start with the fact that in the past 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.359
 namely in the first dota this hero was 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.550
 bull and walking on his own backsliding 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.730
 that i'm on the shoulder and holding it 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.079
 change with one hand from here 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.690
 attack animations 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.390
 if the first dota shaker attacked the totem 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.910
 then in the second he mercilessly beats his 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.829
 opponents need to turn 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.480
 attention that they are for this him 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.239
 specially but feather van and 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.460
 and he hangs them attached on his back like 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:54.020
 backpack and used only by pro 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.020
 shakira's skill compression 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:00.600
 fact 2 of this character makes no sense 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:03.150
 use to pinch the pub but when 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.280
 this serious games he can have 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:10.220
 significant impact on the result 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.220
 acting as initiator or design blya 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:16.880
 fact 3 the more opponents will be 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:19.789
 against us the faster they will go to 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.679
 the fountain is very very effective in conjunction with 

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:25.130
 heroes like enigma 

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:29.090
 dark sir magnus who will contribute 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:41.539
 an enemy and we'll arrange in 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:44.420
 turn the bloodbath fact 4 shaker 

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:46.250
 Perhaps the best po died in dota recall 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.619
 old world may be me heroes 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.689
 which in the early stages of the game can 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:53.810
 instead of pumping on line actively 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:55.729
 navigate the map suddenly appearing 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.159
 on different lines to kill 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:00.110
 enemy heroes 

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:04.189
 examples of such heroes can be tight 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:07.489
 Bane smk venga and others 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:10.429
 but the shaker will be more efficient as 

00:02:07.489 --> 00:02:12.920
 fissure he could not only become 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:15.440
 give good damage to the victims but 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.720
 make them off guard blocking them 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.870
 movements thus overlap 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.670
 oxygen for a full eight seconds from here and 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:28.030
 it follows that the mind should be in fissure 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:28.030
 vbs mates can be easily made 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.680
 and finally the fact of the fifth binding 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:37.770
 the artifacts for the shaker are the arcana 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:40.710
 blink and aganim these items are collected in 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:44.790
 every game for the shaker they are not effective 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:47.070
 so to the hero as a team and so to all 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.170
