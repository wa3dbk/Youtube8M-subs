a landscape version as far as we can
tell<00:01:59.250> there<00:02:00.030> but<00:02:00.240> not<00:02:00.390> that<00:02:00.540> you'd<00:02:00.780> you'd<00:02:00.990> want

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
tell there but not that you'd you'd want

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.440 
tell there but not that you'd you'd want
to<00:02:01.259> use<00:02:01.500> it<00:02:01.619> like<00:02:01.710> that<00:02:01.890> anyway<00:02:02.310> but<00:02:03.149> that's

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
to use it like that anyway but that's

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.560 
to use it like that anyway but that's
just<00:02:03.600> worth<00:02:04.170> pointing<00:02:04.590> out<00:02:05.210> but<00:02:06.210> yeah<00:02:06.299> this<00:02:06.450> is

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
just worth pointing out but yeah this is

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.749 
just worth pointing out but yeah this is
otherwise<00:02:06.899> just<00:02:07.290> them<00:02:07.590> pretty<00:02:08.580> much<00:02:08.640> a

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
otherwise just them pretty much a

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.760 
otherwise just them pretty much a
smaller<00:02:09.390> version<00:02:09.539> of<00:02:09.720> the<00:02:09.780> streak<00:02:10.080> this<00:02:10.679> is

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
smaller version of the streak this is

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.470 
smaller version of the streak this is
that<00:02:10.860> by<00:02:10.950> the<00:02:10.979> way<00:02:11.160> a<00:02:11.190> four<00:02:11.430> point<00:02:11.640> one<00:02:11.670> inch

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
that by the way a four point one inch

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.410 
that by the way a four point one inch
Oh<00:02:12.540> degree<00:02:13.379> which<00:02:14.220> is<00:02:14.250> a<00:02:14.430> lot<00:02:14.879> more<00:02:15.000> vibrant

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
Oh degree which is a lot more vibrant

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.470 
Oh degree which is a lot more vibrant
and<00:02:16.019> you<00:02:16.650> can<00:02:16.769> see<00:02:16.980> it's<00:02:17.549> obviously<00:02:18.000> a<00:02:18.090> lot<00:02:18.269> a

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
and you can see it's obviously a lot a

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.009 
and you can see it's obviously a lot a
lot<00:02:18.720> smaller<00:02:18.989> than<00:02:19.260> the<00:02:19.409> dell<00:02:19.590> streak<00:02:19.830> here<00:02:21.019> so

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:22.019 
lot smaller than the dell streak here so

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:25.370 
lot smaller than the dell streak here so
that's<00:02:22.650> pretty<00:02:23.099> much<00:02:23.190> it
