00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
time you can freeze event you can look

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.700 
time you can freeze event you can look
at<00:01:06.060> what's<00:01:06.270> happened<00:01:06.600> you<00:01:06.900> can<00:01:07.380> go<00:01:07.530> a<00:01:07.560> little

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
at what's happened you can go a little

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.560 
at what's happened you can go a little
bit<00:01:07.950> back<00:01:08.130> yet<00:01:08.369> look<00:01:08.820> what<00:01:09.030> was<00:01:09.210> happening

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
bit back yet look what was happening

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.200 
bit back yet look what was happening
there<00:01:09.750> who<00:01:10.320> fought<00:01:10.650> again<00:01:11.070> what<00:01:11.820> you<00:01:11.939> can<00:01:12.090> also

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
there who fought again what you can also

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.780 
there who fought again what you can also
do<00:01:12.540> is<00:01:12.689> you<00:01:12.840> can<00:01:12.990> actually<00:01:13.140> look<00:01:13.530> at<00:01:13.860> parts

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
do is you can actually look at parts

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.850 
do is you can actually look at parts
that<00:01:15.270> will<00:01:15.479> never<00:01:15.689> be<00:01:15.900> able<00:01:16.049> to<00:01:16.320> see<00:01:16.530> you<00:01:16.680> can

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
that will never be able to see you can

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.980 
that will never be able to see you can
look<00:01:17.040> from<00:01:17.220> underneath<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.970> vehicle<00:01:18.150> or<00:01:18.840> you

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
look from underneath the vehicle or you

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.960 
look from underneath the vehicle or you
can<00:01:19.140> take<00:01:19.320> certain<00:01:19.740> components<00:01:20.310> away<00:01:20.400> and<00:01:20.729> see

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
can take certain components away and see

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.609 
can take certain components away and see
any<00:01:21.119> model<00:01:21.479> and<00:01:21.600> look<00:01:22.020> what's<00:01:22.259> happening

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
any model and look what's happening

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.399 
any model and look what's happening
behind<00:01:22.909> you're<00:01:23.909> really<00:01:24.210> using<00:01:24.390> Russia<00:01:24.960> crash

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
behind you're really using Russia crash

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.859 
behind you're really using Russia crash
testing<00:01:25.890> is<00:01:26.310> extremely<00:01:26.939> powerful<00:01:27.150> and<00:01:27.659> has

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
testing is extremely powerful and has

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.200 
testing is extremely powerful and has
allowed<00:01:28.140> us<00:01:28.200> to<00:01:28.530> deliver<00:01:29.100> all<00:01:29.520> targets<00:01:30.000> for

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
allowed us to deliver all targets for

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.499 
allowed us to deliver all targets for
vehicle<00:01:30.720> safety<00:01:32.030> and<00:01:33.030> when<00:01:33.210> we<00:01:33.270> talk<00:01:33.479> about

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
vehicle safety and when we talk about

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.899 
vehicle safety and when we talk about
safety<00:01:34.049> there<00:01:34.680> are<00:01:34.799> two<00:01:34.890> aspects<00:01:35.340> there's

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
safety there are two aspects there's

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.440 
safety there are two aspects there's
active<00:01:36.329> safety<00:01:36.570> and<00:01:36.990> there's<00:01:37.470> passive<00:01:37.920> safe

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
active safety and there's passive safe

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.779 
active safety and there's passive safe
so<00:01:39.110> the<00:01:39.229> active<00:01:39.590> safety<00:01:39.799> systems<00:01:40.399> are<00:01:40.579> all

00:01:40.779 --> 00:01:40.789 
so the active safety systems are all

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:43.060 
so the active safety systems are all
things<00:01:41.180> that<00:01:41.299> help<00:01:41.689> avoid<00:01:42.200> an<00:01:42.380> accident<00:01:42.500> in

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 
things that help avoid an accident in

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.789 
things that help avoid an accident in
the<00:01:43.159> first<00:01:43.399> place<00:01:44.140> we've<00:01:45.140> developed<00:01:45.439> a<00:01:45.649> very

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:45.799 
the first place we've developed a very

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:48.639 
the first place we've developed a very

finally<00:03:05.560> we've<00:03:05.709> got<00:03:05.890> a<00:03:05.920> reverse<00:03:06.280> sensing

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
finally we've got a reverse sensing

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.449 
finally we've got a reverse sensing
camera<00:03:06.880> on<00:03:07.420> the<00:03:07.510> 3.2<00:03:08.080> litre<00:03:08.349> wire<00:03:08.530> tray<00:03:08.830> which

camera on the 3.2 litre wire tray which

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:11.070 
camera on the 3.2 litre wire tray which
again<00:03:09.760> allows<00:03:09.940> you<00:03:10.330> to<00:03:10.450> negotiate<00:03:10.930> the

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080 
again allows you to negotiate the

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
vehicle and really see what's happening

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.970 
vehicle and really see what's happening
directly<00:03:13.510> behind<00:03:13.690> the<00:03:13.959> vehicle<00:03:14.170> you<00:03:14.800> should

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
directly behind the vehicle you should

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:16.650 
directly behind the vehicle you should
try<00:03:15.130> it<00:03:15.220> out<00:03:15.400> later<00:03:15.700> when<00:03:15.940> you<00:03:16.030> see<00:03:16.180> the<00:03:16.300> Lakers

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
try it out later when you see the Lakers

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.660 
try it out later when you see the Lakers
when<00:03:16.810> you're<00:03:16.930> outside<00:03:17.080> and<00:03:17.590> it's<00:03:18.280> extremely

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
when you're outside and it's extremely

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.580 
when you're outside and it's extremely
cool<00:03:18.970> the<00:03:19.360> pictures<00:03:19.750> in<00:03:19.930> the<00:03:20.019> rearview<00:03:20.200> mirror

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
cool the pictures in the rearview mirror

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.370 
cool the pictures in the rearview mirror
so<00:03:20.860> you<00:03:21.010> have<00:03:21.220> the<00:03:21.370> real<00:03:21.519> picture<00:03:22.060> and<00:03:22.540> Lee<00:03:23.170> the

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
so you have the real picture and Lee the

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.940 
so you have the real picture and Lee the
camera<00:03:23.739> picture<00:03:24.100> in<00:03:24.400> one<00:03:24.730> location<00:03:25.799> so<00:03:26.799> that's

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
camera picture in one location so that's

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:28.530 
camera picture in one location so that's
the<00:03:27.100> active<00:03:27.400> safety<00:03:27.610> part<00:03:28.030> of<00:03:28.120> it<00:03:28.269> on<00:03:28.420> the

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:45.500 
accident happening are very very fast

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:49.300 
accident happening are very very fast
twice<00:04:46.040> as<00:04:46.280> fast<00:04:46.490> as<00:04:46.850> normal<00:04:47.060> sensors<00:04:47.630> and<00:04:48.310> all

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:49.310 
twice as fast as normal sensors and all

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:51.940 
twice as fast as normal sensors and all
these<00:04:49.550> centers<00:04:50.030> here<00:04:50.360> basically<00:04:51.050> deliver<00:04:51.740> the

these centers here basically deliver the

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:54.280 
these centers here basically deliver the

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:31.250 
finally we have no limiting seat belts

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:33.640 
finally we have no limiting seat belts
with<00:05:31.430> pre-tensioners<00:05:31.840> so<00:05:32.840> when<00:05:33.380> an<00:05:33.500> accident

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:33.650 
with pre-tensioners so when an accident

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:36.940 
with pre-tensioners so when an accident
happens<00:05:34.100> then<00:05:34.970> this<00:05:35.270> girl<00:05:35.630> gets<00:05:35.900> tightened<00:05:36.260> so

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:36.950 
happens then this girl gets tightened so

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:38.830 
happens then this girl gets tightened so
that<00:05:36.979> there's<00:05:37.310> no<00:05:37.370> slack<00:05:37.820> when<00:05:38.090> the<00:05:38.210> driver<00:05:38.660> or
