00:06:27.319 --> 00:06:32.240
 Good crowd and the last one is that I go 

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:34.879
 show you is the application of 

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:37.039
 twitter is the twitter application you 

00:06:34.879 --> 00:06:39.289
 ask but the corner of twitter give 

00:06:37.039 --> 00:06:40.580
 more sure does not have much different 

00:06:39.289 --> 00:06:43.099
 from twitter 

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:44.779
 but it is easy to navigate in the 

00:06:43.099 --> 00:06:46.340
 twitter is a social network leaves you 

00:06:44.779 --> 00:06:48.650
 navigate more fluidly 

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:51.139

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:58.879
 This application has nothing much to it. 

00:06:56.750 --> 00:07:00.650
 new interface with a little more beautiful 

00:06:58.879 --> 00:07:02.210
 but you can navigate to a 

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:04.939
 speed pulled down you 

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:07.250
 can load your results from the 

00:07:04.939 --> 00:07:09.319
 updates there, not the last tweets there

 there you can put it is our goal 

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:20.839
 is to seek a dish its other mentions nor 

00:07:19.249 --> 00:07:22.669
