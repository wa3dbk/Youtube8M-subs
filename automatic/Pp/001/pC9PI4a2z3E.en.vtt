00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.220
 than what we showed here 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.930
 but maybe he's also concentrating on another distance 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:09.720
 Now at the bottom of the track 8 she or the German champion over the 50 and 

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.159
 the one hundred butterfly 

00:00:11.159 --> 00:00:16.439
 the hundred she has also won in 2010 59 goals 0 1 her time of 

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:19.329
 the German championships or who of course it is not bad if even 

00:00:19.329 --> 00:00:21.550
 a little bit what Kafka could do 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.029
 Hamas does not even need nine students 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:27.609
 to have them next to each other 

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:29.189
 a pretty fast one 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.089
 the swimmers report the first 50 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:36.920
 Manderson Mohr South Africa 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.330
 fair and on the basis of defending champion Sarah Sjöström 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:43.490
 who has also become European champion on the long-distance track 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.900
 the Swedes therefore the winner of Rome two years ago admits percent 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.890
 that's amazing that you're still a little bit behind Mr. Sarah 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:53.880
 Sjöström 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.800
 has also held back very much after the last World Championships 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.080
 international 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.080
 and that does not look so bad 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:04.970
 Here she is third behind Jan Marlow the Briton 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.220
 and that Jessica Schipper the Fietse World Champion of Rome as well with 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.290
 Swimming would be that was also clear 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.250
 Jamal asks Jessica Schipper vice-world champion and Sarah 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:21.440
 most beautiful than third Sina Sutter in 58 96, although slower than it was 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.930
 but the run were so fast the 59 of the brand cracked 510 faster 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:27.780
 exactly as at the German Championships 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.250
 but still 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.720
 she is now percent at the same time 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.210
 sixth so it is 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.680
 all faster than Svindal 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.530
 and while walking ahead and the empty the zoo 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.620
 were 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:46.360
 that's right but the routine has cracked her so who's day so currently 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:47.350
 six 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:53.350
 and fun Bommer still two runners or Walker still noticed Stres it is 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.000
 but also goes well 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.640
 I'm happy about the clear yes actually 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.530
 maybe even something else again we want to be seventeenth at the same time 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.330
 As reported at Werder really more timely 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.450
 but there must be a retreat somewhere before the top-16 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:09.889
 and therefore 

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:12.889
 it is still spoken 

00:02:14.749 --> 00:02:17.749
 or it may be that they play only for this reserve place 

00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:22.499
 and since the order will be set when you imagine Meinersen Reserve 

00:02:22.499 --> 00:02:25.729
 never pronounced percent "then someone has to stretch 

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:28.729
 previous months 

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:32.769
 have signed off for this semi-final, for example with the Gerlinger 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:33.679
 substances 

00:02:33.679 --> 00:02:37.019
 you do not know it could not run for events be protocol then 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:38.309
 let's see 

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:41.079
 who then waived 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:44.849
 but there has not been a nice story bone has made this route 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:47.889
 to feel the citizens two seconds 

00:02:47.889 --> 00:02:50.129
 Norbert seconds behind the top 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:51.859
 Hannover 9 

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:54.849
 about the Oderstädter spelled is the victory is said I want gold 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:57.839
 with the squadron or full concentration village 

00:02:57.839 --> 00:03:01.479
 that may well be that as well as the leadership of the polemical 

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:04.429
 warned that said 

00:03:04.429 --> 00:03:06.330
 concentrate on this honor day 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:07.979
 the lower of the two 

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:11.249
 By the way, in the morning, the other is already called South Africa 

00:03:12.389 --> 00:03:15.189
 58 96 are the two 

00:03:15.189 --> 00:03:19.819
 See also Boyles Roman province here they are very close to each other 700 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:21.639
 Sailor Wolber of the world becomes 

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:26.439
 good was that Amor Watzke significantly longer and better is also phase 

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:28.559
 but that does not mean that his 

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:31.839
 yours before the enemy 

00:03:31.839 --> 00:03:35.229
 actually come out quite well but before that expose the fingers so 

00:03:36.089 --> 00:03:37.699
 the South African 

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:40.639
 who shot himself 

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:43.879
 then she would have to fly a little bit again now that lasts 

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:45.649
 Do not take South African 

00:03:45.649 --> 00:03:47.280
 this also much faster 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.749
 moves to the semi-final 8 50 6 6 3 

00:03:50.749 --> 00:03:51.849
 Zetes faster 

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:55.229
 what percent in the lead 

00:03:55.229 --> 00:04:00.209
 and Sina Sutter's dress was a little disappointing at 59 point 47 

00:04:03.249 --> 00:04:06.510
 I think that for them all times very peptide important experience 

00:04:08.399 --> 00:04:11.819
 I have to talk about the weather and then often have to go back to him 

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:17.569
 so 

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:20.889
 meanwhile, they are ready for the final 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:24.310
 there is often a lot of timing as well Sixt is one of them so now accordingly 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:28.180
 in seventh place in the overall standings storm still sometime a cancellation so 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:29.939
 time is still there 

00:04:29.939 --> 00:04:32.189
 both are still in it, he does not know about life
