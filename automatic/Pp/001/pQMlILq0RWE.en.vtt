00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:25.490 

and<00:00:21.330> new<00:00:22.050> for<00:00:22.939> 2014<00:00:23.939> I<00:00:24.210> can't<00:00:24.480> believe<00:00:24.720> it<00:00:24.840> the

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
and new for 2014 I can't believe it the

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.279 
and new for 2014 I can't believe it the
FET<00:00:25.710> driver<00:00:26.009> the<00:00:26.759> same<00:00:27.029> sort<00:00:27.360> of<00:00:27.419> thing<00:00:27.630> what

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
FET driver the same sort of thing what

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.310 
FET driver the same sort of thing what
we<00:00:28.380> want<00:00:28.590> to<00:00:28.740> do<00:00:28.860> is<00:00:29.039> create<00:00:29.400> a<00:00:29.970> a<00:00:30.090> tube<00:00:30.869> sort<00:00:31.230> of

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
we want to do is create a a tube sort of

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.380 
we want to do is create a a tube sort of
sound<00:00:31.529> environment<00:00:32.220> that's<00:00:32.400> the<00:00:32.550> saturation

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
sound environment that's the saturation

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.990 
sound environment that's the saturation
the<00:00:33.720> all<00:00:34.199> the<00:00:34.559> secondary<00:00:35.070> harmonics<00:00:35.879> that

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
the all the secondary harmonics that

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.520 
the all the secondary harmonics that
come<00:00:36.660> enriched<00:00:37.050> with<00:00:37.620> tube<00:00:38.070> driving<00:00:38.610> but<00:00:39.530> the

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
come enriched with tube driving but the

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.060 
come enriched with tube driving but the
small<00:00:41.010> footprint<00:00:41.550> and<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:42.890> the<00:00:43.890> less

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
small footprint and the the less

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.430 
small footprint and the the less
overhead<00:00:44.400> of<00:00:44.699> tube<00:00:44.970> circuit<00:00:45.449> we<00:00:45.930> came<00:00:46.140> up<00:00:46.290> with

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
overhead of tube circuit we came up with

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.130 
overhead of tube circuit we came up with
the<00:00:46.530> FET<00:00:46.710> driver<00:00:47.010> and<00:00:47.610> just<00:00:48.329> like<00:00:48.690> its<00:00:48.870> name

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
the FET driver and just like its name

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.350 
the FET driver and just like its name
it's<00:00:49.500> a<00:00:49.680> it's<00:00:50.129> a<00:00:50.250> drive<00:00:50.550> it's<00:00:50.790> an<00:00:50.879> overdrive

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
it's a it's a drive it's an overdrive

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.990 
it's a it's a drive it's an overdrive
sort<00:00:51.660> of<00:00:51.750> pedal<00:00:52.020> that<00:00:52.469> you<00:00:53.399> have<00:00:53.520> just<00:00:53.730> very

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
sort of pedal that you have just very

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.319 
sort of pedal that you have just very
simple<00:00:54.390> features<00:00:54.750> based<00:00:55.079> in<00:00:55.260> trouble<00:00:55.620> control

00:00:56.319 --> 00:00:56.329 
simple features based in trouble control

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:59.630 
simple features based in trouble control
level<00:00:57.329> and<00:00:57.629> volume<00:00:58.500> and<00:00:58.680> then<00:00:59.039> a<00:00:59.070> high<00:00:59.340> cup

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
level and volume and then a high cup

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.840 
level and volume and then a high cup
which<00:01:00.300> basically<00:01:01.079> warms<00:01:01.920> things<00:01:02.010> up<00:01:02.430> or<00:01:02.699> if

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
which basically warms things up or if

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.520 
which basically warms things up or if
you<00:01:02.969> want<00:01:03.210> all<00:01:03.359> that<00:01:03.510> high-end<00:01:03.750> information

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
you want all that high-end information

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.609 
you want all that high-end information
with<00:01:04.860> a<00:01:04.890> single<00:01:05.280> button<00:01:05.489> so<00:01:06.240> you're<00:01:07.020> back

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
with a single button so you're back

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.800 
with a single button so you're back
working<00:01:08.490> with<00:01:08.640> your<00:01:08.820> tone<00:01:09.060> control<00:01:09.479> can<00:01:09.690> get

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
working with your tone control can get

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.400 
working with your tone control can get
you<00:01:09.930> a<00:01:09.960> lot<00:01:10.200> of<00:01:10.229> different<00:01:10.440> variations<00:01:11.280> so

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:12.410 
you a lot of different variations so

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:27.950 
you a lot of different variations so
very<00:01:13.410> dry<00:01:16.220> I'll<00:01:17.220> start<00:01:17.520> with<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.729> high<00:01:17.880> cut

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.800 

shut<00:01:28.960> it<00:01:28.990> out

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
shut it out

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.679 
shut it out
warm<00:01:31.200> it<00:01:31.350> up

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.440 

I'll<00:01:33.960> write<00:01:34.259> it<00:01:34.289> up

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
I'll write it up

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.080 
I'll write it up
now<00:01:36.960> with<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.200> high<00:01:37.380> shelf<00:01:37.710> with<00:01:37.830> the<00:01:37.860> treble

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.300 

not<00:01:42.090> even<00:01:42.390> imagine<00:01:42.810> so<00:01:42.900> yeah<00:01:43.140> a<00:01:43.410> real<00:01:43.830> trouble

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
not even imagine so yeah a real trouble

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.000 
not even imagine so yeah a real trouble
ship<00:01:44.550> which<00:01:45.180> is<00:01:45.210> nice

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:47.010 
ship which is nice

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:49.580 
ship which is nice
you<00:01:47.610> wanted<00:01:47.940> to<00:01:47.970> fun<00:01:48.300> but<00:01:48.780> in<00:01:48.900> a<00:01:49.020> different

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
you wanted to fun but in a different

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.740 
you wanted to fun but in a different
setting<00:01:49.830> you<00:01:50.070> really<00:01:50.460> don't<00:01:50.610> want<00:01:50.790> to<00:01:50.880> fill

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
setting you really don't want to fill

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:59.150 
setting you really don't want to fill
your<00:01:51.870> ears<00:01:52.080> or<00:01:52.320> jump<00:01:52.890> out<00:01:53.010> too<00:01:53.250> much<00:01:53.430> so<00:01:58.160> very

00:01:59.150 --> 00:01:59.160 
your ears or jump out too much so very

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.460 
your ears or jump out too much so very
warm<00:01:59.370> ball<00:02:00.030> FET<00:02:00.330> driven<00:02:00.750> it's<00:02:00.990> got<00:02:01.200> a<00:02:01.229> high

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:01.470 
warm ball FET driven it's got a high

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.940 
warm ball FET driven it's got a high
high<00:02:02.210> headroom<00:02:03.210> where<00:02:03.810> we<00:02:04.050> have<00:02:04.229> a<00:02:04.260> constant

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
high headroom where we have a constant

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.740 
high headroom where we have a constant
Headroom<00:02:05.460> technology<00:02:06.030> that<00:02:06.210> bumps<00:02:06.510> up<00:02:06.630> the

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
Headroom technology that bumps up the

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.660 
Headroom technology that bumps up the
9-volt<00:02:07.110> battery<00:02:07.560> so<00:02:07.979> you<00:02:08.040> got<00:02:08.190> a<00:02:08.220> really<00:02:08.429> nice

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
9-volt battery so you got a really nice

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.030 
9-volt battery so you got a really nice
voltage<00:02:09.509> and<00:02:09.780> predictable<00:02:10.350> voltage<00:02:10.710> to<00:02:10.860> work

voltage and predictable voltage to work

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.970 
voltage and predictable voltage to work
with<00:02:11.390> that's<00:02:12.390> that's<00:02:12.870> it<00:02:13.170> all<00:02:13.320> true<00:02:13.590> hardwired

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
with that's that's it all true hardwired
