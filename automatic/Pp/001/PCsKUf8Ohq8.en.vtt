00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:49.010 
changing as i'm doing a really thick so

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:59.500 
changing as i'm doing a really thick so
yeah<00:01:56.680> okay<00:01:57.680> so<00:01:57.710> now<00:01:58.130> i'm<00:01:58.340> taking<00:01:58.370> the<00:01:59.000> glitter

00:01:59.500 --> 00:01:59.510

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790 
glitter but i find it works better if it

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.030 
glitter but i find it works better if it
has<00:02:04.970> some<00:02:05.180> color<00:02:05.450> so<00:02:05.840> this<00:02:06.050> is<00:02:06.230> teenage<00:02:06.710> dream

thing ever and is from the katy perry
collection<00:02:11.480> and<00:02:12.070> literally<00:02:13.070> what<00:02:13.310> I'm<00:02:13.430> doing

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
collection and literally what I'm doing

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.030 
collection and literally what I'm doing
I'm<00:02:13.820> just<00:02:13.910> kind<00:02:14.240> of<00:02:14.300> padding<00:02:14.900> the<00:02:15.200> top<00:02:15.470> of<00:02:15.680> my

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
I'm just kind of padding the top of my

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.370 
I'm just kind of padding the top of my
nails<00:02:16.250> so<00:02:16.460> it's<00:02:17.090> kind<00:02:17.420> of<00:02:17.510> like<00:02:17.570> a<00:02:17.690> french<00:02:18.050> tip

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.400 
nails so it's kind of like a french tip
but<00:02:19.340> honestly<00:02:19.790> it<00:02:20.720> looks<00:02:20.900> better<00:02:21.140> if<00:02:21.290> you're

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
but honestly it looks better if you're

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:22.600 
but honestly it looks better if you're
messing<00:02:21.770> with<00:02:21.800> it<00:02:21.980> so<00:02:22.130> you<00:02:22.190> don't<00:02:22.340> have<00:02:22.400> to

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
messing with it so you don't have to

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:23.890 
messing with it so you don't have to
worry<00:02:22.760> about<00:02:22.880> getting<00:02:23.000> it<00:02:23.390> in<00:02:23.510> a<00:02:23.600> straight

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
worry about getting it in a straight

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.900 
worry about getting it in a straight
line<00:02:23.930> or<00:02:24.110> anything<00:02:24.590> you're<00:02:25.280> literally<00:02:25.610> just

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
line or anything you're literally just
