00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.849
 a product I had play outside and put the 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.709
 other when it was used I think 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:23.530
 It's much easier, but there you are. 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:25.180

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.739
 here you do not see and feel different with 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.950
 The solution that I found, let's see if 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:28.950
 succeed 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:39.819

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:12.549

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:16.209

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:19.450

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:24.940

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:55.959

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:57.819
 300 grams of potatoes from 11 girls I 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:04:02.260

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:03.310
