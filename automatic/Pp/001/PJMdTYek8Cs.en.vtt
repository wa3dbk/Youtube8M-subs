00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450 
before I got them my htc and how this

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.210 
before I got them my htc and how this
would<00:00:06.600> actually<00:00:06.690> work<00:00:07.350> with<00:00:07.620> a<00:00:07.649> music<00:00:08.040> player

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220

this<00:00:09.990> up<00:00:10.139> to<00:00:10.200> the<00:00:10.349> computer<00:00:10.820> which<00:00:11.820> is<00:00:11.940> my

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
this up to the computer which is my

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.519 
this up to the computer which is my
Linux<00:00:12.450> Ubuntu<00:00:13.340> 1004<00:00:14.389> machine<00:00:15.389> and<00:00:15.660> just<00:00:16.440> to

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
Linux Ubuntu 1004 machine and just to

show you what this looks like so I'm

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.220 
show you what this looks like so I'm
just<00:00:18.300> gonna<00:00:18.420> plug<00:00:18.810> this<00:00:18.990> in<00:00:19.939> and<00:00:21.050> it's<00:00:22.050> gonna

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
just gonna plug this in and it's gonna

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.460 
just gonna plug this in and it's gonna
connect<00:00:22.740> now<00:00:23.600> you<00:00:24.600> can<00:00:24.779> connect<00:00:25.080> in<00:00:25.199> several

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
connect now you can connect in several

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:26.960 
connect now you can connect in several
different<00:00:25.590> ways<00:00:25.769> one<00:00:26.189> is<00:00:26.220> just<00:00:26.340> to<00:00:26.699> charge

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
different ways one is just to charge

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.820 
different ways one is just to charge
only<00:00:27.240> and<00:00:27.720> one<00:00:27.900> is<00:00:28.019> to<00:00:28.140> mount<00:00:28.320> as<00:00:28.380> a<00:00:28.410> disk<00:00:28.710> drive

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
only and one is to mount as a disk drive

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.650

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
default is called called rhythm box

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.569 
default is called called rhythm box
actually<00:01:31.500> if<00:01:31.740> you<00:01:31.829> look<00:01:32.009> down<00:01:32.130> here<00:01:32.189> you<00:01:32.430> can
