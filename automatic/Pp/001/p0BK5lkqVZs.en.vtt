00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:08.370
 hello everyone and welcome to 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.930
 doctissimo for your mini health 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.190
 devoted today or in 

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:13.860
 adults and to talk about it we get 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.260
 Dr. Christophe Bedos surgeons 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:20.190
 dentists and now the question 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.360
 ariane leymarie d'ariane squeaks 

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:24.780
 teeth during his sleep 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:26.400
 how to fix it good for nothing we will you 

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:27.810
 advise to change husband but that's 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.100
 true that this britsih in the middle of the night 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.810
 must end up typing a little on the 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.489
 system in medical jargon on 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.809
 call it a jug 6 mhz so doctor 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.620
 and vdo what are the main ones 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.940
 causes the causes are known but not 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.280
 very well defined they come 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.019
 a disturbance of the nervous system 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.280
 central that causes contractions 

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:45.809
 muscular and nocturnal movements 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.210
 of the mandible that can be 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.710
 aggravated by stress and potentiate 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.719
 by the stress of the facts so big 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.219
 besides the sound of creaky teeth and 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.690
 who can wake up the spouse what 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.949
 are the other symptoms of the wholesaler 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.269
 when we are single for example 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.699
 how to know that we are suffering from pitcher 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:03.839
 to be observant about these on its 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:05.479
 teeth if we note the absence of relief if 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:09.719
 we see that there is accelerated wear 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:11.430
 it can alert the wear of the layer 

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:13.469
 enamel causes the laying bare of the 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.610
 dentine therefore potential sensitivities 

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:16.950
 cold to acidity 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.869
 so these are all elements that 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.880
 can also alert more to 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.439
 distance of the teeth one can wake up 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.840
 in the morning with sensations of 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:27.359
 muscle contractions the patients 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.680
 describe situations of two teeth 

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:31.320
 tight when he even wakes up 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.869
 during the night the models he head me 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.730
 can actually be associated with this 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.260
 type 2 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:38.240
 of behavior what we have the means 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:40.190
 today to process the proxy sme on 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.990
 is actually attacking rather 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:44.600
 consequences 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:49.490
 on dental wear we interpose a 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:51.399
 gutter which at least this makes fuser to 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.180
 the place of the teeth and who at best 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:55.070
 causes muscle relaxation 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.930
 articulates and that prevents blurring of 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.340
 saw that wakes up ariane every 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.530
 nights yes it's very important 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.270
 thank you zealous merian doctor not your 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.929
 matter to you in any case to 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.929
 recovering sleep
