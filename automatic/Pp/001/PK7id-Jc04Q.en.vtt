00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:06.290
 now all welcome to this league of 

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:09.290
 legends cloud replace number 4 in which 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:11.210
 we will show 4 shocking plays and not 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:12.349
 is going to happen with the cricket number 3 that you 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:14.389
 I said to see the stars at the end 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:16.850
 there were 5 in this type that are going to be 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:18.770
 four and they are four as how 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:21.470
 fantastic as the musketeers like 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:23.449
 the ninja turtles four crazy like what 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:26.240
 next the apocalypse as they dress them 

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:28.310
 not that not like the beatles not good either 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.590
 like the fingers of the hand the simpsons and 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:33.200
 how do I put rangers that I hope that 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:34.640
 children can not reject 4 because it 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.530
 the black I tell it not to programs 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.700
 you just do not need anything we go with the 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.260
 plays 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.810
 we go with the first move we have a 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.400
 they 'll leave between 44 but 2 the 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:45.800
 fortunes and has a time because it 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:48.170
 they will eat him alive 4 number 3 a king 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.390
 He hooks up to a ladybird and kills her 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.580
 I played my fortune if we did not get 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:56.710
 table cai but does not escape to dress up 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:58.629
 kate and now we go with the section to 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:03.309
 does not understand anything I do not understand either 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:07.960
 nothing like rivers, we are ruled by the norm 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:10.900
 for adam that means walk to the 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:13.380
 your mother's shell or something like this this month 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:16.960
 that grabs us puts us on the map of 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.950
 all life is in one line and the only thing 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.560
 what they do is put some 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:23.680
 detachment of some bridges fill it 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:26.020
 one has said white that they have horns and 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:28.180
 we are required to go through all the hair 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.880
 meharry or we are about now going to 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.830
 know how a new map is designed to 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.990
 league of legends and then we go to a 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:37.689
 play thanks 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.970
 good was here the tutorial for rivers 

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:43.380
 how to make a new map for him I say 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.380
 legend or lol 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.799
 what we are going to first is 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.620
 on this map that I recommend is a 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:54.390
 little blue flag 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:54.390
 a little red flag on the other side 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:01.899
 and what you have to do is the team 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:04.899
 blue red and blue red i am not from 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:06.700
 Atomic has to grab the flag of the 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:08.830
 red team has to grab the flag 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.500
 blue team will start its own flag 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:15.370
 that typical game of catching the flag 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:17.560
 the network with your mother's cha good I hope 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.010
 it happens that this is not very visible 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.010
 it seemed 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:29.250
 another approach that we have is a 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:33.200
 one strategy is this is the 515 map 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:37.500
 and what we do is mark the points 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:39.299
 so that with the lateral pass of the 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.239
 barrier with previous movement deception of the 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:45.180
 first player and the triangulation with the 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:47.300
 third so that goal now this either 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.640
 it does not help 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:52.280
 ok then let's try other 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:56.120
 things is the typical square and this is the 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:58.940
 map that I recommend riad is an X 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.780
 a cross you want to call it we have the 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:04.080
 blue Team 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:06.720
 we have the red team to fit already 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.850
 Carmen likes it a lot because of the inhibitor 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:12.240
 it's good this map was passed a kind 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:14.160
 of Chinese video game console crosspiece 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.300
 the theme of this game which is the 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.090
 following previously they have to 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:20.340
 the blue team has to come 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:24.090
 here grab a resource and I speak what 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:26.040
 green and it gives you more a passing point that 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:31.319
 when it grabs the appeal from the party 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:33.450
 blue is the champion with the color and what 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:35.790
 get in there as you want to do that already 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.500
 of the rivers the reds games the same in 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.780
 everything is that the reds do not stick and 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.880
 the blues are here long good 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.250
 the issue is that when they have the shit 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.060
 is on walks much more lethal than 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.190
 you carry original 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.850
 Well, it's not original, it's crap but 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:53.519
 good thing is that if the blue team 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:57.630
 come here and wear the flag 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:04:01.580
 here it would be a tower like those of the 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:01.580
 dominion in the cock 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:08.780
 and punished him out dressed with ready eta 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:10.610
 and if he captured it, take out the base and close it 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:12.970
 this and the team can not get it 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:15.130
 the uninhibited 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:16.450
 what happens that he has to win again the 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:18.370
 career you understood the system is a 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:19.900
 good fuck are you left here says for 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:23.440
 depend on this map of gifts 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:25.210
 rivers we send with the plays 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:29.290
 let's go with the first move be more 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:31.810
 gross kilo manÃ© in the 14 plow and killing 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:33.910
 it must escape that to apply to 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:37.210
 I relax to tell me good after 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:39.790
 do triple the one that ends up being 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:41.800
 march everything remains on the street there is 

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:45.700
 is flying with a 10% of life that if 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:48.340
 we put of official of the sea 

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:53.110
 and in tweets with the barrier goes super 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:54.610
 troll laughing face and the catalinas 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:05:00.580
 hot 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:05:01.810
 to kill but mine has the 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:03.630
 repetition of what the 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:07.690
 reaction not from the player 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:10.560
 representing the catalina to see how you 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:10.560
 they took out the pendulum 

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:16.810
 you wanted blocks not because of block xv 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:19.420
 to the thing very attentive draw great that 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:27.000
 will rise two last with the 

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:27.000
 skills that have demand what is 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:36.060
 good 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:36.060
 the repetition and the brawn box 

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:40.000
 we see the repetition and if it's a 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:42.340
 trista there is no difference this 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.020
 crystal on twitter quite the sevilla 

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:47.650
 how the kills with autism bounces for two 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:49.389
 sides we go with the penultimate play is 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:51.430
 again from catalina who fixed the 

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:53.830
 monitor then grabbed monito 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:56.560
 risk and started to break faces but if 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:58.479
 they notice that he killed first lys 

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:00.490
 the helix of back they took out kill and for 

00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:06.880
 that does not have no holds the letter 

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:08.830
 again and now we go with the last 

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:12.580
 play that is a kind of penta kirk 

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:15.190
 but but the reverse is there are 5.1 but 

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:16.479
 enter from this one is not explained because 

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:19.120
 does what it does mean with 

00:06:16.479 --> 00:06:20.800
 attention is put there against five be 

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:22.620
 the range the tower of the big strip for 

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:25.250
 back and if the gifts among all 

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:28.250
 inexplicable 

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:28.250
 plus 

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:37.630
 We will find 

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:39.490
 well, it's almost over , 64 many 

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:41.110
 thanks for watching them and there we put that 

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:42.970
 almost brutal effect because it made me very 

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:45.580
 long day we are like six minutes 

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:47.950
 as soon as well, well, we put a 

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:49.390
 I just hope you like it just 

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:53.620
 two or three leaves 

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:56.020
 good good, I say goodbye after the 

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:58.260
 groups if you're tired of the arrows and 

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:59.880
 strips from there and you'll see 

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:02.280
 10 centimeters 

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:05.120
 talking about little arrows look at them real 

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:10.499
 eat and arrow 

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:12.270
 and here we have a world doctor who 

00:07:10.499 --> 00:07:14.909
 he died in the form of faults mai to verse 

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:19.409
 but every time he got sad 

00:07:14.909 --> 00:07:20.999
 center and security look neza flash and 

00:07:19.409 --> 00:07:23.219
