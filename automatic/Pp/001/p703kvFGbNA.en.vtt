00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
antivirus because uh if we leave it on

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.600

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
delete some files because it's gonna

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.459 
delete some files because it's gonna
detect<00:00:48.239> that's<00:00:48.570> a<00:00:48.660> virus<00:00:48.960> even<00:00:49.230> though<00:00:49.320> it's

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
detect that's a virus even though it's

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.619 
detect that's a virus even though it's
not<00:00:49.739> and<00:00:50.039> then<00:00:50.460> if<00:00:50.789> it<00:00:50.910> deletes<00:00:51.149> a<00:00:51.239> file<00:00:51.420> it

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
not and then if it deletes a file it

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.900 
not and then if it deletes a file it
will<00:00:51.750> kind<00:00:51.899> of<00:00:51.960> screw<00:00:52.260> up<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.829> files<00:00:53.340> and<00:00:53.789> then

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
will kind of screw up the files and then

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.889 
will kind of screw up the files and then
it<00:00:54.660> will<00:00:54.809> not<00:00:54.989> work<00:00:55.199> so<00:00:55.789> I'm<00:00:56.789> gonna<00:00:56.969> up<00:00:57.120> Windows

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899

many tutorials on youtubes because the

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.940 
many tutorials on youtubes because the

gigabyte<00:01:53.369> file<00:01:53.640> so<00:01:53.939> it<00:01:54.119> should<00:01:54.299> take<00:01:54.420> a<00:01:54.450> couple

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
gigabyte file so it should take a couple

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.370

scroll down right here in TC the origin
underscore<00:02:47.579> set<00:02:47.849> it<00:02:47.940> up<00:02:48.030> so<00:02:48.180> install<00:02:48.480> that<00:02:48.659> so

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:49.139 
underscore set it up so install that so

00:02:49.139 --> 00:02:52.369 
underscore set it up so install that so
only<00:02:49.260> do<00:02:49.470> this<00:02:49.650> step<00:02:49.920> if<00:02:50.159> you<00:02:51.019> if<00:02:52.019> you<00:02:52.139> aren't

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:56.609 
able to get origin so once that is done

00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:59.599 
able to get origin so once that is done
we<00:02:57.439> can<00:02:58.439> close<00:02:58.590> those<00:02:58.829> out<00:02:59.040> and<00:02:59.340> we're<00:02:59.489> getting

00:02:59.599 --> 00:02:59.609 
we can close those out and we're getting

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:03.649 
we can close those out and we're getting

00:03:03.649 --> 00:03:03.659 
still the visual c++ will also be down

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:05.720 
still the visual c++ will also be down
below<00:03:03.840> in<00:03:03.989> description<00:03:04.340> so<00:03:05.340> just<00:03:05.549> click<00:03:05.670> on

bit<00:03:08.010> for<00:03:08.129> a<00:03:08.189> 32-bit<00:03:08.670> and<00:03:08.790> 64-bit<00:03:08.849> on<00:03:09.420> 64-bit<00:03:10.139> so

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
bit for a 32-bit and 64-bit on 64-bit so

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.110 
bit for a 32-bit and 64-bit on 64-bit so
how<00:03:10.680> the<00:03:10.739> 64-bit<00:03:11.310> by<00:03:11.489> I've<00:03:11.609> already<00:03:11.819> installed

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
how the 64-bit by I've already installed

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.610 
understand but hopefully I explained the
best<00:06:41.440> I<00:06:41.560> possibly<00:06:41.770> could<00:06:42.100> do<00:06:42.430> and<00:06:42.700> also<00:06:43.620> you

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:44.620 
best I possibly could do and also you

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:46.170

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:46.180 
may experience some crash throughout the

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:47.159 
may experience some crash throughout the
game<00:06:46.330> so<00:06:46.510> if<00:06:46.570> you<00:06:46.630> play<00:06:46.780> it<00:06:46.810> for<00:06:46.960> about<00:06:47.139> like

00:06:47.159 --> 00:06:47.169 
game so if you play it for about like

00:06:47.169 --> 00:06:47.820 
game so if you play it for about like
half<00:06:47.470> an<00:06:47.620> hour

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:47.830 
half an hour

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:50.940 
half an hour
the<00:06:48.340> game<00:06:48.520> might<00:06:48.790> crash<00:06:49.500> that<00:06:50.500> is<00:06:50.590> because

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:50.950 
the game might crash that is because

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:52.800 
the game might crash that is because
this<00:06:51.280> game<00:06:51.520> just<00:06:51.940> came<00:06:52.120> out<00:06:52.360> a<00:06:52.389> couple<00:06:52.480> days

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:52.810 
this game just came out a couple days

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:54.870 
this game just came out a couple days
ago<00:06:52.870> so<00:06:53.110> since<00:06:53.919> it<00:06:54.190> is<00:06:54.280> a<00:06:54.460> cracked<00:06:54.820> version

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:54.880 
ago so since it is a cracked version
