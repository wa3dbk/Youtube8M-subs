money out of thin air the reason you

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.540 
money out of thin air the reason you
can't<00:00:43.110> is<00:00:43.290> because<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.739> system<00:00:44.100> was<00:00:44.219> set<00:00:44.399> up

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
can't is because the system was set up

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.540 
can't is because the system was set up
that<00:00:44.760> way<00:00:45.020> people<00:00:46.020> aren't<00:00:46.710> allowed<00:00:46.800> to<00:00:46.980> create

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
that way people aren't allowed to create

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.310 
that way people aren't allowed to create
money<00:00:47.789> out<00:00:47.879> of<00:00:48.000> thin<00:00:48.120> air<00:00:48.300> only<00:00:48.629> banking

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
money out of thin air only banking

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.010 
money out of thin air only banking
interests<00:00:49.620> are<00:00:50.010> allowed<00:00:50.219> to<00:00:50.270> so<00:00:51.270> only<00:00:51.480> a<00:00:51.629> small

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
interests are allowed to so only a small

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.590 
interests are allowed to so only a small
percentage<00:00:52.289> of<00:00:52.800> society<00:00:53.430> which<00:00:53.640> owns<00:00:53.940> banks

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
percentage of society which owns banks

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.350 
percentage of society which owns banks
and<00:00:54.809> is<00:00:54.960> involved<00:00:55.440> in<00:00:55.559> banking<00:00:56.039> is<00:00:56.820> able<00:00:57.239> to

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
and is involved in banking is able to

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.770 
and is involved in banking is able to
counterfeit<00:00:57.870> money<00:00:58.079> in<00:00:58.320> effect<00:00:58.680> and

00:00:59.770 --> 00:00:59.780 
counterfeit money in effect and

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.029 
counterfeit money in effect and
therefore<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:00.930> rest<00:01:01.140> of<00:01:01.289> us<00:01:01.379> are<00:01:01.590> pretty<00:01:01.800> much

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
therefore the rest of us are pretty much

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.070 
therefore the rest of us are pretty much
going<00:01:02.309> to<00:01:02.399> be<00:01:02.520> enslaved<00:01:03.149> to<00:01:03.629> them<00:01:03.780> forever

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
going to be enslaved to them forever

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.070 
going to be enslaved to them forever
because<00:01:04.920> nobody<00:01:05.729> else<00:01:05.939> can<00:01:06.240> really<00:01:06.869> maintain

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
because nobody else can really maintain

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.030 
because nobody else can really maintain
the<00:01:07.920> value<00:01:08.310> of<00:01:09.150> their<00:01:09.479> wealth<00:01:09.799> because<00:01:10.799> there

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
the value of their wealth because there

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.170 
the value of their wealth because there
are<00:01:11.130> some<00:01:11.340> people<00:01:11.549> who<00:01:11.790> are<00:01:11.909> allowed<00:01:12.150> to

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
are some people who are allowed to

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.590 
are some people who are allowed to
counterfeit<00:01:12.720> money<00:01:12.869> a<00:01:13.140> bank<00:01:13.439> and<00:01:14.210> this<00:01:15.210> system

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
counterfeit money a bank and this system

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.630 
counterfeit money a bank and this system
basically<00:01:15.840> replaced<00:01:16.500> feudalism<00:01:17.070> in<00:01:17.310> Europe

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
basically replaced feudalism in Europe

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.240 
basically replaced feudalism in Europe
it<00:01:17.850> was<00:01:17.880> one<00:01:18.570> system<00:01:19.020> of<00:01:19.140> slavery<00:01:19.439> replacing

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
it was one system of slavery replacing

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.340 
it was one system of slavery replacing
another<00:01:20.520> and<00:01:20.790> then<00:01:21.240> it<00:01:21.330> spread<00:01:21.659> to<00:01:21.689> America

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
another and then it spread to America

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.070 
another and then it spread to America
and<00:01:22.560> now<00:01:23.250> our<00:01:23.610> society<00:01:24.420> is<00:01:24.540> basically

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
and now our society is basically

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.200 
and now our society is basically
enslaved<00:01:25.530> by<00:01:25.830> it<00:01:25.890> even<00:01:26.280> if<00:01:26.400> you<00:01:26.520> rent<00:01:26.880> for

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
enslaved by it even if you rent for

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.730 
enslaved by it even if you rent for
example<00:01:27.659> you're<00:01:27.810> still<00:01:28.110> paying<00:01:28.380> a<00:01:28.560> huge

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
example you're still paying a huge

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.859 
example you're still paying a huge
percentage<00:01:29.340> of<00:01:29.490> your<00:01:29.610> rent<00:01:29.880> to<00:01:30.509> your<00:01:30.630> landlord

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
percentage of your rent to your landlord

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.690 
percentage of your rent to your landlord
so<00:01:31.350> your<00:01:31.500> landlord<00:01:32.009> can<00:01:32.220> pay<00:01:32.369> off<00:01:32.490> the

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
so your landlord can pay off the

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.510 
so your landlord can pay off the
interest<00:01:32.729> on<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.360> loan<00:01:33.650> the<00:01:34.650> interest<00:01:34.890> on<00:01:35.369> the

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
interest on the loan the interest on the

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:36.950 
interest on the loan the interest on the
money<00:01:35.640> that<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:36.000> bank<00:01:36.030> is<00:01:36.329> created<00:01:36.810> out<00:01:36.900> of

nothing there's absolutely no reason an

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.030 
nothing there's absolutely no reason an
individual<00:01:40.049> shouldn't<00:01:40.439> be<00:01:40.560> able<00:01:40.770> to<00:01:40.890> create

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
individual shouldn't be able to create

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.100 
individual shouldn't be able to create
