 I want you to take the word of 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:32.630

 likewise of feet as you are 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.570
 This was an afternoon of glory and 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.250
 blessing we have been built 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:43.100
 strongly by the word of the Lord 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:46.010

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:48.430
 amen take the word of God in the 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:52.250
 second book of Corinthians chapter 9 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:54.820
 let's consider the text from the 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.820
 height of him 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:05.890
 the circle 4 please second book of 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:09.160
 Corinthians chapter 9 verse 4 says of the 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:11.650
 next way lest if it came 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.520
 with me some of the Macedonians or 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:16.310
 I will find you unprepared 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.979
 he speaks to us we are ashamed of ourselves 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.210
 you say you of this in 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:23.030
 our confidence 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.710
 therefore I had to release 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.140
 the brothers who were first to 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:30.659
 you and prepare first yours 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:34.790
 generosity before promised 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:38.840
 so that it is ready as generosity 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:40.640
 not as our requirement but this 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.550
 I say that the one that always scarcely 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.500
 you also earn poorly and the one 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:48.860
 generously sow generously 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:51.610
 will reap fears 3 minutes sit down for 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.610
 explain this 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:57.780
 Hallelujah when they are in victory yet 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.719
 follow it flowing there that does not get the 

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:03.719
 people 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:10.140
 within a service of a cult one of 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:12.410
 the things that we have done for 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.790
 god's mandate is to take the offering 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:17.450
 we understand that it is part of what 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.450
 what is the offering 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.810
 is interpreted as the worship of 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.430
 sir so I can bring him to 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.500
 God is to say that we understand that to 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:30.000
 Through our finances we adore the 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:32.160
 mister someone says come with this 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.320
 and the apostle Paul in chapter 9 of the 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.140
 Corinthians book is speaking something 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:38.700
 very clear and to cut him short in this 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.320
 part because I know there are people who 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.780
 are waiting for this moment of 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.840
 adoration to god the apostle is 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.640
 talking and says 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.340
 that he is sent to the brothers for 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.650
 that they prepare themselves and do not take it in a 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.300
 surprising because he had a 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.660
 thinking as to what they 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:03:00.260
 they were that they were ordered and that 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:02.560
 they were giving in their offerings and that here 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:05.120
 Present the Apostle Paul Barbie says 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.920
 that they are going to give him what 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.260
 they are going to present that it is not for 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:13.129
 requirement of the gift of the same but 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:15.080
 generosity and one of the principles that 

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:17.940
 today they are in decline is the 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:21.000
 generosity within the church 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:23.310
 There will be someone to tell me in the big 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.280
 demands that these ministries have 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:28.290
 come by the scant generosity within 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.630
 of altars and people have not 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.640
 learned to be is generous glory to 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:35.160
 god for those who concern the work of 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:37.140
 Lord and the Apostle Paul is speaking 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.630
 something very clear he says I did not accrue to 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.370
 you to demand nothing simple and 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:44.490
 plainly I leave it what is the 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:47.010
 generosity and one who is generous 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:49.500
 will understand that the one who sows sparingly 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:51.420
 will barely get here there is no 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.790
 to lose was that there is no code scribe and 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:56.070
 science here there is no depth the 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:58.740
 finish this text saying that the one 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:00.840
 always scarcely scarcely is a 

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:03.810
 law that sows love sparingly 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:06.420
 scarcely harvest love that 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:09.600
 sow glory to god finals sparingly 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:11.940
 barely received finance is to say 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:14.310
 that we are going to receive according to 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:16.090
 As we sow, there will be someone 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:17.949
 who understands this 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:19.949
 and the poor apostle is saying of 

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:22.690
 according to the generosity of your heart 

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:25.270
 you have to present offerings 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:27.250
 generosity has to prove so much what 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:30.610
 that you are grateful from the 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:33.070
 Lord a generous heart is a heart 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:36.010
 that presents blossom glory in front of 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:37.860
 altar of god for gave power to finance and 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:41.050
 bring the project that is in your heart 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:43.000
 God tells him Moses and said to him look 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:45.699
 I have a dream and exposed in his 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.700
 heart you go build the altar and of 

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:51.610
 god god the design of the mountain and bassinet 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:53.950
 wonders how I'm going to perform such 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:56.770
 design and god spoke to them he said 

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:58.690
 glory new matter for your to carry 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:01.540
 out this design is in the village 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:04.120
 you do not play with him and God speaks to him says 

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:06.190
 tell the people what glory God offers 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:09.490
 that is to say that there are many ways of 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:12.400
 we can bring the thoughts of 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:14.710
 god here on earth a vision has 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:17.350
 to be paid for by the generous heart 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:19.420
 of a people there will be someone who understands 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:22.180
 what god is talking about 

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:24.550
 that is to say Moses had the clear vision 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:27.100
 inside the town was finance and I 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:29.890
 I tell him , Moses, stack the town that happens and 

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:31.510
 he traced patterns of the offerings he told me 

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:33.640
 I want them to bring gold 

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:35.410
 I want them to bring the money because 

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:37.240
 what they bring wood I want 

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:39.580
 that I bring in different stone 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:41.950
 precious is to say that the vision the 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:43.870
 goddess door to finance the project 

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:46.690
 is in the village soul praises me the 

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:49.390
 glory of God and what is the problem in 

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:52.270
 this time because there is glory to god 

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:57.330
 that goddess projects are not 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:57.330
 seen for lack of a generous heart 

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:03.320
 I am completely sure that if I 

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:06.200
 I say that I have a cause my daughter 

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:08.480
 is sick and is going to die for a 

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:09.800
 operation and I say I want everything to happen 

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:11.600
 the world people are going to stop because 

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:15.670
 people are used to work for 

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:15.670
 need that for generosity 

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.380
 there will be someone who understands this the 

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:22.240
 Apostle Paul says he does not see 

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:24.340
 need 

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:28.470
 that's not a matter of necessity is 

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:28.470
 question of a generous heart 

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:36.540
 there will be someone who understands 

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:38.820
 nor sadness or of necessity the 

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:40.980
 offerings that are brought to the altar are 

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:43.470
 connected to a generous heart that 

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:46.020
 understand who is god not to buy 

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:48.660
 buy favors from God because nobody 

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:50.640
 you can buy it but to show it to 

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:53.580
 he glory me so much that he is 

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:56.180
 grateful for what someone opens 

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:56.180
 that says amen
