00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:06.250
 and there they talk and now we're going to have another video 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:07.520
 a video of 

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:08.929
 concrete filters 

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:09.819
 3 

00:00:09.819 --> 00:00:10.909
 without 

00:00:10.909 --> 00:00:13.599
 Battlefield 3 is a game that we hoped 

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:15.289
 long time 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:17.119
 It is a game that really 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:21.339
 perez I think in my opinion that will be elected the game of the year gotti 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:23.050
 ef 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:26.239
 today 27 of the new iguaÃ§u 

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:27.500
 open 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.550
 the hostel is here is only for those who prove the sale 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:31.930
 na poule d 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.850
 I just bought it and luckily I did not buy it and I won 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.460
 but came to Bethlehem 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.400
 was given a scene 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.800
 the cut is a saint that the goal is 10 years to have a city cut ter Tuesday 5 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.260
 minutes and little is seen 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.150
 because I did not want to do a very large bentley 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:54.080
 You here soon would die and you could see that I want what I want 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.550
 I say that what it is but it is not that I want the cac topped shows his camera 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.440
 which was from the crowd buy two 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.600
 only the very blurred camera as it is the beta has many many bugs and I go 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.420
 to quote them by the way 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:06.820
 You can see that 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.280
 is that in high definition 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.180
 after being considered criminal 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.640
 entered it as ibis podium now ended up costing more than 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.380
 profession and boring suzana happens there 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.040
 To put it there was caught with the ones I did. 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.290
 in the last times 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.680
 was killed there are two of the kind 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.530
 I'm going to lay 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.730
 I apologized in mine 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:32.030
 damiana 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.790
 Nazarene of 6 of ours was very good was very good you know that I got better 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:38.370
 a lot of time and after that 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:40.590
 this one had notice in the two days 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.820
 of the emicon tapir was very bad after I put it 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:46.800
 there charged me better and much 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.700
 or that I pass this beta 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.110
 only a phase 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.460
 that this is why the program only 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.060
 If you find the country you can see a cold front in the background so if you 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:57.050
 they saw 

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.460
 and this has in the hatch model also if the server 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.460
 From here it is closed 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:06.430
 of copies of the other map 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:07.909
 what 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:09.539
 He came into Brazil. 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.649
 Come on, I'll use the boss or the squeeze on the voter now. 

00:02:13.789 --> 00:02:17.729
 I think it's still very much changed on the left side than the reader's serve 

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:21.549
 and if you give him enough of the ones to the extent that I like 

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:22.839
 You kill a fondness. 

00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:24.479
 Good now with playing well. 

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:27.769
 Now you see there I started there in that fight. 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:30.779
 the must have had this match was not spectacular 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:32.560
 but the phrase here 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.389
 there medium 

00:02:34.389 --> 00:02:37.799
 it is 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:40.329
 I hate not too bad to know 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:41.500
 maybe it's because of that 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:42.950
 and I do not like it very much 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.090
 and in the afternoon until I went this far I was saying that it is impossible to reach 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.490
 on here 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:49.419
 during the examination it was difficult 

00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:51.109
 because I think this phase 

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:52.530
 in the beginning until it gives 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.959
 but arrives in the last match the team with is impossible impossible gun because 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:59.019
 is a very open guy until August scored green 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:02.019
 and if you miss less gun passes 

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:08.989
 we were able to win and so far but we have already won three times in September 

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:11.080
 ef 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.409
 you get a beautiful press campaign dressing room 

00:03:14.409 --> 00:03:17.189
 and I have to respect the Seattle bands 

00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:20.399
 but even so the game is very very very good 

00:03:20.399 --> 00:03:23.989
 I saw how this happens you can read newspaper see 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:26.989
 in fact if there is no evidence has a page in the browser 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:29.359
 what is called 

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:30.549
 bertolotti 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:33.829
 you stay there and you will see servers over there and everything else 

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:34.740
 ef 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:38.010
 accept the server but admits that this is proven to be very 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:39.809
 people for now 

00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:43.409
 so it's very difficult to play, it's very difficult to play 

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:44.769
 and that's when I started 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:46.419
 There was a beautiful one, a beautiful one. 

00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:47.839
 courteous play 

00:03:47.839 --> 00:03:50.609
 I've already killed two 

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:52.019
 P 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:55.019
 I carried it if it was that pain and it worked out well. 

00:03:55.749 --> 00:03:58.849
 after being so expensive and desperate for January 

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:00.829
 it's a fair 

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:03.299
 and the face of my team 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:05.919
 then it will take another two years 

00:04:05.919 --> 00:04:10.319
 and then I was very happy finding myself a good game I went up from miranda and there the guy 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:11.429
 got the knife 

00:04:11.429 --> 00:04:14.779
 it is very cool the fa cup system also from the front of the bc buy in two 

00:04:14.779 --> 00:04:17.169
 but it's very cool 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:18.239
 ef 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:20.949
 there to finalize the comparsas in the city 

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:25.210
 tel logs played itaqui a lot of litocar a thousand asses he does not play 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:25.629
 anything 

00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:27.009
 and if I fall 

00:04:27.009 --> 00:04:29.529
 and then she's done beautiful 

00:04:29.529 --> 00:04:33.029
 the are as good in general as the two of them but it is very good 

00:04:33.029 --> 00:04:36.159
 I called him and today with the sea that I will be I was a child 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:40.939
 and some 2 of abav-sp tavares this decision 

00:04:40.939 --> 00:04:42.360
 We're not afraid of them. 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:43.949
 P 

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:46.860
 and I also hope I can decide 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:50.180
 I did it well at the start, not too much, but I changed a little well. 

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:52.249
 ef 

00:04:52.249 --> 00:04:55.669
 I meant the last video is uttered last place 

00:04:55.669 --> 00:04:58.870
