another web series so in this series

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:21.390 
another web series so in this series
we're<00:00:19.270> going<00:00:19.420> to<00:00:19.480> get<00:00:19.869> another<00:00:20.200> Photoshop<00:00:21.160> PSD

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:21.400 
we're going to get another Photoshop PSD

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.609 
we're going to get another Photoshop PSD
we're<00:00:22.000> going<00:00:22.150> to<00:00:22.210> convert<00:00:22.570> that<00:00:22.750> into<00:00:23.050> HTML

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:23.619 
we're going to convert that into HTML

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:25.530 
we're going to convert that into HTML
CSS<00:00:23.830> and<00:00:24.369> then<00:00:25.000> we're<00:00:25.090> going<00:00:25.210> to<00:00:25.239> create<00:00:25.419> a

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:25.540 
CSS and then we're going to create a

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:27.089 
CSS and then we're going to create a
dynamic<00:00:26.079> website<00:00:26.290> so<00:00:26.800> it<00:00:26.860> will<00:00:26.950> have<00:00:27.070> a

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:27.099 
dynamic website so it will have a

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:29.819 
dynamic website so it will have a
database<00:00:27.640> with<00:00:28.599> login<00:00:28.840> controls<00:00:29.439> or<00:00:29.710> those

00:00:29.819 --> 00:00:29.829 
database with login controls or those

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:32.880 
database with login controls or those
sorts<00:00:29.980> of<00:00:30.130> things<00:00:30.340> password<00:00:30.970> resets<00:00:31.739> so<00:00:32.739> the

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:32.890 
sorts of things password resets so the

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:33.720 
sorts of things password resets so the
first<00:00:33.100> thing<00:00:33.250> we're<00:00:33.340> going<00:00:33.460> to<00:00:33.550> want<00:00:33.700> to

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:33.730 
first thing we're going to want to

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.479 
first thing we're going to want to
actually<00:00:34.000> do<00:00:34.180> is<00:00:34.329> actually<00:00:34.480> get<00:00:34.750> the<00:00:35.110> PSD<00:00:35.829> so

00:00:36.479 --> 00:00:36.489 
actually do is actually get the PSD so

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:21.670 
is the actual design here so we're going

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.880 
is the actual design here so we're going
to<00:01:21.729> be<00:01:21.880> building<00:01:22.270> this<00:01:22.509> with<00:01:23.049> HTML<00:01:23.649> and<00:01:23.770> CSS

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 
to be building this with HTML and CSS

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.310 
to be building this with HTML and CSS
and<00:01:24.490> then<00:01:25.180> we're<00:01:25.299> going<00:01:25.390> to<00:01:25.450> like<00:01:25.689> I<00:01:25.719> said<00:01:25.960> make

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:26.320 
and then we're going to like I said make

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.889 
and then we're going to like I said make
it<00:01:26.350> database<00:01:27.130> driven<00:01:27.369> with<00:01:28.000> login<00:01:28.299> controls

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:28.899 
it database driven with login controls

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:30.870 
it database driven with login controls
all<00:01:29.140> that<00:01:29.320> sort<00:01:29.530> of<00:01:29.590> thing<00:01:29.799> ok<00:01:30.399> so<00:01:30.460> if<00:01:30.640> we<00:01:30.670> just

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 
all that sort of thing ok so if we just

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.330 
all that sort of thing ok so if we just
click<00:01:31.030> on<00:01:31.180> the<00:01:31.299> download<00:01:31.509> PSD<00:01:32.259> file<00:01:32.560> and<00:01:32.829> then

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
click on the download PSD file and then

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.289 
click on the download PSD file and then
just<00:01:33.369> save<00:01:33.700> that<00:01:33.729> somewhere<00:01:34.270> on<00:01:34.420> your<00:01:34.630> PC<00:01:36.299> ok

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:37.299 
just save that somewhere on your PC ok

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:38.639 
just save that somewhere on your PC ok
so<00:01:37.360> now<00:01:37.570> we've<00:01:37.689> done<00:01:37.719> that<00:01:37.899> so<00:01:38.320> if<00:01:38.380> we<00:01:38.500> just

00:01:38.639 --> 00:01:38.649 
so now we've done that so if we just

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:41.249 
so now we've done that so if we just
open<00:01:38.829> that<00:01:39.100> up<00:01:39.189> in<00:01:39.340> Photoshop<00:01:39.960> so<00:01:40.960> the<00:01:41.140> way

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:41.259 
open that up in Photoshop so the way

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:42.870 
open that up in Photoshop so the way
we'll<00:01:41.439> do<00:01:41.560> it<00:01:41.590> then<00:01:41.799> we'll<00:01:41.920> create<00:01:42.189> the<00:01:42.280> logo

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
we'll do it then we'll create the logo

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.700 
we'll do it then we'll create the logo
up<00:01:43.060> here<00:01:43.329> and<00:01:43.539> then<00:01:44.079> obviously<00:01:44.229> we'll<00:01:44.530> create

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:44.710 
up here and then obviously we'll create

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.279 
up here and then obviously we'll create
the<00:01:44.799> navigation<00:01:45.390> but<00:01:46.390> probably<00:01:46.869> at<00:01:46.960> the<00:01:47.079> top

00:01:47.279 --> 00:01:47.289 
the navigation but probably at the top

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:51.029 
the navigation but probably at the top
here<00:01:47.649> we'll<00:01:48.250> create<00:01:49.000> the<00:01:49.180> login<00:01:49.810> section<00:01:50.229> so

00:01:51.029 --> 00:01:51.039 
here we'll create the login section so

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:52.200 
here we'll create the login section so
where<00:01:51.189> they<00:01:51.310> put<00:01:51.490> in<00:01:51.579> their<00:01:51.729> username<00:01:51.969> and

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
where they put in their username and

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.660 
where they put in their username and
password<00:01:52.600> and<00:01:52.810> click<00:01:52.960> login<00:01:53.340> and<00:01:54.340> obviously

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
password and click login and obviously

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.209 
password and click login and obviously
we'll<00:01:54.939> then<00:01:55.090> build<00:01:55.299> out<00:01:55.479> the<00:01:56.020> main<00:01:56.740> content

00:01:57.209 --> 00:01:57.219 
we'll then build out the main content

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:59.639 
we'll then build out the main content
here<00:01:57.520> and<00:01:58.479> then<00:01:58.840> we'll<00:01:58.960> create<00:01:59.140> this<00:01:59.289> footer

00:01:59.639 --> 00:01:59.649 
here and then we'll create this footer

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:00.840 
here and then we'll create this footer
with<00:02:00.039> all<00:02:00.159> the<00:02:00.310> graphics<00:02:00.700> and<00:02:00.759> everything

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
with all the graphics and everything

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:02.849 
with all the graphics and everything
like<00:02:01.210> that<00:02:01.270> so<00:02:01.570> basically<00:02:02.530> I<00:02:02.619> just<00:02:02.770> thought

00:02:02.849 --> 00:02:02.859 
like that so basically I just thought

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:03.569 
like that so basically I just thought
I'd<00:02:02.950> let<00:02:03.039> you<00:02:03.100> know<00:02:03.159> this<00:02:03.310> is<00:02:03.399> what<00:02:03.490> we're

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:03.579 
I'd let you know this is what we're

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:05.550 
I'd let you know this is what we're
going<00:02:03.670> to<00:02:03.729> be<00:02:03.850> doing<00:02:04.030> I'm<00:02:04.750> going<00:02:05.200> to<00:02:05.289> try<00:02:05.439> and

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 
going to be doing I'm going to try and

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.940 
going to be doing I'm going to try and
keep<00:02:05.770> the<00:02:06.189> videos<00:02:06.789> quite<00:02:07.210> short<00:02:07.570> and<00:02:07.960> I'm

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950
