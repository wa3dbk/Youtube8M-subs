 you a tip to use the 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.090
 computer or better to optimize 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:30.150
 computer processor and do with 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.640
 that he earns more has more commitment in 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.770
 day to day for this we use this 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.829
 program that is the jet bush it is 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.980
 totally free and the link away 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.489
 it's in the description when you open it 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.129
 on here 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.020
 the program has the ok punch button that is 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.730
 a default setting and has here the 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.710
 option for you to build I recommend that 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.469
 you stay in can you customize the 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.300
 first and here it is shown by 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.370
 example programs that are in 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.800
 running you can select several that 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.289
 you want and finalize when you 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.030
 click the download button here that the 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.119
 windows services 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.200
 it will also finalize these services 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:09.869
 consequently will release 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.850
 Processing then its processor I 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:15.270
 I recommend that you add it all because 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.710
 are normally essential services but 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.140
 If you send it a little you can 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:22.860
 choose one of these services here for 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.799
 You have to finish as I said this. 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.780
 part that only if you really 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:30.570
 You understand from windows, you do not change much. 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.540
 Do not move, it may give your 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.189
 pc then basically uncheck everything here 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.740
 if you want this option you can 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:39.360
 check here some options do not have 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.360
 No problem, it's up to you. 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:45.210
 criterion and here it is important to 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.990
 marked here the standard that it is placed 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.509
 for you 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.579
 so that's what chooses the processes here 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.939
 you put your really understand and 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:55.590
 here you put you think better and 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:58.110

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.990
 can be ordered and he puts it here 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.969
 Because he thinks it's interesting there too. 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.040
 It's up to you or I've spoken more 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:07.560
 I recommend you leave everything 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:10.410
 disabling the company has done the 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:13.590
 process of selecting you want to go back 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.190
 and now click the fans ready button 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.770
 he 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:19.410
 will do the process of optimizing the 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:23.340
 your processor it will eliminate things 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:25.980
 that consume your pc's processing 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:28.620
 your processor and consequently your 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:31.680
 system will get faster and windows 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.870
 It will get faster 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.450
 a tip before installing this program 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.220
 and testing goes there on the analog system 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:41.160
 control panel of windows and creates a 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:43.680
 restore point and this will help 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.570
 that you install the program and not 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.860
 works the way you want it or not 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:49.380
 gave no status 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.120
 you can restore the system I do not know 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.350
 nor where is the program back to 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.930
 previous point 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:57.210
 and you do not have any headaches 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:00.270
 so I recommend you do this to 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:01.890
 avoid headaches but the problem 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:04.080
 does not work the way they did 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:08.250
 have the result you wanted then you 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:11.400
 back through the restore point if 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:13.530
 do you use windows 8 7 just look it up 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.380
