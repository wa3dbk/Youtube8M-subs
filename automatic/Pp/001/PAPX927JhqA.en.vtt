00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
right into the tutorial so yeah the okay

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.900 
right into the tutorial so yeah the okay
in<00:00:29.279> this<00:00:29.460> one<00:00:29.519> will<00:00:30.510> be<00:00:30.660> doing<00:00:30.990> k<00:00:31.439> collision<00:00:32.189> so

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
in this one will be doing k collision so

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.630 
in this one will be doing k collision so
as<00:00:33.300> always<00:00:33.540> just<00:00:34.079> have<00:00:34.260> this<00:00:34.440> just<00:00:35.370> have<00:00:35.520> this

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
as always just have this just have this

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.170 
as always just have this just have this
basic<00:00:36.210> circle<00:00:36.719> emitter<00:00:37.670> I'll<00:00:38.670> play<00:00:38.969> it<00:00:39.090> for

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
basic circle emitter I'll play it for

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.900 
basic circle emitter I'll play it for
you<00:00:39.300> guys<00:00:39.329> so<00:00:39.660> you<00:00:39.690> can<00:00:39.809> see<00:00:39.930> what<00:00:40.170> happens

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:40.910 
you guys so you can see what happens

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.430 
you guys so you can see what happens
nothing<00:00:41.910> happens<00:00:42.360> just<00:00:42.870> kind<00:00:43.170> of<00:00:43.200> hits<00:00:43.379> the

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
nothing happens just kind of hits the

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.979 
nothing happens just kind of hits the
ground<00:00:43.620> and<00:00:43.890> then<00:00:44.300> through<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.450> loop<00:00:45.480> does

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
ground and then through the loop does

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.090 
ground and then through the loop does
whatever<00:00:46.700> but<00:00:47.700> we<00:00:48.270> will<00:00:48.450> add<00:00:48.690> this<00:00:48.989> demon<00:00:49.860> here

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
whatever but we will add this demon here

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.790 
whatever but we will add this demon here
so<00:00:50.579> we<00:00:51.510> are<00:00:51.539> doing<00:00:51.780> yes<00:00:52.170> so<00:00:52.379> one<00:00:52.559> two<00:00:52.770> three

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
so we are doing yes so one two three

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.549 
so we are doing yes so one two three
four<00:00:53.309> five<00:00:53.699> so<00:00:54.059> it<00:00:54.149> is<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.329> fifth<00:00:54.600> one<00:00:54.870> and<00:00:55.440> it

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
four five so it is the fifth one and it

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.069 
four five so it is the fifth one and it
is<00:00:55.649> called<00:00:55.860> K<00:00:56.070> collision<00:00:56.699> now<00:00:57.210> it<00:00:57.510> is<00:00:57.660> much

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
is called K collision now it is much

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.650 
is called K collision now it is much
like<00:00:58.410> a<00:00:58.649> lot<00:00:58.949> of<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.100> other<00:00:59.250> ones<00:00:59.660> it

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
like a lot of the other ones it

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.110 
like a lot of the other ones it
basically<00:01:01.020> makes<00:01:01.949> it<00:01:02.190> you<00:01:02.699> can<00:01:02.789> either<00:01:02.879> make

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
basically makes it you can either make

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.990 
basically makes it you can either make
them<00:01:03.270> delete<00:01:03.719> or<00:01:03.930> multiply<00:01:04.589> when<00:01:05.189> they<00:01:05.489> in

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
them delete or multiply when they in

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.719 
them delete or multiply when they in
this<00:01:06.180> case<00:01:06.240> hit<00:01:06.750> something<00:01:07.200> so<00:01:08.159> for<00:01:08.580> the

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
this case hit something so for the

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.890 
this case hit something so for the
settings<00:01:09.180> you<00:01:09.869> want<00:01:10.020> to<00:01:10.229> go<00:01:10.409> to<00:01:10.470> all<00:01:11.100> objects

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:11.900 
settings you want to go to all objects

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.859 
settings you want to go to all objects
change<00:01:12.900> that<00:01:13.110> to<00:01:13.350> Oh<00:01:13.740> actually<00:01:14.659> don't<00:01:15.659> make<00:01:15.750> me

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
change that to Oh actually don't make me

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.510 
change that to Oh actually don't make me
how<00:01:15.960> many<00:01:16.020> objects<00:01:16.470> you<00:01:16.560> have<00:01:16.680> so<00:01:16.920> only<00:01:17.220> in<00:01:17.369> the

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
how many objects you have so only in the

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.020 
how many objects you have so only in the
only<00:01:17.880> have<00:01:18.000> one<00:01:18.299> plane<00:01:18.720> object<00:01:19.020> so<00:01:19.920> I'll<00:01:20.580> just

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
only have one plane object so I'll just

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.280 
only have one plane object so I'll just
demonstrate<00:01:21.210> it<00:01:21.570> for<00:01:21.720> you<00:01:21.869> so<00:01:22.020> you<00:01:22.110> got<00:01:22.259> to

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
demonstrate it for you so you got to

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.710 
demonstrate it for you so you got to
select<00:01:22.680> your<00:01:22.890> objects<00:01:23.280> hit<00:01:23.490> plane<00:01:23.790> hit<00:01:24.210> okay

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
select your objects hit plane hit okay

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.950 
select your objects hit plane hit okay
then<00:01:25.850> since<00:01:26.850> I<00:01:27.000> only<00:01:27.119> have<00:01:27.270> one<00:01:27.420> I<00:01:27.450> just<00:01:27.570> had

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
then since I only have one I just had

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.789 
then since I only have one I just had
have<00:01:28.770> all<00:01:29.040> objects<00:01:29.490> ticked<00:01:29.759> so<00:01:30.299> that's<00:01:30.420> fine

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:30.799 
have all objects ticked so that's fine

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:34.010 
have all objects ticked so that's fine
if<00:01:31.799> you<00:01:31.890> want<00:01:32.159> it<00:01:32.250> to<00:01:32.369> delete<00:01:32.700> then<00:01:33.509> just<00:01:33.869> have

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
if you want it to delete then just have

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.440 
if you want it to delete then just have
split<00:01:34.350> set<00:01:34.619> on<00:01:34.740> no<00:01:34.979> then<00:01:35.640> I'll<00:01:35.759> just<00:01:35.939> simulate

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
split set on no then I'll just simulate

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.090 
split set on no then I'll just simulate
this<00:01:36.659> and<00:01:37.310> when<00:01:38.310> it<00:01:38.460> hits<00:01:38.729> that<00:01:39.770> they<00:01:40.770> will

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
this and when it hits that they will

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.100 
this and when it hits that they will
just<00:01:41.340> or<00:01:41.640> delete<00:01:43.250> now<00:01:44.479> that's<00:01:45.479> basically<00:01:45.810> it

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
just or delete now that's basically it

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.380 
just or delete now that's basically it
that's<00:01:46.259> pretty<00:01:46.439> simple<00:01:46.920> but<00:01:47.670> now<00:01:47.850> get<00:01:48.180> onto

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
that's pretty simple but now get onto

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.010 
that's pretty simple but now get onto
the<00:01:49.009> the<00:01:50.009> split<00:01:50.369> part<00:01:50.610> so<00:01:51.450> as<00:01:51.750> you<00:01:51.960> all

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
the the split part so as you all

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.069 
the the split part so as you all
probably<00:01:52.049> know<00:01:52.530> this<00:01:53.100> will<00:01:53.340> make<00:01:53.610> it<00:01:53.970> split<00:01:54.930> so

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
probably know this will make it split so

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.249 
probably know this will make it split so
I'll<00:01:55.320> put<00:01:56.250> it<00:01:56.310> on<00:01:56.399> for<00:01:56.460> your<00:01:57.420> preset<00:01:57.960> and<00:01:58.229> then

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
I'll put it on for your preset and then

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:02.780 
I'll put it on for your preset and then
simulate<00:01:59.570> now<00:02:00.570> you'll<00:02:01.560> see<00:02:01.829> when<00:02:02.130> it<00:02:02.189> hits<00:02:02.549> the

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
simulate now you'll see when it hits the

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:03.730 
simulate now you'll see when it hits the
ground

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
ground

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:09.199 
ground
each<00:02:04.740> particle<00:02:05.280> splits<00:02:06.000> into<00:02:06.360> four<00:02:07.970> now<00:02:08.970> this

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
each particle splits into four now this

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.460 
each particle splits into four now this
could<00:02:09.629> be<00:02:09.810> good<00:02:10.110> for

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.520 

okay<00:02:13.470> so<00:02:13.530> something<00:02:14.280> is<00:02:14.550> I<00:02:15.170> think<00:02:16.170> I<00:02:16.290> need<00:02:16.440> to

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
okay so something is I think I need to

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.010 
okay so something is I think I need to
change<00:02:16.770> my<00:02:16.950> max<00:02:17.700> sub-steps<00:02:18.270> because<00:02:18.660> it's<00:02:18.900> uh

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
change my max sub-steps because it's uh

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.050 
change my max sub-steps because it's uh
it's<00:02:19.770> making<00:02:20.100> things<00:02:20.250> go<00:02:20.490> down<00:02:20.730> here<00:02:20.940> it's

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
it's making things go down here it's

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.280 
it's making things go down here it's
glitching<00:02:21.390> a<00:02:21.480> bit<00:02:22.580> but<00:02:23.580> as<00:02:24.390> you<00:02:24.630> can<00:02:24.750> see<00:02:24.810> I

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
glitching a bit but as you can see I

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.430 
glitching a bit but as you can see I
might<00:02:25.650> actually<00:02:25.890> put<00:02:26.370> it<00:02:26.490> on<00:02:27.080> I'll<00:02:28.080> just<00:02:28.260> put

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
might actually put it on I'll just put

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.490 
might actually put it on I'll just put
it<00:02:28.530> on<00:02:28.590> -<00:02:28.890> because<00:02:29.220> I<00:02:29.370> don't<00:02:29.430> know<00:02:29.610> -<00:02:29.670> before

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
it on - because I don't know - before

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.230 
it on - because I don't know - before
and<00:02:31.500> that<00:02:31.680> kind<00:02:31.950> of<00:02:32.010> gave<00:02:32.160> a<00:02:32.190> bit<00:02:32.490> of<00:02:32.580> a<00:02:32.670> better

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
and that kind of gave a bit of a better

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.600 
and that kind of gave a bit of a better
result<00:02:33.600> but<00:02:34.290> you<00:02:34.320> could<00:02:34.590> have<00:02:34.740> this<00:02:34.890> for<00:02:34.950> maybe

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
result but you could have this for maybe

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.950 
result but you could have this for maybe
popcorn<00:02:36.510> or<00:02:36.690> something<00:02:37.280> or<00:02:38.960> actually

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960 
popcorn or something or actually

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:44.030 
popcorn or something or actually
probably<00:02:40.290> is<00:02:40.590> cage<00:02:40.890> for<00:02:41.310> popcorn<00:02:41.520> but<00:02:43.040> yeah

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
probably is cage for popcorn but yeah

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.220 
probably is cage for popcorn but yeah
you<00:02:44.100> can<00:02:44.340> see<00:02:44.520> here<00:02:44.820> so<00:02:45.030> each<00:02:45.540> particle<00:02:45.990> that

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
you can see here so each particle that

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.890 
you can see here so each particle that
when<00:02:46.410> it<00:02:46.530> hits<00:02:46.740> it<00:02:47.340> makes<00:02:47.760> to<00:02:48.030> have<00:02:48.660> each<00:02:48.870> one

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
when it hits it makes to have each one

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.260 
when it hits it makes to have each one
that<00:02:49.320> becomes<00:02:49.830> two<00:02:50.130> of<00:02:50.220> that<00:02:50.430> makes<00:02:50.820> two<00:02:51.060> when

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
that becomes two of that makes two when

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.150 
that becomes two of that makes two when
it<00:02:51.390> hits<00:02:51.570> the<00:02:51.750> ground<00:02:51.780> so<00:02:52.170> you<00:02:52.770> basically<00:02:52.950> just

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:53.160 
it hits the ground so you basically just

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.840 
it hits the ground so you basically just
have<00:02:53.460> kind<00:02:53.610> of<00:02:53.730> infinite<00:02:54.210> particles<00:02:54.800> so<00:02:55.850> yeah

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
have kind of infinite particles so yeah

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:01.880 
have kind of infinite particles so yeah
I<00:02:56.880> guess<00:02:57.300> that's<00:02:58.190> just<00:02:59.190> a<00:02:59.790> nice<00:03:00.150> kind<00:03:00.570> of<00:03:00.890> thing

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
I guess that's just a nice kind of thing

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.910 
I guess that's just a nice kind of thing
to<00:03:02.100> have<00:03:02.250> there<00:03:02.520> to<00:03:02.910> have<00:03:03.060> there<00:03:03.240> going<00:03:03.510> on<00:03:03.690> uh

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
to have there to have there going on uh

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.400 
to have there to have there going on uh
can't<00:03:04.920> really<00:03:04.950> see<00:03:05.280> any<00:03:05.570> use<00:03:06.570> for<00:03:06.600> this<00:03:07.050> I

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
can't really see any use for this I

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:10.490 
can't really see any use for this I
guess<00:03:07.830> at<00:03:08.070> the<00:03:08.160> moment<00:03:08.540> I<00:03:09.540> guess<00:03:10.110> you<00:03:10.320> were

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
guess at the moment I guess you were

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.080 
guess at the moment I guess you were
using<00:03:10.680> the<00:03:10.860> delete<00:03:11.160> thing<00:03:11.400> or<00:03:11.550> maybe<00:03:11.730> foam

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
using the delete thing or maybe foam

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.250 
using the delete thing or maybe foam
again<00:03:13.340> something<00:03:14.340> like<00:03:14.460> that<00:03:14.700> you<00:03:15.000> could<00:03:15.260> have

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
again something like that you could have

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.270 
again something like that you could have
something<00:03:16.680> on<00:03:16.770> those<00:03:17.550> lines<00:03:17.940> I<00:03:18.780> guess<00:03:19.020> but<00:03:19.800> you

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
something on those lines I guess but you

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.700 
something on those lines I guess but you
are<00:03:20.730> gonna<00:03:20.850> have<00:03:20.940> infinite<00:03:21.480> particles<00:03:21.930> unless

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:22.710 
are gonna have infinite particles unless

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:27.830 
are gonna have infinite particles unless
you<00:03:22.860> just<00:03:23.070> chuck<00:03:23.340> a<00:03:23.370> keyframe<00:03:24.200> here<00:03:25.200> so<00:03:25.680> you<00:03:26.840> so

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
you just chuck a keyframe here so you so

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.070 
you just chuck a keyframe here so you so
you<00:03:27.930> notice<00:03:28.200> here<00:03:28.470> if<00:03:28.740> I<00:03:28.920> just<00:03:29.660> so<00:03:30.660> if<00:03:30.750> I<00:03:30.840> go<00:03:31.020> to

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
you notice here if I just so if I go to

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:37.310 
you notice here if I just so if I go to
here<00:03:31.260> then<00:03:32.160> let's<00:03:32.700> go<00:03:33.480> to<00:03:33.540> split<00:03:35.090> add<00:03:36.090> key<00:03:36.540> then

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:37.320 
here then let's go to split add key then

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.700 
here then let's go to split add key then
I<00:03:37.350> go<00:03:37.590> ahead<00:03:38.100> a<00:03:38.130> few<00:03:38.250> frames<00:03:38.930> turn<00:03:39.930> that<00:03:40.080> off

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:40.710 
I go ahead a few frames turn that off

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:44.450 
I go ahead a few frames turn that off
hit<00:03:41.430> add<00:03:41.640> key<00:03:42.110> if<00:03:43.110> I<00:03:43.290> go<00:03:43.500> back<00:03:43.680> to<00:03:43.800> here<00:03:44.070> and<00:03:44.160> hit

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:44.460 
hit add key if I go back to here and hit

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:50.540 
hit add key if I go back to here and hit
simulate<00:03:45.410> you'll<00:03:46.410> see<00:03:46.740> that<00:03:47.600> it<00:03:49.550> stops

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:50.550 
simulate you'll see that it stops

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:53.810 
simulate you'll see that it stops
