super buu Broly to a few fighters I'm

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:40.490 
super buu Broly to a few fighters I'm
going<00:03:39.340> to<00:03:39.400> compare<00:03:39.700> him<00:03:39.910> to<00:03:40.060> their<00:03:40.210> level

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
going to compare him to their level

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.740 
going to compare him to their level
because<00:03:41.500> this<00:03:41.650> is<00:03:41.830> how<00:03:41.980> strong<00:03:42.340> I<00:03:42.760> think<00:03:43.330> this

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
because this is how strong I think this

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:45.660 
because this is how strong I think this
is<00:03:43.930> my<00:03:44.080> personal<00:03:44.380> opinion<00:03:44.650> this<00:03:45.400> is<00:03:45.460> how

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 
is my personal opinion this is how

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:48.690 
is my personal opinion this is how
strong<00:03:45.970> I<00:03:46.150> think<00:03:46.480> super<00:03:46.930> buu<00:03:47.140> Broly<00:03:47.500> is<00:03:47.770> this

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
strong I think super buu Broly is this

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.370 
strong I think super buu Broly is this
is<00:03:48.820> how<00:03:48.910> strong<00:03:49.120> I<00:03:49.330> think<00:03:49.540> he<00:03:49.660> would<00:03:49.840> be<00:03:50.020> if<00:03:50.230> he

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380 
is how strong I think he would be if he

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:52.710 
is how strong I think he would be if he
absorbed<00:03:50.860> Broly<00:03:51.130> if<00:03:51.730> he<00:03:52.030> absorbs<00:03:52.450> super

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720

saiyan<00:03:52.930> 3<00:03:53.020> broadly<00:03:53.500> this<00:03:53.620> how<00:03:53.770> strong<00:03:54.040> I<00:03:54.160> think

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370 
saiyan 3 broadly this how strong I think

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:57.540 
saiyan 3 broadly this how strong I think
he<00:03:54.460> would<00:03:54.610> be<00:03:55.290> super<00:03:56.290> buu<00:03:56.470> broly<00:03:56.800> would

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:57.550 
he would be super buu broly would

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:00.530 
he would be super buu broly would
probably<00:03:58.000> be<00:03:58.180> around<00:03:58.480> super<00:03:59.260> buu<00:03:59.440> tanks<00:03:59.860> level

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
probably be around super buu tanks level

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.840 
probably be around super buu tanks level
but<00:04:01.540> the<00:04:01.750> difference<00:04:02.170> is<00:04:02.320> that<00:04:02.460> super<00:04:03.460> buu

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:03.850 
but the difference is that super buu

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:08.070 
but the difference is that super buu
tanks<00:04:04.390> absorb<00:04:04.870> go<00:04:05.290> tannin<00:04:05.830> and<00:04:05.920> trunks<00:04:07.080> and

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:08.080 
tanks absorb go tannin and trunks and

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.590 
tanks absorb go tannin and trunks and
they<00:04:08.140> did<00:04:08.350> fusion<00:04:08.800> together<00:04:09.160> so<00:04:09.700> I<00:04:09.730> say<00:04:10.090> super

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:10.600 
they did fusion together so I say super

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.080 
they did fusion together so I say super
buu<00:04:10.840> broly<00:04:11.650> would<00:04:12.010> probably<00:04:12.430> be<00:04:12.580> underneath

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.090 
buu broly would probably be underneath

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:15.540 
buu broly would probably be underneath
super<00:04:13.690> buu<00:04:13.840> tanks<00:04:14.290> he<00:04:14.830> would<00:04:14.980> be<00:04:15.100> underneath

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:15.550 
super buu tanks he would be underneath

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:19.979 
super buu tanks he would be underneath
them<00:04:15.790> I<00:04:16.030> say<00:04:17.549> super<00:04:18.549> buu<00:04:18.760> on<00:04:19.030> tanks<00:04:19.600> were<00:04:19.750> had

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989 
them I say super buu on tanks were had

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:23.580 
them I say super buu on tanks were had
hat<00:04:20.290> we<00:04:20.590> had<00:04:20.799> the<00:04:21.220> advantage<00:04:22.180> super<00:04:23.170> bootlegs

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590 
hat we had the advantage super bootlegs

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.310 
hat we had the advantage super bootlegs
did<00:04:23.860> win<00:04:24.070> again<00:04:24.340> tom<00:04:24.640> Super<00:04:25.360> Saiyan<00:04:25.600> 3<00:04:25.690> Goku

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320 
did win again tom Super Saiyan 3 Goku

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.440 
did win again tom Super Saiyan 3 Goku
and<00:04:26.530> super<00:04:27.100> saiyan<00:04:27.310> 3<00:04:27.370> Goku<00:04:27.880> was<00:04:28.060> pretty<00:04:28.300> much

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:28.450 
and super saiyan 3 Goku was pretty much

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:30.030 
and super saiyan 3 Goku was pretty much
getting<00:04:28.660> his<00:04:28.840> ass<00:04:29.020> kicked<00:04:29.050> by<00:04:29.470> super<00:04:29.890> buu

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:30.040 
getting his ass kicked by super buu

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:33.000 
getting his ass kicked by super buu
tanks<00:04:30.490> and<00:04:31.000> you<00:04:31.390> guys<00:04:31.630> seen<00:04:32.020> that<00:04:32.260> you<00:04:32.770> got

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.010 
tanks and you guys seen that you got

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:37.260 
tanks and you guys seen that you got
seen<00:04:33.400> it<00:04:33.960> so<00:04:34.960> I<00:04:35.020> think<00:04:35.080> on<00:04:35.560> super<00:04:36.400> buu<00:04:36.730> tanks

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
seen it so I think on super buu tanks

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:39.540 
seen it so I think on super buu tanks
were<00:04:38.050> pretty<00:04:38.320> much<00:04:38.440> had<00:04:38.620> the<00:04:38.740> upper<00:04:38.890> hand<00:04:39.010> on

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:39.550 
were pretty much had the upper hand on

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:42.420 
were pretty much had the upper hand on
super<00:04:40.540> buu<00:04:40.690> broadly<00:04:41.110> that's<00:04:41.410> what<00:04:41.590> I<00:04:41.620> think<00:04:42.130> so

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 
super buu broadly that's what I think so

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:45.750 
super buu broadly that's what I think so
that's<00:04:42.669> how<00:04:42.790> powerful<00:04:43.030> I<00:04:43.330> think<00:04:43.950> super<00:04:44.950> buu

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:45.760 
that's how powerful I think super buu

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.760 
that's how powerful I think super buu
Broly<00:04:46.120> would<00:04:46.450> probably<00:04:46.900> be<00:04:47.080> he<00:04:47.380> will<00:04:47.530> probably

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:47.770 
Broly would probably be he will probably

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:49.810 
Broly would probably be he will probably
be<00:04:48.100> around<00:04:48.130> super<00:04:49.120> boo

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:49.820 
be around super boo

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:52.420 
be around super boo
tanks<00:04:50.600> level<00:04:51.020> but<00:04:51.380> maybe<00:04:51.860> a<00:04:51.980> little<00:04:52.190> bit

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:52.430 
tanks level but maybe a little bit

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:56.650 
tanks level but maybe a little bit
weaker<00:04:54.640> the<00:04:55.640> second<00:04:56.060> fighter<00:04:56.270> aren't<00:04:56.510> going

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:56.660 
weaker the second fighter aren't going

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:59.440 
weaker the second fighter aren't going
to<00:04:56.720> compare<00:04:57.110> super<00:04:57.830> buu<00:04:58.010> broly<00:04:58.310> to<00:04:58.640> is<00:04:58.910> super

00:04:59.440 --> 00:04:59.450 
to compare super buu broly to is super

to compare super buu broly to is super
buu<00:04:59.600> Gohan<00:05:00.190> he<00:05:01.190> would<00:05:01.640> probably<00:05:02.090> be<00:05:02.240> around

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:02.510 
buu Gohan he would probably be around

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:06.070 
buu Gohan he would probably be around
Gohan's<00:05:03.050> level<00:05:03.560> I<00:05:03.850> say<00:05:04.850> probably<00:05:05.480> because

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:06.080 
Gohan's level I say probably because

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:08.250 
Gohan's level I say probably because
Gohan<00:05:06.470> is<00:05:06.710> stronger<00:05:07.160> than<00:05:07.310> a<00:05:07.430> Super<00:05:07.790> Saiyan<00:05:07.820> 3

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:08.260 
Gohan is stronger than a Super Saiyan 3

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:12.850 
Gohan is stronger than a Super Saiyan 3
but<00:05:09.260> I<00:05:09.370> think<00:05:10.370> that<00:05:10.670> super<00:05:11.360> buu<00:05:11.900> Gohan<00:05:12.470> would

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:12.860 
but I think that super buu Gohan would

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:16.540 
but I think that super buu Gohan would
own<00:05:13.100> the<00:05:13.400> shit<00:05:13.610> out<00:05:13.730> super<00:05:14.150> boulogne<00:05:15.550> will

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:16.550 
own the shit out super boulogne will

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:18.580 
own the shit out super boulogne will
only<00:05:16.700> shout<00:05:17.000> out<00:05:17.060> of<00:05:17.180> super<00:05:17.510> buu<00:05:17.660> Broly<00:05:17.930> that<00:05:18.470> I

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:18.590 
only shout out of super buu Broly that I

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:23.020 
only shout out of super buu Broly that I
remember<00:05:19.160> when<00:05:19.970> super<00:05:20.510> buu<00:05:21.640> absorbed<00:05:22.640> Gohan

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:23.030 
remember when super buu absorbed Gohan

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:26.110 
remember when super buu absorbed Gohan
when<00:05:23.480> he<00:05:23.660> is<00:05:23.780> all<00:05:23.990> going<00:05:24.230> on<00:05:24.730> cuz<00:05:25.730> you<00:05:25.910> guys
