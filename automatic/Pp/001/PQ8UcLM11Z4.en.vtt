hey<00:00:01.050> guys<00:00:01.260> now<00:00:01.620> we're<00:00:01.829> going<00:00:02.100> to<00:00:02.250> propagate

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:02.810 
hey guys now we're going to propagate

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:06.680 
hey guys now we're going to propagate
some<00:00:03.810> Blitzer<00:00:04.259> japonica<00:00:05.089> this<00:00:06.089> is<00:00:06.270> blitz<00:00:06.540> it

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
some Blitzer japonica this is blitz it

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.850 
some Blitzer japonica this is blitz it
upon<00:00:06.930> oka<00:00:07.200> it's<00:00:07.379> a<00:00:07.470> really<00:00:08.210> nice<00:00:09.740> ground<00:00:10.740> cover

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
upon oka it's a really nice ground cover

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.549 
upon oka it's a really nice ground cover
mid<00:00:11.490> ground<00:00:11.700> on<00:00:11.940> smaller<00:00:12.269> tanks<00:00:12.750> type<00:00:13.019> grassy

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
mid ground on smaller tanks type grassy

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.910 
mid ground on smaller tanks type grassy
plant<00:00:14.179> I<00:00:15.179> guess<00:00:16.170> it<00:00:16.320> comes<00:00:16.470> from<00:00:16.560> Japan

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
plant I guess it comes from Japan

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.380 
plant I guess it comes from Japan
obviously<00:00:17.220> because<00:00:17.670> it's<00:00:17.760> called<00:00:17.940> japonica

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
obviously because it's called japonica

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.450 
obviously because it's called japonica
but<00:00:18.930> these<00:00:19.350> are<00:00:19.800> a<00:00:19.830> little<00:00:19.949> bit<00:00:20.039> different

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
but these are a little bit different

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.939 
but these are a little bit different
because<00:00:20.550> the<00:00:20.850> runners<00:00:21.180> on<00:00:21.330> these<00:00:21.480> grow<00:00:21.960> like

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
because the runners on these grow like

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.189 
because the runners on these grow like
almost<00:00:23.369> on<00:00:23.550> top<00:00:23.760> of<00:00:23.820> each<00:00:24.060> other<00:00:24.180> rather<00:00:25.019> than

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
almost on top of each other rather than

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.130 
almost on top of each other rather than
and<00:00:25.740> like<00:00:25.859> sending<00:00:26.220> stems<00:00:26.760> out<00:00:27.000> so<00:00:27.990> if<00:00:28.080> you

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
and like sending stems out so if you

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.509 
and like sending stems out so if you
look<00:00:28.289> at<00:00:28.380> this<00:00:28.470> thing<00:00:28.710> see<00:00:29.099> this<00:00:29.250> is<00:00:29.369> actually

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
look at this thing see this is actually

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.110 
look at this thing see this is actually
if<00:00:29.880> one<00:00:30.090> plant<00:00:30.390> that<00:00:30.720> has<00:00:31.710> sent<00:00:32.340> two<00:00:32.550> it's<00:00:33.000> got

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
if one plant that has sent two it's got

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.240 
if one plant that has sent two it's got
two<00:00:33.329> runners<00:00:33.570> like<00:00:33.840> that<00:00:34.079> and<00:00:36.410> and<00:00:37.410> each<00:00:37.980> one's

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
two runners like that and and each one's

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.950 
two runners like that and and each one's
got<00:00:38.430> roots<00:00:38.790> on<00:00:39.000> it<00:00:39.030> this<00:00:39.300> so<00:00:39.450> as<00:00:39.540> long<00:00:39.660> as<00:00:39.840> it's

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
got roots on it this so as long as it's

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.660 
got roots on it this so as long as it's
got<00:00:40.020> roots<00:00:40.320> on<00:00:40.469> it<00:00:40.590> you<00:00:40.680> can<00:00:40.829> separate<00:00:41.309> it<00:00:41.370> so

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
got roots on it you can separate it so

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.520 
got roots on it you can separate it so
I'm<00:00:42.239> just<00:00:42.329> gonna<00:00:42.420> pull<00:00:42.690> it<00:00:42.780> apart<00:00:42.870> there<00:00:43.290> it

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
I'm just gonna pull it apart there it

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.279 
I'm just gonna pull it apart there it
comes<00:00:43.739> apart<00:00:44.010> really<00:00:44.160> easily<00:00:44.309> and<00:00:44.789> then<00:00:45.289> see

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
comes apart really easily and then see

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.880 
comes apart really easily and then see
this<00:00:46.469> one<00:00:46.739> can<00:00:47.190> even<00:00:47.460> be<00:00:47.579> separated<00:00:48.090> again<00:00:48.890> it

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
this one can even be separated again it

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.709 
this one can even be separated again it
just<00:00:49.950> depends<00:00:50.340> on<00:00:50.370> how<00:00:50.430> you<00:00:50.940> know<00:00:51.030> how<00:00:51.420> much

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
just depends on how you know how much

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.660 
just depends on how you know how much
you<00:00:51.870> want<00:00:52.020> to<00:00:52.079> separate<00:00:52.410> yours<00:00:52.620> but<00:00:52.949> this<00:00:53.489> one

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
you want to separate yours but this one

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:54.860 
you want to separate yours but this one
can<00:00:53.789> be<00:00:53.820> separated<00:00:54.300> cuz<00:00:54.449> you<00:00:54.539> see<00:00:54.690> there's

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
can be separated cuz you see there's

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.330 
can be separated cuz you see there's
another<00:00:55.079> branch<00:00:55.410> right<00:00:55.680> here<00:00:55.920> and<00:00:56.100> it's<00:00:56.190> got

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
another branch right here and it's got

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.979 
another branch right here and it's got
roots<00:00:56.670> on<00:00:56.850> it<00:00:57.000> so<00:00:57.180> we'll<00:00:57.329> just<00:00:57.360> pull<00:00:57.690> that<00:00:57.719> one

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
roots on it so we'll just pull that one

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.599 
roots on it so we'll just pull that one
off<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.579> see<00:00:59.579> now<00:00:59.760> you've<00:00:59.910> got<00:01:01.160> two<00:01:02.160> plants

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
off and see now you've got two plants

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.170 
off and see now you've got two plants
there<00:01:02.850> and<00:01:03.180> then<00:01:03.329> this<00:01:03.539> one<00:01:03.750> is<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:05.640> same<00:01:05.850> deal

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
there and then this one is the same deal

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.960 
there and then this one is the same deal
if<00:01:06.450> you<00:01:06.600> look<00:01:06.780> really<00:01:06.960> close<00:01:07.260> there's<00:01:07.970> you

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
if you look really close there's you

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.130 
if you look really close there's you
know<00:01:09.030> there's<00:01:09.210> roots<00:01:09.450> on<00:01:09.659> each<00:01:09.780> one<00:01:09.960> of<00:01:10.049> these

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
know there's roots on each one of these

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.380 
know there's roots on each one of these
and<00:01:10.590> you<00:01:10.650> just<00:01:10.799> pull<00:01:11.010> it<00:01:11.189> and<00:01:11.400> it<00:01:11.909> doesn't<00:01:12.090> take

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
and you just pull it and it doesn't take

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.020 
and you just pull it and it doesn't take
much<00:01:12.600> force<00:01:12.990> it<00:01:13.170> just<00:01:13.430> breaks<00:01:14.430> just<00:01:14.640> like<00:01:14.790> that

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
much force it just breaks just like that

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.080 
much force it just breaks just like that
and<00:01:15.270> then<00:01:15.450> that's<00:01:15.869> that<00:01:16.110> so<00:01:16.350> now<00:01:16.650> you've<00:01:16.830> got

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
and then that's that so now you've got

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.190 
and then that's that so now you've got
you<00:01:18.090> know<00:01:18.180> that<00:01:18.360> just<00:01:18.540> turned<00:01:18.750> two<00:01:18.900> plants

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
you know that just turned two plants

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.230 
you know that just turned two plants
into<00:01:19.680> four<00:01:19.979> plants<00:01:20.400> just<00:01:20.549> like<00:01:20.670> that<00:01:21.000> and<00:01:21.180> this

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
into four plants just like that and this

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.700 
into four plants just like that and this
one<00:01:21.450> look<00:01:21.750> at<00:01:21.840> this<00:01:21.960> one<00:01:22.140> can<00:01:22.290> actually<00:01:22.320> be

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
one look at this one can actually be

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.770 
one look at this one can actually be
divided<00:01:23.070> again<00:01:23.280> it<00:01:23.369> also<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:24.299> there<00:01:25.290> you<00:01:25.380> go

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
divided again it also and there you go

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.359 
divided again it also and there you go
we<00:01:27.780> don't<00:01:27.900> break<00:01:28.140> them<00:01:28.320> down<00:01:28.350> like<00:01:28.740> that<00:01:28.979> when

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
we don't break them down like that when

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.370 
we don't break them down like that when
we<00:01:29.460> sell<00:01:29.700> them<00:01:29.850> we<00:01:29.909> just<00:01:30.210> sell<00:01:30.450> them<00:01:30.630> as<00:01:30.840> like

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
we sell them we just sell them as like

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.330 
we sell them we just sell them as like
the<00:01:31.500> way<00:01:31.590> you<00:01:31.650> saw<00:01:31.860> him<00:01:31.950> before<00:01:32.070> I<00:01:32.250> started

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
the way you saw him before I started

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.340 
the way you saw him before I started
messing<00:01:32.820> with<00:01:32.850> them<00:01:33.030> because<00:01:33.150> we<00:01:34.110> like<00:01:34.229> to

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
messing with them because we like to

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.929 
messing with them because we like to
sell<00:01:34.530> them<00:01:34.650> large<00:01:35.100> enough<00:01:35.400> to<00:01:35.490> where<00:01:35.640> you<00:01:35.759> can

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
sell them large enough to where you can

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.390 
sell them large enough to where you can
break<00:01:36.240> them<00:01:36.360> up<00:01:36.509> yourselves<00:01:37.070> and<00:01:38.070> we<00:01:38.250> don't

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
break them up yourselves and we don't

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.710 
break them up yourselves and we don't
like<00:01:38.490> mess<00:01:38.670> them<00:01:38.850> with<00:01:39.000> them<00:01:39.180> because<00:01:39.329> you

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
like mess them with them because you

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.010 
like mess them with them because you
know<00:01:41.150> small<00:01:42.150> you<00:01:42.329> may<00:01:42.450> come<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.750> harder<00:01:42.990> they

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
know small you may come the harder they

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.139 
know small you may come the harder they
are<00:01:43.140> to<00:01:43.259> get<00:01:43.500> you<00:01:44.009> know<00:01:44.159> to<00:01:44.189> get<00:01:44.490> a<00:01:44.520> position<00:01:44.759> in

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
are to get you know to get a position in
