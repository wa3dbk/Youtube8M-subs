00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.650 
buck so I think a lot of these guys will
take<00:04:08.680> this<00:04:08.860> seriously<00:04:09.400> the<00:04:09.940> problem<00:04:10.330> is<00:04:10.450> the

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:10.660 
take this seriously the problem is the

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:12.060

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.260 
year and let's say this is a horrendous
year<00:04:35.110> when<00:04:35.290> it<00:04:35.380> comes<00:04:35.590> to<00:04:35.800> finding<00:04:36.700> a<00:04:36.820> lot<00:04:37.090> of

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
year when it comes to finding a lot of

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:39.390

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:42.250 
pay-per-views can you do you believe the

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:44.790 
pay-per-views can you do you believe the
UFC<00:04:42.550> is<00:04:42.580> going<00:04:43.450> to<00:04:43.540> be<00:04:43.660> able<00:04:43.870> to<00:04:44.230> stomach<00:04:44.530> all

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:44.800 
UFC is going to be able to stomach all

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.890 
UFC is going to be able to stomach all
of<00:04:44.950> this<00:04:45.160> and<00:04:45.340> because<00:04:46.030> this<00:04:46.150> could<00:04:46.360> lead<00:04:46.660> to

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:46.900 
of this and because this could lead to

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.290 
of this and because this could lead to
some<00:04:47.080> pretty<00:04:47.320> horrendous<00:04:48.030> realities<00:04:49.030> for<00:04:49.210> the

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:49.300 
some pretty horrendous realities for the

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.720 
some pretty horrendous realities for the
UFC<00:04:49.780> if<00:04:49.990> they're<00:04:50.500> testing<00:04:51.250> all<00:04:51.370> these<00:04:51.520> main

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:51.730 
UFC if they're testing all these main

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:53.430 
UFC if they're testing all these main
eventers<00:04:52.180> and<00:04:52.390> they're<00:04:52.780> all<00:04:52.870> popping<00:04:53.290> hot

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:53.440 
eventers and they're all popping hot

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.800 
eventers and they're all popping hot
yeah<00:04:53.860> I<00:04:53.890> think<00:04:54.220> it<00:04:54.310> just<00:04:54.430> comes<00:04:54.610> down<00:04:54.790> to<00:04:54.970> what

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:55.810 
yeah I think it just comes down to what

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:58.020 
yeah I think it just comes down to what
happens<00:04:56.290> over<00:04:56.650> the<00:04:56.770> next<00:04:57.130> number<00:04:57.730> of<00:04:57.910> months

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:58.030 
happens over the next number of months

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:00.300 
happens over the next number of months
if<00:04:58.570> a<00:04:58.990> lot<00:04:59.140> of<00:04:59.290> people<00:04:59.410> start<00:04:59.800> getting<00:04:59.920> dinged

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:00.310 
if a lot of people start getting dinged

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:02.420 
if a lot of people start getting dinged
for<00:05:00.640> things<00:05:00.850> i<00:05:01.090> think<00:05:01.420> the<00:05:01.510> UFC<00:05:01.870> might

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:02.430 
for things i think the UFC might

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:04.470 
for things i think the UFC might
re-examine<00:05:03.430> how<00:05:03.580> they're<00:05:03.820> they're<00:05:04.180> dealing

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:04.480 
re-examine how they're they're dealing

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:06.480 
re-examine how they're they're dealing
with<00:05:04.510> this<00:05:04.690> entire<00:05:04.990> situation<00:05:05.260> and<00:05:05.800> the<00:05:06.250> focus

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:06.490 
with this entire situation and the focus

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:08.220 
with this entire situation and the focus
of<00:05:06.790> performance-enhancing<00:05:07.420> drugs<00:05:08.020> and

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:08.230 
of performance-enhancing drugs and

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:09.900 
of performance-enhancing drugs and
out-of-competition<00:05:08.710> drug<00:05:09.160> testing<00:05:09.790> has

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:09.910 
out-of-competition drug testing has

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:11.510 
out-of-competition drug testing has
largely<00:05:10.240> centered<00:05:10.630> on<00:05:10.870> the<00:05:10.900> world's<00:05:11.230> largest

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520 
largely centered on the world's largest

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:14.280 
largely centered on the world's largest

about their own commission testing and

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:19.830 
about their own commission testing and

weather testing fighters on fight night

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.720 
weather testing fighters on fight night
is<00:05:19.990> enough<00:05:20.410> when<00:05:20.920> fighters<00:05:21.280> are<00:05:21.400> aware<00:05:21.670> of

is enough when fighters are aware of

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:24.270 
is enough when fighters are aware of
when<00:05:21.970> they<00:05:22.120> are<00:05:22.180> going<00:05:22.420> to<00:05:22.510> be<00:05:22.600> tested<00:05:23.280> not
