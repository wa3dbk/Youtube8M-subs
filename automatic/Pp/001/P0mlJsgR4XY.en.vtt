00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
go for quite an asymmetric look but

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.940 
go for quite an asymmetric look but
quickly<00:00:59.880> decided<00:01:00.690> that<00:01:00.989> I<00:01:01.079> didn't<00:01:01.530> like<00:01:01.680> the

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:01.950 
quickly decided that I didn't like the

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:06.319 
quickly decided that I didn't like the
look<00:01:02.130> of<00:01:02.280> it<00:01:02.460> so<00:01:03.090> I<00:01:03.120> went<00:01:03.300> back<00:01:03.570> to<00:01:03.630> a<00:01:05.329> more

00:01:06.319 --> 00:01:06.329 
look of it so I went back to a more

00:01:06.329 --> 00:01:12.080 
look of it so I went back to a more
formal<00:01:06.710> mask<00:01:10.189> once<00:01:11.189> you<00:01:11.369> have<00:01:11.520> completed<00:01:11.969> your

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
formal mask once you have completed your

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.989 
formal mask once you have completed your
outline<00:01:12.719> you<00:01:13.139> can<00:01:13.380> fill<00:01:13.889> in<00:01:14.039> that<00:01:14.340> area<00:01:14.759> and

outline you can fill in that area and
make<00:01:15.229> sure<00:01:16.229> that<00:01:16.350> this<00:01:16.499> goes<00:01:16.770> all<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.219> way

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369
