00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:25.020 
this one this is going to be about a

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:27.950

have and most of these ideas will

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.720 
have and most of these ideas will
potentially<00:00:30.510> a<00:00:30.870> most<00:00:31.260> likely<00:00:31.770> be<00:00:31.920> integrated

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
potentially a most likely be integrated

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.700 
potentially a most likely be integrated
into<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.420> game<00:00:33.629> which<00:00:33.899> is<00:00:33.930> a<00:00:34.050> really<00:00:34.469> cool

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
into the game which is a really cool

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
of people think this is actually just

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.919 
of people think this is actually just
something<00:01:23.520> integrated<00:01:24.090> into<00:01:24.389> the<00:01:24.509> game<00:01:24.689> no

00:01:24.919 --> 00:01:24.929 
something integrated into the game no

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:27.080 
something integrated into the game no
it's<00:01:25.109> not<00:01:25.289> guys<00:01:25.529> it's<00:01:25.859> a<00:01:26.189> glitch<00:01:26.459> and<00:01:26.670> everyone

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
it's not guys it's a glitch and everyone

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.359 
it's not guys it's a glitch and everyone
needs<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.359> make<00:01:27.600> sure<00:01:27.810> of<00:01:27.929> that<00:01:27.990> because

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:28.369 
needs to make sure of that because

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:31.010 
needs to make sure of that because
anything<00:01:29.369> this<00:01:29.579> overpower<00:01:30.209> that's<00:01:30.569> basically

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
anything this overpower that's basically

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.039 
anything this overpower that's basically
a<00:01:31.139> one-hit<00:01:31.740> knife<00:01:31.979> up<00:01:32.279> to<00:01:32.459> like<00:01:32.639> round<00:01:32.939> 60<00:01:33.539> is<00:01:33.719> a

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
a one-hit knife up to like round 60 is a

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.660 
a one-hit knife up to like round 60 is a
must<00:01:34.409> be<00:01:34.619> a<00:01:34.649> glitch<00:01:34.950> they<00:01:35.189> wouldn't<00:01:35.490> and

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
must be a glitch they wouldn't and

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.519 
must be a glitch they wouldn't and
purposefully<00:01:36.450> integrate<00:01:36.959> that<00:01:37.109> because

00:01:37.519 --> 00:01:37.529 
purposefully integrate that because

00:01:37.529 --> 00:01:39.649 
purposefully integrate that because
that's<00:01:37.979> way<00:01:38.219> too<00:01:38.279> overpowered<00:01:39.029> and<00:01:39.209> it's<00:01:39.359> very

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
that's way too overpowered and it's very

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.539 
that's way too overpowered and it's very
vague<00:01:39.869> game<00:01:40.170> breaking<00:01:40.469> so<00:01:40.829> that<00:01:41.039> is<00:01:41.189> literally

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
vague game breaking so that is literally

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.639 
vague game breaking so that is literally
the<00:01:41.670> only<00:01:41.909> fact<00:01:42.270> I<00:01:42.509> need<00:01:42.689> to<00:01:42.810> tell<00:01:43.020> you<00:01:43.049> to

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
basically say that this is a glitch but

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.870 
basically say that this is a glitch but
anyways<00:01:46.380> enough<00:01:46.979> about<00:01:47.069> the<00:01:47.310> gameplay<00:01:47.549> and

black<00:01:50.609> ops<00:01:50.880> 1<00:01:50.999> there<00:01:51.630> really<00:01:52.049> wasn't<00:01:52.319> too<00:01:52.679> much

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:52.919 
black ops 1 there really wasn't too much

00:01:52.919 --> 00:01:54.949 
black ops 1 there really wasn't too much
melee<00:01:53.399> integration<00:01:54.090> yeah<00:01:54.299> we<00:01:54.479> got<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.659> bowie

00:01:54.949 --> 00:01:54.959 
melee integration yeah we got the bowie

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
knife and the sickle but that was about

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.389 
knife and the sickle but that was about
it<00:01:57.240> when<00:01:57.659> it<00:01:57.779> came<00:01:58.020> to<00:01:58.229> melee<00:01:58.619> in<00:01:58.770> black<00:01:59.039> ops<00:01:59.249> 2

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
it when it came to melee in black ops 2

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.489 
it when it came to melee in black ops 2
they<00:01:59.700> did<00:01:59.969> up<00:02:00.179> the<00:02:00.419> standards<00:02:00.990> they<00:02:01.169> added

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:03.769 
they did up the standards they added
stuff<00:02:01.739> like<00:02:01.979> the<00:02:02.130> golden<00:02:02.579> spork<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.179> Thunder

stuff like the golden spork the Thunder

00:02:03.779 --> 00:02:06.379 
stuff like the golden spork the Thunder
punch<00:02:04.219> just<00:02:05.219> a<00:02:05.340> bunch<00:02:05.609> of<00:02:05.789> really<00:02:06.060> awesome

00:02:06.379 --> 00:02:06.389 
punch just a bunch of really awesome

00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:08.359 
punch just a bunch of really awesome
stuff<00:02:06.899> they<00:02:07.020> even<00:02:07.259> added<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:07.619> Galvin<00:02:08.069> uncle's

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
stuff they even added the Galvin uncle's

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.339 
stuff they even added the Galvin uncle's
as<00:02:08.520> well<00:02:08.729> and<00:02:09.149> I<00:02:09.239> was<00:02:09.360> really<00:02:09.599> disappointed<00:02:09.750> to

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
as well and I was really disappointed to

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.650 
as well and I was really disappointed to
see<00:02:10.530> that<00:02:10.560> the<00:02:10.890> regular<00:02:11.700> zombie<00:02:12.209> team<00:02:12.450> wasn't

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
see that the regular zombie team wasn't

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.050 
see that the regular zombie team wasn't
able<00:02:12.930> to<00:02:13.170> create<00:02:13.500> more<00:02:13.800> cool<00:02:14.190> melee<00:02:14.640> ideas

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
able to create more cool melee ideas

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.330 
able to create more cool melee ideas
while<00:02:15.330> the<00:02:15.480> campaign<00:02:16.140> team<00:02:16.470> was<00:02:16.800> so<00:02:17.130> I<00:02:17.160> think

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
while the campaign team was so I think

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.600 
while the campaign team was so I think
that's<00:02:17.730> a<00:02:17.850> really<00:02:18.240> big

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
that's a really big

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.820 
that's a really big
thing<00:02:18.730> that<00:02:19.210> Trek<00:02:19.480> needs<00:02:19.840> to<00:02:20.050> work<00:02:20.320> on<00:02:20.560> and

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
thing that Trek needs to work on and

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.950 
thing that Trek needs to work on and
especially<00:02:21.160> because<00:02:21.670> they<00:02:21.880> added<00:02:22.300> the<00:02:22.420> idea

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:22.960 
especially because they added the idea

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.650 
especially because they added the idea
of<00:02:23.170> buildable<00:02:23.730> integration<00:02:24.730> into<00:02:25.090> black<00:02:25.360> ops

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
of buildable integration into black ops

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.620 
of buildable integration into black ops
2<00:02:25.840> I<00:02:26.020> feel<00:02:26.290> kind<00:02:26.680> of<00:02:26.830> disappointed<00:02:27.730> that<00:02:28.270> black

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
2 I feel kind of disappointed that black

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.630 
2 I feel kind of disappointed that black
ops<00:02:28.900> 2<00:02:29.050> was<00:02:29.230> only<00:02:29.530> able<00:02:29.680> to<00:02:29.860> bring<00:02:30.100> like<00:02:30.460> the

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
ops 2 was only able to bring like the

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.750 
ops 2 was only able to bring like the
golden<00:02:31.030> spork<00:02:31.360> the<00:02:31.570> galvanic<00:02:32.020> holes<00:02:32.440> and<00:02:32.760> the

golden spork the galvanic holes and the

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.700 
golden spork the galvanic holes and the
Thunder<00:02:34.120> punch<00:02:34.300> that's<00:02:34.630> pretty<00:02:34.990> much<00:02:35.200> all<00:02:35.380> it

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:35.710 
Thunder punch that's pretty much all it

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:37.290 
Thunder punch that's pretty much all it
was<00:02:35.830> able<00:02:36.160> to<00:02:36.280> bring<00:02:36.550> and<00:02:36.790> i<00:02:36.850> feel<00:02:37.090> i

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
was able to bring and i feel i

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.570 
was able to bring and i feel i
understand<00:02:38.020> that<00:02:38.140> black<00:02:38.440> ops<00:02:38.740> 2<00:02:39.040> a<00:02:39.070> black<00:02:39.370> ops

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
understand that black ops 2 a black ops

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.700 
understand that black ops 2 a black ops
2<00:02:39.760> zombies<00:02:39.790> as<00:02:40.330> me<00:02:40.600> or<00:02:40.810> just<00:02:41.080> zombies<00:02:41.530> and

guns<00:02:43.600> but<00:02:44.110> i<00:02:44.140> believe<00:02:44.230> there<00:02:44.740> should<00:02:44.770> be<00:02:45.130> a

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
guns but i believe there should be a

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.490 
guns but i believe there should be a
strong<00:02:45.790> melee<00:02:46.150> weapon<00:02:46.660> for<00:02:46.930> each<00:02:47.140> of<00:02:47.350> the<00:02:47.440> new

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
strong melee weapon for each of the new

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.370 
strong melee weapon for each of the new
maps<00:02:47.770> in<00:02:48.040> black<00:02:48.459> ops<00:02:48.730> 3<00:02:48.970> for<00:02:49.630> sure<00:02:49.990> this<00:02:50.230> is<00:02:50.350> the

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
maps in black ops 3 for sure this is the

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.740 
maps in black ops 3 for sure this is the
climax<00:02:51.040> of<00:02:51.190> zombies<00:02:51.640> we<00:02:52.120> need<00:02:52.300> to<00:02:52.420> be<00:02:52.540> getting

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
climax of zombies we need to be getting

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.620 
climax of zombies we need to be getting
some<00:02:53.080> top-notch<00:02:53.800> stuff<00:02:54.250> but<00:02:54.640> anyways<00:02:54.970> let's

dying light or dead island there's
usually<00:03:02.230> this<00:03:02.590> buildable<00:03:03.130> table<00:03:03.610> in<00:03:03.790> that

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:03.820 
usually this buildable table in that

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:05.699 
usually this buildable table in that
game<00:03:04.270> where<00:03:04.450> you<00:03:04.540> can<00:03:04.660> like<00:03:04.840> modify<00:03:05.500> your

weapon and stuff and I would really love

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.410 
weapon and stuff and I would really love
it<00:03:08.290> if<00:03:08.410> zombies<00:03:08.800> were<00:03:09.370> able<00:03:09.760> to<00:03:09.970> just<00:03:10.150> have

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
it if zombies were able to just have

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.690 
it if zombies were able to just have
some<00:03:10.750> sort<00:03:10.959> of<00:03:11.050> table<00:03:11.350> like<00:03:11.680> that<00:03:11.709> we<00:03:12.130> have<00:03:12.400> had

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
some sort of table like that we have had

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.970 
some sort of table like that we have had
buildable<00:03:13.390> xand<00:03:13.630> stuff<00:03:13.780> like<00:03:13.959> the<00:03:14.110> past<00:03:14.350> this

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
buildable xand stuff like the past this

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.280 
buildable xand stuff like the past this
would<00:03:15.160> just<00:03:15.340> basically<00:03:15.489> be<00:03:16.110> modifications<00:03:17.110> to

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
would just basically be modifications to

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.650 
would just basically be modifications to
your<00:03:17.320> melee<00:03:17.709> weapon<00:03:18.160> so<00:03:18.310> for<00:03:18.489> example<00:03:18.660> undead

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
your melee weapon so for example undead

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:21.600 
your melee weapon so for example undead
Ireland<00:03:20.080> and<00:03:20.200> dying<00:03:20.440> light<00:03:20.739> or<00:03:20.920> whatever<00:03:20.980> you

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:21.610 
Ireland and dying light or whatever you

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:23.370 
Ireland and dying light or whatever you
can<00:03:21.790> get<00:03:21.940> a<00:03:22.000> weapon<00:03:22.480> that<00:03:22.510> has<00:03:22.780> a<00:03:22.810> modification

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
can get a weapon that has a modification

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.320 
can get a weapon that has a modification
where<00:03:23.980> there's<00:03:24.160> like<00:03:24.310> electricity<00:03:24.850> coming

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:25.330 
where there's like electricity coming

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.449 
where there's like electricity coming
out<00:03:25.540> of<00:03:25.570> it<00:03:25.810> you<00:03:26.170> need<00:03:26.350> to<00:03:26.470> collect<00:03:26.680> stuff<00:03:27.190> from

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
out of it you need to collect stuff from

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:29.039 
out of it you need to collect stuff from
the<00:03:27.640> map<00:03:27.820> and<00:03:28.090> then<00:03:28.239> just<00:03:28.510> put<00:03:28.810> it<00:03:28.959> all

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:29.049 
the map and then just put it all

electricity corrosive a fire knife like
what<00:03:46.930> you're<00:03:47.049> seeing<00:03:47.320> on<00:03:47.500> screen<00:03:47.530> right<00:03:47.980> now

what you're seeing on screen right now

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.220 
what you're seeing on screen right now
like<00:03:48.459> ice<00:03:48.670> anything<00:03:49.450> really<00:03:49.660> cool<00:03:50.049> with

like ice anything really cool with
elements<00:03:50.769> I<00:03:50.860> feel<00:03:51.130> that<00:03:51.340> would<00:03:51.489> be<00:03:51.700> really

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
elements I feel that would be really

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.509 
elements I feel that would be really
really<00:03:52.180> great<00:03:52.750> and<00:03:52.930> I<00:03:53.049> think<00:03:53.350> that<00:03:53.860> black<00:03:54.220> ops

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:54.519 
really great and I think that black ops

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:56.910 
really great and I think that black ops
3<00:03:54.820> definitely<00:03:55.390> needs<00:03:55.600> a<00:03:55.780> melee<00:03:56.230> system<00:03:56.680> like

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:56.920 
3 definitely needs a melee system like

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.740 
3 definitely needs a melee system like
this<00:03:57.100> I<00:03:57.280> love<00:03:57.519> how<00:03:57.670> dead<00:03:57.940> island<00:03:58.360> a<00:03:58.480> dying

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
this I love how dead island a dying

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.990 
this I love how dead island a dying
light<00:03:58.989> are<00:03:59.170> integrated<00:03:59.860> fully<00:04:00.220> pretty<00:04:00.790> much

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
light are integrated fully pretty much

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.199 
light are integrated fully pretty much
about<00:04:01.750> melee<00:04:02.260> weapons<00:04:02.680> I<00:04:02.890> think<00:04:03.280> black<00:04:03.580> ops<00:04:03.880> 3

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:04.209 
about melee weapons I think black ops 3

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:06.449 
about melee weapons I think black ops 3
should<00:04:04.660> not<00:04:04.840> take<00:04:05.110> that<00:04:05.320> entirely<00:04:06.100> but<00:04:06.310> they

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:06.459 
should not take that entirely but they

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:08.039 
should not take that entirely but they
should<00:04:06.670> definitely<00:04:07.120> add<00:04:07.299> their<00:04:07.570> own<00:04:07.600> little

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:08.049 
should definitely add their own little

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:10.140 
should definitely add their own little
touch<00:04:08.440> to<00:04:08.769> it<00:04:08.799> and<00:04:09.100> another<00:04:09.310> really<00:04:09.730> cool

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 
touch to it and another really cool

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.330 
touch to it and another really cool
element<00:04:10.750> I<00:04:10.870> would<00:04:11.110> really<00:04:11.440> love<00:04:11.769> to<00:04:11.830> see<00:04:12.220> in

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340 
element I would really love to see in

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:14.610 
element I would really love to see in
black<00:04:12.580> ops<00:04:12.910> 3<00:04:13.030> is<00:04:13.390> that<00:04:13.570> if<00:04:13.750> you<00:04:13.900> were<00:04:14.019> able<00:04:14.260> to

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620 
black ops 3 is that if you were able to

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.979 
black ops 3 is that if you were able to
combine<00:04:14.980> different<00:04:15.700> weapons<00:04:16.419> so<00:04:16.660> for<00:04:16.900> example

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
combine different weapons so for example

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:19.080 
combine different weapons so for example
if<00:04:17.440> you<00:04:17.590> were<00:04:17.709> to<00:04:17.859> able<00:04:18.190> to<00:04:18.310> combine<00:04:18.519> us<00:04:18.910> like

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.090 
if you were to able to combine us like

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:21.120 
if you were to able to combine us like
one<00:04:19.419> electric<00:04:20.169> knife<00:04:20.350> that<00:04:20.560> you<00:04:20.680> have<00:04:20.890> and

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.130 
one electric knife that you have and

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:23.340 
one electric knife that you have and
this<00:04:21.519> one<00:04:21.790> fire<00:04:22.180> knife<00:04:22.479> that<00:04:22.690> you'd<00:04:22.840> have<00:04:23.050> and

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:23.350 
this one fire knife that you'd have and

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:25.560 
this one fire knife that you'd have and
you<00:04:23.650> make<00:04:23.830> like<00:04:24.040> a<00:04:24.070> fiery<00:04:24.550> electric<00:04:25.390> knife

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 
you make like a fiery electric knife

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:27.839 
you make like a fiery electric knife
that<00:04:25.870> wouldn't<00:04:26.200> be<00:04:26.290> as<00:04:26.440> overpowered<00:04:27.340> but<00:04:27.760> it

00:04:27.839 --> 00:04:27.849 
that wouldn't be as overpowered but it

00:04:27.849 --> 00:04:29.490 
that wouldn't be as overpowered but it
would<00:04:27.940> be<00:04:27.970> about<00:04:28.330> the<00:04:28.539> same<00:04:28.720> so<00:04:28.990> like<00:04:29.110> half<00:04:29.320> the

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:29.500 
would be about the same so like half the

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:30.900 
would be about the same so like half the
knife<00:04:29.650> will<00:04:29.860> be<00:04:29.950> electric<00:04:30.400> half<00:04:30.580> the<00:04:30.760> knife

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:30.910 
knife will be electric half the knife

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:32.159 
knife will be electric half the knife
would<00:04:31.060> be<00:04:31.210> fired<00:04:31.450> something

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:32.169 
would be fired something

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:34.230 
would be fired something
really<00:04:32.560> damn<00:04:32.860> cool<00:04:32.889> like<00:04:33.460> that<00:04:33.490> I<00:04:33.669> think<00:04:33.879> that

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 
really damn cool like that I think that

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.550 
really damn cool like that I think that
would<00:04:34.389> be<00:04:34.509> really<00:04:34.539> great<00:04:35.110> and<00:04:35.289> there<00:04:35.439> would<00:04:35.529> be

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 
would be really great and there would be

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.890 
would be really great and there would be
different<00:04:35.949> perks<00:04:36.189> to<00:04:36.430> it<00:04:36.550> and<00:04:36.669> different<00:04:37.270> cons

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:37.900 
different perks to it and different cons

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:39.570 
different perks to it and different cons
to<00:04:38.199> it<00:04:38.229> I<00:04:38.439> think<00:04:38.529> that<00:04:38.889> would<00:04:39.069> be<00:04:39.189> absolutely

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:39.580 
to it I think that would be absolutely

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:41.820 
to it I think that would be absolutely
outstanding<00:04:40.120> of<00:04:40.990> trick<00:04:41.229> added<00:04:41.620> something

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:41.830 
outstanding of trick added something

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:44.219 
outstanding of trick added something
like<00:04:42.129> that<00:04:42.340> again<00:04:42.789> I'm<00:04:43.270> not<00:04:43.479> saying<00:04:43.840> that<00:04:43.930> this

00:04:44.219 --> 00:04:44.229 
like that again I'm not saying that this

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:46.230 
like that again I'm not saying that this
they<00:04:44.590> should<00:04:44.800> have<00:04:44.979> weapons<00:04:45.430> everywhere<00:04:45.879> so

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.240 
they should have weapons everywhere so

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:47.640 
they should have weapons everywhere so
like<00:04:46.419> there's<00:04:46.629> one<00:04:46.840> on<00:04:46.960> the<00:04:47.050> ground<00:04:47.080> that<00:04:47.469> is

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:47.650 
like there's one on the ground that is

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:49.170

different<00:05:12.039> anime<00:05:12.520> shows<00:05:12.789> that<00:05:12.999> I've<00:05:13.150> seen<00:05:13.389> and

00:05:13.619 --> 00:05:13.629 
different anime shows that I've seen and

00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:16.050 
different anime shows that I've seen and
it's<00:05:13.749> basically<00:05:14.020> the<00:05:14.560> greatest<00:05:15.430> sword<00:05:15.729> weapon

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:16.060 
it's basically the greatest sword weapon

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.209 
it's basically the greatest sword weapon
we've<00:05:16.449> never<00:05:16.659> seen<00:05:17.020> a<00:05:17.080> sword<00:05:17.499> as<00:05:17.800> a<00:05:17.830> melee

00:05:18.209 --> 00:05:18.219 
we've never seen a sword as a melee

00:05:18.219 --> 00:05:20.700 
we've never seen a sword as a melee
weapon<00:05:18.969> in<00:05:19.300> call<00:05:19.569> duty<00:05:19.870> black<00:05:19.990> ops<00:05:20.229> 2<00:05:20.680> zombies

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:20.710 
weapon in call duty black ops 2 zombies

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:22.679 
weapon in call duty black ops 2 zombies
so<00:05:21.219> I<00:05:21.279> think<00:05:21.370> that<00:05:21.639> would<00:05:21.759> be<00:05:21.879> a<00:05:21.909> really<00:05:22.270> damn

00:05:22.679 --> 00:05:22.689 
so I think that would be a really damn

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:24.480 
so I think that would be a really damn
cool<00:05:22.719> element<00:05:23.560> that<00:05:23.680> they<00:05:23.800> could<00:05:24.009> add<00:05:24.219> and

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:24.490 
cool element that they could add and

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:26.939 
cool element that they could add and
also<00:05:25.150> i<00:05:25.180> just<00:05:25.569> wish<00:05:25.810> that<00:05:25.839> these<00:05:26.259> future<00:05:26.710> maps

00:05:26.939 --> 00:05:26.949 
also i just wish that these future maps

00:05:26.949 --> 00:05:29.189 
also i just wish that these future maps
would<00:05:27.159> be<00:05:27.310> more<00:05:27.550> customizable<00:05:28.270> with<00:05:28.990> these

00:05:29.189 --> 00:05:29.199 
would be more customizable with these

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:31.079 
would be more customizable with these
melee<00:05:29.620> weapons<00:05:30.069> so<00:05:30.189> that's<00:05:30.370> basically<00:05:30.550> all<00:05:30.939> i

00:05:31.079 --> 00:05:31.089 
melee weapons so that's basically all i

00:05:31.089 --> 00:05:32.790 
melee weapons so that's basically all i
