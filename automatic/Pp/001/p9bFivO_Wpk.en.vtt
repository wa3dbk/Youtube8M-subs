00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 hello everyone and welcome to that you 

00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:04.830
 change life on doctissimo and there all 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.480
 it is true that I would have 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.859
 want to laugh a bit because I 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.300
 feel a little alone in this apartment 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:10.950
 it's true that it's a bit depressing gold 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.349
 not only laughing it's good for the 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.790
 moral but laugh between 2 to 3 minutes by 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.410
 day it's like you're doing 30 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.539
 minutes of relaxation and that's it 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.539
 ok, it does not really change life 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.939
 do you figure that the French would pass 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:30.399
 today less than a minute a day 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:31.539
 to laugh and 7% even say never 

00:00:30.399 --> 00:00:33.910
 laughs that's a lot anyway 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:35.440
 song whereas a good laugh is 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:37.329
 so beautiful besides some 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.960
 specialists even compares it to a 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:40.000
 yoga session 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.559
 because the diaphragm contract 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.479
 and relaxes it's a bit in fact 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:44.500
 like an internal gymnastics for 

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:46.089
 lungs and for the system 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.979
 cardiovascular there is also a story 

00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:50.229
 of hormones when we laugh we secret 

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:52.269
 endorphins and neck or releases the 

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:53.920
 dopamine and it reduces stress 

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:56.259
 release the pressure and then especially 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.369
 helps you sleep better but before 

00:00:56.259 --> 00:00:59.619
 to burst out laughing 

00:00:57.369 --> 00:01:00.970
 remains to find the right detonator and 

00:00:59.619 --> 00:01:02.920
 that's where things get complicated 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:04.479
 here are for example watching movies 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.460
 school or when we know that a film lasts in 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:08.470
 average 1h30 there it is sure you do 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.150
 explode the meter of your fun 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.439
 good and then makes funny faces so a 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.970
 stuff that's old as the world but 

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:14.110
 it always works finally provided you 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.119
 do them completely 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:17.439
 incongruous a moment when nobody gets there 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:19.000
 wait and then if you miss 

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:20.170
 of inspiration eat a personal thing that 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.659
