00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
guys switching over to After Effects

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.130 
guys switching over to After Effects
just<00:02:05.460> because<00:02:05.729> like<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:06.329> program<00:02:06.689> is<00:02:06.810> just<00:02:06.990> so

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
just because like the program is just so

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.020 
just because like the program is just so
more<00:02:07.560> versatile<00:02:08.190> just<00:02:08.520> gives<00:02:08.700> you<00:02:08.759> so<00:02:08.910> much

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
more versatile just gives you so much

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.479 
more versatile just gives you so much
more<00:02:09.090> options<00:02:09.690> everything's<00:02:10.259> easier<00:02:10.619> to<00:02:10.800> use

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
more options everything's easier to use

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.790 
more options everything's easier to use
i<00:02:11.610> would<00:02:11.730> say<00:02:11.849> easier<00:02:12.239> but<00:02:12.390> just<00:02:12.540> more<00:02:12.870> like

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
i would say easier but just more like

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.100 
i would say easier but just more like
to<00:02:13.920> get<00:02:14.130> it<00:02:14.280> it's<00:02:14.520> easier<00:02:14.970> you<00:02:15.090> know<00:02:15.120> but<00:02:16.020> if

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
to get it it's easier you know but if

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.330 
to get it it's easier you know but if
you're<00:02:16.200> let's<00:02:16.350> say<00:02:16.440> you've<00:02:16.590> started<00:02:16.830> any<00:02:17.040> you

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
you're let's say you've started any you

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.770 
you're let's say you've started any you
want<00:02:17.520> to<00:02:17.610> get<00:02:17.790> into<00:02:18.030> editing<00:02:18.450> that's<00:02:18.660> why

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
want to get into editing that's why

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.000 
want to get into editing that's why
you're<00:02:18.900> watching<00:02:19.200> this<00:02:19.290> or<00:02:19.530> should<00:02:19.740> I<00:02:19.800> start

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
you're watching this or should I start

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.060 
you're watching this or should I start
off<00:02:20.100> the<00:02:20.220> apt<00:02:20.370> if<00:02:20.520> extra<00:02:20.880> I<00:02:21.090> guess<00:02:21.270> um<00:02:22.070> you're

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
off the apt if extra I guess um you're

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:24.950 
off the apt if extra I guess um you're
going<00:02:23.190> to<00:02:23.250> learn<00:02:23.520> that<00:02:23.880> gets<00:02:24.330> a<00:02:24.450> lot<00:02:24.480> quicker

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:24.960 
going to learn that gets a lot quicker

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.330 
going to learn that gets a lot quicker
than<00:02:25.170> you<00:02:25.290> were<00:02:25.410> with<00:02:25.530> after<00:02:25.830> effects<00:02:26.070> if
