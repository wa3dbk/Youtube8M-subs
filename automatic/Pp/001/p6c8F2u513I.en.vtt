00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
all the time so fish does take a run

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.000 
all the time so fish does take a run
yeah<00:00:48.210> and<00:00:48.420> your<00:00:48.540> hand<00:00:48.810> happens<00:00:49.470> to<00:00:49.590> slip<00:00:49.800> off

using - oh I would probably my wrist
would<00:01:24.719> probably<00:01:25.170> break

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.789 

he<00:01:30.970> looks<00:01:31.270> like<00:01:31.540> he's<00:01:31.750> heavy<00:01:34.439> yeah<00:01:35.439> he's<00:01:35.619> gonna

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:35.799 
he looks like he's heavy yeah he's gonna

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:37.469 
he looks like he's heavy yeah he's gonna
prep<00:01:36.100> a<00:01:36.130> fight<00:01:36.460> just<00:01:36.759> wanting<00:01:37.240> to<00:01:37.299> leave<00:01:37.450> the
