00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:21.920
 everybody's been arguing lately 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:24.200
 giving millions and millions of dollars 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:27.170
 reasons why the nintendo is 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:31.010
 failing to anyone is breaking 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:33.400
 What was the mistake of time will tell the 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:38.120
 millions and millions of new reasons 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:41.629
 because the game it was not as the 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:44.300
 graphing, or because 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:47.030
 competition is to invest more between 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.140
 parties because the weather is very closed 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:52.820
 I do not know what 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:55.960
 but only I know the real reason why 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.960
 nintendo late in the night 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:07.670
 I collected analysis here with me 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:10.610

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:15.380

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:21.130
 Look at ours, you want it inside. 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:25.520
 Run the kilo cuore this control 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:30.650
 directional joysticks in the illegal two crisis 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:37.760
 selective action buttons look that 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:41.810
 very crazy, cool honor, man , hand after 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:44.870

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:50.390

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:55.570

00:01:50.390 --> 00:02:00.260

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:05.330
 four buttons have two more up here 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:06.650

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:10.760
 Crazy 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:15.220

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:22.160
 The black video game man, look at this. 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:25.520
 64 biting our hand had an orgasm 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:29.120
 now look at this control 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:32.630
 look how many buttons on ways to 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:36.980
 hold the control four inputs and 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:40.220
 culture does not look at this a four 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:44.390
 tickets for the control us tomorrow 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:49.190
 because I stayed in our space 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:53.090
 from memory, that's crazy. 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:56.630

00:02:53.090 --> 00:03:02.090

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:04.700

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:10.040
 No, I do not believe you. I do not believe you. 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:13.160
 They will not believe me, little guy. 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:18.160

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:19.580
 control and look at that face that 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.290
 comfortable 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:25.700
 Look at the button it came back as it slides 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:26.930
 Look at our face that the command and 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:31.810
 look at this 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:38.860
 second directional face with the buttons 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:43.330
 and the hour after and that's what the guy looks at 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:49.569
 just look at a non- human difference 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:51.310
 Look at this expensive cds card entry. 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:54.670
