ontar<00:02:49.980> regeneration<00:02:50.780> let's<00:02:51.780> use<00:02:52.019> our<00:02:52.200> AIS

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
ontar regeneration let's use our AIS

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.789 
ontar regeneration let's use our AIS
rope<00:02:53.189> to<00:02:54.030> work<00:02:54.150> our<00:02:54.329> flexibility<00:02:54.959> keep<00:02:55.530> our

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:55.799 
rope to work our flexibility keep our

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:59.179 
rope to work our flexibility keep our
injuries<00:02:56.670> down<00:02:57.000> and<00:02:57.530> keep<00:02:58.530> improving<00:02:58.890> our

00:02:59.179 --> 00:02:59.189 
injuries down and keep improving our

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:00.949 
injuries down and keep improving our
performance<00:02:59.819> by<00:03:00.000> increasing<00:03:00.450> our<00:03:00.569> range<00:03:00.780> of

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
performance by increasing our range of

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:08.850 
performance by increasing our range of
motion

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:19.680 

you

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:22.920 

so<00:03:20.290> our<00:03:20.440> first<00:03:20.650> movement<00:03:21.160> is<00:03:21.250> the<00:03:21.790> AIS<00:03:22.330> rope

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
so our first movement is the AIS rope

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.440 
so our first movement is the AIS rope
stretch<00:03:23.290> with<00:03:23.950> our<00:03:24.100> hamstring<00:03:24.730> so<00:03:25.330> we're

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
stretch with our hamstring so we're

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:26.900 
stretch with our hamstring so we're
going<00:03:25.540> to<00:03:25.630> start<00:03:25.870> in<00:03:25.930> our<00:03:26.050> supine<00:03:26.530> position

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
going to start in our supine position

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.490 
going to start in our supine position
we're<00:03:27.910> going<00:03:28.000> to<00:03:28.090> lock<00:03:28.450> our<00:03:28.750> opposing<00:03:29.320> leg

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
we're going to lock our opposing leg

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.400 
we're going to lock our opposing leg
into<00:03:29.710> the<00:03:29.860> ground<00:03:30.690> we're<00:03:31.690> going<00:03:31.810> to<00:03:31.870> relax<00:03:32.140> our
