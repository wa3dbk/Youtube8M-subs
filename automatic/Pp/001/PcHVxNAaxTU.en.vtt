00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:52.579 
for your refund and I think before it

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:55.959 
for your refund and I think before it
was<00:01:52.669> like<00:01:52.909> 14<00:01:53.539> days<00:01:53.899> and<00:01:54.380> there's<00:01:55.310> a<00:01:55.369> 60<00:01:55.789> day

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:55.969 
was like 14 days and there's a 60 day

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:58.479 
was like 14 days and there's a 60 day
guarantee<00:01:55.999> that<00:01:56.959> they<00:01:57.139> put<00:01:57.439> on<00:01:57.679> these<00:01:57.950> units

00:01:58.479 --> 00:01:58.489 
guarantee that they put on these units

00:01:58.489 --> 00:02:02.769 
guarantee that they put on these units
so<00:01:58.789> 60<00:01:59.630> days<00:01:59.840> that's<00:02:00.289> two<00:02:00.739> months<00:02:01.729> that<00:02:02.479> if

00:02:02.769 --> 00:02:02.779 
so 60 days that's two months that if

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:04.719 
so 60 days that's two months that if
there's<00:02:03.049> anything<00:02:03.619> wrong<00:02:03.829> with<00:02:04.069> the<00:02:04.369> unit
