00:00:08.869 --> 00:00:11.869
 pressure 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:16.309

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:36.430

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.830
 the days 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.340
 I pray to the god that is taken to the city hall I want 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.740
 because since when a good fish is the flashlight and admissibility means of soup

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.120
 Remedies says they are well attended in the tour 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.759
 I have my sensible of the month 

00:02:12.759 --> 00:02:16.519
 and why am I going to talk to a person inside the palace if I stop 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:19.779
 until punishment defeat suffered 

00:02:19.779 --> 00:02:22.150
 We are here today to present 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:27.290
 one more goal state government programs with the good trajectory of being 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:28.319
 may have 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:34.060
 was able to achieve the objective decisions taken with the population's approval the law 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.489
 material election in January 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:39.399
 today comes here to talk about our government plan 

00:02:39.399 --> 00:02:42.580
 spoken about our goals that we are going to make in our government 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.199
 from next year 

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:47.859
 What we want to have is a public administration that we 

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:50.689
 do it safely and with quality 

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:55.450
 an administration where it is the government it has to be decentralized 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.109
 a participatory government 

00:02:57.109 --> 00:03:02.450
 For this we have to start having a responsible technical government with 

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:07.540
 people who have autonomy and capacity in each secretariat or in each director of 

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:08.499
 Department 

00:03:08.499 --> 00:03:11.990
 because we have to meet everyone's best possible way 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:13.010
 with quality 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.980
 with honesty and if we can meet Maria to lose the game has to be all 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.559
 equal and does not need to have centralized government 

00:03:21.559 --> 00:03:23.139
 It means even more 

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:25.860
 what we want to create in the first month of our mandate 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:27.659

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:29.669

00:03:29.669 --> 00:03:32.370
 where associations and class entities 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.379

 who works in the municipal prefecture 

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:08.780
 the conscience of saying this because he has seen during those years the 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:12.960
 centralization of power and this does not let the city grow in the 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:13.909
