this alright and then let's get to the

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:13.360 
this alright and then let's get to the
console<00:03:07.590> oh<00:03:08.060> wow<00:03:09.470> this<00:03:10.470> is<00:03:10.709> nice<00:03:11.810> this<00:03:12.810> is

console oh wow this is nice this is
really<00:03:14.370> awesome<00:03:14.930> it's<00:03:15.930> huge<00:03:17.389> you<00:03:18.389> have<00:03:18.480> a

00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:18.599 
really awesome it's huge you have a

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:20.900 
really awesome it's huge you have a
stylus<00:03:19.139> and<00:03:19.410> I'm<00:03:20.370> guessing<00:03:20.670> this<00:03:20.730> is<00:03:20.819> where

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
stylus and I'm guessing this is where

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.400 
stylus and I'm guessing this is where
you<00:03:21.060> put<00:03:21.209> in<00:03:21.329> the<00:03:21.920> memory<00:03:22.920> card<00:03:23.250> or<00:03:23.400> SD<00:03:23.700> card

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.410 
you put in the memory card or SD card

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:25.580

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.030 
but that is ridiculously big and that is

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:26.050 
but that is ridiculously big and that is
what<00:04:23.150> she<00:04:23.270> said<00:04:23.479> but<00:04:24.400> wow<00:04:25.400> this<00:04:25.490> is<00:04:25.610> great

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:28.540 
what she said but wow this is great
the<00:04:26.630> design<00:04:26.960> itself<00:04:27.710> actually<00:04:28.160> you<00:04:28.460> know

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:28.550 
the design itself actually you know

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:29.740 
the design itself actually you know
starts<00:04:28.850> on<00:04:28.940> the<00:04:29.000> front<00:04:29.120> and<00:04:29.330> contains<00:04:29.570> on<00:04:29.720> the

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:29.750 
starts on the front and contains on the

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:32.320 
starts on the front and contains on the
back<00:04:29.990> door<00:04:30.199> I<00:04:30.229> think<00:04:30.440> looks<00:04:30.590> really<00:04:30.680> nice<00:04:31.330> and

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330 
back door I think looks really nice and

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.540 
back door I think looks really nice and
then<00:04:32.539> I<00:04:32.570> like<00:04:32.810> how<00:04:33.080> the<00:04:33.740> the<00:04:33.979> more<00:04:34.160> literature

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:34.550 
then I like how the the more literature

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:38.379 
then I like how the the more literature
here<00:04:34.910> continues<00:04:35.900> on<00:04:36.199> or<00:04:36.919> it<00:04:37.190> um<00:04:37.370> not<00:04:38.000> continues

00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:38.389 
here continues on or it um not continues

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:40.510 
here continues on or it um not continues
on<00:04:38.510> but<00:04:38.720> it<00:04:38.810> goes<00:04:38.990> with<00:04:39.740> the<00:04:39.889> tail<00:04:40.070> I<00:04:40.280> don't<00:04:40.460> I

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:40.520 
on but it goes with the tail I don't I

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.909 
on but it goes with the tail I don't I
think<00:04:40.699> it's<00:04:40.789> really<00:04:40.880> cool<00:04:41.120> but<00:04:41.210> anyway<00:04:41.919> that's

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:42.919 
think it's really cool but anyway that's

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:45.400 
think it's really cool but anyway that's
it<00:04:43.250> I<00:04:43.400> guess<00:04:43.460> it's<00:04:43.850> uh<00:04:44.000> first<00:04:44.600> 3ds<00:04:45.020> I've<00:04:45.229> owned

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:45.410 
it I guess it's uh first 3ds I've owned

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:47.230 
it I guess it's uh first 3ds I've owned
I<00:04:45.650> guess<00:04:45.889> I<00:04:46.039> really<00:04:46.100> needed<00:04:46.789> to<00:04:46.880> get<00:04:47.060> one

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.240 
I guess I really needed to get one

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.810 
I guess I really needed to get one
