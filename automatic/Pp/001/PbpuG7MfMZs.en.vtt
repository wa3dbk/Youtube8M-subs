00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:08.610
 hello it's rebecca the creator of 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.660
 a fairy in the studio today I 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.360
 will show you how to make a 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.969
 lingerie pouch using the 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:18.090
 assembly of the sheath assembly for this 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:20.939
 and you need two fabric rectangle of 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.920
 75 by 38 approximately 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.680
 at first I will start 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:32.189
 by pinned my fabrics against 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:34.279
 place I pin them up and in 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.279
 low 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:53.420
 Then I will start by poking my 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:55.930
 fabrics on the top and on the bottom in 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:58.370
 not forgetting to leave an opening 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:00.820
 on one side to be able to return 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.820
 then 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:20.470
 now i'm going to kidnap but 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.470
 pin and open but sewing offered 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.840
 now I'm going to form the pocket of 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:36.140
 our lingerie pouch 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:39.740
 positioning the entire stitched side in 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:45.470
 water at where it will be the flap and 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:47.990
 I'm pinning now I'm going to train the 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:52.070
 pocket using sheath folding 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:55.640
 so I folded but fabric here first 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:59.720
 blue fabric right place and the 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:02.330
 red fabric also in law against 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.390
 place so our fabrics are found 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:07.600
 each folded on himself 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:11.209
 thus forming the pocket 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:14.540
 I then check the measurements here the 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:19.030
 pocket should be 28 cm I measure 1 side 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:25.370
 28 the other side must also do 28 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:29.120
 then I fold and I check that 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:32.660
 call me lure and of course my culture I 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:38.150
 check then but dimension of each 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:41.480
 side here 44 and a half and I must have 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:45.310
 also 44 and a half on the other side when 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:50.530
 everything is flat and good size 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:56.170
 I'm pinning now I'm going to poke at 1 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:56.170
 cm edges on both sides 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:11.790
 once the sides stung I remove them 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:15.260
 pins and I go back through the opening 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.260
 that we left at the beginning 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:24.950
 opening is inside 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:38.850
 to get out the angles I use 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:41.190
 a Chinese wand is not the tip 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:47.250
 scissors to avoid damaging 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:49.800
 tissues and I'm going bent but angles in 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.870
 bending along the first koutio the 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:57.030
 along the second seam I hold 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:59.300
 with my hand and I'm going back here I have a 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:02.400
 beautiful right angle 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:05.490
 once my cover back and but 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:07.050
 seems bent I'll be ironing it for 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:10.830
 the moment we see that my cover 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:13.440
 is completely reversible since but 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:18.720
 sewing thanks to the sleeves are all 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:22.340
 inside I can choose to use 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.340
 one side or the other 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:34.590
 now I'm going to finish my cover 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:41.670
 closing the opening to the point and 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:45.030
 invisible high schools I hide my knot and 

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:48.510
 now i'm going to close by passing my 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:52.430
 tissues and zigzagging against 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:56.150
 inner thicknesses of my opening 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:05:01.260
 I take the blue fabric the red fabric 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:03.150
 I zigzag I go out on the slice I the 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.760
 slide and I'm careful not to 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:07.590
 go out on the outsides 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:09.990
 this is the cover is over and I 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:14.250
 can choose to close it with a 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:18.300
 ribbon or possibly add a 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:21.720
 button or any other item that could 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:23.310
 to decorate the flap the advantage of the assembly 

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:24.720
 in sheath on this sleeve is that 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:26.930
 all the seams are inside 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:29.400
 and nothing is visible outside 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:31.919
 now so now you know how to do 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:35.090
 a linen pouch 

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:35.090
 take out your underwear
