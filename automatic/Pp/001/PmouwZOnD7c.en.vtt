split<00:02:21.950> see<00:02:22.670> I<00:02:22.700> think<00:02:22.910> I<00:02:23.300> think<00:02:23.570> I<00:02:23.810> mean<00:02:23.990> he

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
split see I think I think I mean he

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.370 
split see I think I think I mean he
can't<00:02:24.920> be<00:02:25.130> unattractive<00:02:25.520> so<00:02:26.210> he<00:02:26.660> could<00:02:26.840> shave

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
can't be unattractive so he could shave

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.500 
can't be unattractive so he could shave
off<00:02:27.530> all<00:02:27.740> his<00:02:27.920> hair<00:02:27.980> any<00:02:28.250> Street<00:02:29.030> hooligans<00:02:29.210> I

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
off all his hair any Street hooligans I

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:30.850 
off all his hair any Street hooligans I
think<00:02:29.660> he<00:02:29.720> had<00:02:29.870> a<00:02:29.900> shaved<00:02:30.170> head<00:02:30.260> you<00:02:30.710> would

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
think he had a shaved head you would

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.650 
think he had a shaved head you would
still<00:02:31.100> be<00:02:31.280> gorgeous<00:02:31.940> you<00:02:32.030> know<00:02:32.060> it's<00:02:32.300> Charlie

still be gorgeous you know it's Charlie

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.970 
still be gorgeous you know it's Charlie
so<00:02:32.960> I<00:02:33.520> he<00:02:34.520> actually<00:02:34.730> did<00:02:35.240> it<00:02:35.270> and<00:02:35.750> I<00:02:36.110> think<00:02:36.140> if

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
so I he actually did it and I think if

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.650 
so I he actually did it and I think if
you<00:02:37.250> if<00:02:37.580> you<00:02:37.700> realize<00:02:38.000> between<00:02:38.360> the<00:02:38.480> seasons

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
you if you realize between the seasons

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.000 
you if you realize between the seasons
there's<00:02:38.959> been<00:02:39.080> about<00:02:39.230> 16<00:02:39.590> months<00:02:39.740> they've

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
there's been about 16 months they've

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:41.980 
there's been about 16 months they've
been<00:02:40.040> in<00:02:40.220> prison<00:02:40.430> and<00:02:40.700> I<00:02:40.790> think<00:02:41.060> it<00:02:41.209> was<00:02:41.660> just

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:41.990 
been in prison and I think it was just

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:44.500 
been in prison and I think it was just
an<00:02:42.230> evolution<00:02:43.190> of<00:02:43.310> his<00:02:43.490> character<00:02:44.030> that<00:02:44.209> he

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
an evolution of his character that he

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.530 
an evolution of his character that he
kind<00:02:45.290> of<00:02:45.350> wanted<00:02:45.560> to<00:02:45.620> show<00:02:46.060> and<00:02:47.060> I<00:02:47.300> don't<00:02:47.360> want

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
kind of wanted to show and I don't want

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.150 
kind of wanted to show and I don't want
