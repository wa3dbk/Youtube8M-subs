00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 well now I hope that it 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.180
 find very good today in this 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.060
 people can be teaching how I did 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:12.240
 this gummy of frost and 

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:14.970
 these nautical gummies are super easy 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.800
 to make very economic and well I think 

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:18.779
 it is a beam the same perfect for the 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:22.010
 summer and good if you want to see how 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.010
 I did keep watching the video 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:28.530
 and it is good to manifest frost glue 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.060
 paint the colors that you 

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:35.750
 want I chose blue and red ribbon 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:37.340
 the gums obviously and skewers I know 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.190
 I bought them in a way not like three 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:42.470
 dollars and well let's start putting 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:45.820
 the tape around the sole so that 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:45.820
 we did not know when to paint 

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:56.289
 Y 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.850
 but of course you can choose the one 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.350
 you want because friend more are 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.810
 nautical that made a saying that offers 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:12.800
 nautical and good here we are putting the 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:15.830
 blue a disposable cup and now it's 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.810
 time to paint good and how can they come 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:20.060
 I'm using a super finite brush 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.830
 because if I have much more control to the 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.869
 time to trace and I'm doing it 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:27.110
 quick to show it to you but I 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:28.940
 later with more time I was painting another 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.170
 once for good the slabs and 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:34.220
 letters had more 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.220
 the dark 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:42.390
 so that the navy 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.990
 Yes Yes 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.090
 my people 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.440
 with the other shoes that can see the 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.630
 ancito you can choose the image 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.670
 that you want but good my subject 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.619
 it was nautical that's why he made everything 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.509
 it was nautical and what better than an anchor 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:08.509
 so good as you can see I'm 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:10.580
 using the same brush and also we 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.200
 I'm painting fast for only 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.900
 to show you of you but after 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.690
 with more good time I went back to paint for 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.370
 it looked darker 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.770
 and good as you can see here also 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.480
 I did the same with the lines also what 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.250
 I made it by hand because you're good as they go 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.670
 to be more for the funniest diary 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:30.740
 more to go to festivals then 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.990
 this is why I did not want them to be 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.520
 perfect but of course you can 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:35.990
 be with a tape or with what 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.910
 you want and well here we are 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:40.310
 putting the painting in a small glass 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:42.200
 disposable I am here using 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.970
 tape but it was mostly for 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.190
 to show you that also what 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:49.070
 they can do like that but today it's like 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:51.380
 I said I did it hard but good here 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:53.240
 so composing is super easy 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:56.600
 gummies cost me five dollars in 

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:59.860
 walmart and good I hope and until now 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.860
 are you liking the video 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.710
 as you can see here I'm no longer 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.480
 freehand because as I told you 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:12.320
 these gums are going to be more than everything for 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:15.050
 go to festivals to concert to go out 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:17.060
 the city of walking this and good are 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:19.270
 most of all sports and for the day at 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.270
 day 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.020
 Y 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:29.880
 Y 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.880
 is a 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.810
 d 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:37.730
 and good since I 'm using a 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.950
 much more finite brochita because 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:42.709
 well obviously with the thick brush not 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:44.990
 I was going to be able to paint these areas equal to 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:46.760
 that's it now we remove the tape and 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:50.090
 wait two days to dry 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:53.000
 well fine well and you are ready to 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:56.680
 use and what is missing is to put the 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.680
 cords and ready 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:03.290
 the life 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:03.290
 for a change 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.060
 of the couple 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.660
 and 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:24.049
 all right 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:39.260
 you do not have to pay 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:39.260
 if not 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:43.260
 Yes Yes 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:57.060
 good good alone 

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:57.060
 it's called laughter 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.590
 Christian 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:07.590
 and well now we start with the gummies 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:09.960
 black and with the same procedure 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:12.620
 the tape around the sole so as not to 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.620
 stain 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:18.150
 we are going to start by sticking in a 

00:05:16.259 --> 00:05:19.860
 recipient I did everything to the eye for 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:22.130
 hundred then you also more or 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:25.800
 less they are seeing and good they are applying 

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:27.539
 this hits her and now the frost that 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:29.580
 I also did it at 2 percent myself 

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:32.039
 I had to stir and put frost 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:33.569
 again like three times this because 

00:05:32.039 --> 00:05:37.430
 he wants to stay as he was 

00:05:33.569 --> 00:05:37.430
 pretty pretty sparse 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:50.710
 and well now we start here you can see 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:52.360
 that white baby but do not have not 

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:53.680
 worry do not be afraid that the 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:56.319
 Frost as it sticks is going to be 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:58.870
 totally transparent and good what 

00:05:56.319 --> 00:06:02.080
 have to do is have fun what I 

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:03.849
 I was that around the black ge 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:06.009
 because well, it was going to be much more 

00:06:03.849 --> 00:06:08.050
 elegant and could use them for 

00:06:06.009 --> 00:06:10.509
 night since these rubber bands are just in 

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:13.270
 night and that's also why I chose the 

00:06:10.509 --> 00:06:16.690
 Moccasin style without laces because with 

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:18.610
 laces is more sporty then good 

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:20.620
 As you can see , this was the next day 

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:22.810
 let it dry very well 

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:24.669
 frost and paste it and already what I'm 

00:06:22.810 --> 00:06:27.960
 doing is finishing touch-up or is 

00:06:24.669 --> 00:06:30.610
 ending where I saw in places 

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:33.120
 bold then there I went back to spend the 

00:06:30.610 --> 00:06:33.120
 brochette 

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:41.220
 and then with a little brush 

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:42.990
 I was little by the edge and by the 

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:45.150
 corners but how can you see there from 

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:46.949
 the edge in black for the same reason 

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:49.110
 this is more than everything to go to the cinema of 

00:06:46.949 --> 00:06:52.050
 night if I want to go with a concert 

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:56.039
 at night and good is a bit like that more 

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:59.009
 elegant but Christian you comfortable and already 

00:06:56.039 --> 00:07:00.360
 the same we removed the tape and ready and 

00:06:59.009 --> 00:07:02.520
 good as I had already told you 

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:04.349
 committees are super easy to make are 

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:06.180
 very economical and good the best thing is that 

00:07:04.349 --> 00:07:07.770
 we made it ourselves 

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:09.780
 I hope you enjoyed the video if 

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:11.550
 they liked it like if they want more 

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:12.479
 videos of something yourself from table see 

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:14.849

 I hope you liked this idea and

 happy summer for all chao 

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:28.960
