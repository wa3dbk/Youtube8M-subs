00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:33.820 
that I wanted to do ethnobotany research

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.450 
that I wanted to do ethnobotany research
I<00:00:34.059> phoned<00:00:34.420> him<00:00:34.690> up<00:00:34.750> and<00:00:35.199> asked<00:00:36.010> if<00:00:36.129> he<00:00:36.159> could

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:40.600 
community who might teach me about

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.920 
community who might teach me about
plants<00:00:41.320> and<00:00:41.530> he<00:00:42.309> put<00:00:43.030> me<00:00:43.180> in<00:00:43.210> touch<00:00:43.299> with<00:00:43.540> his

father<00:00:44.199> Chris<00:00:44.739> Paul<00:00:45.129> who<00:00:45.430> I<00:00:45.460> would<00:00:45.790> say<00:00:46.030> is<00:00:46.570> my

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:46.930 
father Chris Paul who I would say is my

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.799 
father Chris Paul who I would say is my
very<00:00:47.229> first<00:00:47.699> teacher<00:00:48.699> in<00:00:48.729> ethnobotany

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:49.809 
very first teacher in ethnobotany

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:53.939 
very first teacher in ethnobotany
and<00:00:50.159> so<00:00:51.159> I<00:00:51.460> went<00:00:51.820> out<00:00:52.030> to<00:00:52.059> visit<00:00:52.449> Chris<00:00:53.170> once<00:00:53.680> a

00:00:53.939 --> 00:00:53.949 
and so I went out to visit Chris once a

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:57.570 
and so I went out to visit Chris once a
week<00:00:54.600> for<00:00:55.600> a<00:00:55.869> long<00:00:56.290> time<00:00:56.650> for<00:00:57.010> quite<00:00:57.280> a<00:00:57.309> few

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:02.830 
months and started using the same

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:05.730 
months and started using the same
methods<00:01:03.309> that<00:01:03.430> I<00:01:03.549> still<00:01:04.239> use<00:01:04.269> today<00:01:04.809> and<00:01:05.320> that

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:05.740 
methods that I still use today and that

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.360 
methods that I still use today and that
is<00:01:05.950> really<00:01:06.250> just<00:01:06.670> talking<00:01:07.119> to<00:01:07.690> him<00:01:08.080> about<00:01:08.560> the

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:09.370 
is really just talking to him about the

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:11.450 
is really just talking to him about the
plant<00:01:09.700> sometimes<00:01:10.150> I'd<00:01:10.570> collect<00:01:10.990> plants

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
plant sometimes I'd collect plants

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.100 
plant sometimes I'd collect plants
sometimes<00:01:12.460> we'd<00:01:12.760> go<00:01:12.970> out<00:01:13.150> and<00:01:13.450> walk<00:01:13.660> around

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.110 
sometimes we'd go out and walk around

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:18.000 
sometimes we'd go out and walk around
his<00:01:14.920> yard<00:01:14.950> or<00:01:15.850> the<00:01:16.300> area<00:01:16.990> around<00:01:17.290> Mount<00:01:17.590> Newton

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:18.010 
his yard or the area around Mount Newton

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:20.160 
his yard or the area around Mount Newton
where<00:01:18.250> he<00:01:18.370> lived<00:01:18.610> and<00:01:18.850> just<00:01:18.880> look<00:01:19.840> at<00:01:20.020> the

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.170 
where he lived and just look at the

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.560 
where he lived and just look at the
plants<00:01:20.620> as<00:01:20.770> they<00:01:20.950> grew<00:01:21.280> and<00:01:21.610> talked<00:01:22.180> about

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:22.570 
plants as they grew and talked about

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:24.420 
plants as they grew and talked about
them<00:01:22.870> and<00:01:23.050> he<00:01:23.200> would<00:01:23.350> tell<00:01:23.590> me<00:01:23.770> their<00:01:23.950> names

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:24.430

them and he would tell me their names
and<00:01:25.380> stories<00:01:26.380> about<00:01:26.620> them<00:01:27.070> and<00:01:27.280> I<00:01:28.120> worked<00:01:28.660> with

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 
and stories about them and I worked with

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.170 
and stories about them and I worked with
a<00:01:28.900> tape<00:01:29.230> recorder<00:01:29.800> we<00:01:30.010> recorded<00:01:30.610> those<00:01:30.820> names

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:31.180 
a tape recorder we recorded those names

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.440 
a tape recorder we recorded those names
and<00:01:31.600> the<00:01:31.810> information<00:01:32.320> and<00:01:32.909> started<00:01:33.909> just

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
and the information and started just

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.840 
and the information and started just
kind<00:01:34.720> of<00:01:34.840> building<00:01:35.350> up<00:01:35.530> my<00:01:35.860> own<00:01:36.100> knowledge<00:01:36.460> and

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:36.850 
kind of building up my own knowledge and

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.770 
kind of building up my own knowledge and
understanding<00:01:37.840> about<00:01:38.800> them<00:01:39.100> from<00:01:39.600> from<00:01:40.600> what

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 
understanding about them from from what

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.440 
understanding about them from from what
Chris<00:01:41.080> taught<00:01:41.440> me<00:01:41.680> and<00:01:41.950> that's<00:01:42.610> essentially

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
Chris taught me and that's essentially

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.620 
Chris taught me and that's essentially
what<00:01:43.530> ethnobotany<00:01:44.530> is<00:01:44.980> that<00:01:45.310> that<00:01:45.700> is<00:01:45.940> the<00:01:46.210> the

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 
what ethnobotany is that that is the the

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.430 
what ethnobotany is that that is the the
primary<00:01:47.260> basic<00:01:47.920> field<00:01:48.640> research<00:01:49.210> that<00:01:49.720> you
