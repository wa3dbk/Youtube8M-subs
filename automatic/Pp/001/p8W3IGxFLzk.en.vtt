00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
that I got between now and June I wanted

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.859 
that I got between now and June I wanted
to<00:00:17.490> do<00:00:17.609> an<00:00:17.730> additional<00:00:18.119> reading<00:00:18.420> because<00:00:18.750> we

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
to do an additional reading because we

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.630 
to do an additional reading because we
have<00:00:18.960> two<00:00:19.140> celestial<00:00:19.680> events<00:00:20.070> happening<00:00:20.490> on

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
have two celestial events happening on

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.179 
have two celestial events happening on
the<00:00:20.760> 18th<00:00:21.180> we<00:00:21.689> have<00:00:21.779> a<00:00:21.840> new<00:00:21.960> moon<00:00:22.170> we<00:00:22.710> also<00:00:22.859> have

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
the 18th we have a new moon we also have

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.160 
the 18th we have a new moon we also have
a<00:00:23.460> mercury<00:00:23.820> retrograde<00:00:24.119> so<00:00:24.570> that<00:00:24.750> can<00:00:25.019> mean

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
a mercury retrograde so that can mean

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.990 
a mercury retrograde so that can mean
some<00:00:25.380> major<00:00:25.529> things<00:00:25.680> and<00:00:26.160> I<00:00:26.550> thought<00:00:26.760> it<00:00:26.880> would

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
some major things and I thought it would

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.179 
some major things and I thought it would
be<00:00:27.090> nice<00:00:27.210> to<00:00:27.660> do<00:00:28.019> one<00:00:28.320> additional<00:00:28.800> reading<00:00:29.070> and

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
be nice to do one additional reading and

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.589 
be nice to do one additional reading and
it's<00:00:29.279> going<00:00:29.400> to<00:00:29.490> go<00:00:29.609> between<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.000> two<00:00:30.269> months

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599

partnership opportunity that comes up

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.850 
partnership opportunity that comes up
there<00:01:37.829> could<00:01:38.070> be<00:01:38.100> quite<00:01:38.430> beneficial<00:01:39.470> in<00:01:40.470> fact

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
there could be quite beneficial in fact

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.010 
there could be quite beneficial in fact
I<00:01:41.430> do<00:01:42.000> see<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.360> king<00:01:42.509> of<00:01:42.570> Pentacles<00:01:42.720> in

I do see the king of Pentacles in
reverse<00:01:43.290> so<00:01:43.320> there's<00:01:43.590> a<00:01:43.649> little<00:01:43.740> bit<00:01:43.890> to<00:01:44.070> look

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
reverse so there's a little bit to look

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:45.920 
reverse so there's a little bit to look
at<00:01:44.369> there<00:01:44.520> but<00:01:44.700> I<00:01:44.729> do<00:01:44.820> think<00:01:45.149> that<00:01:45.270> it's<00:01:45.750> worth

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
at there but I do think that it's worth

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.550 
at there but I do think that it's worth
exploring<00:01:47.750> whatever<00:01:48.750> this<00:01:48.990> sort<00:01:49.500> of

exploring whatever this sort of
partnership<00:01:49.890> opportunity<00:01:50.670> is<00:01:50.820> I<00:01:51.570> feel<00:01:52.140> like
