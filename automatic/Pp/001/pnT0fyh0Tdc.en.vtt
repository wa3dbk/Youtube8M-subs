00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.440
 Welcome to the next one 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.930
 start video presentation and now it works 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.660
 it is about the city of the good franz 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.610
 someone who also streams and 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.290
 such things do and that became of 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.730
 a network of his viewers on it 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.949
 so heed this contest 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.000
 with me that means there is now one 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.350
 you have to be a little bit special 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.520
 decide if you have your vote for it 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.840
 I did not want to 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.010
 any winners i was not me 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.050
 sure if I should take it with me 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.460
 because that is not on the map tourist 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.949
 made and the condition we were doing 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.500
 the card jarvers and he had this 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.120
 City already started somehow before 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.469
 before i had in god and got me 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.880
 who then sent in said if you 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.170
 Of course, they all like to be there 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.700
 take with you if not then not 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.140
 but that's so good of the concept 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.620
 down when I said I will provide 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.420
 before you 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.340
 and if you say that's okay 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.600
 I'm stupid then you're allowed to vote 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.620
 Do not give that yours 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.910
 decision but I wanted you 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.770
 because we think the concept is very good 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.120
 So that's the city of 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.660
 Of course fans and we are looking first 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.579
 looks back on the optics concept 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.079
 you directly from above is a completely different one 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.430
 so they are all 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.140
 made different if I am very 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.300
 cool and yet they are all in a circle 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.129
 cities and here is the concept 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.920
 somehow special in that one 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:11.549
 here in the middle of a lake has one 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.710
 relatively large and I am currently 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.150
 ask like that with the water 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.000
 works because he sometime empty 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.409
 it would have to be out of here 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.030
 and there goes the river here somehow 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.369
 direction sea ​​or something 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.360
 That's why I'm curious or crazy 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.500
 I would like to know like that now 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.909
 does it work if somehow new 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.799
 water comes or if that is infinite 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.570
 In any case, the whole city is around 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.610
 arranged this small lake around it 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.630
 and then here with the river and me 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.860
 think it looks really cool 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.350
 is just as I said another 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.759
 card do not do what the other things are 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.740
 I do not count now so what 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.119
 there is still such a thing in the back or there or or 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.159
 here so but are now only 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.270
 This city ​​and I have to go all the way 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.530
 honest if you see it from above 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.290
 I think the concept is pretty pretty 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.759
 cool looks just like that 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.369
 also about which it is disposed of 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:56.219
 hammer here on the lake itself harder very much 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:59.219
 small houses less densely populated 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:02.610
 small cottage with garden and trees and 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:04.200
 here more like field roads even and that 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.520
 whole is rather a bit yes 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.120
 less densely populated and then to 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.950
 outside there come only then 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:10.780
 Skyscrapers there comes the whole 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.120
 the whole office buildings are coming 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.040
 the densely populated residential buildings and 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.650
 also that you are very much with a giant 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.300
 circle around this very much and 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.440
 skyscrapers anyway more than enough where 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.080
 I think the idea is also very cool 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.520
 one stops at the lake itself who lower 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.810
 has houses and not so densely populated 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.780
 areas and around the outside 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.190
 the huge skyscrapers and the whole 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.720
 should be pretty gigantic 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.630
 The dimensions are really big here 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.030
 this city is built what the numbers 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.170
 As you can see it almost 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.940
 85,000 inhabitants so it's a whole 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.530
 amount and this year really good 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.550
 So like all have rear 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.320
 agriculture and such things 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:45.610
 that's why they're all or well 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.220
 are all here in this area 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.780
 that means a very big one 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.240
 city or a very large one 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.440
 scratch with a lot of a population that 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.820
 somehow something special and 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.470
 again has something completely different 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:59.050
 I really like the bridges here 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.160
 that are so pulled over the river are real 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:01.810
 what he did, though 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.220
 apparently he has that 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.240
 But new unnecessary money will give us 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.020
 perfectly alright I said yes 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:07.090
 you can do that 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:09.160
 However, the machine had one too 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.020
 very negative balance but i think so 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.670
 that you can easily get that 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:13.810
 would toxic that should drive me 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:16.300
 by nine percent, we make the helper 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.070
 Let's try that out so if you can 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.209
 I was playing with the monthly money 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:21.250
 then you do not need the tax high 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:23.320
 put but it could be that the 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:26.200
 would actually run positively 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:27.340
 if you just play without money 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.780
 that means you can also 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.940
 probably but then you would have 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.140
 look now, I do not even know if 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.000
 you absolutely have to lower the budgets 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.970
 because maybe he has it too 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.350
 planned to try something 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:43.120
 happens when i go to the water budget 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:46.350
 Example of normal sentences whether you like 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:48.250
 then the water breaks down already 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:50.110
 Now it still seems to go so you 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.190
 can even put the budgets under without 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:54.280
 problems and I think if you have the 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:56.019
 So everything should only be lowered 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.970
 to 100 percent or so it was there was 

00:03:56.019 --> 00:04:00.040
 the city is still running because he tells you so 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:01.239
 has built but then you can see now 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:04.120
 So then the balance sheet would be massive 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:05.560
 in the plus at nearly 100000 or so he was 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.209
 Apparently just built with the money 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.260
 and then the budgets are set high 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:09.940
 but you could down and the 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.470
 city would still be running so far 

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:13.120
 yes, everything will be fine 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:14.170
 currently less good if you have 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.980
 someday no new houses were built 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:19.450
 then it will be less otherwise 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:21.280
 84,000 is pretty neat what 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:23.980
 tell us because the card stream is him 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.120
 given in any case and the garbage is 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:27.660
 Of course he also has supplies 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:29.620
 now all over here 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:31.420
 Guidelines entered in the whole 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.470
 quartered which makes people happier 

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:34.360
 are what but of course that again 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:36.730
 Costs are increasing 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:40.450
 now 460,000 plus so I mean 

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:42.580
 no topic then what do we have here 

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:43.990
 Density of course well built everything very much 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:47.530
 of course, just drop it inside 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:48.580
 a little less then the traffic jams 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:50.290
 I would say yes at first glance 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:52.210
 not so natural of course these 

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:53.530
 Field lanes are sometimes a bit more 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:54.970
 drive though many people long 

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:56.770
 must not fit so much 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:58.420
 through these paths and then it will come 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:00.180
 sometimes to smaller jams but nothing 

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:02.139
 serious here no giant 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:04.120
 node points regarding your traffic 

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:05.889
 here is the worst and there 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.570
 is still fluent so no 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:10.180
 serious congestion that looks good 

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:11.740
 then pollution only too 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:13.870
 nothing outside in the city all 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:16.330
 clean wonderful noise is also one 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:18.310
 okay because you have here partially 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:21.090
 on the precise of the office areas, a 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:23.530
 a little something but nothing serious 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:25.630
 Fire department is there the supply 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:26.980
 crime is okay too 

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:29.830
 he has too 

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:32.290
 Subway lines has the bus line has that 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:36.430
 is chic trains I see now 

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:37.960
 not yet , but yes, too 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:39.640
 to have dustin station somewhere 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:40.900
 But so really right in the 

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:42.070
 city ​​itself not there because especially u 

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:44.860
 used train also makes in one 

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:45.990
 City actually makes more sense subway too 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:48.520
 have as trains 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:50.050
 otherwise everything would be ok 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:51.220
 say or the cards look good 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:53.170
 Also, of course, every floor-standing value 

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:59.080
 see extremely high or everything 

00:05:53.170 --> 00:06:00.730
 perfect here and there would be good and parks 

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:01.720
 in the middle still good to do 

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:02.230
 otherwise he already has many 

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:03.880
 built 

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:05.290
 So there you always want a lot of 

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:05.920
 these parks and there you can not all 

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:07.660
 make happy 

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:09.070
 but that was pretty neat and 

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:10.360
 says visually I like it well because of it 

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:11.530
 stop also something completely different is 

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:12.700
 and it's cool idea I think 

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:14.650
 that you see the city around the lake 

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:16.330
 threaten to move and in the middle of this 

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:17.740
 Giant thing has men the beautiful the 

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:19.060
 people still have a bit of beach 

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:21.010
 or the very step in sometimes 

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:22.660
 can do it all very harshly now 

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:23.950
 do not want you to the water needs 

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:27.400
 probably that's pretty dirty 

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:29.770
 water but that feels good to me 

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:31.630
 Concept of fans and I would say 

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:33.280
 if you think that's the best of 

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:35.080
 all one of all presented 

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:36.850
 cities and you this city yours 

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:38.560
 wanted to agree then this would have to 

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:40.930
 video here with a thumbs up 

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:42.490
 Proven thumbs down do not count 

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:43.960
 if you do not like that please look 

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:45.280
 you but only to all cities that he 

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:46.870
 also know which you really am 

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:48.070

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:50.260
 go 

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:51.730
 that was a clear winner , too 

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:53.200
 I saw many 

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:55.360

 send in and as said when you say 

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:58.420
 that is nothing because that is not on the 

00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:00.160
 correct map was built 

00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:01.540
 then stop for another city 

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:02.650
 Bad, but I think that's very cool 

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:03.190
 I like the concept and the city 

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:04.780
 really good 

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:05.860

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:07.780
 Idea I'll show you now 

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:09.520
