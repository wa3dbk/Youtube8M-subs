 are not only serious but also 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.880
 determining the type of battle 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.649
 was changed this attack 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.239
 defense similar to the storm 

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:43.220
 attacking a team while that 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:45.050
 others defend the opportunities 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.150
 the defender must balance 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:50.000
 Team hold two bases instead of one 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:52.070
 the base conquest 2 each and 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.950
 not add up to victory handed it 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.870
 to take a basis 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:59.120
 the compilation are heavier the 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.160
 number of technology points is 54 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.549
 There are two levels of technology 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:06.740
 five stage 8 and 2 stage 7 machines 

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:12.890
 or six stage 8 tanks and one 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:15.229
 level 6 there is a new map 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:18.079
 stalingrad it is a historical map 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:19.939
 which lies on flat relief this is 

00:01:18.079 --> 00:01:22.189
 burned by the destroyed city 

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:24.289
 Buildings mountains of broken brick 

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:26.060
 and explosion level covered 

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:28.670
 in places, the ground is through 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.560
 protecting ditches covered near river 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.899
 it is a good thing that they are good for you 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.729
 Attack is suitable for the railway 

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:37.310
 to build a defense 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:39.770
 on the opposite side of the card there is 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.389
 also this question is well suited 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.130
 for a quick break in the middle 

00:01:41.389 --> 00:01:43.819
 The card is a place and flat 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.039
 building 

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:48.789
 Here are the bullet-changing are the panzer 

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:48.789
 occur 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.850
 the functionality of the fortresses became 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.799
 now extended this can be up to the level 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.229
 5 and higher to be expanded 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:02.090
 there is a possibility of achievements 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:02.719
 other luster to attack and to 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.609
 plunder 

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:06.649
 to me in the special training video 

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:14.930
 instruction to the fortress of building materials and 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:16.790
 five to ten dates of the tank t 34 3 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.879

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:23.299
 got from 14 4 seconds to 13 4 

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:26.660
 seconds shortens the spread in storm 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:28.940
 brought was reduced by 25 percent at 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:33.140
 merck Banzer was 15:00 was the 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:35.090

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.760
 placement was also maximum eight 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:40.090
 reduces the s was for luck on the
