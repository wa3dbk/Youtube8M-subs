(Disco music in the background.)

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.840
What we skate under is 
the Women's Flat Track

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.840
Derby Association. That's the governing body

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.840
over our type of roller derby. And it is women only.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:51.840
For banked track, seen in the 70's &amp; 80's,

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.840
it's mixed gender but they're
very renegade, and their rules,

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.140
they don't have as many rules
as we do. And their governing

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.140
body is more forgiving
with regards to fighting and

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.140
things of that nature. So that's 
why when you come to this

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.140
type it's Women's Flat Track Derby.

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.140
That's the governing body and that's
who you're gonna see.

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.140
(Disco Music)

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:25.140
(Crowd cheers)
Announcer: Jammer on Jammer action right there!

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.140
Crowd: ooooohhhh!
Fan: Go! Go! Go! Go!

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.140
Legal target zones are from
your shoulder to your elbow

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:01.140
and from your hip to your knee.

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.140
You have to hit with this part 
of your body only.

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.140
Anything with your forearms,
elbows, hitting above the neck...

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.140
Those things are illegal and can
get you sent to the penalty box.

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.140
(Dramatic disco music
with rhythmic bass line.)

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.140
(Crowd Cheers)
Announcer: Shiv...your lead jammer!

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.140
When I was in Nebraska alot of really

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.140
strong women in our community

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.140
in Lincoln were playing roller derby

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.140
and I thought it looked really awesome
and empowering. So I don't know, 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:15.140
I wanted to be better friends with them.
So I joined (roller derby)and I loved it.

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.140
I used to watch this reality show
called 'Roller Girls' that came on A&amp;E.

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:23.140
And I just got hooked on it. I said,
'I have to play this sport!'

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.140
And I googled: 'roller derby in Atlanta'

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.140
and when 'roller girls' came up, I tried
out, got in, and the rest is history.

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:34.140
(dramatic music with hard 
  driving bass line.)
