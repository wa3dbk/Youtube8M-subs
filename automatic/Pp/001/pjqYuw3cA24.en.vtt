working on getting a couple things done
one<00:00:15.480> of<00:00:15.509> which<00:00:15.780> is<00:00:16.020> getting<00:00:16.260> water<00:00:16.529> in<00:00:16.800> the

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
one of which is getting water in the

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.880 
one of which is getting water in the
barn<00:00:17.390> second<00:00:18.390> project<00:00:18.570> will<00:00:19.020> obviously<00:00:19.529> be

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
barn second project will obviously be

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.320 
barn second project will obviously be
the<00:00:20.070> heated<00:00:20.369> floors<00:00:20.400> and<00:00:20.910> third<00:00:21.060> project

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
the heated floors and third project

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.660 
the heated floors and third project
would<00:00:21.660> be<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:21.930> tack<00:00:22.170> room<00:00:22.250> so<00:00:23.250> right<00:00:23.460> now

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
would be the tack room so right now

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.240 
would be the tack room so right now
basically<00:00:24.600> what<00:00:25.050> I'm<00:00:25.140> showing<00:00:25.350> you<00:00:25.500> is<00:00:25.650> is<00:00:25.920> the

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
basically what I'm showing you is is the

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.509 
basically what I'm showing you is is the
installation<00:00:27.000> here<00:00:27.570> of<00:00:27.750> the<00:00:27.900> waterline<00:00:28.710> we

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
installation here of the waterline we

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.250 
installation here of the waterline we
decided<00:00:29.970> we'd<00:00:30.119> pull<00:00:30.330> it<00:00:30.480> off<00:00:30.599> the<00:00:30.779> farmhouse

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
decided we'd pull it off the farmhouse

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.359 
decided we'd pull it off the farmhouse
because<00:00:31.590> it<00:00:31.710> has<00:00:31.859> a<00:00:31.890> one<00:00:32.130> and<00:00:32.160> a<00:00:32.340> half

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
because it has a one and a half

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.540 
because it has a one and a half
horsepower<00:00:32.880> pump<00:00:33.390> off<00:00:33.600> of<00:00:33.750> well<00:00:33.899> so<00:00:34.649> we<00:00:35.309> had<00:00:35.430> to

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
horsepower pump off of well so we had to

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.190 
horsepower pump off of well so we had to
get<00:00:35.670> over<00:00:35.700> to<00:00:35.910> the<00:00:36.030> farmhouse<00:00:36.329> which<00:00:36.630> is<00:00:36.750> 200

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
get over to the farmhouse which is 200

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.610 
get over to the farmhouse which is 200
feet<00:00:37.350> away

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
feet away

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.790 
feet away
so<00:00:38.550> we<00:00:38.640> used<00:00:38.790> a<00:00:38.910> Kubota<00:00:39.410> dug<00:00:40.410> about<00:00:40.559> an

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
so we used a Kubota dug about an

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.010 
so we used a Kubota dug about an
eight-foot<00:00:41.190> hole<00:00:41.399> and<00:00:41.730> then<00:00:42.239> we<00:00:42.480> brought<00:00:42.719> in<00:00:42.930> a

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
eight-foot hole and then we brought in a

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.900 
eight-foot hole and then we brought in a
professional<00:00:43.590> horizontal<00:00:44.160> boring<00:00:44.430> machine

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
professional horizontal boring machine

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.069 
professional horizontal boring machine
kind<00:00:45.870> of<00:00:45.989> a<00:00:46.110> big<00:00:46.710> ditch<00:00:47.250> which<00:00:47.550> monster<00:00:48.210> it's

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
kind of a big ditch which monster it's

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.920 
kind of a big ditch which monster it's
really<00:00:49.410> kind<00:00:49.590> of<00:00:49.620> an<00:00:49.739> interesting<00:00:49.829> machine

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:50.930 
really kind of an interesting machine

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.479 
really kind of an interesting machine
basically<00:00:51.930> we<00:00:52.050> backed<00:00:52.710> up<00:00:52.980> from<00:00:53.129> our<00:00:53.340> hole

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
basically we backed up from our hole

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.299 
basically we backed up from our hole
about<00:00:53.820> 20<00:00:54.239> feet<00:00:54.510> and<00:00:54.750> started<00:00:55.649> drilling<00:00:55.949> kind

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
about 20 feet and started drilling kind

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.790 
about 20 feet and started drilling kind
of<00:00:56.399> horizontally<00:00:57.180> and<00:00:57.300> Andy<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.289> even<00:00:58.530> a

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
of horizontally and Andy and even a

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.670 
of horizontally and Andy and even a
little<00:00:59.039> bit<00:00:59.250> down<00:00:59.489> so<00:01:00.000> in<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.840> course<00:01:01.050> of<00:01:01.199> 200

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
little bit down so in the course of 200

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.929 
little bit down so in the course of 200
feet<00:01:02.030> we<00:01:03.030> dropped<00:01:03.420> down<00:01:03.750> into<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.409> ground

00:01:04.929 --> 00:01:04.939 
feet we dropped down into the ground

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:07.429 
feet we dropped down into the ground
several<00:01:05.939> feet<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.750> get<00:01:06.900> underneath<00:01:07.200> the

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
several feet to get underneath the

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.380 
several feet to get underneath the
footing<00:01:07.740> of<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:07.920> farmhouse<00:01:08.250> and<00:01:08.700> come<00:01:09.240> up

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
footing of the farmhouse and come up

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.240 
footing of the farmhouse and come up
where<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.720> actual<00:01:10.140> well<00:01:10.380> comes<00:01:10.770> up<00:01:10.950> into<00:01:11.159> the

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
where the actual well comes up into the

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.030 
where the actual well comes up into the
house<00:01:11.430> so<00:01:11.700> we<00:01:11.790> could<00:01:11.909> attach<00:01:12.210> to<00:01:12.240> it<00:01:12.630> so<00:01:13.320> you

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
house so we could attach to it so you

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.850 
house so we could attach to it so you
know<00:01:14.159> probably<00:01:15.150> dropped<00:01:15.720> about<00:01:15.960> you<00:01:16.439> know<00:01:16.560> 10

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
know probably dropped about you know 10

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.910 
know probably dropped about you know 10
feet<00:01:17.130> over<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.700> course<00:01:17.939> of<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.180> 200<00:01:18.689> feet<00:01:18.920> in

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
feet over the course of the 200 feet in

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.560 
feet over the course of the 200 feet in
the<00:01:20.100> process<00:01:20.580> of<00:01:20.700> getting<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:21.060> line<00:01:21.240> what

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
the process of getting the line what

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.840 
the process of getting the line what
they<00:01:21.689> basically<00:01:22.049> did<00:01:22.350> is<00:01:22.380> they<00:01:23.369> took<00:01:23.520> pipe

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
they basically did is they took pipe

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.020 
they basically did is they took pipe
with<00:01:24.330> a<00:01:24.360> water<00:01:25.170> bore<00:01:25.530> tip<00:01:26.369> on<00:01:26.610> it<00:01:26.640> so<00:01:26.880> it's

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
with a water bore tip on it so it's

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.520 
with a water bore tip on it so it's
shooting<00:01:27.330> water<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:27.810> it's<00:01:27.930> it's<00:01:28.200> chewing

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
shooting water and it's it's chewing

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.140 
shooting water and it's it's chewing
away<00:01:28.740> at<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:28.950> dirt<00:01:29.130> at<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.310> same<00:01:29.549> time<00:01:29.850> and

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
away at the dirt at the same time and

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.120 
away at the dirt at the same time and
they<00:01:30.540> keep<00:01:30.720> adding<00:01:31.079> extensions<00:01:31.650> to<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:31.920> pipe

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
they keep adding extensions to the pipe

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.280 
they keep adding extensions to the pipe
and<00:01:32.400> they<00:01:33.210> keep<00:01:33.390> pushing<00:01:33.840> this<00:01:33.930> into<00:01:34.200> the

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
and they keep pushing this into the

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.780 
and they keep pushing this into the
ground<00:01:34.470> and<00:01:34.799> then<00:01:34.920> of<00:01:35.009> course<00:01:35.070> tearing<00:01:35.670> it

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
ground and then of course tearing it

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.530 
ground and then of course tearing it
electronically<00:01:36.479> based<00:01:36.659> upon<00:01:37.020> their<00:01:38.540> locators

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540

tank down there and we drilled in

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.280 
tank down there and we drilled in
through<00:01:53.759> the<00:01:53.880> concrete<00:01:54.090> floor<00:01:54.689> with<00:01:55.259> a

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
through the concrete floor with a

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.800 
through the concrete floor with a
jackhammer<00:01:55.969> so<00:01:56.969> that<00:01:57.090> we<00:01:57.180> could<00:01:57.360> get<00:01:57.479> access

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
jackhammer so that we could get access

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.340 
jackhammer so that we could get access
to<00:01:58.380> that<00:01:59.100> area<00:01:59.430> where<00:01:59.670> that<00:02:00.030> water<00:02:00.810> line<00:02:01.110> is

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
to that area where that water line is

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:02.780 
to that area where that water line is
going<00:02:01.530> to<00:02:01.590> be<00:02:01.710> coming<00:02:01.950> through<00:02:02.070> from<00:02:02.640> the

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
going to be coming through from the

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.999 
going to be coming through from the
ditch<00:02:02.939> which<00:02:03.380> took<00:02:04.380> us<00:02:04.530> a<00:02:04.560> little<00:02:04.710> bit<00:02:04.860> of

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
ditch which took us a little bit of

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.730 
ditch which took us a little bit of
effort<00:02:05.390> punching<00:02:06.390> through<00:02:06.630> a<00:02:06.740> reinforced

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
effort punching through a reinforced

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.499 
effort punching through a reinforced
rebar<00:02:08.099> floor<00:02:08.489> that's<00:02:08.759> five<00:02:09.239> and<00:02:09.270> a<00:02:09.479> half

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
rebar floor that's five and a half

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.050 
rebar floor that's five and a half
inches<00:02:09.929> thick<00:02:09.959> concrete<00:02:10.410> is<00:02:10.830> is<00:02:11.640> a<00:02:11.670> little<00:02:11.940> bit

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
inches thick concrete is is a little bit

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.880 
inches thick concrete is is a little bit
of<00:02:12.150> work<00:02:12.300> but<00:02:12.330> jackhammer<00:02:13.230> got<00:02:13.470> through

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
of work but jackhammer got through

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.800 
of work but jackhammer got through
we<00:02:13.950> got<00:02:14.100> about<00:02:14.190> a<00:02:14.310> foot<00:02:14.580> by<00:02:14.819> foot<00:02:15.540> hole

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
we got about a foot by foot hole

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.080 
we got about a foot by foot hole
eventually<00:02:16.800> punched<00:02:17.310> in<00:02:17.430> it<00:02:17.550> right<00:02:17.700> next<00:02:17.850> to

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
eventually punched in it right next to

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.750 
eventually punched in it right next to
the<00:02:18.180> well<00:02:18.330> line<00:02:18.830> so<00:02:19.830> basically<00:02:20.220> we've<00:02:20.459> got<00:02:20.640> the

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
the well line so basically we've got the

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.210 
the well line so basically we've got the
well<00:02:20.940> outside<00:02:21.420> it<00:02:22.050> comes<00:02:22.440> into<00:02:22.680> the<00:02:22.770> basement

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
well outside it comes into the basement

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.059 
well outside it comes into the basement
into<00:02:23.459> the<00:02:24.030> main<00:02:24.209> tank<00:02:24.510> and<00:02:24.840> then<00:02:25.380> at<00:02:25.680> the<00:02:25.890> main

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
into the main tank and then at the main

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:28.640 
into the main tank and then at the main
tank<00:02:26.400> we're<00:02:26.970> going<00:02:27.090> to<00:02:27.150> tie<00:02:27.360> into<00:02:27.750> it<00:02:27.780> and<00:02:28.080> send

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
tank we're going to tie into it and send

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.470 
tank we're going to tie into it and send
it<00:02:28.740> over<00:02:28.830> to<00:02:29.190> the<00:02:30.030> barn

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
it over to the barn

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.440 
it over to the barn
so<00:02:31.200> once<00:02:31.350> we<00:02:31.500> got<00:02:31.760> through<00:02:32.760> there<00:02:32.970> got<00:02:33.240> the

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
so once we got through there got the

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.320 
so once we got through there got the
gravel<00:02:34.020> removed<00:02:34.560> this<00:02:35.340> particular<00:02:35.640> floor<00:02:36.060> has

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
gravel removed this particular floor has

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.180 
gravel removed this particular floor has
a<00:02:36.360> foam<00:02:36.690> core<00:02:36.990> door<00:02:37.200> to<00:02:37.440> sway<00:02:37.680> to<00:02:37.709> get<00:02:37.890> that<00:02:38.070> out

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
a foam core door to sway to get that out

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:39.979 
a foam core door to sway to get that out
of<00:02:38.220> the<00:02:38.340> way<00:02:38.430> then<00:02:38.970> we<00:02:39.000> were<00:02:39.209> able<00:02:39.300> to<00:02:39.450> take<00:02:39.720> a

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
of the way then we were able to take a

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:44.420 
of the way then we were able to take a
one-inch<00:02:40.560> 200<00:02:41.130> psi<00:02:41.700> our<00:02:42.270> water<00:02:42.720> line<00:02:42.989> and<00:02:43.430> hook

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
one-inch 200 psi our water line and hook

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.790 
one-inch 200 psi our water line and hook
it<00:02:44.580> up<00:02:44.730> to<00:02:45.600> the<00:02:45.780> ditch<00:02:45.959> which<00:02:46.230> which<00:02:46.470> is<00:02:46.650> now

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
it up to the ditch which which is now

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.370 
it up to the ditch which which is now
Metis<00:02:47.330> it's<00:02:48.330> underneath<00:02:48.660> the<00:02:48.780> house<00:02:48.989> at<00:02:49.230> this

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
Metis it's underneath the house at this

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.910 
Metis it's underneath the house at this
point<00:02:49.500> and<00:02:49.980> then<00:02:50.550> we're<00:02:51.300> able<00:02:51.420> to<00:02:51.780> take<00:02:52.530> the

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
point and then we're able to take the

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.949 
point and then we're able to take the
ditch<00:02:53.070> which<00:02:53.310> and<00:02:53.550> pull<00:02:53.850> the<00:02:54.000> piping<00:02:54.390> back<00:02:54.600> and

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
ditch which and pull the piping back and

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:56.780 
ditch which and pull the piping back and
of<00:02:55.380> course<00:02:55.560> it's<00:02:55.709> got<00:02:55.830> the<00:02:55.980> special<00:02:56.370> adapter

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
of course it's got the special adapter

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.759 
of course it's got the special adapter
which<00:02:56.910> grabs<00:02:57.209> onto<00:02:57.420> the<00:02:57.600> blue<00:02:57.750> tubing<00:02:58.140> and<00:02:58.260> it

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
which grabs onto the blue tubing and it

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:00.590 
which grabs onto the blue tubing and it
literally<00:02:59.100> pulls<00:02:59.519> the<00:02:59.730> blue<00:02:59.910> tubing<00:03:00.300> from<00:03:00.450> the

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
literally pulls the blue tubing from the

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.190 
literally pulls the blue tubing from the
basement<00:03:01.050> all<00:03:01.920> the<00:03:02.190> way<00:03:02.280> back<00:03:02.459> up<00:03:02.489> to<00:03:02.700> the<00:03:02.970> barn

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
basement all the way back up to the barn

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.199 
basement all the way back up to the barn
which<00:03:04.200> is<00:03:04.410> it's<00:03:04.860> it's<00:03:05.280> really<00:03:05.700> probably<00:03:06.060> the

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
which is it's it's really probably the

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:08.150 
which is it's it's really probably the
best<00:03:06.390> way<00:03:06.570> doing<00:03:06.840> this<00:03:06.959> now<00:03:07.500> granted<00:03:07.860> you

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
best way doing this now granted you

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.530 
best way doing this now granted you
could<00:03:08.370> have<00:03:08.459> done<00:03:08.610> a<00:03:08.640> vertical<00:03:09.090> deal<00:03:09.269> where

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
could have done a vertical deal where

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.990 
could have done a vertical deal where
you<00:03:09.660> take<00:03:10.200> the<00:03:10.350> backhoe<00:03:10.830> and<00:03:10.860> dug<00:03:11.700> alongside

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
you take the backhoe and dug alongside

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.440 
you take the backhoe and dug alongside
of<00:03:12.600> the<00:03:12.660> well<00:03:12.870> outside<00:03:13.530> the<00:03:13.739> farm<00:03:14.269> found<00:03:15.269> the

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
of the well outside the farm found the

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.630 
of the well outside the farm found the
base<00:03:15.600> of<00:03:15.840> it<00:03:15.989> tied<00:03:16.320> into<00:03:16.590> there<00:03:16.830> and<00:03:17.130> gone

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
base of it tied into there and gone

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.250 
base of it tied into there and gone
straight<00:03:18.120> across<00:03:18.360> over<00:03:18.810> to<00:03:18.900> the<00:03:18.989> barn<00:03:19.170> that

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
straight across over to the barn that

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.050 
straight across over to the barn that
way<00:03:19.590> but<00:03:20.250> it<00:03:20.340> would<00:03:20.400> have<00:03:20.489> been<00:03:20.579> a<00:03:20.670> lot<00:03:20.880> more

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
way but it would have been a lot more

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.900 
way but it would have been a lot more
digging<00:03:21.360> and<00:03:21.980> it<00:03:22.980> would<00:03:23.340> have<00:03:23.489> been<00:03:23.610> is<00:03:23.730> nice

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
digging and it would have been is nice

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.430 
digging and it would have been is nice
for<00:03:24.150> us<00:03:24.239> because<00:03:24.600> this<00:03:24.780> way<00:03:24.959> we've<00:03:25.140> got<00:03:25.290> all

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
for us because this way we've got all

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.949 
for us because this way we've got all
the<00:03:25.560> shutoffs<00:03:25.920> in<00:03:26.130> one<00:03:26.280> location<00:03:26.780> which<00:03:27.780> is

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
the shutoffs in one location which is

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:29.960 
the shutoffs in one location which is
quite<00:03:28.170> convenient<00:03:28.530> in<00:03:29.280> the<00:03:29.430> basement<00:03:29.850> of<00:03:29.880> the

quite convenient in the basement of the

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.840 
quite convenient in the basement of the
farmhouse<00:03:30.269> and<00:03:30.660> we<00:03:30.840> have<00:03:30.959> access<00:03:31.350> to<00:03:31.530> it

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:31.850

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
hit a breaker this is the hole we dug

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.949 
hit a breaker this is the hole we dug
inside<00:03:37.500> the<00:03:37.860> barn<00:03:38.100> it's<00:03:38.459> so<00:03:38.760> seven<00:03:39.600> eight<00:03:39.720> feet

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
inside the barn it's so seven eight feet

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:42.259 
inside the barn it's so seven eight feet
deep<00:03:40.019> and<00:03:40.500> you<00:03:41.160> can<00:03:41.280> see<00:03:41.489> there<00:03:41.730> there's<00:03:41.970> the

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:42.269 
deep and you can see there there's the

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:45.080 
deep and you can see there there's the
the<00:03:43.200> blue<00:03:43.410> tubing<00:03:43.799> that<00:03:43.980> got<00:03:44.160> pulled<00:03:44.459> so

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
the blue tubing that got pulled so

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:46.190 
the blue tubing that got pulled so
basically<00:03:45.480> what<00:03:45.660> we're<00:03:45.750> going<00:03:45.840> to<00:03:45.900> do<00:03:46.019> right

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
basically what we're going to do right

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.110 
basically what we're going to do right
now<00:03:46.230> is<00:03:46.560> we're<00:03:46.680> going<00:03:46.769> to<00:03:46.829> cut<00:03:47.459> that<00:03:47.670> and<00:03:47.910> we're

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
now is we're going to cut that and we're

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.580 
now is we're going to cut that and we're
going<00:03:48.209> to<00:03:48.299> cut<00:03:48.480> out<00:03:48.570> about<00:03:48.810> a<00:03:48.840> four<00:03:49.140> inch<00:03:49.320> piece

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
going to cut out about a four inch piece

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.360 
going to cut out about a four inch piece
so<00:03:50.250> that<00:03:50.370> we<00:03:50.489> can<00:03:50.640> put<00:03:50.880> our<00:03:51.680> frost<00:03:52.680> faucet<00:03:53.220> in

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
so that we can put our frost faucet in

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.550 
so that we can put our frost faucet in
and<00:03:53.579> then<00:03:54.090> that's<00:03:54.269> going<00:03:54.420> to<00:03:54.480> be<00:03:54.570> about<00:03:54.870> seven

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
and then that's going to be about seven

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:56.840 
and then that's going to be about seven
feet<00:03:55.739> down<00:03:56.010> on<00:03:56.130> the<00:03:56.190> ground<00:03:56.430> so<00:03:56.610> it's<00:03:56.730> never

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
feet down on the ground so it's never

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:58.220 
feet down on the ground so it's never
going<00:03:57.030> to<00:03:57.090> freeze<00:03:57.329> anyways<00:03:57.750> and<00:03:57.959> of<00:03:58.019> course

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
going to freeze anyways and of course

00:03:58.230 --> 00:03:59.569 
going to freeze anyways and of course
the<00:03:58.380> floor<00:03:58.590> on<00:03:58.739> this<00:03:58.860> is<00:03:59.040> going<00:03:59.220> to<00:03:59.280> be<00:03:59.370> heated

00:03:59.569 --> 00:03:59.579 
the floor on this is going to be heated

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:04.490 
the floor on this is going to be heated
so<00:03:59.970> it<00:04:00.690> should<00:04:01.350> be<00:04:01.380> fairly<00:04:01.950> safe<00:04:03.110> once<00:04:04.110> we<00:04:04.290> cut

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
so it should be fairly safe once we cut

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.310 
so it should be fairly safe once we cut
it<00:04:04.650> we<00:04:05.070> had<00:04:05.190> to<00:04:05.280> put<00:04:05.430> our<00:04:05.549> clamps<00:04:05.970> on<00:04:06.150> it<00:04:06.360> and

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:07.320 
it we had to put our clamps on it and

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:11.150 
it we had to put our clamps on it and
then<00:04:07.530> get<00:04:07.769> the<00:04:08.010> frost<00:04:08.850> faucet<00:04:09.450> in<00:04:10.010> the<00:04:11.010> whole

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
then get the frost faucet in the whole

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.610 
then get the frost faucet in the whole
process<00:04:11.430> went<00:04:11.880> pretty<00:04:12.329> good<00:04:12.570> I'd<00:04:12.870> say<00:04:13.170> we<00:04:13.440> had

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
process went pretty good I'd say we had

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.680 
process went pretty good I'd say we had
it<00:04:13.739> all<00:04:13.859> done<00:04:14.160> and<00:04:14.459> probably<00:04:14.910> about<00:04:15.060> four

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
it all done and probably about four

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:19.069 
it all done and probably about four
hours<00:04:16.049> give<00:04:16.620> or<00:04:16.650> take<00:04:16.890> maybe<00:04:17.160> it<00:04:17.340> was<00:04:17.459> five<00:04:18.079> but

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:19.079 
hours give or take maybe it was five but

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:20.810 
hours give or take maybe it was five but
it<00:04:19.200> was<00:04:19.289> a<00:04:19.320> good<00:04:19.739> way<00:04:19.890> of<00:04:19.919> getting<00:04:20.190> water<00:04:20.609> to

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
it was a good way of getting water to

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:24.440 
it was a good way of getting water to
the<00:04:20.910> barn<00:04:21.120> we<00:04:22.080> did<00:04:22.289> take<00:04:22.500> a<00:04:23.340> five<00:04:23.880> gallon<00:04:24.090> pail

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
the barn we did take a five gallon pail

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:26.690 
the barn we did take a five gallon pail
after<00:04:25.289> we<00:04:25.380> put<00:04:25.560> all<00:04:25.650> the<00:04:25.770> peat<00:04:25.950> gravel<00:04:26.310> in<00:04:26.460> and

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:26.700 
after we put all the peat gravel in and

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:27.320 
after we put all the peat gravel in and
stuck<00:04:26.940> that

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
stuck that

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.990 
stuck that
right<00:04:27.750> on<00:04:27.900> top<00:04:28.080> of<00:04:28.110> the<00:04:28.319> fitting<00:04:28.699> just<00:04:29.699> giving

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.000 
right on top of the fitting just giving

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.790 
right on top of the fitting just giving
it<00:04:30.090> some<00:04:30.300> protection<00:04:30.479> other<00:04:31.289> people<00:04:31.680> have

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 
it some protection other people have

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.950 
it some protection other people have
done<00:04:31.979> this<00:04:32.159> it's<00:04:32.400> worked<00:04:32.610> well<00:04:32.819> and<00:04:33.720> then<00:04:33.870> we

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
done this it's worked well and then we

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:38.059 
done this it's worked well and then we
took<00:04:34.110> a<00:04:34.169> big<00:04:34.830> four-inch<00:04:35.400> PVC<00:04:35.699> pipe<00:04:37.069> scheduled

00:04:38.059 --> 00:04:38.069 
took a big four-inch PVC pipe scheduled

00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:39.559 
took a big four-inch PVC pipe scheduled
for<00:04:38.340> tea<00:04:38.460> and<00:04:38.580> just<00:04:38.669> dropped<00:04:39.000> it<00:04:39.180> in<00:04:39.270> just<00:04:39.509> to

00:04:39.559 --> 00:04:39.569 
for tea and just dropped it in just to

00:04:39.569 --> 00:04:41.570 
for tea and just dropped it in just to
help<00:04:39.720> protect<00:04:40.139> the<00:04:40.470> post<00:04:40.710> particularly<00:04:41.400> even

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580 
help protect the post particularly even

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.939 
help protect the post particularly even
during<00:04:41.729> backfill<00:04:42.330> and<00:04:42.569> then<00:04:43.050> we<00:04:43.169> took<00:04:43.349> the

00:04:43.939 --> 00:04:43.949 
during backfill and then we took the

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:46.999 
during backfill and then we took the
Kubota<00:04:44.340> u17<00:04:45.150> and<00:04:45.389> we<00:04:45.900> just<00:04:46.080> pounded<00:04:46.770> the<00:04:46.860> dirt

00:04:46.999 --> 00:04:47.009 
Kubota u17 and we just pounded the dirt

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:49.040 
Kubota u17 and we just pounded the dirt
around<00:04:47.159> it<00:04:47.490> and<00:04:47.669> pushed<00:04:48.360> it<00:04:48.479> all<00:04:48.629> back<00:04:48.810> the

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
around it and pushed it all back the

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.320 
around it and pushed it all back the
best<00:04:49.229> we<00:04:49.379> can<00:04:49.590> really<00:04:50.280> want<00:04:50.490> to<00:04:50.639> compact<00:04:51.060> it<00:04:51.210> as

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330 
best we can really want to compact it as

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.390 
best we can really want to compact it as
much<00:04:51.509> as<00:04:51.659> we<00:04:51.750> can<00:04:51.960> because<00:04:52.139> we'd<00:04:52.319> like<00:04:52.470> to<00:04:52.650> pour

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.400 
much as we can because we'd like to pour

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:54.800 
much as we can because we'd like to pour
concrete<00:04:53.610> floor<00:04:54.180> which<00:04:54.389> we're<00:04:54.690> in<00:04:54.750> the

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:54.810 
concrete floor which we're in the

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:56.119 
concrete floor which we're in the
process<00:04:55.139> of<00:04:55.199> right<00:04:55.409> now<00:04:55.560> we'll<00:04:55.800> show<00:04:55.949> you<00:04:55.979> the

00:04:56.119 --> 00:04:56.129 
process of right now we'll show you the

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:58.580 
process of right now we'll show you the
next<00:04:56.370> video<00:04:56.699> then<00:04:57.449> we<00:04:57.599> added<00:04:57.810> an<00:04:58.050> overflow

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
next video then we added an overflow

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:00.200 
next video then we added an overflow
drain<00:04:58.740> I<00:04:58.889> know<00:04:59.099> it<00:04:59.280> looks<00:04:59.460> tall<00:04:59.759> air<00:04:59.969> and<00:05:00.150> not

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:00.210 
drain I know it looks tall air and not

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:02.809 
drain I know it looks tall air and not
sunk<00:05:00.599> in<00:05:00.810> but<00:05:01.050> obviously<00:05:01.770> once<00:05:02.039> you<00:05:02.219> pour<00:05:02.699> the

00:05:02.809 --> 00:05:02.819 
sunk in but obviously once you pour the

00:05:02.819 --> 00:05:05.209 
sunk in but obviously once you pour the
concrete<00:05:03.000> it<00:05:03.330> will<00:05:03.419> look<00:05:03.539> different<00:05:04.039> back<00:05:05.039> at

00:05:05.209 --> 00:05:05.219 
concrete it will look different back at

00:05:05.219 --> 00:05:07.670 
concrete it will look different back at
the<00:05:05.310> farmhouse<00:05:05.669> here<00:05:06.289> made<00:05:07.289> a<00:05:07.319> little<00:05:07.469> bit<00:05:07.620> of

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680 
the farmhouse here made a little bit of

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.290 
the farmhouse here made a little bit of
a<00:05:07.770> mess<00:05:07.979> but<00:05:08.250> we<00:05:08.400> had<00:05:08.550> to<00:05:08.639> add<00:05:08.819> an<00:05:09.000> extra

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
a mess but we had to add an extra

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:12.499 
a mess but we had to add an extra
fitting<00:05:09.690> obviously<00:05:11.000> one<00:05:12.000> fitting<00:05:12.389> was

00:05:12.499 --> 00:05:12.509 
fitting obviously one fitting was

00:05:12.509 --> 00:05:14.869 
fitting obviously one fitting was
already<00:05:12.750> there<00:05:13.069> for<00:05:14.069> the<00:05:14.190> water<00:05:14.400> to<00:05:14.610> the<00:05:14.699> house

00:05:14.869 --> 00:05:14.879 
already there for the water to the house

00:05:14.879 --> 00:05:16.909 
already there for the water to the house
coming<00:05:15.449> in<00:05:15.539> from<00:05:15.719> the<00:05:15.840> well<00:05:15.960> but<00:05:16.500> we<00:05:16.620> had<00:05:16.770> to

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:16.919 
coming in from the well but we had to

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:18.499 
coming in from the well but we had to
add<00:05:17.009> another<00:05:17.370> fitting<00:05:17.699> obviously<00:05:18.270> to<00:05:18.360> head

00:05:18.499 --> 00:05:18.509 
add another fitting obviously to head

00:05:18.509 --> 00:05:20.719 
add another fitting obviously to head
out<00:05:18.629> to<00:05:18.659> the<00:05:18.990> to<00:05:19.590> the<00:05:19.680> barn<00:05:19.919> and<00:05:20.219> of<00:05:20.400> course<00:05:20.580> we

00:05:20.719 --> 00:05:20.729 
out to the to the barn and of course we

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:23.089 
out to the to the barn and of course we
wanted<00:05:21.030> a<00:05:21.120> on/off<00:05:21.870> valve<00:05:22.199> on<00:05:22.409> it<00:05:22.560> for<00:05:22.830> an

00:05:23.089 --> 00:05:23.099 
wanted a on/off valve on it for an

00:05:23.099 --> 00:05:25.670 
wanted a on/off valve on it for an
emergency<00:05:23.370> shutoff<00:05:23.969> once<00:05:24.960> we<00:05:25.139> get<00:05:25.289> that<00:05:25.500> all

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:25.680 
emergency shutoff once we get that all

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.140 
emergency shutoff once we get that all
in<00:05:25.889> place<00:05:25.919> then<00:05:26.520> it's<00:05:26.639> just<00:05:26.729> a<00:05:26.879> matter<00:05:27.030> of

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:27.150 
in place then it's just a matter of

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:30.439 
in place then it's just a matter of
heating<00:05:27.539> up<00:05:27.690> these<00:05:28.250> you<00:05:29.250> know<00:05:29.370> water<00:05:29.879> tubing's

00:05:30.439 --> 00:05:30.449 
heating up these you know water tubing's

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:34.939 
heating up these you know water tubing's
putting<00:05:31.229> them<00:05:31.319> on<00:05:31.469> these<00:05:32.340> are<00:05:33.830> fittings<00:05:34.830> that

00:05:34.939 --> 00:05:34.949 
putting them on these are fittings that

00:05:34.949 --> 00:05:37.100 
putting them on these are fittings that
go<00:05:35.099> on<00:05:35.219> fairly<00:05:35.729> snug<00:05:35.940> and<00:05:36.479> once<00:05:36.750> they<00:05:36.930> cool

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:37.110 
go on fairly snug and once they cool

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:38.899 
go on fairly snug and once they cool
down<00:05:37.349> they<00:05:37.529> don't<00:05:37.680> really<00:05:37.770> come<00:05:37.949> off<00:05:38.190> and<00:05:38.430> then

00:05:38.899 --> 00:05:38.909 
down they don't really come off and then

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:41.839 
down they don't really come off and then
you<00:05:39.029> clamp<00:05:39.330> it<00:05:39.509> on<00:05:39.599> for<00:05:39.930> safety<00:05:40.610> once<00:05:41.610> we<00:05:41.729> got

00:05:41.839 --> 00:05:41.849 
you clamp it on for safety once we got

00:05:41.849 --> 00:05:43.999 
you clamp it on for safety once we got
all<00:05:42.000> that<00:05:42.150> done<00:05:42.389> we<00:05:43.050> just<00:05:43.199> had<00:05:43.319> to<00:05:43.500> make<00:05:43.979> sure

00:05:43.999 --> 00:05:44.009 
all that done we just had to make sure

00:05:44.009 --> 00:05:45.499 
all that done we just had to make sure
the<00:05:44.250> pressure<00:05:44.460> was<00:05:44.729> set<00:05:44.940> where<00:05:45.090> we<00:05:45.180> wanted

00:05:45.499 --> 00:05:45.509 
the pressure was set where we wanted

00:05:45.509 --> 00:05:47.990 
the pressure was set where we wanted
which<00:05:45.630> is<00:05:45.659> 60<00:05:46.139> psi<00:05:46.620> to<00:05:46.680> the<00:05:46.889> barn<00:05:47.099> and<00:05:47.340> then

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:48.000 
which is 60 psi to the barn and then

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.149 
which is 60 psi to the barn and then
certainly<00:05:48.389> it<00:05:48.539> was<00:05:48.690> all<00:05:48.960> about<00:05:49.169> water<00:05:49.620> testing

00:05:50.149 --> 00:05:50.159 
certainly it was all about water testing

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:53.330 
certainly it was all about water testing
it<00:05:50.659> one<00:05:51.659> thing<00:05:51.870> nice<00:05:52.020> about<00:05:52.069> doing<00:05:53.069> it<00:05:53.190> this

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:53.340 
it one thing nice about doing it this

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:56.600 
it one thing nice about doing it this
way<00:05:53.400> with<00:05:53.789> the<00:05:53.880> horizontal<00:05:55.159> we<00:05:56.159> don't<00:05:56.310> have<00:05:56.460> to

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:56.610 
way with the horizontal we don't have to

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:58.430 
way with the horizontal we don't have to
register<00:05:56.909> to<00:05:57.270> Wells<00:05:57.509> with<00:05:57.750> the<00:05:57.840> county<00:05:58.199> doing

00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:58.440 
register to Wells with the county doing

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:00.379 
register to Wells with the county doing
vertical<00:05:58.620> and<00:05:59.430> like<00:05:59.580> I<00:05:59.610> say<00:05:59.789> we<00:05:59.940> don't<00:06:00.060> have<00:06:00.150> to

00:06:00.379 --> 00:06:00.389 
vertical and like I say we don't have to

00:06:00.389 --> 00:06:03.019 
vertical and like I say we don't have to
rip<00:06:01.139> the<00:06:01.289> farmyard<00:06:01.860> up<00:06:02.039> trenching<00:06:02.759> all<00:06:02.909> the

00:06:03.019 --> 00:06:03.029 
rip the farmyard up trenching all the

00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:06.409 
rip the farmyard up trenching all the
way<00:06:03.120> across<00:06:03.500> it<00:06:04.500> was<00:06:04.710> really<00:06:05.310> a<00:06:05.389> really<00:06:06.389> a

00:06:06.409 --> 00:06:06.419 
way across it was really a really a

00:06:06.419 --> 00:06:08.029 
way across it was really a really a
positive<00:06:06.690> it's<00:06:07.169> about<00:06:07.379> the<00:06:07.529> best<00:06:07.620> way<00:06:07.830> I<00:06:07.860> can

00:06:08.029 --> 00:06:08.039 
positive it's about the best way I can

00:06:08.039 --> 00:06:10.399 
positive it's about the best way I can
explain<00:06:08.400> it<00:06:08.520> so<00:06:09.360> anyways<00:06:09.659> once<00:06:09.930> we<00:06:10.080> got<00:06:10.229> this

00:06:10.399 --> 00:06:10.409 
explain it so anyways once we got this

00:06:10.409 --> 00:06:14.390 
explain it so anyways once we got this
all<00:06:10.650> hooked<00:06:10.889> up<00:06:11.069> and<00:06:11.900> all<00:06:12.900> situated<00:06:13.529> we<00:06:14.219> did

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:14.400 
all hooked up and all situated we did

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.309 
all hooked up and all situated we did
our<00:06:14.550> water<00:06:14.789> tests<00:06:15.210> on<00:06:15.330> it<00:06:15.539> we<00:06:15.719> ran<00:06:15.930> the<00:06:16.110> water

00:06:16.309 --> 00:06:16.319 
our water tests on it we ran the water

00:06:16.319 --> 00:06:17.839 
our water tests on it we ran the water
and<00:06:16.650> then<00:06:16.800> we<00:06:16.919> submitted<00:06:17.159> a<00:06:17.400> water<00:06:17.580> sample

00:06:17.839 --> 00:06:17.849 
and then we submitted a water sample

00:06:17.849 --> 00:06:20.180 
and then we submitted a water sample
once<00:06:18.690> again<00:06:19.020> to<00:06:19.289> the<00:06:19.379> state<00:06:19.650> of<00:06:19.770> Minnesota

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:20.190 
once again to the state of Minnesota

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:21.860 
once again to the state of Minnesota
just<00:06:20.729> because<00:06:20.969> we<00:06:21.060> want<00:06:21.240> to<00:06:21.360> make<00:06:21.479> sure<00:06:21.509> in<00:06:21.779> the

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:21.870 
just because we want to make sure in the

just because we want to make sure in the
process<00:06:22.319> of<00:06:22.409> doing<00:06:22.650> all<00:06:22.770> this<00:06:22.949> and<00:06:23.550> we're<00:06:23.729> not

going<00:06:23.969> to<00:06:24.060> contaminate<00:06:24.389> our<00:06:25.259> water<00:06:25.529> source<00:06:25.889> or

00:06:26.119 --> 00:06:26.129 
going to contaminate our water source or

00:06:26.129 --> 00:06:27.469 
going to contaminate our water source or
do<00:06:26.250> something<00:06:26.490> stupid<00:06:26.759> that<00:06:27.060> get<00:06:27.240> us<00:06:27.330> in
