00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
might be a good idea to go ahead and

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.180 
might be a good idea to go ahead and

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
you don't push the bolts into the frame

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:22.400 
you don't push the bolts into the frame
so<00:03:20.910> you<00:03:20.970> can<00:03:21.090> do<00:03:21.180> it<00:03:21.270> just<00:03:21.450> like<00:03:21.510> this<00:03:21.810> however

you take the bolt leader actually just
leave<00:03:25.739> it<00:03:25.860> on<00:03:25.980> here

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
leave it on here

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.610

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
and then put the wire through the hitch

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.560 
and then put the wire through the hitch

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:34.880 
and pull it up into place also we'll
install<00:03:33.870> the<00:03:33.930> hitch<00:03:34.260> using<00:03:34.590> the<00:03:34.620> bolts

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
install the hitch using the bolts

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:44.150 
install the hitch using the bolts
closest<00:03:35.220> to<00:03:35.310> the<00:03:35.370> bumper<00:03:35.670> first<00:03:43.010> we<00:03:44.010> will

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
closest to the bumper first we will

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.580 
closest to the bumper first we will

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
we still have them loose so we can still

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.460 
we still have them loose so we can still
move<00:03:54.880> the<00:03:55.000> hitch<00:03:55.150> around<00:03:55.230> because<00:03:56.230> on

nut the next thing we're going to do is

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.190 
nut the next thing we're going to do is
Snug<00:04:18.519> up<00:04:18.640> the<00:04:18.820> hitch<00:04:19.030> to<00:04:19.600> the<00:04:19.630> frame<00:04:19.750> of<00:04:20.019> the

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:21.880 
vehicle but when we do that we want to

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:23.070 
vehicle but when we do that we want to
make<00:04:22.000> sure<00:04:22.120> the<00:04:22.210> holes<00:04:22.420> line<00:04:22.690> up<00:04:22.720> of<00:04:22.960> the

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
make sure the holes line up of the

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.320 
make sure the holes line up of the
threaded<00:04:23.380> fittings<00:04:23.680> for<00:04:23.860> a<00:04:23.890> heat<00:04:24.130> shield<00:04:24.520> it's

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
threaded fittings for a heat shield it's

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:26.550 
threaded fittings for a heat shield it's
probably<00:04:25.660> easiest<00:04:25.930> way<00:04:26.080> to<00:04:26.110> do<00:04:26.290> that<00:04:26.440> you<00:04:26.530> just

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560 
probably easiest way to do that you just

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.430 
probably easiest way to do that you just

we're<00:05:04.460> our<00:05:04.580> attaching<00:05:04.789> point<00:05:05.089> here<00:05:05.300> and<00:05:05.449> we

00:05:05.529 --> 00:05:05.539 
we're our attaching point here and we

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:07.149 
we're our attaching point here and we
know<00:05:05.659> there's<00:05:05.839> a<00:05:05.930> bolt<00:05:06.139> right<00:05:06.199> here<00:05:06.379> so<00:05:07.039> what

know there's a bolt right here so what

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:09.129 
know there's a bolt right here so what
we'll<00:05:07.309> do<00:05:07.520> is<00:05:07.819> just<00:05:07.999> basically<00:05:08.120> take<00:05:08.870> out<00:05:08.990> this

00:05:09.129 --> 00:05:09.139 
we'll do is just basically take out this

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:11.559 
we'll do is just basically take out this
section<00:05:09.409> right<00:05:09.650> here<00:05:09.819> this<00:05:10.819> is<00:05:10.879> as<00:05:11.120> described

00:05:11.559 --> 00:05:11.569 
section right here this is as described

section right here this is as described
in<00:05:11.659> the<00:05:11.779> instructions<00:05:12.080> and<00:05:13.069> we'll<00:05:13.999> just<00:05:14.120> use

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:14.210 
in the instructions and we'll just use

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:34.450 
in the instructions and we'll just use
some<00:05:14.330> tin<00:05:14.509> snips<00:05:14.779> to<00:05:14.839> cut<00:05:14.899> that<00:05:15.199> out

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:34.460
