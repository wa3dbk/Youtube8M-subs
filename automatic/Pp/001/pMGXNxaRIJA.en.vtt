oh<00:00:23.150> well<00:00:26.689> get<00:00:27.689> the<00:00:27.779> LEDs<00:00:28.230> here<00:00:28.619> power<00:00:29.519> off<00:00:32.300> disk

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:36.710 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:40.670 

there<00:00:37.710> is<00:00:37.739> a<00:00:38.600> digital<00:00:39.600> potentiometer<00:00:39.780> volume

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
there is a digital potentiometer volume

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.000 
there is a digital potentiometer volume
control<00:00:41.510> has<00:00:42.510> an<00:00:42.660> EEPROM<00:00:43.110> so<00:00:43.739> that<00:00:43.920> it

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
control has an EEPROM so that it

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.040 
control has an EEPROM so that it
remembers<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.730> settings<00:00:45.120> when<00:00:45.719> it's<00:00:45.840> turned

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
remembers the settings when it's turned

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:46.959 
remembers the settings when it's turned

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
PlayStation originally tried to put

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.810 
PlayStation originally tried to put
1080i<00:01:00.930> onto<00:01:01.620> it<00:01:01.710> and<00:01:01.890> actually<00:01:02.039> worked<00:01:02.460> I

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
1080i onto it and actually worked I

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.729 
1080i onto it and actually worked I
didn't<00:01:03.030> realize<00:01:03.270> that<00:01:03.300> screen<00:01:03.960> could<00:01:04.110> do<00:01:04.320> that

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
didn't realize that screen could do that

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.469 
didn't realize that screen could do that
it's<00:01:05.700> probably<00:01:05.909> some<00:01:06.060> sort<00:01:06.090> of<00:01:06.299> like

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
it's probably some sort of like

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.179 
it's probably some sort of like
interpolated<00:01:07.170> version<00:01:07.650> of<00:01:07.770> it<00:01:07.860> or<00:01:07.979> something

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
interpolated version of it or something

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.480 
interpolated version of it or something
but<00:01:08.400> I<00:01:09.060> set<00:01:09.540> it<00:01:09.659> back<00:01:09.869> down<00:01:09.930> at<00:01:10.350> 1280<00:01:10.830> by<00:01:11.070> 720

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
but I set it back down at 1280 by 720

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.160 
but I set it back down at 1280 by 720
because<00:01:12.060> that's<00:01:12.240> actually<00:01:12.420> what<00:01:12.689> this<00:01:12.869> screen

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
because that's actually what this screen

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.270 
because that's actually what this screen
is<00:01:14.000> come<00:01:15.000> on<00:01:15.180> honey<00:01:15.680> if<00:01:16.680> you<00:01:16.830> don't<00:01:16.979> have<00:01:17.070> a<00:01:17.130> lot

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:37.760 

there's<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.360> game<00:01:32.840> button<00:01:36.530> anyway<00:01:37.530> there's<00:01:37.710> a

there's the game button anyway there's a

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.350 
there's the game button anyway there's a
front<00:01:38.280> vent<00:01:38.610> here<00:01:38.909> it<00:01:39.000> actually<00:01:39.240> has<00:01:39.329> more

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
front vent here it actually has more

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.170 
front vent here it actually has more
events<00:01:39.840> than<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.049> ps3<00:01:40.560> slim<00:01:40.770> did<00:01:41.180> speakers

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
events than the ps3 slim did speakers

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.090 
events than the ps3 slim did speakers
and<00:01:42.360> left<00:01:42.509> and<00:01:42.689> right

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
and left and right

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.569 
and left and right
exhalation<00:01:44.100> events<00:01:45.799> rear<00:01:46.799> vents<00:01:47.310> and<00:01:47.490> the

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
exhalation events rear vents and the

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.109 
exhalation events rear vents and the
pinstriping<00:01:48.119> goes<00:01:48.299> along<00:01:48.630> him<00:01:48.810> as<00:01:48.899> well<00:01:49.110> I

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:50.119 
pinstriping goes along him as well I

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:53.690 
pinstriping goes along him as well I
used<00:01:51.119> to<00:01:51.329> make<00:01:52.170> signs<00:01:52.470> as<00:01:53.009> some<00:01:53.280> people<00:01:53.369> Noah

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
used to make signs as some people Noah

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.660 
used to make signs as some people Noah
so<00:01:54.060> putting<00:01:55.049> out<00:01:55.200> in<00:01:55.290> pinstriping<00:01:55.920> was<00:01:56.100> not<00:01:56.640> a

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
so putting out in pinstriping was not a

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:03.249 
so putting out in pinstriping was not a
big<00:01:57.030> deal<00:01:57.299> for<00:01:57.360> me<00:01:58.310> so<00:01:59.310> yeah<00:02:00.229> star<00:02:01.229> size<00:02:01.590> it's

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:03.259 
big deal for me so yeah star size it's

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:06.620 
big deal for me so yeah star size it's
actually<00:02:04.259> a<00:02:04.320> little<00:02:04.530> less<00:02:05.369> on<00:02:05.700> the<00:02:05.820> X<00:02:06.030> than<00:02:06.509> the

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
actually a little less on the X than the

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.900 
actually a little less on the X than the
last<00:02:06.780> couple<00:02:06.990> Xbox<00:02:07.500> 360<00:02:08.009> laptops<00:02:08.429> and<00:02:08.670> I<00:02:08.729> think

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
last couple Xbox 360 laptops and I think

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.559 
last couple Xbox 360 laptops and I think
it's<00:02:09.000> about<00:02:09.149> a<00:02:09.209> quarter<00:02:09.569> inch<00:02:09.599> deeper

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569 
it's about a quarter inch deeper

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:13.030 
it's about a quarter inch deeper
I<00:02:11.599> could<00:02:12.080> have<00:02:12.200> actually<00:02:12.290> made<00:02:12.530> it<00:02:12.590> smaller

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
I could have actually made it smaller

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.020 
I could have actually made it smaller
but<00:02:14.319> the<00:02:15.319> screen<00:02:15.739> basically<00:02:16.340> was<00:02:16.760> a<00:02:16.790> large

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
but the screen basically was a large

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.110 
but the screen basically was a large
portion<00:02:17.450> of<00:02:17.629> the<00:02:18.049> unit<00:02:18.640> so<00:02:19.640> I<00:02:19.670> had<00:02:19.819> to<00:02:19.909> make<00:02:20.000> it

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
portion of the unit so I had to make it

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.000 
portion of the unit so I had to make it
at<00:02:20.209> least<00:02:20.239> as<00:02:20.569> wide<00:02:20.750> as<00:02:20.870> the<00:02:21.019> screen<00:02:21.260> so

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
at least as wide as the screen so

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:23.530 
at least as wide as the screen so
actually<00:02:22.310> there's<00:02:22.519> an<00:02:22.700> empty<00:02:22.940> space<00:02:23.150> here

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
actually there's an empty space here

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.380 
actually there's an empty space here
underneath<00:02:24.200> Regan's<00:02:24.739> store<00:02:24.980> the<00:02:25.310> power<00:02:26.000> cord

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
underneath Regan's store the power cord

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.220 
underneath Regan's store the power cord
and<00:02:27.099> of<00:02:28.099> course<00:02:28.310> a<00:02:28.610> month<00:02:28.879> to<00:02:29.060> install<00:02:29.450> but

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
and of course a month to install but

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.860 
and of course a month to install but
yeah<00:02:30.739> you<00:02:30.890> get<00:02:31.010> the<00:02:31.040> basic<00:02:31.400> idea<00:02:31.640> so<00:02:31.780> there<00:02:32.780> it

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
yeah you get the basic idea so there it

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:42.870 
yeah you get the basic idea so there it
is

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.940 

you
