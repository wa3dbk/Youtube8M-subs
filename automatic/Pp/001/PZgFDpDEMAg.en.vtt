00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 I'm headed to the moody air base in 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.960
 georgia where a weapon was designed 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.790
 with non-lethal effects but highly 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.920
 effective 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:14.940
 according to the builders it would discourage 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:17.550
 attackers without killing them has arrived 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.580
 the age of weapons is direct energy and me 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.470
 I'm about to end up on the fire line 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:25.289
 active from niall system is a weapon a 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.609
 long-range non-lethal rays affects 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.640
 the target with a beam of waves 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:31.669
 millimeter energy that causes a 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.320
 such discomfort that absolutely must 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:35.790
 move independently of 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.670
 target size 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.680
 the results are always the same as the 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.570
 feeling of heat on the skin and so 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.430
 intense that as soon as he realizes he is 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.050
 been hit must stop 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.649
 any activity and move from 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.649
 another part 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.820
 also its range of action 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.420
 extraordinary reaches 460 meters of 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.670
 distance 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:00.649
 we are light years away from the bombs 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.649
 Molotov cocktails and banal pistols 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:08.520
 bottle with active from niall system 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:13.400
 you can hinder the enemy from dispersing 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.400
 without the use of lethal weapons force 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:18.680
 everything seems perfect but how they work 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.840
 really these weapons apparently 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:24.510
 harmless they really have the power of 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.700
 neutralize a threat the only way 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:29.880
 to know it and become theirs 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.130
 target all those who have 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:36.450
 worked on this project are over 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:40.220
 in this area and now it's my turn 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:45.720
 I hope I don't run away like a girl 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:48.420
 but in any case I would not be the first the ds 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.220
 has a crew of two men use the 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:54.259
 cameras to catch the target 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.259
 in this case they are framing me 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:04.700
 have framed shoots 5 4 4 2 1 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:12.880
 it's amazing I didn't hear anything not 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.880
 I saw nothing came from nothing is 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:19.620
 shocking seems a very ugly 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:22.540
 sunburn feels very hot 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.190
 extremely hot it actually is 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.460
 feels under the skin feels 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:29.320
 burn inside intensely begins 

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:32.200
 slowly step by step 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:33.820
 then it progressively increases again 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:38.590
 skin pinches slightly but I feel that 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:40.930
 is penetrating is Colonel John 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:43.260
 techniques and the commanding officer of the 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.670
 air force security forces 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:48.250
 Arab among all those who have been 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:53.080
 affected by the ds if the watermelon that if 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:55.660
 it fared better this is sure the g 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.070
 see and hit me with that ray 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.960
 at that point you undoubtedly get mine 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:00.340
 attention I take off the neeskens 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:02.290
 lets you reach and touch 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:06.280
 anyone and as soon as the target is 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:09.760
 move does not undergo other effects then 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:12.840
 how it works the ds emits a beam of 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.700
 energy at the speed of light 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.610
 when the man reaches the effect on 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:21.090
 skin is limited to the depth of 0.39 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:23.849
 mm ie the thickness of 3 sheets of paper 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:26.129
 after a few seconds the target warns 

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:27.840
 an intense sensation of heat the 

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:29.370
 burning only ends when the 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.440
 transmitter turns off 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.599
 or when the target moves away from the 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.190
 energy beam 

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:36.569
 there is a lot of water in our body or 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.430
 better our body is composed 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:40.290
 mainly water and energy 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.260
 interacts with water molecules 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:45.120
 making them vibrate and heating it 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.220
 canon the vibrations activate the 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.260
 nerve endings that they send to 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.329
 message to the brain asking to do 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.640
 something to stop the heat then 

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:57.840
 instinctively we feel the need to 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:04:00.030
 move the ds takes advantage of the waves 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.129
 millimeter high frequency not le 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:04.200
 microwave avoiding the risk of 

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:06.569
 serious injury to the computer system 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:10.200
 board is designed to shut down 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:11.579
 before any overexposure 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.769
 millimeter waves are no longer one 

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:15.480
 novelties are used in 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:16.680
 communications also in certain systems 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.660
 radar 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:21.600
 innovation lies in exploiting 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:24.440
 energy directed at 95 g.gershwin hands 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.440
 falck courses 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:30.770
 there is the risk of risk of injury 

00:04:28.939 --> 00:04:33.050
 injuries and less than one tenth of one per 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:34.610
 one hundred and the injuries reported are not 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:36.699
 other than the chic and healing from 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:39.289
 sun without medical attention 

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:41.389
 marco do something about it tell me about 

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:43.159
 eyes and the blink of an eye acts as 

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:46.669
 protection considering that they are fighting 

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:48.409
 eyes in a quarter of a second 

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:50.210
 furthermore the system is designed for 

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:52.849
 avoid transmitting too much energy 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:55.039
 to the eyes while one is closing them e 

00:04:52.849 --> 00:04:59.259
 mattek sands is a tall mechanism 

00:04:55.039 --> 00:04:59.259
 protective and very very effective 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:05.600
 in fact, to suffer serious injuries it is necessary 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:11.150
 remain under the effect of the beam for 

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:13.729
 a long time and a great many 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:16.370
 volunteers exposed so far no one has 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:18.440
 lasted more than a few seconds 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:22.570
 believe me you feel the need to 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:22.570
 escape from the sensation of heat 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:33.980
 therefore the ds triggers a non-yes reaction 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:36.620
 can do without moving but at the level 

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:39.080
 of precision when it must be contained 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:41.770
 a mass you have to be able to hit the head 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:41.770
 of the bad guys 

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:45.520
 and if the crowds are present 

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:46.270
 terrorists who use people like 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.520
 human shields 

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:51.819
 you need to be able to hit them 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:53.830
 without hurting the unarmed passers-by with the 

00:05:51.819 --> 00:05:56.139
 ds say that this is possible therefore 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:57.159
 I just have to break the delay e 

00:05:56.139 --> 00:05:58.659
 check 

00:05:57.159 --> 00:06:00.550
 now channel we will show as two 

00:05:58.659 --> 00:06:02.770
 people who are next to her do not 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:04.900
 they will be hit by the beam and move 

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:06.849
 she only 1 b tomorrow that we 

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:09.490
 allows from that distance that in 

00:06:06.849 --> 00:06:12.340
 effects is not a short test to identify 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:18.460
 the eventual ill-intentioned and aget 

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:20.229
 heads of rioters instigators imagine 

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:21.460
 of having to be what they put themselves 

00:06:20.229 --> 00:06:24.430
 in the center 

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:27.370
 Here they do claim they can 

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:29.400
 locate and identify the leader and in 

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:35.439
 this case I believe to be me 

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:39.779
 the incriminated diagnostic operator at 

00:06:35.439 --> 00:06:39.779
 target framed dear 

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:47.080
 certainly I was the only one to be 

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:48.490
 hit it 

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:50.470
 I would never want the colonel 

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:54.460
 lose a similar experience must 

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:56.620
 share it with me cesa sono un 

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:58.810
 selfless I like to give help to people 

00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:01.620
 it didn't seem right to get everything 

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:04.090
 for me thanks it was very kind 

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:06.669
 Sometimes I confess that I was hit 11 

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:08.380
 times with this sense how it feels 

00:07:06.669 --> 00:07:12.759
 so thank you for reminding me and 

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:17.850
 choose the first rows as you suffer one 

00:07:12.759 --> 00:07:17.850
 instantaneous and very painful burn 

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:22.180
 pal singh 

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:24.550
 in my career I attended 

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:26.440
 many complaints and muhidin too 

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:28.479
 in 99 percent of the cases they had 

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:30.400
 reason to exist something but there is 

00:07:28.479 --> 00:07:31.960
 always a percentage of violent 

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:33.550
 at this point it's the forces that risk it 

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:35.650
 of the order and the innocents 

00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:37.770
 the dsc will help prevent this 

00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:37.770
 happen
