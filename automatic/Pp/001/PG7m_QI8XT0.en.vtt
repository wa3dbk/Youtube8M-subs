00:00:36.959 --> 00:00:36.969 
pac-man noises so let's have a look at

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:42.060 
pac-man noises so let's have a look at
that<00:00:40.109> it's<00:00:41.109> actually<00:00:41.379> cool<00:00:41.590> if<00:00:41.680> you<00:00:41.829> combine

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:42.070 
that it's actually cool if you combine

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.150 
that it's actually cool if you combine
it<00:00:42.309> with<00:00:42.520> a<00:00:42.879> ghost<00:00:43.539> noise<00:00:43.840> since<00:00:44.109> pac-man<00:00:44.800> it's

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:45.160 
it with a ghost noise since pac-man it's

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.430 
it with a ghost noise since pac-man it's
a<00:00:45.250> bit<00:00:45.430> pointless<00:00:45.640> having<00:00:46.059> him<00:00:46.149> on<00:00:46.239> his<00:00:46.359> own

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
the song we actually break the string I

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:59.970 
the song we actually break the string I
broke<00:02:58.900> the<00:02:58.959> string<00:02:59.290> on<00:02:59.410> the<00:02:59.500> album<00:02:59.800> and<00:02:59.920> we

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
broke the string on the album and we

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.590 
broke the string on the album and we
left<00:03:00.190> it<00:03:00.310> there<00:03:00.459> so<00:03:01.000> let's<00:03:01.209> see<00:03:01.300> how<00:03:01.420> I<00:03:01.450> did

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 
left it there so let's see how I did

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:02.100 
left it there so let's see how I did
that

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
that

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:03.449 
that
I<00:03:02.140> don't<00:03:02.530> think<00:03:02.650> I<00:03:02.680> can<00:03:02.770> break<00:03:02.920> the<00:03:03.070> string<00:03:03.280> now

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 
I don't think I can break the string now

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:10.290 
I don't think I can break the string now
but<00:03:03.700> let's<00:03:03.850> try<00:03:03.940> it
