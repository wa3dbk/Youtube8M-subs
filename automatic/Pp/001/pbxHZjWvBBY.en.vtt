Airstream we're inside of a 1963
Globetrotter<00:00:16.859> and<00:00:17.480> we're<00:00:18.480> at<00:00:18.600> the<00:00:18.720> front<00:00:18.960> of

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
Globetrotter and we're at the front of

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.480 
Globetrotter and we're at the front of
the<00:00:19.140> trailer<00:00:19.350> and<00:00:19.830> you'll<00:00:20.070> see<00:00:20.250> right<00:00:20.430> here

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
the trailer and you'll see right here

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.109 
the trailer and you'll see right here
we've<00:00:20.850> pulled<00:00:21.090> out<00:00:21.270> where<00:00:21.539> it<00:00:21.660> used<00:00:21.840> to<00:00:21.990> be<00:00:22.050> a

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:23.119 
we've pulled out where it used to be a

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:26.560 
we've pulled out where it used to be a
couch<00:00:24.119> or<00:00:24.420> a<00:00:24.510> gaucho<00:00:24.990> as<00:00:25.439> they<00:00:25.619> refer<00:00:25.890> to

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:26.570 
couch or a gaucho as they refer to

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:28.700 
couch or a gaucho as they refer to
underneath<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:27.810> Gaucho<00:00:28.170> you'll<00:00:28.349> see<00:00:28.560> that

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
underneath the Gaucho you'll see that

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.310 
underneath the Gaucho you'll see that
this<00:00:28.830> is<00:00:29.010> a<00:00:29.039> it's<00:00:29.970> a<00:00:30.090> large<00:00:30.300> metal<00:00:30.750> tank<00:00:31.050> and

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
this is a it's a large metal tank and

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.590 
this is a it's a large metal tank and
this<00:00:31.439> is<00:00:31.560> actually<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:31.980> freshwater<00:00:32.279> tank<00:00:32.880> and

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
this is actually the freshwater tank and

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.150 
this is actually the freshwater tank and
I'd<00:00:34.079> like<00:00:34.230> to<00:00:34.350> tell<00:00:34.530> you<00:00:34.620> a<00:00:34.680> little<00:00:34.770> bit<00:00:34.920> about

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
I'd like to tell you a little bit about

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.100 
I'd like to tell you a little bit about
how<00:00:35.370> this<00:00:35.520> works

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.110 
how this works

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.660 
how this works
you<00:00:37.110> see<00:00:37.290> back<00:00:37.440> in<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.649> 60s<00:00:38.129> they<00:00:38.250> didn't<00:00:38.520> have

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
you see back in the 60s they didn't have

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.580 
you see back in the 60s they didn't have
water<00:00:38.879> pumps<00:00:39.329> quite<00:00:39.540> yet<00:00:39.780> so<00:00:40.290> they<00:00:40.379> had<00:00:40.500> to

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
water pumps quite yet so they had to

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:41.990 
water pumps quite yet so they had to
come<00:00:40.770> up<00:00:40.800> with<00:00:40.890> a<00:00:41.010> way<00:00:41.190> to<00:00:41.219> pressurize<00:00:41.820> the

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
come up with a way to pressurize the

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.520 
come up with a way to pressurize the
water<00:00:42.030> system<00:00:42.600> to<00:00:42.629> actually<00:00:42.840> get<00:00:43.079> it<00:00:43.170> to<00:00:43.290> flow

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
water system to actually get it to flow

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.250 
water system to actually get it to flow
uphill<00:00:44.010> and<00:00:44.489> out<00:00:44.579> to<00:00:44.700> water<00:00:44.910> faucets<00:00:45.390> so<00:00:46.110> what

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
uphill and out to water faucets so what

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.170 
uphill and out to water faucets so what
they<00:00:46.379> did<00:00:46.440> was<00:00:46.620> rather<00:00:46.980> creative<00:00:47.520> they<00:00:47.969> made

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
they did was rather creative they made

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.540 
they did was rather creative they made
this<00:00:48.390> tank<00:00:48.690> it's<00:00:49.350> actually<00:00:49.890> a<00:00:49.920> pressurized

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
this tank it's actually a pressurized

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.229 
this tank it's actually a pressurized
tank<00:00:50.730> and<00:00:51.980> from<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.100> water<00:00:53.280> fill<00:00:53.579> valve<00:00:53.879> there

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
tank and from the water fill valve there

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.510 
tank and from the water fill valve there
was<00:00:54.390> a<00:00:54.420> plastic<00:00:55.020> seal<00:00:55.320> on<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.770> outside<00:00:56.160> so<00:00:56.489> I

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
was a plastic seal on the outside so I

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:57.979 
was a plastic seal on the outside so I
should<00:00:56.789> have<00:00:56.879> rubber<00:00:57.059> seal<00:00:57.329> so<00:00:57.840> when<00:00:57.930> you

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
should have rubber seal so when you

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.510 
should have rubber seal so when you
screwed<00:00:58.289> that<00:00:58.440> Valve<00:00:58.710> on<00:00:58.980> it<00:00:59.190> was<00:00:59.309> airtight

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
screwed that Valve on it was airtight

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.060 
screwed that Valve on it was airtight
and<00:01:00.030> if<00:01:00.690> you<00:01:00.780> come<00:01:00.960> over<00:01:01.050> here<00:01:01.379> you'll<00:01:01.890> see

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
and if you come over here you'll see

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.950 
and if you come over here you'll see
this<00:01:02.219> line<00:01:02.520> right<00:01:02.760> here<00:01:02.820> actually<00:01:03.359> went<00:01:03.809> to<00:01:03.870> a

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
this line right here actually went to a

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.509 
this line right here actually went to a
compressor<00:01:04.680> this<00:01:04.890> was<00:01:05.070> an<00:01:05.159> air<00:01:05.339> compressor

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
compressor this was an air compressor

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.310 
compressor this was an air compressor
which<00:01:06.030> was<00:01:06.180> fed<00:01:06.720> by<00:01:06.900> this<00:01:07.100> circuit<00:01:08.100> here<00:01:08.340> and

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
which was fed by this circuit here and

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.830 
which was fed by this circuit here and
after<00:01:10.320> you<00:01:10.470> put<00:01:11.220> the<00:01:11.340> cap<00:01:11.549> on<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:12.510> remaining

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
after you put the cap on the remaining

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.480 
after you put the cap on the remaining
there<00:01:13.110> was<00:01:13.200> about<00:01:13.350> you<00:01:13.710> know<00:01:13.740> an<00:01:13.920> inch<00:01:14.130> or<00:01:14.310> two

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
there was about you know an inch or two

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.640 
there was about you know an inch or two
of<00:01:14.520> air<00:01:14.909> on<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.210> top<00:01:15.240> of<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.630> tank<00:01:15.840> and<00:01:16.140> that

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
of air on the top of the tank and that

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.350 
of air on the top of the tank and that
air<00:01:16.890> got<00:01:17.189> compressed<00:01:17.670> by<00:01:18.000> this<00:01:18.060> air

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
air got compressed by this air

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.810 
air got compressed by this air
compressor<00:01:18.509> so<00:01:19.470> that<00:01:19.650> compressed<00:01:20.340> air<00:01:20.580> in<00:01:20.729> the

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
compressor so that compressed air in the

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.820 
compressor so that compressed air in the
top<00:01:21.000> of<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.240> tank<00:01:21.479> forced<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.170> water<00:01:22.409> down

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
top of the tank forced the water down

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.950 
top of the tank forced the water down
through<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:23.520> bottom<00:01:23.850> of<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.060> tank<00:01:24.240> and<00:01:24.810> in

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
through the bottom of the tank and in

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.539 
through the bottom of the tank and in
through<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.350> lines<00:01:25.560> and<00:01:25.830> out<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.070> faucets

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
through the lines and out the faucets

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.420 
through the lines and out the faucets
that<00:01:27.170> was<00:01:28.170> a<00:01:28.200> primitive<00:01:28.650> way<00:01:28.799> of<00:01:29.040> creating

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
that was a primitive way of creating

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.580 
that was a primitive way of creating
pressurized<00:01:29.970> water<00:01:30.270> in<00:01:30.479> these<00:01:30.600> trailers<00:01:30.840> you

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
pressurized water in these trailers you

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.160 
pressurized water in these trailers you
see<00:01:31.799> nowadays<00:01:32.119> we<00:01:33.119> actually<00:01:33.509> can<00:01:33.689> save<00:01:33.930> these

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
see nowadays we actually can save these

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.830 
see nowadays we actually can save these
tanks<00:01:34.680> we<00:01:35.100> have<00:01:35.549> since<00:01:35.820> capped<00:01:36.119> off<00:01:36.360> this<00:01:36.570> line

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
tanks we have since capped off this line

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.359 
tanks we have since capped off this line
so<00:01:37.259> this<00:01:37.380> no<00:01:37.590> longer<00:01:37.740> goes<00:01:38.040> to<00:01:38.159> the<00:01:38.250> air

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
so this no longer goes to the air

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.580 
so this no longer goes to the air
compressor<00:01:38.850> and<00:01:39.030> we<00:01:39.930> have<00:01:40.049> abandoned<00:01:40.500> these

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
compressor and we have abandoned these

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.149 
compressor and we have abandoned these
circuits<00:01:41.070> here<00:01:41.250> or<00:01:41.640> these<00:01:41.880> power<00:01:42.840> feeds<00:01:43.200> but

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
circuits here or these power feeds but

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.440 
circuits here or these power feeds but
you<00:01:44.399> can<00:01:44.549> come<00:01:44.670> over<00:01:44.790> here<00:01:44.909> and<00:01:45.119> see<00:01:45.420> that

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
you can come over here and see that

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.350 
you can come over here and see that
we've<00:01:45.689> actually<00:01:45.899> used<00:01:46.170> a<00:01:47.030> retrofitted<00:01:48.030> you

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
we've actually used a retrofitted you

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.630 
we've actually used a retrofitted you
know<00:01:48.479> brand-new<00:01:48.960> water<00:01:49.740> pump<00:01:50.040> so<00:01:50.399> we<00:01:50.490> have

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
know brand-new water pump so we have

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.060 
know brand-new water pump so we have
that<00:01:50.790> technology<00:01:51.210> and<00:01:52.079> it's<00:01:52.290> coming<00:01:52.829> off<00:01:52.890> the

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
that technology and it's coming off the

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.719 
that technology and it's coming off the
same<00:01:53.280> line<00:01:53.689> as<00:01:54.689> the<00:01:55.140> water<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:56.250> water<00:01:56.399> tank

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
same line as the water the water tank

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.300 
same line as the water the water tank
was<00:01:56.909> in<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.119> past<00:01:57.360> this<00:01:57.750> is<00:01:57.899> a<00:01:57.930> PEX<00:01:58.229> line<00:01:58.530> which

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
was in the past this is a PEX line which

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.850 
was in the past this is a PEX line which
we<00:01:59.490> have<00:01:59.640> other<00:01:59.790> videos<00:02:00.149> describing<00:02:00.740> and<00:02:01.740> this

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
we have other videos describing and this

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.950 
we have other videos describing and this
is<00:02:01.979> a<00:02:02.009> great<00:02:02.280> solution<00:02:02.490> so<00:02:03.450> if<00:02:03.600> you<00:02:03.689> have<00:02:03.840> an

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
is a great solution so if you have an

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.550 
is a great solution so if you have an
old<00:02:04.140> tank<00:02:04.439> you<00:02:04.619> can<00:02:04.770> many<00:02:05.340> times<00:02:05.430> reuse<00:02:06.149> it

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
old tank you can many times reuse it

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.040 
old tank you can many times reuse it
just<00:02:07.560> by<00:02:07.680> getting<00:02:07.860> creative<00:02:08.369> and

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
just by getting creative and

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:15.020 
just by getting creative and
adapting<00:02:11.240> making<00:02:12.240> all<00:02:12.360> things<00:02:12.540> new<00:02:12.660> again
