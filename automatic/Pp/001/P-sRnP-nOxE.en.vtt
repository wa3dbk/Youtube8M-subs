00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.879
 games of them all we are in the bread 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:09.360
 craft 1.8 let's see a mod a mod 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:11.580
 really please me it seems and is 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.450
 that what this mode does is that now 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.450
 appears nores 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.570
 this is basically what we do 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.600
 orishas and they are still 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:25.240
 let's go see it here now not 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:27.820
 I see no coincidence that before 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:31.650
 seen coal iron 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:35.340
 so if you want only for the iron 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.570
 only now they are also on the air 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:41.940
 did not make sense to this mode 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:45.780
 simply coal 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:48.440
 from where we are at 135 so 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:53.010
 let's see when we see this is coal 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:57.269
 coal over there iron 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:01:00.149
 apart from 193 more or less more or less 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:03.629
 explained the iron is a fact my nothing 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:07.140
 as a temple has wept during in 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:11.009
 around 220 or so and there's also 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.210
 emerald emerald diamond 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:15.149
 diamond is the one above the 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.700
 all clear but as you can see this is a 

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:21.229
 done or nothing 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.219
 that's why for me it's a motorcycle 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:26.039
 we can do parkour between blocks and 

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:27.479
 all good and creative 

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:29.340
 and this is supposed to happen also in the 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:33.270
 nevero so we go there because yes 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:35.610
 passing and fourth block 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.160
 out there like crazy 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:41.070
 oh my mother, I do not find him 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.930
 sense simply and it is supposed so 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.200
 that put the mod that I do not understand 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.439
 very good 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:51.640
 who washes it I will investigate a little 

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:54.670
 it is assumed as they put the link that adds 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.170
 some special blocks and that is that in 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:58.390
 leader 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.170
 the bass of the lava that's why I'm 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.330
 testing 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:06.380
 I do it in creative because I give to the 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:08.119
 center of the mouse wheel and as you see 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:09.289
 I get the block automatically 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.760
 block to which you are pointing because if 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:15.049
 It is not true for me 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.049
 then i'm trying 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.980
 because they're supposed to be 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.980
 diamond blocks 

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:23.590
 until now 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:29.000
 I have not been here for a while 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:32.360
 circling 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.720
 without fear before you that adds the 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.270
 mod 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:38.080
 as such that here we can find in 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:39.880
 the normal world we can find 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:42.030
 as you say this there is not much of 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.750
 diamond that's good 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:47.280
 we can find in the sea close ton 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:49.330
 that can also be cool to find 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.430
 the author at sea 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:54.030
 and in we can also in other things 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:57.660
 that now we're going to see percent here 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:59.490
 go Go 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:02.160
 if we find that block to make 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:04.960
 here we can see the normal world 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:07.120
 after being here in the middle 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:09.180
 it's pretty cool mother we are by 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.180
 here 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:17.690
 sorry, and now we should find 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:22.600
 the block in question 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:22.600
 you are not up mother of mine seriously 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.990
 or you have to kill me the dragon yes 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:30.760
 because if you do not go up here it's impossible 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:33.430
 literally 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:36.760
 mariah is very very very tall of this 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:38.980
 but as you can see they are all blocks of 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.560
 emerald here 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.000
 here it's cooler because it seems more 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.620
 complicated 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.760
 instead of men from here the 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:51.490
 dragon comes I do not think I'm not sure 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:53.110
 of duty with diamond blocks there are 

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:55.710
 precisely to navigate through 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:55.710
 on top of lava 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:00.880
 now 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:02.590
 it does not rise, but this one seems more 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.670
 complicated is we have the most 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:07.390
 do not 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:09.470
 make vicious 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:13.810
 I arrived 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:17.660
 not in order 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:20.600
 partly died politically but good 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:24.620
 I hope you liked to say that the 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:28.480
 description is for 1.8 if it was 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:31.660
 as it will come as always a lot 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:31.660
 until now
