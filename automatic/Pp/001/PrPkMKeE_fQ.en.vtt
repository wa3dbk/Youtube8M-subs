my thoughts about the League of Legends
matches<00:00:06.330> played<00:00:06.600> today<00:00:06.810> for<00:00:07.200> IEM<00:00:07.680> Kiev<00:00:08.099> now<00:00:08.730> I

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
matches played today for IEM Kiev now I

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:10.940 
matches played today for IEM Kiev now I
had<00:00:09.120> said<00:00:09.360> before<00:00:09.510> that<00:00:09.900> I<00:00:09.929> wanted<00:00:10.290> to<00:00:10.349> try<00:00:10.889> to

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
had said before that I wanted to try to

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.560 
had said before that I wanted to try to
stream<00:00:11.340> some<00:00:11.580> of<00:00:11.670> the<00:00:11.730> matches<00:00:11.880> and<00:00:12.269> do<00:00:12.360> some

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
stream some of the matches and do some

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.150 
stream some of the matches and do some
commentary<00:00:13.019> on<00:00:13.170> them<00:00:13.380> but<00:00:13.559> as<00:00:13.740> I<00:00:13.860> found<00:00:14.009> out

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
commentary on them but as I found out

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.880 
commentary on them but as I found out
today<00:00:14.400> IEM<00:00:15.299> actually<00:00:15.809> does<00:00:15.990> not<00:00:16.260> allow<00:00:16.560> people

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
today IEM actually does not allow people

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.370 
today IEM actually does not allow people
to<00:00:17.039> restream<00:00:17.609> their<00:00:18.180> broadcast<00:00:18.720> content<00:00:18.930> and

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
to restream their broadcast content and

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:20.870 
to restream their broadcast content and
I<00:00:19.470> can<00:00:19.650> actually<00:00:19.920> understand<00:00:20.369> why<00:00:20.520> that<00:00:20.699> is

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
I can actually understand why that is

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.670 
I can actually understand why that is
due<00:00:21.359> to<00:00:21.449> the<00:00:21.480> advertising<00:00:22.230> money<00:00:22.320> involved

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
due to the advertising money involved

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.170 
due to the advertising money involved
and<00:00:22.980> the<00:00:23.340> fact<00:00:23.490> that<00:00:23.580> they<00:00:23.730> need<00:00:23.910> to<00:00:24.029> satisfy

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
and the fact that they need to satisfy

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.849 
and the fact that they need to satisfy
their<00:00:24.480> sponsors<00:00:25.080> but<00:00:25.289> it<00:00:25.529> is<00:00:25.650> actually

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
their sponsors but it is actually

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.650 
their sponsors but it is actually
illegal<00:00:26.400> for<00:00:26.760> you<00:00:26.849> to<00:00:26.880> restrain<00:00:27.480> their

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
illegal for you to restrain their

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.599 
illegal for you to restrain their
content<00:00:28.109> so<00:00:28.349> I<00:00:28.560> unfortunately<00:00:29.429> is<00:00:29.490> not<00:00:29.519> able

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.550 
content so I unfortunately is not able
to<00:00:29.939> do<00:00:30.029> that<00:00:30.150> today<00:00:30.330> but<00:00:30.630> I<00:00:31.140> did<00:00:31.349> watch<00:00:31.529> the

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
to do that today but I did watch the

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:32.749 
to do that today but I did watch the
matches<00:00:31.920> and<00:00:32.279> there<00:00:32.369> was<00:00:32.489> some<00:00:32.610> pretty

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
matches and there was some pretty

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.340

interesting<00:00:33.090> stuff<00:00:33.329> you<00:00:33.750> can<00:00:33.870> find<00:00:34.230> the

thing<00:01:22.110> with<00:01:22.320> their<00:01:22.470> bands<00:01:22.680> today<00:01:22.920> they

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
thing with their bands today they

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.039 
thing with their bands today they
thought<00:01:23.820> that<00:01:23.850> they<00:01:24.030> were<00:01:24.090> really<00:01:24.479> smart<00:01:24.840> in

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
thought that they were really smart in

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:25.969 
thought that they were really smart in
terms<00:01:25.229> of<00:01:25.320> what<00:01:25.470> they're<00:01:25.560> doing<00:01:25.830> with<00:01:25.920> their

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
terms of what they're doing with their

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.980 
terms of what they're doing with their
bands<00:01:26.400> what<00:01:26.850> they<00:01:27.000> would<00:01:27.119> do<00:01:27.240> is<00:01:27.390> they<00:01:27.420> had

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
bands what they would do is they had

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.410 
bands what they would do is they had
first<00:01:28.380> pick<00:01:28.500> in<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.400> game<00:01:29.520> against<00:01:29.790> SK<00:01:30.210> and

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
first pick in the game against SK and

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.749 
first pick in the game against SK and
what<00:01:30.659> they<00:01:30.810> did<00:01:30.869> was<00:01:31.200> they<00:01:31.710> did<00:01:32.490> sort<00:01:32.729> of

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
what they did was they did sort of

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.340 
what they did was they did sort of
normal<00:01:33.150> bands<00:01:33.329> with<00:01:33.600> their<00:01:33.750> first<00:01:33.900> two<00:01:34.110> picks

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
normal bands with their first two picks

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.990 
normal bands with their first two picks
first<00:01:34.770> two<00:01:34.950> bands<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.400> one<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:35.759> sort<00:01:35.939> of

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
first two bands the one the sort of

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.730 
first two bands the one the sort of
things<00:01:36.180> you<00:01:36.299> would<00:01:36.390> expect<00:01:36.420> to<00:01:36.810> see<00:01:37.049> banning

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
things you would expect to see banning

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.399 
things you would expect to see banning
you<00:01:38.189> know<00:01:38.310> noted<00:01:38.909> junglers<00:01:39.329> or<00:01:39.479> noted<00:01:40.110> ap

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
you know noted junglers or noted ap

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.170 
you know noted junglers or noted ap
carry<00:01:40.650> that<00:01:40.860> sort<00:01:41.070> of<00:01:41.100> thing<00:01:41.189> then<00:01:41.850> with<00:01:42.030> their

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
carry that sort of thing then with their

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.569 
carry that sort of thing then with their
last<00:01:42.420> ban<00:01:43.049> their<00:01:43.470> third<00:01:43.740> band<00:01:43.979> they<00:01:44.310> banned

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
last ban their third band they banned

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.910 
last ban their third band they banned
Soraka<00:01:45.090> and<00:01:45.479> then<00:01:45.720> they<00:01:45.840> first<00:01:46.140> picked<00:01:46.350> so<00:01:46.740> no

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
Soraka and then they first picked so no

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.340 
Soraka and then they first picked so no
and<00:01:47.159> they<00:01:47.790> did<00:01:47.939> that<00:01:48.090> against<00:01:48.479> both<00:01:48.659> curse<00:01:49.020> and

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
and they did that against both curse and

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.260 
and they did that against both curse and
also<00:01:49.920> against<00:01:50.220> SK<00:01:50.610> and<00:01:50.640> it<00:01:50.880> proved<00:01:51.090> to<00:01:51.149> be

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
also against SK and it proved to be

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.940 
also against SK and it proved to be
really<00:01:51.659> effective<00:01:51.930> so<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.619> reason<00:01:52.860> why

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
really effective so the reason why

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.950 
really effective so the reason why
they're<00:01:53.100> doing<00:01:53.189> that<00:01:53.369> is<00:01:53.670> they<00:01:54.119> recognize

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
they're doing that is they recognize

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.810 
they're doing that is they recognize
that<00:01:54.990> Sona<00:01:55.619> and<00:01:55.860> Soraka<00:01:56.189> are<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:56.670> two

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
that Sona and Soraka are the two

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.249 
that Sona and Soraka are the two
strongest<00:01:57.090> supports<00:01:57.719> in<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:57.899> game<00:01:58.049> right<00:01:58.200> now

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
strongest supports in the game right now

00:01:58.259 --> 00:01:59.840 
strongest supports in the game right now
and<00:01:58.590> I'll<00:01:59.009> say<00:01:59.189> more<00:01:59.250> on<00:01:59.430> this<00:01:59.520> in<00:01:59.579> a<00:01:59.729> minute

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
and I'll say more on this in a minute

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:00.920 
and I'll say more on this in a minute
because<00:02:00.119> this<00:02:00.360> is<00:02:00.509> something<00:02:00.630> that<00:02:00.810> people

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
because this is something that people

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.450 
because this is something that people
have<00:02:01.200> been<00:02:01.350> discussing<00:02:01.710> in<00:02:01.920> the<00:02:02.009> comments<00:02:02.369> to

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
have been discussing in the comments to

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.760 
have been discussing in the comments to
some<00:02:02.610> of<00:02:02.729> my<00:02:02.850> videos<00:02:03.000> they<00:02:03.840> knew<00:02:04.079> that<00:02:04.290> Sona<00:02:04.590> &amp;

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
some of my videos they knew that Sona &amp;

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.770 
some of my videos they knew that Sona &amp;
Sirocco<00:02:04.979> were<00:02:05.250> the<00:02:05.369> strongest<00:02:05.820> support<00:02:06.450> so

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
Sirocco were the strongest support so

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.449 
Sirocco were the strongest support so
what<00:02:06.930> they<00:02:07.020> did<00:02:07.079> was<00:02:07.170> they<00:02:07.320> banned<00:02:07.710> Soraka<00:02:08.160> and

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
what they did was they banned Soraka and

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.490 
what they did was they banned Soraka and
then<00:02:08.640> they<00:02:08.729> first<00:02:09.030> picked<00:02:09.239> sona<00:02:09.599> and<00:02:09.869> what<00:02:10.319> by

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
then they first picked sona and what by

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.110 
then they first picked sona and what by
doing<00:02:10.770> that<00:02:10.890> they<00:02:11.160> forced<00:02:11.550> the<00:02:11.670> other<00:02:11.849> team

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
doing that they forced the other team

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.760 
doing that they forced the other team
onto<00:02:12.480> a<00:02:12.510> much<00:02:12.780> weaker<00:02:13.020> support

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
onto a much weaker support

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.980 
onto a much weaker support
and<00:02:13.890> in<00:02:14.520> both<00:02:14.640> cases<00:02:14.940> in<00:02:15.330> both<00:02:15.540> of<00:02:15.660> those<00:02:15.720> games

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
and in both cases in both of those games

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.140 
and in both cases in both of those games
the<00:02:16.380> other<00:02:16.530> team<00:02:16.740> ended<00:02:16.950> up<00:02:17.070> picking<00:02:17.220> Jana<00:02:17.610> so

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
the other team ended up picking Jana so

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.400 
the other team ended up picking Jana so
they<00:02:18.270> were<00:02:18.330> able<00:02:18.390> to<00:02:18.570> force<00:02:18.870> the<00:02:19.020> other<00:02:19.170> team

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
they were able to force the other team

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.020 
they were able to force the other team
into<00:02:19.770> a<00:02:19.800> weaker<00:02:20.190> support<00:02:20.610> and<00:02:20.790> then<00:02:20.880> that

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
into a weaker support and then that

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.430 
into a weaker support and then that
would<00:02:21.180> allow<00:02:21.390> their<00:02:21.660> bottom<00:02:21.960> Lane<00:02:22.110> to<00:02:22.260> just

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
would allow their bottom Lane to just

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.380 
would allow their bottom Lane to just
really<00:02:22.740> dominate<00:02:23.310> and<00:02:23.430> in<00:02:23.550> fact<00:02:23.700> him<00:02:23.880> in<00:02:24.060> both

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
really dominate and in fact him in both

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.660 
really dominate and in fact him in both
of<00:02:24.540> the<00:02:24.600> games<00:02:24.690> i<00:02:24.900> saw<00:02:25.080> chaox<00:02:25.530> was<00:02:25.740> able<00:02:26.040> to<00:02:26.190> get

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
of the games i saw chaox was able to get

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.700 
of the games i saw chaox was able to get
a<00:02:26.730> really<00:02:27.360> strong<00:02:27.570> leaning<00:02:27.870> matchup<00:02:28.230> and<00:02:28.440> just

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:28.710 
a really strong leaning matchup and just

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:30.440 
a really strong leaning matchup and just
completely<00:02:29.040> dominate<00:02:29.790> bottom<00:02:30.090> Lane<00:02:30.240> so<00:02:30.390> I

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
completely dominate bottom Lane so I

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:31.850 
completely dominate bottom Lane so I
thought<00:02:30.570> that<00:02:30.630> that<00:02:30.840> was<00:02:30.960> really<00:02:31.350> clever<00:02:31.590> and

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
thought that that was really clever and

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.530 
thought that that was really clever and
what<00:02:31.980> they<00:02:32.100> were<00:02:32.160> doing<00:02:32.340> now<00:02:33.060> in<00:02:33.240> both<00:02:33.360> of

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
what they were doing now in both of

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.030 
what they were doing now in both of
those<00:02:33.630> games<00:02:33.930> that<00:02:34.050> solomid<00:02:34.530> played<00:02:34.770> again

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
those games that solomid played again

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.920 
those games that solomid played again
against<00:02:35.280> both<00:02:35.490> sk<00:02:35.970> and<00:02:36.210> against<00:02:36.480> curse<00:02:36.720> gaming

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
against both sk and against curse gaming

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.990 
against both sk and against curse gaming
in<00:02:37.710> both<00:02:38.010> games<00:02:38.220> they<00:02:38.520> were<00:02:38.580> able<00:02:38.850> to<00:02:38.910> get

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
in both games they were able to get

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.370 
in both games they were able to get
really<00:02:39.300> strong<00:02:39.600> leaning<00:02:39.930> pairings<00:02:40.230> they<00:02:40.290> were

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
really strong leaning pairings they were

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.050 
really strong leaning pairings they were
able<00:02:40.470> to<00:02:40.590> get<00:02:40.710> sona<00:02:41.100> graves<00:02:41.460> in<00:02:41.760> the<00:02:41.790> first

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
able to get sona graves in the first

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.460 
able to get sona graves in the first
game<00:02:42.270> and<00:02:42.480> then<00:02:42.810> they<00:02:42.900> were<00:02:42.960> able<00:02:43.200> to<00:02:43.350> get

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
game and then they were able to get

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.190 
game and then they were able to get
sivir<00:02:43.860> sona<00:02:44.370> in<00:02:44.610> the<00:02:44.760> second<00:02:45.120> game<00:02:45.240> so<00:02:45.540> Sona

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
sivir sona in the second game so Sona

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.840 
sivir sona in the second game so Sona
paired<00:02:46.500> with<00:02:46.650> graves<00:02:46.980> and<00:02:47.220> so<00:02:47.400> no<00:02:47.460> paired<00:02:47.700> with

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
paired with graves and so no paired with

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.820 
paired with graves and so no paired with
sivir<00:02:48.090> and<00:02:48.360> that<00:02:48.690> those<00:02:48.990> are<00:02:49.140> both<00:02:49.290> really

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
sivir and that those are both really

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.350 
sivir and that those are both really
really<00:02:50.340> strong<00:02:50.580> lanes<00:02:50.850> those<00:02:51.030> are<00:02:51.150> some<00:02:51.270> of

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
really strong lanes those are some of

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.730 
really strong lanes those are some of
the<00:02:51.390> strongest<00:02:51.780> lanes<00:02:51.990> Possible's<00:02:52.500> again

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:52.740 
the strongest lanes Possible's again

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:54.620 
the strongest lanes Possible's again
this<00:02:52.890> is<00:02:53.010> before<00:02:53.190> the<00:02:53.460> patch<00:02:53.640> most<00:02:54.300> recent

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:54.630 
this is before the patch most recent

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.480 
this is before the patch most recent
patch<00:02:54.780> with<00:02:54.990> just<00:02:55.170> nerf<00:02:55.350> graves<00:02:55.650> so<00:02:56.190> really

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:56.490 
patch with just nerf graves so really

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:58.250 
patch with just nerf graves so really
strong<00:02:56.790> lanes<00:02:57.000> and<00:02:57.150> in<00:02:57.270> both<00:02:57.450> cases<00:02:57.780> they<00:02:58.200> were

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
strong lanes and in both cases they were

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.440 
strong lanes and in both cases they were
up<00:02:58.440> against<00:02:58.770> vein<00:02:59.070> Jana<00:02:59.460> bottom<00:02:59.850> lanes<00:03:00.060> both

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
up against vein Jana bottom lanes both

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.050 
up against vein Jana bottom lanes both
SK<00:03:00.960> and<00:03:01.110> curse<00:03:01.470> ran<00:03:01.740> vein<00:03:02.040> Jana<00:03:02.370> and<00:03:02.580> the

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
SK and curse ran vein Jana and the

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.820 
SK and curse ran vein Jana and the
result<00:03:03.360> was<00:03:03.480> that<00:03:03.540> both<00:03:04.020> of<00:03:04.200> those<00:03:04.290> lanes<00:03:04.530> just

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
result was that both of those lanes just

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.370 
result was that both of those lanes just
got<00:03:04.950> absolutely<00:03:05.550> destroyed<00:03:06.090> by<00:03:06.270> solomid<00:03:06.780> now

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
got absolutely destroyed by solomid now

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:08.570 
got absolutely destroyed by solomid now
this<00:03:07.530> is<00:03:07.680> something<00:03:07.920> that<00:03:07.950> Varys<00:03:08.370> and<00:03:08.460> I

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
this is something that Varys and I

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.820 
this is something that Varys and I
actually<00:03:08.790> tested<00:03:09.360> up<00:03:09.570> I<00:03:09.810> think<00:03:10.200> about<00:03:10.440> six

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
actually tested up I think about six

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:12.770 
actually tested up I think about six
weeks<00:03:10.980> ago<00:03:11.160> we<00:03:11.520> tried<00:03:11.940> to<00:03:12.090> test<00:03:12.270> playing<00:03:12.540> vein

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
weeks ago we tried to test playing vein

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.200 
weeks ago we tried to test playing vein
Jana<00:03:13.050> and<00:03:13.290> it's<00:03:13.470> just<00:03:13.740> not<00:03:14.070> a<00:03:14.100> good<00:03:14.460> Lane<00:03:14.730> vein

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:15.210 
Jana and it's just not a good Lane vein

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:16.520 
Jana and it's just not a good Lane vein
Jana<00:03:15.510> doesn't<00:03:15.960> really<00:03:16.110> have<00:03:16.260> a<00:03:16.290> lot<00:03:16.470> of

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
Jana doesn't really have a lot of

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.100 
Jana doesn't really have a lot of
synergy<00:03:17.040> doesn't<00:03:17.670> work<00:03:17.850> very<00:03:17.880> well<00:03:18.150> and<00:03:18.510> that

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
synergy doesn't work very well and that

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.680 
synergy doesn't work very well and that
was<00:03:19.260> really<00:03:19.590> on<00:03:19.890> display<00:03:20.280> today<00:03:20.520> in<00:03:20.850> seeing

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
was really on display today in seeing

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.449 
was really on display today in seeing
how<00:03:21.720> solomid<00:03:22.230> just<00:03:22.470> absolutely<00:03:22.950> crushed

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
how solomid just absolutely crushed

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.699 
how solomid just absolutely crushed
these<00:03:23.790> vain<00:03:24.060> Jana<00:03:24.360> bottom<00:03:24.720> lanes<00:03:24.930> so<00:03:25.410> I<00:03:25.440> don't

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
these vain Jana bottom lanes so I don't

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:28.160 
these vain Jana bottom lanes so I don't
suggest<00:03:26.310> playing<00:03:26.820> that<00:03:27.060> Lane<00:03:27.270> and<00:03:27.510> I<00:03:27.780> have<00:03:27.990> had

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
suggest playing that Lane and I have had

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:29.540 
suggest playing that Lane and I have had
some<00:03:28.350> comments<00:03:28.740> and<00:03:28.860> videos<00:03:29.100> I've<00:03:29.280> been

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:29.550 
some comments and videos I've been

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:31.760 
some comments and videos I've been
pretty<00:03:30.030> pretty<00:03:30.870> straight<00:03:31.200> forward<00:03:31.230> in<00:03:31.590> saying

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:31.770 
pretty pretty straight forward in saying

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:34.340 
pretty pretty straight forward in saying
that<00:03:31.980> I<00:03:32.040> think<00:03:32.100> that<00:03:32.640> Sona<00:03:33.060> &amp;<00:03:33.330> Sirocco<00:03:33.750> are<00:03:34.080> the

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
that I think that Sona &amp; Sirocco are the

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:35.600 
that I think that Sona &amp; Sirocco are the
strongest<00:03:34.680> supports<00:03:35.070> a<00:03:35.160> lot<00:03:35.280> of<00:03:35.370> people<00:03:35.459> have

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
strongest supports a lot of people have

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.220 
strongest supports a lot of people have
been<00:03:35.640> saying<00:03:35.850> hey<00:03:36.090> Janice<00:03:36.540> Jan<00:03:36.870> is<00:03:36.990> really

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
been saying hey Janice Jan is really

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.890 
been saying hey Janice Jan is really
good<00:03:37.380> well<00:03:38.070> I<00:03:38.310> like<00:03:38.760> Janna<00:03:39.150> but<00:03:39.390> the<00:03:39.480> results

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
good well I like Janna but the results

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.750 
good well I like Janna but the results
from<00:03:40.050> these<00:03:40.200> games<00:03:40.500> really<00:03:41.100> show<00:03:41.490> that<00:03:41.520> the

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
from these games really show that the

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.790 
from these games really show that the
competitive<00:03:42.240> scene<00:03:42.390> does<00:03:42.630> not<00:03:42.930> value<00:03:43.260> Jana<00:03:43.590> in

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:43.800 
competitive scene does not value Jana in

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.250 
competitive scene does not value Jana in
the<00:03:43.890> same<00:03:44.130> way<00:03:44.340> as<00:03:44.550> Soraka<00:03:45.270> and<00:03:45.540> soda<00:03:45.750> and<00:03:45.930> in

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
the same way as Soraka and soda and in

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:47.930 
the same way as Soraka and soda and in
fact<00:03:46.440> I<00:03:46.620> every<00:03:47.070> single<00:03:47.340> game<00:03:47.430> that<00:03:47.490> Jana<00:03:47.790> was

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
fact I every single game that Jana was

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:50.000 
fact I every single game that Jana was
played<00:03:48.150> in<00:03:48.300> she<00:03:48.450> lost<00:03:48.690> today<00:03:49.020> so<00:03:49.080> again<00:03:49.650> I<00:03:49.830> know

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
played in she lost today so again I know

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.010 
played in she lost today so again I know
it's<00:03:50.250> a<00:03:50.310> small<00:03:50.550> sample<00:03:50.910> size<00:03:51.060> but<00:03:51.330> if<00:03:51.870> you've

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:52.020 
it's a small sample size but if you've

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:53.900 
it's a small sample size but if you've
been<00:03:52.140> watching<00:03:52.290> the<00:03:52.530> high<00:03:52.740> level<00:03:53.400> streamers

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
been watching the high level streamers

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.270 
been watching the high level streamers
for<00:03:53.940> a<00:03:54.120> long<00:03:54.360> time<00:03:54.600> now<00:03:54.630> it's<00:03:54.959> pretty<00:03:55.740> obvious

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
for a long time now it's pretty obvious

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.520 
for a long time now it's pretty obvious
that<00:03:56.310> Sona<00:03:56.730> and<00:03:56.910> Soraka<00:03:57.180> are<00:03:57.420> considered<00:03:57.810> by

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
that Sona and Soraka are considered by

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.470 
that Sona and Soraka are considered by
far<00:03:58.890> above<00:03:59.220> the<00:03:59.340> other<00:03:59.490> supports<00:03:59.970> in<00:04:00.150> terms<00:04:00.360> of

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
far above the other supports in terms of

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.090 
far above the other supports in terms of
their<00:04:00.630> values<00:04:00.930> so<00:04:01.410> anyway<00:04:01.650> just<00:04:01.800> a<00:04:01.920> couple

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 
their values so anyway just a couple

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:03.260 
their values so anyway just a couple
more<00:04:02.310> things<00:04:02.370> I<00:04:02.670> don't<00:04:02.820> want<00:04:02.940> this<00:04:03.000> video<00:04:03.150> to

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:03.270 
more things I don't want this video to

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:04.880 
more things I don't want this video to
drag<00:04:03.510> on<00:04:03.660> too<00:04:03.810> long<00:04:03.990> some<00:04:04.380> other<00:04:04.530> stuff<00:04:04.740> I

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
drag on too long some other stuff I

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:07.430 
drag on too long some other stuff I
noticed<00:04:05.220> cv<00:04:05.940> clairvoyance<00:04:06.750> is<00:04:06.930> back<00:04:07.230> on

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
noticed cv clairvoyance is back on

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:08.900 
noticed cv clairvoyance is back on
supports<00:04:07.830> again<00:04:08.100> I<00:04:08.280> thought<00:04:08.580> that<00:04:08.790> we<00:04:08.880> might

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
supports again I thought that we might

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:11.030 
supports again I thought that we might
see<00:04:09.300> this<00:04:09.480> it's<00:04:09.720> just<00:04:10.020> so<00:04:10.410> useful<00:04:10.830> in<00:04:10.950> a

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 
see this it's just so useful in a

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.530 
see this it's just so useful in a
tournament<00:04:11.459> setting<00:04:11.730> for<00:04:11.910> real<00:04:12.090> high<00:04:12.300> level

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
tournament setting for real high level

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.630 
tournament setting for real high level
play<00:04:12.750> people<00:04:13.620> have<00:04:13.709> been<00:04:13.739> running<00:04:14.070> heel<00:04:14.370> and

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 
play people have been running heel and

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.240 
play people have been running heel and
flash<00:04:15.060> on<00:04:15.330> supports<00:04:15.840> but<00:04:16.080> CV<00:04:16.530> was<00:04:16.709> back<00:04:16.919> and<00:04:17.160> in

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
flash on supports but CV was back and in

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:18.979 
flash on supports but CV was back and in
fact<00:04:17.370> it<00:04:17.520> was<00:04:17.609> on<00:04:17.760> all<00:04:18.030> the<00:04:18.239> supports<00:04:18.630> all<00:04:18.780> day

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:18.989 
fact it was on all the supports all day

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:20.000 
fact it was on all the supports all day
so<00:04:19.049> I<00:04:19.260> thought<00:04:19.440> that<00:04:19.500> that<00:04:19.680> was<00:04:19.799> pretty

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
so I thought that that was pretty

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:21.260 
so I thought that that was pretty
interesting<00:04:20.280> because<00:04:20.609> we<00:04:20.820> haven't<00:04:21.150> been

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:21.270 
interesting because we haven't been

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:23.090 
interesting because we haven't been
seeing<00:04:21.480> that<00:04:21.600> in<00:04:21.750> a<00:04:21.840> lot<00:04:21.960> of<00:04:22.020> solo<00:04:22.260> queue<00:04:22.530> but

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 
seeing that in a lot of solo queue but

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.700 
seeing that in a lot of solo queue but
in<00:04:23.310> a<00:04:23.400> tournament<00:04:23.850> environment<00:04:24.360> cv<00:04:24.960> more

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710 
in a tournament environment cv more

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:27.080 
in a tournament environment cv more
highly<00:04:26.010> valued<00:04:26.040> and<00:04:26.520> then<00:04:26.850> the<00:04:26.940> other<00:04:27.060> thing

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
highly valued and then the other thing

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.720 
highly valued and then the other thing
that<00:04:27.210> was<00:04:27.419> really

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:27.730 
that was really

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:30.000 
that was really
funny<00:04:27.910> is<00:04:28.150> in<00:04:28.390> the<00:04:28.510> TSM<00:04:29.020> sk<00:04:29.500> game<00:04:29.740> today

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.010 
funny is in the TSM sk game today

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:32.340 
funny is in the TSM sk game today
between<00:04:30.520> solomid<00:04:30.940> and<00:04:31.210> sk<00:04:31.540> they<00:04:32.110> kept

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:32.350 
between solomid and sk they kept

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:34.290 
between solomid and sk they kept
swapping<00:04:32.920> their<00:04:33.070> lanes<00:04:33.340> over<00:04:33.610> and<00:04:33.970> over<00:04:34.090> again

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
swapping their lanes over and over again

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.030 
swapping their lanes over and over again
they<00:04:34.570> kept<00:04:34.720> swapping<00:04:35.230> their<00:04:35.350> top<00:04:35.560> lanes<00:04:35.830> in

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:36.040 
they kept swapping their top lanes in

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:38.580 
they kept swapping their top lanes in
mid<00:04:36.310> lanes<00:04:36.550> because<00:04:37.030> sk<00:04:37.720> was<00:04:37.870> trying<00:04:38.170> to<00:04:38.290> avoid

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:38.590 
mid lanes because sk was trying to avoid

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:41.460 
mid lanes because sk was trying to avoid
a<00:04:38.650> matchup<00:04:39.040> of<00:04:39.370> irelia<00:04:39.880> against<00:04:40.270> teemo<00:04:40.570> and<00:04:40.810> so

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
a matchup of irelia against teemo and so

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:43.140 
a matchup of irelia against teemo and so
they<00:04:41.590> kept<00:04:41.770> trying<00:04:42.010> to<00:04:42.130> swap<00:04:42.460> their<00:04:42.670> lanes<00:04:42.940> to

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.150 
they kept trying to swap their lanes to

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:44.550 
they kept trying to swap their lanes to
avoid<00:04:43.390> that<00:04:43.420> and<00:04:43.750> then<00:04:43.930> solomid<00:04:44.320> kept

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 
avoid that and then solomid kept

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:45.990 
avoid that and then solomid kept
swapping<00:04:44.980> it<00:04:45.070> right<00:04:45.220> back<00:04:45.400> so<00:04:45.640> i<00:04:45.670> think<00:04:45.760> they

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.000 
swapping it right back so i think they

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.640 
swapping it right back so i think they
swapped<00:04:46.270> Elaine's<00:04:46.600> about<00:04:46.840> six<00:04:47.200> or<00:04:47.320> seven

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:47.650 
swapped Elaine's about six or seven

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:49.050 
swapped Elaine's about six or seven
times<00:04:47.680> in<00:04:48.160> the<00:04:48.250> first<00:04:48.430> ten<00:04:48.670> minutes<00:04:48.760> of<00:04:48.970> the

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.060 
times in the first ten minutes of the

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.360 
times in the first ten minutes of the
game<00:04:49.090> and<00:04:49.540> it<00:04:49.720> was<00:04:49.840> really<00:04:50.170> funny<00:04:50.380> but<00:04:51.070> anyway

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.370 
game and it was really funny but anyway

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:52.830 
game and it was really funny but anyway
that's<00:04:51.520> about<00:04:51.790> all<00:04:51.820> I<00:04:52.030> have<00:04:52.180> to<00:04:52.300> say<00:04:52.330> for<00:04:52.510> today

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:52.840 
that's about all I have to say for today

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:54.630 
that's about all I have to say for today
it<00:04:52.930> wasn't<00:04:53.080> some<00:04:53.770> interesting<00:04:54.220> games<00:04:54.400> really

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:54.640
