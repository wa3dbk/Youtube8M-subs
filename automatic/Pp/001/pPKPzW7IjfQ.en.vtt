 happens to be practiced by sellers 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:33.080
 in this week then in this environment 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:36.110
 here we work daily in the 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:38.510
 is a cycle 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:40.610
 practically weekly because we have 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:42.110
 customers in Brazil who need 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:43.760
 charge on a certain day of the week 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:47.060

 momentary dissatisfaction of some 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.160
 flower producers 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:54.800

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:56.870
 is expanding in the country 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:59.630
 so the prospect is quite 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:01.070
 optimistic for the next few years to 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:03.040
 Brazil's trend is to grow 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:05.930
 this is inevitable we have noticed 

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:08.150
 not only by demand and there is demand for 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:10.850
 year then the cooperative cooperatives 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:13.100
 the segment of flowers it grows and there 

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:13.940
 we are going to average 12 to 15 per 

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:15.020
 cent 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:17.660
 was a very strong growth 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:19.880
 significant and demand has been large 

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:21.860
 The availability of the flowers today is 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:24.050
 greater then there is a segment 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:25.460
 very large by the supermarket then the 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:28.130
 people were unable to access the 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:30.979
 flower purchase are passing aa 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:33.229

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:35.390
 flowers at home with flowers 

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:37.250
 then the tendency is for Brazil to grow 

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:39.610
 enough in the next few years this is 

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:39.610
 indisputable
