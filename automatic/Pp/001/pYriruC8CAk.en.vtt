actually can just drill a hole in your
current<00:00:18.060> cowl<00:00:18.270> so<00:00:18.539> all<00:00:18.630> you<00:00:18.779> really<00:00:18.810> need<00:00:19.199> is

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
these directional controls and what I

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:23.660 
these directional controls and what I
found<00:00:22.470> was<00:00:22.650> kind<00:00:22.859> of<00:00:22.890> funny<00:00:23.070> of<00:00:23.220> that<00:00:23.369> there's

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
found was kind of funny of that there's

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.670 
found was kind of funny of that there's
actually<00:00:24.269> that<00:00:24.570> what<00:00:24.750> these<00:00:24.930> plugs<00:00:25.289> actually

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
actually that what these plugs actually

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.910 
actually that what these plugs actually
ends<00:00:25.859> to<00:00:26.160> on<00:00:26.430> the<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.599> mounting<00:00:28.050> part<00:00:28.560> so<00:00:28.740> it

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
ends to on the the mounting part so it

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.370 
ends to on the the mounting part so it
you<00:00:29.279> know<00:00:29.400> it<00:00:29.760> stays<00:00:30.119> there<00:00:30.359> that's<00:00:30.960> actually

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
you know it stays there that's actually

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.030 
you know it stays there that's actually
here<00:00:31.740> on<00:00:31.769> on<00:00:32.550> on<00:00:33.239> my<00:00:33.420> 2002<00:00:34.020> LX<00:00:34.410> from<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:34.739> United

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
here on on on my 2002 LX from the United

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.650 
here on on on my 2002 LX from the United
States<00:00:35.070> so<00:00:35.520> I'm<00:00:35.610> just<00:00:35.940> assuming<00:00:36.090> that<00:00:36.360> it's<00:00:36.510> on

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
States so I'm just assuming that it's on

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.830 
States so I'm just assuming that it's on
every<00:00:37.110> single<00:00:37.320> car<00:00:37.940> every<00:00:38.940> single<00:00:39.210> focus<00:00:39.570> they

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
every single car every single focus they

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.020 
every single car every single focus they
just<00:00:40.260> for<00:00:40.530> some<00:00:40.680> reason<00:00:40.860> didn't<00:00:41.460> think<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:41.790> US

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
just for some reason didn't think the US

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.270 
just for some reason didn't think the US
customers<00:00:42.480> would<00:00:42.719> want<00:00:42.930> that<00:00:43.140> function<00:00:43.829> but

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
customers would want that function but

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.279 
customers would want that function but
the<00:00:44.399> holes<00:00:44.550> there<00:00:44.820> so<00:00:45.149> if<00:00:45.270> you<00:00:45.450> want<00:00:45.750> to<00:00:45.960> add<00:00:46.110> it

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
the holes there so if you want to add it

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.340 
the holes there so if you want to add it
all<00:00:46.680> you<00:00:46.920> need<00:00:47.129> is<00:00:47.309> this<00:00:47.460> stock<00:00:47.760> and<00:00:48.149> then<00:00:48.350> some

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
all you need is this stock and then some

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.670 
all you need is this stock and then some
wire<00:00:49.559> to<00:00:49.920> to<00:00:50.160> run<00:00:50.309> to<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.520> stereo<00:00:50.940> but<00:00:51.719> the

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
wire to to run to the stereo but the

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.160 
wire to to run to the stereo but the
measure<00:00:52.980> had<00:00:53.430> posted<00:00:53.760> a<00:00:53.850> video<00:00:53.969> on<00:00:54.570> how<00:00:55.110> to

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
measure had posted a video on how to

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.709 
measure had posted a video on how to
actually<00:00:55.469> get<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.430> block<00:00:56.820> of<00:00:56.940> a<00:00:57.030> head<00:00:57.210> unit<00:00:57.390> to

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
actually get the block of a head unit to

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.920 
actually get the block of a head unit to
interface<00:00:58.199> with<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:59.210> remote<00:01:00.210> control<00:01:01.579> but

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:02.930 
interface with the remote control but

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.810 
interface with the remote control but
the<00:01:03.930> actual<00:01:04.470> head<00:01:04.739> unit<00:01:05.040> doesn't<00:01:05.369> have<00:01:05.519> that

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
the actual head unit doesn't have that

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.240 
the actual head unit doesn't have that
functionality<00:01:06.510> built<00:01:06.689> in<00:01:06.960> so<00:01:07.229> there's<00:01:07.500> about

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
functionality built in so there's about

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.340 
functionality built in so there's about
14<00:01:09.000> different<00:01:09.180> wires<00:01:09.540> you<00:01:09.840> actually<00:01:10.140> have<00:01:10.260> to

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
14 different wires you actually have to

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.940 
14 different wires you actually have to
solder<00:01:10.590> on<00:01:10.890> to<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.580> actual<00:01:12.590> LCD<00:01:13.590> on<00:01:13.619> the

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
solder on to the actual LCD on the

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:14.600 
solder on to the actual LCD on the
backside

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
backside

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.200 
backside
I'll<00:01:14.939> show<00:01:15.150> pictures<00:01:15.540> of<00:01:15.840> that<00:01:16.080> but<00:01:17.070> so<00:01:18.060> it's

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
I'll show pictures of that but so it's

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.880 
I'll show pictures of that but so it's
kind<00:01:18.360> of<00:01:18.390> complicated<00:01:18.689> it's<00:01:19.409> only<00:01:19.560> if<00:01:19.770> you

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
kind of complicated it's only if you

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.890 
kind of complicated it's only if you
really<00:01:20.189> want<00:01:20.460> to<00:01:21.270> actually<00:01:21.420> have<00:01:21.600> those

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
really want to actually have those

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.660 
really want to actually have those
stereo<00:01:22.650> controls<00:01:22.860> I<00:01:23.130> thought<00:01:23.310> it<00:01:23.400> was<00:01:23.490> kind<00:01:23.640> of

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
stereo controls I thought it was kind of

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.969 
stereo controls I thought it was kind of
cool<00:01:23.850> and<00:01:24.090> now<00:01:24.840> that<00:01:25.020> I<00:01:25.049> have<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:25.409> controls<00:01:25.770> I

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
cool and now that I have the controls I

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.859 
cool and now that I have the controls I
thought<00:01:26.159> that<00:01:26.280> was<00:01:26.369> really<00:01:26.549> cool<00:01:26.790> so<00:01:27.150> actually

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
thought that was really cool so actually

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.960 
thought that was really cool so actually
give<00:01:27.990> you<00:01:28.080> an<00:01:28.170> example<00:01:28.530> of<00:01:28.950> what<00:01:29.490> it<00:01:29.610> all<00:01:29.700> does

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
give you an example of what it all does

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.050 
give you an example of what it all does
turn<00:01:30.360> it<00:01:30.479> on<00:01:30.770> the<00:01:31.770> same<00:01:32.369> functions<00:01:32.820> still

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
turn it on the same functions still

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.690 
turn it on the same functions still
there<00:01:33.299> on<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.630> volume<00:01:34.020> control<00:01:34.439> and<00:01:34.770> also<00:01:34.979> you

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
there on the volume control and also you

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.630 
there on the volume control and also you
know<00:01:35.790> on<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.090> seek<00:01:36.299> functions<00:01:37.220> but<00:01:38.220> when<00:01:38.549> you

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
know on the seek functions but when you

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.289 
know on the seek functions but when you
come<00:01:38.790> over<00:01:38.939> to<00:01:39.180> here<00:01:40.070> you<00:01:41.070> can<00:01:41.310> turn<00:01:42.060> up<00:01:42.240> the

change the input and it'll actually go

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.540 
change the input and it'll actually go
to<00:02:11.200> sometimes<00:02:12.200> it<00:02:12.500> goes<00:02:12.560> FM<00:02:12.920> to<00:02:13.100> not<00:02:13.430> sure

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
to sometimes it goes FM to not sure

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.250 
to sometimes it goes FM to not sure
really<00:02:13.880> why<00:02:14.000> that<00:02:14.240> does<00:02:14.420> that<00:02:14.600> but<00:02:14.840> it<00:02:14.870> should

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
really why that does that but it should

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.890 
really why that does that but it should
go<00:02:15.470> straight<00:02:15.890> to<00:02:16.010> CD<00:02:16.430> I<00:02:16.700> don't<00:02:17.300> have<00:02:17.420> any<00:02:17.570> CDs

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
go straight to CD I don't have any CDs

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.120 
go straight to CD I don't have any CDs
in<00:02:18.140> there<00:02:18.320> so<00:02:18.560> it's<00:02:18.710> not<00:02:18.800> going<00:02:18.920> to<00:02:19.010> do

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
in there so it's not going to do

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.610 
in there so it's not going to do
anything<00:02:19.340> and<00:02:19.730> then<00:02:20.180> you<00:02:20.360> can<00:02:20.510> also<00:02:20.660> go<00:02:21.110> to<00:02:21.140> see

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
videos you'll see that I've added

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.320 
videos you'll see that I've added
bluetooth<00:02:26.720> and<00:02:27.080> auxiliary<00:02:27.680> input<00:02:28.130> and<00:02:28.790> that's

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
bluetooth and auxiliary input and that's

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.660 
bluetooth and auxiliary input and that's
what<00:02:29.510> that's<00:02:29.660> controlled<00:02:30.110> by<00:02:30.200> so<00:02:30.770> right<00:02:31.460> now<00:02:31.640> I

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
what that's controlled by so right now I

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.800 
what that's controlled by so right now I

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
have my iPad synced up to it so I just

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.840 
have my iPad synced up to it so I just
hit<00:02:36.140> play<00:02:36.290> on<00:02:36.709> that<00:02:37.670> it<00:02:38.209> should<00:02:38.690> start<00:02:39.850> hmm

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:49.860 
maybe it's not synced up press that
button<00:02:43.580> and<00:02:46.270> it's<00:02:47.270> gonna<00:02:47.480> play<00:02:48.490> there<00:02:49.490> it<00:02:49.580> is

volume<00:02:55.220> down<00:02:55.580> that's<00:02:56.180> all<00:02:56.330> you<00:02:56.480> can<00:02:56.570> really<00:02:56.720> do

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
volume down that's all you can really do

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.620 
volume down that's all you can really do
the<00:02:57.170> seek<00:02:57.380> buttons<00:02:58.180> don't<00:02:59.180> actually<00:02:59.360> do
