hook

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.800 

the<00:01:58.100> hook<00:01:58.310> will<00:01:58.490> fit<00:01:58.670> into<00:01:58.850> that<00:01:59.090> data<00:01:59.450> like

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
the hook will fit into that data like

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.510 
the hook will fit into that data like
that<00:01:59.840> the<00:02:00.350> main<00:02:00.530> reason<00:02:00.590> for<00:02:00.920> that<00:02:01.130> is<00:02:01.310> when<00:02:01.490> I

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
that the main reason for that is when I

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:02.980 
that the main reason for that is when I
put<00:02:01.700> the<00:02:01.880> screw<00:02:02.149> in<00:02:02.299> there<00:02:02.450> I<00:02:02.509> don't<00:02:02.750> want<00:02:02.899> this

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
put the screw in there I don't want this

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:08.889 
put the screw in there I don't want this
to<00:02:03.200> swing<00:02:03.530> side-to-side<00:02:07.300> and<00:02:08.300> I<00:02:08.509> need<00:02:08.660> to<00:02:08.750> just
