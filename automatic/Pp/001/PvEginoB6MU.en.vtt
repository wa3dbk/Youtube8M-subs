00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
enough characters were given where the

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.680 
enough characters were given where the
hackers<00:01:24.470> were<00:01:24.500> able<00:01:24.979> to<00:01:25.010> figure<00:01:25.340> out<00:01:25.610> that<00:01:26.360> it

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:26.690 
hackers were able to figure out that it

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.140 
hackers were able to figure out that it
was<00:01:26.930> the<00:01:26.960> same<00:01:27.409> sub<00:01:27.740> address<00:01:28.070> as<00:01:28.280> his<00:01:28.640> gmail

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.150

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.480 
was the same sub address as his gmail
account<00:01:29.479> so<00:01:29.750> here<00:01:30.290> is<00:01:30.439> where<00:01:30.710> the<00:01:30.860> stupid<00:01:31.100> part

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
account so here is where the stupid part

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.060 
account so here is where the stupid part
actually<00:01:31.760> begins<00:01:32.500> basically<00:01:33.500> the<00:01:33.619> key<00:01:33.860> to

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
actually begins basically the key to

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:35.620 
actually begins basically the key to
