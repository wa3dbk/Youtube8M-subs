little bit more but um yeah going down
into<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.710> mine<00:01:02.629> it's<00:01:03.629> a<00:01:03.780> long<00:01:03.960> trek<00:01:06.530> basically

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
into the mine it's a long trek basically

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.270 
into the mine it's a long trek basically
what<00:01:07.680> I<00:01:07.710> do<00:01:07.830> and<00:01:08.070> I<00:01:08.159> mind<00:01:08.430> I<00:01:08.670> don't<00:01:09.479> I<00:01:10.280> don't

what I do and I mind I don't I don't
follow<00:01:11.820> any<00:01:12.119> of<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.380> mining<00:01:13.380> guides<00:01:13.680> they've

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
follow any of the mining guides they've

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:23.120 
follow any of the mining guides they've
sort<00:01:14.460> of<00:01:14.549> came<00:01:14.729> up<00:01:14.760> with<00:01:16.189> I<00:01:19.430> um<00:01:21.680> all<00:01:22.680> I<00:01:22.740> do

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
sort of came up with I um all I do

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.550 
sort of came up with I um all I do
basically<00:01:23.820> is<00:01:23.970> just<00:01:24.119> cut<00:01:24.630> holes<00:01:24.930> into<00:01:25.229> stuff

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
basically is just cut holes into stuff

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.830 
basically is just cut holes into stuff
and<00:01:25.650> keep<00:01:25.830> going<00:01:28.400> like<00:01:29.400> over<00:01:29.729> here<00:01:30.150> I<00:01:30.299> built

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
and keep going like over here I built

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.819 
and keep going like over here I built
this<00:01:30.930> bridge<00:01:31.920> over<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.549> lava<00:01:33.049> came<00:01:34.049> over<00:01:34.350> here

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
this bridge over the lava came over here

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:40.100 
this bridge over the lava came over here
and<00:01:35.869> as<00:01:36.869> you<00:01:37.259> can<00:01:37.560> see<00:01:37.590> i<00:01:38.329> just<00:01:39.329> cut<00:01:39.540> holes<00:01:39.780> into

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
and as you can see i just cut holes into

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:46.340 
and as you can see i just cut holes into
stuff<00:01:40.470> and<00:01:40.770> then<00:01:40.950> keep<00:01:41.310> going<00:01:43.250> like<00:01:44.250> um<00:01:45.350> let's

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
stuff and then keep going like um let's

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.870 
stuff and then keep going like um let's
start<00:01:46.619> anymore<00:01:46.860> I<00:01:48.140> only<00:01:49.140> do<00:01:49.320> two<00:01:49.619> tall<00:01:49.920> because

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
start anymore I only do two tall because

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.970 
start anymore I only do two tall because
quite<00:01:51.329> frankly<00:01:51.390> that's<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.200> fastest

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:54.980 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:02:01.450 

it<00:01:55.880> obviously<00:01:56.030> doesn't<00:01:56.480> keep<00:01:56.750> going<00:02:00.460> tried

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
it obviously doesn't keep going tried

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.640 
it obviously doesn't keep going tried
over<00:02:01.760> here<00:02:02.180> to<00:02:02.330> do<00:02:02.450> the<00:02:02.600> same<00:02:02.840> thing<00:02:03.170> obviously

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:05.650 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.290 

there's<00:02:06.650> no<00:02:06.770> real<00:02:06.980> rhyme<00:02:07.310> or<00:02:07.580> reason<00:02:07.610> to<00:02:08.030> what

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
there's no real rhyme or reason to what

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.020 
there's no real rhyme or reason to what
i<00:02:08.330> do<00:02:08.450> while<00:02:08.869> mining<00:02:09.140> but<00:02:10.010> i<00:02:10.310> don't<00:02:10.760> think

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
i do while mining but i don't think

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.560 
i do while mining but i don't think
that's<00:02:11.150> necessarily<00:02:11.840> a<00:02:11.990> bad<00:02:12.290> thing<00:02:12.350> i<00:02:13.360> kind<00:02:14.360> of

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:14.570 
that's necessarily a bad thing i kind of

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:19.180 
that's necessarily a bad thing i kind of
like<00:02:14.630> just<00:02:14.930> going<00:02:16.210> it's<00:02:17.210> a<00:02:17.540> it's<00:02:18.190> relaxed

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
like just going it's a it's relaxed

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:26.650 
like just going it's a it's relaxed
saying<00:02:19.660> it's<00:02:20.660> fun<00:02:21.880> and<00:02:23.350> you<00:02:24.350> find<00:02:24.950> stuff<00:02:25.660> then

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
saying it's fun and you find stuff then

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.230 
saying it's fun and you find stuff then
we<00:02:26.690> just<00:02:27.050> hallowed<00:02:27.560> this<00:02:27.740> area<00:02:28.160> out<00:02:28.460> we<00:02:29.000> got

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:29.240 
we just hallowed this area out we got

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:35.140 
we just hallowed this area out we got
some<00:02:30.110> I<00:02:30.260> Ron<00:02:30.530> I<00:02:32.980> just<00:02:33.980> try<00:02:34.190> to<00:02:34.220> find<00:02:34.550> lava<00:02:34.760> pools

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
some I Ron I just try to find lava pools

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.920 
some I Ron I just try to find lava pools
basically<00:02:35.930> and<00:02:36.200> drill<00:02:36.620> off<00:02:36.800> a<00:02:36.830> bunch<00:02:37.190> of

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
basically and drill off a bunch of

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:45.700 
basically and drill off a bunch of
little<00:02:38.930> tunnels<00:02:39.440> off<00:02:39.620> of<00:02:39.890> them<00:02:40.100> I<00:02:44.590> didn't<00:02:45.590> want

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:45.710 
little tunnels off of them I didn't want

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:51.640 
little tunnels off of them I didn't want
to<00:02:45.770> do<00:02:45.890> that<00:02:49.420> get<00:02:50.420> back<00:02:50.600> a<00:02:50.630> level<00:02:51.050> up<00:02:51.200> in<00:02:51.440> case

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
to do that get back a level up in case

00:02:51.650 --> 00:03:00.160 
to do that get back a level up in case
there's<00:02:51.860> any<00:02:51.950> level<00:02:52.570> la<00:02:53.570> ville<00:02:57.940> and<00:02:59.110> you<00:03:00.110> know

there's any level la ville and you know
we<00:03:00.290> came<00:03:00.440> up<00:03:00.730> and<00:03:01.730> we'll<00:03:01.970> do<00:03:02.090> it<00:03:02.209> again<00:03:02.300> right

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
we came up and we'll do it again right

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:10.630 
we came up and we'll do it again right
here<00:03:08.080> I'm<00:03:09.080> sure<00:03:09.500> that<00:03:09.740> there's<00:03:09.890> probably<00:03:10.310> some

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:10.640 
here I'm sure that there's probably some

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:15.130 
here I'm sure that there's probably some
sort<00:03:10.880> of<00:03:11.030> flaw<00:03:11.360> with<00:03:11.690> my<00:03:11.900> process<00:03:13.630> but<00:03:14.630> I<00:03:14.810> just

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
sort of flaw with my process but I just

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.080 
sort of flaw with my process but I just
make<00:03:15.350> these<00:03:15.560> little<00:03:15.860> things<00:03:15.890> and<00:03:16.670> then<00:03:16.790> I<00:03:16.910> make

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
make these little things and then I make

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:23.640 
make these little things and then I make
little<00:03:17.360> tributaries<00:03:18.080> off<00:03:18.350> of<00:03:18.680> them<00:03:22.060> like

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
little tributaries off of them like

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:26.530 
little tributaries off of them like
let's<00:03:24.650> say<00:03:24.800> I<00:03:25.250> was<00:03:25.430> doing<00:03:25.700> this<00:03:25.820> one<00:03:26.150> I<00:03:26.450> would

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
let's say I was doing this one I would

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:35.440 
let's say I was doing this one I would
say<00:03:26.959> I<00:03:27.260> would<00:03:28.150> cut<00:03:29.150> off<00:03:29.180> this<00:03:29.630> direction<00:03:34.450> the

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
say I would cut off this direction the

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:40.100 
say I would cut off this direction the
lamp

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:45.320 

and<00:03:41.110> just<00:03:41.380> basically<00:03:41.500> keep<00:03:41.950> doing<00:03:42.280> this<00:03:44.040> as

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330 
and just basically keep doing this as

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.540 
and just basically keep doing this as
for<00:03:46.330> different<00:03:46.600> levels<00:03:47.020> I'll<00:03:47.860> basically<00:03:48.370> just

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:48.550 
for different levels I'll basically just

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:57.090 
for different levels I'll basically just
cut<00:03:48.820> a<00:03:49.030> stair<00:03:49.800> and<00:03:51.780> and<00:03:52.780> go<00:03:53.170> up<00:03:55.710> my<00:03:56.710> mining

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:57.100 
cut a stair and and go up my mining

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.690 
cut a stair and and go up my mining
technique<00:03:57.520> is<00:03:57.730> not<00:03:57.940> complex<00:03:59.220> it's<00:04:00.220> probably

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.700 
technique is not complex it's probably

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.400 
technique is not complex it's probably
not<00:04:00.970> efficient<00:04:01.540> there's<00:04:01.720> probably<00:04:02.050> something

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:02.410 
not efficient there's probably something

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:07.350 
not efficient there's probably something
wrong<00:04:02.740> with<00:04:02.920> it<00:04:03.900> but<00:04:04.900> honestly<00:04:05.830> I<00:04:06.460> enjoy<00:04:07.150> it

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:07.360 
wrong with it but honestly I enjoy it

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.510 
wrong with it but honestly I enjoy it
and<00:04:07.930> it's<00:04:08.170> yielded<00:04:08.620> quite<00:04:08.860> a<00:04:08.890> bit<00:04:09.100> for<00:04:09.310> me<00:04:09.490> so

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:11.520 
and it's yielded quite a bit for me so

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:14.160 
and it's yielded quite a bit for me so
I'm<00:04:12.520> not<00:04:12.760> I'm<00:04:13.300> not<00:04:13.360> going<00:04:13.690> to<00:04:13.750> sit<00:04:13.930> here<00:04:13.990> and
