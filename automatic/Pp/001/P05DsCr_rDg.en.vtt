00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:06.330
 hello everyone with you vaganovich today 

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:08.849
 went to the store 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.490
 actually drove for one nothing 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:15.170
 It was and bought a completely different bought 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:19.949
 conditioner cleaner itself 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:22.439
 visiting kondeya climate games from sewage 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.990
 smells that car fourth year think 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.150
 it's time for but air 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:30.330
 air ducts you so here I looked at 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:34.100
 Drive like we guys clean 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:36.120
 proper air conditioning system 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:41.100
 car ford focus 3 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:43.079
 and I want to note that one hundred percent somewhere 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.079
 just one percent clean properly 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.969
 report on our system 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:51.270
 maybe because it doesn't know or can 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:53.699
 be because one sky 1 he did 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.670
 fasting and everyone started to do what it is 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.620
 what happens on the posts of our guys then 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:03.559
 there we take open the balloon to 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:08.670
 put it in the legs before the passenger press 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:14.130
 recycling and by what mechanical means 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:18.290
 we kind of fix this button 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:21.720
 so she pressed the ax of something not all 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:25.950
 close the windows of the door and the guys leave it 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:32.450
 wrong now I will explain why this 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:32.450
 moment systems so let's say 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:38.180
 air conditioning and so on 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.680
 typewriters there are two contours 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:43.470
 one of them is a large circuit which 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.229
 sucks in fresh air so let's say with 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:49.049
 streets yah all these collections on 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:51.390
 stand differently with us they stand on saw 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.670
 I must still not go out raining 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.009
 hood you open it here 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.180
 the area where the wipers are two blyamba 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.630
 all all 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.840
 this is ours 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:05.299
 this is how it turns out we have a big 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:09.009
 contour yes here it goes the system we drive 

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:11.360
 there she is standing there the air takes 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:13.819
 cools him either heats and he 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:18.500
 already comes through our fence niki yes 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:22.480
 But in these in these in this kind of car but 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:26.360
 if we go for example we see for example 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:28.910
 cows graze yes there still do not be 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:32.349
 so we begin to understand what will happen now 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:36.920
 full pizdets we press a button 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:39.410
 recycling here she pressed and our air 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:42.019
 began to climb no longer erased fence nikov 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:48.140
 and began to climb as here shows 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:51.590
 below it from the salons through the cabin and start 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:54.920
 walk that is if we clean by 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:56.870
 the contour of a pair of circulation then we clean 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:01.340
 only the inner contour itself. 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:05.120
 clean out there but refresh it so to speak 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:07.970
 so if you are going to clean your 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:10.220
 the system does not matter what you choose what 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:11.829
 there spray not principle is all 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:16.099
 antique 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:19.069
 I'm the one he bought for 180 rubles per hour not 

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:19.910
 be lazy open the hood remove these 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:23.299
 protective 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:26.480
 reshetochki Nahuas account to kindly with 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:27.639
 this cylinder 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.319
 motor 

00:03:27.639 --> 00:03:32.989
 turn on as if I don't know, but I think that 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:34.940
 so that all of a sudden I didn't fly out here 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:38.299
 set speed 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:39.910
 blow half and turn on 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:43.910
 sure car 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:46.040
 why auto because all nozzles 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:49.080
 were involved 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:54.360
 flew the plane so 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:57.090
 accelerating to make it all evenly 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:04:00.930
 Yes, and here in these tubes when this 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:03.480
 all set up here, he hummed start 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.340
 actually pshikat in these tubes in these 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:08.280
 holes 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:11.700
 behind the hood behind ours until we release 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:14.670
 the whole balloon here I am now this thing all 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:17.370
 Of course I will do it just is not possible 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:19.470
 demonstrate it all so not three 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:23.190
 hands this yes and on the forehead the phone is not hunting 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:25.590
 stick here guys so i just 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:27.600
 I wanted to say that maybe someone with 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:30.660
 I can not agree to write in 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:33.570
 comments there why I'm wrong but i 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:36.930
 I still think that cleaning the system 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:38.760
 air conditioning on a small circuit 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:41.700
 there is no sense because the whole smell 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:43.440
 It starts to accumulate precisely fence nikov 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:45.750
 that is, in the first of these fence 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:48.330
 pipes and then you when it comes about 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:50.810
 stove engine itself there already 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:54.240
 principle, nothing remains but exactly 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:55.800
 all this fucking goes with this fence 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:59.040
 nicknames so first of all 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:01.340
 clean from there and inside she is a prize herself 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:05.700
 the first part is that there is not much dirt 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:07.020
 so now keep in mind well what's wrong 

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:09.180
 correct me 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:12.390
 komentah i have served you a lot 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:14.910
 listen to any criticism well i think that 

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:17.960
 so it will be much more appropriate 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:21.180
 better and safer to subtract and their system 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:25.530
 air conditioning car ford focus 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:29.990
 but on this until new meetings 

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:29.990
 nail or rod as they say bye bye
