 You get back from the dough 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:10.530
 I think about 150 at 250 and the 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:13.150
 The remaining 500 guests here are strictly in front 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:16.000

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:46.060
 really managed to blow it today 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:57.000

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:57.000

 two teaspoons a packet of baking powder 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:28.090

 stir stage 5 I'll go again 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:50.610
 then always with the spatula 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:50.610
 a little something gets stuck 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.100
 run through 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:05.160
 55 seconds 

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:11.280
 more 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:19.989

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:53.819
 burn off the brown dough a bit 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:56.440
 So always made a recipe in it 

00:04:53.819 --> 00:04:59.440
 and on top of that, give the recipe 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:02.020
 By the way, of the recipes de but me 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:06.009
 I saw that in the land register 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:09.159
 is it is exactly the same what is not 

00:05:06.009 --> 00:05:10.960
 otherwise it can compensate itself and also 

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:13.960
 the same image and which is at the purchase of 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:17.860

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:21.759

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:24.099
 page so now looks cake in front of the 

00:05:21.759 --> 00:05:28.000

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.560
 top down and then we'll see each other 

00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:34.330
 again so finished is still a bit 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:36.250
 But I had to get to work 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:40.080
 take and usd before I do not care 

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:40.080
 I would rather do the test now 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:00.699
 I know already there I have earlier 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:03.800
 made without appointment 

00:06:00.699 --> 00:06:06.590
 of course, now I think faster 

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:12.080
 The dough is a bit of show court 

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:13.810
 nice though it still likes so much 

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:20.599

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:21.139

00:06:21.139 --> 00:06:30.229
 This pudding mass is delicious 

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:38.479
