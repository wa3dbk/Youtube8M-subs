00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
that we're going to be doing with that

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.730 
that we're going to be doing with that
which<00:02:50.740> is<00:02:50.860> a<00:02:50.890> little<00:02:51.190> bit<00:02:51.310> different<00:02:51.790> than<00:02:52.209> our

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:52.740 
which is a little bit different than our

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:55.860 
which is a little bit different than our
normal<00:02:53.740> fare<00:02:54.370> for<00:02:54.580> dice<00:02:54.730> masters<00:02:55.209> it<00:02:55.510> will<00:02:55.750> be

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.390 
packaged differently configured
differently<00:02:57.580> so<00:02:58.350> think<00:02:59.350> of<00:02:59.410> it<00:02:59.560> more<00:02:59.740> package

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
differently so think of it more package

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.690 
differently so think of it more package
very<00:03:01.209> similar<00:03:01.570> to<00:03:01.600> Cory<00:03:02.080> errs<00:03:02.260> in<00:03:02.530> terms<00:03:03.130> of<00:03:03.400> a

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:03.700 
very similar to Cory errs in terms of a

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.000 
very similar to Cory errs in terms of a
lot<00:03:04.180> of<00:03:04.330> characters<00:03:04.780> in<00:03:04.989> one<00:03:05.410> package<00:03:05.650> box

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010
