00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:54.120 

what<00:02:40.830> yeah<00:02:41.830> I'm<00:02:41.950> out<00:02:42.100> rope

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:03:07.950 

cheese<00:02:55.130> I<00:02:55.310> got<00:02:55.460> that<00:02:55.580> explosion<00:02:56.030> on<00:02:56.300> youtube

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:07.960 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.960 

and<00:03:08.960> the<00:03:09.290> thing<00:03:09.500> is<00:03:09.560> I<00:03:09.980> think<00:03:10.100> that's<00:03:10.580> why<00:03:10.790> they

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
and the thing is I think that's why they

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.120 
and the thing is I think that's why they
should<00:03:11.180> have<00:03:11.390> signs<00:03:11.990> that<00:03:12.560> should<00:03:12.860> be<00:03:12.980> the

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.130 
should have signs that should be the

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:14.740 
should have signs that should be the
size<00:03:13.310> that<00:03:13.550> you<00:03:13.610> have<00:03:13.880> to<00:03:14.060> legally<00:03:14.480> carry

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
size that you have to legally carry

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:16.600 
size that you have to legally carry
