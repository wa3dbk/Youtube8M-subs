00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:57.840 
that's the final question

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:02.060 
that's the final question
how<00:05:58.380> big<00:05:58.590> a<00:05:58.620> part<00:05:58.830> of<00:05:58.949> the<00:05:59.070> wind<00:05:59.280> yeah<00:06:00.110> I<00:06:01.110> don't

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:02.070 
how big a part of the wind yeah I don't

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:05.000 
how big a part of the wind yeah I don't
look<00:06:02.790> somewhat<00:06:03.780> similar<00:06:04.169> or<00:06:04.380> lower<00:06:04.560> percent

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:05.010 
look somewhat similar or lower percent

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:08.570 
look somewhat similar or lower percent
join<00:06:05.220> us<00:06:05.370> too<00:06:05.639> strong<00:06:06.020> I<00:06:07.100> mean<00:06:08.100> at<00:06:08.280> the<00:06:08.400> end<00:06:08.430> of

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:08.580 
join us too strong I mean at the end of

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:10.790 
join us too strong I mean at the end of
it<00:06:08.699> wasn't<00:06:09.540> like<00:06:09.630> a<00:06:09.720> huge<00:06:09.750> Wyatt<00:06:10.199> build<00:06:10.440> idiot

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:10.800 
it wasn't like a huge Wyatt build idiot

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:13.250 
it wasn't like a huge Wyatt build idiot
sometimes<00:06:11.040> yes<00:06:11.610> like<00:06:11.880> you<00:06:12.030> said<00:06:12.210> it's<00:06:12.870> very

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:13.260 
sometimes yes like you said it's very

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:14.780 
sometimes yes like you said it's very
difficult<00:06:13.500> to<00:06:13.800> measure<00:06:14.070> how<00:06:14.400> important

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:14.790 
difficult to measure how important

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:16.100 
difficult to measure how important
enough<00:06:15.030> controllers<00:06:15.510> but<00:06:15.720> I<00:06:15.780> think<00:06:16.020> the

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:16.110 
enough controllers but I think the

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:17.300 
enough controllers but I think the
bigger<00:06:16.320> part<00:06:16.590> of<00:06:16.620> the<00:06:16.710> map<00:06:16.830> control<00:06:17.100> is<00:06:17.190> the

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:17.310 
bigger part of the map control is the

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:18.950 
bigger part of the map control is the
talents<00:06:18.030> they<00:06:18.120> got<00:06:18.270> early<00:06:18.540> i<00:06:18.570> don't<00:06:18.780> feel<00:06:18.900> like

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:18.960 
talents they got early i don't feel like

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:20.689 
talents they got early i don't feel like
techies<00:06:19.320> nicholas<00:06:19.650> necessary<00:06:20.160> to<00:06:20.310> platos

00:06:20.689 --> 00:06:20.699 
techies nicholas necessary to platos

00:06:20.699 --> 00:06:23.360 
techies nicholas necessary to platos
yeah<00:06:21.150> and<00:06:21.389> it<00:06:21.510> just<00:06:21.690> they<00:06:22.380> the<00:06:22.830> map<00:06:23.040> control

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:23.370 
yeah and it just they the map control
