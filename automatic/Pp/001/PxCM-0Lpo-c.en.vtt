00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 hello everyone, this video I hope will be 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.430
 short devoted quite simple topic 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.259
 such as installing google launcher 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.420
 start called the company so loved 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.490
 many on nexus 5 shell main menu 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.929
 and desktop on the device for 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.389
 which launcher and not actually 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.980
 intended not long ago 2 February 6 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.170
 the ability to install this very 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.910
 launcher opened for the owners of nexus 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.519
 devices and smartphones from the google line 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.810
 play edition based on android with 44 older 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.119
 so at least the description says 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.699
 google play applications but naturally 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.710
 if something can be set then this 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.360
 something must be a package to which 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.030
 can be applied as intended and on 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.010
 devices initially under this case is not 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.379
 intended need a smartphone on 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.450
 android version 41 or higher with 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.670
 set google search it so 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.809
 google sheep google on unicycle what he 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.760
 available in google play 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.469
 i also need google chrome 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.809
 which is actually the very google 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.640
 start and have all the necessary links i 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.399
 I will attach in the description to this video and 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.039
 so here is me samsung galaxy laptop 3 with 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.899
 install touch android 4 4 2 visas on 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.030
 him but as i said we will need 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.729
 and google chrome pod here I have it 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.920
 already in the download there is therefore install 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.330
 her wasting no time at construction sites 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.740
 naturally need to be resolved 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.750
 installation from unknown sources 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.430
 after which the installation in my case 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.430
 just continue push install 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.920
 the application is being installed 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.380
 applications just called panel 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.400
 launch until we open it after 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.770
 than we can actually push the button 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.810
 home and we will have the opportunity 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.670
 select the shell in which we want 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.340
 come back and here we see google start 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.180
 which one actually choose and 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.369
 own work on this very 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.840
 desktop caused by sharp us left 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.299
 right if you like to use 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.770
 Huns use it and you already have it 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.270
 you know enough to give you 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.119
 really helpful and need tips 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.500
 why actually there is no application menu 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.700
 in fact, too, no longer looks 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.610
 like samsung 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.200
 and how on the present high-grade to 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.759
 android device nexus 5 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.130
 accordingly no daddies anything 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.770
 because of this can not be true here 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:02.430
 you can still go back to exactly the same 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:04.020
 another variation on the touchwiz screen i will 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.820
 an hour only once so that you can 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.560
 it was still possible to go further 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.140
 choose just always include exactly 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.210
 one of the launchers and no problems with 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.490
 don't test it 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:15.380
 and in general all my widgets are back 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.540
 and everything else and application 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.400
 neatly laid out on all daddies 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.180
 only two screens from me they occupy in 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.890
 this form 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.510
 which especially concerns samsung galaxy 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.310
 the break will or will not 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.260
 work popup menu which 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.150
 appears when extracting the pen and gives 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.490
 access to paint instant screenshots 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.620
 search or short text entries 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:35.810
 With the help of a pen, we do this 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.060
 perfectly appears perfectly cleaned 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.400
 perfectly disappear and is called again on 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:43.190
 right place no problem with that i'm not 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.780
 I feel so who needs someone 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.640
 change the look of your device 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.730
 replace ilon black standard google 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.080
 Alas, who loves Google Naw right there again 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.670
 very interesting option well and 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.620
 actually find Athos I am also given 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.990
 the launcher installed also everything works 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.330
 very good fast shooter no 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:00.950
 I do not see problems if all applications 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.020
 again mixed with each other 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.000
 the very tab jupp which is present 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:07.040
 standard launcher is not available in 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.020
 so google start there is just everything 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.970
 applications in porridge mixed into one big 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:12.530
 a bunch of well actually exactly the same 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:14.570
 how on google on them from bits with no 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.850
 problems, in principle, it does not cause 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:18.980
 and again you can just as well either 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:21.170
 switch between me you term or 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.640
 choose one on a permanent basis and in 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:25.190
 principle to use quite quite 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:27.560
 You can double-finger the same gesture for example 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.840
 works by transferring the image from 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.670
 front edge on the back foot display 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.320
 again no problem with any 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:35.600
 internally own decision about 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:38.420
 yotaphone and I do not watch it works 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:40.970
 running android version 4.2.2 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:42.830
 in general, who likes this 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:44.570
 launcher forward from the song as they say in 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:46.400
 in the end you can always turn it off 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:49.070
 All the necessary links I have already said 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.630
 In the description, in the meantime, thanks for all 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:53.080
 Attention 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:53.080
 will look
