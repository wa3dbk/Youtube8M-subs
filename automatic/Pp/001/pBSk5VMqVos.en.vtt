that wing right so all right let's make

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:25.080 
that wing right so all right let's make
our<00:02:18.160> way<00:02:18.190> over<00:02:18.340> to<00:02:18.900> CDM<00:02:20.130> um<00:02:21.209> we<00:02:22.209> got<00:02:22.240> Sanchez<00:02:24.090> 66

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
our way over to CDM um we got Sanchez 66

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.680 
our way over to CDM um we got Sanchez 66
pace<00:02:26.280> he's<00:02:27.280> pretty<00:02:27.459> good<00:02:27.730> I<00:02:27.760> you<00:02:28.270> need<00:02:28.390> a<00:02:28.450> film

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
pace he's pretty good I you need a film

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.300 
pace he's pretty good I you need a film
kind<00:02:28.930> of<00:02:29.170> exactly<00:02:29.830> he<00:02:29.980> first<00:02:30.220> the

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
kind of exactly he first the

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.460 
kind of exactly he first the
chemistry<00:02:30.760> purposes<00:02:31.270> at<00:02:32.080> least<00:02:32.290> she's

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
chemistry purposes at least she's

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:34.920 
chemistry purposes at least she's
defensive<00:02:33.100> stats<00:02:33.370> or<00:02:33.550> not<00:02:33.670> that<00:02:33.880> bad<00:02:34.330> his

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
defensive stats or not that bad his

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.740 
defensive stats or not that bad his
paste<00:02:35.680> I<00:02:36.040> mean<00:02:36.190> his<00:02:36.400> passing<00:02:36.910> is<00:02:37.060> also<00:02:37.510> decent

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
paste I mean his passing is also decent

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.110 
paste I mean his passing is also decent
so<00:02:38.110> that's<00:02:38.560> about<00:02:38.680> yes<00:02:39.430> it's<00:02:39.670> pretty<00:02:39.880> good<00:02:40.060> for

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
so that's about yes it's pretty good for

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.449 
so that's about yes it's pretty good for
that<00:02:40.840> position<00:02:41.020> alright<00:02:41.760> so<00:02:42.760> I<00:02:42.790> RM<00:02:43.390> we<00:02:43.959> got
