even call it a revamp its basically the

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.000 
even call it a revamp its basically the

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.600 
instead of just instead of touching it

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:37.459 
and so on which is pretty cool and also

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:39.160

we<00:03:37.760> can't<00:03:37.970> demo<00:03:38.150> it<00:03:38.330> on<00:03:38.450> camera<00:03:38.720> right<00:03:38.900> now<00:03:38.959> so

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
we can't demo it on camera right now so

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:40.780 
we can't demo it on camera right now so
can't<00:03:39.440> get<00:03:39.530> a<00:03:39.590> good<00:03:39.680> angle<00:03:39.830> but<00:03:40.099> there's<00:03:40.340> also

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
can't get a good angle but there's also

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:42.190 
can't get a good angle but there's also
the<00:03:40.970> enhanced<00:03:41.360> smarts<00:03:41.599> a<00:03:41.690> function<00:03:41.989> at<00:03:42.050> ur<00:03:42.080> we

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
the enhanced smarts a function at ur we

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.020 
the enhanced smarts a function at ur we
can<00:03:42.319> look<00:03:42.410> at<00:03:42.500> the<00:03:42.590> bottom<00:03:42.860> of<00:03:42.890> say<00:03:43.310> a<00:03:43.580> browser

we're<00:03:46.640> going<00:03:46.760> to<00:03:46.819> check<00:03:47.060> and<00:03:47.239> see<00:03:47.300> how<00:03:47.959> how

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
we're going to check and see how how

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:50.530 
we're going to check and see how how
well<00:03:48.709> that<00:03:48.920> responds<00:03:49.430> but<00:03:49.640> compared<00:03:50.360> to<00:03:50.450> the

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
well that responds but compared to the

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.000 
well that responds but compared to the
smart<00:03:50.780> stay<00:03:50.959> only<00:03:51.110> functionality<00:03:51.739> on<00:03:51.769> the<00:03:51.890> s3

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
smart stay only functionality on the s3

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.130 
smart stay only functionality on the s3
that's<00:03:52.880> a<00:03:53.090> significant<00:03:53.599> improvement<00:03:53.690> on<00:03:54.050> that

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:54.140 
that's a significant improvement on that

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.350 
that's a significant improvement on that
shows<00:03:54.319> some<00:03:54.349> innovation<00:03:54.920> in<00:03:55.519> the<00:03:55.580> skin<00:03:56.209> that

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:56.360 
shows some innovation in the skin that

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.809 
shows some innovation in the skin that
has<00:03:56.450> otherwise<00:03:56.980> substantially<00:03:57.980> the<00:03:58.160> same<00:03:58.370> so

00:03:58.809 --> 00:03:58.819 
has otherwise substantially the same so

00:03:58.819 --> 00:03:59.920 
has otherwise substantially the same so
once<00:03:58.970> again<00:03:59.060> just<00:03:59.300> a<00:03:59.390> quick<00:03:59.569> look<00:03:59.780> at<00:03:59.900> the
