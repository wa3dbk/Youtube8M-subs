that fishing there's a little small just
under<00:02:50.170> 20<00:02:50.560> yeah<00:02:51.090> it's<00:02:52.090> gonna<00:02:52.239> be<00:02:52.390> 20<00:02:52.750> years

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
under 20 yeah it's gonna be 20 years

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:54.780 
under 20 yeah it's gonna be 20 years
even<00:02:53.020> though<00:02:53.380> they're<00:02:53.650> flatfish<00:02:54.190> hold<00:02:54.580> it<00:02:54.700> up

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
even though they're flatfish hold it up

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:56.490 
even though they're flatfish hold it up
so<00:02:54.820> they<00:02:55.060> can<00:02:55.239> appreciate<00:02:55.570> how<00:02:55.989> thick<00:02:56.230> it<00:02:56.380> is

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
so they can appreciate how thick it is

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.350 
so they can appreciate how thick it is
you<00:02:57.130> know<00:02:57.250> you've<00:02:57.670> got<00:02:57.820> some<00:02:58.000> really<00:02:58.209> nice

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
filets people want to stake them or

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:02.910 
filets people want to stake them or
cubed<00:03:01.420> on<00:03:01.570> that<00:03:01.720> look<00:03:02.019> it<00:03:02.170> he<00:03:02.320> had<00:03:02.709> something

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
cubed on that look it he had something

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.610 
cubed on that look it he had something
left<00:03:03.310> over<00:03:03.489> for<00:03:03.820> me<00:03:03.910> that<00:03:04.810> is<00:03:04.930> a<00:03:04.959> gorgeous<00:03:05.410> fish

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
I'm just amazed how hard these fish

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.920 
I'm just amazed how hard these fish
attack<00:03:09.280> beta<00:03:09.670> like<00:03:10.120> we're<00:03:10.300> using<00:03:10.420> those<00:03:10.660> jigs

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
attack beta like we're using those jigs

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:14.250 
attack beta like we're using those jigs
in<00:03:11.080> really<00:03:12.060> what<00:03:13.060> a<00:03:13.120> Gorger<00:03:13.510> not<00:03:13.750> just<00:03:14.080> the

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
in really what a Gorger not just the

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:15.880 
in really what a Gorger not just the
bottom<00:03:14.770> feeder<00:03:15.040> there

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:15.890 
bottom feeder there

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:17.290 
bottom feeder there
and<00:03:16.280> you<00:03:16.370> hold<00:03:16.520> them<00:03:16.610> up<00:03:16.700> a<00:03:16.820> little<00:03:16.910> bit<00:03:17.120> higher

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:17.300 
and you hold them up a little bit higher

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.810 
and you hold them up a little bit higher
yeah<00:03:17.480> absolutely<00:03:17.980> not<00:03:18.980> that<00:03:19.190> big<00:03:19.430> you<00:03:19.580> can<00:03:19.700> say

00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:08.569 
200 pound test now with this rod I also

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:12.009 
200 pound test now with this rod I also

00:04:12.009 --> 00:04:12.019 
have a level wind reel this reel isn't

00:04:12.019 --> 00:04:13.509 
have a level wind reel this reel isn't
really<00:04:12.200> designed<00:04:12.380> to<00:04:12.769> cast<00:04:13.010> and<00:04:13.250> retrieve

00:04:13.509 --> 00:04:13.519 
really designed to cast and retrieve

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:15.699 
really designed to cast and retrieve
like<00:04:13.670> a<00:04:13.700> bait<00:04:13.940> caster<00:04:14.180> it's<00:04:14.930> designed<00:04:15.350> to<00:04:15.470> hold

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:15.709 
like a bait caster it's designed to hold

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:17.890 
like a bait caster it's designed to hold
lots<00:04:15.980> of<00:04:16.160> line<00:04:16.400> and<00:04:16.669> in<00:04:16.760> our<00:04:16.940> case<00:04:17.239> we're<00:04:17.870> using

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:17.900 
lots of line and in our case we're using

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.740 
lots of line and in our case we're using
50<00:04:18.650> pound<00:04:18.889> braided<00:04:19.190> line<00:04:19.519> and<00:04:19.820> it<00:04:20.239> also<00:04:20.419> has<00:04:20.720> a

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:20.750 
50 pound braided line and it also has a

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:22.870 
50 pound braided line and it also has a
counter<00:04:21.410> if<00:04:21.590> you<00:04:21.620> wanted<00:04:22.010> to<00:04:22.160> see<00:04:22.400> how<00:04:22.669> much

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880 
counter if you wanted to see how much

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:24.700 
counter if you wanted to see how much
line<00:04:23.210> you're<00:04:23.419> letting<00:04:23.720> out<00:04:23.840> but<00:04:24.320> we<00:04:24.470> know<00:04:24.590> how

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:24.710 
line you're letting out but we know how

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:26.320 
line you're letting out but we know how
deep<00:04:24.919> it<00:04:25.100> is<00:04:25.190> because<00:04:25.520> we're<00:04:25.700> using<00:04:25.850> a<00:04:26.060> sonar

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330 
deep it is because we're using a sonar

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:29.530 
deep it is because we're using a sonar
so<00:04:26.990> the<00:04:27.139> level<00:04:27.470> wind<00:04:27.710> reel<00:04:28.040> is<00:04:28.370> ideal<00:04:29.060> because

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:29.540 
so the level wind reel is ideal because

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:32.020 
so the level wind reel is ideal because
it's<00:04:29.900> very<00:04:30.110> simple<00:04:30.620> to<00:04:30.860> use<00:04:31.070> all<00:04:31.400> you<00:04:31.639> do<00:04:31.910> is

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.030 
it's very simple to use all you do is

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:33.909 
it's very simple to use all you do is
hit<00:04:32.210> the<00:04:32.389> lever<00:04:32.630> to<00:04:32.930> release<00:04:32.960> the<00:04:33.470> line<00:04:33.650> out

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:33.919 
hit the lever to release the line out

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:35.770 
hit the lever to release the line out
when<00:04:34.430> the<00:04:34.550> line<00:04:34.700> hits<00:04:34.910> the<00:04:35.060> bottom<00:04:35.389> lock<00:04:35.600> the

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:35.780 
when the line hits the bottom lock the

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:37.870 
when the line hits the bottom lock the
lever<00:04:35.960> and<00:04:36.440> then<00:04:36.770> you<00:04:36.919> have<00:04:37.070> a<00:04:37.100> very<00:04:37.220> simple

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:37.880
