already cracked open Heidi already found

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.820 
already cracked open Heidi already found
it<00:01:05.640> but<00:01:06.270> there<00:01:06.479> again<00:01:06.600> you<00:01:06.990> can<00:01:07.140> see<00:01:07.170> it's<00:01:07.680> a

hazelnut<00:01:08.360> it's<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.600> seed<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.170> hazelnut

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
hazelnut it's the seed the hazelnut

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.980 
hazelnut it's the seed the hazelnut
itself<00:01:11.100> is<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.490> seed<00:01:11.790> in<00:01:12.030> sight<00:01:12.299> here's<00:01:12.810> what

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
itself is the seed in sight here's what

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.330 
itself is the seed in sight here's what
that<00:01:13.020> haze<00:01:13.380> it<00:01:13.500> up<00:01:13.590> so<00:01:13.770> they<00:01:13.890> would<00:01:14.040> be<00:01:14.130> over

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
that haze it up so they would be over

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.880 
that haze it up so they would be over
here<00:01:14.750> sure<00:01:15.750> they<00:01:15.900> would<00:01:16.020> be<00:01:16.110> smacking<00:01:16.650> it<00:01:16.770> on

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
here sure they would be smacking it on

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.100 
here sure they would be smacking it on
that<00:01:17.159> then<00:01:17.850> they'd<00:01:17.970> be<00:01:18.030> opening<00:01:18.689> up<00:01:18.810> the

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
that then they'd be opening up the

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.530 
that then they'd be opening up the
hazelnut<00:01:19.650> shell<00:01:20.460> and<00:01:20.759> there<00:01:21.060> would<00:01:21.270> be<00:01:21.299> the

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
hazelnut shell and there would be the

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.190 
hazelnut shell and there would be the
hazelnut<00:01:22.250> ok<00:01:23.250> now<00:01:24.180> the<00:01:24.240> seed<00:01:24.780> is<00:01:24.990> very

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
hazelnut ok now the seed is very

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.679 
hazelnut ok now the seed is very
important<00:01:25.770> in<00:01:25.890> this<00:01:26.430> case<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:27.000> seed<00:01:27.299> is<00:01:27.540> the

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
important in this case the seed is the

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.710 
important in this case the seed is the
actual<00:01:28.140> edible<00:01:28.740> part<00:01:29.040> and<00:01:29.340> is<00:01:30.299> where<00:01:30.570> the

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
actual edible part and is where the

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.310 
actual edible part and is where the
protein<00:01:31.409> and<00:01:31.680> the<00:01:31.710> nourishment<00:01:32.430> is<00:01:32.869> and<00:01:33.869> let's

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
protein and the nourishment is and let's

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.469 
protein and the nourishment is and let's
just<00:01:34.500> understand<00:01:35.430> something<00:01:35.790> Jesus<00:01:36.270> Christ

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
just understand something Jesus Christ

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.399 
just understand something Jesus Christ
compared<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.259> Word<00:01:37.470> of<00:01:37.619> God<00:01:37.880> to<00:01:38.880> a<00:01:38.909> seed<00:01:39.409> now

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
compared the Word of God to a seed now

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:41.990 
compared the Word of God to a seed now
some<00:01:40.740> of<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:40.950> seed<00:01:41.189> could<00:01:41.430> fall<00:01:41.670> on<00:01:41.700> the

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
some of the seed could fall on the

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.149 
some of the seed could fall on the
wayside<00:01:42.479> some<00:01:42.869> of<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.020> seed<00:01:43.259> falls<00:01:43.560> on<00:01:43.799> stony

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
wayside some of the seed falls on stony

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.010 
wayside some of the seed falls on stony
ground<00:01:44.430> some<00:01:45.360> of<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.540> seat<00:01:45.780> can<00:01:46.140> fall<00:01:46.409> on<00:01:46.439> a

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
ground some of the seat can fall on a

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:50.500 
ground some of the seat can fall on a
good<00:01:49.020> ground

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:50.510 
good ground

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:53.230 
good ground
so<00:01:51.140> the<00:01:51.290> Word<00:01:51.530> of<00:01:51.680> God<00:01:51.740> can<00:01:52.730> become<00:01:53.090> the

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
so the Word of God can become the

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.210 
so the Word of God can become the
nourishment<00:01:53.900> the<00:01:54.020> Bible<00:01:54.380> says<00:01:54.590> man<00:01:54.890> can't
