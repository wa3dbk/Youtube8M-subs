00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:01.979 
hey guys so today I want to try out the

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.180 
hey guys so today I want to try out the
benchmark<00:00:02.490> program<00:00:02.939> 3d<00:00:03.659> more<00:00:03.990> couches<00:00:04.589> like

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:05.190 
benchmark program 3d more couches like

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.039 
benchmark program 3d more couches like
best<00:00:05.549> benchmark<00:00:06.089> program<00:00:06.509> i<00:00:06.660> think<00:00:06.870> for

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
best benchmark program i think for

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:08.930 
best benchmark program i think for
mobile<00:00:07.500> smart<00:00:07.830> phones<00:00:07.890> it's<00:00:08.519> pretty<00:00:08.700> heavy

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
mobile smart phones it's pretty heavy

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.509 
mobile smart phones it's pretty heavy
also<00:00:09.450> pretty<00:00:09.929> have<00:00:10.139> your<00:00:10.260> program<00:00:10.650> so<00:00:10.920> it's

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
also pretty have your program so it's

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.390 
also pretty have your program so it's
going<00:00:11.639> to<00:00:11.700> do<00:00:11.880> it<00:00:12.030> over<00:00:12.059> here<00:00:12.360> and<00:00:13.309> the<00:00:14.309> all

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
going to do it over here and the all

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.060 
going to do it over here and the all
sama<00:00:14.730> tried<00:00:15.059> the<00:00:15.240> another<00:00:15.570> test<00:00:15.990> but<00:00:16.890> that

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
sama tried the another test but that

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.120 
sama tried the another test but that
wasn't<00:00:17.220> as<00:00:17.760> fun<00:00:18.000> to<00:00:18.150> look<00:00:18.300> at<00:00:18.510> so<00:00:18.810> i<00:00:19.020> think<00:00:19.980> i'm

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
wasn't as fun to look at so i think i'm

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.439 
wasn't as fun to look at so i think i'm
gonna<00:00:20.250> do<00:00:20.430> the<00:00:20.550> traditional<00:00:20.730> test<00:00:21.270> in<00:00:21.390> this

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
gonna do the traditional test in this

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.660 
gonna do the traditional test in this
video<00:00:21.720> so<00:00:21.900> if<00:00:21.960> i<00:00:22.050> was<00:00:22.170> going<00:00:22.350> to<00:00:22.470> get<00:00:22.859> cut<00:00:23.070> the

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
video so if i was going to get cut the

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.830 
video so if i was going to get cut the

developer I'll get a solemn so for
informing<00:00:40.350> to<00:00:40.440> get<00:00:40.860> cuts<00:00:41.160> and<00:00:41.460> let's<00:00:42.270> do<00:00:42.540> this

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:42.950 
informing to get cuts and let's do this

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.020 
informing to get cuts and let's do this
so<00:00:43.950> you<00:00:44.040> can<00:00:44.160> see<00:00:44.280> that<00:00:44.309> this<00:00:44.460> program<00:00:44.700> is

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
so you can see that this program is

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.290 
so you can see that this program is
saying<00:00:45.450> to<00:00:45.840> me<00:00:45.960> like<00:00:46.260> if<00:00:46.590> you<00:00:47.100> read<00:00:48.030> here

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
saying to me like if you read here

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.130 
saying to me like if you read here
waiting<00:00:49.230> here<00:00:49.969> let's<00:00:50.969> finish<00:00:51.180> mark<00:00:51.449> it<00:00:51.870> says

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
waiting here let's finish mark it says

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.049 
waiting here let's finish mark it says
this<00:00:52.469> test<00:00:52.739> is<00:00:53.010> too<00:00:53.280> light<00:00:53.460> for<00:00:53.520> your<00:00:53.789> device

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
this test is too light for your device

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.729 
this test is too light for your device
try<00:00:54.390> running<00:00:54.719> extreme<00:00:55.079> and<00:00:55.320> then<00:00:55.410> it<00:00:55.590> says

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
try running extreme and then it says

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.439 
try running extreme and then it says
this<00:00:56.129> test<00:00:56.340> is<00:00:56.460> to<00:00:56.489> light<00:00:56.760> speed<00:00:56.850> wise<00:00:57.180> try

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
this test is to light speed wise try

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.619 
this test is to light speed wise try
running<00:00:57.750> a<00:00:57.809> limited<00:00:58.940> ok<00:00:59.940> I<00:00:59.969> guess<00:01:00.239> actually

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
running a limited ok I guess actually

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.170 
running a limited ok I guess actually
run<00:01:00.780> on<00:01:00.989> them<00:01:01.170> it<00:01:01.320> had<00:01:01.469> ended<00:01:01.680> up<00:01:01.890> data<00:01:02.129> I<00:01:02.370> think

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
run on them it had ended up data I think

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.299 
run on them it had ended up data I think
that<00:01:03.359> is<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.629> morning<00:01:03.989> test<00:01:04.309> competitors

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
that is the morning test competitors

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:11.630 
that is the morning test competitors
other<00:01:05.519> tests<00:01:07.250> me<00:01:08.250> being<00:01:08.460> off<00:01:08.610> this<00:01:08.760> boring<00:01:10.640> he

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
other tests me being off this boring he

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.160 
other tests me being off this boring he
be<00:01:11.790> a<00:01:11.820> slow<00:01:12.180> it's<00:01:12.360> fun<00:01:12.600> I<00:01:13.100> don't<00:01:14.100> know<00:01:14.189> I<00:01:15.170> don't

good score I guess as you can see my

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:34.930 
good score I guess as you can see my
device<00:02:31.489> here<00:02:32.150> is<00:02:32.330> in<00:02:32.870> the<00:02:32.930> top<00:02:33.520> ok<00:02:34.520> send<00:02:34.850> that

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
device here is in the top ok send that
