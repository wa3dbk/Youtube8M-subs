nine gallons a minute it's the same

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.650 
nine gallons a minute it's the same
machine<00:01:50.670> it's<00:01:51.670> just<00:01:51.910> two<00:01:52.090> different<00:01:52.240> lines

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:52.660 
machine it's just two different lines

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:54.060 
machine it's just two different lines
and<00:01:53.020> actually<00:01:53.289> i<00:01:53.320> might<00:01:53.500> switch<00:01:53.800> them<00:01:53.979> over

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070 
and actually i might switch them over
