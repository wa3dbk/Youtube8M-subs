have parabens or anything like that and

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.250 
have parabens or anything like that and
it<00:03:32.129> is<00:03:32.280> the<00:03:32.430> same<00:03:32.819> technology<00:03:33.269> as<00:03:33.750> the<00:03:33.870> regular

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
it is the same technology as the regular

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.500 
it is the same technology as the regular
blue<00:03:34.530> plasma<00:03:34.829> which<00:03:35.519> has<00:03:35.699> the<00:03:35.910> salmon<00:03:36.329> egg

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
blue plasma which has the salmon egg

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.330 
blue plasma which has the salmon egg
enzyme<00:03:37.079> and<00:03:37.319> that's<00:03:37.440> why<00:03:37.590> sometimes<00:03:38.069> with

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
enzyme and that's why sometimes with

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.460 
enzyme and that's why sometimes with
that<00:03:38.489> product<00:03:38.910> you<00:03:39.000> do<00:03:39.269> get<00:03:39.510> a<00:03:39.720> small<00:03:39.900> scent

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
that product you do get a small scent

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.860 
that product you do get a small scent
but<00:03:41.220> like<00:03:41.340> I<00:03:41.370> said<00:03:41.489> with<00:03:41.819> this<00:03:41.970> one<00:03:42.239> you<00:03:42.569> do<00:03:42.750> not

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
but like I said with this one you do not

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.170 
but like I said with this one you do not
so<00:03:43.109> basically<00:03:43.500> what<00:03:43.709> the<00:03:43.829> product<00:03:44.250> does<00:03:44.430> is<00:03:44.790> it

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
so basically what the product does is it

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.270 
so basically what the product does is it
gives<00:03:45.389> you<00:03:45.540> exfoliation<00:03:46.410> without<00:03:46.799> the<00:03:47.010> harsh

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.009 
gives you exfoliation without the harsh
like<00:03:47.579> irritation<00:03:48.269> or<00:03:48.359> redness<00:03:48.750> that<00:03:48.780> you

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:49.019

would<00:03:49.139> get<00:03:49.319> from<00:03:49.530> a<00:03:49.799> typical<00:03:50.120> peel<00:03:51.120> like<00:03:51.389> a

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:51.449 
would get from a typical peel like a

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:54.140 
would get from a typical peel like a
glycolic<00:03:51.930> peel<00:03:52.109> lactic<00:03:53.010> acid<00:03:53.370> peel<00:03:53.549> anything

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 
but without the irritation which I

00:03:58.019 --> 00:03:59.899 
but without the irritation which I
think's<00:03:58.349> great<00:03:58.590> because<00:03:58.859> my<00:03:59.040> skin<00:03:59.370> is<00:03:59.430> highly
