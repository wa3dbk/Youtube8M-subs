it over and over yours running up and
down<00:01:34.460> the<00:01:34.670> scale<00:01:34.909> it's<00:01:35.420> good<00:01:35.750> for<00:01:35.780> you

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 
down the scale it's good for you

something<00:01:37.520> that<00:01:37.670> gets<00:01:37.850> a<00:01:38.000> little<00:01:38.150> more

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
something that gets a little more

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.350 
something that gets a little more
advanced<00:01:38.659> is<00:01:38.870> to<00:01:39.020> alternate<00:01:39.620> every<00:01:40.030> pic<00:01:41.030> it's

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
advanced is to alternate every pic it's

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.899 
advanced is to alternate every pic it's
really<00:01:41.810> hard<00:01:41.990> to<00:01:42.110> do<00:01:42.290> so<00:01:42.890> what<00:01:43.610> I<00:01:43.640> would<00:01:43.790> say

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:43.909 
really hard to do so what I would say

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:45.850 
really hard to do so what I would say
for<00:01:44.060> that<00:01:44.090> is<00:01:44.330> just<00:01:44.570> take<00:01:44.780> one<00:01:45.050> string<00:01:45.530> and

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:45.860 
for that is just take one string and

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.100 
for that is just take one string and
just<00:01:46.610> alternate<00:01:47.090> picking<00:01:47.360> on<00:01:47.600> one<00:01:47.780> string

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.110 
just alternate picking on one string

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:49.540 
just alternate picking on one string
back<00:01:48.380> and<00:01:48.590> forth<00:01:48.800> on<00:01:48.860> two<00:01:49.070> notes<00:01:49.250> of<00:01:49.430> that

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:49.550 
back and forth on two notes of that

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:54.360 
back and forth on two notes of that
scale

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:54.370 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:58.180 

and<00:01:55.480> a<00:01:56.480> point<00:01:56.960> I<00:01:57.020> want<00:01:57.200> to<00:01:57.230> make<00:01:57.290> about<00:01:57.470> that<00:01:57.860> is

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:58.190 
and a point I want to make about that is

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:00.550

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
eventually it becomes so second nature

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.430 
eventually it becomes so second nature
