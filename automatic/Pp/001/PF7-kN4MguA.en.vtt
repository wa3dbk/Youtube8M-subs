00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.450 

I<00:00:00.359> think<00:00:01.319> the<00:00:01.469> only<00:00:01.500> thing<00:00:01.829> that<00:00:02.159> he<00:00:02.280> could

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:02.460 
I think the only thing that he could

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:03.830 
I think the only thing that he could
have<00:00:02.490> been<00:00:02.639> challenging<00:00:03.090> there<00:00:03.270> was<00:00:03.389> Cassidy

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:03.840 
have been challenging there was Cassidy

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.940 
have been challenging there was Cassidy
Lance's<00:00:04.440> last<00:00:04.799> rep<00:00:05.660> was<00:00:06.660> one<00:00:07.319> where<00:00:07.560> she<00:00:07.770> could

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
Lance's last rep was one where she could

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:09.799 
Lance's last rep was one where she could
potentially<00:00:08.639> have<00:00:08.820> been<00:00:09.030> seen<00:00:09.330> to<00:00:09.510> have<00:00:09.540> just

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
potentially have been seen to have just

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:15.079 
potentially have been seen to have just
let<00:00:10.320> it<00:00:10.440> go<00:00:11.660> so<00:00:12.660> this<00:00:13.440> is<00:00:13.469> called<00:00:13.920> the<00:00:13.980> echo<00:00:14.549> the

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
let it go so this is called the echo the

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.099 
let it go so this is called the echo the
fourth<00:00:15.450> race<00:00:15.780> the<00:00:16.410> same<00:00:16.770> as<00:00:17.070> the<00:00:17.279> third<00:00:18.109> and

fourth race the same as the third and

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.519 
fourth race the same as the third and
the<00:00:20.100> athletes<00:00:20.699> go<00:00:21.090> right<00:00:21.359> back<00:00:21.570> at<00:00:21.900> it<00:00:21.930> of
