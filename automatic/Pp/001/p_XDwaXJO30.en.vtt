00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
it's on a slab floor so actually goes

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:58.930 
it's on a slab floor so actually goes
back<00:01:57.710> onto<00:01:57.950> the<00:01:58.130> slab<00:01:58.340> but<00:01:58.610> if<00:01:58.700> it<00:01:58.820> had<00:01:58.910> a

00:01:58.930 --> 00:01:58.940

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:00.520 
back onto the slab but if it had a
basement<00:01:59.210> would<00:01:59.540> probably<00:01:59.930> just<00:02:00.080> go<00:02:00.170> drip

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530
