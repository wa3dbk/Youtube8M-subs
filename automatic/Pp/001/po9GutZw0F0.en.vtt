 hello friends this time but do not 

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:09.490
 we are riding on a motorcycle we are 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:13.419
 mounted on a car and I bring you what 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:16.860
 is the interior of the new mazda3 is that 

00:00:13.419 --> 00:00:19.770
 is already 2015-2016 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:22.170
 Well then, the car that I have 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.260
 they have already given it enough has many 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:29.030
 toys a lot of gadgets so let's go 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:32.509
 look a little hair that they have 

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:35.149
 what this mazda has 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:38.719
 like to do a review of the interior 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:41.570
 of the car then let's turn it on 

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:45.219
 Well, as we already see, it's on 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:50.079
 button then we have it in parking and 

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:50.079
 we only sink what is the button 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:58.840
 and that's where we have all of us 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:02.680
 entertainment system the screen 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:05.140
 is that the mazda3 grand touring if we see 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:08.380
 the screen is very different from what it is 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:11.220
 the prime and what is the touring here 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:14.770
 shows then we have the changes we have 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:17.229
 several tweets we have two we have what 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:20.680
 it's the revolutions panel 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:23.990
 a speed panel but also 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:28.329
 we have a display here we see it 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.329
 which also shows us the speed 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:33.950
 in the car we have what we 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:36.770
 is the control for music control 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:39.650
 for the volume this would be for the 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.840
 information I show you we see there 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:44.509
 where it says rank 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.579
 like up the average speed 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:48.330
 that I drive constantly because I'm in 

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:51.200
 a city 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:54.229
 what we spend 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.450
 and every 10 seconds I think a bit more 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:58.189
 little less is the spending of 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.460
 gasoline I think it's less every second 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:01.500
 two 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.390
 I do not remember well 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.880
 the expense 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:09.030
 current then finish tanking and upload 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:12.000
 a hill but normally it is not 16.7 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.709
 liters is a little cheaper and 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.440
 I'm going to show how much the 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:18.360
 car in gasoline expense then 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.640
 we have these buttons down here too 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.800
 we have the system to answer for 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:26.000
 the calls by bluetooth in the other 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.000
 side we have the system 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:32.860
 I was the popcorn the system for the 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:36.330
 cruising speed of all these buttons 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:38.340
 we handle it and we passed here 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.260
 The air conditioning system is 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:43.260
 automatic air conditioning this is the 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:46.470
 convert the grand touring we have 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:48.720
 because to learn it, I just need to see it 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.500
 here and there the air went on let's finish 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:54.930
 you are automatic and I have it at 18 degrees 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.190
 25 or if I already have it heating and 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.740
 here 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:01.890
 where do I want the air to go 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:03.300
 six - speed automatic 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:06.560
 you can also handle it is sequential 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.560
 Yes, we have it 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:14.270
 Allende management and management here with 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:17.030
 the lever up or down or 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:20.530
 I can also handle it by means of 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.530
 the cams we have on the steering wheel 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.580
 and we see them 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:28.910
 again 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:31.580
 and a parking lot here we have to handle the 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:34.430
 entertainment system 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:35.990
 are several buttons on the way to a 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:38.870
 side to the other we can also 

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:42.920
 sink like this one or we can move it 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:44.210
 a kind of lever a joystick and 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.460
 we have here the system 

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:48.050
 entertainment was then how they 

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:50.090
 I said let's see a little what is the 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:52.640
 I consume all the applications that it has 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:54.680
 and we start here in applications 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:58.129
 fuel savings 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:01.700
 we look then just finish tanking but 

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:04.580
 if we look at his history 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:07.970
 of the fuel more or less is a car 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:11.780
 that in city is giving me about 8.5 

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:14.940
 liters per 100 kilometers 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:16.650
 and we give back 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.370
 we also have what is the 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:20.380
 maintenance 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:21.790
 it tells us when our 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:25.190
 maintenance the rotation of 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:29.000
 tires the oil change 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:31.690
 here we have it oil change when 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.690
 It is scheduled 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:37.939
 a warning guide that there is not 

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:39.319
 no warning at that moment he 

00:04:37.939 --> 00:04:42.050
 will give the warning when we get 

00:04:39.319 --> 00:04:46.840
 practically almost at 5000 km and I 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:50.590
 a key will appear on the tachometer 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:53.070
 in entertainment we have the radio what 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:53.070
 I had it off 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:05:00.390

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:00.390
 also the bluetooth usb 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:03.500
 we are going to return 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:07.280
 let's go home 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:10.250
 the communication that are our 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:12.470
 contacts then when we do it 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:14.720
 mating with our cell phone the 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:16.430
 browsing the maps at that time 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:18.949
 I'm in an organization I do not have 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:22.129

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:24.830
 here in colombia is not that they are very very 

00:05:22.129 --> 00:05:27.020
 good this system works but it is not so 

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:29.360
 good as others and we have in 

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:32.419

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:53.909

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:06.020
 vehicle 

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:08.720
 and a series of systems 

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:10.599
 if we look then everything we have in 

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:13.599
 if this is a little inside the 

00:06:10.599 --> 00:06:13.599
 mazda3 

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:18.990
 cojinería in leather more than everything was going 

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:22.190
 to show what was the tachometer 

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:22.190
 entertainment system 

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:30.250
 let's open here between a bit of 

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:30.250
 illumination 

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:37.100

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:40.660
 here also a little button that we can 

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:40.660

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:52.260
 videos at that time and do it a little 

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:53.910
 of what was the interior of this mazda 

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:55.680
 that does not mean he does not come back with 

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:57.330
 my other videos will be riding 

00:06:55.680 --> 00:07:00.030
 I have not been able to ride because 

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:02.480
 I have to make some changes in the 

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:04.920
 motorcycle I'm without the rear tire 

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:09.890
