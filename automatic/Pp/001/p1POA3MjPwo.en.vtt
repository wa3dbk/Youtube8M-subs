00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
exactly how to do each exercise so

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.360 
exactly how to do each exercise so

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
you put yourself inside a system that

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.020 
you put yourself inside a system that
works<00:02:47.850> for<00:02:48.630> you<00:02:48.930> and<00:02:49.160> sends<00:02:50.160> you<00:02:50.340> a<00:02:50.550> new

program<00:02:51.630> every<00:02:52.380> month<00:02:52.620> as<00:02:52.770> I<00:02:53.640> told<00:02:53.910> you<00:02:54.090> this

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 
program every month as I told you this

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.170 
program every month as I told you this
is<00:02:54.450> what<00:02:54.660> I<00:02:54.690> think<00:02:55.200> is<00:02:55.950> the<00:02:56.310> best<00:02:56.610> part<00:02:56.970> of<00:02:57.030> this

is what I think is the best part of this

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.090 
is what I think is the best part of this
program<00:02:57.450> is<00:02:57.780> you'll<00:02:58.470> get<00:02:58.650> a<00:02:58.680> different

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
program is you'll get a different

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.510 
program is you'll get a different
workout<00:03:00.110> that's<00:03:01.110> that<00:03:01.680> helps<00:03:02.010> you<00:03:02.130> progress

month you get the workout video and then

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.040 
month you get the workout video and then
you<00:03:14.520> can<00:03:14.700> just<00:03:14.910> go<00:03:15.150> ahead<00:03:15.270> and<00:03:15.420> do<00:03:15.690> it<00:03:15.870> it's

simple so that's the best part one thing
i<00:03:21.390> don't<00:03:21.450> like<00:03:21.750> about<00:03:21.989> this<00:03:22.470> program<00:03:22.739> is

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
i don't like about this program is

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:26.030 
i don't like about this program is

when Vince explains you why he thinks

when Vince explains you why he thinks
the<00:03:30.209> workouts<00:03:30.690> work<00:03:31.110> I<00:03:31.350> think<00:03:31.890> sometimes<00:03:32.160> he's

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
the workouts work I think sometimes he's

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.449 
the workouts work I think sometimes he's
a<00:03:32.820> low<00:03:33.150> off<00:03:33.420> the<00:03:33.480> mark<00:03:34.110> I've<00:03:34.380> got<00:03:34.890> a<00:03:34.920> degree<00:03:35.190> in

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
a low off the mark I've got a degree in

a low off the mark I've got a degree in
exercise<00:03:35.610> sciences<00:03:36.510> Vince<00:03:37.110> says<00:03:37.410> he's<00:03:37.709> got

exercise sciences Vince says he's got

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.130 
exercise sciences Vince says he's got
one<00:03:38.160> too<00:03:38.430> but<00:03:38.910> some<00:03:39.150> of<00:03:39.269> the<00:03:39.360> things<00:03:39.630> he<00:03:39.840> says

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
one too but some of the things he says

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.039 
one too but some of the things he says
I've<00:03:40.410> never<00:03:40.680> heard<00:03:40.980> of<00:03:41.190> or<00:03:41.459> I<00:03:42.150> know<00:03:42.480> are

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:43.049 
I've never heard of or I know are

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:45.140 
I've never heard of or I know are
controversial<00:03:43.709> within<00:03:44.280> the<00:03:44.640> exercise

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
controversial within the exercise

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.240 
controversial within the exercise
sciences<00:03:45.630> community<00:03:46.230> but<00:03:46.650> he<00:03:46.769> talks<00:03:47.070> about

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
sciences community but he talks about

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.240 
sciences community but he talks about
them<00:03:47.640> like<00:03:47.850> they<00:03:48.000> are<00:03:48.120> facts<00:03:48.540> and<00:03:48.930> like<00:03:49.769> this

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
them like they are facts and like this

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.120 
them like they are facts and like this
is<00:03:50.459> the<00:03:50.640> way<00:03:50.820> it<00:03:50.880> works<00:03:51.290> so<00:03:52.290> I<00:03:52.709> think<00:03:52.769> he

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
is the way it works so I think he

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.820 
is the way it works so I think he
sometimes<00:03:53.670> a<00:03:53.850> little<00:03:54.000> off<00:03:54.209> the<00:03:54.420> mark<00:03:54.450> but<00:03:54.930> that

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830 
sometimes a little off the mark but that

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:58.610 
sometimes a little off the mark but that
may<00:03:56.130> not<00:03:56.160> be<00:03:56.700> that<00:03:56.970> much<00:03:57.330> of<00:03:57.390> a<00:03:57.690> problem<00:03:57.720> for

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
may not be that much of a problem for

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.310 
may not be that much of a problem for
you<00:03:58.799> if<00:03:58.950> what<00:03:59.549> you<00:03:59.730> want<00:03:59.760> is<00:04:00.209> to<00:04:00.870> build<00:04:01.080> muscle

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:01.320 
you if what you want is to build muscle

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:04.640 
you if what you want is to build muscle
and<00:04:01.769> workouts<00:04:02.280> that<00:04:02.580> work<00:04:02.940> because<00:04:03.750> frankly

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
and workouts that work because frankly

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:07.400 
and workouts that work because frankly
if<00:04:04.920> the<00:04:05.370> workhouse<00:04:05.790> work<00:04:06.239> and<00:04:06.540> I<00:04:06.959> think<00:04:07.260> they

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
if the workhouse work and I think they

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:10.340 
if the workhouse work and I think they
will<00:04:07.790> do<00:04:08.790> you<00:04:08.910> really<00:04:09.209> need<00:04:09.390> to<00:04:09.420> know<00:04:09.720> why<00:04:09.989> I

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:10.350 
will do you really need to know why I

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:12.830 
will do you really need to know why I
like<00:04:11.280> to<00:04:11.430> know<00:04:11.489> why<00:04:11.790> because<00:04:12.000> I've<00:04:12.269> studied<00:04:12.570> in
