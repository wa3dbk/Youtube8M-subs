00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.190
 however, looks too late but why 6 

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:06.140
 at the request of some 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:09.140
 I do not come anymore one believes black 

00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:11.859
 let's see Milan 

00:00:11.859 --> 00:00:13.210
 Order 

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:14.830
 the later grows 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:17.810
 starts with the at stake between 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:20.329
 the first FC Cologne and 11 

00:00:20.329 --> 00:00:23.329
 TSG Hoffenheim 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:26.460
 because it stands 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.460
 daily to a single 

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:37.809
 the next meeting 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:39.110
 is between 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:40.239
 near Munich 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:41.660
 and 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:43.010
 Mainz 05 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.210
 and most are for the first time a leader at all 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.360
 in the first league and 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.360
 now you have as an opponent the excavator 

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:55.660
 Isa shook 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:56.590
 the belly 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:58.320
 draw 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.320
 on 1 2 to 2 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:08.950
 since the Bayern 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.160
 last matchday we proved that you bavaria-dusel 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.440
 to the corner 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:15.790
 the next meeting 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:16.690
 also a 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.690
 back Coma namely the success of Schalke 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.670
 then between FC Schalke 04 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.360
 Borussia Monchengladbach 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.030
 and 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.590
 Bernstein analyst on this 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.030
 are back on the road to success 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.030
 Also every day that will win this game 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.640
 this time 13 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.820
 the next meeting is between 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.090
 info on b had been held 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:54.550
 Bayer Leverkusen 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:57.070
 and the games were 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:00.070
 until the end an ICICI not exciting 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:01.780
 and this soon 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.190
 she will probably 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:05.009
 also very exciting though 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.680
 Century resisted 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.680
 come out 

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:19.159
 the next meeting is between 

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:20.529
 Eintracht Frankfurt 

00:02:20.529 --> 00:02:23.819
 and give the first FC Nuremberg 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:27.290
 and the citizens have proven that they can win 

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:33.689
 but we also impressively with unity scarce victory 

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:38.439
 at persistently good game &amp; Cie 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:41.189
 the winning streak continues 

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:42.469
 with a 

00:02:42.469 --> 00:02:45.469
 1 to 3 1 win 

00:02:50.469 --> 00:02:53.699
 the next encounter he is between Web FC Sao Paulo per pound 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:56.719
 Borussia Dortmund 

00:02:56.719 --> 00:02:59.429
 and the Dortmunder have 

00:02:59.429 --> 00:03:01.409
 the Schalke first 

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:04.779
 held onto the set could have won very high 

00:03:04.779 --> 00:03:08.729
 and Dengel that Lautern would have won but still win more 

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:10.479
 can 

00:03:10.479 --> 00:03:14.599
 Daum I guess that percent also remains with the Hubble remains so 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:18.459
 Sam Pauli loses the match at one in four 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:28.549
 the next match is between Werder Bremen and HSV 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:31.549
 the top match of this game day won 6 

00:03:32.469 --> 00:03:35.829
 It may not be from the table situation 

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:36.750
 but 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.299
 it is the top match 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:41.569
 and this encounter was in a song 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:44.199
 five times 

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:46.259
 There were cups once 

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:48.299
 twice Murray forgave 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:51.299
 who money 

00:03:52.509 --> 00:03:55.759
 to write a comment maybe I'm just not sure 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:59.149
 we are 

00:03:59.149 --> 00:04:01.859
 Although empty 

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:06.709
 and there the Bremen rafters have won as the HSV but I think anyway 

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:09.919
 that this encounter 

00:04:09.919 --> 00:04:11.649
 A draw goes 

00:04:11.649 --> 00:04:13.589
 whether one on one and on one 

00:04:13.589 --> 00:04:16.589
 very close to the 1 1 

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:21.620
 because I think that 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.430
 both try to somehow make the second goal but not 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.529
 creates 

00:04:26.529 --> 00:04:29.309
 now to the special encounters 

00:04:29.309 --> 00:04:32.259
 the representation 

00:04:32.259 --> 00:04:34.250
 the VfL Wolfsburg 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:36.159
 while SC Freiburg 

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:37.620
 and boss gets 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:40.319
 finally back in the track 

00:04:40.319 --> 00:04:42.189
 I'm finally leaving 

00:04:42.189 --> 00:04:44.699
 and the Sisi series continues 

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:47.699
 3 0 victory 

00:04:55.749 --> 00:04:58.039
 the next meeting 

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:00.189
 between 

00:05:00.189 --> 00:05:02.529
 Kaiserslautern 

00:05:02.529 --> 00:05:05.240
 Hannover 96 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:06.479
 and 

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:08.900
 Hanover actually had 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:11.879
 well played 

00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:14.969
 against Bremen and 

00:05:14.969 --> 00:05:17.969
 Lautern bad against Dortmund 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:22.470
 That's why I think that Hannover 

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:25.039
 definitely wins 

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:26.449
 three goals 

00:05:26.449 --> 00:05:27.599
 but 

00:05:27.599 --> 00:05:30.300
 according to the city also a gate 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:33.300
 one to three 

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:42.199
 These were my tips for late night sex 

00:05:43.789 --> 00:05:45.610
 if any 

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:47.740
 has detected small errors 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:49.210
 then you are good 

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:51.789
 if not then 

00:05:51.789 --> 00:05:54.869
 maybe not good depending 

00:05:54.869 --> 00:05:58.189
 I hope you enjoyed it and we'll take a look 

00:05:58.189 --> 00:05:59.199
 seventh later again
