00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.760
 or the beast that happens is that it is a zebra 

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:12.650
 if an animal that lives in Africa that does not 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.650
 he is a horse in prison 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:20.029
 mmm is daily let's explain why 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.029
 they have stripes the zebras 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.260
 a recent study from the university of 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.670
 california has shown that the stripes 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.560
 of certain equipment such as zebras 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.930
 They serve not bite them both 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.240
 the flies with what there is and that also 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.430
 I'm going to paint makes some black stripes and 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.970
 white the roads that in summer I 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.970
 eat me going 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.700
 and avoid the bites of the flies not 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:53.050
 is the only function that the stripes have 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.970
 of the zebras also serve as 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.310
 camouflage of these wild donkeys 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:59.560
 Africans also avoids the heat 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:06.210
 excessive serves as a social link 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:06.210
 to relate and to relate 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:16.610
 and avoid the attack of predators 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:16.610
 with their stripes they leave them knocked out 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:22.820
 to this end before itself but I think of the 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:25.130
 flies is also very important because 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.170
 these scientists checked the 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.880
 length of the stripes with the zones in 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.530
 the ones that had more flies and where 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.560
 larger stripes were was because there was 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:35.510
 more flies well I do not know that will be also 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.490
 the flies and everything if you would like 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:39.200
 have stripes like zebras or where 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.740
 crossed whatever you tell us what 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.830

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:49.070

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:52.490
