00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:10.520
 Welcome to the live 

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:11.900
 Here I bring you another tutorial and I think that 

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:13.910
 This tutorial is going to like you a lot 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.770
 because we are going to manufacture a catapult 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.660
 human a catapult that will launch us 

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:19.880
 through the air and what we are going to need 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.410
 to build it is what you see in the 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.480
 utensil bars now I will give you a 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.460
 couple of tips in addition but first thing 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.929
 what I wanted to see is how to build it worth 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.109
 so we're going to do to do 

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:31.849
 a structure of 5 x 5 of wood without 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:34.460
 try it right now I'll explain why 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:36.230
 of this material and all this goes well 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.750
 how good I do the structure will be a 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:41.059
 species of 5 x 5 box I remember you 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.160
 is worth the floor of the structure also 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:45.260
 we have to remove it ok we're going to 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:48.680
 remove it and we will also fill it 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:50.629
 with untreated wood, you can see how 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.579
 I'm removing it and I'm putting the wood 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:54.440
 at the moment it is quite easy to 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:55.820
 build good all the catapult itself 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.859
 it's pretty easy to build and now 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.809
 you will see the result is amazing and good 

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:01.399
 the next step is in the middle of the 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:04.850
 structure let's put two blocks already 

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:06.590
 remove the bottom one, there we have it and 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.690
 in one of the laterals that we 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.610
 we want to make a structure of 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:12.049
 three blocks up it's worth not what 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.920
 you are going to see there has to be very 

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:15.869
 pegadito to the structure 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.520
 in the last block of that structure 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.520
 little girl that we have done we are going to put 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.560
 a button on the edge part of the 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.020
 structure we are going to fill everything 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.430
 with red stone is worth as you see there 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.130
 you see it 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.350
 and practically there would be only the 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.390
 last step is to take a bucket of water 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.490
 in the downtown area of the structure and 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.460
 would be finished is worth now my 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:41.700
 recommendations to use it is worth what 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.380
 first I would recommend you to do it 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.940
 untreated wood because otherwise 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.190
 it works the same, let's say 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.740
 works better with untreated wood 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.270
 so I would recommend that with the 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.220
 wood without treating better then 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.720
 I would recommend doing it in a place that 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.960
 be close to the water to be able 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:00.869
 land because you'll see how we fly 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:03.270
 and I would also recommend you to make a 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.190
 quite powerful armor because the tnt 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.660
 It hurts us, it's worth 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:08.580
 I would recommend that you be at peace for 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:10.259
 do not kill us that is interesting 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.320
 good that we have to do fill 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:16.190
 all sides of tnt and just 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:18.930
 we have to use the button also 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:21.180
 if we are jumping at the moment 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.730
 we are using the catapult will launch us 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.709
 even further it's worth it so as you see 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.300
 look how he has thrown me in the air by 

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:29.190
 I tell you that it is quite important 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:32.160
 do it from a site in a very site 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:34.380
 close to the water is worth so good as 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.140
 I say I recommend you to be jumping in 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:39.420
 the moment the tnt is going to burst there 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.790
 Sometimes that maybe failure is the jump 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.560
 how are you going to see now that in a failure to 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.700
 sometimes it fails is the jump and it does not throw us 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.410
 so far but 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.390
 as you have seen in that first 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:51.239
 example and in this second he sends us very 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.769
 very very far away and good as you see the 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:54.599
 fall is awesome that's why I say 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:55.560
 that you be careful and put it close 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:58.349
 of water to be able to land 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.120
 quietly it's worth no it's not a tutorial 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:02.069
 very useful is more for fun 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.290
 it's a human catapult maybe we 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:06.060
 it could serve to get on top of 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.099
 structures maybe to the roof of a 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:11.010
 building or something like that but good 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:12.690
 it's a little more for fun I hope that 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.489
 just like it and good as you see 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.709
 this last example of the jump catches me 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:18.360
 a little bit wrong and I do not go so much flying 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:21.390
 but good as I say trying testing 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:23.069
 it's quite fun and good the truth 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:24.750
 is that we can not have a good time 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:26.610
 so well I hope this tutorial 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.110
 you have liked to simply share 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:30.569
 this video with your friends so that 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:32.400
 see the human catapult and just 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:34.319
 to like you if you liked it and yours for more 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:38.599
 videos you know and nothing soon see you 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:38.599
 in new videos a greeting and see you later
