 agadir 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:12.470
 room they live together with a small 

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:14.450
 role then makeup or care and has 

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:16.609
 adjudged 6 kg because too much with the huge 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:18.140
 promotion with you have already thought 

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:19.820
 on my twitter my instagram and I 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.259
 started without further ado then that 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.429
 I do not talk about it anymore because I think 

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:23.990
 that after a while you have 4 

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:25.640
 always the ja shower videos that are 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.980
 in promo and there I wanted to test some 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.650
 thing of these funny to know romania 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.239
 12 of Polynesia of two that's 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:34.489
 nothing exceptional but a left 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:36.289
 old fashioned caramel cream 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:37.730
 so that we saw it will be pretty cool and 

00:00:36.289 --> 00:00:39.859
 for once, there were huge sums 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.620
 on the los having bought a offered well 

00:00:39.859 --> 00:00:44.629
 often so that's the small 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.680
 parenthesis and I took a lot of those 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:46.519
 from michael that I really wanted 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.660
 for a long time 

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:48.859
 I like to tell the story 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.289
 I went to carrefour market 

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:53.390
 I had bought a foundation that 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:54.920
 jérémy sorbon instagram who was 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.960
 besides much more expensive than at 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.179
 normal crossroads at 4 euros more I 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.620
 believe is one of my subscribers that I you 

00:00:59.179 --> 00:01:03.019
 thanks and one of the people who me 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.519
 follows on instagram told me that it would be 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:06.620
 promo at carrefour and as I do not 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:08.030
 never look at small promotions 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:10.189
 forward-looking light game directly I 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:13.220
 I had not seen it for once I took 

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:15.049
 thanks to her I thank her it's me nw 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.509
 has a number behind that I would write 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:19.430
 if sibling simon and thanks to him I could 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:21.770
 buy a thing so initially I had 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:24.799
 bought a heat film 1 315 I change them 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.090
 meanwhile because I 'm saying hey he 

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:27.920
 suited me when I had a little 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:31.310
 little tried in store at monop 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.630
 but I will quickly fall back or rather 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.219
 I will quickly find winter morning 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.229
 for once I had the 250 golden beige 

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:38.030
 who will be more this winter morning and who will me 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:40.009
 will fit more it's a foundation 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.320
 I will try very well in a video 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:43.820
 with of course the result a thread of 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.040
 the day you'll see that soon 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.570
 soy thinks how I wear it 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.009
 how I used it especially 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.289
 different uses I think it 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:53.240
 may not be bad at all 

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:55.610
 to follow and I can not wait to 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.990
 test at the price level it was at 7 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.340
 euros instead of 10 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.399
 I think it was a great deal 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.780
 I was even tempted to test 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:04.880
 polishes darker to try 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.530
 account in the ring if they really excel 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.119
 I may take a little background 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.190
 it's just to make my outline 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:13.040
 and to actually mix everything without 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.780
 to have to pass necessarily tea on 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.080
 powder I think it can be great 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.030
 well 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.709
 Anyway I tried it here 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.349
 as quickly as possible because the promotion is 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:24.800
 ends on Wednesday and we are already the 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:26.120
 19 so 20 21 22 23 Wednesday 23 the 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.410
 promotion will not be there anymore you can 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.780
 so find at 7 euros at carrefour 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.739
 where the two 10th it is still 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.750
 much cheaper than elsewhere a 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:33.890
 crossroads I advise you to watch 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.660
 there is also a complexion I had background 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.819
 too big to itc you will also see 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.640
 in a video as I wanted to said 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:43.190
 demonstration which is the magical place of 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:47.180
 at l'oréal lot of complexion then this one 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:50.140
 he was paid back a deferred on your 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:52.880
 map crossroads so it was 12 euros 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:55.220
 that you pay cash and 6 euros on your 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.660
 card so it costs you 6 euros this 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.269
 who is really really cool 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:01.160
 knowing that I was ready to take 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:02.390
 I really really wanted to 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.459
 test Villejoie and strings 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:05.720
 american and I recently saw the look 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:07.160
 did a video on it and who 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.540
 compare with a big foundation if 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.440
 you have not seen it go see I had 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.570
 his chain in the see the information 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.340
 because it's a foundation I had 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:15.260
 but just too fast and it intrigues me and 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.269
 role for this purpose in both shades ref 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.350
 him who turns into powder finally good 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:19.700
 I thought it was absolutely necessary 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:20.959
 that I try small parentheses 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.070
 for all those who are interested 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:23.870
 it's foundation are no 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:26.450
 comedogenic finds that it's still 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:29.480
 important when one is a little bit 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:31.700
 almost daily fight against 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.019
 acne against blemishes and 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.910
 when I mean also is that 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:36.410
 the coup income to 6 euros worth 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:39.079
 really good if you have the time 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:40.880
 had made a small jump to the level 

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:42.889
 of the product for the eyes I just took 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:45.500
 little tricks because I'm in 

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:47.569
 I harbor a vague project there is 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.010
 no longer he dried especially so 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:50.540
 I took over the lasting drama which has 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:52.760
 totally dry but 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:55.250
 totally but it was limited to the end 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:57.290
 so it's not that bad 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.510
 had a welcome to redeem at nab 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:03.290
 offered and suddenly the nana delay that 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:07.310
 I took this one is master 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:10.400
 plus size of chennai bling it's a 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:12.469
 small eyeliner felt very practical to 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.150
 daily and otherwise ben me I'm 

00:04:12.469 --> 00:04:18.199
 an unconditional gel liner as much 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:20.180
 mucous membranes that at the level of the eyeliner I 

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:21.440
 think it can be great shot and 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.970
 for once I have taken it made me 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:25.729
 4 euros and 4 euros 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:26.870
 it's really new always 

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:28.370
 for the eyes I forgot about you 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:30.050
 introduce the big high tech and maybelline 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:31.370
 who is this new mascara that I took 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.509
 besides on sale at hyper u which is 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:34.639
 also on sale at carrefour 

00:04:32.509 --> 00:04:36.259
 can find about 7 euros in this 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:37.639
 moment anyway and I will test it 

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:38.060
 very soon in a first 

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:39.470
 impression 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:42.110
 so I was suffering from a dry shampoo 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:45.139
 since it was on promotion it's the 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:46.370
 curious volume from john frieda you 

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:47.660
 that it is necessarily frida products 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:48.759
 because it's products that we 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:51.229
 spoke a lot a few years ago 

00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:53.780
 they released a lot of news 

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:54.889
 textures of new stuff and I admit 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:57.440
 that I wanted to test me this 

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:59.180
 dry shampoo since well ben I have some 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:00.199
 roots that tend to regret 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:00.740
 it's a little faster than 

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:02.630
 usually 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:03.949
 as I made lashes it goes 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:06.729
 much better on that side my hair 

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:08.870
 are almost normal not yet named 

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:10.699
 but without a tendency yet addressed a 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:12.199
 little bit fast so I took this 

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:13.400
 mist and I also took the shampoo 

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:17.120
 volume that is in the bathroom 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:19.070
 I will test for even very soon I 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.849
 think I only took about three euros 

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:21.530
 I think it's a good deal 

00:05:19.849 --> 00:05:23.720
 knowing that there is bound to be a day 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:25.190
 have sebum that is secreted in excess 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:26.810
 when he had a little stress shot 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:28.250
 it happens to me quite often 

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:30.409
 I think it can be really not 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:31.820
 badly then there I found a product that 

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:33.139
 I had seen his guiraud club chain that 

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:34.070
 I wanted to test too much when 

00:05:33.139 --> 00:05:35.420
 I was told at the well 

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:37.300
 said that if there was something to test 

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:39.470
 in the range that was it's the serum 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:41.510
 correctors compared done at l'oréal 

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:43.070
 in the range south i missed on the radio 

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:44.810
 this range she said adie 

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:45.320
 to shoot almadies no did not tell me 

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:47.810
 directly 

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:49.580
 she said it was really the serum 

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:52.100
 who were aiming for a super skin even 

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:53.870
 when it was a poor naked bottomless 

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:55.550
 it's still a little complexion 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:56.240
 difference at the level both cases and that 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:59.780
 I really like that 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:00.320
 so we will test I think very very 

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:01.640
 very soon 

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:02.690
 I think it's good because he 

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:04.630
 are a lot of women that I tested at 

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:07.550
 drugstore level at 

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:09.230
 cosmetology as a rule of 

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:11.030
 really really expensive products they got me 

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:12.320
 not necessarily satisfied and each time 

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:14.780
 that I come back to creams home 

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:16.340
 l'oréal I'm really happy and I 

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:17.810
 finds that there are ten innovations not bad 

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:19.730
 at all textures that I like 

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:20.930
 products that I like and we take 

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:22.130
 facial I find they are 

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:23.870
 really good I thought that 

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:24.950
 I had to test it and 

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:26.960
 last thing I wanted to try 

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:29.060
 it is a dry oil of gp racer butter 

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:30.650
 of cocoa that is supposed to be against 

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:32.000
 scars stretch marks dry skin and 

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:34.220
 damaged by the way it is aging 

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.080
 cutaneous that beautiful promises but I saw 

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:37.340
 advertising that made me want to actually 

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:39.290
 to try because I told myself that 

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:41.330
 if it did not fit his face it would go 

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:43.100
 on my body level stretch marks and 

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:44.150
 that it would be necessarily not bad at all 

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:45.590
 I do not know if I will use it 

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:47.780
 mainly on the court on the 

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:48.950
 face but to have tested my serum and 

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:51.740
 I think it's really good 

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:52.250
 maybe for the evening in repair that 

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:53.840
 can be cool 

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:55.490
 needles that comes with a 

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:57.230
 little pump bottle that's really 

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:59.720
 very practical since it is the novelty 

00:06:57.230 --> 00:07:01.010
 of this famous I like a lot like the 

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:02.840
 know because I had already tried to 

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:03.620
 stretch marks and that was frankly 

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:05.060
 not bad 

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:06.650
 of course it does not disappear 

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:08.480
 but one has the impression fades a little 

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:10.070
 little week this is almost normal 

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:12.230
 even if it brings more hydration in 

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:14.030
 done and I think it's really 

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:16.040
 really cool to try a product like 

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:17.660
 that can be precisely because 

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:19.460
 that these faces and body I do not know that 

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:21.050
 I liked it I have not tested yet I you 

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:22.610
 will talk about it soon the normal senate price 

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:24.440
 forgan clues i got to 8 

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:25.730
 there are 150 milliliters it is used in 

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:26.870
 really long so I think that's 

00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:28.630
 can be a good investment 

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:30.490
 so here I am you have 

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:32.290
 my little bowl but a product is and 

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:33.430
 cetera knowing that I am too happy 

00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:35.170
 to have proven it's your business 

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:36.340
 but either this little flight will have you 

00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:37.540
 more than you will have time to do 

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:39.310
 a few small things if you in 

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:40.690
 have the opportunity I make you 

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:43.030
 big kisses and I mean very very 

00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:44.950
 quickly to test all these products very 

00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:46.210
 soon live in the waters I'm doing 

00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:48.480
 standards still aim for a page ya 

00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:48.480
 too fast
