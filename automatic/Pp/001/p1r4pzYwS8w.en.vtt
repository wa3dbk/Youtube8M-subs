that occur with these clutches but first
let's<00:00:36.120> review<00:00:36.329> how<00:00:36.809> these<00:00:37.079> pull<00:00:37.410> type

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
let's review how these pull type

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.830 
let's review how these pull type
clutches<00:00:38.010> work<00:00:38.300> when<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.390> release<00:00:39.629> bearing

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
clutches work when the release bearing

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.270 
clutches work when the release bearing
is<00:00:40.050> installed<00:00:40.410> into<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:40.739> pressure<00:00:40.980> plate

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
is installed into the pressure plate

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.380 
is installed into the pressure plate
snaps<00:00:42.030> into<00:00:42.239> place<00:00:42.390> and<00:00:43.550> the<00:00:44.550> wire<00:00:44.820> ring<00:00:45.120> here

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
snaps into place and the wire ring here

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.380 
snaps into place and the wire ring here
is<00:00:45.690> captured<00:00:46.110> by<00:00:46.320> this<00:00:47.190> lever<00:00:47.940> plate<00:00:48.239> and<00:00:49.280> then

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.390 
is captured by this lever plate and then

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.729 
is captured by this lever plate and then
now<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.449> release<00:00:51.809> spring<00:00:52.050> is<00:00:52.199> able<00:00:52.410> to<00:00:52.500> pull

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
now the release spring is able to pull

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.400 
now the release spring is able to pull
on<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.039> clutch<00:00:53.539> so<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.660> key<00:00:54.809> component<00:00:55.379> to

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
on the clutch so the key component to

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.500 
on the clutch so the key component to
the<00:00:55.530> stock<00:00:55.829> design<00:00:56.039> is<00:00:56.489> this<00:00:56.820> fragile<00:00:57.059> wire

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
the stock design is this fragile wire
