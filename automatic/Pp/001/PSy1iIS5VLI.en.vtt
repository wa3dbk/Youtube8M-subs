00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:11.230 
after I prime my face I am taking a

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:13.140 
after I prime my face I am taking a
shade<00:00:11.650> of<00:00:11.769> foundation<00:00:11.799> that<00:00:12.309> is<00:00:12.549> darker<00:00:12.969> than

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:13.150 
shade of foundation that is darker than

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:15.480 
shade of foundation that is darker than
my<00:00:13.299> skin<00:00:13.330> and<00:00:14.139> I<00:00:14.230> apply<00:00:14.469> this<00:00:14.529> to<00:00:14.740> the<00:00:14.949> outside

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:15.490 
my skin and I apply this to the outside

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:17.760 
my skin and I apply this to the outside
perimeter<00:00:15.759> of<00:00:16.150> my<00:00:16.480> face<00:00:16.720> and<00:00:16.960> I<00:00:17.380> bring<00:00:17.619> that

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:17.770 
perimeter of my face and I bring that

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:20.100 
perimeter of my face and I bring that
down<00:00:17.829> my<00:00:18.220> neck<00:00:18.460> the<00:00:19.090> reason<00:00:19.449> I<00:00:19.539> am<00:00:19.660> applying<00:00:19.869> a

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:20.110 
down my neck the reason I am applying a

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:22.019 
down my neck the reason I am applying a
foundation<00:00:20.289> that<00:00:20.800> is<00:00:20.919> darker<00:00:21.340> is<00:00:21.489> to<00:00:21.699> create<00:00:22.000> a

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:22.029 
foundation that is darker is to create a

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:23.849 
foundation that is darker is to create a
better<00:00:22.390> contrast<00:00:22.960> with<00:00:23.199> the<00:00:23.320> white<00:00:23.529> of<00:00:23.739> the

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:23.859 
better contrast with the white of the

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:28.889 
better contrast with the white of the
mask<00:00:24.099> that<00:00:24.369> I'm<00:00:24.520> going<00:00:24.759> to<00:00:24.879> be<00:00:25.000> drawing<00:00:25.239> I<00:00:27.899> then

00:00:28.889 --> 00:00:28.899 
mask that I'm going to be drawing I then

00:00:28.899 --> 00:00:30.749 
mask that I'm going to be drawing I then
draw<00:00:29.140> an<00:00:29.290> outline<00:00:29.469> of<00:00:29.739> a<00:00:29.950> heart<00:00:30.219> with<00:00:30.460> white

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:30.759

facepaint
I<00:00:31.660> do<00:00:32.259> realize<00:00:32.680> that<00:00:32.710> in<00:00:33.039> Rocky<00:00:33.399> Horror<00:00:33.640> they

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:34.090 
I do realize that in Rocky Horror they

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:36.180 
I do realize that in Rocky Horror they
actually<00:00:34.539> don't<00:00:34.750> have<00:00:35.050> heart-shaped<00:00:35.710> masks

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:36.190 
actually don't have heart-shaped masks

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.459 
actually don't have heart-shaped masks
but<00:00:36.730> that<00:00:36.879> is<00:00:37.030> why<00:00:37.210> this<00:00:37.270> is<00:00:37.449> an<00:00:37.660> inspired<00:00:38.140> look

00:00:38.459 --> 00:00:38.469 
but that is why this is an inspired look

00:00:38.469 --> 00:01:16.330 
but that is why this is an inspired look
rather<00:00:38.800> than<00:00:39.129> a<00:00:39.160> direct<00:00:39.399> interpretation

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.980 

after<00:01:17.340> I<00:01:17.369> color<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:17.970> mosque<00:01:18.210> area<00:01:18.630> with<00:01:18.780> two

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990

after I color the mosque area with two
layers<00:01:19.259> of<00:01:19.409> white<00:01:19.619> facepaint<00:01:20.220> to<00:01:21.000> make<00:01:21.180> it

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
layers of white facepaint to make it

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.630 
layers of white facepaint to make it
more<00:01:21.479> opaque<00:01:21.869> I<00:01:22.170> take<00:01:22.649> a<00:01:22.680> mid<00:01:22.979> turned<00:01:23.280> brown

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
more opaque I take a mid turned brown

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.760 
more opaque I take a mid turned brown
eyeshadow<00:01:24.240> and<00:01:24.479> line<00:01:24.750> the<00:01:24.930> outside<00:01:25.110> perimeter
