00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:11.010
 I would like to apologize again 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.380
 I have I am the one who saw 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.230
 but I have to go deep with it 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:36.360
 that is interesting for you locked 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:38.430
 I did not get out what basically 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.750
 basically a when wind construction site 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.190
 is before the deep does not come out 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.239
 Shipping difficult after a quarter of an hour 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.110
 I lost it 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:48.930
 then we have to be short 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.399
 therefore short with three 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.469
 years late can come in 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.559
 but not done with it yet 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.989
 want to exchange here 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:59.489
 you can be ridiculously ironic 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.399
 let the undertone in very slowly 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:05.309
 otherwise it may even be that here off 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:15.600
 the record you understand that me 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:17.820
 Lived players do not have that 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.009
 appropriate mentality and give in 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.049
 the final consequence is not 100 percent 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:24.630
 if pointy is on the button as well 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:32.549
 anyway for example I have now 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:34.049
 our players in the knust and and on 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.189
 team did not care for me at all 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.189
 liked what he did there 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:47.210
 I would like that one here even 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:50.420
 like such a tactics meetings with me 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:54.920
 the worse I should play now 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:02:04.790
 Quote away money that I 'll leave me 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:06.260
 simply yes we are doing a meeting 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:11.170
 yes already call that I am so long 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:14.170
 but I insisted on that though at the moment 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:14.170
 sufficient 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.800
 if i have so much time 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.680
 but there is no problem that one 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:35.090
 sit down with you without 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:36.730
 that the players are there and and and 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.340
 sometimes talking about certain things 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:42.880
 that he is not a witchcraft 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.880
 at the end of the day 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.610
 we have to work youngest and 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.770
 to lift a certain comfort and 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.450
 Watching steal even a 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:18.110
 right band or where was climbing 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:24.470
 straight on 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:30.200
 but that is now we go 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:31.460
 get out and look away though you 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:42.820
 do not just play foliage is not after 

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:42.820
 in the back what many full score becomes 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:48.100
 according to my motivation this mine 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:48.100
 attitude 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:56.690
 you have no idea what 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:58.519
 for what kind of questionnaires that 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:00.769
 So I'm mine if you think that 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:02.030
 that is the tip of the top of the 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:04.190
 technically tactical development that 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:05.330
 We would have to follow the recommendations 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:07.580
 motive top 10 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:10.660
 then I go to the imaginable but 

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:12.739
 above that is motivated 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:15.560
 I think you have to go back to sylt 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:18.010
 I found again a little bit 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.010
 recover 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:26.530
 It would look a bit different 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:33.980
