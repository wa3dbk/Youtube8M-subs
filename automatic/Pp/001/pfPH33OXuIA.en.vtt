00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.570 
a gold right away and showed a lot of
character<00:00:19.109> from<00:00:19.260> a<00:00:19.320> lot<00:00:19.470> of<00:00:19.590> the<00:00:20.189> whole<00:00:20.369> team

character from a lot of the whole team

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.310 
character from a lot of the whole team
all<00:00:20.789> the<00:00:20.820> players<00:00:21.119> to<00:00:21.630> come<00:00:21.750> back<00:00:21.960> and<00:00:22.140> gain

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
all the players to come back and gain

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.710

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
the lead and hold to keep the win I

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.099 
the lead and hold to keep the win I
think<00:00:25.529> they<00:00:25.590> pushed<00:00:25.859> a<00:00:25.980> lot<00:00:26.130> and<00:00:26.779> show<00:00:27.779> that<00:00:27.810> we

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
think they pushed a lot and show that we

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.189 
think they pushed a lot and show that we
were<00:00:28.170> tough<00:00:28.380> team<00:00:28.590> to<00:00:28.619> play<00:00:28.740> against<00:00:30.199> they

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
were tough team to play against they

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.410 
were tough team to play against they
created<00:00:31.740> quite<00:00:32.460> a<00:00:32.520> few<00:00:32.730> chances<00:00:33.000> especially

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
created quite a few chances especially

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.959 
created quite a few chances especially
in<00:00:33.780> the<00:00:33.840> first<00:00:34.020> half<00:00:34.579> what<00:00:35.579> do<00:00:35.640> you<00:00:35.700> think<00:00:35.910> of

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
in the first half what do you think of

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.270 
in the first half what do you think of
the<00:00:36.120> opponent's<00:00:37.079> yeah<00:00:37.530> I<00:00:37.559> think<00:00:37.710> I<00:00:37.980> was

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
the opponent's yeah I think I was

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.959 
the opponent's yeah I think I was
struggling<00:00:39.920> winning<00:00:40.920> we<00:00:41.520> weren't<00:00:41.670> used<00:00:41.910> to

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
struggling winning we weren't used to

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.610 
struggling winning we weren't used to
the<00:00:42.120> fast<00:00:42.360> pitch<00:00:42.629> that<00:00:42.840> was<00:00:42.960> playing<00:00:43.200> the

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
the fast pitch that was playing the

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.590 
the fast pitch that was playing the
water<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.340> turf<00:00:44.850> and<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.239> ball<00:00:45.420> was<00:00:45.539> moving

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
water the turf and the ball was moving

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.610 
water the turf and the ball was moving
very<00:00:45.930> fast<00:00:47.090> so<00:00:48.090> I<00:00:48.120> didn't<00:00:48.570> give<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:49.230> midfield

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
very fast so I didn't give the midfield

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.250 
very fast so I didn't give the midfield
enough<00:00:49.860> time<00:00:50.070> to<00:00:50.219> slide<00:00:50.489> and<00:00:50.850> their<00:00:51.719> number<00:00:51.960> 12

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
enough time to slide and their number 12

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.100 
enough time to slide and their number 12
guard<00:00:52.530> kept<00:00:52.800> getting<00:00:53.070> in<00:00:53.219> behind<00:00:53.840> doll<00:00:54.840> and<00:00:55.050> I

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
guard kept getting in behind doll and I

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.720 
guard kept getting in behind doll and I
and<00:00:55.320> turning<00:00:55.710> and<00:00:55.800> causing<00:00:56.160> a<00:00:56.190> lot<00:00:56.309> of<00:00:56.340> trouble

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
and turning and causing a lot of trouble

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.700 
and turning and causing a lot of trouble
and<00:00:56.879> I<00:00:57.180> think<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.690> second<00:00:58.050> half<00:00:58.140> we<00:00:58.289> adapted

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
and I think the second half we adapted

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.819 
and I think the second half we adapted
to<00:00:58.770> that<00:00:58.890> and<00:00:59.660> just<00:01:00.660> a<00:01:00.809> real<00:01:01.020> well<00:01:01.289> and<00:01:01.320> I<00:01:01.680> think

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
to that and just a real well and I think

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.179 
to that and just a real well and I think
the<00:01:02.100> second<00:01:02.460> half<00:01:02.579> was<00:01:02.609> or<00:01:03.090> a<00:01:03.149> better<00:01:03.629> half<00:01:04.189> you

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
the second half was or a better half you

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.190 
the second half was or a better half you
know<00:01:05.280> we<00:01:05.430> adapted<00:01:05.790> to<00:01:05.850> it<00:01:06.060> and<00:01:06.210> did<00:01:06.930> a<00:01:06.990> good<00:01:07.140> job

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
know we adapted to it and did a good job

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.670 
know we adapted to it and did a good job
to<00:01:07.619> get<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.130> result<00:01:08.990> and<00:01:09.990> there<00:01:10.229> were<00:01:10.350> quite<00:01:10.619> a

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
to get the result and there were quite a

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.539 
to get the result and there were quite a
few<00:01:11.210> opportunities<00:01:12.210> to<00:01:12.740> counter-attack<00:01:13.740> how

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
few opportunities to counter-attack how

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.630 
few opportunities to counter-attack how
do<00:01:14.610> you<00:01:14.760> think<00:01:15.060> that<00:01:15.240> game<00:01:15.869> went<00:01:16.350> yeah<00:01:17.340> I<00:01:17.369> think

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
do you think that game went yeah I think

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.120 
do you think that game went yeah I think
I'm<00:01:17.990> O'Connor<00:01:18.990> needs<00:01:19.320> to<00:01:19.439> be<00:01:19.590> a<00:01:19.619> little<00:01:20.009> bit

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
I'm O'Connor needs to be a little bit

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.580 
I'm O'Connor needs to be a little bit
better<00:01:20.250> and<00:01:20.460> more<00:01:20.640> effective<00:01:20.909> I<00:01:21.509> think<00:01:22.439> there

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
better and more effective I think there

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.679 
better and more effective I think there
were<00:01:22.740> three<00:01:23.580> or<00:01:23.670> four<00:01:23.850> times<00:01:24.000> what<00:01:24.270> we<00:01:24.390> should

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
were three or four times what we should

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.830 
were three or four times what we should
have<00:01:24.720> capitalized<00:01:25.460> just<00:01:26.460> getting<00:01:27.390> that<00:01:27.420> final

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
have capitalized just getting that final

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.230 
have capitalized just getting that final
pass<00:01:28.020> in<00:01:28.259> and<00:01:28.409> hopefully<00:01:28.799> LED<00:01:29.790> one<00:01:29.939> more<00:01:30.090> game

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
pass in and hopefully LED one more game

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.179 
pass in and hopefully LED one more game
to<00:01:30.390> prepare<00:01:30.750> and<00:01:30.930> perfect<00:01:31.259> that<00:01:31.439> so<00:01:31.740> we<00:01:32.040> can

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
to prepare and perfect that so we can

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.940 
to prepare and perfect that so we can
take<00:01:32.310> advantage<00:01:32.400> of<00:01:32.790> that<00:01:33.170> um<00:01:34.170> tell<00:01:34.740> us<00:01:34.829> about

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
take advantage of that um tell us about

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.109 
take advantage of that um tell us about
the<00:01:35.310> goals<00:01:35.549> scored<00:01:36.829> both<00:01:37.829> goals<00:01:37.890> were<00:01:38.369> very

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
the goals scored both goals were very

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.550 
the goals scored both goals were very
well<00:01:39.299> developed<00:01:39.450> by<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:39.720> whole<00:01:39.930> team<00:01:40.140> I<00:01:40.170> think

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
well developed by the whole team I think

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.190 
well developed by the whole team I think
the<00:01:40.619> first<00:01:40.770> goal<00:01:41.040> was<00:01:41.189> really<00:01:41.549> nice<00:01:41.790> when<00:01:42.030> I

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
the first goal was really nice when I

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.240 
the first goal was really nice when I
figure<00:01:43.200> out<00:01:43.229> played<00:01:43.619> ball<00:01:43.860> to<00:01:44.009> me<00:01:44.130> in<00:01:44.189> the
