00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:09.370
 the biggest in the history of biro-biro 3 2 is a lot of fun 

00:00:10.199 --> 00:00:15.189
 and one fine day sharkboy and walked the prairies of dreams knowing others 

00:00:15.189 --> 00:00:18.519
 cloth dolls and missing around happy life 

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:23.179
 until a large and vacuumed head office that's good everyone's imagination 

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:26.179
 to a parallel dimension 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:38.900
 - the player is good and will know closely the inventors of this new world 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.920
 that will show new ways to use the scenarios in your favor 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:48.190
 the first of them mall 20 the breeder sings sinatra and dream to ceg to launch 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:51.330
 to the platforms with the curriculum 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:53.690
 It's good that I was until then. 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.270
 already posted here 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:58.310
 it's a charm 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:01.310
 mello 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:03.910
 that's why the old man 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.100
 chan 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.100
 the story is very amusing reaching in certain points 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.420
 using and abusing magical and playful objects in this aspect the big book 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.050
 planet is much better than its predecessor 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:19.490
 because cut scenes were included 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.409
 in dubbed dialogue details that were left out of the first game 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.330
 but the news of the campaign is just an appetizer 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:32.260
 and it is not there that the player will spend most of his time 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:36.760
 main attraction of the game is the large community that has structured one since the 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.360
 launch is very important the regional 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.369
 the campaign's real usefulness 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.490
 is to present to the player the new game mechanics 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.130
 and serve as inspiration 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.690
 for other stakeholders 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.690
 new games 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.500
 just like the first game the police now is to let go of the imagination and create 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.390
 new subway games for this is offered a tool of creation 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:12.400
 much more powerful than the first biennium now rather than creating new ones. 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.439
 platform stages the player can literally create any type of game 

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:19.740
 I could do anything 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:24.270
 of racing and strategy until he tried to split the first person 

00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:34.139
 to create games, it is necessary to go deeper into the study of 

00:02:34.139 --> 00:02:35.129
 tools 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:36.790
 go beyond tutorials 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.679
 and exchange ideas with other developers 

00:02:39.679 --> 00:02:44.699
 Kenya nairobi t2 stimulate this interaction a multiplayer mode to 

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:46.200
 up to four people 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.029
 and can meet to talk 

00:02:49.029 --> 00:02:53.990
 and create your adventures all very close together everyone with this 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:57.800
 for the criticized creators of the first book to live good news 

00:02:58.419 --> 00:03:02.040
 the works of the previous game were the French carried to the continuation 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.890
 this means that this is the budget 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:10.260
 inobstante to 2 already has more than 2 million new stadiums available 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.039
 on the playstation 3 network 

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:15.489
 the quality of these phases is debatable 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:19.959
 so it's good to keep an eye on the recommendations of the media molecule and 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:24.059
 most played stages of the moment to find the best creations 

00:03:25.219 --> 00:03:28.899
 the half molecule as well as many points in that continuation 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:32.469
 but also stepped on the ball a few times 

00:03:32.469 --> 00:03:36.619
 problems of collecting objects with the dolls present from the first 

00:03:36.619 --> 00:03:38.239
 day 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:39.379
 corrected 

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:42.379
 are mere charming which resulted in unnecessary deaths 

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:45.469
 also with the most beloved 

00:03:45.469 --> 00:03:48.130
 I believe that today is more elaborate completed 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:50.799
 does not have the same impact as the first game 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:54.129
 play create that share is not new 

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:58.119
 the game suffers with delays in matches by the tv and the internet 

00:03:59.039 --> 00:04:02.739
 which disrupts and stages that require speed accuracy 

00:04:03.249 --> 00:04:05.000
 for this the best thing to do 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.749
 is to try to reunite Brazilian friends in the 

00:04:07.749 --> 00:04:10.019
 or better option to play at home 

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:11.249
 berlocq 

00:04:11.249 --> 00:04:12.819
 the simplicity 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:15.449
 shooters is its main brand 

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:18.719
 the game continued being attacked paulista and santa inÃªs 

00:04:18.719 --> 00:04:22.719
 showing that the cloth dolls can yes it will be great the companions 

00:04:22.719 --> 00:04:24.080
 for the vacant hours 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.469
 even with connection problems very lively and fun 

00:04:28.469 --> 00:04:32.669
 the large number of stadiums made by the community increases and much life 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:38.149
 the bank finally paid me valdinei spend hours and more hours with 

00:04:38.149 --> 00:04:39.800
 smile on face 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.410
 I was resting at your house.
