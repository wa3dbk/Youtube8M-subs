00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:02.970 
want it to be a stylish mom I definitely
with<00:03:01.420> Liam<00:03:01.780> I<00:03:01.930> didn't<00:03:02.170> have<00:03:02.290> a<00:03:02.319> traditional

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
with Liam I didn't have a traditional

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.220 
with Liam I didn't have a traditional
diaper<00:03:03.220> bag<00:03:03.579> and<00:03:03.820> this<00:03:04.360> seems<00:03:04.600> functional

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
diaper bag and this seems functional

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.530 
diaper bag and this seems functional
enough<00:03:05.560> my<00:03:05.829> only<00:03:06.100> hesitation<00:03:06.430> about<00:03:07.120> it<00:03:07.450> is

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
enough my only hesitation about it is

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.900 
enough my only hesitation about it is
that<00:03:07.570> its<00:03:08.320> patent<00:03:08.860> leather<00:03:09.160> which<00:03:09.519> is<00:03:09.700> good<00:03:09.880> I

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
that its patent leather which is good I

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:11.910 
that its patent leather which is good I
thought<00:03:10.180> okay<00:03:10.450> you<00:03:10.510> can<00:03:10.750> wipe<00:03:10.930> it<00:03:11.200> it<00:03:11.680> won't

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
thought okay you can wipe it it won't

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.180 
thought okay you can wipe it it won't
get<00:03:12.100> dirty<00:03:12.310> but<00:03:12.790> a<00:03:13.230> little<00:03:14.230> like<00:03:14.410> sticky<00:03:15.160> I

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
get dirty but a little like sticky I

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:16.920 
get dirty but a little like sticky I
feel<00:03:15.519> like<00:03:15.640> if<00:03:15.820> it's<00:03:16.000> hot<00:03:16.180> and<00:03:16.359> sweaty<00:03:16.660> which

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
feel like if it's hot and sweaty which

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:18.660 
feel like if it's hot and sweaty which
winners<00:03:17.380> coming<00:03:17.769> up<00:03:17.890> anyway<00:03:18.190> so<00:03:18.250> maybe<00:03:18.519> I

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
winners coming up anyway so maybe I

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.940 
winners coming up anyway so maybe I
won't<00:03:18.790> have<00:03:18.910> that<00:03:19.030> problem<00:03:19.260> but<00:03:20.260> it's<00:03:20.590> just

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
won't have that problem but it's just

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.220 
won't have that problem but it's just
like<00:03:21.100> a<00:03:21.220> little<00:03:21.400> on<00:03:21.850> the<00:03:21.910> sticky<00:03:22.540> side<00:03:22.690> I<00:03:22.900> can't

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.770 
like a little on the sticky side I can't
explain<00:03:23.590> it<00:03:23.709> not<00:03:24.160> that<00:03:24.310> it's<00:03:24.459> sticky<00:03:24.850> but

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
explain it not that it's sticky but

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.349

00:03:57.809 --> 00:03:57.819 
counting down this way even though

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:00.030 
counting down this way even though
according<00:03:58.180> to<00:03:58.480> what<00:03:58.690> to<00:03:58.840> expect<00:03:59.200> now<00:03:59.799> I<00:03:59.829> have

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
according to what to expect now I have

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.059 
according to what to expect now I have
six<00:04:00.519> weeks<00:04:00.760> but<00:04:01.090> if<00:04:01.720> I<00:04:01.989> have<00:04:02.170> a<00:04:02.200> c-section<00:04:02.500> I'm

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:06.489 
countdown is a little different than the

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:09.620
