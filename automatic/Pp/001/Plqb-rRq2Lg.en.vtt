and this the only problem with places
like<00:00:32.430> this<00:00:32.640> is<00:00:33.150> well<00:00:34.050> they're<00:00:34.260> not<00:00:34.290> exactly

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
like this is well they're not exactly

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:40.100 
real we all know that this ford focus RS
would<00:00:37.950> be<00:00:38.040> eaten<00:00:38.340> alive<00:00:38.610> by<00:00:39.000> that<00:00:39.300> Nissan<00:00:39.750> GTR

little Drive and we're going to try to
find<00:01:18.460> out<00:01:18.610> just<00:01:18.820> how<00:01:19.450> much<00:01:19.479> of<00:01:19.990> the<00:01:20.350> advantage

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:20.950 
find out just how much of the advantage
