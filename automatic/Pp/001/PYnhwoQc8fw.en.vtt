00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
hybrid can so today I thought I'd make a

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.759 
hybrid can so today I thought I'd make a
quick<00:00:08.910> tutorial<00:00:09.150> of<00:00:09.630> a<00:00:09.780> basic<00:00:10.080> hybrid<00:00:10.469> condom

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
quick tutorial of a basic hybrid condom

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.390 
quick tutorial of a basic hybrid condom
and<00:00:10.969> well<00:00:11.969> this<00:00:12.360> is<00:00:12.509> it<00:00:12.690> so<00:00:13.070> first<00:00:14.070> you<00:00:14.219> need<00:00:14.340> to

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
and well this is it so first you need to

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.490 
and well this is it so first you need to
build<00:00:14.580> a<00:00:14.730> barrel<00:00:15.150> this<00:00:16.109> controls<00:00:16.500> the<00:00:16.710> shot<00:00:17.070> um

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:18.500 
build a barrel this controls the shot um

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.849 
build a barrel this controls the shot um
then<00:00:20.180> you<00:00:21.180> need<00:00:21.359> to<00:00:21.480> obviously<00:00:21.930> add<00:00:22.590> the

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
then you need to obviously add the

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.310 
then you need to obviously add the
dispenser<00:00:23.760> here<00:00:24.660> which<00:00:25.109> is<00:00:25.260> the<00:00:25.439> shot<00:00:25.859> itself

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:27.320 
dispenser here which is the shot itself

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.800 
dispenser here which is the shot itself
on<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:28.500> side<00:00:29.029> place<00:00:30.029> a<00:00:30.060> piston<00:00:30.570> which

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
on the side place a piston which

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.970 
on the side place a piston which
controls<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.500> Sun<00:00:31.800> dropping<00:00:33.320> um<00:00:35.059> like<00:00:36.059> that

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:36.980 
controls the Sun dropping um like that

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.260 
controls the Sun dropping um like that
make<00:00:37.980> sure<00:00:38.010> you<00:00:38.219> have<00:00:38.370> all<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.610> redstone<00:00:39.059> link

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
make sure you have all the redstone link

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:45.110 
make sure you have all the redstone link
them<00:00:41.600> right<00:00:42.680> then<00:00:43.680> you<00:00:43.829> add<00:00:44.040> dispensers<00:00:44.940> each

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
them right then you add dispensers each

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.940 
them right then you add dispensers each
side<00:00:48.050> obviously<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.230> more<00:00:49.559> you<00:00:49.710> want<00:00:49.829> to

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
side obviously the more you want to

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.830 
side obviously the more you want to
shoot<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.789> mall<00:00:51.420> dispensers<00:00:52.050> you<00:00:52.800> add<00:00:53.840> so

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
shoot the mall dispensers you add so

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.180 
shoot the mall dispensers you add so
this<00:00:54.989> is<00:00:55.110> pretty<00:00:55.320> straightforward<00:00:56.420> then<00:00:57.420> you

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 
this is pretty straightforward then you

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.340 
this is pretty straightforward then you
put<00:00:59.190> there<00:00:59.510> like<00:01:00.510> that<00:01:00.660> make<00:01:00.960> sure<00:01:01.109> it's<00:01:01.230> got

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
put there like that make sure it's got

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.920 
put there like that make sure it's got
to<00:01:01.590> that<00:01:01.800> kiss<00:01:02.129> when<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.670> tin<00:01:03.239> to<00:01:03.359> dispense<00:01:03.780> is

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
to that kiss when the tin to dispense is

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.710 
to that kiss when the tin to dispense is
it<00:01:04.080> to<00:01:04.260> choose<00:01:04.500> and<00:01:04.739> lands<00:01:05.129> on<00:01:05.220> here<00:01:05.489> that<00:01:05.720> does

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
it to choose and lands on here that does

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.760 
it to choose and lands on here that does
happen<00:01:06.900> sometimes<00:01:08.299> right<00:01:09.299> that's<00:01:10.200> basic

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
happen sometimes right that's basic

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
happen sometimes right that's basic
cannon<00:01:11.130> layout<00:01:12.350> as<00:01:13.350> you<00:01:13.530> can<00:01:13.650> see<00:01:13.799> dispenses

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
cannon layout as you can see dispenses

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:21.350 
cannon layout as you can see dispenses
for<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.090> power<00:01:17.450> dispenser<00:01:18.450> power<00:01:18.900> arm<00:01:20.360> listen

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
for the power dispenser power arm listen

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:27.070 
for the power dispenser power arm listen
for<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.689> Sun<00:01:22.049> dispenser<00:01:22.860> for<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.070> shot

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.130 

so<00:01:28.080> now<00:01:28.530> usually<00:01:28.979> add<00:01:29.400> in<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.670> red<00:01:29.850> stone

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
so now usually add in the red stone

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:35.810 
so now usually add in the red stone
which<00:01:31.140> is<00:01:31.290> pretty<00:01:31.500> straightforward<00:01:34.729> so<00:01:35.729> you

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
which is pretty straightforward so you

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.440 
which is pretty straightforward so you
just<00:01:35.880> do<00:01:36.869> this<00:01:37.050> um<00:01:37.820> if<00:01:38.820> you<00:01:38.909> put<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.180> repeats

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
just do this um if you put the repeats

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.289 
just do this um if you put the repeats
on<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.659> bottom<00:01:39.930> here<00:01:40.110> this<00:01:40.530> will<00:01:40.680> power<00:01:40.920> to

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:41.299 
on the bottom here this will power to

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:45.050 
on the bottom here this will power to
dispenses<00:01:42.299> up<00:01:42.619> so<00:01:43.619> that's<00:01:43.920> good<00:01:44.280> for<00:01:44.460> both

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
dispenses up so that's good for both

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.899 
dispenses up so that's good for both
defenses<00:01:45.750> are<00:01:45.950> then<00:01:46.950> do<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.430> same<00:01:47.460> on<00:01:47.759> this

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
defenses are then do the same on this

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:54.040 
defenses are then do the same on this
side<00:01:48.890> which<00:01:49.890> is<00:01:50.070> pretty<00:01:50.369> straightforward<00:01:50.820> um

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:54.050 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:59.180 

then<00:01:55.050> you<00:01:55.200> place<00:01:55.590> a<00:01:55.619> button<00:01:56.250> here<00:01:58.070> so<00:01:59.070> that

00:01:59.180 --> 00:01:59.190 
then you place a button here so that

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:02.779 
then you place a button here so that
powers<00:01:59.399> of<00:01:59.580> all<00:01:59.850> the<00:02:00.060> dispensers<00:02:01.729> now<00:02:02.729> you

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:02.789 
powers of all the dispensers now you

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:04.820 
powers of all the dispensers now you
just<00:02:02.850> make<00:02:03.149> a<00:02:03.179> link<00:02:03.450> up<00:02:03.630> your<00:02:03.800> dispenser<00:02:04.800> for

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:04.830 
just make a link up your dispenser for

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:09.169 
just make a link up your dispenser for
the<00:02:05.009> shot<00:02:05.369> and<00:02:05.580> the<00:02:06.030> Sun<00:02:07.160> so<00:02:08.160> place<00:02:08.910> a<00:02:08.940> block

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
the shot and the Sun so place a block

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.530 
the shot and the Sun so place a block
here<00:02:09.920> come<00:02:10.920> along<00:02:11.130> out<00:02:11.340> so<00:02:11.880> this<00:02:12.060> thing

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
here come along out so this thing

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.190 
here come along out so this thing
redstone<00:02:13.380> doesn't<00:02:13.739> connect<00:02:14.370> and<00:02:15.050> this<00:02:16.050> should

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
redstone doesn't connect and this should

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.620 
redstone doesn't connect and this should
really<00:02:16.769> be<00:02:16.980> set<00:02:17.730> on<00:02:18.290> nine<00:02:19.290> ticks<00:02:20.420> ball<00:02:21.420> nine

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
really be set on nine ticks ball nine

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:31.740 
really be set on nine ticks ball nine
full<00:02:21.900> repeaters<00:02:23.870> so<00:02:24.870> do<00:02:25.170> that<00:02:25.380> now

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:38.310 

change<00:02:32.470> that's<00:02:33.720> 9c<00:02:34.720> not<00:02:35.470> yep<00:02:35.830> right<00:02:37.170> so<00:02:38.170> now

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:38.320 
change that's 9c not yep right so now

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.560 
change that's 9c not yep right so now
that<00:02:38.500> you<00:02:38.590> shot<00:02:38.860> is<00:02:38.950> linked<00:02:39.250> up<00:02:39.400> you're<00:02:40.390> good

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.570

so that's your basic cannon yeah that's
a<00:03:40.389> hybrid<00:03:40.659> kinda<00:03:40.900> it's<00:03:41.709> pretty<00:03:42.250> accurate<00:03:42.459> um

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
a hybrid kinda it's pretty accurate um

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:47.839 
a hybrid kinda it's pretty accurate um
yeah<00:03:44.680> I'll<00:03:45.549> load<00:03:45.970> it<00:03:46.000> opened<00:03:46.450> we'll<00:03:47.290> test<00:03:47.680> it

00:03:47.839 --> 00:03:47.849 
yeah I'll load it opened we'll test it

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:51.300 
yeah I'll load it opened we'll test it
bye<00:03:48.849> guys<00:03:49.090> I'm<00:03:49.299> back<00:03:49.450> and<00:03:49.720> the<00:03:50.650> cannon<00:03:51.189> is

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
bye guys I'm back and the cannon is

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.470 
bye guys I'm back and the cannon is
completely<00:03:52.030> loaded<00:03:52.299> now<00:03:52.599> um<00:03:54.090> you<00:03:55.090> just<00:03:55.120> make

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
completely loaded now um you just make

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.619 
completely loaded now um you just make
something<00:03:56.469> for<00:03:56.829> it<00:03:56.889> to<00:03:57.040> shoot<00:03:57.340> onto<00:03:57.549> and<00:03:58.000> then

00:03:58.619 --> 00:03:58.629 
something for it to shoot onto and then

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:06.820 
something for it to shoot onto and then
you<00:03:58.719> can<00:03:58.870> see<00:03:59.019> how<00:03:59.790> quite<00:04:00.790> a<00:04:00.819> curative

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:06.830 

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:08.990 

obviously<00:04:07.830> this<00:04:07.980> can<00:04:08.190> choose<00:04:08.400> far<00:04:08.790> as<00:04:08.910> you

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
obviously this can choose far as you

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.640 
obviously this can choose far as you
want<00:04:09.120> it<00:04:09.209> to<00:04:09.240> you<00:04:09.540> just<00:04:09.720> add<00:04:09.840> more<00:04:09.990> dispensers

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.650 
want it to you just add more dispensers

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:18.770 
want it to you just add more dispensers
this<00:04:13.650> is<00:04:14.030> pretty<00:04:15.889> advanced<00:04:16.889> hybrid<00:04:17.040> can<00:04:17.780> and

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
this is pretty advanced hybrid can and

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:20.599 
this is pretty advanced hybrid can and
as<00:04:18.930> you<00:04:19.049> can<00:04:19.169> see<00:04:19.200> just<00:04:19.980> make<00:04:20.160> sure<00:04:20.190> that<00:04:20.310> all

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
as you can see just make sure that all

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:26.390 
as you can see just make sure that all
the<00:04:20.940> time<00:04:20.970> is<00:04:21.329> correct<00:04:22.220> yeah<00:04:23.220> yeah<00:04:25.370> make<00:04:26.370> sure

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
the time is correct yeah yeah make sure

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.030 
the time is correct yeah yeah make sure
that's<00:04:26.669> linked<00:04:26.880> to<00:04:27.030> I'm<00:04:27.540> not<00:04:27.780> right<00:04:28.230> so<00:04:28.860> this

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040 
that's linked to I'm not right so this

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:35.740 
that's linked to I'm not right so this
is<00:04:29.070> ready<00:04:29.400> shoot<00:04:29.870> let's<00:04:30.870> go<00:04:30.990> ahead<00:04:31.020> and<00:04:31.200> shoot

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:35.750 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:38.750 

so<00:04:36.750> that<00:04:36.930> was<00:04:37.050> pretty<00:04:37.440> much<00:04:37.770> bang<00:04:38.220> on<00:04:38.370> accurate

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:38.760 
so that was pretty much bang on accurate

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:42.670 
so that was pretty much bang on accurate
and<00:04:38.970> as<00:04:39.780> you<00:04:39.930> say<00:04:40.140> blow<00:04:40.620> up<00:04:40.680> straight<00:04:41.070> over

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:42.680 
and as you say blow up straight over

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.380 
and as you say blow up straight over
however<00:04:43.680> if<00:04:44.190> you<00:04:44.430> just<00:04:44.610> want<00:04:44.760> it<00:04:44.880> stacks<00:04:45.180> and

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:45.390 
however if you just want it stacks and

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:48.050 
however if you just want it stacks and
then<00:04:45.660> you<00:04:45.780> would<00:04:45.960> disable<00:04:46.530> this<00:04:47.030> Sybil<00:04:48.030> the

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 
then you would disable this Sybil the

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:52.250 
then you would disable this Sybil the
shot<00:04:49.370> shoot<00:04:50.370> again<00:04:50.730> I<00:04:50.990> wouldn't<00:04:51.990> recommend

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:52.260 
shot shoot again I wouldn't recommend

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:53.780 
shot shoot again I wouldn't recommend
this<00:04:52.470> though<00:04:52.650> because<00:04:52.770> it<00:04:52.919> does<00:04:53.250> take<00:04:53.490> a<00:04:53.520> lot

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:53.790 
this though because it does take a lot

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:58.850 
this though because it does take a lot
of<00:04:53.850> TNT<00:04:54.680> obviously<00:04:55.680> there's<00:04:55.919> stacks<00:04:56.280> and<00:04:57.860> if

00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:58.860 
of TNT obviously there's stacks and if

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:01.760 
of TNT obviously there's stacks and if
you<00:04:59.729> want<00:04:59.940> it<00:05:00.090> to<00:05:00.240> tunnel<00:05:00.690> with<00:05:01.229> this<00:05:01.410> cannon

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:01.770 
you want it to tunnel with this cannon

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:03.500 
you want it to tunnel with this cannon
without<00:05:02.490> having<00:05:02.729> to<00:05:02.790> make<00:05:02.940> complete<00:05:03.330> new

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:03.510 
without having to make complete new

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:06.440 
without having to make complete new
cannon<00:05:03.870> you<00:05:03.960> would<00:05:04.110> take<00:05:04.260> off<00:05:05.060> two<00:05:06.060> repeaters

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:06.450 
cannon you would take off two repeaters

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:12.010 
cannon you would take off two repeaters
and<00:05:07.130> add<00:05:08.130> in<00:05:08.430> a<00:05:08.550> comparator<00:05:09.560> here<00:05:10.560> like<00:05:11.160> so

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:12.020 
and add in a comparator here like so

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:18.469 
and add in a comparator here like so
link<00:05:13.020> up<00:05:13.140> the<00:05:13.260> Rebs<00:05:13.440> are<00:05:13.560> like<00:05:13.710> that<00:05:13.890> and<00:05:17.479> shoot

00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:18.479 
link up the Rebs are like that and shoot

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:20.690 
link up the Rebs are like that and shoot
again<00:05:18.570> and<00:05:18.810> what<00:05:19.740> the<00:05:19.830> compiler<00:05:20.130> does<00:05:20.490> it

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:20.700 
again and what the compiler does it

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:25.760 
again and what the compiler does it
sends<00:05:21.479> multiple<00:05:21.870> pulses<00:05:22.080> to<00:05:22.770> the<00:05:23.180> cannon<00:05:24.770> to

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:25.770 
sends multiple pulses to the cannon to

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:29.029 
sends multiple pulses to the cannon to
the<00:05:25.890> dispensary<00:05:26.190> and<00:05:27.020> does<00:05:28.020> a<00:05:28.050> huge<00:05:28.530> shot<00:05:28.860> like

00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:29.039 
the dispensary and does a huge shot like

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:33.469 
the dispensary and does a huge shot like
that<00:05:30.830> so<00:05:31.830> that's<00:05:32.370> pretty<00:05:32.760> much<00:05:32.910> good<00:05:33.300> for

00:05:33.469 --> 00:05:33.479 
that so that's pretty much good for

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:35.270 
that so that's pretty much good for
tunneling<00:05:33.780> as<00:05:33.930> well<00:05:34.080> it<00:05:34.470> makes<00:05:34.650> a<00:05:34.770> pretty

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:35.280 
tunneling as well it makes a pretty

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:39.890 
tunneling as well it makes a pretty
decent<00:05:35.669> home<00:05:35.820> um<00:05:36.750> um<00:05:37.640> that<00:05:38.640> is<00:05:38.789> basically<00:05:39.240> it

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:39.900 
decent home um um that is basically it

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:42.469 
decent home um um that is basically it
