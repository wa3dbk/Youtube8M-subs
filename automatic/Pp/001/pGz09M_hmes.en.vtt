popper high school study number 14 which
is<00:00:13.809> for<00:00:14.110> up<00:00:14.230> both<00:00:14.469> staccato<00:00:15.029> and<00:00:16.529> also<00:00:17.529> some

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:18.130 
is for up both staccato and also some

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:20.009 
is for up both staccato and also some
position<00:00:18.520> study<00:00:18.789> you<00:00:18.910> know<00:00:19.060> as<00:00:19.390> with<00:00:19.600> poppy<00:00:19.810> he

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:20.019 
position study you know as with poppy he

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:21.509 
position study you know as with poppy he
wants<00:00:20.380> to<00:00:20.470> teach<00:00:20.619> you<00:00:20.769> everything<00:00:20.920> all<00:00:21.369> the

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:21.519 
wants to teach you everything all the

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:23.670 
wants to teach you everything all the
time<00:00:21.730> the<00:00:22.390> way<00:00:22.570> that<00:00:22.750> I<00:00:22.840> want<00:00:23.080> you<00:00:23.199> to<00:00:23.289> practice

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:23.680 
time the way that I want you to practice

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.480 
time the way that I want you to practice
this<00:00:24.180> is<00:00:25.180> as<00:00:26.020> if<00:00:26.170> it's<00:00:26.350> legato<00:00:26.710> but<00:00:27.280> we've

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:27.490 
this is as if it's legato but we've

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:29.250 
this is as if it's legato but we've
talked<00:00:27.789> before<00:00:27.910> about<00:00:28.240> the<00:00:28.539> first<00:00:28.780> finger

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:29.260 
talked before about the first finger

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:30.510 
talked before about the first finger
it's<00:00:29.740> something<00:00:29.980> that<00:00:30.070> I<00:00:30.190> called<00:00:30.430> the

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:30.520 
it's something that I called the

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.750 
it's something that I called the
woodpecker<00:00:30.940> so<00:00:31.690> the<00:00:31.869> idea<00:00:32.230> is<00:00:32.529> that<00:00:33.219> the<00:00:33.550> hand

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:33.760 
woodpecker so the idea is that the hand

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.819 
woodpecker so the idea is that the hand
is<00:00:33.850> relaxed<00:00:34.239> but<00:00:34.660> there's<00:00:35.109> tension<00:00:35.469> and

00:00:35.819 --> 00:00:35.829 
is relaxed but there's tension and

00:00:35.829 --> 00:01:05.490 
is relaxed but there's tension and
release<00:00:36.070> so<00:00:51.899> where<00:00:52.899> your<00:00:53.049> hand<00:01:04.199> just<00:01:05.199> try<00:01:05.470> for

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:05.500 
release so where your hand just try for

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.800 
release so where your hand just try for
the<00:01:05.740> beginning<00:01:06.119> and<00:01:07.119> she<00:01:07.240> just<00:01:07.390> let's<00:01:07.600> try<00:01:07.750> to

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:07.810 
the beginning and she just let's try to

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:09.630 
the beginning and she just let's try to
an<00:01:07.930> octave<00:01:08.200> down<00:01:08.380> start<00:01:08.710> with<00:01:08.860> so<00:01:09.010> nothing<00:01:09.490> to

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:09.640 
an octave down start with so nothing to

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:19.200 
an octave down start with so nothing to
me

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.210 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.450 

good<00:01:20.210> now<00:01:20.630> just<00:01:21.050> make<00:01:21.290> sure<00:01:21.470> that<00:01:21.860> the<00:01:22.130> release

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
good now just make sure that the release

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:23.920 
good now just make sure that the release
is<00:01:22.490> the<00:01:22.820> most<00:01:23.060> important<00:01:23.570> part<00:01:23.720> of<00:01:23.840> this

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:23.930 
is the most important part of this

00:01:23.930 --> 00:02:02.230 
is the most important part of this
obviously<00:01:43.990> so<00:01:59.860> yeah<00:02:00.860> exactly<00:02:01.070> so<00:02:01.460> because<00:02:02.090> we

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 
obviously so yeah exactly so because we

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.640 
obviously so yeah exactly so because we
need<00:02:02.450> to<00:02:02.570> have<00:02:02.690> a<00:02:02.720> certain<00:02:02.960> release<00:02:03.380> and<00:02:03.590> we

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:03.650 
need to have a certain release and we

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:04.960 
need to have a certain release and we
need<00:02:03.800> to<00:02:03.890> drop<00:02:04.040> the<00:02:04.250> weight<00:02:04.370> into<00:02:04.610> the<00:02:04.820> boat

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 
need to drop the weight into the boat

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:20.500 
need to drop the weight into the boat
your<00:02:05.690> boat<00:02:05.870> a<00:02:06.160> little<00:02:07.160> bit<00:02:18.340> so<00:02:19.340> that's<00:02:19.730> the

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
your boat a little bit so that's the

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.210 
your boat a little bit so that's the
idea<00:02:20.630> of<00:02:20.930> tension<00:02:21.380> release<00:02:21.620> you're<00:02:21.920> playing

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
idea of tension release you're playing

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.220 
idea of tension release you're playing
with<00:02:22.370> legato<00:02:22.760> and<00:02:23.239> then<00:02:23.660> you're<00:02:23.810> just<00:02:24.020> using

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
with legato and then you're just using

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.830 
with legato and then you're just using
your<00:02:24.410> woodpecker<00:02:24.830> to<00:02:25.580> articulate<00:02:26.180> I<00:02:26.360> would

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
your woodpecker to articulate I would

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.360 
your woodpecker to articulate I would
start<00:02:27.110> very<00:02:27.290> slowly<00:02:27.500> wheezes<00:02:27.860> again<00:02:28.160> it's

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
start very slowly wheezes again it's

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.490 
start very slowly wheezes again it's
easy<00:02:28.580> for<00:02:28.820> but<00:02:28.970> it<00:02:29.150> becomes<00:02:29.450> fasten<00:02:29.900> and<00:02:30.110> is<00:02:30.320> it

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
easy for but it becomes fasten and is it

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.550 
easy for but it becomes fasten and is it
then<00:02:31.010> then<00:02:31.340> you're<00:02:31.459> just<00:02:31.640> if<00:02:32.150> you're

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
then then you're just if you're

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.240 
then then you're just if you're
counteracting<00:02:33.560> too<00:02:33.650> much<00:02:33.800> with<00:02:33.950> the<00:02:34.010> back<00:02:34.130> of

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
counteracting too much with the back of

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.130 
counteracting too much with the back of
your<00:02:34.280> hand<00:02:34.550> your<00:02:35.270> hand<00:02:35.450> will<00:02:35.570> get<00:02:35.660> tense<00:02:35.959> and

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
your hand your hand will get tense and

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:37.030 
your hand your hand will get tense and
then<00:02:36.290> you'll<00:02:36.440> start<00:02:36.650> doing<00:02:36.680> the<00:02:36.860> whole<00:02:37.010> thing

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
then you'll start doing the whole thing

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.290 
then you'll start doing the whole thing
with<00:02:37.220> your<00:02:37.370> whole<00:02:37.550> arm<00:02:37.700> and<00:02:37.850> that<00:02:37.940> won't<00:02:38.090> work

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 
with your whole arm and that won't work

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.120 
with your whole arm and that won't work
so<00:02:38.930> just<00:02:39.140> lately<00:02:39.470> just<00:02:39.800> from<00:02:39.920> the<00:02:39.980> very

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
so just lately just from the very

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:54.680 
so just lately just from the very
beginning<00:02:40.220> so

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.360 

tastic<00:02:55.020> and<00:02:55.200> so<00:02:55.350> of<00:02:55.590> course<00:02:55.650> the<00:02:55.890> next<00:02:56.070> step<00:02:56.160> is

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
tastic and so of course the next step is

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:57.770 
tastic and so of course the next step is
going<00:02:56.460> to<00:02:56.520> be<00:02:56.640> used<00:02:56.790> less<00:02:57.030> boat<00:02:57.300> for<00:02:57.480> each<00:02:57.540> note

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
going to be used less boat for each note

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:05.270 
going to be used less boat for each note
so<00:03:02.420> I'm<00:03:03.420> really<00:03:03.780> literally<00:03:04.260> using<00:03:04.650> centimeter

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
so I'm really literally using centimeter

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:15.560 
so I'm really literally using centimeter
each<00:03:05.460> note<00:03:13.670> don't<00:03:14.670> look<00:03:14.820> fantastic<00:03:15.030> so<00:03:15.420> that's

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570 
each note don't look fantastic so that's

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:18.170 
each note don't look fantastic so that's
the<00:03:15.840> idea<00:03:16.140> so<00:03:16.320> that's<00:03:16.740> how<00:03:17.070> we<00:03:17.790> would<00:03:17.820> start

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
the idea so that's how we would start

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.690 
the idea so that's how we would start
working<00:03:18.300> on<00:03:18.780> proper<00:03:19.200> number<00:03:19.800> fourteen<00:03:20.220> up

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
working on proper number fourteen up

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.420 
working on proper number fourteen up
both<00:03:21.000> staccato
