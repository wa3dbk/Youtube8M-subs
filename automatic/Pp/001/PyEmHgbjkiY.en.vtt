boogie board you will have to run a

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.770 
boogie board you will have to run a
charge<00:00:53.039> through<00:00:53.340> it<00:00:53.520> so<00:00:54.149> it<00:00:54.300> needs<00:00:54.480> to<00:00:54.660> be<00:00:54.750> on

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
charge through it so it needs to be on

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.229 
charge through it so it needs to be on
for<00:00:55.260> that<00:00:55.379> as<00:00:55.590> well<00:00:55.860> however<00:00:56.489> you<00:00:56.879> can<00:00:57.059> write

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
for that as well however you can write

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.150 
for that as well however you can write
on<00:00:57.390> it<00:00:57.420> just<00:00:57.899> fine<00:00:58.170> without<00:00:58.350> any<00:00:58.770> power

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.520 
on it just fine without any power
required<00:00:59.910> and<00:01:00.300> it<00:01:00.660> will<00:01:00.809> stay<00:01:01.050> there<00:01:01.289> until

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
lined and grid ruled papers so it does

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.410 
lined and grid ruled papers so it does
have<00:02:26.500> quite<00:02:26.920> a<00:02:26.950> bit<00:02:27.280> of<00:02:27.310> usefulness<00:02:27.790> aside

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420

from<00:02:28.750> just<00:02:29.140> the<00:02:29.440> note-taking<00:02:30.130> now<00:02:30.790> for<00:02:31.090> my

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:31.239 
from just the note-taking now for my

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:33.180 
from just the note-taking now for my
part<00:02:31.510> I<00:02:31.750> found<00:02:31.989> the<00:02:32.110> boogie<00:02:32.349> board<00:02:32.530> sink<00:02:32.830> to<00:02:33.010> be

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
part I found the boogie board sink to be

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.270 
part I found the boogie board sink to be
well<00:02:33.519> worth<00:02:33.849> my<00:02:34.120> time<00:02:34.480> I<00:02:34.900> find<00:02:35.620> myself<00:02:35.739> in

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
well worth my time I find myself in

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.570 
well worth my time I find myself in
classes<00:02:36.940> taking<00:02:37.450> notes<00:02:37.930> and<00:02:38.319> not<00:02:39.069> really

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
classes taking notes and not really

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.040 
classes taking notes and not really
needing<00:02:39.849> to<00:02:39.880> refer<00:02:40.300> back<00:02:40.599> to<00:02:40.660> those<00:02:40.989> notes

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
needing to refer back to those notes

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:44.670 
needing to refer back to those notes
until<00:02:41.560> after<00:02:42.220> class<00:02:42.519> is<00:02:42.849> done<00:02:43.319> this<00:02:44.319> means

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
until after class is done this means

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.210 
until after class is done this means
that<00:02:44.950> that<00:02:45.130> inability<00:02:45.819> to<00:02:45.850> recall<00:02:46.380> notes<00:02:47.380> to

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
that that inability to recall notes to

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.850 
that that inability to recall notes to
the<00:02:48.489> screen<00:02:48.760> surface<00:02:49.150> is<00:02:49.540> definitely<00:02:50.500> not<00:02:50.680> an

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
the screen surface is definitely not an

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:54.000 
the screen surface is definitely not an
issue<00:02:51.010> for<00:02:51.220> me<00:02:51.489> although<00:02:52.420> I<00:02:53.110> did<00:02:53.470> put<00:02:53.650> it<00:02:53.769> into

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
issue for me although I did put it into

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:55.620 
issue for me although I did put it into
the<00:02:54.100> hands<00:02:54.430> of<00:02:54.489> some<00:02:54.700> of<00:02:54.790> my<00:02:54.819> friends<00:02:55.180> who<00:02:55.600> are

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:55.630 
the hands of some of my friends who are

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.490 
the hands of some of my friends who are
more<00:02:56.170> artistic<00:02:56.980> and<00:02:57.190> they<00:02:58.030> found<00:02:58.269> that<00:02:58.540> it

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
more artistic and they found that it

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.610 
more artistic and they found that it
wasn't<00:02:59.860> really<00:03:00.280> quite<00:03:00.640> for<00:03:01.150> them<00:03:01.420> for<00:03:01.959> example

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
wasn't really quite for them for example

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.550 
wasn't really quite for them for example
the<00:03:03.250> line<00:03:03.519> width<00:03:03.819> doesn't<00:03:04.330> vary<00:03:04.660> too<00:03:05.019> much<00:03:05.290> and

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:05.560 
the line width doesn't vary too much and

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.970 
the line width doesn't vary too much and
the<00:03:05.620> pressure<00:03:05.830> sensitivity<00:03:06.430> is<00:03:06.849> kind<00:03:07.480> of<00:03:07.630> low

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
the pressure sensitivity is kind of low

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.380 
the pressure sensitivity is kind of low
again<00:03:08.980> not<00:03:09.280> a<00:03:09.310> deal-breaker<00:03:09.610> for<00:03:09.970> note-taking

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
again not a deal-breaker for note-taking

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.650 
again not a deal-breaker for note-taking
but<00:03:11.260> the<00:03:11.709> artists<00:03:12.370> didn't<00:03:12.760> care<00:03:13.030> much<00:03:13.269> for

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
but the artists didn't care much for

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:16.620 
but the artists didn't care much for
that<00:03:13.870> they<00:03:14.620> did<00:03:14.920> say<00:03:15.220> that<00:03:15.400> it<00:03:15.519> was<00:03:15.700> great<00:03:16.209> for

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
that they did say that it was great for

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:20.340 
that they did say that it was great for
quick<00:03:17.230> and<00:03:17.470> simple<00:03:17.790> storyboarding<00:03:18.790> ideas<00:03:19.480> but

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
quick and simple storyboarding ideas but

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:22.170 
quick and simple storyboarding ideas but
they<00:03:20.590> liked<00:03:20.829> being<00:03:21.130> able<00:03:21.250> to<00:03:21.489> refer<00:03:21.850> back<00:03:22.120> to

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
they liked being able to refer back to

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.500 
they liked being able to refer back to
their<00:03:22.510> ideas<00:03:23.109> so<00:03:23.739> is<00:03:24.040> this<00:03:24.400> a<00:03:24.609> pen<00:03:25.030> and<00:03:25.329> paper

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
their ideas so is this a pen and paper

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.000 
their ideas so is this a pen and paper
