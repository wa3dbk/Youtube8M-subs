00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:20.050 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.150 

that's<00:00:21.050> a<00:00:21.170> primped<00:00:21.500> in<00:00:21.620> Blanc<00:00:21.920> we're

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:22.160 
that's a primped in Blanc we're

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.070 
that's a primped in Blanc we're
specially<00:00:22.520> made<00:00:22.700> for<00:00:22.940> us<00:00:23.060> they<00:00:23.330> have<00:00:23.360> a<00:00:23.870> little

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:24.080 
specially made for us they have a little

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:25.690 
specially made for us they have a little
bit<00:00:24.230> more<00:00:24.320> flash<00:00:24.590> to<00:00:24.860> them<00:00:24.980> and<00:00:25.190> a<00:00:25.280> lot<00:00:25.310> less

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:25.700 
bit more flash to them and a lot less

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.550 
bit more flash to them and a lot less
power<00:00:26.090> and<00:00:26.420> then<00:00:26.660> we<00:00:26.780> put<00:00:26.930> a<00:00:26.960> suppressor<00:00:27.260> in

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:27.560 
power and then we put a suppressor in

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.260 
power and then we put a suppressor in
the<00:00:27.620> end<00:00:27.770> so<00:00:28.070> that<00:00:28.220> it<00:00:28.340> will<00:00:28.400> reach<00:00:29.000> a<00:00:29.210> more

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:29.270 
the end so that it will reach a more

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:31.150 
the end so that it will reach a more
each<00:00:29.540> round<00:00:29.810> but<00:00:30.230> it<00:00:30.350> gives<00:00:30.500> a<00:00:30.620> real<00:00:30.830> safe

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:31.160 
each round but it gives a real safe

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.310 
each round but it gives a real safe
range<00:00:31.460> of<00:00:31.670> fire<00:00:31.910> so<00:00:32.270> that<00:00:32.300> you<00:00:32.540> could<00:00:32.689> fire<00:00:32.960> at

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:33.320 
range of fire so that you could fire at

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:39.010

neighbors at one o'clock in the morning
with<00:02:57.650> machine-gun<00:02:57.980> fire<00:02:58.340> so<00:02:58.549> we<00:02:58.640> use<00:02:59.180> a<00:02:59.209> much

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
with machine-gun fire so we use a much

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.320 
with machine-gun fire so we use a much
more<00:02:59.569> suppressed<00:03:00.110> round<00:03:00.530> these<00:03:01.190> are<00:03:01.459> regular

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:02.330 
more suppressed round these are regular

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:03.910 
more suppressed round these are regular
brass<00:03:02.540> rounds<00:03:02.989> but<00:03:03.080> they<00:03:03.200> only<00:03:03.319> have<00:03:03.470> 1/8<00:03:03.739> of

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920

brass rounds but they only have 1/8 of
powder<00:03:04.160> round<00:03:04.489> so<00:03:04.910> that<00:03:04.940> you<00:03:05.090> can<00:03:05.209> see<00:03:05.299> a<00:03:05.330> big

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.630 
powder round so that you can see a big

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:09.340 
powder round so that you can see a big
flash<00:03:05.810> not<00:03:06.350> a<00:03:06.560> lot<00:03:06.769> of<00:03:06.799> noise<00:03:08.079> it's<00:03:09.079> not<00:03:09.260> so

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350 
flash not a lot of noise it's not so

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:10.770

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:28.630 
fly out narrow you know they're hot I
shot<00:03:27.380> him<00:03:27.590> at<00:03:27.709> one<00:03:27.829> point<00:03:27.859> but<00:03:28.310> actually<00:03:28.609> I

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 
shot him at one point but actually I

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.060 
shot him at one point but actually I
just<00:03:28.700> moved<00:03:29.390> his<00:03:29.570> hair<00:03:29.810> a<00:03:30.109> little<00:03:30.440> bit<00:03:30.620> which

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:31.070 
just moved his hair a little bit which

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:36.610 
just moved his hair a little bit which
is<00:03:31.100> probably<00:03:31.459> worse<00:03:31.790> I<00:03:34.780> had<00:03:35.780> this<00:03:36.019> beer<00:03:36.410> for

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
is probably worse I had this beer for

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.650 
is probably worse I had this beer for
the<00:03:36.709> next<00:03:37.010> movie<00:03:37.280> that<00:03:37.459> I'm<00:03:37.549> gonna<00:03:37.700> do

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:38.660 
the next movie that I'm gonna do

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:40.390 
the next movie that I'm gonna do
I<00:03:38.720> was<00:03:39.500> worried<00:03:39.740> that<00:03:39.770> the<00:03:39.920> beard<00:03:40.160> was<00:03:40.310> gonna

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
I was worried that the beard was gonna

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.040 
I was worried that the beard was gonna
keep<00:03:40.670> me<00:03:40.700> from<00:03:40.820> being<00:03:41.180> here<00:03:41.480> because<00:03:41.660> I<00:03:41.810> don't

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:42.050 
keep me from being here because I don't

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:43.810 
keep me from being here because I don't
quite<00:03:42.200> live<00:03:42.440> like<00:03:42.620> shame<00:03:42.830> but<00:03:43.040> I<00:03:43.310> think<00:03:43.730> it

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:43.820
