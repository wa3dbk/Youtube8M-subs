00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.150 
and make a video of a room tour I was
expecting<00:00:18.690> to<00:00:18.869> make<00:00:19.109> a<00:00:19.170> different<00:00:19.470> video<00:00:19.619> next

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
expecting to make a different video next

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.790 
expecting to make a different video next
it<00:00:21.060> was<00:00:21.210> going<00:00:21.330> to<00:00:21.390> be<00:00:21.480> my<00:00:21.510> lip<00:00:21.779> collection<00:00:22.289> but

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800
