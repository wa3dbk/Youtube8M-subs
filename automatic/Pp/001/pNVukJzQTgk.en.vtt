going<00:00:13.769> to<00:00:14.150> import<00:00:15.150> a<00:00:15.450> texture<00:00:15.900> so<00:00:16.500> you<00:00:16.560> need<00:00:16.830> to

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
going to import a texture so you need to

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.560 
going to import a texture so you need to
go<00:00:17.039> on<00:00:17.100> the<00:00:17.160> internet<00:00:17.340> and<00:00:17.550> get<00:00:18.029> a<00:00:18.060> texture<00:00:18.420> of

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
go on the internet and get a texture of

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.620 
go on the internet and get a texture of
a<00:00:18.660> bottle<00:00:18.990> so<00:00:19.859> I'm<00:00:20.189> going<00:00:20.369> to<00:00:20.400> create<00:00:20.850> a<00:00:21.180> new

a bottle so I'm going to create a new

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:22.300 
a bottle so I'm going to create a new
material

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:22.310 
material

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.759

we've done that we need to have a
surface<00:00:50.460> to<00:00:50.640> apply<00:00:50.879> this<00:00:50.940> to<00:00:51.239> so<00:00:51.449> I<00:00:51.510> create<00:00:52.020> a

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
surface to apply this to so I create a

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.939 
surface to apply this to so I create a
cube<00:00:53.210> now<00:00:54.210> that<00:00:54.360> we've<00:00:54.449> created<00:00:54.600> our<00:00:54.899> cube<00:00:55.260> I'm

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
cube now that we've created our cube I'm

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.170 
cube now that we've created our cube I'm
just<00:00:56.100> going<00:00:56.219> to<00:00:56.250> go<00:00:56.399> down<00:00:56.550> to<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:56.850> front<00:00:57.120> view

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
image you can see that actually tells me

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.399 
image you can see that actually tells me
the<00:01:08.100> resolution<00:01:08.700> of<00:01:08.850> this<00:01:09.600> picture<00:01:09.990> so<00:01:10.140> I<00:01:10.170> need

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
the resolution of this picture so I need

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.850 
the resolution of this picture so I need
to<00:01:10.530> adjust<00:01:10.820> the<00:01:11.820> cube<00:01:12.330> to<00:01:13.020> fit<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.320> picture<00:01:13.470> so

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
to adjust the cube to fit the picture so

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.460 
to adjust the cube to fit the picture so
we've<00:01:14.010> got<00:01:14.130> a<00:01:14.159> resolution<00:01:14.460> of<00:01:14.700> 800<00:01:15.330> by<00:01:15.600> 1<00:01:15.869> 8<00:01:16.110> 3<00:01:16.140> 1

we've got a resolution of 800 by 1 8 3 1
it's<00:01:17.340> now<00:01:17.520> going<00:01:17.700> to<00:01:17.790> highlight<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.180> cube<00:01:18.680> i'm

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
it's now going to highlight the cube i'm

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.999 
it's now going to highlight the cube i'm
going<00:01:19.890> to<00:01:19.979> select<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.990> z22<00:01:21.990> because<00:01:22.680> we<00:01:22.830> don't

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
going to select the z22 because we don't

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.280 
going to select the z22 because we don't
let<00:01:23.460> refine<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:23.939> change<00:01:24.119> it<00:01:24.240> to<00:01:24.330> 1<00:01:24.600> because<00:01:24.960> we

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
let refine and change it to 1 because we

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.320 
let refine and change it to 1 because we
don't<00:01:25.470> need<00:01:25.560> to<00:01:25.710> be<00:01:25.799> very<00:01:25.860> thick<00:01:26.250> and<00:01:26.460> then<00:01:27.240> the

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
don't need to be very thick and then the

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.670 
don't need to be very thick and then the
properties<00:01:27.720> will<00:01:27.960> just<00:01:28.080> click<00:01:28.229> on<00:01:28.350> this<00:01:28.470> again

one<00:01:35.009> eight<00:01:35.340> three<00:01:35.909> one<00:01:37.070> okay<00:01:38.070> and<00:01:38.340> now<00:01:38.670> we've

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
one eight three one okay and now we've

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.789 
one eight three one okay and now we've
done<00:01:38.939> that<00:01:39.119> we<00:01:39.390> can<00:01:39.420> just<00:01:39.659> click<00:01:39.840> off<00:01:39.960> here<00:01:40.259> and

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
done that we can just click off here and

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.039 
done that we can just click off here and
if<00:01:41.040> i<00:01:41.159> zoom<00:01:41.189> out<00:01:41.640> you<00:01:42.360> can<00:01:42.540> see<00:01:42.689> that<00:01:42.840> we<00:01:42.930> now

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
if i zoom out you can see that we now

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.660 
if i zoom out you can see that we now
have<00:01:43.080> a<00:01:43.290> square<00:01:43.799> which<00:01:44.310> is<00:01:44.340> going<00:01:44.520> to<00:01:44.580> be

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
have a square which is going to be

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.429 
have a square which is going to be
exactly<00:01:44.970> the<00:01:45.149> same<00:01:45.180> size<00:01:45.509> of<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:45.840> texture<00:01:46.259> so

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
exactly the same size of the texture so

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.200 
exactly the same size of the texture so
I'm<00:01:46.890> going<00:01:47.040> to<00:01:47.070> go<00:01:47.189> ahead<00:01:47.310> and<00:01:47.670> drop<00:01:47.939> that<00:01:47.970> onto

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
I'm going to go ahead and drop that onto

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.180 
I'm going to go ahead and drop that onto
the<00:01:48.390> cube<00:01:48.689> now<00:01:49.560> you<00:01:49.619> can<00:01:49.799> see<00:01:49.950> at<00:01:50.009> the<00:01:50.100> moment

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:50.190 
the cube now you can see at the moment

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:51.680 
the cube now you can see at the moment
we<00:01:50.430> can't<00:01:50.640> see<00:01:50.789> the<00:01:50.909> texture<00:01:51.299> that's<00:01:51.479> been

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:51.690 
we can't see the texture that's been

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:53.749 
we can't see the texture that's been
applied<00:01:51.899> to<00:01:52.289> the<00:01:52.470> cube<00:01:52.740> so<00:01:53.399> what<00:01:53.549> we<00:01:53.610> need<00:01:53.729> to

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
applied to the cube so what we need to

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.130 
applied to the cube so what we need to
do<00:01:53.909> is<00:01:54.000> need<00:01:54.149> to<00:01:54.240> go<00:01:54.330> to<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.539> display<00:01:54.810> and

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
do is need to go to the display and

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.490 
do is need to go to the display and
change<00:01:55.770> this<00:01:55.950> to<00:01:56.250> lines<00:01:57.470> Gouraud<00:01:58.470> shading

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
change this to lines Gouraud shading

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.550 
change this to lines Gouraud shading
lines<00:01:59.189> and<00:01:59.659> straight<00:02:00.659> away<00:02:00.869> you<00:02:00.930> can<00:02:01.049> see<00:02:01.200> that

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
lines and straight away you can see that

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.690 
lines and straight away you can see that
we<00:02:01.799> have<00:02:02.009> our<00:02:02.960> texture<00:02:04.369> so<00:02:05.369> now<00:02:05.490> that<00:02:05.580> we've

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
we have our texture so now that we've

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:06.770 
we have our texture so now that we've
got<00:02:05.789> our<00:02:05.880> texture<00:02:06.270> I'm<00:02:06.330> going<00:02:06.539> to<00:02:06.600> get<00:02:06.690> the

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
got our texture I'm going to get the

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.859 
got our texture I'm going to get the
cube<00:02:07.080> and<00:02:07.470> I'm<00:02:07.920> just<00:02:08.069> going<00:02:08.280> to<00:02:08.340> Center<00:02:08.869> the

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
cube and I'm just going to Center the

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.470 
cube and I'm just going to Center the
cube<00:02:10.289> or<00:02:11.280> the<00:02:11.580> texture<00:02:12.030> I<00:02:12.090> should<00:02:12.299> say

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
cube or the texture I should say

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.870 
cube or the texture I should say
actually<00:02:12.780> onto<00:02:13.019> the<00:02:13.680> center<00:02:14.040> line<00:02:14.220> so<00:02:14.819> I'm

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
actually onto the center line so I'm

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.670 
actually onto the center line so I'm
just<00:02:14.970> going<00:02:15.120> to<00:02:15.150> move<00:02:15.330> the<00:02:15.510> bottle<00:02:15.810> over<00:02:16.110> until

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
just going to move the bottle over until

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.030 
just going to move the bottle over until
it<00:02:16.799> roughly<00:02:17.250> is<00:02:17.610> in<00:02:17.970> the<00:02:18.120> center<00:02:18.709> that's<00:02:19.709> about

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
it roughly is in the center that's about

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.789 
it roughly is in the center that's about
right<00:02:20.360> okay<00:02:21.360> so<00:02:21.989> now<00:02:22.110> we've<00:02:22.260> got<00:02:22.380> our<00:02:22.410> bottle

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:22.799 
right okay so now we've got our bottle

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:24.199 
right okay so now we've got our bottle
and<00:02:22.980> what<00:02:23.459> we're<00:02:23.580> going<00:02:23.700> to<00:02:23.730> do<00:02:23.819> now<00:02:23.970> is<00:02:24.090> we're

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
and what we're going to do now is we're

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:27.970 
and what we're going to do now is we're
going<00:02:24.299> to<00:02:24.360> trace<00:02:24.810> this<00:02:25.200> bottle<00:02:25.620> so<00:02:25.769> to<00:02:26.549> do<00:02:26.790> that

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
going to trace this bottle so to do that

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.170 
going to trace this bottle so to do that
I'm<00:02:28.980> just<00:02:29.069> going<00:02:29.250> to<00:02:29.280> go<00:02:29.400> to<00:02:29.430> the<00:02:29.640> top<00:02:29.819> here<00:02:30.030> and

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
I'm just going to go to the top here and

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.140 
I'm just going to go to the top here and
I'm<00:02:30.750> going<00:02:30.900> to<00:02:31.019> select<00:02:31.319> from<00:02:31.620> this<00:02:31.799> list<00:02:32.150> here

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
I'm going to select from this list here

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.990 
I'm going to select from this list here
I'm<00:02:33.390> going<00:02:33.569> to<00:02:33.690> select<00:02:33.840> a<00:02:34.200> key<00:02:34.500> map<00:02:34.880> so<00:02:35.880> now

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
I'm going to select a key map so now

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.460 
I'm going to select a key map so now
that<00:02:36.060> I've<00:02:36.209> got<00:02:36.299> the<00:02:36.420> akima<00:02:36.780> selected<00:02:37.230> I'm

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
that I've got the akima selected I'm

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.220 
that I've got the akima selected I'm
going<00:02:37.530> to<00:02:37.739> start<00:02:38.299> doing<00:02:39.299> my<00:02:39.540> bottle<00:02:39.900> now<00:02:40.170> we

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
going to start doing my bottle now we

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:41.780 
going to start doing my bottle now we
don't<00:02:40.709> need<00:02:40.829> to<00:02:40.950> do<00:02:41.010> all<00:02:41.100> the<00:02:41.250> bottle<00:02:41.519> we<00:02:41.670> only

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
don't need to do all the bottle we only

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.400 
don't need to do all the bottle we only
need<00:02:41.970> to<00:02:42.060> do<00:02:42.150> half<00:02:42.480> of<00:02:42.690> the<00:02:42.810> bottle<00:02:43.109> because

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
need to do half of the bottle because

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.289 
need to do half of the bottle because
obviously<00:02:43.590> we're<00:02:43.950> going<00:02:44.100> to<00:02:44.250> lathe<00:02:44.820> it<00:02:45.090> later

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:45.299 
obviously we're going to lathe it later

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:46.699 
obviously we're going to lathe it later
on<00:02:45.600> so<00:02:45.810> we<00:02:45.930> don't<00:02:45.959> need<00:02:46.109> to<00:02:46.230> do<00:02:46.290> that<00:02:46.320> so<00:02:46.620> I'm

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
on so we don't need to do that so I'm

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:48.259 
on so we don't need to do that so I'm
going<00:02:46.859> to<00:02:46.950> go<00:02:47.070> ahead<00:02:47.190> I'm<00:02:47.340> going<00:02:47.609> to<00:02:47.670> ignore

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
going to go ahead I'm going to ignore

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:50.720 
going to go ahead I'm going to ignore
the<00:02:48.480> lime<00:02:48.870> I'm<00:02:49.709> going<00:02:49.859> to<00:02:49.920> put<00:02:50.010> my<00:02:50.130> first<00:02:50.370> one

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
the lime I'm going to put my first one

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.470 
the lime I'm going to put my first one
here<00:02:51.209> next<00:02:52.079> one<00:02:52.700> next<00:02:53.700> one<00:02:53.880> I'm<00:02:54.090> going<00:02:54.269> to<00:02:54.390> do

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
here next one next one I'm going to do

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.660 
here next one next one I'm going to do
this<00:02:54.600> all<00:02:54.810> the<00:02:54.900> way<00:02:54.989> around<00:02:55.230> the<00:02:55.320> bottle

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.550 

essentially<00:02:59.670> until<00:03:00.090> we've<00:03:01.079> done<00:03:01.290> half<00:03:01.530> the

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
essentially until we've done half the

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.440 
essentially until we've done half the
bottle<00:03:01.890> now<00:03:02.609> you<00:03:02.670> might<00:03:02.940> be<00:03:03.030> able<00:03:03.120> to<00:03:03.209> do<00:03:03.329> this

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
bottle now you might be able to do this

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.509 
bottle now you might be able to do this
better<00:03:03.630> than<00:03:03.780> me<00:03:04.019> I'm<00:03:04.140> just<00:03:04.290> doing<00:03:04.380> it<00:03:04.769> very

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
better than me I'm just doing it very

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:10.740 
better than me I'm just doing it very
quick<00:03:05.880> for<00:03:06.060> the<00:03:06.150> sake<00:03:06.359> of<00:03:06.390> this<00:03:06.600> tutorial

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.360 

following<00:03:11.470> the<00:03:11.560> line<00:03:11.740> all<00:03:11.950> the<00:03:12.010> way<00:03:12.040> down<00:03:12.130> the

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
following the line all the way down the

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:18.180 
following the line all the way down the
bottle<00:03:16.230> can<00:03:17.230> spread<00:03:17.470> these<00:03:17.620> out<00:03:17.800> a<00:03:17.860> little<00:03:17.950> bit

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:18.190 
bottle can spread these out a little bit

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.250 
bottle can spread these out a little bit
further<00:03:18.430> on<00:03:18.550> this<00:03:18.730> street<00:03:19.000> edge

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:27.770 

it<00:03:22.739> starts<00:03:23.099> to<00:03:23.189> taper<00:03:23.400> in<00:03:26.180> and<00:03:27.180> then<00:03:27.510> to<00:03:27.659> the

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
it starts to taper in and then to the

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.199 
it starts to taper in and then to the
center<00:03:28.140> okay<00:03:28.650> so<00:03:28.920> now<00:03:29.040> we've<00:03:29.189> done<00:03:29.220> that<00:03:29.549> what

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
center okay so now we've done that what

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:31.819 
center okay so now we've done that what
we<00:03:30.299> can<00:03:30.450> actually<00:03:30.689> do<00:03:30.840> is<00:03:31.110> I<00:03:31.140> can<00:03:31.470> actually<00:03:31.530> get

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:31.829 
we can actually do is I can actually get

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:33.589 
we can actually do is I can actually get
rid<00:03:31.980> of<00:03:32.040> the<00:03:32.370> cube<00:03:32.670> and<00:03:32.819> the<00:03:32.879> texture<00:03:33.269> so<00:03:33.390> I<00:03:33.450> can

00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:33.599 
rid of the cube and the texture so I can

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:35.660 
rid of the cube and the texture so I can
highlight<00:03:33.810> the<00:03:34.019> cube<00:03:34.260> press<00:03:35.129> delete<00:03:35.400> and<00:03:35.640> you

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
highlight the cube press delete and you

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.520 
highlight the cube press delete and you
can<00:03:36.180> see<00:03:36.329> that<00:03:36.480> on<00:03:36.569> this<00:03:36.720> screen<00:03:36.930> now<00:03:37.049> we<00:03:37.230> have

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
can see that on this screen now we have

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.759 
can see that on this screen now we have
half<00:03:37.860> of<00:03:38.129> a<00:03:38.280> bottle<00:03:38.569> traced<00:03:39.569> so<00:03:40.470> what<00:03:40.650> we're

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
half of a bottle traced so what we're

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:42.199 
half of a bottle traced so what we're
going<00:03:40.890> to<00:03:40.920> do<00:03:41.040> is<00:03:41.190> with<00:03:41.340> the<00:03:41.459> spline<00:03:41.730> selected

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
going to do is with the spline selected

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:43.970 
going to do is with the spline selected
I'm<00:03:42.480> going<00:03:42.720> to<00:03:42.780> go<00:03:42.900> up<00:03:42.989> to<00:03:43.110> the<00:03:43.230> hypernurbs

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
I'm going to go up to the hypernurbs

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.420 
I'm going to go up to the hypernurbs
here<00:03:44.220> and<00:03:44.519> I'm<00:03:44.670> going<00:03:44.819> to<00:03:44.940> select<00:03:45.120> lathe<00:03:45.690> NURBS

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
here and I'm going to select lathe NURBS

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.589 
here and I'm going to select lathe NURBS
now<00:03:47.430> you<00:03:47.489> can<00:03:47.640> see<00:03:47.760> the<00:03:47.879> lathe<00:03:48.060> NURBS<00:03:48.420> has

00:03:48.589 --> 00:03:48.599 
now you can see the lathe NURBS has

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:51.140 
now you can see the lathe NURBS has
appeared<00:03:48.959> in<00:03:49.109> this<00:03:49.470> list<00:03:49.739> and<00:03:49.980> now<00:03:50.970> I'm<00:03:51.030> going

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
appeared in this list and now I'm going

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:52.640 
appeared in this list and now I'm going
to<00:03:51.239> select<00:03:51.390> the<00:03:51.599> spline<00:03:51.810> and<00:03:52.230> I'm<00:03:52.409> going<00:03:52.560> to

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
to select the spline and I'm going to

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.770 
to select the spline and I'm going to
drag<00:03:52.890> this<00:03:53.159> until<00:03:53.670> the<00:03:53.790> arrow<00:03:53.970> points<00:03:54.480> down

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
drag this until the arrow points down

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.270 
drag this until the arrow points down
that<00:03:55.019> means<00:03:55.109> we're<00:03:55.290> dropping<00:03:55.470> it<00:03:55.709> into<00:03:56.040> the

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
that means we're dropping it into the

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.729 
that means we're dropping it into the
lathe<00:03:56.489> NURBS<00:03:56.819> and<00:03:57.409> straight<00:03:58.409> away<00:03:58.590> you<00:03:58.650> can

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:58.739 
lathe NURBS and straight away you can

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:01.280 
lathe NURBS and straight away you can
see<00:03:58.859> we<00:03:59.129> have<00:03:59.220> now<00:03:59.340> created<00:03:59.849> a<00:04:00.030> bottle<00:04:00.480> and<00:04:01.230> if

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
see we have now created a bottle and if

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.710 
see we have now created a bottle and if
we<00:04:01.409> go<00:04:01.500> back<00:04:01.709> to<00:04:01.859> our<00:04:01.950> 3-dimensional<00:04:02.700> view<00:04:02.970> and

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
we go back to our 3-dimensional view and

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.379 
we go back to our 3-dimensional view and
just<00:04:03.930> zoom<00:04:04.109> out<00:04:04.319> here<00:04:04.879> you<00:04:05.879> can<00:04:06.060> see<00:04:06.239> that

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:06.389 
just zoom out here you can see that

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:08.089 
just zoom out here you can see that
we've<00:04:06.540> created<00:04:06.780> a<00:04:06.989> bottle<00:04:07.290> very<00:04:07.560> very<00:04:07.799> quickly

00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:08.099 
we've created a bottle very very quickly

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:11.539 
we've created a bottle very very quickly
and<00:04:08.340> very<00:04:08.549> very<00:04:08.790> easily<00:04:09.560> now<00:04:10.560> the<00:04:11.099> first<00:04:11.340> thing

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:11.549 
and very very easily now the first thing

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:13.009 
and very very easily now the first thing
that<00:04:11.700> you'll<00:04:11.819> notice<00:04:12.000> I<00:04:12.450> want<00:04:12.599> me<00:04:12.659> to<00:04:12.780> go<00:04:12.870> back

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:13.019 
that you'll notice I want me to go back

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:16.039 
that you'll notice I want me to go back
into<00:04:13.170> this<00:04:13.319> view<00:04:13.500> again<00:04:13.739> is<00:04:14.359> the<00:04:15.359> top<00:04:15.629> of<00:04:15.840> the

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
into this view again is the top of the

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:20.360 
into this view again is the top of the
bottle<00:04:17.120> first<00:04:18.120> of<00:04:18.299> all<00:04:18.449> is<00:04:19.010> it's<00:04:20.010> kind<00:04:20.220> of<00:04:20.250> a

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.370 
bottle first of all is it's kind of a

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:21.920 
bottle first of all is it's kind of a
dome<00:04:20.669> at<00:04:20.880> the<00:04:20.940> top<00:04:21.150> and<00:04:21.299> we<00:04:21.359> don't<00:04:21.539> want<00:04:21.690> it<00:04:21.810> to

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
dome at the top and we don't want it to

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:23.840 
dome at the top and we don't want it to
be<00:04:21.989> domed<00:04:22.260> we<00:04:22.410> want<00:04:22.560> it<00:04:22.680> to<00:04:22.770> be<00:04:22.860> flat<00:04:23.010> and<00:04:23.699> that

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:23.850 
be domed we want it to be flat and that

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:25.250 
be domed we want it to be flat and that
probably<00:04:24.180> applies<00:04:24.510> at<00:04:24.690> the<00:04:24.750> bottom<00:04:25.080> as<00:04:25.229> well

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
probably applies at the bottom as well

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.379 
probably applies at the bottom as well
there's<00:04:25.740> a<00:04:25.770> slight<00:04:26.010> dome<00:04:26.729> at<00:04:26.910> the<00:04:27.000> bottom<00:04:27.300> of

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:27.389 
there's a slight dome at the bottom of

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:29.570 
there's a slight dome at the bottom of
the<00:04:27.479> bottle<00:04:27.750> so<00:04:27.930> let's<00:04:28.080> go<00:04:28.199> ahead<00:04:28.440> and<00:04:28.740> deal

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
the bottle so let's go ahead and deal

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:30.580 
the bottle so let's go ahead and deal
with<00:04:29.610> that<00:04:29.970> first

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:30.590 
with that first

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:33.589 
with that first
so<00:04:31.590> with<00:04:31.949> the<00:04:32.099> selection<00:04:32.910> tool<00:04:33.090> selection

00:04:33.589 --> 00:04:33.599 
so with the selection tool selection

00:04:33.599 --> 00:04:35.270 
so with the selection tool selection
that<00:04:34.050> I<00:04:34.110> selected<00:04:34.500> I'm<00:04:34.680> going<00:04:34.740> to<00:04:34.860> select<00:04:35.070> the

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
that I selected I'm going to select the

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.430 
that I selected I'm going to select the
bottom<00:04:35.460> I'm<00:04:36.449> just<00:04:36.780> going<00:04:36.900> to<00:04:36.930> use<00:04:37.080> the<00:04:37.260> arrow

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 
bottom I'm just going to use the arrow

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.890 
bottom I'm just going to use the arrow
here<00:04:37.800> and<00:04:38.610> pull<00:04:38.910> this<00:04:39.060> up<00:04:39.120> so<00:04:39.539> now<00:04:39.660> we've<00:04:39.780> got<00:04:39.870> a

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900 
here and pull this up so now we've got a

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:42.920 
here and pull this up so now we've got a
nice<00:04:40.110> flat<00:04:40.650> bottom<00:04:41.039> and<00:04:41.599> I'm<00:04:42.599> gonna<00:04:42.750> do<00:04:42.810> the

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:42.930 
nice flat bottom and I'm gonna do the

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:44.210 
nice flat bottom and I'm gonna do the
same<00:04:43.080> again<00:04:43.380> with<00:04:43.530> the<00:04:43.620> top<00:04:43.830> we're<00:04:44.010> going<00:04:44.130> to

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:44.220 
same again with the top we're going to

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:46.460 
same again with the top we're going to
select<00:04:44.370> this<00:04:44.669> one<00:04:44.960> I'm<00:04:45.960> going<00:04:46.110> to<00:04:46.169> move<00:04:46.320> it

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470 
select this one I'm going to move it

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:49.430 
select this one I'm going to move it
down<00:04:46.500> so<00:04:47.340> now<00:04:47.430> we've<00:04:47.550> got<00:04:47.669> a<00:04:47.910> flat<00:04:48.360> top<00:04:48.660> now<00:04:49.349> the

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440 
down so now we've got a flat top now the

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:51.379 
down so now we've got a flat top now the
other<00:04:49.620> issue<00:04:49.800> that<00:04:49.949> we've<00:04:50.220> got<00:04:50.430> is<00:04:51.000> if<00:04:51.180> we<00:04:51.270> go

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:51.389 
other issue that we've got is if we go

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:53.029 
other issue that we've got is if we go
back<00:04:51.539> into<00:04:51.720> the<00:04:51.810> 3-dimensional<00:04:52.560> view<00:04:52.710> here

00:04:53.029 --> 00:04:53.039 
back into the 3-dimensional view here

00:04:53.039 --> 00:04:55.969 
back into the 3-dimensional view here
and<00:04:53.220> go<00:04:53.430> to<00:04:53.490> the<00:04:53.639> top<00:04:54.440> we've<00:04:55.440> kind<00:04:55.650> of<00:04:55.710> got<00:04:55.860> this

00:04:55.969 --> 00:04:55.979 
and go to the top we've kind of got this

00:04:55.979 --> 00:04:59.330 
and go to the top we've kind of got this
weird<00:04:56.870> artifacting<00:04:57.870> going<00:04:58.199> on<00:04:58.320> at<00:04:58.979> the<00:04:59.099> top

00:04:59.330 --> 00:04:59.340 
weird artifacting going on at the top

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.279 
weird artifacting going on at the top
now<00:05:00.000> the<00:05:00.060> reason<00:05:00.419> for<00:05:00.449> that<00:05:00.570> is<00:05:00.810> because<00:05:01.110> this

00:05:01.279 --> 00:05:01.289 
now the reason for that is because this

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:04.100 
now the reason for that is because this
particular<00:05:02.150> part<00:05:03.150> of<00:05:03.210> the<00:05:03.330> spline<00:05:03.630> here<00:05:03.900> is

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.110 
particular part of the spline here is

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:06.500 
particular part of the spline here is
gone<00:05:04.979> over<00:05:05.340> the<00:05:05.460> center<00:05:05.789> line<00:05:05.970> so<00:05:06.270> what<00:05:06.419> we're

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:06.510 
gone over the center line so what we're

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:08.000 
gone over the center line so what we're
actually<00:05:06.599> going<00:05:06.840> to<00:05:06.900> do<00:05:07.050> is<00:05:07.199> it's<00:05:07.860> going<00:05:07.889> to

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:08.010 
actually going to do is it's going to

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:09.680 
actually going to do is it's going to
make<00:05:08.099> sure<00:05:08.250> that<00:05:08.370> this<00:05:08.639> is<00:05:08.789> selected<00:05:09.090> just

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:09.690 
make sure that this is selected just

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:11.330 
make sure that this is selected just
that<00:05:09.870> one<00:05:10.050> okay<00:05:10.409> and<00:05:10.440> if<00:05:10.770> we<00:05:10.860> move<00:05:11.010> this<00:05:11.130> out

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:11.340 
that one okay and if we move this out

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:15.200 
that one okay and if we move this out
you<00:05:12.180> see<00:05:12.330> we<00:05:12.449> get<00:05:12.539> a<00:05:12.599> whole<00:05:13.789> so<00:05:14.789> for<00:05:14.820> the

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:15.210 
you see we get a whole so for the

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:16.339 
you see we get a whole so for the
purposes<00:05:15.599> of<00:05:15.659> this<00:05:15.810> we<00:05:15.960> can<00:05:16.050> either<00:05:16.199> leave<00:05:16.320> it

00:05:16.339 --> 00:05:16.349 
purposes of this we can either leave it

00:05:16.349 --> 00:05:20.800 
purposes of this we can either leave it
as<00:05:16.500> a<00:05:16.530> whole<00:05:16.770> or<00:05:18.560> we<00:05:19.560> can<00:05:19.740> just<00:05:19.979> make<00:05:20.370> it

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:20.810 
as a whole or we can just make it

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:22.600 
as a whole or we can just make it
like<00:05:21.470> that<00:05:21.650> if<00:05:21.800> you<00:05:21.920> go<00:05:22.040> over<00:05:22.340> then<00:05:22.460> obviously

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:22.610 
like that if you go over then obviously

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:24.640 
like that if you go over then obviously
that's<00:05:22.820> when<00:05:23.000> you<00:05:23.060> get<00:05:23.180> this<00:05:23.240> artifacting<00:05:23.930> so

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:24.650 
that's when you get this artifacting so

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:27.129 
that's when you get this artifacting so
let's<00:05:25.490> just<00:05:25.670> leave<00:05:25.790> it<00:05:25.850> let's<00:05:26.690> make<00:05:26.840> it<00:05:26.870> whole

00:05:27.129 --> 00:05:27.139 
let's just leave it let's make it whole

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:30.790 
let's just leave it let's make it whole
is<00:05:27.320> a<00:05:27.350> bit<00:05:27.470> more<00:05:27.590> like<00:05:27.710> the<00:05:27.860> bottle<00:05:28.690> okay<00:05:29.800> so

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:30.800 
is a bit more like the bottle okay so

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.659 
is a bit more like the bottle okay so
now<00:05:30.919> we<00:05:30.980> have<00:05:31.040> our<00:05:31.280> bottle<00:05:31.580> done<00:05:32.210> pretty<00:05:32.750> much

00:05:33.659 --> 00:05:33.669 
now we have our bottle done pretty much

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:36.040 
now we have our bottle done pretty much
so<00:05:34.669> once<00:05:35.030> you've<00:05:35.210> done<00:05:35.360> this<00:05:35.570> you<00:05:35.780> can<00:05:35.930> go

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:36.050 
so once you've done this you can go

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:39.190 
so once you've done this you can go
ahead<00:05:36.169> in<00:05:36.500> and<00:05:36.530> the<00:05:36.770> best<00:05:36.950> way<00:05:37.070> to<00:05:38.020> fix<00:05:39.020> any

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:39.200 
ahead in and the best way to fix any

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:40.690 
ahead in and the best way to fix any
mistakes<00:05:39.650> is<00:05:39.860> actually<00:05:40.130> to<00:05:40.250> do<00:05:40.340> it<00:05:40.430> from<00:05:40.520> this

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:40.700 
mistakes is actually to do it from this

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:42.879 
mistakes is actually to do it from this
this<00:05:41.240> one<00:05:41.480> here<00:05:41.720> make<00:05:41.930> sure<00:05:42.080> you<00:05:42.200> spline

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:42.889 
this one here make sure you spline

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:44.320 
this one here make sure you spline
select<00:05:43.310> it<00:05:43.430> and<00:05:43.550> you<00:05:43.610> can<00:05:43.730> see<00:05:43.880> the<00:05:44.000> spline

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:44.330 
select it and you can see the spline

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:46.000 
select it and you can see the spline
down<00:05:45.020> the<00:05:45.169> side<00:05:45.380> of<00:05:45.410> the<00:05:45.560> bottle

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:46.010 
down the side of the bottle

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:49.360 
down the side of the bottle
and<00:05:46.100> then<00:05:46.700> by<00:05:46.820> selecting<00:05:47.389> any<00:05:47.510> of<00:05:47.630> these<00:05:48.370> you

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:49.370 
and then by selecting any of these you

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:50.800 
and then by selecting any of these you
can<00:05:49.610> see<00:05:49.700> there's<00:05:49.850> a<00:05:49.880> point<00:05:50.120> now<00:05:50.240> by<00:05:50.419> selecting

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:50.810 
can see there's a point now by selecting

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:52.060 
can see there's a point now by selecting
any<00:05:50.900> of<00:05:50.960> these<00:05:51.080> we<00:05:51.290> can<00:05:51.320> alter<00:05:51.650> the<00:05:51.770> shape<00:05:51.919> of

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:52.070 
any of these we can alter the shape of

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:54.280 
any of these we can alter the shape of
the<00:05:52.190> bottle<00:05:52.720> we<00:05:53.720> can<00:05:53.870> do<00:05:53.960> it<00:05:54.020> your<00:05:54.080> ones

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:54.290 
the bottle we can do it your ones

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:57.280 
the bottle we can do it your ones
goodbye<00:05:54.919> so<00:05:55.550> now<00:05:55.730> that<00:05:55.790> we've<00:05:56.000> done<00:05:56.150> that<00:05:56.210> as<00:05:56.570> a

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:03.340 
very final thing let's just have a look
at<00:05:59.450> texturing<00:06:00.440> the<00:06:00.950> bottle<00:06:01.900> so<00:06:02.900> to<00:06:02.960> do<00:06:03.320> that

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:03.350 
at texturing the bottle so to do that

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:04.810 
at texturing the bottle so to do that
I'm<00:06:03.620> going<00:06:03.710> to<00:06:03.770> go<00:06:03.890> down<00:06:04.040> to<00:06:04.160> the<00:06:04.250> create<00:06:04.580> at

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:04.820 
I'm going to go down to the create at

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:07.600 
I'm going to go down to the create at
the<00:06:04.910> bottom<00:06:05.260> load<00:06:06.260> material<00:06:06.500> preset<00:06:07.370> I'm

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:07.610 
the bottom load material preset I'm

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:09.490 
the bottom load material preset I'm
going<00:06:07.850> to<00:06:07.910> go<00:06:08.000> down<00:06:08.120> to<00:06:08.270> visualize<00:06:08.720> materials

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:09.500 
going to go down to visualize materials

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:12.190 
going to go down to visualize materials
and<00:06:09.710> liquid<00:06:10.430> and<00:06:10.669> then<00:06:11.450> from<00:06:11.690> the<00:06:11.810> liquid

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:12.200 
and liquid and then from the liquid

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:15.880 
and liquid and then from the liquid
let's<00:06:12.590> select<00:06:12.970> T<00:06:14.320> so<00:06:15.320> now<00:06:15.350> that<00:06:15.620> we've<00:06:15.740> got

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:15.890 
let's select T so now that we've got

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:17.380 
let's select T so now that we've got
this<00:06:16.010> liquid<00:06:16.400> I'm<00:06:16.610> going<00:06:16.820> to<00:06:16.880> double<00:06:17.120> click<00:06:17.210> on

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:17.390 
this liquid I'm going to double click on

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:19.750 
this liquid I'm going to double click on
it<00:06:17.570> we've<00:06:18.500> got<00:06:18.620> the<00:06:18.740> color<00:06:19.010> we've<00:06:19.550> got<00:06:19.669> all

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:19.760 
it we've got the color we've got all

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:21.100 
it we've got the color we've got all
these<00:06:19.850> different<00:06:20.150> options<00:06:20.300> down<00:06:20.690> here<00:06:20.960> where

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:21.110 
these different options down here where

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:24.129 
these different options down here where
we<00:06:21.200> can<00:06:21.290> change<00:06:21.530> the<00:06:21.740> color<00:06:21.979> of<00:06:22.630> the<00:06:23.630> liquid<00:06:23.780> so

00:06:24.129 --> 00:06:24.139 
we can change the color of the liquid so

00:06:24.139 --> 00:06:26.230 
we can change the color of the liquid so
let's<00:06:24.830> just<00:06:24.979> go<00:06:25.070> to<00:06:25.130> the<00:06:25.280> transparency<00:06:25.880> let's

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:26.240 
let's just go to the transparency let's

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:29.740 
let's just go to the transparency let's
just<00:06:26.479> change<00:06:26.720> this<00:06:27.020> to<00:06:27.260> around<00:06:28.750> something

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:29.750 
just change this to around something

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:35.170 
just change this to around something
like<00:06:29.960> that<00:06:30.380> and<00:06:31.990> flexions<00:06:32.990> okay<00:06:33.910> okay<00:06:34.910> that'll

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:35.180 
like that and flexions okay okay that'll

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:36.520 
like that and flexions okay okay that'll
do<00:06:35.300> so<00:06:35.720> now<00:06:35.840> that<00:06:35.930> we've<00:06:36.050> done<00:06:36.140> that<00:06:36.200> all<00:06:36.440> we

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:36.530 
do so now that we've done that all we

do so now that we've done that all we
need<00:06:36.650> to<00:06:36.680> do<00:06:36.830> is<00:06:36.950> simply<00:06:37.220> drag<00:06:37.400> and<00:06:37.520> drop<00:06:37.580> this

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:37.820 
need to do is simply drag and drop this

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:43.300 
need to do is simply drag and drop this
onto<00:06:38.000> our<00:06:38.120> bottle<00:06:38.979> we'll<00:06:39.979> add<00:06:40.190> a<00:06:40.220> floor<00:06:42.310> again

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:43.310 
onto our bottle we'll add a floor again

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:45.430 
onto our bottle we'll add a floor again
we'll<00:06:43.460> just<00:06:43.490> go<00:06:43.700> down<00:06:43.729> to<00:06:44.120> just<00:06:45.110> use<00:06:45.289> this

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:45.440 
we'll just go down to just use this

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:47.110 
we'll just go down to just use this
window<00:06:45.770> here<00:06:45.950> so<00:06:46.130> we<00:06:46.220> can<00:06:46.370> line<00:06:46.580> the<00:06:46.729> floor<00:06:46.880> up

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:47.120 
window here so we can line the floor up

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:50.090 
window here so we can line the floor up
properly

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:50.100 

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:53.840 

okay<00:06:50.910> floor<00:06:51.150> selected<00:06:52.220> okay<00:06:53.220> so<00:06:53.490> now<00:06:53.760> we'll

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:53.850 
okay floor selected okay so now we'll

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:55.940 
okay floor selected okay so now we'll
just<00:06:53.910> do<00:06:54.180> a<00:06:54.210> very<00:06:54.420> quick<00:06:54.720> render<00:06:55.200> render

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:55.950 
just do a very quick render render

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:59.240 
just do a very quick render render
render<00:06:56.400> view<00:06:57.500> and<00:06:58.500> you<00:06:58.680> can<00:06:58.710> see<00:06:58.860> that<00:06:59.130> we've

00:06:59.240 --> 00:06:59.250 
render view and you can see that we've

materials<00:07:12.420> we<00:07:13.290> could<00:07:13.470> select<00:07:13.620> glass<00:07:13.950> because

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:14.310 
materials we could select glass because

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:17.360 
materials we could select glass because
it's<00:07:14.460> a<00:07:14.840> but<00:07:15.840> liquid<00:07:16.290> liquid<00:07:16.470> always<00:07:16.890> tends<00:07:17.130> to

it's a but liquid liquid always tends to

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:29.600 
it's a but liquid liquid always tends to
work<00:07:17.520> better<00:07:20.000> let's<00:07:21.000> go<00:07:24.230> try<00:07:25.230> materials

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:29.610 

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:31.790 

let's<00:07:30.210> just<00:07:30.330> use<00:07:30.479> a<00:07:30.509> glass<00:07:30.780> for<00:07:31.080> now<00:07:31.199> let's<00:07:31.590> use
