 a sweet mole of delicious huitlacoche 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.640
 because right now it's delicious and the 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.900
 it was really worth it but since it has not 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.670

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:52.159
 that this one was the career of 

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:54.800
 culinary institute crowned and so 

00:00:52.159 --> 00:00:56.680

 it's called sven what we do 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.400
 Dave's research is a workshop that 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:10.480
 it is created in honor of a chef a friend 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.640
 our who died a year ago 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:14.230
 and we do research and everything 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.880
 we investigated we went back to school and 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:17.770
 we teach it to students today that 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.630
 interesting all of these to crown me for 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.490
 true is appearing the escrows there are 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.380
 truths of creating this moment where 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.720
 a question a culinary point with out 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:28.420
 dotcom and marketing steals culinary 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.470
 puntocom for any data I do not know 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.030
 if you want to enter from this 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.440
 wonderful experience as big as 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:33.760
 what it is to be base is the only thing that is good 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.960
 call at this time because the 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.420
 inscriptions for these are always 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.890
 open so we must take advantage 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.870
 learn to take advantage of this race 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.210
 which is an alternative if you already have 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:45.040
 some degree or already or you are in 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.500
 I prepared the truth and you just got out of 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.570
 pepe you do not know what to do suddenly there 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.730
 tastes that can give you well I'm going 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.350
 to this school take a diploma and 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:55.890
 the best you love the race can not 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.890
 be the hoop 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:07.750
 you are not surprised to know that I was a musician 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:09.340
 and even here I think it is more 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.840
 happy of life that has been 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:13.050
 cordoned off why they cut your hair 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:13.050
 yes 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.670
 this one that will prepare today 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.640
 all right 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:24.970
 let's make a tongue with a sauce 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.770
 chile mole and take the good leads 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:29.860
 for male tone and a little bit of radish 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:31.570
 carrot onion and the other pig apart 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.460
 interrupt I want you to see the carrot 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:34.300
 to see that in life we change 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:36.550
 to all 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:38.630
 This is a carrot and here we have it 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:41.660
 raw 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:43.160
 and here this cross is already fried 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:46.910
 I think he crossed a carrot with a 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:49.190
 bean I am fully sure for that 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:51.020
 It can not be that a whole carrot but 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.730
 Well, it caught my attention and 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.980
 I wanted to prove what he says came out 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:57.260
 your cornet because it starts well then 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.970
 we are going to seal the language because 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.680
 We said this language is already cooked 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.600
 previously very well with her is 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:05.780
 rationed is this we can take a 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:07.160
 pot express very well any house that 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.890
 we all have there is an express habitat 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:12.500
 no, well, nothing more, a little 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:15.770
 olive oil and what is it that she is 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:18.530
 what we are going to do on the other hand I have 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:20.120
 Here then some male platanitos very well 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.830
 this is what we did was equal cut 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.930
 we say them a beautiful aesthetic shape and 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:26.060
 us important rectangle in aesthetic 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:29.150
 true yes clear good today I think 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:31.460
 that the aesthetics besides that taste 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.920
 mind this dish is not good 

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:35.900
 aesthetics helps us a lot because it is 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.550
 convince is like convincing the 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.470
 client not to our guests that 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:40.490
 really the recipe same taste that is 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.800
 well or what are you giving salsify 

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:44.660
 exactly if it is a root is a 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.440
 tuber lady that we're really 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:48.230
 a little 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.670
 and what a delight I recommend it 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.160
 they also see that as I do in their 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:54.740
 home nothing easier than I put it to 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:57.140
 to cook it or wait for it to cook it and 

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:58.730
 knows what happens what is breaded is a 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:00.710
 How are you going to do it here? 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:03.920
 simply what I did was so much with the 

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:05.390
 banana like with that figure that not what 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:07.850

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:10.220
 butter ok we melted it and we put it 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:11.540
 a little bit of salt sugar and we're 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.100
 constantly bathing with this 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:15.430
 butter until the center is already 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:15.430

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:22.040
