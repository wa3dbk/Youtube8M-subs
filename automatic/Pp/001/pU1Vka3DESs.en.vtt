00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.330
 decided to tell per game assassin creed 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.700
 spirals and you all know what I don't like 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.860
 play at least everything that is not 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.929
 is logical so how if in the game 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.100
 need to sit and think quite 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.100
 maybe I appreciate her 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.919
 but just recently, it nevertheless decided 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.090
 look for a decent game in my 

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:35.370
 collections for review 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.040

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.600
 compare it or tell something 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.850
 new compared to the desktop version a 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.129

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.229
