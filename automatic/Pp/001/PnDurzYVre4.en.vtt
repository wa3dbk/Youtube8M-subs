and you will need to follow based on
that<00:01:45.210> but<00:01:45.540> for<00:01:45.750> this<00:01:45.869> specific<00:01:46.170> theme<00:01:46.710> it

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
that but for this specific theme it

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.399 
that but for this specific theme it
allows<00:01:47.159> me<00:01:47.189> to<00:01:47.610> stretch<00:01:47.939> to<00:01:48.659> use<00:01:48.780> a<00:01:48.810> logo<00:01:49.259> as

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
allows me to stretch to use a logo as

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.920 
allows me to stretch to use a logo as
wide<00:01:49.649> as<00:01:49.890> as<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:50.490> header<00:01:51.060> area<00:01:51.299> here<00:01:51.689> so<00:01:51.840> I've

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
wide as as the header area here so I've

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.660 
wide as as the header area here so I've
done<00:01:52.110> that<00:01:52.259> I've<00:01:52.380> created<00:01:52.530> my<00:01:52.770> image<00:01:53.070> to<00:01:53.549> be

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
done that I've created my image to be

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.020 
done that I've created my image to be
the<00:01:53.790> exact<00:01:54.149> width<00:01:54.540> of<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:55.860> header<00:01:56.070> and<00:01:56.340> then

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
the exact width of the header and then

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.870 
the exact width of the header and then
on<00:01:57.270> and<00:01:57.719> then<00:01:58.350> the<00:01:58.439> height<00:01:58.649> is<00:01:58.890> well<00:01:59.219> if<00:01:59.520> I

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
on and then the height is well if I

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.420 
on and then the height is well if I
remove<00:02:00.450> I<00:02:00.930> don't<00:02:01.259> need<00:02:01.439> this<00:02:01.710> title<00:02:02.189> anymore

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
remove I don't need this title anymore

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.600 
remove I don't need this title anymore
and<00:02:02.880> so<00:02:03.600> if<00:02:03.840> I<00:02:03.990> go<00:02:04.020> into<00:02:04.439> the<00:02:05.159> site<00:02:05.369> set<00:02:05.579> up

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
and so if I go into the site set up

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.680 
and so if I go into the site set up
again<00:02:06.060> and<00:02:06.329> simply<00:02:07.170> uncheck<00:02:07.350> title<00:02:08.569> that<00:02:09.569> will

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
again and simply uncheck title that will

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.770 
again and simply uncheck title that will
remove<00:02:10.170> the<00:02:11.129> title<00:02:11.580> from<00:02:11.879> the<00:02:11.940> header<00:02:12.360> when<00:02:12.750> I

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
remove the title from the header when I

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.349 
remove the title from the header when I
read<00:02:13.080> preview

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:14.359 
read preview

00:02:14.359 --> 00:02:17.209 
read preview
and<00:02:15.359> so<00:02:15.599> now<00:02:15.780> we<00:02:15.840> have<00:02:16.049> something<00:02:16.829> looks

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:17.219 
and so now we have something looks

00:02:17.219 --> 00:02:19.789 
and so now we have something looks
pretty<00:02:17.489> much<00:02:17.519> exactly<00:02:17.640> like<00:02:18.269> the<00:02:18.420> website<00:02:18.810> the

00:02:19.789 --> 00:02:19.799 
pretty much exactly like the website the

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:22.160 
pretty much exactly like the website the
because<00:02:20.700> I've<00:02:20.879> incorporated<00:02:21.299> the<00:02:21.780> title<00:02:22.109> of

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
because I've incorporated the title of

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.869 
because I've incorporated the title of
the<00:02:22.260> website<00:02:22.439> into<00:02:22.980> the<00:02:23.099> image<00:02:23.310> itself<00:02:23.459> I

00:02:23.869 --> 00:02:23.879 
the website into the image itself I

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:25.940 
the website into the image itself I
don't<00:02:24.030> need<00:02:24.209> that<00:02:24.269> title<00:02:24.959> option<00:02:25.139> anymore<00:02:25.560> and

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
don't need that title option anymore and

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.699 
don't need that title option anymore and
so<00:02:26.489> now<00:02:26.670> I've<00:02:26.879> just<00:02:26.909> got<00:02:27.180> the<00:02:27.450> image<00:02:27.810> and<00:02:28.019> it

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
so now I've just got the image and it

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:31.099 
so now I've just got the image and it
fits<00:02:28.980> exactly<00:02:29.249> based<00:02:30.209> on<00:02:30.450> the<00:02:30.629> width<00:02:30.870> and

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:31.109 
fits exactly based on the width and

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:33.949 
fits exactly based on the width and
height<00:02:31.500> of<00:02:31.739> the<00:02:32.189> header<00:02:32.400> for<00:02:32.790> this<00:02:32.939> theme<00:02:33.569> so

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
height of the header for this theme so

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:36.589 
height of the header for this theme so
like<00:02:34.230> I<00:02:34.260> said<00:02:34.409> you<00:02:34.739> need<00:02:34.859> to<00:02:34.920> check<00:02:35.599> the

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:36.599 
like I said you need to check the

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:39.110 
like I said you need to check the
documentation<00:02:37.319> for<00:02:38.189> the<00:02:38.250> third<00:02:38.519> party<00:02:38.879> themes

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
documentation for the third party themes

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.399 
documentation for the third party themes
if<00:02:39.329> you're<00:02:39.450> going<00:02:39.540> to<00:02:39.599> use<00:02:39.750> one<00:02:39.780> of<00:02:39.959> those<00:02:40.139> as

00:02:40.399 --> 00:02:40.409 
if you're going to use one of those as

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:43.159 
if you're going to use one of those as
far<00:02:40.650> as<00:02:40.769> what<00:02:41.010> size<00:02:41.340> logo<00:02:41.819> it<00:02:41.969> supports<00:02:42.450> some

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:43.169 
far as what size logo it supports some

00:02:43.169 --> 00:02:44.780 
far as what size logo it supports some
of<00:02:43.319> them<00:02:43.469> may<00:02:43.590> let<00:02:43.829> you<00:02:43.859> stretch<00:02:44.400> something

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
of them may let you stretch something

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.179 
of them may let you stretch something
across<00:02:44.999> the<00:02:45.269> entire<00:02:45.540> width<00:02:45.840> of<00:02:46.049> your<00:02:46.260> header

00:02:47.179 --> 00:02:47.189 
across the entire width of your header

00:02:47.189 --> 00:02:50.030 
across the entire width of your header
others<00:02:47.639> may<00:02:47.879> define<00:02:48.569> a<00:02:48.599> square<00:02:49.139> size<00:02:49.680> or

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
others may define a square size or

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.330 
others may define a square size or
smaller<00:02:50.340> size<00:02:50.909> and<00:02:51.269> you<00:02:51.870> need<00:02:51.959> to<00:02:52.530> define<00:02:53.159> your

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
smaller size and you need to define your

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:54.860 
smaller size and you need to define your
logo<00:02:53.699> based<00:02:53.909> on<00:02:54.030> those<00:02:54.150> dimensions<00:02:54.629> but<00:02:54.750> it

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
logo based on those dimensions but it

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.949 
logo based on those dimensions but it
really<00:02:55.019> is<00:02:55.199> just<00:02:55.319> as<00:02:55.500> simple<00:02:55.680> as<00:02:56.959> selecting

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
really is just as simple as selecting

00:02:57.959 --> 00:02:59.599 
really is just as simple as selecting
that<00:02:58.349> through<00:02:58.590> the<00:02:58.709> site<00:02:58.889> setup<00:02:59.099> here<00:02:59.430> and

00:02:59.599 --> 00:02:59.609 
that through the site setup here and

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:02.479 
that through the site setup here and
choosing<00:03:00.090> the<00:03:00.239> imogen<00:03:00.689> and<00:03:00.889> just<00:03:01.889> you<00:03:02.129> know<00:03:02.159> a

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
choosing the imogen and just you know a

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:05.720 
choosing the imogen and just you know a
normal<00:03:02.969> jpg<00:03:03.540> will<00:03:04.230> be<00:03:04.409> fine<00:03:04.650> it<00:03:05.370> is<00:03:05.489> a<00:03:05.519> good

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
normal jpg will be fine it is a good

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.240 
normal jpg will be fine it is a good
idea<00:03:05.790> to<00:03:05.969> optimize<00:03:06.540> your<00:03:06.569> your<00:03:07.290> image<00:03:07.409> for<00:03:07.859> the

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
idea to optimize your your image for the

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.789 
idea to optimize your your image for the
web<00:03:08.459> if<00:03:08.730> you<00:03:09.269> use<00:03:09.629> something<00:03:10.139> like<00:03:10.169> Photoshop

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799 
web if you use something like Photoshop

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:13.069 
web if you use something like Photoshop
to<00:03:11.099> do<00:03:11.250> images<00:03:11.760> and<00:03:11.969> that<00:03:12.569> way<00:03:12.689> you're<00:03:12.900> using

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:13.079 
to do images and that way you're using

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:14.809 
to do images and that way you're using
it<00:03:13.290> because<00:03:13.500> header<00:03:13.799> images<00:03:14.159> are<00:03:14.310> usually

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 
it because header images are usually

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:17.209 
it because header images are usually
large<00:03:15.269> such<00:03:15.659> as<00:03:15.810> this<00:03:15.959> one<00:03:16.199> and<00:03:16.349> so<00:03:16.469> it's<00:03:16.650> it's

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:17.219 
large such as this one and so it's it's

00:03:17.219 --> 00:03:21.140 
large such as this one and so it's it's
best<00:03:17.579> to<00:03:17.989> size<00:03:18.989> those<00:03:19.430> as<00:03:20.430> far<00:03:20.639> as<00:03:20.729> file<00:03:20.909> size

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
best to size those as far as file size

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:22.429 
best to size those as far as file size
is<00:03:21.180> concerned<00:03:21.720> so<00:03:21.870> that<00:03:21.989> they<00:03:22.109> don't<00:03:22.199> take<00:03:22.409> a

00:03:22.429 --> 00:03:22.439 
is concerned so that they don't take a

00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:24.939 
is concerned so that they don't take a
long<00:03:22.650> time<00:03:22.859> to<00:03:23.159> load<00:03:23.790> on<00:03:24.030> slower<00:03:24.299> connections

00:03:24.939 --> 00:03:24.949 
long time to load on slower connections

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:27.170 
long time to load on slower connections
for<00:03:25.949> people<00:03:26.250> that<00:03:26.430> are<00:03:26.519> browsing<00:03:26.729> your<00:03:26.939> site

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
for people that are browsing your site

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.539 
for people that are browsing your site
so<00:03:27.659> it's<00:03:28.590> a<00:03:28.680> good<00:03:28.799> idea<00:03:28.889> to<00:03:29.069> optimize<00:03:29.519> your

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 
so it's a good idea to optimize your

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:31.580 
so it's a good idea to optimize your
images<00:03:29.699> all<00:03:30.509> over<00:03:30.900> your<00:03:31.019> website<00:03:31.349> especially

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
images all over your website especially

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.520 
images all over your website especially
a<00:03:31.889> header<00:03:32.459> like<00:03:32.729> this<00:03:32.939> which<00:03:33.150> is<00:03:33.299> larger<00:03:33.750> in

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
a header like this which is larger in

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.649 
a header like this which is larger in
particular<00:03:35.040> so<00:03:35.310> that's<00:03:36.030> the<00:03:36.209> logo<00:03:36.479> and<00:03:36.599> I'm

00:03:36.649 --> 00:03:36.659 
particular so that's the logo and I'm

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:38.270 
particular so that's the logo and I'm
going<00:03:36.780> to<00:03:36.840> go<00:03:36.900> ahead<00:03:36.930> and<00:03:37.139> go<00:03:38.069> with<00:03:38.250> the

going to go ahead and go with the

going to go ahead and go with the

of rapidweaver classroom I do not have
one<00:03:53.879> defined<00:03:54.299> it<00:03:54.629> would<00:03:55.049> appear<00:03:55.470> here<00:03:56.009> where

00:03:56.149 --> 00:03:56.159 
one defined it would appear here where

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:59.209 
one defined it would appear here where
this<00:03:56.310> globe<00:03:56.900> is<00:03:57.900> is<00:03:58.439> right<00:03:58.739> now<00:03:58.919> but<00:03:59.069> i<00:03:59.159> believe

00:03:59.209 --> 00:03:59.219 
this globe is is right now but i believe

00:03:59.219 --> 00:04:01.550 
this globe is is right now but i believe
that<00:03:59.609> real<00:04:00.060> mac<00:04:00.299> software<00:04:00.569> actually<00:04:00.989> has<00:04:01.319> one

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
that real mac software actually has one

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:07.429 
that real mac software actually has one
to<00:04:01.650> find<00:04:01.889> if<00:04:02.099> we<00:04:02.189> go<00:04:02.340> to<00:04:02.400> their<00:04:02.639> website<00:04:06.439> let's

00:04:07.429 --> 00:04:07.439 
to find if we go to their website let's

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:13.849 
to find if we go to their website let's
see<00:04:07.650> if<00:04:07.769> one<00:04:07.979> appears<00:04:09.859> click<00:04:10.859> around<00:04:12.859> yeah

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.600 
this is specific for the favicon it
needs<00:04:45.580> to<00:04:45.789> be<00:04:45.939> of<00:04:46.060> the<00:04:46.629> form<00:04:46.900> at<00:04:47.139> dot<00:04:47.439> ICO<00:04:47.680> for

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:50.730 
needs to be of the form at dot ICO for
icon<00:04:49.030> that's<00:04:49.810> what<00:04:49.990> rapidweaver<00:04:50.349> is<00:04:50.560> going<00:04:50.680> to

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740 
icon that's what rapidweaver is going to

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:52.529 
icon that's what rapidweaver is going to
look<00:04:50.889> for<00:04:51.099> as<00:04:51.189> you<00:04:51.310> can<00:04:51.460> see<00:04:51.669> all<00:04:51.699> at<00:04:51.939> my<00:04:52.030> jpg

00:04:52.529 --> 00:04:52.539 
look for as you can see all at my jpg

00:04:52.539 --> 00:04:54.629 
look for as you can see all at my jpg
and<00:04:52.750> gif<00:04:52.810> images<00:04:53.319> are<00:04:53.469> grayed<00:04:53.770> out<00:04:53.800> in<00:04:54.219> the

00:04:54.629 --> 00:04:54.639 
and gif images are grayed out in the

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:56.670 
and gif images are grayed out in the
ping<00:04:54.879> file<00:04:55.360> as<00:04:55.599> well<00:04:55.810> they're<00:04:56.379> greyed<00:04:56.650> out

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:56.680 
ping file as well they're greyed out

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:00.089 
ping file as well they're greyed out
because<00:04:57.060> the<00:04:58.060> favicon<00:04:58.569> specifically<00:04:59.349> needs<00:04:59.710> a

00:05:00.089 --> 00:05:00.099 
because the favicon specifically needs a

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:03.420 
because the favicon specifically needs a
file<00:05:01.000> with<00:05:01.029> the<00:05:01.270> extension<00:05:01.389> ICO<00:05:02.289> and<00:05:02.620> so<00:05:03.189> I've

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:03.430 
file with the extension ICO and so I've

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:05.670 
file with the extension ICO and so I've
created<00:05:03.759> my<00:05:04.029> image<00:05:04.569> for<00:05:05.050> that<00:05:05.229> and<00:05:05.439> this

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:05.680 
created my image for that and this

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.290 
created my image for that and this
actually<00:05:05.889> will<00:05:06.189> not<00:05:06.340> be<00:05:06.490> the<00:05:06.610> same<00:05:06.789> image<00:05:07.120> that

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:07.300 
actually will not be the same image that

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:08.519 
actually will not be the same image that
I<00:05:07.360> used<00:05:07.509> in<00:05:07.599> raft<00:05:07.810> we<00:05:07.960> wear<00:05:08.139> this<00:05:08.199> will<00:05:08.349> be<00:05:08.409> my

00:05:08.519 --> 00:05:08.529 
I used in raft we wear this will be my

00:05:08.529 --> 00:05:11.249 
I used in raft we wear this will be my
company<00:05:08.979> logo<00:05:09.340> and<00:05:10.330> we'll<00:05:10.599> see<00:05:10.779> a<00:05:10.810> preview<00:05:11.110> of

00:05:11.249 --> 00:05:11.259 
company logo and we'll see a preview of

00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:13.080 
company logo and we'll see a preview of
that<00:05:11.469> it's<00:05:11.740> very<00:05:12.069> grainy<00:05:12.520> because<00:05:12.909> it's

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:13.090 
that it's very grainy because it's

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:16.559 
that it's very grainy because it's
extremely<00:05:13.689> small<00:05:14.069> but<00:05:15.069> if<00:05:15.490> I<00:05:15.639> select<00:05:16.120> open

00:05:16.559 --> 00:05:16.569 
extremely small but if I select open

00:05:16.569 --> 00:05:18.839 
extremely small but if I select open
that<00:05:16.960> then<00:05:17.590> it<00:05:17.710> now<00:05:17.860> appears<00:05:18.250> and<00:05:18.430> we<00:05:18.490> can<00:05:18.639> see

00:05:18.839 --> 00:05:18.849 
that then it now appears and we can see

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:22.559 
that then it now appears and we can see
it<00:05:19.000> it's<00:05:19.509> quite<00:05:19.870> small<00:05:20.169> in<00:05:20.379> here<00:05:21.300> but<00:05:22.300> that's

00:05:22.559 --> 00:05:22.569 
it it's quite small in here but that's

00:05:22.569 --> 00:05:24.869 
it it's quite small in here but that's
the<00:05:22.840> size<00:05:23.050> that<00:05:23.439> you<00:05:23.740> know<00:05:24.310> it<00:05:24.460> won't<00:05:24.610> be<00:05:24.729> any

00:05:24.869 --> 00:05:24.879 
the size that you know it won't be any

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:26.219 
the size that you know it won't be any
bigger<00:05:25.060> than<00:05:25.150> that<00:05:25.300> in<00:05:25.479> the<00:05:25.539> address<00:05:25.719> bar<00:05:26.020> so

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:26.229 
bigger than that in the address bar so

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:28.980 
bigger than that in the address bar so
that's<00:05:26.409> just<00:05:26.500> how<00:05:26.710> i<00:05:26.740> sized<00:05:27.069> my<00:05:27.340> image<00:05:27.610> and<00:05:28.330> so

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:28.990 
that's just how i sized my image and so

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:32.610 
that's just how i sized my image and so
we<00:05:29.680> can't<00:05:29.949> see<00:05:30.370> that<00:05:30.879> specifically<00:05:31.779> in<00:05:32.050> in<00:05:32.440> the

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:32.620 
we can't see that specifically in in the

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:34.800 
we can't see that specifically in in the
preview<00:05:33.069> here<00:05:33.430> but<00:05:34.000> if<00:05:34.270> we<00:05:34.389> preview<00:05:34.719> in

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:34.810 
preview here but if we preview in

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:36.779 
preview here but if we preview in
browser<00:05:34.839> I<00:05:35.440> believe<00:05:35.830> we'll<00:05:36.039> be<00:05:36.069> able<00:05:36.279> to<00:05:36.430> see

00:05:36.779 --> 00:05:36.789 
browser I believe we'll be able to see

00:05:36.789 --> 00:05:38.850 
browser I believe we'll be able to see
the<00:05:36.909> favicon<00:05:37.270> show<00:05:37.900> up<00:05:38.110> so<00:05:38.289> let's<00:05:38.409> try<00:05:38.710> that
