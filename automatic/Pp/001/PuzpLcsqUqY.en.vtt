00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:08.500
 I got a little messy hair in the morning. 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.419
 But I want to go that way today. 

00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:12.886
 Japanese and Korean style buns 

00:00:12.886 --> 00:00:15.115
 Can I have this length? 

00:00:15.115 --> 00:00:17.185
 Of course, you can 

00:00:17.185 --> 00:00:18.611
 First of all 

00:00:18.611 --> 00:00:22.143
 You just comb your hair to the top 

00:00:22.143 --> 00:00:23.980
 Collect above 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.331
 How much can you collect? 

00:00:26.331 --> 00:00:28.251
 You can take this wax 

00:00:28.251 --> 00:00:29.739
 Dip a little bit in the hand 

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:31.443
 Just a little bit, not too much 

00:00:31.443 --> 00:00:33.278
 This will help you when you are collecting your hair. 

00:00:33.278 --> 00:00:34.819
 It has a little stickiness 

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:36.499
 Approximately 45 degrees 

00:00:36.499 --> 00:00:38.792
 Because usually the head of everyone here 

00:00:38.792 --> 00:00:39.913
 Will be a little bit flat 

00:00:39.913 --> 00:00:41.451
 So we put the buns here. 

00:00:41.451 --> 00:00:44.139
 Can modify our head shape 

00:00:44.139 --> 00:00:46.852
 If the back is a little bit falling 

00:00:46.852 --> 00:00:49.667
 It doesn't matter 

00:00:49.667 --> 00:00:50.890
 Tied up 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:52.780
 Tied one on the second lap 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:54.827
 Small buns on top 

00:00:54.827 --> 00:00:55.948
 Pull a pull 

00:00:55.948 --> 00:00:57.111
 Top of the head 

00:00:57.111 --> 00:00:59.952
 You pull your head out first. 

00:00:59.952 --> 00:01:01.822
 Let the top of the head not be too flat 

00:01:01.822 --> 00:01:03.283
 Pull a little bit 

00:01:03.283 --> 00:01:05.275
 This will have a lovely feeling 

00:01:05.275 --> 00:01:06.787
 Some of the hair that fell 

00:01:06.787 --> 00:01:09.236
 We can now use this black hair clip 

00:01:09.236 --> 00:01:12.075
 Then roll your hair 

00:01:12.075 --> 00:01:15.620
 Then close to the top 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:17.371
 At the time of collection 

00:01:17.371 --> 00:01:20.596
 Remember to turn the other way around 

00:01:20.596 --> 00:01:25.372
 The end of the hairpin is received inside the hair 

00:01:25.372 --> 00:01:26.603
 So you won't see it on your head. 

00:01:26.603 --> 00:01:28.903
 a bunch of hairpins 

00:01:28.903 --> 00:01:30.059
 So now we want 

00:01:30.059 --> 00:01:33.391
 Continue to collect my hair 

00:01:33.391 --> 00:01:34.813
 Because my hair is more 

00:01:34.813 --> 00:01:37.183
 So I can't collect so much hair at once. 

00:01:37.183 --> 00:01:39.467
 Otherwise it will feel like a big wrap 

00:01:39.467 --> 00:01:42.107
 So you can use your hair volume. 

00:01:42.107 --> 00:01:46.192
 Decide how you want to collect your hair ends. 

00:01:46.192 --> 00:01:47.296
 Because now it looks 

00:01:47.296 --> 00:01:48.565
 You think it is pretty cute. 

00:01:48.565 --> 00:01:49.699
 But we can still put 

00:01:49.699 --> 00:01:51.913
 Take it from the back to the front 

00:01:51.913 --> 00:01:52.838
 This clip 

00:01:52.838 --> 00:01:53.734
 Clip with a U-shaped clip 

00:01:53.734 --> 00:01:57.347
 Can make this buns feel more stereo 

00:01:57.347 --> 00:01:58.595
 You can be 

00:01:58.595 --> 00:02:01.589
 Do some decoration on the head 

00:02:01.589 --> 00:02:03.515
 Then I will suggest the material you choose. 

00:02:03.515 --> 00:02:05.133
 Don't be silk or satin 

00:02:05.133 --> 00:02:06.191
 Because that would be slippery 

00:02:06.191 --> 00:02:08.779
 It will not be fixed on the hair. 

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:11.224
 You can choose this cotton material 

00:02:11.224 --> 00:02:14.443
 Folding and then folding 

00:02:14.443 --> 00:02:16.323
 Fold in half 

00:02:16.323 --> 00:02:18.371
 If you go a little neutral 

00:02:18.371 --> 00:02:20.782
 This width will be more handsome 

00:02:20.782 --> 00:02:22.831
 But if today we want to go like we 

00:02:22.831 --> 00:02:25.660
 Japanese and Korean version of this small cage series 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:26.714
 Lovely 

00:02:26.714 --> 00:02:28.615
 You can take a little more detail 

00:02:28.615 --> 00:02:30.576
 Take it from behind 

00:02:30.576 --> 00:02:32.789
 Probably at the lower edge of the ear 

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:35.523
 Is the position where we usually put the hair band 

00:02:35.523 --> 00:02:36.643
 Upward 

00:02:36.643 --> 00:02:38.707
 The place in front of you is symmetrical 

00:02:38.707 --> 00:02:40.435
 Like I like to put that 

00:02:40.435 --> 00:02:41.995
 Bow in the middle 

00:02:41.995 --> 00:02:43.420
 You hit a flat knot 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.309
 Just in the position of your hairline 

00:02:45.309 --> 00:02:49.283
 Just cover a little bit of your hairline 

00:02:51.036 --> 00:02:53.651
 This knot does not stipulate where it must be tied. 

00:02:53.651 --> 00:02:54.507
 You can tie the middle 

00:02:54.507 --> 00:02:55.102
 You feel so cute 

00:02:55.102 --> 00:02:57.214
 Or you move it a little bit to the side 

00:02:57.214 --> 00:02:58.532
 Side 

00:02:58.532 --> 00:03:00.619
 So today is to teach everyone to tie this 

00:03:00.619 --> 00:03:01.977
 Outside the desktop dragon bag 

00:03:01.977 --> 00:03:03.944
 Also attach a simple square scarf accessory 

00:03:03.944 --> 00:03:06.482
 Can make you very cute this summer.
