00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.790
 We started to talk a bit more aside, then we went 

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:06.140
 We started Friday morning and today. 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:08.740
 as I already said is the coffee on the special table because 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:11.410
 It's the World Health Day that we're going to see on that day. 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:14.950
 What is the importance of this breakfast in the newsroom in Brazil? 

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:26.759
 in 1948 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:31.439
 the world population-based health organization 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.439
 April 7 as World Health Day 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:41.290
 The date in addition to encouraging the care with the body and mind seeks to alert about the 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:44.720
 major problems that can harm people all over the world 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.600
 health is to ensure the condition of well-being by harmonizing the 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.100
 an individual's mental and social physical 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.340
 hygiene influences and prevention world health day alert that the fight 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.340
 steadily decreases public health expenditures 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:12.210
 it is impossible to talk about health without going through the 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.210
 balance and quality of life 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:23.080
 many people ignore the great potential of breakfast but the 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:28.150
 from today you should take seriously the first meal of the day called 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:31.600
 breakfast is a real lady of scales 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.159
 some people avoid breakfast thinking about saving calories 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:41.150
 wrong thinking with spending time today and the delay to leave home without 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:42.350
 eat nothing 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.350
 bad habit 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:51.900
 research proves that starting the day in fasting forces the body to economize 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:56.200
 fuel or in the end is used his stored body 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.200
 greetings heard 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:04.210
 Sock in the morning is energy-efficient and offers better options 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:08.180
 the pressure throughout the day since you will not always be with the 

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:11.180
 feeling of hunger and their struggle 

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:17.719
 for you to get excited about breakfast know that a survey carried out 

00:02:17.719 --> 00:02:23.049
 in the United States have shown that about 80% of patients who lost 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:28.159
 less than 13 kilos kept by the use of control for more than a year when 

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:31.159

 The day is just beginning. 

00:02:57.369 --> 00:03:01.139
 the girl who is important to breakfast take mari natália and sassá 

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:05.040

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:08.419
 shows stood up to show the same old age 

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:15.129
 It's not age, it's not, but I learned the timetable so 

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:20.000
 that it will be possible to estimate the total value of up to 29 to drink coffee 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.720
 but the karnak commendation the maranhense ma hand we will deliver battisti in brazil 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.400
 everything on the card the score for the club that happens we are in a rush 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.910
 the island is the one I'm telling the truth the right-hander I already told you have to 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:38.370
 learning to eat wherever a healthy form of the healthy internet does not have 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.690
 broadband internet access as was that breakfast two today 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:43.379
 days 

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:46.379
 the time has come 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:51.379
 this building 

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:56.069
 keila he is an example is the first night you will be in your 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:04:01.059
 living room the closest to mother's day aunt he ran 10 miles already 

00:04:01.059 --> 00:04:05.779
 today sad for defeat versiani denied that he was ankle 

00:04:05.779 --> 00:04:08.089
 every day 

00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:11.309
 but defended the fenerbahçe 

00:04:11.309 --> 00:04:15.459
 to try to predict in which she too this Tuesday 6 to 0 on Wednesday 

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:21.139
 currently evaluating the report it was important to sleep very late 

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:25.189
 habit that she tries not to take this change already keeps already marked 

00:04:25.189 --> 00:04:28.269
 presence and now asks everyone on the street who drinks breakfast 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.830
 for him most would not take a majority that would not know 

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:35.379
 because it is a habit of the obese does not eat breakfast 

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:39.330
 although generally mature and have a good habit of taking 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:40.840
 better breakfast is possible 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:44.180
 I would have to say I said this program is true 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:47.080
 say we have breakfast 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:49.279
 eat lunch or have a drink 

00:04:49.279 --> 00:04:52.759
 vicente did not lose the ability if it is true 

00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:55.800
 if people make versions you can abuse a little bit for example 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.300
 the marina speaks 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.090
 as it is one thing and it will not have its brother 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:03.880
 that's it today I also speak to see the selection all quickly but each one 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:04.759
 like a little bit 

00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:07.030
 but could make more is a meal 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:08.030
 to be made 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:11.920
 still in greater quantity for example where the disaster occurred the increase of the 

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:14.850
 beaches would have to be a greater amount than what he ate because 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:17.129
 will spend a lot of calories there 

00:05:17.129 --> 00:05:19.449
 so it will depend on the expense that the person will have 

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:22.210
 there are people who are more at night than in the morning 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:23.490
 to answer for looking 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:24.900
 eat a lot in the afternoon 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:28.570
 but remembering that we exercise in income everything happens one more 

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:29.849
 little earlier in the day 

00:05:29.849 --> 00:05:33.039

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:43.300
 despite getting up early to work to get five years to study for example 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:44.200
 night 

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:47.250
 or have something to do on the Saturday of each month of work all day 

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:52.660
 I spend a lot of energy doing housework I have an idea 

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:53.690

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:57.880
 the level can not miss fruits if the bills will propose needs - in case 

00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:59.279

 Little will I get vitamin E 

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:06.379
 the parmalat in 

00:06:06.379 --> 00:06:10.649
 this one has enough carbohydrate the melon is very rich in hydrating liquids 

00:06:10.649 --> 00:06:11.619
 enough 

00:06:11.619 --> 00:06:13.810
 and also can not miss a bit of integral 

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:17.820
 so the trout any of these loose pieces is cool is super cool as 

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:21.430
 companies that you are expecting, this is a great area where 

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:24.510
 It is common to humans another day a small piece of pineapple 

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:27.810
 It's him who is going to go like this is not going to have a 

00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:28.789
 nutrients 

00:06:28.789 --> 00:06:33.000
 and you can not miss the complex carbohydrate that you see in the vein of people 

00:06:32.999 --> 00:06:34.270
 see on brown bread 

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:35.629
 and protein 

00:06:35.629 --> 00:06:40.349
 the turkey breast protein and the other has some works showing 

00:06:40.349 --> 00:06:42.490
 that the new one eaten for breakfast 

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:45.490
 promote satiety until lunchtime 

00:06:45.490 --> 00:06:46.820
 besides being good 

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:52.520
 they will start to leave next to the 93 arrived logic is his name in the league 

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:58.729

00:06:58.729 --> 00:07:01.110
 that yes

 when he spent two hours at breakfast that plate hungry again 

00:07:14.899 --> 00:07:18.289
 because these foods that are high glycemic index will give a discharge 

00:07:18.289 --> 00:07:21.639
