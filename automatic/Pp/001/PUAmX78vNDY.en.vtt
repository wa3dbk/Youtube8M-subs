pulsating<00:00:26.390> rulers<00:00:26.750> we<00:00:27.530> chop<00:00:27.770> the<00:00:27.920> artistic<00:00:28.220> or

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:28.580 
pulsating rulers we chop the artistic or

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:30.670 
pulsating rulers we chop the artistic or
also<00:00:28.820> filter<00:00:29.360> we<00:00:29.660> have<00:00:29.840> some<00:00:30.050> resonance<00:00:30.410> and

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:30.680 
also filter we have some resonance and

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:31.870 
also filter we have some resonance and
pitch<00:00:30.860> shifting<00:00:31.190> going<00:00:31.460> on

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:31.880 
pitch shifting going on

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.330 
pitch shifting going on
so<00:00:32.239> here's<00:00:32.390> my<00:00:32.509> first<00:00:32.719> example<00:00:33.350> this<00:00:34.129> is<00:00:34.309> the

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:34.340 
so here's my first example this is the

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.190 
so here's my first example this is the
absolute<00:00:35.000> initial<00:00:35.420> sound<00:00:35.660> right<00:00:35.870> out<00:00:36.020> to<00:00:36.050> the

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:36.200 
absolute initial sound right out to the

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:42.070 
absolute initial sound right out to the
GT<00:00:36.560> 10

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:42.080 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.080 

now<00:00:43.080> this<00:00:43.290> is<00:00:43.410> what<00:00:43.560> I<00:00:43.590> get<00:00:43.920> if<00:00:44.520> I<00:00:44.670> turn<00:00:44.880> the

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
now this is what I get if I turn the

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.330 
now this is what I get if I turn the
unit<00:00:45.240> on<00:00:45.450> it<00:00:45.750> also<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.530> Drad

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.080 
unit on it also the Drad
is<00:00:47.550> synchronized<00:00:48.360> to<00:00:49.340> so<00:00:50.340> 20<00:00:50.670> with<00:00:50.790> the<00:00:50.910> red

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
MIDI cable and able to you know have a

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.110 
MIDI cable and able to you know have a
media<00:00:55.500> sync<00:00:55.770> with<00:00:55.950> an<00:00:56.070> external<00:00:56.400> device<00:00:56.640> or

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
media sync with an external device or

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.820

that<00:00:57.360> can<00:00:57.660> stick<00:00:57.870> it<00:00:57.989> up<00:00:58.110> to<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.290> computer<00:00:58.650> so

00:00:58.820 --> 00:00:58.830 
that can stick it up to the computer so

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:09.770 
that can stick it up to the computer so
check<00:00:59.010> this<00:00:59.100> out
