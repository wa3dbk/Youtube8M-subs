360<00:02:09.099> at<00:02:09.519> the<00:02:09.700> chest<00:02:10.450> she<00:02:11.260> like<00:02:11.379> to<00:02:11.500> keep<00:02:11.590> the

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:11.709 
360 at the chest she like to keep the

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:13.020 
360 at the chest she like to keep the
chest<00:02:11.920> bits<00:02:12.129> down<00:02:12.310> here<00:02:12.489> to<00:02:12.609> be<00:02:12.700> a<00:02:12.730> little<00:02:12.909> more

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
chest bits down here to be a little more

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.410 
chest bits down here to be a little more
accurate

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
accurate

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.479 
accurate
his<00:02:14.690> upper<00:02:15.319> waist<00:02:15.560> can<00:02:15.920> rotate<00:02:16.270> 360<00:02:17.590> degrees<00:02:18.590> a

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:19.489 
his upper waist can rotate 360 degrees a

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:22.390 
his upper waist can rotate 360 degrees a
little<00:02:20.209> bit<00:02:20.300> hindered<00:02:20.690> but<00:02:20.959> it<00:02:21.260> moves<00:02:21.620> 360

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
little bit hindered but it moves 360

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.820 
little bit hindered but it moves 360
like<00:02:22.910> Singh<00:02:23.150> the<00:02:23.239> forward<00:02:23.540> and<00:02:23.660> back<00:02:23.810> side<00:02:24.500> to

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
like Singh the forward and back side to

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.240 
like Singh the forward and back side to
side<00:02:25.150> bend<00:02:26.150> it<00:02:26.330> to<00:02:26.630> different<00:02:26.959> places<00:02:27.170> one<00:02:28.099> up

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
side bend it to different places one up

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.520 
side bend it to different places one up
one<00:02:28.430> place<00:02:28.670> up<00:02:28.910> here<00:02:28.940> and<00:02:29.510> one<00:02:30.170> at<00:02:30.290> the<00:02:30.380> knee

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
one place up here and one at the knee

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.449 
one place up here and one at the knee
and<00:02:30.830> the<00:02:31.760> feet<00:02:32.060> can<00:02:32.270> rotate<00:02:32.450> 360<00:02:33.230> degrees<00:02:33.459> so

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459 
and the feet can rotate 360 degrees so

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:36.880 
and the feet can rotate 360 degrees so
that's<00:02:34.610> it<00:02:34.880> on<00:02:35.180> articulation<00:02:35.540> Bryan<00:02:36.080> ID<00:02:36.319> he

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
that's it on articulation Bryan ID he

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:42.820 
that's it on articulation Bryan ID he
has<00:02:37.010> accurate<00:02:38.000> guns<00:02:38.770> okay<00:02:40.930> but<00:02:41.930> other<00:02:42.560> than

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
has accurate guns okay but other than

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.220 
has accurate guns okay but other than
that<00:02:42.920> it's<00:02:43.280> just<00:02:43.400> pretty<00:02:44.120> cool<00:02:44.269> Ironhide<00:02:44.720> it

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
that it's just pretty cool Ironhide it

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.830 
that it's just pretty cool Ironhide it
was<00:02:45.349> really<00:02:45.590> the<00:02:45.709> most<00:02:45.890> involved<00:02:46.840> transformer

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
was really the most involved transformer

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.030 
was really the most involved transformer
let's<00:02:48.019> just<00:02:48.140> put<00:02:48.260> it<00:02:48.319> that<00:02:48.410> way<00:02:48.470> in<00:02:48.709> the<00:02:48.800> nest

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
let's just put it that way in the nest

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.430 
let's just put it that way in the nest
team<00:02:49.459> because<00:02:50.360> you<00:02:50.480> saw<00:02:50.660> sideswiping<00:02:51.319> all

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
team because you saw sideswiping all

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.410 
team because you saw sideswiping all
them<00:02:51.620> I<00:02:51.650> mean<00:02:52.130> Optimus<00:02:52.670> was<00:02:52.850> like<00:02:53.120> not

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
them I mean Optimus was like not

00:02:53.420 --> 00:03:00.670 
them I mean Optimus was like not
involved<00:02:53.870> in<00:02:53.930> this<00:02:54.110> team<00:02:54.380> at<00:02:54.500> all<00:02:55.180> but<00:02:59.680> because

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
involved in this team at all but because

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.400 
involved in this team at all but because
even<00:03:01.220> on<00:03:01.310> the<00:03:01.400> toy<00:03:01.610> it<00:03:01.790> shows<00:03:02.000> up<00:03:02.180> nest<00:03:02.900> across

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
even on the toy it shows up nest across

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.580 
even on the toy it shows up nest across
the<00:03:03.590> side<00:03:03.799> and<00:03:04.209> he<00:03:05.209> was<00:03:05.239> in<00:03:05.450> the<00:03:05.540> movie<00:03:05.720> mode

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
the side and he was in the movie mode

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.440 
the side and he was in the movie mode
and<00:03:06.799> most<00:03:07.400> time<00:03:07.610> he<00:03:07.730> was<00:03:07.819> with<00:03:07.940> the<00:03:08.030> nest<00:03:08.209> team

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
and most time he was with the nest team

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.170 
and most time he was with the nest team
a<00:03:08.630> lot<00:03:08.840> in<00:03:08.989> the<00:03:09.049> movie

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
a lot in the movie

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:15.009 
a lot in the movie
so<00:03:13.150> there's<00:03:14.150> Ironhide

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:15.019 
so there's Ironhide

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:17.020 
so there's Ironhide
I<00:03:15.049> want<00:03:15.830> Optimus<00:03:16.250> it's<00:03:16.400> very<00:03:16.670> cool<00:03:16.880> figure

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
very thin very skinny the leader class

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.190 
very thin very skinny the leader class
is<00:03:19.880> actually<00:03:20.180> a<00:03:20.239> little<00:03:20.420> more<00:03:20.660> accurate<00:03:21.079> in

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
is actually a little more accurate in

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.440 
is actually a little more accurate in
this<00:03:21.350> one<00:03:21.620> the<00:03:21.739> fact<00:03:21.920> that<00:03:22.209> you<00:03:23.209> can<00:03:23.359> actually

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450

you can actually have the hand and the

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.900 
you can actually have the hand and the
sword<00:03:27.790> so<00:03:30.040> particular<00:03:31.040> oh<00:03:31.130> wow<00:03:31.430> no<00:03:31.489> problem

sword so particular oh wow no problem
I've<00:03:32.000> had<00:03:32.120> on<00:03:32.239> all<00:03:32.390> the<00:03:32.480> Optimus<00:03:32.840> as<00:03:32.989> I<00:03:33.079> saw

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
I've had on all the Optimus as I saw

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.020 
I've had on all the Optimus as I saw
there<00:03:33.500> and<00:03:33.590> this<00:03:33.680> is<00:03:33.859> the<00:03:34.010> least<00:03:34.310> noticeable

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
there and this is the least noticeable

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.710 
there and this is the least noticeable
one<00:03:35.739> the<00:03:36.739> face<00:03:36.980> plate<00:03:37.280> the<00:03:38.180> silver<00:03:38.540> on<00:03:38.630> the

face plate on the right the the blue on

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:44.050 
face plate on the right the the blue on
the<00:03:42.650> left<00:03:42.859> the<00:03:43.070> blue<00:03:43.280> just<00:03:43.670> goes<00:03:43.910> straight

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060 
the left the blue just goes straight

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.240 
the left the blue just goes straight
down<00:03:44.269> like<00:03:44.630> this<00:03:44.870> and<00:03:45.140> on<00:03:45.560> the<00:03:45.650> right<00:03:45.799> it<00:03:45.980> kind

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
down like this and on the right it kind

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:49.599 
down like this and on the right it kind
of<00:03:46.310> curves<00:03:47.269> down<00:03:47.739> slanted<00:03:48.739> so<00:03:48.920> it<00:03:49.100> looks<00:03:49.519> like

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:49.609 
of curves down slanted so it looks like

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:52.150 
of curves down slanted so it looks like
it<00:03:49.790> has<00:03:49.910> less<00:03:50.090> of<00:03:50.120> blue<00:03:50.540> or<00:03:51.290> less<00:03:51.560> of<00:03:51.709> silver<00:03:52.070> on

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 
it has less of blue or less of silver on

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.550 
it has less of blue or less of silver on
one<00:03:52.310> side<00:03:52.519> but<00:03:52.640> it<00:03:52.730> really<00:03:52.850> is<00:03:53.290> just<00:03:54.290> a<00:03:54.350> little

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
one side but it really is just a little

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.340 
one side but it really is just a little
bit<00:03:54.709> but<00:03:54.890> not<00:03:54.980> much

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:56.350 
bit but not much

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:59.170 
bit but not much
so<00:03:57.350> it's<00:03:57.709> transformed<00:03:58.190> him<00:03:58.430> which<00:03:58.819> one<00:03:58.970> I<00:03:59.000> do

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
so it's transformed him which one I do

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.720 
so it's transformed him which one I do
not<00:03:59.660> transform<00:04:00.079> him<00:04:00.350> oh<00:04:00.380> my<00:04:00.500> gosh<00:04:00.920> I<00:04:01.280> just<00:04:01.579> hit

I'm<00:04:17.479> sure<00:04:17.690> this<00:04:17.870> could<00:04:18.049> rotate<00:04:18.200> 360<00:04:18.620> degrees

00:04:18.909 --> 00:04:18.919
