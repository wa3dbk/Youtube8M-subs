00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 and big hello to all of us today 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.660
 make a very cool styling which 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:10.830
 would be perfect for every day to start 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:12.719
 I'll comb my wet clean hair and sweat 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.630
 already take your favorite last 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.460
 time texture syoss spray 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:20.039
 auto-training and you can of course take and 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.260
 any other similar spray and so i 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.090
 I'm starting to spray this spray all over. 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.939
 the length of the hair can even lower your head 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.849
 down so it is better distributed and 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.230
 after that we already take gum i 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.100
 separate strand 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:38.610
 he faces and start to braid the most 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:41.280
 ordinary harness plate i have it enough 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:44.250
 long and it turns out to be wound 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.469
 on ourselves and we end up doing this 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.020
 a small bunch or something if you can 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:51.149
 so to name and I fix 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.110
 now i do the same with the other 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.320
 parties 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.510
 parting and we get down 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.949
 further down that is to be so 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.510
 smooth transition and 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.180
 our curl looked naturally 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.580
 our wave that is down so descended 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.250
 In general, the whole point is to 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.170
 make such tight flagella around 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.200
 the perimeter of the head can make them two 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.909
 4 possible 6 and they will all 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.549
 equally good in the end look 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:21.240
 now i'm a little dry looking for my own 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:23.729
 flagella hair dryer and I will already unravel them 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:27.960
 decided to start back and just calm 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:29.970
 unwinding the flagellum and not touching it also 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.049
 you can additionally dry each 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.049
 flagellum hair dryer 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:42.410
 now you can lower your head down and 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:44.450
 before dry hair sales themselves already 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:51.260
 will try again but what if they can 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:53.390
 help in this matter now I 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.720
 in addition still I will put a little spray 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.560
 on the hair in order to give them more 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.050
 larger volume and 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.540
 before sushi until the end of the hair so that they 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:04.910
 were completely dry and in principle on 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:07.130
 In this way, everything ends here 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:09.890
 just really and here's an option 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.870
 I like this shawl like 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.760
 wear and with a side parting and also with 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.010
 direct so this is generally excellent 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.800
 option for girls who have hair 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.030
 straight or curly a little so here 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.980
 excellent and styling 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.110
 and here after i have a whole day 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:27.500
 Passed with this styling it can already 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:30.290
 update i will braid 25 flagellum on 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.180
 top of the head you can say i do two 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.890
 By the way, I like this bundle a lot. 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.050
 hairstyle in itself she looks 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.209
 very funny cool so i 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:40.670
 sometimes even so I really go 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:43.730
 Initially, you can do these two 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:45.380
 beam instead of six for example but it is already 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.260
 at your discretion just if you 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:50.630
 make two bunches then you get 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:53.060
 larger waves such curls and if 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:55.760
 Of course 6 beams do they will 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.769
 smaller so here after i 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.110
 I braid them for a while I look like 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:02.120
 they can be an hour half an hour 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:04.130
 business and no matter not playing so 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.900
 How many opportunities do you have? 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:09.800
 with them so much and go and you can 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:11.690
 do during the day several times and if 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:13.970
 for example, you will need such styling with 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:15.950
 where you want to go all day 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:17.720
 and you need her in the morning to look good and 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.550
 in the evening and so that you are not particularly not 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.400
 experienced our what they would look like 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:26.060
 your hair then this is a great option and 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:28.250
 here I have dismissed again beam 2 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:30.500
 And this option has turned out to be more 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.330
 larger waves bigger curls too 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:36.019
 looks incredibly beautiful despite 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:38.810
 the fact that it is not just created 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:40.790
 so say the hairstyle that's great 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:41.700
 option also this hairstyle is fine 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.980
 will look 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.900
 and on the second day I am still the same 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.360
 the very way I braid on top two 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.910
 hooks all night and morning just already 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.950
 after being fully gathered before 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.450
 Exit I unravel type 2 . 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:57.209
 and I get all the same 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:59.400
 waves large hairstyles do not look so 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:02.280
 as if you tried and worked on it 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:04.530
 half a day to look natural and lightly 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.540
 careless and this effect for example is very and 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:09.209
 I like it very much 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:13.099
 time do yourself such a laying on 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:13.099
 Thank you all for your attention.
