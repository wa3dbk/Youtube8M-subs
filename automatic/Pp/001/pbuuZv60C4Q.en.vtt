00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
I do not like lathering cleansers I have

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.620 
I do not like lathering cleansers I have
very<00:01:14.010> bad<00:01:14.189> thoughts<00:01:14.520> about<00:01:14.700> blathering

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
very bad thoughts about blathering

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.510 
very bad thoughts about blathering
cleansers<00:01:16.020> usually<00:01:16.470> basically<00:01:17.100> most

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
cleansers usually basically most

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.149 
cleansers usually basically most
lathering<00:01:17.880> cleansers<00:01:18.360> will<00:01:18.869> strip<00:01:19.740> your<00:01:19.860> face

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
lathering cleansers will strip your face

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.340 
lathering cleansers will strip your face
of<00:01:20.460> all<00:01:20.700> of<00:01:20.850> its<00:01:20.970> natural<00:01:21.360> oils<00:01:21.479> and<00:01:21.900> then<00:01:22.170> your

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
of all of its natural oils and then your

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.219 
of all of its natural oils and then your
skin<00:01:22.680> will<00:01:23.100> compensate<00:01:23.790> by<00:01:24.270> over<00:01:24.750> producing

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
skin will compensate by over producing

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.730 
skin will compensate by over producing
oils<00:01:25.560> so<00:01:26.369> if<00:01:26.580> you<00:01:26.700> have<00:01:26.909> oily<00:01:27.479> skin<00:01:27.509> that<00:01:28.439> is

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
oils so if you have oily skin that is

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.830 
oils so if you have oily skin that is
something<00:01:29.189> to<00:01:29.460> think<00:01:29.759> about<00:01:29.880> is<00:01:30.210> it<00:01:30.509> could<00:01:30.689> be

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
something to think about is it could be

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.660 
something to think about is it could be
the<00:01:31.079> fact<00:01:31.290> that<00:01:31.380> you're<00:01:31.619> stripping<00:01:32.159> your<00:01:32.430> face

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
the fact that you're stripping your face

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.249 
the fact that you're stripping your face
by<00:01:32.970> using<00:01:33.299> a<00:01:33.360> really<00:01:33.540> harsh<00:01:33.840> cleanser

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
by using a really harsh cleanser

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.870 
by using a really harsh cleanser
thinking<00:01:34.890> that's<00:01:35.070> what<00:01:35.220> your<00:01:35.340> oily<00:01:35.640> skin

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
thinking that's what your oily skin

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.050 
thinking that's what your oily skin
needs<00:01:36.119> but<00:01:36.930> for<00:01:37.140> me<00:01:37.530> when<00:01:38.189> I<00:01:38.220> went<00:01:38.490> natural<00:01:38.640> and

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
needs but for me when I went natural and

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.030 
needs but for me when I went natural and
I<00:01:39.119> started<00:01:39.570> using<00:01:39.780> more<00:01:40.140> natural<00:01:40.290> cleansers

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
I started using more natural cleansers

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.469 
I started using more natural cleansers
that<00:01:41.070> didn't<00:01:41.490> strip<00:01:41.670> my<00:01:41.790> face<00:01:42.060> I<00:01:42.299> realized

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 
oil can sometimes break people out but I

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:11.159 
oil can sometimes break people out but I
like<00:04:09.579> I<00:04:09.700> said<00:04:09.880> I<00:04:09.910> am<00:04:10.090> very<00:04:10.120> very<00:04:10.599> acne<00:04:10.989> prone

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:11.169 
like I said I am very very acne prone

00:04:11.169 --> 00:04:14.580 
like I said I am very very acne prone
and<00:04:11.380> this<00:04:11.530> does<00:04:11.709> not<00:04:11.739> break<00:04:12.700> my<00:04:12.910> skin<00:04:12.970> out<00:04:13.590> the

and this does not break my skin out the
tube<00:04:15.040> is<00:04:15.220> six<00:04:15.549> fluid<00:04:15.880> ounces<00:04:16.180> and<00:04:16.419> it's<00:04:16.720> a

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
tube is six fluid ounces and it's a

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:19.080 
tube is six fluid ounces and it's a
really<00:04:17.109> kind<00:04:17.289> of<00:04:17.440> pearly<00:04:18.039> milky<00:04:18.549> white<00:04:18.789> color

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.090 
really kind of pearly milky white color

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:22.560 
really kind of pearly milky white color
it's<00:04:19.329> definitely<00:04:19.750> not<00:04:19.930> a<00:04:19.989> cream<00:04:20.680> it's<00:04:21.570> it's

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570 
it's definitely not a cream it's it's

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:25.320 
it's definitely not a cream it's it's
more<00:04:22.780> like<00:04:22.990> a<00:04:23.020> gel<00:04:23.530> that<00:04:23.860> has<00:04:24.460> a<00:04:24.490> pearly<00:04:25.060> kind

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:25.330 
more like a gel that has a pearly kind

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:26.460 
more like a gel that has a pearly kind
of<00:04:25.390> white<00:04:25.719> consistent

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:29.010 
of white consistent
see<00:04:26.620> it<00:04:26.950> is<00:04:27.190> incredibly<00:04:27.910> liquidy<00:04:28.480> and<00:04:28.870> that's

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.020 
see it is incredibly liquidy and that's

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:30.930 
see it is incredibly liquidy and that's
the<00:04:29.170> one<00:04:29.410> downside<00:04:29.890> I<00:04:29.950> have<00:04:30.220> to<00:04:30.370> the<00:04:30.490> packaging

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:30.940 
the one downside I have to the packaging

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:33.000 
the one downside I have to the packaging
is<00:04:31.090> I<00:04:31.180> kind<00:04:31.390> of<00:04:31.450> wish<00:04:31.630> that<00:04:31.840> it<00:04:31.930> came<00:04:32.170> in<00:04:32.440> a<00:04:32.650> pump

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.010 
is I kind of wish that it came in a pump

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:34.500 
is I kind of wish that it came in a pump
yes<00:04:33.340> tubes<00:04:33.670> are<00:04:33.850> easier<00:04:34.090> because<00:04:34.180> you<00:04:34.330> can

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:34.510 
yes tubes are easier because you can

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:35.880 
yes tubes are easier because you can
squeeze<00:04:34.810> out<00:04:34.930> every<00:04:35.110> last<00:04:35.380> bit<00:04:35.560> it's<00:04:35.800> really

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:35.890 
squeeze out every last bit it's really

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:37.890 
squeeze out every last bit it's really
hard<00:04:36.340> to<00:04:36.460> control<00:04:36.820> the<00:04:37.090> amount<00:04:37.330> of<00:04:37.480> product

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:37.900 
hard to control the amount of product

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:39.690 
hard to control the amount of product
that<00:04:37.990> comes<00:04:38.410> out<00:04:38.650> of<00:04:38.680> it<00:04:38.830> because<00:04:38.980> it<00:04:39.190> is<00:04:39.280> so

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:39.700 
that comes out of it because it is so

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:42.900 
that comes out of it because it is so
liquidy<00:04:40.420> I<00:04:40.950> mean<00:04:41.950> you<00:04:42.040> can<00:04:42.190> hear<00:04:42.430> it<00:04:42.610> it's
