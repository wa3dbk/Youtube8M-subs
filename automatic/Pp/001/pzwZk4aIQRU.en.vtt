00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
very comfortable in the year there's

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.760 
very comfortable in the year there's
still<00:02:19.460> a<00:02:19.760> nice<00:02:20.480> amount<00:02:20.900> of<00:02:21.080> springing<00:02:21.470> them

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770

different-size heads

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:28.569 
different-size heads
but<00:02:25.909> it's<00:02:26.239> not<00:02:26.599> a<00:02:26.629> strong<00:02:27.409> strong<00:02:27.799> spring<00:02:28.310> so

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:28.579 
but it's not a strong strong spring so

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:30.039 
but it's not a strong strong spring so
they're<00:02:28.730> very<00:02:29.000> comfortable<00:02:29.329> they<00:02:29.569> don't<00:02:29.750> pull

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:32.329 
into time and we still got this

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:34.660 
into time and we still got this
adjustment<00:02:32.900> on<00:02:32.989> each<00:02:33.200> arm<00:02:33.500> as<00:02:33.739> well<00:02:33.920> just<00:02:34.459> by

00:02:40.839 --> 00:02:40.849 
very effective the amount of rotation

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:43.240 
very effective the amount of rotation
you've<00:02:41.359> got<00:02:41.480> on<00:02:41.569> these<00:02:41.780> is<00:02:42.319> great<00:02:42.799> we've<00:02:43.069> got

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:00.829 
tight you still do get sound leakage at

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:03.490 
tight you still do get sound leakage at
high<00:03:01.129> volumes<00:03:01.609> but<00:03:01.849> not<00:03:02.090> too<00:03:02.299> bad<00:03:02.569> but<00:03:02.840> the
