00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:20.730
 I see my work, they really 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.470
 priest of a sense of the city 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.660
 You know I do not feel comfortable? 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.779
 and I never felt comfortable during the 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.119
 period of graphite 92 when I started 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.929
 it is with this static idea of ​​appropriation 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.120
 of the city 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:36.030
 every time I went to the street to 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.879
 Street told me no, it's not that 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.770
 Do you know that I left home thinking that I 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.870
 I wanted to say something that when 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.910
 I'd walk in the street and show me that 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.350
 I was thinking about talking I was 14 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.809
 13 years 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.309
 The street kid showed that 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.699
 that I had in my head was not so 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:56.010
 important so the places thus had 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.899
 much more meaning sometimes I 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.850
 I started to talk with the city of this 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:05.129
 way the work is not a search 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:08.790
 aesthetics is a search for meaning in the 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.680
 the biotic goal the people who pass them 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.840
 are summoned for the job they are 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.020
 part of the UN 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.570
 design is of biotype he has it 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.710
 it happens the following way I 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.470
 I developed a series of paintings that 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.450
 were placed in the city made in the 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.630
 The city obviously painted 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.700
 town and expect a camera 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:41.850
 by the interaction of people with that 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:43.140
 paint the ossuary the raw material used 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.960
 at work 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.939
 the place where the work happens is so 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.619
 important as the speech I 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.930
 I transformed a tunnel that was a space 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.659
 dedicated exclusively to automobile 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:57.240
 a catacomb made as follows 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.340
 the walls covered with soot I 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.070
 simply remove this soot using 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:05.340
 a cloth and drawing and thousands of skulls 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.600
 along 300 meters of tunnel is the 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.300
 ossuary also a work that speaks 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.160
 much about the issue of crime because the 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.920
 graphite is practically 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.900
 whole world as a crime because of the 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.950
 you add ink over a 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.080
 surface 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:21.599
 crime is not in writing in the city the 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.520
 crime is in using ink and ink 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:24.930
 damaged a certain surface 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.330
 be it public or private 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:30.239
 washing of the city hall is a 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:32.370
 censorship is that the crime is not 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:34.260
 only in technology the crime is in the 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:41.430
 aesthetics the crime is in the information that 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:44.550
 you convey all the questions 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:47.190
 economic social policies 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:49.080
 You'll see in the city ​​she reflects. 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:52.130
 in são paulo more than in any 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.130
 somewhere else in the world
