sir
when<00:00:10.400> you<00:00:10.519> look<00:00:10.730> at<00:00:10.880> a<00:00:11.769> horse<00:00:12.969> naturally

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:14.110 
when you look at a horse naturally

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:16.049 
when you look at a horse naturally
moving

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:16.059 
moving

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:18.929 
moving
you<00:00:16.960> have<00:00:17.199> to<00:00:17.410> also<00:00:17.710> it's<00:00:18.340> not<00:00:18.490> just<00:00:18.550> about

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:18.939 
you have to also it's not just about

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:22.920 
you have to also it's not just about
obviously<00:00:19.900> how<00:00:20.349> the<00:00:20.410> dates<00:00:20.740> move<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:22.689> taste

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:22.930 
obviously how the dates move the taste

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:24.749 
obviously how the dates move the taste
is<00:00:23.169> obviously<00:00:23.619> very<00:00:23.859> important<00:00:24.400> in<00:00:24.430> the<00:00:24.579> water

00:00:24.749 --> 00:00:24.759 
is obviously very important in the water

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:28.019 
is obviously very important in the water
truck<00:00:25.119> the<00:00:25.270> cancer<00:00:26.310> but<00:00:27.310> also<00:00:27.520> after<00:00:27.970> the

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:28.029 
truck the cancer but also after the

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:32.759 
truck the cancer but also after the
water<00:00:28.210> uses<00:00:29.189> is<00:00:30.189> back<00:00:30.509> and<00:00:31.509> so<00:00:32.140> when<00:00:32.650> you<00:00:32.739> look

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:32.769 
water uses is back and so when you look

00:00:32.769 --> 00:00:36.270 
water uses is back and so when you look
at<00:00:33.040> the<00:00:33.129> horse<00:00:33.280> and<00:00:33.580> you<00:00:34.420> think<00:00:35.070> does<00:00:36.070> the

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:36.280 
at the horse and you think does the

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.549 
at the horse and you think does the
horse<00:00:36.460> use<00:00:36.730> it<00:00:36.879> back<00:00:37.120> you<00:00:38.050> know<00:00:38.170> how<00:00:38.350> do<00:00:38.410> you

00:00:38.549 --> 00:00:38.559 
horse use it back you know how do you

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:40.079 
horse use it back you know how do you
tell<00:00:38.860> how<00:00:39.129> do<00:00:39.190> you<00:00:39.309> know<00:00:39.489> if<00:00:39.610> a<00:00:39.699> horse<00:00:39.850> using

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:40.089 
tell how do you know if a horse using

00:00:40.089 --> 00:00:42.090 
tell how do you know if a horse using
its<00:00:40.329> back<00:00:40.480> when<00:00:40.660> its<00:00:40.780> tail<00:00:40.989> has<00:00:41.739> to<00:00:41.890> almost

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:42.100 
its back when its tail has to almost

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.090 
its back when its tail has to almost
make<00:00:42.190> a<00:00:42.309> j-shaped<00:00:42.780> like<00:00:43.780> both<00:00:44.050> ways<00:00:44.320> that

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:45.100 
make a j-shaped like both ways that

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.079 
make a j-shaped like both ways that
shows<00:00:45.400> it's<00:00:45.610> swinging

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:46.089 
shows it's swinging

00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:50.009 
shows it's swinging
evenly<00:00:46.629> I<00:00:47.470> can't<00:00:48.159> see<00:00:48.869> obviously<00:00:49.869> what's

00:00:50.009 --> 00:00:50.019 
evenly I can't see obviously what's

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:53.609 
evenly I can't see obviously what's
happening<00:00:50.440> there<00:00:50.619> but<00:00:51.809> it's<00:00:52.809> also<00:00:53.049> the<00:00:53.409> fact

00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:53.619 
happening there but it's also the fact

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:55.619 
happening there but it's also the fact
that<00:00:53.680> the<00:00:53.860> tail<00:00:54.159> swings<00:00:54.519> and<00:00:55.180> let<00:00:55.360> the<00:00:55.479> back

00:00:55.619 --> 00:00:55.629 
that the tail swings and let the back

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:58.229 
that the tail swings and let the back
lifts<00:00:56.049> up<00:00:56.439> and<00:00:56.650> down<00:00:56.830> a<00:00:56.860> little<00:00:57.129> bit<00:00:57.309> it's

00:00:58.229 --> 00:00:58.239 
lifts up and down a little bit it's

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:06.539 
lifts up and down a little bit it's
moving<00:00:58.780> in<00:00:58.960> effect

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:06.549 

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:11.069 

second<00:01:07.240> I'm<00:01:07.390> having<00:01:07.659> to<00:01:08.310> balance<00:01:09.810> make<00:01:10.810> sure

00:01:11.069 --> 00:01:11.079

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.170 

and<00:01:41.050> the<00:01:41.380> rhythm<00:01:41.560> is<00:01:41.830> good<00:01:42.040> in<00:01:42.400> the<00:01:42.550> cancer<00:01:42.970> and

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:43.180

very<00:02:00.670> nicely<00:02:03.390> and<00:02:04.390> the<00:02:05.260> counter<00:02:05.619> you<00:02:05.740> can<00:02:05.860> see

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.070 
very nicely and the counter you can see

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.880 
very nicely and the counter you can see
again<00:02:06.340> are<00:02:06.460> very<00:02:06.490> easy<00:02:07.020> and<00:02:08.020> an<00:02:08.200> uphill<00:02:08.590> horse

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
has a good shape obviously if you if you

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.290 
has a good shape obviously if you if you
buy<00:02:28.930> a<00:02:28.959> horse<00:02:29.320> it<00:02:29.500> has<00:02:29.650> a<00:02:29.680> very<00:02:29.920> fat<00:02:30.250> neck<00:02:30.520> or<00:02:31.270> a

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
straight neck this is difficult to

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.930

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
the neck looks in the good place because

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:43.500 
the neck looks in the good place because
you<00:02:40.989> need<00:02:41.230> to<00:02:41.500> be<00:02:41.770> able<00:02:42.610> to<00:02:42.820> end<00:02:43.090> up<00:02:43.239> with<00:02:43.360> the

very good reaction at his counter
and<00:03:07.320> again<00:03:07.590> look<00:03:07.800> how<00:03:07.830> mobile<00:03:08.430> when<00:03:09.030> you<00:03:09.120> ride

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:09.270 
and again look how mobile when you ride

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:11.270 
and again look how mobile when you ride
the<00:03:09.300> can't<00:03:09.660> afford<00:03:09.900> it<00:03:10.110> goes<00:03:10.230> this<00:03:10.440> say<00:03:10.650> when

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
the can't afford it goes this say when

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:12.620 
the can't afford it goes this say when

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:55.700 
you grab the top fold you still have
zero<00:03:12.660> in<00:03:12.960> the<00:03:13.020> :

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:55.710 

00:03:55.710 --> 00:04:00.080 

so<00:03:56.340> here<00:03:56.580> just<00:03:56.990> in<00:03:57.990> the<00:03:58.110> stretching<00:03:59.090> again

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
so here just in the stretching again

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.800 
so here just in the stretching again
shows<00:04:00.420> the<00:04:00.450> balls<00:04:01.370> needs<00:04:02.370> to<00:04:02.730> loosen<00:04:03.450> this

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
shows the balls needs to loosen this

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.100 
shows the balls needs to loosen this
more<00:04:04.080> needs<00:04:04.830> to<00:04:04.860> do<00:04:05.040> this<00:04:05.250> better<00:04:05.550> so<00:04:05.990> that<00:04:06.990> the

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.110 
more needs to do this better so that the

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.440 
more needs to do this better so that the
batter<00:04:07.370> when<00:04:08.370> I<00:04:08.400> think<00:04:08.700> about<00:04:08.820> is<00:04:09.150> the<00:04:09.270> net

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 
batter when I think about is the net

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.930 
batter when I think about is the net
here<00:04:09.690> he<00:04:09.870> comes<00:04:10.080> to<00:04:10.140> the<00:04:10.230> cellar<00:04:10.550> behind<00:04:11.550> the

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
here he comes to the cellar behind the

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.470 
here he comes to the cellar behind the
saddle<00:04:12.150> though<00:04:13.050> you<00:04:13.200> can<00:04:13.290> get<00:04:13.380> a<00:04:13.410> full<00:04:13.710> stretch

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 
saddle though you can get a full stretch

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:27.430 
saddle though you can get a full stretch
through<00:04:15.480> the<00:04:16.550> horse's<00:04:17.550> body

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.000 

and<00:04:27.740> of<00:04:27.860> course<00:04:28.100> if<00:04:28.760> the<00:04:29.000> horse<00:04:29.210> can<00:04:29.570> now<00:04:30.010> be

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.010 
and of course if the horse can now be

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:33.490 
and of course if the horse can now be
rideable<00:04:31.520> like<00:04:31.730> this<00:04:32.000> then<00:04:32.960> you<00:04:33.110> know<00:04:33.260> that

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:33.500 
rideable like this then you know that

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:37.420 
rideable like this then you know that
physically<00:04:34.340> and<00:04:35.260> mentally<00:04:36.260> their<00:04:37.160> horses

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:37.430 
physically and mentally their horses

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:45.790 
physically and mentally their horses
getting<00:04:37.730> relaxed<00:04:42.280> so<00:04:43.280> the<00:04:43.430> walk<00:04:44.740> this<00:04:45.740> is

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:45.800 
getting relaxed so the walk this is

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.400 
getting relaxed so the walk this is
where<00:04:46.100> the<00:04:46.250> walk<00:04:46.460> is<00:04:46.700> not<00:04:46.910> quite<00:04:47.210> so<00:04:47.240> loose<00:04:47.690> in

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:48.410 
where the walk is not quite so loose in

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:50.830 
where the walk is not quite so loose in
his<00:04:48.650> shoulders<00:04:49.130> so<00:04:49.550> some<00:04:50.240> of<00:04:50.270> the<00:04:50.420> horses<00:04:50.690> have

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:50.840 
his shoulders so some of the horses have

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.050 
his shoulders so some of the horses have
snapped<00:04:51.080> on<00:04:51.260> to<00:04:51.380> see<00:04:51.560> how<00:04:51.650> they<00:04:51.800> do<00:04:51.860> this<00:04:52.190> they

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:53.060 
snapped on to see how they do this they

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:56.830 
snapped on to see how they do this they
have<00:04:53.180> a<00:04:53.240> lot<00:04:53.270> of<00:04:53.510> shoulder<00:04:53.870> movement<00:04:54.350> and<00:04:55.840> this

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:56.840 
have a lot of shoulder movement and this

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:58.770 
have a lot of shoulder movement and this
one<00:04:57.050> needs<00:04:57.260> a<00:04:57.350> little<00:04:57.380> bit<00:04:57.680> more<00:04:57.740> reach

00:04:58.770 --> 00:04:58.780 
one needs a little bit more reach

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:01.090 
one needs a little bit more reach
through<00:04:59.780> the<00:04:59.960> shoulders<00:05:00.470> to<00:05:00.620> get<00:05:00.740> the<00:05:00.920> bigger

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:01.100 
through the shoulders to get the bigger

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:12.519 
through the shoulders to get the bigger
walk

00:05:12.519 --> 00:05:12.529 

00:05:12.529 --> 00:05:14.770 

no<00:05:13.129> sir

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:14.780 
no sir

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:21.490 
no sir
very<00:05:15.350> easy<00:05:15.830> to

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:21.500 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.140 

so<00:05:22.500> this<00:05:22.680> is<00:05:22.860> again<00:05:23.370> you<00:05:23.580> know<00:05:23.610> horse<00:05:23.940> that

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:36.710 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:41.120

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:43.710 
know he looks mature as well when you

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:45.440 
know he looks mature as well when you
think<00:05:43.920> of<00:05:44.040> some<00:05:44.190> of<00:05:44.280> the<00:05:44.340> horses<00:05:44.760> that<00:05:44.970> we've

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:45.450 
think of some of the horses that we've

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:47.150 
think of some of the horses that we've
seen<00:05:45.660> that<00:05:45.840> honors<00:05:46.140> not<00:05:46.170> sure<00:05:46.440> this<00:05:46.680> one<00:05:46.860> looks

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:47.160

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:50.070 
mature to me and will be a very good

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:52.880 
mature to me and will be a very good
picture<00:05:50.310> when<00:05:50.940> he's<00:05:51.120> learned<00:05:51.360> to<00:05:51.480> push<00:05:51.830> on<00:05:52.830> to

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:52.890 
picture when he's learned to push on to

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:55.220 
picture when he's learned to push on to
the<00:05:53.130> bit<00:05:53.400> so<00:05:54.000> that's<00:05:54.360> still<00:05:54.660> what<00:05:54.840> he<00:05:54.930> needs<00:05:55.140> to

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:55.230 
the bit so that's still what he needs to

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:56.660 
the bit so that's still what he needs to
learn<00:05:55.320> to<00:05:55.380> do<00:05:55.680> more<00:05:55.710> especially<00:05:56.160> in<00:05:56.370> the<00:05:56.460> trap

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:56.670 
learn to do more especially in the trap

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:59.240 
learn to do more especially in the trap
more<00:05:57.210> contact<00:05:57.690> to<00:05:57.780> go<00:05:57.900> uphill<00:05:58.110> canter<00:05:59.040> feels

00:05:59.240 --> 00:05:59.250 
more contact to go uphill canter feels

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:00.650 
more contact to go uphill canter feels
great<00:05:59.520> and<00:05:59.730> the<00:05:59.820> walk<00:05:59.970> still<00:06:00.240> needs<00:06:00.450> to<00:06:00.540> be<00:06:00.630> a

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:00.660 
great and the walk still needs to be a

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:03.080 
great and the walk still needs to be a
little<00:06:00.870> bit<00:06:00.990> looser<00:06:01.370> but<00:06:02.370> I<00:06:02.430> write<00:06:02.700> a<00:06:02.730> very

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:03.090 
little bit looser but I write a very

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:07.330 
little bit looser but I write a very
viable<00:06:03.330> horse<00:06:03.750> again<00:06:04.110> so<00:06:04.910> certainly<00:06:06.020> eight

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:07.340 
viable horse again so certainly eight

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:10.460 
viable horse again so certainly eight
for<00:06:08.340> the<00:06:08.430> ride<00:06:08.610> ability<00:06:09.240> and<00:06:09.510> you<00:06:10.110> need<00:06:10.320> to

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:10.470 
for the ride ability and you need to

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:12.250 
for the ride ability and you need to
still<00:06:10.710> be<00:06:10.800> a<00:06:10.860> bit<00:06:11.160> quicker<00:06:11.280> on<00:06:11.490> my<00:06:11.520> legs<00:06:11.850> and

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:12.260 
still be a bit quicker on my legs and

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:16.340 
still be a bit quicker on my legs and
just<00:06:13.430> so<00:06:14.430> that<00:06:14.460> we<00:06:14.730> can<00:06:14.940> do<00:06:15.630> the<00:06:15.780> motivation

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:16.350 
just so that we can do the motivation

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:19.070 
just so that we can do the motivation
with<00:06:16.470> the<00:06:16.560> hind<00:06:16.740> leg<00:06:16.920> and<00:06:17.180> an<00:06:18.180> aid<00:06:18.390> for<00:06:18.420> his<00:06:18.780> and

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:19.080 
with the hind leg and an aid for his and

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:21.890 
with the hind leg and an aid for his and
potentially<00:06:19.620> as<00:06:19.710> well
