00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.930 
clearwater to start off with its way
more<00:00:41.920> sensitive<00:00:42.730> than<00:00:42.940> then<00:00:43.720> monofilament<00:00:44.590> or

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
more sensitive than then monofilament or

copolymer line and in doing so in doing

copolymer line and in doing so in doing
that<00:00:48.640> you<00:00:49.420> get<00:00:49.600> you<00:00:49.720> more<00:00:49.840> bites<00:00:50.790> you<00:00:51.790> know<00:00:51.910> it

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:52.420 
that you get you more bites you know it

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.450 
that you get you more bites you know it
has<00:00:52.660> less<00:00:52.900> stretch<00:00:53.260> so<00:00:53.770> you<00:00:53.829> get<00:00:54.010> better<00:00:54.190> hook

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:54.460 
has less stretch so you get better hook

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.780 
has less stretch so you get better hook
sets<00:00:54.730> and<00:00:55.740> you<00:00:56.740> know<00:00:56.829> i<00:00:56.890> think<00:00:57.490> the<00:00:57.579> biggest

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:57.790 
sets and you know i think the biggest

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.030 
sets and you know i think the biggest
key<00:00:58.150> for<00:00:58.510> me<00:00:58.630> though<00:00:58.840> is<00:00:59.079> the<00:00:59.230> sensitivity<00:00:59.890> it

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:00.040 
key for me though is the sensitivity it

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:01.380 
key for me though is the sensitivity it
provides<00:01:00.430> it's<00:01:00.640> almost<00:01:00.790> like<00:01:00.970> you're<00:01:01.060> fishing

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:01.390 
provides it's almost like you're fishing

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:05.550 
provides it's almost like you're fishing
a<00:01:01.480> braid<00:01:02.020> or<00:01:02.290> a<00:01:02.320> super<00:01:02.650> line<00:01:02.850> but<00:01:03.850> it's<00:01:04.560> it's

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:05.560 
a braid or a super line but it's it's

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.910 
a braid or a super line but it's it's
invisible<00:01:06.659> stuff<00:01:07.659> is<00:01:07.840> fantastic<00:01:08.079> i<00:01:08.590> use<00:01:08.770> it

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:08.920

generally<00:01:52.929> do<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:54.520> reason<00:01:54.850> being<00:01:54.880> is<00:01:55.389> that<00:01:55.420> it

00:01:55.919 --> 00:01:55.929 
generally do the reason being is that it

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:59.399 
generally do the reason being is that it
has<00:01:56.109> no<00:01:56.380> stretch<00:01:57.090> and<00:01:58.090> the<00:01:58.719> power<00:01:58.959> you<00:01:59.229> get

has no stretch and the power you get

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:04.230 
has no stretch and the power you get
with<00:01:59.649> it<00:01:59.679> is<00:02:01.799> incomparable<00:02:02.909> incomparable<00:02:03.909> to

anything and you know I throw this line

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:10.980 
anything and you know I throw this line
when<00:02:08.860> flip<00:02:09.640> in<00:02:09.850> you<00:02:10.479> know<00:02:10.570> matted<00:02:10.960> vegetation

long cast with like a zara spook or you
know<00:02:20.920> a<00:02:20.950> vixen<00:02:22.260> things<00:02:23.260> of<00:02:23.380> that<00:02:23.500> nature<00:02:23.580> I've

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
know a vixen things of that nature I've

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:26.430 
know a vixen things of that nature I've
experimented<00:02:24.940> with<00:02:25.600> a<00:02:25.660> little<00:02:25.990> bit<00:02:26.170> throwing

experimented with a little bit throwing
you<00:02:26.680> know<00:02:26.770> smaller<00:02:27.100> popping<00:02:28.030> baits<00:02:28.210> like

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
you know smaller popping baits like

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.430 
you know smaller popping baits like
Rico's<00:02:28.780> or<00:02:29.200> pop<00:02:29.860> ours<00:02:30.100> and<00:02:30.340> things<00:02:30.580> like<00:02:30.700> that

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
Rico's or pop ours and things like that

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.230 
Rico's or pop ours and things like that
you<00:02:32.440> know<00:02:32.530> the<00:02:33.250> thing<00:02:33.280> the<00:02:33.700> thing<00:02:33.730> about<00:02:34.060> it

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:34.240 
you know the thing the thing about it

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.360 
you know the thing the thing about it
why<00:02:34.840> it<00:02:34.900> makes<00:02:35.110> it<00:02:35.290> so<00:02:35.410> good<00:02:35.590> for<00:02:35.800> top<00:02:36.010> waters

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
why it makes it so good for top waters

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.790 
why it makes it so good for top waters
because<00:02:36.700> it<00:02:36.850> floats<00:02:37.150> and<00:02:37.720> a<00:02:37.810> long<00:02:38.170> cast<00:02:38.500> with

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
because it floats and a long cast with

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.100 
because it floats and a long cast with
no<00:02:39.010> stretch<00:02:39.370> you<00:02:40.000> get<00:02:40.180> an<00:02:40.270> instant<00:02:40.690> hook<00:02:40.870> set

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
no stretch you get an instant hook set

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.890 
no stretch you get an instant hook set
into<00:02:41.470> that<00:02:41.620> fish<00:02:42.060> you<00:02:43.060> have<00:02:43.209> to<00:02:43.330> compare<00:02:43.690> you

abrasive situation this line is going to

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:37.670

get you out of it it's basically the the

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:40.989 
clear version of a braided line you know

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:42.539 
clear version of a braided line you know
doesn't<00:03:41.200> have<00:03:41.410> the<00:03:41.560> ultimate<00:03:41.709> strength<00:03:42.280> like

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:42.549 
doesn't have the ultimate strength like

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:45.840 
doesn't have the ultimate strength like
this<00:03:42.700> is<00:03:42.850> 17<00:03:43.299> pound<00:03:43.570> test<00:03:43.840> I<00:03:44.640> think<00:03:45.640> it<00:03:45.700> has<00:03:45.790> a

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:45.850 
this is 17 pound test I think it has a

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:48.900 
this is 17 pound test I think it has a
braking<00:03:46.329> power<00:03:46.510> of<00:03:47.010> 27<00:03:48.010> pounds<00:03:48.190> something

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
braking power of 27 pounds something

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:51.060 
braking power of 27 pounds something
like<00:03:49.030> that<00:03:49.060> whereas<00:03:49.660> you<00:03:50.200> know<00:03:50.230> a<00:03:50.320> braided

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:51.070 
like that whereas you know a braided

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:55.350 
like that whereas you know a braided
line<00:03:51.220> will<00:03:51.489> break<00:03:52.150> at<00:03:52.329> 80<00:03:52.660> so<00:03:53.530> in<00:03:54.400> saying<00:03:55.090> that

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:55.360 
line will break at 80 so in saying that

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.360 
line will break at 80 so in saying that
though<00:03:55.630> you're<00:03:56.320> gaining<00:03:56.950> some<00:03:57.190> of<00:03:57.310> the

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
tendencies with braided line in that

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:03.150

it's<00:04:00.670> super<00:04:00.910> abrasive<00:04:01.390> resistant<00:04:01.870> and<00:04:02.130> with<00:04:03.130> a

good quality line like this it still has

good quality line like this it still has
a<00:04:05.350> sensitivity<00:04:05.980> but<00:04:06.820> what<00:04:07.030> you<00:04:07.150> do<00:04:07.329> gain<00:04:07.570> with
