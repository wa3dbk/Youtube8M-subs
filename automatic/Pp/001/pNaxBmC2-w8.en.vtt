00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
much of this though it depends on the

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.130 
much of this though it depends on the
brand<00:00:28.529> that<00:00:28.769> you're<00:00:28.890> using<00:00:29.189> but<00:00:30.090> the<00:00:30.539> gel<00:00:30.810> food

very<00:00:35.640> dark<00:00:36.510> in<00:00:36.899> color<00:00:37.110> so<00:00:37.770> just<00:00:38.040> don't<00:00:38.219> add<00:00:38.399> as

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
very dark in color so just don't add as

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.220 
very dark in color so just don't add as
much<00:00:38.820> but<00:00:39.149> if<00:00:39.270> you're<00:00:39.420> using<00:00:39.600> a<00:00:39.809> water-based

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.510 
you can continue to hand mixer that's
fine<00:00:48.180> if<00:00:49.050> you'd<00:00:49.379> like<00:00:49.590> to<00:00:49.950> speed<00:00:50.219> up<00:00:50.399> the

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
so I'd say we're done now

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.109 
so I'd say we're done now
and<00:02:01.110> we<00:02:01.469> haven't<00:02:01.829> over<00:02:02.130> mix<00:02:02.340> because<00:02:02.729> it<00:02:02.820> still

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
and we haven't over mix because it still

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.600 
and we haven't over mix because it still
holds<00:02:03.479> its<00:02:03.600> shape<00:02:03.659> quite<00:02:04.619> well<00:02:04.890> and<00:02:05.100> that's

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
holds its shape quite well and that's

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:06.940 
holds its shape quite well and that's
going<00:02:05.850> to<00:02:05.939> be<00:02:06.060> ideal

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
going to be ideal

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.680 
going to be ideal

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
like to start from the center and just

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:40.780 
like to start from the center and just
pipe<00:02:33.700> your<00:02:34.700> frosting<00:02:35.620> like<00:02:36.620> so<00:02:39.430> and<00:02:40.430> you<00:02:40.580> can

really<00:02:43.730> well<00:02:44.060> and<00:02:44.680> that's<00:02:45.680> because<00:02:46.160> we've

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
really well and that's because we've

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:51.370 
really well and that's because we've
added<00:02:46.579> lots<00:02:47.569> of<00:02:47.780> air<00:02:48.200> to<00:02:48.590> it<00:02:49.900> so<00:02:50.900> once<00:02:51.170> you've

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 
added lots of air to it so once you've

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.430 
added lots of air to it so once you've
done<00:02:51.560> your<00:02:51.799> first<00:02:51.829> layer<00:02:52.519> I<00:02:53.079> like<00:02:54.079> to<00:02:54.260> add<00:02:54.410> some

love<00:03:00.980> doing<00:03:01.430> this<00:03:01.760> hiding<00:03:02.480> textures<00:03:03.049> and

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
love doing this hiding textures and

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.380 
love doing this hiding textures and
flavors<00:03:03.650> in<00:03:03.799> between<00:03:04.130> layers<00:03:04.340> and<00:03:04.760> because<00:03:05.299> I

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
flavors in between layers and because I

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:08.350 
flavors in between layers and because I
didn't<00:03:05.780> make<00:03:05.930> my<00:03:06.280> Rose<00:03:07.280> cheesecake<00:03:07.910> frosting

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360 
didn't make my Rose cheesecake frosting

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.080 
didn't make my Rose cheesecake frosting
too<00:03:08.569> sweet<00:03:08.900> either<00:03:09.200> the<00:03:09.980> meringue<00:03:10.340> just<00:03:10.790> gives

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
too sweet either the meringue just gives

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.520 
too sweet either the meringue just gives
it<00:03:11.299> that<00:03:11.329> little<00:03:11.930> burst<00:03:12.400> burst<00:03:13.400> of<00:03:13.670> sweetness

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
it that little burst burst of sweetness

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.840 
it that little burst burst of sweetness
so<00:03:15.530> now<00:03:15.739> that<00:03:15.950> you've<00:03:16.069> finished<00:03:16.250> your<00:03:16.489> first

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:16.850 
so now that you've finished your first

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:19.390 
so now that you've finished your first
layer<00:03:17.209> we<00:03:17.600> can<00:03:17.720> add<00:03:17.900> our<00:03:18.019> second<00:03:18.470> layer<00:03:18.590> so

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
layer we can add our second layer so

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.129 
layer we can add our second layer so
just<00:03:19.730> very<00:03:19.850> gently<00:03:20.299> pick<00:03:20.600> it<00:03:20.690> up<00:03:20.810> because<00:03:20.989> you

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:21.139 
just very gently pick it up because you

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:24.309 
just very gently pick it up because you
don't<00:03:21.230> want<00:03:21.530> the<00:03:21.709> cake<00:03:21.889> to<00:03:21.920> split<00:03:22.430> and<00:03:23.319> slowly

00:03:24.309 --> 00:03:24.319

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
position it on top be careful not to

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:29.050 
position it on top be careful not to
squeeze<00:03:27.620> it<00:03:27.889> through<00:03:27.920> otherwise<00:03:28.519> that<00:03:28.970> will

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
squeeze it through otherwise that will

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.479 
squeeze it through otherwise that will
push<00:03:29.329> all<00:03:29.569> of<00:03:29.630> your<00:03:29.900> frosting<00:03:30.200> out<00:03:30.920> of<00:03:31.190> layers

will<00:03:33.980> just<00:03:34.160> settle<00:03:34.400> itself<00:03:34.880> with<00:03:35.090> the<00:03:35.209> weight

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:35.389 
will just settle itself with the weight

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:39.190 
will just settle itself with the weight
of<00:03:35.420> the<00:03:35.720> layers<00:03:36.019> so<00:03:36.230> don't<00:03:36.859> push<00:03:37.130> it<00:03:37.160> down

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200
