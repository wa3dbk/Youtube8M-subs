00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:03.389 
hello again it's Mike's phone and tablet

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:06.650 
hello again it's Mike's phone and tablet
support<00:00:03.770> thank<00:00:04.770> you<00:00:04.890> for<00:00:05.040> coming<00:00:05.190> back<00:00:05.660> last

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
support thank you for coming back last

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.150 
support thank you for coming back last
time<00:00:06.810> if<00:00:07.020> you<00:00:07.140> recall<00:00:07.470> i<00:00:07.529> talked<00:00:07.890> about<00:00:08.010> how

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
time if you recall i talked about how

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.089 
time if you recall i talked about how
you<00:00:08.309> can<00:00:08.490> save<00:00:08.670> battery<00:00:09.120> on<00:00:09.330> your<00:00:09.360> blackberry

00:00:10.089 --> 00:00:10.099 
you can save battery on your blackberry

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:11.930 
you can save battery on your blackberry
now<00:00:11.099> i'm<00:00:11.219> going<00:00:11.370> to<00:00:11.429> be<00:00:11.519> talking<00:00:11.670> about

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
now i'm going to be talking about

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.820 
now i'm going to be talking about
something<00:00:12.150> a<00:00:12.300> little<00:00:12.450> bit<00:00:12.599> different<00:00:13.110> it's

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
something a little bit different it's

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.340 
something a little bit different it's
going<00:00:14.070> to<00:00:14.130> be<00:00:14.400> a<00:00:14.820> little<00:00:15.750> bit<00:00:15.960> more<00:00:16.080> technical

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
going to be a little bit more technical

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.769 
going to be a little bit more technical
i<00:00:16.619> guess<00:00:16.830> you<00:00:16.920> could<00:00:17.070> say<00:00:17.279> at<00:00:17.520> that<00:00:18.000> term<00:00:18.420> in

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
i guess you could say at that term in

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.630 
i guess you could say at that term in
particular<00:00:19.350> you<00:00:19.529> may<00:00:19.650> have<00:00:19.770> heard<00:00:20.010> when<00:00:20.550> it

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
particular you may have heard when it

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:21.950 
particular you may have heard when it
comes<00:00:20.850> to<00:00:21.060> phones<00:00:21.240> and<00:00:21.390> tablets<00:00:21.779> that<00:00:21.840> you

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
comes to phones and tablets that you

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.410 
comes to phones and tablets that you
might<00:00:22.109> not<00:00:22.199> know<00:00:22.439> about<00:00:22.590> so<00:00:23.090> we<00:00:24.090> talk<00:00:24.300> about

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
might not know about so we talk about

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.019 
might not know about so we talk about
that<00:00:24.570> today<00:00:24.810> as<00:00:25.140> you've<00:00:25.590> probably<00:00:25.710> noticed<00:00:26.029> my

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
that today as you've probably noticed my

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.919 
that today as you've probably noticed my
computer<00:00:28.019> or<00:00:28.800> my<00:00:29.390> video<00:00:30.390> cameras<00:00:30.720> caught<00:00:30.900> a

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
computer or my video cameras caught a

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.950 
computer or my video cameras caught a
little<00:00:31.109> more<00:00:31.230> clear<00:00:31.470> i<00:00:31.740> I'm<00:00:32.250> using<00:00:32.520> a<00:00:32.960> camera

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
little more clear i I'm using a camera

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.860 
little more clear i I'm using a camera
high<00:00:34.380> def<00:00:34.620> camera<00:00:35.010> webcam<00:00:35.309> this<00:00:35.730> time<00:00:35.940> so<00:00:36.210> if

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
high def camera webcam this time so if

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.330 
high def camera webcam this time so if
they<00:00:37.110> look<00:00:37.230> a<00:00:37.320> little<00:00:37.410> better<00:00:37.620> so<00:00:37.980> hopefully

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
they look a little better so hopefully

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.049 
they look a little better so hopefully
you<00:00:38.460> guys<00:00:38.579> enjoy<00:00:38.969> that<00:00:39.950> anyway<00:00:40.969> let's<00:00:41.969> get

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
you guys enjoy that anyway let's get

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.670 
you guys enjoy that anyway let's get
right<00:00:42.239> into<00:00:42.300> it<00:00:42.570> the<00:00:42.960> subject<00:00:43.410> i'm<00:00:43.500> going<00:00:43.620> to

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
right into it the subject i'm going to

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.880 
right into it the subject i'm going to
be<00:00:43.739> talking<00:00:43.950> about<00:00:44.250> today<00:00:44.460> is<00:00:45.710> single<00:00:46.710> core

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
be talking about today is single core

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.200 
be talking about today is single core
and<00:00:47.219> dual<00:00:47.489> core<00:00:47.820> processors<00:00:48.719> so<00:00:49.620> i<00:00:50.210> made

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
and dual core processors so i made

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.450 
and dual core processors so i made
certainly<00:00:51.539> going<00:00:51.629> to<00:00:51.719> say<00:00:51.960> tell<00:00:52.800> you<00:00:52.829> what<00:00:53.340> the

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
certainly going to say tell you what the

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.450 
certainly going to say tell you what the
difference<00:00:53.850> is<00:00:54.030> and<00:00:54.559> why<00:00:55.559> you<00:00:55.620> may<00:00:55.890> choose<00:00:56.129> one

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
difference is and why you may choose one

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.639 
difference is and why you may choose one
or<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.610> over<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.120> other<00:00:57.300> pretty<00:00:57.629> much<00:00:57.840> so

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
or the over the other pretty much so

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.720 
or the over the other pretty much so
when<00:00:59.039> it<00:00:59.160> comes<00:00:59.309> down<00:00:59.609> to<00:00:59.850> it<00:01:00.350> single<00:01:01.350> core

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:01.730 
when it comes down to it single core

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.189 
when it comes down to it single core
processors<00:01:02.730> are<00:01:02.969> not<00:01:03.359> going<00:01:03.510> to<00:01:03.600> need<00:01:03.719> fast<00:01:03.989> as

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
processors are not going to need fast as

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.090 
processors are not going to need fast as
dual<00:01:04.409> core<00:01:04.710> processors<00:01:06.140> basically<00:01:07.140> dual<00:01:07.590> core

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
dual core processors basically dual core

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.780 
dual core processors basically dual core
means<00:01:08.430> to<00:01:08.760> those<00:01:09.150> two<00:01:09.920> cores<00:01:10.920> or<00:01:11.159> processors

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
means to those two cores or processors

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.330 
means to those two cores or processors
going<00:01:12.000> at<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.180> same<00:01:12.390> time<00:01:13.340> therefore<00:01:14.340> making

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
going at the same time therefore making

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.280 
going at the same time therefore making
applications<00:01:17.340> run<00:01:17.880> easier<00:01:18.450> and<00:01:18.630> smoother<00:01:19.080> and

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
applications run easier and smoother and

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.160 
applications run easier and smoother and
you<00:01:19.680> can<00:01:19.830> run<00:01:19.979> more<00:01:20.220> of<00:01:20.400> them<00:01:20.840> so<00:01:21.840> this<00:01:22.020> will

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
you can run more of them so this will

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.749 
you can run more of them so this will
come<00:01:22.320> in<00:01:22.350> handy<00:01:22.470> if<00:01:22.979> you<00:01:23.189> like<00:01:23.369> to<00:01:23.549> play<00:01:23.670> games

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
come in handy if you like to play games

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.999 
come in handy if you like to play games
on<00:01:24.420> your<00:01:24.479> phone<00:01:24.900> or<00:01:25.350> tablet<00:01:25.380> if<00:01:25.799> you<00:01:25.860> play

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
on your phone or tablet if you play

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.060 
on your phone or tablet if you play
games<00:01:26.340> a<00:01:26.610> dual<00:01:27.150> core<00:01:27.360> processor<00:01:27.560> move<00:01:28.560> on<00:01:28.740> your

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
games a dual core processor move on your

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.210 
games a dual core processor move on your
game<00:01:29.250> smoother<00:01:30.290> if<00:01:31.290> you<00:01:31.439> run<00:01:31.650> a<00:01:31.680> lot<00:01:31.799> of

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
game smoother if you run a lot of

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.550 
game smoother if you run a lot of
applications<00:01:32.640> at<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:32.970> same<00:01:33.180> time<00:01:33.390> a<00:01:33.780> dual

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
applications at the same time a dual

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.380 
applications at the same time a dual
core<00:01:34.799> processor<00:01:34.850> will<00:01:35.850> run<00:01:36.000> all<00:01:36.240> these

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
core processor will run all these

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.140 
core processor will run all these
applications<00:01:37.430> smoother<00:01:38.430> at<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.670> same<00:01:38.880> time

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
applications smoother at the same time

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.990 
applications smoother at the same time
and<00:01:39.540> it<00:01:40.530> also<00:01:40.740> is<00:01:41.070> more<00:01:41.280> efficient<00:01:41.729> on<00:01:41.880> your

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
and it also is more efficient on your

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.359 
and it also is more efficient on your
battery<00:01:42.420> life<00:01:42.450> too<00:01:42.899> so<00:01:43.259> you<00:01:43.770> can<00:01:43.890> actually<00:01:44.040> run

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
battery life too so you can actually run

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.010 
battery life too so you can actually run
more<00:01:44.670> stuff<00:01:45.060> in<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.329> background<00:01:45.540> without

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
more stuff in the background without

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.389 
more stuff in the background without
using<00:01:46.290> much<00:01:46.560> better<00:01:46.860> so<00:01:48.680> now<00:01:49.680> a<00:01:49.710> dual<00:01:50.130> core

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
using much better so now a dual core

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.330 
using much better so now a dual core
processor<00:01:50.430> phone<00:01:51.329> will<00:01:52.200> run<00:01:52.829> you<00:01:52.979> a<00:01:53.009> little

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
processor phone will run you a little

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.120 
processor phone will run you a little
bit<00:01:53.430> more<00:01:53.640> money<00:01:54.380> but<00:01:55.380> with<00:01:55.560> quad<00:01:55.860> core

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
bit more money but with quad core

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.209 
bit more money but with quad core
processing<00:01:56.750> for<00:01:57.750> core<00:01:57.990> processing<00:01:58.530> right

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
processing for core processing right

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.270 
processing for core processing right
around<00:01:59.460> the<00:01:59.610> corner<00:02:00.409> the<00:02:01.409> prices<00:02:01.710> for<00:02:01.920> dual

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
around the corner the prices for dual

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.609 
around the corner the prices for dual
core<00:02:02.579> will<00:02:02.790> probably<00:02:03.450> going<00:02:03.689> down<00:02:03.869> soon<00:02:04.200> so

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
core will probably going down soon so

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.410 
core will probably going down soon so
i'll<00:02:05.520> probably<00:02:05.700> have<00:02:05.850> to<00:02:05.909> have<00:02:06.060> a<00:02:06.090> video<00:02:06.360> about

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
i'll probably have to have a video about

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.199 
i'll probably have to have a video about
quad<00:02:06.750> core<00:02:07.020> processing<00:02:07.500> pretty<00:02:07.860> soon

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209 
quad core processing pretty soon

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:11.570 
quad core processing pretty soon
basically<00:02:09.209> the<00:02:09.360> more<00:02:09.739> processors<00:02:10.739> are<00:02:10.890> course

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
basically the more processors are course

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.170 
basically the more processors are course
you<00:02:11.760> have<00:02:11.910> going<00:02:12.180> on

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
you have going on

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:14.880 
you have going on
the<00:02:13.359> smoother<00:02:13.810> gets<00:02:14.079> the<00:02:14.200> quicker<00:02:14.469> it<00:02:14.590> gets

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
the smoother gets the quicker it gets

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.280 
the smoother gets the quicker it gets
and<00:02:15.219> I<00:02:16.060> just<00:02:16.090> you<00:02:16.390> know<00:02:16.450> it's<00:02:16.689> nicer<00:02:17.140> a<00:02:17.170> little

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
and I just you know it's nicer a little

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.550 
and I just you know it's nicer a little
bit<00:02:17.500> snappier<00:02:18.040> experience<00:02:18.730> so<00:02:19.379> I'm<00:02:20.379> in

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
bit snappier experience so I'm in

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.020 
bit snappier experience so I'm in
conclusion<00:02:20.920> basically<00:02:21.549> if<00:02:21.640> you<00:02:21.730> play<00:02:21.879> a<00:02:21.909> lot

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
conclusion basically if you play a lot

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:23.490 
conclusion basically if you play a lot
of<00:02:22.180> games<00:02:22.390> you<00:02:22.599> run<00:02:22.780> a<00:02:22.810> lot<00:02:22.900> of<00:02:23.049> applications

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
of games you run a lot of applications

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.490 
of games you run a lot of applications
at<00:02:23.859> the<00:02:23.920> same<00:02:24.129> time<00:02:25.140> also<00:02:26.140> if<00:02:26.200> you<00:02:26.230> want<00:02:26.439> to

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.220 
at the same time also if you want to
save<00:02:26.650> battery<00:02:27.390> doing<00:02:28.390> all<00:02:28.540> these<00:02:28.689> things<00:02:28.750> a

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
save battery doing all these things a

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.069 
save battery doing all these things a
dual<00:02:29.889> core<00:02:30.129> processor<00:02:30.389> will<00:02:31.389> be<00:02:31.719> very

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:32.079
