00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.159
 which anyway 

00:00:13.159 --> 00:00:15.199
 i 

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:18.850
 the reality will not be in the lido now what the one that changes 

00:00:19.499 --> 00:00:20.310
 do not forgive 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:21.310
 It has been sold 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:22.689
 dear right-handed 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:24.630
 kikillo 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.970
 with intelligence does not change 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:30.050
 which would be an absurd 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:31.699
 think about it 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:34.699
 nothing of that rafael run two hands 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.430
 and we understood at that time 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:44.250
 that the two-handed Bolocco trailer, both in CÃ¡diz and destiny, is 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.550
 say that the two sides were changing the hand 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.550
 but as I saw that I hit harder than expected 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.929
 we understood that that was the break 

00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:57.079
 unnatural his left hand was the dominant hit 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:01.780
 then at the time of taking out 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.200
 colon in fact did not do it well 

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:09.170
 the primary optometrist-elementary school at that maximum does not assign new 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.420
 record 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:12.380
 but 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:14.320
 what happened 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:15.600
 the idea is that 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.580
 I could have followed two hands 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.990
 because played goes to the teeth 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.340
 more or less 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.660
 when his adversary 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.000
 in the circuit that sew two hands 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
 only one santoro track of 30 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:34.890
 I already told rafael 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.870
 how much stop trans April 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:39.680
 that came to two modes all 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.990
 I think you have fulfilled us 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:43.260
 it suits us 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:44.479
 to change and 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:46.290
 And from that moment on 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.430
 why we change and start doing the process 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:50.920
 3 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.920
 on the left side in what we started to do as normal 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.100
 the change occurred 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.700
 occurred in a manner 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.860
 progressively we are 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:01.480
 not playing 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:02.790
 twenty minutes 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.950
 we play due dates with the hand 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.010
 and then 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:08.099
 the rest with both 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.039
 after two weeks 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:12.339
 we add a little more time 

00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:15.839
 until the vice speaker this tornado was more comfortable 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:20.199
 and so he continued 

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:23.199
 and in that local tournament 

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:27.309
 very difficult because 

00:02:30.859 --> 00:02:34.019
 and so this is one of what is 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:36.349
 It is true that he is right-handed for everything 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:38.599
 the curious 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:42.989
 if you throw a ball before you take it with your right hand if you write and it was issued 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:44.369
 teeth 

00:02:44.369 --> 00:02:47.369
 anything he does with 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:53.370
 it will not be the best has been in mistakes in Iran since August 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.499
 podium tbm 

00:02:55.499 --> 00:02:56.980
 if we had given that resignation
