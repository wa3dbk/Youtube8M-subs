00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.560
 hi guys today i'll show you how or 

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:08.480
 filmed my laptop for how long 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:11.960
 regards the film there are several 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:13.850
 different colors textures and if you want in 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:17.240
 especially this plot that I chose 

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:19.600
 I in carbon 4 find the link 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:22.789
 in the description of this video 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:25.130
 obviously what we will need the 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:29.560
 portable film a cutter e 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:34.340
 the fano if it is possible however better 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:39.980
 peel back with lo 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:43.340
 top screen and of course to speed up 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:47.230
 I did it all on my computer 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:48.899
 completely disassembled 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.220
 It is possible to do so even without 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.960
 it is mandatory to disassemble it only 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:55.230
 you have to spend more time for the 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.230
 finishes 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:04.840
 so before using go to 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:08.500
 applying the film is important 

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:11.000
 clean the surface of your computer 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:14.619
 I also advise you to take one 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.630
 Micro-perforated film so that it does not 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:18.530
 other ugly signs remain because if 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.369
 purchased just those films 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.869
 Chinese estimates very cheap when 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:26.950
 go and apply it they will form 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:31.190
 lots of bubbles 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:33.800
 obviously the shell of a man 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:36.560
 portable and very very simple indeed 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:38.960
 if you do not plan on mostly mostly 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:42.170
 right we do n't need anyway 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.060
 shape the truth 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:47.630
 obviously I remind you that for the 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:50.060
 cure the points where there are curves or 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.610
 forms we say not flat this that 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.950
 see in the video mass anyway 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.860
 warm up well 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.620
 the film 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:04.720
 you can see e 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:07.830
 it was therefore simple to apply it too 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.830
 without the fund 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.030
 obviously when 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.520
 if you are not able to attract it well 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:19.250
 however, in some contexts I recommend it 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:23.260
 that at 0 as you can see is 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.260
 still present a bubble 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.170
 also what I recommend is 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:31.349
 have a lot of patience and don't go by 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:34.310
 hurry because in a hurry you will do 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:36.480
 definitely a lot of trouble 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:40.219
 therefore having to waste more film 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.219
 and repeat the procedure 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:47.760
 I recommend spending a little bit in 

00:02:44.639 --> 00:02:50.370
 more to take a good film and 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:53.430
 especially I recommend the 3m or 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:56.819
 I used this one again 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:58.950
 also that in the description of this 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:00.169
 video I left the link to 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.450
 film 

00:03:00.169 --> 00:03:06.629
 if I am not mistaken, it comes 6 euros and is a 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:12.290
 meter by 30 centimeters then there 

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:12.290
 you can still do 45 laptops 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:42.050
 no 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:23.889
 with me 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:47.699
 Well 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:47.699
 Well 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:08.880
 as you can see I have finished and I live alone 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:13.250
 waste some time doing the last ones 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:13.250
 touch-ups in the most delicate parts 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:19.550
 who is it 

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:22.669
 I repeat that for any doubt 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:24.889
 question you can leave a comment 

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:27.529
 I also strongly recommend you 

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:30.919
 subscribe to the facebook and al 

00:05:27.529 --> 00:05:34.120
 video channel in shape for a greeting a 

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:34.120
 all and the next 

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:03.090
 Yup 

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:17.020
 In me 

00:06:27.889 --> 00:06:30.729
 Well 

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:35.870
 no 

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:53.020
 Well 

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:56.540
