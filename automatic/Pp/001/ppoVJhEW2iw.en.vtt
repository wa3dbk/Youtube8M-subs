a<00:00:12.230> plan<00:00:13.230> a<00:00:14.540> work<00:00:15.540> ethic<00:00:15.809> and<00:00:16.440> some<00:00:16.800> money

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:17.060 
a plan a work ethic and some money

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.450 
a plan a work ethic and some money
that's<00:00:18.060> it<00:00:18.590> you<00:00:19.590> know<00:00:19.710> I<00:00:19.920> know<00:00:20.039> it<00:00:20.310> sounds

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
that's it you know I know it sounds

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.269 
that's it you know I know it sounds
overly<00:00:21.359> simplistic<00:00:21.840> but<00:00:22.830> that's<00:00:23.070> the<00:00:23.250> thing

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
overly simplistic but that's the thing

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.140 
overly simplistic but that's the thing
and<00:00:24.019> then<00:00:25.310> money<00:00:26.310> is<00:00:26.460> not<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:26.820> biggest

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
and then money is not the biggest

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.099 
and then money is not the biggest
problem<00:00:27.710> is<00:00:28.710> that<00:00:28.980> work<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:30.150> word<00:00:30.359> that<00:00:30.630> a<00:00:30.660> the

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
problem is that work the word that a the

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.680 
problem is that work the word that a the
work<00:00:31.289> ethic<00:00:31.470> thing<00:00:31.830> that's<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.219> problem<00:00:32.690> I've

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
work ethic thing that's the problem I've

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.650

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
want to get in a storage auction game

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.580 
want to get in a storage auction game
it's<00:01:20.610> just<00:01:20.850> a<00:01:20.909> matter<00:01:20.939> of<00:01:21.330> making<00:01:22.320> the

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
it's just a matter of making the

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.130 
it's just a matter of making the
decision<00:01:23.070> and<00:01:23.939> as<00:01:24.060> I<00:01:24.150> said<00:01:24.210> in<00:01:24.479> so<00:01:24.600> many<00:01:24.630> videos

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
decision and as I said in so many videos

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.240 
decision and as I said in so many videos
before<00:01:26.600> the<00:01:27.600> hardest<00:01:28.020> part<00:01:28.200> is<00:01:28.470> making<00:01:28.770> is

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
before the hardest part is making is

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.580 
before the hardest part is making is
taking<00:01:29.579> that<00:01:29.670> first<00:01:29.880> step<00:01:30.030> because<00:01:30.960> you<00:01:31.409> don't

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
taking that first step because you don't

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.200 
taking that first step because you don't
really<00:01:32.070> know<00:01:32.220> us<00:01:32.400> out<00:01:32.549> there<00:01:32.759> and<00:01:32.970> you<00:01:33.090> know

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
really know us out there and you know

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.940 
really know us out there and you know
you've<00:01:33.240> seen<00:01:33.780> my<00:01:34.020> success<00:01:34.470> you've<00:01:34.770> heard

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
you've seen my success you've heard

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.350 
you've seen my success you've heard
about<00:01:35.100> my<00:01:35.369> success<00:01:35.790> and<00:01:35.939> you've<00:01:36.030> heard<00:01:36.150> a<00:01:36.210> few

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
about my success and you've heard a few

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.929 
about my success and you've heard a few
stories<00:01:36.689> in<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:36.960> news<00:01:37.140> but<00:01:37.950> is<00:01:38.220> it<00:01:38.430> really<00:01:38.640> for

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
stories in the news but is it really for

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.810 
stories in the news but is it really for
you<00:01:39.119> and<00:01:39.810> I<00:01:39.869> will<00:01:40.020> say<00:01:40.220> really<00:01:41.220> part<00:01:41.520> of<00:01:41.670> that

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
you and I will say really part of that

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.609 
you and I will say really part of that
before<00:01:42.119> you<00:01:42.150> jump<00:01:42.479> in<00:01:42.630> just<00:01:43.140> ponder<00:01:43.500> that

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
before you jump in just ponder that

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.010 
before you jump in just ponder that
because<00:01:43.979> it<00:01:44.430> takes<00:01:44.610> an<00:01:44.790> effort<00:01:45.119> it<00:01:45.659> takes<00:01:45.840> a

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
because it takes an effort it takes a

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.340 
because it takes an effort it takes a
commitment<00:01:46.439> and<00:01:47.540> within<00:01:48.540> a<00:01:48.600> relatively<00:01:49.229> short

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
commitment and within a relatively short

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.590 
commitment and within a relatively short
period<00:01:49.649> of<00:01:49.890> time<00:01:49.950> you<00:01:50.579> can<00:01:50.759> making<00:01:51.240> decent

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
period of time you can making decent

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.139 
period of time you can making decent
