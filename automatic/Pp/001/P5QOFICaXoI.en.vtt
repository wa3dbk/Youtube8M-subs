round like that and they could like bend

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.550 
round like that and they could like bend
like<00:02:01.259> this<00:02:01.460> right<00:02:02.460> for<00:02:02.850> right<00:02:03.090> here<00:02:03.390> like<00:02:04.110> bend

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
like this right for right here like bend

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
going down to his waist can think I

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.050 
going down to his waist can think I
can't<00:02:19.120> really<00:02:19.360> rotate<00:02:19.870> but<00:02:20.370> it<00:02:21.370> still<00:02:21.790> does

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
can't really rotate but it still does

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.320 
can't really rotate but it still does
the<00:02:23.020> cool<00:02:23.260> thing<00:02:23.290> about<00:02:23.560> this<00:02:23.950> is<00:02:24.190> that<00:02:24.790> his

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
the cool thing about this is that his

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.979 
the cool thing about this is that his
skirt<00:02:25.750> can<00:02:26.230> like<00:02:26.470> move<00:02:27.340> because<00:02:27.760> it<00:02:27.940> on<00:02:28.180> these

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:28.989 
skirt can like move because it on these

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:38.520 
skirt can like move because it on these
joints<00:02:29.849> so<00:02:30.849> yeah<00:02:31.720> ah<00:02:35.190> his<00:02:36.190> feet<00:02:37.110> can't<00:02:38.110> really

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
joints so yeah ah his feet can't really

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.550 
joints so yeah ah his feet can't really
move<00:02:38.680> so<00:02:39.250> his<00:02:39.430> articulation<00:02:40.390> is<00:02:41.019> kind<00:02:41.260> of<00:02:41.380> low

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560
