 Ignored , the water does not ask

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:19.740
 then take everything from the stove and 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:23.189
 let it cool lukewarm 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:27.869
 Now we go to a bowl in the sea 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:32.100
 the cocoa and the baking powder and 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.100
 mix everything together thoroughly 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.270
 Now ica and yolk need each other 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.820
 be separated 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.170

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.480

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.010
 I do not want to bore you because it is 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.870
 have already shown in other videos 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:48.550
 but I think some of you will 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:51.479
 do not know yet and it works 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:53.650
 really great the work is done 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:56.080
 The protein we now go into one 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:57.400
 bowl a pinch of salt to and 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.940
 so that the responding worked so long 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:02.350
 until we hold a stiff snow 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:06.360
 then add half of the sugar 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.360
 and continue for about two minutes 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:15.660
 into another bigger bowl 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.330
 we the yolks the sugar and 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:21.620
 vanilla sugar and stir everything 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.620
 a scary creamy mass 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:28.230
 then we go the lukewarm 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:31.200
 cooled to be charged to the mixture 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:33.380
 Add and mix everything again 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.380
 together 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:44.630
 after the act is now the mixture 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:46.790
 under heard and when we do that 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:53.690
 have we in portions to the 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:57.310
 Cheeky under everything 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.310
 Stir until a smooth mass is obtained 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:05.530
 Now go to the filling of the casserole dish 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.690
 either he takes a bigger one or something 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.430
 how to test two smaller ones 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:12.190
 I have a lined with baking paper 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.930
 and the other slightly greased first 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:19.030
 the sour cherries are filled because 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:27.700
 I spread it to you we go 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:30.400

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.690
 The end reminds you of being something of that 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.370
 small chopped chocolate aside 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:35.370
 this is given on top of it 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:40.600
 that looks quite interesting from 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:44.410
 and now everything comes in the stove for 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:46.510
 about 25 to 30 minutes at 180 degrees 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:48.610
 circulated air 160 degrees 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:51.160
 and then you can still warm him though 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:53.290
 just as well rehabilitate cooled 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.760
