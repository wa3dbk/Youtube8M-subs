00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
what it looks like on their blogs that

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.420 
what it looks like on their blogs that
they<00:01:36.600> they<00:01:37.140> probably<00:01:37.380> can't<00:01:37.680> list<00:01:37.979> all<00:01:38.220> the

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
in the same day and what it appears is

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.730 
in the same day and what it appears is
it<00:01:47.490> usually<00:01:47.820> leaves<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.329> store<00:01:48.570> in<00:01:48.930> one<00:01:49.590> or

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
are I think this is probably a little

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.339 
are I think this is probably a little
bit<00:02:16.819> of<00:02:16.910> fraying<00:02:17.209> on<00:02:17.300> shoelace<00:02:17.750> but<00:02:17.930> I<00:02:17.989> can<00:02:18.170> fix

a pair I Rock already the DMPs and
whatnot<00:03:32.269> but<00:03:32.950> just<00:03:33.950> been<00:03:34.099> stocking<00:03:34.400> up<00:03:34.670> on

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:38.589 
whatnot but just been stocking up on
them<00:03:36.190> just<00:03:37.190> because<00:03:37.609> I'm<00:03:37.790> afraid<00:03:37.910> the<00:03:38.120> quality

00:03:38.589 --> 00:03:38.599 
them just because I'm afraid the quality

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:41.080 
them just because I'm afraid the quality
on<00:03:38.660> 2011<00:03:39.560> is<00:03:39.769> not<00:03:40.430> gonna<00:03:40.549> be<00:03:40.730> in<00:03:40.790> the<00:03:40.880> best

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
on 2011 is not gonna be in the best

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.659 
on 2011 is not gonna be in the best
shape<00:03:41.180> so<00:03:42.010> getting<00:03:43.010> these<00:03:43.130> might<00:03:43.400> be<00:03:43.549> even

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:43.669 
shape so getting these might be even

00:03:43.669 --> 00:03:45.490 
shape so getting these might be even
harder<00:03:44.000> to<00:03:44.209> find<00:03:44.239> once<00:03:44.660> those<00:03:44.900> come<00:03:45.169> out<00:03:45.319> and

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
harder to find once those come out and

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.509 
harder to find once those come out and
then<00:03:45.590> at<00:03:45.739> the<00:03:45.859> same<00:03:46.040> time<00:03:48.250> prices<00:03:49.250> on<00:03:49.370> these

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:49.519 
then at the same time prices on these

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:51.729 
then at the same time prices on these
might<00:03:49.760> actually<00:03:49.970> go<00:03:50.299> up<00:03:50.450> and<00:03:50.780> I<00:03:51.290> got<00:03:51.470> a<00:03:51.500> really

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:51.739 
might actually go up and I got a really

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:53.589 
might actually go up and I got a really
good<00:03:51.950> deal<00:03:52.010> compared<00:03:52.760> to<00:03:52.880> the<00:03:53.090> prices<00:03:53.419> that's
