00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.210
 so hello everyone 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:15.780
 blue and green tripods apologize for 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:19.340
 an expression like this is ready 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:22.670
 What are we going to do with his pears? 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:27.119
 there are such skins on metal 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:32.189
 they are better treated with phosphate 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:35.250
 primer here i have this primer you 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:39.620
 quoted to one diluted 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:44.820
 without thinner i.e. one part 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:45.260
 soil it is a yellow-green and one 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.120
 part 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:50.280
 acid hardener all this 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.860
 thinned and thin film 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:56.129
 applied to all these here 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:01:00.230
 open about skins on metal nothing 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:02.550
 to make a cigarette 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:05.689
 stating primer he pro it poisons 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:11.430
 secondly it creates then or 

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:15.080
 between metal and secondary soil you 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.080
 something like this it will look like 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:24.320
 a little bit not necessary 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.380
 I also donâ€™t know the putty 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:43.570
 pressure 2 stands on this for bullets visa 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:47.080
 tori 2 mountains 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.080
 the torch turned off 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:02:01.939
 Naturally feed too strangled a and so 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.009
 like that Makar all this about the skins 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:12.110
 heads and now 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:15.630
 fill in after 15-20 minutes 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:18.739
 can be applied secondary soil 2 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:21.750
 I also have a secondary soil reflex 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:24.380
 that's how much I cooked it here 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:28.730
 three kilos of undiluted 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:31.290
 I will completely cover the car outside 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:35.760
 because it makes no sense to leave here 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:38.790
 something better to completely close ie 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.019
 it turns out first all the putty space 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:45.480
 fill and then 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:49.440
 one layer of soil to pull off about new 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:52.380
 spare parts immediately explain those skeptics 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:55.620
 which starts typing on black 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:03:00.120
 transport ground soil back and forth on the 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:03.120
 everything is very simple doing a test for 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:06.209
 Conflict simply put the most 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:08.269
 aggressive and thinner try to wash 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:12.840
 not washed off can be primed 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:15.390
 this tales means with a can and 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.340
 priming we wash it off and nothing terrible 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.420
 as it comes to the transport ground it 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.500
 all angles 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:23.690
 can not the more Taiwan good hour 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.750
 steep ground 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:31.650
 Magarach and then probably not make sense 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:32.910
 will show primed on dusty 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.280
 layer will do one 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:39.410
 after which I will fill in completely 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.410
 not a tattoo result
