00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:08.250
 it's everyone I just made a 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:12.990
 bivouac market two days so full 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:15.360
 forest and I used the spoken saying 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:20.369
 in a previous video a mattress 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:22.020
 neoware hall season so here's all 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.510
 seasons so here we test it we are in 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.050
 summer it's July it's still 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:30.660
 fresh anyway where I test the 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:33.360
 ca plain kayes is rather more 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.840
 fresh is a plain that takes a lot 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:39.420
 of moisture game test them agreement and 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.129
 their tent and I did not test that me 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.260
 I will also have my wife tested 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:46.320
 so already the first returns since 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.850
 last night I went to sleep and said it was 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.610
 good I can I want more sleep in 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.829
 bivouac without mattress so it's rather 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.780
 a rather conclusive already in any case 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.829
 rule the principle of saying to sleep my 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.850
 I have a friend who did everything 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:01.079
 south america that really had me 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.960
 advised the two things they 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.729
 insisted for long 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.420
 traits of long journeys 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.979
 it was to have one for 70.8 bags 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.680
 to have a closure at the center or 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.689
 quickly access business and the 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.070
 mattress that was jose for him who 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.950
 seemed to him really important for 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:23.430
 can really recover rest and 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.830
 it is actually we sleep super well 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.110
 ten years so what is a little 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.009
 disturbed at the beginning when we inflate it is 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.509
 that we have the impression that he is not 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.390
 completely inflated it's not like the 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.799
 mattress at the beach yes but actually a 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.420
 when you are growing up with all your name 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.060
 above 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:41.460
 the air is very well distributed concept 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.159
 super nice it's neither too hard nor too much 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:47.790
 soft and sleep when really like 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:50.850
 babies the particularity also on this 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:53.759
 mattress is that jelly with the mini 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.680
 pump mini pump then super light 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.810
 this is really a first point that has me 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.330
 marked because it holds in the hand 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:04.020
 okay 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:07.140
 we put two batteries in it and unscrew 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:11.550
 the opening we put the pump and it works 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:14.100
 all alone inflates waiting 3 minutes 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:16.620
 and that's it's swollen the noise and not 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.420
 really annoying so I'm a little 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.790
 I really like everything that is 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.350
 pure nature and that's it for once 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.390
 is a bit under the technology and 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:26.460
 so yes it's a little bit of noise 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.870
 but it's really light during this 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:29.010
 time we can go make the meal all 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.920
 things like that so it's really 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:35.610
 pleasant 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:39.000
 the cowardly interest of using a 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:42.630
 mini pump is that we do not use 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.750
 so his mouth which actually allows 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:47.400
 avoid sending moist air into the 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.370
 in the mattress is so to conserve 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.810
 longer his mattress so that's 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.670
 not insignificant considering that she is super 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.620
 lightly finally I 'm not me 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.700
 deprive 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.230
 after we are dependent on the batteries so 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.580
 always have spare battery 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:01.350
 but anyway for the frontal for 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:04.890
 to be like that it is always so 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:06.120
 the case that's what I wanted 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:10.550
 tell other about this mattress what 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.550
 I also like it so it's the principle 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:20.220
 in triangle for six years to heavy in 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:22.290
 does that the tear is limited 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.250
 ok it's like for not me 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:29.090
 know that's it especially about 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:32.790
 clothes he and the backpacks that's it 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:34.110
 then when there is a little noise here 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.989
 a little plastic noise at not so 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:38.280
 long time the camera at first I thought 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:40.230
 that it'll be super annoying when I 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.450
 tried it a little at home I found that 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:44.190
 it made noise too shit we go 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.560
 sleep badly or what because apple we go 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:50.160
 move it will make plastic noise and 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:51.660
 in the end not at all not at all 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:57.180
 we must have asked what we asked 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:58.190
 we say she is really here I am 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.690
 think I went around 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:02.790
 maybe two words about the size I 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:04.410
 took me I'm a meter eighty 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:06.060
 and ascension what do we have three 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:08.280
 it's more than enough at the same time 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.710
 more grans I'm not sure even that 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.000
 go back to my tent 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:16.170
 because I have a small bank of 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.920
 place that's what I wanted 

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:19.140
 to say other 

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:20.670
 Well here it is super nice to 

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:23.310
 to deflate is not very complicated 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:28.770
 since I open and I leave I empty 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:29.970
 air the mattress and then and then that's it 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:32.150
 so had to sleep in top form for 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:35.400
 play sports with my dogs 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:38.480
 here is hitch ken hill and et and cani 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:41.310
 hike etc we enjoy the day 

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:43.290
 I tell you more and it was not me 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:45.750
 make your mattress returns you 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:48.000
 use if you buy this mattress 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:50.010
 do not hesitate to tell me also what 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.560
 you think about it but in any case I am 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:55.260
 fan we will redo the tests in winter so 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:56.780
 next video this winter year the most 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:59.280
 hot 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:00.390
 I went to get the pump what I 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:02.310
 I told myself it would be too stupid you 

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:03.360
 do not see the operation so 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:09.810
 as I told you she holds in the 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:11.940
 hand hop there we open we could here 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:13.620
 sense it blows on its own and in fact 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:16.740
 when it's open it works 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:18.540
 and a small profit naked hop out 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:20.880
 black lips 

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:22.980
 and that it will just get them one 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:24.110
 symbol we close them it's more beautiful 

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:28.650
 and it's over 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:32.520
 that was the neoprene mattress eneos 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:33.090
