00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:07.550
 hello I'm viola and explain you in 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.570
 this video the process of meiosis 

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:12.360
 In addition, the two terms 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:15.509
 diploma and haggui made understandable 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:22.230
 and the sperm genesis and udinese 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:25.230
 explains how you already has the dna 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.500
 the carrier of the genetic information and lies 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.730
 in the cell in the cell nucleus 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:34.020
 This is synonymous with the technical term 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:36.750
 Nucleus called during anesthesia 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.329
 the dna thread also condenses 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.980
 called chromatin thread that you can 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.200
 So imagine you for a long time 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.590
 Woolen thread in a certain way 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.149
 The dna is clipped together and wise 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.789
 lies in the process through 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.770
 condensed state before that expectant 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.699
 iks shaped chromosomes under the 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.699
 microscope visible 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:02.870
 Every creature has a specific one 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:06.270
 Number of chromosomes in the nucleus in 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:07.610
 human body cells are 46 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.600
 chromosomes 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.210
 This one can be seen under the microscope 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.340
 visualize them and size them 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.860
 sorted 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:19.490
 this clearly shows that 22 chromosomes 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.409
 with equal pairs 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.970
 these two same chromosomes die 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.659
 in their size and structure 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:32.159
 same as homologous chromosomes 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:35.610
 refers to the pairs of chromosomes so 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:37.369
 44 chromosomes will also humming car 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.350
 called 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:41.460
 There are also two 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.439
 Sex chromosomes in front of for the 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.899
 expression of the sex of the 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:48.860
 are responsible for the carrier material and 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.680
 are called consumer 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.020
 there are 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:58.410
 the full movie and many more 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:02:01.450
 you can find on sofatutor.com about 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:05.260
 7,000 videos tell you what you are up to 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:08.410
 Good grades need to know about testing 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:10.899
 your knowledge after every video real 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.900
 Teachers help you in daily live chat 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:15.760
