at the same time was utterly luxurious
so<00:02:33.200> it<00:02:33.410> was<00:02:33.530> definitely<00:02:33.920> a<00:02:34.280> fashion<00:02:34.670> moment

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:39.549 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:42.039 

well<00:02:40.549> I<00:02:40.580> mean<00:02:40.760> it's<00:02:40.970> always<00:02:41.209> emotional<00:02:41.570> to<00:02:41.930> me

and it's emotional to all of us because

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.370 
and it's emotional to all of us because
we<00:02:43.940> put<00:02:44.120> our<00:02:44.239> heart<00:02:44.450> and<00:02:44.480> soul<00:02:44.630> into<00:02:44.810> it<00:02:45.260> you

we put our heart and soul into it you

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:46.990 
we put our heart and soul into it you
know<00:02:45.470> that's<00:02:45.650> why<00:02:45.830> we<00:02:45.980> do<00:02:46.130> it<00:02:46.280> we<00:02:46.400> love<00:02:46.519> passion

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
know that's why we do it we love passion

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.420 
know that's why we do it we love passion
but<00:02:47.840> I<00:02:48.110> didn't<00:02:48.739> it<00:02:48.830> was<00:02:48.950> the<00:02:49.010> most<00:02:49.190> emotional

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
but I didn't it was the most emotional

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.250 
but I didn't it was the most emotional
one<00:02:49.790> I<00:02:50.000> mean<00:02:50.239> I<00:02:50.299> felt<00:02:50.540> it<00:02:50.630> was<00:02:50.780> one<00:02:50.930> of<00:02:50.959> the<00:02:51.110> most

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
one I mean I felt it was one of the most

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.500 
one I mean I felt it was one of the most
dramatic<00:02:51.470> in<00:02:51.920> terms<00:02:51.950> of<00:02:52.340> the<00:02:52.760> clothing<00:02:53.330> I

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
dramatic in terms of the clothing I

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.270 
dramatic in terms of the clothing I
think<00:02:53.840> because<00:02:54.320> the<00:02:54.440> clothing<00:02:54.799> was<00:02:54.920> actually

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
think because the clothing was actually

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.770 
think because the clothing was actually
things<00:02:55.519> I<00:02:55.640> think<00:02:55.700> people<00:02:55.910> would<00:02:56.180> love<00:02:56.390> to<00:02:56.600> wear

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
things I think people would love to wear

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.050 
things I think people would love to wear
and<00:02:57.080> would<00:02:57.260> wear<00:02:57.470> will<00:02:57.860> wear<00:02:58.100> and<00:02:58.370> they<00:02:59.000> were

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
and would wear will wear and they were

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.270 
and would wear will wear and they were
black<00:02:59.330> and<00:02:59.690> so<00:02:59.870> there's<00:03:00.080> kind<00:03:00.320> of<00:03:00.470> that<00:03:00.650> thing

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
black and so there's kind of that thing

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.220 
black and so there's kind of that thing
that<00:03:01.430> you<00:03:01.519> can<00:03:01.670> percieve<00:03:01.850> of<00:03:02.299> either<00:03:02.930> as

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
that you can percieve of either as

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.229 
that you can percieve of either as
glamour<00:03:03.500> or<00:03:03.920> is<00:03:04.010> the<00:03:04.130> kind<00:03:04.340> of<00:03:04.459> darkness<00:03:05.000> or

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:05.239 
glamour or is the kind of darkness or

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:21.809 
glamour or is the kind of darkness or
whatever<00:03:05.480> but<00:03:05.720> that's<00:03:06.049> all<00:03:06.260> perception

00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:21.819 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:24.839

so much more real and people would

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:18.060 
so much more real and people would
really<00:04:16.209> desire<00:04:16.660> it<00:04:16.840> and<00:04:16.930> want<00:04:17.169> it<00:04:17.320> if<00:04:17.530> it<00:04:17.949> were

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
really desire it and want it if it were

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:19.770 
really desire it and want it if it were
in<00:04:18.220> a<00:04:18.310> color<00:04:18.519> that<00:04:18.609> most<00:04:19.150> people<00:04:19.449> I<00:04:19.509> know<00:04:19.570> who

house five bottles of champagne four and

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:00.090 
house five bottles of champagne four and

then went upside-down or vice versa and

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:01.830 
then went upside-down or vice versa and
we<00:06:00.250> just<00:06:00.430> thought<00:06:00.610> we<00:06:00.760> would<00:06:00.910> sort<00:06:01.390> of<00:06:01.510> make<00:06:01.810> it

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:01.840 
we just thought we would sort of make it

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:03.480 
we just thought we would sort of make it
more<00:06:02.080> contemporary<00:06:02.440> we<00:06:02.950> removed<00:06:03.370> the

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:03.490 
more contemporary we removed the

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:05.880 
more contemporary we removed the
drawstring<00:06:04.090> we<00:06:04.720> kind<00:06:04.960> of<00:06:05.080> made<00:06:05.230> it<00:06:05.380> cleaner

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:05.890 
drawstring we kind of made it cleaner

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:08.700 
drawstring we kind of made it cleaner
and<00:06:06.070> cooler<00:06:06.490> then<00:06:07.210> then<00:06:07.630> its<00:06:07.810> predecessor<00:06:08.590> and

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:08.710 
and cooler then then its predecessor and

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:11.070 
and cooler then then its predecessor and
then<00:06:09.280> we<00:06:09.430> decorated<00:06:09.850> it<00:06:10.030> in<00:06:10.270> all<00:06:10.630> kinds<00:06:10.900> of

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:11.080 
then we decorated it in all kinds of

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:13.500 
then we decorated it in all kinds of
ways<00:06:11.260> and<00:06:11.320> I<00:06:11.770> just<00:06:12.250> think<00:06:12.430> you<00:06:13.120> know<00:06:13.210> it<00:06:13.330> just

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:13.510 
ways and I just think you know it just

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:17.000 
ways and I just think you know it just
felt<00:06:13.660> like<00:06:13.750> the<00:06:13.900> right<00:06:13.930> thing<00:06:14.260> to<00:06:14.410> do

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:17.010 

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:35.750 

I<00:06:33.440> thought<00:06:34.440> was<00:06:34.530> a<00:06:34.590> great<00:06:34.680> show<00:06:35.010> and<00:06:35.400> a<00:06:35.730> great

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:35.760 
I thought was a great show and a great

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:39.380 
I thought was a great show and a great
finale<00:06:36.330> and<00:06:37.200> I<00:06:37.350> thought<00:06:37.620> it<00:06:37.830> was<00:06:38.070> an<00:06:38.610> auto

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:39.390 
finale and I thought it was an auto

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:41.960 
finale and I thought it was an auto
homage<00:06:40.170> to<00:06:40.200> himself<00:06:40.920> and<00:06:41.430> what<00:06:41.520> he's<00:06:41.670> done<00:06:41.820> if

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:41.970 
homage to himself and what he's done if

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:48.620 
homage to himself and what he's done if
we

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:48.630 

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:50.630 

we<00:06:49.170> always<00:06:49.500> wish<00:06:49.710> mark<00:06:49.950> the<00:06:50.070> very<00:06:50.220> best<00:06:50.460> he

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:50.640 
we always wish mark the very best he

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:52.580 
we always wish mark the very best he
brings<00:06:50.820> a<00:06:50.970> lot<00:06:51.000> of<00:06:51.180> excitement<00:06:51.930> to<00:06:52.200> fashion
