00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:06.150
 hello guys so we're here with more 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:09.599
 a video for our facebook page 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:13.920
 dot.com galaxy s bar three tips 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:15.109
 today is a tip on an issue 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.439
 interesting 

00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:24.240
 galaxy s 3 has this big screen and the 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.930
 Sometimes you pick yourself up with one hand. 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.320
 only 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.810
 and to make this pulling motion 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.989
 notification bar for who has the 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:40.079
 small or medium hand becomes 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:43.320
 more difficult and besides dangerous you 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:46.440
 doing this movement with one hand can only 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:50.430
 Shoot down your car from the ground 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:55.710
 so I thought in a second way 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:57.960
 to access the notification bar without 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:02.670
 have to make that move then 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:04.610
 I researched in history and took a 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.270
 little more 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:12.420
 I found the application called 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:14.880
 I notified you short is the one you go there 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:18.210
 install it only after the voltage 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:23.250
 This application does not appear 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:26.189
 here on your screen and here in your grid 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:29.040
 application for you to place your 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:33.000
 screen for you to add it to the 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:36.020
 your home screen which is the screen that appears 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:40.140
 when you press the home button you 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:42.860
 click here in an empty area add to 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:49.380
 screen or add to the main screen 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:54.990
 applications and widgets and search here for 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:56.820
 this shortcut has notified shock and plays it 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:03.030
 for your music and now I'm with two 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:04.860
 here then what happens now when 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.500
 Are you on your home screen that you 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.550
 touch this shortcut to your 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.739
 Notifications 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.380
 low if you do not need to do more 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:16.290
 this movement just touch 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:20.670
 and she appears something else that I 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:22.800
 I tried to do is how I use the 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.500
 pilot who is in the corner I have 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:31.530
 that make this spinning move too 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:37.010
 It's difficult, I discovered another one. 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:40.650
 application is this one 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:43.380
 I notified shantou that he does it 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:47.370
 adds hoists to your bar 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:51.030
 notifications have two columns here if 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:55.070
 you put in the first on the second and the 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:57.960
 first it adds two lines to 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:03:01.830
 configuration for example goes fire 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:03.750
 bluetooth are in the same line if 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:07.680
 add the configuration again 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:11.550
 button appears on the second line 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:16.440
 Okay so I'm using it at the moment is the 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:20.060
 wifi boot settings the rotation of 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:24.420
 screen and mobile data 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:26.340
 these four are now part of my 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.590
 notifications bar that are here that 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.690
 I have easier access to finger on 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.820
 half the screen now as a very 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:35.880
 bhutto 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:38.670
 Whenever I play here, I'll open the 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:43.550
 option to switch on and off and which of 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:46.410
 devices I want to connect ok 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:51.090
 Another item is this screen voting 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:59.959
 ringing on and off and the latter 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:04:03.420
 here is mobile data on and off 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:06.330
 ok then the staff this tip then the 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:09.990
 applications links are below 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:12.510
 It's nice to play this game of downloading the 

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:14.370
 screen without having to close the big toe there you 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:17.580
 can put in other places of your 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:18.390
 home screen but better on your screen 

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:23.600
 main 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:23.600
 Okay, see you next time.
