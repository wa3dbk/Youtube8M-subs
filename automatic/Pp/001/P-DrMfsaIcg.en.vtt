00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
to download the contrast down my dial

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.550 
to download the contrast down my dial
the<00:01:26.970> exposure<00:01:27.360> back<00:01:27.600> down<00:01:27.810> where<00:01:28.080> did<00:01:28.259> I<00:01:28.350> want

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
anymore so anyways that's the main issue

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.640 
anymore so anyways that's the main issue
with<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.270> bug<00:01:36.450> if<00:01:36.659> I<00:01:36.780> turn<00:01:36.990> on<00:01:37.020> auto<00:01:37.350> sync

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
with the bug if I turn on auto sync

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.310 
with the bug if I turn on auto sync
again<00:01:37.979> you<00:01:38.670> can<00:01:38.850> see<00:01:39.090> that<00:01:39.119> let's<00:01:39.750> dial<00:01:39.960> is<00:01:40.140> way

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
again you can see that let's dial is way

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.499 
again you can see that let's dial is way
up<00:01:40.500> let's<00:01:40.770> dial<00:01:40.979> this<00:01:41.159> way<00:01:41.369> down<00:01:41.670> you<00:01:42.329> can<00:01:42.479> see

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
up let's dial this way down you can see

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.560 
up let's dial this way down you can see
that<00:01:42.840> that's<00:01:42.960> affected<00:01:43.649> but<00:01:44.130> then<00:01:44.399> if<00:01:44.700> i<00:01:45.000> hit

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
that that's affected but then if i hit

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.350 
that that's affected but then if i hit
if<00:01:46.140> i<00:01:46.290> hit<00:01:46.500> back<00:01:46.740> here<00:01:47.130> on<00:01:47.280> my<00:01:47.460> history<00:01:47.700> it's
