00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:18.980 
ability to for the nervous system to

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:22.560 
ability to for the nervous system to
delay<00:01:20.080> age-related<00:01:21.080> motor<00:01:21.620> neuron

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:22.570 
delay age-related motor neuron

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.810 
delay age-related motor neuron
activities<00:01:23.570> so<00:01:23.990> they<00:01:24.800> made<00:01:25.010> to<00:01:25.160> let<00:01:25.340> it<00:01:25.490> delay

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 
activities so they made to let it delay

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.200 
activities so they made to let it delay
the<00:01:25.970> onset<00:01:26.090> of<00:01:26.480> like<00:01:27.230> Lou<00:01:27.530> Gehrig's<00:01:28.010> disease

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.210 
the onset of like Lou Gehrig's disease

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.120 
the onset of like Lou Gehrig's disease
for<00:01:29.210> instance<00:01:29.720> maybe<00:01:30.020> Alzheimer's<00:01:30.920> and

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
for instance maybe Alzheimer's and

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.580 
for instance maybe Alzheimer's and
they're<00:01:31.760> really<00:01:31.910> high<00:01:32.240> in<00:01:32.410> antioxidants<00:01:33.410> as

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
they're really high in antioxidants as

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.250 
they're really high in antioxidants as
they<00:01:34.310> lower<00:01:34.520> cholesterol<00:01:34.970> and<00:01:35.570> in<00:01:35.780> one<00:01:35.990> study

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:36.260 
they lower cholesterol and in one study

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.100 
they lower cholesterol and in one study
they<00:01:36.500> showed<00:01:37.000> people<00:01:38.000> that<00:01:38.150> added<00:01:38.600> a<00:01:38.690> handful

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
they showed people that added a handful

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.230 
they showed people that added a handful
of<00:01:39.140> pecans<00:01:39.680> to<00:01:39.890> their<00:01:40.220> diet<00:01:40.490> lowered<00:01:41.030> their

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
of pecans to their diet lowered their

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:46.120 
of pecans to their diet lowered their
cholesterol<00:01:41.750> by<00:01:42.220> 16.5%<00:01:43.220> up<00:01:44.090> a<00:01:44.240> lot<00:01:45.010> so<00:01:46.010> we're

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
cholesterol by 16.5% up a lot so we're

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:51.090 
cholesterol by 16.5% up a lot so we're
going<00:01:46.220> to<00:01:46.310> sprinkle<00:01:46.580> this<00:01:47.230> with<00:01:48.670> the<00:01:49.670> pecans

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
going to sprinkle this with the pecans

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.980 
going to sprinkle this with the pecans
it's<00:01:52.100> not<00:01:52.340> pretty

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
it's not pretty

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:59.230 
it's not pretty
I<00:01:54.020> think<00:01:54.650> that's<00:01:54.830> all<00:01:55.310> used<00:01:56.560> and<00:01:58.030> then<00:01:59.030> we're

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
I think that's all used and then we're

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.540 
I think that's all used and then we're
going<00:01:59.360> to<00:01:59.420> make<00:01:59.570> the<00:01:59.750> filling<00:02:00.140> which<00:02:00.980> is<00:02:01.220> three

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:01.550 
going to make the filling which is three
