00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:16.630
 today I am going to give you these bracelets 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:19.700
 learn to make with two plastic fork 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:22.760
 I have packed two plastic molds and 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:25.189
 I have I have just the midpoint 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:28.610
 broken cut 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:30.800
 then I am going to make 2 forks 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:34.790
 I have two color rubber bands 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:37.699
 I have taken 24 green ones and I have 21 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:41.120
 packed orange orange rubber bands and one 

00:00:37.699 --> 00:00:45.019
 clip to start with first 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:47.690
 a rubber band the beginning is different I'm going 

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:50.600
 the rubber band 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.430
 actually may have over it 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.379
 to pull 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:57.320
 I'm going to turn it seems 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:59.269
 actually a bit out of 8 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.210
 and then I will go back in addition to it 

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:04.400
 those two rubber bands and so now I have 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:09.049
 I got it from my orange rubber band 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:12.200
 two loops for each box and then I go 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:14.960
 hold each other than I pick 4 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:17.570
 green rubber bands and every time I lay 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.580
 down through rubber bands for myself so that 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.380
 I can't get lost and count 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:25.670
 accident and color more or one color 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:27.229
 have used less than I have to 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.280
 push the principle a little into the 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:30.710
 first time 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:34.070
 then you put one on this and then diagonally 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.939
 another green on another shape 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.880
 rubber band 

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:40.189
 one on the other and then diagonally 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.140
 my other fork first time steven one 

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:48.020
 a bit tricky because there are so double 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:50.420
 rubber band tightly pulled like that 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.100
 one off the devil takes us away 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.810
 he lets go of me and then diagonally on that 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.270
 Others 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.850
 and then that orange rubber band goes 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.770
 I get it off of both again 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:05.719
 just finish and then it goes nicely in it 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:07.479
 middle lay against doing work you always do 

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:10.369
 it my work you down 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:12.740
 then I grab a green rubber band I start 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:16.069
 every time at the bottom left 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:19.010
 and then I skew then I grab 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:22.069
 the bottom green rubber band and that 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:24.740
 I take it off I put it in the middle 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:26.460
 on the other hand also the bottom green mark 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:28.500
 I got rid of it 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:31.260
 I push my work in the middle again 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.250
 down and then I turn green again 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.960
 rubber band 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.390
 start again at the bottom but now on the 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:38.160
 right side and I pull it diagonally 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.520
 the other way 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.480
