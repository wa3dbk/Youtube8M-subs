fingernail is actually getting caught in
the<00:00:20.659> scratch<00:00:20.989> so<00:00:21.829> we're<00:00:21.980> going<00:00:22.070> to<00:00:22.159> actually

00:00:22.479 --> 00:00:22.489 
the scratch so we're going to actually

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:24.519 
the scratch so we're going to actually
use<00:00:22.519> our<00:00:22.789> clerk<00:00:22.970> open<00:00:23.390> to<00:00:23.689> prepare<00:00:24.050> the<00:00:24.169> damage

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:26.089 
so we can restore this finish to a

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:28.029 
so we can restore this finish to a
like-new<00:00:26.630> condition<00:00:27.019> the<00:00:27.529> first<00:00:27.739> thing<00:00:27.919> I'm

clear coat pen until the scratching

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:43.840 
clear coat pen until the scratching
completely<00:00:42.320> now<00:00:43.010> we're<00:00:43.190> going<00:00:43.310> to<00:00:43.370> allow<00:00:43.610> this

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:43.850 
completely now we're going to allow this

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.050 
completely now we're going to allow this
to<00:00:44.090> dry<00:00:44.120> for<00:00:44.690> a<00:00:44.720> good<00:00:44.780> 10<00:00:45.710> minutes<00:00:45.740> or<00:00:46.220> so<00:00:46.250> now

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:47.060 
to dry for a good 10 minutes or so now

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:48.790 
to dry for a good 10 minutes or so now
normally<00:00:47.540> with<00:00:47.690> a<00:00:47.720> deep<00:00:47.990> scratch<00:00:48.320> and<00:00:48.590> if<00:00:48.680> it

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:48.800 
normally with a deep scratch and if it

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.310 
normally with a deep scratch and if it
happens<00:00:49.100> to<00:00:49.130> be<00:00:49.220> called<00:00:49.600> this<00:00:50.600> process<00:00:51.170> you

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:51.320 
happens to be called this process you

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.140 
happens to be called this process you
may<00:00:51.500> want<00:00:51.740> to<00:00:51.830> wait<00:00:52.010> overnight<00:00:52.430> before<00:00:53.030> you

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:53.150 
may want to wait overnight before you

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:56.020 
may want to wait overnight before you
start<00:00:53.480> the<00:00:53.750> sanding<00:00:54.200> process<00:00:54.400> now<00:00:55.400> the

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.030 
start the sanding process now the

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.210 
start the sanding process now the
problem<00:00:56.480> is<00:00:56.660> once<00:00:56.960> you<00:00:57.110> fill<00:00:57.350> this<00:00:57.500> in<00:00:57.740> the

00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:58.220 
problem is once you fill this in the

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:59.980 
problem is once you fill this in the
scratch<00:00:58.520> is<00:00:58.550> almost<00:00:58.940> nearly<00:00:59.270> invisible<00:00:59.540> so

00:00:59.980 --> 00:00:59.990 
scratch is almost nearly invisible so

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:02.680 
scratch is almost nearly invisible so
before<00:01:00.350> you<00:01:00.440> do<00:01:00.620> any<00:01:00.920> other<00:01:01.310> treatment<00:01:01.790> of<00:01:02.090> the

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 
before you do any other treatment of the

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.319 
before you do any other treatment of the
damaged<00:01:03.020> areas<00:01:03.410> we<00:01:03.860> want<00:01:04.040> to<00:01:04.189> mask<00:01:04.430> off<00:01:04.759> one

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:05.329 
damaged areas we want to mask off one

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:08.249 
damaged areas we want to mask off one
inch<00:01:05.540> above<00:01:06.020> and<00:01:06.320> one<00:01:07.100> inch<00:01:07.340> below<00:01:07.609> the

00:01:08.249 --> 00:01:08.259 
inch above and one inch below the

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:11.590 
inch above and one inch below the
damaged<00:01:09.259> area<00:01:09.619> just<00:01:10.249> about<00:01:10.759> like<00:01:11.060> that<00:01:11.329> that's

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
damaged area just about like that that's

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:12.279 
damaged area just about like that that's
perfect

00:01:12.279 --> 00:01:12.289 
perfect

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:16.080 
perfect
we<00:01:12.740> start<00:01:13.039> by<00:01:13.219> lubricating<00:01:13.850> the<00:01:13.969> surface<00:01:14.740> and

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:16.090 
we start by lubricating the surface and

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.760 
we start by lubricating the surface and
start<00:01:17.090> with<00:01:17.420> our<00:01:17.539> sanding<00:01:17.960> pads<00:01:18.200> now<00:01:18.619> these

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
start with our sanding pads now these

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:20.800 
start with our sanding pads now these
are<00:01:18.950> all<00:01:19.069> color<00:01:19.310> coded<00:01:19.399> and<00:01:19.939> numbered<00:01:20.600> so

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
are all color coded and numbered so

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.739 
are all color coded and numbered so
they're<00:01:20.929> very<00:01:21.319> easy<00:01:21.590> to<00:01:21.770> use<00:01:22.270> this<00:01:23.270> one<00:01:23.600> I'm

00:01:23.739 --> 00:01:23.749 
they're very easy to use this one I'm

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:25.090 
they're very easy to use this one I'm
going<00:01:23.869> to<00:01:23.929> start<00:01:24.020> with<00:01:24.289> pad<00:01:24.590> number<00:01:24.920> two

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
going to start with pad number two

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.129 
going to start with pad number two
because<00:01:25.399> it<00:01:25.549> really<00:01:25.819> isn't<00:01:25.969> that<00:01:26.270> abrasive<00:01:26.569> I

00:01:27.129 --> 00:01:27.139 
because it really isn't that abrasive I

00:01:27.139 --> 00:01:28.929 
because it really isn't that abrasive I
would<00:01:27.439> use<00:01:27.649> pad<00:01:27.950> number<00:01:28.159> one<00:01:28.490> if<00:01:28.670> I<00:01:28.759> was

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:28.939 
would use pad number one if I was

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:31.149 
would use pad number one if I was
actually<00:01:29.119> using<00:01:29.359> touch<00:01:29.719> of<00:01:29.899> paint<00:01:30.109> so<00:01:31.069> I'm

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:31.159 
actually using touch of paint so I'm

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:32.999 
actually using touch of paint so I'm
going<00:01:31.280> to<00:01:31.340> lubricate<00:01:31.429> my<00:01:31.729> pad<00:01:32.119> number<00:01:32.420> two<00:01:32.630> and

00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:33.009 
going to lubricate my pad number two and

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:37.840 
going to lubricate my pad number two and
I'm<00:01:34.009> using<00:01:34.340> the<00:01:34.670> tape<00:01:34.880> as<00:01:35.119> a<00:01:35.149> guide<00:01:36.639> to<00:01:37.639> guide

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
I'm using the tape as a guide to guide

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:43.029 
I'm using the tape as a guide to guide
my<00:01:39.039> sanding<00:01:40.039> action<00:01:40.429> here<00:01:40.670> next<00:01:41.659> step<00:01:42.020> is<00:01:42.229> to

00:01:43.029 --> 00:01:43.039 
my sanding action here next step is to

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:45.010 
my sanding action here next step is to
go<00:01:43.189> to<00:01:43.219> pad<00:01:43.670> number<00:01:43.969> three<00:01:44.209> now<00:01:44.479> this<00:01:44.689> pad<00:01:44.990> is

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
go to pad number three now this pad is

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.379 
go to pad number three now this pad is
less<00:01:45.380> abrasive<00:01:45.679> than<00:01:46.310> the<00:01:46.459> previous<00:01:46.819> pad<00:01:47.119> this

00:01:47.379 --> 00:01:47.389 
less abrasive than the previous pad this

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:50.379 
less abrasive than the previous pad this
is<00:01:47.450> about<00:01:47.719> 3600<00:01:48.499> grit<00:01:48.740> wet<00:01:48.950> sand<00:01:49.249> which<00:01:50.179> is

00:01:50.379 --> 00:01:50.389 
is about 3600 grit wet sand which is

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:52.389 
is about 3600 grit wet sand which is
very<00:01:50.600> very<00:01:50.779> fine<00:01:51.139> again<00:01:51.709> I'm<00:01:52.039> going<00:01:52.189> to<00:01:52.279> follow

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:52.399 
very very fine again I'm going to follow

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:57.580 
very very fine again I'm going to follow
the<00:01:52.579> very<00:01:53.179> light<00:01:53.479> rubbing<00:01:55.719> finally<00:01:56.719> I'm<00:01:57.499> going

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
the very light rubbing finally I'm going

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.709 
the very light rubbing finally I'm going
to<00:01:57.679> go<00:01:57.740> to<00:01:57.799> our<00:01:57.950> pad<00:01:58.189> number<00:01:58.520> four<00:01:58.789> this<00:01:59.509> is

00:01:59.709 --> 00:01:59.719 
to go to our pad number four this is

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:03.459 
to go to our pad number four this is
4000<00:02:00.590> grit<00:02:00.740> wet<00:02:00.979> sand<00:02:01.279> again<00:02:01.729> wetting<00:02:02.469> and
