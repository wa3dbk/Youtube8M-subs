read<00:00:05.549> recently<00:00:05.759> I've<00:00:06.210> actually<00:00:06.390> have<00:00:07.080> been

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
read recently I've actually have been

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.440 
read recently I've actually have been
training<00:00:07.680> some<00:00:07.859> others<00:00:08.160> on<00:00:08.370> for<00:00:08.730> the<00:00:08.790> past<00:00:09.030> ten

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
training some others on for the past ten

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.209 
training some others on for the past ten
months<00:00:09.809> or<00:00:09.900> so<00:00:10.080> it's<00:00:10.590> called<00:00:10.800> the<00:00:10.920> four

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
months or so it's called the four

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.850 
months or so it's called the four
disciplines<00:00:11.550> of<00:00:12.120> execution<00:00:12.360> and<00:00:13.049> it's<00:00:13.559> really

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
disciplines of execution and it's really

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.609 
disciplines of execution and it's really
a<00:00:13.889> system<00:00:14.549> or<00:00:15.179> an<00:00:15.330> order<00:00:15.690> of<00:00:15.839> events<00:00:16.080> if<00:00:16.500> you

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
a system or an order of events if you

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.220 
a system or an order of events if you
will<00:00:16.830> to<00:00:17.190> achieve<00:00:17.369> high<00:00:18.029> level<00:00:18.510> goals<00:00:18.720> that

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
will to achieve high level goals that

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.439 
will to achieve high level goals that
consistently<00:00:20.189> consistently<00:00:20.699> achieve<00:00:21.300> your

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
consistently consistently achieve your

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.509 
consistently consistently achieve your
high<00:00:21.570> level<00:00:21.750> goals<00:00:22.080> so<00:00:22.650> we<00:00:22.680> talked<00:00:22.980> about<00:00:23.130> some

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
high level goals so we talked about some

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:25.490 
high level goals so we talked about some
things<00:00:23.550> there's<00:00:23.970> really<00:00:24.119> four<00:00:24.420> steps<00:00:24.840> to<00:00:25.380> the

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
things there's really four steps to the

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.859 
things there's really four steps to the
four<00:00:25.680> disciplines<00:00:25.890> the<00:00:26.250> first<00:00:26.430> one<00:00:26.670> is<00:00:27.029> focus

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
four disciplines the first one is focus

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.470 
four disciplines the first one is focus
on<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.470> wildly<00:00:29.130> important<00:00:29.730> goal<00:00:30.029> and<00:00:30.390> they

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
on the wildly important goal and they

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.209 
on the wildly important goal and they
say<00:00:30.630> wildly<00:00:31.230> important<00:00:31.740> because<00:00:31.830> there's<00:00:32.160> a

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
say wildly important because there's a

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:33.920 
say wildly important because there's a
lot<00:00:32.460> of<00:00:32.610> goals<00:00:32.850> that<00:00:33.059> we<00:00:33.210> have<00:00:33.420> there's<00:00:33.690> a<00:00:33.750> lot

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
lot of goals that we have there's a lot

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.690 
lot of goals that we have there's a lot
of<00:00:34.050> things<00:00:34.230> that<00:00:34.320> we'd<00:00:34.469> like<00:00:34.500> to<00:00:34.680> do<00:00:35.040> there's

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
of things that we'd like to do there's

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.630 
of things that we'd like to do there's
always<00:00:35.790> more<00:00:36.630> good<00:00:37.050> ideas<00:00:37.430> than<00:00:38.430> there<00:00:38.610> is

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
always more good ideas than there is

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.610 
always more good ideas than there is
time<00:00:38.940> to<00:00:38.969> do<00:00:39.210> them<00:00:39.360> it's<00:00:40.020> like<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.290> book<00:00:40.440> good

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
time to do them it's like the book good

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:41.270 
time to do them it's like the book good
to<00:00:40.680> great

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
to great

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.330 
to great
right<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.640> enemy<00:00:42.000> of<00:00:42.239> the<00:00:42.780> great<00:00:43.140> is<00:00:43.440> good<00:00:44.040> in

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
right the enemy of the great is good in

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.520 
right the enemy of the great is good in
order<00:00:45.059> to<00:00:45.149> achieve<00:00:45.270> greatness<00:00:45.809> in<00:00:46.170> something

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
order to achieve greatness in something

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.830 
order to achieve greatness in something
you're<00:00:46.950> going<00:00:47.100> to<00:00:47.190> have<00:00:47.340> to<00:00:47.520> say<00:00:47.730> no<00:00:48.149> to<00:00:48.750> an

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
you're going to have to say no to an

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.619 
you're going to have to say no to an
awful<00:00:49.320> lot<00:00:49.350> of<00:00:49.500> other<00:00:49.770> good<00:00:50.370> ideas<00:00:50.910> because

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
awful lot of other good ideas because

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.439 
awful lot of other good ideas because
you<00:00:51.660> can<00:00:51.840> only<00:00:51.989> focus<00:00:52.260> on<00:00:52.559> one<00:00:52.620> thing<00:00:53.520> at<00:00:54.390> a

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
you can only focus on one thing at a

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.740 
you can only focus on one thing at a
time<00:00:54.570> really<00:00:55.559> focus<00:00:56.070> on<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.460> most<00:00:56.879> important

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
time really focus on the most important

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.020 
time really focus on the most important
the<00:00:57.930> wildly<00:00:58.350> important<00:00:58.829> so<00:00:59.699> that's<00:00:59.879> number

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
the wildly important so that's number

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.240 
the wildly important so that's number
one<00:01:00.270> that's<00:01:00.510> focused<00:01:00.719> decide<00:01:01.350> exactly<00:01:01.920> clear

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
one that's focused decide exactly clear

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.670 
one that's focused decide exactly clear
what<00:01:02.520> is<00:01:02.760> your<00:01:03.000> wild<00:01:03.329> important<00:01:03.809> goal<00:01:03.960> the

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
what is your wild important goal the

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.450 
what is your wild important goal the
second<00:01:05.040> thing<00:01:05.189> is<00:01:05.369> act<00:01:06.030> on<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:07.200> lead<00:01:07.500> measures

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
second thing is act on the lead measures

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.250 
second thing is act on the lead measures
there's<00:01:09.090> two<00:01:09.240> kinds<00:01:09.600> of<00:01:09.720> measures<00:01:10.049> that<00:01:10.140> we

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
there's two kinds of measures that we

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.170 
there's two kinds of measures that we
talk<00:01:10.409> about<00:01:10.560> lead<00:01:10.920> measures<00:01:11.310> and<00:01:11.549> lag

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
talk about lead measures and lag

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.840 
talk about lead measures and lag
measures<00:01:12.689> lag<00:01:13.020> measures<00:01:13.560> are<00:01:13.890> things<00:01:14.729> that

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
measures lag measures are things that

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.399 
measures lag measures are things that
are<00:01:14.939> in<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.060> past<00:01:15.210> but<00:01:15.990> they're<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.259> easiest

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
are in the past but they're the easiest

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:17.929 
are in the past but they're the easiest
two<00:01:16.860> measures<00:01:17.189> that's<00:01:17.400> where<00:01:17.520> most<00:01:17.640> people

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
two measures that's where most people

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.219 
two measures that's where most people
focus<00:01:18.090> on<00:01:18.390> it<00:01:18.540> let's<00:01:18.689> just<00:01:18.840> take<00:01:19.020> an<00:01:19.140> example

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
focus on it let's just take an example

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.200 
focus on it let's just take an example
about<00:01:19.830> weight<00:01:20.100> loss<00:01:20.130> for<00:01:20.610> a<00:01:20.670> second<00:01:20.909> let's<00:01:21.090> say

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
about weight loss for a second let's say

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.300 
about weight loss for a second let's say
you<00:01:21.270> wanted<00:01:21.600> to<00:01:21.659> lose<00:01:21.810> weight<00:01:21.869> a<00:01:22.409> wildly

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
you wanted to lose weight a wildly

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.330 
you wanted to lose weight a wildly
important<00:01:23.729> goal<00:01:23.970> might<00:01:24.360> be<00:01:24.390> I<00:01:24.990> want<00:01:25.560> to<00:01:26.009> lose

less calories burn more calories that
we're<00:03:19.140> going<00:03:19.320> to<00:03:19.440> hit<00:03:19.620> our<00:03:19.739> goal<00:03:19.770> which<00:03:20.310> is

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
we're going to hit our goal which is

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.180 
we're going to hit our goal which is
lose<00:03:20.670> 20<00:03:21.000> pounds<00:03:21.030> by<00:03:21.600> June<00:03:21.930> 1st<00:03:22.230> right<00:03:22.800> this<00:03:23.070> is

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
lose 20 pounds by June 1st right this is

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.690 
lose 20 pounds by June 1st right this is
a<00:03:23.220> bet

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
a bet

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.370 
a bet
maybe<00:03:23.880> we<00:03:24.060> chose<00:03:24.330> the<00:03:24.600> wrong<00:03:24.750> league<00:03:25.080> measure

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
maybe we chose the wrong league measure

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.290 
maybe we chose the wrong league measure
so<00:03:25.620> if<00:03:25.650> you<00:03:25.709> only<00:03:25.860> have<00:03:25.950> one<00:03:26.370> you're<00:03:27.000> not<00:03:27.120> going

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 
so if you only have one you're not going

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:29.000 
so if you only have one you're not going
to<00:03:27.360> hit<00:03:27.450> your<00:03:27.630> goal<00:03:27.780> so<00:03:28.020> have<00:03:28.230> to<00:03:28.620> leave

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
to hit your goal so have to leave

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:19.770 
simple but it's like an accountability

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:22.820 
simple but it's like an accountability
where<00:05:20.219> you<00:05:20.580> know<00:05:20.880> and<00:05:21.240> others<00:05:21.719> know<00:05:22.050> where

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:22.830 
where you know and others know where

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:24.920

you're<00:05:23.039> at<00:05:23.069> of<00:05:23.430> your<00:05:23.550> goal<00:05:23.729> if<00:05:24.659> you<00:05:24.780> let

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:24.930 
you're at of your goal if you let

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:26.149 
you're at of your goal if you let
yourself<00:05:25.229> off<00:05:25.289> the<00:05:25.349> hook<00:05:25.469> and<00:05:25.770> don't<00:05:25.919> have<00:05:26.069> the

00:05:26.149 --> 00:05:26.159 
yourself off the hook and don't have the

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:27.709 
yourself off the hook and don't have the
accountability<00:05:26.550> piece<00:05:26.729> none<00:05:27.270> of<00:05:27.389> this<00:05:27.449> works

00:05:27.709 --> 00:05:27.719 
accountability piece none of this works

00:05:27.719 --> 00:05:29.059 
accountability piece none of this works
and<00:05:28.229> you<00:05:28.319> can't<00:05:28.500> create<00:05:28.680> accountability

00:05:29.059 --> 00:05:29.069 
and you can't create accountability

00:05:29.069 --> 00:05:31.070 
and you can't create accountability
until<00:05:29.669> you<00:05:29.759> have<00:05:29.880> a<00:05:29.909> goal<00:05:30.180> so<00:05:30.750> they're<00:05:30.930> very

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:31.080 
until you have a goal so they're very

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:33.379 
until you have a goal so they're very
sequential<00:05:31.590> you<00:05:32.159> have<00:05:32.430> to<00:05:32.699> do<00:05:32.880> them<00:05:33.060> in<00:05:33.210> order

00:05:33.379 --> 00:05:33.389 
sequential you have to do them in order

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:35.689 
sequential you have to do them in order
so<00:05:34.080> focus<00:05:34.500> number<00:05:34.740> one<00:05:34.889> on<00:05:35.159> the<00:05:35.310> wildly

00:05:35.689 --> 00:05:35.699 
so focus number one on the wildly

00:05:35.699 --> 00:05:38.029
