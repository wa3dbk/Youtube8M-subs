00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.050 
but but to let go or the gash slow you
down<00:02:04.119> just<00:02:04.509> enough<00:02:05.220> to<00:02:06.220> make<00:02:06.250> those<00:02:06.640> terms

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
down just enough to make those terms

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:12.090 
down just enough to make those terms
flawlessly<00:02:07.900> I<00:02:10.230> haven't<00:02:11.230> found<00:02:11.410> a<00:02:11.620> turn<00:02:11.830> yet

but I needed to really hold the

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.860 
but I needed to really hold the
