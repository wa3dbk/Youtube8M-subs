in there this is our little supply unit
inside<00:01:02.829> this<00:01:03.010> bit<00:01:03.219> of<00:01:03.309> the<00:01:03.519> nasty<00:01:03.910> heat<00:01:04.090> shrink

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390 
inside this bit of the nasty heat shrink

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.810 
inside this bit of the nasty heat shrink
we've<00:01:04.510> got<00:01:04.720> on<00:01:04.810> the<00:01:04.900> side<00:01:05.080> it<00:01:05.350> for<00:01:05.530> the<00:01:05.760> for<00:01:06.760> the

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:06.820 
we've got on the side it for the for the

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.210 
we've got on the side it for the for the
pass-by<00:01:07.030> for<00:01:07.420> the<00:01:07.480> camera<00:01:07.840> so<00:01:08.800> all<00:01:08.980> in<00:01:09.130> all

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.220 
pass-by for the camera so all in all

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.670 
pass-by for the camera so all in all
this<00:01:09.370> setup<00:01:09.580> works<00:01:10.000> really<00:01:10.330> well<00:01:10.560> can<00:01:11.560> give

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 
this setup works really well can give

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.540 
this setup works really well can give
you<00:01:11.770> a<00:01:11.800> good<00:01:11.950> long<00:01:13.650> longer<00:01:14.650> distance<00:01:15.280> flight

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:15.550 
you a good long longer distance flight

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.030 
you a good long longer distance flight
up<00:01:16.270> to<00:01:16.330> I<00:01:16.510> suppose<00:01:16.870> about<00:01:17.050> a<00:01:17.230> mile<00:01:17.620> and<00:01:17.830> a<00:01:17.860> half

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:18.040 
up to I suppose about a mile and a half

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.650 
up to I suppose about a mile and a half
something<00:01:18.400> like<00:01:18.640> that<00:01:18.790> maybe<00:01:18.940> further<00:01:19.270> there

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:19.660 
something like that maybe further there

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:20.760 
something like that maybe further there
maybe<00:01:19.780> other<00:01:20.020> people<00:01:20.200> have<00:01:20.320> gone<00:01:20.500> further

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770 
maybe other people have gone further

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.760 
maybe other people have gone further
than<00:01:21.010> that<00:01:21.660> but<00:01:22.660> the<00:01:22.990> whole<00:01:23.140> thing<00:01:23.410> about<00:01:23.590> this

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
than that but the whole thing about this

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.700 
than that but the whole thing about this
is<00:01:23.950> this<00:01:24.100> is<00:01:24.160> cheap<00:01:24.520> the<00:01:25.380> framework<00:01:26.380> here<00:01:26.590> the

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:26.710 
is this is cheap the framework here the

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:28.950 
is this is cheap the framework here the
actual<00:01:27.010> chassis<00:01:27.490> the<00:01:27.760> plane<00:01:28.450> is<00:01:28.630> only<00:01:28.840> about

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:28.960 
actual chassis the plane is only about

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.020 
actual chassis the plane is only about
18<00:01:29.320> euros<00:01:29.680> the<00:01:30.310> rest<00:01:30.490> of<00:01:30.550> the<00:01:30.640> bits<00:01:30.820> and<00:01:30.940> pieces

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.030 
18 euros the rest of the bits and pieces

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:32.940 
18 euros the rest of the bits and pieces
all<00:01:31.480> add<00:01:31.690> up<00:01:31.720> to<00:01:31.840> no<00:01:32.530> more<00:01:32.680> than<00:01:32.800> about<00:01:32.860> a

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
all add up to no more than about a

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.440 
all add up to no more than about a
hundred<00:01:33.280> euros<00:01:33.400> so<00:01:33.850> if<00:01:33.940> you're<00:01:34.030> gonna<00:01:34.120> lose<00:01:34.300> it

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
hundred euros so if you're gonna lose it

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.100 
hundred euros so if you're gonna lose it
in<00:01:34.570> a<00:01:34.660> tree<00:01:34.930> or<00:01:35.280> if<00:01:36.280> you<00:01:36.370> lose<00:01:36.490> signal<00:01:36.910> it's

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
in a tree or if you lose signal it's

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.180 
in a tree or if you lose signal it's
it's<00:01:38.110> not<00:01:38.290> the<00:01:38.440> end<00:01:38.590> of<00:01:38.680> the<00:01:38.740> world

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:39.190 
it's not the end of the world

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:41.100 
it's not the end of the world
ok<00:01:39.910> so<00:01:39.970> there<00:01:40.240> you<00:01:40.270> go<00:01:40.390> most<00:01:40.630> of<00:01:40.780> you<00:01:40.870> will<00:01:41.020> have
