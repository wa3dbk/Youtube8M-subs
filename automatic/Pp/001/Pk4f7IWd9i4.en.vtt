00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
this thing going fast enough so I hit

another jet back into the design even

another jet back into the design even
that<00:01:16.670> didn't<00:01:16.909> give<00:01:17.030> me<00:01:17.150> two<00:01:17.270> Mach<00:01:17.450> three<00:01:17.810> but

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.110 
that didn't give me two Mach three but

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.550 
that didn't give me two Mach three but
it<00:01:18.200> was<00:01:18.350> still<00:01:19.060> fast<00:01:20.060> enough<00:01:20.390> to<00:01:20.570> avoid<00:01:20.689> some

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
it was still fast enough to avoid some

something I don't quite understand is
why<00:01:37.460> this<00:01:37.520> was<00:01:37.940> cancelled<00:01:38.270> and<00:01:38.750> after<00:01:39.050> being

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
why this was cancelled and after being

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.240 
why this was cancelled and after being
