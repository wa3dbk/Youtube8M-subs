00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
I don't think it's not great but I

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.630 
I don't think it's not great but I
decided<00:02:22.880> okay<00:02:23.660> I<00:02:24.050> progressively<00:02:24.980> a<00:02:25.070> table

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
decided okay I progressively a table

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.780 
decided okay I progressively a table
finish<00:02:25.940> I<00:02:26.240> played<00:02:27.170> double<00:02:27.410> prison<00:02:27.709> I<00:02:28.370> put<00:02:28.670> this

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
finish I played double prison I put this

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.550 
finish I played double prison I put this
over<00:02:28.970> air<00:02:29.209> force<00:02:29.420> just<00:02:30.230> because<00:02:31.269> like<00:02:32.269> I<00:02:32.660> was

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
over air force just because like I was

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.410 
over air force just because like I was
expecting<00:02:33.800> like<00:02:33.980> memos<00:02:34.400> and<00:02:34.850> it's<00:02:35.209> like<00:02:35.330> good

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
expecting like memos and it's like good

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.210 
expecting like memos and it's like good
against<00:02:35.660> wigan<00:02:35.959> but<00:02:36.140> I<00:02:36.170> figured<00:02:36.920> like<00:02:37.040> three

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
against wigan but I figured like three

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:38.350 
against wigan but I figured like three
places<00:02:37.489> and<00:02:37.610> wasn't<00:02:37.790> her<00:02:37.880> again<00:02:38.120> smooches

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
places and wasn't her again smooches

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:39.850 
places and wasn't her again smooches
because<00:02:38.600> they<00:02:38.660> never<00:02:38.750> attack<00:02:39.019> that<00:02:39.560> was<00:02:39.709> just

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
because they never attack that was just

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.440 
because they never attack that was just
like<00:02:39.950> Senator<00:02:40.250> graveyard<00:02:40.550> so<00:02:41.180> I<00:02:41.209> probably

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
like Senator graveyard so I probably

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.479 
like Senator graveyard so I probably
good<00:02:41.720> not<00:02:42.170> playing<00:02:42.380> air<00:02:42.500> force<00:02:42.709> because<00:02:43.190> it<00:02:43.340> I

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:43.489 
good not playing air force because it I

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:45.100 
good not playing air force because it I
don't<00:02:43.760> think<00:02:43.850> Memphis<00:02:44.090> is<00:02:44.330> not<00:02:44.450> great<00:02:44.630> like

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
don't think Memphis is not great like

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
don't think Memphis is not great like
it's<00:02:45.290> always<00:02:45.380> gonna<00:02:45.530> be<00:02:45.650> a<00:02:45.680> wonderful<00:02:45.800> one
