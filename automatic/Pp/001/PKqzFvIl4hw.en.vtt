 very good to all the kids 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:07.230
 welcome to my channel we are here in 

00:00:04.109 --> 00:00:08.880
 a tutorial on how to download maps for 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:13.260
 Minecraft 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:15.180
 minecraft 1.7 good vale we started 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:18.349
 I always use this website for the 

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:21.869
 mods for maps and for so many things 

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:23.490
 I'll leave everything in the description and if I 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:27.119
 I wanted to leave some as downloaded 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.980
 here there are many more websites that 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.810
 Well, I 'm not going to put all 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.410
 I'm going to download for example this 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.940
 same 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:35.940
 I will give you to download 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.920
 and I have an impressive cough 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:47.600
 let's jump advertising and 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:51.519
 it will automatically be a download now 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.519
 we wait and we install it 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:00.060
 this I think there is no need to wait 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:07.520
 well we hope that you have nothing 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:10.090
 this is fast download the truth let's go 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:14.260
 to show in folder I have two 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:18.370
 we take whatever it is I will leave this 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:22.000
 you give extract here and extract a 

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:26.700
 folder now you are going to here 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:29.080
 search you put % app data percent 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:33.100
 roaming 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:36.220
 and if you have windows 7 you go to the circle 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:39.370
 of windows you put % app of data by 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:44.440
 hundred I will take here and those that you have 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:46.600
 xp then you give to execute and it is already 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:51.580
 that's why the view I think is the same as 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:53.590
 the 76 point minecraft you give to 6 and 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.540
 here for example I who was before 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.050
 testing it because 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:01.020
 I was trying to see if it worked 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:03.570
 I have given here we take it we drag it and 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.240
 we closed everything 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:09.479
 but now we open the man craft so that 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.730
 you see that it works perfectly from what 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:16.310
 I'm not kidding you 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.310
 once 7.4 I have 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.950
 we give him a player and here he is 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.950
 there it is 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.780
 good 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.390
 I will miss the minecraft with qantas 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.950
 already so I 'm going to close it and well 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.700
