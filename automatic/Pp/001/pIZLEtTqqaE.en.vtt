overall I think it's a quite fun game at

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.890 
overall I think it's a quite fun game at
the<00:04:28.420> top<00:04:28.660> you<00:04:28.780> can<00:04:28.900> even<00:04:29.350> see<00:04:29.590> my<00:04:29.830> arm

my progress so I'm already halfway to

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:41.460 
my progress so I'm already halfway to
destroying<00:04:37.270> the<00:04:38.190> castle<00:04:39.190> so<00:04:40.139> here<00:04:41.139> I<00:04:41.169> need<00:04:41.380> to

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470

00:05:50.719 --> 00:05:50.729 
might want to think about

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:53.279 
might want to think about
retrying<00:05:51.729> rather<00:05:52.060> than<00:05:52.300> wasting<00:05:52.810> your<00:05:52.990> coins

00:05:53.279 --> 00:05:53.289

like about this game is well since it's

00:05:57.699 --> 00:05:59.969 
like about this game is well since it's
a<00:05:57.759> free<00:05:57.970> title<00:05:58.330> it's<00:05:58.570> quite<00:05:58.870> obvious<00:05:59.259> that

00:05:59.969 --> 00:05:59.979 
a free title it's quite obvious that

00:05:59.979 --> 00:06:04.140 
a free title it's quite obvious that
you're<00:06:00.580> going<00:06:00.699> to<00:06:00.759> have<00:06:00.910> our<00:06:03.150> micro

transactions<00:06:04.720> within<00:06:04.990> it<00:06:05.199> but<00:06:05.800> what<00:06:05.919> I<00:06:05.949> like

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:06.130 
transactions within it but what I like

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:08.820 
transactions within it but what I like
about<00:06:06.160> it<00:06:06.699> is<00:06:07.030> that<00:06:07.060> it's<00:06:07.479> not<00:06:07.810> a<00:06:08.110> premium

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:08.830 
about it is that it's not a premium

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:10.920 
about it is that it's not a premium
currency<00:06:09.039> and<00:06:09.490> that<00:06:09.639> you<00:06:10.300> basically<00:06:10.509> have

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:10.930 
currency and that you basically have

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:13.800 
currency and that you basically have
exactly<00:06:11.380> the<00:06:11.500> same<00:06:11.590> currency<00:06:12.160> as<00:06:12.630> the<00:06:13.630> one

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:13.810 
exactly the same currency as the one

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:17.790 
exactly the same currency as the one
that<00:06:13.960> you<00:06:14.020> can<00:06:14.199> earn<00:06:14.440> in-game<00:06:14.740> so<00:06:16.320> if<00:06:17.320> you

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:17.800 
that you can earn in-game so if you

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:19.469 
that you can earn in-game so if you
really<00:06:18.100> don't<00:06:18.250> want<00:06:18.400> to<00:06:18.550> pay<00:06:18.699> for<00:06:18.970> it<00:06:19.120> you<00:06:19.330> can

00:06:19.469 --> 00:06:19.479 
really don't want to pay for it you can

00:06:19.479 --> 00:06:24.689 
really don't want to pay for it you can
just<00:06:19.660> play<00:06:20.350> it<00:06:21.270> free<00:06:22.440> truly<00:06:23.440> free<00:06:23.650> it's<00:06:24.460> quite
