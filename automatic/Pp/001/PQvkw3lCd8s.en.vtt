tomorrow

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.590 
tomorrow
I<00:02:02.189> guess<00:02:02.640> all<00:02:02.880> throughout<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.240> day<00:02:03.270> because

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
I guess all throughout the day because

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.600 
I guess all throughout the day because
it's<00:02:04.500> not<00:02:04.619> really<00:02:04.799> like<00:02:04.920> an<00:02:05.009> official<00:02:05.369> release

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
it's not really like an official release

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:06.800 
it's not really like an official release
so<00:02:05.939> we<00:02:05.969> don't<00:02:06.240> really<00:02:06.329> know<00:02:06.479> what's<00:02:06.600> coming

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
so we don't really know what's coming

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.050 
so we don't really know what's coming
out<00:02:06.930> at<00:02:07.469> midnight<00:02:07.649> or<00:02:08.099> 12<00:02:08.610> o'clock<00:02:08.670> the<00:02:08.970> next

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060
