00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.690 
there in out in their world and their
environment<00:01:58.259> in<00:01:58.770> their<00:01:58.920> community<00:01:59.369> so<00:01:59.579> we

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
environment in their community so we

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.060 
environment in their community so we
have<00:01:59.820> a<00:01:59.850> mini<00:02:00.149> community<00:02:00.719> in<00:02:01.020> our<00:02:01.469> classroom

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
have a mini community in our classroom

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.810 
have a mini community in our classroom
and<00:02:02.369> so<00:02:02.579> I<00:02:03.509> know<00:02:03.780> I<00:02:04.380> know<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.399> communities

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
and so I know I know the communities

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.370 
and so I know I know the communities
that<00:02:06.090> the<00:02:06.180> children<00:02:06.509> that<00:02:06.630> I'm<00:02:06.750> you<00:02:07.110> know<00:02:07.140> I've

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
that the children that I'm you know I've

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:08.510 
that the children that I'm you know I've
students<00:02:07.770> heart<00:02:07.950> or<00:02:08.099> I<00:02:08.160> had<00:02:08.310> long-term

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
students heart or I had long-term

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.040 
students heart or I had long-term
assignments<00:02:09.239> I<00:02:09.270> knew<00:02:09.450> where<00:02:09.840> they<00:02:09.989> were

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
assignments I knew where they were

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.390 
assignments I knew where they were
coming<00:02:10.349> from<00:02:10.590> but<00:02:10.709> I<00:02:10.860> don't<00:02:11.039> know<00:02:11.129> where<00:02:11.310> these

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
coming from but I don't know where these

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.449 
coming from but I don't know where these
kids<00:02:11.670> are<00:02:11.760> coming<00:02:11.879> from<00:02:12.090> I<00:02:12.239> don't<00:02:12.330> know

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
kids are coming from I don't know

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:16.030 
kids are coming from I don't know
and<00:02:13.700> and<00:02:14.299> as<00:02:14.510> I<00:02:14.659> hear<00:02:15.140> from<00:02:15.409> friends<00:02:15.769> it's<00:02:16.010> like

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
and and as I hear from friends it's like

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.059 
and and as I hear from friends it's like
so<00:02:16.760> some<00:02:17.150> behavioral<00:02:18.080> challenges<00:02:18.260> is<00:02:18.680> just<00:02:18.709> as

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:19.069 
so some behavioral challenges is just as

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:20.770 
so some behavioral challenges is just as
similar<00:02:19.400> to<00:02:19.430> the<00:02:19.640> behavior<00:02:19.970> challenges<00:02:20.209> here

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
similar to the behavior challenges here

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.809 
similar to the behavior challenges here
you<00:02:21.260> know<00:02:21.409> but<00:02:21.650> the<00:02:21.769> difference<00:02:22.159> maybe<00:02:22.400> is

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:22.819 
you know but the difference maybe is

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:25.600 
you know but the difference maybe is
that<00:02:23.269> there<00:02:23.480> is<00:02:23.629> support<00:02:24.440> and<00:02:25.040> they<00:02:25.159> do<00:02:25.220> bring

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
that there is support and they do bring

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.030 
that there is support and they do bring
teachers<00:02:25.819> from<00:02:26.120> all<00:02:26.239> over<00:02:26.269> not<00:02:26.750> just<00:02:27.040> United

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
teachers from all over not just United

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.770 
teachers from all over not just United
States<00:02:28.310> but<00:02:28.580> two<00:02:28.760> from<00:02:29.150> New<00:02:29.269> Zealand<00:02:29.299> from

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:29.780 
States but two from New Zealand from

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.860 
States but two from New Zealand from
Canada<00:02:30.409> from<00:02:31.010> the<00:02:31.129> UK<00:02:31.579> from<00:02:31.970> Australia

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
Canada from the UK from Australia

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.210 
Canada from the UK from Australia
you<00:02:33.110> know<00:02:33.230> this<00:02:33.379> they're<00:02:33.590> pulling<00:02:33.890> teachers

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
you know this they're pulling teachers

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.009 
you know this they're pulling teachers
from<00:02:34.370> all<00:02:34.519> over<00:02:34.909> you<00:02:35.150> know<00:02:35.269> and<00:02:35.510> I<00:02:35.599> think<00:02:35.840> that

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:36.019 
from all over you know and I think that

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:38.229 
from all over you know and I think that
just<00:02:36.049> what<00:02:36.349> breaks<00:02:36.890> it<00:02:37.040> even<00:02:37.459> more<00:02:37.760> rich<00:02:38.000> to

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239 
just what breaks it even more rich to

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:40.089 
just what breaks it even more rich to
educational<00:02:38.840> system<00:02:39.170> because<00:02:39.349> not<00:02:39.590> only<00:02:39.890> that

00:02:40.089 --> 00:02:40.099 
educational system because not only that

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:41.680 
educational system because not only that
you<00:02:40.190> have<00:02:40.220> a<00:02:40.400> teaching<00:02:40.670> by<00:02:40.940> there<00:02:41.180> are<00:02:41.269> diverse

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
you have a teaching by there are diverse

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:43.089 
you have a teaching by there are diverse
from<00:02:41.900> their<00:02:42.049> experiences<00:02:42.769> and<00:02:42.950> their

00:02:43.089 --> 00:02:43.099 
from their experiences and their

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:44.289 
from their experiences and their
backgrounds<00:02:43.700> and<00:02:43.790> they're<00:02:43.909> coming<00:02:44.180> together

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:44.299 
backgrounds and they're coming together

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:46.869 
backgrounds and they're coming together
to<00:02:45.230> co-create<00:02:45.470> curriculum<00:02:46.340> and<00:02:46.489> things<00:02:46.670> like

00:02:46.869 --> 00:02:46.879 
to co-create curriculum and things like

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:48.699 
to co-create curriculum and things like
that<00:02:47.120> and<00:02:47.299> experiences<00:02:47.959> for<00:02:48.109> these<00:02:48.200> students

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
that and experiences for these students

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:51.670 
that and experiences for these students
and<00:02:48.829> teach<00:02:49.359> but<00:02:50.359> the<00:02:50.480> students<00:02:50.930> are<00:02:51.079> also

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
and teach but the students are also

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.830 
and teach but the students are also
bringing<00:02:52.280> themselves<00:02:52.459> you<00:02:53.060> know<00:02:53.180> and<00:02:53.420> so<00:02:53.599> you

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
bringing themselves you know and so you

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.539 
bringing themselves you know and so you
have<00:02:54.140> a<00:02:54.170> globe<00:02:54.799> you<00:02:54.980> already<00:02:55.340> have<00:02:55.549> a<00:02:55.760> global

00:02:57.539 --> 00:02:57.549 
have a globe you already have a global

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:00.039 
have a globe you already have a global
conversation<00:02:58.549> happening<00:02:59.390> in<00:02:59.510> the<00:02:59.569> common<00:02:59.930> in

00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:00.049 
conversation happening in the common in

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:02.770 
conversation happening in the common in
in<00:03:00.260> the<00:03:00.440> classroom<00:03:00.970> the<00:03:01.970> the<00:03:02.180> consciousness

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
in the classroom the the consciousness

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.259 
in the classroom the the consciousness
is<00:03:03.019> just<00:03:03.260> raised<00:03:03.650> to<00:03:03.890> a<00:03:03.950> whole<00:03:04.159> new<00:03:04.340> level<00:03:04.549> when

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:05.269 
is just raised to a whole new level when

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:07.149 
is just raised to a whole new level when
you<00:03:05.420> had<00:03:05.659> those<00:03:05.959> levels<00:03:06.409> of<00:03:06.530> influence<00:03:06.890> you

00:03:07.149 --> 00:03:07.159 
you had those levels of influence you

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:09.849

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
together only if the world really works

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:13.300 
together only if the world really works
that<00:03:11.659> way<00:03:11.900> you<00:03:12.260> know<00:03:12.409> I'm<00:03:12.530> saying<00:03:12.739> then<00:03:13.010> you

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
conversation you can understand that

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.520 
conversation you can understand that
maybe<00:03:16.910> we're<00:03:17.120> not<00:03:17.209> as<00:03:17.389> different<00:03:17.720> at<00:03:18.380> the<00:03:18.500> same

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
maybe we're not as different at the same

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.740 
maybe we're not as different at the same
time<00:03:18.829> our<00:03:18.980> difference<00:03:19.340> is<00:03:19.519> is<00:03:19.760> what's<00:03:20.209> mixed
