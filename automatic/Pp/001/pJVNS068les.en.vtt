00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
two three four and you'd have bedrock

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.660

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.820 
and this is pretty crazy to be honest
goes<00:01:10.110> way<00:01:10.799> down<00:01:11.010> I<00:01:11.310> mean<00:01:11.820> way<00:01:12.090> down

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
goes way down I mean way down

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.920 
goes way down I mean way down
the<00:01:14.430> only<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:14.820> only<00:01:14.850> bad<00:01:15.330> thing<00:01:15.360> about<00:01:15.600> this

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
the only the only bad thing about this

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.880 
the only the only bad thing about this
is<00:01:16.110> that<00:01:16.850> no<00:01:17.850> oars<00:01:18.270> can<00:01:18.720> be<00:01:18.840> mined<00:01:19.110> on<00:01:19.410> this<00:01:19.620> map

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
is that no oars can be mined on this map

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.650 
is that no oars can be mined on this map
which<00:01:20.640> kind<00:01:20.970> of<00:01:21.060> sucks<00:01:21.390> but<00:01:22.460> I<00:01:23.460> don't<00:01:24.390> think

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:24.660 
which kind of sucks but I don't think

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:26.990 
which kind of sucks but I don't think
really<00:01:24.870> it's<00:01:25.200> intended<00:01:25.590> for<00:01:26.040> actual<00:01:26.610> you<00:01:26.970> know
