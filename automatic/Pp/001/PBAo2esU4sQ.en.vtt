the<00:02:23.410> drive<00:02:23.650> set<00:02:23.980> to<00:02:24.940> hold<00:02:25.180> that<00:02:25.360> wave<00:02:25.630> and<00:02:26.380> here

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
the drive set to hold that wave and here

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:29.130 
the drive set to hold that wave and here
we<00:02:26.920> go<00:02:27.069> into<00:02:27.160> the<00:02:27.250> back<00:02:27.519> just<00:02:28.420> curl<00:02:28.720> in<00:02:28.870> it<00:02:28.900> up

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
we go into the back just curl in it up

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.839 
we go into the back just curl in it up
like<00:02:29.440> I<00:02:29.560> said<00:02:29.800> with<00:02:30.010> the<00:02:30.099> standard<00:02:31.500> curl<00:02:32.849> and

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:33.849 
like I said with the standard curl and

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:37.949 
like I said with the standard curl and
then<00:02:34.380> smooth<00:02:35.380> the<00:02:35.410> ends<00:02:35.880> under<00:02:36.880> and<00:02:37.120> rolling

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
then smooth the ends under and rolling

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:43.590 
then smooth the ends under and rolling
it<00:02:38.080> back<00:02:38.230> up<00:02:38.530> to<00:02:38.880> create<00:02:39.880> the<00:02:40.060> pin<00:02:40.810> curls<00:02:42.600> like

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600 
it back up to create the pin curls like

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.050 
it back up to create the pin curls like
you<00:02:43.810> would<00:02:44.019> again<00:02:44.620> with<00:02:44.830> the<00:02:44.980> finger<00:02:45.670> wave<00:02:45.790> pin

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
you would again with the finger wave pin

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:52.850 
you would again with the finger wave pin
Pro<00:02:46.269> set<00:02:47.489> or<00:02:48.840> these<00:02:49.840> waves<00:02:50.080> and<00:02:50.290> barrel<00:02:50.650> curls

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
Pro set or these waves and barrel curls

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.220 
Pro set or these waves and barrel curls
now<00:02:53.860> pull<00:02:54.190> this<00:02:54.730> technique<00:02:55.090> you<00:02:55.269> could<00:02:55.420> leave

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
now pull this technique you could leave

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:01.890 
now pull this technique you could leave
the<00:02:56.410> waves<00:02:56.590> in<00:02:57.069> a<00:02:58.110> nice<00:02:59.190> separation<00:03:00.190> and<00:03:00.900> be

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
the waves in a nice separation and be

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.530 
the waves in a nice separation and be
misses<00:03:02.260> so<00:03:02.410> much<00:03:02.590> pattern<00:03:02.910> but<00:03:03.910> again

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
misses so much pattern but again

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.210 
misses so much pattern but again
practicing<00:03:05.260> and<00:03:05.590> playing<00:03:05.739> around<00:03:05.950> with

practicing and playing around with

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.349 
practicing and playing around with
different<00:03:08.790> techniques<00:03:09.790> with<00:03:10.000> your<00:03:10.150> curling

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:10.359 
different techniques with your curling

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:12.120 
different techniques with your curling
iron<00:03:10.600> for<00:03:10.959> different<00:03:11.200> wave<00:03:11.350> patterns<00:03:11.859> and

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130 
iron for different wave patterns and

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:15.000 
iron for different wave patterns and
curls<00:03:12.660> here<00:03:13.660> I<00:03:13.690> like<00:03:14.049> the<00:03:14.200> definition<00:03:14.650> how<00:03:14.920> it

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
curls here I like the definition how it

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.520 
curls here I like the definition how it
looks<00:03:15.160> in<00:03:15.280> this<00:03:15.400> angle<00:03:15.690> though<00:03:16.690> I<00:03:17.109> probably

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
looks in this angle though I probably

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:24.180 
looks in this angle though I probably
wasn't<00:03:18.010> happy<00:03:18.430> with<00:03:22.109> run<00:03:23.109> to<00:03:23.200> the<00:03:23.320> head<00:03:23.500> and

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
wasn't happy with run to the head and

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:26.490 
wasn't happy with run to the head and
also<00:03:24.549> just<00:03:24.700> wanting<00:03:24.970> to<00:03:25.000> see<00:03:25.329> it's<00:03:26.260> come<00:03:26.470> down

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
also just wanting to see it's come down

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.400 
also just wanting to see it's come down
how<00:03:26.829> much<00:03:26.980> of<00:03:27.160> the<00:03:27.280> weight<00:03:27.430> held<00:03:27.989> more<00:03:28.989> wave<00:03:29.170> on

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
how much of the weight held more wave on

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:34.319 
how much of the weight held more wave on
the<00:03:29.500> front<00:03:29.890> and<00:03:30.690> towards<00:03:31.690> that<00:03:31.750> side<00:03:32.230> back<00:03:33.329> it

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:34.329 
the front and towards that side back it

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:38.099 
the front and towards that side back it
wasn't<00:03:34.569> as<00:03:36.359> set<00:03:37.359> in<00:03:37.540> like<00:03:37.810> you<00:03:37.930> would<00:03:38.019> have

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:38.109 
wasn't as set in like you would have

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:41.009 
wasn't as set in like you would have
with<00:03:38.170> a<00:03:38.380> wet<00:03:38.560> set<00:03:39.150> but<00:03:40.150> it<00:03:40.269> still<00:03:40.540> allowed<00:03:40.840> me

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:41.019 
with a wet set but it still allowed me

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:44.220 
with a wet set but it still allowed me
to<00:03:41.049> set<00:03:41.890> the<00:03:42.069> hair<00:03:42.340> and<00:03:43.030> then<00:03:43.120> go<00:03:43.269> back<00:03:43.450> in

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
to set the hair and then go back in

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:48.150 
to set the hair and then go back in
I<00:03:44.260> did<00:03:44.890> some<00:03:45.180> barrels<00:03:46.180> on<00:03:46.840> that<00:03:47.109> corner<00:03:47.799> from

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.160 
I did some barrels on that corner from

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.180 
I did some barrels on that corner from
behind<00:03:48.400> the<00:03:48.549> ear<00:03:48.579> forward<00:03:49.799> more<00:03:50.799> reminiscent

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.190 
behind the ear forward more reminiscent

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:55.050 
behind the ear forward more reminiscent
of<00:03:51.489> the<00:03:51.730> fifties<00:03:52.540> style

and<00:03:55.180> on<00:03:55.780> that<00:03:55.959> last<00:03:56.430> you<00:03:57.430> need<00:03:57.760> section<00:03:58.270> t<00:03:58.990> sit

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 
and on that last you need section t sit

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.059 
and on that last you need section t sit
