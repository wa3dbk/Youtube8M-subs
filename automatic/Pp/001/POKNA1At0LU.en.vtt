00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:56.960 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.570 

right<00:01:57.860> back<00:01:58.430> hanging<00:01:58.850> around<00:01:59.090> for<00:01:59.180> a<00:01:59.390> while

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:00.580 
right back hanging around for a while

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:13.040 
right back hanging around for a while
rancid<00:02:01.580> first<00:02:03.280> okay

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.300 

sake<00:02:13.620> of<00:02:13.740> argument

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:23.300 

philosophy<00:02:17.310> we<00:02:17.520> can<00:02:17.700> source<00:02:17.940> that<00:02:18.210> way

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.720 

and

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:35.770 

okay

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.610 

what<00:02:36.230> happens<00:02:36.680> is<00:02:36.920> this<00:02:37.190> sort<00:02:37.819> of<00:02:37.940> pulls<00:02:38.209> in

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
what happens is this sort of pulls in

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.770 
what happens is this sort of pulls in
dry<00:02:39.620> air<00:02:39.920> and<00:02:40.340> so<00:02:40.550> things<00:02:40.850> tend<00:02:41.330> to<00:02:41.450> stick

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
dry air and so things tend to stick

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.420 
dry air and so things tend to stick
there<00:02:42.110> it's<00:02:42.890> sort<00:02:43.100> of<00:02:43.130> like<00:02:43.340> lint<00:02:44.180> all<00:02:45.050> right

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
there it's sort of like lint all right

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.130 
there it's sort of like lint all right
into<00:02:46.430> the<00:02:46.550> outdoor<00:02:46.910> world<00:02:47.209> again<00:02:47.690> I'm<00:02:47.930> doing

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
into the outdoor world again I'm doing

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.400 
into the outdoor world again I'm doing
this<00:02:48.350> outdoors<00:02:49.750> normally<00:02:50.750> I<00:02:50.780> probably<00:02:51.170> will

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
this outdoors normally I probably will

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.440

00:02:59.350 --> 00:02:59.360 
so the critters will get in it but we

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.140

there's<00:03:42.400> a<00:03:42.490> bit<00:03:42.670> of<00:03:42.790> flexibility<00:03:43.600> to<00:03:43.750> it<00:03:43.990> I

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:44.140 
there's a bit of flexibility to it I

00:03:44.140 --> 00:04:07.350 
there's a bit of flexibility to it I
think<00:03:44.470> this<00:03:45.100> can<00:03:45.400> be<00:03:45.430> done<00:03:45.730> by<00:03:46.000> hours<00:03:47.010> just<00:04:06.360> let

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:07.360 
think this can be done by hours just let

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.360 
think this can be done by hours just let
it<00:04:07.480> cool<00:04:07.660> down<00:04:07.720> and<00:04:08.320> then<00:04:08.410> I<00:04:08.650> will<00:04:08.830> pack<00:04:09.100> it<00:04:09.130> up

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370 
it cool down and then I will pack it up

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:13.080 
it cool down and then I will pack it up
in<00:04:09.610> a<00:04:09.850> baggy<00:04:10.180> and<00:04:11.340> probably<00:04:12.340> a<00:04:12.400> couple<00:04:12.610> venue

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.090 
in a baggy and probably a couple venue

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:15.300 
in a baggy and probably a couple venue
so<00:04:13.240> I<00:04:13.330> have<00:04:13.570> to<00:04:13.750> retrieve<00:04:14.140> taste<00:04:14.530> treats<00:04:14.890> I

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310 
so I have to retrieve taste treats I

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:21.090 
so I have to retrieve taste treats I
don't<00:04:16.180> have<00:04:16.330> a<00:04:16.360> sealer<00:04:16.810> yet<00:04:17.790> so<00:04:18.790> I<00:04:19.180> will<00:04:20.100> face

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:21.100 
don't have a sealer yet so I will face

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.220 
don't have a sealer yet so I will face
it<00:04:21.280> with<00:04:21.459> meaningless<00:04:21.910> within<00:04:22.330> the<00:04:22.420> week<00:04:22.630> I

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:23.230 
it with meaningless within the week I

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:25.440 
it with meaningless within the week I
wanted<00:04:23.950> to<00:04:24.070> do<00:04:24.250> this<00:04:24.430> mainly<00:04:24.850> for<00:04:25.090> the<00:04:25.150> taste

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:25.450 
wanted to do this mainly for the taste

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:30.600 
wanted to do this mainly for the taste
test<00:04:26.010> features<00:04:27.010> of<00:04:27.160> all<00:04:27.340> this

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:30.610 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:33.550 

probably<00:04:31.610> can't<00:04:31.820> see<00:04:32.000> it<00:04:32.090> through<00:04:32.240> that<00:04:32.480> I<00:04:32.750> can

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:33.560 
probably can't see it through that I can

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.400 
probably can't see it through that I can
freeze<00:04:33.860> that<00:04:34.190> or<00:04:34.520> I<00:04:34.550> can<00:04:34.820> use<00:04:35.090> that<00:04:35.230> and<00:04:36.230> where

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:36.410 
freeze that or I can use that and where

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:37.960 
freeze that or I can use that and where
I<00:04:36.440> can<00:04:36.530> vacuum<00:04:36.860> seal<00:04:37.340> it<00:04:37.370> I<00:04:37.700> don't<00:04:37.850> have<00:04:37.940> a

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:37.970 
I can vacuum seal it I don't have a

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:41.110 
I can vacuum seal it I don't have a
vacuum<00:04:38.240> sealer<00:04:38.690> yet<00:04:39.020> but<00:04:39.740> I<00:04:40.070> think<00:04:40.970> I'm<00:04:41.030> not

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 
vacuum sealer yet but I think I'm not

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.090 
vacuum sealer yet but I think I'm not
freeze<00:04:41.360> part<00:04:41.630> of<00:04:41.750> that<00:04:41.870> it's<00:04:42.170> really<00:04:42.350> tasty

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:43.100 
freeze part of that it's really tasty

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:46.290 
freeze part of that it's really tasty
the<00:04:44.170> seasonings<00:04:45.170> I<00:04:45.320> put<00:04:45.590> in<00:04:45.740> there

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:46.300 
the seasonings I put in there

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.260 
the seasonings I put in there
concentrated<00:04:47.300> when<00:04:47.960> I<00:04:47.990> cooked<00:04:48.290> it<00:04:48.440> down

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:49.270 
concentrated when I cooked it down

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:52.450 
concentrated when I cooked it down
dehydrated<00:04:50.270> it<00:04:50.390> down<00:04:50.660> and<00:04:51.250> having<00:04:52.250> that

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:52.460 
dehydrated it down and having that

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:56.370 
dehydrated it down and having that
happen<00:04:52.900> really<00:04:53.900> makes<00:04:54.350> a<00:04:54.530> good<00:04:54.970> tasty

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:56.380 
happen really makes a good tasty

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:58.720 
happen really makes a good tasty
sensation<00:04:57.380> here<00:04:57.680> so<00:04:58.190> you<00:04:58.250> don't<00:04:58.490> want<00:04:58.640> to

00:04:58.720 --> 00:04:58.730 
sensation here so you don't want to

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:00.940 
sensation here so you don't want to
really<00:04:59.000> overdo<00:04:59.630> your<00:04:59.810> spices<00:05:00.200> when<00:05:00.650> you<00:05:00.710> put

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:00.950 
really overdo your spices when you put

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:06.180 
really overdo your spices when you put
this<00:05:01.040> together<00:05:01.280> I<00:05:02.860> really<00:05:03.860> don't<00:05:04.040> think<00:05:04.100> so

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:06.190 
this together I really don't think so

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:11.560 
this together I really don't think so
any<00:05:07.190> rate<00:05:07.510> that's<00:05:08.510> it<00:05:09.880> okay<00:05:10.880> here's<00:05:11.150> a<00:05:11.210> video

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:11.570
