00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:37.720 
after waiting till the PVC primer

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.389 
after waiting till the PVC primer
doesn't<00:01:38.170> run<00:01:38.320> anymore<00:01:38.500> and<00:01:38.860> when<00:01:38.979> tilting

paint the puc cement onto both sides and

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:43.499 
paint the puc cement onto both sides and
hold<00:01:41.829> them<00:01:42.009> together<00:01:42.159> for<00:01:42.490> 30<00:01:42.640> seconds<00:01:43.060> to

00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:43.509 
hold them together for 30 seconds to

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:45.060 
hold them together for 30 seconds to
prevent<00:01:43.810> them<00:01:43.960> from<00:01:43.990> sliding<00:01:44.350> apart<00:01:44.679> now

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:45.070 
prevent them from sliding apart now

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.450 
prevent them from sliding apart now

gauge<00:02:24.569> will<00:02:24.900> go<00:02:25.050> on<00:02:25.230> to<00:02:25.440> one<00:02:25.650> cap<00:02:25.920> and<00:02:26.160> the

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
gauge will go on to one cap and the

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.729 
gauge will go on to one cap and the
valve<00:02:26.489> stem<00:02:26.760> will<00:02:27.000> go<00:02:27.120> on<00:02:27.239> to<00:02:27.390> the<00:02:27.690> other<00:02:27.870> first

gauge and valve stem tightly since this

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.540 
gauge and valve stem tightly since this
will<00:02:33.930> be<00:02:34.080> holding<00:02:34.349> them<00:02:34.500> around<00:02:34.980> an<00:02:35.160> average

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
will be holding them around an average

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.270 
will be holding them around an average
of<00:02:35.700> 50<00:02:35.940> psi<00:02:36.390> use<00:02:36.989> the<00:02:37.170> epoxy<00:02:37.680> putty<00:02:37.830> to<00:02:38.040> seal

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
of 50 psi use the epoxy putty to seal

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
the space between each object look at

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.320 
the space between each object look at
the<00:02:40.379> video<00:02:40.650> to<00:02:40.680> see<00:02:40.950> it<00:02:41.040> better

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.330 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.210 

just<00:02:45.330> quick<00:02:45.569> now<00:02:45.750> if<00:02:45.870> that<00:02:46.019> cap<00:02:46.500> is<00:02:46.530> really<00:02:46.980> not

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
just quick now if that cap is really not

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.589 
just quick now if that cap is really not
the<00:02:47.340> right<00:02:47.370> size<00:02:47.730> that's<00:02:48.480> just<00:02:48.750> an<00:02:48.870> example<00:02:50.599> if

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:51.599 
the right size that's just an example if

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:53.809 
the right size that's just an example if
you<00:02:52.200> look<00:02:52.319> at<00:02:52.440> the<00:02:52.530> valve<00:02:52.769> stem<00:02:53.099> and<00:02:53.400> you<00:02:53.670> look

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
you look at the valve stem and you look

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:55.819 
you look at the valve stem and you look
at<00:02:53.940> the<00:02:54.030> PVC<00:02:54.390> cap<00:02:54.630> you<00:02:54.840> can<00:02:54.959> see<00:02:55.200> that<00:02:55.440> they<00:02:55.799> are

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:55.829 
at the PVC cap you can see that they are

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:58.339 
at the PVC cap you can see that they are
bonded<00:02:56.549> together<00:02:56.910> by<00:02:57.150> the<00:02:57.299> epoxy<00:02:57.870> putty<00:02:58.019> and

bonded together by the epoxy putty and

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:00.229 
bonded together by the epoxy putty and
this<00:02:58.590> is<00:02:58.739> pasted<00:02:59.099> on<00:02:59.190> the<00:02:59.220> very<00:02:59.489> tightly<00:02:59.790> so<00:03:00.060> no

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
this is pasted on the very tightly so no

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:02.030 
this is pasted on the very tightly so no
air<00:03:00.450> can<00:03:00.720> escape<00:03:00.750> because<00:03:01.260> it<00:03:01.470> holds<00:03:01.620> a<00:03:01.799> lot<00:03:01.920> of

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
air can escape because it holds a lot of

you<00:03:39.190> choose<00:03:39.489> for<00:03:40.239> storage<00:03:40.569> purposes<00:03:41.079> you<00:03:41.349> can

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
you choose for storage purposes you can

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:43.470 
you choose for storage purposes you can
get<00:03:41.560> a<00:03:41.590> straight<00:03:41.950> connector<00:03:42.459> to<00:03:42.609> add<00:03:42.790> on<00:03:43.030> after

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
get a straight connector to add on after

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.210 
get a straight connector to add on after
the<00:03:43.569> ball<00:03:43.750> valve<00:03:43.959> so<00:03:44.260> the<00:03:44.349> long<00:03:44.560> barrel<00:03:44.950> can<00:03:45.190> be

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
the ball valve so the long barrel can be

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:48.180 
the ball valve so the long barrel can be
removed<00:03:46.030> if<00:03:46.930> you<00:03:47.140> look<00:03:47.290> at<00:03:47.409> my<00:03:47.620> older<00:03:47.859> videos

with<00:03:48.519> the<00:03:48.730> actual<00:03:49.150> cannon<00:03:49.720> in<00:03:49.870> it<00:03:49.989> you<00:03:50.470> can<00:03:50.650> see

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
with the actual cannon in it you can see

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.940 
with the actual cannon in it you can see
that<00:03:50.980> it<00:03:51.370> has<00:03:51.549> been<00:03:52.260> just<00:03:53.260> like<00:03:53.409> that<00:03:53.620> so<00:03:53.739> I<00:03:53.799> can

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 
that it has been just like that so I can

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:55.740 
that it has been just like that so I can
store<00:03:54.280> it<00:03:54.430> and<00:03:54.639> carry<00:03:55.000> places<00:03:55.420> it's<00:03:55.599> much

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
store it and carry places it's much

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:57.440 
store it and carry places it's much
easier<00:03:56.079> that<00:03:56.230> way<00:03:56.379> but<00:03:56.680> this<00:03:56.799> way<00:03:56.859> is<00:03:57.220> also

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
easier that way but this way is also

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:02.550 
easier that way but this way is also
smoother<00:03:58.450> for<00:03:58.720> it<00:03:58.840> so<00:03:59.049> your<00:03:59.799> choice<00:04:01.560> making

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
smoother for it so your choice making

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.020 
smoother for it so your choice making
the<00:04:02.739> rocket<00:04:03.069> is<00:04:03.190> quite<00:04:03.400> simple

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
the rocket is quite simple

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:05.849 
the rocket is quite simple
take<00:04:04.269> a<00:04:04.299> toilet<00:04:04.659> paper<00:04:04.750> roll<00:04:04.900> cover<00:04:05.409> with<00:04:05.620> duct

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:05.859 
take a toilet paper roll cover with duct

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:07.680 
take a toilet paper roll cover with duct
tape<00:04:06.040> and<00:04:06.220> stick<00:04:06.430> on<00:04:06.579> the<00:04:06.670> end<00:04:06.879> of<00:04:07.180> the<00:04:07.329> cannon

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690 
tape and stick on the end of the cannon

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:11.640 
tape and stick on the end of the cannon
then<00:04:08.260> pump<00:04:08.799> the<00:04:08.920> cannon<00:04:09.340> up<00:04:09.459> to<00:04:09.730> 50<00:04:10.299> 60<00:04:10.750> 70<00:04:11.230> psi

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:11.650 
then pump the cannon up to 50 60 70 psi

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:14.160 
then pump the cannon up to 50 60 70 psi
and<00:04:11.950> hit<00:04:12.730> the<00:04:12.909> ball<00:04:13.060> valve<00:04:13.329> it's<00:04:13.780> really

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.170 
and hit the ball valve it's really

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:16.110 
and hit the ball valve it's really
awesome<00:04:14.349> to<00:04:14.560> shoot<00:04:14.859> really<00:04:15.129> loud<00:04:15.400> I<00:04:15.760> want<00:04:15.909> to

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:16.120 
awesome to shoot really loud I want to

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:26.850 
awesome to shoot really loud I want to
