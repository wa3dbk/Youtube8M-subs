elements of tactics especially like

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.130 
elements of tactics especially like
ghost<00:01:14.790> recon<00:01:15.000> you<00:01:15.630> know<00:01:15.720> you're<00:01:15.870> giving

taxing<00:01:18.120> throughout<00:01:18.420> flanking<00:01:18.930> enemies<00:01:19.410> you

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
taxing throughout flanking enemies you

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.820 
taxing throughout flanking enemies you
can<00:01:19.980> call<00:01:20.550> in<00:01:20.700> air<00:01:20.850> support<00:01:21.030> and<00:01:21.630> I<00:01:22.440> couldn't

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
can call in air support and I couldn't

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.770

felt<00:01:23.070> that<00:01:23.250> that<00:01:23.490> works<00:01:23.760> really<00:01:24.000> well<00:01:24.120> what

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
felt that that works really well what

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.840 
felt that that works really well what
happens<00:01:25.080> if<00:01:25.170> you<00:01:25.290> scale<00:01:25.560> that<00:01:25.770> up<00:01:25.830> 50<00:01:26.340> times<00:01:26.610> if

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
happens if you scale that up 50 times if

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.520 
happens if you scale that up 50 times if
you<00:01:26.970> make<00:01:27.120> that<00:01:27.270> into<00:01:27.510> a<00:01:27.540> massive<00:01:27.990> battlefield

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
you make that into a massive battlefield

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.220 
you make that into a massive battlefield
and<00:01:28.770> then<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.400> other<00:01:29.550> thing<00:01:29.670> we<00:01:29.970> did<00:01:30.210> was<00:01:30.870> we

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:31.230 
and then the other thing we did was we

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:32.990 
and then the other thing we did was we
thought<00:01:31.440> okay<00:01:31.950> how<00:01:32.100> can<00:01:32.160> we<00:01:32.370> put<00:01:32.610> you<00:01:32.760> in<00:01:32.790> the

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
thought okay how can we put you in the

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.600 
thought okay how can we put you in the
role<00:01:33.150> of<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:34.110> general<00:01:34.530> how<00:01:35.010> to<00:01:35.070> generals

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:09.069 
five years ago in SOCOM it worked eighty

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:11.580 
five years ago in SOCOM it worked eighty
percent<00:02:09.160> at<00:02:09.610> work<00:02:09.759> pretty<00:02:10.030> well<00:02:10.230> but<00:02:11.230> five

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
percent at work pretty well but five

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.199 
percent at work pretty well but five
more<00:02:11.800> years<00:02:11.950> the<00:02:12.190> software's<00:02:12.700> better<00:02:13.000> the

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:13.209 
more years the software's better the

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:14.820 
more years the software's better the
machines<00:02:13.600> are<00:02:13.780> more<00:02:13.930> powerful<00:02:14.290> we<00:02:14.680> can

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
machines are more powerful we can

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.790 
machines are more powerful we can
optimize<00:02:15.010> it<00:02:15.489> more<00:02:15.670> design<00:02:16.209> for<00:02:16.480> it<00:02:16.569> more<00:02:16.800> so

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
optimize it more design for it more so

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.290 
optimize it more design for it more so
we're<00:02:18.220> really<00:02:18.430> going<00:02:18.790> to<00:02:18.880> get<00:02:19.000> to<00:02:19.120> like<00:02:19.270> a

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
we're really going to get to like a

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.420 
we're really going to get to like a
hundred<00:02:19.660> percent<00:02:19.750> recognition<00:02:20.530> on<00:02:20.620> that<00:02:20.830> it's

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
hundred percent recognition on that it's
