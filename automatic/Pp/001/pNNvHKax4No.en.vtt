regular not the breakup just walls we

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.600 
regular not the breakup just walls we
also<00:02:46.310> behind<00:02:46.670> here<00:02:46.970> have<00:02:47.180> glowstone<00:02:48.459> we<00:02:49.459> also

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
also behind here have glowstone we also

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:55.030 
also behind here have glowstone we also
have<00:02:49.880> Sol<00:02:50.150> sent<00:02:50.480> another<00:02:51.250> rack<00:02:52.250> and<00:02:52.640> ice<00:02:54.040> over

have Sol sent another rack and ice over

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.220 
have Sol sent another rack and ice over
here<00:02:55.070> we<00:02:55.550> have<00:02:55.760> some<00:02:56.150> pics<00:02:56.540> on<00:02:56.720> one<00:02:56.840> stuff<00:02:57.080> he

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
here we have some pics on one stuff he

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.520 
here we have some pics on one stuff he
added<00:02:57.620> we<00:02:58.250> have<00:02:58.280> the<00:02:58.760> fossil<00:02:59.000> we<00:02:59.959> have<00:03:00.170> the

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
added we have the fossil we have the

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:06.060 
added we have the fossil we have the
fire<00:03:00.770> stone<00:03:01.100> we<00:03:01.790> have<00:03:02.110> or<00:03:03.160> you<00:03:04.160> also<00:03:04.340> have<00:03:04.670> the

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.070 
fire stone we have or you also have the

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:10.030 
fire stone we have or you also have the
thinner<00:03:07.070> or<00:03:07.520> better<00:03:08.510> sooner<00:03:08.900> and<00:03:09.200> I<00:03:09.590> think<00:03:09.920> he

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
thinner or better sooner and I think he

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.479 
thinner or better sooner and I think he
changed<00:03:10.310> the<00:03:10.700> thing<00:03:11.060> for<00:03:11.239> bauxite<00:03:12.310> we<00:03:13.310> also

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:13.489 
changed the thing for bauxite we also

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:15.280 
changed the thing for bauxite we also
have<00:03:13.880> an<00:03:14.090> infinite<00:03:14.510> water<00:03:14.660> source<00:03:14.810> right<00:03:15.230> here

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
have an infinite water source right here

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.350 
have an infinite water source right here
but<00:03:15.590> he<00:03:15.650> also<00:03:15.800> changed<00:03:16.370> the<00:03:16.610> textures<00:03:17.090> for

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
but he also changed the textures for

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.740 
but he also changed the textures for
water<00:03:17.570> running<00:03:18.170> and<00:03:18.560> regular<00:03:19.040> still<00:03:19.600> he<00:03:20.600> also

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
water running and regular still he also

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.860 
water running and regular still he also
changed<00:03:21.200> the<00:03:21.530> texture<00:03:21.920> for<00:03:22.310> the<00:03:22.640> lava<00:03:23.030> still

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
changed the texture for the lava still

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.009 
changed the texture for the lava still
and<00:03:24.140> flowing<00:03:24.860> I<00:03:25.070> think<00:03:25.970> also<00:03:26.180> the<00:03:26.510> boat<00:03:26.720> but

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:27.019 
and flowing I think also the boat but

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:31.720 
and flowing I think also the boat but
I'm<00:03:27.350> not<00:03:27.590> a<00:03:27.650> hundred<00:03:27.920> percent<00:03:28.100> sure<00:03:30.459> he<00:03:31.459> also

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
I'm not a hundred percent sure he also

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.000 
I'm not a hundred percent sure he also
changed<00:03:32.630> some<00:03:32.989> of<00:03:33.080> the<00:03:33.140> flowers<00:03:33.500> he<00:03:33.650> is<00:03:33.709> still

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 
changed some of the flowers he is still

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:36.100 
changed some of the flowers he is still
working<00:03:34.220> on<00:03:34.549> them<00:03:34.730> and<00:03:34.850> also<00:03:35.630> he<00:03:35.810> is<00:03:35.840> still

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:36.110 
working on them and also he is still

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:38.229 
working on them and also he is still

dandelion and we have puppy over here we

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.630 
dandelion and we have puppy over here we
have<00:03:46.250> all<00:03:46.660> well<00:03:47.660> not<00:03:47.870> all<00:03:48.110> but<00:03:48.140> mainly<00:03:48.920> all<00:03:49.160> of

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:49.640 
have all well not all but mainly all of

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:54.190 
have all well not all but mainly all of
the<00:03:50.680> paintings<00:03:52.120> there<00:03:53.120> are<00:03:53.269> more<00:03:53.570> but<00:03:53.930> they

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:54.200 
the paintings there are more but they

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.009 
the paintings there are more but they
are<00:03:54.350> hard<00:03:54.620> to<00:03:54.709> get<00:03:55.010> so<00:03:55.910> and<00:03:56.510> they're<00:03:56.900> pretty

00:03:57.009 --> 00:03:57.019 
are hard to get so and they're pretty

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:01.240 
are hard to get so and they're pretty
rare<00:03:57.260> so<00:03:57.709> I<00:03:58.100> think<00:03:58.549> get<00:03:58.970> them<00:03:59.120> all<00:03:59.420> but<00:04:00.250> yeah

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.250 
rare so I think get them all but yeah

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:04.090 
rare so I think get them all but yeah
these<00:04:01.610> are<00:04:01.910> very<00:04:02.180> cool<00:04:02.540> actually<00:04:02.900> I<00:04:03.560> really

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:04.100

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:10.250 
if we go down here I put the item design

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:13.690 
if we go down here I put the item design
he<00:04:11.150> also<00:04:11.299> changed<00:04:11.900> the<00:04:12.049> main<00:04:12.230> the<00:04:12.709> stuff

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:13.700

he also changed the main the stuff
smaller<00:04:14.299> so<00:04:15.019> the<00:04:15.890> item<00:04:16.310> texture<00:04:16.820> for<00:04:17.120> the

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 
smaller so the item texture for the

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:20.259 
smaller so the item texture for the
pokeballs<00:04:17.989> and<00:04:18.200> stuff<00:04:18.530> looks<00:04:19.310> smaller<00:04:19.790> and

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:20.269 
pokeballs and stuff looks smaller and

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:23.200 
pokeballs and stuff looks smaller and
less<00:04:20.450> you<00:04:21.140> just<00:04:21.320> dense<00:04:21.650> and<00:04:21.979> bulky<00:04:22.729> so<00:04:22.940> he's

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210 
less you just dense and bulky so he's

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:24.940 
less you just dense and bulky so he's
trying<00:04:23.600> to<00:04:23.810> do<00:04:23.930> that<00:04:24.080> with<00:04:24.140> all<00:04:24.560> of<00:04:24.590> these
