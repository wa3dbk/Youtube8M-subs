00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:28.579 
um but not much so a few gaps in here

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:31.760 
um but not much so a few gaps in here
but<00:01:29.579> not<00:01:30.240> enough<00:01:30.509> to<00:01:30.659> annoy<00:01:30.869> me<00:01:30.930> but<00:01:31.619> they

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
but not enough to annoy me but they

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:32.359 
but not enough to annoy me but they
might<00:01:31.950> annoy<00:01:32.130> you

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
might annoy you

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.319 
might annoy you
I<00:01:32.579> don't<00:01:32.970> know<00:01:33.030> um<00:01:33.409> I<00:01:34.409> like<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.579> shape<00:01:35.880> he<00:01:36.090> has

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
I don't know um I like the shape he has

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.819 
I don't know um I like the shape he has
although<00:01:36.750> his<00:01:37.740> cockpit<00:01:38.100> is<00:01:38.549> a<00:01:39.090> little

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:39.829 
although his cockpit is a little

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:43.399 
although his cockpit is a little
different<00:01:40.829> than<00:01:41.040> the<00:01:41.220> actual<00:01:41.520> f-22<00:01:42.409> it

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
different than the actual f-22 it

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.050 
different than the actual f-22 it
doesn't<00:01:43.770> actually<00:01:43.890> go<00:01:44.159> to<00:01:44.310> here<00:01:44.610> it<00:01:44.820> kind<00:01:45.000> of

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
doesn't actually go to here it kind of

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.469 
doesn't actually go to here it kind of
stops<00:01:45.450> here<00:01:45.930> and<00:01:46.110> then<00:01:46.350> starts<00:01:46.649> to<00:01:46.740> slant<00:01:47.100> down

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
stops here and then starts to slant down

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:49.999 
stops here and then starts to slant down
but<00:01:48.479> I<00:01:48.720> really<00:01:48.990> couldn't<00:01:49.259> figure<00:01:49.439> out<00:01:49.619> a<00:01:49.680> way

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
but I really couldn't figure out a way

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.870 
but I really couldn't figure out a way
to<00:01:50.340> do<00:01:50.759> that<00:01:51.710> without<00:01:52.710> him<00:01:53.159> looking<00:01:53.520> like<00:01:53.700> crap

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
to do that without him looking like crap

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.990 
to do that without him looking like crap
he's<00:01:54.869> got<00:01:55.049> his<00:01:55.140> little<00:01:55.290> fins<00:01:55.860> here<00:01:56.280> that<00:01:56.579> you

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
he's got his little fins here that you

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.440 
he's got his little fins here that you
know<00:01:57.149> you<00:01:57.210> can<00:01:57.719> come<00:01:57.960> like<00:01:58.200> this<00:01:59.000> or<00:02:00.000> whatever

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
know you can come like this or whatever

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:07.570 
know you can come like this or whatever
on<00:02:03.049> but<00:02:05.240> Starscream<00:02:06.240> ladies<00:02:06.630> and<00:02:06.810> gentlemen

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
on but Starscream ladies and gentlemen

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:12.050 
on but Starscream ladies and gentlemen
here<00:02:08.580> is<00:02:08.610> a<00:02:08.819> size<00:02:09.149> comparison<00:02:09.379> with<00:02:11.060> revenge

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
here is a size comparison with revenge

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.810 
here is a size comparison with revenge
of<00:02:12.150> the<00:02:12.209> Fallen<00:02:12.569> Megatron

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:13.820 
of the Fallen Megatron

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.150 
of the Fallen Megatron
as<00:02:14.820> you<00:02:15.030> can<00:02:15.180> see<00:02:15.450> he<00:02:16.110> is<00:02:16.140> much<00:02:16.380> smaller<00:02:16.830> and

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
as you can see he is much smaller and

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.940 
as you can see he is much smaller and
I'm<00:02:17.670> not<00:02:18.120> exactly<00:02:18.450> sure<00:02:18.720> if<00:02:19.080> that<00:02:19.320> size

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
I'm not exactly sure if that size

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.850 
I'm not exactly sure if that size
accurate<00:02:20.490> but<00:02:20.850> I<00:02:21.060> doubt<00:02:21.300> it<00:02:21.510> even<00:02:21.690> so<00:02:22.500> I<00:02:22.530> like

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
accurate but I doubt it even so I like

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.590 
accurate but I doubt it even so I like
to<00:02:22.980> think<00:02:23.160> of<00:02:23.690> Starscream<00:02:24.690> as<00:02:24.870> a<00:02:25.650> weaker

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
to think of Starscream as a weaker

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:31.060 
to think of Starscream as a weaker
life-form<00:02:27.600> as<00:02:27.870> it<00:02:28.290> were<00:02:28.440> um

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:33.830 

meaning<00:02:32.070> smaller<00:02:32.610> more<00:02:33.240> Gympie<00:02:33.660> than

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
meaning smaller more Gympie than

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.370 
meaning smaller more Gympie than
Megatron<00:02:34.380> he<00:02:34.950> tries<00:02:35.430> to<00:02:35.880> get<00:02:36.060> better<00:02:36.600> but<00:02:37.290> he

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
Megatron he tries to get better but he

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.430 
Megatron he tries to get better but he
never<00:02:37.620> is<00:02:38.270> and<00:02:39.270> I<00:02:39.570> just<00:02:39.780> like<00:02:39.960> to<00:02:40.080> think<00:02:40.140> that

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
never is and I just like to think that

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.500 
never is and I just like to think that
so<00:02:40.800> I<00:02:40.830> like<00:02:41.070> the<00:02:41.340> I<00:02:41.520> like<00:02:41.820> the<00:02:41.970> fact<00:02:42.150> that<00:02:42.300> he's

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
so I like the I like the fact that he's

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.390 
so I like the I like the fact that he's
smaller<00:02:44.390> overall<00:02:45.390> I<00:02:45.630> really<00:02:45.810> like<00:02:46.140> this<00:02:46.740> f-22

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
smaller overall I really like this f-22

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.420 
smaller overall I really like this f-22
mode<00:02:47.640> from<00:02:48.630> the<00:02:48.720> bottom<00:02:49.050> not<00:02:49.470> a<00:02:49.530> lot<00:02:49.740> except

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:14.310 
um not an incredibly drastic difference

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:18.100 
um not an incredibly drastic difference
between<00:05:14.760> their<00:05:15.030> height<00:05:15.510> um<00:05:16.910> Starscream's

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:18.110 
between their height um Starscream's

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:27.350

just<00:05:19.110> a<00:05:19.430> little<00:05:20.430> shorter<00:05:22.550> but<00:05:25.550> like<00:05:26.550> I<00:05:26.730> said<00:05:27.060> I

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.360 
just a little shorter but like I said I

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.090 
just a little shorter but like I said I
like<00:05:27.660> to<00:05:27.810> think<00:05:28.050> of<00:05:28.140> them<00:05:28.290> as<00:05:28.500> the<00:05:28.740> smaller

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:29.100 
like to think of them as the smaller

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:33.710 
like to think of them as the smaller
weaker<00:05:29.520> character<00:05:30.270> so<00:05:30.870> that<00:05:32.330> granted<00:05:33.360> I<00:05:33.510> love

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:33.720 
weaker character so that granted I love

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:37.690 
weaker character so that granted I love
Starscream<00:05:34.320> I<00:05:34.560> love<00:05:34.890> the<00:05:34.980> character<00:05:35.400> but

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:37.700 
Starscream I love the character but

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:39.830 
Starscream I love the character but
that's<00:05:38.700> the<00:05:38.820> reason<00:05:39.210> I<00:05:39.270> like<00:05:39.480> it<00:05:39.510> is<00:05:39.690> because

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:39.840 
that's the reason I like it is because

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:41.870 
that's the reason I like it is because
he<00:05:40.470> always<00:05:40.590> tried<00:05:40.920> to<00:05:41.100> do<00:05:41.220> it<00:05:41.370> but<00:05:41.460> he<00:05:41.550> failed

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:41.880 
he always tried to do it but he failed

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:49.880 
he always tried to do it but he failed
epically<00:05:44.060> um<00:05:45.060> but<00:05:45.840> there<00:05:46.230> is<00:05:46.850> Starscream<00:05:48.890> I

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:49.890 
epically um but there is Starscream I

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:52.750 
epically um but there is Starscream I
really<00:05:50.520> like<00:05:50.730> how<00:05:50.910> he<00:05:50.970> turned<00:05:51.270> out

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:52.760
