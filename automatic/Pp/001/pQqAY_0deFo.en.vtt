00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:14.429
 Hello everyone, we are with you today. 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.890
 try to answer the question how much 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.470
 time you can not turn off the computer 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.780
 it will be about stationary computers 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.150
 not laptops in the user manual 

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:26.460
 on some computers factory assembly 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.250
 indicated allowed continuous operation 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.429
 no more than 72 hours then from three days 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.440
 Many people think that during long work 

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:36.390
 computer like all household appliances 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.850
 overheated which contributes to its 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.530
 wear and premature exit from 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.079
 the building is why most users 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.489
 believe that the computer needs 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.429
 regular shutdown 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.350
 in quotes for the rest actually 

00:00:47.429 --> 00:00:50.879
 such an approach can only be justified 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.069
 if you want to save on 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.179
 electricity though modern 

00:00:53.069 --> 00:00:56.249
 desktop computers 

00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:58.530
 possessing sufficient effective 

00:00:56.249 --> 00:01:00.479
 cooling systems are able to work without 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.670
 shutdown for a long time 

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:05.520
 according to some reports up to several 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.830
 months while accelerated wear them 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:09.570
 components are not observed by the way 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.700
 power consumed by modern 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.670
 desktop computer average is 100 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.040
 150 watts which is comparable to two 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.370
 60 light bulbs 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.730
 wat 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:22.650
 and now the main thing is much more harmful 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:25.980
 for the computer is a frequent inclusion 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.630
 and shutdown especially undesirable such 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:29.820
 hard drive mode 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.130
 back to the question how much time 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.780
 you can not turn off the computer 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.390
 unequivocally answer this question 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.030
 quite difficult personally, I think that 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.490
 the most correct decision will be one 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.530
 one day turn on the computer and one time 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.320
 at the end of the work when he is no longer with you 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.290
 need to turn off that is daily 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.330
 home computer work for 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:54.270
 6-8 hours without shutting down completely 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:56.580
 acceptable but if you leave home 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.270
 leave the computer on without 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:01.030
 I do not recommend supervision 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.280
 but if you decide to take a nap to arrange 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.950
 smoke break or lunch break computer 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.990
 better not to turn off in a few 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.869
 minutes and or a couple of hours again its not 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.769
 include we found out that in normal 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:13.810
 cooling 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:16.030
 I emphasize normal cooling 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.010
 the computer can work continuously in 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.269
 for a very long time 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.400
 but sometimes 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:23.310
 everyone is still in need 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.660
 stop don't forget about it 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:28.769
 subscribe to the likes put channel 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.769
