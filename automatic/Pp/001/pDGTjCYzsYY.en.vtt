reattached the screen just pop the pop
connectors<00:02:01.070> back<00:02:01.250> in<00:02:01.430> place<00:02:01.670> this<00:02:02.360> is<00:02:02.420> how<00:02:02.689> you

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 
connectors back in place this is how you

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.440 
connectors back in place this is how you
would<00:02:03.049> replace<00:02:03.439> a<00:02:03.680> damaged<00:02:03.979> screen<00:02:04.450> much

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
would replace a damaged screen much

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:11.570 
would replace a damaged screen much
easier<00:02:05.990> than<00:02:06.170> the<00:02:06.320> iPhone<00:02:06.679> 4<00:02:07.039> and<00:02:07.070> 4s

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.580 

next<00:02:12.570> we<00:02:12.720> are<00:02:12.810> going<00:02:12.930> to<00:02:13.020> remove<00:02:13.290> the<00:02:13.410> battery

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
next we are going to remove the battery

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.730 
next we are going to remove the battery
to<00:02:14.400> do<00:02:14.550> this<00:02:14.730> we<00:02:15.000> first<00:02:15.030> need<00:02:15.420> to<00:02:15.570> remove<00:02:16.320> the

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
to do this we first need to remove the

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.670 
to do this we first need to remove the
cover<00:02:17.550> over<00:02:18.210> the<00:02:18.390> battery<00:02:18.750> connector<00:02:19.200> so<00:02:19.620> we

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
cover over the battery connector so we

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.050 
cover over the battery connector so we
need<00:02:19.830> to<00:02:19.890> remove<00:02:20.130> the<00:02:20.250> small<00:02:20.460> Phillips<00:02:20.760> screws

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
need to remove the small Phillips screws

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:29.670 
need to remove the small Phillips screws
and<00:02:21.330> then<00:02:22.080> release<00:02:22.530> the<00:02:22.710> pop<00:02:22.920> connector

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.160 

the<00:02:30.370> battery<00:02:30.819> connector<00:02:31.329> already<00:02:31.810> released

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
the battery connector already released

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.220 
the battery connector already released
we<00:02:32.769> can<00:02:32.920> now<00:02:33.099> ease<00:02:33.400> up<00:02:33.640> the<00:02:33.790> battery<00:02:34.269> by<00:02:34.959> using

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
we can now ease up the battery by using

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.369 
we can now ease up the battery by using
the<00:02:35.620> clear<00:02:36.250> tap<00:02:36.610> is<00:02:36.879> held<00:02:37.569> in<00:02:37.750> with<00:02:37.780> a<00:02:38.079> little

00:02:38.369 --> 00:02:38.379 
the clear tap is held in with a little

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:41.069 
the clear tap is held in with a little
bit<00:02:38.530> of<00:02:38.590> glue<00:02:38.849> as<00:02:39.849> you<00:02:40.209> can<00:02:40.480> see<00:02:40.659> it<00:02:40.900> is<00:02:41.049> very

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:41.079 
bit of glue as you can see it is very

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:44.160
