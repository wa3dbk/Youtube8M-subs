you've done the work to get there and
your<00:01:19.680> attitude<00:01:19.860> well<00:01:20.729> I<00:01:20.790> think<00:01:20.880> this<00:01:21.060> is

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
your attitude well I think this is

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.640 
your attitude well I think this is
really<00:01:21.330> important<00:01:21.810> for<00:01:21.900> open<00:01:22.170> water<00:01:22.200> screen

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
really important for open water screen

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.770 
really important for open water screen
because<00:01:23.340> if<00:01:23.490> you're<00:01:23.640> in<00:01:23.700> there<00:01:23.880> with<00:01:24.030> over

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
because if you're in there with over

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.840 
because if you're in there with over
2,000<00:01:25.500> other<00:01:25.619> swimmers<00:01:26.009> and<00:01:26.310> competitors

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
2,000 other swimmers and competitors

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.340 
2,000 other swimmers and competitors
then<00:01:27.450> you've<00:01:27.570> really<00:01:27.600> got<00:01:28.049> to<00:01:28.140> have<00:01:28.259> the

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
then you've really got to have the

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.219 
then you've really got to have the
attitude<00:01:28.619> of<00:01:29.540> StuffIt<00:01:30.540> I<00:01:30.659> don't<00:01:30.900> care<00:01:31.110> what
