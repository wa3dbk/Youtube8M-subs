the<00:00:10.549> happy<00:00:11.270> hacking<00:00:11.690> keyboard<00:00:12.320> professional

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:13.100 
the happy hacking keyboard professional

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:18.130 
the happy hacking keyboard professional
two<00:00:13.340> commonly<00:00:14.299> abbreviated<00:00:15.260> as<00:00:15.860> H<00:00:16.789> a<00:00:17.300> KB<00:00:17.750> pro<00:00:18.080> 2

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:18.140 
two commonly abbreviated as H a KB pro 2

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.259 
two commonly abbreviated as H a KB pro 2
and<00:00:18.590> on<00:00:19.280> the<00:00:19.460> bottom<00:00:19.759> you're<00:00:19.849> looking<00:00:20.060> at<00:00:20.179> the

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:20.269 
and on the bottom you're looking at the

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:23.019 
and on the bottom you're looking at the
IBM<00:00:20.660> space-saving<00:00:21.560> keyboard<00:00:22.250> from<00:00:22.789> around

IBM space-saving keyboard from around

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:26.349 
IBM space-saving keyboard from around
1991<00:00:24.070> so<00:00:25.070> the<00:00:25.189> top<00:00:25.429> is<00:00:25.460> a<00:00:25.759> currently

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:26.359 
1991 so the top is a currently

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:28.179 
1991 so the top is a currently
manufactured<00:00:27.050> available<00:00:27.410> model<00:00:27.740> the<00:00:27.890> bottom

manufactured available model the bottom

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:32.050 
manufactured available model the bottom
one<00:00:28.310> is<00:00:28.490> no<00:00:29.000> longer<00:00:29.210> made<00:00:29.529> in<00:00:30.529> this<00:00:31.060> factored

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:32.060 
one is no longer made in this factored

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:37.270 
one is no longer made in this factored
form<00:00:32.599> factor<00:00:32.990> but<00:00:33.850> they're<00:00:34.850> both<00:00:35.860> both<00:00:36.860> my<00:00:37.040> top

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:37.280 
form factor but they're both both my top

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.520 
form factor but they're both both my top
keyboards<00:00:37.670> and<00:00:37.790> in<00:00:37.880> fact<00:00:38.120> I<00:00:38.300> can't<00:00:38.600> pick<00:00:39.290> a

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:39.530 
keyboards and in fact I can't pick a

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.500 
keyboards and in fact I can't pick a
favor<00:00:39.860> I<00:00:40.100> like<00:00:40.280> them<00:00:40.460> both<00:00:40.640> you<00:00:41.180> know<00:00:41.360> they're

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:43.310 
both different now obviously you can see

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:44.560 
both different now obviously you can see
the<00:00:43.520> form<00:00:43.730> factor<00:00:43.880> on<00:00:44.150> each<00:00:44.270> of<00:00:44.390> them<00:00:44.510> is

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.780 
the form factor on each of them is
different<00:00:44.930> but<00:00:45.740> I<00:00:45.800> can<00:00:46.010> use<00:00:46.130> either<00:00:46.460> one

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:46.790

IBM now as you can see there's

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:21.670 
IBM now as you can see there's
definitely<00:01:20.720> a<00:01:20.750> size<00:01:20.960> difference<00:01:21.170> here<00:01:21.470> let<00:01:21.620> me

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680 
definitely a size difference here let me

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.980 
definitely a size difference here let me
sort<00:01:22.250> of<00:01:22.370> move<00:01:22.520> this<00:01:22.700> one<00:01:22.909> in<00:01:23.090> line<00:01:23.659> here<00:01:23.900> with

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990 
sort of move this one in line here with

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.320 
sort of move this one in line here with
the<00:01:24.110> left<00:01:24.320> edge<00:01:24.590> you<00:01:25.460> can<00:01:25.610> definitely<00:01:26.120> see<00:01:26.300> the

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.330 
the left edge you can definitely see the

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.480 
the left edge you can definitely see the
size<00:01:26.630> difference<00:01:26.659> here<00:01:27.230> obviously<00:01:27.440> the<00:01:28.250> happy

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
size difference here obviously the happy

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.149 
size difference here obviously the happy
hacking<00:01:28.640> keyboard<00:01:29.060> is<00:01:29.180> much<00:01:29.360> much<00:01:29.570> smaller

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:30.159 
hacking keyboard is much much smaller

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:33.790 
hacking keyboard is much much smaller
very<00:01:31.159> very<00:01:31.490> small<00:01:31.820> and<00:01:32.030> compact<00:01:32.500> yet<00:01:33.500> it<00:01:33.650> can

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:33.800 
very very small and compact yet it can

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.219 
very very small and compact yet it can
do<00:01:33.950> all<00:01:34.100> the<00:01:34.220> same<00:01:34.400> stuff<00:01:34.670> like<00:01:34.909> it<00:01:35.030> has

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:35.229 
do all the same stuff like it has

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:37.719 
do all the same stuff like it has
embedded<00:01:36.229> keys<00:01:36.620> at<00:01:36.860> you<00:01:36.920> with<00:01:37.100> this<00:01:37.250> function

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:37.729 
embedded keys at you with this function

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:40.060 
embedded keys at you with this function
key<00:01:37.880> here<00:01:38.150> it<00:01:38.600> has<00:01:38.750> like<00:01:38.990> the<00:01:39.229> arrow<00:01:39.530> keys<00:01:40.040> and

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
key here it has like the arrow keys and

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:41.350 
key here it has like the arrow keys and
stuffily<00:01:40.550> but<00:01:40.760> you<00:01:40.850> have<00:01:40.940> to<00:01:41.030> press<00:01:41.210> the

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
stuffily but you have to press the

stuffily but you have to press the
function<00:01:41.630> key<00:01:41.750> I<00:01:43.150> like<00:01:44.150> this<00:01:44.360> one<00:01:44.600> in<00:01:44.900> terms<00:01:45.350> of

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
function key I like this one in terms of

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.530 
function key I like this one in terms of
the<00:01:45.830> ergonomics<00:01:46.430> the<00:01:46.580> one<00:01:46.700> on<00:01:46.790> top<00:01:46.970> the<00:01:47.210> hackey

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.540 
the ergonomics the one on top the hackey

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.719 
the ergonomics the one on top the hackey
had<00:01:47.659> Pappy<00:01:48.110> hawk<00:01:48.260> and<00:01:48.590> keyboard<00:01:48.979> pro<00:01:49.250> 2<00:01:49.310> a

little bit better and I think I can

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.850 
little bit better and I think I can
probably<00:01:52.370> demonstrate<00:01:52.970> that<00:01:53.150> because<00:01:53.770> let<00:01:54.770> me

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
probably demonstrate that because let me

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:56.230 
probably demonstrate that because let me
move<00:01:55.010> this<00:01:55.159> out<00:01:55.310> of<00:01:55.460> the<00:01:55.520> way<00:01:55.640> for<00:01:55.700> a<00:01:55.909> second

everything's<00:02:15.260> real<00:02:15.469> compact<00:02:15.889> will

everything's real compact will

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.570 
everything's real compact will
close<00:02:16.459> within<00:02:17.360> fingers<00:02:17.870> reach<00:02:18.280> so<00:02:19.280> I'm<00:02:19.430> just

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
close within fingers reach so I'm just

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.910 
close within fingers reach so I'm just
sitting<00:02:19.819> here<00:02:19.850> typing<00:02:20.330> and<00:02:20.569> you<00:02:21.020> know<00:02:21.140> I<00:02:21.410> can

just<00:02:22.069> go<00:02:22.190> over<00:02:22.280> here<00:02:22.370> and<00:02:22.640> I<00:02:22.670> don't<00:02:22.819> have<00:02:22.910> to

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
just go over here and I don't have to

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.730 
just go over here and I don't have to
reach<00:02:23.209> very<00:02:23.450> far<00:02:23.480> to<00:02:23.720> get<00:02:23.810> to<00:02:23.959> the<00:02:24.080> Magic

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.740 
reach very far to get to the Magic

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:28.630 
reach very far to get to the Magic
Trackpad<00:02:26.170> contrast<00:02:27.170> that<00:02:27.470> with<00:02:27.680> this<00:02:28.400> one

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
Trackpad contrast that with this one

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.250 
Trackpad contrast that with this one
which<00:02:28.790> is<00:02:28.819> also<00:02:28.940> a<00:02:29.180> space-saving<00:02:29.510> keyboard<00:02:30.200> I

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
which is also a space-saving keyboard I

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:31.960 
which is also a space-saving keyboard I
mean<00:02:30.410> it<00:02:30.770> doesn't<00:02:31.010> have<00:02:31.370> the<00:02:31.640> number<00:02:31.910> of

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
mean it doesn't have the number of

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:33.340 
mean it doesn't have the number of
keypad<00:02:32.330> here<00:02:32.510> on<00:02:32.630> the<00:02:32.720> right<00:02:32.900> which<00:02:33.110> most

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
keypad here on the right which most

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.229 
keypad here on the right which most
model<00:02:33.709> ends<00:02:33.860> do<00:02:34.100> or<00:02:34.220> most<00:02:34.400> other<00:02:34.580> keyboards<00:02:35.030> do

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
model ends do or most other keyboards do

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:38.260 
model ends do or most other keyboards do
so<00:02:35.750> it<00:02:35.840> does<00:02:36.020> help<00:02:36.290> it<00:02:36.470> is<00:02:36.590> better<00:02:36.860> I<00:02:37.819> don't

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.270 
so it does help it is better I don't

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.270 
so it does help it is better I don't
like<00:02:38.569> having<00:02:38.780> a<00:02:38.989> separate<00:02:39.590> number<00:02:39.920> keypad<00:02:40.220> on

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
like having a separate number keypad on

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:41.890 
like having a separate number keypad on
the<00:02:40.400> right<00:02:40.640> because<00:02:41.030> it<00:02:41.270> makes<00:02:41.450> the<00:02:41.569> keyboard

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
the right because it makes the keyboard

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.680 
the right because it makes the keyboard
just<00:02:42.020> too<00:02:42.230> big<00:02:42.500> too<00:02:43.010> long<00:02:43.280> on<00:02:43.580> the<00:02:43.670> right<00:02:43.880> and

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
just too big too long on the right and

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.930 
just too big too long on the right and
much<00:02:44.930> more<00:02:45.230> hard<00:02:46.069> to<00:02:46.310> reach<00:02:46.489> you<00:02:46.700> end<00:02:46.819> up

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
much more hard to reach you end up

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.430 
much more hard to reach you end up
having<00:02:47.030> to<00:02:47.180> reach<00:02:47.450> with<00:02:47.750> your<00:02:47.900> arm<00:02:48.080> quite<00:02:48.380> a

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
having to reach with your arm quite a

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:49.870 
having to reach with your arm quite a
lot<00:02:48.650> and<00:02:48.830> you<00:02:48.890> can<00:02:48.950> get<00:02:49.190> a<00:02:49.220> lot<00:02:49.430> of<00:02:49.459> wrist<00:02:49.730> and

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
lot and you can get a lot of wrist and

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.880 
lot and you can get a lot of wrist and
arm<00:02:50.090> strain<00:02:50.480> that<00:02:50.690> way<00:02:50.900> so<00:02:51.530> this<00:02:51.709> keyboard

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
arm strain that way so this keyboard

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:53.890 
arm strain that way so this keyboard
does<00:02:52.220> bring<00:02:52.519> it<00:02:52.640> in<00:02:52.790> from<00:02:53.030> the<00:02:53.120> normal<00:02:53.480> model<00:02:53.660> M

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
does bring it in from the normal model M

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.830 
does bring it in from the normal model M
keyboard<00:02:54.580> it's<00:02:55.580> certainly<00:02:55.850> more<00:02:56.150> compact<00:02:56.660> and

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
keyboard it's certainly more compact and

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.270 
keyboard it's certainly more compact and
small<00:02:56.989> which<00:02:57.350> is<00:02:57.470> sort<00:02:57.680> of<00:02:57.709> the<00:02:57.830> idea<00:02:58.100> behind

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
small which is sort of the idea behind

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.070 
small which is sort of the idea behind
it<00:02:58.519> but<00:02:59.000> as<00:02:59.150> you<00:02:59.269> can<00:02:59.420> see<00:02:59.600> it's<00:02:59.750> so<00:02:59.900> much

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
it but as you can see it's so much

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.720 
it but as you can see it's so much
bigger<00:03:00.380> and<00:03:00.560> as<00:03:01.220> I'm<00:03:01.340> typing<00:03:01.519> on<00:03:01.819> it<00:03:03.580> to<00:03:04.580> reach

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
bigger and as I'm typing on it to reach

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.670 
bigger and as I'm typing on it to reach
over<00:03:04.910> to<00:03:05.060> the<00:03:05.120> mouse<00:03:05.300> it's<00:03:05.600> a<00:03:05.690> longer<00:03:06.050> reach<00:03:06.260> I

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
over to the mouse it's a longer reach I

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.009 
over to the mouse it's a longer reach I
have<00:03:07.430> to<00:03:07.550> reach<00:03:07.700> through<00:03:08.209> all<00:03:08.360> this<00:03:08.540> area<00:03:08.870> as

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:09.019 
have to reach through all this area as

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:13.390 
have to reach through all this area as
well<00:03:09.170> as<00:03:09.350> some<00:03:09.380> border<00:03:09.860> here<00:03:10.630> so<00:03:11.630> you<00:03:11.690> know<00:03:12.400> in

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
well as some border here so you know in

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.370 
well as some border here so you know in
terms<00:03:14.090> of<00:03:14.269> someone<00:03:14.840> if<00:03:14.959> you<00:03:15.050> use<00:03:15.200> your

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
trackpad or Mouse a lot I do still

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:20.020 
trackpad or Mouse a lot I do still
notice<00:03:18.319> it<00:03:18.500> even<00:03:18.650> on<00:03:18.860> this<00:03:19.010> one<00:03:19.280> like<00:03:19.850> I<00:03:19.970> said

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
notice it even on this one like I said

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:21.280 
notice it even on this one like I said
this<00:03:20.269> one<00:03:20.420> is<00:03:20.510> definitely<00:03:20.690> an<00:03:21.049> improvement

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
this one is definitely an improvement

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.479 
this one is definitely an improvement
over<00:03:21.820> full-size<00:03:22.820> keyboards<00:03:23.480> however

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
over full-size keyboards however

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:26.670 
over full-size keyboards however
comparing<00:03:25.489> it<00:03:25.640> to<00:03:25.670> the<00:03:25.940> happy<00:03:26.239> hacking

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
comparing it to the happy hacking

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.580 
comparing it to the happy hacking
keyboard<00:03:27.680> it's<00:03:28.430> just<00:03:28.730> not<00:03:28.850> as<00:03:29.000> compact<00:03:29.590> that

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
keyboard it's just not as compact that

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:44.660 
like and which seem really durable and

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:48.160 
like and which seem really durable and
really<00:03:44.780> nice<00:03:45.370> the<00:03:46.370> model<00:03:46.730> M<00:03:46.910> I<00:03:47.150> still<00:03:47.959> think

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170 
really nice the model M I still think

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:51.370 
really nice the model M I still think
can't<00:03:48.440> be<00:03:48.500> beat<00:03:48.829> I<00:03:48.980> have<00:03:49.790> a<00:03:49.820> feeling<00:03:50.329> my<00:03:50.510> BM

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:53.570 
engineers when they were designing when

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:54.970 
engineers when they were designing when
they<00:03:53.630> were<00:03:53.720> first<00:03:53.930> designing<00:03:54.530> the<00:03:54.620> model<00:03:54.859> and

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:54.980 
they were first designing the model and

they were first designing the model and
key<00:03:55.130> words<00:03:55.340> really<00:03:56.000> probably<00:03:56.390> did<00:03:56.510> a<00:03:56.540> ton<00:03:56.810> of

key words really probably did a ton of

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.949 
key words really probably did a ton of
research<00:03:57.019> and<00:03:57.470> put<00:03:57.590> a<00:03:57.620> lot<00:03:57.829> of<00:03:57.980> money<00:03:58.100> into

00:03:59.949 --> 00:03:59.959 
research and put a lot of money into

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:02.530 
research and put a lot of money into
keyboards<00:04:00.650> and<00:04:00.829> what<00:04:01.459> makes<00:04:01.760> good<00:04:02.030> keyboards

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:02.540 
keyboards and what makes good keyboards

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.750 
keyboards and what makes good keyboards
and<00:04:02.690> what<00:04:02.810> makes<00:04:02.989> people<00:04:03.079> like<00:04:03.769> typing<00:04:04.640> on

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:04.760 
and what makes people like typing on

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:06.069 
and what makes people like typing on
keywords<00:04:05.150> and<00:04:05.269> what<00:04:05.359> makes<00:04:05.540> them<00:04:05.690> feel<00:04:05.900> good

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:06.079

keywords and what makes them feel good
to<00:04:06.230> type<00:04:06.440> on<00:04:06.590> because<00:04:06.980> I<00:04:08.019> think<00:04:09.019> it's<00:04:09.290> you<00:04:09.470> know

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560 
to type on because I think it's you know

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:10.750 
to type on because I think it's you know
maybe<00:04:09.650> maybe<00:04:10.040> they<00:04:10.160> were<00:04:10.220> using<00:04:10.459> a<00:04:10.519> typewriter

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760 
maybe maybe they were using a typewriter

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:13.720 
maybe maybe they were using a typewriter
as<00:04:11.150> a<00:04:11.180> model<00:04:12.010> you<00:04:13.010> know<00:04:13.040> to<00:04:13.160> make<00:04:13.340> it<00:04:13.370> feel<00:04:13.609> more

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:13.730 
as a model you know to make it feel more

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:14.890 
as a model you know to make it feel more
like<00:04:13.850> a<00:04:13.940> typewriter<00:04:14.299> or<00:04:14.420> something<00:04:14.720> like<00:04:14.840> that

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900 
like a typewriter or something like that

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.640 
like a typewriter or something like that
but

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:18.650 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:20.800 

now<00:04:19.639> this<00:04:19.790> one<00:04:19.910> is<00:04:19.970> just<00:04:20.150> great<00:04:20.329> to<00:04:20.359> type<00:04:20.630> on

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
now this one is just great to type on

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:22.210 
now this one is just great to type on
it's<00:04:20.989> just<00:04:21.049> written<00:04:21.470> so<00:04:21.709> this<00:04:21.829> like<00:04:22.040> makes

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:22.220 
it's just written so this like makes

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:25.810 
it's just written so this like makes
typing<00:04:22.460> fun<00:04:22.940> you<00:04:23.180> know<00:04:24.280> so<00:04:25.280> in<00:04:25.400> terms<00:04:25.580> of<00:04:25.669> the

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:25.820 
typing fun you know so in terms of the

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.300 
typing fun you know so in terms of the
fuel<00:04:26.120> I<00:04:26.210> certainly<00:04:26.480> prefer<00:04:26.930> the<00:04:27.040> IBM<00:04:28.040> space

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.310 
fuel I certainly prefer the IBM space

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:31.900 
fuel I certainly prefer the IBM space
saver<00:04:28.580> but<00:04:29.419> in<00:04:29.600> terms<00:04:29.810> of<00:04:29.990> like<00:04:30.490> urgh<00:04:31.490> anomic

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:31.910

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490 
sand space issues especially if you

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:36.460 
sand space issues especially if you
don't<00:04:34.580> have<00:04:34.699> like<00:04:34.910> a<00:04:34.970> lot<00:04:35.150> of<00:04:35.270> space<00:04:35.479> or<00:04:35.720> you

don't have like a lot of space or you

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:38.469 
don't have like a lot of space or you
know<00:04:36.560> if<00:04:36.680> you<00:04:36.770> use<00:04:36.979> your<00:04:37.100> mouth<00:04:37.310> a<00:04:37.340> lot<00:04:37.699> I<00:04:37.850> think

know if you use your mouth a lot I think

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:41.920 
know if you use your mouth a lot I think

the happy hacking can't be beat I know
the<00:04:42.050> benefit<00:04:42.380> is<00:04:42.500> the<00:04:42.590> happy<00:04:42.830> hacking

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:43.040 
the benefit is the happy hacking

the benefit is the happy hacking

current model that you can actually buy

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:48.700

whereas the model and space saver is

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:50.379 
whereas the model and space saver is
very<00:04:48.979> hard<00:04:49.250> to<00:04:49.310> find<00:04:49.610> right<00:04:50.090> now<00:04:50.210> it's

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:50.389 
very hard to find right now it's

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:51.340 
very hard to find right now it's
starting<00:04:50.600> to<00:04:50.690> sort<00:04:50.840> of<00:04:50.900> sort<00:04:51.169> of<00:04:51.229> like<00:04:51.320> a

starting to sort of sort of like a

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:54.290 
collector's item at this point so it can

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:55.690 
collector's item at this point so it can
be<00:04:54.380> a<00:04:54.410> little<00:04:54.500> bit<00:04:54.650> difficult<00:04:55.010> to<00:04:55.040> find<00:04:55.280> but<00:04:55.490> I

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:10.990 
cons of each one I forgot to mention
also<00:05:09.800> on<00:05:09.889> the<00:05:09.950> happy<00:05:10.250> hacking<00:05:10.430> keyboard<00:05:10.880> the

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:11.000 
also on the happy hacking keyboard the

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.580 
also on the happy hacking keyboard the
keo<00:05:11.240> keyboard<00:05:11.780> layout<00:05:12.110> is<00:05:12.260> a<00:05:12.289> little

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:12.590 
keo keyboard layout is a little

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:14.620 
keo keyboard layout is a little
different<00:05:12.979> like<00:05:13.400> you<00:05:13.550> don't<00:05:13.700> have<00:05:13.880> the<00:05:13.940> caps

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:14.630 
different like you don't have the caps

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:16.120 
different like you don't have the caps
lock<00:05:14.750> key<00:05:14.900> right<00:05:15.380> here<00:05:15.410> instead<00:05:15.830> you<00:05:15.919> have<00:05:16.039> the

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:16.130 
lock key right here instead you have the

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:18.969 
lock key right here instead you have the
control<00:05:16.580> key<00:05:16.820> here<00:05:17.180> also<00:05:18.050> the<00:05:18.320> backspace<00:05:18.800> or

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:18.979 
control key here also the backspace or

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:21.340 
control key here also the backspace or
the<00:05:19.100> Delete<00:05:19.880> key<00:05:19.940> is<00:05:20.300> right<00:05:20.539> above<00:05:20.780> the<00:05:20.990> return

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:21.350 
the Delete key is right above the return

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:23.260 
the Delete key is right above the return
key<00:05:21.650> so<00:05:22.220> it<00:05:22.280> takes<00:05:22.460> a<00:05:22.550> little<00:05:22.669> bit<00:05:22.789> of<00:05:22.880> getting

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:23.270 
key so it takes a little bit of getting

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:26.980 
key so it takes a little bit of getting
used<00:05:23.479> to<00:05:23.630> to<00:05:24.020> that<00:05:24.550> layout<00:05:25.750> you<00:05:26.750> know<00:05:26.840> your

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:26.990 
used to to that layout you know your

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:28.870 
used to to that layout you know your
delete<00:05:27.260> key<00:05:27.289> is<00:05:27.500> here<00:05:27.830> and<00:05:28.070> rather<00:05:28.460> than<00:05:28.669> on

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:28.880 
delete key is here and rather than on

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:31.420 
delete key is here and rather than on
this<00:05:29.389> one<00:05:29.600> it's<00:05:29.720> way<00:05:29.810> up<00:05:29.960> here<00:05:30.229> and<00:05:31.130> it's<00:05:31.310> not

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:31.430 
this one it's way up here and it's not

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:32.980 
this one it's way up here and it's not
right<00:05:31.580> above<00:05:31.820> the<00:05:32.060> enter<00:05:32.300> key<00:05:32.539> or<00:05:32.900> the<00:05:32.930> return

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:32.990 
right above the enter key or the return

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:35.650 
right above the enter key or the return
key<00:05:33.460> so<00:05:34.460> you<00:05:34.820> know<00:05:34.880> takes<00:05:35.150> getting<00:05:35.389> used<00:05:35.570> to

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:35.660 
key so you know takes getting used to

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:38.200 
key so you know takes getting used to
this<00:05:35.810> keyboard<00:05:36.130> but<00:05:37.130> I<00:05:37.160> find<00:05:37.550> that<00:05:37.639> I<00:05:37.700> can<00:05:37.760> use

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:38.210 
this keyboard but I find that I can use

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:40.510 
this keyboard but I find that I can use
them<00:05:38.360> interchangeably<00:05:38.630> now<00:05:39.229> I'm<00:05:40.130> sort<00:05:40.460> of

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:40.520 
them interchangeably now I'm sort of

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:41.980 
them interchangeably now I'm sort of
used<00:05:40.700> to<00:05:40.789> each<00:05:41.000> of<00:05:41.240> them<00:05:41.360> I<00:05:41.510> just<00:05:41.660> have<00:05:41.900> to

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:41.990 
used to each of them I just have to

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:43.589 
used to each of them I just have to
remember<00:05:42.349> which<00:05:42.500> keyboard<00:05:42.860> I'm<00:05:42.950> on

00:05:43.589 --> 00:05:43.599 
remember which keyboard I'm on

00:05:43.599 --> 00:05:45.790 
remember which keyboard I'm on
occasionally<00:05:44.599> you'll<00:05:44.750> end<00:05:44.900> up<00:05:45.020> you<00:05:45.620> know<00:05:45.650> if

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:45.800 
occasionally you'll end up you know if

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.110 
occasionally you'll end up you know if
you<00:05:45.889> switch<00:05:46.130> under<00:05:46.430> pinning<00:05:46.669> the<00:05:46.760> wrong<00:05:46.880> key

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:47.120 
you switch under pinning the wrong key

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.430 
you switch under pinning the wrong key
sometimes<00:05:47.539> like<00:05:47.690> the<00:05:47.810> Delete<00:05:48.080> key<00:05:48.110> by

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:48.440 
sometimes like the Delete key by

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:50.170 
sometimes like the Delete key by
accident<00:05:48.950> you'll<00:05:49.400> end<00:05:49.550> up<00:05:49.639> hitting<00:05:49.760> up<00:05:50.000> if

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:50.180 
accident you'll end up hitting up if

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:51.100

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:51.110 
you're on this key word you end up

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:52.600 
you're on this key word you end up
hitting<00:05:51.289> this<00:05:51.470> key<00:05:51.740> and<00:05:51.919> sticks<00:05:52.190> you're<00:05:52.430> just

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:52.610

a lot of programmers like the happy
hacking<00:05:59.690> key<00:05:59.990> work<00:06:00.139> because<00:06:00.380> the<00:06:00.500> ctrl<00:06:00.860> key<00:06:00.889> is

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:01.190 
hacking key work because the ctrl key is

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:02.589 
hacking key work because the ctrl key is
in<00:06:01.310> the<00:06:01.400> same<00:06:01.580> position<00:06:02.000> that<00:06:02.030> it<00:06:02.210> would<00:06:02.360> be<00:06:02.479> on

00:06:02.589 --> 00:06:02.599 
in the same position that it would be on

00:06:02.599 --> 00:06:05.830 
in the same position that it would be on
UNIX<00:06:02.960> operating<00:06:03.740> systems<00:06:04.460> generally<00:06:05.090> which

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:05.840 
UNIX operating systems generally which

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:07.750 
UNIX operating systems generally which
is<00:06:05.960> right<00:06:06.139> here<00:06:06.169> and<00:06:06.560> you<00:06:06.620> end<00:06:07.160> up<00:06:07.250> getting

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:07.760 
is right here and you end up getting

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:11.909 
is right here and you end up getting
used<00:06:07.910> to<00:06:08.030> that<00:06:08.270> so<00:06:09.110> it's<00:06:09.349> kind<00:06:09.530> of<00:06:09.590> nice

00:06:11.909 --> 00:06:11.919 

00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:14.290 

they're<00:06:12.919> both<00:06:13.039> great<00:06:13.250> keywords<00:06:13.729> and<00:06:14.030> you<00:06:14.180> know

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:14.300 
they're both great keywords and you know

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:15.850 
they're both great keywords and you know
they're<00:06:14.479> different<00:06:14.690> and<00:06:15.050> I<00:06:15.740> think

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:15.860 
they're different and I think

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:18.310 
they're different and I think
celebrating<00:06:16.700> the<00:06:16.820> differences<00:06:17.090> is<00:06:17.360> what's

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:18.320 
celebrating the differences is what's

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:20.140 
celebrating the differences is what's
really<00:06:18.470> fun<00:06:18.740> about<00:06:18.770> this<00:06:19.160> and<00:06:19.880> like<00:06:20.000> I<00:06:20.090> said
