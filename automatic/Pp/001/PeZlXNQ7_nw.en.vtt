that whether it's in commercial cards or
acquiring<00:01:00.970> and<00:01:01.970> I<00:01:02.089> would<00:01:02.239> say<00:01:02.390> the<00:01:02.510> third<00:01:02.720> big

00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:03.199 
acquiring and I would say the third big

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:06.340 
acquiring and I would say the third big
thing<00:01:03.470> is<00:01:03.710> really<00:01:03.920> around<00:01:04.309> data<00:01:04.930> and<00:01:05.930> moving

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
thing is really around data and moving

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.560 
thing is really around data and moving
data<00:01:06.500> from<00:01:06.950> being<00:01:07.130> a<00:01:07.340> basic<00:01:07.729> hygiene<00:01:07.909> factor

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:08.570 
data from being a basic hygiene factor

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.469 
data from being a basic hygiene factor
to<00:01:09.170> really<00:01:09.409> starting<00:01:09.710> to<00:01:09.920> drive<00:01:10.430> insights<00:01:11.150> and

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479

okay<00:01:14.090> let's<00:01:14.299> start<00:01:14.510> with<00:01:14.600> the<00:01:14.720> regulation

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290 
okay let's start with the regulation

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:16.810 
okay let's start with the regulation
because<00:01:15.680> obviously<00:01:16.010> that's<00:01:16.280> been<00:01:16.430> the<00:01:16.520> bettin

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
because obviously that's been the bettin

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.609 
because obviously that's been the bettin
waar<00:01:17.030> of<00:01:17.240> bankers<00:01:17.630> now<00:01:17.810> for<00:01:18.020> the<00:01:18.080> last<00:01:18.200> four<00:01:18.500> or

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:18.619 
waar of bankers now for the last four or

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:20.800 
waar of bankers now for the last four or
five<00:01:18.650> years<00:01:19.000> we<00:01:20.000> know<00:01:20.119> all<00:01:20.240> about<00:01:20.270> puzzle

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
five years we know all about puzzle

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:22.990 
five years we know all about puzzle
three<00:01:21.080> but<00:01:21.259> how<00:01:21.530> does<00:01:21.590> it<00:01:21.680> affect<00:01:22.040> the<00:01:22.220> cards

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:23.000 
three but how does it affect the cards

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.880 
three but how does it affect the cards
business<00:01:23.180> so<00:01:24.110> I<00:01:24.140> would<00:01:24.350> say<00:01:24.439> when<00:01:24.590> I<00:01:24.619> look<00:01:24.770> at

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
business so I would say when I look at

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:26.710 
business so I would say when I look at
regulation<00:01:25.310> it's<00:01:25.850> probably<00:01:26.240> fair<00:01:26.479> to<00:01:26.540> say

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
regulation it's probably fair to say

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.330 
regulation it's probably fair to say
that<00:01:26.900> it's<00:01:27.290> been<00:01:27.470> more<00:01:27.620> focused<00:01:27.830> on<00:01:28.220> the

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
that it's been more focused on the

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:29.830 
that it's been more focused on the
acquiring<00:01:28.640> side<00:01:29.030> than<00:01:29.300> it<00:01:29.330> has<00:01:29.540> on<00:01:29.720> the

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
acquiring side than it has on the

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.450 
acquiring side than it has on the
commercial<00:01:30.020> cards<00:01:30.500> or<00:01:30.620> there<00:01:30.860> is<00:01:30.950> there<00:01:31.310> are<00:01:31.430> a

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460 
commercial cards or there is there are a

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:32.920 
commercial cards or there is there are a
few<00:01:31.640> things<00:01:31.790> still<00:01:32.030> to<00:01:32.150> be<00:01:32.210> clarified<00:01:32.390> in

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930 
few things still to be clarified in

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.050 
few things still to be clarified in
commercial<00:01:33.350> cards<00:01:33.650> but<00:01:34.460> with<00:01:34.580> in<00:01:34.700> acquiring

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
commercial cards but with in acquiring

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.210 
commercial cards but with in acquiring
we've<00:01:35.750> probably<00:01:35.930> seen<00:01:36.140> more<00:01:36.320> regulation<00:01:37.010> in

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.220 
we've probably seen more regulation in

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:38.680 
we've probably seen more regulation in
the<00:01:37.370> last<00:01:37.580> six<00:01:37.850> months<00:01:37.940> and<00:01:38.270> we've<00:01:38.390> seen<00:01:38.570> in

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
the last 20 years there's a huge focus

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.620 
the last 20 years there's a huge focus
at<00:01:41.420> this<00:01:41.540> point<00:01:41.810> in<00:01:41.990> time<00:01:42.290> around<00:01:42.770> interchange

March we saw visa debit repricing for

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.200 
March we saw visa debit repricing for
our<00:02:02.720> merchants<00:02:03.170> to<00:02:04.010> basically<00:02:04.490> again<00:02:04.790> respond

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210 
our merchants to basically again respond

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:06.910 
our merchants to basically again respond
to<00:02:05.330> EU<00:02:05.630> regulatory<00:02:05.990> requirements<00:02:06.799> and

to EU regulatory requirements and

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.070 
to EU regulatory requirements and
through<00:02:07.549> the<00:02:07.670> end<00:02:07.820> of<00:02:07.970> this<00:02:08.119> year<00:02:08.420> we<00:02:08.690> will<00:02:08.840> see

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
through the end of this year we will see

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.140 
through the end of this year we will see
implementation<00:02:10.009> of<00:02:10.159> an<00:02:10.280> EU<00:02:10.489> regulation<00:02:11.030> in

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
implementation of an EU regulation in

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
implementation of an EU regulation in
the<00:02:11.269> UK<00:02:11.830> around<00:02:12.830> again<00:02:13.549> interchange<00:02:14.239> what<00:02:15.049> is

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
the UK around again interchange what is

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:16.660 
the UK around again interchange what is
the<00:02:15.319> purpose<00:02:15.500> of<00:02:15.830> all<00:02:15.980> of<00:02:16.159> this<00:02:16.250> I<00:02:16.489> guess

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
the purpose of all of this I guess

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.430 
the purpose of all of this I guess
that's<00:02:16.879> the<00:02:17.000> key<00:02:17.239> the<00:02:17.540> purpose<00:02:17.900> of<00:02:18.019> this<00:02:18.080> is

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
that's the key the purpose of this is

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.160 
that's the key the purpose of this is
really<00:02:18.680> to<00:02:19.129> ensure<00:02:20.000> that<00:02:20.180> for<00:02:20.420> the<00:02:20.480> consumer

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
really to ensure that for the consumer

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.500 
really to ensure that for the consumer
that<00:02:22.010> that<00:02:22.190> really<00:02:22.519> does<00:02:22.730> start<00:02:23.060> to<00:02:23.180> drive

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
that that really does start to drive

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:24.970 
that that really does start to drive
down<00:02:23.720> the<00:02:23.840> cost<00:02:24.080> so<00:02:24.290> it<00:02:24.349> drives<00:02:24.530> down<00:02:24.680> the<00:02:24.830> cost

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
down the cost so it drives down the cost

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.440 
down the cost so it drives down the cost
first<00:02:25.250> of<00:02:25.370> all<00:02:25.489> for<00:02:25.670> merchants<00:02:26.060> and<00:02:26.269> then

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
first of all for merchants and then

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.750 
first of all for merchants and then
ultimately<00:02:26.690> for<00:02:27.470> the<00:02:27.500> consumer<00:02:28.040> okay<00:02:28.670> but

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
ultimately for the consumer okay but

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.009 
ultimately for the consumer okay but
what<00:02:28.909> is<00:02:29.030> the<00:02:29.209> interesting<00:02:29.390> things<00:02:29.780> is

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:30.019 
what is the interesting things is

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:30.910 
what is the interesting things is
there's<00:02:30.379> kind<00:02:30.560> of<00:02:30.590> a<00:02:30.680> link<00:02:30.890> between

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
there's kind of a link between

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.470 
there's kind of a link between
regulation<00:02:31.670> and<00:02:31.760> innovation<00:02:32.180> isn't<00:02:32.269> there

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
regulation and innovation isn't there

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:33.849 
regulation and innovation isn't there
because<00:02:32.840> you<00:02:33.139> know<00:02:33.230> first<00:02:33.439> of<00:02:33.469> all<00:02:33.590> we<00:02:33.650> get<00:02:33.739> the

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:33.859 
because you know first of all we get the

00:02:33.859 --> 00:02:35.470 
because you know first of all we get the
regulation<00:02:34.370> everybody<00:02:34.730> complains<00:02:35.150> about<00:02:35.359> it

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
regulation everybody complains about it

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:36.700 
regulation everybody complains about it
says<00:02:35.779> this<00:02:35.900> can<00:02:36.019> make<00:02:36.109> our<00:02:36.319> life

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:36.710 
says this can make our life

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:40.030 
says this can make our life
and<00:02:37.070> then<00:02:37.610> somehow<00:02:38.360> I<00:02:38.870> think<00:02:38.960> banks<00:02:39.620> start<00:02:39.920> to

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
and then somehow I think banks start to

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.710 
and then somehow I think banks start to
realize<00:02:40.430> that<00:02:40.460> and<00:02:41.060> merchant<00:02:41.390> start<00:02:41.630> to

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
realize that and merchant start to

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.630 
realize that and merchant start to
realize<00:02:41.990> some<00:02:42.440> upside<00:02:42.800> to<00:02:42.950> this<00:02:43.070> because<00:02:43.460> you

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
realize some upside to this because you

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.700 
realize some upside to this because you
can<00:02:43.790> actually<00:02:44.000> you<00:02:44.540> know<00:02:44.660> drive<00:02:45.380> forward

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:45.710 
can actually you know drive forward

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:47.020 
can actually you know drive forward
innovation<00:02:46.400> with<00:02:46.550> it<00:02:46.700> and<00:02:46.850> you<00:02:46.910> mentioned

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
innovation with it and you mentioned

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.300 
innovation with it and you mentioned
innovation<00:02:47.630> is<00:02:47.720> a<00:02:47.750> big<00:02:48.020> thing<00:02:48.950> on<00:02:49.070> the<00:02:49.130> horizon

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
innovation is a big thing on the horizon

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.550 
innovation is a big thing on the horizon
now<00:02:49.790> I<00:02:50.000> mean<00:02:50.180> how's<00:02:50.300> regulation<00:02:50.900> driving<00:02:51.320> Paul

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
now I mean how's regulation driving Paul

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:52.870 
now I mean how's regulation driving Paul
with<00:02:51.770> the<00:02:51.800> innovation<00:02:52.340> and<00:02:52.370> what<00:02:52.550> are<00:02:52.640> the<00:02:52.700> key

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
with the innovation and what are the key

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.510 
with the innovation and what are the key
innovations<00:02:53.390> in<00:02:53.570> the<00:02:53.660> cards<00:02:53.960> area<00:02:54.290> I<00:02:54.860> think<00:02:55.160> as

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:55.520 
innovations in the cards area I think as

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.010 
innovations in the cards area I think as
we<00:02:55.700> look<00:02:55.730> at<00:02:56.060> the<00:02:56.120> innovation<00:02:56.660> there's<00:02:56.870> two

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:57.020 
we look at the innovation there's two

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.620 
we look at the innovation there's two
aspects<00:02:57.410> to<00:02:57.500> it<00:02:57.680> is<00:02:57.950> one<00:02:58.490> of<00:02:58.610> the<00:02:58.700> ways<00:02:58.880> in

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
aspects to it is one of the ways in

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:01.300 
aspects to it is one of the ways in
looking<00:03:00.170> at<00:03:00.290> how<00:03:00.470> we<00:03:00.530> implement<00:03:01.100> the

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
looking at how we implement the

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:02.770 
looking at how we implement the
regulation<00:03:01.880> with<00:03:02.060> our<00:03:02.240> merchants<00:03:02.690> on<00:03:02.750> the

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
regulation with our merchants on the

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.990 
regulation with our merchants on the
acquiring<00:03:03.140> side<00:03:03.530> we're<00:03:04.520> actually<00:03:04.640> looking<00:03:04.850> at

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
acquiring side we're actually looking at

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.110 
acquiring side we're actually looking at
how<00:03:05.150> we<00:03:05.300> innovate<00:03:05.510> the<00:03:06.050> client<00:03:06.350> experience

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
how we innovate the client experience

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.730 
how we innovate the client experience
because<00:03:08.120> we're<00:03:08.480> moving<00:03:08.780> away<00:03:08.900> from<00:03:09.080> some<00:03:09.710> of

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:09.740 
because we're moving away from some of

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:11.290 
because we're moving away from some of
the<00:03:09.920> pricing<00:03:10.400> approaches<00:03:10.850> that<00:03:10.970> we've<00:03:11.120> had<00:03:11.240> in

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:11.300 
the pricing approaches that we've had in

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:12.970 
the pricing approaches that we've had in
the<00:03:11.540> past<00:03:11.570> and<00:03:12.080> we're<00:03:12.200> actually<00:03:12.350> looking<00:03:12.650> at

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
the past and we're actually looking at

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:14.800 
the past and we're actually looking at
how<00:03:13.610> we<00:03:13.670> make<00:03:13.910> things<00:03:14.120> much<00:03:14.300> more<00:03:14.540> transparent

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
how we make things much more transparent

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.260 
how we make things much more transparent
say<00:03:15.530> i<00:03:15.740> would<00:03:16.400> say<00:03:16.580> in<00:03:16.670> implementing<00:03:17.180> that

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:17.270 
say i would say in implementing that

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:18.820 
say i would say in implementing that
regulation<00:03:17.840> a<00:03:17.870> lot<00:03:18.020> of<00:03:18.170> that<00:03:18.290> is<00:03:18.410> just<00:03:18.650> around

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:18.830 
regulation a lot of that is just around

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:20.710 
regulation a lot of that is just around
innovating<00:03:19.490> the<00:03:19.610> client<00:03:19.910> experience<00:03:20.240> and

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
innovating the client experience and

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.560 
innovating the client experience and
actually<00:03:21.470> responding<00:03:22.070> to<00:03:22.340> where<00:03:23.180> merchants

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:23.570 
actually responding to where merchants

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:26.800 
actually responding to where merchants
want<00:03:24.140> to<00:03:24.230> take<00:03:24.410> that<00:03:24.590> that<00:03:24.890> benefit<00:03:25.310> next<00:03:25.810> much

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
want to take that that benefit next much

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:28.840 
want to take that that benefit next much
more<00:03:27.140> around<00:03:27.470> innovation<00:03:27.770> particularly<00:03:28.550> in

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:28.850 
more around innovation particularly in

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:30.850 
more around innovation particularly in
both<00:03:29.060> businesses<00:03:29.660> is<00:03:29.930> really<00:03:30.350> starting<00:03:30.710> to

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:30.860 
both businesses is really starting to

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:33.490 
both businesses is really starting to

at<00:03:39.380> some<00:03:39.560> of<00:03:39.680> the<00:03:39.770> innovation<00:03:40.280> that's<00:03:40.400> taking

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:40.820 
at some of the innovation that's taking

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:43.240 
at some of the innovation that's taking
place<00:03:40.850> within<00:03:41.330> the<00:03:41.510> industry<00:03:41.800> if<00:03:42.800> we<00:03:42.980> look<00:03:43.130> at

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
place within the industry if we look at

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.430 
place within the industry if we look at
commercial<00:03:43.730> cards<00:03:44.120> and<00:03:44.390> there's<00:03:44.870> a<00:03:44.930> big<00:03:45.200> move

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.440 
commercial cards and there's a big move

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.370 
commercial cards and there's a big move
from<00:03:45.830> the<00:03:46.340> basic<00:03:46.970> plastic<00:03:47.210> card<00:03:47.750> towards

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:48.380 
from the basic plastic card towards

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:51.460 
from the basic plastic card towards
virtual<00:03:48.980> solutions<00:03:49.450> and<00:03:50.450> really<00:03:50.810> starting<00:03:51.260> to

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470 
virtual solutions and really starting to

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:53.380 
virtual solutions and really starting to
look<00:03:51.890> at<00:03:52.070> some<00:03:52.280> of<00:03:52.310> the<00:03:52.460> insights<00:03:52.850> that<00:03:53.030> brings

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:53.390 
look at some of the insights that brings

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:55.720 
look at some of the insights that brings
into<00:03:53.660> a<00:03:53.690> business<00:03:53.870> model<00:03:54.230> to<00:03:54.560> really<00:03:55.520> drive

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730 
into a business model to really drive

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:57.760 
into a business model to really drive
working<00:03:56.120> capital<00:03:56.360> and<00:03:56.840> to<00:03:57.320> really<00:03:57.470> drive

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:57.770 
working capital and to really drive

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:59.890 
working capital and to really drive
supplier<00:03:58.250> management<00:03:58.540> this<00:03:59.540> is<00:03:59.690> really

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
supplier management this is really

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:00.730 
supplier management this is really
interesting<00:04:00.050> because<00:04:00.290> you<00:04:00.500> don't<00:04:00.710> really

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:00.740 
interesting because you don't really

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:02.950 
interesting because you don't really
think<00:04:00.920> of<00:04:01.160> a<00:04:01.340> commercial<00:04:01.550> card<00:04:02.000> driving

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:02.960 
think of a commercial card driving

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:05.320 
think of a commercial card driving
working<00:04:03.380> capital<00:04:03.620> and<00:04:03.920> sort<00:04:04.490> of<00:04:04.550> you<00:04:05.270> know

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:05.330 
working capital and sort of you know

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:07.030 
working capital and sort of you know
buying<00:04:05.690> policies<00:04:06.440> but<00:04:06.680> clearly<00:04:06.920> you're

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 
buying policies but clearly you're

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:08.800 
buying policies but clearly you're
saying<00:04:07.250> it<00:04:07.310> does<00:04:07.460> have<00:04:07.610> that<00:04:07.700> potential<00:04:08.060> well

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:08.810 
saying it does have that potential well

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:10.450 
saying it does have that potential well
it's<00:04:09.260> really<00:04:09.470> interesting<00:04:09.830> actually<00:04:10.160> because

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:10.460 
it's really interesting actually because

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:12.760 
it's really interesting actually because
when<00:04:11.240> we<00:04:11.390> talk<00:04:11.630> to<00:04:11.810> a<00:04:11.840> lot<00:04:11.930> of<00:04:11.990> corporates<00:04:12.590> and

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:12.770 
when we talk to a lot of corporates and

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:14.950 
when we talk to a lot of corporates and
in<00:04:13.070> some<00:04:13.280> cases<00:04:13.490> it<00:04:13.730> can<00:04:13.850> even<00:04:14.000> be<00:04:14.150> large

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:14.960 
in some cases it can even be large

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:17.320 
in some cases it can even be large
corporates<00:04:15.440> and<00:04:15.590> also<00:04:15.860> FIS<00:04:16.280> as<00:04:16.489> well<00:04:16.670> because

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:17.330 
corporates and also FIS as well because

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:18.550 
corporates and also FIS as well because
we're<00:04:17.480> doing<00:04:17.630> a<00:04:17.660> lot<00:04:17.780> of<00:04:17.840> work<00:04:18.020> at<00:04:18.170> this<00:04:18.320> point

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.560 
we're doing a lot of work at this point

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.110 
we're doing a lot of work at this point
in<00:04:18.680> time<00:04:18.710> with<00:04:19.100> financial<00:04:19.400> institutions<00:04:19.700> in

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120 
in time with financial institutions in

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.570 
in time with financial institutions in
the<00:04:20.210> UK<00:04:20.540> I<00:04:20.750> think<00:04:21.380> a<00:04:21.440> lot<00:04:21.470> of<00:04:21.590> people<00:04:21.710> start<00:04:22.400> out

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
the UK I think a lot of people start out

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.850 
the UK I think a lot of people start out
from<00:04:22.940> it's<00:04:23.210> a<00:04:23.360> piece<00:04:23.540> of<00:04:23.570> plastic<00:04:24.170> and<00:04:24.410> what

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:24.860 
from it's a piece of plastic and what

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:26.470 
from it's a piece of plastic and what
I'm<00:04:24.950> going<00:04:24.980> to<00:04:25.190> use<00:04:25.340> it<00:04:25.520> for<00:04:25.700> is<00:04:25.730> my<00:04:26.060> travel<00:04:26.390> and

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:26.480 
I'm going to use it for is my travel and

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.050 
I'm going to use it for is my travel and
entertainment<00:04:26.600> and<00:04:27.410> actually<00:04:28.370> once<00:04:28.670> they<00:04:28.880> get

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:29.060 
entertainment and actually once they get

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.030 
entertainment and actually once they get
that<00:04:29.300> moment<00:04:29.630> of<00:04:30.020> truth<00:04:30.590> where<00:04:30.830> they<00:04:30.950> actually

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:31.040 
that moment of truth where they actually

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.770 
that moment of truth where they actually
realize<00:04:31.640> that<00:04:31.940> it's<00:04:32.090> something<00:04:32.330> that<00:04:32.600> can<00:04:32.750> be

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:32.780 
realize that it's something that can be

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.560 
realize that it's something that can be
absolutely<00:04:33.500> embedded<00:04:34.070> within<00:04:34.340> an<00:04:35.060> overall

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:35.570 
absolutely embedded within an overall

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:38.440 
absolutely embedded within an overall
purchasing<00:04:36.140> process<00:04:36.590> or<00:04:37.040> even<00:04:37.580> at<00:04:38.030> an<00:04:38.270> end

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:38.450 
purchasing process or even at an end

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:40.780 
purchasing process or even at an end
state<00:04:38.840> taken<00:04:39.230> into<00:04:39.470> procurement<00:04:40.040> process<00:04:40.580> and

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:40.790 
state taken into procurement process and

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:44.560 
state taken into procurement process and
really<00:04:41.260> use<00:04:42.260> to<00:04:42.680> enhance<00:04:43.580> a<00:04:44.090> supplier

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:44.570 
really use to enhance a supplier

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:47.110 
really use to enhance a supplier
management<00:04:44.750> process<00:04:45.620> then<00:04:46.550> they<00:04:46.730> really<00:04:47.000> do

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.120 
management process then they really do

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.850 
management process then they really do
start<00:04:47.390> to<00:04:47.540> see<00:04:47.690> the<00:04:47.840> benefits<00:04:48.320> of<00:04:48.470> what<00:04:48.650> it<00:04:48.740> can

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:48.860 
start to see the benefits of what it can

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:49.550 
start to see the benefits of what it can
do<00:04:49.040> for<00:04:49.070> their<00:04:49.340> work

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 
do for their work

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.530 
do for their work
capital<00:04:50.070> and<00:04:50.250> it's<00:04:50.700> not<00:04:50.850> only<00:04:51.090> for<00:04:51.240> working

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:51.540 
capital and it's not only for working

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:53.390 
capital and it's not only for working
capital<00:04:51.570> it's<00:04:52.290> also<00:04:52.530> for<00:04:52.800> a<00:04:52.860> data<00:04:53.100> management

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:53.400 
capital it's also for a data management

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.610 
capital it's also for a data management
so<00:04:53.940> the<00:04:54.060> insight<00:04:54.510> that<00:04:54.540> that<00:04:54.810> can<00:04:55.020> drive<00:04:55.260> in

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620 
so the insight that that can drive in

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:58.640 
so the insight that that can drive in
terms<00:04:55.860> of<00:04:56.100> you<00:04:56.880> know<00:04:56.910> we're<00:04:57.360> using<00:04:57.650> 25

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:58.650 
terms of you know we're using 25

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:00.590 
terms of you know we're using 25
Airlines<00:04:59.220> for<00:04:59.580> our<00:04:59.700> travel<00:05:00.060> when<00:05:00.210> actually

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:00.600 
Airlines for our travel when actually

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:01.909 
Airlines for our travel when actually
and<00:05:00.840> they're<00:05:00.930> all<00:05:01.020> going<00:05:01.200> to<00:05:01.350> one<00:05:01.500> destination

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:01.919 
and they're all going to one destination

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:03.980 
and they're all going to one destination
so<00:05:02.340> therefore<00:05:02.700> it<00:05:02.820> there's<00:05:03.270> an<00:05:03.660> ability<00:05:03.810> to

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:03.990 
so therefore it there's an ability to

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:06.440 
so therefore it there's an ability to
rationalize<00:05:04.260> it<00:05:04.860> can<00:05:05.280> also<00:05:05.430> drive<00:05:05.730> fraud

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:06.450 
rationalize it can also drive fraud

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:08.960 
rationalize it can also drive fraud
management<00:05:06.780> as<00:05:07.290> well<00:05:07.490> but<00:05:08.490> much<00:05:08.700> more

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:08.970 
management as well but much more

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:10.940 
management as well but much more
importantly<00:05:09.600> it's<00:05:09.960> really<00:05:10.320> starting<00:05:10.500> to<00:05:10.680> move

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:10.950 
importantly it's really starting to move

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:13.010 
importantly it's really starting to move
night<00:05:11.190> into<00:05:11.490> much<00:05:11.639> more<00:05:11.669> predictive<00:05:12.450> analysis

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:13.020 
night into much more predictive analysis

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:15.290 
night into much more predictive analysis
so<00:05:13.680> actually<00:05:14.160> if<00:05:14.370> we're<00:05:14.760> starting<00:05:15.120> to<00:05:15.270> see

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.300 
so actually if we're starting to see

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.390 
so actually if we're starting to see
that<00:05:15.720> our<00:05:16.050> employees<00:05:16.260> are<00:05:16.800> doing<00:05:17.010> this<00:05:17.160> for

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:17.400 
that our employees are doing this for

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.850 
that our employees are doing this for
example<00:05:17.610> you<00:05:18.060> know<00:05:18.180> 25<00:05:18.660> days<00:05:18.960> a<00:05:19.110> year<00:05:19.139> how

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:19.860 
example you know 25 days a year how

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:21.770 
example you know 25 days a year how
might<00:05:20.160> we<00:05:20.250> expect<00:05:20.370> that<00:05:20.730> behavior<00:05:21.300> to<00:05:21.480> evolve

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:21.780 
might we expect that behavior to evolve

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.290 
might we expect that behavior to evolve
over<00:05:21.930> the<00:05:22.080> next<00:05:22.380> two<00:05:22.500> years<00:05:22.580> okay<00:05:23.580> now<00:05:23.970> you

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:24.300 
over the next two years okay now you

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:25.850 
over the next two years okay now you
touched<00:05:24.750> on<00:05:24.930> the<00:05:25.020> data<00:05:25.200> management<00:05:25.560> there<00:05:25.830> i

i'll start off with the acquiring
because<00:05:39.510> because<00:05:39.960> the<00:05:40.110> whole<00:05:40.290> data

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:40.680 
because because the whole data

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.620 
because because the whole data
conversation<00:05:41.520> has<00:05:41.669> evolved<00:05:42.060> tremendously<00:05:42.150> in

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:42.630 
conversation has evolved tremendously in

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:44.750 
conversation has evolved tremendously in
the<00:05:42.660> last<00:05:42.720> couple<00:05:43.050> of<00:05:43.200> years<00:05:43.340> and<00:05:44.340> in<00:05:44.550> some

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:44.760 
the last couple of years and in some

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:46.760 
the last couple of years and in some
cases<00:05:44.970> it's<00:05:45.270> quite<00:05:45.600> frightening<00:05:46.110> actually

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:46.770 
cases it's quite frightening actually

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:48.530 
cases it's quite frightening actually
what<00:05:47.130> can<00:05:47.280> be<00:05:47.400> done<00:05:47.520> with<00:05:47.580> data<00:05:47.910> but<00:05:48.270> i<00:05:48.300> think

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:48.540 
what can be done with data but i think

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:51.140 
what can be done with data but i think
it's<00:05:48.690> also<00:05:48.750> very<00:05:49.020> rewarding<00:05:49.400> so<00:05:50.400> so<00:05:50.700> let<00:05:51.060> me

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:51.150 
it's also very rewarding so so let me
