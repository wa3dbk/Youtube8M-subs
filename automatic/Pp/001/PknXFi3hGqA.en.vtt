00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:44.150

 wheels of our train 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.320
 I believe we already have a few and now 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:00.799
 with the mold bread we have to do the 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:03.540
 shape of the wagons and the locomotive if 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:06.480
 we remove a small square 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.759
 we already have our locomotive and if 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:10.890

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.620
 now we put the wheels that we have 

00:02:33.439 --> 00:02:35.620
 chopped up 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:42.080

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.940

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:10.189
 be the merchandise of our train 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:12.379
 and we're also going to use the cheese that 

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:14.210
 Panda likes it a lot if we cut it in 

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:17.000
 rectangles 

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:19.280

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.880
 transport gold in our train we load 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.880
