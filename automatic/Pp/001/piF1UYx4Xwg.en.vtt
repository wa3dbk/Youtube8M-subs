viable<00:00:46.960> trees<00:00:47.350> healthy<00:00:47.770> trees<00:00:48.220> removing

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:48.850

00:02:55.369 --> 00:02:55.379 
to understand that when trees come down

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:57.229 
to understand that when trees come down
that<00:02:55.860> they<00:02:55.950> do<00:02:56.010> have<00:02:56.250> value<00:02:56.459> in<00:02:56.760> the<00:02:56.849> city<00:02:57.060> and

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
that they do have value in the city and

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:58.850 
that they do have value in the city and
it's<00:02:57.329> sad<00:02:57.510> to<00:02:57.659> cut<00:02:57.840> them<00:02:57.959> up<00:02:58.049> for<00:02:58.200> firewood<00:02:58.650> I'd

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
also like to make the point that when we

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:01.850 
also like to make the point that when we
plant<00:03:00.659> trees<00:03:00.750> in<00:03:01.049> the<00:03:01.140> future<00:03:01.470> like<00:03:01.680> this

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860
