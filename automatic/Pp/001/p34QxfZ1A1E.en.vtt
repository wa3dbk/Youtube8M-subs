sea<00:01:54.460> so<00:01:54.700> I<00:01:54.940> would<00:01:55.479> say<00:01:55.660> stick<00:01:56.140> to<00:01:56.320> the<00:01:56.470> Celtic

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
sea so I would say stick to the Celtic

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.499 
sea so I would say stick to the Celtic
sea<00:01:57.070> salt<00:01:57.100> that's<00:01:57.580> the<00:01:57.820> best<00:01:58.060> one<00:01:58.240> for

00:01:58.499 --> 00:01:58.509 
sea salt that's the best one for

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:02.160 
sea salt that's the best one for
cleansing<00:01:59.789> also<00:02:00.789> you<00:02:00.850> will<00:02:01.090> need<00:02:01.330> a<00:02:01.570> 1

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
cleansing also you will need a 1

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.130 
cleansing also you will need a 1
teaspoon<00:02:02.800> measuring<00:02:03.340> spoon<00:02:03.640> and<00:02:04.030> you<00:02:04.990> will

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 
teaspoon measuring spoon and you will

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.520 
teaspoon measuring spoon and you will
need<00:02:05.320> a<00:02:05.380> straw<00:02:05.979> such<00:02:06.640> as<00:02:06.850> this<00:02:07.060> one<00:02:07.360> the<00:02:08.110> reason

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
need a straw such as this one the reason

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.229 
need a straw such as this one the reason
why<00:02:08.679> you<00:02:08.739> would<00:02:09.039> need<00:02:09.190> a<00:02:09.250> straw<00:02:09.700> is<00:02:09.880> because

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:10.239 
why you would need a straw is because

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:12.090 
why you would need a straw is because
when<00:02:10.450> you<00:02:10.539> make<00:02:10.750> the<00:02:10.959> solution<00:02:11.350> it's<00:02:11.800> going<00:02:11.950> to

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
when you make the solution it's going to

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.699 
when you make the solution it's going to
be<00:02:12.190> quite<00:02:12.550> salty<00:02:13.000> it's<00:02:13.810> very<00:02:14.110> difficult<00:02:14.560> to

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
be quite salty it's very difficult to

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:17.280 
be quite salty it's very difficult to
difficult<00:02:15.280> to<00:02:15.550> drink<00:02:15.760> it<00:02:15.880> straight<00:02:16.000> up<00:02:16.209> so<00:02:16.959> by

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
difficult to drink it straight up so by

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:18.720 
difficult to drink it straight up so by
putting<00:02:17.590> a<00:02:17.769> straw<00:02:18.070> at<00:02:18.130> the<00:02:18.250> back<00:02:18.459> of<00:02:18.489> your

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
putting a straw at the back of your

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.000 
putting a straw at the back of your
throat<00:02:19.030> it<00:02:19.269> bypasses<00:02:19.810> all<00:02:20.170> of<00:02:20.410> the<00:02:20.530> sensitive

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
throat it bypasses all of the sensitive

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.550 
throat it bypasses all of the sensitive
spots<00:02:21.250> on<00:02:21.430> your<00:02:21.580> tongue<00:02:21.790> where<00:02:22.090> you<00:02:22.560> receptors

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
spots on your tongue where you receptors

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.800 
spots on your tongue where you receptors
are<00:02:23.860> so<00:02:24.280> you're<00:02:24.519> not<00:02:24.760> going<00:02:25.030> to<00:02:25.120> taste

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
are so you're not going to taste

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.990 
are so you're not going to taste
anything<00:02:26.650> and<00:02:26.890> it's<00:02:27.010> much<00:02:27.190> easier<00:02:27.549> to<00:02:27.610> swallow

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
anything and it's much easier to swallow

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.910 
anything and it's much easier to swallow
as<00:02:28.239> well<00:02:29.459> now<00:02:30.459> to<00:02:30.519> make<00:02:31.030> the<00:02:31.209> flash<00:02:31.420> itself

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
as well now to make the flash itself

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.710 
as well now to make the flash itself
we're<00:02:32.920> going<00:02:33.040> to<00:02:33.100> take<00:02:33.310> 2<00:02:33.700> teaspoons<00:02:34.239> of<00:02:34.420> the

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
we're going to take 2 teaspoons of the

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.229 
we're going to take 2 teaspoons of the
sea<00:02:34.930> salt<00:02:35.260> and<00:02:36.160> remember<00:02:36.580> that<00:02:36.730> should<00:02:36.910> be<00:02:37.000> 2

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 
sea salt and remember that should be 2

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:43.199 
sea salt and remember that should be 2
teaspoons<00:02:37.810> not<00:02:38.230> 2<00:02:38.500> tablespoons<00:02:40.650> and<00:02:41.940> you<00:02:42.940> want

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
teaspoons not 2 tablespoons and you want

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:46.170 
teaspoons not 2 tablespoons and you want
to<00:02:43.360> close<00:02:43.630> your<00:02:43.810> vessel<00:02:44.350> and<00:02:44.670> shake<00:02:45.670> it<00:02:45.700> really

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
to close your vessel and shake it really

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.220 
to close your vessel and shake it really
well<00:02:46.950> make<00:02:47.950> sure<00:02:48.220> all<00:02:48.670> of<00:02:48.730> the<00:02:49.180> salt<00:02:49.480> is<00:02:49.750> fully

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
well make sure all of the salt is fully

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.250 
well make sure all of the salt is fully
dissolved<00:02:50.890> before<00:02:51.579> you<00:02:51.730> drink<00:02:52.060> it<00:02:52.269> that<00:02:53.140> is

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
dissolved before you drink it that is

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.170 
dissolved before you drink it that is
the<00:02:53.410> reason<00:02:53.590> why<00:02:53.829> you<00:02:53.890> will<00:02:54.100> drink<00:02:54.370> lukewarm

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
the reason why you will drink lukewarm

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.150 
the reason why you will drink lukewarm
water<00:02:55.269> and<00:02:55.780> not<00:02:55.900> cold<00:02:56.170> water<00:02:56.320> because<00:02:56.890> cold

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
water and not cold water because cold

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:58.920 
water and not cold water because cold
water<00:02:57.400> would<00:02:57.579> take<00:02:57.820> much<00:02:58.030> longer<00:02:58.060> to<00:02:58.600> dissolve

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
water would take much longer to dissolve

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.640 
water would take much longer to dissolve
the<00:02:59.079> salt<00:02:59.320> and<00:02:59.620> also<00:03:00.579> cold<00:03:01.209> water<00:03:01.630> makes<00:03:02.140> it<00:03:02.470> it

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
the salt and also cold water makes it it

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.680 
the salt and also cold water makes it it
takes<00:03:02.829> longer<00:03:03.250> time<00:03:03.459> for<00:03:03.700> your<00:03:03.820> body<00:03:04.030> to<00:03:04.299> warm

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
takes longer time for your body to warm

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.930 
takes longer time for your body to warm
it<00:03:04.900> up<00:03:05.049> and<00:03:05.380> to<00:03:05.860> pass<00:03:06.070> to<00:03:06.310> your<00:03:06.459> system

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
it up and to pass to your system

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.120 
it up and to pass to your system
lukewarm<00:03:07.870> water<00:03:07.930> is<00:03:08.410> already<00:03:08.650> body

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130 
lukewarm water is already body

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.340 
lukewarm water is already body
temperatures<00:03:09.850> it's<00:03:10.090> much<00:03:10.299> easier<00:03:10.750> to<00:03:10.810> release

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
temperatures it's much easier to release

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.199 
temperatures it's much easier to release
and<00:03:12.010> it<00:03:12.130> doesn't<00:03:12.400> require<00:03:12.519> any<00:03:12.670> extra<00:03:13.030> energy

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209 
and it doesn't require any extra energy

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:16.110 
and it doesn't require any extra energy
for<00:03:13.450> your<00:03:13.600> body<00:03:13.750> to<00:03:13.989> warm<00:03:14.079> it<00:03:14.290> up<00:03:14.850> alright<00:03:15.850> so

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
for your body to warm it up alright so

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.949 
for your body to warm it up alright so
the<00:03:16.239> salt<00:03:16.450> water<00:03:16.660> flash<00:03:16.930> is<00:03:17.140> ready<00:03:18.900> so<00:03:19.900> you

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
the salt water flash is ready so you

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:22.619 
the salt water flash is ready so you
would<00:03:20.410> stick<00:03:20.739> the<00:03:20.920> straw<00:03:21.250> inside

00:03:22.619 --> 00:03:22.629 
would stick the straw inside

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:25.199 
would stick the straw inside
and<00:03:22.810> as<00:03:23.379> I<00:03:23.530> explained<00:03:23.950> put<00:03:24.579> it<00:03:24.700> all<00:03:24.849> the<00:03:25.060> way

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:25.209 
and as I explained put it all the way

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:27.360 
and as I explained put it all the way

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.510 
author of the Master Cleanse he says
that<00:04:25.210> the<00:04:25.480> ratio<00:04:25.750> of<00:04:26.080> water<00:04:26.500> to<00:04:26.800> salt<00:04:27.040> is<00:04:27.250> such

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 
that the ratio of water to salt is such

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.640 
that the ratio of water to salt is such
that<00:04:27.820> it<00:04:27.970> does<00:04:28.270> not<00:04:28.300> get<00:04:28.810> absorbed<00:04:29.380> by<00:04:29.470> your

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
blood so it passes right through your

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:37.080
