okay so today what I want to do is show
you<00:00:01.469> guys<00:00:01.589> how<00:00:01.860> to<00:00:01.890> relationship-type<00:00:02.429> cars

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:02.909 
you guys how to relationship-type cars

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:04.849 
you guys how to relationship-type cars
and<00:00:03.300> calves<00:00:04.020> are<00:00:04.230> really<00:00:04.259> important

00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:04.859 
and calves are really important

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:06.499 
and calves are really important
particularly<00:00:05.190> if<00:00:05.400> you<00:00:05.490> active<00:00:05.879> if<00:00:06.029> you<00:00:06.180> dance

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509 
particularly if you active if you dance

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.350 
particularly if you active if you dance
if<00:00:06.930> you<00:00:06.960> run<00:00:07.319> if<00:00:07.649> you're<00:00:07.770> an<00:00:07.950> athlete<00:00:08.400> because

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
if you run if you're an athlete because

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.440 
if you run if you're an athlete because
calf<00:00:10.110> length<00:00:10.320> translates<00:00:10.950> into<00:00:11.130> speed<00:00:11.580> and<00:00:11.880> if

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
calf length translates into speed and if

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.089 
calf length translates into speed and if
it's<00:00:12.719> not<00:00:12.870> right<00:00:13.170> then<00:00:13.530> you<00:00:13.650> can<00:00:13.679> have

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
it's not right then you can have

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.550 
it's not right then you can have
injuries<00:00:14.670> as<00:00:14.910> well<00:00:14.969> so<00:00:15.870> before<00:00:16.289> I<00:00:16.320> show<00:00:16.350> you

injuries as well so before I show you

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.080 
injuries as well so before I show you
how<00:00:16.650> to<00:00:16.710> release<00:00:17.070> it<00:00:17.279> it's<00:00:17.490> just<00:00:17.760> really

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
how to release it it's just really

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.269 
how to release it it's just really
important<00:00:18.660> to<00:00:18.750> be<00:00:18.930> aware<00:00:19.260> that<00:00:19.650> there<00:00:20.130> is<00:00:20.160> a

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
first okay so we're just going to have a

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.760 
first okay so we're just going to have a
look<00:00:42.180> at<00:00:42.300> a<00:00:42.360> little<00:00:42.780> bit<00:00:42.899> of<00:00:42.930> anatomy<00:00:43.230> first

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
look at a little bit of anatomy first

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.290 
look at a little bit of anatomy first
and<00:00:44.670> we're<00:00:44.789> going<00:00:44.910> to<00:00:44.969> have<00:00:45.059> a<00:00:45.090> look<00:00:45.210> at

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
and we're going to have a look at

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.810 
and we're going to have a look at
Angie's<00:00:45.629> car<00:00:45.809> so<00:00:46.260> so<00:00:46.710> basically<00:00:47.160> you've<00:00:47.640> got

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
Angie's car so so basically you've got

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.520 
Angie's car so so basically you've got
two<00:00:48.090> layers<00:00:48.300> of<00:00:48.450> muscle<00:00:48.930> you've<00:00:49.110> got<00:00:49.320> your

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
two layers of muscle you've got your

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.110 
two layers of muscle you've got your
outside<00:00:49.980> layer<00:00:50.250> which<00:00:50.489> is<00:00:50.520> a<00:00:50.670> gastrocnemius

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
outside layer which is a gastrocnemius

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.369 
outside layer which is a gastrocnemius
so<00:00:51.539> you<00:00:51.629> get<00:00:51.719> your<00:00:51.840> medial<00:00:52.199> head<00:00:52.320> of

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
so you get your medial head of

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.100 
so you get your medial head of
gastrocnemius<00:00:52.969> lateral<00:00:53.969> head<00:00:54.180> and<00:00:54.329> then<00:00:54.809> deep

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
gastrocnemius lateral head and then deep

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.350 
gastrocnemius lateral head and then deep
-<00:00:55.320> that<00:00:55.469> is<00:00:55.649> sort<00:00:56.160> of<00:00:56.190> like<00:00:56.370> a<00:00:56.399> big<00:00:56.610> flat<00:00:56.940> muscle

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
- that is sort of like a big flat muscle

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.270 
- that is sort of like a big flat muscle
your<00:00:57.480> soleus<00:00:57.750> muscle<00:00:58.379> and<00:00:58.530> it<00:00:58.920> comes<00:00:59.129> right

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
your soleus muscle and it comes right

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.939 
your soleus muscle and it comes right
through<00:00:59.809> inserts<00:01:00.809> in<00:01:01.020> onto<00:01:01.230> your<00:01:01.350> Achilles<00:01:01.739> it

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
through inserts in onto your Achilles it

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.889 
through inserts in onto your Achilles it
doesn't<00:01:02.789> cross<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:02.940> knee<00:01:03.210> so<00:01:03.539> it's<00:01:03.660> just

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
doesn't cross the knee so it's just

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.580 
doesn't cross the knee so it's just
straight<00:01:04.350> in<00:01:04.589> through<00:01:04.890> there<00:01:05.100> so<00:01:05.869> with<00:01:06.869> range

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
straight in through there so with range

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.460 
straight in through there so with range
before<00:01:08.549> we<00:01:08.850> measure<00:01:09.150> it<00:01:09.390> what<00:01:09.960> happens<00:01:10.290> is

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
before we measure it what happens is

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.550 
before we measure it what happens is
when<00:01:10.860> you<00:01:10.979> take<00:01:11.189> a<00:01:11.250> step<00:01:11.460> so<00:01:11.939> when<00:01:12.119> you<00:01:12.240> run

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
when you take a step so when you run

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.050 
when you take a step so when you run
your<00:01:13.560> knee<00:01:13.770> will<00:01:13.950> come<00:01:14.100> across<00:01:14.400> like<00:01:14.670> that<00:01:14.909> so

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
your knee will come across like that so

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.999 
your knee will come across like that so
it's<00:01:15.180> called<00:01:15.360> dorsiflexion<00:01:16.020> if<00:01:16.290> you<00:01:16.799> don't

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
it's called dorsiflexion if you don't

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.219 
it's called dorsiflexion if you don't
have<00:01:17.340> that<00:01:17.580> range<00:01:17.880> so<00:01:18.060> if<00:01:18.210> you<00:01:18.270> calf<00:01:18.659> is<00:01:18.869> tight

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
have that range so if you calf is tight

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.899 
have that range so if you calf is tight
and<00:01:19.409> you're<00:01:19.530> locked<00:01:19.650> up<00:01:19.830> through<00:01:20.070> there<00:01:20.369> the

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
and you're locked up through there the

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.030 
and you're locked up through there the
body<00:01:21.210> will<00:01:21.509> cheat<00:01:21.900> and<00:01:22.200> instead<00:01:22.799> of<00:01:22.860> being

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
body will cheat and instead of being

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.580 
body will cheat and instead of being
able<00:01:23.130> to<00:01:23.220> come<00:01:23.430> over<00:01:23.460> that<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.750> foot<00:01:25.080> will

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
able to come over that the foot will

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.190 
able to come over that the foot will
roll<00:01:25.860> in<00:01:26.130> and<00:01:26.369> that<00:01:26.820> can<00:01:26.939> cause<00:01:27.200> ankle

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
roll in and that can cause ankle

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.069 
roll in and that can cause ankle
injuries<00:01:28.530> knee<00:01:29.189> injuries<00:01:29.790> hip<00:01:30.360> injuries<00:01:30.840> and

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
injuries knee injuries hip injuries and

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.399 
injuries knee injuries hip injuries and
the<00:01:31.500> list<00:01:31.710> goes<00:01:31.950> on<00:01:31.979> so<00:01:33.020> what<00:01:34.020> we'll<00:01:34.200> do<00:01:34.290> is

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
the list goes on so what we'll do is

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.530 
the list goes on so what we'll do is
just<00:01:34.439> check<00:01:34.860> rage<00:01:35.130> so<00:01:35.520> I'm<00:01:35.939> going<00:01:36.090> to<00:01:36.210> sit<00:01:36.390> on

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
just check rage so I'm going to sit on

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.100 
just check rage so I'm going to sit on
nine<00:01:36.869> centimeters<00:01:37.640> and<00:01:38.640> his<00:01:39.180> foot<00:01:39.450> is<00:01:39.659> just

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
nine centimeters and his foot is just

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.649 
nine centimeters and his foot is just
about<00:01:40.710> to<00:01:40.920> lift<00:01:41.100> off<00:01:41.310> there<00:01:41.549> she's<00:01:42.240> got<00:01:42.420> a<00:01:42.450> knee

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
about to lift off there she's got a knee

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.359 
about to lift off there she's got a knee
-<00:01:42.810> also<00:01:43.259> we'll<00:01:43.409> just<00:01:43.590> see<00:01:43.740> if<00:01:43.860> we<00:01:43.979> can<00:01:44.100> increase

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
- also we'll just see if we can increase

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:50.960 
- also we'll just see if we can increase
that<00:01:44.729> range<00:01:45.360> so<00:01:49.159> got<00:01:50.159> a<00:01:50.189> little<00:01:50.399> foot<00:01:50.700> ease

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
that range so got a little foot ease

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.480 
that range so got a little foot ease
here<00:01:51.329> and<00:01:51.960> she's<00:01:52.680> just<00:01:52.770> going<00:01:52.950> to<00:01:53.040> warm<00:01:53.280> it<00:01:53.430> up

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
here and she's just going to warm it up

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.100 
here and she's just going to warm it up
first<00:01:53.790> so<00:01:54.090> she's<00:01:54.329> just<00:01:54.570> doing<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:54.840> back<00:01:54.990> of

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
first so she's just doing the back of

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.350 
first so she's just doing the back of
the<00:01:55.170> calf<00:01:55.380> she<00:01:56.250> might<00:01:56.430> just<00:01:56.610> do<00:01:56.759> a<00:01:56.790> few<00:01:57.090> runs

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
the calf she might just do a few runs

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.130 
the calf she might just do a few runs
through<00:01:57.600> here<00:01:57.869> and<00:01:59.180> this<00:02:00.180> is<00:02:00.299> pretty<00:02:00.600> Pleasant

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
through here and this is pretty Pleasant

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.109 
through here and this is pretty Pleasant
not<00:02:01.619> to<00:02:01.770> uncomfy<00:02:02.250> at<00:02:02.310> all<00:02:02.460> she's<00:02:02.880> just

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
not to uncomfy at all she's just

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.810 
not to uncomfy at all she's just
controlling<00:02:03.630> her<00:02:03.810> weight<00:02:04.049> by<00:02:04.560> her<00:02:05.100> her<00:02:05.460> arms

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
controlling her weight by her her arms

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.589 
controlling her weight by her her arms
through<00:02:06.659> her<00:02:06.750> body<00:02:07.190> okay<00:02:08.190> now<00:02:09.000> what<00:02:09.390> she's

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
through her body okay now what she's

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.630 
through her body okay now what she's
going<00:02:09.780> to<00:02:09.840> do<00:02:10.050> is<00:02:10.319> we<00:02:10.410> want<00:02:10.530> to<00:02:10.590> pick<00:02:10.770> up<00:02:10.920> these

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
going to do is we want to pick up these

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.730 
going to do is we want to pick up these
little<00:02:11.700> media

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
little media

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:16.390 
little media
gastrocnemius<00:02:13.690> fibers<00:02:14.690> so<00:02:15.110> so<00:02:15.680> she<00:02:15.770> see<00:02:16.280> the

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
gastrocnemius fibers so so she see the

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.860 
gastrocnemius fibers so so she see the
little<00:02:16.610> hard<00:02:16.850> edge<00:02:17.180> that<00:02:17.420> we've<00:02:17.540> got<00:02:17.660> on<00:02:17.780> the

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
little hard edge that we've got on the

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.750 
little hard edge that we've got on the
footage<00:02:18.170> so<00:02:18.770> she's<00:02:18.950> using<00:02:19.190> that<00:02:19.340> through

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
footage so she's using that through

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.210 
footage so she's using that through
through<00:02:20.210> the<00:02:20.330> inside<00:02:20.630> here<00:02:20.990> and<00:02:21.200> she's<00:02:21.680> just

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
through the inside here and she's just

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.130 
through the inside here and she's just
turning<00:02:22.520> a<00:02:22.670> leg<00:02:22.850> in<00:02:23.090> and<00:02:23.480> she's<00:02:23.750> going<00:02:23.900> to<00:02:23.960> roll

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
turning a leg in and she's going to roll

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:25.570 
turning a leg in and she's going to roll
up<00:02:24.170> till<00:02:24.440> she<00:02:24.560> finds<00:02:24.830> a<00:02:24.890> little<00:02:25.070> trigger<00:02:25.340> point

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
up till she finds a little trigger point

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.660 
up till she finds a little trigger point
so<00:02:26.450> got<00:02:26.930> it<00:02:26.960> there<00:02:27.200> yep<00:02:27.950> so<00:02:28.400> she's<00:02:28.520> going<00:02:28.610> to

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
so got it there yep so she's going to

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.970 
so got it there yep so she's going to
sit<00:02:28.910> on<00:02:29.030> that<00:02:29.120> little<00:02:29.450> trigger<00:02:29.780> point<00:02:30.050> for

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
sit on that little trigger point for

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.500 
sit on that little trigger point for
about<00:02:31.280> 20<00:02:32.030> seconds<00:02:32.360> or<00:02:32.540> so<00:02:32.690> and<00:02:32.870> then<00:02:33.350> slide<00:02:33.830> up

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
about 20 seconds or so and then slide up

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.350 
about 20 seconds or so and then slide up
usually<00:02:35.510> about<00:02:35.690> 7<00:02:36.620> 8<00:02:36.740> centimeters<00:02:37.280> get<00:02:38.270> the

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
usually about 7 8 centimeters get the

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.710 
usually about 7 8 centimeters get the
next<00:02:38.570> one<00:02:39.730> so<00:02:40.730> she's<00:02:40.910> sitting<00:02:41.150> on<00:02:41.330> this<00:02:41.450> spot

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
next one so she's sitting on this spot

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.510 
next one so she's sitting on this spot
so<00:02:41.900> this<00:02:42.020> is<00:02:42.170> like<00:02:42.320> a<00:02:42.350> trigger<00:02:42.740> point<00:02:43.070> style<00:02:43.340> of

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:43.520 
so this is like a trigger point style of

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:48.040 
so this is like a trigger point style of
release<00:02:44.740> through<00:02:45.740> the<00:02:45.860> calf<00:02:46.690> up<00:02:47.690> through

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.050 
release through the calf up through

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:51.280 
release through the calf up through
there<00:02:48.320> so<00:02:48.680> she's<00:02:48.920> on<00:02:49.100> that<00:02:49.870> so<00:02:50.870> you'll<00:02:51.020> know

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
there so she's on that so you'll know

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:52.390 
there so she's on that so you'll know
when<00:02:51.470> you're<00:02:51.590> on<00:02:51.650> a<00:02:51.710> trigger<00:02:52.010> point<00:02:52.220> it's<00:02:52.340> like

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
when you're on a trigger point it's like

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.280 
when you're on a trigger point it's like
a<00:02:52.460> pleasure<00:02:52.760> pain<00:02:53.060> type<00:02:53.420> of<00:02:53.600> feeling<00:02:53.840> and<00:02:54.020> then

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
a pleasure pain type of feeling and then

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.560 
a pleasure pain type of feeling and then
she<00:02:54.440> might<00:02:54.590> do<00:02:54.770> one<00:02:54.980> more<00:02:55.250> so<00:02:56.120> she's<00:02:56.330> sliding

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:56.570 
she might do one more so she's sliding

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:59.880 
she might do one more so she's sliding
up<00:02:56.810> she's<00:02:57.080> got<00:02:57.260> that<00:02:57.410> spot<00:02:57.830> there<00:02:58.390> ok<00:02:59.390> so

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
up she's got that spot there ok so

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.920 
up she's got that spot there ok so
that's<00:03:00.890> one<00:03:01.280> way<00:03:01.580> of<00:03:01.610> releasing<00:03:02.300> those<00:03:02.390> fibers

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
that's one way of releasing those fibers

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.260 
that's one way of releasing those fibers
and<00:03:03.080> then<00:03:03.260> you<00:03:03.470> should<00:03:03.920> also<00:03:04.160> start<00:03:05.000> to<00:03:05.150> use

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:05.270 
and then you should also start to use

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:07.570 
and then you should also start to use
almost<00:03:05.660> like<00:03:05.840> a<00:03:05.870> connective<00:03:06.350> tissue<00:03:06.560> style<00:03:06.980> so

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:07.580 
almost like a connective tissue style so

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.460 
almost like a connective tissue style so
same<00:03:07.820> thing<00:03:07.850> she's<00:03:08.480> controlling<00:03:08.870> her<00:03:09.230> weight

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
same thing she's controlling her weight

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:11.920 
same thing she's controlling her weight
through<00:03:10.070> a<00:03:10.100> body<00:03:10.340> and<00:03:10.640> she's<00:03:11.210> using<00:03:11.450> slow

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
through a body and she's using slow

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:16.180 
through a body and she's using slow
pressure<00:03:12.550> and<00:03:14.350> she's<00:03:15.350> going<00:03:15.620> very<00:03:15.920> slightly

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
pressure and she's going very slightly

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.100 
pressure and she's going very slightly
through<00:03:16.400> that<00:03:16.550> movement<00:03:16.970> as<00:03:17.090> well<00:03:17.360> so

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110 
through that movement as well so

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:19.450 
through that movement as well so
remember<00:03:18.440> when<00:03:18.890> you're<00:03:19.010> targeting

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:19.460 
remember when you're targeting

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:20.710 
remember when you're targeting
connective<00:03:20.090> tissue<00:03:20.270> when<00:03:20.480> you're<00:03:20.600> targeting

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
connective tissue when you're targeting

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.510 
connective tissue when you're targeting
fascia<00:03:21.320> which<00:03:21.620> is<00:03:21.770> like<00:03:21.950> the<00:03:22.070> glad<00:03:22.340> wrap

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:22.520 
fascia which is like the glad wrap

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:25.360 
fascia which is like the glad wrap
around<00:03:22.940> your<00:03:23.060> muscle<00:03:23.830> lengthening<00:03:24.830> that<00:03:25.010> type

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
around your muscle lengthening that type

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:27.100 
around your muscle lengthening that type
of<00:03:25.550> tissue<00:03:25.730> is<00:03:26.060> a<00:03:26.090> function<00:03:26.540> of<00:03:26.660> pressure<00:03:26.870> and

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:27.110 
of tissue is a function of pressure and

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:30.340 
of tissue is a function of pressure and
time<00:03:28.060> okay<00:03:29.060> so<00:03:29.090> she's<00:03:29.450> just<00:03:29.480> done<00:03:29.840> the<00:03:29.990> inside

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:30.350 
time okay so she's just done the inside

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:32.290 
time okay so she's just done the inside
now<00:03:30.560> she's<00:03:30.800> turning<00:03:31.430> so<00:03:31.580> she's<00:03:31.790> externally

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:32.300 
now she's turning so she's externally

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.870 
now she's turning so she's externally
rotating<00:03:32.840> that<00:03:33.440> here<00:03:33.830> she's<00:03:34.550> going<00:03:34.670> to<00:03:34.730> pick

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:34.880 
rotating that here she's going to pick

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.590 
rotating that here she's going to pick
up<00:03:35.030> the<00:03:35.180> outside<00:03:35.500> muscles<00:03:36.500> through<00:03:36.830> there<00:03:37.040> and

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:37.600 
up the outside muscles through there and

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:42.810 
up the outside muscles through there and
same<00:03:38.600> thing<00:03:38.870> very<00:03:39.140> slow<00:03:39.530> very<00:03:40.810> smooth

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:42.820 
same thing very slow very smooth

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:45.580 
same thing very slow very smooth
stopping<00:03:43.820> before<00:03:44.000> the<00:03:44.270> top<00:03:44.450> of<00:03:44.570> the<00:03:44.690> the<00:03:45.350> the

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
stopping before the top of the the the

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:48.280 
stopping before the top of the the the
knee<00:03:45.740> crease<00:03:46.010> and<00:03:46.390> again<00:03:47.390> she<00:03:47.570> can<00:03:47.690> often<00:03:47.930> feel

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
knee crease and again she can often feel

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:50.170 
knee crease and again she can often feel
those<00:03:48.620> little<00:03:48.860> trigger<00:03:49.250> points<00:03:49.640> as<00:03:49.820> she<00:03:50.000> goes

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:50.180 
those little trigger points as she goes

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.600 
those little trigger points as she goes
over<00:03:50.420> them<00:03:50.630> as<00:03:50.750> well<00:03:51.070> now<00:03:52.070> she's<00:03:52.250> going<00:03:52.400> to<00:03:52.460> do

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:52.610 
over them as well now she's going to do

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:56.890 
over them as well now she's going to do
the<00:03:52.640> back<00:03:54.430> so<00:03:55.430> she's<00:03:55.670> pretty<00:03:55.910> much<00:03:56.060> squared<00:03:56.660> to

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900 
the back so she's pretty much squared to

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.110 
the back so she's pretty much squared to
it<00:03:57.020> and<00:03:57.220> with<00:03:58.220> this<00:03:58.370> one<00:03:58.610> she's<00:03:58.940> probably

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
it and with this one she's probably

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:00.460 
it and with this one she's probably
going<00:03:59.330> to<00:03:59.390> need<00:03:59.480> a<00:03:59.540> little<00:03:59.840> bit<00:03:59.990> more<00:04:00.200> pressure

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.470 
going to need a little bit more pressure

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:03.010 
going to need a little bit more pressure
so<00:04:00.680> she's<00:04:01.160> again<00:04:02.000> controlling<00:04:02.630> it<00:04:02.720> through

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:03.020 
so she's again controlling it through

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:07.240 
so she's again controlling it through
through<00:04:03.920> her<00:04:04.100> arms<00:04:04.480> and<00:04:06.070> she's<00:04:07.070> actually

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.250 
through her arms and she's actually

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:09.610 
through her arms and she's actually
picking<00:04:07.640> up<00:04:07.820> the<00:04:08.000> deep<00:04:08.300> soleus<00:04:09.170> fibers

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:09.620 
picking up the deep soleus fibers

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.650 
picking up the deep soleus fibers
through<00:04:09.800> here<00:04:10.010> so<00:04:10.190> she's<00:04:10.430> she's<00:04:11.150> getting<00:04:11.510> the

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:11.660 
through here so she's she's getting the

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:14.230 
through here so she's she's getting the
the<00:04:11.900> deepest<00:04:12.440> layer<00:04:12.620> of<00:04:12.740> muscle<00:04:13.130> and<00:04:13.670> they<00:04:14.090> can

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:14.240 
the deepest layer of muscle and they can

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:17.380 
the deepest layer of muscle and they can
get<00:04:14.360> really<00:04:14.540> tight<00:04:15.230> as<00:04:15.440> well<00:04:15.980> so<00:04:16.760> she<00:04:16.820> can<00:04:17.270> do

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:17.390 
get really tight as well so she can do

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:19.270 
get really tight as well so she can do
both<00:04:17.570> she's<00:04:18.350> doing<00:04:18.560> that<00:04:18.680> connected<00:04:19.100> tissue

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 
both she's doing that connected tissue

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:22.540 
both she's doing that connected tissue
storm<00:04:19.910> she<00:04:20.450> can<00:04:20.750> target<00:04:21.590> the<00:04:21.890> trigger<00:04:22.130> points

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:22.550 
storm she can target the trigger points

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:23.180 
storm she can target the trigger points
and

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
and

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:29.030 
and
and<00:04:23.400> do<00:04:24.240> those<00:04:24.440> specifically<00:04:25.440> as<00:04:25.650> well<00:04:28.040> okay

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040 
and do those specifically as well okay

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:33.020 
and do those specifically as well okay
so<00:04:29.220> let's<00:04:29.700> see<00:04:31.340> what's<00:04:32.340> going<00:04:32.520> on<00:04:32.850> with<00:04:33.000> a

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 
so let's see what's going on with a

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:36.230 
so let's see what's going on with a
range<00:04:33.300> so<00:04:33.570> retest<00:04:34.760> so<00:04:35.760> I'm<00:04:35.820> going<00:04:35.970> to<00:04:36.030> sit<00:04:36.210> on

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
range so retest so I'm going to sit on

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:43.370 
range so retest so I'm going to sit on
drum<00:04:37.140> Troy<00:04:37.350> 12<00:04:39.920> and<00:04:40.920> this<00:04:41.280> is<00:04:41.490> neat<00:04:41.700> a<00:04:41.730> wall<00:04:42.350> yep

drum Troy 12 and this is neat a wall yep

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:46.520 
drum Troy 12 and this is neat a wall yep
and<00:04:43.560> she's<00:04:44.370> got<00:04:44.580> that<00:04:44.700> pretty<00:04:45.090> easily<00:04:45.390> so<00:04:45.810> very

and she's got that pretty easily so very

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:48.590 
and she's got that pretty easily so very
short<00:04:46.890> time<00:04:47.160> frame<00:04:47.490> we've<00:04:47.940> increased<00:04:48.360> that

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:48.600 
short time frame we've increased that

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:52.820 
short time frame we've increased that
that<00:04:49.290> range<00:04:49.620> to<00:04:50.340> to<00:04:50.820> literally<00:04:51.830> impressive

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:52.830 
that range to to literally impressive

that range to to literally impressive
way<00:04:52.950> three<00:04:53.400> centimeters<00:04:53.970> so<00:04:54.630> really

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:55.380 
way three centimeters so really
