00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:07.069
 As a swimming there are different 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.050
 types of different colors with drawings 

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:10.730
 et cetera but in principle what you have 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:13.160
 what to know is that a swimming cap 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:15.860
 normally the one we use is always 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.539
 the silicone vale there are others that are of 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:20.090
 a bad silicone that are plastic 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:21.980
 like plastic that are very uncomfortable and 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:25.340
 then you have now made some lycra and 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:27.440
 even a waterproof film and good 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:30.020
 then for competition there is a kind 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:31.610
 of hats that are kind of like 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.980
 helmet that does not wrinkle that is for 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:35.960
 minimize the resistance that 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.370
 I do not have besides they are much more expensive and 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:41.120
 well what many swimmers do is 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:42.890
 who put on the normal cap after 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:46.370
 house and then this hat let's say that 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.809
 minimizes resistance is worth the cap 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.969
 good silicone even if it looks like a 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:52.340
 foolishness to explain how it gets there 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:55.790
 many people who put on their hats with 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:57.710
 with the line is with the line so 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:59.300
 but so I do not know with the hat with the line 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.730
 that is around here the girl has to 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.710
 stay here 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:05.190
 in the middle you do not wear the cap 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:09.120
 silicone 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:12.300
 you put it that way, I'm going to repeat it 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:14.730
 you realize there are two ways to get 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:17.100
 the cap only with his hands put the 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:18.870
 hands here there will be and you put it here 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.150
 where I have broken I can put it like you 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:24.270
 want but you risk with the 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.920
 nail or doing it wrong so to break the 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.200
 cap is worth if I work joining like this 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.920
 opening then to prevent it from 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.439
 break the hat 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.689
 open here you try to have your forehead 

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:35.950
 the less dry there are people who do 

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:37.930
 hair I for example always do with the 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:41.110
 dry hair so that it does not repair the hat 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:43.010
 here supports the front and puts you 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:46.610
 hat here 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:49.100
 covering your ear with the line of 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:52.190
 hat here these hats that normally 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.900
 They give the crossings to swim or in some 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:57.290
 competition dead so they give them away 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:59.330
 a hat because they actually break 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:01.310
 are used for a single use for 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.930
 few uses because right away in terms of 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.910
 you see it is stretching a little 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.950
 hat is almost ready to break and 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:08.840
 they are also very comfortable pulling the 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.250
 hairs especially if you have long hair 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.990
 if it was a girl or if you have the first 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.860
 with a water boy but he has a 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:15.520
 heap here 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.870
 he's already pulling my hair and they're very 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:20.940
 uncomfortable are obviously worth 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:23.550
 many devices often give it away 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.380
 and this would be the lycra cap the hat 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.420
 of fabric that would be the easiest to put 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.430
 especially if we have long hair on 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.320
 more comfortable in case maybe we are in 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.230
 the spa relaxing or with whom 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:36.010
 we could also do it 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.010
 I ask him not 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.519
 but the best way to put the donkey 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:44.620
 is helping with a partner of someone 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:46.599
 that you while you take the cap from here and 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.760
 you stick it to your forehead 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:50.500
 catch here with two hands and help you 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.330
 put on the burj to put on the hat 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.819
 between people to make sure of 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:56.110
 that the cap does not break 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:59.160
 also that we have the other person who 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:59.160
 take from here with your hands 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:06.660
 it just gets here 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:15.640
 if you have long hair like for example 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:19.580
 happen with the cousin from behind and we ask 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:21.560
 that with one hand take from here and with the 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:23.690
 another one takes the queue say so 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.840
 palante with eta and with force but stuck 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:27.370
 front 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.569
 and it's going to bring everything the same as it is 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.569
 issue of attacking in public 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:38.310
 Well I usually do what I do for 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.700
 to swim is that I wear the cap 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:43.150
 swimming 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:44.410
 and the glasses on the outside here 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.420
 you know that the glasses have to be 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.739
 at the height of the crown when I 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:49.450
 shot for the pool or when I'm 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:51.010
 swimming a cruise like this if 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:53.410
 example I want to remove my glasses 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:54.730
 because the tips even by the bullet 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:56.650
 in a moment they wash with their tongues 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:59.019
 with the water out there and I like to have them 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:01.900
 out there a lot of people what it does is for 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:05.680
 the competitions you put first the 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:08.000
 glasses are left here and then at 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.400
 put on the hat 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.160
 it stays in the box as fixed and so 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.420
 uses if they stay as fixed not 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.010
 happens is that good here if you pull 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:17.209
 head and brothers this field colaba phase 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:18.560
 that can be good here 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:20.930
 it's true that you're not leaving but for example 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:23.060
 in crossing if at the most in addition to cognac if 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:24.350
 you want to remove the layer you can to 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:26.060
 it's better to break the rubber to me I do not like 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:27.470
 but in the like this and what people do is 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:29.000
 that if they give me a hat of these for the 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:30.590
 cruises 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.570
 these are malillos that pull the 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:34.130
 hair what it does is that it first gets 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:36.610
 his hat which is good for the hat 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:36.610
 silicone 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:40.300
 of which you can put the layer or 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.770
 get to the end of the whole puts them 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.600
 outside as I would for example but 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:45.730
 maybe you put the box and then 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:47.560
 over the hat that maybe for 

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:49.500
 regulation they ask you because it's all 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:52.120
 of the same color or because it is your category 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:53.710
 and he puts it on top so you have the 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:56.530
 comfort of the silicone cap below 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:58.480
 and is taking this out and good 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:00.340
 has the layer fixed and let's say that 

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:03.300
 many people go I would take it just the same 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:03.300
 that with the box on the outside
