League<00:00:09.120> of<00:00:09.269> Legends<00:00:09.750> I<00:00:10.010> I<00:00:11.010> say<00:00:11.429> this<00:00:11.639> with<00:00:11.820> a

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
League of Legends I I say this with a

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:13.690 
League of Legends I I say this with a
lot<00:00:12.090> of<00:00:12.120> experience<00:00:12.660> as<00:00:12.809> Evelyn<00:00:13.139> and

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:13.700 
lot of experience as Evelyn and

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.820 
lot of experience as Evelyn and
including<00:00:14.700> about<00:00:15.030> ten<00:00:15.360> games<00:00:15.660> of<00:00:16.080> her<00:00:16.289> after

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
including about ten games of her after

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.500 
including about ten games of her after
the<00:00:16.949> patch<00:00:17.160> so<00:00:17.190> I<00:00:17.640> mean<00:00:17.850> I'm<00:00:17.940> not<00:00:18.060> just<00:00:18.300> saying

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
the patch so I mean I'm not just saying

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.029 
the patch so I mean I'm not just saying
this<00:00:18.630> in<00:00:18.840> flaming<00:00:19.230> because<00:00:19.590> I<00:00:19.710> haven't<00:00:19.890> tried

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
this in flaming because I haven't tried

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.090 
this in flaming because I haven't tried
it<00:00:20.279> but<00:00:20.460> I<00:00:20.699> have<00:00:21.630> tried<00:00:21.840> it<00:00:22.050> and<00:00:22.260> it<00:00:22.529> just<00:00:22.560> does

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
it but I have tried it and it just does

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.580 
it but I have tried it and it just does
not<00:00:23.310> work<00:00:23.460> anymore

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:24.590 
not work anymore

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.620 
not work anymore
my<00:00:25.590> main<00:00:25.830> issue<00:00:26.070> is<00:00:26.430> yes<00:00:26.760> the<00:00:27.000> stun<00:00:27.240> is<00:00:27.359> gone

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
my main issue is yes the stun is gone

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.660 
my main issue is yes the stun is gone
but<00:00:28.109> if<00:00:28.320> that<00:00:28.529> was<00:00:28.619> the<00:00:28.740> only<00:00:28.859> change<00:00:29.310> I<00:00:29.460> think

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
but if that was the only change I think

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.099 
but if that was the only change I think
she<00:00:29.789> would<00:00:29.910> still<00:00:30.119> be<00:00:30.210> a<00:00:30.240> viable<00:00:30.480> character

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
she would still be a viable character

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.049 
she would still be a viable character
the<00:00:31.619> fact<00:00:31.859> that<00:00:31.949> her<00:00:32.189> heal<00:00:32.430> has<00:00:32.669> been<00:00:32.850> so

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
the fact that her heal has been so

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.209 
the fact that her heal has been so
severely<00:00:33.510> reduced<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:34.680> fact<00:00:34.950> that<00:00:35.040> her

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
severely reduced the fact that her

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:36.680 
severely reduced the fact that her
attack<00:00:35.520> speed<00:00:35.790> has<00:00:35.940> been<00:00:35.969> reduced

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
attack speed has been reduced

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.860 
attack speed has been reduced
one<00:00:37.620> old<00:00:37.860> thing<00:00:38.160> and<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:39.030> fact<00:00:39.270> that<00:00:39.420> like<00:00:39.660> you

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
one old thing and the fact that like you

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.229 
one old thing and the fact that like you
need<00:00:40.020> to<00:00:40.170> level<00:00:40.440> up<00:00:40.739> your<00:00:40.800> W<00:00:41.370> into<00:00:41.579> order<00:00:42.090> to

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
need to level up your W into order to

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.590 
need to level up your W into order to
make<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.600> stun<00:00:42.930> actually<00:00:43.440> viable<00:00:43.940> is<00:00:44.940> is<00:00:45.360> what

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
make the stun actually viable is is what

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.260 
make the stun actually viable is is what
completely<00:00:45.989> kills<00:00:46.110> her<00:00:46.469> as<00:00:46.649> a<00:00:46.680> character<00:00:47.270> so

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
completely kills her as a character so

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.959 
completely kills her as a character so
this<00:00:49.050> is<00:00:49.200> just<00:00:49.350> me<00:00:49.530> and<00:00:49.649> my<00:00:49.710> friend<00:00:50.039> playing

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
kind of the damage so at level three

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.279 
kind of the damage so at level three
this<00:00:54.210> is<00:00:54.329> what<00:00:54.480> I<00:00:54.510> generally<00:00:54.690> start<00:00:54.989> ganking

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
this is what I generally start ganking

know<00:01:05.549> how<00:01:05.700> honey<00:01:05.909> was<00:01:06.090> except<00:01:06.330> for<00:01:06.360> a<00:01:06.479> dorrance

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
know how honey was except for a dorrance

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.480 
know how honey was except for a dorrance
ring<00:01:07.080> which<00:01:07.260> is<00:01:07.290> pretty<00:01:07.740> typical<00:01:07.890> starting

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
ring which is pretty typical starting

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.609 
ring which is pretty typical starting
item<00:01:08.760> but<00:01:09.510> one<00:01:09.659> thing<00:01:09.869> that's<00:01:10.020> ridiculous

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
item but one thing that's ridiculous

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.320 
item but one thing that's ridiculous
though<00:01:10.830> is<00:01:11.040> she's<00:01:11.369> actually<00:01:11.520> the<00:01:11.760> same<00:01:11.970> level

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
though is she's actually the same level

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.609 
though is she's actually the same level
as<00:01:12.390> me<00:01:12.510> whereas<00:01:12.780> if<00:01:12.869> I<00:01:12.960> wasn't<00:01:13.200> made<00:01:13.350> as<00:01:13.470> Annie

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
as me whereas if I wasn't made as Annie

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.590 
as me whereas if I wasn't made as Annie
she<00:01:13.950> would<00:01:14.070> never<00:01:14.159> be<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.490> same<00:01:14.640> level<00:01:14.939> so<00:01:15.540> she

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
she would never be the same level so she

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.780 
she would never be the same level so she
gets<00:01:16.140> slow<00:01:16.380> but<00:01:16.799> I<00:01:16.950> could<00:01:17.100> just<00:01:17.280> start<00:01:17.490> her<00:01:17.640> and

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
gets slow but I could just start her and

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.760 
gets slow but I could just start her and
get<00:01:17.939> away<00:01:18.119> which<00:01:18.930> is<00:01:19.140> probably<00:01:19.530> one<00:01:19.680> of<00:01:19.710> the

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
get away which is probably one of the

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.890 
get away which is probably one of the
biggest<00:01:19.979> issues<00:01:20.159> because<00:01:21.090> a<00:01:21.390> lot<00:01:21.869> of

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
biggest issues because a lot of

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.230 
biggest issues because a lot of
characters<00:01:22.500> like<00:01:22.590> Taric<00:01:23.280> cho'gath<00:01:23.850> with<00:01:24.090> this

ApS<00:01:34.409> have<00:01:34.710> some<00:01:35.040> kind<00:01:35.340> of<00:01:35.430> a<00:01:35.630> defense

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
ApS have some kind of a defense

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.800 
ApS have some kind of a defense
mechanism<00:01:36.750> against<00:01:37.560> that<00:01:37.680> so<00:01:38.479> you<00:01:39.479> just<00:01:39.630> can't

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
mechanism against that so you just can't

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:06.540 
team but but once it's late game she's
just<00:02:04.810> useless<00:02:05.080> the<00:02:05.680> team<00:02:05.920> will<00:02:06.040> just<00:02:06.190> shut<00:02:06.400> her

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:06.550 
just useless the team will just shut her

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:08.460 
just useless the team will just shut her
down<00:02:06.760> so<00:02:07.210> hard<00:02:07.420> because<00:02:07.780> she<00:02:08.080> just

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
down so hard because she just

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.440 
down so hard because she just
if<00:02:08.860> she<00:02:09.070> can't<00:02:09.310> stun<00:02:09.640> they<00:02:09.940> can<00:02:10.119> pretty<00:02:10.360> much

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
if she can't stun they can pretty much

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.740 
if she can't stun they can pretty much
escape<00:02:10.929> every<00:02:11.230> time<00:02:11.790> and<00:02:12.790> it<00:02:13.030> just<00:02:13.060> it<00:02:13.540> sucks

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
escape every time and it just it sucks

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.840 
escape every time and it just it sucks
so<00:02:14.050> here<00:02:14.320> I<00:02:14.350> wanted<00:02:14.620> to<00:02:14.710> get<00:02:14.830> hit<00:02:14.980> again<00:02:15.010> in

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
so here I wanted to get hit again in

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:17.880 
so here I wanted to get hit again in
about<00:02:16.180> five<00:02:16.330> seconds<00:02:16.810> this<00:02:17.170> is<00:02:17.320> with<00:02:17.470> two<00:02:17.500> bars

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
about five seconds this is with two bars

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.190 
about five seconds this is with two bars
health<00:02:18.160> which<00:02:19.030> is<00:02:19.180> ridiculous<00:02:19.690> because<00:02:19.720> a<00:02:19.959> mid

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
health which is ridiculous because a mid

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.690 
health which is ridiculous because a mid
would<00:02:20.350> obviously<00:02:20.890> back<00:02:21.100> if<00:02:21.310> they<00:02:21.430> had<00:02:21.580> this

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
would obviously back if they had this

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:22.740 
would obviously back if they had this
little<00:02:21.970> health<00:02:22.150> and<00:02:22.300> there<00:02:22.390> was<00:02:22.480> a<00:02:22.510> net<00:02:22.660> boy

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
little health and there was a net boy

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:24.600 
little health and there was a net boy
but<00:02:23.380> look<00:02:23.500> at<00:02:23.590> this<00:02:23.650> I<00:02:23.770> can<00:02:23.800> just<00:02:24.010> flash<00:02:24.220> away<00:02:24.490> I

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
but look at this I can just flash away I

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
but look at this I can just flash away I
can<00:02:24.910> stun<00:02:25.150> her<00:02:25.240> I'm<00:02:25.360> fine

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.070 
ganking potential a little bit of lag

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.070 
ganking potential a little bit of lag
here<00:02:33.310> with<00:02:33.489> fraps<00:02:33.760> her<00:02:33.970> ganking<00:02:34.450> potential<00:02:34.810> is

not many people really took this into
account<00:03:17.700> is<00:03:17.940> the<00:03:18.090> fact<00:03:18.120> that<00:03:18.450> she<00:03:18.690> could<00:03:18.840> heal

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
account is the fact that she could heal

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.350 
account is the fact that she could heal
after<00:03:20.160> getting<00:03:20.400> a<00:03:20.460> kill<00:03:20.700> which<00:03:20.910> is<00:03:21.090> the<00:03:21.210> only

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
way she was sustainable in the team

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:24.650 
way she was sustainable in the team
fight<00:03:23.100> because<00:03:23.430> if<00:03:23.880> she<00:03:24.030> got<00:03:24.180> a<00:03:24.210> kill<00:03:24.450> or

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.330 
fight because if she got a kill or
desist<00:03:24.960> she<00:03:25.230> got<00:03:25.410> a<00:03:25.440> lot<00:03:25.800> of<00:03:25.860> health<00:03:26.100> back

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
desist she got a lot of health back

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.000 
desist she got a lot of health back
which<00:03:26.550> was<00:03:26.730> good<00:03:26.910> and<00:03:27.660> it<00:03:28.140> was<00:03:28.260> also<00:03:28.440> the<00:03:28.770> only

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
which was good and it was also the only

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.000 
which was good and it was also the only
way<00:03:29.310> she<00:03:29.640> was<00:03:29.760> really<00:03:30.150> viable<00:03:30.870> as<00:03:31.440> a<00:03:31.500> ganker

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
way she was really viable as a ganker
