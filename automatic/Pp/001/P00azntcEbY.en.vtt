00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
mushroom and it will look like a bit of

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.630 
mushroom and it will look like a bit of
a<00:02:27.550> skirt<00:02:27.850> the<00:02:28.840> the<00:02:29.440> prince<00:02:29.770> which<00:02:30.130> is<00:02:30.280> a<00:02:30.310> member

of this family has a very long skirt
this<00:02:33.010> one<00:02:33.280> which<00:02:33.520> I<00:02:33.790> now<00:02:34.480> believe<00:02:34.750> to<00:02:34.990> be<00:02:35.110> a

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
this one which I now believe to be a

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.060 
this one which I now believe to be a
horse<00:02:35.350> mushroom<00:02:35.920> based<00:02:36.190> on<00:02:36.430> the<00:02:36.550> smell<00:02:36.960> has<00:02:37.960> a

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
horse mushroom based on the smell has a

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.290 
horse mushroom based on the smell has a
reasonable<00:02:39.070> size<00:02:39.280> skirt<00:02:39.700> you<00:02:39.850> can<00:02:39.970> see<00:02:40.120> that's

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
reasonable size skirt you can see that's

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.570 
reasonable size skirt you can see that's
going<00:02:40.420> to<00:02:40.510> be<00:02:40.570> left<00:02:40.780> about<00:02:41.560> a<00:02:41.620> centimeter<00:02:42.280> or

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
going to be left about a centimeter or

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.530 
going to be left about a centimeter or
so<00:02:43.350> hanging<00:02:44.350> down<00:02:44.590> on<00:02:44.620> the<00:02:44.860> stem<00:02:45.180> if<00:02:46.180> I<00:02:46.270> cut

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
so hanging down on the stem if I cut

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.420 
so hanging down on the stem if I cut
through<00:02:46.840> it<00:02:47.020> this<00:02:47.200> is<00:02:47.350> a<00:02:47.380> young<00:02:47.680> specimen

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
through it this is a young specimen

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.280 
through it this is a young specimen
although<00:02:48.700> it<00:02:48.850> has<00:02:49.000> been<00:02:49.270> rather<00:02:49.960> maggot<00:02:50.500> eaten

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 
although it has been rather maggot eaten

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:57.590 
although it has been rather maggot eaten
you<00:02:53.290> can<00:02:53.440> see<00:02:53.650> here<00:02:54.750> it's<00:02:55.750> a<00:02:55.840> guild<00:02:56.110> mushroom

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
you can see here it's a guild mushroom

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:00.120 
you can see here it's a guild mushroom
got<00:02:58.600> some<00:02:58.780> sort<00:02:58.990> of<00:02:59.020> fly<00:02:59.290> in<00:02:59.500> there<00:02:59.710> and<00:02:59.890> the

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
got some sort of fly in there and the

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.580 
got some sort of fly in there and the
gills<00:03:00.310> are<00:03:00.460> pink<00:03:00.700> as<00:03:00.940> this<00:03:01.720> mushroom<00:03:01.960> matures

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
gills are pink as this mushroom matures

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.400 
gills are pink as this mushroom matures
the<00:03:03.220> gills<00:03:03.430> will<00:03:03.610> change<00:03:03.910> from<00:03:04.270> pink<00:03:04.600> to<00:03:04.960> brown

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
the gills will change from pink to brown

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.340 
the gills will change from pink to brown
to<00:03:05.950> really<00:03:06.430> dark<00:03:06.700> brown<00:03:07.060> almost<00:03:07.510> black<00:03:07.900> ish

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350 
to really dark brown almost black ish

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:12.510 
to really dark brown almost black ish
when<00:03:08.650> it's<00:03:08.800> really<00:03:09.160> dry<00:03:09.430> and<00:03:09.460> mature<00:03:10.320> so<00:03:11.520> those

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:12.520 
when it's really dry and mature so those

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.510 
when it's really dry and mature so those
few<00:03:12.910> things<00:03:13.240> tell<00:03:13.690> me<00:03:13.840> this<00:03:13.990> isn't<00:03:14.230> a<00:03:14.380> Garak<00:03:14.710> it

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:15.520 
few things tell me this isn't a Garak it

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.090 
few things tell me this isn't a Garak it
doesn't<00:03:15.880> come<00:03:16.060> from<00:03:16.090> a<00:03:16.660> sac<00:03:17.230> at<00:03:17.440> the<00:03:17.560> base<00:03:17.710> I

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
doesn't come from a sac at the base I

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.730 
doesn't come from a sac at the base I
didn't<00:03:18.760> show<00:03:18.940> you<00:03:18.970> that<00:03:19.120> but<00:03:19.510> I<00:03:19.750> should<00:03:20.020> really

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:20.740 
didn't show you that but I should really

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:22.800 
didn't show you that but I should really
if<00:03:21.700> we<00:03:21.790> look<00:03:21.820> at<00:03:22.000> the<00:03:22.090> base<00:03:22.300> of<00:03:22.540> the<00:03:22.630> mushroom

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
if we look at the base of the mushroom

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.340 
if we look at the base of the mushroom
where<00:03:23.560> I've<00:03:23.680> just<00:03:23.710> pulled<00:03:24.100> it<00:03:24.220> out<00:03:24.280> the<00:03:24.430> ground

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:25.350 
where I've just pulled it out the ground

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:29.640 
where I've just pulled it out the ground
there's<00:03:26.350> no<00:03:26.500> Vale<00:03:27.070> or<00:03:27.340> sac<00:03:27.790> around<00:03:28.690> the<00:03:29.230> base

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
there's no Vale or sac around the base

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:30.990 
there's no Vale or sac around the base
of<00:03:29.680> the<00:03:29.950> mushroom<00:03:30.100> and<00:03:30.460> that's<00:03:30.670> that's

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
of the mushroom and that's that's

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.460 
of the mushroom and that's that's
important<00:03:31.510> whenever<00:03:31.660> you're<00:03:31.930> out<00:03:32.020> mushroom

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
important whenever you're out mushroom

poisonous mushrooms in the country this

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:49.610 
poisonous mushrooms in the country this
we've<00:03:46.720> identified<00:03:46.900> as<00:03:47.590> in<00:03:47.710> a<00:03:47.770> Garak<00:03:48.240> it's<00:03:49.240> got

stem with a skirt and I can't really see
it<00:03:58.810> on<00:03:58.900> this<00:03:59.020> one<00:03:59.200> but<00:03:59.440> they<00:03:59.500> often<00:03:59.650> have

00:03:59.940 --> 00:03:59.950 
it on this one but they often have

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:00.960 
it on this one but they often have
what's<00:04:00.130> called<00:04:00.280> a<00:04:00.430> cogwheel

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:00.970 
what's called a cogwheel

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:04.230 
what's called a cogwheel
around<00:04:01.900> the<00:04:02.290> the<00:04:02.710> skirt<00:04:03.070> when<00:04:03.880> it's<00:04:04.030> still
