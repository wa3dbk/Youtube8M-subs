00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
propeller power for this project I'm

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.320 
propeller power for this project I'm
using<00:00:23.070> tiny<00:00:23.820> room<00:00:24.390> fire<00:00:24.660> 2400<00:00:25.650> KB<00:00:26.039> motor<00:00:26.340> in

the back there are two large rudders and
two<00:00:31.650> servos<00:00:32.099> hooked<00:00:32.759> up<00:00:33.770> all<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:35.100> electronics

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
two servos hooked up all the electronics

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.819 
two servos hooked up all the electronics
are<00:00:35.790> safely<00:00:36.390> contained<00:00:36.809> inside

00:00:39.819 --> 00:00:39.829 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:45.139 

marmo<00:00:40.829> is<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.790> spektrum<00:00:42.270> dx6i<00:00:43.879> it's<00:00:44.879> a<00:00:44.969> very

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
marmo is the spektrum dx6i it's a very

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.819 
marmo is the spektrum dx6i it's a very
natural<00:00:46.610> so<00:00:47.610> originally<00:00:48.300> I<00:00:48.539> planned<00:00:48.719> think<00:00:49.440> to

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
natural so originally I planned think to

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.450 
natural so originally I planned think to
go<00:00:49.980> on<00:00:50.039> snow<00:00:51.260> however<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.710> construction<00:00:52.980> came

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
go on snow however the construction came

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.760 
go on snow however the construction came
out<00:00:53.579> to<00:00:53.730> look<00:00:53.879> too<00:00:54.090> heavy<00:00:54.329> and<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:55.559> motor

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
out to look too heavy and the motor

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.490 
out to look too heavy and the motor
isn't<00:00:56.070> powerful<00:00:56.460> enough<00:00:56.870> so<00:00:57.870> I<00:00:57.930> couldn't<00:00:58.350> do

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
isn't powerful enough so I couldn't do

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.860 
isn't powerful enough so I couldn't do
that<00:00:58.680> however<00:00:59.430> it<00:00:59.760> does<00:00:59.969> gonna<00:01:00.329> ask<00:01:00.539> very

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
that however it does gonna ask very

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.560 
that however it does gonna ask very
nicely<00:01:01.579> so<00:01:02.579> let's<00:01:03.000> take<00:01:03.149> a<00:01:03.180> look<00:01:03.329> a<00:01:03.449> little

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
nicely so let's take a look a little

00:01:03.570 --> 00:03:55.250 
nicely so let's take a look a little
action
