foundations to the Christian faith we

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:17.679 
foundations to the Christian faith we
must<00:00:15.770> start<00:00:16.340> with<00:00:16.460> the<00:00:16.610> Scriptures<00:00:17.210> we<00:00:17.480> have

00:00:17.679 --> 00:00:17.689

to<00:00:17.840> start<00:00:18.140> with<00:00:18.320> the<00:00:18.860> source<00:00:19.189> of<00:00:19.460> our

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:19.550 
to start with the source of our

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.179 
to start with the source of our
revelation<00:00:20.300> and<00:00:20.570> one<00:00:21.500> of<00:00:21.590> the<00:00:21.650> most<00:00:21.740> important

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:22.189 
revelation and one of the most important

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:24.370 
revelation and one of the most important
questions<00:00:22.520> about<00:00:22.790> the<00:00:23.029> Scriptures<00:00:23.509> is<00:00:23.810> how<00:00:24.320> do

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:24.380 
questions about the Scriptures is how do

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.170 
questions about the Scriptures is how do
we<00:00:24.500> know<00:00:24.770> which<00:00:25.009> books<00:00:25.460> belong<00:00:25.910> in<00:00:26.090> the

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:26.180

we know which books belong in the
scriptures<00:00:26.689> and<00:00:27.080> I<00:00:27.560> think<00:00:27.770> that's<00:00:27.920> a<00:00:28.039> question

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:28.189 
scriptures and I think that's a question

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:31.090 
scriptures and I think that's a question
that<00:00:28.520> a<00:00:28.550> lot<00:00:28.609> of<00:00:28.820> us<00:00:29.029> have<00:00:29.210> never<00:00:29.420> really<00:00:30.140> come

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:31.100

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:33.110 
to firm conclusions on we've just

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.140 
to firm conclusions on we've just
assumed<00:00:33.530> that<00:00:33.710> the<00:00:34.190> Bible<00:00:34.550> that<00:00:34.640> we<00:00:34.790> have<00:00:34.820> in
