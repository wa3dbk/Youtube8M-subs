00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:59.970 
but it's almost like they're setting up
a<00:02:58.300> new<00:02:58.510> trilogy<00:02:58.900> of<00:02:59.170> heroes<00:02:59.620> like<00:02:59.800> you<00:02:59.890> have

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
a new trilogy of heroes like you have

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.460 
a new trilogy of heroes like you have
John<00:03:00.220> boyega<00:03:00.580> Daisy<00:03:01.090> Ridley<00:03:01.540> and<00:03:01.750> now<00:03:02.020> Oscar

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
John boyega Daisy Ridley and now Oscar

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:04.500 
John boyega Daisy Ridley and now Oscar
Isaac<00:03:02.830> so<00:03:03.370> think<00:03:03.610> of<00:03:03.670> them<00:03:03.820> is<00:03:03.970> like<00:03:04.120> the<00:03:04.300> Luke

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
Isaac so think of them is like the Luke

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.870 
Isaac so think of them is like the Luke
Han<00:03:04.750> and<00:03:05.050> Leia<00:03:05.260> of<00:03:05.530> this<00:03:05.800> new<00:03:05.980> trilogy<00:03:06.280> so

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
Han and Leia of this new trilogy so

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.010 
Han and Leia of this new trilogy so
fingers<00:03:07.150> crossed<00:03:07.210> that<00:03:07.480> none<00:03:07.630> of<00:03:07.660> them<00:03:07.870> died

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:08.020 
fingers crossed that none of them died

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.080 
fingers crossed that none of them died
but<00:03:08.440> I<00:03:08.590> have<00:03:08.830> a<00:03:08.860> feeling<00:03:09.010> that<00:03:09.220> the<00:03:09.550> focus<00:03:09.820> will

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
but I have a feeling that the focus will

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:11.790 
but I have a feeling that the focus will
shift<00:03:10.150> to<00:03:10.660> their<00:03:10.930> characters<00:03:11.380> from<00:03:11.500> the<00:03:11.650> old

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:11.800 
shift to their characters from the old

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.500 
shift to their characters from the old
characters<00:03:12.280> in<00:03:12.400> this<00:03:12.520> first<00:03:12.730> movie<00:03:13.000> it'll<00:03:13.450> be

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
characters in this first movie it'll be

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.540 
characters in this first movie it'll be
like<00:03:13.540> a<00:03:13.690> transition<00:03:14.140> movie<00:03:14.590> and<00:03:14.770> I<00:03:15.280> think<00:03:15.340> I

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:15.550 
like a transition movie and I think I

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:17.100
