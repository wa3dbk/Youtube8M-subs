00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:28.160 

it<00:02:23.580> gives<00:02:23.790> us<00:02:24.320> something<00:02:25.320> of<00:02:25.530> a<00:02:25.620> niche<00:02:27.170> large

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:32.990 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:37.250 

then<00:02:34.130> the<00:02:35.130> other<00:02:35.250> 727<00:02:35.970> right<00:02:36.360> okay

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
then the other 727 right okay

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.190 
then the other 727 right okay
so<00:02:37.620> we're<00:02:37.950> able<00:02:38.070> to<00:02:38.280> be<00:02:38.720> that<00:02:39.720> much<00:02:39.960> more

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
so we're able to be that much more

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.460 
so we're able to be that much more
competitive<00:02:40.500> plus<00:02:40.950> we<00:02:41.040> meet<00:02:41.190> range<00:02:41.540> so<00:02:42.540> a<00:02:42.900> lot

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470

we have to secure parts the big fight
that<00:05:14.240> we're<00:05:14.450> having<00:05:14.690> right<00:05:14.840> now<00:05:14.900> is<00:05:15.440> with

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:15.800 
that we're having right now is with

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:20.070 
that we're having right now is with
breaking<00:05:16.520> discs<00:05:16.990> discs<00:05:17.990> break<00:05:18.290> rings<00:05:18.650> on<00:05:18.920> each

breaking discs discs break rings on each

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:29.670 
breaking discs discs break rings on each
disk<00:05:21.080> and

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:29.680 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:39.480 

it's<00:05:30.680> a<00:05:30.740> huge<00:05:30.949> cost<00:05:32.680> 32,000

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:39.490 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:42.189 

well<00:05:40.490> yeah<00:05:40.669> I'm<00:05:40.939> simply<00:05:41.389> glad<00:05:41.509> to<00:05:41.659> Steve<00:05:41.900> this

00:05:42.189 --> 00:05:42.199 
well yeah I'm simply glad to Steve this

00:05:42.199 --> 00:05:44.079 
well yeah I'm simply glad to Steve this
this<00:05:42.589> you<00:05:43.279> know<00:05:43.370> these<00:05:43.490> types<00:05:43.669> of<00:05:43.759> plans<00:05:43.939> are

00:05:44.079 --> 00:05:44.089 
this you know these types of plans are

00:05:44.089 --> 00:05:46.869 
this you know these types of plans are
still<00:05:44.240> flying<00:05:44.650> I<00:05:45.650> guess<00:05:46.520> I'm<00:05:46.669> kind<00:05:46.849> of

00:05:46.869 --> 00:05:46.879 
still flying I guess I'm kind of

00:05:46.879 --> 00:05:49.059 
still flying I guess I'm kind of
surprised<00:05:47.270> that<00:05:47.479> you<00:05:47.629> know<00:05:48.229> since<00:05:48.830> they<00:05:48.919> don't

00:05:49.059 --> 00:05:49.069 
surprised that you know since they don't

00:05:49.069 --> 00:05:50.610 
surprised that you know since they don't
make<00:05:49.189> these<00:05:49.309> anymore

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:50.620 
make these anymore

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:52.719 
make these anymore
it<00:05:51.620> would<00:05:51.770> seem<00:05:51.919> like<00:05:52.039> it'll<00:05:52.279> get<00:05:52.400> harder<00:05:52.669> and

00:05:52.719 --> 00:05:52.729 
it would seem like it'll get harder and

00:05:52.729 --> 00:05:55.629 
it would seem like it'll get harder and
harder<00:05:52.849> to<00:05:53.089> find<00:05:53.169> parts<00:05:54.169> short<00:05:55.159> of<00:05:55.249> having<00:05:55.550> to

00:05:55.629 --> 00:05:55.639 
harder to find parts short of having to

00:05:55.639 --> 00:05:58.329 
harder to find parts short of having to
actually<00:05:55.939> manufacture<00:05:56.389> parts<00:05:57.020> right<00:05:57.349> a<00:05:58.009> lot

00:05:58.329 --> 00:05:58.339 
actually manufacture parts right a lot

00:05:58.339 --> 00:06:01.450 
actually manufacture parts right a lot
of<00:05:58.400> this<00:05:58.580> stuff<00:05:58.789> can<00:05:58.849> be<00:05:59.120> fabricated<00:06:00.460> and

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:01.460 
of this stuff can be fabricated and

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:02.860 
of this stuff can be fabricated and

they'll<00:06:20.449> have<00:06:20.839> the<00:06:21.529> contract<00:06:22.009> to<00:06:24.009> replace

00:06:24.999 --> 00:06:25.009 
they'll have the contract to replace
