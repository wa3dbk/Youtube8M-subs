00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:24.830
 the practice of fishing at sea 

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:26.390
 mornings from 8h to 12h so that a duration of 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:29.380
 four hours time we talk about three 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.939
 miles from the coast to actually go 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.010
 parked between saint jean de luz and 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:35.290
 hendaye and there we actually go fishing in 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.969
 the funds between 30 35 or even 40 meters of 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:37.510
 background to catch them in feast of the 

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:39.160
 rock fish 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.470
 after which in fact every afternoon 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.610
 we have different cruises including a 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:44.170
 which the most complete called the 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.839
 discovery cruise this one is here 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.920
 departure at 2.30 pm with a duration of 90 

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:49.480
 minutes where it's true she's a 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.579
 little more complete because we're going 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.379
 actually leave on the Spanish side on 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:54.850
 go along so fontarabie to surrender 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:56.379
 at the fishing port of fontarabia for 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.809
 see the baiters finally my boats 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:00.550
 fishing where they fish lakanal tuna at 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:02.290
 paulhan and after that starting again on 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.790
 along the Spanish coast we will spend 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.500
 in front of the monks bay go to 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:07.360
 head of the fig tree to see the expenses 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.650
 which are still pretty splendid and 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.530
 there we will go beyond the cape of fig trees 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.909
 weight reviewed actually on the back of the 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.740
 beautiful story so it's a place when 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:16.780
 even very wild and it is true that 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.759
 since the coast of hendaye is not obvious 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.900
 to see him sadly by going beyond the 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:21.759
 we really see something 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.290
 very wild and after that well we're going 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:24.460
 to leave towards the cliffs of 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:24.820
 shale between saint jean de luz is in 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.619
 mourning 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:29.530
 so it's joined the path of 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:31.360
 coastline and there we will actually access to 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.159
 the bay of loya is the small reserve 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.840
 at the level of the flora which is at 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:36.759
 foot of the castle of antoine of abbadie and 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.469
 after which we go the directions the 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:40.210
 twins celebrates two twins of hendaye 

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:42.479
 and we're going to leave all the way 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:42.479
 from the beach 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.640
 we can say that we really go out 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.280
 all the time is true then according to good 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.320
 sure the state of the sea it turns out we're going 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.000
 change a little bit the course we 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.770
 the advantage here on hendaye is that 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.689
 as we are protected by the Cape of 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.189
 fig tree which gives besides the very 

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:08.590
 pretty beach hendaye well we can 

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:10.989
 modify this course always staying 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.310
 in a fairly protected area and come back 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:12.670
 even finished actually in the bay of 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.530
 txingudi 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.720
 then we start the activity in the month 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.099
 from April to finish actually the month 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.450
 of October a good part actually this 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:20.860
 are tourists but there are also 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.950
 a lot of locals because it's true 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:26.890
 that falla the area here is like very 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.690
 nice to see finally to discover and see beyond 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.190
 of the coast in fact it's a perspective 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.019
 which completely different than life 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.519
 of the mother so actually once 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:35.530
 that we are on board the boat and that we 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:37.989
 see from the boat we have a 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:39.160
 purely different perspective and well 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:41.739
 often the same hends them and are 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.480
 surprised because they live here since 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:44.560
 many years they are surprised to 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.299
 discover places that are not going 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.250
 never discovered in gold offered to jean 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:50.080
 delay also actually at night because the 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.090
 night in fact we will go to admire the 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.920
 sunset or their going to surrender 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.510
 to the cable of the fig tree we go to 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.130
 to overtake but we will see especially a 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.450
 beautiful sunset with the 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:00.790
 colors falling behind the rescript 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.709
 beautiful so we also organize the 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.239
 fireworks in the region knowing 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:06.980
 that there are very nice fireworks 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:08.269
 is also organized at the end of 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.659
 burials of boy's life and 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:10.659
 young lady 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.680
 helped actually here on here even at the port of 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:26.659
 pleasure soko bus street i am the only one 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.099
 since before me in fact we have 

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:29.420
 the sea shuttles or they do not 

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:31.189
 than to cross the evening vida to 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:33.110
 face to fontarabia and he is 

00:03:31.189 --> 00:03:33.379
 true that in sea travel I am the 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:34.819
 only 

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:36.739
 so you can find yourself at our 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:38.540
 stand is therefore at the port of 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:40.730
 pleasure socobioma just behind the 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:42.530
 head to the source at blanco so I have to 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.599
 near the shuttles that make hendaye 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:45.799
 fontarabie so here we have a stand we have 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:46.220
 always a person to inform the 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:48.829
 people 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:52.629
 finally stripped ride schedules and 

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:52.629
