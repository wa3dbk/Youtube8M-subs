00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
clear wheel is pretty good for stamina

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.580 
clear wheel is pretty good for stamina
and<00:02:22.950> defense<00:02:23.540> Diablo<00:02:24.540> also<00:02:25.170> pretty<00:02:25.379> good

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
the MF or attack and since its metal it

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.180 
the MF or attack and since its metal it
has<00:02:33.660> a<00:02:33.690> little<00:02:33.989> bit<00:02:34.080> more<00:02:34.230> stamina<00:02:34.470> so<00:02:34.860> I

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
has a little bit more stamina so I

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.520 
has a little bit more stamina so I
didn't<00:02:35.790> use<00:02:35.940> a<00:02:36.209> metal<00:02:36.900> face<00:02:37.050> because<00:02:37.410> I<00:02:37.500> don't

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
didn't use a metal face because I don't

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.460 
didn't use a metal face because I don't
have<00:02:37.830> enough<00:02:38.340> but<00:02:39.150> I<00:02:39.450> kind<00:02:39.780> of<00:02:39.840> just<00:02:39.900> like<00:02:40.290> it

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:25.170 
tracks for attack type beyblades so you

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:27.740 
tracks for attack type beyblades so you
kind<00:04:25.530> of<00:04:25.560> meet<00:04:26.190> in<00:04:26.370> the<00:04:26.520> middle<00:04:26.850> so<00:04:27.450> I<00:04:27.480> have<00:04:27.600> to

track now the next two beyblades are
defensive<00:04:33.090> type<00:04:33.300> so<00:04:34.080> we<00:04:34.290> have<00:04:34.530> metal<00:04:35.370> face

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550

chance of recoil well just a little bit

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:56.840 
chance of recoil well just a little bit
but<00:04:54.540> since<00:04:54.840> since<00:04:55.590> how<00:04:55.770> it's<00:04:55.980> kind<00:04:56.280> of<00:04:56.370> uneven

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:56.850

but since since how it's kind of uneven
on<00:04:56.940> the<00:04:57.060> inside<00:04:57.480> but<00:04:58.350> still<00:04:58.560> on<00:04:58.770> the<00:04:58.860> outside

on the inside but still on the outside

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:00.110 
on the inside but still on the outside
it's<00:04:59.370> pretty<00:04:59.670> solid

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 
it's pretty solid

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.150 
it's pretty solid
also<00:05:00.540> the<00:05:00.660> BD<00:05:01.050> protects<00:05:01.470> it<00:05:01.620> from<00:05:01.650> the<00:05:01.830> bottom

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.160 
also the BD protects it from the bottom

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.640 
also the BD protects it from the bottom
the<00:05:02.850> NB<00:05:03.270> gives<00:05:03.870> it<00:05:04.020> a<00:05:04.080> little<00:05:04.320> bit<00:05:04.470> more

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:04.650 
the NB gives it a little bit more

of<00:05:07.410> course<00:05:07.710> one<00:05:08.310> place<00:05:08.490> heavy<00:05:08.730> you<00:05:08.940> want<00:05:09.120> to

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:09.180 
of course one place heavy you want to

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:11.120 
of course one place heavy you want to
have<00:05:09.270> that<00:05:09.419> forward<00:05:09.690> offensive<00:05:10.080> type<00:05:10.260> and<00:05:10.590> the

have that forward offensive type and the

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:14.270 
have that forward offensive type and the
bull<00:05:11.570> clear<00:05:12.570> wheel<00:05:12.840> pretty<00:05:13.590> good<00:05:13.800> for<00:05:14.040> a

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:14.280 
bull clear wheel pretty good for a

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.880 
bull clear wheel pretty good for a
defense<00:05:14.880> I<00:05:15.180> think<00:05:15.690> it<00:05:15.960> used<00:05:16.290> to<00:05:16.380> be<00:05:16.500> one<00:05:16.680> of<00:05:16.800> the

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:16.890 
defense I think it used to be one of the

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:18.890 
defense I think it used to be one of the
heaviest<00:05:17.280> cleaner<00:05:17.940> wheels<00:05:18.210> that<00:05:18.630> you<00:05:18.720> could

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:18.900 
heaviest cleaner wheels that you could

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:22.850 
heaviest cleaner wheels that you could
use<00:05:19.110> also<00:05:20.070> I<00:05:20.250> like<00:05:20.490> how<00:05:21.120> this<00:05:21.960> particular<00:05:22.500> one

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:22.860 
use also I like how this particular one

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:24.200 
use also I like how this particular one
looks<00:05:23.190> now<00:05:23.790> the<00:05:23.850> neck

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:24.210 
looks now the neck

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:28.159 
looks now the neck
defensive<00:05:24.750> type<00:05:24.960> is<00:05:25.880> middle<00:05:26.880> face<00:05:27.060> heavy<00:05:27.300> duo

00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:28.169

aquario gb 145 are with a jewel in
stamina<00:05:34.020> mode<00:05:34.350> so<00:05:34.650> it's<00:05:34.800> even<00:05:35.100> all<00:05:35.610> around<00:05:35.669> so

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:36.660 
stamina mode so it's even all around so

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:38.260 
stamina mode so it's even all around so
I<00:05:36.690> guess<00:05:36.870> you<00:05:36.990> can<00:05:37.080> say<00:05:37.259> this<00:05:37.380> is<00:05:37.440> a<00:05:37.560> little<00:05:37.770> bit

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:38.270 
I guess you can say this is a little bit

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:41.360 
I guess you can say this is a little bit
stamina<00:05:39.270> and<00:05:39.479> defense<00:05:39.840> but<00:05:40.650> I'd<00:05:40.770> say<00:05:40.979> mostly

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:41.370 
stamina and defense but I'd say mostly

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:45.499 
stamina and defense but I'd say mostly
defense<00:05:42.740> again<00:05:43.740> be<00:05:44.009> aquario<00:05:44.639> really<00:05:45.330> good

00:05:45.499 --> 00:05:45.509 
defense again be aquario really good

00:05:45.509 --> 00:05:48.650 
defense again be aquario really good
ring<00:05:45.960> for<00:05:46.320> defense<00:05:47.009> or<00:05:47.340> stamina<00:05:47.880> it's<00:05:48.479> also

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:48.660 
ring for defense or stamina it's also

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:50.659 
ring for defense or stamina it's also
one<00:05:48.960> of<00:05:48.990> the<00:05:49.110> heaviest<00:05:49.410> I<00:05:49.710> believe<00:05:50.070> and<00:05:50.340> it's

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:50.669 
one of the heaviest I believe and it's

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:52.370 
one of the heaviest I believe and it's
pretty<00:05:50.910> solid<00:05:51.090> all<00:05:51.389> around<00:05:51.419> kind<00:05:52.020> of<00:05:52.080> like<00:05:52.229> the

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:52.380 
pretty solid all around kind of like the

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:55.850 
pretty solid all around kind of like the
salt<00:05:52.650> and<00:05:52.860> GV<00:05:53.370> 125<00:05:54.110> again<00:05:55.110> just<00:05:55.380> adds<00:05:55.620> a<00:05:55.740> little

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:55.860 
salt and GV 125 again just adds a little

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:57.469 
salt and GV 125 again just adds a little

00:05:57.469 --> 00:05:57.479 
bit more to that stamina and defense and

00:05:57.479 --> 00:06:00.290 
bit more to that stamina and defense and
our<00:05:58.440> be<00:05:58.620> a<00:05:58.889> little<00:05:59.250> bit<00:05:59.340> more<00:05:59.490> grip<00:05:59.820> on<00:06:00.060> the

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:00.300 
our be a little bit more grip on the

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:02.689 
our be a little bit more grip on the
stadium<00:06:00.570> but<00:06:01.560> it<00:06:01.800> has<00:06:01.949> a<00:06:01.979> less<00:06:02.220> chance<00:06:02.430> of

00:06:02.689 --> 00:06:02.699 
stadium but it has a less chance of

00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:04.730 
stadium but it has a less chance of
getting<00:06:03.000> a<00:06:03.180> stay<00:06:03.479> tonight<00:06:03.630> and<00:06:04.050> in<00:06:04.500> my<00:06:04.680> very

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:04.740

of<00:06:07.979> all<00:06:08.340> of<00:06:08.460> them<00:06:08.820> is<00:06:09.120> a<00:06:09.900> stamina<00:06:10.440> type<00:06:10.620> combo

00:06:11.589 --> 00:06:11.599 
of all of them is a stamina type combo

00:06:11.599 --> 00:06:14.240
