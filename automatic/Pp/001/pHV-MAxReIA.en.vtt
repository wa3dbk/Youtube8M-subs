00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
reasons about this is that the fish

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.310 
reasons about this is that the fish
keeps<00:00:15.059> his<00:00:15.389> confidence

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
keeps his confidence

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.470 
keeps his confidence
he<00:00:16.859> gets<00:00:17.070> longer<00:00:17.460> and<00:00:17.609> more<00:00:17.760> colorful<00:00:18.000> fins

he gets longer and more colorful fins

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.189 
he gets longer and more colorful fins

00:00:54.199 --> 00:01:00.349 
training not more than that yeah we're
in<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.590> fish<00:00:55.920> home<00:00:56.370> tank<00:00:56.719> you<00:00:57.719> can<00:00:58.039> use<00:00:59.039> a<00:00:59.359> art

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
in the fish home tank you can use a art

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.540 
in the fish home tank you can use a art
abreu<00:01:00.719> tank<00:01:00.989> if<00:01:01.170> you<00:01:01.199> want<00:01:01.289> but<00:01:02.160> that's

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
abreu tank if you want but that's

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.329 
abreu tank if you want but that's
usually<00:01:03.059> make<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.390> fish<00:01:03.600> stress<00:01:04.140> stress<00:01:04.589> out

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
usually make the fish stress stress out

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.910 
usually make the fish stress stress out
so<00:01:05.939> I<00:01:06.659> recommend<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.710> home<00:01:08.520> out<00:01:08.850> fish<00:01:09.180> and

he's so beautiful so beautiful you see

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:17.869 
he's so beautiful so beautiful you see
that's<00:02:15.959> because<00:02:16.319> he<00:02:16.560> sees<00:02:16.829> himself<00:02:17.129> and<00:02:17.670> he

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:17.879 
that's because he sees himself and he

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:20.690 
that's because he sees himself and he
thinks<00:02:18.299> that<00:02:18.359> dust<00:02:18.810> is<00:02:19.049> her<00:02:19.319> rival<00:02:19.739> and<00:02:19.950> an

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
thinks that dust is her rival and an

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.940 
thinks that dust is her rival and an
enemy<00:02:21.799> so<00:02:22.799> he<00:02:22.829> has<00:02:23.400> to<00:02:23.870> fit<00:02:24.870> up<00:02:25.019> build<00:02:25.349> up<00:02:25.560> some

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
enemy so he has to fit up build up some

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:31.300 
enemy so he has to fit up build up some
confidence<00:02:26.459> to<00:02:28.640> say<00:02:29.640> scare<00:02:30.120> a<00:02:30.150> de<00:02:30.510> Rivel<00:02:30.719> away

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
confidence to say scare a de Rivel away

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:36.920 
confidence to say scare a de Rivel away
this<00:02:32.310> is<00:02:32.549> why<00:02:32.760> they<00:02:33.030> do<00:02:33.090> like<00:02:33.840> this<00:02:34.079> I<00:02:35.930> think

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
this is why they do like this I think

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:57.330 
this is why they do like this I think
he's<00:02:37.200> very<00:02:37.500> very<00:02:38.489> beautiful<00:02:38.670> with<00:02:39.209> his<00:02:39.450> fins

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:00.000 

and<00:02:57.540> as<00:02:58.540> you<00:02:58.690> see<00:02:58.870> it<00:02:58.989> a<00:02:59.110> fish<00:02:59.319> get<00:02:59.590> a<00:02:59.620> little

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
and as you see it a fish get a little

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.180 
and as you see it a fish get a little
bit<00:03:00.130> stressed<00:03:00.610> out<00:03:00.970> in<00:03:01.569> this<00:03:01.959> training<00:03:02.260> so

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
bit stressed out in this training so

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.930 
bit stressed out in this training so
make<00:03:03.520> sure<00:03:03.550> that<00:03:03.790> the<00:03:04.830> training<00:03:05.830> knows<00:03:06.370> is<00:03:06.640> not

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
make sure that the training knows is not
