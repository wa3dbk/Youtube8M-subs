00:00:00.969 --> 00:00:02.300
 tell that time 

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:03.800
 I guess, that 

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.170
 World War II 

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:08.389
 another question 

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:11.389
 why after this very quiet 

00:00:12.569 --> 00:00:14.549
 mode he notes 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:15.570
 residents 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.039
 the second reason is very important he 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:20.880
 normal access 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.349
 v.v girls 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:24.789
 we have not yet decided to me then it was very 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:26.220
 nicely 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.499
 i'm calm 

00:00:29.499 --> 00:00:31.909
 as soon as you say it all million rubles 

00:00:31.909 --> 00:00:34.870
 what to build on this place 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:37.470
 Fogh Rasmussen welcomed 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:39.250
 even could 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.710
 second important question about the vote of confidence 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:43.640
 to the government 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.130
 returning from life 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:50.510
 that is, the leading agency does not specify 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:52.410
 the next day 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.980
 but then I will be bad 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.360
 I know therefore feeding 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.120
 even the most 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.120
 It can not be 

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:07.520
 100 times the most 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.450
 I ask how the lawyer said 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.880
 world colleagues 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.300
 the day after tomorrow said hasanov 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.120
 in the next round 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.750
 only when 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.750
 sometimes give people 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.930
 that is, such an expression now 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:28.900
 a little bit like a lot 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.270
 protesters parted like fairy tales 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:33.910
 thanks to a goal 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:36.910
 but still the cathedral took place 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:39.610
 everywhere and the great commander 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:41.910
 because in this case 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:43.350
 all that is done 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.430
 it is related to learning 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:47.620
 Russians 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:49.180
 although just 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:50.260
 part-commander 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.370
 etc 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:54.640
 in composition 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.710
 however, development workers are already in 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.970
 this year 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:01.170
 showing 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.840
 just doing an hour 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.610
 are present and the squad leader 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.310
 that means he became according to German 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:10.920
 calculation by phone t 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.839
 for any reason 

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:14.359
 if now 

00:02:14.359 --> 00:02:16.399
 we will already be grateful said 

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:18.979
 banned while the squad leader 

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:22.419
 traditionally such pressure 

00:02:22.419 --> 00:02:25.419
 instead of this question he said 

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:31.409
 at customs 

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:33.799
 m 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:36.789
 so the brazil team 

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:39.789
 based on personnel 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:41.570
 recall today 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:44.570
 represented on the vietnam market 

00:02:47.029 --> 00:02:48.659
 about getting there now 

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:50.839
 services 

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:53.149
 has changed 

00:02:53.149 --> 00:02:55.119
 more than seven previous periods 

00:02:55.119 --> 00:02:57.459
 serve can eliminate violations
