wheels<00:01:10.979> it<00:01:11.340> was<00:01:11.460> super<00:01:11.760> hard<00:01:11.939> to<00:01:12.060> find<00:01:12.330> them

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
wheels it was super hard to find them

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.700 
wheels it was super hard to find them
because<00:01:12.900> they<00:01:13.409> are<00:01:14.150> rare<00:01:15.350> apparently<00:01:16.350> the

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
anyway if I wanted the black ones I

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.280 
anyway if I wanted the black ones I
could<00:01:27.060> have<00:01:27.180> found<00:01:27.270> those<00:01:27.479> anywhere<00:01:27.840> but<00:01:28.080> I

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
could have found those anywhere but I

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.719 
could have found those anywhere but I
didn't<00:01:28.619> I<00:01:28.740> want<00:01:28.920> to<00:01:28.979> go<00:01:29.070> back<00:01:29.189> to<00:01:29.340> a<00:01:29.369> machined

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
didn't I want to go back to a machined

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.249 
didn't I want to go back to a machined
wheel<00:01:29.909> actually<00:01:30.240> I<00:01:30.450> wanted<00:01:30.689> a<00:01:30.780> polished<00:01:31.079> wheel

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
wheel actually I wanted a polished wheel

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.609 
wheel actually I wanted a polished wheel
like<00:01:31.680> a<00:01:31.710> centerline<00:01:32.100> but<00:01:33.049> patient<00:01:34.049> wait<00:01:34.320> four

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
like a centerline but patient wait four

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.910 
like a centerline but patient wait four
or<00:01:34.710> five<00:01:34.890> weeks<00:01:35.570> for<00:01:36.570> them<00:01:36.689> to<00:01:36.869> make<00:01:37.079> one<00:01:37.259> so<00:01:37.590> I

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
or five weeks for them to make one so I

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.440 
or five weeks for them to make one so I
got<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.400> methods<00:01:38.790> I<00:01:38.909> think<00:01:39.119> I'm<00:01:39.210> gonna<00:01:39.299> be

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
got the methods I think I'm gonna be

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.819 
got the methods I think I'm gonna be
happy<00:01:39.600> as<00:01:39.960> you<00:01:40.079> can<00:01:40.200> see<00:01:40.350> these<00:01:40.530> are<00:01:40.680> pretty

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
happy as you can see these are pretty

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.970 
happy as you can see these are pretty
much<00:01:40.979> balled<00:01:41.869> losing<00:01:42.869> traction

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:43.980 
much balled losing traction

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.270 
much balled losing traction
too<00:01:44.580> many<00:01:44.700> burnouts<00:01:45.710> and<00:01:46.710> they're<00:01:46.920> only<00:01:47.010> rated

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
too many burnouts and they're only rated

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.340 
too many burnouts and they're only rated
for<00:01:47.430> 50<00:01:47.820> psi<00:01:48.270> I<00:01:48.300> think<00:01:48.630> these<00:01:48.750> ones<00:01:48.930> are<00:01:49.140> rated

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
for 50 psi I think these ones are rated

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.950 
for 50 psi I think these ones are rated
for<00:01:49.470> 80<00:01:49.650> psi<00:01:50.160> cold<00:01:50.460> so<00:01:50.730> hopefully<00:01:51.570> they<00:01:51.720> fit

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
for 80 psi cold so hopefully they fit

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.020 
for 80 psi cold so hopefully they fit
with<00:01:52.140> no<00:01:52.170> rubbing<00:01:52.620> because<00:01:52.800> these<00:01:53.160> 305<00:01:53.700> rub

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
with no rubbing because these 305 rub

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.140 
with no rubbing because these 305 rub
but<00:01:54.750> you<00:01:54.840> can<00:01:54.990> see<00:01:55.170> that<00:01:55.350> they're<00:01:55.560> quite<00:01:55.830> a<00:01:55.860> bit

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:56.150 
but you can see that they're quite a bit

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:03.350 
but you can see that they're quite a bit
taller<00:02:00.530> Holley<00:02:01.530> about<00:02:01.770> an<00:02:01.860> inch<00:02:02.150> 3/4<00:02:03.150> of<00:02:03.180> an

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
taller Holley about an inch 3/4 of an

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.310 
taller Holley about an inch 3/4 of an
inch<00:02:04.730> and<00:02:05.730> that's<00:02:06.150> not<00:02:06.420> inflated<00:02:06.930> so<00:02:07.110> once

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
inch and that's not inflated so once

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.570 
inch and that's not inflated so once
they're<00:02:07.500> inflated<00:02:07.890> they<00:02:07.980> might<00:02:08.160> be<00:02:08.310> even<00:02:08.400> a

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
they're inflated they might be even a

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.490 
they're inflated they might be even a
little<00:02:08.610> bit<00:02:08.910> taller<00:02:09.090> but<00:02:09.390> they're<00:02:10.140> about<00:02:10.350> an

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
little bit taller but they're about an

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:16.390 
little bit taller but they're about an
inch<00:02:11.510> maybe<00:02:12.510> an<00:02:12.720> inch<00:02:12.900> and<00:02:13.080> a<00:02:13.140> third<00:02:13.550> narrower

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
inch maybe an inch and a third narrower

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.470 
inch maybe an inch and a third narrower
hopefully<00:02:17.400> that<00:02:17.550> makes<00:02:17.760> a<00:02:17.880> difference<00:02:18.240> on<00:02:18.360> the

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
hopefully that makes a difference on the

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:19.910 
hopefully that makes a difference on the
front<00:02:18.510> otherwise<00:02:19.140> I'm<00:02:19.320> gonna<00:02:19.440> have<00:02:19.500> to<00:02:19.680> crank
