00:00:01.149 --> 00:00:03.610 

just<00:00:02.149> thought<00:00:02.300> I'd<00:00:02.510> show<00:00:02.780> you<00:00:02.810> a<00:00:03.020> preview<00:00:03.379> of

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:03.620 
just thought I'd show you a preview of

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:06.630 
just thought I'd show you a preview of
the<00:00:03.919> Ford<00:00:04.190> think<00:00:04.549> and<00:00:04.790> the<00:00:05.299> progress<00:00:05.779> of

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:06.640 
the Ford think and the progress of

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:10.000 
the Ford think and the progress of
putting<00:00:07.640> a<00:00:07.730> small<00:00:08.090> engine<00:00:08.960> in<00:00:09.080> it<00:00:09.230> to<00:00:09.620> repower

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:10.010 
putting a small engine in it to repower

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:13.290 
putting a small engine in it to repower
it<00:00:10.310> since<00:00:11.120> we<00:00:11.330> can't<00:00:11.630> economically<00:00:12.350> fix<00:00:12.830> the

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:13.300 
it since we can't economically fix the

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:18.760 
it since we can't economically fix the
electrics<00:00:14.300> in<00:00:14.480> it<00:00:15.850> there<00:00:16.850> is<00:00:16.880> a<00:00:17.170> back<00:00:18.170> panel

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:18.770 
electrics in it there is a back panel

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:21.430 
electrics in it there is a back panel
that<00:00:19.070> goes<00:00:19.310> in<00:00:19.550> here<00:00:19.580> and<00:00:20.000> what<00:00:20.990> I'm<00:00:21.110> going<00:00:21.350> to

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:21.440 
that goes in here and what I'm going to

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:23.350 
that goes in here and what I'm going to
do<00:00:21.620> is<00:00:21.770> put<00:00:21.950> the<00:00:22.070> trunk<00:00:22.400> lid<00:00:22.610> on<00:00:22.850> and<00:00:23.060> give<00:00:23.240> you

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:23.360 
do is put the trunk lid on and give you

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.480 
do is put the trunk lid on and give you
a<00:00:23.420> better<00:00:23.539> idea<00:00:23.690> how<00:00:24.289> how<00:00:24.680> it<00:00:24.830> all<00:00:24.950> fits<00:00:25.280> in

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:25.490 
a better idea how how it all fits in

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.230 
a better idea how how it all fits in
here

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:28.240 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:40.090 

trunk<00:00:29.240> lid<00:00:29.300> rides<00:00:36.130> up<00:00:37.130> here<00:00:37.550> and<00:00:38.680> you<00:00:39.680> can<00:00:39.829> see

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:40.100 
trunk lid rides up here and you can see

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.830 
trunk lid rides up here and you can see
that<00:00:40.340> the<00:00:40.520> engine<00:00:40.850> is<00:00:41.000> pretty<00:00:41.270> well<00:00:41.450> stuffed

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:41.840 
that the engine is pretty well stuffed

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:47.260 
that the engine is pretty well stuffed
back<00:00:42.079> in<00:00:42.350> there<00:00:42.560> but<00:00:43.450> most<00:00:45.760> let<00:00:46.760> the<00:00:46.910> camera

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:47.270 
back in there but most let the camera

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:49.200 
back in there but most let the camera
catch<00:00:47.480> up<00:00:47.720> here<00:00:47.930> I<00:00:47.960> think<00:00:48.260> that's<00:00:48.410> in<00:00:48.590> focus

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:49.210 
catch up here I think that's in focus

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.959 
catch up here I think that's in focus
but<00:00:50.210> most<00:00:50.510> of<00:00:50.630> all<00:00:50.720> we<00:00:50.899> need<00:00:51.110> access<00:00:51.380> to<00:00:51.710> as<00:00:52.399> is

00:00:52.959 --> 00:00:52.969 
but most of all we need access to as is

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:57.459 
but most of all we need access to as is
right<00:00:53.270> here<00:00:53.710> here's<00:00:54.710> the<00:00:54.920> oil<00:00:54.950> filler<00:00:56.290> if<00:00:57.290> I

00:00:57.459 --> 00:00:57.469 
right here here's the oil filler if I

00:00:57.469 --> 00:00:59.260 
right here here's the oil filler if I
take<00:00:57.680> some<00:00:57.860> light<00:00:58.070> around<00:00:58.430> here<00:00:58.670> you<00:00:58.879> might<00:00:59.059> be

00:00:59.260 --> 00:00:59.270 
take some light around here you might be

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:04.869 
take some light around here you might be
able<00:00:59.450> to<00:00:59.540> see<00:01:00.010> how<00:01:01.010> I've<00:01:03.549> already<00:01:04.549> built<00:01:04.670> the

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:04.879 
able to see how I've already built the

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:08.889 
able to see how I've already built the
engine<00:01:05.089> mount<00:01:05.449> system<00:01:07.209> there's<00:01:08.209> a<00:01:08.270> plate<00:01:08.630> in

00:01:08.889 --> 00:01:08.899 
engine mount system there's a plate in

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:09.429 
engine mount system there's a plate in
here

00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:09.439 
here

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:13.059 
here
you<00:01:09.859> can<00:01:10.069> see<00:01:10.340> this<00:01:11.020> this<00:01:12.020> 1<00:01:12.289> inch<00:01:12.499> tube<00:01:12.859> that

00:01:13.059 --> 00:01:13.069 
you can see this this 1 inch tube that

00:01:13.069 --> 00:01:15.489 
you can see this this 1 inch tube that
goes<00:01:13.249> across<00:01:13.399> to<00:01:14.240> stiffen<00:01:14.869> the<00:01:15.020> plate<00:01:15.289> that

00:01:15.489 --> 00:01:15.499 
goes across to stiffen the plate that

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:19.629 
goes across to stiffen the plate that
the<00:01:15.649> engines<00:01:15.979> mounted<00:01:16.159> on<00:01:16.719> you<00:01:17.719> can<00:01:17.899> see<00:01:18.170> a<00:01:18.679> cut

00:01:19.629 --> 00:01:19.639 
the engines mounted on you can see a cut

00:01:19.639 --> 00:01:27.489 
the engines mounted on you can see a cut
here<00:01:20.709> made<00:01:21.709> in<00:01:22.959> some<00:01:23.959> of<00:01:24.109> the<00:01:26.319> some<00:01:27.319> of<00:01:27.350> the

00:01:27.489 --> 00:01:27.499 
here made in some of the some of the

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:30.489 
here made in some of the some of the
structure<00:01:28.009> that's<00:01:28.219> beefed<00:01:28.520> up<00:01:28.759> where<00:01:29.090> the<00:01:29.499> the

00:01:30.489 --> 00:01:30.499 
structure that's beefed up where the the

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:35.410 
structure that's beefed up where the the
axle<00:01:31.060> passes<00:01:32.950> through<00:01:33.950> a<00:01:33.979> hole<00:01:34.249> there<00:01:34.609> this<00:01:35.179> is

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
axle passes through a hole there this is

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.800 
axle passes through a hole there this is
a<00:01:35.450> bottom<00:01:36.079> doubt<00:01:36.399> so<00:01:37.399> that<00:01:37.789> axle<00:01:38.450> is<00:01:38.599> never

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
a bottom doubt so that axle is never

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.730 
a bottom doubt so that axle is never
going<00:01:39.049> to<00:01:39.139> go<00:01:39.259> any<00:01:39.409> further<00:01:39.649> down<00:01:41.289> we<00:01:42.289> might<00:01:42.529> be

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
going to go any further down we might be

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.349 
going to go any further down we might be
able<00:01:42.889> to<00:01:43.009> get<00:01:43.189> the<00:01:43.310> camera<00:01:43.639> down<00:01:43.819> here<00:01:44.090> where

00:01:44.349 --> 00:01:44.359 
able to get the camera down here where

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:47.260 
able to get the camera down here where
you<00:01:44.389> can<00:01:44.719> actually<00:01:45.380> see<00:01:46.130> part<00:01:46.459> of<00:01:46.579> the<00:01:46.729> front

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
you can actually see part of the front

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.889 
you can actually see part of the front
motor<00:01:47.509> mount<00:01:47.899> and<00:01:48.229> how<00:01:49.130> it's<00:01:49.369> designed<00:01:49.880> to<00:01:50.060> to

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:50.899 
motor mount and how it's designed to to

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:53.649 
motor mount and how it's designed to to
clear<00:01:51.409> the<00:01:51.590> axle<00:01:52.069> and<00:01:52.219> in<00:01:52.729> the<00:01:52.880> universal<00:01:53.479> back

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:53.659 
clear the axle and in the universal back

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:56.529 
clear the axle and in the universal back
on<00:01:53.899> that<00:01:54.109> side<00:01:54.380> but<00:01:55.279> anyway<00:01:55.700> it<00:01:56.119> looks<00:01:56.149> like

00:01:56.529 --> 00:01:56.539 
on that side but anyway it looks like

00:01:56.539 --> 00:02:00.209 
on that side but anyway it looks like
it's<00:01:56.779> all<00:01:56.929> going<00:01:57.139> to<00:01:57.200> fit<00:01:57.439> in<00:01:57.499> here<00:01:58.239> of<00:01:59.239> course

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:00.219 
it's all going to fit in here of course

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:05.159 
it's all going to fit in here of course
we<00:02:01.219> have<00:02:01.340> more<00:02:01.549> fittings<00:02:01.999> fitting<00:02:02.749> to<00:02:02.899> do<00:02:03.079> and

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:05.169 
we have more fittings fitting to do and

00:02:05.169 --> 00:02:08.770 
we have more fittings fitting to do and
we<00:02:06.169> have<00:02:06.429> just<00:02:07.429> a<00:02:07.549> few<00:02:07.780> engineering

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
we have just a few engineering

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.180 
we have just a few engineering
challenges<00:02:09.470> left<00:02:10.690> like<00:02:11.950> building<00:02:12.950> a<00:02:13.040> good

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
challenges left like building a good

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.930 
challenges left like building a good
intake<00:02:13.610> man

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
intake man

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.660

been cut out like I say it might be a

been cut out like I say it might be a
fiberglass<00:02:48.380> back<00:02:48.650> together<00:02:48.860> when<00:02:49.280> we're<00:02:49.490> done

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
fiberglass back together when we're done

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:55.150 
fiberglass back together when we're done
but<00:02:51.580> we<00:02:52.580> still<00:02:53.060> have<00:02:53.330> some<00:02:53.630> some<00:02:54.410> work<00:02:54.650> to<00:02:54.980> get

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
but we still have some some work to get

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:00.760 
but we still have some some work to get
to<00:02:55.430> our<00:02:57.010> or<00:02:58.450> difficult<00:02:59.450> and<00:03:00.050> build<00:03:00.320> our<00:03:00.470> drive

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:00.770 
to our or difficult and build our drive

system<00:03:01.250> up<00:03:01.700> forward<00:03:02.210> to<00:03:02.390> the<00:03:02.540> differential

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
system up forward to the differential

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.920 
system up forward to the differential
but<00:03:04.220> you<00:03:04.370> can<00:03:04.490> get<00:03:04.580> some<00:03:04.790> idea<00:03:05.150> out<00:03:05.330> it's<00:03:05.570> it's

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
but you can get some idea out it's it's

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.190 
but you can get some idea out it's it's
all<00:03:06.170> fitting<00:03:06.680> together<00:03:07.600> well<00:03:08.600> that's<00:03:08.720> all<00:03:09.020> for

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
all fitting together well that's all for

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:15.330 
all fitting together well that's all for
now<00:03:10.960> this<00:03:11.960> is<00:03:12.170> by<00:03:12.770> no<00:03:12.950> means<00:03:12.980> a<00:03:13.960> professional
