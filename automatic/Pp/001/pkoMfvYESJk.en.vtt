all right well these guys are getting

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:03.800 
all right well these guys are getting
bigger<00:00:02.429> and<00:00:02.700> they<00:00:03.060> got<00:00:03.210> a<00:00:03.240> brand<00:00:03.510> new<00:00:03.600> facility

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:03.810 
bigger and they got a brand new facility

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:05.690 
bigger and they got a brand new facility
so<00:00:04.350> we're<00:00:04.470> here<00:00:04.589> to<00:00:04.650> check<00:00:04.710> it<00:00:04.980> out<00:00:05.130> and<00:00:05.370> as

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
so we're here to check it out and as

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.680 
so we're here to check it out and as
always<00:00:05.819> it<00:00:06.270> starts<00:00:06.569> from<00:00:06.629> raw<00:00:06.930> material

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:08.690 
always it starts from raw material

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:10.610 
always it starts from raw material
instead<00:00:09.690> of<00:00:09.840> making<00:00:10.019> everything<00:00:10.230> in<00:00:10.500> the

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
instead of making everything in the

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.860 
instead of making everything in the
states<00:00:11.130> right<00:00:11.309> here<00:00:11.820> California<00:00:12.509> and<00:00:12.690> you<00:00:12.750> got

states right here California and you got

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.360 
states right here California and you got
to<00:00:12.960> ask<00:00:13.049> yourself<00:00:13.170> how<00:00:13.920> do<00:00:13.980> you<00:00:14.040> do<00:00:14.190> business

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370

in the States anymore you get smarter
got<00:00:18.630> everything<00:00:19.109> from<00:00:19.320> the<00:00:19.439> coils<00:00:19.859> to<00:00:20.400> make

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
got everything from the coils to make

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.519 
got everything from the coils to make
the<00:00:20.789> basic<00:00:21.240> things<00:00:21.480> of<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:21.840> the<00:00:22.140> bodies<00:00:22.500> of

over here this is a looks like we're

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.450 
over here this is a looks like we're
starting<00:00:49.379> with<00:00:49.500> a<00:00:49.530> sheet<00:00:49.770> we're<00:00:50.010> rolling<00:00:50.340> it

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
starting with a sheet we're rolling it

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.310 
starting with a sheet we're rolling it
in<00:00:50.610> that<00:00:51.000> same<00:00:51.329> concept<00:00:51.840> we're<00:00:51.989> taking<00:00:52.230> the

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
in that same concept we're taking the

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.049 
in that same concept we're taking the
basic<00:00:52.620> raw<00:00:52.770> material<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:53.309> coil<00:00:53.550> and<00:00:53.850> this<00:00:53.940> is

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
basic raw material the coil and this is

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.150 
basic raw material the coil and this is
our<00:00:54.149> muffler<00:00:54.510> machine<00:00:54.840> basically<00:00:55.469> this<00:00:56.010> will

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
our muffler machine basically this will

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.860 
our muffler machine basically this will
take<00:00:56.340> what<00:00:56.579> we<00:00:56.670> have<00:00:56.699> is<00:00:57.030> a<00:00:57.059> raw<00:00:57.420> piece<00:00:57.690> of

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
take what we have is a raw piece of

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.139 
take what we have is a raw piece of
stainless<00:00:58.140> steel<00:00:58.399> run<00:00:59.399> through<00:00:59.730> actually

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
stainless steel run through actually

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.790 
stainless steel run through actually

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
stamp our name into its sheer it to the

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.979 
stamp our name into its sheer it to the
right<00:01:01.949> length<00:01:02.300> form<00:01:03.300> it<00:01:03.449> into<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.750> actual

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
right length form it into the actual

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.810 
right length form it into the actual
either<00:01:04.320> oval<00:01:04.769> round<00:01:05.070> or<00:01:05.339> whatever<00:01:05.580> shape

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
either oval round or whatever shape

either oval round or whatever shape
necessary<00:01:06.860> laser<00:01:07.860> seem<00:01:08.250> well<00:01:08.460> but<00:01:08.670> and<00:01:09.630> pop

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
necessary laser seem well but and pop

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.330 
necessary laser seem well but and pop
out<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.110> other<00:01:10.320> side<00:01:10.409> what<00:01:10.920> looks<00:01:11.130> like

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
out the other side what looks like

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.740 
out the other side what looks like
pretty<00:01:11.729> much<00:01:11.820> i<00:01:12.060> muffler<00:01:12.299> without<00:01:12.600> end

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750 
pretty much i muffler without end

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.020 
pretty much i muffler without end
alright<00:01:15.440> so<00:01:15.650> we<00:01:15.770> had<00:01:15.950> like<00:01:16.190> a<00:01:16.430> roll<00:01:16.700> of<00:01:16.730> tape

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030 
alright so we had like a roll of tape

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.090 
alright so we had like a roll of tape
over<00:01:17.240> there<00:01:17.540> at<00:01:17.690> a<00:01:17.720> stainless<00:01:18.170> steel<00:01:18.410> and<00:01:18.650> now

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
over there at a stainless steel and now

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.590 
over there at a stainless steel and now
we<00:01:19.160> got<00:01:19.370> cool<00:01:19.640> tubes<00:01:19.910> we<00:01:20.120> can<00:01:20.240> start<00:01:20.450> making

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
we got cool tubes we can start making

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.870 
we got cool tubes we can start making
catalyst<00:01:21.230> bodies<00:01:21.560> out<00:01:21.710> of<00:01:21.740> absolutely<00:01:22.190> and<00:01:22.760> as

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
catalyst bodies out of absolutely and as

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.670 
catalyst bodies out of absolutely and as
you<00:01:22.970> can<00:01:23.120> see<00:01:23.150> the<00:01:23.600> the<00:01:23.870> seam<00:01:24.050> weld<00:01:24.260> is<00:01:24.350> always

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 
you can see the the seam weld is always

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.080 
you can see the the seam weld is always
are<00:01:24.800> controlled<00:01:25.160> you<00:01:25.250> get<00:01:25.340> a<00:01:25.400> nice<00:01:25.550> even<00:01:25.729> well

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
are controlled you get a nice even well

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.090 
are controlled you get a nice even well
the<00:01:26.360> penetration<00:01:26.960> is<00:01:27.020> very<00:01:27.170> good<00:01:27.440> and<00:01:27.950> it

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
the penetration is very good and it

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.410 
the penetration is very good and it
actually<00:01:28.250> allows<00:01:28.460> for<00:01:28.820> surface<00:01:29.120> if<00:01:29.240> we<00:01:29.300> can

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
actually allows for surface if we can

different<00:01:54.830> and<00:01:55.130> this<00:01:55.460> is<00:01:55.640> what<00:01:55.910> we're<00:01:56.030> looking

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
different and this is what we're looking

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.240 
different and this is what we're looking
at<00:01:56.479> here<00:01:56.540> is<00:01:56.840> basically<00:01:57.200> this<00:01:57.649> machine<00:01:58.070> is

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
at here is basically this machine is

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.210 
at here is basically this machine is
capable<00:01:58.690> of<00:01:59.690> taking<00:02:00.110> that<00:02:00.380> end<00:02:00.649> form<00:02:00.950> and

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:01.220 
capable of taking that end form and

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:02.859 
capable of taking that end form and
creating<00:02:02.090> what<00:02:02.210> we<00:02:02.330> have<00:02:02.479> here<00:02:02.690> in<00:02:02.810> the

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869 
creating what we have here in the

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:05.469 
creating what we have here in the
finished<00:02:03.170> product<00:02:03.560> it<00:02:04.160> actually<00:02:04.369> rolls<00:02:04.759> all

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
finished product it actually rolls all

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:07.540 
finished product it actually rolls all
the<00:02:05.600> edges<00:02:05.960> and<00:02:05.990> extrudes<00:02:06.619> the<00:02:06.890> end<00:02:07.039> out<00:02:07.250> until

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:07.550 
the edges and extrudes the end out until

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.279 
the edges and extrudes the end out until
you<00:02:07.610> actually<00:02:07.759> get<00:02:08.060> what<00:02:08.570> started<00:02:08.869> off<00:02:09.020> as<00:02:09.050> a

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
you actually get what started off as a

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:11.110 
you actually get what started off as a
16<00:02:09.920> gauge<00:02:10.100> piece<00:02:10.280> of<00:02:10.399> material<00:02:10.520> to<00:02:10.820> something

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
16 gauge piece of material to something

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.250 
16 gauge piece of material to something
is<00:02:11.209> actually<00:02:11.450> a<00:02:11.480> much<00:02:11.630> thicker<00:02:11.870> and<00:02:12.110> much

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
is actually a much thicker and much

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.350 
is actually a much thicker and much

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
and Dolly out you see you make something

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:20.410 
and Dolly out you see you make something
like<00:02:16.190> that

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:21.699

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
you'll see a little bit of what we got

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.550 
you'll see a little bit of what we got
we<00:02:26.150> got<00:02:26.209> the<00:02:26.390> steel<00:02:26.569> wool<00:02:26.750> packing<00:02:27.170> that's

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
we got the steel wool packing that's

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.080 
we got the steel wool packing that's
there<00:02:27.739> to<00:02:27.770> actually<00:02:28.099> protect<00:02:28.250> the<00:02:28.550> acoustic

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
there to actually protect the acoustic

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:30.370 
there to actually protect the acoustic
packing<00:02:29.390> material<00:02:29.690> that<00:02:29.780> we<00:02:29.840> put<00:02:29.989> around<00:02:30.170> it

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
packing material that we put around it

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:31.870 
packing material that we put around it
we<00:02:30.680> will<00:02:30.830> take<00:02:31.010> this<00:02:31.160> part<00:02:31.430> here<00:02:31.580> it<00:02:31.760> actually

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880

around it stuff it and actually shove it
into<00:02:35.900> the<00:02:35.989> body<00:02:36.170> that<00:02:36.349> we<00:02:36.470> just<00:02:36.590> rolled<00:02:36.860> at<00:02:36.980> the

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:37.069 
into the body that we just rolled at the

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:39.250 
into the body that we just rolled at the
other<00:02:37.190> machine<00:02:37.520> okay<00:02:38.209> all<00:02:38.690> right<00:02:38.810> so<00:02:38.930> I<00:02:38.959> see<00:02:39.140> we

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
other machine okay all right so I see we

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.440 
other machine okay all right so I see we
got<00:02:39.410> maybe<00:02:39.590> a<00:02:39.680> stuffer<00:02:40.100> here<00:02:40.430> and<00:02:40.700> it<00:02:41.300> looks

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
got maybe a stuffer here and it looks

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.479 
got maybe a stuffer here and it looks
like<00:02:41.510> an<00:02:41.690> assembly<00:02:41.930> line<00:02:42.140> and<00:02:42.590> then<00:02:42.709> what<00:02:43.459> are

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:43.489 
like an assembly line and then what are

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:44.620 
like an assembly line and then what are
we<00:02:43.550> treating<00:02:43.790> in<00:02:43.970> there<00:02:44.090> I<00:02:44.150> see<00:02:44.360> a<00:02:44.390> lot<00:02:44.600> of

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
we treating in there I see a lot of

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:46.479 
we treating in there I see a lot of
things<00:02:44.959> going<00:02:45.170> on<00:02:45.470> this<00:02:45.860> is<00:02:46.040> the<00:02:46.160> big<00:02:46.280> fun

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:46.489 
things going on this is the big fun

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:47.710 
things going on this is the big fun
machine<00:02:46.670> this<00:02:47.030> is<00:02:47.180> where<00:02:47.300> you<00:02:47.420> can<00:02:47.569> actually

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
machine this is where you can actually

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.870 
machine this is where you can actually
watch<00:02:48.080> the<00:02:48.769> part<00:02:49.010> that<00:02:49.190> looks<00:02:49.220> almost<00:02:49.550> like<00:02:49.790> a

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
watch the part that looks almost like a

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.580 
watch the part that looks almost like a
muffler<00:02:50.239> go<00:02:50.480> from<00:02:50.780> something<00:02:51.080> that's<00:02:51.290> a<00:02:51.410> bunch

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
muffler go from something that's a bunch

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.410 
muffler go from something that's a bunch
of<00:02:51.680> assembled<00:02:52.130> parts<00:02:52.489> to<00:02:52.880> the<00:02:53.000> part<00:02:53.180> that<00:02:53.300> you

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
of assembled parts to the part that you

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.000 
of assembled parts to the part that you
open<00:02:53.660> the<00:02:53.720> box<00:02:53.930> and<00:02:54.080> see<00:02:54.319> which<00:02:54.560> is<00:02:54.680> completely

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
open the box and see which is completely

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.070 
open the box and see which is completely
welded<00:02:55.310> on<00:02:55.580> all<00:02:55.730> sides<00:02:56.030> including<00:02:56.300> the<00:02:56.870> body

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 
welded on all sides including the body

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.600 
welded on all sides including the body
and<00:02:57.319> the<00:02:57.380> actual<00:02:57.680> nipples<00:02:58.040> that<00:02:58.100> go<00:02:58.250> into<00:02:58.400> it

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
and the actual nipples that go into it

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:00.190 
and the actual nipples that go into it
cool<00:02:59.060> so<00:02:59.330> on<00:02:59.480> the<00:02:59.600> other<00:02:59.750> side<00:02:59.959> of<00:02:59.989> there<00:03:00.170> i

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
cool so on the other side of there i

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:05.710 
cool so on the other side of there i
gotta<00:03:00.500> finish<00:03:00.830> bumper<00:03:01.340> absolutely<00:03:04.360> this<00:03:05.360> kind

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
gotta finish bumper absolutely this kind

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.360 
gotta finish bumper absolutely this kind
of<00:03:05.750> fixture<00:03:06.140> looks<00:03:06.380> pretty<00:03:06.590> familiar<00:03:06.739> yep

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
of fixture looks pretty familiar yep

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:08.770 
of fixture looks pretty familiar yep
this<00:03:07.580> is<00:03:07.640> exactly<00:03:08.060> what<00:03:08.330> we<00:03:08.420> got<00:03:08.569> out<00:03:08.690> of

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
this is exactly what we got out of

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:10.660 
this is exactly what we got out of
prototyping<00:03:09.319> earlier<00:03:09.650> today<00:03:09.860> and<00:03:10.310> what<00:03:10.580> we

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
prototyping earlier today and what we

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:12.009 
prototyping earlier today and what we
sent<00:03:10.910> into<00:03:11.060> production<00:03:11.390> so<00:03:11.660> that<00:03:11.690> they<00:03:11.870> can

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:12.019 
sent into production so that they can

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:13.509 
sent into production so that they can
actually<00:03:12.290> do<00:03:12.380> what<00:03:12.530> we're<00:03:12.650> seeing<00:03:12.769> here<00:03:12.890> take

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:13.519 
actually do what we're seeing here take

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:15.039 
actually do what we're seeing here take
that<00:03:13.549> muffler<00:03:14.030> we<00:03:14.180> just<00:03:14.360> saw<00:03:14.480> built<00:03:14.780> on<00:03:14.930> that

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:15.049 
that muffler we just saw built on that

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:17.170 
that muffler we just saw built on that
machine<00:03:15.200> and<00:03:15.920> now<00:03:16.340> start<00:03:16.640> fitting<00:03:16.790> the<00:03:16.970> pipes

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
machine and now start fitting the pipes

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:18.400 
machine and now start fitting the pipes
to<00:03:17.360> it<00:03:17.420> to<00:03:17.510> get<00:03:17.569> the<00:03:17.690> finished<00:03:17.959> assemblies

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
to it to get the finished assemblies

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:20.110 
to it to get the finished assemblies
you'll<00:03:18.950> see<00:03:19.130> will<00:03:19.340> do<00:03:19.430> the<00:03:19.549> same<00:03:19.580> mandrel

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
you'll see will do the same mandrel

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.520 
you'll see will do the same mandrel
bending<00:03:20.360> just<00:03:20.540> like<00:03:20.630> we<00:03:20.750> did<00:03:20.840> in<00:03:20.959> prototyping

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
bending just like we did in prototyping

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:22.840 
bending just like we did in prototyping
but<00:03:21.709> here<00:03:21.860> we're<00:03:22.010> actually<00:03:22.160> gonna<00:03:22.340> fit<00:03:22.610> set

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:22.850 
but here we're actually gonna fit set

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:27.890 
but here we're actually gonna fit set
everything<00:03:23.180> up<00:03:23.239> for<00:03:23.420> finish<00:03:23.660> welding

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.089 

once<00:03:28.900> the<00:03:29.019> mandrel<00:03:29.319> bending<00:03:29.620> is<00:03:29.709> done<00:03:29.860> we

00:03:30.089 --> 00:03:30.099 
once the mandrel bending is done we

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:31.710 
once the mandrel bending is done we
actually<00:03:30.400> take<00:03:30.550> it<00:03:30.730> in<00:03:30.819> this<00:03:30.970> cell<00:03:31.209> and<00:03:31.629> it

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
actually take it in this cell and it

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.119 
actually take it in this cell and it
goes<00:03:31.870> through<00:03:31.900> its<00:03:32.140> trimming<00:03:32.470> operation<00:03:32.980> so

00:03:33.119 --> 00:03:33.129 
goes through its trimming operation so

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:34.259 
goes through its trimming operation so
we<00:03:33.220> can<00:03:33.310> cut<00:03:33.459> it<00:03:33.489> down<00:03:33.670> to<00:03:33.819> the<00:03:33.909> right<00:03:34.030> size<00:03:34.239> for

00:03:34.259 --> 00:03:34.269 
we can cut it down to the right size for

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:36.240 
we can cut it down to the right size for
the<00:03:34.480> fixture<00:03:34.930> and<00:03:35.110> then<00:03:35.530> actually<00:03:35.709> finish<00:03:36.069> off

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
the fixture and then actually finish off

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:37.740 
the fixture and then actually finish off
with<00:03:36.430> all<00:03:36.580> the<00:03:36.670> proper<00:03:36.970> informing<00:03:37.510> that<00:03:37.599> goes

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
with all the proper informing that goes

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.600 
with all the proper informing that goes
on<00:03:37.900> nice<00:03:38.500> you<00:03:38.739> can<00:03:38.860> keep<00:03:38.980> everything<00:03:39.250> within<00:03:39.489> a

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:39.610 
on nice you can keep everything within a

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:41.610 
on nice you can keep everything within a
good<00:03:39.790> working<00:03:40.000> still<00:03:40.390> right<00:03:40.720> in<00:03:40.750> here<00:03:41.349> we<00:03:41.470> can

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
good working still right in here we can

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.020 
good working still right in here we can
actually<00:03:41.739> work<00:03:42.069> with<00:03:42.099> much<00:03:42.430> smaller<00:03:42.580> build

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
actually work with much smaller build

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:44.670 
actually work with much smaller build
quantities<00:03:43.480> at<00:03:43.599> the<00:03:43.690> same<00:03:43.900> time<00:03:44.080> have<00:03:44.349> just<00:03:44.590> as

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
quantities at the same time have just as

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:45.930 
quantities at the same time have just as
many<00:03:44.769> finished<00:03:45.129> goods<00:03:45.280> come<00:03:45.519> out<00:03:45.610> the<00:03:45.730> door

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:45.940 
many finished goods come out the door

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:52.820 
many finished goods come out the door
all<00:03:46.120> finish

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:52.830 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:54.380 

and<00:03:53.280> this<00:03:53.430> is<00:03:53.550> where<00:03:53.640> everything<00:03:54.000> gets<00:03:54.090> stored

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
and this is where everything gets stored

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:56.600 
and this is where everything gets stored
look<00:03:54.930> at<00:03:55.050> our<00:03:55.110> footprint<00:03:55.620> multiply<00:03:56.130> it<00:03:56.190> by<00:03:56.310> how

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:56.610 
look at our footprint multiply it by how

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:58.250 
look at our footprint multiply it by how
many<00:03:56.670> racks<00:03:57.000> call<00:03:57.240> we<00:03:57.390> got<00:03:57.510> you<00:03:57.840> could<00:03:57.990> easily

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
many racks call we got you could easily

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:59.660 
many racks call we got you could easily
say<00:03:58.440> we're<00:03:58.650> close<00:03:58.920> to<00:03:59.070> half<00:03:59.250> a<00:03:59.340> million<00:03:59.520> square

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
say we're close to half a million square

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.690 
say we're close to half a million square
for<00:03:59.970> the<00:04:00.030> storage<00:04:00.300> wow<00:04:00.900> that's<00:04:01.710> a<00:04:01.890> lot<00:04:02.190> of<00:04:02.370> cool

Richard tell me what's going on with

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:16.539 
Richard tell me what's going on with
this<00:04:14.780> sort<00:04:15.020> of<00:04:15.050> Space<00:04:15.380> Ghost<00:04:15.650> power<00:04:16.010> band<00:04:16.400> I

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:16.549 
this sort of Space Ghost power band I

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:18.370 
this sort of Space Ghost power band I
mean<00:04:16.730> does<00:04:17.030> it<00:04:17.180> have<00:04:17.299> lasers<00:04:17.690> as<00:04:17.930> a<00:04:17.959> shoot<00:04:18.230> down

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:18.380 
mean does it have lasers as a shoot down

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:20.560 
mean does it have lasers as a shoot down
aircraft<00:04:18.650> I<00:04:19.190> mean<00:04:19.370> not<00:04:20.000> quite<00:04:20.239> it's<00:04:20.420> this

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:20.570 
aircraft I mean not quite it's this

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:22.180 
aircraft I mean not quite it's this
animal<00:04:20.900> we<00:04:20.989> got<00:04:21.140> right<00:04:21.320> here<00:04:21.350> basically<00:04:21.769> it

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.190 
animal we got right here basically it

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:24.370 
animal we got right here basically it
allows<00:04:22.280> you<00:04:22.550> to<00:04:22.670> scan<00:04:23.030> and<00:04:23.390> actually<00:04:23.750> see<00:04:24.080> what

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380 
allows you to scan and actually see what

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:25.750 
allows you to scan and actually see what
the<00:04:24.500> product<00:04:24.740> is<00:04:24.920> that<00:04:25.160> the<00:04:25.250> guys<00:04:25.400> are<00:04:25.610> picking

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:25.760 
the product is that the guys are picking

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.940 
the product is that the guys are picking
on<00:04:26.150> the<00:04:26.300> floor<00:04:26.600> as<00:04:26.990> to<00:04:27.320> what's<00:04:27.470> being<00:04:27.590> ordered

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:27.950 
on the floor as to what's being ordered

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:29.710 
on the floor as to what's being ordered
on<00:04:28.070> the<00:04:28.160> sheet<00:04:28.370> up<00:04:28.490> front<00:04:28.790> this<00:04:29.210> allows<00:04:29.450> us<00:04:29.600> to

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:29.720 
on the sheet up front this allows us to

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:30.910 
on the sheet up front this allows us to
control<00:04:29.870> and<00:04:30.230> make<00:04:30.320> sure<00:04:30.350> obviously<00:04:30.650> the

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:30.920 
control and make sure obviously the

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:31.990 
control and make sure obviously the
right<00:04:31.070> products<00:04:31.430> getting<00:04:31.640> down<00:04:31.760> the<00:04:31.880> right

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.000 
right products getting down the right

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.150 
right products getting down the right
lane<00:04:32.210> okay<00:04:32.750> so<00:04:32.810> it's<00:04:33.080> like<00:04:33.170> a<00:04:33.200> mainframe<00:04:33.500> brain
