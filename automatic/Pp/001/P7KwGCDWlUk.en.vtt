00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
going to look like to me riding the bike

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.490 
going to look like to me riding the bike
which<00:00:27.390> is<00:00:27.829> kind<00:00:28.829> of<00:00:28.859> important<00:00:30.169> now<00:00:31.169> when<00:00:31.349> we

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
which is kind of important now when we

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.460 
which is kind of important now when we
get<00:00:31.590> to<00:00:31.649> this<00:00:31.859> spot<00:00:32.510> you<00:00:33.510> have<00:00:33.750> a<00:00:33.780> gap<00:00:34.020> here

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:34.470 
get to this spot you have a gap here

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:36.079 
get to this spot you have a gap here
there's<00:00:34.800> two<00:00:35.040> ways<00:00:35.250> to<00:00:35.430> do<00:00:35.580> it<00:00:35.730> some<00:00:35.940> of<00:00:35.970> these

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:36.089 
there's two ways to do it some of these

00:00:36.089 --> 00:00:39.410 
there's two ways to do it some of these
tapes<00:00:36.390> come<00:00:36.629> with<00:00:36.949> with<00:00:37.949> a<00:00:37.980> little<00:00:38.420> sleeve

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
tapes come with with a little sleeve

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.660 
tapes come with with a little sleeve
it's<00:00:39.690> about<00:00:39.809> this<00:00:40.050> long<00:00:40.350> of<00:00:40.739> extra<00:00:41.339> tape<00:00:41.519> and

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
it's about this long of extra tape and

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.640 
it's about this long of extra tape and
you<00:00:41.730> can<00:00:41.760> tape<00:00:42.059> that<00:00:42.329> right<00:00:42.989> around<00:00:43.170> this<00:00:43.440> way

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:43.650 
you can tape that right around this way

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:45.259 
you can tape that right around this way
another<00:00:44.370> way<00:00:44.579> to<00:00:44.610> do<00:00:44.820> it<00:00:44.850> is<00:00:44.940> called<00:00:45.120> the

00:00:45.259 --> 00:00:45.269 
another way to do it is called the

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:46.310 
another way to do it is called the
figure<00:00:45.449> eight<00:00:45.750> and<00:00:45.870> that's<00:00:46.019> what<00:00:46.140> I'm<00:00:46.230> going

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
figure eight and that's what I'm going

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.240 
figure eight and that's what I'm going
to<00:00:46.379> show<00:00:46.589> you<00:00:46.650> here<00:00:47.010> so<00:00:47.940> you<00:00:47.970> want<00:00:48.210> to<00:00:48.269> leave

to show you here so you want to leave

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.520 
to show you here so you want to leave
going<00:00:50.250> to<00:00:50.309> leave<00:00:50.460> a<00:00:50.489> gap<00:00:50.760> here<00:00:51.149> between<00:00:51.530> the

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
going to leave a gap here between the

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.939 
going to leave a gap here between the
hood<00:00:53.480> and<00:00:54.480> your<00:00:54.660> tape<00:00:54.930> and<00:00:55.469> then<00:00:55.739> you're<00:00:55.859> going

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
to take your tape and go in through the

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:04.880 
to take your tape and go in through the
bars<00:00:59.359> come<00:01:00.359> over<00:01:01.050> the<00:01:01.469> hood<00:01:03.110> just<00:01:04.110> over<00:01:04.679> enough

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
bars come over the hood just over enough

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.230 
bars come over the hood just over enough
kind<00:01:05.129> of<00:01:05.220> halfway<00:01:05.369> on<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.670> hood<00:01:05.820> halfway<00:01:06.179> on

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
kind of halfway on the hood halfway on

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.740 
kind of halfway on the hood halfway on
the<00:01:06.330> bar<00:01:06.950> you're<00:01:07.950> going<00:01:08.039> to<00:01:08.130> come<00:01:08.340> back

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750 
the bar you're going to come back

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:14.330 
the bar you're going to come back
through<00:01:10.550> come<00:01:11.550> back<00:01:11.700> around<00:01:13.070> you<00:01:14.070> can<00:01:14.160> see

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
through come back around you can see

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.400 
through come back around you can see
that<00:01:14.520> covers<00:01:14.850> up<00:01:15.090> I'm<00:01:15.929> going<00:01:16.050> to<00:01:16.140> try<00:01:16.259> and<00:01:16.350> get

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:16.410 
that covers up I'm going to try and get

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:18.529 
that covers up I'm going to try and get
up<00:01:16.560> high<00:01:16.800> so<00:01:17.160> we<00:01:17.280> cover<00:01:17.520> up<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.820> handlebar

00:01:18.529 --> 00:01:18.539 
up high so we cover up the handlebar

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:20.630 
up high so we cover up the handlebar
here<00:01:18.810> just<00:01:19.560> in<00:01:19.649> case<00:01:19.679> the<00:01:19.979> hood<00:01:20.130> doesn't<00:01:20.460> cover

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
here just in case the hood doesn't cover

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:28.190 
here just in case the hood doesn't cover
it<00:01:20.789> all<00:01:24.200> pull<00:01:25.200> it<00:01:25.290> tight<00:01:25.500> and<00:01:26.420> then<00:01:27.420> resume<00:01:27.990> our

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
it all pull it tight and then resume our

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.569 
it all pull it tight and then resume our
halfway<00:01:28.500> point<00:01:29.900> you<00:01:30.900> can<00:01:31.049> see<00:01:31.259> that<00:01:31.470> our<00:01:31.619> logo

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
halfway point you can see that our logo

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.760 
halfway point you can see that our logo
remains<00:01:33.090> on<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.450> outside<00:01:33.899> which<00:01:34.320> is<00:01:34.350> what<00:01:34.560> we

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
remains on the outside which is what we

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:56.690 
remains on the outside which is what we
want<00:01:35.689> and<00:01:36.689> then<00:01:37.140> we<00:01:37.290> just<00:01:37.500> keep<00:01:37.740> going

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.850 

when<00:01:57.700> you<00:01:57.790> get<00:01:57.940> to<00:01:58.090> the<00:01:58.210> bend

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
when you get to the bend

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.850 
when you get to the bend
you<00:01:59.860> have<00:02:00.070> to<00:02:00.160> fudge<00:02:00.430> a<00:02:00.460> little<00:02:00.820> bit<00:02:01.000> because

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
you have to fudge a little bit because

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.260 
you have to fudge a little bit because
trying<00:02:02.860> to<00:02:02.920> keep<00:02:03.100> an<00:02:03.250> even<00:02:03.460> distance<00:02:03.910> isn't

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
trying to keep an even distance isn't

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:05.430 
trying to keep an even distance isn't
going<00:02:04.420> to<00:02:04.479> work<00:02:04.690> so<00:02:04.750> we'll<00:02:05.110> go<00:02:05.229> a<00:02:05.260> little

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.440 
going to work so we'll go a little

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.890 
going to work so we'll go a little
closer<00:02:06.090> make<00:02:07.090> this<00:02:07.240> distance<00:02:07.630> a<00:02:07.690> little

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:07.900 
closer make this distance a little

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:12.900 
closer make this distance a little
smaller<00:02:08.259> and<00:02:09.270> then<00:02:10.270> spread<00:02:10.690> it<00:02:10.810> out<00:02:11.730> as<00:02:12.730> we<00:02:12.880> go

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
smaller and then spread it out as we go

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:39.770 
smaller and then spread it out as we go
around

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.420 

now<00:02:40.780> we're<00:02:41.230> on<00:02:41.290> the<00:02:41.409> flat<00:02:41.650> again<00:02:41.980> so<00:02:42.159> we<00:02:42.280> can

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
now we're on the flat again so we can

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.429 
now we're on the flat again so we can
resume<00:02:45.030> soon<00:02:46.030> as<00:02:46.209> we<00:02:46.359> before<00:02:46.780> give<00:02:47.170> it<00:02:47.260> about

00:02:47.429 --> 00:02:47.439 
resume soon as we before give it about

00:02:47.439 --> 00:02:57.339 
resume soon as we before give it about
half<00:02:47.680> the<00:02:47.890> tape<00:02:48.129> showing

00:02:57.339 --> 00:02:57.349 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:01.030

tape<00:03:26.209> out<00:03:26.419> like<00:03:26.599> this<00:03:27.219> and<00:03:28.219> kind<00:03:28.879> of<00:03:29.030> try<00:03:30.310> what

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
tape out like this and kind of try what

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.490 
tape out like this and kind of try what
you<00:03:31.430> want<00:03:31.609> to<00:03:31.700> do<00:03:31.819> is<00:03:32.000> is<00:03:32.239> sight<00:03:32.719> down<00:03:32.959> you<00:03:33.290> want

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 
you want to do is is sight down you want

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:34.899 
you want to do is is sight down you want
this<00:03:33.650> to<00:03:33.829> be<00:03:33.980> even<00:03:34.189> so<00:03:34.519> you're<00:03:34.609> gonna<00:03:34.700> have<00:03:34.849> to

00:03:34.899 --> 00:03:34.909 
this to be even so you're gonna have to

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:36.670 
this to be even so you're gonna have to
cut<00:03:35.180> your<00:03:35.329> tape<00:03:35.599> and<00:03:35.900> in<00:03:36.139> such<00:03:36.349> a<00:03:36.379> way<00:03:36.650> that

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
cut your tape and in such a way that

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.860 
cut your tape and in such a way that
when<00:03:37.010> you<00:03:37.099> wrap<00:03:37.370> it<00:03:37.549> over<00:03:37.669> it's<00:03:38.389> going<00:03:38.599> to<00:03:38.659> make

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
when you wrap it over it's going to make

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.610 
when you wrap it over it's going to make
a<00:03:38.900> perpendicular<00:03:39.859> line<00:03:40.489> to<00:03:40.730> your<00:03:40.849> stammer<00:03:41.620> to

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
a perpendicular line to your stammer to

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:49.000 
a perpendicular line to your stammer to
your<00:03:42.739> handlebars<00:03:44.530> so<00:03:47.560> doing<00:03:48.560> this<00:03:48.650> backwards

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
your handlebars so doing this backwards

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:59.379 
your handlebars so doing this backwards
like<00:03:49.879> this<00:03:51.159> just<00:03:52.159> go<00:03:52.370> right<00:03:52.579> there<00:03:58.180> we<00:03:59.180> want<00:03:59.359> to

00:03:59.379 --> 00:03:59.389 
like this just go right there we want to

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:01.780 
like this just go right there we want to
end<00:03:59.599> the<00:03:59.689> cut<00:04:00.049> underneath<00:04:00.949> the<00:04:01.340> bar<00:04:01.549> so<00:04:01.759> that

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:01.790 
end the cut underneath the bar so that

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:14.900 
end the cut underneath the bar so that
duct<00:04:02.060> part<00:04:02.299> doesn't<00:04:02.569> show<00:04:06.189> cut<00:04:07.189> that<00:04:07.370> off

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:21.949 

and<00:04:15.360> then<00:04:15.480> when<00:04:15.630> we<00:04:15.750> fold<00:04:15.990> it<00:04:16.140> over<00:04:20.780> it's<00:04:21.780> not

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 
and then when we fold it over it's not

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:26.540 
and then when we fold it over it's not
the<00:04:22.110> best<00:04:22.800> we're<00:04:23.430> done<00:04:24.950> when<00:04:25.950> I<00:04:25.980> redo<00:04:26.340> that

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
the best we're done when I redo that

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.930 
the best we're done when I redo that
because<00:04:26.730> that<00:04:26.880> looks<00:04:27.030> kind<00:04:27.210> of<00:04:27.270> ugly<00:04:28.760> I'm<00:04:29.760> just

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 
because that looks kind of ugly I'm just

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.260 
because that looks kind of ugly I'm just
going<00:04:30.060> to<00:04:30.120> come<00:04:30.330> like<00:04:30.480> this<00:04:31.730> move<00:04:32.730> in<00:04:32.910> just<00:04:33.000> a

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270 
going to come like this move in just a

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:48.550 
going to come like this move in just a
little<00:04:33.300> bit

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:48.560 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:53.070 

there<00:04:49.220> we<00:04:49.310> go

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:05:00.790 

now<00:04:54.080> I<00:04:54.110> take<00:04:54.470> that<00:04:59.230> put<00:05:00.230> it<00:05:00.320> right<00:05:00.470> over<00:05:00.680> the

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:00.800 
now I take that put it right over the

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:14.460 
now I take that put it right over the
top<00:05:02.170> grab<00:05:03.170> our<00:05:03.320> electoral<00:05:03.740> tape

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:14.470 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:17.760 

yeah<00:05:15.420> we're<00:05:16.420> going<00:05:16.510> to<00:05:16.570> wrap<00:05:16.900> the<00:05:17.380> electrical

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:17.770 
yeah we're going to wrap the electrical

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:18.930 
yeah we're going to wrap the electrical
tape<00:05:17.950> around<00:05:17.980> in<00:05:18.370> the<00:05:18.460> same<00:05:18.670> way<00:05:18.790> we've<00:05:18.910> been

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:18.940 
tape around in the same way we've been

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:20.970 
tape around in the same way we've been
wrapping<00:05:19.300> the<00:05:19.390> bars<00:05:19.600> around<00:05:19.810> we<00:05:20.740> want<00:05:20.920> to

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:20.980 
wrapping the bars around we want to

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:23.010 
wrapping the bars around we want to
start<00:05:21.250> underneath<00:05:21.670> so<00:05:22.150> that<00:05:22.330> you<00:05:22.420> don't<00:05:22.630> see

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:23.020 
start underneath so that you don't see

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:28.740 
start underneath so that you don't see
the<00:05:25.410> see<00:05:26.410> the<00:05:26.560> start<00:05:27.390> hold<00:05:28.390> it<00:05:28.480> with<00:05:28.600> one

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:28.750 
the see the start hold it with one

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:31.800 
the see the start hold it with one
finger<00:05:30.000> try<00:05:31.000> to<00:05:31.060> get<00:05:31.180> my<00:05:31.270> fingers<00:05:31.330> out<00:05:31.690> of<00:05:31.750> the

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:31.810 
finger try to get my fingers out of the

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:34.770 
finger try to get my fingers out of the
way<00:05:31.960> so<00:05:32.020> you<00:05:32.110> guys<00:05:32.290> can<00:05:32.500> see<00:05:32.770> and<00:05:33.600> wrap<00:05:34.600> it

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:34.780 
way so you guys can see and wrap it

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:37.260 
way so you guys can see and wrap it
around<00:05:35.010> fairly<00:05:36.010> tightly<00:05:36.250> not<00:05:36.610> too<00:05:36.790> tight<00:05:37.030> and

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:37.270 
around fairly tightly not too tight and

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:39.810 
around fairly tightly not too tight and
the<00:05:38.200> one<00:05:38.650> of<00:05:38.740> the<00:05:38.800> misconceptions<00:05:38.950> is<00:05:39.610> that

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:39.820 
the one of the misconceptions is that

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:43.650 
the one of the misconceptions is that
you<00:05:40.720> need<00:05:40.900> to<00:05:41.050> wrap<00:05:41.290> the<00:05:41.620> bar<00:05:42.270> wrap<00:05:43.270> the<00:05:43.420> tape

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:43.660 
you need to wrap the bar wrap the tape

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:48.900 
you need to wrap the bar wrap the tape
to<00:05:43.990> the<00:05:44.020> bar<00:05:45.030> but<00:05:46.030> actually<00:05:46.480> the<00:05:47.140> friction<00:05:47.910> gel

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:48.910 
to the bar but actually the friction gel

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:50.550 
to the bar but actually the friction gel
coating<00:05:49.330> on<00:05:49.420> the<00:05:49.510> inside<00:05:49.540> of<00:05:49.930> the<00:05:50.140> bar<00:05:50.320> tape

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:50.560 
coating on the inside of the bar tape

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:52.590 
coating on the inside of the bar tape
will<00:05:50.770> actually<00:05:51.100> keep<00:05:51.340> the<00:05:51.880> tape<00:05:52.090> from<00:05:52.240> moving

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:52.600 
will actually keep the tape from moving

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:57.840 
will actually keep the tape from moving
so<00:05:52.810> if<00:05:53.140> all<00:05:53.980> we<00:05:54.250> have<00:05:54.400> to<00:05:54.550> do<00:05:54.760> is<00:05:55.270> wrap<00:05:56.850> this

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:57.850 
so if all we have to do is wrap this

00:05:57.850 --> 00:05:59.670 
so if all we have to do is wrap this
electrical<00:05:58.390> tape<00:05:58.630> around<00:05:58.960> the<00:05:59.080> bar<00:05:59.380> tape

00:05:59.670 --> 00:05:59.680 
electrical tape around the bar tape

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:01.290 
electrical tape around the bar tape
doesn't<00:06:00.280> actually<00:06:00.400> ever<00:06:00.610> need<00:06:00.880> to<00:06:01.030> come<00:06:01.210> in

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:01.300 
doesn't actually ever need to come in

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:03.810 
doesn't actually ever need to come in
contact<00:06:01.480> with<00:06:01.870> the<00:06:01.990> handle<00:06:02.350> bar<00:06:02.500> and<00:06:02.770> our<00:06:03.640> tape

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:03.820 
contact with the handle bar and our tape

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:07.830 
contact with the handle bar and our tape
will<00:06:04.000> stay<00:06:04.180> put<00:06:04.420> for<00:06:04.750> a<00:06:04.960> long<00:06:05.290> time<00:06:06.600> so<00:06:07.600> I'm

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:07.840 
will stay put for a long time so I'm

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:09.450 
will stay put for a long time so I'm
coming<00:06:08.140> around<00:06:08.350> here<00:06:08.650> I'm<00:06:08.890> keeping<00:06:09.220> it<00:06:09.310> really

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:09.460 
coming around here I'm keeping it really

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:15.090 
coming around here I'm keeping it really
uniformed<00:06:10.120> so<00:06:10.270> it<00:06:10.360> looks<00:06:10.510> real<00:06:10.720> nice<00:06:13.920> go<00:06:14.920> one

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:15.100 
uniformed so it looks real nice go one

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:22.950 
uniformed so it looks real nice go one
more<00:06:15.250> time<00:06:15.310> around<00:06:21.210> now<00:06:22.210> I'm<00:06:22.360> going<00:06:22.480> to<00:06:22.540> cut<00:06:22.810> it

00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:22.960 
more time around now I'm going to cut it

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:25.440 
more time around now I'm going to cut it
so<00:06:23.140> that<00:06:23.919> it<00:06:24.190> ends<00:06:24.370> underneath<00:06:24.790> also<00:06:25.270> because

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:25.450 
so that it ends underneath also because

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:28.080 
so that it ends underneath also because
we<00:06:25.570> don't<00:06:25.690> want<00:06:25.810> anybody<00:06:25.960> to<00:06:26.140> see<00:06:26.290> that<00:06:27.090> right

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:28.090 
we don't want anybody to see that right

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:36.270 
we don't want anybody to see that right
there<00:06:29.460> fold<00:06:30.460> that<00:06:30.730> under

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:36.280 

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:40.740 

pull<00:06:37.000> this<00:06:37.120> stuff<00:06:37.390> off<00:06:37.570> a<00:06:39.390> little<00:06:40.390> dent<00:06:40.600> will

00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:40.750 
pull this stuff off a little dent will

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:46.440 
pull this stuff off a little dent will
resolve<00:06:41.290> itself<00:06:41.440> and<00:06:42.010> whoops<00:06:42.730> wallah<00:06:45.450> let's

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:46.450 
resolve itself and whoops wallah let's

00:06:46.450 --> 00:07:00.000 
resolve itself and whoops wallah let's
