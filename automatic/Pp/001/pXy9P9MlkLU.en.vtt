00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
people I've talked to about this say

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.350 
people I've talked to about this say
well<00:00:40.350> isn't<00:00:40.649> that<00:00:40.680> isn't<00:00:41.489> it<00:00:41.640> great<00:00:41.850> if<00:00:42.120> the

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
well isn't that isn't it great if the

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.869 
well isn't that isn't it great if the
birth<00:00:42.690> rate<00:00:42.870> is<00:00:43.020> going<00:00:43.140> down<00:00:43.290> because<00:00:43.920> after

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
birth rate is going down because after

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.470 
birth rate is going down because after
all<00:00:44.910> that's<00:00:45.300> a<00:00:45.420> fewer<00:00:45.899> carbon<00:00:46.590> footprints<00:00:47.250> and

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:47.480 
all that's a fewer carbon footprints and

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.560 
all that's a fewer carbon footprints and

less stress on mother earth not thinking
about<00:00:51.870> that<00:00:52.530> how<00:00:53.340> much<00:00:53.520> their<00:00:54.000> own<00:00:54.210> care<00:00:54.539> is

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
about that how much their own care is

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.290 
about that how much their own care is
going<00:00:55.079> to<00:00:55.170> cost<00:00:55.379> when<00:00:55.770> they<00:00:55.920> get<00:00:56.129> older<00:00:56.550> in<00:00:57.120> the

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
going to cost when they get older in the

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.299 
going to cost when they get older in the

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.090 
problems and right now the framing is
very<00:01:19.650> much<00:01:19.890> about<00:01:20.250> global<00:01:21.210> warming<00:01:21.240> and

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
very much about global warming and

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.219 
very much about global warming and

of<00:01:25.350> thing<00:01:25.409> and<00:01:25.740> I<00:01:25.799> don't<00:01:26.009> mean<00:01:26.159> to<00:01:26.310> say<00:01:26.490> that

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
of thing and I don't mean to say that

of thing and I don't mean to say that
those<00:01:26.880> things<00:01:27.150> don't<00:01:27.450> matter<00:01:27.780> but<00:01:28.619> that

those things don't matter but that
doesn't<00:01:29.189> mean<00:01:29.549> that<00:01:29.579> other<00:01:29.820> things<00:01:30.180> don't

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
doesn't mean that other things don't

and economic problems that are also

and economic problems that are also
related<00:01:36.540> it<00:01:36.930> related<00:01:37.350> to<00:01:37.380> population<00:01:38.250> decline

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
related it related to population decline

related it related to population decline
what<00:01:39.780> we<00:01:40.020> find<00:01:41.509> is<00:01:42.509> that<00:01:42.649> you<00:01:43.649> globally

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
what we find is that you globally

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.510 
what we find is that you globally
actually<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.479> number<00:01:45.680> households<00:01:46.680> has<00:01:47.220> been

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
actually the number households has been

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.490 
actually the number households has been
increased<00:01:47.970> much<00:01:48.270> faster<00:01:48.869> than<00:01:49.049> number<00:01:49.439> of

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
increased much faster than number of

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.100 
increased much faster than number of
people

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.440 

divorce<00:01:54.110> creates<00:01:54.830> more<00:01:55.100> household<00:01:55.790> you<00:01:56.210> would

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
divorce creates more household you would

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.590 
divorce creates more household you would
use<00:01:56.780> more<00:01:57.200> resources<00:01:58.010> and<00:01:58.340> in<00:01:59.300> the<00:01:59.420> meantime

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
use more resources and in the meantime

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.830 
use more resources and in the meantime
you<00:02:00.170> also<00:02:00.470> create<00:02:00.740> more<00:02:01.040> greenhouse<00:02:01.640> gases<00:02:02.090> if

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
you also create more greenhouse gases if

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.430 
you also create more greenhouse gases if
they<00:02:03.580> efficiency<00:02:04.580> of<00:02:04.760> resource<00:02:05.600> use<00:02:05.930> in

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:06.440 
they efficiency of resource use in

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.950 
they efficiency of resource use in
divorced<00:02:07.100> household<00:02:07.700> is<00:02:07.910> the<00:02:08.390> same<00:02:08.660> as

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:08.960 
divorced household is the same as

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:13.200 
divorced household is the same as
married<00:02:09.619> a<00:02:09.680> household<00:02:10.160> then<00:02:10.790> in<00:02:11.530> 2005<00:02:12.530> alone

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
married a household then in 2005 alone

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:19.870 
married a household then in 2005 alone
us<00:02:14.210> could<00:02:14.570> save<00:02:15.970> 73<00:02:16.970> billion<00:02:18.010> kilowatt<00:02:19.010> hour
