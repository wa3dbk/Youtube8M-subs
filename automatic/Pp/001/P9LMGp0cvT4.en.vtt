00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:15.500
What does "Security" mean to you?

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:19.500
It's the protection of your loved ones, your wife and children?

00:00:20.404 --> 00:00:22.404
Or it's the protection of your home?

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.760
Maybe it's the protection of your neighbours and your parents?

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.545
Or it's the protection of yourself?

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.010
The Mercenaries Corp., thinking about all of you.

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.180
And not only you,

00:00:38.488 --> 00:00:44.000
but also your neighbours around you and all citizens of the United States.

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:51.220
We aren't monsters who want to fight.

00:00:52.436 --> 00:00:56.720
We are who we are - veterans of our business.

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.100
Your shield against bullets and arrows,

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.670
your cane that supports you,

00:01:11.421 --> 00:01:13.910
your roof over your head in the rain.

00:01:35.512 --> 00:01:37.512
We are your personal army.

00:01:37.848 --> 00:01:41.210
We are the Mercenaries Corp., your safety.

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.970
Of course if you are not our target...
