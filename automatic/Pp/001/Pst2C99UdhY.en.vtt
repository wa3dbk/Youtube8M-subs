it's quite a bit bigger um the reason
it's<00:00:37.940> so<00:00:38.059> much<00:00:38.210> bigger<00:00:38.359> is<00:00:38.690> because<00:00:38.839> it<00:00:39.140> took

00:00:39.279 --> 00:00:39.289 
it's so much bigger is because it took

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:40.660 
it's so much bigger is because it took
place<00:00:39.410> in<00:00:39.500> the<00:00:39.710> Toronto<00:00:40.010> Sky<00:00:40.219> Dome<00:00:40.280> so<00:00:40.550> that's

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:40.670 
place in the Toronto Sky Dome so that's

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.209 
place in the Toronto Sky Dome so that's
an<00:00:40.789> indoor<00:00:41.120> baseball<00:00:41.300> stadium<00:00:41.989> and<00:00:42.109> it's<00:00:42.859> just

00:00:43.209 --> 00:00:43.219 
an indoor baseball stadium and it's just

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:45.610 
an indoor baseball stadium and it's just
absolutely<00:00:43.850> massive<00:00:44.120> but<00:00:44.870> here<00:00:45.140> we<00:00:45.260> go<00:00:45.410> guys

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 
absolutely massive but here we go guys

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.169 
absolutely massive but here we go guys
this<00:00:45.949> is<00:00:46.129> what<00:00:46.280> the<00:00:46.399> inside<00:00:46.789> of<00:00:46.940> the<00:00:46.999> arena

00:00:47.169 --> 00:00:47.179 
this is what the inside of the arena

00:00:47.179 --> 00:00:49.419 
this is what the inside of the arena
looks<00:00:47.420> like<00:00:47.659> it's<00:00:48.170> pretty<00:00:48.499> big<00:00:48.800> honestly<00:00:49.399> I

00:00:49.419 --> 00:00:49.429 
looks like it's pretty big honestly I

00:00:49.429 --> 00:00:50.950 
looks like it's pretty big honestly I
mean<00:00:49.579> I<00:00:49.820> personally<00:00:49.879> think<00:00:50.539> this<00:00:50.659> is<00:00:50.809> probably

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:50.960 
mean I personally think this is probably

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.290 
mean I personally think this is probably
the<00:00:51.199> best<00:00:51.320> arena<00:00:51.559> I've<00:00:51.769> done<00:00:51.920> so<00:00:52.159> far<00:00:52.190> I<00:00:52.579> know

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:53.300 
the best arena I've done so far I know

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:54.489 
the best arena I've done so far I know
that<00:00:53.570> there's<00:00:53.719> gonna<00:00:53.839> be<00:00:53.960> a<00:00:53.989> lot<00:00:54.109> bigger<00:00:54.319> and

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:54.499 
that there's gonna be a lot bigger and

00:00:54.499 --> 00:00:55.779 
that there's gonna be a lot bigger and
better<00:00:54.589> things<00:00:54.710> to<00:00:55.069> come<00:00:55.280> but<00:00:55.460> overall<00:00:55.760> I

00:00:55.779 --> 00:00:55.789 
better things to come but overall I

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:57.220 
better things to come but overall I
think<00:00:56.120> this<00:00:56.239> one<00:00:56.390> turned<00:00:56.600> out<00:00:56.749> pretty<00:00:56.870> sweet

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:57.230 
think this one turned out pretty sweet

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:58.930 
think this one turned out pretty sweet
so<00:00:57.769> there's<00:00:57.949> you<00:00:58.190> got<00:00:58.339> to<00:00:58.460> kind<00:00:58.609> of<00:00:58.670> see<00:00:58.819> what

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
so there's you got to kind of see what

00:00:58.940 --> 00:00:59.919 
so there's you got to kind of see what
it<00:00:58.999> would<00:00:59.059> look<00:00:59.149> like<00:00:59.210> if<00:00:59.420> you<00:00:59.480> walked<00:00:59.719> out<00:00:59.870> of

00:00:59.919 --> 00:00:59.929 
it would look like if you walked out of

00:00:59.929 --> 00:01:02.049 
it would look like if you walked out of
the<00:01:00.170> entrance<00:01:00.530> the<00:01:00.679> entrance<00:01:01.010> area<00:01:01.699> is<00:01:01.850> just

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:02.059 
the entrance the entrance area is just

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:03.729 
the entrance the entrance area is just
it<00:01:02.179> was<00:01:02.300> super<00:01:02.600> boring<00:01:02.839> you<00:01:03.140> know<00:01:03.260> that's<00:01:03.559> kind

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:03.739 
it was super boring you know that's kind

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:06.100 
it was super boring you know that's kind
of<00:01:03.800> how<00:01:03.890> these<00:01:04.070> all<00:01:04.339> are<00:01:04.600> but<00:01:05.600> overall<00:01:05.840> here's

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.110 
of how these all are but overall here's

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:07.180 
of how these all are but overall here's
where<00:01:06.260> they<00:01:06.350> started<00:01:06.710> getting<00:01:06.800> into<00:01:07.040> better

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:07.190 
where they started getting into better

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:09.040 
where they started getting into better
technology<00:01:07.790> because<00:01:08.240> what<00:01:08.420> this<00:01:08.540> is<00:01:08.720> this<00:01:08.930> is

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:09.050 
technology because what this is this is

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:10.630 
technology because what this is this is
a<00:01:09.110> giant<00:01:09.410> titantron<00:01:09.710> that<00:01:10.100> was<00:01:10.220> up<00:01:10.400> um

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640 
a giant titantron that was up um

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.910 
a giant titantron that was up um
basically<00:01:11.600> just<00:01:11.930> like<00:01:12.020> a<00:01:12.050> big<00:01:12.290> I<00:01:12.500> think<00:01:12.740> it<00:01:12.800> was

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:12.920 
basically just like a big I think it was

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.190 
basically just like a big I think it was
better<00:01:13.070> than<00:01:13.250> just<00:01:13.460> a<00:01:13.550> like<00:01:13.820> a<00:01:13.910> sheet<00:01:14.240> but

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
better than just a like a sheet but

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.690 
better than just a like a sheet but
overall<00:01:15.470> yeah<00:01:15.650> it<00:01:15.740> was<00:01:15.830> a<00:01:15.860> big<00:01:16.100> screen<00:01:16.490> that

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700 
overall yeah it was a big screen that

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.220 
overall yeah it was a big screen that
was<00:01:17.090> showing<00:01:17.450> the<00:01:17.570> event<00:01:17.810> while<00:01:17.930> it<00:01:18.080> was<00:01:18.200> going

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:18.230 
was showing the event while it was going

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:20.650 
was showing the event while it was going
on<00:01:18.560> so<00:01:19.130> I<00:01:19.160> mean<00:01:19.370> that<00:01:19.670> you<00:01:20.210> can<00:01:20.330> definitely

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:20.660 
on so I mean that you can definitely

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:21.610 
on so I mean that you can definitely
tell<00:01:20.780> that<00:01:20.930> now<00:01:21.080> they're<00:01:21.260> starting<00:01:21.350> to<00:01:21.530> get

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:21.620 
tell that now they're starting to get

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:23.080 
tell that now they're starting to get
into<00:01:21.800> some<00:01:21.860> better<00:01:22.100> technology<00:01:22.670> and<00:01:22.910> once

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
into some better technology and once

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:24.040 
into some better technology and once
they<00:01:23.270> start<00:01:23.480> getting<00:01:23.690> into<00:01:23.810> the<00:01:23.900> better

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:24.050 
they start getting into the better

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:25.900 
they start getting into the better
technology<00:01:24.380> though<00:01:24.770> that's<00:01:25.220> you<00:01:25.670> know<00:01:25.760> those

technology though that's you know those
are<00:01:26.060> things<00:01:26.240> that<00:01:26.330> I<00:01:26.540> can<00:01:26.750> build<00:01:26.960> that<00:01:27.440> just

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
are things that I can build that just

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.380 
are things that I can build that just
make<00:01:27.890> everything<00:01:28.160> just<00:01:28.310> look<00:01:28.670> a<00:01:28.910> hundred

know absolutely awesome and here's where
they<00:01:36.410> started<00:01:36.680> breaking<00:01:37.040> you<00:01:37.460> know<00:01:37.580> where

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:37.730 
they started breaking you know where

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:39.220 
they started breaking you know where
they<00:01:37.790> do<00:01:37.910> the<00:01:38.030> lighting<00:01:38.360> fixtures<00:01:38.690> up<00:01:38.900> above

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:39.230 
they do the lighting fixtures up above

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:41.590 
they do the lighting fixtures up above
the<00:01:40.160> ring<00:01:40.370> this<00:01:40.850> is<00:01:40.910> where<00:01:41.180> they<00:01:41.240> started<00:01:41.540> to

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
the ring this is where they started to

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.690 
the ring this is where they started to
do<00:01:41.780> more<00:01:41.990> things<00:01:42.260> with<00:01:42.470> instead<00:01:43.400> of<00:01:43.460> doing

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:11.359 
so that light like lighting fixtures can

00:02:11.359 --> 00:02:13.000 
so that light like lighting fixtures can
be<00:02:11.450> hung<00:02:11.629> and<00:02:11.810> stuff<00:02:11.989> and<00:02:12.200> that's<00:02:12.709> what<00:02:12.890> this

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
I didn't realize that this was gonna be

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.540 
I didn't realize that this was gonna be
so<00:02:35.780> big<00:02:36.110> but<00:02:36.560> as<00:02:36.709> you<00:02:36.860> can<00:02:36.980> see<00:02:37.160> I<00:02:37.190> mean<00:02:37.400> this

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
so big but as you can see I mean this

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:40.030 
so big but as you can see I mean this

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
arena is absolutely gigantic I think

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.199 
arena is absolutely gigantic I think
it's<00:02:40.160> the<00:02:40.250> biggest<00:02:40.550> one<00:02:40.670> I've<00:02:40.790> made<00:02:41.000> it's

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209
