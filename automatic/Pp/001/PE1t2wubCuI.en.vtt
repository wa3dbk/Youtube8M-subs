00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:53.080 
right here you just see me running up
here<00:03:50.959> and<00:03:51.170> I'm<00:03:51.799> just<00:03:52.069> exploring<00:03:52.489> and<00:03:52.879> one

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 
here and I'm just exploring and one

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:56.349 
here and I'm just exploring and one
while<00:03:53.659> wandering<00:03:54.819> seeing<00:03:55.819> where<00:03:55.939> I<00:03:55.970> can<00:03:56.209> go

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:56.359 
while wandering seeing where I can go

00:03:56.359 --> 00:03:59.259 
while wandering seeing where I can go
and<00:03:56.389> then<00:03:56.840> I<00:03:57.230> remember<00:03:57.829> because<00:03:58.760> I've<00:03:59.030> gotten

00:03:59.259 --> 00:03:59.269 
and then I remember because I've gotten

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:00.879 
and then I remember because I've gotten
out<00:03:59.359> of<00:03:59.389> the<00:03:59.569> outside<00:04:00.200> of<00:04:00.379> the<00:04:00.439> map<00:04:00.590> on<00:04:00.739> this

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:00.889 
out of the outside of the map on this

00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:03.910 
out of the outside of the map on this
map<00:04:01.099> before<00:04:01.250> and<00:04:02.109> there's<00:04:03.109> one<00:04:03.290> spot<00:04:03.620> where

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:03.920 
map before and there's one spot where

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:05.619 
map before and there's one spot where
you<00:04:04.189> can't<00:04:04.430> be<00:04:04.579> hit<00:04:04.790> and<00:04:04.819> you<00:04:05.090> can<00:04:05.239> still<00:04:05.480> pick

00:04:05.619 --> 00:04:05.629 
you can't be hit and you can still pick

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:09.520 
you can't be hit and you can still pick
up<00:04:05.750> the<00:04:05.870> power-ups<00:04:06.349> and<00:04:07.900> yeah<00:04:08.900> I'm<00:04:09.169> gonna<00:04:09.409> head

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
up the power-ups and yeah I'm gonna head

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:12.460 
up the power-ups and yeah I'm gonna head
to<00:04:09.709> that<00:04:09.889> spot<00:04:10.220> and<00:04:10.459> a<00:04:11.389> little<00:04:11.569> bit<00:04:11.720> right<00:04:12.439> now

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:12.470 
to that spot and a little bit right now

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:14.890 
to that spot and a little bit right now
you<00:04:12.650> just<00:04:13.040> kind<00:04:13.250> of<00:04:13.310> watch<00:04:13.939> me<00:04:14.180> explore<00:04:14.569> it's

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900 
you just kind of watch me explore it's

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.199 
you just kind of watch me explore it's
like<00:04:15.079> interesting<00:04:15.290> oh<00:04:15.799> and<00:04:16.459> call<00:04:16.699> duty<00:04:16.940> world

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:17.209 
like interesting oh and call duty world

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:18.580 
like interesting oh and call duty world
at<00:04:17.299> war<00:04:17.359> you<00:04:17.599> could<00:04:17.690> also<00:04:17.900> jump<00:04:18.289> out<00:04:18.410> of<00:04:18.440> the

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
at war you could also jump out of the

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:21.909 
at war you could also jump out of the
map<00:04:18.739> but<00:04:18.949> it<00:04:19.099> always<00:04:19.280> lagged<00:04:20.169> badly<00:04:21.169> like

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:21.919 
map but it always lagged badly like

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:25.570 
map but it always lagged badly like
really<00:04:22.490> bad<00:04:22.699> lag<00:04:23.090> was<00:04:23.360> horrible<00:04:24.430> whenever<00:04:25.430> you

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:25.580 
really bad lag was horrible whenever you

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:27.120 
really bad lag was horrible whenever you
jumped<00:04:25.880> outside<00:04:26.000> because<00:04:26.360> all<00:04:26.720> the<00:04:26.900> zombies

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
jumped outside because all the zombies

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:31.029 
jumped outside because all the zombies
could<00:04:28.130> lag<00:04:28.699> outside<00:04:29.330> of<00:04:29.479> the<00:04:29.599> map<00:04:29.780> or<00:04:30.710> like

00:04:31.029 --> 00:04:31.039 
could lag outside of the map or like

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:33.040 
could lag outside of the map or like
okay<00:04:31.340> the<00:04:31.699> zombies<00:04:32.060> naturally<00:04:32.510> go<00:04:32.659> into<00:04:32.960> the

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.050 
okay the zombies naturally go into the

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:35.560 
okay the zombies naturally go into the
map<00:04:33.199> but<00:04:33.770> after<00:04:33.889> they<00:04:34.130> go<00:04:34.280> in<00:04:34.490> they<00:04:35.090> come<00:04:35.360> back

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:35.570 
map but after they go in they come back

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:38.080 
map but after they go in they come back
out<00:04:35.860> like<00:04:36.860> I<00:04:36.979> have<00:04:37.130> no<00:04:37.310> idea<00:04:37.550> how<00:04:37.639> they<00:04:37.760> do<00:04:37.820> they

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.090 
out like I have no idea how they do they

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:39.850 
out like I have no idea how they do they
just<00:04:38.300> go<00:04:38.690> through<00:04:39.020> the<00:04:39.110> barrier<00:04:39.590> that<00:04:39.710> they

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:39.860 
just go through the barrier that they

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.850 
just go through the barrier that they
broke<00:04:40.070> and<00:04:40.340> then<00:04:41.060> they<00:04:41.360> and<00:04:41.840> then<00:04:42.740> it<00:04:42.830> just

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:42.860 
broke and then they and then it just

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.399 
broke and then they and then it just
starts<00:04:43.220> lagging<00:04:43.430> really<00:04:44.030> bad<00:04:44.240> i'm<00:04:44.990> not<00:04:45.050> sure

00:04:45.399 --> 00:04:45.409 
starts lagging really bad i'm not sure

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:48.719 
starts lagging really bad i'm not sure
why<00:04:45.590> does<00:04:46.010> but<00:04:46.250> just<00:04:46.550> does<00:04:46.900> really<00:04:47.900> bad

00:04:48.719 --> 00:04:48.729 
why does but just does really bad

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:50.469 
why does but just does really bad
especially<00:04:49.729> when<00:04:49.820> it's<00:04:49.970> a<00:04:50.030> lot<00:04:50.210> of<00:04:50.360> zombies

00:04:50.469 --> 00:04:50.479 
especially when it's a lot of zombies

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:53.140 
especially when it's a lot of zombies
and<00:04:50.930> this<00:04:51.860> is<00:04:52.010> how<00:04:52.099> you<00:04:52.130> get<00:04:52.310> up<00:04:52.460> on<00:04:52.580> top<00:04:52.820> or<00:04:53.090> you

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:22.699 
nowhere and then I just start running

00:05:22.699 --> 00:05:24.100 
nowhere and then I just start running
from<00:05:22.970> him<00:05:23.060> because<00:05:23.180> I<00:05:23.360> am<00:05:23.479> thinking<00:05:23.750> of<00:05:23.960> this

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:24.110 
from him because I am thinking of this

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:26.499 
from him because I am thinking of this
like<00:05:24.320> world<00:05:24.590> at<00:05:24.740> war<00:05:24.949> and<00:05:25.849> enrolled<00:05:26.180> at<00:05:26.300> war

00:05:26.499 --> 00:05:26.509 
like world at war and enrolled at war

00:05:26.509 --> 00:05:28.330 
like world at war and enrolled at war
sometimes<00:05:26.990> they<00:05:27.139> chase<00:05:27.440> you<00:05:27.650> even<00:05:28.009> if<00:05:28.190> you're

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:28.340 
sometimes they chase you even if you're

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:30.100 
sometimes they chase you even if you're
outside<00:05:28.490> them<00:05:28.789> half<00:05:28.970> instead<00:05:29.750> of<00:05:29.840> going

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:30.110 
outside them half instead of going
