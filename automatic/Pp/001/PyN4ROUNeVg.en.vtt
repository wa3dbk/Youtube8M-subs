time<00:03:00.109> you'll<00:03:01.109> start<00:03:01.530> to<00:03:01.739> lose<00:03:02.010> a<00:03:02.430> lot<00:03:02.730> of<00:03:02.819> these

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
time you'll start to lose a lot of these

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.589

00:03:54.929 --> 00:03:54.939 
process also makes a huge difference but

00:03:54.939 --> 00:03:57.690

by and large most of it you can make or

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.479 
by and large most of it you can make or

it's absolutely divine

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:35.999 
it's absolutely divine
so<00:04:33.220> from<00:04:33.460> start<00:04:33.850> when<00:04:34.300> we<00:04:34.450> put<00:04:34.720> in<00:04:34.870> the

00:04:35.999 --> 00:04:36.009 
so from start when we put in the

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:38.760 
so from start when we put in the
until<00:04:36.580> he<00:04:36.999> gets<00:04:37.360> ejected<00:04:37.599> is<00:04:38.080> approximately

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:38.770 
until he gets ejected is approximately

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:40.980 
until he gets ejected is approximately
16<00:04:39.219> minutes<00:04:39.550> plus<00:04:39.999> another<00:04:40.240> four<00:04:40.599> modes<00:04:40.779> of

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:40.990 
16 minutes plus another four modes of

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:48.510 
16 minutes plus another four modes of
cooling<00:04:41.319> so<00:04:41.499> it's<00:04:41.619> about<00:04:41.830> twenty<00:04:47.369> and<00:04:48.369> it's

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:48.520 
cooling so it's about twenty and it's

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.019 
cooling so it's about twenty and it's
done

00:04:51.019 --> 00:04:51.029 

00:04:51.029 --> 00:04:54.869
