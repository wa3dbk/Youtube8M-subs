00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:04.290 

hi<00:00:01.390> folks<00:00:01.629> today<00:00:02.410> we're<00:00:02.679> going<00:00:02.860> to<00:00:03.129> show<00:00:03.790> you<00:00:03.850> a

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:04.300 
hi folks today we're going to show you a

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:06.870 
hi folks today we're going to show you a
little<00:00:04.570> video<00:00:05.110> about<00:00:05.650> how<00:00:05.920> to<00:00:05.950> reprime<00:00:06.670> the

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:06.880 
little video about how to reprime the

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:11.430 
little video about how to reprime the
oil<00:00:07.090> pump<00:00:07.360> on<00:00:07.890> a<00:00:08.890> series<00:00:09.670> engine<00:00:10.260> first<00:00:11.260> we

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:11.440 
oil pump on a series engine first we

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.280 
oil pump on a series engine first we
have<00:00:11.800> to<00:00:12.010> remove<00:00:12.460> the<00:00:12.790> coil<00:00:13.330> in<00:00:13.540> this<00:00:13.720> case<00:00:13.960> so

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:14.290 
have to remove the coil in this case so

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:16.919 
have to remove the coil in this case so
we<00:00:14.320> have<00:00:14.680> better<00:00:14.950> access<00:00:15.220> to<00:00:15.730> the<00:00:15.880> O's<00:00:16.510> that

00:00:16.919 --> 00:00:16.929 
we have better access to the O's that

00:00:16.929 --> 00:00:20.849 
we have better access to the O's that
leads<00:00:17.230> the<00:00:17.470> oil<00:00:17.800> into<00:00:18.460> the<00:00:18.490> block<00:00:19.679> then<00:00:20.679> you

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:20.859 
leads the oil into the block then you

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:27.220 
leads the oil into the block then you
undo<00:00:21.249> the<00:00:21.279> knot

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:27.230 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:32.689 

this<00:00:28.100> case<00:00:28.369> was<00:00:28.609> just<00:00:29.140> over<00:00:30.140> tightened

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:32.699 

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:37.939 

just<00:00:33.329> undo<00:00:33.690> that<00:00:33.980> detached<00:00:35.929> oil<00:00:36.929> hose<00:00:37.109> goes

00:00:37.939 --> 00:00:37.949 
just undo that detached oil hose goes

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:46.720 
just undo that detached oil hose goes
from<00:00:38.159> the<00:00:38.280> filters<00:00:38.670> of<00:00:38.789> the<00:00:38.850> block

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:46.730 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:52.210 

then<00:00:47.300> the<00:00:47.860> goal<00:00:48.860> is<00:00:49.130> to<00:00:49.540> pour<00:00:50.540> oil<00:00:51.190> back<00:00:52.190> into

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:52.220 
then the goal is to pour oil back into

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:54.819 
then the goal is to pour oil back into
the<00:00:52.850> pump<00:00:53.150> which<00:00:53.390> sits<00:00:53.900> somewhere<00:00:54.230> behind

00:00:54.819 --> 00:00:54.829 
the pump which sits somewhere behind

00:00:54.829 --> 00:01:00.900 
the pump which sits somewhere behind
that<00:00:55.840> opening<00:00:57.670> because<00:00:58.670> a<00:00:58.940> pump<00:00:59.840> has<00:01:00.079> run<00:01:00.290> dry

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:00.910 
that opening because a pump has run dry

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:06.700 
that opening because a pump has run dry
as<00:01:01.910> it<00:01:01.940> was<00:01:02.270> internally<00:01:02.960> leaking<00:01:04.900> so<00:01:05.900> we<00:01:06.500> want

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710 
as it was internally leaking so we want

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.350 
as it was internally leaking so we want
to<00:01:06.890> pour<00:01:07.880> some<00:01:08.119> oil<00:01:08.360> back<00:01:08.720> in<00:01:08.930> there<00:01:09.140> so<00:01:09.380> it<00:01:09.530> can

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:10.360 
to pour some oil back in there so it can

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:17.480 
to pour some oil back in there so it can
start<00:01:11.360> to<00:01:11.509> produce<00:01:12.500> a<00:01:12.979> vacuum<00:01:13.550> again

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.520 

this<00:01:18.390> takes<00:01:18.659> a<00:01:18.780> little<00:01:18.869> while<00:01:19.110> especially

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
this takes a little while especially

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.530 
this takes a little while especially
when<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.460> oil<00:01:20.490> is<00:01:20.970> cold<00:01:21.210> as<00:01:21.479> it<00:01:21.600> was<00:01:21.630> today

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:23.540 
when the oil is cold as it was today

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.570 
when the oil is cold as it was today
we're<00:01:24.540> now<00:01:24.630> pushing<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.229> car<00:01:25.470> backwards<00:01:25.920> in

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
we're now pushing the car backwards in

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.160 
we're now pushing the car backwards in
4th<00:01:26.880> gear<00:01:27.860> while<00:01:29.090> feeding<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.390> oil<00:01:30.539> pump<00:01:30.810> with

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
4th gear while feeding the oil pump with

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.230 
4th gear while feeding the oil pump with
oil

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
oil

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.130 
oil
basically<00:01:34.039> we<00:01:35.039> primed<00:01:35.430> it

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
basically we primed it

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.500 
basically we primed it
this<00:01:37.890> would<00:01:38.100> be<00:01:38.250> easier<00:01:38.580> if<00:01:38.790> you<00:01:38.940> had<00:01:39.180> removed

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:39.510 
this would be easier if you had removed

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:42.170 
this would be easier if you had removed
the<00:01:39.930> spark<00:01:40.740> plugs<00:01:41.010> in<00:01:41.190> the<00:01:41.280> first<00:01:41.520> place<00:01:41.760> we

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
the spark plugs in the first place we

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.880 
the spark plugs in the first place we
didn't<00:01:42.479> do<00:01:42.570> this<00:01:42.750> for

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:52.450 

and<00:01:46.730> for<00:01:46.910> this<00:01:47.030> I<00:01:48.880> like<00:01:49.880> to<00:01:50.560> just<00:01:51.560> fill<00:01:51.920> both

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
and for this I like to just fill both

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:55.980 
and for this I like to just fill both
the<00:01:52.790> oil<00:01:53.090> hose<00:01:53.720> as<00:01:54.080> well<00:01:54.290> as<00:01:54.560> the<00:01:54.890> galleries

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
the oil hose as well as the galleries

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:03.219 
the oil hose as well as the galleries
with<00:01:56.990> oil<00:01:57.230> as<00:01:57.500> far<00:01:58.190> as<00:01:58.340> I<00:01:58.490> can<00:01:59.500> so<00:02:00.500> just<00:02:02.229> comes

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
with oil as far as I can so just comes

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:05.320 
with oil as far as I can so just comes
out<00:02:03.440> there<00:02:03.800> doing<00:02:04.340> the<00:02:04.430> same<00:02:04.460> thing<00:02:04.940> starting

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:05.330 
out there doing the same thing starting

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.850 
out there doing the same thing starting
with<00:02:05.690> the<00:02:05.840> hose

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.070 

took<00:02:09.550> a<00:02:09.580> long<00:02:09.820> time<00:02:09.850> because<00:02:10.300> as<00:02:10.630> you<00:02:10.720> can<00:02:10.900> see

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
took a long time because as you can see

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.420 
took a long time because as you can see
the<00:02:11.290> oil<00:02:11.320> is<00:02:11.590> very<00:02:11.650> thick<00:02:12.070> this<00:02:12.340> is<00:02:12.640> a<00:02:13.290> stroll

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
the oil is very thick this is a stroll

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:26.040 
the oil is very thick this is a stroll
classic<00:02:15.750> 50<00:02:16.750> 20<00:02:17.650> W<00:02:18.100> 50<00:02:18.580> so<00:02:19.420> it's<00:02:19.990> cold<00:02:20.260> outside

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:34.100 

reconnect<00:02:26.710> the<00:02:26.860> hoes<00:02:27.750> block

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:41.030 

taking<00:02:34.740> it<00:02:34.830> out

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:46.600 

not<00:02:41.520> too<00:02:41.730> tight<00:02:42.060> just<00:02:43.160> okay

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.420 

and<00:02:47.420> reconnect<00:02:47.990> everything<00:02:48.410> that<00:02:48.950> you<00:02:49.100> had<00:02:49.280> to

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
and reconnect everything that you had to

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:54.680 
and reconnect everything that you had to
remove

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.560 

when<00:02:55.050> we're<00:02:55.200> done<00:02:55.350> with<00:02:55.770> this<00:02:55.980> you<00:02:56.280> can<00:02:56.570> try

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
when we're done with this you can try

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.690 
when we're done with this you can try
cranking<00:02:58.170> the<00:02:58.290> engine<00:02:58.410> again<00:02:58.830> and<00:02:59.100> see<00:02:59.280> if<00:02:59.310> it

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
cranking the engine again and see if it

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.580 
cranking the engine again and see if it
does<00:03:00.090> actually<00:03:00.570> build<00:03:00.810> oil<00:03:01.080> pressure<00:03:01.380> this

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
does actually build oil pressure this

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:07.660 
does actually build oil pressure this
time

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:10.849 

it<00:03:08.670> does
