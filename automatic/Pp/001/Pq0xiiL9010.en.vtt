00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:05.580
 new issue here at smart tv 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.500
 Today's topics are once 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.030
 best network germany 2012 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.860
 the launch of the new nexus 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.940
 Models and consumption of 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.940
 Data volume here in Germany 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:19.970
 what is the best mobile network in 

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:21.740
 Germany this question is yes 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:23.360
 especially those who get one 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.119
 want to make a new contract or one 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:28.970
 new prepaid card and loud a test 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:30.170
 the connect 2012 is the telekom that 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:31.820
 best network in germany 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:34.310
 haakon about three weeks in germany 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.930
 on the way and measured where and in 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:38.149
 which situations which network on 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.870
 best is and telecom has the best 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:40.820
 isolated 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.290
 the question which network one takes yes 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.390
 It was all the more important in the old days 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.550
 telephone calls and sms one still has 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.320
 not so busy but with 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.449
 the mobile internet is also this 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.670
 greater dependency on the network when 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:54.920
 I have mobile internet 3g then 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.539
 is it fast and anyway and so on 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.879
 More and more people are thinking 

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:00.289
 because they also have a good network 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:01.820
 and not just the cheapest 

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:03.530
 Suppliers are taking advantage of the rapid spread 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.239
 but brings some providers 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.260
 your limits and so it happens here and there 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:08.210
 also to weaken 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.980
 in one or the other network but 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.960
 That's why the suppliers are building theirs too 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:13.850
 networks constantly out yes as I said 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.650
 the first place goes to the telekom 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.920
 second place is vodafone on 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:20.360
 space 32 and to place four plus one 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.290
 positive thing is still 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.450
 add 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.729
 and that the networks of o2 and 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.649
 e-plus to be constantly expanded and 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:29.270
 that you could see in the test as well 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:30.259
 that these networks are already qualitatively 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.000
 have improved 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:33.259
 the many tariffs of all these four 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.140
 of course you can of course Germany 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:38.090
 on smava.de compare 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.649
 reported at the penultimate issue 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.689
 we about the release of the new ones 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:43.850
 lexus models on recently 

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:45.049
 Launched and google opened at 9 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.670
 clock in the morning the doors 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:48.770
 however, most were models 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.299
 sold out within a few minutes 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.219
 Of course, that annoyed many 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:54.229
 Potential buyers came to that 

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:56.360
 that google server had problems and 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:58.070
 that's why many even if they are there early 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.049
 on the side were not your purchase 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.310
 Both nexus four could finish 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:03.890
 Models were already after 20 minutes 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:06.049
 sold out the nexus 10 was complete 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.030
 with both models after 45 minutes 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:09.440
 sold out as I said many 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.360
 annoyed about this stupid run 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.520
 Launched and some throw google 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.900
 even before that they extra those problems 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.460
 Anyway, have introduced 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.620
 start of sale shows that many at the 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:20.420
 devices are interested that data 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.090
 transmission volume in mobile radio 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.860
 reaching a third in 2012 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.170
 the average data volume per 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.080
 postpaid users in about and 30 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:32.560
 percent and increases with it 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:34.060
 on 196 mb in the month the use of the 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.410
 Mobile Internet has been in the 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.410
 past two years approximately 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.460
 doubles and is now at 130 7 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.960
 million gigabytes 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:43.060
 this data is still without a lte 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:45.190
 included and it is assumed that 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:48.130
 Volume will rise sharply above all 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:50.290
 In 2013, that meant a lot more 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:52.000
 data can be transported and 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.100
 more and more smartphones are also on the way 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.720
 the market is steadily increasing 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:57.160
 the data volume is of course on the 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.170
 But especially smartphones 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.040
 They always go back further 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.600
 spread 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.970
 At this point a huge thank you 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.590
 you for 500 subscribers but also for it 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.480
 that you always make comments with 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.610
 Write and do not be scared of anyone 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.470

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.000
 ask her to follow the consequences yes 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.100
 I just wanted to say thank you 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.410

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:18.880

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:22.020
