00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:25.860 
feedback and we'll see the reception
here<00:01:24.340> I<00:01:24.370> mean<00:01:24.580> if<00:01:24.700> it's<00:01:24.850> like<00:01:25.090> you<00:01:25.270> guys<00:01:25.390> are<00:01:25.450> no

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
don't even go down this road then

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:28.590

obviously I'll listen to you but I

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:29.310 
obviously I'll listen to you but I
thought<00:01:28.780> it<00:01:28.990> would<00:01:29.080> be<00:01:29.140> something

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:29.320 
thought it would be something

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.920 
thought it would be something
interesting<00:01:29.560> maybe<00:01:30.340> provide<00:01:30.790> updates<00:01:31.270> every

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:31.930 
interesting maybe provide updates every

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:34.170 
interesting maybe provide updates every
week<00:01:32.500> or<00:01:32.680> so<00:01:32.710> hopefully<00:01:33.220> like<00:01:33.370> weekly<00:01:33.730> updates

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:34.180 
week or so hopefully like weekly updates

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:36.060 
week or so hopefully like weekly updates
and<00:01:34.420> then<00:01:34.780> different<00:01:35.350> things<00:01:35.560> that<00:01:35.770> I<00:01:35.920> would

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:36.070 
and then different things that I would

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.610 
and then different things that I would
like<00:01:36.190> to<00:01:36.340> improve<00:01:36.520> on<00:01:36.730> so<00:01:37.030> that<00:01:37.870> is<00:01:38.080> the<00:01:38.290> plan

close attention to my elbows what you're
gonna<00:02:28.340> notice<00:02:28.580> is<00:02:28.970> at<00:02:29.360> the<00:02:29.450> bottom<00:02:29.810> portion<00:02:30.200> of

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
gonna notice is at the bottom portion of

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.320 
gonna notice is at the bottom portion of
the<00:02:30.440> rep<00:02:30.680> my<00:02:30.860> elbows<00:02:31.280> start<00:02:31.460> to<00:02:31.640> flare<00:02:31.940> out<00:02:31.970> and

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
the rep my elbows start to flare out and

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.530 
the rep my elbows start to flare out and
I<00:02:32.390> lose<00:02:32.810> all<00:02:33.140> power<00:02:33.590> and<00:02:34.040> that's<00:02:34.700> a<00:02:34.850> huge<00:02:35.240> issue

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
I lose all power and that's a huge issue

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.710

so<00:02:35.990> we're<00:02:36.170> gonna<00:02:36.260> contrast<00:02:36.980> that<00:02:37.430> with<00:02:38.030> my<00:02:38.210> PR

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
so we're gonna contrast that with my PR

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.920 
so we're gonna contrast that with my PR
of<00:02:39.190> 285<00:02:40.190> pounds<00:02:40.700> and<00:02:41.030> you<00:02:41.180> can<00:02:41.360> see<00:02:41.600> I<00:02:41.630> do<00:02:41.810> a

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:41.930 
of 285 pounds and you can see I do a

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.230 
of 285 pounds and you can see I do a
much<00:02:42.230> better<00:02:42.530> job<00:02:42.680> of<00:02:43.220> keeping<00:02:43.610> my<00:02:43.850> elbows

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:44.240 
much better job of keeping my elbows

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.960 
much better job of keeping my elbows
tucked<00:02:44.540> thus<00:02:45.200> gaining<00:02:45.710> a<00:02:45.830> lot<00:02:46.040> more<00:02:46.340> power<00:02:46.640> so

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
tucked thus gaining a lot more power so

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.030 
tucked thus gaining a lot more power so
that<00:02:47.000> is<00:02:47.540> going<00:02:47.990> to<00:02:48.080> be<00:02:48.260> one<00:02:48.620> of<00:02:48.740> the<00:02:48.860> things

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
that is going to be one of the things

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.620 
that is going to be one of the things
that<00:02:49.340> I'm<00:02:49.460> gonna<00:02:49.580> be<00:02:49.790> paying<00:02:50.030> close<00:02:50.420> attention

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:40.670 
people wear them but my guesses are not

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:42.520 
people wear them but my guesses are not
the<00:03:40.850> most<00:03:41.000> fashionable<00:03:41.540> thing<00:03:41.810> ever<00:03:41.989> but<00:03:42.380> I

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
the most fashionable thing ever but I

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.110 
the most fashionable thing ever but I
just<00:03:42.769> like<00:03:42.980> them<00:03:43.160> I<00:03:43.250> don't<00:03:43.310> know<00:03:43.580> and<00:03:43.820> then<00:03:43.940> the

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
just like them I don't know and then the

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.670 
just like them I don't know and then the
fact<00:03:44.360> that<00:03:44.510> they<00:03:44.570> have<00:03:44.780> pockets<00:03:45.470> with<00:03:45.650> zippers

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
fact that they have pockets with zippers

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.820

I<00:03:46.400> mean<00:03:47.180> if<00:03:47.540> you're<00:03:47.840> a<00:03:47.870> guy<00:03:48.050> you<00:03:48.110> can<00:03:48.440> relate<00:03:48.709> to

I mean if you're a guy you can relate to

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:50.080 
I mean if you're a guy you can relate to
that<00:03:48.950> it's<00:03:49.100> probably<00:03:49.400> making<00:03:49.550> me<00:03:49.790> sound<00:03:50.060> like

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
that it's probably making me sound like

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.180 
that it's probably making me sound like
an<00:03:50.269> old<00:03:50.420> man<00:03:50.630> but<00:03:50.930> it's<00:03:51.200> such<00:03:51.500> a<00:03:51.530> pain<00:03:51.950> when

grams of fat so during my workout today
I<00:05:15.280> was<00:05:15.550> not<00:05:15.729> feeling<00:05:15.910> the<00:05:16.120> greatest

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:16.360 
I was not feeling the greatest

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:17.850 
I was not feeling the greatest
especially<00:05:16.930> because<00:05:17.050> it<00:05:17.199> was<00:05:17.289> so<00:05:17.410> hot<00:05:17.650> in<00:05:17.770> the

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:17.860 
especially because it was so hot in the

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:19.800 
especially because it was so hot in the
garage<00:05:18.099> but<00:05:18.490> we<00:05:18.610> made<00:05:18.760> it<00:05:18.789> through<00:05:18.880> going<00:05:19.690> a

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:19.810 
garage but we made it through going a

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:20.610 
garage but we made it through going a
lot<00:05:19.930> better<00:05:20.169> now

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:20.620 
lot better now

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:23.580

00:06:31.389 --> 00:06:33.779 
and tired of what people label as clean
food<00:06:31.689> you<00:06:32.169> can<00:06:32.319> spice<00:06:32.559> it<00:06:32.589> up<00:06:32.830> a<00:06:32.949> little<00:06:32.979> bit<00:06:33.339> so

00:06:33.779 --> 00:06:33.789 
food you can spice it up a little bit so

00:06:33.789 --> 00:06:34.860 
food you can spice it up a little bit so
we're<00:06:33.879> just<00:06:33.999> gonna<00:06:34.089> take<00:06:34.180> a<00:06:34.240> few<00:06:34.449> basic

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:34.870 
we're just gonna take a few basic

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:36.600 
we're just gonna take a few basic
ingredients<00:06:35.379> here<00:06:35.620> and<00:06:35.800> make<00:06:36.279> it<00:06:36.430> a<00:06:36.460> little

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:36.610 
ingredients here and make it a little

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:38.399 
ingredients here and make it a little
bit<00:06:36.759> better<00:06:36.909> so<00:06:37.659> I<00:06:37.689> think<00:06:37.779> anyone<00:06:38.169> that<00:06:38.229> puts

00:06:38.399 --> 00:06:38.409 
bit better so I think anyone that puts

00:06:38.409 --> 00:06:39.600 
bit better so I think anyone that puts
them<00:06:38.589> stuff<00:06:38.770> on<00:06:38.889> the<00:06:38.979> internet<00:06:39.099> can<00:06:39.400> probably

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:39.610 
them stuff on the internet can probably

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:41.999
