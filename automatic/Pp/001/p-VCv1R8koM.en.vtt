 that was presented at the whole port level 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:58.879
 rich and now when this script arrives 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.530

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.290
 they also continue in syracuse an excellent 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:09.260
 booklet that has been talking to me for a long time 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.870
 time about this misunderstanding comedy 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.980
 this is a project that we have 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:13.580
 pending a little while ago 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:17.290
 inspiration 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:19.330
 obviously parenting obviously 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:22.420
 from my father that my father 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:24.850
 he grew up in the laja river neighborhood of your altar 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.380
 a small neighborhood where there is a series of 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.300
 characters that everyone has 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.650
 its particular characteristics and where 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.020
 presents a single port what is the 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.460
 puerto rico essence as we are like 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.710
 we celebrate our party as 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.720
 we celebrate our weddings in port 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.160
 rich- we talk about weddings and 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.830
 Funerals is where you see the most 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:44.080
 relatives this movie is a comedy 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:46.180
 romantic and my intention is that the 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.010
 public is invited to this wedding and in 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.869
 this story in castañer 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:52.600
 particularly casteller a sector of 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:55.060
 area that is characteristic because it is 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:58.060
 far away from your own people who are 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:00.100
 40 minutes from the area and they are fine 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.560
 far from san juan they get very few 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.570
 How are you people in Puerto Rico? 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.100
 I mean that already to the continuation of what 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.780
 which is the metro area today the area 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.720
 meter that receives has grown and every time 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.940
 what is field and particularly the 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.459
 things that happen in the countryside a people 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:18.100
 of Cataño intervening in what they are 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:19.700
 the chestnut affairs being the babe 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.830
 blanquita daughter of the doctor 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.500
 in castañer of a pretty family 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.420
 accommodated in the village is going to marry 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.370
 a little boy from Cataño some people who 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:31.459
 they are waiting for the party to the fence 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:35.209
 as they lead these two families that are 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:37.069
 unite for this great wedding in castañeda I 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:39.920
 I grew up watching many works of Ferrari 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:42.019
 when ferrari a great writer of works 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:45.500
 that are of the style of this selective with 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:47.090
 the comedy and where it highlights what the 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.340
 typical Puerto Rican of these 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.049
 activities that is when you see 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.489
 this movie is going to tell me I was in 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:54.410
 a wedding that will happen in series I had a 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:56.420
 wedding happened the other figures and you 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.400
 who have gone to a wedding and the safest thing if 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:01.010
 have had the happiness of going to a wedding in the 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.690
 field you know quite differently to go to a 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.459
 wedding in the metropolitan area of 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.709
 chestnut being a sector that is 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:08.720
 pretty isolated art even from 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:10.130
 town where you have some 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.590
 particular characteristics we use 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:14.900
 as a scenario to be able 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:17.209
 carry out this plot that is 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.980
 totally fictitious fictional totally 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:21.830
 of the imagination and I count on the 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:24.950
 First-rate actors like Braulio 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:27.170
 castle of new novel I grow to admire 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:29.269
 to dyn and michael schubert that in addition to 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:32.120
 to be a spectacular singer is an actor 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:35.480
 first and it's perfect for this 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:38.780
 character sky cave adrián garcía sara 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:41.450
 shepherd efraín lópez neris calito ramírez 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:44.959
 marian pabón a web in chestnut is a 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:46.730
