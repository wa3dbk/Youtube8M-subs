in<00:02:16.670> the<00:02:16.760> link<00:02:16.940> below<00:02:17.060> um<00:02:17.900> but<00:02:18.200> yeah<00:02:18.560> so<00:02:18.800> now<00:02:18.950> we

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.650 
in the link below um but yeah so now we
can<00:02:19.220> finally<00:02:19.490> move<00:02:19.730> on<00:02:19.940> from<00:02:20.120> the<00:02:20.300> fact<00:02:20.540> that

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
can finally move on from the fact that

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.900 
can finally move on from the fact that
my<00:02:20.840> hair<00:02:21.080> is<00:02:21.110> not<00:02:21.440> a<00:02:21.680> lesbian<00:02:22.130> cut<00:02:22.489> even<00:02:22.790> though

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
my hair is not a lesbian cut even though

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:24.670 
my hair is not a lesbian cut even though
it's<00:02:23.030> more<00:02:23.209> lesbian<00:02:23.720> than<00:02:23.840> it<00:02:23.989> than<00:02:24.350> it<00:02:24.500> was

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680
