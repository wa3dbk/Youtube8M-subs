00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:14.610
 and there is an extra with me because today 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.839
 again very active so without offense 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.980
 micro I could not move 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:21.240
 with and without tv and today in the 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.060
 what can series do 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.609
 what can green tea what is healthy what came 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.220
 green tea how could one take 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:32.790
 Also, critics like to call you equity 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.829
 Extract green same green tea extract it 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.649
 mostly what you then as a supplement 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:40.790
 get a look at what's green 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:44.730
 of course a plant camellia sinensis 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:47.309
 is called the revenge the whole is called the 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.200
 plant naturally great animal becomes very 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.989
 very much as an offender she must contain 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.270
 so-called polyphenols the polyphenols 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.550
 are in a nutshell secondary 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.430
 plant substances and the most active and the 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.809
 most robust and the one around us 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.559
 actually goes with the whole 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.660
 history 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.010
 what's the green tea at this jack of all trades 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.229
 actually is and we come to that now 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.200
 right next sorry it's about that 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.369
 egt i will spare you this now 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.799
 to pronounce whole 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.530
 just google it after wikipedia 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.119
 after that and then you will get it that 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.790
 complicated to say it is there 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.880
 about 500 varieties of which I now 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.470
 for example, supposedly there are 1500 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:29.220
 There were supposedly more 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:32.750
 several thousand species are certain 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.750
 and various ingredients 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.259
 to be standardized means the whole 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.329
 then rate that extra bred that way 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.950
 for example, a high percentage 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.170
 ece third that a high percentage 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:47.310
 of caffeine in it is that high 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:50.180
 percentage on other dates is in it 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:53.310
 or just matcha tea 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:55.259
 It's about these varieties 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.259
 incredibly diverse and that are 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:59.719
 usually so standardized or something 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:01.649
 designed that just different things 

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:03.229
 different ingredients of the height 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.520
 contained in percent 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:07.740
 we are here today or respectively 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:11.459
 Generally with this reason just times 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:13.060
 By the way, this ego always in one 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.310
 complete thing 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.620
 in complete crew training too but to 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.000
 should be led that is you 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.800
 must look as if it for example to 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.370
 you have to drink tea somehow 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:26.739
 Find out how many eggs or green tea 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:29.230
 otherwise we will receive 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:32.010
 probably a problem with the 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:38.950
 effectiveness of the whole story though 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:39.459
 we're talking about eg cg what 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.489
 can 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:45.069
 green tea I'm on shift a star 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:47.530
 Results a star results though 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:51.100
 in category so in studies 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:53.980
 categories the category a to d are there 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:56.319
 yes Bremen for example, there is the de 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.489
 ie b and c I will personally am 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:00.180
 still some there is a bit 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:03.370
 spongy but that's for it 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:06.010
 Study results from a to b and c 1 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.959
 Star results in his field 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.760
 in terms of fat burning it is two 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:12.580
 Different things burn fat there 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.440
 Fat breaks down 24 hours a day 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.959
 we come to the intake is still 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:19.650
 actually the breakdown of body fat we 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:21.760
 have an improvement of the ldl and hdl 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.890
 cholesterol values ​​we have one 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:27.010
 Improvement of insulin sensitivity 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:28.540
 we have a connection with the 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:32.769
 blood vessels opens up a bit 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:34.510
 and thereby become healthier 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:34.989
 the blood vessels are called exactly that 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.420
 took 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:38.829
 the attention becomes funny 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.900
 increased and we have a bit 

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:44.350
 we also have the antihypertensive 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.690
 a hard trade reduction than that 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:47.859
 Depot is a bit down 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.060
 that was a bit too spongy 

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:51.850
 I have not written off anymore 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:55.260
 that means we have very many very 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:57.370
 that's why many of them work 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:00.850
 hints or the expression of me that 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:02.650
 it kind of a jack of all trades is the 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:04.989
 means we have very many areas 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:09.519
 where the devices are actually effective 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:10.750
 can and will we simplify 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:13.060
 whole story now with the dosage 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.680
 when taking a bit if you can 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:17.229
 in the direction of fat loss would like to go 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:19.930
 one should here up to 500 mg pcb 

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:21.700
 Therefore, the note before us 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.479
 have to look that we on epc 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:24.570
 come 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:28.800
 4 500 milligrams 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:32.420
 daily but very important no caffeine 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:36.270
 otherwise this fat really breaks down 

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:40.340
 fatmas reduction fatmas editorial comes 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:46.800
 only if you have no one else 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:50.010
 sky no profi consumer is the 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:52.230
 regular caffeine consumption therefore 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:57.000
 when you actually found the company for 

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:58.920
 setup with no caffeine and would like 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.420
 For many, caffeine is one thing 

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:01.890
 about a diet actually brings where you 

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:04.260
 no hunger where to go through the 

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:06.300
 twitter is and so on that is there 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:08.160
 I might actually win 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.870
 is there we actually have to be careful 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:12.510
 because it is always crowned 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:14.730
 Superfilm fat break down the people 

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:17.310
 another ten coffees a day brings us 

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:18.600
 unfortunately nothing at all 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:20.400
 really only works the calories 

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.780
 deficit for us and the greens here 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.310
 actually does not do anything 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.840
 maybe our goethe will help over the day 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:27.750
 because he also has a bit of caffeine 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:28.890
 where the variants the egt to 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:30.360
 example, standardize that one 

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:32.280
 usually only one or a half 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:34.170
 percent caffeine in there so it is 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:36.600
 totally bred from the plants like 

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:38.840
 said 500 varieties can be in the end 

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:41.070
 Do whatever you want with the plant 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:42.870
 and now we are at health 

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:45.600
 the health means 200 mg 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:47.160
 at least daily, over three times 

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:49.230
 that means it will be distributed now 

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:52.350
 difficult in food and sports nutrition 

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:55.170
 most are on as much as possible 

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:57.270
 many trains per capsule designed with it 

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:58.830
 We very much reinkriegen many capsule 

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:00.360
 to make capsule mitosis 

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:02.160
 can and therefore the product 

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:03.540
 that can offer a bit cheaper 

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:06.030
 If I say that three times 

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:08.670
 distribute daily with these 

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:09.720
 then whole health effects 

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:11.040
 also be effective 

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:12.870
 then I can not say either 

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:14.820
 equal to the mission of milligrams or 

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:17.430
 but I have to be supplied with the product at night 

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:21.420
 example only 70 or 80 or maybe 

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:24.030
 Contains 100 mg pcb per capsule 

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:27.720
 for most, it's in the end 

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:29.550
 already more as I said from four to 

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:32.550
 five hundred cheaper otherwise no 

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:34.290
 profi linas very important and the 

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:36.210
 health more or less says 

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:37.350
 that can be at least 200 billion 

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:39.300
 Naturally 

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:42.230
 combined that was the biggest as should 

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:42.230
 the next time there again
