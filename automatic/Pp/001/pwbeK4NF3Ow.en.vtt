the<00:00:00.269> DWG<00:00:00.780> file<00:00:01.170> format<00:00:01.620> is<00:00:01.800> native<00:00:02.129> to<00:00:02.250> AutoCAD

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:02.639 
the DWG file format is native to AutoCAD

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:04.370 
the DWG file format is native to AutoCAD
in<00:00:02.820> its<00:00:02.970> derivatives<00:00:03.540> but<00:00:03.750> it<00:00:03.840> can<00:00:03.990> also<00:00:04.140> be

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
in its derivatives but it can also be

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.710 
in its derivatives but it can also be
exported<00:00:04.680> from<00:00:04.950> many<00:00:05.190> applications<00:00:05.910> you<00:00:06.150> can

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
exported from many applications you can

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.230 
exported from many applications you can
link<00:00:06.930> DWG<00:00:07.589> files<00:00:07.830> to<00:00:08.040> 3ds<00:00:08.400> max<00:00:08.490> so<00:00:08.910> that<00:00:09.059> any

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
link DWG files to 3ds max so that any

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.970 
link DWG files to 3ds max so that any
changes<00:00:09.690> through<00:00:09.840> the<00:00:09.870> DWG<00:00:10.559> can<00:00:10.740> be<00:00:10.860> updated

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
changes through the DWG can be updated

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.339 
changes through the DWG can be updated
in<00:00:11.429> 3ds<00:00:11.759> max<00:00:12.090> there<00:00:12.480> are<00:00:12.540> typically<00:00:12.900> two<00:00:13.019> ways

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
in 3ds max there are typically two ways

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.310 
in 3ds max there are typically two ways
to<00:00:13.559> work<00:00:13.710> with<00:00:13.740> the<00:00:13.980> DWG<00:00:14.549> file<00:00:14.790> in<00:00:15.089> 3ds<00:00:15.420> max<00:00:15.719> one

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
to work with the DWG file in 3ds max one

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.620 
to work with the DWG file in 3ds max one
method<00:00:16.680> is<00:00:16.800> to<00:00:16.980> use<00:00:17.010> a<00:00:17.130> 2d<00:00:17.580> DWG<00:00:18.240> file<00:00:18.420> as<00:00:18.600> a

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
method is to use a 2d DWG file as a

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.689 
method is to use a 2d DWG file as a
reference<00:00:19.080> we<00:00:19.230> can<00:00:19.439> build<00:00:19.619> 3d<00:00:19.980> geometry<00:00:20.520> such

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
reference we can build 3d geometry such

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.890 
reference we can build 3d geometry such
as<00:00:20.880> walls<00:00:21.119> doors<00:00:21.420> and<00:00:21.539> windows<00:00:21.990> in<00:00:22.140> 3ds<00:00:22.470> max

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:23.900 
as walls doors and windows in 3ds max

as walls doors and windows in 3ds max
the<00:00:24.900> other<00:00:25.050> is<00:00:25.199> to<00:00:25.350> use<00:00:25.470> a<00:00:25.500> 3d<00:00:25.980> DWG<00:00:26.490> file<00:00:26.849> that

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
the other is to use a 3d DWG file that

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.000 
the other is to use a 3d DWG file that
already<00:00:27.180> has<00:00:27.599> 3d<00:00:28.019> geometry<00:00:28.560> which<00:00:28.710> you<00:00:28.830> can
