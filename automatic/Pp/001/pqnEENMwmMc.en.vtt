00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 the law welcomes another video 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:08.040
 what series need for speed monster year 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:09.719
 this time the chevrolet cobalt ss esse 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.300
 car different from others for example 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:15.299
 first victim an excellent curve the 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:18.300
 second of an excellent acceleration this 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.939
 here his differential is the top speed or 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:25.920
 whether it is maximum speed 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:28.289
 that reaches until the last march to 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.660
 compensate for this lack of acceleration and 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.579
 curve would be ideal in the beginning as 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.140
 Spare a buck when you buy 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.649
 it's a unifesp starter car 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.540
 ã showed the léo you just use 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:42.450
 this money left increasing 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.739
 acceleration or increasing the force of 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.660
 his curve 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.329
 this death or a petty notification 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.890
 basic in the visual how to test and 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:56.280
 now on the track I'll choose that one 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:57.449
 the race that was left was just a 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.250
 circuit 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.449
 Let's see how this car here in 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.449
 track this monster 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.689
 Come on, it's raining on the other video too. 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:16.470
 his bailout also in 4 I could not 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.780
 catch the perfect and so are in 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.890
 last 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.820
 Let's see if I can get it first. 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.820
 place with this car 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:30.760
 not gaining speed 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:39.260
 You can manage to pass if I'm not mistaken. 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:40.750
 there is a shortcut here close by but 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:44.240
 never mind 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:47.360
 come on you like the one on the eighth curve 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:50.420
 iron besides quickie not from here not 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:52.190
 I managed to hold the car but saw 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.550
 precisely because of the lack of acceleration 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:58.190
 compared to others in the head other 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:00.950
 after a beat but nothing 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:04.930
 that the car does not regain its speed 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:07.610
 after allowing overtaking 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:11.810
 I find any form I particularly 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:13.550
 I do not like to sound sincere in cars 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.290
 form of carbon dedicated to trade 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.410
 with that other car that is more 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:22.220
 old and did not play camaro chevrolet 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:24.650
 that his differential is precisely the 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:27.019
 thus be the celebration of an animal that 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.950
 he carries a very absurd monster of 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:31.790
 acceleration 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:34.400
 I take this shortcut to have a 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:37.519
 a skid a skid there is nothing 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.049
 that I can not hold here in the 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:41.209
 fifth march 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:43.220
 the difference is that for example here in 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:46.820
 fifth gear in this car 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:50.000
 I 'm reaching more or less the maximum 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:52.610
 than I salt with senna clift point 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.239
 ie the fifth gear this one is already 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:57.739
 the maximum that other fiat despite that 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:00.560
 for example the other film that can 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:03.500
 get the most out of it 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.780
 different from that which takes time 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.910
 can get maximum speed but 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:13.180
 nothing that is absurd to have lived in 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:13.180
 prison if update button here d 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:21.650
 I won well at school and another fiat. 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.780
 another place for a car that holds 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.760
 more 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:28.459
 so you do not have much to talk about 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.440
 steal a car that has a lot of top speed 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:31.670
 ie a car that reaches speeds 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.430
 very high 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:37.220
 but as at the beginning there is not much clue 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:40.280
 that you can keep the car in 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:43.819
 steady and continuous acceleration 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:47.720
 the cobalt in a car that I suggest is 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:49.400
 very good start you no longer will be a 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.319
 excellent car for the second stage 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:55.880
 got a top speed you're going 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:59.060
 unlock 1 to 1 nitro in the after 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:01.070
 defeat the first blacklist then a 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:03.459
 own car is almost 

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:06.620
 arriving in 2070 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:10.250
 is a car is great for you and for 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:12.560
 second stage a complex of 14 but you 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:13.940
 likes car with gum with a top ask for 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.340
 high 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:20.180
 This is what is great for you. 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:21.200
 file that I did is that pandemonium in the 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.910
 Traffic 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.830
 I hope you have enjoyed this 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:26.990
 video was very short nothing too much 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:32.470
 years - only to demonstrate how 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:32.470
 Does this car work a skid here? 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:37.690
 eita will combine with the 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.690
 truck driver 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:47.180
 the goal according to the police then 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:49.280
 here the video if you liked 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:51.289
 favorite and gave him that the house has 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:54.890
 been shown to negatively affect the 

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:57.530
 if possible sign up for the channel and let 

00:04:54.890 --> 00:05:00.490
 a comment a hug will have the 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:00.490
 Next video bye bye
