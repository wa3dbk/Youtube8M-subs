 she strange Kensy Outer the strange Kenzie my luck draw one 

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:15.960
 Club here is the third duel of the last matchday of the Bundesliga that 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.789
 who will dismount will decide 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:23.079
 the guests from Frankfurt necessarily need the points Â»while the 

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:27.080
 Hosts in front of their own fans will celebrate the deserved championship title 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.960
 In the end, a team will definitely celebrate who this is going to be 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.380
 Result from this game but also from the results of the two 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:39.800
 other duels fought for survival 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:47.390
 14 days May 2011 to 15:30 the Dortmund are already with the celebration 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:48.530
 began 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:53.060
 the last round is completed in the own stadium and the championship bowl is 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:54.770
 already secured 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.600
 the local players will not go so relaxed in this game 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.980
 they do not need the points but they will do everything they can to make sure and safe 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.670
 convincing victory of their own fans to bring and regardless of 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.360
 as such a result can bring against opponents in the second division 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.610
 the Dortmund want their celebrations because of the problems of 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.670
 Team from Frankfurt do not spoil as well as the great performance in the 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.980
 own stadium though they only one defeat and seven goals conceded in 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:27.430
 this 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:29.250
 strangely conceded 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.560
 It is true that the Dortmunder is not a very good form of play in the last 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.280
 May have rounds but that relates mainly to the 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.900
 Guest appearances because they were forced in the last two away games 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.399
 the home games were not in crisis because they were in the last three 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:50.040
 Duels at home have celebrated convincing victories 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.870
 They scored nine goals in those matches and only one goal 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:55.440
 cashed 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.530
 the announced schedule tells us ahead that they will play as 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.860
 be it a decisive game 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.010
 they will come up with the strongest start of 11 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:11.120
 Only the injured Sahin P Kramer and Proton Arena will be eliminated 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:16.370
 everyone else is there and ready for a big party but only after they have the 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.569
 Have conquered harmony 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:20.079
 expected installation 

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:22.630
 Position Borussia Dortmund against it lost

 the concord is before this last round 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:37.319
 the hardest situation 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:40.739
 they are in a situation they are before the winter break 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.190
 as they manage to top the table not even dreaming in their wildest dreams 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.659
 could have imagined 

00:02:48.659 --> 00:02:52.480
 but then the spring and the form of concord has always been 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:53.539
 worse 

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:57.109
 find an incredible series of bad results 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:01.829
 they're just not capable of any crew except the one 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:05.409
 Paulaner who have descended already to conquer 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:10.559
 They made some draws but that was not enough 

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:15.169
 to avoid these situations in which they are located before the last round 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:20.379
 it did not even help them to do so on the last matchday against Cologne 

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:22.799
 own stadium have played 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:26.909
 the Billy Goats are by far the worst visiting team and they 

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:30.930
 celebrated their second away win in Frankfurt and won the 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.949
 Saved league 

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:37.169
 if you know that in this game before goalkeeper Fangmann BaZ 

00:03:37.169 --> 00:03:40.389
 the players have been clear then how they played 

00:03:41.149 --> 00:03:45.389
 after the game with can a conflict with the fans is guaranteed 

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:50.549
 even before this game there were problems with the disappointed fans leaving them 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:53.279
 have trained in secret places 

00:03:53.279 --> 00:03:57.469
 the coach Daum who was welcomed as the savior is now the most 

00:03:57.469 --> 00:04:00.039
 hated people in Frankfurt 

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:03.719
 So the atmosphere is so bad that it can hardly get worse 

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:08.609
 They are visiting the new champion in Dortmund today and they know that they are 

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:11.039
 In this game you have to win 

00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:14.819
 they also know that the Dortmunderin own stadium barely 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:16.699
 Concede goals 

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:20.459
 We will soon see what coach Daum will think up 

00:04:21.249 --> 00:04:25.919
 Red will be back in defense while Amanatidis in midfield 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:27.330
 should act 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:32.050
 Fenin is said to be at the head of the attack along with Gekas 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:35.499
 Halil Altintop should stay on the bench 

00:04:35.499 --> 00:04:36.580
 it will not be 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.259
 Hector cool to give her changes 

00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:43.900
 this is her last chance on Poland also that she is no guarantee that 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.900
 they will not dismount 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:47.409
 expected installation 

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:49.510
 Position Eintracht Haarmann 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:51.879
 he is Jung became Bruce Kohler 

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:54.719
 Box Schweeger Cairo Amanatidis 

00:04:54.719 --> 00:04:59.649
 Gekas Fenin considering that the guests urgently need the points 

00:04:59.649 --> 00:05:04.149
 while the hosts do not need points it is difficult 

00:05:04.149 --> 00:05:07.740
 anything but typing on Dortmunder's victory 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:12.310
 the title celebration will give them an additional motive while the 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:15.710
 Guests in such an important game will certainly fail 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:20.169
 should the news from Hoffenheim and Hamburg be bad the 

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:24.319
 Nervousness will be even bigger but eventually someone has to dismount
