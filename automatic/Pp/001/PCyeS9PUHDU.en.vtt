00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
it was last one at Target and I and a

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.440 
it was last one at Target and I and a
lot<00:00:32.130> of<00:00:32.160> people<00:00:32.489> kind<00:00:32.669> of<00:00:32.850> messed<00:00:33.000> him<00:00:33.180> up<00:00:33.270> I

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
lot of people kind of messed him up I

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.250 
guess but he was only $30 he was on sale
so<00:00:36.780> I<00:00:37.559> thought<00:00:37.950> that<00:00:38.100> was<00:00:38.219> a<00:00:38.250> plus<00:00:39.079> so<00:00:40.079> I'm

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
so I thought that was a plus so I'm

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.799 
so I thought that was a plus so I'm
turning<00:00:40.530> around<00:00:40.770> and<00:00:41.010> show<00:00:41.309> you<00:00:41.480> what<00:00:42.480> else<00:00:42.629> it

air they didn't fold the creases see
like<00:02:02.009> right<00:02:02.219> here<00:02:02.640> I'm<00:02:02.790> not<00:02:02.850> sure<00:02:02.939> if<00:02:03.119> you<00:02:03.270> see

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
like right here I'm not sure if you see

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.420
