 I'll pass it on to you. 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.639
 that place with only the tristan 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:12.599
 his hockey nautical number will have the 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.230
 description in a number 469 I think it is 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.150
 that 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.640
 he is very easy to teach the hymn 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.560
 15 received 39 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.869
 that is if you want to arrest others is 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.580
 very easy even this class I will 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.560
 to use the same rhythm as others who 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.029
 be rock pop beat that is very 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.470
 easy to learn 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:33.130
 ok let's go then version 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:41.540
 simplified 1234 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:41.540
 [Music] 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:56.500
 Because of the way 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:07.390
 The fight 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:08.210
 ae 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:18.090
 to reveal 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:20.810
 [Music] 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.810
 foot 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:32.209
 [Music] 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:42.470
 to play this song you will use 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:46.630
 only three chords is very simple is the 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:49.420
 Bigger sun is the tone of the song 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:52.240
 after the most 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:55.700
 [Music] 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:57.800
 You 'll also use the remedy. 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:01.160
 [Music] 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:03.920
 notice well finger positioning 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:07.340
 the sound gets better and in the beat too 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.970
 try to hit the strings more than 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:14.210
 is not only playing on top that does not 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:15.230
 It was only for beginners, it got worse. 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:17.090
 OK 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:20.330
 When you advance, you will 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.680
 working there where you play 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.330
 to get the best sound 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.940
 but the tip I put a touch on 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.890
 while the most thinly're try 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:32.570
 hit bells then puts touches 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:34.700
 alone but try to attack the fininhas 

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:38.600
 rhythm of the song is going to be a pop rhythm 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:41.330
 rock or a very basic beat that 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:43.970
 use several other hymns of appa 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:46.250
 also other gospel hymns etc. 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:49.010
 is the following I will divide this rhythm into 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.930
 two parts will be like this the first 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:54.140
 step 2 down 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:56.180
 I'm going to build a bigger sun here. 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:03:00.640
 bacaninha'll do two down 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.640
 so it's 12 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:09.780
 it's slow be two longer jobs 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:13.409
 So, it's okay, I can do it with the 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:19.060
 indicator on the nail or with 

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:22.840
 thumb O so okay so 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:24.819
 an open hand playing with the middle finger and 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:29.040
 annular 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:29.040
 you can choose so let's go 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.760
 342 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:37.970
 then the second part will be like this 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:43.040
 two up and two down fast 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:46.569
 to two up and two down fast 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.569
 It will be more so in time. 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:54.739
 I did everything with the indicator you can do 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:54.739
 against the fingers 

00:03:55.240 --> 00:04:00.280
 ok depends on the sound you want 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:11.650
 take away let's join the two parts 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:20.260
 Let's go 3422 again. 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:24.040
 slowly now 9 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:28.160
 [Music] 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:30.050
 beauty, you only have to train very well and I 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.120
 I have a separate class also teaching 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.930
 only this rhythm for those who have more 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.600
 difficulty 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:37.280
 Flame Beat Two Pop Rock There's a 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:40.040
 detail in this rhythm that is very 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:42.169
 important that at the very end of the sentence I 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:45.620
 I do not make it complete, I'll do two 

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:46.870
 knocks down in the sun 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:50.110
 [Music] 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:53.850
 and then change the king is bigger I make two 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:53.850
 knocks down is like that 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:59.150
 The end, right? 

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:09.470
 about the village 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:17.820
 and then I do to share the pace 

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:20.520
 then I do two down and sun 

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:23.820
 in the first part the exchange the real is 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:26.450
 bigger and I make two up and two 

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:26.450
 low like that 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:30.930
 It's going to stay that way. 

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:33.249
 [Music] 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:35.780
 i 

00:05:33.249 --> 00:05:40.580
 then this end always like this 2 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:45.340
 down 2 braking is after 2 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:45.340
 males and the other half 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:55.020
 That's good news. 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:55.020
 [Music] 

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:59.530
 drop 

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:14.110
 That's when I make Roberto. 

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:26.940
 [Music] 

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:26.940
 er and 2 with a lynx will be 

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:33.800
 saw with him safe it will be done now 

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:36.759
 it's fast good to choose said 

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:36.759
 will be 

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:43.120
 it's fair beauty is just that 

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:45.670
 you have to learn this division of 

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:47.770
 rhythm in there you do not get confused 

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:50.230
 embolando that if in the deposition I got 

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:51.880
 sing and it is very important to master the 

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:52.690
 pace to be able to sing and play at the same 

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:55.450
 time 

00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:57.640
