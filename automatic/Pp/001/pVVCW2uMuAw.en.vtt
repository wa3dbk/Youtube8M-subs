00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.210
 have your teachers come back to 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.029
 the classroom 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.250
 otherwise the salary will be discounted and this 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.530
 will affect the rise in the 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.590
 because there is no justification for 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.420
 to stop teachers 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.220
 I am governor in the history of this 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.310
 state that gave the largest salary increase to 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.449
 all teachers 60% increase 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.060
 salary 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.769
 I even believe that in Brazil there is not a 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.779
 governor a state that in the last 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.300
 four years of a larger increase than the 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:33.200
 Parana state time activity 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:36.630
 a great claim we guarantee 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:38.489
 75% increase, which is the period that the 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.070
 teachers are out of the classroom 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.390
 to correct evidence and prepare the 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.460
 next class 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.910
 we guarantee course recognition 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.379
 of the vizivali 30 thousand teachers 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:51.180
 have been anxiously awaiting the 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.579
 recognition of this course, our 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.559
 government recognized in six months 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.640
 improve the quality of food in the 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.129
 school lunch 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.570
 We triplicate the transfer to the mayors to 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.520
 school transportation 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.040
 all that was possible was done for the 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.409
 education, the greatest advances have been 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.229
 my government then demonstration of 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.869
 respect and appreciation of teachers and 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.090
 state servers was given in practice 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.520
 by my government and my 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.430
 personal commitment because we teachers 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.130
 there is an instrumentalization of this 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:26.070
 movement by political by 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.720
 cut by the app-union which is an arm 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.150
 workers' union 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.490
 who want the confrontation that wants a 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.600
 the governor's political 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.579
 are my opponents 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.689
 I ask teachers to go back to 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.600
 classroom 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:42.360
 otherwise the salary will be deducted it goes 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.689
 affect the rise of the career 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.689
 epa 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:57.150
 the one who voted was a provider and 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:02:01.010
 to hit is the one who voted 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:01.010
