you're<00:02:16.590> aiming<00:02:16.709> for<00:02:16.890> that<00:02:17.160> the<00:02:17.520> appeal<00:02:17.880> this

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
you're aiming for that the appeal this

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.110 
you're aiming for that the appeal this
is<00:02:18.840> the<00:02:18.959> kind<00:02:19.170> of<00:02:19.230> home<00:02:19.380> like<00:02:20.220> an<00:02:20.550> average<00:02:20.790> of

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
is the kind of home like an average of

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.900 
is the kind of home like an average of
8,000<00:02:21.780> points<00:02:21.959> for<00:02:22.680> the<00:02:22.740> character<00:02:23.250> so<00:02:23.850> you

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
8,000 points for the character so you

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:25.790 
8,000 points for the character so you
can<00:02:24.420> have<00:02:24.570> one<00:02:24.750> a<00:02:24.780> little<00:02:25.020> more<00:02:25.170> a<00:02:25.410> little<00:02:25.500> less

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
can have one a little more a little less

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.030 
can have one a little more a little less
but<00:02:26.180> if<00:02:27.180> you<00:02:27.300> get<00:02:27.420> 8,000<00:02:27.959> points<00:02:28.140> for<00:02:28.950> each

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
but if you get 8,000 points for each

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.430 
but if you get 8,000 points for each
character<00:02:29.340> then<00:02:29.790> you<00:02:30.030> get<00:02:30.270> 600<00:02:31.020> thousand

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
character then you get 600 thousand

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.820 
character then you get 600 thousand
points<00:02:31.830> for<00:02:31.890> the<00:02:32.400> mission
