simple kind of a frozen yogurt thing

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.840 
simple kind of a frozen yogurt thing
it's<00:00:15.360> based<00:00:15.599> on<00:00:15.839> any<00:00:16.529> kind<00:00:16.619> of<00:00:16.920> frozen<00:00:17.550> berry

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
it's based on any kind of frozen berry

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.390 
it's based on any kind of frozen berry
in<00:00:18.119> this<00:00:18.449> case<00:00:18.630> it's<00:00:18.810> blueberries<00:00:19.400> good

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
in this case it's blueberries good

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
quality yogurt and sugar and the idea is

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.710 
quality yogurt and sugar and the idea is
that<00:00:24.840> use<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:25.470> cold<00:00:26.310> from<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:27.119> berries<00:00:27.420> to

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
that use the cold from the berries to

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.900 
that use the cold from the berries to
freeze<00:00:27.990> the<00:00:28.410> other<00:00:28.560> ingredients<00:00:29.279> by<00:00:29.640> mixing

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
freeze the other ingredients by mixing

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.910 
freeze the other ingredients by mixing
them<00:00:30.210> together<00:00:30.330> in<00:00:30.750> a<00:00:30.900> food<00:00:31.320> processor<00:00:31.470> like

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
them together in a food processor like

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.860 
them together in a food processor like
this<00:00:32.070> one<00:00:32.250> it's<00:00:33.000> important<00:00:33.420> that<00:00:33.450> all<00:00:33.719> of

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
this one it's important that all of

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.720 
this one it's important that all of
these<00:00:33.960> ingredients<00:00:34.260> are<00:00:34.649> nice<00:00:35.070> and<00:00:35.340> cold

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
these ingredients are nice and cold

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.670 
these ingredients are nice and cold
otherwise<00:00:36.480> it's<00:00:36.899> difficult<00:00:37.380> to<00:00:37.469> get<00:00:37.559> the

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
otherwise it's difficult to get the

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.220 
otherwise it's difficult to get the
right<00:00:37.829> texture<00:00:38.160> in<00:00:38.370> them<00:00:38.550> I<00:00:39.110> start<00:00:40.110> with

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
right texture in them I start with

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.970 
right texture in them I start with
putting<00:00:40.350> their<00:00:40.620> berries<00:00:40.890> in<00:00:42.649> one<00:00:43.649> thing<00:00:43.860> when

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
putting their berries in one thing when

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.830 
putting their berries in one thing when
you<00:00:44.070> do<00:00:44.190> this<00:00:44.309> is<00:00:44.520> that<00:00:44.670> you<00:00:44.789> have<00:00:45.420> to<00:00:45.539> do<00:00:45.629> like

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
you do this is that you have to do like

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.080 
you do this is that you have to do like
a<00:00:46.079> little<00:00:46.350> bit<00:00:46.469> they<00:00:46.590> can't<00:00:46.770> be<00:00:46.950> can't<00:00:47.820> be<00:00:47.969> as

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
a little bit they can't be can't be as

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.430 
a little bit they can't be can't be as
the<00:00:48.239> hundred<00:00:48.570> milliliters<00:00:48.989> of<00:00:49.079> various<00:00:49.379> or

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
the hundred milliliters of various or

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.920 
the hundred milliliters of various or
anything<00:00:49.620> like<00:00:49.770> that<00:00:49.829> because<00:00:50.100> then<00:00:50.399> we<00:00:50.930> the

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
anything like that because then we the

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.600 
anything like that because then we the
cold<00:00:52.199> in<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.559> berries<00:00:52.829> won't<00:00:53.010> be<00:00:53.129> enough<00:00:53.340> to

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
cold in the berries won't be enough to

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.520 
cold in the berries won't be enough to
cool<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:53.940> whole<00:00:54.059> container<00:00:54.390> and<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:55.050> yogurt

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
cool the whole container and the yogurt

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:56.930 
cool the whole container and the yogurt
so<00:00:55.649> it<00:00:55.710> needs<00:00:55.860> to<00:00:56.010> be<00:00:56.129> a<00:00:56.160> bit<00:00:56.370> like<00:00:56.550> offered<00:00:56.850> to

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
so it needs to be a bit like offered to

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.569 
so it needs to be a bit like offered to
you<00:00:57.030> though<00:00:57.149> berries<00:00:57.480> or<00:00:57.629> something<00:00:58.489> for<00:00:59.489> it

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
you though berries or something for it

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:06.620 
you though berries or something for it
to<00:00:59.640> work<00:01:02.300> some<00:01:03.300> sugar<00:01:03.600> and<00:01:05.510> depending<00:01:06.510> on

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
to work some sugar and depending on

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.510 
to work some sugar and depending on
which<00:01:07.200> kind<00:01:07.380> of<00:01:07.500> berry<00:01:07.710> use<00:01:08.040> you<00:01:08.280> need

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
which kind of berry use you need

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.700 
which kind of berry use you need
different<00:01:08.760> amounts<00:01:09.210> of<00:01:09.299> sugar<00:01:09.540> so<00:01:09.750> I<00:01:09.960> like<00:01:10.560> it

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
different amounts of sugar so I like it

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.730 
different amounts of sugar so I like it
to<00:01:10.830> be<00:01:10.860> not<00:01:11.159> too<00:01:11.369> sweet<00:01:11.640> so<00:01:11.670> it's<00:01:12.119> a<00:01:12.240> little<00:01:12.479> bit

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
to be not too sweet so it's a little bit

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.789 
to be not too sweet so it's a little bit
if<00:01:13.740> this<00:01:13.950> was<00:01:14.159> like<00:01:14.790> a<00:01:14.820> citrus<00:01:15.270> fruit<00:01:15.299> or<00:01:15.799> more

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
if this was like a citrus fruit or more

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.469 
if this was like a citrus fruit or more
tart<00:01:17.040> berry<00:01:17.250> I<00:01:17.430> would<00:01:17.640> add<00:01:17.759> more<00:01:17.970> and<00:01:18.150> if<00:01:18.299> this

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
tart berry I would add more and if this

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.630 
tart berry I would add more and if this
was<00:01:18.689> a<00:01:18.720> very<00:01:18.960> sweet<00:01:19.140> berry<00:01:19.500> like<00:01:19.680> a<00:01:19.740> black

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
was a very sweet berry like a black

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.429 
was a very sweet berry like a black
cherry<00:01:20.970> or<00:01:21.330> a<00:01:21.360> raspberry<00:01:21.990> or<00:01:22.080> something<00:01:22.380> like

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
cherry or a raspberry or something like

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.890 
cherry or a raspberry or something like
that<00:01:22.500> that<00:01:22.650> would<00:01:22.830> add<00:01:22.950> a<00:01:22.979> little<00:01:23.130> less<00:01:23.780> so<00:01:24.780> the

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
that that would add a little less so the

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.330 
that that would add a little less so the
yogurt<00:01:25.200> you<00:01:25.380> want<00:01:25.530> to<00:01:25.619> use<00:01:25.770> for<00:01:25.950> this

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
yogurt you want to use for this

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.370 
yogurt you want to use for this
it<00:01:26.610> shouldn't<00:01:26.939> be<00:01:27.150> too<00:01:27.720> runny<00:01:27.960> it<00:01:28.140> shouldn't

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
it shouldn't be too runny it shouldn't

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.960 
it shouldn't be too runny it shouldn't
be<00:01:28.470> like<00:01:28.650> a<00:01:28.680> drinkable<00:01:29.100> yogurt<00:01:29.220> it<00:01:29.670> shouldn't

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
be like a drinkable yogurt it shouldn't

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.060 
be like a drinkable yogurt it shouldn't
be<00:01:30.450> too<00:01:30.600> dry<00:01:30.810> either<00:01:30.840> like<00:01:31.409> a<00:01:31.439> Greek<00:01:31.770> yogurt

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
be too dry either like a Greek yogurt

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.920 
be too dry either like a Greek yogurt
would<00:01:32.220> be<00:01:32.310> too<00:01:32.490> thick<00:01:32.700> it<00:01:33.509> should<00:01:33.659> be<00:01:33.780> as<00:01:33.900> a

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
would be too thick it should be as a

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.140 
would be too thick it should be as a
sort<00:01:34.350> of<00:01:34.439> ordinary<00:01:34.799> plain<00:01:35.250> yogurt<00:01:35.640> with<00:01:35.790> three

or four percent some fat or something
like<00:01:37.740> that<00:01:37.799> like<00:01:38.610> about<00:01:38.909> half<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.750> amount<00:01:39.960> of

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
like that like about half the amount of

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.530 
like that like about half the amount of
your<00:01:40.350> virgin<00:01:40.619> relation<00:01:41.250> to<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.610> amount<00:01:42.329> of

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
your virgin relation to the amount of

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.440 
your virgin relation to the amount of
area<00:01:42.780> should<00:01:42.960> be<00:01:43.170> kind<00:01:43.829> of<00:01:43.950> enough<00:01:44.360> maybe<00:01:45.360> a

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
area should be kind of enough maybe a

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.870 
area should be kind of enough maybe a
little<00:01:45.659> bit<00:01:45.750> more<00:01:45.930> sugar<00:01:48.259> now<00:01:49.259> I<00:01:49.590> will<00:01:50.040> process

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
little bit more sugar now I will process

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.539 
little bit more sugar now I will process
this<00:01:51.030> on<00:01:51.270> quite<00:01:52.110> high<00:01:52.259> speed<00:01:52.619> just<00:01:53.340> long

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
this on quite high speed just long

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.609 
this on quite high speed just long
enough<00:01:53.579> to<00:01:53.790> see<00:01:54.390> to<00:01:54.720> that<00:01:54.840> there<00:01:54.990> are<00:01:55.020> no<00:01:55.259> like

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
enough to see to that there are no like

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.469 
enough to see to that there are no like
too<00:01:55.829> large<00:01:56.100> chunks<00:01:56.610> or<00:01:56.729> frozen<00:01:56.909> berry<00:01:57.240> left

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
too large chunks or frozen berry left

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.510 
too large chunks or frozen berry left
because<00:01:57.719> that's<00:01:57.840> not<00:01:57.960> very<00:01:58.079> pleasant<00:01:58.290> but<00:01:58.649> the

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
because that's not very pleasant but the

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.069 
because that's not very pleasant but the
longer<00:01:59.790> a<00:01:59.820> makes<00:02:00.060> it<00:02:00.210> the<00:02:00.420> more<00:02:00.600> liquid<00:02:00.780> is

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
longer a makes it the more liquid is

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:01.999 
longer a makes it the more liquid is
going<00:02:01.170> to<00:02:01.259> be<00:02:01.350> because<00:02:01.530> it<00:02:01.710> heats<00:02:01.829> up

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
going to be because it heats up

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.890 
going to be because it heats up
basically

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:04.900 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.380 

[Applause]

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
[Applause]

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:08.749 
[Applause]
[Music]

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
[Music]

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:18.020 
[Music]
a<00:02:11.689> little<00:02:12.689> bit<00:02:12.780> longer<00:02:16.459> yeah<00:02:17.459> I<00:02:17.670> think<00:02:17.909> that

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
a little bit longer yeah I think that

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.080 
a little bit longer yeah I think that
should<00:02:18.180> be<00:02:18.239> enough<00:02:19.220> yeah<00:02:20.220> so<00:02:20.370> now<00:02:20.459> it's<00:02:20.610> done

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
should be enough yeah so now it's done

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.690 
should be enough yeah so now it's done
mixin<00:02:21.450> it<00:02:21.599> has<00:02:21.870> no<00:02:22.049> two<00:02:22.349> big<00:02:22.560> chunks<00:02:22.920> of<00:02:23.069> berry

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
mixin it has no two big chunks of berry

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.420 
mixin it has no two big chunks of berry
still<00:02:24.000> in<00:02:24.120> it<00:02:24.239> and<00:02:24.360> it's<00:02:24.959> nice<00:02:25.319> and<00:02:25.349> frozen<00:02:25.680> I'm

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
still in it and it's nice and frozen I'm

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.839 
still in it and it's nice and frozen I'm
just<00:02:26.579> gonna<00:02:26.790> scoop<00:02:27.329> some<00:02:27.569> without<00:02:27.870> like<00:02:28.079> this

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:28.849 
just gonna scoop some without like this

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:31.100 
just gonna scoop some without like this
you<00:02:29.849> could<00:02:30.030> store<00:02:30.299> this<00:02:30.569> for<00:02:30.780> a<00:02:30.840> little<00:02:31.019> while

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
you could store this for a little while

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:32.869 
you could store this for a little while
in<00:02:31.409> the<00:02:31.470> freezer<00:02:31.860> take<00:02:32.310> it<00:02:32.459> out<00:02:32.549> like<00:02:32.700> ice

00:02:32.869 --> 00:02:32.879 
in the freezer take it out like ice

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:34.640 
in the freezer take it out like ice
cream<00:02:33.150> but<00:02:33.299> it's<00:02:33.480> really<00:02:33.659> like<00:02:34.319> there's<00:02:34.500> no

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
cream but it's really like there's no

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.229 
cream but it's really like there's no
point<00:02:34.950> in<00:02:35.220> doing<00:02:35.400> that<00:02:35.640> because<00:02:35.849> it's<00:02:36.120> gonna

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
point in doing that because it's gonna

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:38.479 
point in doing that because it's gonna
be<00:02:36.420> at<00:02:36.629> its<00:02:36.840> most<00:02:36.989> delicious<00:02:37.530> when<00:02:38.159> it's<00:02:38.189> just

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
be at its most delicious when it's just

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:41.330 
be at its most delicious when it's just
made<00:02:38.730> and<00:02:39.090> it's<00:02:39.599> so<00:02:39.810> quick<00:02:40.379> to<00:02:40.650> produce<00:02:40.890> so

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
made and it's so quick to produce so

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.069 
made and it's so quick to produce so
there's<00:02:41.760> really<00:02:41.940> no<00:02:42.120> point<00:02:42.329> in<00:02:42.569> doing<00:02:42.780> it<00:02:42.930> the

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:43.079 
there's really no point in doing it the

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:49.129 
there's really no point in doing it the
landside<00:02:43.530> room<00:02:47.299> what's<00:02:48.299> quite<00:02:48.569> special<00:02:48.989> with

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:49.139 
landside room what's quite special with

00:02:49.139 --> 00:02:50.899 
landside room what's quite special with
the<00:02:49.290> using<00:02:49.590> this<00:02:49.680> technique<00:02:50.040> is<00:02:50.250> that<00:02:50.280> like

00:02:50.899 --> 00:02:50.909 
the using this technique is that like

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:53.479 
the using this technique is that like
it's<00:02:51.060> very<00:02:51.209> fast<00:02:51.450> of<00:02:51.629> course<00:02:51.659> but<00:02:52.049> because<00:02:52.829> you

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
it's very fast of course but because you

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:55.789 
it's very fast of course but because you
have<00:02:53.700> the<00:02:54.299> sugar<00:02:54.569> straight<00:02:55.049> into<00:02:55.379> the<00:02:55.440> mixture

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:55.799 
have the sugar straight into the mixture

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:58.160 
have the sugar straight into the mixture
and<00:02:55.950> it's<00:02:56.400> frozen<00:02:56.639> it<00:02:57.060> has<00:02:57.209> no<00:02:57.389> time<00:02:57.659> to<00:02:57.959> really

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
and it's frozen it has no time to really

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.710 
and it's frozen it has no time to really
be<00:02:58.379> solved<00:02:58.739> so<00:02:58.889> you'll<00:02:59.010> have<00:02:59.159> a<00:02:59.220> little<00:02:59.720> almost

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
be solved so you'll have a little almost

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.300 
be solved so you'll have a little almost
crying<00:03:00.930> she<00:03:01.170> should<00:03:01.440> go<00:03:01.530> you're<00:03:01.709> feeling<00:03:02.040> into

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
crying she should go you're feeling into

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.069 
crying she should go you're feeling into
it<00:03:02.340> and<00:03:02.489> it's<00:03:02.609> going<00:03:02.700> to<00:03:02.790> be<00:03:02.879> nice<00:03:03.569> and<00:03:03.599> torque

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:04.079 
it and it's going to be nice and torque

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:07.310 
it and it's going to be nice and torque
from<00:03:04.349> the<00:03:04.500> blueberries<00:03:05.010> as<00:03:05.129> well
