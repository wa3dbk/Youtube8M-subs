00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:27.259
 so we're going to have a joke 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:28.609
 find back excuse me on this 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:30.770
 bo3 you know that for the moment 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:32.300
 lucifron leads his first game and makes 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:33.800
 interesting that I said offer this is 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.000
 precisely for this kind of game that I 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.300
 think that lucifron really has his 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.550
 odds 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.960
 here it was not very 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.400
 coherent what did we do with all 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.360
 the aspects of course that I have 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.830
 for them for this player 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.110
 yeah but it's a shame to see him 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:47.480
 do things that make it on one side 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:51.140
 can we can rent it was original this 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:53.690
 he did it's original and it comes out 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.910
 off the beaten track but it has become 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:59.090
 burst because double forged board 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:01.579
 twilight that opens you up as 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.170
 proto a tehran timing he had 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:05.030
 scouts and besides because he had seen 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.800
 his medivac who had no third 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:10.070
 orbital station he knew that the push 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.390
 arrived and he finally said to himself frankly 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.649
 he took a huge risk when he 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.210
 said to myself I'll succeed the forcefield 

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:16.429
 and I'm going to kill him hitched cars 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.140
 forcefields i mean dad the charge 

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:20.420
 tapas your troops are not a heap 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.520
 rook used by loads so there 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:25.130
 also gritti what's any game about the ultra 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.200
 credit it was hot finally I 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.209
 to mean him lemon it's not it's not 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.860
 like he was playing good half because 

00:01:29.209 --> 00:01:32.660
 for example you see of course he goes 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.929
 win at the end here is for example 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:37.970
 when we play against us I 

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:39.800
 would understand but against lucifron when 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.959
 even it was one of the editions 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.310
 making quite a random rack that this 

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:44.450
 for its borders are recognized on 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:48.080
 roanne has no ceasefire 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:50.060
 this shot yeah and and lucifron who 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.440
 will defeat his veil quickly yeah 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.149
 previous he had done the same thing 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.979
 I'm sorry I'm confused with his tvz 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:56.539
 it is in tvz that it by the myths 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:59.479
 systematically its strength 

00:01:56.539 --> 00:02:02.750
 yeah go m6 that will cost the prod 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:04.520
 and who will see that the wall is closed and 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.560
 and then we will see 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.239
 what will m6 offer us 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.429
 maybe a more gaming style 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:13.550
 conventional I must say that I the 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:15.770
 do not see too much m6 do one do one 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:18.860
 strat an all-in where he misses a small 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:21.230
 little chelou in these configurations or a 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.690
 4gates you see since he is 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.310
 led 1 to 0 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.450
 I think he'll go get a 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.580
 conventional range you do not think 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.720
 inevitably I was going to say in my opinion to me 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.849
 I feel good even if you are on a small 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.349
 little headache what I ask the 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:34.250
 nexus after the cybernetic body I 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:35.840
 add three gates 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.750
 and then with my four gates I put 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.189
 a pressure on a show at the micro g g 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.239
 the backdoor so to the stones I can 

00:02:40.189 --> 00:02:42.439
 go tickle him to force him 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:45.290
 really impose some bunkers a little 

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:46.760
 everywhere leaves after face b 3 me I the 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.819
 will feel more like this now 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:52.700
 to be honest i really have no no 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:54.109
 element to switch so I do not know 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.010
 not on everything even if it's more like 

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:57.290
 you said it's a player who is my 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.150
 damage he can do everything and in any case 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.159

 tomorrow morning it's true it was necessary 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.880
 frankly we have to rest what 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.950

 finally you go to his services to be 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:35.290
 misinterpreted but indeed it's true 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:36.580
 that but hey it's still as much a 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.290
 pleasure to comment on gays but that 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:40.030
 is always as happy to see that 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.200
 you are still so many and that 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.040
 and we are not the only ones 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.900
 I even saw that there were four 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.160
 today they were and 4 it was 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.260
 still excellent we will stay in 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:49.540
 the game but just to tell you this is 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.370
 an excellent one to see that make it to his 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.739
 foot what they scream son is happy 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:54.849
 and they broke satie of ghetto that's 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:57.010
 really nice bar of lions who 

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:58.510
 have succeeded like that and they keep a 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:00.519
 such simple pleasure from the things of the 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:01.989
 life you feel he's happy to go 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:04.120
 in the skin do you camer was 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:06.549
 not gone well that everyone and I 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:09.220
 find it great finally it's good 

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:10.989
 life lessons to see that here that 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.650
 sometimes it's on the news we see 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:15.220
 always negative things 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.870
 unfortunately yes it is really 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.220
 very cool 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:21.760
 he is really interested in electronics 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:23.979
 and especially at starcraft 2 not finally 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.330
 frankly that we knew yesterday that he was going 

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:25.960
 move on today and that made us 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.870
 great pleasure 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:32.169
 yeah lucifron is gone on a rac and 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:33.550
 two orbital stations so the bo is 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:34.539
 maybe a little mind game in there 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:36.580
 you see what I mean the exact 

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:39.070
 Gender is what you're afraid of what I 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.539
 am going to do what I'm going to attack head 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:42.520
 I was a bit traumatized at the game 

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:44.979
 from before is there behind you see that his 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:48.130
 share much more hang me lucifron 

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:49.510
 so there he will not attack in my opinion 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:51.639
 his goal is not to attack on two 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:53.229
 bases and behind that's it and that's 

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:56.139
 pity moreover what this one does 

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:57.729
 and if we look at it and it's well played 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:05:00.220
 the share of the prices there it is necessary that you us 

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:03.580
 watches the vision of vcs that vails vcs 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:05.560
 but beware the veterinarian zealot 2 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:07.570
 stalker has and still sees he sees 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:08.670
 still classes between the 15th and the 

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:10.620
 web 

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:13.110
 but he did not shun branch that's it 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:15.300
 the units are on b2 by cons he did not 

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:16.230
 not seen the nexus not be afraid and baptized 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.730
 is returned the scan 

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:21.450
 but here oh la la la la vision of 

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:23.010
 marine mani mani here he is pro he has 

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:24.540
 of success 

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:25.800
 he still has success yeah 

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:27.540
 but for me that's what was explained 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:29.010
 is it for them that chance you provocation 

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:30.480
 and casually he went to get 

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:32.790
 the citizens nikkei nation 

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:34.530
 I do not see the nexus that you arrive and 

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:36.210
 keeping tongue still get to a 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:38.100
 moment I still gaiety what's that 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:39.780
 serves that that's it that's two of 

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:41.220
 thales and the quests that ends ok 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:44.730
 it is in this sense that worries he goes 

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:46.920
 see p he will be worth pdj on the left 

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:48.060
 in principle, it does not surprise me 

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:49.500
 as if they leave on there 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:51.330
 there that you were severe it's tape 

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:52.740
 a big assault he knows he has a 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:54.720
 big micro lucifron is not left behind 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:56.820
 on it but fifth if that's when 

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:58.050
 even very good job a big one 

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:59.820
 status experience and the backdoor that 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:00.090
 waiting for you it's going to be hot it's going to be 

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:02.700
 hot 

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:04.440
 is lucifron able to 

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:07.380
 defend to beat once for me and 

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:09.720
 will control pope did not lift 3 I 

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:12.240
 think it can it can defend itself 

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:13.860

 deposits to prevent the passage of 

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:21.450
 decision makers even though we have very few 

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:22.860
 warriors who are well placed for 

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:24.660
 avoid the forces and the tension has not 

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:27.240
