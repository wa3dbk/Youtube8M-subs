different<00:02:59.340> kind<00:02:59.519> of<00:02:59.610> look<00:02:59.850> and<00:03:00.030> it<00:03:00.120> stands<00:03:00.480> out

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
different kind of look and it stands out

different kind of look and it stands out
from<00:03:00.690> all<00:03:01.110> other<00:03:01.290> gaming<00:03:01.620> mice<00:03:01.920> let's<00:03:02.489> take<00:03:02.670> a

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
from all other gaming mice let's take a

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.520 
from all other gaming mice let's take a
look<00:03:02.910> at<00:03:03.060> the<00:03:03.150> bottom<00:03:03.360> of<00:03:03.569> the<00:03:03.720> mouse<00:03:03.870> we<00:03:04.350> have

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
look at the bottom of the mouse we have

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.560 
look at the bottom of the mouse we have
our<00:03:04.680> laser<00:03:04.980> sensor<00:03:05.489> it<00:03:05.670> works<00:03:05.850> on<00:03:06.030> all<00:03:06.239> kinds

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
our laser sensor it works on all kinds

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.120 
our laser sensor it works on all kinds
of<00:03:06.630> surfaces<00:03:07.109> that<00:03:07.320> the<00:03:07.470> optical<00:03:08.010> mouse

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.130 
of surfaces that the optical mouse

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.430 
of surfaces that the optical mouse
cannot<00:03:08.640> work<00:03:08.850> I<00:03:09.030> really<00:03:09.660> like<00:03:09.840> the<00:03:10.019> laser

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
cannot work I really like the laser

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.890 
cannot work I really like the laser
option<00:03:10.980> better<00:03:11.190> so<00:03:11.549> this<00:03:11.790> mouse<00:03:12.030> is<00:03:12.060> perfect

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
option better so this mouse is perfect

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.630 
option better so this mouse is perfect
for<00:03:13.079> me<00:03:13.200> the<00:03:13.440> sensitivity<00:03:14.130> of<00:03:14.160> the<00:03:14.430> laser

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
for me the sensitivity of the laser

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
for me the sensitivity of the laser
engine<00:03:15.209> is<00:03:16.010> 8200<00:03:17.010> CPI<00:03:17.430> that<00:03:17.790> is<00:03:18.090> very<00:03:18.359> fast

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
engine is 8200 CPI that is very fast

practicing more so then you get to gain

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.160 
practicing more so then you get to gain
more<00:04:04.700> advantage<00:04:05.300> from<00:04:05.569> the<00:04:05.690> mouse<00:04:05.840> I<00:04:05.989> will
