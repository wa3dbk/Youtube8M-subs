mineral line of the Terran player so
there's<00:01:55.619> a<00:01:55.680> lot<00:01:56.009> of<00:01:56.070> different<00:01:56.460> strategies

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
there's a lot of different strategies

there's a lot of different strategies
that<00:01:57.149> Protoss<00:01:57.600> can<00:01:57.810> use<00:01:57.960> against<00:01:58.560> terran<00:01:59.149> and

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
that Protoss can use against terran and

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.539 
that Protoss can use against terran and
I'm<00:02:00.299> interested<00:02:00.689> to<00:02:00.719> see<00:02:00.810> how<00:02:01.409> foxer<00:02:02.070> is<00:02:02.250> going

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
I'm interested to see how foxer is going

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.850 
I'm interested to see how foxer is going
to<00:02:02.670> respond<00:02:03.060> to<00:02:03.240> that<00:02:03.360> in<00:02:03.630> kind<00:02:04.020> it<00:02:04.259> looks<00:02:04.770> like

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
to respond to that in kind it looks like

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.249 
to respond to that in kind it looks like
he<00:02:05.189> has<00:02:05.399> already<00:02:05.640> wow<00:02:06.030> that<00:02:06.270> is<00:02:06.299> a<00:02:06.450> very<00:02:06.930> early

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
he has already wow that is a very early

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.589 
he has already wow that is a very early
second<00:02:07.770> supply<00:02:07.950> depot<00:02:08.340> why<00:02:08.550> is<00:02:08.610> why<00:02:09.300> does<00:02:09.509> he

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
second supply depot why is why does he

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.960 
second supply depot why is why does he
have<00:02:09.690> such<00:02:09.899> a<00:02:09.929> supply<00:02:10.709> depot<00:02:10.739> out<00:02:11.220> he's

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
have such a supply depot out he's

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.370 
have such a supply depot out he's
actually<00:02:12.150> look<00:02:12.629> at<00:02:12.720> that<00:02:12.840> 17

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
actually look at that 17

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.820 
actually look at that 17
over<00:02:13.650> 20<00:02:13.980> under<00:02:14.250> 27<00:02:15.030> so<00:02:15.630> that<00:02:15.990> is<00:02:16.170> an<00:02:16.380> uber

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
over 20 under 27 so that is an uber

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.920 
over 20 under 27 so that is an uber
early<00:02:17.010> supply<00:02:17.550> depot<00:02:17.850> and<00:02:18.000> I<00:02:18.060> really<00:02:18.690> really

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
early supply depot and I really really

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.420 
early supply depot and I really really
don't<00:02:19.080> know<00:02:19.230> why<00:02:19.500> he<00:02:19.680> threw<00:02:19.860> that<00:02:19.950> up<00:02:20.010> so<00:02:20.280> early

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
don't know why he threw that up so early

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.150 
don't know why he threw that up so early
it<00:02:21.030> looks<00:02:21.300> like<00:02:21.570> foxer<00:02:22.500> will<00:02:22.680> be<00:02:22.800> going<00:02:23.040> from

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
it looks like foxer will be going from

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.490 
it looks like foxer will be going from
the<00:02:23.340> second<00:02:23.760> assimilator<00:02:24.210> here<00:02:24.510> before<00:02:25.320> the

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
the second assimilator here before the

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.080 
the second assimilator here before the
second<00:02:25.890> gateway<00:02:26.040> finishes<00:02:26.550> so<00:02:26.700> that<00:02:26.880> is<00:02:27.060> a

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
second gateway finishes so that is a

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.760 
second gateway finishes so that is a
telltale<00:02:27.540> sign<00:02:27.570> that<00:02:27.810> he<00:02:28.080> will<00:02:28.230> be<00:02:28.350> going<00:02:28.620> for

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
telltale sign that he will be going for

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.280 
telltale sign that he will be going for
early<00:02:29.130> tech<00:02:29.460> either<00:02:30.240> gonna<00:02:30.420> see<00:02:30.660> a<00:02:30.690> fast

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
early tech either gonna see a fast

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.970 
early tech either gonna see a fast
Stargate<00:02:32.420> possibly<00:02:33.420> a<00:02:33.630> for<00:02:34.380> gate<00:02:34.560> push<00:02:34.770> with

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
Stargate possibly a for gate push with

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.130 
Stargate possibly a for gate push with
mass<00:02:35.280> century<00:02:35.880> stalker<00:02:36.270> but<00:02:36.600> I<00:02:36.660> really<00:02:36.990> don't

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
mass century stalker but I really don't

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.470 
mass century stalker but I really don't
think<00:02:37.170> that's<00:02:37.440> going<00:02:37.590> to<00:02:37.650> be<00:02:37.740> the<00:02:37.860> case<00:02:38.480> warp

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
think that's going to be the case warp

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.480 
think that's going to be the case warp
gate<00:02:39.660> obviously<00:02:40.230> going<00:02:40.770> down<00:02:41.040> right<00:02:41.280> when<00:02:41.430> the

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:41.490 
gate obviously going down right when the

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:43.010 
gate obviously going down right when the
cybernetics<00:02:41.970> core<00:02:42.150> finishes<00:02:42.540> and<00:02:42.720> that<00:02:42.870> it's

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
cybernetics core finishes and that it's

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.380 
cybernetics core finishes and that it's
really<00:02:43.350> standard<00:02:44.070> for<00:02:44.670> Protoss<00:02:44.970> players<00:02:45.270> as

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
really standard for Protoss players as

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.660 
really standard for Protoss players as
soon<00:02:45.570> as<00:02:45.690> cybernetics<00:02:46.530> core<00:02:46.740> finishes<00:02:47.250> you

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:47.670 
soon as cybernetics core finishes you

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:49.610 
soon as cybernetics core finishes you
get<00:02:47.880> warp<00:02:48.120> gate<00:02:48.330> it's<00:02:48.540> the<00:02:48.780> best<00:02:49.080> upgrade<00:02:49.500> in

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
get warp gate it's the best upgrade in

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.940 
get warp gate it's the best upgrade in
the<00:02:49.710> game<00:02:49.920> for<00:02:50.220> 50<00:02:50.550> 50<00:02:50.940> mm<00:02:51.840> I<00:02:51.990> guess<00:02:52.560> it's<00:02:52.740> next

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
the game for 50 50 mm I guess it's next

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.140 
the game for 50 50 mm I guess it's next
to<00:02:53.070> concussive<00:02:53.370> shells<00:02:53.610> concussive<00:02:53.970> shells

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.030 
to concussive shells concussive shells
is<00:02:54.300> a<00:02:54.330> very<00:02:54.570> very<00:02:54.720> good<00:02:54.900> upgrade<00:02:55.080> for<00:02:55.350> 50<00:02:55.650> 50<00:02:55.950> as

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
is a very very good upgrade for 50 50 as

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.270 
is a very very good upgrade for 50 50 as
well<00:02:56.310> but<00:02:57.030> warp<00:02:57.390> gate<00:02:57.600> is<00:02:57.780> extremely<00:02:58.680> good<00:02:58.950> and

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
well but warp gate is extremely good and

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.940 
well but warp gate is extremely good and
it's<00:03:00.060> it'll<00:03:00.900> it'll<00:03:01.320> be<00:03:01.470> interesting<00:03:01.680> to<00:03:01.860> see

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
it's it'll it'll be interesting to see

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.850 
it's it'll it'll be interesting to see
what<00:03:02.310> what<00:03:03.120> tests<00:03:03.450> are<00:03:03.540> decides<00:03:03.930> to<00:03:04.080> do<00:03:04.260> with

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
what what tests are decides to do with

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.680 
what what tests are decides to do with
that<00:03:04.890> work<00:03:05.280> day<00:03:05.430> tech<00:03:05.640> it<00:03:05.760> looks<00:03:05.910> like<00:03:06.090> foxer

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
that work day tech it looks like foxer

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.210 
that work day tech it looks like foxer
here<00:03:06.870> will<00:03:07.020> be<00:03:07.110> going<00:03:07.380> for<00:03:07.590> the<00:03:07.740> command

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
here will be going for the command

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.550 
here will be going for the command
center<00:03:08.430> and<00:03:08.850> will<00:03:09.390> be<00:03:09.480> throwing<00:03:09.840> down<00:03:10.020> the<00:03:10.290> to

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
center and will be throwing down the to

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.070 
center and will be throwing down the to
barracks<00:03:10.950> for<00:03:11.250> security<00:03:11.850> purposes<00:03:12.360> to<00:03:12.870> make

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
barracks for security purposes to make

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.840 
barracks for security purposes to make
sure<00:03:13.200> you<00:03:13.290> can<00:03:13.410> defend<00:03:13.680> against<00:03:14.010> that<00:03:14.070> defend

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
sure you can defend against that defend

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.380 
sure you can defend against that defend
against<00:03:15.060> any<00:03:15.240> attack<00:03:15.630> on<00:03:15.900> his<00:03:16.440> command<00:03:16.890> center

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390 
against any attack on his command center

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:20.480 
against any attack on his command center
so<00:03:18.390> foxer<00:03:19.230> will<00:03:19.410> be<00:03:19.530> going<00:03:19.770> for<00:03:19.920> the<00:03:20.010> standard

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:20.490 
so foxer will be going for the standard

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:23.000 
so foxer will be going for the standard
marine<00:03:21.030> marauder<00:03:21.300> build<00:03:21.810> and<00:03:22.110> no<00:03:22.680> doubt<00:03:22.830> we'll

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
marine marauder build and no doubt we'll

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:24.350 
marine marauder build and no doubt we'll
be<00:03:23.040> seeing<00:03:23.160> some<00:03:23.520> drop<00:03:23.730> ships<00:03:23.970> come<00:03:24.120> in<00:03:24.150> and

be seeing some drop ships come in and

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.120 
be seeing some drop ships come in and
play<00:03:24.480> very<00:03:24.840> very<00:03:25.080> soon<00:03:25.230> as<00:03:25.410> well<00:03:25.560> we<00:03:25.710> also<00:03:25.860> have

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
play very very soon as well we also have

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.250 
play very very soon as well we also have
do<00:03:26.580> note<00:03:26.760> a<00:03:26.910> probe<00:03:27.300> chillin<00:03:27.780> right<00:03:27.900> here<00:03:28.110> at

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
do note a probe chillin right here at

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:29.930 
do note a probe chillin right here at
the<00:03:28.380> top<00:03:28.620> ledge<00:03:28.830> and<00:03:29.040> this<00:03:29.190> is<00:03:29.280> exactly<00:03:29.640> what

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
the top ledge and this is exactly what

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.910 
the top ledge and this is exactly what
I'm<00:03:30.030> talking<00:03:30.060> about<00:03:30.390> this<00:03:30.930> probe<00:03:31.320> can<00:03:31.530> warp<00:03:31.800> in

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
I'm talking about this probe can warp in

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.740 
I'm talking about this probe can warp in
that<00:03:32.130> pylon<00:03:32.580> and<00:03:32.790> then<00:03:33.210> he<00:03:33.300> can<00:03:33.390> apply

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
that pylon and then he can apply

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.020 
that pylon and then he can apply
pressure<00:03:34.020> with<00:03:34.380> before<00:03:35.190> gate<00:03:35.400> or<00:03:35.640> with<00:03:35.820> any

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
pressure with before gate or with any

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:37.670 
pressure with before gate or with any
gate<00:03:36.300> really<00:03:36.510> you<00:03:36.690> can<00:03:36.810> warp<00:03:37.050> in<00:03:37.170> units<00:03:37.410> up<00:03:37.560> on

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
gate really you can warp in units up on

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.230 
gate really you can warp in units up on
this<00:03:37.800> ledge<00:03:37.980> and<00:03:38.190> then<00:03:38.310> do<00:03:38.490> some<00:03:38.700> damage<00:03:38.850> into

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:39.240 
this ledge and then do some damage into

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:41.960 
this ledge and then do some damage into
the<00:03:39.330> mineral<00:03:39.570> line<00:03:39.720> so<00:03:40.380> do<00:03:40.770> do<00:03:41.160> watch<00:03:41.370> out<00:03:41.670> for

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
the mineral line so do do watch out for

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.330 
the mineral line so do do watch out for
that<00:03:42.000> boxer<00:03:42.540> if<00:03:43.320> Fox<00:03:43.650> are<00:03:43.800> good<00:03:43.890> hear<00:03:44.070> me<00:03:44.160> right

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
that boxer if Fox are good hear me right

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:45.500 
that boxer if Fox are good hear me right
now<00:03:44.459> I'm<00:03:44.640> sure<00:03:44.880> he<00:03:45.000> would<00:03:45.120> take<00:03:45.240> out<00:03:45.390> that

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
now I'm sure he would take out that

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:48.380 
now I'm sure he would take out that
probe<00:03:46.070> but<00:03:47.070> you<00:03:47.550> will<00:03:47.730> be<00:03:47.760> pulling<00:03:48.150> in<00:03:48.270> this

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
probe but you will be pulling in this

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.900 
probe but you will be pulling in this
SUV<00:03:48.780> into<00:03:49.080> the<00:03:49.890> Protoss<00:03:50.340> base<00:03:50.580> you<00:03:50.730> sees

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
SUV into the Protoss base you sees

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.870 
SUV into the Protoss base you sees
exactly<00:03:51.030> what's<00:03:51.720> going<00:03:52.050> on<00:03:52.350> but<00:03:53.190> really<00:03:53.670> is<00:03:53.850> it

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
exactly what's going on but really is it

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.750 
exactly what's going on but really is it
enough<00:03:54.300> he<00:03:54.450> only<00:03:54.630> saw<00:03:54.959> the<00:03:55.350> second<00:03:55.920> gateway<00:03:56.160> he

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
enough he only saw the second gateway he

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.150 
enough he only saw the second gateway he
did<00:03:57.030> see<00:03:57.270> the<00:03:57.480> Nexus<00:03:58.020> he<00:03:58.500> still<00:03:58.830> doesn't<00:03:59.010> know

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
did see the Nexus he still doesn't know

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.160 
did see the Nexus he still doesn't know
exactly<00:03:59.940> what's<00:04:00.120> coming<00:04:00.270> and<00:04:00.540> it<00:04:00.630> is<00:04:00.750> going<00:04:01.080> to

exactly what's coming and it is going to
be<00:04:01.200> a<00:04:01.290> for<00:04:01.620> gate<00:04:01.800> coming<00:04:02.190> from<00:04:02.670> Fox<00:04:03.030> ER<00:04:03.209> so

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
be a for gate coming from Fox ER so

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.870 
be a for gate coming from Fox ER so
foxer<00:04:04.140> will<00:04:04.350> be<00:04:04.470> doing<00:04:04.770> the<00:04:04.950> delayed<00:04:05.370> for<00:04:05.670> gate

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
foxer will be doing the delayed for gate

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.270 
foxer will be doing the delayed for gate
getting<00:04:06.180> the<00:04:06.300> nexus<00:04:06.690> down<00:04:06.990> first<00:04:07.410> and<00:04:07.650> this<00:04:08.130> is

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
getting the nexus down first and this is

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.160 
getting the nexus down first and this is
more<00:04:08.459> like<00:04:08.520> it's<00:04:09.240> kind<00:04:09.510> of<00:04:09.540> like<00:04:09.630> an<00:04:09.810> eco

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
more like it's kind of like an eco

more like it's kind of like an eco
version<00:04:10.560> of<00:04:10.740> the<00:04:11.100> for<00:04:11.370> gate<00:04:11.580> you<00:04:11.940> get<00:04:12.120> more

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:12.240 
version of the for gate you get more

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:13.940 
version of the for gate you get more
probes<00:04:12.570> to<00:04:12.750> get<00:04:12.900> a<00:04:12.930> little<00:04:13.050> bit<00:04:13.230> more<00:04:13.350> economy

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
probes to get a little bit more economy

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:15.500 
probes to get a little bit more economy
and<00:04:14.130> the<00:04:14.610> nice<00:04:14.820> thing<00:04:14.850> is<00:04:15.150> you<00:04:15.209> can<00:04:15.360> actually

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
and the nice thing is you can actually

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:18.229 
and the nice thing is you can actually
trick<00:04:16.140> your<00:04:16.350> opponent<00:04:16.380> because<00:04:17.239> consider

here<00:04:55.250> and<00:04:55.430> it<00:04:55.730> looks<00:04:55.940> like<00:04:56.060> the<00:04:56.180> units<00:04:56.420> are

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:56.570 
here and it looks like the units are

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:58.240 
here and it looks like the units are
gonna<00:04:56.690> start<00:04:56.930> to<00:04:57.050> morph<00:04:57.170> in<00:04:57.410> and<00:04:57.590> like<00:04:58.070> I<00:04:58.190> said

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:58.250 
gonna start to morph in and like I said

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:01.720 
gonna start to morph in and like I said
it<00:04:58.550> is<00:04:58.580> since<00:04:59.150> he<00:04:59.600> got<00:04:59.840> that<00:05:00.080> extra<00:05:00.740> simulator

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:01.730 
it is since he got that extra simulator

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:04.340 
he's going to have a lot more gas to get

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:06.040 
he's going to have a lot more gas to get
math<00:05:04.700> century<00:05:05.150> and<00:05:05.360> get<00:05:05.570> a<00:05:05.600> couple<00:05:05.930> more

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.050

of energy right there on the Nexus as
well<00:06:37.400> but<00:06:37.820> I<00:06:37.880> think<00:06:37.940> foxer<00:06:38.510> has<00:06:38.690> this<00:06:38.840> game<00:06:39.050> in

well but I think foxer has this game in

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:39.860 
well but I think foxer has this game in
the<00:06:39.260> bag

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:39.870 
the bag

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:41.720 
the bag
we<00:06:39.990> switch<00:06:40.200> over<00:06:40.410> to<00:06:40.440> the<00:06:40.590> APM<00:06:41.040> view<00:06:41.400> and<00:06:41.580> we

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:41.730 
we switch over to the APM view and we

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:43.940 
we switch over to the APM view and we
could<00:06:41.880> see<00:06:42.090> that<00:06:42.240> tester<00:06:42.780> why<00:06:43.620> do<00:06:43.680> I<00:06:43.800> keep

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:43.950 
could see that tester why do I keep

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:45.740 
could see that tester why do I keep
calling<00:06:44.160> him<00:06:44.430> boxer<00:06:44.940> is<00:06:45.090> actually<00:06:45.390> tester

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:45.750 
calling him boxer is actually tester

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:48.530 
calling him boxer is actually tester
tester<00:06:46.140> the<00:06:46.260> Protoss<00:06:46.590> player<00:06:46.890> oh<00:06:47.130> god<00:06:48.030> it<00:06:48.420> is

tester<00:06:48.960> the<00:06:49.110> blue<00:06:49.260> Protoss<00:06:49.680> and<00:06:50.090> so<00:06:51.090> he<00:06:51.270> I

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:51.300 
tester the blue Protoss and so he I

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:52.640 
tester the blue Protoss and so he I
think<00:06:51.630> he's<00:06:51.750> got<00:06:51.930> this<00:06:52.050> game<00:06:52.200> in<00:06:52.290> the<00:06:52.320> bag<00:06:52.380> we

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:52.650 
think he's got this game in the bag we

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:54.590 
think he's got this game in the bag we
do<00:06:52.830> have<00:06:53.010> a<00:06:53.190> counter<00:06:53.640> drop<00:06:53.850> coming<00:06:54.150> in<00:06:54.330> here

00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:54.600 
do have a counter drop coming in here

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:57.710 
do have a counter drop coming in here
and<00:06:54.780> we'll<00:06:55.740> a<00:06:56.100> fox<00:06:56.880> or<00:06:57.090> be<00:06:57.180> able<00:06:57.360> to<00:06:57.510> make

00:06:57.710 --> 00:06:57.720 
and we'll a fox or be able to make

00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:59.270 
and we'll a fox or be able to make
something<00:06:58.020> happen<00:06:58.200> with<00:06:58.470> this<00:06:58.620> drop<00:06:58.890> I<00:06:59.040> don't

00:06:59.270 --> 00:06:59.280 
something happen with this drop I don't

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:01.070 
something happen with this drop I don't
think<00:06:59.550> so<00:06:59.730> there's<00:06:59.940> just<00:07:00.150> all<00:07:00.480> these<00:07:00.750> probes

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:01.080 
think so there's just all these probes

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:02.870 
think so there's just all these probes
and<00:07:01.260> units<00:07:01.650> getting<00:07:01.890> warped<00:07:02.190> in<00:07:02.280> here<00:07:02.490> this

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:02.880 
and units getting warped in here this

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:05.270 
and units getting warped in here this
drop<00:07:03.330> will<00:07:03.660> get<00:07:04.020> negated<00:07:04.620> and<00:07:04.710> the<00:07:04.980> marines

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:05.280 
drop will get negated and the marines

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:07.130 
drop will get negated and the marines
and<00:07:05.430> marauders<00:07:05.490> will<00:07:05.940> have<00:07:06.150> to<00:07:06.330> just<00:07:06.480> they're

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:07.140 
and marauders will have to just they're

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:10.160
