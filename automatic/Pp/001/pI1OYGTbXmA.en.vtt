okay so we were sitting outside fortune

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.709 
okay so we were sitting outside fortune
of<00:00:06.960> war<00:00:07.109> and<00:00:08.090> suddenly<00:00:09.090> we<00:00:09.210> saw<00:00:09.360> a<00:00:09.389> bunch<00:00:09.540> of

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
of war and suddenly we saw a bunch of

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:11.150 
of war and suddenly we saw a bunch of
smoke<00:00:09.929> coming<00:00:10.170> out<00:00:10.320> the<00:00:10.380> top<00:00:10.679> of<00:00:10.710> the<00:00:10.830> chimney

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
smoke coming out the top of the chimney

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.900 
smoke coming out the top of the chimney
and<00:00:11.719> then<00:00:12.719> we<00:00:12.840> looked<00:00:13.019> inside<00:00:13.170> and<00:00:13.559> there's<00:00:13.710> a

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:13.910 
and then we looked inside and there's a

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:18.670 
and then we looked inside and there's a
massive<00:00:14.910> grease<00:00:15.269> fire<00:00:15.509> something<00:00:15.809> going<00:00:16.109> on

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:18.680 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.820 

and<00:00:19.680> now<00:00:20.609> the<00:00:21.539> shops<00:00:22.080> cleared<00:00:22.410> out<00:00:22.560> it's

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
and now the shops cleared out it's

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.810 
and now the shops cleared out it's
laying<00:00:22.980> smokey<00:00:23.460> inside<00:00:23.789> there<00:00:25.130> and<00:00:26.130> I<00:00:26.609> think

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
laying smokey inside there and I think

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.070 
laying smokey inside there and I think
someone<00:00:27.000> just<00:00:27.060> ran<00:00:27.330> off<00:00:27.480> to<00:00:27.570> go<00:00:27.660> call<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:27.930> fire

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
someone just ran off to go call the fire

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:39.369 
someone just ran off to go call the fire
brigade

00:00:39.369 --> 00:00:39.379 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:42.000 

that's<00:00:40.100> what<00:00:40.309> sufficient<00:00:40.699> Russell<00:00:40.969> did<00:00:41.120> you

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.010 
that's what sufficient Russell did you

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:50.840 
that's what sufficient Russell did you
sit<00:00:43.010> you<00:00:44.440> work<00:00:45.440> at<00:00:45.589> that<00:00:45.680> much<00:00:45.829> oil<00:00:46.629> cheese

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.670 

okay<00:00:51.510> you<00:00:51.570> can<00:00:51.720> see<00:00:51.900> the<00:00:52.020> smokes<00:00:52.320> actually

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
okay you can see the smokes actually

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.960 
okay you can see the smokes actually
bellowing<00:00:53.250> up<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.790> at<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.600> chip<00:00:54.810> shop

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:56.970 
bellowing up the at the chip shop

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.710 
bellowing up the at the chip shop

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:00.720 
I think it's getting to turning out to

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:08.450 
I think it's getting to turning out to
be<00:01:00.809> quite<00:01:01.020> a<00:01:01.140> quite<00:01:01.620> a<00:01:01.650> serious<00:01:02.129> situation

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.100

but on the plus side it's still in last

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:23.070 
but on the plus side it's still in last
down<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.470> beach
