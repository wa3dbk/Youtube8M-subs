time<00:00:04.440> and<00:00:04.860> space<00:00:05.000> timing<00:00:06.000> and<00:00:06.149> spacing<00:00:06.620> this

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
time and space timing and spacing this

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.120 
time and space timing and spacing this
is<00:00:07.680> I<00:00:08.309> think<00:00:08.550> one<00:00:09.269> of<00:00:09.300> the<00:00:09.599> most<00:00:10.130> important

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
is I think one of the most important

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.129 
is I think one of the most important
principles<00:00:11.580> in<00:00:12.210> animation<00:00:14.930> the<00:00:15.930> whole

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
principles in animation the whole

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.970 
principles in animation the whole
animation<00:00:16.619> is<00:00:16.949> built<00:00:17.310> on<00:00:17.960> how<00:00:18.960> things<00:00:19.500> move

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
animation is built on how things move

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.859 
animation is built on how things move
and<00:00:20.550> what<00:00:21.030> is<00:00:21.300> the<00:00:21.510> timing<00:00:22.110> and<00:00:22.520> end<00:00:23.520> of<00:00:24.119> each

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
and what is the timing and end of each

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:31.160 
and what is the timing and end of each
action<00:00:26.480> timing<00:00:27.480> is<00:00:28.970> the<00:00:29.970> rhythm<00:00:30.480> of<00:00:30.720> where

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
action timing is the rhythm of where

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.549 
action timing is the rhythm of where
thing<00:00:31.560> has<00:00:31.890> where<00:00:32.309> things<00:00:32.789> happen<00:00:33.420> when<00:00:34.320> they

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
thing has where things happen when they

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:41.540 
thing has where things happen when they
happen<00:00:36.589> or<00:00:37.589> faster<00:00:38.460> or<00:00:38.489> slower<00:00:39.710> one<00:00:40.710> things<00:00:41.129> a

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
happen or faster or slower one things a

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.790 
happen or faster or slower one things a
sound<00:00:42.059> or<00:00:42.629> slow<00:00:42.989> down<00:00:44.929> the<00:00:45.929> distance<00:00:46.469> between

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
sound or slow down the distance between

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.059 
sound or slow down the distance between
each<00:00:47.190> contact<00:00:47.879> okay<00:00:48.329> see<00:00:48.629> I<00:00:48.929> have<00:00:49.229> a<00:00:49.260> ball<00:00:49.679> that

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:50.069 
each contact okay see I have a ball that

00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:53.540 
each contact okay see I have a ball that
it's<00:00:50.460> bouncing

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:01:00.189 

bounce<00:00:54.420> bounce<00:00:55.050> bounce<00:00:55.350> bounce<00:00:56.010> bounce<00:00:56.280> and

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:00.199 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:04.850 

each<00:01:01.199> time<00:01:01.680> it<00:01:02.370> has<00:01:03.059> a<00:01:03.090> contact<00:01:03.860> contact

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
each time it has a contact contact

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.999 
each time it has a contact contact
contact<00:01:05.489> contact<00:01:06.300> contact<00:01:06.600> and<00:01:07.050> it<00:01:07.619> becomes

00:01:07.999 --> 00:01:08.009 
contact contact contact and it becomes

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:11.840 
contact contact contact and it becomes
shorter<00:01:08.729> and<00:01:09.030> shorter<00:01:09.060> and<00:01:09.840> shorter<00:01:10.100> so<00:01:11.100> this

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
shorter and shorter and shorter so this

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.490 
shorter and shorter and shorter so this
would<00:01:12.210> be<00:01:12.420> my<00:01:12.690> timing

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
would be my timing

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.600 
would be my timing
okay<00:01:13.860> I<00:01:13.890> have<00:01:14.570> 25<00:01:15.570> front<00:01:15.899> frames<00:01:16.530> per<00:01:17.040> second

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
okay I have 25 front frames per second

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.480 
okay I have 25 front frames per second
this<00:01:18.060> is<00:01:18.420> my<00:01:18.720> scene<00:01:19.020> my<00:01:19.200> scene<00:01:19.500> is<00:01:19.530> one<00:01:19.920> second

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
this is my scene my scene is one second

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.350 
this is my scene my scene is one second
it<00:01:20.790> has<00:01:21.060> 25<00:01:21.780> frames<00:01:22.110> in<00:01:22.320> it<00:01:22.500> and<00:01:22.970> my<00:01:23.970> timing

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
it has 25 frames in it and my timing

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.859 
it has 25 frames in it and my timing
would<00:01:24.720> be<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:25.530> ball<00:01:25.740> starting<00:01:26.460> here<00:01:26.880> and<00:01:27.090> and

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
would be the ball starting here and and

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.100 
would be the ball starting here and and
here<00:01:28.619> this<00:01:29.429> is<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.820> whole<00:01:30.149> timing<00:01:30.780> of<00:01:30.960> the

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
here this is the whole timing of the

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.219 
here this is the whole timing of the
scene<00:01:31.380> and<00:01:31.740> the<00:01:32.640> timing<00:01:33.119> of<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.450> action<00:01:33.960> is

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
scene and the timing of the action is

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.139 
scene and the timing of the action is
that<00:01:34.289> he's<00:01:35.070> doing<00:01:35.330> one<00:01:36.330> two<00:01:36.780> three<00:01:37.350> four<00:01:38.149> five

00:01:39.139 --> 00:01:39.149 
that he's doing one two three four five

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:42.560 
that he's doing one two three four five
and<00:01:39.899> a<00:01:40.380> half<00:01:40.410> bounces<00:01:41.369> this<00:01:41.789> would<00:01:42.149> be<00:01:42.330> my

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
and a half bounces this would be my

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.100 
and a half bounces this would be my
timing<00:01:43.190> okay

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
timing okay

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.790 
timing okay
spacing<00:01:46.110> here<00:01:46.619> this<00:01:47.369> is<00:01:47.550> the<00:01:47.700> spacing<00:01:48.800> when

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:49.800 
spacing here this is the spacing when

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.889 
spacing here this is the spacing when
things<00:01:50.159> are<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.909> frames<00:01:51.240> when<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.630> frames

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
things are the frames when the frames

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.889 
things are the frames when the frames
are<00:01:52.110> closer<00:01:52.470> or<00:01:53.009> further<00:01:53.280> away<00:01:53.460> it<00:01:54.300> gives<00:01:54.659> me

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
are closer or further away it gives me

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.830 
are closer or further away it gives me
different<00:01:55.140> to<00:01:55.470> rhythm<00:01:55.860> in<00:01:56.039> the<00:01:56.250> action<00:01:56.840> when

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
different to rhythm in the action when

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.380 
different to rhythm in the action when
they<00:01:58.049> are<00:01:58.110> closer<00:01:58.500> the<00:01:59.070> action<00:01:59.430> is<00:01:59.579> slower<00:01:59.909> and

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
they are closer the action is slower and

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.539 
they are closer the action is slower and
when<00:02:00.720> they're<00:02:00.990> further<00:02:01.320> away<00:02:01.799> the<00:02:02.040> action<00:02:02.430> is

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
when they're further away the action is

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.859 
when they're further away the action is
faster<00:02:03.119> so<00:02:04.110> this<00:02:05.070> way<00:02:05.399> I<00:02:05.430> have<00:02:05.970> different

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
faster so this way I have different

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.130 
faster so this way I have different
rhythm<00:02:07.439> in<00:02:07.680> this<00:02:08.040> bouncing<00:02:08.700> ball<00:02:08.929> okay<00:02:09.929> these

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
rhythm in this bouncing ball okay these

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:16.400 
rhythm in this bouncing ball okay these
are<00:02:10.410> all<00:02:10.440> my<00:02:11.040> frames<00:02:12.650> I<00:02:14.450> have<00:02:15.450> the<00:02:15.660> ball<00:02:15.930> and

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
are all my frames I have the ball and

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.910 
are all my frames I have the ball and
here<00:02:17.130> it's<00:02:17.930> overlapping<00:02:18.930> you<00:02:19.410> can<00:02:19.590> see<00:02:19.769> the

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
here it's overlapping you can see the

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.850 
here it's overlapping you can see the
frames<00:02:20.250> of<00:02:20.459> overlapping<00:02:21.180> so<00:02:22.140> they're<00:02:22.380> closer

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
frames of overlapping so they're closer

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.030 
frames of overlapping so they're closer
to<00:02:23.250> each<00:02:23.370> other<00:02:23.640> and<00:02:24.090> then<00:02:24.810> it's<00:02:25.410> going<00:02:25.709> down

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
to each other and then it's going down

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.840 
to each other and then it's going down
they're<00:02:26.549> getting<00:02:26.970> further<00:02:27.269> away<00:02:27.780> and<00:02:28.850> then

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:29.850 
they're getting further away and then

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:35.180 
they're getting further away and then
going<00:02:30.209> up<00:02:30.420> again<00:02:30.840> and<00:02:32.360> closer<00:02:33.360> again<00:02:33.959> so<00:02:34.829> this

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
going up again and closer again so this

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.810 
going up again and closer again so this
is<00:02:35.519> my<00:02:35.850> spacing<00:02:36.600> it<00:02:37.049> gives<00:02:37.410> the<00:02:37.620> rhythm<00:02:38.100> when

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
is my spacing it gives the rhythm when

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:43.250 
is my spacing it gives the rhythm when
things<00:02:39.209> are<00:02:39.480> faster<00:02:40.109> or<00:02:40.470> slower<00:02:40.859> and<00:02:42.049> this<00:02:43.049> is

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
things are faster or slower and this is

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.430 
things are faster or slower and this is
the<00:02:43.440> rhythm<00:02:43.680> of<00:02:44.040> the<00:02:44.250> action<00:02:45.260> it's<00:02:46.260> not

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
the rhythm of the action it's not

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:53.990 
the rhythm of the action it's not
constant<00:02:47.310> okay<00:02:48.530> see<00:02:49.530> the<00:02:50.480> animation

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.470 

I<00:02:54.090> hope<00:02:54.480> you<00:02:54.720> can<00:02:54.930> see<00:02:55.230> it<00:02:55.640> bounce<00:02:56.640> bounce

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
I hope you can see it bounce bounce

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.720 
I hope you can see it bounce bounce
bounce<00:02:58.230> bounce<00:02:58.410> bounce<00:02:58.770> okay

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
bounce bounce bounce okay

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:04.160 
bounce bounce bounce okay
it<00:03:00.390> has<00:03:00.750> a<00:03:01.260> different<00:03:01.890> rhythm<00:03:02.130> it<00:03:02.760> goes<00:03:03.480> faster

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
it has a different rhythm it goes faster

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.270 
it has a different rhythm it goes faster
going<00:03:04.530> down<00:03:04.920> then<00:03:05.700> up<00:03:06.200> slows<00:03:07.200> the<00:03:07.620> bid<00:03:07.830> then

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
going down then up slows the bid then

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.300 
going down then up slows the bid then
goes<00:03:08.610> down<00:03:09.030> again<00:03:09.270> and<00:03:09.930> I<00:03:10.680> want<00:03:10.890> to<00:03:10.980> see<00:03:11.160> the

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
goes down again and I want to see the

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.170 
goes down again and I want to see the
spacing<00:03:11.940> again<00:03:12.060> because<00:03:12.750> I<00:03:13.850> started<00:03:14.850> saying

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
spacing again because I started saying

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.470 
spacing again because I started saying
that<00:03:15.570> we<00:03:16.380> when<00:03:16.980> we're<00:03:17.160> doing<00:03:17.370> animation<00:03:18.209> we're

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
that we when we're doing animation we're

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:19.970 
that we when we're doing animation we're
imitating<00:03:19.290> life

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
imitating life

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.980 
imitating life
we're<00:03:20.490> imitating<00:03:21.450> something<00:03:21.810> that<00:03:22.350> is

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:23.990 
we're imitating something that is

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:27.740 
we're imitating something that is
basically<00:03:24.990> from<00:03:25.440> real<00:03:25.740> life<00:03:25.830> and<00:03:26.450> we<00:03:27.450> need<00:03:27.630> to

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
basically from real life and we need to

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.760 
basically from real life and we need to
consider<00:03:28.430> all<00:03:29.430> the<00:03:29.760> laws<00:03:29.940> of<00:03:30.209> physics<00:03:30.770> working

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:31.770 
consider all the laws of physics working

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:34.880 
consider all the laws of physics working
all<00:03:32.280> the<00:03:32.550> forces<00:03:33.209> that<00:03:33.390> are<00:03:33.840> working<00:03:33.870> on<00:03:34.650> my

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
all the forces that are working on my

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:40.520 
all the forces that are working on my
object<00:03:35.160> or<00:03:35.850> character<00:03:37.910> so<00:03:38.910> for<00:03:39.510> this<00:03:39.720> ball<00:03:40.080> for

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
object or character so for this ball for

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:44.630 
object or character so for this ball for
example<00:03:40.850> I<00:03:41.850> have<00:03:42.510> gravity<00:03:43.320> and<00:03:43.650> I<00:03:44.010> also<00:03:44.250> have

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
example I have gravity and I also have

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:50.930 
example I have gravity and I also have
the<00:03:45.980> the<00:03:46.980> force<00:03:47.340> of<00:03:48.680> the<00:03:49.680> ball<00:03:49.950> has<00:03:50.310> its<00:03:50.640> own

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
the the force of the ball has its own

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.190 
the the force of the ball has its own
force<00:03:51.420> which<00:03:52.380> pushes<00:03:53.250> him<00:03:53.459> to<00:03:53.670> go<00:03:53.880> forward<00:03:54.780> and

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
force which pushes him to go forward and

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:00.320 
force which pushes him to go forward and
bounce<00:03:56.040> but<00:03:56.880> I<00:03:56.940> also<00:03:57.300> have<00:03:57.660> gravity<00:03:58.530> so<00:03:59.340> when

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:00.330 
bounce but I also have gravity so when

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:04.910 
bounce but I also have gravity so when
it<00:04:00.540> goes<00:04:00.840> down<00:04:01.489> gravity's<00:04:02.489> pulling<00:04:02.910> him<00:04:03.330> so<00:04:03.920> it

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
it goes down gravity's pulling him so it

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:08.750 
it goes down gravity's pulling him so it
will<00:04:05.250> go<00:04:05.510> faster<00:04:06.510> down<00:04:06.930> then<00:04:07.799> it<00:04:07.980> hits<00:04:08.549> the

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
will go faster down then it hits the

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.630 
will go faster down then it hits the
ground<00:04:09.060> and<00:04:09.540> because<00:04:10.080> I<00:04:10.350> have<00:04:10.620> a<00:04:10.650> ground<00:04:11.160> here

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
ground and because I have a ground here

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:17.420 
ground and because I have a ground here
I<00:04:11.820> will<00:04:12.660> have<00:04:12.840> force<00:04:13.260> pushing<00:04:14.220> him<00:04:14.459> up<00:04:16.430> but

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
I will have force pushing him up but

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:21.530 
I will have force pushing him up but
Eddy<00:04:17.850> as<00:04:18.120> it<00:04:18.810> goes<00:04:19.200> up<00:04:19.440> it<00:04:19.950> slows<00:04:20.790> down<00:04:20.820> because

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:21.540 
Eddy as it goes up it slows down because

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:25.820 
Eddy as it goes up it slows down because
it<00:04:22.290> has<00:04:22.860> the<00:04:23.130> force<00:04:23.430> to<00:04:23.790> go<00:04:23.940> up<00:04:24.210> but<00:04:25.050> gravity<00:04:25.770> is

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
it has the force to go up but gravity is

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:30.230 
it has the force to go up but gravity is
pulling<00:04:26.130> him<00:04:26.490> down<00:04:26.840> so<00:04:28.220> it<00:04:29.220> will<00:04:29.580> start<00:04:30.030> to

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 
pulling him down so it will start to

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.790 
pulling him down so it will start to
slow<00:04:30.660> slow<00:04:31.380> slow<00:04:31.490> then<00:04:32.750> it<00:04:33.750> gives<00:04:34.169> in<00:04:34.560> to

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
slow slow slow then it gives in to

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.240 
slow slow slow then it gives in to
gravity<00:04:35.430> so<00:04:35.790> it<00:04:36.060> will<00:04:36.300> go<00:04:36.479> down<00:04:36.870> again<00:04:37.290> and<00:04:37.620> as

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:38.250 
gravity so it will go down again and as

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:40.790 
gravity so it will go down again and as
it<00:04:38.580> goes<00:04:38.820> down<00:04:38.930> gravity<00:04:39.930> is<00:04:40.110> pulling<00:04:40.440> him

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
it goes down gravity is pulling him

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.240 
it goes down gravity is pulling him
again<00:04:41.070> so<00:04:41.370> it<00:04:41.550> will<00:04:41.850> speed<00:04:42.240> up<00:04:42.510> and<00:04:43.010> again<00:04:44.010> and

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250 
again so it will speed up and again and

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:47.180 
again so it will speed up and again and
again<00:04:44.490> and<00:04:44.669> again<00:04:44.910> repeats<00:04:45.840> and<00:04:46.140> of<00:04:46.860> course

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 
again and again repeats and of course

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:52.400 
again and again repeats and of course
added<00:04:48.150> bounces<00:04:48.840> it<00:04:49.410> loses<00:04:50.280> the<00:04:51.000> force<00:04:51.900> the

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:52.410 
added bounces it loses the force the

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:57.290 
added bounces it loses the force the
initial<00:04:53.280> force<00:04:53.729> it<00:04:54.120> had<00:04:54.479> so<00:04:55.050> it<00:04:55.860> will<00:04:56.300> every

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300 
initial force it had so it will every

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.620 
initial force it had so it will every
time<00:04:57.600> it<00:04:57.840> bounces<00:04:58.110> up<00:04:58.740> it<00:04:59.130> will<00:04:59.400> bounce<00:04:59.640> to<00:05:00.330> a

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:00.630 
time it bounces up it will bounce to a

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:05.270 
time it bounces up it will bounce to a
lower<00:05:01.020> position<00:05:02.090> until<00:05:03.090> it<00:05:03.510> stops<00:05:04.050> and<00:05:04.440> and

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.280 
lower position until it stops and and

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:07.700 
lower position until it stops and and
this<00:05:05.610> is<00:05:05.669> physics<00:05:06.479> this<00:05:06.870> is<00:05:06.930> like

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:07.710 
this is physics this is like

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:11.590 
this is physics this is like
basic<00:05:08.010> basic

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:11.600 

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:16.940 

and<00:05:12.860> we<00:05:13.860> need<00:05:14.040> to<00:05:14.220> always<00:05:14.460> consider<00:05:15.120> that<00:05:15.950> if

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:16.950 
and we need to always consider that if

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:20.480 
and we need to always consider that if
we<00:05:17.250> have<00:05:17.460> a<00:05:17.490> car<00:05:18.200> say<00:05:19.200> I'm<00:05:19.410> animating<00:05:19.770> a<00:05:20.160> car

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:20.490 
we have a car say I'm animating a car

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:23.480 
we have a car say I'm animating a car
and<00:05:20.730> starting<00:05:21.330> to<00:05:21.480> drive<00:05:21.810> so<00:05:22.410> a<00:05:22.740> car<00:05:23.100> can't

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:23.490 
and starting to drive so a car can't

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:28.070 
and starting to drive so a car can't
just<00:05:23.970> start<00:05:24.920> poof<00:05:25.920> it's<00:05:26.310> in<00:05:26.670> a<00:05:27.300> hundred<00:05:27.810> miles

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.080 
just start poof it's in a hundred miles

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:32.000 
just start poof it's in a hundred miles
per<00:05:28.440> hour<00:05:28.650> it<00:05:29.430> starts<00:05:30.420> slow<00:05:30.810> and<00:05:31.290> it<00:05:31.620> gains

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:32.010 
per hour it starts slow and it gains

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:35.150 
per hour it starts slow and it gains
speed<00:05:32.340> and<00:05:32.880> if<00:05:33.570> a<00:05:33.720> car<00:05:33.960> stops<00:05:34.350> then<00:05:34.770> it<00:05:34.920> can

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:35.160 
speed and if a car stops then it can

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:39.170 
speed and if a car stops then it can
just<00:05:35.190> stick<00:05:35.760> stop<00:05:36.170> so<00:05:37.170> it<00:05:37.560> slows<00:05:38.010> down<00:05:38.040> it<00:05:38.940> has

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:39.180 
just stick stop so it slows down it has

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:47.920 
just stick stop so it slows down it has
friction<00:05:39.980> from<00:05:40.980> the<00:05:41.430> floor<00:05:41.730> and<00:05:42.150> the<00:05:43.050> wind

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:47.930 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:51.530 

till<00:05:48.930> it<00:05:49.170> stops<00:05:49.560> so<00:05:50.220> when<00:05:50.700> I<00:05:50.730> draw<00:05:51.180> those

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:51.540 
till it stops so when I draw those

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:54.880 
till it stops so when I draw those
frames<00:05:52.020> of<00:05:52.500> this<00:05:52.800> car<00:05:53.130> I<00:05:53.550> would<00:05:54.330> do<00:05:54.810> like

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:54.890 
frames of this car I would do like

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:57.560 
frames of this car I would do like
friends<00:05:55.890> that<00:05:55.920> are<00:05:56.130> very<00:05:56.160> close<00:05:56.790> at<00:05:57.300> the

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:57.570 
friends that are very close at the

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:00.170 
friends that are very close at the
beginning<00:05:58.080> and<00:05:58.410> starting<00:05:59.040> to<00:05:59.280> be<00:05:59.700> further

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:00.180 
beginning and starting to be further

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:03.380 
beginning and starting to be further
away<00:06:00.660> from<00:06:00.990> each<00:06:01.110> other<00:06:01.290> and<00:06:01.770> then<00:06:02.700> it<00:06:02.970> speeds

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:03.390 
away from each other and then it speeds

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:06.710 
away from each other and then it speeds
so<00:06:03.810> the<00:06:04.320> frames<00:06:04.620> are<00:06:04.860> very<00:06:05.420> far<00:06:06.420> away<00:06:06.660> from

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:06.720 
so the frames are very far away from

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:10.190 
so the frames are very far away from
each<00:06:07.050> other<00:06:07.260> each<00:06:07.830> other<00:06:08.160> then<00:06:08.610> slows<00:06:09.120> down<00:06:09.390> so

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:10.200 
each other each other then slows down so

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:11.960 
each other each other then slows down so
they're<00:06:10.410> getting<00:06:10.740> closer<00:06:11.040> and<00:06:11.250> closer<00:06:11.640> and

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:11.970 
they're getting closer and closer and

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:17.480 
they're getting closer and closer and
this<00:06:12.720> is<00:06:12.960> spacing<00:06:13.290> that<00:06:13.770> this<00:06:14.490> this<00:06:16.490> changes

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:17.490 
this is spacing that this this changes

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:21.710 
this is spacing that this this changes
between<00:06:18.800> the<00:06:19.800> space<00:06:20.160> between<00:06:20.520> the<00:06:20.910> frames<00:06:21.270> is

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:21.720 
between the space between the frames is

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:25.790 
between the space between the frames is
what<00:06:22.350> gives<00:06:22.740> us<00:06:23.240> different<00:06:24.240> rhythms<00:06:24.930> in<00:06:25.260> the

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:25.800 
what gives us different rhythms in the

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:29.840 
what gives us different rhythms in the
action<00:06:26.310> and<00:06:26.990> this<00:06:27.990> this<00:06:28.650> time<00:06:29.160> and<00:06:29.520> space

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:29.850 
action and this this time and space

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:32.990 
action and this this time and space
there<00:06:30.210> are<00:06:30.300> the<00:06:30.420> two<00:06:30.660> most<00:06:31.470> basic<00:06:31.880> elements<00:06:32.880> of

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:33.000 
there are the two most basic elements of

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:42.150 
there are the two most basic elements of
animation
