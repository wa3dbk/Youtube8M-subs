00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:08.069
 so tell you what housing itself 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.960
 represents the born meter to its fullest 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.090
 pen 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:14.509
 rubber pro rubber material for 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.250
 slip prevention and to glove 

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:19.050
 has very high quality is formed 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.720
 holes for 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:25.880
 charged ki charged to inserted in there 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:30.320
 fully and swing 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:33.210
 further gun has a regulator of the power of battle 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:37.610
 made here in this form 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:41.100
 the prince is just like everyone else's Italian 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:44.510
 grammar guns has two positions 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:49.340
 in the extreme position 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:51.020
 maximum power of battle in this position 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:55.980
 restriction 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:01:01.280
 than in combat by 5 percent also has 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:04.580
 guard against accidental descent 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:10.020
 very well executed 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:14.040
 it can be said completely excludes 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:17.850
 spontaneous shooting after charging 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:20.970
 harpoon use constantly in order 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:26.990
 eliminate injury to your own 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.990
 friends no further reset 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:36.689
 performed as follows 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:39.710
 wound whether it is not fixed for it 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:43.020
 ear when pressed falls grazing 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:49.200
 triggered when he returns to 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:52.340
 starting position and so on 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:55.009
 receiver is narrowing at the muzzle 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:02:01.340
 what they write allows you to increase 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:02:03.210
 maneuverability in the water column further husband 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:07.459
 front hook 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:14.810
 you have a hole for fixing 

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:19.110
 I go further hole in the bar 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:23.930
 see more goes further nut itself 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:31.620
 muzzle and so now on his snap 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:39.290
 have not yet come across lied initially 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:44.390
 harpoon with a native tip with a native 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:46.980
 twists with the native runner plastic and 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:50.820
 hat shaybochka and so metal 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:55.640
 the nut is inserted into the nut butcher 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:58.440
 this way is inserted 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.840
 redone not altered nut inflated to 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:05.280
 I will tell the factory later that I 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:08.720
 redid inserted nut goes 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:12.000
 plastic sleeve runner on 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:15.420
 tip after two or three hunt here it is 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:19.680
 here are plastic ears and a runner 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:23.280
 scattered down and dust almost lost 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:27.930
 you can say your first harpoon arrow 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:30.840
 and came to the conclusion that this construction 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:34.530
 not very reliably had to redo on 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:36.720
 metal runner further redistribution 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:41.400
 the slider will show you what plan 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:44.239
 made remake runner on 7 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:49.760
 millimeters he was so metallic 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:53.510
 co nazirova not and continued to use 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:55.590
 what was the nut here 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:58.910
 shaybochka more precisely not a nut which 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:03.140
 is inserted into the nut and muzzle 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:08.690
 over time began to moor on 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:12.280
 pwned this is this edge on shooting this 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:17.150
 It didnâ€™t affect me but it's damn 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:19.000
 I did not like the harpoon replaced what 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:23.810
 has come 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:29.480
 machined new nut 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:33.740
 in kind to along with new runner with 

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:35.560
 hydro brake here such here 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:40.100
 Here nut and muzzle 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:44.080
 new sample pulled out of duralumin can 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:46.910
 there was a smaller hole made 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:52.480
 in order to be more convenient to twist 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:59.360
 screw almost identical copy 

00:04:52.480 --> 00:05:01.850
 native and pulled out a new nut he pulled out 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:05.720
 new runner shot down tom for what's yourself 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:08.750
 represents the brake leader and represents 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:14.330
 a stream of water which is not all behind it 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:18.979
 the harpoon falls into the space between 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:23.180
 harpoon and runner while pushing 

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:27.320
 it slows down going smoothly and hitting 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:31.669
 practically absent i see 

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:39.620
 as far as the end slider comes 

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:44.470
 tail of the harpoon later on 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:49.960
 so here is the snap of the muzzle 

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:56.050
 we show him morisa serrano now 

00:05:49.960 --> 00:06:00.810
 looks on the arm 

00:05:56.050 --> 00:06:06.400
 nut mounted on a roller 

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:11.190
 here and so guns is able 

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:11.190
 charging and waiting for a shot
