00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:00.500 
usually use it as an effect and while I

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.229 
usually use it as an effect and while I
don't<00:01:00.649> think<00:01:00.949> that<00:01:01.070> I'm<00:01:01.189> a<00:01:01.219> horrible<00:01:01.519> singer<00:01:01.909> I

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 
don't think that I'm a horrible singer I

know<00:01:02.329> that<00:01:02.629> I'm<00:01:02.719> not<00:01:02.869> perfect<00:01:03.109> so<00:01:03.710> using<00:01:04.339> it

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:04.489 
know that I'm not perfect so using it

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.480

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 
does make me sound perfect I think that

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.290

it's<00:01:07.640> the<00:01:07.789> same<00:01:08.000> as<00:01:08.240> using<00:01:08.539> say<00:01:09.170> distortion<00:01:09.920> or

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:10.300 
it's the same as using say distortion or

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.680 
it's the same as using say distortion or
reverb<00:01:11.319> flanger<00:01:12.319> on<00:01:12.560> an<00:01:12.830> electric<00:01:13.190> guitar<00:01:13.690> but

there's some musicians out there that

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.580 
there's some musicians out there that
think<00:01:16.310> that<00:01:16.729> it<00:01:16.970> shouldn't<00:01:17.240> be<00:01:17.330> used<00:01:17.600> at<00:01:18.560> all
