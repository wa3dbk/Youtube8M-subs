00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:06.643
 Hunters, hundreds, for 6 hours! 

00:00:06.675 --> 00:00:08.105
 They have a German mark. 

00:00:08.704 --> 00:00:09.704
 Get them! 

00:00:10.436 --> 00:00:13.578
 Where do the fighters go? Anything left of our escort? 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.309
 Emergency, machine to leave! 

00:00:24.541 --> 00:00:26.357
 We tore our sons into pieces. 

00:00:28.126 --> 00:00:31.372
 We need pilots who protect our bombers at all costs. 

00:00:36.761 --> 00:00:40.322
 When we got under his command, he explained it ... 

00:00:40.466 --> 00:00:43.827
 ... that there will be no quads going through the pilot ... 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.272
 ... doing the flight school, surviving the basic training ... 

00:00:51.118 --> 00:00:52.845
 We succeeded. 

00:00:53.142 --> 00:00:56.528
 I don't see anyone shot. 

00:00:57.148 --> 00:01:01.044
 It's hard to shoot anyone with 100 miles behind the frontline. 

00:01:01.943 --> 00:01:04.029
 What do we do? 

00:01:04.289 --> 00:01:05.628
 Why, what did you imagine? 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:08.907
 Are you applying for a hundred years of discrimination there? 

00:01:09.593 --> 00:01:10.523
 Up with the head, son! 

00:01:11.307 --> 00:01:12.502
 You're hunting pilots yourself. 

00:01:13.373 --> 00:01:17.777
 We have the same right to fight for our country as anyone else. 

00:01:17.989 --> 00:01:19.906
 We're not going to stand still! 

00:01:21.963 --> 00:01:25.232
 I can't let more bombers get down. 

00:01:25.752 --> 00:01:27.350
 Helps save lives? 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.183
 Buying new aircraft for us ... 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:32.233
 ... we protect them. 

00:01:32.382 --> 00:01:34.446
 Nothing is hard! All Challenges! 

00:01:34.606 --> 00:01:36.423
 The star sky is no limit! 

00:01:36.522 --> 00:01:40.057
 To the last replica, the last bullet, the last minute, the last man ... 

00:01:40.129 --> 00:01:42.872
 ... fight! - We're fighting! 

00:01:45.008 --> 00:01:47.753
 We protect the bombers at all costs. 

00:01:47.893 --> 00:01:49.212
 BEHAVIOR 

00:01:49.843 --> 00:01:51.793
 Fighter, 2 hours. - Stay with the bombers! 

00:01:52.935 --> 00:01:54.252
 NO COLOR 

00:01:54.317 --> 00:01:56.075
 A bomber has ten lives. 

00:01:58.824 --> 00:02:02.621
 Our victory is measured by how many bombers we deliver to our goal. 

00:02:04.227 --> 00:02:07.406
 How many husbands can return to his wife. 

00:02:07.753 --> 00:02:10.704
 How many dads come home to their children. 

00:02:12.861 --> 00:02:13.861
 BASED ON TRUE HISTORY 

00:02:16.088 --> 00:02:17.630
 Junior, jump out!
