00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.799
 you do not see it because the decor 

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:26.520

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.590
 controls in the keys the 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.310
 keys that you can customize 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.039
 out of range at bright 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:35.280
 gold already this judged by default i 'm going 

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:38.909
 put left and right and for rose is 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:41.549
 the kama is the key bah here gold to 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.909
 what's the use of gama mode then by 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.390
 fault 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:48.149
 gold minecraft bah at the small fine you 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:52.500
 can adjust the brightness of minecraft 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:58.280
 so dark I like to be here for that 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:58.280
 you can see well here 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:08.740
 or so with maximum brightness 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:11.680
 compared to the game the range mode to 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:15.670
 bright allowed to make sense of 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:17.230
 turn on guest and there is night since 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.510
 so I come on this topic you go 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:22.480
 see how it works hamou to 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:25.450
 left I have this mark is kama bright 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:29.950
 miss and that percent so why 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:33.330
 because by default I put my members 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:36.070
 and born at 1700% you can pc 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.430
 is the month of cuddling weights and will be at 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:40.750
 zero 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:45.910
 you will see up and have almost stopped 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:51.360
 its products good bah we will lower 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:51.360
 it does not work it's weird 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:03:00.639
 that's when I go 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:03.010
 reduce the gamma the game will be more and 

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:04.439
 darker until you reach black 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.659
 total 

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:13.959
 so that's after if you want to do 

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:16.319
 a house you will see that the 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:16.319
 brightness 

00:03:19.169 --> 00:03:27.909
 I did not build houses and 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:34.000
 your ranks you see we're going up 

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:36.990
 reach the total north then it's more 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.350
 and for the director of 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:42.720
 two videos for what it takes a movie 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:43.550
 and it's a mode that gives you more 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:47.280
 it's a little more 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:52.640
 so why why if g 20 for 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:56.790
 100% 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:04:00.890
 No, I do not know, I wanted to make a 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:05.190
 test before making the video but hey 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:07.490
 that's the number if you get to 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:11.520
 a negative number 

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:14.040
 you are going to be in the night you go 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:18.950
 reduce the brightness to the maximum we do 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:22.980
 the gamma the shadow and the more you go to 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:26.400
 their assets acquired and wholesale you go 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:32.880
 are you going to make your game more 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:40.080
 bright here it is necessary to have 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:45.180
 the little fine mode to be able to 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:48.810
 add this mode boscher of not too bad 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:52.740
 get out despite my sore throat and 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:55.590
 the headache is freezing I activate the 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:05:03.770
 ghana white and here we can see that ben 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:03.770

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:09.070
