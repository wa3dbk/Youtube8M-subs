00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
I was delving into being a teenager I

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.340

was<00:02:13.090> escaped<00:02:13.450> or<00:02:13.630> I<00:02:14.020> used<00:02:14.170> to<00:02:14.260> I<00:02:14.320> used

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
was escaped or I used to I used

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:15.990 
was escaped or I used to I used
escapable<00:02:14.800> world<00:02:14.980> as<00:02:15.100> a<00:02:15.160> teenager<00:02:15.490> so<00:02:15.730> it<00:02:15.850> was

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
escapable world as a teenager so it was

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.450 
escapable world as a teenager so it was
my<00:02:16.150> idea<00:02:16.450> there<00:02:16.990> Peter<00:02:17.170> skateboard<00:02:17.680> and<00:02:17.860> Mark

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:18.460 
my idea there Peter skateboard and Mark

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:21.780 
my idea there Peter skateboard and Mark
was<00:02:18.640> awesome<00:02:19.270> enough<00:02:19.360> to<00:02:19.510> allow<00:02:20.080> that<00:02:20.140> to<00:02:20.790> be

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
was awesome enough to allow that to be

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.700 
was awesome enough to allow that to be
in<00:02:21.970> the<00:02:22.030> movie<00:02:22.330> and<00:02:22.450> then<00:02:22.570> what<00:02:23.290> a<00:02:23.320> great<00:02:23.590> way

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:23.710 
in the movie and then what a great way

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:26.010 
in the movie and then what a great way
to<00:02:23.740> explore<00:02:24.310> those<00:02:25.060> powers<00:02:25.540> and<00:02:25.750> it<00:02:25.840> did

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.020 
to explore those powers and it did

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.350 
to explore those powers and it did
correlate<00:02:26.920> you<00:02:27.070> know<00:02:27.220> I<00:02:27.250> as<00:02:27.700> I<00:02:27.970> was<00:02:28.120> getting

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
correlate you know I as I was getting

will because I think it's a weird thing
this<00:03:35.660> is<00:03:35.750> kind<00:03:35.989> of<00:03:36.050> a<00:03:36.220> whoo<00:03:37.220> kind<00:03:38.030> of<00:03:38.090> answer

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.450 
this is kind of a whoo kind of answer

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.440 
this is kind of a whoo kind of answer
but<00:03:38.720> like<00:03:39.310> Peter<00:03:40.310> creates<00:03:40.760> the<00:03:40.940> symbol<00:03:41.300> that

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 
but like Peter creates the symbol that

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:43.750 
but like Peter creates the symbol that
he<00:03:41.660> doesn't<00:03:41.900> realize<00:03:42.140> what<00:03:42.170> it<00:03:42.380> is<00:03:42.670> until<00:03:43.670> he

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
he doesn't realize what it is until he

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.820 
he doesn't realize what it is until he
does<00:03:43.970> and<00:03:44.300> then<00:03:44.600> he<00:03:44.840> goes<00:03:44.959> oh<00:03:45.200> I'm<00:03:45.410> not<00:03:45.560> I'm<00:03:45.769> not

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:45.830 
does and then he goes oh I'm not I'm not

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:48.160 
does and then he goes oh I'm not I'm not
enough<00:03:46.730> to<00:03:47.030> fill<00:03:47.209> this<00:03:47.390> symbol<00:03:47.780> that's<00:03:47.930> how<00:03:48.140> I

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170 
enough to fill this symbol that's how I

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:50.440 
enough to fill this symbol that's how I
felt<00:03:48.590> I<00:03:48.739> was<00:03:48.860> like<00:03:48.980> I<00:03:49.100> can't<00:03:49.400> I<00:03:49.610> can't<00:03:50.330> be

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:50.450 
felt I was like I can't I can't be

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:52.150 
felt I was like I can't I can't be
spider-man<00:03:50.930> that<00:03:51.170> no<00:03:51.350> one<00:03:51.500> can<00:03:51.590> be<00:03:51.709> spider-man

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 
spider-man that no one can be spider-man

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.590 
spider-man that no one can be spider-man
spider-man<00:03:52.400> the<00:03:52.730> symbol<00:03:53.030> of<00:03:53.120> spider-man<00:03:53.390> is

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:53.600 
spider-man the symbol of spider-man is

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.949 
spider-man the symbol of spider-man is
much<00:03:53.810> greater<00:03:54.170> then<00:03:55.130> than<00:03:55.819> any<00:03:56.120> human<00:03:56.569> could

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:56.959 
much greater then than any human could

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:48.760 
much greater then than any human could
ever<00:03:57.250> could<00:03:58.250> ever<00:03:58.310> fill

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:48.770 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:53.270
