00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:09.200
 well let's see with that to see that 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.700
 come back I would weigh in the friend's kitchen 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.049
 boy dude dude because apart from friend 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.240
 mine is friend of the house is here several 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:17.720
 times with us and if there is a recipe 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:19.250
 that sums up your season in noto to that 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:21.140
 there was a little bit that made him famous in the 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:23.530
 gastronomic panorama this restaurant 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.480
 remember fusion 

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:27.700
 mostly Japanese but Asian 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.470
 also and Mediterranean there was a dish 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:31.090
 that was the most requested the most requested 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.410
 and that may sound a little weird to someone 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:34.300
 that there has never been but believe me 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:35.440
 it really works and it's very easy to 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.720
 do the only thing that are enough 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.700
 present ingredients and we said makes us 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.110
 missing salt recommended the mont jelly 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:43.150
 because it was a Welsh salt but good 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.980
 any salt is worth olive oil 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:48.100
 extra virgin black olives for the 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:49.989
 Tuna loin tuna tataki 300 310 and 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.640
 liters of soy sauce seriecitos de 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:53.080
 rice vinegar 15 grams of sugar and 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.410
 10 grated ginger for garlic 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:58.839
 white one quarter a piece of tooth 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:01.600
 tiny garlic 40 grams of almonds already 

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:03.790
 peeled one deciliter of water 200 oil 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.640
 refined olive 10 grams of bread crumb 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:08.290
 white a little bit of salt and for the sauce 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.510
 Samba made it a Japanese sauce 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.580
 soy sauce filter medium a 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:14.950
 deciliter of rice vinegar 5 grams 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.930

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.060
 grated and 10 grams of the white part 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:20.830
 from the leek all this is in our 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.720
 web section of esradio 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:24.070
 digital freedom because if there are many 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.500
 evident and have not been able to point 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.750
 it's worth the tataki that is here basically 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.080
 is to toast on the outside a 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.300
 piece 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.610
 of anything else and then leave it 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:35.200
 cool so let's clean the spine 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.850
 of skin tuna and if we can 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.380
 that we have it a bit in the form of 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.270
 truncheon that is shaped like mango 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.220
 because squared is going to be easier to 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.950
 do for its four faces worth what 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:46.900
 We cut made of this rectangular shape 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.400
 and we're going to mark what it is to mark your 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.350
 change color in a pan 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:54.500
 but an iron without doing it at 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:56.840
 unfair that is exactly fine 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.150
 let's mix the soy sauce the 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.670
 rice vinegar ginger and sugar 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:05.930
 cold mixing well so that it 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:07.280
 dissolve the sugar we are going to submerge 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:10.970
 these loins that we have marked when 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.860
 we had tempered in this marinade what 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.510
 we put anabel and we 'll show you 24 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.209
 hours if we see that it is not covered by 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.680
 the for the marinade so we are giving the 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:20.570
 back to every little bit that we remember 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.580
 several hours and it's already after we're going to 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:25.280
 make the white garlic in the thermomix with 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.900
 a mixer emulsion masters the garlic 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.950
 almond bread and water until 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.970
 is a fine and homogeneous texture 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.340
 we add a little bit of salt 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.780
 we try and see to see the other side 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.090
 we open the oil cans for the cream 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.700
 for the samba sauce he made the white part 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.690
 of the people we cut it well finite 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.610
 open now you are black olives and 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.020
 this is a bit of a roll what 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.610
 recommends chicote to know them a couple of 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:49.930
 days before leaving them in a tray 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.930
 stainless steel or earthenware 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:53.530
 in short, he was a pariah to lose the 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:54.880
 water gets dehydrated between is not so 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.890
 we can take it a little bit and already 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.600
 is 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:00.250
 we put the olives in a glass of the 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.830
 thermomix also the wta and we crush 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.330
 with the rest of the ingredients that 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:06.190
 I was a little liquid that is not done 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.600
 a plasta or nothing simply then 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.190
 we cut slices of more or less medium 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.620
 centimeter of the tuna that we have already 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:17.400
 repeated if half a centimeter common 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:19.680
 sashimi let's say a carpaccio we cut it 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.569
 we put a tray if nice and salt 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.790
 let's be slightly a little with the garlic 

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:25.079
 white with the south shanghai sauce it seems 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.659
 very complicated probably very easy 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:29.239
 that you the samba sauce did 

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:31.860
 simply as we have done 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:35.370
 braised and with a perfect white garlic and 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:37.049
 without the white garlic which take us 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.540
 basic not the basic I do it at home 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:40.920
 Seared Tataki I let it cool 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.780
 I take a lot in summer because more than 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:45.150
 leads to the beach expert is tupper plate 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.280
 perfect this recipe I say to say the 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.569
 copyright and me you narrowed my son Slip 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.159
 in kitchen channel that I was one day 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:52.379
 recording the recipe and there you have the 

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:55.349
 recipe as we did it in the 

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:58.739
 restaurant and it is therefore very well 

00:03:55.349 --> 00:04:02.189
 we have reached the end of the program 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:04.620
 total is six hours we would need more 

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:06.989
 time to treat everything around the world 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.939
 has to have super everything just measure 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:12.600
 all things in the news and then 

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:15.270
 get to the big p light with your program 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:18.060
 there are very important things and then also 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:20.790
 everything all everything is that radio 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:23.610
 is awesome 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:28.250
 and we will be able to hear others but 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:28.250
 it's worth it until tomorrow 

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:34.490
 yes
