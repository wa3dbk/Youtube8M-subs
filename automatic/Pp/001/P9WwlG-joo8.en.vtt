00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:35.820 
thought it was gonna make me better
going<00:03:33.100> to<00:03:33.310> the<00:03:33.430> whole<00:03:33.640> making<00:03:34.390> better<00:03:34.870> contact

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:39.780 
layups and as a point guard told
you<00:03:38.500> i<00:03:38.530> can't<00:03:38.800> done<00:03:39.070> so<00:03:39.220> i<00:03:39.250> figured<00:03:39.580> it<00:03:39.670> would

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
you i can't done so i figured it would

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.810 
you i can't done so i figured it would
make<00:03:39.970> me<00:03:40.180> better<00:03:41.040> we're<00:03:42.040> going<00:03:42.340> to<00:03:42.490> the<00:03:42.610> whole

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:42.820 
make me better we're going to the whole

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:45.180 
make me better we're going to the whole
changing<00:03:43.600> my<00:03:43.690> shot<00:03:43.989> so<00:03:44.230> i<00:03:44.260> could<00:03:44.530> make<00:03:44.739> it<00:03:44.920> but

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
changing my shot so i could make it but

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.090 
changing my shot so i could make it but
that<00:03:45.730> wasn't<00:03:46.120> the<00:03:46.150> case<00:03:46.390> so<00:03:46.690> i<00:03:46.930> probably

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:48.100 
that wasn't the case so i probably

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.130 
that wasn't the case so i probably
in<00:03:48.220> the<00:03:48.310> book<00:03:48.520> that<00:03:48.940> so<00:03:49.150> early<00:03:49.540> and

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:50.140 
in the book that so early and

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:52.770 
in the book that so early and
didn't<00:03:50.470> like<00:03:50.590> three<00:03:50.860> three<00:03:51.220> levels<00:03:51.670> so<00:03:52.090> I've

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:52.780 
didn't like three three levels so I've

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.510 
didn't like three three levels so I've
only<00:03:53.110> bought<00:03:53.380> level<00:03:53.739> once<00:03:53.950> or<00:03:54.160> that<00:03:54.370> only

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:54.520 
only bought level once or that only

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:56.729 
only bought level once or that only
increased<00:03:54.760> it<00:03:55.239> by<00:03:55.270> like<00:03:55.630> ten<00:03:55.989> percent<00:03:56.410> the

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:56.739 
increased it by like ten percent the

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:58.350 
increased it by like ten percent the
next<00:03:57.010> one<00:03:57.100> I<00:03:57.160> think<00:03:57.370> its<00:03:57.489> twenty<00:03:57.850> percent<00:03:58.120> in

00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:58.360 
next one I think its twenty percent in

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:59.699 
next one I think its twenty percent in
the<00:03:58.390> last<00:03:58.480> one<00:03:58.780> I<00:03:58.810> think<00:03:58.900> is<00:03:59.110> either<00:03:59.290> thirty<00:03:59.590> or

00:03:59.699 --> 00:03:59.709 
the last one I think is either thirty or

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:03.180 
the last one I think is either thirty or
forty<00:04:00.010> percent<00:04:00.310> but<00:04:01.120> I<00:04:01.860> ended<00:04:02.860> up<00:04:02.950> spending

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190 
forty percent but I ended up spending

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:07.890 
forty percent but I ended up spending
like<00:04:03.430> I<00:04:03.520> want<00:04:03.670> to<00:04:03.760> say<00:04:03.989> 600<00:04:04.989> or<00:04:05.200> 700<00:04:05.820> on<00:04:06.820> vc<00:04:07.630> on

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
like I want to say 600 or 700 on vc on

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:09.360 
like I want to say 600 or 700 on vc on
that<00:04:08.350> and<00:04:08.590> it<00:04:08.680> didn't<00:04:08.950> do<00:04:09.040> it<00:04:09.160> I<00:04:09.220> thought
