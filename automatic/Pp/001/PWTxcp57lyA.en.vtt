floor<00:00:35.250> right<00:00:35.340> now

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
floor right now

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.930 
floor right now
um<00:00:36.000> because<00:00:36.960> I<00:00:37.200> just<00:00:37.650> wanted<00:00:37.920> to<00:00:38.040> like<00:00:38.160> put<00:00:38.820> it

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
um because I just wanted to like put it

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.830 
um because I just wanted to like put it
on<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.570> floor<00:00:39.780> just<00:00:40.620> so<00:00:40.739> it's<00:00:40.860> easier<00:00:40.950> and<00:00:41.840> I

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
on the floor just so it's easier and I

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.680 
on the floor just so it's easier and I
put<00:00:43.650> the<00:00:43.980> chicken<00:00:44.400> wire<00:00:44.610> and<00:00:44.640> stuff<00:00:45.360> on<00:00:45.570> the

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
put the chicken wire and stuff on the

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.220 
put the chicken wire and stuff on the
inside<00:00:46.100> because<00:00:47.100> that<00:00:48.000> way<00:00:48.239> if<00:00:48.720> I<00:00:48.870> put<00:00:49.020> on<00:00:49.110> the

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
inside because that way if I put on the

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.290 
inside because that way if I put on the
outside<00:00:49.559> they<00:00:49.680> could<00:00:49.800> like<00:00:49.920> push<00:00:50.190> it<00:00:50.220> and<00:00:50.640> get

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
outside they could like push it and get

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.510 
outside they could like push it and get
out<00:00:51.480> but<00:00:52.140> this<00:00:52.260> way<00:00:52.410> they<00:00:52.530> can't<00:00:52.770> like<00:00:52.980> get<00:00:53.370> to

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
out but this way they can't like get to

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.189 
out but this way they can't like get to
it<00:00:53.640> and<00:00:53.730> I<00:00:53.820> tied<00:00:54.000> it<00:00:54.030> really<00:00:54.600> tight<00:00:54.900> and

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
be perfectly straight and I did have a

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.660 
be perfectly straight and I did have a
crack<00:02:15.480> right<00:02:15.660> here<00:02:15.720> but<00:02:16.320> I<00:02:16.350> just<00:02:16.740> like<00:02:16.980> took<00:02:17.400> I

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
crack right here but I just like took I

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.440 
crack right here but I just like took I
just<00:02:18.510> put<00:02:19.260> two<00:02:19.470> holes<00:02:19.650> right<00:02:20.340> there<00:02:20.580> and<00:02:20.880> then

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
just put two holes right there and then

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.320 
just put two holes right there and then
wired<00:02:21.720> it<00:02:21.930> together<00:02:22.290> really<00:02:22.590> tightly<00:02:23.090> using<00:02:24.090> a

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
wired it together really tightly using a

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:25.430 
wired it together really tightly using a
red<00:02:24.510> nose<00:02:24.720> you're<00:02:24.840> here<00:02:24.990> for<00:02:25.140> the<00:02:25.230> water

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
red nose you're here for the water

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.980 
red nose you're here for the water
bottle<00:02:25.770> I<00:02:25.950> just<00:02:26.580> drilled<00:02:26.850> a<00:02:26.970> hole<00:02:27.000> and<00:02:27.540> then

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
bottle I just drilled a hole and then

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:31.010 
bottle I just drilled a hole and then
that's<00:02:28.830> how<00:02:28.980> it<00:02:29.069> hangs<00:02:29.340> up<00:02:29.580> and<00:02:29.840> I'm<00:02:30.840> probably

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
that's how it hangs up and I'm probably

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.600 
that's how it hangs up and I'm probably
gonna<00:02:31.230> get<00:02:31.410> another<00:02:31.560> water<00:02:31.830> bottle<00:02:32.190> and<00:02:32.310> put
