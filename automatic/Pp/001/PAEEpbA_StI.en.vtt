higher level at this stage young
athletes<00:00:57.809> at<00:00:58.079> this<00:00:58.649> stage<00:00:58.890> learn<00:00:59.190> how<00:00:59.460> to

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
athletes at this stage learn how to

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.450 
athletes at this stage learn how to
train<00:00:59.969> for<00:01:00.780> this<00:01:00.930> reason<00:01:01.440> a<00:01:01.530> larger<00:01:01.950> amount<00:01:02.280> of

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
train for this reason a larger amount of

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.939 
train for this reason a larger amount of
time<00:01:02.730> is<00:01:02.969> spent<00:01:03.239> training<00:01:03.450> rather<00:01:04.229> than

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
time is spent training rather than

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:11.400 
time is spent training rather than
competing

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:11.410 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:14.500 

now<00:01:12.410> we<00:01:12.470> have<00:01:12.860> ball<00:01:13.130> drops<00:01:13.490> to<00:01:14.150> develop

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:14.510 
now we have ball drops to develop

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:16.510 
now we have ball drops to develop
reaction<00:01:15.050> speed<00:01:15.350> starting<00:01:15.920> ability<00:01:16.460> in

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
reaction speed starting ability in

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.650 
reaction speed starting ability in
agility<00:01:17.290> so<00:01:18.290> you<00:01:18.350> can<00:01:18.590> have<00:01:18.770> a<00:01:18.800> player<00:01:19.100> here

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:19.660 
agility so you can have a player here

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.750 
agility so you can have a player here
but<00:01:20.660> right<00:01:21.110> now<00:01:21.230> I'm<00:01:21.560> going<00:01:21.860> to<00:01:22.040> show<00:01:22.580> the

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:22.760 
but right now I'm going to show the

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.170 
but right now I'm going to show the
example<00:01:23.120> so<00:01:23.690> I<00:01:23.870> have<00:01:24.260> to<00:01:24.500> do<00:01:24.680> two<00:01:24.890> balls<00:01:25.160> on<00:01:26.060> the

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 
example so I have to do two balls on the

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.500 
example so I have to do two balls on the
side<00:01:26.210> of<00:01:26.420> my<00:01:26.720> body<00:01:27.530> and<00:01:27.830> I<00:01:28.340> will<00:01:28.550> let<00:01:28.730> one<00:01:29.240> ball

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:29.510 
side of my body and I will let one ball

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:32.050 
side of my body and I will let one ball
drop<00:01:30.380> whoops<00:01:31.130> sorry

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
drop whoops sorry

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.160 
drop whoops sorry
and<00:01:32.440> when<00:01:33.440> the<00:01:33.680> ball<00:01:33.890> drops<00:01:34.540> the<00:01:35.540> player<00:01:35.780> tries

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
and when the ball drops the player tries

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.920 
and when the ball drops the player tries
to<00:01:36.440> react<00:01:36.800> as<00:01:37.280> fast<00:01:37.400> as<00:01:38.000> possible<00:01:38.540> to<00:01:38.660> get<00:01:38.780> to

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:38.930 
to react as fast as possible to get to

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.100 
to react as fast as possible to get to
the<00:01:39.050> ball<00:01:39.290> what<00:01:40.070> is<00:01:40.280> very<00:01:40.520> important<00:01:41.270> at<00:01:41.930> the

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:45.800 
beginning to have athletic position any

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.880 
beginning to have athletic position any
other<00:01:46.400> things<00:01:46.760> if<00:01:47.150> I<00:01:47.360> let<00:01:47.540> the<00:01:47.840> ball<00:01:48.050> throw<00:01:48.770> up

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
other things if I let the ball throw up

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.580 
other things if I let the ball throw up
at<00:01:49.130> my<00:01:49.310> right<00:01:49.520> side<00:01:49.820> means<00:01:50.600> the<00:01:50.960> left<00:01:51.140> side<00:01:51.380> for
