sandwich lease let's talk about them

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:20.480 
sandwich lease let's talk about them
individually<00:00:17.369> here<00:00:18.830> property<00:00:19.830> rescue<00:00:20.340> is

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
individually here property rescue is

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.410 
individually here property rescue is
when<00:00:20.640> you<00:00:20.760> locate<00:00:21.740> underperforming<00:00:22.740> property

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:23.420 
when you locate underperforming property

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:27.290 
when you locate underperforming property
then<00:00:24.420> you<00:00:24.689> master<00:00:25.529> lease<00:00:25.800> it<00:00:26.099> for<00:00:26.760> a<00:00:26.820> break

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
then you master lease it for a break

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.370 
then you master lease it for a break
even<00:00:27.840> or<00:00:28.070> positive<00:00:29.070> cash<00:00:29.310> flow<00:00:29.640> and<00:00:30.380> then

even or positive cash flow and then

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.670 
even or positive cash flow and then
increase<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.430> net<00:00:32.820> operating<00:00:33.329> income<00:00:33.809> and
