00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
all new ones from the pictures that I've

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.229 
all new ones from the pictures that I've
seen<00:00:28.230> of<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.439> internals<00:00:28.829> and<00:00:29.040> so<00:00:29.939> be

00:00:30.229 --> 00:00:30.239 
seen of the internals and so be

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:32.780 
seen of the internals and so be
interesting<00:00:30.419> to<00:00:30.750> see<00:00:30.899> how<00:00:31.110> that<00:00:31.169> affects<00:00:31.860> the

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
interesting to see how that affects the

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.600 
interesting to see how that affects the
ranges<00:00:33.180> and<00:00:33.390> also<00:00:34.050> as<00:00:34.260> you<00:00:35.100> probably<00:00:35.340> already

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
ranges and also as you probably already

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.250 
ranges and also as you probably already
noticed<00:00:35.940> comes<00:00:36.540> with<00:00:36.720> this<00:00:36.810> really<00:00:36.870> cool

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
noticed comes with this really cool

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.340 
noticed comes with this really cool
stock<00:00:37.590> it's<00:00:37.890> very<00:00:38.400> solid<00:00:38.670> it's<00:00:39.350> slightly

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
stock it's very solid it's slightly

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.710 
stock it's very solid it's slightly
longer<00:00:40.590> than<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.130> retaliate<00:00:42.030> err<00:00:42.060> stocks<00:00:42.450> so

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:42.720 
longer than the retaliate err stocks so

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.000 
longer than the retaliate err stocks so
if<00:00:42.810> you<00:00:42.900> thought<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.170> retaliator<00:00:43.590> one<00:00:43.860> was

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
if you thought the retaliator one was

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.410 
if you thought the retaliator one was
too<00:00:44.160> short<00:00:44.370> this<00:00:44.640> one<00:00:44.850> should<00:00:45.030> be<00:00:45.060> just<00:00:45.330> the

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
too short this one should be just the

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.260 
too short this one should be just the
right<00:00:45.540> size<00:00:45.690> for<00:00:45.750> you<00:00:46.050> and<00:00:46.260> has<00:00:47.160> spots<00:00:47.760> to<00:00:48.030> hold

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
right size for you and has spots to hold

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.440 
right size for you and has spots to hold
ten<00:00:48.810> darts<00:00:49.079> on<00:00:49.230> it<00:00:49.350> so<00:00:49.940> nice<00:00:50.940> and<00:00:51.090> convenient

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:51.450 
ten darts on it so nice and convenient

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:53.300 
ten darts on it so nice and convenient
hold<00:00:51.840> a<00:00:51.930> full<00:00:52.110> second<00:00:52.680> side<00:00:52.800> of<00:00:52.890> ammo<00:00:53.040> for<00:00:53.220> your

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:53.310 
hold a full second side of ammo for your

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:55.310 
hold a full second side of ammo for your
stockade<00:00:53.670> but<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.390> important<00:00:54.780> question<00:00:55.110> is

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
stockade but the important question is

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:15.100 
stockade but the important question is
how<00:00:55.710> far<00:00:55.890> does<00:00:56.070> it<00:00:56.250> shoot<00:00:56.430> so<00:00:56.850> let's<00:00:57.120> find<00:00:57.329> out

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.110 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.090 

and<00:01:15.320> there's<00:01:15.980> all<00:01:16.190> 10<00:01:16.370> shots<00:01:16.670> fired<00:01:16.970> off<00:01:18.100> not

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
and there's all 10 shots fired off not

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.100 
and there's all 10 shots fired off not
too<00:01:19.370> shabby

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:20.110 
too shabby

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:22.870 
too shabby
one<00:01:21.110> thing<00:01:21.320> I<00:01:21.440> can<00:01:21.620> tell<00:01:21.650> you<00:01:21.890> right<00:01:22.160> now<00:01:22.220> I

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
one thing I can tell you right now I

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.700 
one thing I can tell you right now I
don't<00:01:23.480> know<00:01:23.630> how<00:01:23.750> a<00:01:23.780> Parenthood<00:01:24.230> will<00:01:24.320> be<00:01:24.470> but

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:24.710 
don't know how a Parenthood will be but

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.860 
don't know how a Parenthood will be but
the<00:01:24.830> motors<00:01:25.130> are<00:01:25.250> much<00:01:25.730> quieter<00:01:26.150> than<00:01:26.570> the

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:26.870 
the motors are much quieter than the

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:30.160 
the motors are much quieter than the
