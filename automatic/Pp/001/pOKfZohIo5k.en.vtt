holds three and this one has got one is

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:50.380 
holds three and this one has got one is
the<00:00:45.120> culprit<00:00:45.420> look<00:00:46.320> at<00:00:46.469> him<00:00:46.649> looking<00:00:47.579> innocent

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:50.390 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.430 

see<00:00:51.390> what<00:00:52.379> a<00:00:52.410> terror<00:00:52.800> oh<00:00:53.270> I'll<00:00:54.270> make<00:00:54.510> this<00:00:55.230> is

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
see what a terror oh I'll make this is

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.889 
see what a terror oh I'll make this is
going<00:00:55.710> to<00:00:55.860> be<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.219> outside<00:00:56.370> part<00:00:57.000> like<00:00:57.300> so<00:00:57.600> and

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
going to be the outside part like so and

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.930 
going to be the outside part like so and
I'll<00:00:58.620> make<00:00:58.829> another<00:00:59.070> piece<00:00:59.370> that<00:00:59.399> goes<00:00:59.730> up

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
I'll make another piece that goes up

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.590 
I'll make another piece that goes up
underneath<00:01:00.239> and<00:01:01.250> hopefully<00:01:02.250> this<00:01:02.699> will<00:01:02.940> work

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
underneath and hopefully this will work

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.260 
underneath and hopefully this will work
because<00:01:03.989> I<00:01:04.670> don't<00:01:05.670> know<00:01:05.760> what<00:01:05.850> else<00:01:05.970> to<00:01:06.060> do

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
because I don't know what else to do

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.550 
because I don't know what else to do

it's<00:02:08.979> not<00:02:09.130> working<00:02:10.050> take<00:02:11.050> em<00:02:11.230> off

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
it's not working take em off

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.420 
it's not working take em off
all<00:02:13.540> right<00:02:13.720> I<00:02:13.750> have<00:02:13.900> my<00:02:14.020> two<00:02:14.080> little<00:02:14.350> pieces<00:02:14.680> so

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
all right I have my two little pieces so

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.880 
all right I have my two little pieces so
I'm<00:02:15.910> going<00:02:16.090> to<00:02:16.150> make<00:02:16.330> this<00:02:16.540> one<00:02:16.810> here<00:02:17.200> but<00:02:17.650> what

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
I'm going to make this one here but what

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:23.760 
I'm going to make this one here but what
one<00:02:18.100> more<00:02:18.760> the<00:02:19.210> size<00:02:19.450> of<00:02:19.660> the<00:02:19.810> other<00:02:19.900> one<00:02:22.770> I'll

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
one more the size of the other one I'll

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:28.440 
one more the size of the other one I'll
hit<00:02:24.010> the<00:02:25.560> big<00:02:26.560> piece<00:02:26.800> of<00:02:26.830> metal<00:02:27.280> with<00:02:27.760> this

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
hit the big piece of metal with this

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.320 
hit the big piece of metal with this
little<00:02:28.780> thing<00:02:29.140> you<00:02:29.290> dog<00:02:29.470> the<00:02:29.650> device<00:02:30.330> chisel

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
little thing you dog the device chisel

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
little thing you dog the device chisel
that's<00:02:32.170> my<00:02:32.380> hammer<00:02:32.590> and<00:02:32.910> get<00:02:33.910> it<00:02:34.030> done<00:02:34.350> all

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
that's my hammer and get it done all

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.880 
that's my hammer and get it done all
right

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
right

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.770 
right
so<00:02:36.220> there's<00:02:36.490> my<00:02:36.640> pieces<00:02:38.130> that's<00:02:39.130> going<00:02:39.370> to<00:02:39.430> be

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
so there's my pieces that's going to be

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.630 
so there's my pieces that's going to be
the<00:02:40.780> bottom<00:02:41.080> part<00:02:41.110> then<00:02:42.010> this<00:02:42.190> one's<00:02:42.400> going<00:02:42.490> to

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
the bottom part then this one's going to

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.970 
the bottom part then this one's going to
go<00:02:42.700> on<00:02:42.910> top<00:02:43.150> I'll<00:02:43.810> have<00:02:44.020> to<00:02:44.170> punch<00:02:44.380> holes<00:02:44.590> with

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
go on top I'll have to punch holes with

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:50.330 
go on top I'll have to punch holes with
my<00:02:45.190> handy<00:02:46.140> puncher<00:02:47.140> er<00:02:47.200> which<00:02:47.680> is<00:02:47.860> here<00:02:48.040> and

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
my handy puncher er which is here and

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.750 
my handy puncher er which is here and
then<00:02:51.340> that<00:02:51.610> one's<00:02:51.850> gonna<00:02:52.180> go<00:02:53.430> in<00:02:54.430> here

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
then that one's gonna go in here

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.270 
then that one's gonna go in here
somewhere<00:02:55.090> like<00:02:55.540> so<00:02:55.920> probably<00:02:56.920> that<00:02:57.130> way

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
somewhere like so probably that way

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.440 
somewhere like so probably that way
actually<00:02:57.730> but<00:02:57.940> you<00:02:58.060> know<00:02:58.180> you<00:02:58.240> get<00:02:58.450> my<00:02:58.660> point

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
actually but you know you get my point

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.640 
actually but you know you get my point
what<00:03:01.450> I've<00:03:01.600> got<00:03:02.500> here<00:03:02.770> is<00:03:02.830> I've<00:03:03.310> got<00:03:03.340> this<00:03:04.650> some

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
what I've got here is I've got this some

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:06.990 
what I've got here is I've got this some
kind<00:03:05.890> of<00:03:05.980> silicon<00:03:06.520> sealer

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
kind of silicon sealer

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.580 
kind of silicon sealer
I<00:03:07.360> only<00:03:07.510> just<00:03:07.630> got<00:03:07.750> a<00:03:07.840> small<00:03:08.110> tube<00:03:08.380> because

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
I only just got a small tube because

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.110 
I only just got a small tube because
it's<00:03:08.709> a<00:03:08.830> small<00:03:09.070> job<00:03:09.310> and<00:03:09.490> you<00:03:09.550> know<00:03:09.670> it<00:03:09.970> always

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
it's a small job and you know it always

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.420 
it's a small job and you know it always
goes<00:03:10.270> bad<00:03:10.780> the<00:03:10.959> next<00:03:11.200> time<00:03:11.350> you<00:03:11.500> need<00:03:11.530> it<00:03:11.680> what

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
goes bad the next time you need it what

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.370 
goes bad the next time you need it what
I<00:03:12.459> was<00:03:12.760> looking<00:03:13.120> for<00:03:13.150> because<00:03:13.959> I<00:03:14.019> just<00:03:14.200> went

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
I was looking for because I just went

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.830 
I was looking for because I just went
through<00:03:14.440> all<00:03:14.650> the<00:03:14.920> ones<00:03:15.160> in<00:03:16.030> the<00:03:16.209> store<00:03:16.510> until

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
through all the ones in the store until

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.800 
through all the ones in the store until
I<00:03:17.650> found<00:03:18.040> one<00:03:18.310> that<00:03:18.580> says<00:03:18.910> if<00:03:19.360> you<00:03:19.630> can

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
I found one that says if you can

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.990 
I found one that says if you can
hopefully<00:03:20.140> read<00:03:20.560> that<00:03:20.769> there<00:03:21.040> it<00:03:21.760> is<00:03:21.970> a

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
hopefully read that there it is a

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.810 
hopefully read that there it is a
hundred<00:03:22.300> percent<00:03:22.450> silicon<00:03:23.230> I<00:03:24.040> don't<00:03:24.640> even

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820 
hundred percent silicon I don't even

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.280 
hundred percent silicon I don't even
care<00:03:25.090> it<00:03:25.209> says<00:03:25.390> roof<00:03:25.630> and<00:03:25.840> gutter<00:03:26.019> but

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
care it says roof and gutter but

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.610 
care it says roof and gutter but
whatever<00:03:27.450> one<00:03:28.450> hundred<00:03:28.690> percent<00:03:28.780> silicon<00:03:29.500> is

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
whatever one hundred percent silicon is

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.310 
whatever one hundred percent silicon is
important<00:03:30.100> because<00:03:30.250> this<00:03:30.700> gasket<00:03:31.630> here<00:03:32.200> is

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:32.320 
important because this gasket here is

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.380 
important because this gasket here is
silicon<00:03:33.310> rubber<00:03:33.489> pretty<00:03:34.030> much<00:03:34.180> the<00:03:34.360> only

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:34.390 
silicon rubber pretty much the only

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:36.390 
silicon rubber pretty much the only
thing<00:03:34.570> that's<00:03:34.900> going<00:03:35.050> to<00:03:35.140> glue<00:03:35.410> silicon

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
thing that's going to glue silicon

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.180 
thing that's going to glue silicon
rubber<00:03:36.580> is<00:03:36.790> more<00:03:37.120> silicon<00:03:37.810> rubber<00:03:37.959> and<00:03:38.290> so<00:03:38.980> I

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
rubber is more silicon rubber and so I

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:41.880 
rubber is more silicon rubber and so I
just<00:03:39.459> found<00:03:39.610> one<00:03:39.850> that<00:03:40.030> was<00:03:40.200> proper<00:03:41.200> silicon

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 
just found one that was proper silicon

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:43.680 
just found one that was proper silicon
because<00:03:42.310> they<00:03:42.549> add<00:03:42.730> all<00:03:42.760> sorts<00:03:43.090> of<00:03:43.269> crap<00:03:43.510> in

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690 
because they add all sorts of crap in

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:45.630 
because they add all sorts of crap in
there<00:03:43.840> and<00:03:44.049> it<00:03:44.200> needs<00:03:44.350> to<00:03:44.440> be<00:03:44.560> proper<00:03:45.160> 100

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
there and it needs to be proper 100

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.670 
there and it needs to be proper 100
percent<00:03:45.940> silicon<00:03:46.390> so<00:03:46.780> that<00:03:46.930> one<00:03:47.080> will<00:03:47.230> do<00:03:47.410> just

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
percent silicon so that one will do just

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:59.839 
percent silicon so that one will do just
fine<00:03:47.739> okay<00:03:49.500> so<00:03:50.500> I<00:03:50.799> need<00:03:51.220> to<00:03:51.640> punch<00:03:51.940> a<00:03:52.390> hole<00:03:52.420> here

00:03:59.839 --> 00:03:59.849 

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:03.979 

and<00:04:00.540> there<00:04:01.140> we<00:04:01.290> go<00:04:01.549> somewhere<00:04:02.549> in<00:04:02.609> the<00:04:02.640> room<00:04:02.989> is

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989 
and there we go somewhere in the room is

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:07.459 
and there we go somewhere in the room is
a<00:04:04.170> piece<00:04:04.439> of<00:04:04.469> steel<00:04:04.819> but<00:04:05.959> punch<00:04:06.959> a<00:04:07.079> nice<00:04:07.230> hole

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:07.469 
a piece of steel but punch a nice hole

00:04:07.469 --> 00:04:09.830 
a piece of steel but punch a nice hole
in<00:04:07.650> there<00:04:07.890> and<00:04:08.640> I'll<00:04:08.939> punch<00:04:09.209> a<00:04:09.359> hole<00:04:09.510> on<00:04:09.569> this
