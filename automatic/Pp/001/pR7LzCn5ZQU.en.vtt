00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:28.310
 hello today I want to share with you 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:30.470
 how I prepare my tea 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:33.079
 that my children and my children really like 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:35.350
 grandchildren I tell them it's the tea of â€‹â€‹the 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:35.350
 granny 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.960
 here in the teapot 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:47.899
 We are going to be placing anise grass 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:51.199
 luisa and tea the tea of your choice will 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:54.769
 I also put 6 odor granites 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:56.750
 cinnamon stick a cinnamon stick and 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:59.300
 I always have myself in my refrigerator 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:02.269
 as you know saved the shells 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:05.040
 of orange and lemon let's put a 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:07.830
 small piece of orange peel 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.080
 so I always made my mother and 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.480
 we liked a lot and that's the same 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.990
 I do it to my children and 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:20.000
 also now to my grandchildren 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.000
 already the water is freshly boiled 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:29.580
 we will place here in 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:29.580
 the three sachets of the infusions 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.780
 luisa anise and tea 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:41.780
 we put the cinnamon stick the cloves 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:45.729
 of smell and 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.729
 the bit of orange peel 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:52.720
 but it has to be inside 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.720
 and we simply add 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.930
 it's life just boiling water because 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.220
 we have to let this rest so 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.220
 minus three minutes 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.649

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:22.060
 breakfast and I also do it for 

00:02:17.719 --> 00:02:27.099
 Evenings when I want to drink something hot 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:27.099

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:46.490

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:56.730
