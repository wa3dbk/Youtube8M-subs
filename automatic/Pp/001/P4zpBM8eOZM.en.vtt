00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
to the higher perspective and you know

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.480 
to the higher perspective and you know
we've<00:02:24.390> been<00:02:24.420> kept<00:02:24.900> in<00:02:25.050> this<00:02:25.260> call<00:02:25.740> fence<00:02:26.130> for<00:02:26.460> a

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
we've been kept in this call fence for a

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:30.080 
we've been kept in this call fence for a
long<00:02:26.730> time<00:02:27.120> where<00:02:27.480> we<00:02:28.680> up<00:02:28.830> we<00:02:29.160> struggle

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
long time where we up we struggle

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.040 
long time where we up we struggle
no<00:02:30.420> focal<00:02:30.900> we<00:02:31.350> struggle<00:02:31.830> and<00:02:31.950> we<00:02:32.100> fight<00:02:33.050> trying

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
no focal we struggle and we fight trying

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.590 
no focal we struggle and we fight trying
to<00:02:34.440> make<00:02:35.010> our<00:02:35.190> world<00:02:35.430> a<00:02:35.550> better<00:02:35.670> place<00:02:35.820> when<00:02:36.450> in

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
to make our world a better place when in

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.020 
to make our world a better place when in
fact<00:02:36.630> it<00:02:37.530> isn't<00:02:37.740> about<00:02:38.040> a<00:02:38.100> struggle<00:02:38.760> for<00:02:38.790> a

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
fact it isn't about a struggle for a

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.230 
fact it isn't about a struggle for a
fight<00:02:39.360> and<00:02:40.040> so<00:02:41.040> I<00:02:41.070> ran<00:02:41.160> into<00:02:41.490> this<00:02:41.730> quote<00:02:42.030> by

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:42.240 
fight and so I ran into this quote by

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.420 
fight and so I ran into this quote by
Buckminster<00:02:42.930> Fuller<00:02:42.960> that<00:02:43.440> kind<00:02:43.680> of<00:02:43.800> sums<00:02:44.160> up

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
Buckminster Fuller that kind of sums up

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.350 
Buckminster Fuller that kind of sums up
for<00:02:44.730> me<00:02:45.740> somewhat<00:02:46.740> the<00:02:46.890> Blood<00:02:47.130> Moon<00:02:47.160> the<00:02:47.790> grand

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
for me somewhat the Blood Moon the grand

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.470 
for me somewhat the Blood Moon the grand
Cardinal<00:02:48.660> cross<00:02:49.110> and<00:02:49.440> he<00:02:49.800> says<00:02:50.180> you<00:02:51.180> never

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
Cardinal cross and he says you never

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.050 
Cardinal cross and he says you never
change<00:02:52.050> things<00:02:52.440> by<00:02:52.709> fighting<00:02:53.070> the<00:02:53.250> existing

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
change things by fighting the existing

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.410 
change things by fighting the existing
reality<00:02:54.750> to<00:02:55.590> change<00:02:55.980> something<00:02:56.370> you<00:02:56.730> build<00:02:57.030> a

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
reality to change something you build a

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.760 
reality to change something you build a
new<00:02:57.750> model<00:02:58.140> and<00:02:58.590> make<00:02:59.250> it<00:02:59.520> replace<00:03:00.420> the<00:03:00.770> other

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
new model and make it replace the other

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:03.620 
new model and make it replace the other
model<00:03:02.130> obsolete<00:03:02.700> making<00:03:03.090> the<00:03:03.209> other<00:03:03.330> model

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
model obsolete making the other model

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.470 
model obsolete making the other model
obsolete<00:03:04.320> and<00:03:05.100> I<00:03:05.220> believe<00:03:05.580> that's<00:03:05.760> exactly

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
obsolete and I believe that's exactly

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.360 
obsolete and I believe that's exactly
what's<00:03:06.810> been<00:03:06.990> going<00:03:07.290> on<00:03:07.410> especially<00:03:07.650> since

December 12 2012 and now with the coming
of<00:03:11.970> the<00:03:13.310> intensification<00:03:14.310> of<00:03:14.910> opposition<00:03:15.780> and

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
of the intensification of opposition and

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:17.810 
of the intensification of opposition and
that's<00:03:16.170> what<00:03:16.410> the<00:03:16.530> grand<00:03:16.770> Cardinal<00:03:17.070> cross<00:03:17.550> is
