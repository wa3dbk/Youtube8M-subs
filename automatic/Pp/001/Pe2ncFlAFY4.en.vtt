00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.700
 hola que tal I am the closed yesterday and the day 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.620
 today we are going to make a saucer 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.020
 millennium from the ports of 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:10.280
 hamburg dating back to the 18th century and you 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.280
 let's make hamburgers 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.980
 the origin of this dish is usually a 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.689
 little fought in Americans and 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.390
 Germans but the historical origins 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:22.619
 oldest dating from Germany already know 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.779
 I'm going to leave the basic recipe 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.789
 It will look like a chef-style burger 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.470
 there are many variants there are many ways 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.509
 of them we can do even 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.769
 of flavors this is the way in which to 

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:33.510
 I liked what you found 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.980
 the best flavor to make 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.540
 burgers already know many of the 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.550
 ingredients are also optional 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.019
 depending on those who like the 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.089
 any if you like the video of 

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:43.829

00:00:42.089 --> 00:00:45.180
 and subscribe to the channel if it is still 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.920
 he does not do it so that they receive the 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.930
 Notification of when I upload a video 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:53.120
 new without more formally all I leave 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.120
 and we start with our chau dish 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:59.590
 shut up for our burgers what 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:02.080
 first thing that I'm going to do is gild myths and 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:04.750
 not this if you do not have enough fat 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:06.280
 it is no longer necessary to put more oil 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.320
 meanwhile I will go to bite my 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.150
 other ingredients I'm going to chop half 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:13.619
 small onion a quarter of onion 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:13.619
 big very thinly 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.950
 and I'm going to reserve a moment and I'm going to 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:22.310
 chop a garlic clove equal very 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.310
 finely 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:31.960
 and we reserve and wait for it to be 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.960
 our car but seeing right now 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.930
 I will highlight some sprigs of parsley 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.250
 and now we are going to apply very finally 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.500
 our parsley 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.960
 we tighten very well to make it more 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.560
 easy and we run less risk of 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.560
 cut us 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:02:00.380
 here it is ready we reserve our 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:02.780
 bacon and it's good golden now I'm going 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:05.119
 to reserve and they will ask why because 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.159
 first doremi bacon to lisbon the 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:09.289
 answer what I want is to take the 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:11.629
 fat that you release this bacon since 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:14.150
 it contains a lot of flavor we light 

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:17.390
 our fire again and we're going to 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:19.010
 add our down and our onion 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.290
 In case you are not going to use 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.269
 bacon on your burgers or go to 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.260
 use for later add be here and 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:28.099
 this onion well in play sugar me 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.959
 simply with this step I am 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:32.360
 picking up the flavor of the bacon for 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:35.060
 integrate to my meat and we reserve 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:37.880
 now we are going to prepare our meat 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:40.489
 it's something extremely easy and simple I'm going to 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:43.310
 use half a kilogram of meat this can 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:45.799
 be of beef or beef 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:48.500
 combined this time I have it 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:51.110
 combined but you choose the one 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:53.450
 be of your liking I will add a piece 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:56.209
 of egg I will add 6 are sauce 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.650
 Maggie 6 are from English sauce there are many 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:59.680
 I have been asked what is a shot 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:02.280
 this is a soft 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.280
 two 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:08.450
 4 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:11.599
 the parsley that we chop our garlic and 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:14.650
 onion that we chop and fry 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:14.650
 add a little pepper 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:19.160
 a little bit of salt 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:23.530
 two spoonfuls of capsa 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:30.709
 and a teaspoon of mustard and now if 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.680
 we have all this we have to mix everything 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:35.569
 very very well this is the basic recipe already 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.849
 they know but we can do 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:39.829
 flavored burgers like this that 

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:42.310
 flavored hamburgers instead of 

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:45.409
 add for example cats and mustard 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:47.750
 we can add about 4 tablespoons of 

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:49.639
 barbecue if you like the recipe because they 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:52.819
 I leave the link and with this they will get 

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:54.889
 a hamburger to wash viking of equal 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:57.950
 way we can add a little bit of 

00:03:54.889 --> 00:04:00.439
 pineapple and ham chopped because not a 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:02.209
 Hawaiian hamburger from sand there 

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:04.340
 many options there are many ways to 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:06.290
 make the burgers and also 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:08.239
 remember that you are the chef in your 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:10.280
 kitchen can modify or change 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:13.069
 some of the ingredients that you 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:15.500
 consider necessary and we will have to 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:18.620
 have a firm mix and with 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:20.630
 consistency is easily moldable and 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:23.840
 our flesh is completely 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:25.130
 integrated with the other ingredients and 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.349
 now if we are going to form our 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:29.780
 burgers for this I'm going to take a 

00:04:27.349 --> 00:04:30.800
 little of my prepared meat I'm taking 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:32.690
 approximately 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.879
 fist because I'm going to make some 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:37.099
 burgers a little big here is already going to 

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:39.229
 depend a little on the bread they have or the 

00:04:37.099 --> 00:04:41.690
 size they want from their burger what 

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:44.210
 we can put in some sun and paper 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:45.919
 or in the middle of two bags and we're going to 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:49.039
 crush if they have machine to 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:51.590
 tortillas is perfect and if I'm not going to 

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:53.930
 do with a talk it just seems 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:56.780
 a little here I have my meat ready for 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:58.759
 burgers ready to fry as data 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:01.490
 curious, I recommend you do your 

00:04:58.759 --> 00:05:04.009
 meat a little bigger than your bread already 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:06.229
 that this is going to shrink we can also 

00:05:04.009 --> 00:05:08.569
 put it to freeze and use it when 

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:10.580
 we want but as to show more than 

00:05:08.569 --> 00:05:13.069
