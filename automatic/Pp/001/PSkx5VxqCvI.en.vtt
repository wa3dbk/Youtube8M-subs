00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:09.960
 already started the world cup and it is not going 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.410
 have a cup and that cup of the world there 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.599
 I remembered the good old days playing 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:18.690
 football video games in my childhood 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:21.630
 it was a fever high in the championships and such 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:24.359
 You know my mega drive was the one with ten 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.970
 memory games among them had a 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.939
 I play well shearing football that 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.610
 honestly to this day I do not know how 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.930
 played this was the game of the 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.790
 world of italy 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.719
 unlike anything I've ever seen 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:43.230
 until then the vision was from above and was 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.940
 Up you just saw the players' heads and 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.820
 a little of your shoulders 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.070
 This game was very difficult. 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.289
 difficult even more so for a 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.750
 child I remember when it came time to 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.660
 choose your team you saw directly 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.530
 on the world map and not just the little flag 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.289
 of team 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.449
 I think this was the first game 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.880
 that I played in my life 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.900
 although it is strange, it deserves my 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.820
 respect 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.280
 one of the most famous football games 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:15.299
 formerly was the international 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:18.000
 superstar soccer but how br is well has 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.659
 hacked version of this game and I think 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.150
 yea 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:25.490
 This opening was more famous here. 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.490
 there is classic marked generations 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:49.470
 the line playing rock and still has a 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:53.009
 reason even more special for this for 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:55.800
 garbage this dummy player got so 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:58.800
 famous as the real players 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:02.130
 It is such a myth that it appeared in the 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:05.280
 new has got even that stick I have not seen 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:08.100
 I saw only a little, I only knew this one. 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.739
 game because a friend of the school had him 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:13.320
 Then I was asked to borrow belÃª. 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:16.140
 as well as several other games at the time 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:18.330
 this game has a lot more things to do 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.150
 do even training 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:23.370
 it was too fucking fuck himself was 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.310
 get in front of the goal to hit 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.410
 and send a bike and 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:31.080
 since we mentioned ronaldinho 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:34.890
 Do you know the pelÃ© soccer game? 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:37.440
 not obviously an homage to the great 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:40.110
 King of football is very simple. 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:43.230
 also very old are just a few 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:46.140
 colorful dots of the screen was released 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.810
 for the atari the super nintendo mega drive 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:51.150
 are full of football games 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:55.410
 This is not news but the nintendo 64 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:58.019
 also has is the sorry 98 and remember 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:00.570
 much and nobody takes the details already 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:04.070
 began to draw more attention as 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:06.540
 twisted physical narration and everything else 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:09.840
 logically you remember the fifth 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.380
 street on playstation 2 classic bitch 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.290
 Shit 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:16.320
 I played too much this way if you did not play 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:18.470
 or not remembered fifa street was a 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:22.019
 game where you did dribbles 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:25.200
 sensational a really hot air game 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:27.900
 but it was certainly on the playstation that 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.540
 I actually played football games the 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:33.480

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.049
 That's good, because these are good times. 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:39.390
 Right? 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:41.880

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.660
