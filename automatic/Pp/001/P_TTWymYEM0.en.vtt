 track I have my free time so 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.800
 I decided to take a walk with fury in the 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.120
 forest 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.190
 I never imagined that one of my greatest 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.960
 fears is to discard the heaven of 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:09.890
 night so I decided to go back home 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:13.700
 when suddenly I feel a chorizo ​​is 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:16.329
 in the head and that there is a faint 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.329

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:27.390
 an unknown place I did not know there was 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:30.180
 gone far and I heard the barking 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:34.290
 to drain and I've been very strong when going 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:36.570
 to look for them instructions help with 34 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.479

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:42.119
 where you develop, look for the keys 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.590
 the keys are closer than they 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.729
 imagine only that they are cared for 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.729
 our solos 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.610

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.680
 I could ask 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:42.620
 the cries of nowhere 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:44.380
