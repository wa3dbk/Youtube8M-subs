going over the design of it the feature

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.000

how<00:02:49.090> actually<00:02:49.510> the<00:02:49.870> multi-touch<00:02:50.380> works<00:02:50.739> and

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
how actually the multi-touch works and

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.039 
how actually the multi-touch works and
all<00:02:51.579> that<00:02:51.910> and<00:02:52.090> all<00:02:52.299> you<00:02:52.359> can<00:02:52.600> do<00:02:52.840> with<00:02:52.959> the

all that and all you can do with the

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:54.300 
all that and all you can do with the
multi-touch<00:02:53.530> so<00:02:53.680> definitely<00:02:53.980> is<00:02:54.100> a<00:02:54.130> big

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
multi-touch so definitely is a big
