00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:04.980
 You want me to put the hammer out ?! 

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:13.460
 Finished? 

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:16.080
 Hello. 

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:17.160
 Are you still here? 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:17.840
 Here. 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.000
 Why didn't you escape while we discussed our disagreements? 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.044
 I will not say. 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.600
 Okay, we're not gonna bring it back to the base. Tuti is licking something. 

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.440
 That's how the WINDOWS should have ended 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:42.420
 Shield! 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:43.880
 Gentlemen, here you go. 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:45.280
 Su-dÃ¡! 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.240
 Here comes the hammer! 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.220
 Back from where you came from! 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.960
 Say again. Say once more, "What?" 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:03.180
 Nikita istenke, nyikhaj istenke, nyikhaj istenke. 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.000
 Nuclear Charge! 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:14.560
 Guys, have you eaten gyros? 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.420
 Are you selling food here? 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:18.920
 Yeah. 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.680
 You never eat gyros? 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.140
 GYROS! 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.360
 Uh, why am I sitting on Hulk's lap? 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.340
 New! 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:27.400
 Hey, 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.740
 I'm Batman. 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.220
 You want to know who's under the mask? 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:31.980
 Why?! 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:33.260
 Khm, so ... 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.260
 it was a nice little weekend. 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:36.400
 It's not an expression. 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.380
 You were first against each other, 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:39.740
 then kill your buddy 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:40.940
 you will suddenly be friends. 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.640
 Has anyone died? 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.040
 Well, what ... 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.040
 you missed that part a bit. 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.600
 But your friend wanted to be a sweetheart anyway later. 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.340
 Immediately after sleeping in the sky and suddenly you have learned to deal with your anger. 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.935
 And you stole a motor? 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.300
 Details are not important. 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.940
 Details like Odin could send Thor back? 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:01.440
 We? 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.420
 Or does the professor make a chance to close the gate? 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:05.880
 That's good for you. 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.280
 Or is Chitaurik all dying in "Foolish Shadows" style? 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:10.160
 Yeah. 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.420
 One chance after another. 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.760
 Hmm ... as you don't go into the accounts? 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.920
 Do you know what I think? 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.600
 I think you're just jealous, 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:20.780
 we have done such a great job. 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:21.680
 Perfectly! 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:22.540
 Verily! 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:25.340
 Sorry, guys. 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:26.540
 I'm not jealous, 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.860
 I'm Batman. 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.620
 I would be jealous if I wasn't like you together. 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:32.941
 If I couldn't fly, 

00:02:32.941 --> 00:02:37.361
 or shoot lasers or catch missiles, or see them very far, or crush buildings, 

00:02:37.361 --> 00:02:38.841
 or wearing red-blue ... 

00:02:38.841 --> 00:02:40.701
 What? You're starting to get lost! 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:42.940
 We have decided too many records! 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.620
 We do not hear of this many soldiers! 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:51.540
 Gyrooos. 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.860
 Natasha, do you have a wound on my face? 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:08.300
 It hurts enough. 

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:10.260
 Right here. 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:13.100
 Not here, but not here 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.160
 but right here. 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:16.580
 No, it's all right. 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:17.900
 Hey, guys, it's time, dress up! 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.180
 MY GOODNESS! 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:20.458
 What happened to your face? 

00:03:20.458 --> 00:03:20.958
 I knew it!
