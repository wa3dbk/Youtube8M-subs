00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:35.470 
but I thought it would be there's a a

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:37.710 
but I thought it would be there's a a
great<00:01:35.890> deal<00:01:36.040> of<00:01:36.130> interest<00:01:36.520> in<00:01:36.880> the<00:01:37.450> rest<00:01:37.630> of

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:37.720 
great deal of interest in the rest of

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.300 
great deal of interest in the rest of
the<00:01:37.780> world<00:01:37.990> it<00:01:38.230> actually<00:01:38.890> seems<00:01:39.160> to<00:01:39.220> be

the world it actually seems to be

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.050 
the world it actually seems to be
growing<00:01:39.640> in<00:01:40.300> in<00:01:41.080> what<00:01:41.560> free<00:01:41.860> did<00:01:42.460> so<00:01:42.820> I<00:01:42.850> thought

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
growing in in what free did so I thought

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.450 
growing in in what free did so I thought
it<00:01:43.150> would<00:01:43.210> be<00:01:43.330> a<00:01:43.360> good<00:01:43.480> idea<00:01:43.630> to<00:01:44.280> dig<00:01:45.280> be
