00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:57.620 
don't necessarily have to do the same

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.920 
don't necessarily have to do the same
color<00:01:57.890> pattern<00:01:58.370> but<00:01:59.090> I'm<00:01:59.270> not<00:01:59.570> because<00:01:59.870> I

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
color pattern but I'm not because I

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.980 
color pattern but I'm not because I
wanted<00:02:00.170> to<00:02:00.230> look<00:02:00.380> more<00:02:00.590> carefree<00:02:01.220> and<00:02:01.580> I<00:02:02.390> think

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
wanted to look more carefree and I think

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.170 
wanted to look more carefree and I think
it<00:02:03.080> would<00:02:03.200> look<00:02:03.350> cooler<00:02:03.680> with<00:02:03.980> the<00:02:04.010> tie<00:02:04.310> I<00:02:04.340> like

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.390 
it would look cooler with the tie I like
not<00:02:05.390> having<00:02:05.420> an<00:02:05.960> exact<00:02:06.380> pattern<00:02:06.920> so<00:02:07.190> that's

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:07.400 
not having an exact pattern so that's

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:23.980 
not having an exact pattern so that's
what<00:02:07.520> I'm<00:02:07.610> doing<00:02:07.850> for<00:02:08.000> my<00:02:08.060> shift

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:25.960

making<00:02:28.730> sure<00:02:28.910> that<00:02:29.120> all<00:02:29.330> the<00:02:29.480> marker<00:02:29.810> bleeds

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
making sure that all the marker bleeds

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:36.990 
making sure that all the marker bleeds
until<00:02:30.560> it<00:02:30.650> looks<00:02:30.800> skydive

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.690

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.580 
on the heels of shoe you just want to
continue<00:02:40.150> adding<00:02:40.300> the<00:02:40.480> dots<00:02:40.810> with<00:02:41.080> the<00:02:41.110> marker
