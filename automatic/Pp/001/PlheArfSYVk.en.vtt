going to fully clear the gap you

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:54.520 
going to fully clear the gap you
initiate<00:01:52.549> a<00:01:52.580> backflip<00:01:53.299> that<00:01:53.960> the<00:01:54.080> rear<00:01:54.320> wheel

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
initiate a backflip that the rear wheel

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.980 
initiate a backflip that the rear wheel
hits<00:01:54.830> the<00:01:55.040> object<00:01:55.159> first<00:01:55.790> and<00:01:56.180> prevents<00:01:56.840> the

hits the object first and prevents the

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.800 
hits the object first and prevents the
flip<00:01:57.460> as<00:01:58.460> the<00:01:58.670> front<00:01:58.909> wheel<00:01:59.090> of<00:01:59.240> the<00:01:59.360> bike<00:01:59.540> is

flip as the front wheel of the bike is

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.170 
flip as the front wheel of the bike is
forced<00:02:00.229> down

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:01.180 
forced down

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.260

a<00:02:01.210> lot<00:02:01.780> of<00:02:01.810> momentum<00:02:02.560> so<00:02:03.190> the<00:02:03.310> rear<00:02:03.550> wheel<00:02:03.850> will

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
a lot of momentum so the rear wheel will

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.830 
a lot of momentum so the rear wheel will
climb<00:02:04.780> the<00:02:05.050> obstacle<00:02:05.590> it<00:02:05.740> hits<00:02:06.600> sometimes<00:02:07.600> you

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
climb the obstacle it hits sometimes you

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.010 
climb the obstacle it hits sometimes you
can<00:02:07.990> also<00:02:08.200> use<00:02:08.740> the<00:02:08.979> basic<00:02:09.460> jump<00:02:09.910> if<00:02:10.750> the

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 
can also use the basic jump if the

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.440 
can also use the basic jump if the
terrain<00:02:11.260> allows<00:02:11.800> you<00:02:12.100> to<00:02:12.370> you<00:02:13.150> can<00:02:13.300> actually
