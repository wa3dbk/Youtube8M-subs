now<00:00:17.910> I<00:00:17.940> mean<00:00:18.240> I<00:00:18.449> the<00:00:18.779> mobs<00:00:19.109> like<00:00:19.350> two<00:00:19.560> and<00:00:19.680> a

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
now I mean I the mobs like two and a

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.260 
now I mean I the mobs like two and a
half<00:00:19.830> minutes<00:00:20.070> and<00:00:20.400> that<00:00:20.670> leaves<00:00:20.850> a<00:00:21.000> minute

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
half minutes and that leaves a minute

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.150 
half minutes and that leaves a minute
and<00:00:21.449> 10<00:00:21.810> seconds<00:00:22.140> left<00:00:22.350> in<00:00:22.439> the<00:00:22.560> game<00:00:22.590> play<00:00:22.980> and

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
and 10 seconds left in the game play and

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.029 
and 10 seconds left in the game play and
so<00:00:23.640> I<00:00:23.699> go<00:00:23.939> on<00:00:24.090> an<00:00:24.210> absolute<00:00:24.660> here<00:00:24.869> I<00:00:24.900> get<00:00:25.109> a<00:00:25.140> 27

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
so I go on an absolute here I get a 27

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.960 
so I go on an absolute here I get a 27
gunstreak<00:00:26.490> and<00:00:26.789> i'd<00:00:27.539> say<00:00:27.990> around<00:00:28.310> a<00:00:29.310> minute

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
gunstreak and i'd say around a minute

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.440 
gunstreak and i'd say around a minute
and<00:00:30.090> 10<00:00:30.359> seconds<00:00:30.750> 70<00:00:31.140> seconds<00:00:31.529> so<00:00:32.040> this<00:00:32.279> is

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:32.450 
and 10 seconds 70 seconds so this is

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:34.639 
and 10 seconds 70 seconds so this is
better<00:00:33.450> than<00:00:33.570> my<00:00:33.780> fastest<00:00:34.200> milla<00:00:34.410> by<00:00:34.590> two

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
better than my fastest milla by two

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.520 
better than my fastest milla by two
seconds<00:00:35.219> plus<00:00:35.489> i<00:00:35.790> get<00:00:36.120> 3x<00:00:36.570> four<00:00:36.930> kills<00:00:37.140> so<00:00:37.380> this

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
seconds plus i get 3x four kills so this

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:38.810 
seconds plus i get 3x four kills so this
would<00:00:37.710> definitely<00:00:37.800> definitely<00:00:38.370> would<00:00:38.790> have
