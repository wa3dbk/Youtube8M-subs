a proper drop nice snap and watching him
describe<00:00:18.630> it<00:00:18.779> and<00:00:18.900> watching<00:00:19.230> this<00:00:19.580> cool<00:00:20.580> clip

describe it and watching this cool clip
going<00:00:21.119> round<00:00:21.270> and<00:00:21.449> round<00:00:21.510> was<00:00:21.900> pretty<00:00:22.140> sick<00:00:22.439> I

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
going round and round was pretty sick I

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.019 
going round and round was pretty sick I
mean<00:00:22.830> I<00:00:22.980> actually<00:00:23.279> learned<00:00:23.670> a<00:00:23.730> couple<00:00:23.939> things

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
mean I actually learned a couple things

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.089 
mean I actually learned a couple things
myself<00:00:24.269> so<00:00:24.720> hopefully<00:00:25.710> you<00:00:25.830> learned

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
myself so hopefully you learned

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.679 
myself so hopefully you learned
something<00:00:26.220> -<00:00:26.550> take<00:00:27.029> it<00:00:27.090> away<00:00:27.210> Sasha<00:00:29.689> when

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
something - take it away Sasha when

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:31.669 
something - take it away Sasha when
you're<00:00:30.840> doing<00:00:30.960> a<00:00:31.019> snap<00:00:31.230> you<00:00:31.380> want<00:00:31.500> to<00:00:31.560> make

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
you're doing a snap you want to make

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.090 
you're doing a snap you want to make
sure<00:00:31.710> that<00:00:31.890> you<00:00:32.040> have<00:00:32.250> enough<00:00:33.180> speed<00:00:34.100> you

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
sure that you have enough speed you

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.470 
sure that you have enough speed you
rather<00:00:35.309> want<00:00:35.550> to<00:00:35.610> be<00:00:35.670> burning<00:00:36.059> speed<00:00:36.300> before

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
rather want to be burning speed before

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.150 
rather want to be burning speed before
the<00:00:36.719> snap<00:00:36.899> then<00:00:37.590> they're<00:00:38.370> not<00:00:38.760> having<00:00:39.030> enough

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:40.160 
the snap then they're not having enough

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.470 
the snap then they're not having enough
and<00:00:41.160> if<00:00:41.430> you're<00:00:41.550> able<00:00:41.670> to<00:00:41.790> control<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.300> speed

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
and if you're able to control the speed

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.569 
and if you're able to control the speed
you<00:00:42.600> know<00:00:42.690> that<00:00:42.840> gives<00:00:43.020> you<00:00:43.140> a<00:00:43.170> huge<00:00:43.500> power<00:00:44.250> and

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
you know that gives you a huge power and

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.420 
you know that gives you a huge power and
huge<00:00:44.820> spray<00:00:45.210> displacement<00:00:45.960> and<00:00:46.140> we<00:00:47.100> can<00:00:47.219> go<00:00:47.309> on

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
huge spray displacement and we can go on

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:48.619 
huge spray displacement and we can go on
and<00:00:47.579> that<00:00:47.670> but<00:00:47.940> that's<00:00:48.239> that's<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.510> most

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
and that but that's that's the most

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.479 
and that but that's that's the most
important<00:00:49.020> thing<00:00:49.050> speed<00:00:49.410> is<00:00:49.620> your<00:00:50.070> number<00:00:50.309> one

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
important thing speed is your number one

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.299 
important thing speed is your number one
ingredient<00:00:51.469> the<00:00:52.469> next<00:00:52.649> thing<00:00:52.770> you<00:00:52.829> need<00:00:52.920> is<00:00:53.039> a

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
ingredient the next thing you need is a

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.549 
ingredient the next thing you need is a
steep<00:00:53.780> section<00:00:54.780> if<00:00:54.930> you're<00:00:55.050> going<00:00:55.350> to<00:00:55.469> the

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
steep section if you're going to the

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.740 
steep section if you're going to the
flat<00:00:56.010> open-face<00:00:56.489> you're<00:00:57.329> gonna<00:00:57.449> end<00:00:57.690> up

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
flat open-face you're gonna end up

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.750 
flat open-face you're gonna end up
turning<00:00:57.960> back<00:00:58.289> into<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.770> wave<00:00:58.920> which<00:00:59.280> doesn't

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
turning back into the wave which doesn't

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.959 
turning back into the wave which doesn't
give<00:00:59.910> you<00:01:00.030> much<00:01:00.500> much<00:01:01.500> control<00:01:01.920> once<00:01:02.789> you're

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
give you much much control once you're

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:03.380 
give you much much control once you're
done

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
done

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.509 
done
so<00:01:03.660> nice<00:01:04.199> and<00:01:04.409> vertical<00:01:04.530> and<00:01:05.040> finish<00:01:05.400> your

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
so nice and vertical and finish your

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.270 
so nice and vertical and finish your
snap<00:01:05.760> going<00:01:06.060> down<00:01:06.299> into<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:06.840> flats<00:01:07.140> or<00:01:07.890> back

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
snap going down into the flats or back

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.780 
snap going down into the flats or back
on<00:01:08.520> onto<00:01:09.479> open-face<00:01:10.049> so<00:01:10.530> I'll<00:01:11.310> get<00:01:11.580> to<00:01:11.670> that

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
on onto open-face so I'll get to that

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.960 
on onto open-face so I'll get to that
later<00:01:11.909> in<00:01:12.479> this<00:01:13.320> frame<00:01:13.590> I've<00:01:14.220> approached<00:01:14.820> the

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
later in this frame I've approached the

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.520 
later in this frame I've approached the
flat<00:01:15.240> section<00:01:15.450> of<00:01:15.600> the<00:01:15.689> wave<00:01:15.810> down<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.229> bottom

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
flat section of the wave down the bottom

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.030 
flat section of the wave down the bottom
and<00:01:17.270> I've<00:01:18.270> changed<00:01:18.600> my<00:01:18.869> direction<00:01:19.049> you<00:01:19.920> can

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
and I've changed my direction you can

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.499 
and I've changed my direction you can
see<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.280> spray<00:01:20.490> all<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.759> spray<00:01:21.090> coming<00:01:21.330> off

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
see the spray all the spray coming off

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.080 
see the spray all the spray coming off
my<00:01:22.080> outside<00:01:22.470> rail<00:01:22.680> once<00:01:23.549> I've<00:01:23.729> changed<00:01:24.030> my

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
my outside rail once I've changed my

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.969 
my outside rail once I've changed my
direction<00:01:24.240> I'm<00:01:24.540> coming<00:01:24.810> up<00:01:24.960> towards<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.590> the

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
direction I'm coming up towards the the

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.830 
direction I'm coming up towards the the
section<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.610> loop<00:01:26.820> that<00:01:26.970> I<00:01:27.030> want<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.420> I<00:01:27.659> don't

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
section the loop that I want to I don't

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.170 
section the loop that I want to I don't
want<00:01:28.020> to<00:01:28.110> do<00:01:28.229> my<00:01:28.380> snap<00:01:28.619> on<00:01:28.829> you're<00:01:29.759> gonna<00:01:29.909> see

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
want to do my snap on you're gonna see

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.469 
want to do my snap on you're gonna see
the<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:31.110> spray<00:01:31.439> actually<00:01:32.240> diminishes<00:01:33.240> off<00:01:33.360> my

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
the the spray actually diminishes off my

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.020 
the the spray actually diminishes off my
outside<00:01:33.810> rail<00:01:34.049> as<00:01:34.320> I<00:01:34.650> shift<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.100> weight<00:01:35.280> onto

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
outside rail as I shift the weight onto

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.270 
outside rail as I shift the weight onto
the<00:01:36.540> outside<00:01:36.900> rail<00:01:37.170> and<00:01:37.439> start<00:01:37.770> turning<00:01:38.040> the

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
the outside rail and start turning the

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.300 
the outside rail and start turning the
board<00:01:38.490> slowly<00:01:39.110> so<00:01:40.110> in<00:01:40.259> that<00:01:40.619> frame<00:01:40.920> there<00:01:41.159> you

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
board slowly so in that frame there you

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.889 
board slowly so in that frame there you
can<00:01:41.460> actually<00:01:41.549> see<00:01:41.790> I've<00:01:41.909> completely<00:01:42.540> shifted

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
can actually see I've completely shifted

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.770 
can actually see I've completely shifted
my<00:01:43.049> weight<00:01:43.079> off<00:01:43.590> either<00:01:44.369> rail<00:01:44.790> and<00:01:45.119> I'm<00:01:45.210> riding

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
my weight off either rail and I'm riding

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.810 
my weight off either rail and I'm riding
on<00:01:45.869> a<00:01:45.899> flat<00:01:46.170> bottom<00:01:46.350> board<00:01:46.710> and<00:01:47.250> that's<00:01:47.369> pretty

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
on a flat bottom board and that's pretty

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.700 
on a flat bottom board and that's pretty
much<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:48.060> transition<00:01:48.750> frame<00:01:49.049> or<00:01:49.259> transition

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
much the transition frame or transition

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.940 
much the transition frame or transition
time<00:01:50.130> of<00:01:50.399> your<00:01:50.520> of<00:01:50.790> your<00:01:50.939> snap<00:01:51.180> and<00:01:51.950> that's

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
time of your of your snap and that's

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.469 
time of your of your snap and that's
kind<00:01:53.310> of<00:01:53.369> where<00:01:53.640> your<00:01:53.759> snaps<00:01:53.970> going<00:01:54.149> to<00:01:54.210> happen

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
kind of where your snaps going to happen

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:55.819 
kind of where your snaps going to happen
you<00:01:54.570> think<00:01:54.600> you're<00:01:54.930> traveling<00:01:55.290> further<00:01:55.500> but

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
you think you're traveling further but

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.300 
you think you're traveling further but
from<00:01:56.820> there<00:01:57.000> it's<00:01:57.180> just<00:01:57.240> a<00:01:57.420> pivot<00:01:57.750> and<00:01:57.899> I<00:01:58.649> like

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
from there it's just a pivot and I like

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.310 
from there it's just a pivot and I like
to<00:01:59.399> call<00:01:59.520> them<00:01:59.610> hooks<00:01:59.880> or<00:02:00.149> gaps<00:02:00.600> so<00:02:01.079> that's

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
to call them hooks or gaps so that's

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.260 
to call them hooks or gaps so that's
when<00:02:01.439> you<00:02:01.500> just<00:02:01.680> bury<00:02:01.979> that<00:02:02.250> that<00:02:02.850> what<00:02:03.060> was

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
when you just bury that that what was

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.420 
when you just bury that that what was
your<00:02:03.450> outside<00:02:03.780> rail<00:02:04.020> and<00:02:04.290> you<00:02:05.009> can<00:02:05.130> see<00:02:05.280> you

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
your outside rail and you can see you

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:06.800 
your outside rail and you can see you
have<00:02:05.460> hardly<00:02:05.759> traveled<00:02:06.149> any<00:02:06.270> distance<00:02:06.600> there

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
have hardly traveled any distance there

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.749 
have hardly traveled any distance there
and<00:02:07.020> you've<00:02:07.710> already<00:02:07.860> shifted<00:02:08.489> all<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:08.700> way

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
and you've already shifted all the way

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.100 
and you've already shifted all the way
if<00:02:08.910> you<00:02:09.000> can<00:02:09.149> see<00:02:09.300> the<00:02:09.390> waters<00:02:09.690> building<00:02:10.020> up

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
if you can see the waters building up

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:10.779 
if you can see the waters building up
underneath

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
underneath

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:12.910 
underneath
underneath<00:02:11.450> a<00:02:11.689> rail<00:02:11.900> and<00:02:12.230> you<00:02:12.349> you're<00:02:12.709> just

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
underneath a rail and you you're just

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.690 
underneath a rail and you you're just
pushing<00:02:13.310> it<00:02:13.580> out<00:02:13.780> burying<00:02:14.780> the<00:02:14.900> rail<00:02:15.079> and<00:02:15.700> I

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
pushing it out burying the rail and I

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.880 
pushing it out burying the rail and I
think<00:02:17.569> my<00:02:17.780> technique<00:02:18.110> here<00:02:18.290> is<00:02:18.319> actually<00:02:18.620> kind

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
think my technique here is actually kind

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.729 
think my technique here is actually kind
of<00:02:18.920> bad<00:02:19.099> when<00:02:19.400> I'm<00:02:19.549> looking<00:02:19.879> at<00:02:20.269> my<00:02:20.590> where<00:02:21.590> I'm

00:02:21.729 --> 00:02:21.739 
of bad when I'm looking at my where I'm

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:26.559 
of bad when I'm looking at my where I'm
turning<00:02:22.159> which<00:02:22.760> is<00:02:24.939> that's<00:02:25.939> a<00:02:26.030> bad<00:02:26.180> habit<00:02:26.209> I

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:26.569 
turning which is that's a bad habit I

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:27.030 
turning which is that's a bad habit I
guess

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
guess

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.830 
guess
but<00:02:28.040> luckily<00:02:28.250> here<00:02:28.940> you<00:02:29.000> can<00:02:29.120> see<00:02:29.269> I'm<00:02:29.599> turning

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
but luckily here you can see I'm turning

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.119 
but luckily here you can see I'm turning
my<00:02:29.900> head<00:02:30.049> to<00:02:30.110> see<00:02:30.409> where<00:02:30.560> I'm<00:02:30.620> going<00:02:30.890> that's

00:02:31.119 --> 00:02:31.129 
my head to see where I'm going that's

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:32.380 
my head to see where I'm going that's
what<00:02:31.250> you<00:02:31.370> should<00:02:31.579> be<00:02:31.670> doing<00:02:31.909> during<00:02:32.030> a<00:02:32.180> snap

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
what you should be doing during a snap

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:33.819 
what you should be doing during a snap
you<00:02:32.810> shouldn't<00:02:33.079> be<00:02:33.170> looking<00:02:33.260> at<00:02:33.470> your<00:02:33.590> spray

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:33.829 
you shouldn't be looking at your spray

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:35.020 
you shouldn't be looking at your spray
you<00:02:34.040> should<00:02:34.220> be<00:02:34.310> looking<00:02:34.549> at<00:02:34.640> where<00:02:34.849> you're

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
you should be looking at where you're

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.080 
you should be looking at where you're
going<00:02:35.420> because<00:02:36.049> that's<00:02:36.920> gonna<00:02:37.159> guide<00:02:37.459> your

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
going because that's gonna guide your

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.619 
going because that's gonna guide your
entire<00:02:38.390> turn<00:02:38.920> so<00:02:39.920> I've<00:02:40.640> pretty<00:02:40.849> much<00:02:40.970> finished

00:02:41.619 --> 00:02:41.629 
entire turn so I've pretty much finished

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:44.050 
entire turn so I've pretty much finished
my<00:02:41.750> snap<00:02:42.049> in<00:02:42.290> those<00:02:42.709> three<00:02:43.190> four<00:02:43.489> frames<00:02:43.790> there

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
my snap in those three four frames there

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.750 
my snap in those three four frames there
I'm<00:02:44.590> kind<00:02:45.590> of<00:02:45.769> facing<00:02:46.129> back<00:02:46.280> towards<00:02:46.310> the<00:02:46.640> wave

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
I'm kind of facing back towards the wave

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.300 
I'm kind of facing back towards the wave
a<00:02:46.879> little<00:02:47.030> bit<00:02:47.269> but<00:02:47.989> I<00:02:48.680> think<00:02:48.799> that's<00:02:49.099> cuz<00:02:49.250> I

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
a little bit but I think that's cuz I

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:50.710 
a little bit but I think that's cuz I
started<00:02:49.579> sliding<00:02:49.909> a<00:02:50.150> little<00:02:50.180> here<00:02:50.569> you<00:02:50.599> can

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
started sliding a little here you can

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.479 
started sliding a little here you can
see<00:02:50.870> here<00:02:51.079> I've<00:02:51.349> actually<00:02:51.470> slid<00:02:51.859> on<00:02:51.980> just<00:02:52.340> a

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
see here I've actually slid on just a

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:54.580 
see here I've actually slid on just a
tad<00:02:52.819> which<00:02:53.480> is<00:02:53.599> kind<00:02:53.780> of<00:02:53.840> forced<00:02:54.170> me<00:02:54.290> to<00:02:54.319> come

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
tad which is kind of forced me to come

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.490 
tad which is kind of forced me to come
to<00:02:55.010> come<00:02:55.220> sliding<00:02:55.879> into<00:02:55.970> the<00:02:56.060> flats<00:02:56.500> facing

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
to come sliding into the flats facing

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.640 
to come sliding into the flats facing
back<00:02:58.129> at<00:02:58.280> the<00:02:58.400> wave<00:02:58.549> and<00:02:59.170> maybe<00:03:00.170> get<00:03:00.349> away<00:03:00.590> from

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
back at the wave and maybe get away from

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.170 
back at the wave and maybe get away from
from<00:03:01.250> that<00:03:01.370> heavy<00:03:01.519> section<00:03:01.849> that's<00:03:01.940> about<00:03:02.150> a

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
from that heavy section that's about a

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.629 
from that heavy section that's about a
break<00:03:02.450> right<00:03:02.690> behind<00:03:02.959> me<00:03:03.340> so<00:03:04.340> it<00:03:04.400> doesn't

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:04.639 
break right behind me so it doesn't

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:06.580 
break right behind me so it doesn't
break<00:03:04.700> on<00:03:04.909> top<00:03:05.090> of<00:03:05.209> me<00:03:05.299> so<00:03:05.840> I<00:03:05.870> guess<00:03:06.379> that<00:03:06.560> that

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
break on top of me so I guess that that

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.080 
break on top of me so I guess that that
really<00:03:06.889> worked<00:03:07.099> out<00:03:07.280> in<00:03:07.400> my<00:03:07.519> favor

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
really worked out in my favor

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.750 
really worked out in my favor
the<00:03:08.930> waves<00:03:09.170> were<00:03:09.290> heavier<00:03:09.590> and<00:03:10.099> ran<00:03:10.489> in<00:03:10.609> kind

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
the waves were heavier and ran in kind

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.520 
the waves were heavier and ran in kind
of<00:03:10.849> fast<00:03:11.000> this<00:03:11.150> day<00:03:11.329> so<00:03:11.389> that's<00:03:11.659> maybe<00:03:12.049> a<00:03:12.200> good

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
of fast this day so that's maybe a good

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.020 
of fast this day so that's maybe a good
strategy<00:03:12.920> to<00:03:13.220> approach<00:03:13.489> when<00:03:13.670> it's<00:03:13.790> heavier

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
strategy to approach when it's heavier

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:15.729 
strategy to approach when it's heavier
just<00:03:14.209> come<00:03:14.780> sliding<00:03:15.169> down<00:03:15.260> into<00:03:15.440> the<00:03:15.530> flats

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
just come sliding down into the flats

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:17.379 
just come sliding down into the flats
after<00:03:16.069> your<00:03:16.190> turn<00:03:16.430> you<00:03:17.060> can<00:03:17.090> see<00:03:17.299> I've

00:03:17.379 --> 00:03:17.389 
after your turn you can see I've

00:03:17.389 --> 00:03:19.780 
after your turn you can see I've
actually<00:03:17.510> put<00:03:17.780> my<00:03:18.010> my<00:03:19.010> right<00:03:19.250> hand<00:03:19.549> in<00:03:19.699> the

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
actually put my my right hand in the

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.990 
actually put my my right hand in the
water<00:03:20.000> as<00:03:20.269> I<00:03:20.690> finish<00:03:21.079> the<00:03:21.199> snap<00:03:21.410> which<00:03:22.000> just

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
water as I finish the snap which just

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000 
water as I finish the snap which just
kept<00:03:23.120> my<00:03:23.239> balance<00:03:23.599> really<00:03:23.870> and<00:03:24.139> stopped<00:03:24.889> me

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
kept my balance really and stopped me

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:26.979 
kept my balance really and stopped me
from<00:03:25.190> spinning<00:03:25.430> out<00:03:25.639> of<00:03:25.699> control<00:03:25.840> it's<00:03:26.840> just

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:26.989 
from spinning out of control it's just

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:29.080 
from spinning out of control it's just
to<00:03:27.079> control<00:03:27.379> that<00:03:27.650> slide<00:03:28.010> into<00:03:28.370> the<00:03:28.519> flats<00:03:28.819> and

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
to control that slide into the flats and

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.599 
to control that slide into the flats and
that<00:03:29.449> I<00:03:29.480> can<00:03:29.720> recover<00:03:30.500> here<00:03:31.370> I'm<00:03:31.459> going

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:31.609 
that I can recover here I'm going

00:03:31.609 --> 00:03:33.250 
that I can recover here I'm going
straight<00:03:31.849> already<00:03:32.150> so<00:03:32.449> just<00:03:32.480> pretty<00:03:32.870> much<00:03:33.109> it

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
straight already so just pretty much it

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.800 
straight already so just pretty much it
was<00:03:33.379> just<00:03:33.530> a<00:03:33.620> momentary<00:03:34.310> berry<00:03:35.299> of<00:03:35.510> the<00:03:35.599> hand

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
was just a momentary berry of the hand

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:36.939 
was just a momentary berry of the hand
just<00:03:35.959> to<00:03:36.109> stop<00:03:36.290> me<00:03:36.379> from<00:03:36.470> sliding<00:03:36.829> out<00:03:36.919> of

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:36.949 
just to stop me from sliding out of

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:39.159 
just to stop me from sliding out of
control<00:03:37.040> and<00:03:37.579> just<00:03:37.639> get<00:03:37.879> back<00:03:38.060> on<00:03:38.269> track<00:03:38.419> I've

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:39.169 
control and just get back on track I've

00:03:39.169 --> 00:03:40.930 
control and just get back on track I've
just<00:03:39.379> changed<00:03:39.560> my<00:03:39.799> view<00:03:40.129> which<00:03:40.489> means<00:03:40.669> I'm

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940 
just changed my view which means I'm

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.089 
just changed my view which means I'm
looking<00:03:41.239> down<00:03:41.540> the<00:03:41.690> line<00:03:41.720> again<00:03:42.230> I<00:03:42.410> finished

00:03:43.089 --> 00:03:43.099 
looking down the line again I finished

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:45.759 
looking down the line again I finished
my<00:03:43.190> snap<00:03:43.430> I've<00:03:43.639> recovered<00:03:43.910> I<00:03:44.239> know<00:03:44.810> I'm<00:03:45.349> in<00:03:45.590> the

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:45.769 
my snap I've recovered I know I'm in the

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:47.409 
my snap I've recovered I know I'm in the
cure<00:03:46.040> I'm<00:03:46.250> in<00:03:46.340> the<00:03:46.430> flats<00:03:46.699> I'm<00:03:46.879> away<00:03:47.090> from<00:03:47.329> the

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:47.419 
cure I'm in the flats I'm away from the

00:03:47.419 --> 00:03:49.750 
cure I'm in the flats I'm away from the
powerful<00:03:47.690> section<00:03:48.230> of<00:03:48.319> the<00:03:48.379> wave<00:03:48.560> and<00:03:48.769> I'm

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
powerful section of the wave and I'm

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.619 
powerful section of the wave and I'm
looking<00:03:50.060> at<00:03:50.180> my<00:03:50.209> next<00:03:50.510> approach<00:03:51.230> so<00:03:52.359> nice<00:03:53.359> low

00:03:53.619 --> 00:03:53.629 
looking at my next approach so nice low

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:55.000 
looking at my next approach so nice low
center<00:03:53.900> of<00:03:53.959> gravity<00:03:54.049> in<00:03:54.349> that<00:03:54.470> next<00:03:54.650> frame<00:03:54.859> you

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010 
center of gravity in that next frame you

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:56.259 
center of gravity in that next frame you
can<00:03:55.099> see<00:03:55.220> putting<00:03:55.489> my<00:03:55.609> hand<00:03:55.849> on<00:03:55.970> the<00:03:56.030> front<00:03:56.120> of

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:56.269 
can see putting my hand on the front of

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:57.539 
can see putting my hand on the front of
my<00:03:56.299> board<00:03:56.569> maybe<00:03:56.750> just<00:03:56.959> as<00:03:57.019> a<00:03:57.079> bit<00:03:57.199> of<00:03:57.230> control

00:03:57.539 --> 00:03:57.549 
my board maybe just as a bit of control

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:01.089 
my board maybe just as a bit of control
maybe<00:03:58.549> just<00:03:58.730> a<00:03:58.819> habit<00:03:58.970> as<00:03:59.180> well<00:03:59.560> I'm<00:04:00.560> just<00:04:00.829> out

00:04:01.089 --> 00:04:01.099 
maybe just a habit as well I'm just out

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:02.439 
maybe just a habit as well I'm just out
running<00:04:01.489> the<00:04:01.519> phone<00:04:01.730> pretty<00:04:01.970> much<00:04:02.060> just<00:04:02.359> to

00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:02.449 
running the phone pretty much just to

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:05.140 
running the phone pretty much just to
make<00:04:02.599> sure<00:04:02.629> I'm<00:04:02.900> in<00:04:02.959> the<00:04:03.739> clear

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 
make sure I'm in the clear

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.610 
make sure I'm in the clear
okay<00:04:06.150> I<00:04:06.360> can<00:04:06.720> ran<00:04:06.900> through<00:04:07.050> that<00:04:07.080> like<00:04:07.350> a<00:04:07.380> real

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
okay I can ran through that like a real

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.710 
okay I can ran through that like a real
quick<00:04:07.830> run-through<00:04:08.010> yeah<00:04:08.520> just<00:04:08.880> then<00:04:09.030> okay

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
quick run-through yeah just then okay

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.730 
quick run-through yeah just then okay
just<00:04:09.870> just<00:04:10.140> a<00:04:10.230> recap<00:04:10.560> so<00:04:11.930> you<00:04:12.930> know<00:04:13.020> you<00:04:13.110> don't

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:13.740 
just just a recap so you know you don't

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:15.350 
just just a recap so you know you don't
always<00:04:13.860> get<00:04:14.100> to<00:04:14.160> get<00:04:14.700> to<00:04:14.790> come<00:04:14.940> flying<00:04:15.150> out<00:04:15.270> of

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:15.360 
always get to get to come flying out of

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.330 
always get to get to come flying out of
a<00:04:15.420> barrel<00:04:15.600> before<00:04:15.960> you<00:04:16.080> do<00:04:16.170> a<00:04:16.200> turn<00:04:16.500> but<00:04:17.190> in

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
a barrel before you do a turn but in

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.240 
a barrel before you do a turn but in
this<00:04:17.430> case<00:04:17.610> I<00:04:17.790> was<00:04:17.880> lucky<00:04:18.030> in<00:04:18.269> Mexico<00:04:18.660> and

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.250 
this case I was lucky in Mexico and

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:21.890 
this case I was lucky in Mexico and
Porto<00:04:20.250> there's<00:04:20.430> no<00:04:20.549> shortage<00:04:20.850> of<00:04:20.940> barrels<00:04:21.299> so

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
Porto there's no shortage of barrels so

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.930 
Porto there's no shortage of barrels so
when<00:04:22.019> you're<00:04:22.110> coming<00:04:22.230> out<00:04:22.410> of<00:04:22.500> the<00:04:22.560> barrel<00:04:22.940> try

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
when you're coming out of the barrel try

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.300 
when you're coming out of the barrel try
an<00:04:24.000> eye<00:04:24.150> out<00:04:24.300> your<00:04:24.450> section<00:04:24.780> and<00:04:25.130> make<00:04:26.130> sure

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
an eye out your section and make sure

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:27.740 
an eye out your section and make sure
it's<00:04:26.490> a<00:04:26.520> nice<00:04:26.640> steep<00:04:26.970> section<00:04:27.360> you<00:04:27.480> don't<00:04:27.510> want

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
it's a nice steep section you don't want

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:31.520 
it's a nice steep section you don't want
to<00:04:27.810> be<00:04:27.900> in<00:04:28.470> the<00:04:28.590> flat<00:04:28.830> open<00:04:29.160> face<00:04:29.930> and<00:04:30.930> make

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530 
to be in the flat open face and make

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:32.780 
to be in the flat open face and make
sure<00:04:31.680> when<00:04:31.830> you're<00:04:31.950> coming<00:04:32.100> out<00:04:32.310> or<00:04:32.580> when

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:32.790 
sure when you're coming out or when

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:33.890 
sure when you're coming out or when
you're<00:04:32.910> approaching<00:04:33.300> your<00:04:33.330> section<00:04:33.660> you<00:04:33.750> come

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
you're approaching your section you come

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.020 
you're approaching your section you come
from<00:04:34.020> the<00:04:34.170> bottom<00:04:34.500> of<00:04:34.560> the<00:04:34.650> wave<00:04:34.800> nice<00:04:35.580> in<00:04:35.940> the

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
from the bottom of the wave nice in the

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:39.110 
from the bottom of the wave nice in the
flat<00:04:36.270> and<00:04:36.620> a<00:04:37.620> nice<00:04:37.980> vertical<00:04:38.310> approach<00:04:38.880> will

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 
flat and a nice vertical approach will

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.540 
flat and a nice vertical approach will
allow<00:04:39.360> you<00:04:39.420> to<00:04:39.570> finish<00:04:39.900> your<00:04:40.020> turn<00:04:40.350> in<00:04:40.590> a<00:04:41.250> in

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:41.550 
allow you to finish your turn in a in

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:43.310 
allow you to finish your turn in a in
the<00:04:41.730> power<00:04:42.000> pocket<00:04:42.330> of<00:04:42.390> the<00:04:42.450> wave<00:04:42.630> which<00:04:42.990> lets

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:43.320 
the power pocket of the wave which lets

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.980 
the power pocket of the wave which lets
you<00:04:43.500> carry<00:04:43.800> on<00:04:44.010> riding<00:04:44.400> whereas<00:04:45.090> if<00:04:45.390> you<00:04:45.420> on

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:45.990 
you carry on riding whereas if you on

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:47.210 
you carry on riding whereas if you on
the<00:04:46.110> open<00:04:46.410> face<00:04:46.530> you're<00:04:46.770> just<00:04:46.920> going<00:04:47.040> to<00:04:47.070> get

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:47.220 
the open face you're just going to get

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:50.270 
the open face you're just going to get
hit<00:04:47.820> by<00:04:47.850> the<00:04:48.000> water<00:04:48.330> or<00:04:48.540> just<00:04:48.690> lose<00:04:49.080> control<00:04:49.280> so

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:50.280 
hit by the water or just lose control so

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:54.770 
hit by the water or just lose control so
shifting<00:04:51.180> weight<00:04:51.300> rail<00:04:52.260> to<00:04:52.470> rail<00:04:52.500> and<00:04:53.780> don't

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:54.780 
shifting weight rail to rail and don't

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:56.120 
shifting weight rail to rail and don't
do<00:04:54.930> what<00:04:54.960> I<00:04:55.080> do<00:04:55.200> don't<00:04:55.500> look<00:04:55.650> at<00:04:55.770> your<00:04:55.890> spray

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:56.130 
do what I do don't look at your spray

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:57.560 
do what I do don't look at your spray
look<00:04:56.460> at<00:04:56.550> what<00:04:56.670> you're<00:04:56.760> going<00:04:56.970> there<00:04:57.330> you<00:04:57.450> go

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:57.570 
look at what you're going there you go

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:58.130 
look at what you're going there you go
that's<00:04:57.750> better

00:04:58.130 --> 00:04:58.140 
that's better

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:00.650 
that's better
and<00:04:58.290> then<00:04:58.980> if<00:04:59.700> you<00:04:59.910> want<00:05:00.210> to<00:05:00.300> slide<00:05:00.480> and

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:00.660 
and then if you want to slide and
