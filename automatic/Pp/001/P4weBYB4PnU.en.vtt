00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:03.140
 ah 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.420
 ah 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.979
 ah 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:35.510
 this occasion was in Medellin we traveled 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.950
 until there to see how the new one was born 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:41.210
 member of the network the so-called poster 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:45.040
 so the first thing we did was 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:48.170
 put on our helmet and a pair of glasses 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:50.540
 we were about to go through his house one of 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:53.290
 the largest industrial plants of 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:55.790
 Latin America that invested in 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:57.240
 22.5 million euros for this 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:00.030
 draft 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.030
 It turns out that in 2010 this new 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:06.119
 Vehicle revolutionized the European market 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:09.800
 it was a sv that is to say those cars 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:12.360
 taller than not necessarily 4x4 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.910
 They decided that it would be best to produce it 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.650
 in Colombia they got down to work 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:20.260
 and they succeeded 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.810
 the doctor is a truck completely 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:25.900
 reindeer of reindeer total design and 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:28.360
 then that's the success because right now 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:31.209
 we have a range of vans we have 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:35.470
 the koleos above the segment of 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:38.379
 vans of your hub and that's the entrance 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:40.659
 of range is not to say that as is a car 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:44.349
 cheap is a car of poor quality not 

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:49.780
 It has all the quality of a 4x4 odierno 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:51.350
 but it's a very affordable price and it says 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.990
 do not 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:56.710
 in the plant not only robbery are you in the 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:59.720
 I work about 600 people 

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:02.780
 organized are there some van 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:06.350
 releasing other parts by installing the 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:08.300
 motors the plants when it is the turn 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:11.180
 of the painting we are surprised to see the 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:12.940
 process the cars are like cookies 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.920
 submerging in a glass of milk 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:20.030
 seriously miren 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:22.280
 and when they come out they go through this oven and 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:24.770
 then by the eye of women who look and 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:28.000
 they fix the faults and obviously the 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:30.730
 We who do quality control 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:34.120
 then the internal assembly will come up 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:35.800
 can be almost cute after two years 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.050
 of intense work we finally went 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:41.500
 witnesses that night of the launch 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:43.630
 official of the new base 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:46.300
 now you will ask yourself here 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:48.100
 has the one that makes her so special and 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:51.520
 we will say that on the outside its design is 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:55.120
 robust and captivating us we look at their 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:57.850
 16- inch wheels on your grill and 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.540
 in their halogens all in full 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:02.239
 harmony 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:05.030
 but it was when we got the keys and 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:09.319
 we entered that we checked some little things 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:13.350
 more like how spacious it is and the sound 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:16.220
 of your radio for example pay attention 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:16.220
 for so much 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:21.530
 and it's also a radio are arkamys brands 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:23.360
 is a brand that is worldwide 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:27.020
 taking a lot of success because it's like having 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:29.330
 a trust in your SUV why 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:32.700
 because it has a 3d system a system 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:36.860
 digital in 3-d in 3-d 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:39.810
 there is version 4 for 2 and 4x4 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:42.920
 when we handle it we realize 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:45.420
 its softness and its soundproofing 

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:47.400
 because if you go that volume does not 

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:50.010
 you will hear nothing happens either 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:52.260
 Believe us that because the version 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:55.230
 Latin American was designed to avoid 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:57.420
 precisely the annoying noises of 

00:04:55.230 --> 00:05:00.120
 our roads 

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:03.390
 and so the road suddenly starts to 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:06.630
 get harder it 's time to try your 

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:09.390
 4x4 system that by the way is 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:12.930
 smart is not anyone is called the 

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:15.120
 e-mail with three buttons to use the 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:18.390
 self recognizes what it is that you need in 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:20.730
 this moment to stabilize after the 

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:23.820
 Free 4x4 that delivers the torque 

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:27.240
 between the front train and the train 

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:29.010
 rear 50-50 which is the most important 

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:31.020
 for a client in this sense and that is 

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:32.910
 you will have much greater security in 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:34.650
 low grip conditions ie 

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:36.990
 if you go for example from quito to 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:38.940
 guayaquil on a highway that suddenly 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:41.190
 go to some farm that you do not have 

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:43.110
 a lot of soil adhesion that has 

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:45.810
 common grounds that we test today with 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:48.180
 mud stones with mud for this one goes 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:50.250
 to realize that your vehicle adheres 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:52.410
 much more to the ground and then this makes 

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:55.639
 do not lose stability even in curves 

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:57.949
 nor in driving the car 

00:05:55.639 --> 00:06:00.740
 overcome the stones the mud and the 

00:05:57.949 --> 00:06:03.199
 land we approach until guatapÃ© a 

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:06.439
 tourist site and very nice for that 

00:06:03.199 --> 00:06:09.590
 way we could try more speed and 

00:06:06.439 --> 00:06:11.930
 we want to have it at all costs not only 

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:15.039
 for all the plus it brings but because 

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:17.090
 its price is the most beautiful of the package 

00:06:15.039 --> 00:06:19.520
 well I'm going to make a small 

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:22.520
 anteroom and it's going to be in the range 

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:25.159
 of automobiles that already the SUVs 

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:27.860
 they are in a much higher range and therefore 

00:06:25.159 --> 00:06:32.090
 nothing the revolution between 20 thousand and 28 thousand 

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:35.000
 dollars we only have to wait gentlemen 

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:37.069
 so it's April and we can all have 

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:41.680
 finally access to what always 

00:06:37.069 --> 00:06:41.680
 we wanted a true 4x4 

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:54.430
 is called 

00:06:55.490 --> 00:07:01.960
 the new renault duster from 19 thousand 900 

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:01.960
 Dollars
