I think that this is expensive i think

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.080 
I think that this is expensive i think
it's<00:03:34.590> around<00:03:34.680> thirty<00:03:35.100> dollars<00:03:35.459> so<00:03:35.609> i<00:03:35.640> probably

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
it's around thirty dollars so i probably

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.590 
it's around thirty dollars so i probably
wouldn't<00:03:36.630> buy<00:03:37.019> it<00:03:37.049> again<00:03:37.640> because<00:03:38.640> i<00:03:39.120> prefer

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:30.660 
it's like great or amazing or anything

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.750 
it's like great or amazing or anything
like<00:04:30.690> that<00:04:30.870> it<00:04:31.860> pretty<00:04:32.040> much<00:04:32.130> does<00:04:32.490> what<00:04:32.550> i

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:32.760 
like that it pretty much does what i

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:36.020 
like that it pretty much does what i
expected<00:04:33.330> to<00:04:33.389> do<00:04:33.660> but<00:04:34.370> you<00:04:35.370> know<00:04:35.490> me<00:04:35.729> like<00:04:35.970> I

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
expected to do but you know me like I

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:39.740 
expected to do but you know me like I
rely<00:04:36.479> more<00:04:37.080> on<00:04:37.139> moisture<00:04:38.040> and<00:04:38.250> pH<00:04:38.580> so<00:04:39.180> this

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:39.750 
rely more on moisture and pH so this

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.110 
rely more on moisture and pH so this
product<00:04:40.229> might<00:04:40.410> have<00:04:40.590> a<00:04:40.620> higher<00:04:41.220> pH<00:04:41.639> than<00:04:41.940> what

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.120 
product might have a higher pH than what

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.360 
product might have a higher pH than what
I<00:04:42.360> usually<00:04:42.660> like<00:04:43.320> using<00:04:43.650> which<00:04:44.010> is<00:04:44.160> why<00:04:44.310> it

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:00.050 
twenty for it but I basically went in
there<00:05:58.020> and<00:05:58.199> I<00:05:58.320> bought<00:05:58.590> I<00:05:58.979> bought<00:05:59.340> like<00:05:59.759> 10

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:00.060

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:03.600 
bottles like I bought a lot so I think

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:06.140 
bottles like I bought a lot so I think
these<00:06:03.720> are<00:06:03.780> all<00:06:04.020> new<00:06:04.050> sits<00:06:04.650> also<00:06:05.250> they<00:06:05.940> have

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:06.150

the<00:06:06.389> five<00:06:06.780> essential<00:06:07.289> vitamins<00:06:07.710> in<00:06:07.860> them

00:06:07.879 --> 00:06:07.889 
the five essential vitamins in them

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:13.279 
the five essential vitamins in them
vitamin<00:06:08.520> e<00:06:08.759> HC<00:06:09.740> b5<00:06:10.740> and<00:06:11.100> b3<00:06:11.940> so<00:06:12.419> this<00:06:12.780> is<00:06:12.810> one<00:06:13.259> of

00:06:13.279 --> 00:06:13.289 
vitamin e HC b5 and b3 so this is one of

naturals<00:06:55.490> I<00:06:55.700> already<00:06:55.970> checked<00:06:56.330> and<00:06:56.690> i<00:06:57.530> think

00:06:58.090 --> 00:06:58.100 
naturals I already checked and i think

00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:59.380 
naturals I already checked and i think
most<00:06:58.280> of<00:06:58.430> those<00:06:58.520> products<00:06:58.940> are<00:06:59.030> gluten<00:06:59.360> free

00:06:59.380 --> 00:06:59.390 
most of those products are gluten free

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:02.800 
most of those products are gluten free
so<00:06:59.960> that's<00:07:00.680> on<00:07:00.890> my<00:07:01.040> to-do<00:07:01.370> list<00:07:01.400> I<00:07:01.970> know<00:07:02.270> as<00:07:02.570> I

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:02.810 
so that's on my to-do list I know as I

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:05.170 
so that's on my to-do list I know as I
am<00:07:02.960> has<00:07:03.260> some<00:07:03.530> new<00:07:03.740> products<00:07:04.220> out<00:07:04.430> that<00:07:05.030> I've
