00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
that time not really because I'm not a

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:48.040 
that time not really because I'm not a

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.050 
power lifter and I don't really see the

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:49.930 
power lifter and I don't really see the
point<00:02:48.140> of<00:02:48.500> doing<00:02:49.040> it<00:02:49.280> but<00:02:49.310> on<00:02:49.550> this<00:02:49.760> particular

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
point of doing it but on this particular

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.210 
point of doing it but on this particular
work<00:02:50.420> out<00:02:50.570> it's<00:02:50.780> something<00:02:51.170> that<00:02:51.320> I<00:02:51.530> have<00:02:52.130> been

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
work out it's something that I have been

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.280 
work out it's something that I have been
wondering<00:02:52.459> so<00:02:52.700> I<00:02:52.760> wanted<00:02:53.030> to<00:02:53.150> go<00:02:53.390> for<00:02:54.140> it<00:02:54.260> I

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
wondering so I wanted to go for it I

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.050 
wondering so I wanted to go for it I
wanted<00:02:54.560> to<00:02:54.650> see<00:02:54.800> what<00:02:54.920> my<00:02:55.070> one<00:02:55.340> rep<00:02:55.550> max<00:02:55.580> was

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
wanted to see what my one rep max was

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.090 
wanted to see what my one rep max was
because<00:02:56.360> I<00:02:56.570> knew<00:02:57.080> I<00:02:57.110> could<00:02:57.440> get<00:02:57.620> up<00:02:57.830> there<00:02:57.890> a

because I knew I could get up there a

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.979 
because I knew I could get up there a
little<00:02:58.250> bit<00:02:58.400> more<00:02:58.550> and<00:02:58.610> you<00:02:58.730> guys<00:02:58.820> can<00:02:59.090> see<00:02:59.120> the

00:02:59.979 --> 00:02:59.989 
little bit more and you guys can see the

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:02.580 
little bit more and you guys can see the
rookie<00:03:00.350> mistake<00:03:00.739> that<00:03:00.950> I<00:03:01.040> made<00:03:01.070> by<00:03:01.970> not

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
rookie mistake that I made by not

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.199 
rookie mistake that I made by not
jumping<00:03:03.590> in<00:03:03.680> higher<00:03:03.860> increments<00:03:04.459> I<00:03:04.519> did<00:03:04.670> 5<00:03:04.850> 15

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
jumping in higher increments I did 5 15

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:07.900 
jumping in higher increments I did 5 15
which<00:03:05.420> was<00:03:05.570> a<00:03:05.600> 15<00:03:05.989> pound<00:03:06.019> PR<00:03:06.470> and<00:03:06.739> hindsight<00:03:07.670> is
