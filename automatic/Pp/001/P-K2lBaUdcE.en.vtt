cereals<00:00:52.440> baking<00:00:53.430> salad<00:00:54.360> you<00:00:54.480> can<00:00:54.629> put<00:00:54.780> them

cereals baking salad you can put them
just<00:00:54.989> about<00:00:55.199> anywhere<00:00:55.670> there<00:00:56.670> are<00:00:56.789> a<00:00:56.820> few

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
just about anywhere there are a few

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.840 
just about anywhere there are a few
differences<00:00:57.329> though<00:00:57.680> so<00:00:58.680> flax<00:00:59.460> seeds

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
differences though so flax seeds

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.910 
differences though so flax seeds
actually<00:01:00.420> need<00:01:00.600> to<00:01:00.719> be<00:01:00.840> ground<00:01:01.109> I<00:01:01.500> actually

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
actually need to be ground I actually

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.889 
actually need to be ground I actually
buy<00:01:02.250> mine<00:01:02.489> ground<00:01:02.820> I<00:01:03.180> don't<00:01:03.480> know<00:01:03.660> if<00:01:03.719> you<00:01:03.780> guys

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
buy mine ground I don't know if you guys

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.899 
buy mine ground I don't know if you guys
can<00:01:04.170> see<00:01:04.409> this<00:01:04.619> there's<00:01:04.979> it's<00:01:05.280> clear<00:01:05.549> here<00:01:05.760> you

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
can see this there's it's clear here you

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.760 
can see this there's it's clear here you
can<00:01:06.030> see<00:01:06.180> these<00:01:06.270> are<00:01:06.450> ground<00:01:06.689> because<00:01:07.650> the

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
can see these are ground because the

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.859 
can see these are ground because the
outer<00:01:07.950> part<00:01:08.280> of<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.460> flax<00:01:08.700> seed<00:01:09.060> is<00:01:09.360> so<00:01:09.600> dense

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
outer part of the flax seed is so dense

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.020 
outer part of the flax seed is so dense
that<00:01:10.020> our<00:01:10.439> star<00:01:10.799> digestive<00:01:11.340> system<00:01:11.640> can't<00:01:11.880> get

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
that our star digestive system can't get

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.300 
that our star digestive system can't get
to<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.240> inside<00:01:12.540> to<00:01:12.720> get<00:01:12.810> the<00:01:12.869> good<00:01:13.080> stuff<00:01:13.310> so

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
to the inside to get the good stuff so

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.660 
to the inside to get the good stuff so
buy<00:01:14.640> them<00:01:14.880> ground<00:01:15.150> or<00:01:15.509> if<00:01:15.720> you<00:01:15.840> buy<00:01:15.990> them<00:01:16.229> whole

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 
buy them ground or if you buy them whole

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.980 
buy them ground or if you buy them whole
describe<00:01:17.670> them<00:01:17.880> in<00:01:18.030> a<00:01:18.090> spice<00:01:18.299> grinder<00:01:18.330> or

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
describe them in a spice grinder or

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.929 
describe them in a spice grinder or
clean<00:01:19.290> coffee<00:01:19.560> maker<00:01:19.830> room<00:01:20.430> so<00:01:20.520> I<00:01:20.580> copy

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
clean coffee maker room so I copy

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.840 
clean coffee maker room so I copy
grinder<00:01:21.619> but<00:01:22.619> I<00:01:22.650> find<00:01:23.009> it's<00:01:23.220> just<00:01:23.369> much<00:01:23.520> easier

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
grinder but I find it's just much easier

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.380 
grinder but I find it's just much easier
to<00:01:24.000> buy<00:01:24.119> them<00:01:24.299> ground<00:01:24.540> and<00:01:26.000> flax<00:01:27.000> seeds<00:01:27.210> have<00:01:27.360> a

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
to buy them ground and flax seeds have a

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.390 
to buy them ground and flax seeds have a
really<00:01:27.659> nutty<00:01:27.900> flavor<00:01:28.290> they're<00:01:28.860> really

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.210 
the good stuff out of them chia seeds a
little<00:01:46.110> different<00:01:46.409> from<00:01:46.500> flax<00:01:46.799> seeds<00:01:47.070> they

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
little different from flax seeds they

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.249 
little different from flax seeds they
actually<00:01:47.610> will<00:01:47.869> gelatinize<00:01:48.869> when<00:01:49.140> they're

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
actually will gelatinize when they're

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.649 
actually will gelatinize when they're
combined<00:01:50.100> with<00:01:50.280> water<00:01:50.490> and<00:01:50.850> form<00:01:51.329> kind<00:01:51.509> of<00:01:51.570> a

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
combined with water and form kind of a

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.249 
combined with water and form kind of a
gel<00:01:51.899> like<00:01:52.110> texture<00:01:52.470> so<00:01:53.460> if<00:01:53.729> you<00:01:53.880> like<00:01:54.149> that

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:54.259 
gel like texture so if you like that

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:56.719 
gel like texture so if you like that
when<00:01:55.259> you<00:01:55.380> put<00:01:55.619> them<00:01:55.770> into<00:01:55.950> a<00:01:56.040> smoothie<00:01:56.549> or

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
when you put them into a smoothie or

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.730 
when you put them into a smoothie or
into<00:01:57.299> a<00:01:57.329> liquid<00:01:57.540> let<00:01:58.229> it<00:01:58.350> sit<00:01:58.590> in<00:01:58.680> the

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
into a liquid let it sit in the

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.740 
into a liquid let it sit in the
refrigerator<00:01:58.860> for<00:01:59.280> 15<00:01:59.820> minutes<00:02:00.060> even<00:02:00.509> up<00:02:00.600> to

four<00:02:00.960> or<00:02:01.020> five<00:02:01.170> hours<00:02:01.500> and<00:02:01.860> it<00:02:02.100> will<00:02:02.189> really

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
four or five hours and it will really

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.249 
four or five hours and it will really
gelatinize<00:02:02.909> you<00:02:03.509> don't<00:02:03.659> have<00:02:03.840> to<00:02:04.049> do<00:02:04.140> that

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
gelatinize you don't have to do that

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:05.870 
gelatinize you don't have to do that
though<00:02:04.469> that's<00:02:04.710> just<00:02:04.799> purely<00:02:05.189> for<00:02:05.430> texture<00:02:05.790> if

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
though that's just purely for texture if

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.660 
though that's just purely for texture if
you<00:02:05.939> like<00:02:06.149> it<00:02:06.680> so<00:02:07.680> the<00:02:08.099> other<00:02:08.250> thing<00:02:08.489> that<00:02:08.520> I

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
to expire it will go on sale but

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.170 
to expire it will go on sale but
sometimes<00:03:05.650> I<00:03:05.800> just<00:03:05.830> have<00:03:06.160> too<00:03:06.490> much<00:03:06.610> of<00:03:06.820> it<00:03:06.940> so

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
best price I do always buy organic

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.570 
best price I do always buy organic
because<00:03:13.180> I<00:03:13.240> think<00:03:13.300> it's<00:03:13.540> important<00:03:14.020> to<00:03:14.650> have

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.580
