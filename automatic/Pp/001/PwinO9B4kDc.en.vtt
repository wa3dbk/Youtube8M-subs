00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
trying keep in theme with the rest of

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:44.649 
trying keep in theme with the rest of
their<00:01:38.600> own<00:01:38.689> app<00:01:38.840> but<00:01:39.549> it's<00:01:40.549> not<00:01:41.000> very<00:01:41.149> good<00:01:43.659> so

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:44.659 
their own app but it's not very good so

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:49.779 
their own app but it's not very good so
yeah<00:01:44.750> that's<00:01:44.899> pretty<00:01:44.929> much<00:01:45.110> it<00:01:45.229> I<00:01:45.530> think<00:01:48.789> with

00:01:49.779 --> 00:01:49.789 
yeah that's pretty much it I think with

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:57.110 
yeah that's pretty much it I think with
this<00:01:49.880> we<00:01:50.060> roll<00:01:50.329> your<00:01:50.600> Android's
