this is over Wi-Fi let's try over 3g oh

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.530 
this is over Wi-Fi let's try over 3g oh
I'm<00:02:32.250> sorry<00:02:32.430> yeah<00:02:32.700> that's<00:02:32.910> over<00:02:33.000> Wi-Fi<00:02:33.209> let's

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
I'm sorry yeah that's over Wi-Fi let's

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.630 
I'm sorry yeah that's over Wi-Fi let's
turn<00:02:33.780> off<00:02:33.870> Wi-Fi<00:02:34.680> there

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.460 

it<00:02:39.640> up<00:02:40.209> slowly<00:02:40.390> locks<00:02:40.569> again<00:02:40.690> I<00:02:41.080> don't<00:02:41.260> have

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
it up slowly locks again I don't have

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:42.720 
it up slowly locks again I don't have
the<00:02:41.530> best<00:02:41.739> reception<00:02:42.190> here<00:02:42.340> I<00:02:42.370> think<00:02:42.640> have

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
the best reception here I think have

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.270 
the best reception here I think have
like<00:02:42.849> one<00:02:43.090> bar<00:02:43.269> maybe<00:02:43.930> two<00:02:44.200> but<00:02:44.950> most<00:02:45.129> of<00:02:45.220> the

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
like one bar maybe two but most of the

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.890 
like one bar maybe two but most of the
time<00:02:45.400> I<00:02:45.489> just<00:02:45.519> have<00:02:45.760> 1<00:02:45.909> 3g<00:02:46.239> bar<00:02:46.420> so<00:02:46.629> we'll<00:02:46.780> see

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
time I just have 1 3g bar so we'll see

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:54.630 
time I just have 1 3g bar so we'll see
how<00:02:47.019> well<00:02:47.140> this<00:02:47.349> does<00:02:48.599> right<00:02:49.599> starting<00:02:53.640> it

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
how well this does right starting it

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:01.699 
how well this does right starting it
says<00:02:55.120> optimizing<00:02:55.720> right<00:02:55.810> now<00:02:57.959> there<00:02:58.959> you<00:02:59.049> go

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:05.330 

tap<00:03:02.709> on<00:03:02.860> the<00:03:02.890> screen<00:03:03.069> and<00:03:03.310> we'll<00:03:03.400> switch<00:03:03.610> it<00:03:03.730> to

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
tap on the screen and we'll switch it to

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:12.470 
tap on the screen and we'll switch it to
110<00:03:06.340> see<00:03:07.209> it's<00:03:07.390> what<00:03:07.510> you<00:03:07.629> up<00:03:07.690> there<00:03:07.900> in<00:03:08.620> 10

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:19.740 

there<00:03:13.480> it<00:03:13.569> is<00:03:16.890> look<00:03:17.890> back<00:03:18.069> over<00:03:18.099> here<00:03:18.569> saws<00:03:19.569> and

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
there it is look back over here saws and

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.080 
there it is look back over here saws and
switch<00:03:19.930> to<00:03:20.430> you<00:03:21.430> can<00:03:21.549> tell<00:03:21.670> it's<00:03:21.790> going<00:03:21.910> at<00:03:22.060> a

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
switch to you can tell it's going at a

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:23.759 
switch to you can tell it's going at a
slower<00:03:22.390> other<00:03:23.079> night<00:03:23.200> you<00:03:23.290> can<00:03:23.410> tell<00:03:23.560> I<00:03:23.590> mean

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:23.769 
slower other night you can tell I mean

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:25.229 
slower other night you can tell I mean
there's<00:03:23.920> a<00:03:24.010> delay<00:03:24.280> on<00:03:24.310> there<00:03:24.579> and<00:03:24.700> the<00:03:24.940> delays

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:25.239 
there's a delay on there and the delays

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:27.509 
there's a delay on there and the delays
even<00:03:25.629> greater<00:03:25.930> with<00:03:26.290> a<00:03:26.319> depending<00:03:27.310> on<00:03:27.400> your

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:27.519 
even greater with a depending on your

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:32.039 
even greater with a depending on your
signal<00:03:29.459> so<00:03:30.459> over<00:03:30.760> Wi-Fi<00:03:30.940> the<00:03:31.269> delay<00:03:31.629> wasn't<00:03:31.959> as

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:32.049 
signal so over Wi-Fi the delay wasn't as

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:33.960 
signal so over Wi-Fi the delay wasn't as
bad<00:03:32.290> because<00:03:32.799> this<00:03:32.920> is<00:03:33.040> 3g<00:03:33.519> it's<00:03:33.670> going<00:03:33.910> to

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
bad because this is 3g it's going to

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.479 
bad because this is 3g it's going to
move<00:03:34.090> further<00:03:35.079> back<00:03:35.200> let's<00:03:35.950> just<00:03:36.160> switch<00:03:36.280> back

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:36.489 
move further back let's just switch back

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:39.210 
move further back let's just switch back
to<00:03:36.519> a<00:03:36.700> Wi-Fi<00:03:37.690> like<00:03:38.079> I<00:03:38.200> said<00:03:38.260> my<00:03:38.470> 3g<00:03:38.799> reception

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
to a Wi-Fi like I said my 3g reception

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.339 
to a Wi-Fi like I said my 3g reception
here<00:03:39.340> is<00:03:39.400> in<00:03:39.489> the<00:03:39.549> greatest<00:03:39.879> cell<00:03:40.090> i<00:03:40.359> don't

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:45.900 
expect much from one bar if you can talk
they're<00:03:43.950> really<00:03:44.950> hard<00:03:45.099> to<00:03:45.160> zoom<00:03:45.340> in<00:03:45.459> but<00:03:45.669> it's

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:22.540 

and<00:04:21.019> the<00:04:21.380> problem<00:04:21.560> we<00:04:21.889> run<00:04:21.920> into<00:04:22.220> is<00:04:22.340> you'll

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:22.550 
and the problem we run into is you'll

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:24.090 
and the problem we run into is you'll
probably<00:04:22.760> see<00:04:22.940> it<00:04:22.970> in<00:04:23.120> a<00:04:23.180> bit<00:04:23.330> just

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:24.100 
probably see it in a bit just

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:27.790 
probably see it in a bit just

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:29.630 
user is viewing your slingbox I thought

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:30.879 
user is viewing your slingbox I thought
it<00:04:29.720> was<00:04:29.810> just<00:04:29.870> because<00:04:30.230> I<00:04:30.560> had<00:04:30.680> a<00:04:30.710> weak

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:30.889 
it was just because I had a weak
