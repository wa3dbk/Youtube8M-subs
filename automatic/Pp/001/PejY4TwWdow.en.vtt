00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:14.520

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:17.550
 they are from the house and the back door 

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:20.279
 where is the hot beat so that 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:23.250
 everyone wants things and makes 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:26.350
 this environment the smoke of a river and I 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.320
 fly here there's no 

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:31.710
 not laugh 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:36.290
 I do not want to look calm 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:40.930
 I know that everything in this life happens 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.930
 and I never change 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.300
 and now this 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:05.399
 Y 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:20.100
 I'm from the street and the back door more 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:23.040
 from the bottom I can deny it I broke the 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.910
 shirt if the world gives me and then it's over 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.910
 charming 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.340
 good 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:43.330
 and I decided joaquin courteous and Juan Carlos 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:46.180
 Acosta enabled the occasion there in 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:49.840

 good night guys 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.430
 juan carlos you made a gypsy what 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.280
 it's called a gypsy 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:12.800
 thank you very much to roberto that there are with the 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:15.230
 crutches was helping us for panama 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.750
 this beautiful choreography and the people 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:20.959
 of flamenco culture the truth is a 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.340
 pleasure we did it with a lot of respect with 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:24.950
 little time but with a lot of respect 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:27.319
 we know that it is very difficult but 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.450
 we really did it with the heart so 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:31.160
 also our regards to for 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.290
 they 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:36.250
 Flamenco is only made with the heart 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:39.130
 of pure heart 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:41.440
 I did not understand your suit mommy I did not understand 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:44.800
 I really did not understand 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:48.340
 and on stage the habit makes the 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:51.730
 monk or may it be in your favor or 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:53.680
 conspire against you if you do not 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.900
 helped 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.719
 again like the previous choreography 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:02.680
 Juan Carlos look at you because 

00:02:58.719 --> 00:03:05.770
 you really saw the character 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.630
 technique attitude 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:09.190
 the same thing happened to me in the choreography 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.200
 previous I think 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:14.070
 jessica you're going to have to tie t 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.600
 with your partner in some way because 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:19.840
 clear but the dancer is very many 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:24.060
 years and it's excellent it turns out to be difficult 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:27.850
 score because the figure is you and 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:30.160
 It's not fair to him either but the truth 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:32.260
 the couple was very lopsided the 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:35.350
 energy differences of technique 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:37.270
 attitude were very big so I'm going to 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:39.280
 try to make an intermediate but 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:40.900
 I want you to know Juan Carlos that you are 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.090
 doing very well and that you're having 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:47.940
 a very big progress then you're 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:47.940
 last galas science thanks and I promise 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:52.400
 do better next time is that 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:53.450
 we have to do it or nothing to thank him 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.400
 also to jessica that gives me the 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:04:00.520
 possibility if you do not feel guilty not 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:00.520
 you feel guilty what is is idiot 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:05.150
 is never going to be equated because he is a 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:07.370
 professional dancer from years ago and she 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:09.380
 It's not a dancer, it's a model and yes, I know 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:12.260
 but good as he gave me an account of 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:13.760
 but as some have been tied 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:17.590
 others not but he saw himself today he looked very 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:19.660
 very uneven special a shame 

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:22.799
 I find it hard guys because here 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.799
 I try to be fair 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:27.840
 the vote of the lady who is 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.840
 thinking is a
