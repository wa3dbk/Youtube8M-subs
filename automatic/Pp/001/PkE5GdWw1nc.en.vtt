right<00:01:38.880> now<00:01:39.000> because<00:01:39.210> we<00:01:39.509> don't<00:01:39.630> want<00:01:39.750> to<00:01:39.780> get

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
right now because we don't want to get

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.870 
right now because we don't want to get
into<00:01:40.079> that<00:01:40.200> so<00:01:41.070> you<00:01:41.130> can<00:01:41.250> see<00:01:41.280> we<00:01:41.549> have<00:01:41.640> you

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
into that so you can see we have you

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.330 
into that so you can see we have you
basically<00:01:42.180> have<00:01:42.479> six<00:01:43.079> main<00:01:43.530> different<00:01:44.220> kind

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
basically have six main different kind

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.950 
basically have six main different kind
of<00:01:44.399> blows<00:01:44.610> by<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:45.119> best<00:01:45.390> blow<00:01:45.630> that<00:01:45.750> you<00:01:45.840> can

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
of blows by the best blow that you can

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.620 
of blows by the best blow that you can
work<00:01:46.170> with<00:01:46.409> inside<00:01:46.920> premiere<00:01:47.369> is<00:01:47.520> wait<00:01:48.420> a<00:01:48.450> sec

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
work with inside premiere is wait a sec

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.980 
work with inside premiere is wait a sec
let<00:01:48.780> me<00:01:48.840> just<00:01:48.990> bring<00:01:49.619> this<00:01:49.710> up<00:01:49.860> here<00:01:50.040> is

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
let me just bring this up here is

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.270 
let me just bring this up here is
Gaussian<00:01:51.990> blur<00:01:52.170> Gaussian<00:01:52.770> blur<00:01:52.799> I<00:01:52.920> think<00:01:53.189> is

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
Gaussian blur Gaussian blur I think is

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.429 
Gaussian blur Gaussian blur I think is
the<00:01:53.490> best<00:01:53.939> law<00:01:54.119> that<00:01:54.299> premier<00:01:54.600> has<00:01:54.750> so<00:01:55.020> take<00:01:55.320> it

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
the best law that premier has so take it

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.590 
the best law that premier has so take it
and<00:01:55.590> drop<00:01:55.680> it<00:01:55.740> onto<00:01:55.920> your<00:01:56.070> video<00:01:56.369> and<00:01:56.600> you

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
and drop it onto your video and you

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.929 
and drop it onto your video and you
would<00:01:57.719> see<00:01:57.960> that<00:01:58.560> if<00:01:58.710> your<00:01:58.860> FX<00:01:59.219> controls<00:01:59.610> panel

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
would see that if your FX controls panel

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.929 
would see that if your FX controls panel
is<00:02:00.210> up<00:02:00.390> then<00:02:00.930> you<00:02:01.469> can<00:02:01.590> see<00:02:01.770> that<00:02:02.070> you<00:02:02.759> have

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
is up then you can see that you have

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.609 
is up then you can see that you have
just<00:02:03.119> added<00:02:03.420> a<00:02:03.509> Gaussian<00:02:03.810> blur<00:02:03.960> so<00:02:04.320> basically

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
just added a Gaussian blur so basically

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.830 
just added a Gaussian blur so basically
what<00:02:05.070> FX<00:02:05.399> control<00:02:05.670> Larry<00:02:05.880> does<00:02:06.090> is<00:02:06.299> this<00:02:06.630> is<00:02:06.810> a

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
what FX control Larry does is this is a

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.830 
what FX control Larry does is this is a
place<00:02:07.140> where<00:02:07.910> where<00:02:08.910> all<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:09.330> FX<00:02:09.629> that<00:02:09.750> you

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
place where where all the FX that you

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.760 
place where where all the FX that you
apply<00:02:10.140> to<00:02:10.200> a<00:02:10.349> clip<00:02:10.679> get<00:02:11.250> stacked<00:02:12.030> in<00:02:12.270> so<00:02:12.810> if<00:02:13.020> you

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
apply to a clip get stacked in so if you

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.500 
apply to a clip get stacked in so if you
by<00:02:14.100> the<00:02:14.160> way<00:02:14.310> you<00:02:14.370> can<00:02:14.670> have<00:02:14.880> more<00:02:14.910> than<00:02:15.240> one

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
by the way you can have more than one

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.410 
by the way you can have more than one
effect<00:02:15.780> in<00:02:16.170> your<00:02:16.230> video<00:02:17.040> right<00:02:17.670> so<00:02:17.970> if<00:02:18.180> I<00:02:18.300> was

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
effect in your video right so if I was

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.660 
effect in your video right so if I was
to<00:02:18.450> type<00:02:18.660> in<00:02:18.780> noise<00:02:18.960> and<00:02:18.990> take<00:02:19.500> this<00:02:19.680> noise

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
to type in noise and take this noise

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.460 
to type in noise and take this noise
effect<00:02:21.180> and<00:02:21.420> drop<00:02:21.570> it<00:02:21.660> onto<00:02:21.750> my<00:02:21.900> video<00:02:22.200> you<00:02:22.350> can

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
effect and drop it onto my video you can

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.040 
effect and drop it onto my video you can
see<00:02:22.650> that<00:02:23.340> we<00:02:23.520> now<00:02:23.760> even<00:02:24.210> have<00:02:24.390> noise<00:02:24.690> applied

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
see that we now even have noise applied

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.850 
see that we now even have noise applied
to<00:02:25.170> it<00:02:25.290> we<00:02:25.800> can<00:02:25.980> go<00:02:26.460> into<00:02:26.700> adding<00:02:27.210> a<00:02:27.270> lot<00:02:27.540> of

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
to it we can go into adding a lot of

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.620 
to it we can go into adding a lot of
effects<00:02:28.860> we<00:02:29.100> can<00:02:29.130> even<00:02:29.370> add<00:02:29.520> in<00:02:29.550> some<00:02:29.910> special

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
effects we can even add in some special

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.690 
effects we can even add in some special
effects<00:02:30.900> like<00:02:30.990> bevel<00:02:31.560> alpha<00:02:31.860> actually<00:02:32.460> not

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
effects like bevel alpha actually not

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.660 
effects like bevel alpha actually not
bevel<00:02:33.630> edges<00:02:33.750> take<00:02:34.710> it<00:02:34.920> and<00:02:35.220> you<00:02:35.340> can<00:02:35.430> see<00:02:35.550> by

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
bevel edges take it and you can see by

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.490 
bevel edges take it and you can see by
default<00:02:35.730> they<00:02:36.210> don't<00:02:36.360> really<00:02:36.540> do<00:02:36.690> anything<00:02:36.930> so

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
default they don't really do anything so

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.110 
default they don't really do anything so
you<00:02:37.530> basically<00:02:37.740> have<00:02:37.980> to<00:02:38.190> come<00:02:38.430> and<00:02:38.580> side<00:02:38.790> FX

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
you basically have to come and side FX

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.820 
you basically have to come and side FX
controls<00:02:39.570> once<00:02:39.840> you<00:02:39.960> have<00:02:40.080> applied<00:02:40.260> your<00:02:40.380> FX

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
controls once you have applied your FX

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.490 
controls once you have applied your FX
to<00:02:41.010> your<00:02:41.160> video<00:02:41.310> and<00:02:41.580> then<00:02:42.360> change<00:02:42.810> some

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
to your video and then change some

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.400 
to your video and then change some
settings<00:02:43.740> over<00:02:44.160> here<00:02:44.190> so<00:02:44.910> if<00:02:45.600> your<00:02:45.870> FX<00:02:46.260> is

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
settings over here so if your FX is

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.320 
settings over here so if your FX is
closed<00:02:46.710> like<00:02:46.890> this<00:02:46.920> then<00:02:47.640> just<00:02:47.910> to<00:02:47.970> open<00:02:48.210> it

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
closed like this then just to open it

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:49.940 
closed like this then just to open it
and<00:02:48.480> change<00:02:49.140> them<00:02:49.290> setting<00:02:49.590> the<00:02:49.680> way<00:02:49.770> you<00:02:49.830> can

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
and change them setting the way you can

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.560 
and change them setting the way you can
see<00:02:50.070> you<00:02:50.520> can<00:02:50.670> create<00:02:50.940> some<00:02:51.150> very<00:02:51.360> different

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
see you can create some very different

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:55.430 
see you can create some very different
effects<00:02:52.080> and<00:02:53.570> you<00:02:54.570> can<00:02:54.630> basically<00:02:55.110> do<00:02:55.410> all

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
effects and you can basically do all

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.650 
effects and you can basically do all
sorts<00:02:55.800> of<00:02:55.830> things<00:02:56.010> like<00:02:56.220> that<00:02:56.250> so<00:02:56.580> FX<00:02:57.270> control

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
sorts of things like that so FX control

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.380 
sorts of things like that so FX control
is<00:02:57.840> I<00:02:58.290> mean<00:02:58.710> FX<00:02:59.130> panel<00:02:59.460> is<00:02:59.580> a<00:02:59.610> panel<00:02:59.730> to<00:03:00.090> be<00:03:00.180> used

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
is I mean FX panel is a panel to be used

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.540 
is I mean FX panel is a panel to be used
after<00:03:01.020> your<00:03:01.140> rough<00:03:01.320> card<00:03:01.560> has<00:03:01.710> been<00:03:01.890> made<00:03:02.070> so

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
after your rough card has been made so

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:04.670 
after your rough card has been made so
say<00:03:02.940> if<00:03:03.030> you<00:03:03.180> are<00:03:03.240> working<00:03:03.540> on<00:03:03.600> a<00:03:03.690> project<00:03:03.900> once

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
say if you are working on a project once

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.470 
say if you are working on a project once
you<00:03:04.860> have<00:03:05.040> done<00:03:05.280> all<00:03:05.520> your<00:03:05.670> rough<00:03:05.940> card<00:03:06.240> okay

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
you have done all your rough card okay

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.870 
you have done all your rough card okay
once<00:03:06.690> you<00:03:06.810> have<00:03:06.950> lined<00:03:07.950> up<00:03:08.250> all<00:03:08.460> your<00:03:08.640> shots

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
once you have lined up all your shots

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.180 
once you have lined up all your shots
together<00:03:09.120> and<00:03:09.570> your<00:03:10.080> timeline<00:03:10.470> work<00:03:10.740> or<00:03:10.980> your

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
together and your timeline work or your

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:12.560 
together and your timeline work or your
source<00:03:11.400> want<00:03:11.610> to<00:03:11.730> work<00:03:11.910> is<00:03:12.030> basically<00:03:12.210> over

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
source want to work is basically over

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:15.020 
source want to work is basically over
only<00:03:13.290> then<00:03:13.530> you<00:03:13.650> should<00:03:13.800> come<00:03:14.010> down<00:03:14.040> to<00:03:14.460> FX<00:03:14.880> and

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
only then you should come down to FX and

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.270 
only then you should come down to FX and
start<00:03:15.720> playing<00:03:15.960> around<00:03:16.080> with<00:03:16.350> um<00:03:16.830> you<00:03:17.160> know

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
start playing around with um you know

making your you know your your videos
look<00:03:20.310> good<00:03:20.840> so<00:03:21.840> anyways<00:03:22.200> that's<00:03:22.410> how<00:03:22.590> you

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
look good so anyways that's how you

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.370 
look good so anyways that's how you
supposed<00:03:22.920> to<00:03:22.950> work<00:03:23.160> with<00:03:23.280> FX<00:03:23.640> and<00:03:24.380> that's

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
supposed to work with FX and that's

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:26.570 
supposed to work with FX and that's
basically<00:03:25.680> it<00:03:25.860> so<00:03:25.890> I'm<00:03:26.070> going<00:03:26.190> to<00:03:26.250> close<00:03:26.400> on

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:26.580 
basically it so I'm going to close on

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:29.060 
basically it so I'm going to close on
the<00:03:26.730> FX<00:03:27.000> panel<00:03:27.330> long<00:03:27.450> now<00:03:27.870> let's<00:03:28.080> focus<00:03:28.260> on<00:03:28.470> FX

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
the FX panel long now let's focus on FX

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.070 
the FX panel long now let's focus on FX
control<00:03:29.370> and<00:03:29.610> in<00:03:30.120> this<00:03:30.270> video<00:03:30.570> I'm<00:03:30.720> also<00:03:30.900> going

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:31.080 
control and in this video I'm also going

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.010 
control and in this video I'm also going
to<00:03:31.140> be<00:03:31.230> showing<00:03:31.410> you<00:03:31.590> how<00:03:31.740> to<00:03:31.770> keyframe<00:03:32.610> or

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:33.020 
to be showing you how to keyframe or

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:35.420 
to be showing you how to keyframe or
actually<00:03:34.020> how<00:03:34.140> to<00:03:34.170> get<00:03:34.410> started<00:03:34.680> with<00:03:34.830> basic

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
actually how to get started with basic

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.910 
actually how to get started with basic
keyframe<00:03:35.820> animation<00:03:36.270> inside<00:03:36.540> premiere<00:03:36.920> so

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
keyframe animation inside premiere so

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.760 
keyframe animation inside premiere so
something<00:03:38.280> great<00:03:39.170> but<00:03:40.170> it<00:03:40.290> is<00:03:40.380> something<00:03:40.590> that

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:40.770 
something great but it is something that

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:42.740 
something great but it is something that
will<00:03:41.130> come<00:03:41.400> in<00:03:41.520> handy<00:03:41.820> if<00:03:42.030> you<00:03:42.450> are<00:03:42.570> working

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
will come in handy if you are working

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.770 
will come in handy if you are working
with<00:03:42.990> a<00:03:43.020> lot<00:03:43.170> of<00:03:43.200> FX<00:03:43.620> anyways<00:03:44.520> so<00:03:45.150> say<00:03:45.480> we<00:03:45.660> were

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
with a lot of FX anyways so say we were

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.120 
with a lot of FX anyways so say we were
to<00:03:45.840> work<00:03:46.110> with<00:03:46.170> a<00:03:46.320> little<00:03:46.530> bit<00:03:46.650> of<00:03:46.740> noise<00:03:46.890> right

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
to work with a little bit of noise right

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:48.949 
to work with a little bit of noise right
actually<00:03:47.370> forget<00:03:48.060> noise<00:03:48.240> we<00:03:48.630> work<00:03:48.840> with

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
actually forget noise we work with

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:51.170 
actually forget noise we work with
Gaussian<00:03:49.170> blur<00:03:49.610> Gaussian<00:03:50.610> blur<00:03:50.640> can<00:03:50.820> be<00:03:51.000> used

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
Gaussian blur Gaussian blur can be used

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.480 
Gaussian blur Gaussian blur can be used
for<00:03:51.450> creating<00:03:51.690> different<00:03:51.990> kind<00:03:52.440> of<00:03:52.530> custom

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:53.490 
for creating different kind of custom

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:57.730 
for creating different kind of custom
transitions<00:03:54.410> say<00:03:55.410> from<00:03:55.880> around<00:03:56.880> from<00:03:57.209> 50

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:57.740 
transitions say from around from 50

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:00.050 
transitions say from around from 50
right<00:03:58.740> you<00:03:59.040> can<00:03:59.160> see<00:03:59.250> we<00:03:59.400> get<00:03:59.520> this<00:03:59.700> blight

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
right you can see we get this blight

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.240 
right you can see we get this blight

this<00:04:34.169> is<00:04:34.229> a<00:04:34.470> keyframe<00:04:34.949> this<00:04:35.280> is<00:04:35.550> basically<00:04:36.030> a

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
this is a keyframe this is basically a

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.999 
this is a keyframe this is basically a
point<00:04:36.720> which<00:04:37.380> holds<00:04:37.919> the<00:04:38.280> information<00:04:38.520> later

00:04:39.999 --> 00:04:40.009 
point which holds the information later

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:43.730 
point which holds the information later
in<00:04:41.009> your<00:04:41.759> video<00:04:42.060> so<00:04:42.389> basically<00:04:42.660> you<00:04:43.560> are

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 
in your video so basically you are

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.520 
in your video so basically you are
trying<00:04:43.919> right<00:04:44.070> now<00:04:44.130> that<00:04:44.759> right<00:04:45.690> now<00:04:45.900> I<00:04:45.930> want<00:04:46.410> a

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530 
trying right now that right now I want a

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:48.890 
trying right now that right now I want a
point<00:04:46.740> which<00:04:47.280> holds<00:04:47.759> on<00:04:47.910> the<00:04:48.180> information<00:04:48.780> of

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:48.900 
point which holds on the information of

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.040 
point which holds on the information of
50%<00:04:49.470> of<00:04:49.770> blindness<00:04:50.190> of<00:04:50.370> my<00:04:51.000> Gaussian<00:04:51.210> blur<00:04:51.509> now

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:52.050 
50% of blindness of my Gaussian blur now

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:54.080 
50% of blindness of my Gaussian blur now
we<00:04:52.110> move<00:04:52.350> ahead<00:04:52.530> in<00:04:52.770> time<00:04:52.949> and<00:04:53.190> we<00:04:53.639> can<00:04:53.759> add<00:04:53.910> in

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:54.090 
we move ahead in time and we can add in

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:56.719 
we move ahead in time and we can add in
one<00:04:54.419> more<00:04:54.449> keyframe<00:04:55.160> by<00:04:56.160> clicking<00:04:56.190> on<00:04:56.639> this

good habit to get into
never<00:05:06.300> ever<00:05:06.539> click<00:05:06.930> on<00:05:07.050> this<00:05:07.199> button<00:05:07.320> for

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:07.620 
never ever click on this button for

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:09.290 
never ever click on this button for
creating<00:05:07.740> a<00:05:08.160> keyframe<00:05:08.580> if<00:05:08.820> you<00:05:08.910> ever<00:05:09.090> want<00:05:09.270> to

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
creating a keyframe if you ever want to

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:12.200 
creating a keyframe if you ever want to
key<00:05:09.509> I<00:05:10.110> mean<00:05:10.560> create<00:05:10.979> a<00:05:11.009> keyframe<00:05:11.400> then<00:05:11.910> all

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:12.210 
key I mean create a keyframe then all

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:13.939 
key I mean create a keyframe then all
you<00:05:12.330> have<00:05:12.449> to<00:05:12.539> do<00:05:12.660> is<00:05:12.840> straight<00:05:13.440> out<00:05:13.470> change

00:05:13.939 --> 00:05:13.949 
you have to do is straight out change

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:16.159 
you have to do is straight out change
the<00:05:14.099> number<00:05:14.400> over<00:05:14.490> here<00:05:14.580> and<00:05:14.880> once<00:05:15.690> you<00:05:15.810> create

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:16.169 
the number over here and once you create

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:18.050 
the number over here and once you create
any<00:05:16.500> kind<00:05:16.590> of<00:05:16.710> changes<00:05:17.130> in<00:05:17.250> the<00:05:17.310> number<00:05:17.610> then

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:18.060 
any kind of changes in the number then

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:19.550 
any kind of changes in the number then
you<00:05:18.120> would<00:05:18.270> see<00:05:18.449> that<00:05:18.660> you<00:05:18.720> can<00:05:18.870> automatically

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 
you would see that you can automatically

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.070 
you would see that you can automatically
get<00:05:19.919> a<00:05:19.979> keyframe<00:05:20.340> and<00:05:20.610> now<00:05:21.240> we<00:05:21.300> have<00:05:21.570> created<00:05:21.780> a

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 
get a keyframe and now we have created a

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.350 
get a keyframe and now we have created a
very<00:05:22.229> basic<00:05:22.530> transition<00:05:23.160> so<00:05:23.849> from<00:05:24.060> blurry

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.360 
very basic transition so from blurry

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:27.920 
very basic transition so from blurry
image<00:05:24.690> we<00:05:25.530> go<00:05:25.710> to<00:05:25.770> a<00:05:26.099> very<00:05:26.699> nice<00:05:26.970> crisp<00:05:27.479> image

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:27.930 
image we go to a very nice crisp image

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:31.250 
image we go to a very nice crisp image
actually<00:05:28.349> a<00:05:28.740> full<00:05:29.370> power<00:05:29.550> focus<00:05:29.940> image<00:05:30.360> you

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:31.260 
actually a full power focus image you

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.469 
actually a full power focus image you
can<00:05:31.440> increase<00:05:32.340> the<00:05:32.580> time<00:05:32.729> of<00:05:32.909> the<00:05:33.000> animation

00:05:33.469 --> 00:05:33.479 
can increase the time of the animation

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:36.379 
can increase the time of the animation
by<00:05:33.949> dragging<00:05:34.949> the<00:05:35.250> keyframes<00:05:35.729> apart<00:05:36.240> from

00:05:36.379 --> 00:05:36.389 
by dragging the keyframes apart from

00:05:36.389 --> 00:05:38.779 
by dragging the keyframes apart from
each<00:05:36.539> other<00:05:36.659> right<00:05:37.169> so<00:05:37.199> now<00:05:37.590> if<00:05:37.830> there<00:05:38.130> is<00:05:38.340> more

00:05:38.779 --> 00:05:38.789 
each other right so now if there is more

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:41.060 
each other right so now if there is more
time<00:05:38.970> between<00:05:39.930> these<00:05:40.110> two<00:05:40.260> keyframes<00:05:40.470> the

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:41.070 
time between these two keyframes the

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:42.620 
time between these two keyframes the
slower<00:05:41.400> the<00:05:41.550> animation<00:05:41.970> is<00:05:42.060> going<00:05:42.210> to<00:05:42.270> be<00:05:42.419> and

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:42.630 
slower the animation is going to be and

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:45.529 
slower the animation is going to be and
you<00:05:43.320> can<00:05:43.470> likewise<00:05:44.310> increase<00:05:44.789> than<00:05:45.090> a<00:05:45.270> speed

00:05:45.529 --> 00:05:45.539 
you can likewise increase than a speed

00:05:45.539 --> 00:05:47.990 
you can likewise increase than a speed
of<00:05:45.659> the<00:05:45.750> animation<00:05:46.169> by<00:05:46.680> bringing<00:05:47.400> these<00:05:47.760> two

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:48.000 
of the animation by bringing these two

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.210 
of the animation by bringing these two
keyframes<00:05:48.300> closer<00:05:48.930> to<00:05:49.080> each<00:05:49.169> other<00:05:49.289> so<00:05:50.130> now

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:50.220 
keyframes closer to each other so now

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:52.430 
keyframes closer to each other so now
you<00:05:50.310> can<00:05:50.400> see<00:05:50.550> the<00:05:51.539> animation<00:05:51.960> is<00:05:52.050> much<00:05:52.229> faster

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:52.440 
you can see the animation is much faster

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:55.129 
you can see the animation is much faster
and<00:05:53.120> that's<00:05:54.120> how<00:05:54.300> it<00:05:54.389> supposed<00:05:54.630> to<00:05:54.659> work<00:05:54.870> with

00:05:55.129 --> 00:05:55.139 
and that's how it supposed to work with

00:05:55.139 --> 00:05:56.990 
and that's how it supposed to work with
keyframes<00:05:55.650> if<00:05:55.860> you<00:05:56.039> ever<00:05:56.220> want<00:05:56.430> to<00:05:56.490> remove<00:05:56.789> any

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:57.000 
keyframes if you ever want to remove any
