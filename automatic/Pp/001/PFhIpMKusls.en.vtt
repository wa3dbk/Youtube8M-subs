00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
that you don't have to learn jumps by

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.810 
that you don't have to learn jumps by
hitting<00:00:21.420> jumps<00:00:21.779> so<00:00:22.500> not<00:00:22.800> not<00:00:23.279> at<00:00:23.400> first<00:00:23.580> anyway

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
hitting jumps so not not at first anyway

hit jumps you're doing that on flat
ground<00:00:33.930> you<00:00:34.050> do<00:00:34.200> it<00:00:34.320> on<00:00:34.469> green<00:00:34.710> runs<00:00:35.040> you're

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
ground you do it on green runs you're

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.920 
ground you do it on green runs you're
doing<00:00:35.370> it<00:00:35.460> on<00:00:35.579> blue<00:00:35.790> runs<00:00:36.030> you<00:00:36.390> build<00:00:36.660> up<00:00:36.809> the

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
doing it on blue runs you build up the

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.470 
doing it on blue runs you build up the
skills<00:00:37.170> that<00:00:37.290> you<00:00:37.440> need<00:00:37.469> for<00:00:37.800> jumps<00:00:38.129> before

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
feet evenly with the right timing that's

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.290 
feet evenly with the right timing that's
something<00:00:47.520> you<00:00:47.640> can<00:00:47.730> practice<00:00:47.850> on<00:00:48.180> they're

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
something you can practice on they're

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.790 
something you can practice on they're
just<00:00:48.480> going<00:00:48.780> straight<00:00:48.899> on<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.320> flat<00:00:49.559> green

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
just going straight on the flat green

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.490 
just going straight on the flat green
run<00:00:50.039> you<00:00:50.610> can<00:00:50.760> practice<00:00:51.199> getting<00:00:52.199> used<00:00:52.410> to

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
run you can practice getting used to

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.709 
run you can practice getting used to
taking<00:00:52.860> off<00:00:53.129> and<00:00:53.340> landing<00:00:53.399> off<00:00:54.149> drops<00:00:54.480> by

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
taking off and landing off drops by

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.410 
taking off and landing off drops by
doing<00:00:55.079> little<00:00:55.829> mini<00:00:56.160> side<00:00:56.520> hits<00:00:56.789> and<00:00:57.000> jumping

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
doing little mini side hits and jumping

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.119 
doing little mini side hits and jumping
off<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.690> side<00:00:57.870> of<00:00:57.899> cat<00:00:58.199> tracks<00:00:58.500> where<00:00:58.739> there's

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
off the side of cat tracks where there's

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.090 
off the side of cat tracks where there's
a<00:00:59.219> small<00:00:59.489> one<00:00:59.820> or<00:00:59.850> two<00:01:00.180> foot<00:01:00.449> slope<00:01:01.320> and<00:01:01.590> a<00:01:01.829> drop

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
a small one or two foot slope and a drop

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.210 
a small one or two foot slope and a drop
after<00:01:02.280> that<00:01:02.579> so<00:01:02.930> you<00:01:03.930> can<00:01:04.080> practice<00:01:04.229> doing

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
after that so you can practice doing

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.070 
after that so you can practice doing
mini<00:01:05.400> as<00:01:05.610> of<00:01:06.000> that<00:01:06.330> and<00:01:06.540> getting<00:01:06.780> used<00:01:06.960> to

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
mini as of that and getting used to

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.690 
mini as of that and getting used to
looking<00:01:07.560> at<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.799> landing<00:01:08.130> stomping<00:01:08.580> down

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
looking at the landing stomping down

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.880 
looking at the landing stomping down
both<00:01:08.939> feet<00:01:09.180> evenly<00:01:09.330> and<00:01:09.990> that'll<00:01:10.650> get<00:01:10.770> you

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
both feet evenly and that'll get you

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.500 
both feet evenly and that'll get you
used<00:01:11.159> to<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.460> feeling<00:01:11.820> of<00:01:11.909> getting<00:01:12.060> a<00:01:12.270> tiny

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
used to the feeling of getting a tiny

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.330 
used to the feeling of getting a tiny
little<00:01:12.780> bit<00:01:12.930> of<00:01:13.080> air<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:13.590> that's<00:01:14.130> going<00:01:14.280> to

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
little bit of air and that's going to

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.160 
little bit of air and that's going to
build<00:01:14.549> your<00:01:14.640> confidence<00:01:14.790> up<00:01:15.119> one<00:01:15.659> step<00:01:15.960> more

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
build your confidence up one step more

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.260 
build your confidence up one step more
so<00:01:16.770> it's<00:01:17.159> all<00:01:17.340> about<00:01:17.490> getting<00:01:17.670> those<00:01:17.909> skills

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
so it's all about getting those skills

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.359 
so it's all about getting those skills
together<00:01:18.659> and<00:01:18.990> building<00:01:19.380> them<00:01:19.560> up<00:01:19.710> step<00:01:20.040> by

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
together and building them up step by

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:21.950 
together and building them up step by
step<00:01:20.700> so<00:01:21.030> everything<00:01:21.479> has<00:01:21.600> a<00:01:21.630> safe

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
step so everything has a safe

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.200 
step so everything has a safe
progression<00:01:22.560> to<00:01:22.680> it<00:01:22.830> and<00:01:23.009> another<00:01:23.880> thing<00:01:24.030> you

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
progression to it and another thing you

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.300 
progression to it and another thing you
can<00:01:24.330> do<00:01:24.450> is<00:01:24.659> right<00:01:24.900> switch<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.890> right<00:01:26.100> and

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
can do is right switch the right and

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.950 
can do is right switch the right and
brining<00:01:26.490> switch<00:01:26.790> helps<00:01:27.119> you<00:01:27.240> a<00:01:27.299> lot<00:01:27.570> it<00:01:27.750> makes

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
brining switch helps you a lot it makes

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.319 
brining switch helps you a lot it makes
you<00:01:28.080> focus<00:01:28.290> on<00:01:28.790> what<00:01:29.790> you<00:01:29.939> should<00:01:30.180> be<00:01:30.299> doing

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329
