00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:10.219
 now we are already starting the new platinum assembly 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:13.219
 no distributor 

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:17.179
 that's just what makes them 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:22.999
 when setting the adjusting screw 

00:00:22.999 --> 00:00:25.999
 off 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:33.900
 for those who do not have 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.380
 lots of practice can be a bit difficult to come 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:38.309
 in practice for the function but none of this 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.200
 nothing to squeeze too much 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.760
 not to harm 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.760
 a constat has a skater table indexing prices 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.980
 here it does not need much force but a question 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.280
 now if you can get out of here 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.430
 now the point with take-off point 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.890
 and I'll turn off the engine with the hot hand in the worn out afternoon 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.390
 you can see the axis of followers of america ramdev so I vote I go 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:06.680
 put on 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.680
 this piece of platinum plastic 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.150
 at the highest point 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.190
 bc stands out 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.350
 I had more or less here 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.830
 from then on the rest we will regulate regardless of the 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.970
 have you can put cocaine any of the four bumps in case 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.480
 of a six cylinder 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:32.130
 none of the six points reckless this procedure serves any 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.240
 moto 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.240
 at the time you place it at the top of one of the shoulders 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.330
 the skater to keep a small gap roberta tokyo 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.350
 csa was the client in court 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.460
 so I'll get my hummingbird billion 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:46.670
 with the blade 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.260
 041 fusca case 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.030
 on the millimeter hummingbird 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.480
 so I'll put the blade and she'll have to have the least interference 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.780
 in the same temple open to force 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.780
 the skater's contacts in trafalgar 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.840
 so here if you can see through the video on that top 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.649
 there is iptu that will have a budget with the screwdriver 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:13.129
 for you can make small adjustments 

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:16.129
 in the distance of the other the platinum 

00:02:16.679 --> 00:02:19.679
 a chameleon 

00:02:20.529 --> 00:02:23.529
 Until I get it it's too tight now 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:27.629
 what matters 

00:02:28.689 --> 00:02:32.479
 dortmund 040 until entering cough the team to touch 

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:35.689
 the two contracts nothing better than to enjoy 

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:36.639
 ef 

00:02:36.639 --> 00:02:39.359
 to standard 

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:42.669
 So 

00:02:42.669 --> 00:02:45.289
 5 

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:48.289
 or just score 

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:51.809
 you can see that 

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:56.529
 I ask this from here in the case of 

00:02:56.529 --> 00:02:59.529
 messi distributor at 0 40 

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:05.729
 chipp 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:08.909
 now 

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:11.959
 it was a fiction 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:16.399
 the shame of the little screwed platinum then from that moment he is 

00:03:16.399 --> 00:03:20.179
 claiming a clearance determined by the factory 040 

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:24.749
 when you turn gold 

00:03:24.749 --> 00:03:28.480
 a minute later everything changed the former picker will avenge 

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:30.629
 pointed it out 

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:33.629
 but moves away from the platinum skater and closed the account 

00:03:34.169 --> 00:03:37.329
 and so on when they arrived next jump and will open 

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:40.519
 The crash is popping up an abrupt rise in seabra shooter 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:43.469
 What I'm going to call the contest. 

00:03:43.469 --> 00:03:46.079
 The cymbal you hit 

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:49.079
 that the polymorphism is 

00:03:49.719 --> 00:03:52.679
 What are we not going to be part of? 

00:03:52.679 --> 00:03:55.859
 but starting in this video with fitha coming here 

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:59.669
 so this part is almost finished if you're a fan of the guy 

00:03:59.669 --> 00:04:03.259
 capricious you took the opportunity to analyze where it comes from here on the 

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:05.839
 for me it would be the most wanted 

00:04:05.839 --> 00:04:07.959
 You can have a little cÃ¡ssio. 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:10.959
 now 

00:04:11.919 --> 00:04:14.979
 but not even a little bit 

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:17.979
 - even what I'm going to spend here 

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:20.519
 I'm from the country 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:22.800
 Your sardine rules here 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.259
 nor to maintain 

00:04:25.259 --> 00:04:26.460
 or 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.120
 the way of the goal 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.840
 plastic there of the platinum hammer 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.129
 without wear what gives them chilique hewitt 

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:38.699
 came to be called that at this point a fault that was not 

00:04:40.249 --> 00:04:43.189
 party where it is installed 

00:04:43.189 --> 00:04:45.469
 so I'm going to score now 

00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:47.569
 the point adjustment 

00:04:47.569 --> 00:04:51.819
 why p - you switched skater adjusted his day off 

00:04:51.819 --> 00:04:54.139
 Now we're going to go on stage. 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:57.009
 that in other words the relative position 

00:04:57.009 --> 00:04:59.719
 everything that is difficult in relation to another 

00:04:59.719 --> 00:05:00.809
 around the team
