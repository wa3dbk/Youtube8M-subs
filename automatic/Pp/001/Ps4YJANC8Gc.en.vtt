and that that steel does go all the way

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.310 
and that that steel does go all the way
all<00:03:09.120> the<00:03:09.150> way<00:03:09.300> down<00:03:09.570> in<00:03:09.810> there<00:03:09.960> all<00:03:10.140> the<00:03:10.290> way

all the way down in there all the way
through<00:03:10.650> it<00:03:10.890> goes<00:03:11.820> all<00:03:11.970> the<00:03:12.000> way<00:03:12.180> in<00:03:14.300> it's<00:03:15.300> it's

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
through it goes all the way in it's it's

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.890 
through it goes all the way in it's it's
got<00:03:16.110> good<00:03:16.440> good<00:03:17.010> tensile<00:03:17.460> strength<00:03:17.850> it's<00:03:18.840> a

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
got good good tensile strength it's a

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:33.020 
got good good tensile strength it's a
strong<00:03:19.260> knife

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.840 

so<00:03:33.660> if<00:03:33.750> I<00:03:33.840> get<00:03:34.050> a<00:03:34.080> closer<00:03:34.740> look<00:03:34.920> for<00:03:35.550> you<00:03:35.670> on

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
so if I get a closer look for you on

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.570 
so if I get a closer look for you on
that<00:03:36.060> on<00:03:36.330> those<00:03:36.569> serrations<00:03:37.280> just<00:03:38.280> so<00:03:38.400> you<00:03:38.459> can

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 
that on those serrations just so you can

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:44.330 
that on those serrations just so you can
see<00:03:38.819> just<00:03:38.850> what<00:03:39.180> you're<00:03:39.330> getting<00:03:42.920> it's<00:03:43.920> that's

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
see just what you're getting it's that's

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.460 
see just what you're getting it's that's
got<00:03:44.580> a<00:03:44.610> real<00:03:44.940> ripping<00:03:45.540> pattern<00:03:45.990> to<00:03:46.170> it<00:03:46.200> and

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
got a real ripping pattern to it and

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.420 
got a real ripping pattern to it and
that'll<00:03:46.770> really<00:03:47.130> make<00:03:47.360> make<00:03:48.360> quick<00:03:48.720> work<00:03:48.750> of<00:03:49.200> a

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
that'll really make make quick work of a

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:56.180 
that'll really make make quick work of a
mistake<00:03:54.230> or<00:03:55.230> anything<00:03:55.590> you're<00:03:55.709> cutting<00:03:56.040> with

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
mistake or anything you're cutting with

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:00.820 
mistake or anything you're cutting with
it'd<00:03:56.370> be<00:03:56.850> a<00:03:56.880> good<00:03:57.090> bread<00:03:57.360> knife<00:03:57.600> too<00:03:57.840> I'd<00:03:58.020> say

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:00.830 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:03.380 

surprisingly<00:04:01.830> it<00:04:02.160> has<00:04:02.340> a<00:04:02.370> very<00:04:02.730> sharp<00:04:02.790> point

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
surprisingly it has a very sharp point

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.680 
surprisingly it has a very sharp point
on<00:04:03.569> it<00:04:03.860> which<00:04:04.860> isn't<00:04:05.550> really<00:04:05.760> necessary<00:04:06.090> but

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
on it which isn't really necessary but

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:15.510 
on it which isn't really necessary but
it's<00:04:06.959> just<00:04:07.170> an<00:04:07.290> added<00:04:07.440> bonus

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:15.520 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:19.110 

now<00:04:16.120> i'm<00:04:16.420> afraid<00:04:16.810> i'm<00:04:16.989> sorry<00:04:17.709> i<00:04:17.830> haven't<00:04:18.700> gone

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:19.120 
now i'm afraid i'm sorry i haven't gone

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.240 
now i'm afraid i'm sorry i haven't gone
and<00:04:19.300> cooked<00:04:19.600> up<00:04:19.780> a<00:04:19.900> steak<00:04:20.230> and<00:04:20.260> I<00:04:20.800> don't<00:04:21.010> have<00:04:21.220> a

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250 
and cooked up a steak and I don't have a

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.820 
and cooked up a steak and I don't have a
stake<00:04:21.670> here<00:04:22.030> ready<00:04:22.300> for<00:04:22.390> you<00:04:22.750> that<00:04:22.930> I<00:04:22.960> can<00:04:23.170> do<00:04:23.800> a

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
stake here ready for you that I can do a

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:28.080 
stake here ready for you that I can do a
cutting<00:04:24.280> demonstration<00:04:25.000> on<00:04:25.120> but<00:04:25.420> I<00:04:26.670> do<00:04:27.670> have

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.090 
cutting demonstration on but I do have

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:33.360 
cutting demonstration on but I do have
though<00:04:28.450> here<00:04:28.810> a<00:04:30.270> strawberry<00:04:31.270> which<00:04:32.200> in<00:04:33.040> some

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370 
though here a strawberry which in some

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:35.310 
though here a strawberry which in some
respects<00:04:33.850> does<00:04:34.150> have<00:04:34.390> a<00:04:34.420> similar<00:04:34.750> consistency

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320 
respects does have a similar consistency

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:40.440 
respects does have a similar consistency
to<00:04:35.980> a<00:04:36.010> well<00:04:36.250> cook<00:04:36.520> steak<00:04:36.850> and<00:04:38.820> in<00:04:39.820> any<00:04:39.970> event<00:04:40.090> it

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:40.450 
to a well cook steak and in any event it

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:42.360 
to a well cook steak and in any event it
will<00:04:40.510> make<00:04:40.960> a<00:04:40.990> good<00:04:41.230> slicing<00:04:41.830> cutting

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:42.370 
will make a good slicing cutting

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:51.990 
will make a good slicing cutting
demonstration<00:04:46.200> okay

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.270 

there<00:04:52.480> you<00:04:52.540> go<00:04:52.720> you<00:04:52.780> can<00:04:53.020> see<00:04:53.230> that<00:04:53.260> it<00:04:54.040> just

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.280 
there you go you can see that it just

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:55.830 
there you go you can see that it just
cuts<00:04:54.490> it<00:04:54.670> very<00:04:54.850> easily<00:04:55.060> as<00:04:55.450> you<00:04:55.480> would<00:04:55.720> expect

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840 
cuts it very easily as you would expect

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.440 
cuts it very easily as you would expect
I<00:04:56.440> don't<00:04:57.310> really<00:04:57.550> know<00:04:57.670> what<00:04:57.820> I'm<00:04:57.910> proving

00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:58.450 
I don't really know what I'm proving

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:05.160 
I don't really know what I'm proving
with<00:04:58.600> this<00:04:58.900> but<00:05:02.460> we'll<00:05:03.460> cut<00:05:03.790> a<00:05:03.820> very<00:05:04.390> thin

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:05.170 
with this but we'll cut a very thin

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:12.120 
with this but we'll cut a very thin
slice<00:05:05.680> there<00:05:07.650> and<00:05:08.650> see<00:05:08.920> how<00:05:09.100> and<00:05:09.850> that<00:05:10.300> is<00:05:11.130> it's

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:12.130 
slice there and see how and that is it's

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:14.730 
slice there and see how and that is it's
a<00:05:12.160> very<00:05:12.370> sharp<00:05:12.640> knife<00:05:13.020> that's<00:05:14.020> basically<00:05:14.260> what

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:14.740 
a very sharp knife that's basically what

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:17.730 
a very sharp knife that's basically what
I'm<00:05:14.830> just<00:05:15.040> showing<00:05:15.250> you<00:05:15.400> it's<00:05:16.390> nice<00:05:16.630> and<00:05:16.740> nice

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:17.740 
I'm just showing you it's nice and nice

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:20.670 
I'm just showing you it's nice and nice
and<00:05:17.980> sharp<00:05:18.280> that<00:05:18.520> serrated<00:05:19.120> blade<00:05:19.570> some<00:05:20.320> some

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:20.680 
and sharp that serrated blade some some

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:22.740 
and sharp that serrated blade some some
say<00:05:20.890> the<00:05:21.070> serrated<00:05:21.400> blade<00:05:21.760> can't<00:05:22.090> make<00:05:22.360> a<00:05:22.390> fine

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:22.750 
say the serrated blade can't make a fine

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:28.230 
say the serrated blade can't make a fine
cut<00:05:24.060> that's<00:05:26.070> that's<00:05:27.070> an<00:05:27.220> extremely<00:05:27.850> thin

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:28.240 
cut that's that's an extremely thin

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:51.999 
cut that's that's an extremely thin
slice<00:05:28.600> right<00:05:28.900> there<00:05:31.740> there<00:05:32.740> you<00:05:32.830> go

00:05:51.999 --> 00:05:52.009 

00:05:52.009 --> 00:05:54.650 

well

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:54.660 

00:05:54.660 --> 00:06:12.330 

that's<00:05:55.200> as<00:05:55.380> thin<00:05:55.590> as<00:05:55.620> it<00:05:55.830> gets<00:05:56.040> right<00:05:56.190> there

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:12.340 

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:15.300 

well<00:06:13.270> it's<00:06:13.570> a<00:06:13.840> very<00:06:14.290> sharp<00:06:14.590> knife<00:06:14.740> that's

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:15.310 
well it's a very sharp knife that's

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:18.570 
well it's a very sharp knife that's
that's<00:06:15.610> my<00:06:15.820> point<00:06:16.050> it's<00:06:17.050> a<00:06:17.230> yes<00:06:18.010> I<00:06:18.220> think<00:06:18.250> it's

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:18.580 
that's my point it's a yes I think it's

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:21.450 
that's my point it's a yes I think it's
reasonably<00:06:19.419> attractive<00:06:19.600> I<00:06:20.290> would<00:06:21.070> look<00:06:21.250> good
