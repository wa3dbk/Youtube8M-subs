00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:12.139
 content of subscribers in a 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.139
 career 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:17.020
 and going a little crazy because I have 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:19.060
 this super strong I just stayed 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:20.920
 deaf with that expression and the second 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.570
 question is good the first because of 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.860
 done no question because he has 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:25.990
 exploded something there so he has 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:27.730
 exploited the ramp has exploded because 

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:29.680
 I do not have anything because I was here is 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.849
 a career in which then now that I 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:34.329
 I'm realizing I do not have a place 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:36.550
 minimap I honestly do not know why in 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:37.870
 the one that remains a bit pocha of things 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:39.969
 As they are there are people walking down the street 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:42.790
 people sucking the serum I do not understand anything 

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:46.089
 and I do not have time now to put 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:48.370
 the minimap therefore we're going to do 

00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:50.350
 that play is minimum for trick 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.239
 around here and I'm not sure where the 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.160
 control point sometimes puts you have to 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:55.570
 be here is worth now is the time 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.309
 to put minimum is also that we are 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:00.539
 in the air since here we can not do 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:04.629
 nothing looks alive from the inah perfect lad 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:06.490
 this part you saw it and the put of the 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:08.500
 interface and it will close because I can see what 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.870
 comes to be in what position voice not today 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.370
 it's not worth it, it's worth it, because now that 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:13.960
 the race is telling me so 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:17.520
 It is all this time in realizing 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:25.470
 of why is it here worth worth 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:25.470
 200,000 first three first models 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:35.189
 first perfect of the sporty foot what 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:35.189
 I have controlled too well it takes 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:42.200
 this is done a planning of the face of 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:43.520
 tampa news madryn already ballistic let's go 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.950
 let's go ahead first then have 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.229
 issued seriously that big for rocket 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.369
 around here a friend of mine love this 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:51.860
 another's career I swear 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:55.509
 there are four ramps there gigantista duck no 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.509
 could have been worth much 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.590
 I eat tried I do not know how it does not explode 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:09.650
 guys for us 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:09.650
 is now 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.580
 it's perfect 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.230
 as we are reviewing it is all normal 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.000
 guys me in the races that are gta 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.440
 I always carry everything I all 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.850
 the rockets just do not usually eat 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.980
 everything but in this one we are reviewing a 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.360
 kid that is not even average is this 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.300
 it's a sign guys this is the signal of 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.350
 the victory 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.860
 for the rockets in the air without them 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:37.940
 I say 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:41.280
 That man, well, if everything goes well 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.330
 We have four control points 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.420
 and we go for the second round 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:49.650
 effectively little by little 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:51.330
 there we are as we are 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.530
 with the interception in the air in the n 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:58.870
 in the air area December 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.870
 we are not importing being fatal 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:04.640
 these have gone all over like 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:08.019
 well know how the supreme luck since 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:13.749
 for the child a boy returns 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:13.749
 and this seems 

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:21.219
 I could not finish the race without 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:24.079
 explode or have to explode 

00:03:21.219 --> 00:03:26.599
 next the good thing that we follow first 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:28.359
 without any problems 

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:32.239
 It's worth devouring here very well 

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:33.349
 sir it seems that me because to another point 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:34.489
 mental view of guy to me 

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:37.189
 call those who catch me with nonsense 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:39.260
 and the last one wins is that the companions 

00:03:37.189 --> 00:03:41.959
 we are going here we are not going to critics we 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.909
 let's go from here we're jumping these 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:45.260
 jumps a wow vision is missing we are missing 

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:48.819
 six dots of control for the end 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.819
 my mother how I turn which croquet and already 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:54.880
 people are coming out there they are going to eat my 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:54.880
 vigil 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:03.890
 that is that fate has said that that 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:07.390
 man did not deserve the other chest jumped the 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:07.390
 point but what motivates you 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:17.230
 same 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:24.880
 and in addition to water 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:27.160

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:36.940
 clear that is to put me and already do the 

00:04:33.849 --> 00:04:39.040

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:50.740
 ok we have the first one in front of me 

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:50.740
 it is not viable 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:58.569
 that man is that sir is the first one is 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:04.870

 win win just win I'm this 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:08.590
 career you can extract a moral and 

00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:10.599
 is that by very confident and good by 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:14.430
 You can never win much 

00:05:10.599 --> 00:05:17.380
 trust you can never trust because 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:20.380
 the last because of all the 

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:23.400
 pressures that have gotten a lot state 

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:25.479
 very way it quadruple ramp and plan 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:27.660
 strange I 've never seen that with four 

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:27.660
 ramps
