00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.609
 dulce de mateo good if you get it by 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.849
 internet by home banking or by letters 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:11.160
 the possibility of waiving the subsidy 

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:12.480
 we are talking about light water and gas no 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.940
 means that this is bound to 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.220
 giving up the subsidy is understood I do not know 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.740
 I am clove beloved apply the best with 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.840
 plates is not mandatory because a lot 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.689
 people are coming these legends 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.310
 in which he is told I'm going to take the 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.349
 art they take 20 seconds and they give it 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.880
 is totally in the case of having two 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.040
 amounts elaborates one of them the debt 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.130
 will be paid even when the other has been 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.180
 active in online payments and maturities 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.850
 banking 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:42.840
 which means that two amounts arrive 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:45.780
 suppose if with the subsidy 200 pesos 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.899
 the electricity bill without the subsidy 400 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.449
 pesos if we pay the 200 pesos even though this one 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:54.300
 figure the other you already paid your bill 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.520
 light well I'm clear you understand why 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.940
 many people are asking me there are two 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.980
 Amounts enabled for the payment look 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.350
 you are an associate for the state 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.760
 national and not another but with paying the 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.670
 lowest amount 1 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.790
 already paid your clear bill that's the 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.140
 automatic information that I have of 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.000
 tomato with the accounts which is going to 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.370
 charge the bank the smaller one has to 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.080
 speak small topics because you except 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:21.180
 cobos has renounced the subsidy but 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.800
 If you do not have to charge waivers of 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.090
 more kids of course except that 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.770
 you had in the neighborhoods where you already 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.020
 the subsidy is automatically lowered 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.940
 each dive and private neighborhoods harbor 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.890
 but most people do not 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.690
 live in those neighborhoods not like that 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.540
 communication that arrives by per home 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:39.000
 banking look at the companies that you 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.460

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.840
 is Buenos Aires waters limited company no 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.990

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.600

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:54.050

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.300
 Argentines did not know what is going on but good 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.540
 this is the communication that arrives but 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:15.270
 I insist you pay the lower amount and 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.770
 you paid your bill what happens we say 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.420

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:21.060
 voluntarily subsidize an option 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.850
 they take taken something more than 20 thousand 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.980

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.970
 entry 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.560
 maybe it's a mistake of the Santander river that 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.080
 sent through homebanking that this 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.090
 water is a joint stock company maybe not 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:42.310
 I know but as far as I knew no 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:45.239
 It was the end of the dirty but also 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:48.160
 also in some or in some neighborhoods 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:50.260
 where it has begun to analyze if it has 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.840

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.170
 same as the option of homebanking with 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:45.040
 the two heels the cheapest and the most 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:46.599
 expensive 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.310
 but you do not have to pay the most expensive 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:50.200

 good quote with a power 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.759
 acquisitive what does not mean that 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.139

 attentions I think most yes but 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.750

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:41.110

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:43.210
