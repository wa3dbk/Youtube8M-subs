hey<00:00:00.570> guys<00:00:00.780> CB<00:00:01.260> tech<00:00:01.500> here<00:00:01.800> and<00:00:02.010> today<00:00:02.939> I'm

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:03.060 
hey guys CB tech here and today I'm

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.289 
hey guys CB tech here and today I'm
going<00:00:03.090> to<00:00:03.389> show<00:00:03.600> you<00:00:03.659> how<00:00:04.500> to<00:00:04.529> create<00:00:05.299> some

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
going to show you how to create some

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.730 
going to show you how to create some
different<00:00:07.109> cactus<00:00:07.529> traps<00:00:08.960> so<00:00:09.960> to<00:00:10.380> start<00:00:10.590> off

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
different cactus traps so to start off

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.669 
different cactus traps so to start off
here<00:00:11.120> this<00:00:12.120> first<00:00:12.450> one<00:00:12.719> is<00:00:12.840> very<00:00:13.049> simple<00:00:13.349> and

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
here this first one is very simple and

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.960 
here this first one is very simple and
it<00:00:13.799> only<00:00:13.920> uses<00:00:14.160> one<00:00:14.490> cactus<00:00:16.369> so<00:00:17.369> the<00:00:17.760> first

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
it only uses one cactus so the first

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.560 
it only uses one cactus so the first
step<00:00:18.240> is<00:00:18.449> to<00:00:18.779> dig<00:00:19.470> a<00:00:19.619> 3<00:00:19.890> by<00:00:20.070> 3<00:00:20.100> by<00:00:20.580> 3<00:00:20.910> hole<00:00:21.270> and

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
step is to dig a 3 by 3 by 3 hole and

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.859 
step is to dig a 3 by 3 by 3 hole and
place<00:00:22.199> a<00:00:22.529> piece<00:00:23.039> of<00:00:23.070> sand<00:00:23.519> in<00:00:23.789> the<00:00:23.820> center<00:00:24.570> and

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
place a piece of sand in the center and

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.550 
place a piece of sand in the center and
then<00:00:25.650> next<00:00:26.430> part<00:00:26.580> is<00:00:27.570> place<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:28.050> cactus<00:00:28.410> on

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
then next part is place the cactus on

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.120 
then next part is place the cactus on
the<00:00:28.650> sand<00:00:28.949> and<00:00:29.189> then<00:00:30.119> put<00:00:31.080> 4<00:00:31.380> dirt<00:00:31.590> blocks<00:00:31.920> in

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
the sand and then put 4 dirt blocks in

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.799 
the sand and then put 4 dirt blocks in
the<00:00:32.279> corners<00:00:32.700> and<00:00:33.530> then<00:00:34.530> after<00:00:34.950> that<00:00:35.809> you're

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
the corners and then after that you're

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.760 
the corners and then after that you're
gonna<00:00:36.930> take<00:00:37.170> your<00:00:37.410> dirt<00:00:37.890> and<00:00:39.020> fill<00:00:40.020> in<00:00:40.260> around

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
gonna take your dirt and fill in around

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:41.270 
gonna take your dirt and fill in around
it

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
it

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.280 
it
like<00:00:42.120> this<00:00:42.360> this<00:00:42.600> will<00:00:42.750> keep<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:43.050> cracked

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
like this this will keep the cracked

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.950 
like this this will keep the cracked
cactus<00:00:43.860> from<00:00:44.100> growing<00:00:45.059> higher<00:00:46.340> and<00:00:47.870> then<00:00:48.870> you

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
cactus from growing higher and then you

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.860 
cactus from growing higher and then you
just<00:00:49.170> fill<00:00:49.379> it<00:00:49.530> in<00:00:50.239> so<00:00:51.239> let's<00:00:51.510> all<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.690> way<00:00:51.809> up

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
just fill it in so let's all the way up

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.100 
just fill it in so let's all the way up
and<00:00:52.050> then<00:00:52.350> you'll<00:00:53.129> just<00:00:53.190> fall<00:00:53.699> in<00:00:53.910> or<00:00:54.329> whoever

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
and then you'll just fall in or whoever

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.860 
and then you'll just fall in or whoever
the<00:00:55.980> trap<00:00:56.190> is<00:00:56.370> for<00:00:56.579> will<00:00:57.090> just<00:00:57.300> fall<00:00:57.510> in<00:00:57.660> then

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
the trap is for will just fall in then

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.170 
the trap is for will just fall in then
they're<00:00:58.410> stuck<00:00:58.649> in<00:00:58.829> here<00:00:59.010> only<00:00:59.550> in<00:00:59.760> survival

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
they're stuck in here only in survival

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.840 
they're stuck in here only in survival
mode<00:01:00.210> and<00:01:00.620> they'll<00:01:01.620> just<00:01:02.100> die<00:01:02.280> not<00:01:02.670> unless

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
mode and they'll just die not unless

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.340 
mode and they'll just die not unless
they<00:01:03.090> can<00:01:03.239> destroy<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:03.660> block<00:01:03.840> in<00:01:04.019> time<00:01:04.199> and

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
they can destroy the block in time and

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.109 
they can destroy the block in time and
get<00:01:04.409> out<00:01:04.559> you<00:01:05.159> couldn't<00:01:05.460> make<00:01:05.519> it<00:01:05.580> deeper<00:01:06.030> if

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
get out you couldn't make it deeper if

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.530 
get out you couldn't make it deeper if
you<00:01:06.180> wanted<00:01:06.450> to<00:01:07.700> so<00:01:08.700> that's<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.150> first<00:01:09.360> thing

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
it's much more camouflaged when it's

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.020 
it's much more camouflaged when it's
just<00:01:13.950> a<00:01:14.070> hole<00:01:14.430> and<00:01:14.729> there's<00:01:15.270> grass<00:01:15.630> around<00:01:15.930> it

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030 
just a hole and there's grass around it

this next one I have for you is this
thing<00:01:21.420> here<00:01:21.750> so<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.259> player<00:01:22.470> will<00:01:22.500> climb<00:01:22.979> up

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
thing here so the player will climb up

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.609 
thing here so the player will climb up
here<00:01:23.430> and<00:01:23.720> they'll<00:01:24.720> stand<00:01:24.869> on<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.140> trapdoor

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
here and they'll stand on the trapdoor

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.890 
here and they'll stand on the trapdoor
to<00:01:26.159> try<00:01:26.369> to<00:01:26.430> reach<00:01:26.670> this<00:01:27.060> chest<00:01:27.570> right<00:01:27.869> here

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
to try to reach this chest right here

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.649 
to try to reach this chest right here
and<00:01:28.670> they<00:01:29.670> won't<00:01:29.880> be<00:01:30.000> able<00:01:30.090> to<00:01:30.240> reach<00:01:30.329> it<00:01:30.479> just

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
and they won't be able to reach it just

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.700 
and they won't be able to reach it just
because<00:01:30.900> it's<00:01:31.070> just<00:01:32.070> far<00:01:32.250> enough<00:01:32.369> away<00:01:33.710> and

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
because it's just far enough away and

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:40.550 
because it's just far enough away and
when<00:01:34.950> they<00:01:35.130> tap<00:01:35.549> it<00:01:37.970> they'll<00:01:39.020> actually<00:01:40.020> tap

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
when they tap it they'll actually tap

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.530 
when they tap it they'll actually tap
the<00:01:40.890> trapdoor<00:01:41.400> and<00:01:41.549> they'll<00:01:41.670> fall<00:01:41.909> down<00:01:41.939> there

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
the trapdoor and they'll fall down there

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.590 
the trapdoor and they'll fall down there
so<00:01:43.259> let<00:01:43.470> me<00:01:43.500> see<00:01:43.829> if<00:01:44.100> I<00:01:44.490> so<00:01:44.820> if<00:01:44.939> I<00:01:45.000> tap<00:01:45.060> it

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
so let me see if I so if I tap it

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.039 
so let me see if I so if I tap it
I<00:01:46.070> fell<00:01:47.070> down<00:01:47.270> sometimes<00:01:48.270> it's<00:01:48.450> hard<00:01:48.689> to<00:01:48.780> get

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
I fell down sometimes it's hard to get

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.920 
I fell down sometimes it's hard to get
it<00:01:49.200> in<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.979> right<00:01:50.220> spot<00:01:50.670> as<00:01:50.939> you<00:01:51.540> can<00:01:51.689> see<00:01:51.840> the

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
it in the right spot as you can see the

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.450 
it in the right spot as you can see the
trapdoor<00:01:52.409> isn't<00:01:53.310> lit<00:01:53.460> up<00:01:53.640> until<00:01:55.310> sometimes<00:01:56.310> it

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
trapdoor isn't lit up until sometimes it

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.670 
trapdoor isn't lit up until sometimes it
doesn't<00:01:56.969> work<00:01:57.090> if<00:01:57.299> you're<00:01:57.450> ever<00:01:57.630> on<00:01:58.049> this

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
doesn't work if you're ever on this

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.490 
doesn't work if you're ever on this
block<00:01:58.920> it<00:01:59.130> may<00:01:59.310> or<00:01:59.430> may<00:01:59.520> not<00:01:59.549> work<00:01:59.790> so<00:02:00.500> it's

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
block it may or may not work so it's

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.469 
block it may or may not work so it's
like<00:02:01.649> a<00:02:01.680> 50-50<00:02:02.399> chance<00:02:02.430> of<00:02:02.759> that<00:02:02.909> working<00:02:03.149> and

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
like a 50-50 chance of that working and

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.109 
like a 50-50 chance of that working and
then<00:02:04.409> with<00:02:04.890> all<00:02:04.979> this<00:02:05.189> fence<00:02:05.490> and<00:02:05.790> these<00:02:05.939> half

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
then with all this fence and these half

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.850 
then with all this fence and these half
blocks<00:02:06.420> here<00:02:06.659> they<00:02:06.810> can't<00:02:07.049> jump<00:02:07.350> and<00:02:07.560> get<00:02:07.740> it

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
blocks here they can't jump and get it

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.650 
blocks here they can't jump and get it
because<00:02:08.369> they'll<00:02:08.640> just<00:02:08.819> fall<00:02:09.209> down<00:02:09.270> into<00:02:09.569> the

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
because they'll just fall down into the

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:10.169 
because they'll just fall down into the
cactus

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.179 
cactus

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:13.050 
cactus
so<00:02:10.780> let<00:02:10.869> me<00:02:10.899> show<00:02:11.049> you<00:02:11.140> how<00:02:11.200> to<00:02:11.290> build<00:02:11.439> this<00:02:12.060> if

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
so let me show you how to build this if

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.289 
so let me show you how to build this if
I<00:02:13.209> can<00:02:13.450> get<00:02:13.750> out<00:02:13.900> all<00:02:14.409> right<00:02:14.470> so<00:02:14.909> to<00:02:15.909> start<00:02:16.150> off

00:02:16.289 --> 00:02:16.299 
I can get out all right so to start off

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:18.839 
I can get out all right so to start off
you<00:02:16.360> just<00:02:16.720> take<00:02:17.230> a<00:02:17.500> stair<00:02:17.980> here<00:02:18.159> and<00:02:18.340> place<00:02:18.610> it

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:18.849 
you just take a stair here and place it

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:24.059 
you just take a stair here and place it
and<00:02:18.970> then<00:02:19.030> put<00:02:19.540> a<00:02:20.250> a<00:02:21.269> four<00:02:22.269> tall<00:02:22.930> wall<00:02:23.560> here<00:02:23.860> and

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 
and then put a a four tall wall here and

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:29.039 
and then put a a four tall wall here and
three<00:02:24.610> wide<00:02:25.920> and<00:02:26.920> then<00:02:27.329> put<00:02:28.329> this<00:02:28.510> pattern

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:29.049 
three wide and then put this pattern

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:35.250 
three wide and then put this pattern
right<00:02:29.980> here<00:02:30.189> and<00:02:30.430> then<00:02:32.099> I<00:02:33.810> have<00:02:34.810> to<00:02:34.930> look<00:02:35.019> at<00:02:35.140> my

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
right here and then I have to look at my

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:36.780 
right here and then I have to look at my
example<00:02:35.319> because<00:02:35.859> I<00:02:35.920> didn't<00:02:36.159> memorize<00:02:36.280> it<00:02:36.640> to

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
example because I didn't memorize it to

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.619 
example because I didn't memorize it to
us<00:02:36.970> so<00:02:37.180> you<00:02:37.209> got<00:02:37.540> to<00:02:37.659> put<00:02:38.430> this<00:02:39.430> as<00:02:40.030> tall<00:02:40.420> as<00:02:40.599> the

00:02:40.619 --> 00:02:40.629 
us so you got to put this as tall as the

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:48.170 
us so you got to put this as tall as the
wall<00:02:40.840> beside<00:02:40.989> it<00:02:42.120> and<00:02:43.560> then<00:02:45.930> leave<00:02:46.930> that<00:02:46.989> one

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
wall beside it and then leave that one

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.680 
wall beside it and then leave that one
and<00:02:49.180> then<00:02:49.329> go<00:02:49.629> like<00:02:49.780> this<00:02:51.329> just<00:02:52.329> actually<00:02:52.510> just

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
and then go like this just actually just

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.259 
and then go like this just actually just
too<00:02:53.260> high<00:02:53.560> here<00:02:53.980> and<00:02:54.129> then<00:02:54.700> keep<00:02:54.879> going<00:02:55.180> as

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:55.269 
too high here and then keep going as

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:58.819 
too high here and then keep going as
high<00:02:55.389> as<00:02:55.450> the<00:02:55.810> wall<00:02:55.959> there<00:02:56.260> so<00:02:57.090> fill<00:02:58.090> that<00:02:58.239> in

00:02:58.819 --> 00:02:58.829 
high as the wall there so fill that in

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:02.940 
high as the wall there so fill that in
and<00:02:59.829> then<00:02:59.889> two<00:03:00.700> tall<00:03:01.060> there<00:03:01.439> then<00:03:02.439> the<00:03:02.590> rest<00:03:02.799> of

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
and then two tall there then the rest of

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.069 
and then two tall there then the rest of
this<00:03:03.099> is<00:03:03.370> going<00:03:04.329> to<00:03:04.450> be<00:03:04.540> as<00:03:04.629> tall<00:03:04.840> as<00:03:05.170> that<00:03:05.409> part

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:07.079 
this is going to be as tall as that part

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:12.619 
this is going to be as tall as that part
so<00:03:08.079> you<00:03:08.109> just<00:03:08.439> fill<00:03:08.799> that<00:03:08.829> in<00:03:10.889> except<00:03:11.889> for<00:03:11.920> this

00:03:12.619 --> 00:03:12.629 
so you just fill that in except for this

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:17.930 
so you just fill that in except for this
back<00:03:13.629> one<00:03:13.840> here<00:03:14.049> that<00:03:15.010> needs<00:03:15.280> to<00:03:15.430> stay<00:03:15.669> one

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.520 

those<00:03:18.940> just<00:03:19.269> help<00:03:19.480> to<00:03:19.540> hide<00:03:19.810> it<00:03:19.989> from<00:03:20.139> the<00:03:20.230> back

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
those just help to hide it from the back

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:26.659 
those just help to hide it from the back
so<00:03:21.780> once<00:03:22.780> you<00:03:22.959> have<00:03:23.079> that<00:03:23.139> built<00:03:24.090> you<00:03:25.090> need<00:03:25.329> to

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:26.669 
so once you have that built you need to

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:32.830 
so once you have that built you need to
fill<00:03:27.669> this<00:03:27.819> in<00:03:27.879> like<00:03:28.209> that<00:03:28.419> right<00:03:28.840> there

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:40.240 

and<00:03:32.930> then<00:03:33.739> go<00:03:34.520> inside<00:03:36.489> you<00:03:37.489> need<00:03:37.700> to<00:03:38.890> place<00:03:39.890> the

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
and then go inside you need to place the

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:41.790 
and then go inside you need to place the
cactus

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:41.800 
cactus

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:45.850 
cactus
all<00:03:42.800> right<00:03:43.010> so<00:03:43.510> place<00:03:44.510> the<00:03:44.660> cactus<00:03:45.050> right<00:03:45.230> here

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:45.860 
all right so place the cactus right here

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:49.990 
all right so place the cactus right here
too<00:03:46.730> high<00:03:46.970> and<00:03:47.870> then<00:03:48.140> put<00:03:48.470> one<00:03:49.220> here<00:03:49.489> one<00:03:49.970> here

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
too high and then put one here one here

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.130 
too high and then put one here one here
and<00:03:50.739> then<00:03:52.450> destroy<00:03:53.450> this<00:03:53.630> block<00:03:53.900> right<00:03:54.080> here

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:54.140 
and then destroy this block right here

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:59.110 
and then destroy this block right here
and<00:03:54.640> then<00:03:55.640> place<00:03:56.300> that<00:03:57.400> so<00:03:58.400> now<00:03:58.580> those<00:03:58.849> cactus

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
and then place that so now those cactus

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:00.699 
and then place that so now those cactus
will<00:03:59.420> not<00:03:59.569> grow<00:03:59.720> any<00:03:59.900> higher<00:04:00.080> because<00:04:00.260> there's

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:00.709 
will not grow any higher because there's

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:03.309 
will not grow any higher because there's
blocks<00:04:01.040> next<00:04:01.340> to<00:04:01.519> them<00:04:01.670> right<00:04:02.239> here<00:04:02.450> so<00:04:02.660> the

00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:03.319 
blocks next to them right here so the

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:05.500 
blocks next to them right here so the
next<00:04:03.470> thing<00:04:03.739> is<00:04:03.980> to<00:04:04.010> put<00:04:04.310> a<00:04:04.459> half<00:04:04.670> block<00:04:04.970> or

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:05.510 
next thing is to put a half block or

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:09.729 
next thing is to put a half block or
half<00:04:05.720> slab<00:04:06.790> on<00:04:07.790> top<00:04:07.850> of<00:04:08.209> that<00:04:08.299> cactus<00:04:08.780> and<00:04:09.590> then

00:04:09.729 --> 00:04:09.739 
half slab on top of that cactus and then

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:12.610 
half slab on top of that cactus and then
put<00:04:10.010> one<00:04:10.360> right<00:04:11.360> here<00:04:11.870> and<00:04:12.019> then<00:04:12.260> just<00:04:12.290> dry

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
put one right here and then just dry

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.719 
put one right here and then just dry
that<00:04:12.830> so<00:04:13.069> it's<00:04:13.220> right<00:04:13.370> there<00:04:13.580> and<00:04:14.319> you<00:04:15.319> need<00:04:15.470> to

00:04:15.719 --> 00:04:15.729 
that so it's right there and you need to

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:21.280 
that so it's right there and you need to
put<00:04:16.729> a<00:04:16.910> fence<00:04:17.419> I<00:04:19.150> just<00:04:20.150> put<00:04:20.329> this<00:04:20.450> here<00:04:20.630> so<00:04:20.840> it

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:21.290 
put a fence I just put this here so it

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:22.800 
put a fence I just put this here so it
looks<00:04:21.320> a<00:04:21.680> little<00:04:21.829> bit<00:04:22.010> nicer

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:22.810 
looks a little bit nicer

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:27.550 
looks a little bit nicer
you<00:04:23.810> can<00:04:24.050> design<00:04:24.560> this<00:04:24.680> however<00:04:24.889> you<00:04:25.040> want<00:04:26.560> but

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:27.560 
you can design this however you want but

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.530 
you can design this however you want but
this<00:04:27.889> keeps<00:04:28.280> players<00:04:28.520> out<00:04:28.820> if<00:04:28.910> I<00:04:29.000> put<00:04:29.240> a<00:04:29.270> fence

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:29.540 
this keeps players out if I put a fence

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:33.219 
this keeps players out if I put a fence
there<00:04:29.750> and<00:04:29.930> there<00:04:30.430> so<00:04:31.430> they<00:04:31.610> cannot<00:04:32.020> so<00:04:33.020> once

00:04:33.219 --> 00:04:33.229 
there and there so they cannot so once

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:35.200 
there and there so they cannot so once
they're<00:04:33.380> up<00:04:33.470> here<00:04:33.620> they<00:04:33.800> can't<00:04:34.070> like<00:04:34.400> go

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.210 
they're up here they can't like go

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:37.570 
they're up here they can't like go
around<00:04:35.330> the<00:04:35.570> edge<00:04:35.720> and<00:04:36.229> go<00:04:37.010> over<00:04:37.160> to<00:04:37.190> reach<00:04:37.430> the

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 
around the edge and go over to reach the

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:41.219 
around the edge and go over to reach the
chest<00:04:38.530> so<00:04:39.530> now<00:04:39.680> you<00:04:39.740> need<00:04:39.890> to<00:04:39.979> put<00:04:40.160> a<00:04:40.190> chest<00:04:40.520> in

00:04:41.219 --> 00:04:41.229 
chest so now you need to put a chest in

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:48.159 
chest so now you need to put a chest in
right<00:04:42.229> here<00:04:44.680> in<00:04:45.680> the<00:04:45.860> sand<00:04:46.130> so<00:04:46.640> it's<00:04:47.080> sort<00:04:48.080> of

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:48.169 
right here in the sand so it's sort of

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:51.790 
right here in the sand so it's sort of
concealed<00:04:48.650> and<00:04:49.130> if<00:04:50.090> they<00:04:50.240> see<00:04:50.539> it<00:04:50.740> it's<00:04:51.740> hard

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:51.800 
concealed and if they see it it's hard

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.920 
concealed and if they see it it's hard
to<00:04:51.950> reach<00:04:52.190> because<00:04:53.120> they<00:04:53.390> will<00:04:53.600> not<00:04:53.690> be<00:04:53.750> able

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:53.930 
to reach because they will not be able

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:55.870 
to reach because they will not be able
to<00:04:54.050> reach<00:04:54.140> it<00:04:54.289> all<00:04:54.470> because<00:04:55.160> of<00:04:55.340> how<00:04:55.460> far<00:04:55.700> the

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:55.880 
to reach it all because of how far the

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:59.850 
to reach it all because of how far the
way<00:04:56.000> they<00:04:56.240> are<00:04:56.300> and<00:04:56.570> then<00:04:57.850> the<00:04:58.850> next<00:04:59.180> part<00:04:59.330> is<00:04:59.510> I

00:04:59.850 --> 00:04:59.860 
way they are and then the next part is I

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.230 
way they are and then the next part is I
got<00:05:00.860> to<00:05:00.950> put<00:05:01.070> a<00:05:01.100> block<00:05:01.310> there<00:05:01.550> I<00:05:01.580> forgot<00:05:01.820> to<00:05:02.090> put

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.240 
got to put a block there I forgot to put

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:03.060 
got to put a block there I forgot to put
one<00:05:02.389> right<00:05:02.510> there

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:03.070 
one right there

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:08.820 
one right there
and<00:05:04.070> then<00:05:04.430> you<00:05:04.639> gotta<00:05:04.850> put<00:05:05.150> one<00:05:05.600> here<00:05:05.990> one<00:05:06.169> here

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:08.830 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:14.170 

so<00:05:11.229> let's<00:05:12.229> see<00:05:12.500> okay<00:05:12.919> I<00:05:13.100> think<00:05:13.700> that<00:05:13.910> is

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:14.180 
so let's see okay I think that is

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:14.830 
so let's see okay I think that is
correct

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:14.840 
correct

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:19.900 
correct
you<00:05:15.139> need<00:05:15.320> the<00:05:15.669> trapdoor<00:05:16.669> and<00:05:17.710> ladders<00:05:18.910> need

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:19.910 
you need the trapdoor and ladders need

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:22.270 
you need the trapdoor and ladders need
some<00:05:20.090> ladders<00:05:20.450> to<00:05:20.630> get<00:05:20.750> up

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:22.280 
some ladders to get up

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:28.520 
some ladders to get up
you<00:05:23.280> could<00:05:23.550> also<00:05:23.819> put<00:05:24.389> this<00:05:24.599> in<00:05:24.930> the<00:05:25.379> ground<00:05:27.530> so

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:28.530 
you could also put this in the ground so

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:30.050 
you could also put this in the ground so
let's<00:05:28.860> put<00:05:29.099> the<00:05:29.219> trapdoor<00:05:29.610> right<00:05:29.729> there<00:05:29.879> on

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:30.060 
let's put the trapdoor right there on

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:34.519 
let's put the trapdoor right there on
the<00:05:30.210> top<00:05:30.479> block<00:05:30.810> and<00:05:33.020> let's<00:05:34.020> see<00:05:34.229> how<00:05:34.349> that

00:05:34.519 --> 00:05:34.529 
the top block and let's see how that

00:05:34.529 --> 00:05:36.920 
the top block and let's see how that
looks<00:05:34.740> that<00:05:35.370> looks<00:05:35.430> correct<00:05:35.909> let's<00:05:36.629> try<00:05:36.870> it

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:36.930 
looks that looks correct let's try it

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:40.999 
looks that looks correct let's try it
out<00:05:37.020> it<00:05:37.259> may<00:05:37.469> or<00:05:37.710> may<00:05:37.830> not<00:05:37.860> work<00:05:39.529> if<00:05:40.529> I<00:05:40.680> try<00:05:40.949> to

00:05:40.999 --> 00:05:41.009 
out it may or may not work if I try to

00:05:41.009 --> 00:05:44.390 
out it may or may not work if I try to
reach<00:05:41.189> work<00:05:42.800> sometimes<00:05:43.800> it<00:05:44.009> works<00:05:44.219> and

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:44.400 
reach work sometimes it works and

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:45.790 
reach work sometimes it works and
sometimes<00:05:44.490> it<00:05:44.819> doesn't

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:45.800 
sometimes it doesn't

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:50.360 
sometimes it doesn't
