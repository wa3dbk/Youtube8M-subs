00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
and the opponents up against here was a

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.280 
and the opponents up against here was a
very<00:00:38.100> very<00:00:38.550> strong<00:00:38.910> defender<00:00:39.450> I<00:00:39.600> had<00:00:39.840> a<00:00:39.870> really

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
very very strong defender I had a really

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.600 
very very strong defender I had a really
difficult<00:00:40.320> time<00:00:40.649> breaking<00:00:41.040> him<00:00:41.190> down<00:00:41.399> and

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
difficult time breaking him down and

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.490 
difficult time breaking him down and
this<00:00:41.760> was<00:00:41.969> pretty<00:00:42.210> much<00:00:42.300> my<00:00:42.570> only<00:00:42.870> chances<00:00:43.350> a

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
this was pretty much my only chances a

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.639 
this was pretty much my only chances a
proper<00:00:44.250> chances<00:00:44.789> in<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.329> in<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:46.170> first<00:00:46.410> half

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
proper chances in the in the first half

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.709 
proper chances in the in the first half
because<00:00:47.039> I<00:00:47.309> had<00:00:47.640> a<00:00:47.670> really<00:00:47.760> difficult<00:00:48.300> time

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
because I had a really difficult time

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.240 
because I had a really difficult time
getting<00:00:48.989> in<00:00:49.289> on<00:00:49.379> with<00:00:49.530> a<00:00:49.559> proper<00:00:49.890> shot<00:00:50.070> he

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
getting in on with a proper shot he

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.799 
getting in on with a proper shot he
would<00:00:50.370> say<00:00:50.550> most<00:00:50.820> of<00:00:50.969> my<00:00:51.090> efforts<00:00:51.570> and<00:00:51.719> they

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
would say most of my efforts and they

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.299 
would say most of my efforts and they
were<00:00:51.899> from<00:00:52.140> outside<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.739> box<00:00:52.949> so<00:00:53.070> when<00:00:53.190> you

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
were from outside the box so when you

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.069 
were from outside the box so when you
look<00:00:53.430> at<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.610> halftime<00:00:53.940> stats<00:00:54.180> he<00:00:54.870> didn't

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
look at the halftime stats he didn't

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.479 
look at the halftime stats he didn't
really<00:00:55.170> create<00:00:55.410> anything<00:00:55.649> because<00:00:56.010> he<00:00:56.190> relied

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
really create anything because he relied

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.160 
really create anything because he relied
on<00:00:56.520> foob<00:00:56.969> threw<00:00:57.329> over<00:00:57.570> the<00:00:57.660> tough<00:00:57.809> footballs

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
on foob threw over the tough footballs

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.510 
on foob threw over the tough footballs
and<00:00:58.289> I<00:00:58.350> was<00:00:58.469> able<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:58.739> defend<00:00:59.039> those<00:00:59.190> but

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
and I was able to defend those but

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.310 
and I was able to defend those but
myself<00:00:59.789> I<00:01:00.149> couldn't<00:01:00.510> really<00:01:00.600> break<00:01:00.899> him<00:01:01.079> down

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
myself I couldn't really break him down

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.439 
myself I couldn't really break him down
but<00:01:01.859> then<00:01:02.010> in<00:01:02.219> than<00:01:02.370> 60<00:01:02.789> million<00:01:03.059> we<00:01:03.180> hit<00:01:03.329> him

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
but then in than 60 million we hit him

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:04.969 
but then in than 60 million we hit him
on<00:01:03.629> a<00:01:03.660> counter-attack<00:01:04.140> we<00:01:04.439> used<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.739> very

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
on a counter-attack we used the very

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.469 
on a counter-attack we used the very
powerful<00:01:05.280> skills<00:01:05.820> to<00:01:05.939> go<00:01:06.060> past<00:01:06.270> one<00:01:06.450> defender

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
powerful skills to go past one defender

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.170 
powerful skills to go past one defender

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
looking to see if we actually could

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.869 
looking to see if we actually could
score<00:02:07.200> some<00:02:07.380> goals<00:02:07.590> and<00:02:07.920> in<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.369> 90th<00:02:08.819> minute
