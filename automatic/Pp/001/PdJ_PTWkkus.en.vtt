00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
was taking all these corner kicks this

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.580 
was taking all these corner kicks this
fall<00:01:50.549> and<00:01:51.000> they<00:01:51.479> were<00:01:51.540> just<00:01:51.899> the<00:01:52.049> same<00:01:52.290> as

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
fall and they were just the same as

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.700 
fall and they were just the same as
they'd<00:01:52.710> been<00:01:52.890> a<00:01:52.920> year<00:01:53.159> before<00:01:54.560> even<00:01:55.560> though<00:01:55.680> I

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
they'd been a year before even though I

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.469 
they'd been a year before even though I
have<00:01:55.860> to<00:01:55.979> wear<00:01:56.100> a<00:01:56.130> brace<00:01:56.430> like<00:01:56.729> that's<00:01:57.299> just

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
have to wear a brace like that's just

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.810 
have to wear a brace like that's just
added<00:01:57.840> support<00:01:58.259> and<00:01:58.560> I<00:01:58.860> feel<00:01:59.070> like<00:01:59.219> you<00:01:59.640> can

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
added support and I feel like you can

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.100 
added support and I feel like you can
come<00:01:59.969> back<00:02:00.119> as<00:02:00.329> strong<00:02:00.570> as<00:02:00.689> you<00:02:00.780> were<00:02:00.899> I<00:02:00.930> know

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
come back as strong as you were I know

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.539 
come back as strong as you were I know
that<00:02:01.409> was<00:02:01.530> something<00:02:01.860> I<00:02:01.979> was<00:02:02.009> really<00:02:02.130> afraid

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
that was something I was really afraid

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.459 
that was something I was really afraid
of<00:02:02.670> but<00:02:03.210> with<00:02:03.420> hard<00:02:03.659> work<00:02:03.840> it's<00:02:04.049> definitely

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
of but with hard work it's definitely

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.649 
of but with hard work it's definitely
possible
