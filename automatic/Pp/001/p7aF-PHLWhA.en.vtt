00:00:00.291 --> 00:00:03.265
 Puyol: Smee skurveni lidri. 

00:00:03.311 --> 00:00:05.787
 What is..? I always live here first. 

00:00:06.262 --> 00:00:07.268
 Who are you? 

00:00:09.408 --> 00:00:15.339
 Ja ... skurveny Puyol, La Pobla..de..Segur. 

00:00:16.068 --> 00:00:17.179
 Who are you? 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.373
 Chimi..churri? 

00:00:25.408 --> 00:00:27.265
 Chygrynsky: Chygrynsky. 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.135
 Puyol: Aaah..ty you the new Ukrainian who came to replace me. 

00:00:51.685 --> 00:00:54.579
 Puyol: Heh. Oh, to him ... he doesn't even know how to talk to me ... 

00:00:54.614 --> 00:00:59.412
 And what about the grapes. Do people in your country know who's a hairdresser? 

00:01:01.582 --> 00:01:05.191
 At this time there is not enough room for two long-haired players, you know? 

00:01:08.923 --> 00:01:13.047
 And make your clothes look, look somehow. Look at the captain. 

00:01:13.082 --> 00:01:14.851
 Here we train all to 100%. 

00:01:14.886 --> 00:01:19.212
 I am every day 300 km with stones in my shoes to harden my feet. 

00:01:24.812 --> 00:01:26.061
 And you? 

00:01:32.768 --> 00:01:34.705
 Fucking Kullonynsky. 

00:01:43.924 --> 00:01:48.234
 And now even place. Freaky, "fucking" I thought of as a show. 

00:01:48.269 --> 00:01:50.111
 and not as an insult. 

00:01:55.634 --> 00:01:57.332
 Oh prepac. I did not know it. 

00:01:58.515 --> 00:02:00.449
 Is your home milac also a sheep? 

00:02:01.815 --> 00:02:04.627
 And also the mistake of having to train, right? 

00:02:06.442 --> 00:02:07.782
 What's her name? 

00:02:08.528 --> 00:02:09.512
 Chygrynsky: Chygrynsky. 

00:02:09.547 --> 00:02:12.306
 Puyol: But not you! That sheep! 

00:02:12.865 --> 00:02:13.523
 Chygrynsky: Quica. 

00:02:16.762 --> 00:02:19.289
 Puyol: My name is Queca. 

00:02:20.634 --> 00:02:23.305
 Quica and Queca. 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.712
 Chygrynsky: Quica Romaiova. 

00:02:25.747 --> 00:02:27.168
 Puyol: Oh no! Romaiova, Romaiova 

00:02:27.203 --> 00:02:30.192
 Our animals have no surname, Kullonynsky. 

00:02:30.227 --> 00:02:33.730
 My sheep is also not Queca Puyol. 

00:02:33.765 --> 00:02:36.948
 Of course, if we were married, it could be .. 

00:02:36.983 --> 00:02:39.820
 but that probably won't happen. 

00:02:41.428 --> 00:02:42.519
 and tell me: 

00:02:42.554 --> 00:02:45.961
 Also, your sheep is stuck when you leave some hair in the shower? 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.780
 Chygrynsky you bastard.
