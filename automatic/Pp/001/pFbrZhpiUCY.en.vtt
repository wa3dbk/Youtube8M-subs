00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:10.240
 Eh, it is a space for a tenor saxophone with a guard error . 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:13.590
 by system of the probe wrecker 2 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:15.840
 Laser is a dream number 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:21.050
 It is like this 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:21.050
 In I in I KimuAkira care This is a gold plate 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.600
 Hmm 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:48.460
 It is a baffle, but it has a baffle like this 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:50.739
 So much high baffle 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:56.399
 Not high 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:56.399
 Or even not do it high baffle why of course I high I may 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:04.540
 Not so expensive studio 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:06.750
 The same Gardener's studio model 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:09.940
 I think there is a king 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:12.520
 Compared to that full 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:15.310
 It is low, recapture 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:18.210
 Well now the baffle is 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.210
 The long one 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:25.470
 I may not be a manager 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:28.570
 Oh By the way, this is 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.920
 Deco style 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:33.759
 Riko Nino 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.759
 Old that 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:45.570
 It is an old dikoff 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:47.900
 When I compare it, I feel that the baffle is slightly higher than the travel part 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.900
 is not it 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.799
 Slightly higher 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:58.380
 It is slightly higher infection It is a head 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.960
 And gathered some 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.660
 Slightly 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:12.200
 What feels good 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.140
 It's something like this 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.450
 Yes 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.900
 Huh 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:20.420
 I would like to measure the opening all the time 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.510
 Bach 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:25.370
 Measure with digital gauge 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:29.840
 Attempt 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:33.650
 But with 51 51 15.7 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:35.380
 It is about 115 because it is 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.930
 7 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.180
 That's what it looks like 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:43.370
 that 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:47.030
 It is an original opening as published by the manufacturer 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:50.810
 Gar Della roughly Nde this one-size 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:53.709
 When you say drinks, it is around 8 stars 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.709
 I think 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:58.700
 Say you Deko 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.480

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.480
 In this 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:05.190
 It is this space 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:15.050
 This is to in used goods 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:15.050

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:20.090

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.379
 Very beautiful 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:47.630
 There is no one and it has been repaired somehow 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:50.710
 There is no cure, but it is in a beautiful state as it is in the middle of the county . 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:50.710
 Back to 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.740
 Nail is also very 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:01.340
 The condition is good 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:07.000
 It has become 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:07.000
 There is no damage in the boat Blue is 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:12.160

 Gold plating is firmly left 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:30.270
 I feel like 

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:30.270
 Because there is no need for cutting edge 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.560
 Oh dear 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:38.289
 More and more

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:42.569

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.689
