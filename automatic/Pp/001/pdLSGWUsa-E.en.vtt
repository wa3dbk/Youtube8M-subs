cutie mark as little daisies

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.360

think Daisy's actually have more petals

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:42.450 
think Daisy's actually have more petals
so<00:04:41.110> it's<00:04:41.229> just<00:04:41.350> some<00:04:41.500> random<00:04:41.889> white<00:04:42.160> flower

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:42.460
