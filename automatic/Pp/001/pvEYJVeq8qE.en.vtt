00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
played which is very frustrating but it

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.090

am comfortable doing in this game
finding<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.490> tight<00:01:11.670> ends<00:01:11.970> over<00:01:12.150> and<00:01:12.450> over

finding the tight ends over and over
again<00:01:12.750> as<00:01:13.020> we<00:01:13.140> get<00:01:13.260> a<00:01:13.290> huge<00:01:13.650> play<00:01:13.860> down<00:01:13.890> the

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
again as we get a huge play down the

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.190 
again as we get a huge play down the
field<00:01:14.400> that<00:01:14.520> time<00:01:14.760> Jordan<00:01:15.479> Cameron<00:01:15.720> on<00:01:15.990> the

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200

going<00:01:18.270> to<00:01:18.330> take<00:01:18.540> this<00:01:18.689> one<00:01:18.750> up<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.200> middle<00:01:19.229> for

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
going to take this one up the middle for

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.530 
going to take this one up the middle for
a<00:01:19.619> huge<00:01:19.950> gain<00:01:20.159> probably<00:01:21.030> could<00:01:21.240> have<00:01:21.270> gotten

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
a huge gain probably could have gotten

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.120 
a huge gain probably could have gotten
into<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:21.869> end<00:01:22.049> zone<00:01:22.200> if<00:01:22.470> I<00:01:22.590> didn't<00:01:22.830> try<00:01:22.979> and

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
into the end zone if I didn't try and

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.830 
into the end zone if I didn't try and
truck<00:01:23.369> there<00:01:23.580> but<00:01:23.729> I<00:01:23.759> thought<00:01:23.970> that<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.689> guy

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840

truck there but I thought that the guy
was<00:01:24.869> going<00:01:25.229> to<00:01:25.320> actually<00:01:25.710> hit<00:01:25.860> me<00:01:26.070> didn't

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
to get into the end zone with a pass to

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.200 
to get into the end zone with a pass to
Jordan<00:01:31.229> Cameron<00:01:31.470> again<00:01:31.979> nice<00:01:32.700> touch<00:01:33.000> down

there<00:01:40.560> on<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.770> first<00:01:40.920> drive<00:01:41.130> anyway<00:01:41.640> but<00:01:42.210> on

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
there on the first drive anyway but on

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:43.910 
there on the first drive anyway but on
the<00:01:42.420> very<00:01:42.450> first<00:01:42.840> play<00:01:43.079> he<00:01:43.259> hits<00:01:43.500> me<00:01:43.619> with<00:01:43.860> a

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
the very first play he hits me with a

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.429 
the very first play he hits me with a
little<00:01:44.340> bit<00:01:44.430> of<00:01:44.460> spacing<00:01:45.119> there<00:01:45.329> and<00:01:45.570> that's

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
little bit of spacing there and that's

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.190 
little bit of spacing there and that's
like<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.770> technical<00:01:47.399> side<00:01:47.880> of<00:01:47.939> madden<00:01:48.659> that<00:01:48.990> I

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
like the technical side of madden that I

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.649 
like the technical side of madden that I
just<00:01:49.439> don't<00:01:49.829> really<00:01:50.159> do<00:01:50.399> very<00:01:50.430> well<00:01:50.820> you<00:01:51.570> know

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
just don't really do very well you know

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:52.850 
just don't really do very well you know
running<00:01:51.930> plays<00:01:52.229> like<00:01:52.439> that<00:01:52.470> that<00:01:52.829> are

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
running plays like that that are

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.260 
running plays like that that are
actually<00:01:53.100> supposed<00:01:53.610> to<00:01:53.700> get<00:01:53.909> your<00:01:54.030> players

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
actually supposed to get your players

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.880 
actually supposed to get your players
open<00:01:54.630> and<00:01:54.750> not<00:01:54.840> just<00:01:55.079> begging<00:01:55.530> them<00:01:55.649> to<00:01:55.680> get

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
open and not just begging them to get

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.260 
open and not just begging them to get
open<00:01:56.100> which<00:01:56.369> is<00:01:56.490> what<00:01:56.610> I<00:01:56.640> pretty<00:01:56.939> much<00:01:57.030> always

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
open which is what I pretty much always

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.539 
open which is what I pretty much always
do<00:01:57.659> so<00:01:58.320> I<00:01:58.350> was<00:01:58.619> a<00:01:58.649> little<00:01:58.740> bit<00:01:59.040> worried<00:01:59.340> there

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
do so I was a little bit worried there

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.010 
do so I was a little bit worried there
that<00:01:59.700> he<00:01:59.820> actually<00:02:00.030> picked<00:02:00.360> a<00:02:00.509> play<00:02:00.719> that<00:02:00.899> was

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
that he actually picked a play that was

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.100 
that he actually picked a play that was
a<00:02:01.259> an<00:02:01.740> intelligent<00:02:02.640> play<00:02:02.880> but<00:02:03.689> he<00:02:03.840> kind<00:02:04.049> of

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
a an intelligent play but he kind of

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.139 
a an intelligent play but he kind of
made<00:02:04.290> up<00:02:04.469> for<00:02:04.710> in<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:05.040> opposite<00:02:05.490> direction<00:02:05.640> by

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
made up for in the opposite direction by

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.999 
made up for in the opposite direction by
just<00:02:06.390> chucking<00:02:06.840> it<00:02:06.930> into<00:02:07.229> coverage<00:02:07.649> a<00:02:07.680> bunch

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
just chucking it into coverage a bunch

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.490 
just chucking it into coverage a bunch
of<00:02:08.099> times<00:02:08.450> thankfully<00:02:09.450> for<00:02:09.660> him<00:02:09.840> he<00:02:10.050> was<00:02:10.259> able

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
of times thankfully for him he was able

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.410 
of times thankfully for him he was able
to<00:02:10.649> catch<00:02:11.039> a<00:02:11.190> lot<00:02:11.400> of<00:02:11.520> them<00:02:11.610> and<00:02:11.849> watch<00:02:12.180> this

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
to catch a lot of them and watch this

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.650 
to catch a lot of them and watch this
play<00:02:12.629> I<00:02:12.660> like<00:02:13.050> this<00:02:13.290> one

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
play I like this one

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:14.730 
play I like this one
I<00:02:13.690> haven't<00:02:13.900> seen<00:02:14.050> a<00:02:14.110> lot<00:02:14.290> of<00:02:14.320> people<00:02:14.500> actually

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:14.740 
I haven't seen a lot of people actually

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:16.560 
I haven't seen a lot of people actually
run<00:02:15.100> that<00:02:15.280> where<00:02:15.430> they<00:02:15.520> send<00:02:15.820> a<00:02:15.910> half<00:02:16.090> back<00:02:16.360> in

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.570 
run that where they send a half back in

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:18.390 
run that where they send a half back in
motion<00:02:17.050> and<00:02:17.200> then<00:02:17.500> pass<00:02:17.770> it<00:02:17.800> to<00:02:18.040> him<00:02:18.220> in<00:02:18.310> the

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
motion and then pass it to him in the

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.950 
motion and then pass it to him in the
flats<00:02:18.670> I<00:02:19.000> thought<00:02:19.360> he<00:02:19.450> was<00:02:19.510> gonna<00:02:19.630> do<00:02:19.810> it<00:02:19.840> again

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:19.960 
flats I thought he was gonna do it again

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.170 
flats I thought he was gonna do it again
here<00:02:20.530> but<00:02:20.830> he<00:02:21.040> was<00:02:21.160> actually<00:02:21.400> setting<00:02:21.940> up<00:02:22.060> a

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
here but he was actually setting up a

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.090 
here but he was actually setting up a
screen<00:02:23.020> pass<00:02:23.200> to<00:02:23.260> the<00:02:23.500> left<00:02:23.590> side<00:02:23.920> of<00:02:23.980> the

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
screen pass to the left side of the

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.740 
screen pass to the left side of the
field<00:02:24.280> thankfully<00:02:25.090> though<00:02:25.210> we<00:02:25.360> got<00:02:25.510> through

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
field thankfully though we got through

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.270 
field thankfully though we got through
on<00:02:25.870> the<00:02:26.020> pass<00:02:26.170> rush<00:02:26.410> and<00:02:26.620> did<00:02:26.770> get<00:02:26.890> the<00:02:27.040> sack

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 
on the pass rush and did get the sack

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.580 
on the pass rush and did get the sack
but<00:02:27.550> it<00:02:28.090> didn't<00:02:28.300> really<00:02:28.420> matter<00:02:28.690> because<00:02:29.170> he

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
but it didn't really matter because he

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.680 
but it didn't really matter because he
was<00:02:29.800> able<00:02:29.950> to<00:02:30.160> complete<00:02:30.490> a<00:02:30.520> pass<00:02:30.730> brought<00:02:31.450> up<00:02:31.600> a

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
was able to complete a pass brought up a

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.260 
was able to complete a pass brought up a
third<00:02:31.960> and<00:02:32.200> two<00:02:32.410> and<00:02:32.650> we<00:02:33.130> make<00:02:33.340> a<00:02:33.490> clutch<00:02:33.910> stop

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
third and two and we make a clutch stop

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:35.940 
third and two and we make a clutch stop
here<00:02:34.570> and<00:02:34.660> this<00:02:34.780> is<00:02:34.840> probably<00:02:35.260> one<00:02:35.770> of<00:02:35.800> the

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
here and this is probably one of the

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:37.740 
here and this is probably one of the
most<00:02:36.040> important<00:02:36.610> plays<00:02:36.790> of<00:02:36.970> the<00:02:37.000> game<00:02:37.060> fourth

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
most important plays of the game fourth

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.160 
most important plays of the game fourth

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
guy went with a false start so he got

for it he ended up having to kick the
field<00:02:47.800> goal<00:02:47.920> and<00:02:48.280> that<00:02:49.030> was<00:02:49.180> the<00:02:49.300> end<00:02:49.330> of<00:02:49.540> the

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
field goal and that was the end of the

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:51.300 
field goal and that was the end of the
half<00:02:49.810> essentially<00:02:50.440> so<00:02:50.590> he<00:02:50.740> did<00:02:50.890> get<00:02:51.040> the<00:02:51.130> ball

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
half essentially so he did get the ball

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.250 
half essentially so he did get the ball
again<00:02:51.550> here<00:02:51.760> down<00:02:52.030> three<00:02:52.300> to<00:02:52.390> seven<00:02:52.720> I<00:02:52.870> think

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
again here down three to seven I think

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:54.840 
again here down three to seven I think
that's<00:02:53.440> why<00:02:53.650> he<00:02:53.890> decided<00:02:54.190> to<00:02:54.370> kick<00:02:54.550> the<00:02:54.670> field

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:54.850 
that's why he decided to kick the field

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:55.770 
that's why he decided to kick the field
goal<00:02:54.940> because<00:02:55.180> he<00:02:55.240> knew<00:02:55.390> he<00:02:55.420> was<00:02:55.540> going<00:02:55.630> to<00:02:55.690> get

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
goal because he knew he was going to get

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.480 
goal because he knew he was going to get
the<00:02:55.930> ball<00:02:56.080> back<00:02:56.320> and<00:02:56.560> watch<00:02:57.010> this<00:02:57.190> he's<00:02:57.370> going

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:57.490 
the ball back and watch this he's going

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:59.190 
the ball back and watch this he's going
to<00:02:57.610> set<00:02:57.760> up<00:02:57.880> that<00:02:58.030> same<00:02:58.390> play<00:02:58.660> again<00:02:59.020> and<00:02:59.170> I

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
to set up that same play again and I

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.810 
to set up that same play again and I
really<00:02:59.530> just<00:02:59.740> didn't<00:03:00.010> have<00:03:00.130> an<00:03:00.220> answer<00:03:00.400> for<00:03:00.610> it

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
really just didn't have an answer for it

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:02.640 
really just didn't have an answer for it
he<00:03:00.940> probably<00:03:01.090> could<00:03:01.840> have<00:03:01.870> SAT<00:03:02.170> there<00:03:02.200> and<00:03:02.470> ran

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
he probably could have SAT there and ran

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.320 
he probably could have SAT there and ran
that<00:03:02.800> same<00:03:03.130> play<00:03:03.370> over<00:03:03.730> and<00:03:03.760> over<00:03:04.000> and<00:03:04.240> over

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:04.330 
that same play over and over and over

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:05.940 
that same play over and over and over
again<00:03:04.540> I<00:03:04.660> wouldn't<00:03:04.990> have<00:03:05.140> been<00:03:05.290> able<00:03:05.410> to<00:03:05.650> stop

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
again I wouldn't have been able to stop

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:07.500 
again I wouldn't have been able to stop
it<00:03:06.220> I<00:03:06.370> don't<00:03:06.730> know<00:03:06.820> what<00:03:07.030> I<00:03:07.060> need<00:03:07.270> to<00:03:07.300> do<00:03:07.480> to

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
it I don't know what I need to do to

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.320 
it I don't know what I need to do to
stop<00:03:07.810> that<00:03:07.840> thing<00:03:08.160> but<00:03:09.160> the<00:03:09.550> very<00:03:09.820> next<00:03:09.970> play

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:10.330 
stop that thing but the very next play

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:12.570 
stop that thing but the very next play
he<00:03:10.570> is<00:03:10.600> gonna<00:03:10.870> break<00:03:11.170> off<00:03:11.380> for<00:03:11.710> a<00:03:11.740> decent<00:03:12.130> gain

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:12.580 
he is gonna break off for a decent gain

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:15.510 
he is gonna break off for a decent gain
there<00:03:12.940> ah<00:03:13.590> his<00:03:14.590> running<00:03:14.950> game<00:03:15.070> was<00:03:15.190> kind<00:03:15.430> of

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:15.520 
there ah his running game was kind of

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.280 
there ah his running game was kind of
killing<00:03:15.730> me<00:03:15.940> here<00:03:16.120> I<00:03:16.270> I<00:03:16.450> just<00:03:16.870> didn't<00:03:17.200> really

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
killing me here I I just didn't really

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.050 
killing me here I I just didn't really
have<00:03:17.500> much<00:03:17.530> of<00:03:17.709> an<00:03:17.890> answer<00:03:18.010> for<00:03:18.370> five<00:03:18.640> rushes

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
have much of an answer for five rushes

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.690 
have much of an answer for five rushes
for<00:03:19.240> 43<00:03:19.930> yards<00:03:20.140> at<00:03:20.410> that<00:03:20.590> point<00:03:20.890> big

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
for 43 yards at that point big

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.130 
for 43 yards at that point big
production<00:03:22.270> for<00:03:22.480> his<00:03:22.570> running<00:03:22.870> game<00:03:23.020> and

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:23.140 
production for his running game and

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:24.720 
production for his running game and
usually<00:03:23.530> I'm<00:03:23.680> pretty<00:03:23.709> good<00:03:24.100> at<00:03:24.160> stopping<00:03:24.490> the

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
usually I'm pretty good at stopping the

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:26.370 
usually I'm pretty good at stopping the
run<00:03:24.880> so<00:03:25.120> I<00:03:25.150> was<00:03:25.330> a<00:03:25.360> little<00:03:25.450> bit<00:03:25.720> thrown<00:03:25.900> off<00:03:26.110> by

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
run so I was a little bit thrown off by

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:28.300

hands<00:05:21.940> I<00:05:22.210> mean<00:05:22.569> unless<00:05:22.690> you<00:05:22.990> maybe<00:05:23.289> got<00:05:23.469> like<00:05:23.650> a

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:23.680 
hands I mean unless you maybe got like a

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.499 
hands I mean unless you maybe got like a
deion<00:05:24.039> sanders<00:05:24.069> or<00:05:24.639> something<00:05:24.969> like<00:05:25.060> that<00:05:25.120> I

00:05:25.499 --> 00:05:25.509 
deion sanders or something like that I

00:05:25.509 --> 00:05:27.990 
deion sanders or something like that I
can't<00:05:26.110> find<00:05:26.379> anybody<00:05:26.800> who<00:05:27.069> can<00:05:27.340> make<00:05:27.520> a<00:05:27.699> catch

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:28.000 
can't find anybody who can make a catch

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.689 
can't find anybody who can make a catch
on<00:05:28.030> defense<00:05:28.750> it's<00:05:28.990> just<00:05:29.319> ridiculous<00:05:29.889> and<00:05:30.009> you

00:05:30.689 --> 00:05:30.699 
on defense it's just ridiculous and you

00:05:30.699 --> 00:05:32.700 
on defense it's just ridiculous and you
know<00:05:30.819> it<00:05:31.060> just<00:05:31.090> really<00:05:31.509> gets<00:05:31.630> so<00:05:31.900> frustrating

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:32.710 
know it just really gets so frustrating

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:36.059 
know it just really gets so frustrating
because<00:05:32.979> if<00:05:33.430> you<00:05:33.969> give<00:05:34.180> the<00:05:34.360> opposing<00:05:34.840> team<00:05:35.080> 25

00:05:36.059 --> 00:05:36.069 
because if you give the opposing team 25

00:05:36.069 --> 00:05:38.309 
because if you give the opposing team 25
chances<00:05:36.669> on<00:05:36.759> offense<00:05:37.180> on<00:05:37.360> every<00:05:37.750> single<00:05:37.930> game

00:05:38.309 --> 00:05:38.319 
chances on offense on every single game

00:05:38.319 --> 00:05:40.080 
chances on offense on every single game
eventually<00:05:39.310> yeah<00:05:39.460> they're<00:05:39.610> gonna<00:05:39.729> pick<00:05:39.940> up

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:40.090 
eventually yeah they're gonna pick up

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:41.760 
eventually yeah they're gonna pick up
these<00:05:40.240> third<00:05:40.569> and<00:05:40.750> longs<00:05:40.960> or<00:05:41.289> these<00:05:41.440> fourth

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:41.770 
these third and longs or these fourth

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:43.350 
these third and longs or these fourth
and<00:05:41.949> Long's<00:05:42.159> and<00:05:42.550> and<00:05:42.669> things<00:05:43.150> like<00:05:43.300> that

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:43.360 
and Long's and and things like that

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.779 
and Long's and and things like that
because<00:05:43.719> the<00:05:44.229> game<00:05:44.409> is<00:05:44.560> just<00:05:44.680> so<00:05:44.919> offensive

00:05:45.779 --> 00:05:45.789 
because the game is just so offensive

00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:48.420 
because the game is just so offensive
driven<00:05:46.240> it's<00:05:46.389> Madden<00:05:46.900> you<00:05:47.199> know<00:05:47.349> so<00:05:47.979> he<00:05:48.159> ends
