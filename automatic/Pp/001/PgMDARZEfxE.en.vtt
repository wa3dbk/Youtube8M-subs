00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 or burning youtuber welcome to 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:05.490
 our channel of Shannon life on in 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.319
 where you will find a great variety of 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.330
 tutorial videos about everything that 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.460
 it has to do with the brand of japan in 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.280
 this case we have the iphone 5 that 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:17.580
 then we will suddenly have an ipad or a 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.890
 iphone or any device and there 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.510
 paper that comes out in the future 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.939
 in this case we will make a video of how 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.430
 set the timer or use the 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.949
 timer of that phone which is 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.439
 very useful in the event that we need 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:33.630
 do a countdown of product 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.120
 let's say we 're going to cook something and 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.680
 we must know that in five minutes it 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.899
 should trigger an alarm or something 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.570
 basically for that is that it is the 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.850
 timer but before we invite you to

 videos leave questions comments 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.850
 suggestions 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.469
 to enter the timer 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.019
 simply that we are here for the 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:02.539
 Cell phone clock option 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:05.089
 we are by clock we go down to the fourth 

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:07.549
 option that is here the fourth option 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:10.040
 which is on the right side of the chronometer 

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:12.440
 says timer and the first thing that 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:15.110
 will use will be to use the 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.850
 timer and is to adjust the time with 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.890
 which should trigger the alarm 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:22.240
 let's say we are preparing a 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:24.830
 recipe and tells us that in 5 minutes leave 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:27.319
 prepare or almost cook or boil for 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.090
 five minutes we use the timer 

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:33.200
 five minutes and we just give it 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:36.799
 start the count immediately as 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:38.479
 will see is descending other than 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:41.720
 stopwatch that with all of ascending 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:44.319
 here the timer is descending 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.039
 immediately when the count is over 

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:48.679
 an alarm will sound 

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:51.920
 let's cancel how it is to use the 

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:53.600
 timer rain although in lawdar it and 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.890
 also for some cancel or we will 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:02:01.759
 put a very easy 1 very fast 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:05.600
 let's put it for 10 seconds for example and 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:07.640
 here we can set the alarm is to 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:14.200
 which has by default when with the 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:17.290
 stade lent the timer in 10 more 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:19.269
 let's not talk about seconds we do not have 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.000
 second timer then 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:24.840
 let's talk about 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.910
 One minute the fashion starts 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.060
 let's do a little patient and 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:31.620
 wait for the minutes to end so that 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.050
 let's listen and let's see that 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:37.550
 immediately the 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:40.250
 timer is for the alarm 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:42.560
