00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.500 
I didn't play too much on the beta on
xbox<00:00:35.070> so<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.700> controls<00:00:36.090> were<00:00:36.270> a<00:00:36.300> little

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
xbox so the controls were a little

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.799 
xbox so the controls were a little
little<00:00:37.230> wonky<00:00:37.410> to<00:00:37.770> me<00:00:37.920> but<00:00:38.360> we<00:00:39.360> were<00:00:39.480> able<00:00:39.540> to

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
little wonky to me but we were able to

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.020 
little wonky to me but we were able to
make<00:00:39.960> do<00:00:40.170> here<00:00:40.530> and<00:00:40.710> I<00:00:40.890> decided<00:00:41.430> to<00:00:41.640> pick<00:00:41.910> the

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
make do here and I decided to pick the

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.510 
make do here and I decided to pick the
support<00:00:42.420> kit<00:00:42.629> on<00:00:43.290> pc<00:00:44.040> i've<00:00:44.190> been<00:00:44.340> running

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
support kit on pc i've been running

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.610 
support kit on pc i've been running
primarily<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.480> engineer<00:00:46.020> kit<00:00:46.230> almost

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
primarily the engineer kit almost

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.350 
primarily the engineer kit almost
exclusively<00:00:47.190> in<00:00:47.460> fact<00:00:47.760> i<00:00:47.879> think<00:00:47.910> it<00:00:48.180> may<00:00:48.329> be

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
exclusively in fact i think it may be

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.979 
exclusively in fact i think it may be
exclusively<00:00:49.200> at<00:00:49.559> this<00:00:49.710> point<00:00:49.980> on<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.250> pc<00:00:50.579> and

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:50.989 
exclusively at this point on the pc and

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:54.520 
exclusively at this point on the pc and
i<00:00:51.989> figured<00:00:52.320> what<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:52.739> hell<00:00:52.949> go<00:00:53.160> with<00:00:53.309> support

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530 
i figured what the hell go with support

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.680 
i figured what the hell go with support
support<00:00:55.530> is<00:00:55.949> a<00:00:55.980> class<00:00:56.370> that<00:00:56.789> i<00:00:56.850> haven't<00:00:57.300> played

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
support is a class that i haven't played

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.860 
support is a class that i haven't played
much<00:00:57.719> of<00:00:58.170> throughout<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.590> alpha<00:00:58.949> and<00:00:58.980> beta

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870 
much of throughout the alpha and beta

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.479 
much of throughout the alpha and beta
personally<00:01:00.870> I<00:01:00.930> I<00:01:01.559> had<00:01:01.800> it<00:01:01.920> in<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.100> back<00:01:02.280> of<00:01:02.309> my

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
personally I I had it in the back of my

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:03.950 
personally I I had it in the back of my
mind<00:01:02.789> that<00:01:03.000> it<00:01:03.059> would<00:01:03.239> be<00:01:03.329> kind<00:01:03.600> of<00:01:03.719> useless

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
mind that it would be kind of useless

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.539 
mind that it would be kind of useless
and<00:01:04.290> that<00:01:04.379> it<00:01:04.470> wouldn't<00:01:04.739> be<00:01:04.830> as<00:01:04.949> useful<00:01:05.189> in<00:01:05.460> the

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
and that it wouldn't be as useful in the

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.160 
and that it wouldn't be as useful in the
battlefield<00:01:05.880> as<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.390> other<00:01:06.540> classes<00:01:06.810> were

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.920 
the support kit so now I'm starting to

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
going to move up here into this hallway

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.249 
going to move up here into this hallway
as<00:01:21.000> you'll<00:01:21.270> see<00:01:21.479> in<00:01:21.540> a<00:01:21.630> moment<00:01:21.780> like<00:01:22.080> all<00:01:22.229> I

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
as you'll see in a moment like all I

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.340 
as you'll see in a moment like all I
could<00:01:22.380> think<00:01:22.500> of<00:01:22.680> oh<00:01:22.860> my<00:01:23.130> god<00:01:23.869> 181<00:01:24.869> Nate<00:01:25.140> and

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
could think of oh my god 181 Nate and

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.230 
could think of oh my god 181 Nate and
somebody<00:01:25.650> gets<00:01:25.830> a<00:01:25.920> six-man<00:01:26.400> kill<00:01:26.729> right<00:01:26.970> here

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
somebody gets a six-man kill right here

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.840 
somebody gets a six-man kill right here
so<00:01:28.110> I<00:01:28.140> take<00:01:28.380> a<00:01:28.439> couple<00:01:28.710> shots<00:01:28.829> there<00:01:29.310> I<00:01:29.520> back

gun<00:03:29.579> so<00:03:29.910> in<00:03:30.900> theory<00:03:31.260> i'm<00:03:31.470> thinking<00:03:31.859> this

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
gun so in theory i'm thinking this

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.880 
gun so in theory i'm thinking this
should<00:03:32.160> be<00:03:32.340> a<00:03:32.370> suitable<00:03:32.880> position<00:03:33.180> to<00:03:33.890> lay

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
should be a suitable position to lay

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:38.060 
should be a suitable position to lay
down<00:03:34.920> this<00:03:35.340> fire<00:03:35.640> to<00:03:35.940> try<00:03:36.480> to<00:03:36.590> talk<00:03:37.590> them<00:03:37.859> out

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070 
down this fire to try to talk them out

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:41.000 
down this fire to try to talk them out
of<00:03:38.130> advancing<00:03:38.880> into<00:03:39.090> this<00:03:39.209> mcom<00:03:39.660> and<00:03:40.010> sure

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
of advancing into this mcom and sure

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.860 
of advancing into this mcom and sure
enough<00:03:41.040> this<00:03:41.400> seemed<00:03:41.579> like<00:03:41.609> a<00:03:41.870> spectacular

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
enough this seemed like a spectacular

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:44.900 
enough this seemed like a spectacular
spot<00:03:43.200> here<00:03:43.440> as<00:03:43.590> you'll<00:03:43.769> stop<00:03:44.190> we<00:03:44.519> begin<00:03:44.730> to<00:03:44.850> see

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
spot here as you'll stop we begin to see

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:49.859 
away now the building facade didn't

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:51.400 
away now the building facade didn't
start<00:03:50.100> to<00:03:50.190> crumble<00:03:50.400> there<00:03:50.670> on<00:03:50.760> the<00:03:50.850> outside

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
I'm trying to get a good angle here that

I'm trying to get a good angle here that
the<00:04:02.519> bipod<00:04:03.090> deployed<00:04:03.480> there<00:04:03.720> but<00:04:03.840> I<00:04:03.900> wasn't

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:04.109 
the bipod deployed there but I wasn't

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:05.270 
the bipod deployed there but I wasn't
quite<00:04:04.380> sure<00:04:04.470> if<00:04:04.680> that<00:04:04.889> would<00:04:04.950> give<00:04:05.130> me<00:04:05.220> the

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
quite sure if that would give me the

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.330 
quite sure if that would give me the
range<00:04:05.940> of<00:04:06.239> motion<00:04:06.480> that<00:04:06.690> I<00:04:06.840> wanted<00:04:07.280> taking<00:04:08.280> a

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
range of motion that I wanted taking a

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:09.800 
range of motion that I wanted taking a
peek<00:04:08.549> here<00:04:08.580> we<00:04:08.879> do<00:04:09.000> got<00:04:09.150> people<00:04:09.450> moving<00:04:09.480> up

off<00:04:11.670> the<00:04:11.879> approach

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:13.200 
off the approach

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.460 
off the approach
and<00:04:13.650> this<00:04:13.770> one<00:04:13.950> should<00:04:14.160> be<00:04:14.190> in<00:04:14.340> the<00:04:14.400> bag<00:04:14.580> for<00:04:14.819> us

death trap I heard the rumbling of a
tank<00:04:23.820> I<00:04:24.000> didn't<00:04:24.540> want<00:04:24.660> to<00:04:24.690> get<00:04:24.810> shot<00:04:24.840> by<00:04:25.169> the

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:26.990 
tank so I didn't look at it and spot it

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:29.659 
tank so I didn't look at it and spot it
as<00:04:27.990> a<00:04:28.050> support<00:04:28.620> I've<00:04:28.770> got<00:04:28.950> nothing<00:04:29.100> for<00:04:29.490> but
