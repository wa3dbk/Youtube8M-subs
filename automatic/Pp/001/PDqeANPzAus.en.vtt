space my tissue paper about two inches
apart<00:01:13.580> and<00:01:18.910> then<00:01:19.910> you<00:01:20.090> just<00:01:20.330> keep<00:01:20.510> going

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 
apart and then you just keep going

apart and then you just keep going
I<00:01:21.140> applied<00:01:21.770> two<00:01:22.100> pieces<00:01:22.520> of<00:01:22.670> a<00:01:22.760> darker<00:01:23.060> pink

I applied two pieces of a darker pink
side<00:01:23.570> by<00:01:23.720> side<00:01:24.020> all<00:01:24.500> by<00:01:24.830> two<00:01:24.890> pieces<00:01:25.460> of<00:01:25.580> the

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
side by side all by two pieces of the

side by side all by two pieces of the
lighter<00:01:25.880> pink<00:01:26.180> doubling<00:01:27.170> up<00:01:27.290> like<00:01:27.530> this<00:01:27.740> will

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:28.160 
lighter pink doubling up like this will

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:29.860 
lighter pink doubling up like this will
help<00:01:28.370> the<00:01:28.490> color<00:01:28.700> stand<00:01:29.090> out<00:01:29.360> more<00:01:29.570> when<00:01:29.750> it's

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:29.870 
help the color stand out more when it's

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:34.960 
help the color stand out more when it's
finished<00:01:30.229> especially<00:01:30.890> a<00:01:31.040> lighter<00:01:31.340> shade<00:01:33.970> when

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:34.970 
finished especially a lighter shade when

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.030 
finished especially a lighter shade when
applying<00:01:35.330> the<00:01:35.600> glue<00:01:35.810> the<00:01:36.170> thinner<00:01:36.410> layer

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040 
applying the glue the thinner layer

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.310 
applying the glue the thinner layer
the<00:01:37.160> better<00:01:37.370> if<00:01:37.700> you<00:01:38.210> apply<00:01:38.479> too<00:01:38.540> much<00:01:38.780> the

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 
the better if you apply too much the

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:40.870 
the better if you apply too much the
glue<00:01:39.530> will<00:01:39.740> seep<00:01:40.009> through<00:01:40.220> the<00:01:40.250> tissue<00:01:40.520> and

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
glue will seep through the tissue and

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:47.350 
glue will seep through the tissue and
stick<00:01:41.479> to<00:01:41.660> the<00:01:41.780> water<00:01:41.990> bottle<00:01:46.150> this<00:01:47.150> is<00:01:47.210> a

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 
stick to the water bottle this is a

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:48.760 
stick to the water bottle this is a
really<00:01:47.690> simple<00:01:48.050> project

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:48.770 
really simple project

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.609 
really simple project
it's<00:01:48.890> just<00:01:49.310> extremely<00:01:50.030> tedious<00:01:50.390> it<00:01:50.840> took<00:01:51.470> me

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:51.619 
it's just extremely tedious it took me

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:54.430 
it's just extremely tedious it took me
about<00:01:51.800> an<00:01:51.950> hour<00:01:52.009> to<00:01:52.340> do<00:01:52.670> one<00:01:52.910> board<00:01:53.240> I<00:01:53.509> suggest

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:54.440 
about an hour to do one board I suggest

00:01:54.440 --> 00:02:10.460 
about an hour to do one board I suggest
doing<00:01:54.530> it<00:01:54.890> while<00:01:55.130> binge<00:01:55.550> watching
