00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.870
 on May 29, 2009 a remarkable date 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:09.690
 for Rogerio was run over by a 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.330
 inebriated citizen 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.759
 and then I was quadriplegic one day to 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:18.060
 the other the production leader who loved 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:21.180
 working without being moved went 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.430
 need help even to feed 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.369
 a simple act as if covering the night 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.980
 for example it became impossible 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:32.160
 another year passed and rogério was 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.380
 presented to a new possibility a 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.320
 surgery that promised improvement 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.370
 considerable movement of arms and 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.100
 hands 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.440
 I promised amp b a preview two years later 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.260
 the treatment results are 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.739
 awesome possible food 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.840
 alone picking up a cookie 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:53.940
 taking the remote control of the 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:57.660
 video tape recorder with you 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:00.629
 turn off and on the electric light itself 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.579
 I can now turn on and off with the 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.070
 finger movements right 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.920
 the treatment was developed by two 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.500
 doctor neurosurgeons doctor 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.200
 jaime btl from florianópolis and doctor 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.450
 ghizoni shark marks today 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.729
 Our Lady of the Conception hospital is 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.040
 unique in the world where surgery is 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.409
 the new technique has already been 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.750
 published in scientific journals of the 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.610
 United States and has been recognized 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.670
 by experts as an important 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.409
 discovered the positive results 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.960
 proud of one of the parents of the 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.630
 surgical treatment a northern survey 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.820
 revealed that 88 per cent of the 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.759
 paralyzed patients has as 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.070
 move hands 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.049
 the new technique enables the return of 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.780
 some movements that seem simple 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.820
 but are extremely important after 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.860
 these surgeries of transference of 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:56.070
 nervous your hand did not go back to normal 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.590
 but it greatly improves then the person who 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.750
 had no capacity to take anything and 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.340
 after one of two years she can 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.469
 grab a cookie you can pick up the 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.869
 table and can feed itself the 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:08.819
 time to operate the two arms is 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.950
 four to five hours 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.280
 Ideally, the patient underwent 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.130
 maximum treatment 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.800
 one year after the accident the process is 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:20.830
 slow and results start to appear 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.750
 on average two years after the intervention 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:25.390
 twelve people have passed through 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:28.090
 procedure that is done by the sus 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.520
 surgery is of high complexity but 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.080
 Doctor Jaime can define there a 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.550
 very simple way 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.459
 people then have to think about the 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:39.040
 black as the electric path where the 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:40.660
 thought arrives so I will think that I 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:44.140
 I want to get my arm but my thoughts 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:46.120
 arrive in the form of electricity until the 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.920
 muscle that goes against the iii goes 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.180
 push my arm and I need a 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.720
 electrical wiring 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:55.750
 then these electrical wirings that we 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:58.180
 We change the addresses and then the 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.100
 readapt if to speak one 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.500
 popular language he was going to say that I 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:06.030
 would be making a cat for example a 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.030
 electrical connection and other 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:14.030
 the cimed the ball is well that god poll 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:27.290
 will not even thiago snows want to 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:27.290
 best show little citizen 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:36.190
 educate if this team
