along with a microphone port something

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.219 
along with a microphone port something
very<00:01:50.130> interesting<00:01:50.369> is<00:01:50.759> on<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.299> red<00:01:51.540> your

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
very interesting is on the red your

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.980 
very interesting is on the red your
power<00:01:52.920> /<00:01:53.430> sleep/wake<00:01:54.030> button<00:01:54.060> is<00:01:54.600> actually<00:01:54.930> on

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
power / sleep/wake button is actually on

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.649 
power / sleep/wake button is actually on
the<00:01:55.049> right<00:01:55.320> hand<00:01:55.530> side<00:01:55.680> of<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.070> smartphone

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:56.659 
the right hand side of the smartphone

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:58.819 
the right hand side of the smartphone
and<00:01:57.659> i'm<00:01:57.810> assuming<00:01:58.049> this<00:01:58.290> is<00:01:58.439> going<00:01:58.619> to<00:01:58.710> be<00:01:58.799> a

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
and i'm assuming this is going to be a

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.520 
and i'm assuming this is going to be a
small<00:01:59.329> screen<00:02:00.329> smartphone<00:02:00.899> as<00:02:01.049> well<00:02:01.229> which<00:02:01.500> is

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
small screen smartphone as well which is

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.560 
small screen smartphone as well which is
why<00:02:01.649> it's<00:02:02.009> very<00:02:02.219> interesting<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:03.149> Samsung

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
why it's very interesting the Samsung

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.330 
why it's very interesting the Samsung
didn't<00:02:03.840> put<00:02:03.960> it<00:02:04.049> on<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.229> on<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:04.619> top<00:02:04.979> but<00:02:05.310> I

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
didn't put it on the on the top but I

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.030 
didn't put it on the on the top but I
guess<00:02:05.780> this<00:02:06.780> is<00:02:06.930> just<00:02:06.960> synergizing<00:02:07.740> with<00:02:07.890> all

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:08.040 
guess this is just synergizing with all

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:10.100 
guess this is just synergizing with all
smartphones<00:02:08.640> all<00:02:09.179> samsung<00:02:09.690> smartphones

that<00:02:21.129> this<00:02:21.610> camera<00:02:22.000> could<00:02:22.239> actually<00:02:22.420> be<00:02:22.870> a

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
that this camera could actually be a

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.860 
that this camera could actually be a
high<00:02:23.560> megapixel<00:02:23.829> count<00:02:24.370> camera<00:02:24.700> just<00:02:24.909> by<00:02:25.209> just

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
high megapixel count camera just by just

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.600 
high megapixel count camera just by just
the<00:02:25.930> way<00:02:26.140> that<00:02:26.349> it<00:02:26.409> bulges<00:02:27.040> out<00:02:27.280> of<00:02:27.519> the

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
the way that it bulges out of the
