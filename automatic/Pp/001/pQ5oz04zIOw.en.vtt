around<00:00:29.609> timber<00:00:30.210> structure<00:00:30.689> we<00:00:31.140> are<00:00:31.170> actually

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
around timber structure we are actually

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.170 
around timber structure we are actually
vertically<00:00:32.130> jigging<00:00:32.430> these<00:00:32.579> against<00:00:33.059> the

though<00:00:35.280> when<00:00:35.880> they're<00:00:36.030> finding<00:00:36.239> fish

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
though when they're finding fish

schooled<00:00:36.960> up<00:00:37.140> deeper<00:00:37.559> down<00:00:37.739> and<00:00:38.010> I'll

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
schooled up deeper down and I'll

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.910 
schooled up deeper down and I'll
actually<00:00:39.000> vertically<00:00:39.660> jig<00:00:39.840> these<00:00:40.050> into<00:00:40.770> those

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
actually vertically jig these into those

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.650 
actually vertically jig these into those
schools<00:00:41.280> that<00:00:41.370> are<00:00:41.550> holding<00:00:41.730> mid<00:00:42.059> water<00:00:42.270> or

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
schools that are holding mid water or

towards<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.260> bottom<00:00:43.410> in<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:43.890> deeper

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
towards the bottom in the deeper

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.490 
towards the bottom in the deeper
impoundments<00:00:44.910> so<00:00:45.690> let's<00:00:45.899> show<00:00:46.110> you<00:00:46.170> how<00:00:46.230> it

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
impoundments so let's show you how it

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.430 
impoundments so let's show you how it
works<00:00:47.180> basically<00:00:48.180> all<00:00:48.570> we<00:00:48.750> will<00:00:48.899> be<00:00:49.020> doing<00:00:49.200> is

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
works basically all we will be doing is

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.709 
works basically all we will be doing is
if<00:00:49.559> we're<00:00:49.710> in<00:00:49.800> a<00:00:49.829> boat<00:00:50.039> we'd<00:00:50.940> sound<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.480> school

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
if we're in a boat we'd sound the school

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.290 
if we're in a boat we'd sound the school
of<00:00:51.870> fish<00:00:52.050> I<00:00:52.320> just<00:00:53.039> open<00:00:53.399> up<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.670> bail<00:00:53.879> and<00:00:54.210> I'd

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
of fish I just open up the bail and I'd

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.660 
of fish I just open up the bail and I'd
vertically<00:00:54.809> drop<00:00:55.050> this<00:00:55.260> down<00:00:55.559> drop<00:00:56.460> it<00:00:56.489> all

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
vertically drop this down drop it all

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.849 
vertically drop this down drop it all
the<00:00:56.760> way<00:00:56.850> to<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:57.149> bottom<00:00:57.329> soon<00:00:58.079> as<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.440> braid

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
the way to the bottom soon as the braid

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.400 
the way to the bottom soon as the braid
goes<00:00:59.399> slack<00:00:59.760> you'll<00:01:00.510> see<00:01:00.690> it<00:01:00.840> goes<00:01:00.960> slack<00:01:01.260> you

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
goes slack you'll see it goes slack you

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.200 
goes slack you'll see it goes slack you
know<00:01:01.440> that<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.829> lures<00:01:02.070> hit<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.340> bottom<00:01:02.640> I'm

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
know that the lures hit the bottom I'm

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.880 
know that the lures hit the bottom I'm
gonna<00:01:03.390> pick<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.719> slack<00:01:03.930> up<00:01:04.110> all<00:01:04.589> I'm<00:01:04.739> simply

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
gonna pick the slack up all I'm simply

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.500 
gonna pick the slack up all I'm simply
going<00:01:05.100> to<00:01:05.159> do<00:01:05.309> is<00:01:05.369> just<00:01:05.549> lift<00:01:05.729> it<00:01:05.909> in<00:01:06.090> a<00:01:06.270> very

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
going to do is just lift it in a very

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.899 
going to do is just lift it in a very
small<00:01:06.840> hop<00:01:07.110> and<00:01:07.350> when<00:01:08.100> you<00:01:08.220> hop<00:01:08.400> it<00:01:08.610> as<00:01:08.850> a

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
small hop and when you hop it as a

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.300 
small hop and when you hop it as a
citizen<00:01:09.600> explained<00:01:10.320> before<00:01:10.710> their<00:01:11.040> design

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
citizen explained before their design

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.770 
citizen explained before their design
sufficiently<00:01:11.909> nice<00:01:12.090> so<00:01:12.360> what<00:01:12.540> it<00:01:12.630> actually

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
sufficiently nice so what it actually

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.840 
sufficiently nice so what it actually
does<00:01:13.049> is<00:01:13.260> each<00:01:13.380> time<00:01:13.409> you<00:01:13.770> hop<00:01:13.920> it<00:01:14.159> it<00:01:14.640> goes

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
does is each time you hop it it goes

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.210 
does is each time you hop it it goes
around<00:01:15.119> in<00:01:15.299> a<00:01:15.390> circular<00:01:15.630> motion<00:01:16.220> basically

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
around in a circular motion basically

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.350 
around in a circular motion basically
anti-clockwise<00:01:18.119> so<00:01:18.890> as<00:01:19.890> I<00:01:20.009> dig<00:01:20.280> this<00:01:20.430> I'm<00:01:20.700> not

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
anti-clockwise so as I dig this I'm not

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.289 
anti-clockwise so as I dig this I'm not
forcing<00:01:21.750> it<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.380> jig<00:01:22.560> itself<00:01:22.920> will<00:01:23.850> go<00:01:24.060> around

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
forcing it the jig itself will go around

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.929 
forcing it the jig itself will go around
in<00:01:24.630> a<00:01:24.689> circular<00:01:24.930> motion<00:01:25.610> you're<00:01:26.610> generally

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
in a circular motion you're generally

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.760 
in a circular motion you're generally
going<00:01:27.090> to<00:01:27.150> fish<00:01:27.299> them<00:01:27.509> in<00:01:27.630> waters<00:01:28.140> more<00:01:28.560> than

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
going to fish them in waters more than

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.560 
going to fish them in waters more than
five<00:01:29.040> meters<00:01:29.340> so<00:01:29.909> it's<00:01:30.030> not<00:01:30.180> something<00:01:30.479> you're

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
five meters so it's not something you're

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.359 
five meters so it's not something you're
gonna<00:01:30.689> be<00:01:30.810> using<00:01:30.930> in<00:01:31.200> shallower<00:01:31.590> water<00:01:31.710> they

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
gonna be using in shallower water they

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.510 
gonna be using in shallower water they
are<00:01:32.400> quite<00:01:32.820> heavy<00:01:33.060> they<00:01:33.240> weigh<00:01:33.360> 23<00:01:33.930> gram<00:01:34.170> you

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
are quite heavy they weigh 23 gram you

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.160 
are quite heavy they weigh 23 gram you
only<00:01:35.520> need<00:01:35.729> to<00:01:35.820> lift<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.090> rod<00:01:36.240> tip<00:01:36.479> an<00:01:36.630> inch

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
only need to lift the rod tip an inch

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.260 
only need to lift the rod tip an inch
and<00:01:37.380> a<00:01:37.409> half<00:01:37.439> two<00:01:37.920> inches<00:01:37.950> maximum<00:01:38.670> a<00:01:38.939> lot<00:01:39.180> of

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
and a half two inches maximum a lot of

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.060 
and a half two inches maximum a lot of
guys<00:01:39.390> have<00:01:39.570> intensity<00:01:39.900> they<00:01:40.049> rip<00:01:40.229> it<00:01:40.380> rip<00:01:40.890> at

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
guys have intensity they rip it rip at
