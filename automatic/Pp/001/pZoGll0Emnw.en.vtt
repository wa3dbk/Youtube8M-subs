it's<00:00:53.879> pretty<00:00:54.059> thin<00:00:54.300> but<00:00:55.020> it's<00:00:55.140> large<00:00:55.440> so<00:00:55.920> you

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
it's pretty thin but it's large so you

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:02.139

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:02.149 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:06.710 

and<00:01:03.149> all<00:01:03.329> this<00:01:03.510> has<00:01:03.750> is<00:01:04.110> a<00:01:05.010> micro<00:01:05.670> USB<00:01:05.700> port<00:01:06.119> in

and all this has is a micro USB port in
the<00:01:06.780> cable<00:01:07.110> and<00:01:07.409> then<00:01:08.100> a<00:01:08.340> light<00:01:08.729> here<00:01:09.210> that

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
the cable and then a light here that

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.660 
the cable and then a light here that
lights<00:01:09.689> up<00:01:09.869> and<00:01:10.159> once<00:01:11.159> it's<00:01:11.369> made<00:01:11.490> in

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
lights up and once it's made in

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.640 
lights up and once it's made in
connection<00:01:11.790> with<00:01:12.240> one<00:01:12.750> of<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:13.049> Qi<00:01:13.380> wireless

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
connection with one of the Qi wireless

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.820 
connection with one of the Qi wireless
charging<00:01:13.950> cards<00:01:14.670> or<00:01:14.820> phones<00:01:15.170> then<00:01:16.170> it<00:01:16.439> turns<00:01:16.680> a

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
charging cards or phones then it turns a

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.010 
charging cards or phones then it turns a
different<00:01:17.130> color<00:01:17.280> goes<00:01:17.610> from<00:01:17.790> like<00:01:18.570> a<00:01:18.600> purple

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
different color goes from like a purple

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.450 
different color goes from like a purple
to<00:01:19.170> a<00:01:19.200> green<00:01:19.500> so<00:01:20.159> it's<00:01:20.430> easy<00:01:20.820> for<00:01:21.090> that<00:01:22.460> they

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
to a green so it's easy for that they

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:29.390 
to a green so it's easy for that they
also<00:01:23.610> send<00:01:24.060> along<00:01:24.299> a<00:01:26.479> stopper<00:01:27.560> so<00:01:28.560> you<00:01:29.159> can<00:01:29.310> put

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
also send along a stopper so you can put

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.219 
also send along a stopper so you can put
that<00:01:29.549> in<00:01:29.610> your<00:01:29.729> micro<00:01:30.030> USB<00:01:30.450> port<00:01:30.479> since<00:01:31.079> you

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
that in your micro USB port since you

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.510 
that in your micro USB port since you
will<00:01:31.320> be<00:01:31.380> using<00:01:31.650> that<00:01:31.829> to<00:01:32.009> charge<00:01:32.220> your<00:01:32.340> phone

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
will be using that to charge your phone

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.580 
will be using that to charge your phone
any<00:01:32.759> longer<00:01:33.030> now<00:01:33.720> what's<00:01:33.930> nice<00:01:34.110> about<00:01:34.170> this

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
any longer now what's nice about this

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.700 
any longer now what's nice about this
model<00:01:35.009> it's<00:01:35.189> a<00:01:35.250> high-efficiency<00:01:35.729> version<00:01:36.420> and

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
model it's a high-efficiency version and

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.580 
model it's a high-efficiency version and
what<00:01:37.710> they<00:01:37.890> allow<00:01:38.220> you<00:01:38.280> to<00:01:38.430> do<00:01:38.759> is<00:01:39.470> plug<00:01:40.470> it

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
what they allow you to do is plug it

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.850 
what they allow you to do is plug it
into<00:01:40.740> any<00:01:41.009> powered<00:01:41.549> USB<00:01:41.759> port<00:01:42.420> that<00:01:42.930> has<00:01:43.200> 500

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
into any powered USB port that has 500

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.219 
into any powered USB port that has 500
milliamps<00:01:44.159> all<00:01:44.939> the<00:01:45.119> way<00:01:45.210> up<00:01:45.299> to<00:01:45.329> 20<00:01:45.750> 100

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
milliamps all the way up to 20 100

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.460 
milliamps all the way up to 20 100
milliamps<00:01:46.740> so<00:01:47.700> this<00:01:48.240> actually<00:01:48.479> outputs<00:01:49.229> a

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
milliamps so this actually outputs a

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.749 
milliamps so this actually outputs a
certain<00:01:50.430> level<00:01:50.610> of<00:01:50.790> charge<00:01:51.170> which<00:01:52.170> is<00:01:52.759> a

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
certain level of charge which is a

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.810 
certain level of charge which is a
standard<00:01:54.299> amount<00:01:55.020> it's<00:01:55.979> at<00:01:56.130> seventy<00:01:56.610> four

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
standard amount it's at seventy four

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.330 
standard amount it's at seventy four
point<00:01:57.090> six<00:01:57.360> percent<00:01:57.899> at<00:01:58.110> a<00:01:58.170> thousand<00:01:59.130> milliamp

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
point six percent at a thousand milliamp

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.300 
point six percent at a thousand milliamp
so<00:01:59.729> if<00:02:00.030> you<00:02:00.540> use<00:02:00.689> a<00:02:00.719> standard<00:02:01.110> USB<00:02:01.619> charger

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
so if you use a standard USB charger

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.370 
so if you use a standard USB charger
then<00:02:02.939> you<00:02:03.119> will<00:02:03.240> get<00:02:03.390> the<00:02:03.600> highest<00:02:03.840> efficiency

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
then you will get the highest efficiency

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.789 
then you will get the highest efficiency
possible<00:02:04.740> from<00:02:05.250> this<00:02:05.399> device<00:02:06.229> it<00:02:07.229> works<00:02:07.500> for

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
possible from this device it works for

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:12.920 
possible from this device it works for
