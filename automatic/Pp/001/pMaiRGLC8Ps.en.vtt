00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:12.030
 hello youtubers sniper tour welcome in 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.830
 this brand new video one of the few 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.830
 times when I was happy to 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.810
 wait to make a news video on a 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.029
 title battlefield because then 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.070
 first I explain to you how it went 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.630
 evening around home from the event of 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.920
 walsh gives what happens in Milan 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.109
 that I find myself a worse fan than it is 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.510
 call battlefield hardline at that point 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.969
 as I think many of you have seen the 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.850
 video that published level cap gaming 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.739
 but I have some news in fact more to give 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.230
 I told you it was fortunate to wait 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.090
 battlefield arline because it could 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.620
 be true because it may not be 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.899
 a troll thing I thought at first 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.539
 this information could arise 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.460
 directly from inside the battlelog 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.100
 of battlefield 4 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:56.160
 I don't know for what absurd reason they are 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.079
 been found by this user again 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.550
 it could be a fake but we do 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.940
 pretend it's true because actually 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.470
 everything makes it think beyond the new 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.260
 graphic of the writing I want to show you 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.659
 the first hypothetical battlefield map 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.810
 arline and you see there is urban call 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.560
 a highway there is a truck a train in 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.220
 flames 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.140
 and unless none of you acknowledge of 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.210
 one part as belonging to another 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.830
 video game this map say that 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.509
 actually it's not a fake 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.909
 because this is the render among others 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.600
 nice enough of a map of a 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.450
 video game 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.549
 and it's a video game that I don't think of 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.520
 having seen battlefield lines so far 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:38.490
 police theme thieves against cops 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.939
 the classes will be the assault that will be the 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.060
 doctor 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:44.189
 the report will be the specialist class 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.409
 that in this case that of 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:49.470
 sniper and there will be the mechanical class 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.899
 instead of engineer but will do the same 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.640
 something like that in bf 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.340
 basically to repair vehicles and 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.869
 support from a engineer see this 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.070
 unpublished image has been published 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.830
 a few minutes ago 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.570
 a shade with a palace of a 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:07.540
 bank and a parked helicopter 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:10.390
 above helicopter we find also 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:12.370
 in the hypothetical list of vehicles that 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.459
 that is, there could be two helicopters 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:17.830
 of the police to transport helicopters 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:20.410
 of cars with sirens 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.570
 above they seem therefore made to do 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:26.020
 chases there are trucks there are 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:29.590
 of armored vehicles with heavy machine guns 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:31.630
 above the roof there are civilian cars 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.160
 there are bikes that look like a one 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.810
 motorcycle the police the other the civil motorcycle 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.730
 there is the classic thieves' van 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.130
 bastards so let's go and see 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.830
 immediately other information that is 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.090
 unlock the hypothetical medals there 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.000
 may be in this game that 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:50.050
 all refer to guards actions and 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.670
 thieves weapons skulls ropes money all 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:53.050
 what you can find inside 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.030
 a robbery 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:57.430
 another unpublished image that has not been 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:00.550
 shown in the videos released last night is 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:02.709
 that of possible specializations 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:04.180
 as for the vehicles there are 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:05.950
 two black spheres that I really don't 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:09.250
 I can identify but for the rest 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:12.910
 we have a dissipation fan that 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:14.920
 I don't know what it's for if there's a block that 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.299
 looks like a surveillance camera from 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.310
 apply keys to the vehicle 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:21.790
 British heavy machine guns 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:23.200
 of other antennas of cameras 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:25.390
 in short, there are objects that 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.220
 all will in theory be put on 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:30.370
 our vehicle there is also a fire extinguisher is 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:31.660
 you see a smoke bomb up there at 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:33.940
 right 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.650
 Now let's go ahead because we see others 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.650
 images related to this game 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:41.049
 in fact, regarding weapons we see an ak 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.890
 47 with a very very much charger 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:44.680
 long 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:46.989
 a ballistic shield a bat from 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.850
 explosive baseball a syringe 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:49.600
 proceeds with adrenaline that can give you 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:51.370
 a little more energy 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:54.100
 in game to run faster jump 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:56.950
 faster I do n't know better reflexes cis 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:58.980
 there is a camera of those liszt 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:01.690
 hemispherical that can move 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.580
 so I think it's a function suitable for 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:07.330
 cops there are rocket launchers the g 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:10.480
 36 c is the smoke bomb there is a grappling hook for 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:13.750
 go probably to climb on 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:15.070
 grenade roofs m 67 the gun 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:18.790
 the two guns that should be one 

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:21.070
 compact is a m9 lusi that is cool 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:24.520
 tamarrissima the bayonet other grenades 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:26.230
 short, taser tits there's the crossbow ball 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:29.830
 and modern crossbow for barrel guns 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:33.700
 there is so much meat on the fire 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:35.230
 now I express a quick judgment when 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:37.570
 while I show you the sights that 

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:38.740
 will be more or less the sights and expectations 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:41.500
 canteen weapon that can be found 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:43.090
 within a fps game and therefore not 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.380
 we will comment on them here 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:46.150
 let's just see let's reason for a moment 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:48.670
 about what this game could be 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:51.310
 nice ugly to buy no from the guys 

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:53.890
 first of all it is developed by visceral 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:55.300
 because there is another image that I don't have 

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:57.160
 I didn't post you in this video but that 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.990
 it would have been found in the same 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:02.530
 folder bearing the logo of 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:04.090
 visceral games then a new house that 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:06.520
 obviously he did the dead series 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:08.650
 space that was very well taken care of in the 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:10.840
 history in detail in the graphic io 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:11.590
 I hope it's a title of as much 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.090
 importance 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:14.790
 a title that at this point that 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:17.350
 advantage would have compared to a 

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:19.120
 standard battlefield that is first of all 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:22.720
 ours was calmly developed 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:24.940
 unbeknownst that could present 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:26.380
 very very alternative entertainment 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:29.170
 compared to those that are in a 

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:32.659
 game as a war-style battlefield 

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:35.310
 that is, imagine robberies 

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:37.530
 maybe even the possibility of arresting 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:38.430
 thieves capture them instead of killing them 

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:41.249
 send them to jail 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:43.349
 therefore also a rpg component 

00:05:41.249 --> 00:05:45.270
 within the game where you expat e 

00:05:43.349 --> 00:05:47.819
 your figure of policemen in short 

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:49.590
 it seems to me that if it really is a fps 

00:05:47.819 --> 00:05:52.099
 how it should be could be 

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:54.389
 something really alternative e 

00:05:52.099 --> 00:05:56.099
 interesting it does not surprise me that on 

00:05:54.389 --> 00:05:57.930
 frostbite that should be the engine 

00:05:56.099 --> 00:06:00.180
 used to make this game are 

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:02.069
 through the ct and trying to improve 

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:03.419
 the netcode because if it were a 

00:06:02.069 --> 00:06:05.819
 so urban play would be 

00:06:03.419 --> 00:06:10.139
 very important to have a hit the show 

00:06:05.819 --> 00:06:12.509
 very very very precise I am 

00:06:10.139 --> 00:06:14.340
 positive and a battlefield title I saw 

00:06:12.509 --> 00:06:17.099
 what now that I'll treat him with this 

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:20.009
 Playlists will cover all news roads 

00:06:17.099 --> 00:06:22.349
 to battlefield hardline I assure you that 

00:06:20.009 --> 00:06:25.469
 I will always keep you updated about it 

00:06:22.349 --> 00:06:27.000
 this new chapter with name beats the 

00:06:25.469 --> 00:06:29.610
 movie I remember is a spin off and 

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.650
 could distract us all for 

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:34.139
 now I would say we keep our fingers but 

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:35.999
 above all write down what it is 

00:06:34.139 --> 00:06:38.310
 think about what your fears are 

00:06:35.999 --> 00:06:40.770
 are your hopes see you in the 

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:43.490
 next video commented if you want
