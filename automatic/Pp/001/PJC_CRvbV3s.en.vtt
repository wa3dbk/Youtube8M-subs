actually also interviewed in the secret

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.990 
actually also interviewed in the secret
DVD<00:02:06.780> so<00:02:07.320> that's<00:02:07.740> where<00:02:07.950> I<00:02:07.979> know<00:02:08.129> him<00:02:08.459> from<00:02:08.670> and

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
DVD so that's where I know him from and

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.969 
DVD so that's where I know him from and
this<00:02:09.569> is<00:02:09.750> I<00:02:09.869> think<00:02:09.929> one<00:02:10.200> of<00:02:10.229> his<00:02:10.410> fewer<00:02:10.679> books

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
this is I think one of his fewer books

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.530 
this is I think one of his fewer books
so<00:02:11.160> I<00:02:11.190> picked<00:02:11.550> this<00:02:11.700> up<00:02:11.849> and<00:02:12.030> i<00:02:12.090> just<00:02:12.300> recently

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540

started
it<00:02:13.450> and<00:02:13.600> it's<00:02:14.260> a<00:02:14.500> lot<00:02:14.950> thicker<00:02:15.250> than<00:02:15.580> most

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
it and it's a lot thicker than most

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
it and it's a lot thicker than most
other<00:02:16.840> ones<00:02:17.110> so<00:02:17.350> I'm<00:02:17.770> their<00:02:18.720> small<00:02:19.720> chapters

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
though they're like short chapters that

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.020 
though they're like short chapters that
you<00:02:22.420> can<00:02:22.600> read<00:02:22.870> individually<00:02:23.860> but<00:02:24.040> I<00:02:24.100> just

00:05:51.629 --> 00:05:51.639

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:53.800 
speaking a lot more clearly because

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:56.249 
speaking a lot more clearly because
she's<00:05:54.190> hearing<00:05:54.550> you<00:05:55.270> know<00:05:55.389> how<00:05:55.780> the<00:05:55.840> audio

00:05:56.249 --> 00:05:56.259 
she's hearing you know how the audio

00:05:56.259 --> 00:05:58.589 
she's hearing you know how the audio
books<00:05:56.500> there's<00:05:56.800> usually<00:05:57.070> a<00:05:57.490> man<00:05:57.789> speaking

00:05:58.589 --> 00:05:58.599 
books there's usually a man speaking

00:05:58.599 --> 00:06:02.070 
books there's usually a man speaking
very<00:05:58.840> very<00:05:59.139> clear<00:05:59.620> like<00:06:00.300> accent<00:06:01.300> free<00:06:01.539> English

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:02.080 
very very clear like accent free English

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:04.529 
very very clear like accent free English
and<00:06:02.349> so<00:06:02.650> I've<00:06:03.039> noticed<00:06:03.580> that<00:06:03.669> her<00:06:03.909> words<00:06:04.240> have

00:06:04.529 --> 00:06:04.539 
and so I've noticed that her words have

00:06:04.539 --> 00:06:06.779 
and so I've noticed that her words have
gotten<00:06:04.780> a<00:06:04.810> lot<00:06:04.990> more<00:06:05.050> clear<00:06:05.590> since<00:06:06.039> she's<00:06:06.759> been

00:06:06.779 --> 00:06:06.789 
gotten a lot more clear since she's been

00:06:06.789 --> 00:06:09.149 
gotten a lot more clear since she's been
hearing<00:06:07.659> the<00:06:07.930> audio<00:06:07.960> books<00:06:08.530> going<00:06:08.860> all<00:06:09.009> the

00:06:09.149 --> 00:06:09.159 
hearing the audio books going all the

00:06:09.159 --> 00:06:11.939 
hearing the audio books going all the
time<00:06:09.190> so<00:06:09.789> I<00:06:10.060> know<00:06:10.900> I<00:06:11.050> think<00:06:11.139> it<00:06:11.469> helps<00:06:11.620> your

00:06:11.939 --> 00:06:11.949 
time so I know I think it helps your

00:06:11.949 --> 00:06:13.740 
time so I know I think it helps your
kids<00:06:12.219> with<00:06:12.430> speech<00:06:12.699> to<00:06:12.969> their<00:06:13.150> listening<00:06:13.479> and

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:13.750 
kids with speech to their listening and

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:16.140 
kids with speech to their listening and
also<00:06:14.110> if<00:06:14.380> they<00:06:14.500> do<00:06:14.560> end<00:06:14.949> up<00:06:15.070> hearing<00:06:15.370> part<00:06:16.060> of

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:16.150 
also if they do end up hearing part of

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:18.120 
also if they do end up hearing part of
an<00:06:16.210> audiobook<00:06:16.509> I<00:06:16.810> I<00:06:16.840> know<00:06:17.139> Armand<00:06:17.620> and<00:06:17.830> I<00:06:17.860> have

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:18.130 
an audiobook I I know Armand and I have

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:20.129 
an audiobook I I know Armand and I have
sparked<00:06:18.550> up<00:06:18.699> so<00:06:18.909> many<00:06:19.060> conversations<00:06:19.479> because

00:06:20.129 --> 00:06:20.139 
sparked up so many conversations because

00:06:20.139 --> 00:06:21.629 
sparked up so many conversations because
even<00:06:20.650> though<00:06:20.740> the<00:06:20.830> books<00:06:21.009> I'm<00:06:21.190> listening<00:06:21.520> to

00:06:21.629 --> 00:06:21.639 
even though the books I'm listening to

00:06:21.639 --> 00:06:24.570 
even though the books I'm listening to
our<00:06:21.789> meant<00:06:22.060> for<00:06:22.389> grownups<00:06:22.990> some<00:06:23.919> often<00:06:24.340> times

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:24.580 
our meant for grownups some often times

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:26.969 
our meant for grownups some often times
like<00:06:24.849> well<00:06:25.419> he'll<00:06:26.080> hear<00:06:26.320> part<00:06:26.590> of<00:06:26.710> it<00:06:26.830> and

00:06:26.969 --> 00:06:26.979 
like well he'll hear part of it and

00:06:26.979 --> 00:06:28.439 
like well he'll hear part of it and
it'll<00:06:27.159> spark<00:06:27.370> a<00:06:27.580> conversation<00:06:27.880> and<00:06:28.330> then

00:06:28.439 --> 00:06:28.449 
it'll spark a conversation and then

00:06:28.449 --> 00:06:30.450 
it'll spark a conversation and then
we'll<00:06:28.659> end<00:06:28.930> up<00:06:29.199> discussing<00:06:29.590> something<00:06:29.979> so

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:30.460 
we'll end up discussing something so

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:32.700 
we'll end up discussing something so
that<00:06:30.810> normally<00:06:31.810> we<00:06:31.930> would<00:06:32.110> have<00:06:32.259> talked<00:06:32.469> about

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:32.710 
that normally we would have talked about

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:34.409 
that normally we would have talked about
so<00:06:32.919> that's<00:06:33.130> another<00:06:33.520> benefit<00:06:33.909> of<00:06:33.969> that<00:06:34.210> and

00:06:34.409 --> 00:06:34.419 
so that's another benefit of that and

00:06:34.419 --> 00:06:36.480
