like those legs go on forever so

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.219 
like those legs go on forever so
especially<00:01:42.329> when<00:01:42.450> she<00:01:42.540> goes<00:01:42.659> on<00:01:42.750> a<00:01:42.810> releve

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
especially when she goes on a releve

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.139 
especially when she goes on a releve
like<00:01:43.500> this<00:01:43.890> is<00:01:44.040> huge<00:01:44.430> high<00:01:44.670> difference<00:01:44.909> there

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
like this is huge high difference there

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.090 
like this is huge high difference there
so<00:01:45.180> it<00:01:45.960> was<00:01:46.110> hard<00:01:46.320> to<00:01:46.380> figure<00:01:46.560> out<00:01:46.710> what<00:01:46.860> to<00:01:46.979> do

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
so it was hard to figure out what to do

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.910 
so it was hard to figure out what to do
with<00:01:47.220> them<00:01:47.340> actually<00:01:47.729> and<00:01:47.970> so<00:01:48.630> I'm<00:01:49.439> very<00:01:49.500> proud
