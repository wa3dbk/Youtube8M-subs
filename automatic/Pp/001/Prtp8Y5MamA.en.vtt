00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:26.960 
saw the pencil test is well the duck

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.780 
saw the pencil test is well the duck
goes<00:00:27.169> off<00:00:27.439> to<00:00:27.619> the<00:00:27.649> right<00:00:27.770> and<00:00:28.130> he<00:00:28.189> comes<00:00:28.430> in<00:00:28.640> on

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:28.790 
goes off to the right and he comes in on

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:30.819 
goes off to the right and he comes in on
the<00:00:28.939> left<00:00:29.149> you<00:00:29.450> have<00:00:29.480> to<00:00:29.689> make<00:00:29.869> sense<00:00:30.200> I<00:00:30.500> said

00:00:30.819 --> 00:00:30.829 
the left you have to make sense I said

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:36.040 
the left you have to make sense I said
look<00:00:31.780> who<00:00:32.780> cares<00:00:33.230> that<00:00:34.030> non<00:00:35.030> sequitur<00:00:35.660> nature

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.050 
look who cares that non sequitur nature

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.319 
look who cares that non sequitur nature
of<00:00:36.199> play<00:00:36.440> is<00:00:36.829> something<00:00:37.280> we<00:00:37.429> really<00:00:37.699> celebrate

00:00:38.319 --> 00:00:38.329 
of play is something we really celebrate

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:40.599 
of play is something we really celebrate
and<00:00:38.809> so<00:00:39.050> this<00:00:39.500> whole<00:00:39.769> idea<00:00:39.800> of<00:00:40.160> just<00:00:40.399> playing

00:00:40.599 --> 00:00:40.609 
and so this whole idea of just playing

00:00:40.609 --> 00:00:42.610 
and so this whole idea of just playing
how<00:00:40.820> you<00:00:40.879> want<00:00:41.269> to<00:00:41.420> really<00:00:41.870> kind<00:00:42.109> of<00:00:42.230> inspired

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.620 
how you want to really kind of inspired

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:54.260 
how you want to really kind of inspired
us<00:00:42.800> with<00:00:43.010> Disney<00:00:43.370> infinity

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.370 

and<00:00:55.270> then<00:00:55.390> we're<00:00:55.510> probably<00:00:55.660> gonna<00:00:55.900> punch<00:00:56.200> up

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:56.380 
and then we're probably gonna punch up

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:58.320 
and then we're probably gonna punch up
this<00:00:56.500> as<00:00:56.650> I<00:00:56.739> think<00:00:56.770> back<00:00:57.160> the<00:00:57.640> genesis<00:00:58.090> of<00:00:58.239> the

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:58.330 
this as I think back the genesis of the

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:01.110 
this as I think back the genesis of the
toy<00:00:58.690> blocks<00:00:58.930> that<00:00:59.380> came<00:00:59.590> from<00:00:59.710> Toy<00:00:59.980> Story<00:01:00.010> 3<00:01:00.310> we

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:01.120 
toy blocks that came from Toy Story 3 we

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.430 
toy blocks that came from Toy Story 3 we
wanted<00:01:01.420> to<00:01:01.510> do<00:01:01.660> something<00:01:01.960> that<00:01:02.110> was<00:01:02.290> much

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:02.440 
wanted to do something that was much

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.140 
wanted to do something that was much
more<00:01:02.470> than<00:01:02.800> just<00:01:02.860> kind<00:01:03.580> of<00:01:03.640> that<00:01:03.730> see<00:01:04.000> the

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:04.150 
more than just kind of that see the

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:07.050 
more than just kind of that see the
movie<00:01:04.420> play<00:01:04.629> the<00:01:04.780> game<00:01:04.989> mentality<00:01:05.740> and<00:01:06.060> with

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.060 
movie play the game mentality and with

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.150 
movie play the game mentality and with
Toy<00:01:07.240> Story<00:01:07.300> 3<00:01:07.570> showed<00:01:08.050> us<00:01:08.229> is<00:01:08.380> that<00:01:08.710> all<00:01:08.950> these

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:09.160 
Toy Story 3 showed us is that all these

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.219 
Toy Story 3 showed us is that all these
characters<00:01:09.729> be<00:01:10.090> coexist<00:01:10.690> because<00:01:11.020> they<00:01:11.170> were

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:11.229 
characters be coexist because they were

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:13.800 
characters be coexist because they were
toys<00:01:11.500> and<00:01:11.920> that<00:01:12.460> just<00:01:12.700> blew<00:01:13.000> the<00:01:13.210> doors<00:01:13.420> open

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
toys and that just blew the doors open

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:14.400 
toys and that just blew the doors open
for<00:01:13.990> us

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:14.410

all just discovering what each toy can
do<00:01:27.630> when<00:01:28.630> we<00:01:28.720> put<00:01:29.020> that<00:01:29.170> early<00:01:29.530> prototype<00:01:30.100> in

front<00:01:30.580> of<00:01:30.670> kids<00:01:30.970> it<00:01:31.869> went<00:01:32.320> crazy<00:01:32.710> you<00:01:33.430> see<00:01:33.729> this

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:33.940 
front of kids it went crazy you see this

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:35.520 
front of kids it went crazy you see this
emergent<00:01:34.450> gameplay<00:01:34.600> coming<00:01:35.229> about<00:01:35.470> because

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
emergent gameplay coming about because

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.660 
emergent gameplay coming about because
they<00:01:36.430> start<00:01:36.790> figuring<00:01:37.180> out<00:01:37.509> combinations<00:01:38.320> oh

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
they start figuring out combinations oh

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.120 
they start figuring out combinations oh
that<00:01:39.670> toy<00:01:39.970> with<00:01:40.600> this<00:01:40.869> toy<00:01:41.140> could<00:01:41.770> do<00:01:41.950> this

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
that toy with this toy could do this

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:44.430 
that toy with this toy could do this
that<00:01:43.060> was<00:01:43.270> the<00:01:43.420> moment<00:01:43.570> where<00:01:43.899> we<00:01:43.930> really<00:01:44.289> knew

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:44.440 
that was the moment where we really knew

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.400 
that was the moment where we really knew
hey<00:01:44.740> something<00:01:45.700> special<00:01:46.060> here<00:01:46.210> but<00:01:46.479> we<00:01:47.200> wanted

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:47.410 
hey something special here but we wanted

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:48.900 
hey something special here but we wanted
to<00:01:47.470> give<00:01:47.619> the<00:01:47.680> player<00:01:47.860> even<00:01:48.039> more<00:01:48.280> freedom<00:01:48.640> so

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:48.910 
to give the player even more freedom so

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:50.940 
to give the player even more freedom so
we<00:01:49.300> took<00:01:49.479> that<00:01:49.540> idea<00:01:49.690> one<00:01:50.200> step<00:01:50.229> further<00:01:50.680> and

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
we took that idea one step further and

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:52.410 
we took that idea one step further and
just<00:01:51.130> said<00:01:51.280> let's<00:01:51.580> go<00:01:51.700> outside<00:01:51.850> toy<00:01:52.240> surrett

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
just said let's go outside toy surrett

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.510 
just said let's go outside toy surrett
let's<00:01:52.600> make<00:01:52.780> toys<00:01:53.049> out<00:01:53.229> of<00:01:53.350> everything<00:01:53.650> and

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:54.520 
let's make toys out of everything and

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.340 
let's make toys out of everything and
that<00:01:54.700> project<00:01:54.970> shifted<00:01:55.540> into<00:01:55.690> what<00:01:56.110> we<00:01:56.229> now

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:56.350 
that project shifted into what we now

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.430 
that project shifted into what we now
know<00:01:56.530> as<00:01:56.830> the<00:01:56.860> toy<00:01:57.310> box<00:01:57.490> in<00:01:57.970> infinity<00:01:58.479> the<00:01:59.200> name

00:01:59.430 --> 00:01:59.440 
know as the toy box in infinity the name

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.190 
know as the toy box in infinity the name
toy<00:01:59.770> box<00:02:00.040> is<00:02:00.280> really<00:02:00.460> apt<00:02:00.790> because<00:02:01.330> it<00:02:01.960> is

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
toy box is really apt because it is

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.920 
toy box is really apt because it is
essentially<00:02:02.890> a<00:02:03.040> modern<00:02:03.640> digital<00:02:04.090> form<00:02:04.689> of

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930 
essentially a modern digital form of
