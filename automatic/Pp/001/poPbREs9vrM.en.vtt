00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:54.250 
over to that big mobile base over there

00:00:54.250 --> 00:01:02.410 
over to that big mobile base over there
thing<00:00:55.250> let's<00:00:55.430> get<00:00:55.580> awesome<00:00:56.000> mileage<00:01:01.420> and

there's this video is just gonna be me
going<00:01:04.550> through<00:01:04.790> the<00:01:04.879> base<00:01:05.059> I'll<00:01:05.479> explain<00:01:05.960> now

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
going through the base I'll explain now

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:07.750 
going through the base I'll explain now
there's<00:01:06.410> one<00:01:06.680> encounter<00:01:07.220> you're<00:01:07.460> gonna<00:01:07.610> have

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:07.760 
there's one encounter you're gonna have

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.680 
there's one encounter you're gonna have
to<00:01:07.820> deal<00:01:07.970> with<00:01:08.030> where<00:01:08.780> you're<00:01:08.960> moving<00:01:09.290> up<00:01:09.590> and

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:10.690 
to deal with where you're moving up and

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:13.330 
to deal with where you're moving up and
I<00:01:11.690> suggest<00:01:12.500> running<00:01:12.590> around<00:01:12.830> looting<00:01:13.160> the

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
I suggest running around looting the

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:21.070 
I suggest running around looting the
area<00:01:13.610> inside<00:01:14.000> the<00:01:14.030> basic<00:01:14.479> idea<00:01:16.660> and<00:01:20.080> the

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.080 
area inside the basic idea and the

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.389 
area inside the basic idea and the
encounter<00:01:21.590> just<00:01:21.770> involves<00:01:22.130> a<00:01:22.190> bunch<00:01:22.369> of

00:01:22.389 --> 00:01:22.399 
encounter just involves a bunch of

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:23.950 
encounter just involves a bunch of
Enclave<00:01:22.790> soldiers<00:01:23.149> it's<00:01:23.330> actually<00:01:23.810> one<00:01:23.930> of

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
Enclave soldiers it's actually one of

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.300 
Enclave soldiers it's actually one of
the<00:01:24.080> easier<00:01:24.440> encounters<00:01:24.920> of<00:01:25.070> this<00:01:25.820> whole<00:01:26.030> area

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.310 
the easier encounters of this whole area

00:01:27.310 --> 00:02:02.880 
the easier encounters of this whole area
so<00:01:28.390> it'll<00:01:29.390> be<00:01:29.509> easy<00:01:29.660> for<00:01:29.930> you<00:01:30.020> to

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.850 

well<00:02:34.700> the<00:02:35.240> satellite<00:02:35.750> tower<00:02:36.020> is<00:02:36.260> right<00:02:36.470> on<00:02:36.590> top

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
well the satellite tower is right on top

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:39.010 
well the satellite tower is right on top
of<00:02:36.890> the<00:02:37.070> base<00:02:37.250> I'm<00:02:38.090> sure<00:02:38.300> you<00:02:38.450> saw<00:02:38.660> it<00:02:38.690> before

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020 
of the base I'm sure you saw it before

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.230 
of the base I'm sure you saw it before
you<00:02:39.110> came<00:02:39.320> in<00:02:39.500> you're<00:02:40.340> gonna<00:02:40.490> have<00:02:40.610> to<00:02:40.880> make<00:02:41.060> it

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:41.240 
you came in you're gonna have to make it

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.120 
you came in you're gonna have to make it
to<00:02:41.360> the<00:02:41.480> central<00:02:41.930> control<00:02:42.110> area<00:02:42.740> before<00:02:43.100> you

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
to the central control area before you

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:44.970 
to the central control area before you
can<00:02:43.310> get<00:02:43.430> on<00:02:43.580> top<00:02:43.820> of<00:02:44.000> the<00:02:44.060> launch<00:02:44.300> platform

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
can get on top of the launch platform

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:46.960 
can get on top of the launch platform
once<00:02:45.980> you're<00:02:46.160> on<00:02:46.250> top<00:02:46.550> of<00:02:46.580> the<00:02:46.730> platform

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
once you're on top of the platform

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.090 
once you're on top of the platform
you're<00:02:47.690> probably<00:02:47.990> gonna<00:02:48.320> have<00:02:48.530> to<00:02:48.590> make<00:02:48.890> your

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.100 
you're probably gonna have to make your

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.070 
you're probably gonna have to make your
way<00:02:49.130> past<00:02:49.550> a<00:02:49.760> bunch<00:02:49.970> of<00:02:50.090> soldiers<00:02:50.600> before<00:02:50.840> you

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
way past a bunch of soldiers before you

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:55.800 
way past a bunch of soldiers before you
get<00:02:51.230> to<00:02:51.350> the<00:02:51.440> tower
