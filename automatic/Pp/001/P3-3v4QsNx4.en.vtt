00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:05.979
 camshaft 

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:07.810
 in modern engines the mechanism of 

00:00:05.979 --> 00:00:11.469
 valves with push rods is 

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:13.509
 being replaced by the hc system in 

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:15.400
 this configuration the camshaft 

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:18.310
 is located on the head of 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:21.099
 cylinders can have one or two trees 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:23.539
 of cams we will see the mechanism with a 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:28.110
 camshaft 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:30.420
 this guy can use seesaws 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:33.030
 the cam lifts to one end of the 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.510
 rocker or can push directly the 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.510
 rocker 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.870
 in systems with double camshaft what 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:45.380
 more common is that some 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:47.600
 fitters or attacks type casserole 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:50.000
 are introduced in guides that 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.490
 surround the spring of the valves and the 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.910
 cam pushes it directly against the 

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:54.910
 valve 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:00.640
 the adjustment or calibration of the aim 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:03.540
 It is carried out by spacers 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.540
 pre calibrated 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:07.980
 the spacers are available in 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.840
 different calibers and you can 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:13.050
 replace to get the calibration 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.660
 correct some engines with tree 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:17.430
 head cams use adjusters 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:19.260
 Hydraulic to maintain slack 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.000
 against the stem of the valves in 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.790
 zero 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.530
 so it does not require calibration and 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.710
 they can be installed in the same 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:31.830
 rocker its operation is identical 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.780
 to the conventional hydraulic dripper the 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:36.030
 oil that enters the adjuster what 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.410
 keeps in contact against the valve and 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.410
 eliminates slack 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.060
 these adjusters can also be 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:50.730
 installed in the head at one end 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.100
 of the seesaw stay stationary 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:55.890
 and provide a pivot for the 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.710
 rocker the plunger of the adjuster 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.830
 keeps the seesaw against the tree 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.830
 cams 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:07.140
 in the casserole type adjusters the 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.690
 hydraulic action of the plunger keeps it 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.300
 pressed against the cam and against the 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:15.890
 valve stem eliminating 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.890
 any slack
