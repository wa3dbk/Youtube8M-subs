I don't know the end of that chord
sequence<00:01:29.530> yeah<00:01:30.490> so<00:01:30.670> that's<00:01:30.819> the<00:01:30.909> clean

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:31.119 
sequence yeah so that's the clean

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:33.539 
sequence yeah so that's the clean
channel<00:01:31.420> it's<00:01:31.869> also<00:01:32.049> got<00:01:32.350> a<00:01:32.380> I've<00:01:33.310> got<00:01:33.369> a

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:33.549 
channel it's also got a I've got a

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:40.039 
channel it's also got a I've got a
bright<00:01:33.850> thing<00:01:33.880> on<00:01:34.390> there<00:01:34.630> and<00:01:36.149> just<00:01:37.149> without

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.490 

with<00:01:41.049> it<00:01:41.679> can<00:01:41.859> compensate<00:01:42.369> for<00:01:42.819> a<00:01:42.909> bit<00:01:43.090> of<00:01:43.209> the

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
with it can compensate for a bit of the

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.169 
with it can compensate for a bit of the
low-end<00:01:44.500> run<00:01:44.740> where<00:01:44.890> you<00:01:44.920> get<00:01:45.219> one<00:01:45.399> on

00:01:46.169 --> 00:01:46.179 
low-end run where you get one on

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:48.449 
low-end run where you get one on
humbucking<00:01:46.750> pickup<00:01:47.170> sometimes<00:01:47.649> so<00:01:47.920> they'll

00:01:48.449 --> 00:01:48.459 
humbucking pickup sometimes so they'll

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:57.690 
humbucking pickup sometimes so they'll
play<00:01:48.609> without<00:01:55.770> sound<00:01:56.770> like<00:01:56.920> tightens<00:01:57.310> up<00:01:57.429> a

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
play without sound like tightens up a

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.219 
play without sound like tightens up a
little<00:01:57.909> bit<00:01:58.119> then<00:01:58.420> it's<00:01:58.539> got<00:01:58.689> a<00:01:58.719> similar<00:01:59.110> one

00:01:59.219 --> 00:01:59.229 
little bit then it's got a similar one

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:04.289 
little bit then it's got a similar one
for<00:02:00.030> giving<00:02:01.030> a<00:02:01.299> bit<00:02:01.569> more<00:02:02.159> meat<00:02:03.159> to<00:02:03.459> single

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:04.299 
for giving a bit more meat to single

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:06.029 
for giving a bit more meat to single
core<00:02:04.450> pickups<00:02:04.810> but<00:02:04.989> I<00:02:05.049> actually<00:02:05.349> don't<00:02:05.739> only

00:02:06.029 --> 00:02:06.039 
core pickups but I actually don't only

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:08.330 
core pickups but I actually don't only
get<00:02:06.280> up<00:02:06.429> with<00:02:06.670> any<00:02:06.789> single<00:02:06.969> coil<00:02:07.239> pickups

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
get up with any single coil pickups

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:33.460 
get up with any single coil pickups
because<00:02:09.340> I'm<00:02:09.459> an<00:02:09.579> idiot<00:02:09.700> I'm<00:02:10.450> working<00:02:10.899> on<00:02:10.989> that

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.020

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
okay so there we go so I reckon that's

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.270 
okay so there we go so I reckon that's
just<00:02:36.209> about<00:02:36.360> enough<00:02:36.420> clean<00:02:36.959> let's<00:02:37.470> go<00:02:38.010> to<00:02:38.069> the

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
just about enough clean let's go to the

00:02:38.280 --> 00:03:15.559 
just about enough clean let's go to the
quench<00:02:38.520> Channel

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:15.569 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:17.759 

okay<00:03:16.569> that's<00:03:16.959> kind<00:03:17.200> of<00:03:17.260> what<00:03:17.379> that's<00:03:17.530> all

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:17.769 
okay that's kind of what that's all

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:41.350 
okay that's kind of what that's all
about<00:03:17.799> and<00:03:18.790> the<00:03:19.420> channel

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:41.360 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:46.250 

that<00:03:42.360> was<00:03:42.480> five<00:03:42.750> for<00:03:43.019> pot<00:03:43.290> pickers<00:03:44.900> right<00:03:45.900> so

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
that was five for pot pickers right so

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.530 
that was five for pot pickers right so
the<00:03:46.440> crunch<00:03:47.310> mode<00:03:47.610> that<00:03:47.970> I<00:03:48.000> showed<00:03:48.269> you<00:03:48.420> before

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
the crunch mode that I showed you before

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.740 
the crunch mode that I showed you before
was<00:03:48.959> mode<00:03:49.290> B<00:03:49.590> which<00:03:50.280> is<00:03:50.489> supposed<00:03:50.849> to<00:03:51.000> be<00:03:51.150> the

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
was mode B which is supposed to be the

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:55.160 
was mode B which is supposed to be the
jcm800<00:03:52.410> e<00:03:52.799> sound<00:03:53.040> says<00:03:53.610> three<00:03:53.910> modes<00:03:54.180> a<00:03:54.420> B<00:03:54.900> and

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
jcm800 e sound says three modes a B and

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
jcm800 e sound says three modes a B and
C<00:03:55.410> so<00:03:56.480> less<00:03:57.480> complicated<00:03:57.989> than<00:03:58.080> the<00:03:58.230> JVM<00:03:58.680> more

00:03:59.180 --> 00:03:59.190 
C so less complicated than the JVM more

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:02.270 
C so less complicated than the JVM more
complicated<00:03:59.819> than<00:03:59.970> DSL<00:04:00.629> so<00:04:01.080> starts<00:04:01.860> off<00:04:02.040> with

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
complicated than DSL so starts off with

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.250 
complicated than DSL so starts off with
the<00:04:02.400> lowest<00:04:02.700> game<00:04:02.879> one<00:04:03.090> which<00:04:03.239> is<00:04:03.420> pay<00:04:03.629> and<00:04:03.959> I'm

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
the lowest game one which is pay and I'm

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.380 
the lowest game one which is pay and I'm
going<00:04:04.379> to<00:04:04.440> be<00:04:04.530> using<00:04:04.799> Scooby<00:04:05.370> Snacks<00:04:05.670> to<00:04:06.239> show

going to show you the elite Channel and
basically<00:05:29.710> this<00:05:29.950> is<00:05:30.010> kind<00:05:30.340> of<00:05:30.490> bitched<00:05:30.760> about

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:30.940 
basically this is kind of bitched about

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:33.620 
basically this is kind of bitched about
quite<00:05:31.360> a<00:05:31.420> lot<00:05:31.540> I<00:05:31.960> don't<00:05:32.440> think<00:05:32.620> it's<00:05:32.770> that<00:05:32.830> bad

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:33.630 
quite a lot I don't think it's that bad

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:36.000 
quite a lot I don't think it's that bad
bear<00:05:34.630> in<00:05:34.810> mind<00:05:34.990> though<00:05:35.170> I<00:05:35.200> have<00:05:35.470> the<00:05:35.590> gain<00:05:35.770> at

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:36.010 
bear in mind though I have the gain at

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:38.310 
bear in mind though I have the gain at
nine<00:05:36.250> o'clock<00:05:36.460> in<00:05:36.850> right<00:05:37.180> game<00:05:37.600> boosters<00:05:38.140> off

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:38.320 
nine o'clock in right game boosters off

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:40.110 
nine o'clock in right game boosters off
and<00:05:38.680> all<00:05:38.770> that<00:05:38.980> kind<00:05:39.220> of<00:05:39.280> crazy<00:05:39.670> is<00:05:39.970> off

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:40.120 
and all that kind of crazy is off

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:44.390 
and all that kind of crazy is off
and<00:05:40.300> I<00:05:41.260> think<00:05:41.560> it<00:05:41.650> gets<00:05:42.010> a<00:05:42.130> pretty<00:05:42.160> good<00:05:42.430> cleat

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:44.400 
and I think it gets a pretty good cleat

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.350 
and I think it gets a pretty good cleat
approximation<00:05:45.400> to<00:05:45.640> what<00:05:45.760> I'm<00:05:45.970> getting<00:05:46.210> on<00:05:46.270> the

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:46.360 
approximation to what I'm getting on the

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:47.730 
approximation to what I'm getting on the
crunch<00:05:46.600> but<00:05:46.840> with<00:05:46.930> a<00:05:46.990> bit<00:05:47.140> more<00:05:47.260> volume<00:05:47.470> bit

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:47.740 
crunch but with a bit more volume bit

00:05:47.740 --> 00:06:12.150 
crunch but with a bit more volume bit
more

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:12.160 

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:15.159 

so<00:06:13.160> still<00:06:13.370> cleans<00:06:13.639> up<00:06:13.850> a<00:06:13.940> little<00:06:14.120> bit<00:06:14.330> now<00:06:14.630> if

00:06:15.159 --> 00:06:15.169 
so still cleans up a little bit now if

00:06:15.169 --> 00:06:17.499 
so still cleans up a little bit now if
we<00:06:15.380> wind<00:06:15.590> that<00:06:15.800> gain<00:06:16.039> up<00:06:16.280> things<00:06:16.970> just<00:06:17.270> get<00:06:17.479> a

00:06:17.499 --> 00:06:17.509 
we wind that gain up things just get a

00:06:17.509 --> 00:07:04.900 
we wind that gain up things just get a
little<00:06:17.900> bit<00:06:18.020> silly

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:04.910 

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:08.450 

so<00:07:05.910> as<00:07:06.180> you<00:07:06.750> can<00:07:06.870> see<00:07:06.930> it<00:07:07.170> loses<00:07:07.530> basically<00:07:08.130> all

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:08.460 
so as you can see it loses basically all

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:11.350 
so as you can see it loses basically all
clarity<00:07:09.240> turns<00:07:09.930> into<00:07:10.140> a<00:07:10.260> bit<00:07:10.410> of<00:07:10.500> a<00:07:10.590> fuzzy<00:07:10.800> mess

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:11.360 
clarity turns into a bit of a fuzzy mess

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:24.810 
clarity turns into a bit of a fuzzy mess
hence<00:07:12.360> why<00:07:12.660> I<00:07:12.690> went<00:07:12.960> for<00:07:13.140> the

00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:24.820 

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:26.910 

and<00:07:25.540> that's<00:07:25.810> me<00:07:25.930> bringing<00:07:26.230> it<00:07:26.320> back<00:07:26.470> down<00:07:26.740> to

00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:26.920 
and that's me bringing it back down to

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:29.340 
and that's me bringing it back down to
the<00:07:27.040> nine<00:07:27.190> o'clock<00:07:27.520> position<00:07:28.000> that<00:07:28.240> I<00:07:28.450> so

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:29.350 
the nine o'clock position that I so

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:34.950 
the nine o'clock position that I so
favor<00:07:32.940> let's<00:07:33.940> just<00:07:34.150> sign<00:07:34.330> up<00:07:34.390> with<00:07:34.600> some

00:07:34.950 --> 00:07:34.960 
favor let's just sign up with some
