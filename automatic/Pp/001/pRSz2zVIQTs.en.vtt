00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:08.309
 hello here is the kiss of aeromodelismo 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.340
 online 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:15.450
 Today I'll show you what's 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:17.970
 Do you have one to print a radio for? 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.939
 after seeing the model and turning off 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:24.689
 first is the model you can do to the art 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:28.980
 in fact an explaining expansion is 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:33.210
 this is necessary for you not to occur 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:37.290
 the risk of interference 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:40.260
 a loss of signal and the engine would be 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:43.860
 totally this happened the accident is 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:48.329
 simple reason who is receiving 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.620
 social is what model and become a 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.230
 model 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:55.140
 if you see what model is already 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:58.289
 ready to receive the signal either has no 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:01.590
 exceptional to receive because the 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:04.320
 radio transmitter was off 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:07.250
 he will try to capture something can 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:10.979
 give a sign already pointed body 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:12.869
 interference and to that extent what can 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.390
 accelerate the engine and in that moment you 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:19.350
 just turned on and does it accelerates powder 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:22.110
 a form as the receiver with translation 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.600
 on this there is no risk then you 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:28.799
 called so many today afternoon when 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:31.290
 You connect the I perceive so you already capture the 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:35.850
 signal from the transmitter that the engine is 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:38.009
 turned off the radio and is not failure 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.790
 free running 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:43.140
 the risk of none and a lot to disconnect 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.689
 the same reason 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:56.100
 if you lift person while 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:02:00.270
 were connected by you counted signal 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:03.550
 here and he can get lost in it can 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.620
 fire the dodo 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:09.790
 do anything else that besides 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:13.420
 an accident can compromise your power 

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:16.210
 something like this then it is fundamental that 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:22.300
 the transmitter is the first to connect 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:25.020
 11 turns off what was another tip a 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:30.420
 why I saw so many people 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:33.760
 I had doubt is the reason for this 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:38.500
 some did not know that our law as the 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:42.580
 rule of order for you to reach your 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:44.830
 equipment paid then this is one more 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:48.250
 a tip for you 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:52.360
 if you are watching this video understand 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:53.470
 this body does not know is still how 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:03:00.070
 proceed 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:03:04.600
 from the sea for you to register minkus 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:06.730
 only totally free will receive 7 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.930
 and then I still have a 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:11.980
 bonus 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:16.480
 Who is a surprise to you, it 's just you. 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:20.350
 If you do not sign up, it's your email and you will 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:23.980
 receive some classes with items 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:27.430
 Basic is more than able to help you even 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:29.530
 about anything is the crisis can 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:33.910
 be that something you have lost 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:42.090
 and have a step by step for you to understand 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:45.090
 in general I got a good week
