I<00:00:58.570> read<00:00:59.410> it<00:00:59.559> online<00:00:59.920> not<00:01:00.460> everything<00:01:00.879> online

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.030 
I read it online not everything online

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:08.550 
I read it online not everything online
is<00:01:01.210> true<00:01:06.300> if<00:01:07.300> the<00:01:07.540> reaction<00:01:08.020> I'm<00:01:08.170> giving<00:01:08.440> is

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:08.560 
is true if the reaction I'm giving is

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.520 
is true if the reaction I'm giving is
wrong<00:01:08.740> please<00:01:08.950> correct<00:01:09.130> it<00:01:09.640> you<00:01:10.390> can<00:01:10.540> save<00:01:11.380> the

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:11.530 
wrong please correct it you can save the

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:17.389 
wrong please correct it you can save the
correction<00:01:12.009> in<00:01:12.160> the<00:01:12.280> comments<00:01:12.790> section<00:01:13.780> I

00:01:17.389 --> 00:01:17.399 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:19.980 

don't<00:01:18.399> know<00:01:18.490> if<00:01:18.640> you<00:01:18.790> can<00:01:18.940> see<00:01:19.240> it<00:01:19.390> on<00:01:19.660> this

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
don't know if you can see it on this

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.529 
don't know if you can see it on this
camera<00:01:20.320> I<00:01:20.680> said<00:01:21.070> you<00:01:21.190> can<00:01:21.430> but<00:01:22.060> the<00:01:22.240> color<00:01:22.450> of

00:01:22.529 --> 00:01:22.539 
camera I said you can but the color of

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:26.850 
camera I said you can but the color of
the<00:01:22.750> flame<00:01:23.940> from<00:01:24.940> the<00:01:25.170> potassium<00:01:26.170> nitrate<00:01:26.710> and

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.860 
the flame from the potassium nitrate and

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:28.830 
the flame from the potassium nitrate and
sugar<00:01:27.039> reaction<00:01:27.640> is<00:01:28.180> purple

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 
sugar reaction is purple

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.020 
sugar reaction is purple
that's<00:01:28.990> because<00:01:29.320> potassium<00:01:29.950> ions<00:01:30.250> give<00:01:31.000> a

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.030 
that's because potassium ions give a

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:41.730 
that's because potassium ions give a
purple<00:01:31.539> flame<00:01:35.759> it's<00:01:36.759> pretty<00:01:37.060> cool<00:01:40.680> here's<00:01:41.680> a

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
purple flame it's pretty cool here's a

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.020 
purple flame it's pretty cool here's a
lot<00:01:42.040> of<00:01:42.189> it<00:01:42.720> produces<00:01:43.720> a<00:01:43.750> lot<00:01:43.990> of<00:01:44.020> smoke<00:01:45.030> it's

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
lot of it produces a lot of smoke it's

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:54.710 
lot of it produces a lot of smoke it's
even<00:01:46.270> using<00:01:46.570> some<00:01:46.750> homemade<00:01:47.320> smoke<00:01:47.650> bombs

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.960 

even<00:01:55.720> using<00:01:56.200> model<00:01:56.710> rocket<00:01:57.100> engines<00:01:57.549> which

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:57.970 
even using model rocket engines which

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:04.340 
even using model rocket engines which
are<00:01:58.150> homemade<00:01:59.100> maybe<00:02:00.100> I<00:02:00.189> can<00:02:00.369> make<00:02:00.490> one

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.560 

thanks<00:02:05.159> for<00:02:05.280> watching<00:02:05.700> if<00:02:06.060> you're<00:02:06.180> gonna<00:02:06.299> try

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
thanks for watching if you're gonna try

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.740 
thanks for watching if you're gonna try
this<00:02:06.630> remember<00:02:07.259> to<00:02:07.290> be<00:02:07.500> safe
