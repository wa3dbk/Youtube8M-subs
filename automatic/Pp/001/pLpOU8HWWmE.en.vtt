Phillips<00:00:31.920> head<00:00:32.070> screwdriver<00:00:32.550> probably<00:00:33.059> ten

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
Phillips head screwdriver probably ten

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.120 
Phillips head screwdriver probably ten
to<00:00:33.540> twelve<00:00:33.809> inches<00:00:34.140> to<00:00:34.350> get<00:00:34.440> down<00:00:34.710> in<00:00:34.950> there

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130

it's pretty deep very skinny slot so you

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.740 
it's pretty deep very skinny slot so you

in<00:00:40.379> there<00:00:40.680> and<00:00:42.469> here's<00:00:43.469> what<00:00:43.710> we're<00:00:43.920> looking

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
in there and here's what we're looking

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:44.660 
in there and here's what we're looking
at

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
at

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.110 
at
it's<00:00:44.820> got<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.120> wide<00:00:45.329> washer<00:00:46.730> and<00:00:47.730> actually<00:00:48.090> I

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
it's got the wide washer and actually I

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.100 
it's got the wide washer and actually I
was<00:00:48.180> able<00:00:48.329> to<00:00:48.450> pull<00:00:48.629> it<00:00:48.750> out<00:00:48.840> with<00:00:48.960> this

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
was able to pull it out with this

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.290 
was able to pull it out with this
screwdriver<00:00:49.440> so<00:00:50.129> it's<00:00:50.280> probably<00:00:50.579> about<00:00:50.760> a<00:00:50.820> 10

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
screwdriver so it's probably about a 10

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.799 
screwdriver so it's probably about a 10
to<00:00:51.449> 12<00:00:51.690> inch<00:00:51.809> er<00:00:51.989> and<00:00:54.440> took<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.559> screws<00:00:55.829> out

00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:56.809 
to 12 inch er and took the screws out

00:00:56.809 --> 00:00:59.180 
to 12 inch er and took the screws out
they<00:00:57.809> fell<00:00:58.079> right<00:00:58.109> to<00:00:58.260> the<00:00:58.440> ground<00:00:58.649> so<00:00:58.859> no<00:00:58.980> big

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
they fell right to the ground so no big

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.580 
they fell right to the ground so no big
deal<00:00:59.370> there<00:00:59.719> but<00:01:00.719> the<00:01:00.809> light<00:01:00.960> was<00:01:00.989> still<00:01:01.350> tight

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
deal there but the light was still tight

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.470 
deal there but the light was still tight
I<00:01:01.859> was<00:01:02.160> prying<00:01:02.460> on<00:01:02.640> it<00:01:02.820> didn't<00:01:03.059> know<00:01:03.149> what<00:01:03.329> was

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
I was prying on it didn't know what was

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.880 
I was prying on it didn't know what was
going<00:01:03.690> on<00:01:03.780> I<00:01:03.840> couldn't<00:01:04.199> find<00:01:04.350> anything<00:01:04.619> online

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
going on I couldn't find anything online

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.170 
going on I couldn't find anything online
so<00:01:05.820> I<00:01:05.850> started<00:01:06.710> kind<00:01:07.710> of<00:01:07.830> wedging<00:01:08.430> ax<00:01:08.520> at<00:01:08.820> soft

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
so I started kind of wedging ax at soft

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.620 
so I started kind of wedging ax at soft
Allen<00:01:09.630> here<00:01:09.960> with<00:01:10.439> a<00:01:10.470> little<00:01:11.070> pry<00:01:11.310> bar<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:11.790> it

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
Allen here with a little pry bar and it

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.179 
Allen here with a little pry bar and it
finally<00:01:12.900> came<00:01:13.049> loose<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:13.710> I'll<00:01:13.950> show<00:01:14.130> you

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189

what<00:01:14.490> I<00:01:14.520> had<00:01:15.350> discovered<00:01:16.350> this<00:01:16.770> little<00:01:16.950> rubber

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
what I had discovered this little rubber

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.480 
what I had discovered this little rubber
grommet<00:01:17.700> here<00:01:17.939> just<00:01:18.810> trucks<00:01:19.290> you<00:01:19.740> know<00:01:19.770> 11

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
grommet here just trucks you know 11

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.609 
grommet here just trucks you know 11
years<00:01:20.640> old<00:01:20.850> 12<00:01:20.970> years<00:01:21.240> old<00:01:21.479> already<00:01:21.869> so<00:01:22.170> it's

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
years old 12 years old already so it's

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:25.359 
years old 12 years old already so it's
obviously<00:01:23.070> dried<00:01:23.810> sticking<00:01:24.810> to<00:01:24.900> that<00:01:24.990> pin

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:25.369 
obviously dried sticking to that pin

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:28.390 
obviously dried sticking to that pin
I've<00:01:26.369> got<00:01:26.549> another<00:01:26.850> one<00:01:27.060> over<00:01:27.540> here

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:28.400 
I've got another one over here

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.280 
I've got another one over here
another<00:01:29.400> pin<00:01:29.729> right<00:01:30.270> there<00:01:30.570> that<00:01:30.810> goes<00:01:30.960> back

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
another pin right there that goes back

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.920 
another pin right there that goes back
in<00:01:31.710> there<00:01:32.520> so<00:01:33.119> that's<00:01:33.329> sort<00:01:33.479> of<00:01:33.600> like<00:01:33.720> an

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
in there so that's sort of like an

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.620 
in there so that's sort of like an
alignment<00:01:34.259> for<00:01:34.650> these<00:01:34.770> housings<00:01:35.250> and<00:01:35.630> then

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
alignment for these housings and then

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.300 
alignment for these housings and then
that<00:01:36.810> way<00:01:36.960> it's<00:01:37.170> in<00:01:37.290> place<00:01:37.590> a<00:01:37.619> lot<00:01:37.920> easier<00:01:38.220> to

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
that way it's in place a lot easier to

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.490 
that way it's in place a lot easier to
put<00:01:38.490> your<00:01:38.610> screws<00:01:38.880> in<00:01:39.150> and<00:01:39.270> out<00:01:39.420> so<00:01:40.140> anyway

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
put your screws in and out so anyway

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.050 
put your screws in and out so anyway
what<00:01:40.770> I<00:01:40.799> did<00:01:41.070> I<00:01:41.990> put<00:01:42.990> a<00:01:43.020> little<00:01:43.850> bearing<00:01:44.850> grease

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
what I did I put a little bearing grease

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.460 
what I did I put a little bearing grease
on<00:01:45.509> those<00:01:46.170> pins<00:01:46.560> and<00:01:47.990> hopefully<00:01:48.990> if<00:01:49.079> I<00:01:49.200> have<00:01:49.350> to

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
on those pins and hopefully if I have to

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.289 
on those pins and hopefully if I have to
ever<00:01:49.590> replay<00:01:49.920> this<00:01:50.100> replace<00:01:50.729> this<00:01:50.909> down<00:01:51.119> the

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
ever replay this replace this down the

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:52.460 
ever replay this replace this down the
road<00:01:51.479> it'll<00:01:51.720> be<00:01:51.810> a<00:01:51.840> little<00:01:51.990> easier<00:01:52.140> to<00:01:52.439> take

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
road it'll be a little easier to take

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.770 
road it'll be a little easier to take
out<00:01:52.850> one<00:01:53.850> thing<00:01:54.060> I<00:01:54.090> also<00:01:54.240> want<00:01:54.509> to<00:01:54.540> show<00:01:54.720> you
