and<00:00:00.089> then<00:00:00.630> I<00:00:00.659> trace<00:00:00.989> this<00:00:01.230> through<00:00:01.829> time

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:02.100 
and then I trace this through time

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.269 
and then I trace this through time
through<00:00:03.030> the<00:00:03.149> era<00:00:03.600> in<00:00:03.899> America<00:00:04.470> when<00:00:04.740> cities

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279 
through the era in America when cities

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.780 
through the era in America when cities
grew<00:00:05.670> and<00:00:06.060> the<00:00:06.839> food<00:00:07.170> system<00:00:07.790> industrialized

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
grew and the food system industrialized

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.049 
grew and the food system industrialized
and<00:00:09.210> we<00:00:09.719> came<00:00:09.960> to<00:00:10.500> need<00:00:10.710> to<00:00:10.860> learn<00:00:11.010> a<00:00:11.340> new<00:00:11.580> way

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
and we came to need to learn a new way

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.959 
and we came to need to learn a new way
of<00:00:12.090> thinking<00:00:12.360> about<00:00:12.929> our<00:00:13.049> foods<00:00:13.639> it<00:00:14.639> was<00:00:14.790> kind

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
of thinking about our foods it was kind

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.120 
of thinking about our foods it was kind
of<00:00:15.000> interesting<00:00:15.420> because<00:00:15.770> just<00:00:16.770> about<00:00:16.830> the

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
of interesting because just about the

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.150 
of interesting because just about the
time<00:00:17.340> that<00:00:17.820> the<00:00:17.970> food<00:00:18.180> system<00:00:19.160> industrialized

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
time that the food system industrialized

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.970 
time that the food system industrialized
and<00:00:20.520> it<00:00:20.789> became<00:00:21.060> unappetizing<00:00:21.710> to<00:00:22.710> know<00:00:22.830> about

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
and it became unappetizing to know about

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.490 
and it became unappetizing to know about
how<00:00:23.340> foods<00:00:23.699> were<00:00:23.910> actually<00:00:24.480> made<00:00:24.689> that's

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
how foods were actually made that's

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.070 
how foods were actually made that's
exactly<00:00:25.859> the<00:00:26.310> time<00:00:26.519> that<00:00:26.970> the<00:00:27.510> advertising

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
exactly the time that the advertising

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.810 
exactly the time that the advertising
industry<00:00:28.140> kind<00:00:28.800> of<00:00:28.859> came<00:00:29.070> into<00:00:29.250> being<00:00:29.460> and

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
industry kind of came into being and

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.759 
industry kind of came into being and
really<00:00:30.449> cut<00:00:30.660> its<00:00:30.779> teeth<00:00:31.080> helping<00:00:31.590> to<00:00:31.740> ease

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
really cut its teeth helping to ease

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.180 
really cut its teeth helping to ease
Americans<00:00:32.610> into<00:00:32.940> new<00:00:33.570> and<00:00:33.840> more<00:00:34.680> appealing

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
Americans into new and more appealing

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.220 
Americans into new and more appealing
and<00:00:35.430> appetizing<00:00:36.090> ways<00:00:36.270> to<00:00:36.809> know<00:00:36.930> about<00:00:37.079> our

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
and appetizing ways to know about our

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.549 
and appetizing ways to know about our
foods<00:00:37.620> you<00:00:38.160> know<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.399> task<00:00:38.700> of<00:00:39.090> feeding<00:00:39.600> huge

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
foods you know the task of feeding huge

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.950 
foods you know the task of feeding huge
urban<00:00:40.829> populations<00:00:41.790> drove<00:00:42.300> a<00:00:42.540> lot<00:00:42.780> of

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
urban populations drove a lot of

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.319 
urban populations drove a lot of
innovation<00:00:43.649> and<00:00:43.860> technological

00:00:44.319 --> 00:00:44.329 
innovation and technological

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:48.139 
innovation and technological
transformations<00:00:45.329> and<00:00:45.570> how<00:00:45.750> our<00:00:46.050> foods<00:00:47.120> can<00:00:48.120> be

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
transformations and how our foods can be

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.910 
transformations and how our foods can be
produced<00:00:48.539> you<00:00:49.289> know<00:00:49.469> so<00:00:49.649> there<00:00:49.800> was

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
produced you know so there was

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.270 
produced you know so there was
mechanization<00:00:50.610> of<00:00:51.530> foods<00:00:52.530> like<00:00:52.800> in<00:00:52.949> my<00:00:53.039> book<00:00:53.190> I

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
mechanization of foods like in my book I

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.069 
mechanization of foods like in my book I
talk<00:00:53.309> about<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.940> history<00:00:54.239> of<00:00:54.329> canned<00:00:54.719> foods

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
talk about the history of canned foods

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.380 
talk about the history of canned foods
but<00:00:56.039> then<00:00:56.190> farther<00:00:56.460> along<00:00:56.670> there's<00:00:57.000> all<00:00:57.120> sorts

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
but then farther along there's all sorts

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.500 
but then farther along there's all sorts
of<00:00:57.449> food<00:00:57.719> chemistry<00:00:58.289> and<00:00:58.530> food<00:00:59.210> science<00:01:00.210> that

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
of food chemistry and food science that

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.930 
of food chemistry and food science that
is<00:01:00.780> able<00:01:01.230> to<00:01:01.350> transform<00:01:01.949> things<00:01:02.399> like<00:01:02.730> the

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
is able to transform things like the

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.969 
is able to transform things like the
lowly<00:01:03.239> soybean<00:01:03.719> and<00:01:03.899> all<00:01:04.019> into<00:01:04.350> into<00:01:04.830> all

sorts<00:01:05.010> of<00:01:05.430> other<00:01:05.580> additives<00:01:06.299> and<00:01:06.770> you<00:01:07.770> know

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
sorts of other additives and you know

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.410 
sorts of other additives and you know
different<00:01:08.549> types<00:01:08.729> of<00:01:08.850> foods<00:01:09.090> that<00:01:09.299> we

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
different types of foods that we

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.460 
different types of foods that we
wouldn't<00:01:09.630> even<00:01:09.659> imagine<00:01:10.260> so<00:01:10.890> that's<00:01:11.130> one<00:01:11.670> way

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 
wouldn't even imagine so that's one way

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.649 
wouldn't even imagine so that's one way
you<00:01:13.470> know<00:01:13.560> one<00:01:13.770> kind<00:01:14.040> of<00:01:14.479> trend<00:01:15.479> that's

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
you know one kind of trend that's

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.660 
you know one kind of trend that's
happened<00:01:16.110> with<00:01:16.229> our<00:01:16.259> foods<00:01:16.590> and<00:01:16.799> my<00:01:17.369> book<00:01:17.580> I

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
happened with our foods and my book I

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.249 
happened with our foods and my book I
don't<00:01:17.850> really<00:01:18.000> focus<00:01:18.299> on<00:01:18.689> kind<00:01:19.049> of<00:01:19.140> a

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
don't really focus on kind of a

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.260 
don't really focus on kind of a
technology<00:01:19.619> per<00:01:20.040> se<00:01:20.250> I'm<00:01:20.490> was<00:01:20.939> much<00:01:21.119> more

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
technology per se I'm was much more

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.390 
technology per se I'm was much more
interested<00:01:21.750> in<00:01:21.840> people's<00:01:22.200> responses<00:01:22.950> to<00:01:23.280> the

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
interested in people's responses to the

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.390 
interested in people's responses to the
technology<00:01:24.320> and<00:01:25.320> early<00:01:25.770> on<00:01:25.799> i<00:01:25.920> was<00:01:26.250> really

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
technology and early on i was really

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.550 
technology and early on i was really
fine<00:01:26.759> too<00:01:27.060> surprised<00:01:27.780> to<00:01:28.080> find<00:01:28.229> that<00:01:28.380> people

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
fine too surprised to find that people

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.710 
fine too surprised to find that people
are<00:01:28.710> very<00:01:28.860> skeptical<00:01:29.430> of<00:01:29.729> new<00:01:29.970> foods<00:01:30.299> when

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
are very skeptical of new foods when

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.319 
are very skeptical of new foods when
they<00:01:30.869> came<00:01:31.110> out<00:01:31.350> you<00:01:32.130> know<00:01:32.280> nowadays<00:01:32.490> we<00:01:33.119> think

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
they came out you know nowadays we think

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.300 
they came out you know nowadays we think
about<00:01:33.479> cans<00:01:33.869> as<00:01:34.229> being<00:01:34.530> incredibly<00:01:34.680> familiar

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
about cans as being incredibly familiar

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.219 
about cans as being incredibly familiar
I<00:01:35.820> mean<00:01:36.000> we<00:01:36.090> just<00:01:36.270> don't<00:01:36.450> even<00:01:36.630> think<00:01:36.780> about<00:01:36.930> a

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
I mean we just don't even think about a

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.010 
I mean we just don't even think about a
can<00:01:37.560> as<00:01:37.979> a<00:01:38.040> technology<00:01:38.820> you<00:01:38.970> know<00:01:39.090> but<00:01:39.840> that

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
can as a technology you know but that

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.300 
can as a technology you know but that
when<00:01:40.200> they<00:01:40.320> were<00:01:40.380> new<00:01:40.470> people<00:01:41.040> were<00:01:41.130> really

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
when they were new people were really

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.399 
when they were new people were really
skeptical<00:01:41.820> of<00:01:42.030> them<00:01:42.240> and<00:01:42.479> if<00:01:42.960> you<00:01:43.079> think<00:01:43.320> about

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
skeptical of them and if you think about

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.830 
skeptical of them and if you think about
it<00:01:43.590> for<00:01:43.979> perspective<00:01:44.250> before<00:01:44.850> canned<00:01:45.329> foods

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
it for perspective before canned foods

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.380 
it for perspective before canned foods
were<00:01:46.079> leafy<00:01:46.470> and<00:01:46.710> green<00:01:46.950> and<00:01:47.549> fleshy<00:01:48.000> and

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
were leafy and green and fleshy and

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.670 
were leafy and green and fleshy and
earthy<00:01:48.780> you<00:01:49.079> know<00:01:49.170> you<00:01:49.290> could<00:01:49.409> really<00:01:49.560> see

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
earthy you know you could really see

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.620 
earthy you know you could really see
them<00:01:50.070> and<00:01:50.220> smell<00:01:50.460> them<00:01:50.520> or<00:01:50.790> lose<00:01:50.909> your<00:01:51.119> senses

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
them and smell them or lose your senses

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.700 
them and smell them or lose your senses
to<00:01:52.520> evaluate<00:01:53.520> them<00:01:53.700> but<00:01:54.420> Keenan's<00:01:54.990> can<00:01:55.259> see<00:01:55.500> in

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
to evaluate them but Keenan's can see in

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:56.760 
to evaluate them but Keenan's can see in
the<00:01:55.799> foods

forward ahead to now the 1990s the early
2000s<00:03:10.840> and<00:03:11.709> i<00:03:11.799> think<00:03:11.980> we're<00:03:12.100> seeing<00:03:12.280> this

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
2000s and i think we're seeing this

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.699 
2000s and i think we're seeing this
amazing<00:03:13.000> ground<00:03:13.329> swell<00:03:13.750> of<00:03:13.780> interest<00:03:14.079> right

00:03:14.699 --> 00:03:14.709 
amazing ground swell of interest right

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:17.340

now and local foods and organic foods
and<00:03:18.130> i<00:03:18.370> think<00:03:18.609> it's<00:03:18.730> because<00:03:18.910> people<00:03:19.120> are

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
and i think it's because people are

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.140 
and i think it's because people are
increasingly<00:03:20.650> concerned<00:03:21.370> about<00:03:21.730> what's<00:03:21.970> in

their food how food production affects
the<00:03:24.430> environment<00:03:24.579> and<00:03:25.180> so<00:03:25.690> we're<00:03:25.870> now

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:26.019 
the environment and so we're now

starting<00:03:26.590> to<00:03:27.400> learn<00:03:27.639> a<00:03:28.000> new<00:03:28.030> kitchen<00:03:28.359> letter

trying to see how their own eating is
linked<00:03:41.500> to<00:03:41.560> all<00:03:41.739> these<00:03:41.950> things<00:03:42.359> is<00:03:43.359> that<00:03:43.480> a

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:43.630 
linked to all these things is that a

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:45.420 
linked to all these things is that a
difficult<00:03:43.840> transition<00:03:44.349> for<00:03:44.739> people<00:03:45.130> to<00:03:45.250> make

difficult transition for people to make

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.390 
difficult transition for people to make
i<00:03:45.989> think<00:03:46.989> it<00:03:47.139> can<00:03:47.349> be<00:03:47.380> for<00:03:47.769> some<00:03:47.919> people<00:03:48.250> i

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
i think it can be for some people i
