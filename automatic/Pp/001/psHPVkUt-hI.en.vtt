the shelf here this should work fine and
I'll<00:00:38.670> show<00:00:38.850> you<00:00:38.940> how<00:00:39.059> to<00:00:39.149> do<00:00:39.719> this<00:00:39.870> kind<00:00:40.079> of

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
I'll show you how to do this kind of

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.830 
I'll show you how to do this kind of
wiring<00:00:40.640> first<00:00:41.640> step<00:00:41.910> is<00:00:42.120> simply<00:00:42.480> kind<00:00:42.750> of

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
wiring first step is simply kind of

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.630 
wiring first step is simply kind of
layout<00:00:43.050> where<00:00:43.620> things<00:00:43.950> go<00:00:44.190> and<00:00:44.430> where<00:00:44.610> you

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
layout where things go and where you

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.180 
layout where things go and where you
want<00:00:44.910> them<00:00:45.320> you<00:00:46.320> have<00:00:46.460> three<00:00:47.460> chips<00:00:47.789> I<00:00:49.160> have<00:00:50.160> a

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
want them you have three chips I have a

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.090 
want them you have three chips I have a
set<00:00:50.460> of<00:00:50.579> pins<00:00:50.820> here<00:00:51.239> and<00:00:51.590> what<00:00:52.590> I'll<00:00:52.680> do<00:00:52.860> is

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
set of pins here and what I'll do is

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.580 
set of pins here and what I'll do is
I'll<00:00:53.190> make<00:00:53.370> each<00:00:53.640> row<00:00:54.449> going<00:00:54.840> this<00:00:54.989> way<00:00:55.430> be<00:00:56.430> the

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:57.590 
I'll make each row going this way be the

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:03.850 
I'll make each row going this way be the
enable<00:00:58.590> forward<00:00:59.430> and<00:00:59.640> reverse<00:00:59.940> for<00:01:00.660> one<00:01:02.390> half

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:03.860 
enable forward and reverse for one half

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.859 
enable forward and reverse for one half
enable<00:01:04.860> forward<00:01:05.309> reverse<00:01:05.460> for<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.180> next<00:01:06.540> and

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
enable forward reverse for the next and

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.730 
enable forward reverse for the next and
so<00:01:07.170> on<00:01:07.200> down<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.530> row<00:01:07.830> so<00:01:08.070> I<00:01:08.159> cover<00:01:08.430> all<00:01:08.640> six

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
so on down the row so I cover all six

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:16.520 
so on down the row so I cover all six
motors<00:01:11.810> there<00:01:12.810> are<00:01:13.020> four<00:01:15.290> potentiometers<00:01:16.290> on

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
motors there are four potentiometers on

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.390 
motors there are four potentiometers on
the<00:01:16.890> on<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:17.790> robot<00:01:18.210> arm<00:01:18.479> so<00:01:19.200> i<00:01:19.259> will<00:01:19.560> bring<00:01:20.250> out

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
the on the robot arm so i will bring out

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.609

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
how how well we're clamping the flyback

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.850 
how how well we're clamping the flyback
voltage<00:03:48.670> is<00:03:48.820> the<00:03:48.850> back<00:03:49.180> EMF<00:03:49.210> and<00:03:49.930> look<00:03:50.650> for

voltage is the back EMF and look for
noise<00:03:51.090> and<00:03:52.090> then<00:03:52.210> I<00:03:52.240> have<00:03:52.450> some<00:03:52.690> resistors

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230 
noise and then I have some resistors

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.780 
noise and then I have some resistors
that<00:03:53.290> i'll<00:03:53.830> put<00:03:54.610> in<00:03:54.790> between<00:03:55.380> the<00:03:56.380> input<00:03:57.040> pins

and my signals here to isolate those
would<00:04:01.390> be<00:04:01.600> a<00:04:01.630> LED<00:04:02.590> indicator<00:04:03.660> this<00:04:04.830> tells<00:04:05.830> me

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
would be a LED indicator this tells me

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:08.580 
would be a LED indicator this tells me

one of the powers I and another thing
I'm<00:04:08.830> going<00:04:08.950> to<00:04:09.010> do<00:04:09.190> about<00:04:09.310> this<00:04:09.640> you<00:04:09.970> know<00:04:10.060> if<00:04:10.150> I

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:10.300 
I'm going to do about this you know if I

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:12.600 
I'm going to do about this you know if I
wire<00:04:10.510> it<00:04:10.690> up<00:04:10.780> like<00:04:11.020> this<00:04:11.260> and<00:04:11.560> I<00:04:12.100> put<00:04:12.370> it<00:04:12.490> in<00:04:12.520> the

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:12.610 
wire it up like this and I put it in the

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:16.250 
wire it up like this and I put it in the
box<00:04:12.850> and<00:04:13.240> put<00:04:13.990> the<00:04:14.110> top<00:04:14.290> on<00:04:14.500> the<00:04:14.620> box<00:04:14.860> now<00:04:15.700> these

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
box and put the top on the box now these

breakout or header pins are going to be
buried<00:04:20.260> pretty<00:04:20.560> deep<00:04:20.709> so<00:04:21.430> what<00:04:21.610> I'm<00:04:21.700> going<00:04:21.880> to

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:21.970 
buried pretty deep so what I'm going to

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.120 
buried pretty deep so what I'm going to
do<00:04:22.120> is<00:04:22.330> when<00:04:22.450> I<00:04:22.480> actually<00:04:22.720> solder<00:04:23.200> this<00:04:23.500> I'll

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
do is when I actually solder this I'll

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:28.980 
do is when I actually solder this I'll
take<00:04:24.460> them<00:04:24.760> and<00:04:25.020> put<00:04:26.020> them<00:04:26.980> on<00:04:27.250> the<00:04:27.430> board<00:04:27.990> from

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
take them and put them on the board from

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:34.140 
take them and put them on the board from
the<00:04:29.080> back<00:04:29.460> this<00:04:30.460> way<00:04:32.310> hard<00:04:33.310> to<00:04:33.460> see<00:04:33.610> there<00:04:34.030> you

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.150 
the back this way hard to see there you

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:37.200 
the back this way hard to see there you
go<00:04:34.180> this<00:04:34.900> way<00:04:35.110> so<00:04:35.650> then<00:04:35.830> on<00:04:36.040> the<00:04:36.220> bottom<00:04:36.820> of

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.210 
go this way so then on the bottom of

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:40.770 
go this way so then on the bottom of
this<00:04:37.650> box<00:04:38.650> which<00:04:39.130> fits<00:04:39.400> the<00:04:39.580> sport<00:04:39.970> I'll<00:04:40.570> be

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:40.780 
this box which fits the sport I'll be

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:42.510 
this box which fits the sport I'll be
able<00:04:40.810> to<00:04:40.990> make<00:04:41.080> the<00:04:41.260> cut<00:04:41.470> outs<00:04:41.650> in<00:04:41.890> the<00:04:42.010> box<00:04:42.250> and

able to make the cut outs in the box and
it<00:04:43.180> access<00:04:43.900> those<00:04:44.080> pretty<00:04:44.350> easily<00:04:44.560> but<00:04:45.330> be

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:46.330 
it access those pretty easily but be

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:47.520 
it access those pretty easily but be
careful<00:04:46.690> not<00:04:46.780> to<00:04:46.900> chip<00:04:47.080> with<00:04:47.260> everything

ground so I need to get connected to all
four<00:06:59.710> of<00:06:59.740> those<00:06:59.920> and<00:07:00.250> I'm<00:07:00.340> using<00:07:00.550> two<00:07:01.510> lengths

four of those and I'm using two lengths
of<00:07:02.020> wire<00:07:02.200> so<00:07:02.800> it<00:07:02.830> at<00:07:03.010> least<00:07:03.130> has<00:07:03.430> a<00:07:03.460> little<00:07:03.880> bit

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:04.030 
of wire so it at least has a little bit

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:06.530 
of wire so it at least has a little bit
of<00:07:04.060> mass<00:07:04.330> to<00:07:04.630> carry<00:07:04.870> away<00:07:04.990> some<00:07:05.320> of<00:07:05.350> the<00:07:05.530> heat

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:06.540 
of mass to carry away some of the heat

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:08.820 
of mass to carry away some of the heat
ideally<00:07:07.540> it<00:07:07.570> would<00:07:07.630> be<00:07:07.810> connected<00:07:08.290> to<00:07:08.440> a<00:07:08.470> large

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:08.830 
ideally it would be connected to a large

ideally it would be connected to a large
copper<00:07:09.730> ground<00:07:10.180> plane<00:07:10.630> to<00:07:10.840> carry<00:07:11.080> away<00:07:11.200> the

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:14.020 
heat but we don't have that with this

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:16.140 
heat but we don't have that with this
kind<00:07:14.320> of<00:07:14.380> perf<00:07:14.740> board<00:07:15.040> so<00:07:15.280> I'll<00:07:15.430> just<00:07:15.460> solder

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:16.150 
kind of perf board so I'll just solder

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:18.210 
kind of perf board so I'll just solder
it<00:07:16.360> to<00:07:16.570> a<00:07:16.600> couple<00:07:17.050> wires<00:07:17.230> and<00:07:17.650> we'll<00:07:18.040> see<00:07:18.190> if

it to a couple wires and we'll see if
