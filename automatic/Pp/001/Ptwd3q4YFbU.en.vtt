00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.509
 Did you ever stop to think it did not happen in the past? 

00:00:17.419 --> 00:00:19.859
 these steps are 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.279
 I trained today. You will learn here today. 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:24.710
 this easy way 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:26.220
 this Thursday in a bar 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.599
 season to taste this pedagogical instrument of the galley 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:32.829
 not having the asus done is that for him not 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.040
 the lousy juberty accomplices 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:42.100
 and it is precisely to do 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.100
 today the flower that the barÃ§a 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:00.040
 they believe the first child anyone to do any kind of 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:01.860
 anguish that has a texture 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.860
 painted pink 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.580
 Jose Ribamar 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:14.270
 that you will see biden if it is not it will be a wonder a little hand 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.300
 of income transfer as now 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.600
 abu dhabi but join the world over the armed hand 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.980
 I the Ecuadorians 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.420
 on the list of reasons for achieving this goal 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.600
 but what happened on Saturday 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.630
 a satisfaction in the eyes of those who lead 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.350
 I will not be able to enter the house because this level 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:43.050
 so let's wait for the end minutes of the selection at home wedding the kidneys 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.080
 are assigned 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:46.970
 the other three people 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.030
 I still do not know how to respect there I make goals 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:55.490
 which led the accused to say no at 65 was normalized in 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.510
 13 per paper 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:59.380
 the reform 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:00.570
 the forum 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.570
 with the change make us lose the charm 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:06.830
 let's solve 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.780
 the initiative gives about ten times the news a little more expensive but the 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.150
 longer durability is usually made for 

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:20.409
 president antonio navarro wolff month in santa rita we are doing very well 

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:22.919
 certainly the best proposal 

00:02:22.919 --> 00:02:24.209
 this season 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:25.969
 cut me down 

00:02:25.969 --> 00:02:30.599
 clear not marked by marcinho this is an example that I will not do well 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:35.329
 so coast had hair years they are shortening deadlines for seul 

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:37.699
 but if you want 

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:39.679
 the two tennis players 

00:02:39.679 --> 00:02:41.529
 I had 

00:02:41.529 --> 00:02:44.529
 godoy is already going to make the reading that is done 

00:02:50.719 --> 00:02:51.979
 I'll do what? 

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:54.979
 certain projects 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:00.349
 who access the makarova red rose section that you can 

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:04.309
 and April she takes care of the key 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:12.330
 to stay but in my life nest 

00:03:13.929 --> 00:03:16.929
 so you had a corruptor 

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:20.469
 with this is one more thing 

00:03:20.469 --> 00:03:23.469
 there to do what you want 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:29.510
 this question is the times when you can do what you want what you think 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.539
 but also for all manners it was realized that behind 

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:36.539
 but the big chance of you who made fortune with pac ii 

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:42.249
 the total trend to fab the game very good 

00:03:42.249 --> 00:03:46.799
 here is a good audience incredibly hard the whole life taison roth 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:49.799
 the vast majority of sectors that are 

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:57.559
 and will end the next step now is that I seek to know how to vote 

00:03:57.559 --> 00:03:59.009
 all in the right place 

00:03:59.009 --> 00:04:02.009
 I think I'll do it if you knew it was going to melissa. 

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:16.129
 the decision came after the crisis is not his 

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:18.509
 the ferry remembering that it will last 

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:23.090
 20h30 league dignity decided that the twilight saga eclipse 

00:04:24.099 --> 00:04:25.740
 this is enough 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.740
 he was forced to do the lateral said 

00:04:30.569 --> 00:04:32.909
