00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:46.989 
the computer but we'll see that in a

00:01:46.989 --> 00:01:49.729 
the computer but we'll see that in a
second<00:01:47.349> we'll<00:01:47.500> look<00:01:47.590> into<00:01:47.739> that<00:01:47.830> and<00:01:48.160> Center

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:49.739 
second we'll look into that and Center

00:01:49.739 --> 00:01:59.420 
second we'll look into that and Center
let's<00:01:50.739> take<00:01:50.979> a<00:01:51.009> look<00:01:51.250> at<00:01:51.489> the<00:01:51.759> dock<00:01:52.000> itself

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
computer even if it's closed now this

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.160 
computer even if it's closed now this
according<00:02:31.030> to<00:02:31.240> the<00:02:31.480> directions<00:02:31.870> is<00:02:32.470> a<00:02:32.950> laptop

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
according to the directions is a laptop

according to the directions is a laptop
undocking<00:02:35.170> request<00:02:35.890> button<00:02:36.190> so<00:02:36.520> I<00:02:36.550> assume<00:02:36.970> you

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
undocking request button so I assume you

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.120 
undocking request button so I assume you
have<00:02:37.209> to<00:02:37.300> press<00:02:37.630> that<00:02:37.930> to<00:02:38.500> communicate<00:02:38.950> to<00:02:39.040> the

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
have to press that to communicate to the

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.520 
have to press that to communicate to the
computer<00:02:39.610> before<00:02:40.030> you<00:02:40.480> can<00:02:40.780> pull<00:02:41.140> it<00:02:41.260> off<00:02:41.350> of

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
computer before you can pull it off of

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.199 
computer before you can pull it off of
the<00:02:41.590> dock<00:02:41.770> and<00:02:42.100> then<00:02:42.370> this<00:02:42.580> is<00:02:42.820> the<00:02:42.910> actual

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
the dock and then this is the actual

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.810 
the dock and then this is the actual
eject<00:02:43.660> button<00:02:44.020> so<00:02:44.680> it<00:02:44.770> actually<00:02:44.890> latches<00:02:45.520> into

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:45.820 
eject button so it actually latches into

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.910 
eject button so it actually latches into
the<00:02:46.060> dock<00:02:46.270> it's<00:02:46.540> not<00:02:46.720> something<00:02:47.140> that<00:02:47.320> comes

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
the dock it's not something that comes

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.199 
the dock it's not something that comes
off<00:02:48.130> easily<00:02:48.430> you<00:02:48.730> actually<00:02:49.060> have<00:02:49.150> to

so this dock increases on the

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.449 
so this dock increases on the
expandability<00:03:34.299> of<00:03:34.720> your<00:03:35.049> laptop<00:03:35.500> now<00:03:35.739> since

monitors<00:03:41.049> to<00:03:41.380> the<00:03:41.410> device<00:03:41.739> I<00:03:41.980> guess<00:03:42.340> it<00:03:42.459> all

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:42.580 
monitors to the device I guess it all

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:45.030 
monitors to the device I guess it all
depends<00:03:43.060> on<00:03:43.090> the<00:03:43.269> laptop<00:03:43.870> and<00:03:44.049> the<00:03:44.110> laptop<00:03:44.620> I

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
depends on the laptop and the laptop I

depends on the laptop and the laptop I
have<00:03:45.070> has<00:03:45.700> basically<00:03:46.330> Intel<00:03:47.170> integrated

have has basically Intel integrated

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.340 
have has basically Intel integrated
graphics<00:03:47.880> now<00:03:48.880> I<00:03:48.910> heard<00:03:49.360> bad<00:03:49.630> things<00:03:49.660> about

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:50.350 
graphics now I heard bad things about

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:53.070 
graphics now I heard bad things about
the<00:03:50.590> Nvidia<00:03:51.070> graphics<00:03:51.610> on<00:03:52.269> some<00:03:52.900> of<00:03:52.989> those

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:53.080 
the Nvidia graphics on some of those

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:54.990 
the Nvidia graphics on some of those
laptops<00:03:53.620> that<00:03:53.890> model<00:03:54.250> of<00:03:54.310> laptop<00:03:54.519> that<00:03:54.970> I

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
laptops that model of laptop that I

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.479 
laptops that model of laptop that I
bought<00:03:55.330> so<00:03:55.930> I<00:03:56.260> steered<00:03:56.650> clear<00:03:56.709> away<00:03:57.220> from

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:57.489 
bought so I steered clear away from

00:03:57.489 --> 00:03:59.600 
bought so I steered clear away from
anything<00:03:57.820> but<00:03:58.030> Intel<00:03:58.870> integrated<00:03:59.230> graphics

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
anything but Intel integrated graphics

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:01.979 
anything but Intel integrated graphics
so<00:04:00.610> we'll<00:04:00.730> see<00:04:00.910> if<00:04:01.000> that<00:04:01.150> works<00:04:01.360> out<00:04:01.570> for<00:04:01.840> me

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:01.989 
so we'll see if that works out for me

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:03.870 
so we'll see if that works out for me
now<00:04:02.440> I<00:04:02.470> don't<00:04:02.650> know<00:04:02.890> if<00:04:02.980> this<00:04:03.160> dock<00:04:03.459> is<00:04:03.730> going
