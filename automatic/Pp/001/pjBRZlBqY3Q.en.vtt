00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:48.610 
attention and raise funds for these

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:50.580 
attention and raise funds for these
children<00:04:49.180> in<00:04:49.449> Uganda<00:04:49.900> whose<00:04:50.050> lives<00:04:50.289> are<00:04:50.379> torn

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:50.590 
children in Uganda whose lives are torn

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:52.770 
children in Uganda whose lives are torn
apart<00:04:50.650> by<00:04:50.919> the<00:04:51.039> Ugandan<00:04:51.580> Civil<00:04:51.849> War<00:04:52.030> so<00:04:52.599> these

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:52.780 
apart by the Ugandan Civil War so these

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:55.080

00:04:57.149 --> 00:04:57.159 
the eyes of the public I guess and

00:04:57.159 --> 00:04:58.469 
the eyes of the public I guess and
they're<00:04:57.400> trying<00:04:57.639> to<00:04:57.699> make<00:04:57.789> them<00:04:58.090> visible<00:04:58.180> I

00:04:58.469 --> 00:04:58.479 
they're trying to make them visible I

00:04:58.479 --> 00:04:59.879 
they're trying to make them visible I
bring<00:04:58.659> it<00:04:58.810> raising<00:04:59.080> attention<00:04:59.469> to<00:04:59.560> them<00:04:59.710> and

00:04:59.879 --> 00:04:59.889 
bring it raising attention to them and

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:01.499 
bring it raising attention to them and
this<00:05:00.129> relates<00:05:00.310> to<00:05:00.639> what<00:05:00.940> we're<00:05:01.090> trying<00:05:01.270> to<00:05:01.360> do

00:05:20.249 --> 00:05:20.259 
taken so i had to settle with gamers for

00:05:20.259 --> 00:05:21.629 
taken so i had to settle with gamers for
change<00:05:20.500> which<00:05:20.889> it<00:05:21.129> just<00:05:21.279> sounds<00:05:21.490> really

00:05:21.629 --> 00:05:21.639
