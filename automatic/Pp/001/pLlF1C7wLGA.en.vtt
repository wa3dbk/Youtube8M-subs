00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
difficult it was quite a challenge and I

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.170 
difficult it was quite a challenge and I
would<00:01:18.920> kind<00:01:19.100> of<00:01:19.220> give<00:01:19.400> myself<00:01:19.610> these<00:01:19.940> little

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180 
would kind of give myself these little

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.810 
would kind of give myself these little
talks<00:01:20.330> instead<00:01:20.840> of<00:01:20.930> being<00:01:21.110> upset<00:01:21.230> about<00:01:22.100> my

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
talks instead of being upset about my

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.790 
talks instead of being upset about my
situation<00:01:23.060> constantly<00:01:23.960> once<00:01:24.170> in<00:01:24.320> a<00:01:24.380> while<00:01:24.530> I

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:24.800 
situation constantly once in a while I

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.270 
situation constantly once in a while I
would<00:01:25.220> relate<00:01:25.940> these<00:01:26.350> lessons<00:01:27.350> to<00:01:27.650> myself<00:01:27.830> and

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
would relate these lessons to myself and

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.860 
would relate these lessons to myself and
I<00:01:28.910> realized<00:01:29.360> that<00:01:29.750> if<00:01:30.380> I<00:01:30.590> feel<00:01:31.570> Christ's<00:01:32.570> light

know<00:01:36.950> I'm<00:01:37.160> going<00:01:37.340> in<00:01:37.550> the<00:01:37.640> right<00:01:37.760> direction

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
know I'm going in the right direction

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.770

but if I feel it on my back and it
starts<00:01:42.080> to<00:01:42.260> fade<00:01:42.550> then<00:01:43.550> I<00:01:43.580> know<00:01:43.700> I<00:01:43.850> need<00:01:44.150> to
