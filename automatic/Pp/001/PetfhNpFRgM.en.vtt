the prolific edge 540 of the age of 540

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.700 
the prolific edge 540 of the age of 540
you<00:00:18.240> know<00:00:18.359> was<00:00:18.510> originally<00:00:19.020> the<00:00:19.199> first<00:00:19.410> one

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
you know was originally the first one

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.609 
you know was originally the first one
prototype<00:00:20.340> was<00:00:20.490> built<00:00:20.520> in<00:00:20.820> 1993<00:00:21.420> it's<00:00:21.840> a<00:00:21.990> you

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
prototype was built in 1993 it's a you

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.259 
prototype was built in 1993 it's a you
know<00:00:22.650> I<00:00:22.740> started<00:00:23.519> out<00:00:23.640> its<00:00:23.789> life<00:00:23.970> as<00:00:24.150> an

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
know I started out its life as an

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.089 
know I started out its life as an
unlimited<00:00:24.570> aerobatic<00:00:25.289> airplane<00:00:25.680> now<00:00:25.830> they've

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
unlimited aerobatic airplane now they've

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.220 
unlimited aerobatic airplane now they've
changed<00:00:26.730> it<00:00:26.910> to<00:00:27.060> an<00:00:27.150> unlimited<00:00:27.420> race<00:00:27.779> airplane

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
changed it to an unlimited race airplane

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.050 
changed it to an unlimited race airplane
one<00:00:28.710> of<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:28.859> key<00:00:29.039> things<00:00:29.310> about<00:00:29.429> the<00:00:29.699> edge<00:00:29.789> 540

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
one of the key things about the edge 540

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.420 
one of the key things about the edge 540
is<00:00:30.480> its<00:00:30.689> modular<00:00:31.320> we<00:00:31.710> can<00:00:31.890> take<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.189> tail<00:00:32.399> off

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
is its modular we can take the tail off

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.190 
is its modular we can take the tail off
we<00:00:32.790> can<00:00:32.910> take<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.090> vertical<00:00:33.390> stabilizer<00:00:33.660> off

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
we can take the vertical stabilizer off

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.299 
we can take the vertical stabilizer off
the<00:00:34.350> wing<00:00:34.500> off<00:00:34.620> so<00:00:34.770> we<00:00:34.860> could<00:00:35.010> actually

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
the wing off so we could actually

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.970 
the wing off so we could actually
interchange<00:00:36.149> parts<00:00:36.420> and<00:00:36.750> make<00:00:36.899> better<00:00:37.140> parts

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
interchange parts and make better parts

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.380 
interchange parts and make better parts
on<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.250> airplane<00:00:38.579> they<00:00:38.820> are<00:00:38.940> falling<00:00:39.300> the

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
on the airplane they are falling the

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.240 
on the airplane they are falling the
edge<00:00:39.480> 540<00:00:39.750> it's<00:00:40.170> still<00:00:40.379> a<00:00:40.410> symmetrical

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
edge 540 it's still a symmetrical

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.369 
edge 540 it's still a symmetrical
therefore<00:00:41.700> which<00:00:41.910> means<00:00:42.180> it's<00:00:42.450> basically<00:00:43.170> the

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
therefore which means it's basically the

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.440 
therefore which means it's basically the
same<00:00:43.530> on<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:43.800> top<00:00:43.829> as<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.309> bottom<00:00:44.670> which

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
same on the top as the bottom which

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.510 
same on the top as the bottom which
would<00:00:45.690> be<00:00:45.809> you<00:00:46.140> know<00:00:46.230> great<00:00:46.500> for<00:00:46.530> aerobatic

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
would be you know great for aerobatic

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.180 
would be you know great for aerobatic
it's<00:00:47.670> probably<00:00:48.239> not<00:00:48.420> a<00:00:48.800> wing<00:00:49.800> that's<00:00:49.829> been

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
it's probably not a wing that's been

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.950 
it's probably not a wing that's been
optimized<00:00:50.700> for<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:51.000> Red<00:00:51.149> Bull<00:00:51.300> Air<00:00:51.480> Race<00:00:51.660> just

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
optimized for the Red Bull Air Race just

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.500 
optimized for the Red Bull Air Race just
yet<00:00:52.199> but<00:00:52.440> I<00:00:52.620> do<00:00:52.680> see<00:00:52.980> that<00:00:53.129> coming<00:00:53.520> the

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
yet but I do see that coming the

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.260 
yet but I do see that coming the
effective<00:00:55.260> extra<00:00:55.949> 300s<00:00:56.610> are<00:00:58.520> this<00:00:59.520> 10<00:01:00.090> it's

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
effective extra 300s are this 10 it's

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.260 
effective extra 300s are this 10 it's
very<00:01:00.510> it's<00:01:00.780> a<00:01:00.930> first<00:01:01.230> real<00:01:01.890> race<00:01:02.370> plane<00:01:02.760> and

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
very it's a first real race plane and

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.609 
very it's a first real race plane and
it's<00:01:03.989> a<00:01:04.199> from<00:01:04.799> its<00:01:04.949> prototype<00:01:05.689> and<00:01:06.689> it's<00:01:07.409> very

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
it's a from its prototype and it's very

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.920 
it's a from its prototype and it's very
nice<00:01:07.799> to<00:01:07.860> to<00:01:08.430> fly<00:01:08.610> with<00:01:08.820> this<00:01:08.970> pen<00:01:09.210> when<00:01:09.570> we

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
nice to to fly with this pen when we

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.469 
nice to to fly with this pen when we
want<00:01:10.200> to<00:01:10.320> do<00:01:10.560> a<00:01:10.590> very<00:01:10.920> short<00:01:11.070> short<00:01:11.790> register

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
want to do a very short short register

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.060 
want to do a very short short register
so<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.900> lycoming<00:01:13.380> 580<00:01:13.950> engine<00:01:14.400> and<00:01:16.070> it's

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
so the lycoming 580 engine and it's

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.800 
so the lycoming 580 engine and it's
quite<00:01:17.280> quite<00:01:17.700> big<00:01:17.880> engine<00:01:18.150> but<00:01:18.299> also<00:01:18.570> the

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
quite quite big engine but also the

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:19.640 
quite quite big engine but also the
plane<00:01:18.990> is<00:01:19.110> quite<00:01:19.350> heavy

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
plane is quite heavy

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.460 
plane is quite heavy
this<00:01:20.130> one<00:01:20.369> it's<00:01:20.640> only<00:01:21.210> with<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.540> unsymmetric

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
this one it's only with the unsymmetric

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.260 
this one it's only with the unsymmetric
wing<00:01:22.830> with<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.250> special<00:01:24.090> design<00:01:24.830> to<00:01:25.830> try<00:01:26.040> to

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
wing with the special design to try to

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.179 
wing with the special design to try to
do<00:01:27.270> a<00:01:27.299> special<00:01:27.630> turn<00:01:28.200> very<00:01:28.530> very<00:01:28.890> short

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
do a special turn very very short

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.980 
do a special turn very very short
register<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:30.450> aircraft

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
register the aircraft

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.649 
register the aircraft
everyone<00:01:31.409> is<00:01:31.530> talking<00:01:31.770> about<00:01:31.979> the<00:01:32.670> MX<00:01:33.090> s

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:34.659 
everyone is talking about the MX s

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:36.389 
everyone is talking about the MX s
there's<00:01:35.290> not<00:01:35.380> a<00:01:35.439> huge<00:01:35.710> amount<00:01:35.770> you<00:01:36.070> can<00:01:36.189> do<00:01:36.369> I

00:01:36.389 --> 00:01:36.399 
there's not a huge amount you can do I

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:39.660 
there's not a huge amount you can do I
think<00:01:36.549> to<00:01:36.880> the<00:01:37.000> mxs<00:01:37.450> to<00:01:38.439> modify<00:01:39.159> it<00:01:39.219> for<00:01:39.369> racing

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:39.670 
think to the mxs to modify it for racing

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:41.130 
think to the mxs to modify it for racing
because<00:01:39.880> it<00:01:40.000> already<00:01:40.210> was<00:01:40.600> a<00:01:40.630> very<00:01:40.930> clean

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.140 
because it already was a very clean

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.200 
because it already was a very clean
airplane<00:01:41.590> if<00:01:41.890> you<00:01:42.009> get<00:01:42.310> pretty<00:01:42.820> much<00:01:42.970> around

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.210 
airplane if you get pretty much around

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.120 
airplane if you get pretty much around
220<00:01:43.630> knots<00:01:43.750> threat<00:01:44.079> level<00:01:44.380> which<00:01:44.530> is<00:01:44.710> which<00:01:44.979> is

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
220 knots threat level which is which is

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.520 
220 knots threat level which is which is
quick<00:01:45.490> it<00:01:45.820> looks<00:01:46.060> clean<00:01:46.420> great<00:01:46.899> lines<00:01:47.170> but

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:47.530 
quick it looks clean great lines but

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:49.260 
quick it looks clean great lines but
slightly<00:01:47.979> aggressive<00:01:48.159> in<00:01:48.490> my<00:01:48.640> opponent<00:01:49.060> view

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
slightly aggressive in my opponent view

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:50.639 
slightly aggressive in my opponent view
so<00:01:49.509> you<00:01:49.539> know<00:01:49.929> it<00:01:50.049> looks<00:01:50.200> the<00:01:50.320> part

00:01:50.639 --> 00:01:50.649 
so you know it looks the part

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:52.830 
so you know it looks the part
it<00:01:50.799> handles<00:01:51.220> incredibly<00:01:51.640> well<00:01:51.820> it's<00:01:52.570> quicker

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
it handles incredibly well it's quicker

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.359 
it handles incredibly well it's quicker
