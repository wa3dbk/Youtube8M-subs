things then try to see we could learn a
little<00:00:30.660> bit<00:00:30.810> about<00:00:30.990> walls<00:00:31.260> tumbles<00:00:32.130> and<00:00:32.750> some

waterfalls also okay it's a really

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.799 
waterfalls also okay it's a really
simple<00:00:36.870> maneuver<00:00:37.410> to<00:00:37.530> do<00:00:37.680> it's<00:00:38.040> very<00:00:38.809> thick

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
simple maneuver to do it's very thick

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.330 
simple maneuver to do it's very thick
wise<00:00:39.989> stick<00:00:40.500> movement<00:00:40.890> it's<00:00:40.980> not<00:00:41.010> very

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
wise stick movement it's not very

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.430 
wise stick movement it's not very
complicated<00:00:41.700> but<00:00:42.480> it<00:00:42.600> has<00:00:42.719> a<00:00:42.750> lot<00:00:42.989> of<00:00:43.020> good<00:00:43.260> wow

crosswind that's going diagonal to the
runway<00:00:55.219> alright<00:00:56.219> so<00:00:56.629> pre-flight<00:00:57.629> routine<00:00:58.020> as

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:15.280 

all<00:01:10.920> right<00:01:12.380> let's<00:01:13.380> talk<00:01:13.770> about<00:01:14.100> the<00:01:14.850> wall

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290 
all right let's talk about the wall

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.590 
all right let's talk about the wall
walls<00:01:16.290> nothing<00:01:16.560> morning<00:01:17.070> is<00:01:17.189> yanking<00:01:17.579> back<00:01:18.390> at

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
walls nothing morning is yanking back at

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.620 
walls nothing morning is yanking back at
your<00:01:18.780> stick<00:01:19.020> you<00:01:19.920> come<00:01:20.130> in<00:01:20.310> with<00:01:20.759> certain<00:01:21.270> -

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
your stick you come in with certain -

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.780 
your stick you come in with certain -
speed<00:01:22.640> that's<00:01:23.640> it

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:25.790 
speed that's it

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.310 
speed that's it
and<00:01:26.790> then<00:01:27.330> you<00:01:27.480> could<00:01:27.630> do<00:01:27.750> a<00:01:27.780> couple<00:01:27.930> of<00:01:28.110> things

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
and then you could do a couple of things

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.530 
and then you could do a couple of things
with<00:01:28.500> it<00:01:28.530> you<00:01:28.770> could<00:01:28.920> try<00:01:29.910> to<00:01:29.970> get<00:01:30.240> it<00:01:30.360> into

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
with it you could try to get it into

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.660 
with it you could try to get it into
hover<00:01:32.600> or<00:01:33.600> you<00:01:33.960> could<00:01:34.200> just<00:01:34.470> fly<00:01:35.010> out<00:01:35.190> after

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
hover or you could just fly out after

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:41.350 
hover or you could just fly out after
you<00:01:35.880> establish<00:01:36.560> a<00:01:38.780> couple<00:01:39.780> of<00:01:39.870> things<00:01:40.020> to<00:01:40.200> help

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
you establish a couple of things to help

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.940 
you establish a couple of things to help
if<00:01:42.360> your<00:01:42.540> model<00:01:42.960> doesn't<00:01:43.140> pitch<00:01:43.440> very<00:01:43.740> well

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
if your model doesn't pitch very well

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:51.930 
if your model doesn't pitch very well
like<00:01:46.280> this<00:01:47.280> Lake<00:01:47.550> does

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:51.940 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:55.210 

when<00:01:52.940> you're<00:01:53.150> doing<00:01:53.510> a<00:01:53.690> wall<00:01:53.900> you<00:01:54.470> try<00:01:54.770> to<00:01:54.830> add

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:55.220 
when you're doing a wall you try to add

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.670 
when you're doing a wall you try to add
a<00:01:55.250> little<00:01:55.640> bit<00:01:55.820> more<00:01:55.850> throng<00:01:56.510> as<00:01:57.350> you're

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:57.680 
a little bit more throng as you're

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.110 
a little bit more throng as you're
pulling<00:01:57.920> it<00:01:58.160> that<00:01:58.400> way<00:01:58.580> it<00:01:58.700> gives<00:01:58.880> it<00:01:59.090> that

00:01:59.110 --> 00:01:59.120 
pulling it that way it gives it that

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:12.000 
pulling it that way it gives it that
extra<00:02:00.100> pitch<00:02:01.100> Authority<00:02:01.760> that<00:02:02.060> you<00:02:02.300> need

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.170 

couple<00:02:13.010> of<00:02:13.070> things<00:02:13.280> if<00:02:13.490> you're<00:02:13.730> thinking

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
couple of things if you're thinking

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.180 
couple of things if you're thinking
about<00:02:14.300> hovering<00:02:15.140> after<00:02:15.470> you're<00:02:15.650> doing<00:02:15.920> a<00:02:15.980> wall

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
about hovering after you're doing a wall

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:17.830 
about hovering after you're doing a wall
and<00:02:16.670> you<00:02:16.940> want<00:02:16.970> to<00:02:17.150> come<00:02:17.300> pretty<00:02:17.540> slow

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
and you want to come pretty slow

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.930 
and you want to come pretty slow
otherwise<00:02:18.350> all<00:02:18.950> that<00:02:19.250> energy<00:02:19.760> gets

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
otherwise all that energy gets

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:25.390 
otherwise all that energy gets
transferred<00:02:20.330> into<00:02:20.750> vertical<00:02:22.720> height<00:02:24.400> so

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
transferred into vertical height so

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.740 
transferred into vertical height so
you're<00:02:25.520> come<00:02:25.700> in<00:02:25.820> a<00:02:25.910> little<00:02:26.120> slow<00:02:26.330> like<00:02:26.570> this

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
you're come in a little slow like this

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.260 
you're come in a little slow like this
but<00:02:27.020> you<00:02:27.140> get<00:02:27.290> this<00:02:27.530> Authority<00:02:28.340> you<00:02:28.459> need<00:02:28.640> you

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270 
but you get this Authority you need you

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:32.580 
but you get this Authority you need you
pop<00:02:29.570> it<00:02:29.750> in<00:02:29.920> some<00:02:30.920> throttle<00:02:31.160> there<00:02:31.850> you<00:02:31.970> go

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
pop it in some throttle there you go

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.370 
pop it in some throttle there you go
and<00:02:33.590> then<00:02:33.800> you're<00:02:33.980> ready<00:02:34.220> to<00:02:34.310> hover<00:02:35.380> maybe

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:36.380 
and then you're ready to hover maybe

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:41.050 
and then you're ready to hover maybe
even<00:02:37.720> till<00:02:38.720> touched<00:02:39.370> all<00:02:40.370> right<00:02:40.610> so<00:02:40.880> that's

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
even till touched all right so that's

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.910 
even till touched all right so that's
the<00:02:41.330> wall

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
the wall

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.460 
the wall
simply<00:02:42.920> put<00:02:43.300> all<00:02:44.300> right<00:02:44.360> if<00:02:44.510> you're<00:02:44.750> just

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
simply put all right if you're just

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.340 
simply put all right if you're just
trying<00:02:45.739> to<00:02:45.940> pop<00:02:46.940> it<00:02:47.120> off<00:02:47.269> real<00:02:47.480> fast<00:02:47.510> make<00:02:48.019> sure

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:48.350 
trying to pop it off real fast make sure

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.470 
trying to pop it off real fast make sure
your<00:02:48.590> air<00:02:48.769> frame<00:02:49.010> can<00:02:49.190> handle<00:02:49.430> it<00:02:49.610> real<00:02:50.239> fast

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
your air frame can handle it real fast

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:58.120 
your air frame can handle it real fast
pop<00:02:51.190> and<00:02:52.190> then<00:02:52.370> you<00:02:53.260> go<00:02:54.260> inverted<00:02:56.920> when<00:02:57.920> you're

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:58.130 
pop and then you go inverted when you're

pop and then you go inverted when you're
trying<00:02:58.610> to<00:02:58.760> do<00:02:58.940> a<00:02:58.970> wall<00:03:00.940> if<00:03:01.940> you<00:03:02.239> do<00:03:02.480> it<00:03:02.660> into

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
trying to do a wall if you do it into

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.009 
trying to do a wall if you do it into
the<00:03:03.560> wind<00:03:03.799> the<00:03:04.040> result<00:03:04.730> is<00:03:04.910> going<00:03:05.570> to<00:03:05.660> be<00:03:05.750> more

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:06.019 
the wind the result is going to be more

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:07.810 
the wind the result is going to be more
impressive<00:03:06.410> wall<00:03:06.709> because<00:03:07.220> you've<00:03:07.430> got<00:03:07.640> the

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:07.820 
impressive wall because you've got the

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:13.180 
impressive wall because you've got the
the<00:03:08.540> airspeed<00:03:08.989> morphing<00:03:09.470> for<00:03:09.739> you<00:03:11.769> and<00:03:12.769> don't

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
the airspeed morphing for you and don't

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.060 
the airspeed morphing for you and don't
forget<00:03:13.370> to<00:03:13.820> really<00:03:14.299> slam<00:03:14.660> the<00:03:14.870> stick<00:03:15.170> you<00:03:15.920> have

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:16.070 
forget to really slam the stick you have

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:23.510 
forget to really slam the stick you have
to<00:03:16.280> do<00:03:16.459> it<00:03:16.610> right<00:03:17.739> you<00:03:18.739> cut<00:03:19.010> out

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:23.520 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.630 

there<00:03:24.030> you<00:03:24.180> go<00:03:24.330> brought<00:03:24.660> it<00:03:24.810> in<00:03:24.930> to<00:03:25.080> hover<00:03:25.290> and

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:25.640 
there you go brought it in to hover and

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:29.630 
there you go brought it in to hover and
blast<00:03:26.640> out<00:03:28.040> let<00:03:29.040> me<00:03:29.130> show<00:03:29.280> you<00:03:29.340> what<00:03:29.520> I'm

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
blast out let me show you what I'm

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:31.910 
blast out let me show you what I'm
talking<00:03:29.970> about<00:03:30.050> if<00:03:31.050> you're<00:03:31.230> going<00:03:31.470> with<00:03:31.590> the

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
talking about if you're going with the

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:39.900 
talking about if you're going with the
wind

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:41.760 

and<00:03:40.450> especially<00:03:40.960> if<00:03:41.050> you're<00:03:41.170> not<00:03:41.320> adding<00:03:41.680> the

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:41.770 
and especially if you're not adding the

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:46.350 
and especially if you're not adding the
throttle<00:03:44.010> I'll<00:03:45.010> never<00:03:45.250> mind<00:03:45.610> the<00:03:45.940> slick<00:03:46.210> has

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:46.360 
throttle I'll never mind the slick has

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.710 
throttle I'll never mind the slick has
enough<00:03:46.600> fish<00:03:46.780> authority<00:03:47.260> to<00:03:47.380> do<00:03:47.530> it<00:03:48.720> that

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
enough fish authority to do it that

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.510 
enough fish authority to do it that
lacks<00:03:50.020> some<00:03:50.320> pitch<00:03:50.500> Authority<00:03:50.950> or<00:03:51.100> if<00:03:51.310> they're

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:51.520 
lacks some pitch Authority or if they're

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:52.620 
lacks some pitch Authority or if they're
severely<00:03:51.910> nose-heavy

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
severely nose-heavy

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:54.180 
severely nose-heavy
you're<00:03:53.230> not<00:03:53.380> going<00:03:53.500> to<00:03:53.560> be<00:03:53.650> able<00:03:53.710> to<00:03:53.860> pull<00:03:54.070> that

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
you're not going to be able to pull that

00:03:54.190 --> 00:04:01.080 
you're not going to be able to pull that
off<00:03:54.340> very<00:03:54.640> cleanly<00:03:57.540> again<00:03:58.540> throttle<00:03:59.140> and<00:04:00.090> that

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090 
off very cleanly again throttle and that

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.950 
off very cleanly again throttle and that
gives<00:04:01.330> you<00:04:01.480> the<00:04:01.660> nice<00:04:01.870> jump<00:04:02.650> all<00:04:03.640> right<00:04:03.960> now

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:04.960 
gives you the nice jump all right now

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:07.320 
gives you the nice jump all right now
we're<00:04:05.110> going<00:04:05.200> to<00:04:05.260> do<00:04:05.440> some<00:04:05.830> tumbling<00:04:06.730> and<00:04:07.120> some

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:07.330 
we're going to do some tumbling and some

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:13.950 
we're going to do some tumbling and some
waterfall<00:04:11.790> my<00:04:12.790> favorite<00:04:13.240> one<00:04:13.390> is<00:04:13.600> when<00:04:13.810> they

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:13.960 
waterfall my favorite one is when they

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:21.150 
waterfall my favorite one is when they
go<00:04:14.110> inverted<00:04:14.970> slam<00:04:15.970> the<00:04:16.180> sticks<00:04:16.450> to<00:04:16.660> do<00:04:20.160> and

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160 
go inverted slam the sticks to do and

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.180 
go inverted slam the sticks to do and
again<00:04:21.459> when<00:04:21.640> you<00:04:21.730> do<00:04:21.850> that<00:04:22.590> let<00:04:23.590> the<00:04:23.770> wind<00:04:23.980> be

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.190 
again when you do that let the wind be

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:29.090 
again when you do that let the wind be
your<00:04:24.400> friend<00:04:24.720> meaning<00:04:25.720> do<00:04:26.380> it<00:04:26.530> into<00:04:26.920> the<00:04:27.040> wind

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.100 
your friend meaning do it into the wind

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:34.610 
your friend meaning do it into the wind
one<00:04:30.100> more<00:04:30.280> time

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:36.660 

there<00:04:35.620> are<00:04:35.710> many<00:04:35.890> ways<00:04:36.130> that<00:04:36.160> tumble

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:36.670 
there are many ways that tumble

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:38.970 
there are many ways that tumble
basically<00:04:37.240> tumbling<00:04:37.750> is<00:04:37.810> nothing<00:04:38.140> more<00:04:38.320> than

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:38.980 
basically tumbling is nothing more than

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:40.740 
basically tumbling is nothing more than
banging<00:04:39.490> the<00:04:39.610> sticks<00:04:39.850> all<00:04:40.120> the<00:04:40.360> way<00:04:40.450> to<00:04:40.510> the

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:40.750 
banging the sticks all the way to the

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:52.530 
banging the sticks all the way to the
corner<00:04:43.110> see<00:04:44.110> that<00:04:50.640> same<00:04:51.640> direction<00:04:51.850> you're

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:52.540 
corner see that same direction you're

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:59.130 
corner see that same direction you're
essentially<00:04:53.080> doing<00:04:57.270> however<00:04:58.270> you're<00:04:58.810> going

00:04:59.130 --> 00:04:59.140 
essentially doing however you're going

00:04:59.140 --> 00:04:59.670 
essentially doing however you're going
the<00:04:59.260> other<00:04:59.290> way

00:04:59.670 --> 00:04:59.680 
the other way

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.640 
the other way
inverted<00:05:00.220> then<00:05:00.460> you<00:05:00.760> go<00:05:00.880> to<00:05:00.940> the<00:05:01.030> opposite<00:05:01.450> way

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:01.650 
inverted then you go to the opposite way

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:04.410 
inverted then you go to the opposite way
the<00:05:02.650> other<00:05:02.800> thing<00:05:03.100> that<00:05:03.130> helps<00:05:03.460> also<00:05:03.790> is<00:05:04.090> by

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:04.420 
the other thing that helps also is by

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:06.510 
the other thing that helps also is by
taking<00:05:05.170> out<00:05:05.290> the<00:05:05.440> throttle<00:05:05.680> at<00:05:05.950> the<00:05:06.010> moment<00:05:06.430> of

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:06.520 
taking out the throttle at the moment of

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:10.140 
taking out the throttle at the moment of
your<00:05:06.960> tumbling<00:05:08.610> you're<00:05:09.610> preventing<00:05:10.060> the

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:10.150 
your tumbling you're preventing the

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:12.270 
your tumbling you're preventing the
motor<00:05:10.390> from<00:05:10.690> the<00:05:11.530> spinning<00:05:11.890> motor<00:05:12.070> and

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:12.280 
motor from the spinning motor and

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:20.090 
motor from the spinning motor and
spinning<00:05:12.700> propeller<00:05:13.380> slowing<00:05:14.380> you<00:05:14.500> down

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:20.100 

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:21.800 

let<00:05:20.760> me<00:05:20.880> show<00:05:21.000> you<00:05:21.090> what<00:05:21.270> happens<00:05:21.600> if<00:05:21.660> you

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:21.810 
let me show you what happens if you

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:26.780 
let me show you what happens if you
don't<00:05:24.290> see<00:05:25.290> when<00:05:25.740> the<00:05:25.860> motor<00:05:26.070> is<00:05:26.160> on<00:05:26.460> the

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:26.790 
don't see when the motor is on the

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:32.000 
don't see when the motor is on the
result<00:05:27.180> is<00:05:27.420> not<00:05:27.720> as<00:05:27.900> crisp<00:05:30.620> you<00:05:31.620> could<00:05:31.800> do<00:05:31.920> it

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:32.010 
result is not as crisp you could do it

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:39.980 
result is not as crisp you could do it
from<00:05:32.220> a<00:05:32.310> knife<00:05:32.520> edge<00:05:32.730> position<00:05:38.210> holy<00:05:39.210> cow<00:05:39.600> I

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:39.990 
from a knife edge position holy cow I

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:41.600 
from a knife edge position holy cow I
haven't<00:05:40.620> done<00:05:40.710> that<00:05:40.770> before<00:05:41.190> it<00:05:41.280> now<00:05:41.370> looks

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:41.610 
haven't done that before it now looks

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:47.709 
haven't done that before it now looks
really<00:05:41.940> good

00:05:47.709 --> 00:05:47.719 

00:05:47.719 --> 00:05:51.409 

and<00:05:48.719> again<00:05:48.990> you<00:05:49.409> could<00:05:49.589> try<00:05:49.770> a<00:05:49.800> knife-edge<00:05:50.419> do

00:05:51.409 --> 00:05:51.419 
and again you could try a knife-edge do

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:53.950 
and again you could try a knife-edge do
it<00:05:51.569> up<00:05:51.779> right

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:53.960 

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:58.760 

as<00:05:54.960> you<00:05:55.229> may<00:05:55.379> notice<00:05:56.240> most<00:05:57.240> airplanes<00:05:57.770> slick

00:05:58.760 --> 00:05:58.770 
as you may notice most airplanes slick

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:03.520 
as you may notice most airplanes slick
included

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:03.530 

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:06.920 

will<00:06:04.530> tumble<00:06:04.770> more<00:06:05.100> readily<00:06:05.460> inverted<00:06:06.090> and<00:06:06.270> so

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:06.930 
will tumble more readily inverted and so

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:08.540 
will tumble more readily inverted and so
if<00:06:07.530> you're<00:06:07.710> going<00:06:07.860> to<00:06:07.920> be<00:06:08.010> doing<00:06:08.190> a<00:06:08.370> lot<00:06:08.490> of

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:08.550 
if you're going to be doing a lot of

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:10.640 
if you're going to be doing a lot of
hard<00:06:08.880> tumbles<00:06:09.330> aside<00:06:09.810> from<00:06:09.990> making<00:06:10.170> sure<00:06:10.320> your

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:10.650 
hard tumbles aside from making sure your

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:13.130 
hard tumbles aside from making sure your
airplanes<00:06:11.130> can<00:06:11.310> actually<00:06:11.730> do<00:06:11.910> it<00:06:12.060> is<00:06:12.210> make

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:13.140 
airplanes can actually do it is make

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:15.080 
airplanes can actually do it is make
sure<00:06:13.320> you've<00:06:13.560> gotten<00:06:13.950> a<00:06:14.040> battery<00:06:14.490> strap<00:06:14.850> there

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:15.090 
sure you've gotten a battery strap there

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:17.240 
sure you've gotten a battery strap there
or<00:06:15.300> else<00:06:15.570> you'll<00:06:16.200> get<00:06:16.350> a<00:06:16.410> battery<00:06:16.770> ejection

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:17.250 
or else you'll get a battery ejection

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:21.770 
or else you'll get a battery ejection
and<00:06:17.430> that'll<00:06:18.150> be<00:06:18.240> the<00:06:18.360> end<00:06:18.390> of<00:06:18.600> your<00:06:18.750> flight<00:06:20.780> so

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:21.780

otherwise not going to be clean there

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:04.430 
otherwise not going to be clean there
you<00:06:59.490> go<00:07:00.860> see<00:07:01.860> that's<00:07:02.220> one<00:07:02.490> rotation<00:07:03.440> assuming

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:04.440 
you go see that's one rotation assuming

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:06.950 
you go see that's one rotation assuming
you've<00:07:04.560> got<00:07:04.770> enough<00:07:05.070> height<00:07:05.310> you<00:07:06.300> can<00:07:06.480> keep

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:06.960 
you've got enough height you can keep

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:08.200 
you've got enough height you can keep
doing<00:07:07.200> that<00:07:07.440> again

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:08.210 
doing that again

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:21.600 
that because I tend to cheat into the

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:24.400 
that because I tend to cheat into the
knife<00:07:21.810> edge<00:07:22.020> when<00:07:22.260> I<00:07:22.350> do<00:07:22.560> that<00:07:22.770> anyway<00:07:23.190> so

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:24.410 
knife edge when I do that anyway so

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:26.300 
knife edge when I do that anyway so

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:28.410 
into a knife edge you add some left

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:32.720 
into a knife edge you add some left
aileron<00:07:28.620> to<00:07:29.370> help<00:07:29.610> with<00:07:29.820> that<00:07:31.040> so<00:07:32.040> this<00:07:32.580> would

make another good knife edge entry do

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:49.420 
make another good knife edge entry do
this<00:07:37.100> do<00:07:38.100> that<00:07:40.970> all<00:07:41.970> right<00:07:42.240> time<00:07:42.540> to<00:07:42.570> land
