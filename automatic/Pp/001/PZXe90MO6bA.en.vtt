this grudge match for two very important
reasons<00:06:15.240> for<00:06:16.199> one<00:06:16.410> it<00:06:17.370> could<00:06:17.729> be<00:06:17.910> said<00:06:18.180> that

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:18.210 
reasons for one it could be said that

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:21.170 
reasons for one it could be said that
solomon<00:06:18.690> grundy<00:06:19.020> might<00:06:19.349> be<00:06:19.620> more<00:06:20.250> physically

00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:21.180 
solomon grundy might be more physically

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:24.529 
solomon grundy might be more physically
powerful<00:06:21.500> than<00:06:22.500> Red<00:06:22.860> Hulk<00:06:23.330> because<00:06:24.330> where

00:06:24.529 --> 00:06:24.539 
powerful than Red Hulk because where

00:06:24.539 --> 00:06:26.540 
powerful than Red Hulk because where
solomon<00:06:25.020> grundy<00:06:25.349> has<00:06:25.500> been<00:06:25.680> able<00:06:25.830> to<00:06:26.160> match

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:26.550 
solomon grundy has been able to match

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:30.050 
solomon grundy has been able to match
Superman<00:06:27.300> Red<00:06:28.080> Hulk<00:06:28.260> is<00:06:28.470> not<00:06:29.010> as<00:06:29.280> powerful<00:06:29.550> as

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:30.060 
Superman Red Hulk is not as powerful as

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:31.159 
Superman Red Hulk is not as powerful as
the<00:06:30.120> Incredible<00:06:30.810> Hulk

00:06:31.159 --> 00:06:31.169 
the Incredible Hulk

00:06:31.169 --> 00:06:33.740 
the Incredible Hulk
so<00:06:31.620> it<00:06:32.340> could<00:06:32.610> be<00:06:32.639> said<00:06:33.000> that<00:06:33.030> Solomon<00:06:33.300> Grundy

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:33.750 
so it could be said that Solomon Grundy

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:35.779 
so it could be said that Solomon Grundy
might<00:06:34.020> be<00:06:34.229> more<00:06:34.530> physically<00:06:34.979> powerful<00:06:35.159> but

00:06:35.779 --> 00:06:35.789 
might be more physically powerful but

00:06:35.789 --> 00:06:38.899 
might be more physically powerful but
his<00:06:36.570> strength<00:06:36.900> is<00:06:37.110> not<00:06:37.229> consistent<00:06:37.909> sometime

his strength is not consistent sometime

00:06:38.909 --> 00:06:41.540 
his strength is not consistent sometime
solomon<00:06:39.479> grundy<00:06:39.780> is<00:06:39.990> strong<00:06:40.320> enough<00:06:40.590> to<00:06:41.370> face

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:41.550 
solomon grundy is strong enough to face

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:43.310 
solomon grundy is strong enough to face
superhumanly<00:06:42.210> strong<00:06:42.270> characters<00:06:43.050> other

times his strength is really scaled down

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:48.740 
times his strength is really scaled down
so<00:06:46.590> you<00:06:46.650> can't<00:06:47.159> tell<00:06:47.370> at<00:06:47.550> any<00:06:47.669> given<00:06:47.880> time<00:06:48.180> what
