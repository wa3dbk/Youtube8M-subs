00:00:09.089 --> 00:00:14.119 
the oil and gas compressors as you can
see<00:00:09.209> it's<00:00:09.360> open<00:00:09.539> at<00:00:09.839> the<00:00:09.900> moment<00:00:12.469> well<00:00:13.469> I'm

kind<00:00:41.340> of<00:00:41.370> stuff<00:00:41.580> industrial<00:00:42.830> purposes<00:00:44.090> so<00:00:45.090> I

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:45.500 
kind of stuff industrial purposes so I

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.660 
kind of stuff industrial purposes so I
these<00:00:46.500> I<00:00:46.920> put<00:00:47.550> a<00:00:47.580> few<00:00:47.760> of<00:00:47.850> them

these I put a few of them
most<00:00:50.670> kind<00:00:50.880> is<00:00:51.150> so<00:00:51.920> confusion<00:00:52.920> and<00:00:53.370> I<00:00:54.710> put<00:00:55.710> a

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:55.740 
most kind is so confusion and I put a

00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:01.420 
most kind is so confusion and I put a
lot<00:00:56.160> of<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.580> year<00:00:57.110> smallest<00:00:58.110> ones<00:00:58.350> this<00:00:58.950> one

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:08.500 

I'll<00:01:02.430> put<00:01:02.610> it<00:01:02.820> in<00:01:03.060> here<00:01:03.450> and<00:01:05.360> the<00:01:06.360> progress

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:08.510 
I'll put it in here and the progress

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.870 
I'll put it in here and the progress
that's<00:01:09.510> not<00:01:09.720> a<00:01:09.750> problem<00:01:10.490> and<00:01:11.490> as<00:01:11.640> you<00:01:11.760> can<00:01:11.820> see

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
that's not a problem and as you can see

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.270 
that's not a problem and as you can see
it<00:01:12.090> completely<00:01:12.270> flattened<00:01:14.210> in<00:01:15.210> this<00:01:15.420> cost<00:01:16.280> see

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
it completely flattened in this cost see

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:23.090 
it completely flattened in this cost see
the<00:01:17.400> ball<00:01:17.580> so<00:01:17.790> it<00:01:18.950> does<00:01:21.409> yeah<00:01:22.440> I'm<00:01:22.890> really

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
the ball so it does yeah I'm really

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.630 
the ball so it does yeah I'm really
hoping<00:01:23.520> this<00:01:23.670> is<00:01:23.850> going<00:01:24.570> to<00:01:24.659> see<00:01:24.840> what<00:01:25.520> do<00:01:26.520> it

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
hoping this is going to see what do it

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.490 
hoping this is going to see what do it
for<00:01:26.820> wonderful<00:01:30.020> cause<00:01:31.020> it's<00:01:31.200> looking<00:01:31.470> a

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
for wonderful cause it's looking a

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.240 
for wonderful cause it's looking a
little<00:01:31.590> bit<00:01:31.800> ugly<00:01:32.990> maybe<00:01:33.990> have<00:01:34.260> to<00:01:34.470> redo<00:01:35.040> this

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
little bit ugly maybe have to redo this

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.800 
little bit ugly maybe have to redo this
so<00:01:35.970> I<00:01:36.860> will<00:01:37.860> have<00:01:38.130> to<00:01:38.250> redo<00:01:38.460> this<00:01:38.640> little<00:01:39.479> bit

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
so I will have to redo this little bit

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.940 
so I will have to redo this little bit
little<00:01:39.930> good<00:01:40.460> so<00:01:41.460> as<00:01:42.240> a<00:01:42.540> trade-off<00:01:42.950> good

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
little good so as a trade-off good

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.190 
little good so as a trade-off good
opportunities<00:01:44.640> material<00:01:45.150> change<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.600> change

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
opportunities material change the change

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.860 
opportunities material change the change
the<00:01:46.260> oil<00:01:46.380> is<00:01:47.190> you<00:01:47.460> okay<00:01:47.850> Nora<00:01:48.060> versus<00:01:48.420> Katina

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:48.870 
the oil is you okay Nora versus Katina

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:53.060 
the oil is you okay Nora versus Katina
contains<00:01:49.590> some<00:01:50.420> some<00:01:51.420> of<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:51.600> buoy<00:01:51.840> and<00:01:52.260> the

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
contains some some of the buoy and the

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.520 
contains some some of the buoy and the
bottom<00:01:53.370> there<00:01:53.549> but<00:01:53.900> most

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.400 

and<00:01:58.790> well<00:01:59.790> thing<00:02:00.420> that's<00:02:00.600> worrying<00:02:01.020> me<00:02:01.260> the

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:01.410 
and well thing that's worrying me the

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:03.950 
and well thing that's worrying me the
most<00:02:01.650> is<00:02:01.950> this<00:02:02.400> little<00:02:02.730> these<00:02:03.480> little<00:02:03.750> pieces

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
most is this little these little pieces

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:11.810 
most is this little these little pieces
of<00:02:04.380> metal<00:02:05.960> actually<00:02:06.960> a<00:02:06.990> magnetic<00:02:08.690> 50<00:02:10.370> so<00:02:11.370> I<00:02:11.400> am

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:11.820 
of metal actually a magnetic 50 so I am

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.540 
of metal actually a magnetic 50 so I am
in<00:02:12.630> order<00:02:12.810> to<00:02:12.930> get<00:02:13.080> them<00:02:13.230> out<00:02:13.350> i<00:02:13.430> encode<00:02:14.430> the

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
in order to get them out i encode the

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.920 
in order to get them out i encode the
school<00:02:14.790> oliver<00:02:16.130> magnetized<00:02:17.130> it<00:02:17.340> up<00:02:17.490> with<00:02:17.640> it

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
school oliver magnetized it up with it

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.600 
school oliver magnetized it up with it
just<00:02:18.930> we<00:02:19.110> do<00:02:19.170> then<00:02:19.380> and<00:02:19.560> the<00:02:20.130> two<00:02:20.310> little

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
just we do then and the two little

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.050 
just we do then and the two little
pieces<00:02:21.030> out<00:02:21.330> there<00:02:21.660> is<00:02:22.590> an<00:02:22.740> obvious<00:02:23.060> plenty

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
pieces out there is an obvious plenty

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.760 
pieces out there is an obvious plenty
once<00:02:24.500> again<00:02:25.500> if<00:02:25.590> that<00:02:25.620> guy<00:02:25.890> was<00:02:26.040> in<00:02:26.160> 3d<00:02:26.340> an

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:27.770 
once again if that guy was in 3d an

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.490 
once again if that guy was in 3d an
instruction<00:02:28.770> buy<00:02:28.920> beers<00:02:29.510> and<00:02:30.510> get<00:02:30.750> summed<00:02:31.440> up

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
instruction buy beers and get summed up

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.979 
instruction buy beers and get summed up
by<00:02:31.650> the<00:02:31.709> professor<00:02:32.070> itself<00:02:32.630> it's<00:02:33.630> but<00:02:33.840> it's

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
by the professor itself it's but it's

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:36.110 
by the professor itself it's but it's
likely<00:02:34.230> it<00:02:34.830> will<00:02:34.980> never<00:02:35.160> happen<00:02:35.430> because<00:02:35.850> it's

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
likely it will never happen because it's

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.720 
likely it will never happen because it's
in<00:02:36.360> the<00:02:36.450> bottom<00:02:36.720> to<00:02:37.650> create<00:02:37.739> from<00:02:38.100> on<00:02:38.220> all<00:02:38.489> the

oil is in slug allows water slacker -

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.500 
oil is in slug allows water slacker -
why<00:02:43.290> this<00:02:43.350> special<00:02:43.709> is<00:02:44.040> so<00:02:44.430> has<00:02:44.730> to<00:02:44.880> be<00:02:44.910> really

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
why this special is so has to be really

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.320 
why this special is so has to be really
we<00:02:45.660> have<00:02:45.750> to<00:02:45.870> get<00:02:46.110> it<00:02:46.230> in<00:02:46.440> there<00:02:46.680> but<00:02:47.330> there's

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
we have to get it in there but there's

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.600 
we have to get it in there but there's
precaution<00:02:48.870> also<00:02:49.380> for<00:02:49.530> mechanical<00:02:50.010> factors<00:02:50.250> I

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
precaution also for mechanical factors I

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.860 
precaution also for mechanical factors I
decided<00:02:51.540> to<00:02:51.660> take<00:02:51.840> yourself<00:02:53.510> and<00:02:54.510> I<00:02:54.630> have<00:02:54.750> a

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
decided to take yourself and I have a

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.400 
decided to take yourself and I have a
full<00:02:55.170> bottle<00:02:55.470> of<00:02:55.500> oil<00:02:56.000> here<00:02:57.000> or<00:02:57.330> fossil<00:02:57.750> -<00:02:58.200> you

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
full bottle of oil here or fossil - you

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.920 
full bottle of oil here or fossil - you
soil<00:02:58.800> it's<00:02:59.070> used<00:02:59.310> but<00:03:00.239> it<00:03:00.390> doesn't<00:03:00.690> contain

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
soil it's used but it doesn't contain

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.850 
soil it's used but it doesn't contain
that<00:03:01.140> much<00:03:01.170> the<00:03:01.470> buoy<00:03:01.680> like<00:03:02.250> this<00:03:02.970> and

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 
that much the buoy like this and

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:06.970 
that much the buoy like this and
certainly<00:03:04.860> not<00:03:05.250> those<00:03:05.400> massive<00:03:05.820> metal<00:03:06.030> pieces

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:06.980 
certainly not those massive metal pieces

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.970 
certainly not those massive metal pieces
so<00:03:07.980> I'm<00:03:08.040> going<00:03:08.280> to<00:03:08.400> I<00:03:08.730> have<00:03:09.570> put<00:03:09.900> that<00:03:10.049> in<00:03:10.620> here

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
so I'm going to I have put that in here

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.870 
so I'm going to I have put that in here
and<00:03:12.110> fill<00:03:13.110> it<00:03:13.200> up<00:03:13.260> again<00:03:13.410> to<00:03:14.220> the<00:03:14.280> crack<00:03:14.519> level

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
and fill it up again to the crack level

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.979 
and fill it up again to the crack level
this<00:03:15.269> table<00:03:15.600> see<00:03:15.750> local<00:03:16.200> clause<00:03:17.570> and<00:03:18.570> it<00:03:18.810> can

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
this table see local clause and it can

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:21.770 
this table see local clause and it can
run<00:03:19.200> again<00:03:19.440> and<00:03:19.560> hopefully<00:03:19.950> yeah<00:03:20.940> before<00:03:21.570> you

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
run again and hopefully yeah before you

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:27.170 
run again and hopefully yeah before you
that<00:03:21.989> I<00:03:22.200> have<00:03:22.380> to<00:03:22.500> do<00:03:22.590> that<00:03:22.739> again<00:03:23.360> so<00:03:26.180> they

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
that I have to do that again so they

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.789 
that I have to do that again so they
make<00:03:27.329> it<00:03:27.450> all<00:03:27.570> nice<00:03:27.750> make<00:03:28.350> it<00:03:28.470> all<00:03:28.590> working

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:28.799 
make it all nice make it all working

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:31.069 
make it all nice make it all working
condition<00:03:29.310> occurs<00:03:29.579> and<00:03:29.850> the<00:03:30.420> thing<00:03:30.600> had<00:03:30.780> a<00:03:30.810> lot

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:31.079 
condition occurs and the thing had a lot

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:33.470 
condition occurs and the thing had a lot
of<00:03:31.110> fallen<00:03:31.829> so<00:03:31.950> I<00:03:32.040> bought<00:03:32.340> it<00:03:32.370> back<00:03:32.760> two<00:03:33.180> years

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
of fallen so I bought it back two years

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.670 
of fallen so I bought it back two years
I<00:03:33.720> guess<00:03:34.079> I<00:03:34.350> think<00:03:35.010> it<00:03:35.070> was<00:03:35.160> two<00:03:35.310> years<00:03:35.340> ago

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
I guess I think it was two years ago

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.430 
I guess I think it was two years ago
this<00:03:37.680> was<00:03:37.860> also<00:03:38.010> broken<00:03:38.480> you<00:03:39.480> know<00:03:39.600> visible

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
this was also broken you know visible

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.120 
this was also broken you know visible
spoke<00:03:40.799> and<00:03:41.130> also<00:03:42.120> the<00:03:42.810> lock<00:03:43.320> slot<00:03:43.500> was<00:03:43.680> broken

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
spoke and also the lock slot was broken

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.420 
spoke and also the lock slot was broken
and<00:03:44.810> 0<00:03:45.810> on<00:03:45.989> the<00:03:46.200> top<00:03:46.350> has<00:03:46.709> also<00:03:46.860> completely

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
and 0 on the top has also completely

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:51.140 
and 0 on the top has also completely
gone<00:03:48.030> hard<00:03:48.390> and<00:03:48.720> swung<00:03:49.560> inside<00:03:49.890> so<00:03:50.220> we<00:03:50.370> did<00:03:50.820> see

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
gone hard and swung inside so we did see

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.140 
gone hard and swung inside so we did see
at<00:03:51.269> all<00:03:51.420> the<00:03:51.900> oil<00:03:52.019> just<00:03:52.380> will<00:03:52.590> dropped<00:03:53.310> out<00:03:53.489> of

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
at all the oil just will dropped out of

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.620 
at all the oil just will dropped out of
the<00:03:54.329> view<00:03:54.510> of<00:03:54.780> the<00:03:54.840> users<00:03:55.380> so<00:03:56.370> yeah<00:03:56.940> it's<00:03:57.480> all

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630

now<00:04:15.920> finally<00:04:16.540> let's<00:04:17.540> get<00:04:17.750> tackles<00:04:18.350> this<00:04:18.500> point

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:18.890 
now finally let's get tackles this point

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:23.680 
now finally let's get tackles this point
I've<00:04:19.040> tackled<00:04:20.680> so<00:04:21.680> I<00:04:22.220> think<00:04:22.520> maybe<00:04:22.850> meters<00:04:23.480> I'm

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
I've tackled so I think maybe meters I'm

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:26.860 
I've tackled so I think maybe meters I'm
going<00:04:23.990> to<00:04:24.200> take<00:04:24.320> a<00:04:24.350> 1<00:04:24.700> the<00:04:25.700> same<00:04:26.090> as<00:04:26.300> really

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
going to take a 1 the same as really

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:31.990 
going to take a 1 the same as really
died<00:04:27.140> now<00:04:27.760> see<00:04:28.960> and<00:04:29.960> it<00:04:30.650> was<00:04:30.770> metal<00:04:31.070> shavings

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.000 
died now see and it was metal shavings

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.940 
died now see and it was metal shavings
here<00:04:32.360> but<00:04:32.690> also<00:04:32.870> like<00:04:33.140> buzzer<00:04:33.410> sounds<00:04:33.830> there

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:33.950 
here but also like buzzer sounds there

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:39.130 
here but also like buzzer sounds there
are<00:04:34.010> from<00:04:34.370> the<00:04:34.900> tapping<00:04:35.900> process<00:04:38.020> for<00:04:39.020> this

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:39.140 
are from the tapping process for this

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:45.480 
are from the tapping process for this
low<00:04:39.530> power<00:04:39.830> for<00:04:40.160> low<00:04:40.570> level<00:04:41.570> glass<00:04:41.780> here<00:04:43.000> yeah

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:45.490 
low power for low level glass here yeah

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:49.720 
low power for low level glass here yeah
see<00:04:46.490> if<00:04:46.610> I<00:04:46.700> can<00:04:46.880> get<00:04:47.000> that<00:04:47.180> a<00:04:47.210> little<00:04:47.480> for<00:04:47.570> that
