00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
school in college into the media so I

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.950 
school in college into the media so I
guess<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.460> moral<00:00:44.760> of<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.180> story<00:00:45.210> is<00:00:45.930> you

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
guess the moral of the story is you

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.069 
guess the moral of the story is you
can't<00:00:46.620> believe<00:00:47.039> everything<00:00:47.969> you<00:00:48.239> hear

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
can't believe everything you hear

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.200 
can't believe everything you hear
so<00:00:49.680> this<00:00:49.860> brings<00:00:50.039> me<00:00:50.160> back<00:00:50.280> to<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.730> point<00:00:50.940> that

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
so this brings me back to the point that

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.000 
so this brings me back to the point that
I<00:00:51.390> made<00:00:51.480> another<00:00:51.899> rants<00:00:53.480> so<00:00:54.480> many<00:00:54.719> people<00:00:55.199> they

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
I made another rants so many people they

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.729 
I made another rants so many people they
just<00:00:56.399> believe<00:00:56.879> things<00:00:57.320> because<00:00:58.320> they've<00:00:58.530> been

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
just believe things because they've been

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.700 
just believe things because they've been
told<00:00:59.280> they<00:01:00.120> are<00:01:00.359> true<00:01:00.690> this<00:01:00.930> is<00:01:01.140> especially
