 unusual spikelet and surprise others and 

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:21.259
 so we need to separate part of the hair on 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:25.340
 which we will weave this 

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:30.890
 wonderful spike you need somewhere 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:34.430
 half of the hair like this 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:39.739
 we fix the hair so that we donâ€™t 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:46.070
 interfered here then we comb for that 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:49.400
 strand of hair and begin to weave 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:55.329
 a pigtail only from the very first bottom 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:55.329
 strands we select one small strand 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:08.960
 on three strands on style and begin to weave 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:12.259
 like a spikelet but we will let one 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.579
 strand of hair from the left side only 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:17.180

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:35.869
 her bottom strand top next strand 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:43.210

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:46.670
 one third so that is, we weave 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:50.890

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:12.620
