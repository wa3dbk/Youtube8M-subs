um<00:02:39.370> another<00:02:40.370> thing<00:02:40.430> I<00:02:40.580> do<00:02:40.670> like<00:02:40.700> about<00:02:40.910> this

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
um another thing I do like about this

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.870 
um another thing I do like about this
game<00:02:41.390> is<00:02:41.810> the<00:02:42.709> fact<00:02:42.920> that<00:02:43.010> you<00:02:43.190> do<00:02:43.340> have<00:02:43.370> to

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
game is the fact that you do have to

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.180 
game is the fact that you do have to
rank<00:02:44.540> up<00:02:44.690> in<00:02:44.930> order<00:02:45.080> to<00:02:45.140> get<00:02:45.380> your<00:02:45.530> item<00:02:45.920> so<00:02:46.130> you

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
rank up in order to get your item so you

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.240 
rank up in order to get your item so you
can't<00:02:46.489> just<00:02:46.730> start<00:02:47.000> off<00:02:47.209> well<00:02:47.599> you<00:02:47.810> can

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
can't just start off well you can

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.990 
can't just start off well you can
essentially<00:02:49.250> by<00:02:49.610> the<00:02:50.209> items<00:02:50.540> if<00:02:50.660> you<00:02:50.750> want<00:02:50.989> to

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
essentially by the items if you want to

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.100 
essentially by the items if you want to
but<00:02:53.000> right<00:02:53.420> now<00:02:53.810> I<00:02:54.290> don't<00:02:54.470> really<00:02:54.739> see<00:02:54.860> a<00:02:56.110> pay

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
but right now I don't really see a pay

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.280 
but right now I don't really see a pay
to<00:02:57.170> win<00:02:57.500> type<00:02:58.040> model<00:02:58.519> I<00:02:58.670> may<00:02:59.330> be<00:02:59.360> wrong<00:02:59.720> as<00:03:00.110> we

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
to win type model I may be wrong as we

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.650 
to win type model I may be wrong as we
get<00:03:00.470> further<00:03:00.650> along<00:03:01.220> and<00:03:01.850> deal<00:03:02.360> with<00:03:02.540> the

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660 
get further along and deal with the

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.440 
get further along and deal with the
higher<00:03:02.840> level<00:03:03.260> people<00:03:03.470> we<00:03:04.190> may<00:03:04.459> run<00:03:04.970> into<00:03:05.030> this

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
higher level people we may run into this

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.930 
higher level people we may run into this
but<00:03:06.110> right<00:03:06.260> now<00:03:06.319> this<00:03:06.920> isn't<00:03:07.160> a<00:03:07.310> problem<00:03:07.549> I

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
but right now this isn't a problem I

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:11.530 
understand the concept but then again

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:14.080

on<00:04:14.120> in<00:04:14.420> the<00:04:14.510> game<00:04:14.540> if<00:04:15.049> you<00:04:15.230> played<00:04:15.530> it<00:04:15.680> a<00:04:15.769> little

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:15.889 
on in the game if you played it a little

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:19.029 
on in the game if you played it a little
bit<00:04:16.130> longer<00:04:16.400> than<00:04:16.700> them<00:04:17.410> that's<00:04:18.410> not<00:04:18.650> really<00:04:19.010> a

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:19.039 
bit longer than them that's not really a

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:21.219 
bit longer than them that's not really a
gripe<00:04:19.489> about<00:04:19.850> the<00:04:20.209> game<00:04:20.419> because<00:04:20.840> i'm<00:04:20.930> pretty

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:21.229 
gripe about the game because i'm pretty

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:23.800 
gripe about the game because i'm pretty
sure<00:04:21.440> whoever<00:04:21.889> buying<00:04:22.340> these<00:04:22.669> servers<00:04:23.090> you

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:23.810 
sure whoever buying these servers you

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:25.779 
sure whoever buying these servers you
know<00:04:23.930> they<00:04:24.110> set<00:04:24.380> the<00:04:24.530> rules<00:04:24.740> so<00:04:25.100> that's<00:04:25.370> not

00:04:25.779 --> 00:04:25.789 
know they set the rules so that's not

00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:28.960 
know they set the rules so that's not
really<00:04:26.090> a<00:04:26.270> a<00:04:26.930> negative<00:04:27.919> but<00:04:28.220> we<00:04:28.460> have<00:04:28.729> come

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:28.970 
really a a negative but we have come

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:30.690 
really a a negative but we have come
across<00:04:29.000> that<00:04:29.479> to<00:04:29.660> be<00:04:29.780> an<00:04:29.900> issue

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:30.700 
across that to be an issue

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:34.810 
across that to be an issue
another<00:04:31.700> issue<00:04:31.880> is<00:04:32.380> when<00:04:33.380> you're<00:04:33.770> in<00:04:33.950> combat<00:04:34.340> I

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:34.820 
another issue is when you're in combat I

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:37.090 
another issue is when you're in combat I
feel<00:04:35.120> like<00:04:35.330> there<00:04:35.810> are<00:04:35.840> too<00:04:36.110> many<00:04:36.290> stun<00:04:36.770> locks

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:37.100 
feel like there are too many stun locks

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:40.270 
feel like there are too many stun locks
in<00:04:37.370> this<00:04:37.550> game<00:04:37.790> is<00:04:38.030> if<00:04:38.690> you<00:04:39.050> get<00:04:39.350> cornered<00:04:40.040> by

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:40.280 
in this game is if you get cornered by

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.670 
in this game is if you get cornered by
one<00:04:40.880> or<00:04:41.030> two<00:04:41.060> people<00:04:41.480> you're<00:04:41.870> basically<00:04:42.380> done

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:42.680 
one or two people you're basically done

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.470 
one or two people you're basically done
someone<00:04:43.340> push<00:04:43.550> you<00:04:43.700> in<00:04:43.820> the<00:04:43.910> air<00:04:44.060> they<00:04:44.300> can

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:44.480 
someone push you in the air they can

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:48.160 
someone push you in the air they can
just<00:04:44.810> destroy<00:04:45.590> you<00:04:45.650> very<00:04:46.580> very<00:04:47.300> quickly<00:04:47.780> I

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:48.170 
just destroy you very very quickly I

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:50.170 
just destroy you very very quickly I
think<00:04:48.740> that<00:04:48.830> they<00:04:48.950> probably<00:04:49.190> need<00:04:49.640> to<00:04:49.670> tweak

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:50.180 
think that they probably need to tweak

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:53.590 
think that they probably need to tweak
some<00:04:50.570> of<00:04:50.810> the<00:04:51.020> move<00:04:51.290> that<00:04:51.320> players<00:04:52.190> have<00:04:52.600> so

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:53.600 
some of the move that players have so

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.410 
some of the move that players have so
that<00:04:53.810> you<00:04:54.290> can<00:04:54.770> actually<00:04:54.950> fight<00:04:55.820> against

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:56.420 
that you can actually fight against

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:59.230 
that you can actually fight against
multiple<00:04:56.780> people<00:04:57.400> because<00:04:58.400> pretty<00:04:58.820> much<00:04:58.910> I

00:04:59.230 --> 00:04:59.240 
multiple people because pretty much I

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:00.520 
multiple people because pretty much I
mean<00:04:59.270> if<00:04:59.510> you're<00:04:59.660> if<00:04:59.900> you're<00:05:00.050> engaged<00:05:00.380> in

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:00.530

there's<00:05:54.230> a<00:05:54.290> lack<00:05:54.620> of<00:05:54.920> maps<00:05:55.490> at<00:05:55.850> this<00:05:56.060> point

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:56.440 
there's a lack of maps at this point

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:00.970 
there's a lack of maps at this point
hopefully<00:05:57.440> they<00:05:58.210> keep<00:05:59.210> this<00:05:59.390> game<00:05:59.630> updated<00:06:00.350> so

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:00.980 
hopefully they keep this game updated so

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:02.320 
hopefully they keep this game updated so
that<00:06:01.010> you<00:06:01.430> know<00:06:01.520> you<00:06:01.580> don't<00:06:01.850> get<00:06:02.060> bored

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:02.330 
that you know you don't get bored

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:05.350 
that you know you don't get bored
playing<00:06:02.810> the<00:06:02.960> same<00:06:03.170> old<00:06:03.200> maps<00:06:03.740> to<00:06:04.520> me<00:06:04.700> what<00:06:05.240> it

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:05.360 
playing the same old maps to me what it

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.090 
playing the same old maps to me what it
looks<00:06:05.540> like<00:06:05.660> right<00:06:05.720> now<00:06:06.140> is<00:06:06.470> there<00:06:06.860> is<00:06:07.070> a

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:07.100 
looks like right now is there is a

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:10.450 
looks like right now is there is a
specific<00:06:07.400> map<00:06:07.970> for<00:06:08.300> each<00:06:08.600> game<00:06:08.990> type<00:06:09.430> the<00:06:10.430> only

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:10.460 
specific map for each game type the only

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:12.280 
specific map for each game type the only
map<00:06:10.820> that<00:06:11.000> I<00:06:11.060> played<00:06:11.300> for<00:06:11.450> elimination<00:06:12.050> was

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:12.290 
map that I played for elimination was

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:14.680 
map that I played for elimination was
this<00:06:12.530> map<00:06:12.740> I<00:06:13.130> was<00:06:13.610> a<00:06:13.640> map<00:06:13.850> called<00:06:14.060> bridge<00:06:14.420> and

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:14.690 
this map I was a map called bridge and

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:15.730 
this map I was a map called bridge and
that's<00:06:14.810> the<00:06:14.900> only<00:06:14.960> mount<00:06:15.290> do<00:06:15.410> we<00:06:15.530> play<00:06:15.710> for

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:15.740 
that's the only mount do we play for

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:18.010 
that's the only mount do we play for
domination<00:06:16.490> and<00:06:16.910> then<00:06:17.180> free-for-all<00:06:17.780> there

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:18.020 
domination and then free-for-all there

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:19.690 
domination and then free-for-all there
was<00:06:18.140> a<00:06:18.170> specific<00:06:18.410> map<00:06:18.890> I<00:06:19.040> forgot<00:06:19.280> the<00:06:19.400> name<00:06:19.550> i

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:19.700 
was a specific map I forgot the name i

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:21.820 
was a specific map I forgot the name i
think<00:06:19.880> it<00:06:19.970> was<00:06:20.030> like<00:06:20.090> canal<00:06:20.690> or<00:06:20.720> something<00:06:21.380> or

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:21.830 
think it was like canal or something or

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:23.680 
think it was like canal or something or
i<00:06:21.890> think<00:06:22.370> this<00:06:22.520> one<00:06:22.580> might<00:06:22.910> be<00:06:22.970> can<00:06:23.270> i<00:06:23.390> excuse

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:23.690 
i think this one might be can i excuse

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:25.870 
i think this one might be can i excuse
me<00:06:23.840> it<00:06:24.110> doesn't<00:06:24.410> matter<00:06:24.470> though<00:06:24.740> but<00:06:25.550> you<00:06:25.670> get

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:25.880 
me it doesn't matter though but you get

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:28.540 
me it doesn't matter though but you get
the<00:06:25.940> point<00:06:26.210> i<00:06:26.680> don't<00:06:27.680> i<00:06:27.950> don't<00:06:28.040> know<00:06:28.280> if<00:06:28.430> they

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:28.550 
the point i don't i don't know if they

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:30.040 
the point i don't i don't know if they
did<00:06:28.730> that<00:06:28.880> on<00:06:28.940> purpose<00:06:29.000> i'm<00:06:29.630> thinking<00:06:30.020> that

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:30.050 
did that on purpose i'm thinking that

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:32.050 
did that on purpose i'm thinking that
this<00:06:30.320> is<00:06:30.530> the<00:06:30.860> formula<00:06:31.160> right<00:06:31.490> now<00:06:31.700> so

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:32.060 
this is the formula right now so

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:34.120 
this is the formula right now so
hopefully<00:06:32.360> they<00:06:32.810> get<00:06:33.170> out<00:06:33.350> their<00:06:33.560> formula<00:06:33.950> and

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:34.130 
hopefully they get out their formula and

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:36.910 
hopefully they get out their formula and
allow<00:06:34.340> you<00:06:34.400> to<00:06:34.790> at<00:06:35.090> least<00:06:35.360> play<00:06:35.990> different

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:36.920 
allow you to at least play different

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:37.559 
allow you to at least play different
mouth<00:06:37.070> for

00:06:37.559 --> 00:06:37.569 
mouth for

00:06:37.569 --> 00:06:39.089 
mouth for
different<00:06:37.869> games<00:06:38.050> height<00:06:38.319> you<00:06:38.800> know<00:06:38.919> maybe

00:06:39.089 --> 00:06:39.099 
different games height you know maybe

00:06:39.099 --> 00:06:41.730 
different games height you know maybe
they<00:06:39.309> can<00:06:39.779> revamp<00:06:40.779> this<00:06:41.020> mount<00:06:41.289> make<00:06:41.559> it

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:41.740 
they can revamp this mount make it

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:44.339 
they can revamp this mount make it
bigger<00:06:42.039> and<00:06:42.429> still<00:06:43.419> you<00:06:43.689> know<00:06:43.779> I<00:06:43.809> have<00:06:44.020> some<00:06:44.229> of

00:06:44.339 --> 00:06:44.349 
bigger and still you know I have some of

00:06:44.349 --> 00:06:46.260 
bigger and still you know I have some of
the<00:06:44.409> same<00:06:44.439> element<00:06:45.159> it<00:06:45.879> looks<00:06:46.059> like<00:06:46.089> they

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:46.270 
the same element it looks like they

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:49.230 
the same element it looks like they
definitely<00:06:46.569> build<00:06:46.990> a<00:06:47.679> map<00:06:48.039> for<00:06:48.429> each<00:06:48.819> game

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:49.240 
definitely build a map for each game

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:51.869 
definitely build a map for each game
tight<00:06:49.659> which<00:06:50.259> isn't<00:06:50.860> a<00:06:50.949> bad<00:06:50.979> thing<00:06:51.189> but<00:06:51.639> then

00:06:51.869 --> 00:06:51.879 
tight which isn't a bad thing but then

00:06:51.879 --> 00:06:54.209 
tight which isn't a bad thing but then
again<00:06:51.939> there's<00:06:52.779> a<00:06:53.080> lack<00:06:53.349> right<00:06:53.740> now<00:06:53.919> it's<00:06:54.159> only

00:06:54.209 --> 00:06:54.219 
again there's a lack right now it's only

00:06:54.219 --> 00:06:56.510 
again there's a lack right now it's only
like<00:06:54.459> four<00:06:54.759> or<00:06:54.849> five<00:06:54.879> maps<00:06:55.360> that<00:06:55.569> I've<00:06:55.749> seen

00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:56.520 
like four or five maps that I've seen

00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:00.089 
like four or five maps that I've seen
yeah<00:06:57.520> for<00:06:57.849> it<00:06:57.999> for<00:06:58.179> your<00:06:58.270> game<00:06:58.479> type<00:06:58.749> say<00:06:59.319> then

00:07:00.089 --> 00:07:00.099 
yeah for it for your game type say then

00:07:00.099 --> 00:07:02.040 
yeah for it for your game type say then
he<00:07:00.219> definitely<00:07:00.429> need<00:07:00.699> to<00:07:00.879> come<00:07:01.179> up<00:07:01.419> with<00:07:01.479> some

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:02.050 
he definitely need to come up with some

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:03.869 
he definitely need to come up with some
more<00:07:02.229> maps<00:07:02.529> give<00:07:03.099> us<00:07:03.279> a<00:07:03.369> little<00:07:03.520> bit<00:07:03.669> more

00:07:03.869 --> 00:07:03.879 
more maps give us a little bit more

00:07:03.879 --> 00:07:06.089 
more maps give us a little bit more
content<00:07:04.449> but<00:07:04.929> I<00:07:04.959> can't<00:07:05.379> fault<00:07:05.649> them<00:07:05.740> right<00:07:05.919> now

00:07:06.089 --> 00:07:06.099 
content but I can't fault them right now

00:07:06.099 --> 00:07:08.939 
content but I can't fault them right now
I<00:07:06.369> will<00:07:07.029> be<00:07:07.209> able<00:07:07.300> to<00:07:07.419> force<00:07:07.689> them<00:07:07.899> else<00:07:08.169> later

00:07:08.939 --> 00:07:08.949 
I will be able to force them else later

00:07:08.949 --> 00:07:11.070 
I will be able to force them else later
on<00:07:09.219> we<00:07:09.520> come<00:07:09.729> back<00:07:09.849> to<00:07:10.029> this<00:07:10.119> game<00:07:10.389> were<00:07:10.659> still
