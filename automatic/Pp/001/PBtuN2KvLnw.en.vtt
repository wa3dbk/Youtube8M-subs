00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
with us Matt steffanina and today I'm

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:14.900 
with us Matt steffanina and today I'm
going<00:00:13.440> to<00:00:13.500> teach<00:00:13.679> you<00:00:13.860> guys<00:00:13.889> how<00:00:14.040> to<00:00:14.370> do<00:00:14.610> an<00:00:14.730> arm

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
going to teach you guys how to do an arm

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.359 
going to teach you guys how to do an arm
the<00:00:15.870> best<00:00:16.109> way<00:00:16.260> to<00:00:16.289> learn<00:00:16.500> our<00:00:16.770> wave<00:00:17.010> is<00:00:17.160> to

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
the best way to learn our wave is to

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.150 
the best way to learn our wave is to
learn<00:00:17.490> each<00:00:17.760> position<00:00:18.119> one<00:00:18.869> by<00:00:19.080> one<00:00:19.380> and<00:00:19.619> then

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
learn each position one by one and then

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.130 
learn each position one by one and then
we<00:00:20.220> can<00:00:20.520> put<00:00:20.730> them<00:00:20.850> together<00:00:20.939> to<00:00:21.689> create<00:00:21.720> the

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
we can put them together to create the

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:22.609 
we can put them together to create the
whip

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
whip

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.590 
whip
so<00:00:22.949> let's<00:00:23.189> start<00:00:23.400> by<00:00:23.519> putting<00:00:23.550> my<00:00:23.880> arms<00:00:24.150> out<00:00:24.330> to

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
so let's start by putting my arms out to

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.300 
so let's start by putting my arms out to
the<00:00:24.660> side<00:00:24.930> now<00:00:25.710> I'm<00:00:25.769> going<00:00:25.890> to<00:00:25.949> start<00:00:26.160> by

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
the side now I'm going to start by

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.790 
the side now I'm going to start by
lifting<00:00:26.580> our<00:00:26.849> left<00:00:27.180> fingers<00:00:27.630> there<00:00:28.529> when<00:00:28.680> it

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
lifting our left fingers there when it

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.339 
lifting our left fingers there when it
come<00:00:28.980> to<00:00:29.189> our<00:00:29.310> wrists<00:00:29.609> and<00:00:29.970> then<00:00:30.599> to<00:00:30.810> our<00:00:30.929> elbow

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
come to our wrists and then to our elbow

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.400 
come to our wrists and then to our elbow
and<00:00:31.679> then<00:00:32.189> to<00:00:32.399> our<00:00:32.520> shoulder<00:00:33.079> now<00:00:34.079> when<00:00:34.320> you

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
and then to our shoulder now when you

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.380 
and then to our shoulder now when you
learn<00:00:34.620> these<00:00:34.829> basic<00:00:34.890> positions<00:00:35.760> what<00:00:36.270> you

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
learn these basic positions what you

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.150 
learn these basic positions what you
want<00:00:36.600> to<00:00:36.660> think<00:00:36.840> about<00:00:36.930> is<00:00:37.320> wherever<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.950> wave

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
want to think about is wherever the wave

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.030 
want to think about is wherever the wave
is<00:00:38.460> has<00:00:39.059> to<00:00:39.270> be<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.510> highest<00:00:39.780> point<00:00:40.350> in<00:00:40.800> your

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
is has to be the highest point in your

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.459 
is has to be the highest point in your
weight<00:00:41.280> so<00:00:41.940> right<00:00:42.149> now<00:00:42.329> it's<00:00:42.780> a<00:00:42.930> straight<00:00:43.260> line

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
weight so right now it's a straight line

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.040 
weight so right now it's a straight line
when<00:00:44.129> I<00:00:44.160> hear<00:00:44.399> my<00:00:44.579> fingers<00:00:45.030> they<00:00:45.570> have<00:00:45.750> to<00:00:45.930> go

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
when I hear my fingers they have to go

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.830 
when I hear my fingers they have to go
up<00:00:46.320> then<00:00:47.250> when<00:00:47.399> I<00:00:47.430> go<00:00:47.610> to<00:00:47.670> my<00:00:47.850> wrist<00:00:48.120> my<00:00:48.450> fingers

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
up then when I go to my wrist my fingers

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.510 
up then when I go to my wrist my fingers
are<00:00:48.930> going<00:00:49.020> to<00:00:49.110> come<00:00:49.320> back<00:00:49.559> down<00:00:49.829> with<00:00:50.399> my

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
are going to come back down with my

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.639 
are going to come back down with my
shoulder<00:00:50.940> and<00:00:51.360> my<00:00:51.570> wrist<00:00:51.930> is<00:00:52.140> now<00:00:52.320> going<00:00:52.530> to<00:00:52.590> be

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
shoulder and my wrist is now going to be

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.040 
shoulder and my wrist is now going to be
the<00:00:52.770> highest<00:00:52.980> point<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.550> width<00:00:53.840> same<00:00:54.840> thing

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
the highest point the width same thing

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.930 
the highest point the width same thing
when<00:00:55.170> I<00:00:55.199> go<00:00:55.350> to<00:00:55.410> my<00:00:55.590> elbow<00:00:55.949> my<00:00:56.340> wrist<00:00:56.670> is<00:00:56.910> going

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
when I go to my elbow my wrist is going

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.599 
when I go to my elbow my wrist is going
to<00:00:57.149> drop<00:00:57.390> back<00:00:57.629> to<00:00:57.840> neutral<00:00:58.170> and<00:00:58.500> my<00:00:58.920> elbow<00:00:59.460> is

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
to drop back to neutral and my elbow is

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.760 
to drop back to neutral and my elbow is
going<00:00:59.640> to<00:00:59.879> wrap<00:01:00.079> this<00:01:01.079> is<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.379> toughest

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
going to wrap this is the toughest

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.889 
going to wrap this is the toughest
position<00:01:01.980> to<00:01:02.579> get<00:01:02.730> to<00:01:02.910> this<00:01:03.059> one<00:01:03.270> you<00:01:03.690> have<00:01:03.870> to

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
position to get to this one you have to

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.740 
position to get to this one you have to
rotate<00:01:04.470> your<00:01:04.650> arm<00:01:04.920> down<00:01:05.610> and<00:01:05.640> inward<00:01:06.090> so<00:01:06.659> I'm

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
rotate your arm down and inward so I'm

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.690 
rotate your arm down and inward so I'm
actually<00:01:07.110> rotating<00:01:07.650> it<00:01:07.740> this<00:01:07.830> way<00:01:08.070> but<00:01:08.580> I'm

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
actually rotating it this way but I'm

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.730 
actually rotating it this way but I'm
keeping<00:01:08.939> my<00:01:09.299> hand<00:01:09.659> flat<00:01:10.049> and<00:01:10.320> bringing<00:01:10.650> my

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
keeping my hand flat and bringing my

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.490 
keeping my hand flat and bringing my
elbow<00:01:11.040> up<00:01:11.070> notice<00:01:11.970> how<00:01:12.119> my<00:01:12.299> hand<00:01:12.479> is<00:01:12.900> roughly

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
elbow up notice how my hand is roughly

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.200 
elbow up notice how my hand is roughly
in<00:01:13.590> line<00:01:13.680> still<00:01:14.340> with<00:01:14.520> my<00:01:14.670> shoulder<00:01:15.090> in<00:01:15.180> my

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
in line still with my shoulder in my

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.469 
in line still with my shoulder in my
armpit<00:01:15.720> if<00:01:16.110> my<00:01:16.259> elbow<00:01:16.619> is<00:01:16.770> high<00:01:17.180> from<00:01:18.180> here

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
armpit if my elbow is high from here

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.020 
armpit if my elbow is high from here
you're<00:01:18.960> going<00:01:19.049> to<00:01:19.140> bring<00:01:19.500> this<00:01:19.740> way<00:01:19.979> into<00:01:20.880> your

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
you're going to bring this way into your

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.940 
you're going to bring this way into your
shoulder<00:01:21.420> which<00:01:21.840> means<00:01:22.140> your<00:01:22.350> shoulder<00:01:22.799> is

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
shoulder which means your shoulder is

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.010 
shoulder which means your shoulder is
going<00:01:23.130> to<00:01:23.189> be<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.430> highest<00:01:23.670> point<00:01:24.150> it's<00:01:24.840> going

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
going to be the highest point it's going

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.990 
going to be the highest point it's going
to<00:01:25.110> be<00:01:25.170> right<00:01:25.409> up<00:01:25.560> behind<00:01:25.830> right<00:01:26.220> here<00:01:26.520> and<00:01:26.759> I'm

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
to be right up behind right here and I'm

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.410 
to be right up behind right here and I'm
almost<00:01:27.210> thinking<00:01:27.540> about<00:01:27.930> pushing<00:01:28.350> my

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
almost thinking about pushing my

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:32.859 
almost thinking about pushing my
rather<00:01:30.290> than<00:01:30.590> just<00:01:30.890> raising<00:01:31.479> from<00:01:32.479> here<00:01:32.780> I

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:32.869 
rather than just raising from here I

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:34.630 
rather than just raising from here I
would<00:01:33.110> switch<00:01:33.409> it<00:01:33.439> it's<00:01:33.950> going<00:01:34.130> to<00:01:34.220> go<00:01:34.310> to<00:01:34.369> my

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
would switch it it's going to go to my

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.420 
would switch it it's going to go to my
other<00:01:34.790> shoulder<00:01:35.290> then<00:01:36.290> the<00:01:36.530> reverse<00:01:36.920> this<00:01:37.159> pad

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.430 
other shoulder then the reverse this pad

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.880 
other shoulder then the reverse this pad
I'm<00:01:37.820> going<00:01:38.030> to<00:01:38.090> turn<00:01:38.299> my<00:01:38.420> arm<00:01:38.630> inward<00:01:38.990> bringing

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
I'm going to turn my arm inward bringing

fingers and then back to flap let's try
a<00:01:48.259> little<00:01:48.590> bit<00:01:48.740> faster<00:01:49.130> one<00:01:49.310> for<00:01:49.520> the<00:01:49.580> left

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:49.759 
a little bit faster one for the left

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:53.760 
a little bit faster one for the left
side<00:01:49.970> we<00:01:50.539> go<00:01:50.659> fingers<00:01:51.170> wrist<00:01:51.970> elbow<00:01:52.970> shoulder

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
side we go fingers wrist elbow shoulder

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:59.200 
side we go fingers wrist elbow shoulder
shoulder<00:01:54.770> elbow<00:01:55.580> wrist<00:01:55.820> fingers<00:01:58.060> once<00:01:59.060> you

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
shoulder elbow wrist fingers once you

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.210 
shoulder elbow wrist fingers once you
can<00:01:59.390> do<00:01:59.509> that<00:01:59.539> both<00:01:59.930> directions<00:02:00.320> you're<00:02:01.009> ready

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:01.220 
can do that both directions you're ready

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.010 
can do that both directions you're ready
to<00:02:01.369> start<00:02:01.640> putting<00:02:01.940> together<00:02:02.179> your<00:02:02.630> wicked

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
to start putting together your wicked

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.020 
to start putting together your wicked
remember<00:02:03.860> when<00:02:04.039> you<00:02:04.159> put<00:02:04.429> the<00:02:04.580> wave<00:02:04.759> together

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
remember when you put the wave together

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.450 
remember when you put the wave together
and<00:02:05.569> you<00:02:05.810> smooth<00:02:06.140> it<00:02:06.319> out<00:02:06.409> you<00:02:06.950> don't<00:02:07.100> want<00:02:07.250> to

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
and you smooth it out you don't want to

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.789 
and you smooth it out you don't want to
lose<00:02:07.700> those<00:02:08.030> positions<00:02:08.420> so<00:02:09.110> make<00:02:09.350> sure<00:02:09.590> that

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:09.799 
lose those positions so make sure that

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:12.130 
lose those positions so make sure that
you're<00:02:09.950> isolating<00:02:10.670> from<00:02:10.880> one<00:02:11.150> spot<00:02:11.480> to<00:02:11.540> the

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
you're isolating from one spot to the

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.640 
you're isolating from one spot to the
next

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
next

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.380 
next
it's<00:02:13.220> also<00:02:13.430> important<00:02:13.910> to<00:02:13.970> know<00:02:14.090> that<00:02:14.120> it

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
it's also important to know that it

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.120 
it's also important to know that it
doesn't<00:02:14.720> matter<00:02:14.870> how<00:02:15.260> big<00:02:15.500> or<00:02:15.680> small<00:02:15.739> your

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
doesn't matter how big or small your

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.520 
doesn't matter how big or small your
weight<00:02:16.340> is<00:02:16.640> it's<00:02:17.120> about<00:02:17.420> control<00:02:17.989> that's<00:02:18.290> what

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
weight is it's about control that's what

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.380 
weight is it's about control that's what
makes<00:02:18.709> the<00:02:18.860> way<00:02:18.980> they<00:02:19.160> look<00:02:19.310> good<00:02:19.519> so<00:02:20.060> the<00:02:20.209> wave

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
makes the way they look good so the wave

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.680 
makes the way they look good so the wave
can<00:02:20.630> be<00:02:20.660> big<00:02:21.110> and<00:02:21.380> more<00:02:22.190> exaggerated<00:02:23.030> or<00:02:23.269> it

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
can be big and more exaggerated or it

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.080 
can be big and more exaggerated or it
can<00:02:23.810> be<00:02:23.930> really<00:02:24.290> small<00:02:24.590> and<00:02:24.950> it<00:02:25.580> can<00:02:25.640> be<00:02:25.819> just

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
can be really small and it can be just

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:27.460 
can be really small and it can be just
as<00:02:26.209> effective<00:02:26.390> either<00:02:26.989> way

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
as effective either way

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.650 
as effective either way
it's<00:02:27.620> about<00:02:27.920> knowing<00:02:28.220> your<00:02:28.519> position<00:02:28.970> so<00:02:29.510> if

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
it's about knowing your position so if

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.000 
it's about knowing your position so if
you're<00:02:29.810> having<00:02:30.019> this<00:02:30.200> talk<00:02:30.500> we're<00:02:30.739> getting

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
you're having this talk we're getting

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.699 
you're having this talk we're getting
stuck<00:02:31.340> or<00:02:31.519> we're<00:02:31.640> losing<00:02:32.209> the<00:02:32.630> wave<00:02:32.810> go<00:02:33.500> back

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
stuck or we're losing the wave go back

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:35.560 
stuck or we're losing the wave go back
to<00:02:33.890> the<00:02:33.980> beginning<00:02:34.280> in<00:02:34.400> this<00:02:34.519> video<00:02:34.850> and<00:02:35.209> just

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:35.570 
to the beginning in this video and just

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:39.250 
to the beginning in this video and just
start<00:02:35.900> one<00:02:36.230> position<00:02:36.620> at<00:02:36.950> a<00:02:37.040> time
