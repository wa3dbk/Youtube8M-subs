that the ponds had seen the doctor was I

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.980 
that the ponds had seen the doctor was I
think<00:01:53.040> two<00:01:53.189> months<00:01:53.520> I<00:01:53.700> like<00:01:54.030> that<00:01:54.299> I<00:01:54.450> really<00:01:54.840> do

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
think two months I like that I really do

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.200

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.330 
I like the fact that they tell us how
much<00:01:57.360> time<00:01:57.600> is<00:01:57.719> best<00:01:57.960> I<00:01:58.290> don't<00:01:58.530> know<00:01:58.590> why<00:01:58.770> but<00:01:59.040> I

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
much time is best I don't know why but I

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.249 
much time is best I don't know why but I
think<00:01:59.729> that's<00:01:59.909> cool<00:02:00.149> okay<00:02:00.750> so<00:02:00.810> there<00:02:01.079> are

think that's cool okay so there are

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:02.870 
think that's cool okay so there are
three<00:02:01.560> things<00:02:01.770> that<00:02:01.920> I<00:02:02.040> do<00:02:02.130> like<00:02:02.460> about<00:02:02.490> the

because<00:02:50.430> he<00:02:50.670> killed<00:02:50.940> off<00:02:51.120> everything<00:02:51.630> except

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
because he killed off everything except

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:53.870 
because he killed off everything except
the<00:02:52.260> dinosaurs<00:02:52.860> on<00:02:53.070> the<00:02:53.190> spaceship<00:02:53.640> and

the dinosaurs on the spaceship and

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.070 
the dinosaurs on the spaceship and
that's<00:02:54.260> clearly<00:02:55.260> a<00:02:55.410> horrible<00:02:55.950> act<00:02:57.080> Oakland

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
that's clearly a horrible act Oakland

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.860 
that's clearly a horrible act Oakland
but<00:02:58.770> nonetheless<00:02:58.980> i<00:02:59.520> am<00:02:59.850> still<00:03:00.180> used<00:03:00.510> to<00:03:00.750> the

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
but nonetheless i am still used to the

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.500 
but nonetheless i am still used to the
doctor<00:03:01.320> that<00:03:01.710> would<00:03:01.950> even<00:03:02.670> though<00:03:03.090> he<00:03:03.300> did

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
doctor that would even though he did

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.710 
doctor that would even though he did
terrible<00:03:04.320> terrible<00:03:04.560> things<00:03:05.360> would<00:03:06.360> let<00:03:06.540> him

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
terrible terrible things would let him

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.870 
terrible terrible things would let him
live<00:03:07.280> maybe<00:03:08.280> you<00:03:08.430> send<00:03:08.670> him<00:03:08.730> to<00:03:08.850> prison

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
live maybe you send him to prison

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.030 
live maybe you send him to prison
anything<00:03:09.750> but<00:03:10.230> no<00:03:10.380> he<00:03:10.560> gives<00:03:10.709> them<00:03:10.830> a<00:03:10.890> death

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
anything but no he gives them a death

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.949 
anything but no he gives them a death
sentence<00:03:11.430> I<00:03:11.610> can<00:03:12.450> understand<00:03:13.160> but<00:03:14.959> regardless

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
sentence I can understand but regardless

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:19.340 
sentence I can understand but regardless
I<00:03:17.209> guess<00:03:18.209> it's<00:03:18.390> kind<00:03:18.570> of<00:03:18.630> like<00:03:18.750> the<00:03:18.900> real<00:03:19.080> death

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
I guess it's kind of like the real death

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.229 
I guess it's kind of like the real death
penalty<00:03:19.739> in<00:03:19.830> the<00:03:19.920> world<00:03:20.130> stooping<00:03:21.000> to<00:03:21.030> the

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
penalty in the world stooping to the

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:24.970 
penalty in the world stooping to the
level<00:03:21.540> of<00:03:21.660> the<00:03:21.720> person<00:03:22.230> or<00:03:22.459> perhaps<00:03:23.459> alien

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
level of the person or perhaps alien

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.869 
level of the person or perhaps alien
that<00:03:25.580> that<00:03:26.090> will<00:03:26.239> go<00:03:26.420> as<00:03:27.080> far<00:03:27.470> as<00:03:27.709> killing<00:03:28.040> to

00:03:28.869 --> 00:03:28.879 
that that will go as far as killing to
