is my old one here which I've had
non-stop<00:00:10.440> problems<00:00:10.889> with<00:00:11.040> and<00:00:11.370> I<00:00:12.300> also<00:00:12.450> have<00:00:12.809> a

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
non-stop problems with and I also have a

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.300 
non-stop problems with and I also have a
different<00:00:14.150> external<00:00:15.150> start<00:00:16.049> to<00:00:16.680> component

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
different external start to component

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.500 
different external start to component
converter<00:00:17.990> to<00:00:18.990> test<00:00:19.230> out<00:00:19.410> but<00:00:20.060> this<00:00:21.060> video<00:00:21.330> is

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
converter to test out but this video is

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.210 
converter to test out but this video is
mostly<00:00:21.750> about<00:00:22.109> the<00:00:22.470> difference<00:00:22.740> between<00:00:22.769> my

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
mostly about the difference between my

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.550 
mostly about the difference between my
two<00:00:23.279> cords<00:00:24.150> and<00:00:24.890> use<00:00:25.890> on<00:00:26.220> SNES<00:00:27.320> I've<00:00:28.320> got<00:00:28.529> a

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
two cords and use on SNES I've got a

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.849 
two cords and use on SNES I've got a
customer<00:00:29.010> that<00:00:29.279> sent<00:00:29.939> me<00:00:30.000> this<00:00:30.510> converter<00:00:31.230> for

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
customer that sent me this converter for

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.799 
customer that sent me this converter for
the<00:00:32.570> stereo<00:00:33.570> output<00:00:34.260> mod<00:00:35.180> but<00:00:36.180> one<00:00:36.690> of<00:00:36.750> the

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
the stereo output mod but one of the

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.440 
the stereo output mod but one of the
main<00:00:36.930> concerns<00:00:37.260> we're<00:00:37.530> having<00:00:37.890> is<00:00:38.120> the<00:00:39.120> video

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
main concerns we're having is the video

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:54.080 
main concerns we're having is the video
is<00:00:39.840> jumpy<00:00:41.360> with<00:00:42.360> a<00:00:42.420> crappy<00:00:43.110> scar<00:00:43.530> cord

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.510 

you<00:00:54.810> can<00:00:54.960> catch<00:00:55.260> that<00:00:57.980> the<00:00:58.980> whole<00:00:59.160> screen

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
you can catch that the whole screen

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.009 
you can catch that the whole screen
seems<00:00:59.760> to<00:00:59.850> jump<00:01:00.150> and<00:01:00.420> there's<00:01:00.989> definitely<00:01:01.260> a

00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:03.019 
seems to jump and there's definitely a

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:15.539 
seems to jump and there's definitely a
lot<00:01:04.019> of<00:01:04.170> interference

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:15.549 

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:22.380 

if<00:01:16.180> we<00:01:16.299> see<00:01:16.479> it<00:01:16.510> jumping<00:01:16.990> and<00:01:21.150> kind<00:01:22.150> of<00:01:22.210> hard<00:01:22.330> to

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.390 
if we see it jumping and kind of hard to

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.710 
if we see it jumping and kind of hard to
catch<00:01:22.630> the<00:01:24.450> interference<00:01:25.450> but<00:01:25.630> it's

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:25.720 
catch the interference but it's

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.990 
catch the interference but it's
definitely<00:01:25.869> there<00:01:29.430> but<00:01:30.430> you'll<00:01:30.580> see<00:01:30.759> when<00:01:30.970> I

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.000 
definitely there but you'll see when I

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.230 
definitely there but you'll see when I
change<00:01:31.360> chords<00:01:32.100> it<00:01:33.100> goes<00:01:33.340> away<00:01:33.550> completely

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
change chords it goes away completely

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.710 
change chords it goes away completely
okay<00:01:34.930> exact<00:01:35.320> same<00:01:35.560> setup<00:01:35.920> except<00:01:36.430> with<00:01:36.640> a

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
okay exact same setup except with a

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:44.160 
okay exact same setup except with a
different<00:01:37.770> chord<00:01:41.670> you<00:01:42.670> can<00:01:42.820> see<00:01:43.060> that<00:01:43.270> it<00:01:44.110> is

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.170 
different chord you can see that it is

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:53.570 
different chord you can see that it is
no<00:01:44.560> longer<00:01:44.590> jumping<00:01:45.190> around<00:01:45.310> at<00:01:45.580> all

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:53.580 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.410 

there<00:01:54.180> is<00:01:55.160> zero<00:01:56.160> interference<00:01:56.970> that<00:01:57.120> I<00:01:57.240> can

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
there is zero interference that I can

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:19.720 
there is zero interference that I can
see

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.190 

it's<00:02:20.569> just<00:02:20.840> it's<00:02:21.110> perfect<00:02:21.709> and<00:02:21.860> I<00:02:22.160> have

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
it's just it's perfect and I have

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.080 
it's just it's perfect and I have
nothing<00:02:24.200> else<00:02:24.319> to<00:02:24.440> blame<00:02:24.739> except<00:02:25.250> for<00:02:25.519> using<00:02:26.000> a

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
nothing else to blame except for using a

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.930 
nothing else to blame except for using a
better<00:02:26.330> cord<00:02:28.330> the<00:02:29.330> cord<00:02:29.360> is<00:02:29.690> handmade<00:02:29.989> by

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
better cord the cord is handmade by

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.610 
better cord the cord is handmade by
retro<00:02:31.940> console<00:02:32.450> accessories<00:02:33.050> I<00:02:33.260> got<00:02:33.440> it<00:02:33.530> off

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
retro console accessories I got it off

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.460 
retro console accessories I got it off
eBay<00:02:33.860> they<00:02:34.400> may<00:02:34.580> have<00:02:34.819> a<00:02:35.170> website<00:02:36.170> or<00:02:36.319> online

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
eBay they may have a website or online

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.570 
eBay they may have a website or online
store<00:02:36.830> whatever<00:02:37.040> but<00:02:37.489> it<00:02:38.209> is<00:02:39.130> advertised<00:02:40.130> as<00:02:40.519> a

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
store whatever but it is advertised as a

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:44.830 
store whatever but it is advertised as a
fully<00:02:41.209> shielded<00:02:41.810> cord<00:02:42.800> and<00:02:43.700> what<00:02:44.480> that<00:02:44.630> means

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
fully shielded cord and what that means

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.070 
fully shielded cord and what that means
is<00:02:45.200> every<00:02:46.069> signal<00:02:46.760> wire<00:02:46.940> also<00:02:47.299> has<00:02:47.750> a

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
is every signal wire also has a

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.750 
is every signal wire also has a
shielding<00:02:48.950> wire<00:02:49.400> around<00:02:49.879> it<00:02:50.239> and<00:02:51.549> it<00:02:52.549> really

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
shielding wire around it and it really

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.630 
shielding wire around it and it really
does<00:02:52.910> make<00:02:53.330> a<00:02:53.390> difference<00:02:54.099> if<00:02:55.099> I<00:02:55.250> had<00:02:55.400> a<00:02:55.430> better

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
does make a difference if I had a better

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.910 
does make a difference if I had a better
way<00:02:55.819> to<00:02:55.880> test<00:02:56.180> audio<00:02:56.660> I<00:02:56.959> can<00:02:57.349> actually<00:02:57.500> hear<00:02:57.860> a

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
way to test audio I can actually hear a

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.100 
way to test audio I can actually hear a
difference<00:02:58.250> in<00:02:58.370> the<00:02:58.459> audio<00:02:58.840> it's<00:02:59.840> a<00:02:59.930> lot

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
difference in the audio it's a lot

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:02.110 
difference in the audio it's a lot
quieter<00:03:00.380> with<00:03:00.709> this<00:03:00.860> cord<00:03:01.160> there's<00:03:01.400> less<00:03:01.610> of<00:03:01.940> a

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
quieter with this cord there's less of a

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.490 
quieter with this cord there's less of a
hum<00:03:02.630> or<00:03:03.069> background<00:03:04.069> noise<00:03:04.280> with<00:03:04.579> it<00:03:05.200> and<00:03:06.200> it

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
hum or background noise with it and it

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:12.460 
hum or background noise with it and it
was<00:03:06.620> like<00:03:08.170> 20<00:03:09.170> or<00:03:09.290> 23<00:03:09.560> dollars<00:03:09.799> shipped<00:03:10.720> and<00:03:11.720> I

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
was like 20 or 23 dollars shipped and I

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:15.400 
was like 20 or 23 dollars shipped and I
don't<00:03:12.530> remember<00:03:12.739> what<00:03:12.980> I<00:03:13.040> paid<00:03:13.310> for<00:03:13.519> my<00:03:14.410> my

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
don't remember what I paid for my my

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:20.729 
don't remember what I paid for my my
shitty<00:03:15.920> one<00:03:16.190> but<00:03:16.400> it<00:03:16.519> was<00:03:16.640> almost<00:03:17.269> that<00:03:18.489> so

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
shitty one but it was almost that so

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:24.579 
shitty one but it was almost that so
definitely<00:03:21.739> worth<00:03:22.370> it
