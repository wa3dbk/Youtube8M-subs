00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:54.940 
at this run hidden power grass nice but

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.210 
at this run hidden power grass nice but
he's<00:03:55.630> actually<00:03:55.840> running<00:03:56.140> lightning<00:03:56.739> rods<00:03:57.010> I

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
he's actually running lightning rods I

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.160 
he's actually running lightning rods I
have<00:03:57.430> seen<00:03:57.640> that<00:03:57.790> there<00:03:58.150> is<00:03:58.330> no<00:03:58.510> pressure<00:03:58.810> and

00:03:59.160 --> 00:03:59.170 
have seen that there is no pressure and

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.740 
have seen that there is no pressure and
liking<00:03:59.620> rods<00:03:59.890> at<00:04:00.190> those<00:04:00.400> cannot<00:04:00.730> run<00:04:01.000> heat

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
liking rods at those cannot run heat

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:04.560 
liking rods at those cannot run heat
wave<00:04:01.989> so<00:04:02.560> natori<00:04:02.920> can<00:04:03.100> definitely<00:04:03.489> you<00:04:04.450> know

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:04.570 
wave so natori can definitely you know

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:06.150 
wave so natori can definitely you know
take<00:04:04.780> at<00:04:04.989> least<00:04:05.140> one<00:04:05.380> of<00:04:05.410> his<00:04:05.590> moves<00:04:05.830> and<00:04:06.070> eat

ahead and yeah he's gonna be forced to

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:13.909 
ahead and yeah he's gonna be forced to
go<00:05:11.040> for<00:05:11.250> the<00:05:11.280> funder<00:05:11.610> I<00:05:12.570> guess<00:05:13.320> he<00:05:13.440> was<00:05:13.590> hoping

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:13.919 
go for the funder I guess he was hoping

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:16.879 
go for the funder I guess he was hoping
I'm<00:05:14.220> gonna<00:05:14.460> stay<00:05:15.030> in<00:05:15.060> over<00:05:15.960> predicting<00:05:16.530> him

00:05:16.879 --> 00:05:16.889 
I'm gonna stay in over predicting him

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:19.250 
I'm gonna stay in over predicting him
going<00:05:17.100> for<00:05:17.160> something<00:05:17.460> else<00:05:17.729> but<00:05:17.880> I<00:05:18.570> was

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:19.260 
going for something else but I was

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.260 
going for something else but I was
thinking<00:05:19.290> that<00:05:19.590> natori<00:05:20.190> can<00:05:20.370> still<00:05:20.610> take<00:05:21.060> two

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:21.270 
thinking that natori can still take two

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:23.060 
thinking that natori can still take two
hidden<00:05:21.600> powers<00:05:21.990> being<00:05:22.560> the<00:05:22.710> time<00:05:22.919> especially

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:23.070 
hidden powers being the time especially

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:25.219 
hidden powers being the time especially
defensive<00:05:23.910> but<00:05:24.150> judging<00:05:24.570> by<00:05:24.600> the<00:05:24.750> damage<00:05:25.080> has

00:05:25.219 --> 00:05:25.229 
defensive but judging by the damage has

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:26.920 
defensive but judging by the damage has
