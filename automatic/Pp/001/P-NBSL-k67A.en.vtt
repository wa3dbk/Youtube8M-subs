00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.179
 Then it was a fracture from the first time around town 

00:00:14.109 --> 00:00:16.290
 Unlike Mr. Kurose and a carpenter 

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:17.600
 The sixth sheet 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.630
 There are very few roads 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.649
 So I am very compact after publishing 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:26.579
 It was not easy goal 

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:27.820
 First of all 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.009
 There is a cutter 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:33.970
 It is a senya 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:36.970
 30 cm boss 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.530
 Month 1 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:44.250
 driver 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.140
 Mainspring same day 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:48.640
 It is a raster 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.550
 You can do enough with this one 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:54.340
 City will explain one by one 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.140
 First of all, 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.240
 I usually introduce 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.470
 Kurose is often said to the server 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:03.650
 You can not basically use the middle stage 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:05.120
 But why 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.030
 In the middle 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.150
 Because it is very weak to the side play 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.170
 When I use a sheet, I use it as an agent, which makes it difficult at that time 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.490
 Although it is a work area 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.740
 Blur next to only 42 minutes makes it very difficult for hard days 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.960
 So usually not 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.230
 Please use small 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:26.230
 Explanation on the next page 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.750
 Please use the power to be cased 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.770
 Basically everything is .6 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.770
 However, when things are bad you can use it in your schedule 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.300
 Unlike the abdomen 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.020
 It looks like it's not doing 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:40.420
 It is the sixth seed 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:41.550
 Because 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:45.240
 How to use the train after 1.2 or so in the small countryside 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.430
 It looks like so in that part also Hasuji 0 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.470
 Please use point 6 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.470
 I'm kidding next 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.630
 gv-rx want to joint when you're in the oral type of class 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.080
 Because it's rough 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.650
 I get stuck, but the sixth seed 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.190
 It slips because the surface is slippery 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:09.900
 So I expect that I will be twisted when I work on joints and so on 

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:11.289
 Can not 

00:02:11.289 --> 00:02:13.549
 Why usually 

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:16.699
 I use a ruler like this It is Nagao and it is piti 

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:20.129
 I will never do it yellow 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:23.329
 It's a heavy oil method, but it seems to be thin like this 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:25.589
 I am in the city 

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:27.419
 Not this 

00:02:27.419 --> 00:02:31.079
 In this way, choose a type that you don't know so by pressure 

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:33.479
 Please give me 

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:36.729
 Why not tell the fortune telling alert and anti-slip 

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:38.309
 can 

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:40.279
 As I said earlier 

00:02:40.279 --> 00:02:43.799
 It's slippery as a sixth tool so it's back like this 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:46.679
 Please use a ruler that is fluctuating 

00:02:46.679 --> 00:02:48.000
 Though it is thin 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.070
 In suspicion of that woman 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:50.299
 that 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:53.360
 If you can use a cutter, please do not write this number 

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:54.039
 Follow 

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:57.129
 Please use the reverse rotation language of numbers. 

00:02:57.869 --> 00:03:00.869
 It is easy to get up by email 

00:03:01.429 --> 00:03:04.429
 It is common to use the back eye for strong enemies 

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:08.259
 I like the monthly co-op 

00:03:08.779 --> 00:03:11.739
 Squerian but usually follow the articles 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:14.739
 No one to use 

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:16.079
 Of the main 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:19.199
 With a clothed leaflet or with a load 

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:21.900
 It's like a special double-sided tape that says "Can I get it?" 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.969
 I resisted it because I had such a thing 

00:03:24.969 --> 00:03:27.969
 Become better Higa existing Higa 

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:31.169
 It is an article that I finished using 

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:33.569
 Put a cut like this 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:35.549
 It is possible 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:37.219
 In this way, letter delivery 

00:03:37.219 --> 00:03:40.769
 Fine parts by processing in the form of special processing 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:43.769
 Can be used for 

00:03:44.429 --> 00:03:47.089
 It is a driver 

00:03:47.089 --> 00:03:50.729
 It is said that a large ccie is an appliance 

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:52.439
 I take off and use 

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:53.949
 Like nine people remove 

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:55.559
 Sometimes needed 

00:03:55.559 --> 00:03:57.389
 Unlike the cross 

00:03:57.389 --> 00:04:00.599
 I do not do much to put it on the first stage after returning 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:01.630
 As much as possible 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:04.630
 I will carry out by taking off 

00:04:05.179 --> 00:04:08.389
 This narrow Roche Keiko was another thing at that time 

00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:11.349
 I also take something like this because I take off the details 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:14.539
 Very convenient to have 

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:17.659
 Finally I am walking with this master this buster 

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:20.150
 but 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:21.479
 Entering Peru 

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:24.800
 As it may come to a high thirty days ago 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.809
 Garbage of that time 

00:04:26.809 --> 00:04:29.539
 Use for 

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:32.749
 Fujimoto is especially prone to the year AD, so act firmly 

00:04:32.749 --> 00:04:35.689
 Clean up and use 

00:04:35.689 --> 00:04:37.719
 I will explain the horizontal 1-6
