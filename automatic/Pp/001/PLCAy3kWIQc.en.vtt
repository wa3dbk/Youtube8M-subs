 Herbal butter This recipe is divided 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.390

 which is used to remove the outer skin 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:56.630

 some salt pepper and the zest of 2 lemons 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.310

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:06.920
 will characterize these potatoes a little 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:11.030
 they are just very simple cups almost 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:15.020

 this parsley is called here 

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:30.500
 sage and rosemary and grass 

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:31.159

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:47.870
 the herbs more we say the aromatic bouquets 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:50.299
 will develop into our famous famous 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:53.450
 arrival and herb butter 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:58.299
 ok guys very easy preparation 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:03:01.790
 fast we go immediately to realize it 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:03.829
 so let's start immediately with potatoes or 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:05.950
 open the package io charlot eo 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:08.540
 rinsed the potatoes very quickly 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.519
 under cold water 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:14.109
 after which I took the two lemons from the 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:18.010
 recipe hot and sides with the help of a 

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:21.079
 potato peeler and I kept burning it 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:25.389
 let's make a layer in ours 

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:28.940
 lemon steamer that's it 

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:30.139
 we must try to take a hundred 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:34.940
 percent 

00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:39.949
 all the flavors of the lemon that we 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:42.500
 over our potatoes we also put the 

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:46.930
 scorzetta that as I mentioned with 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:48.919
 the help of the potato peeler we have 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:54.609
 let's say taken away 

00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:54.609
 let's put it all ok 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:04:00.260
 put a pinch of salt 

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:13.109
 slightly salt which is pepper 

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:17.549
 nothing else now as we have 

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:21.090
 formed this our plan of the 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:24.030
 steamer we put it on the panella 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:28.410
 on the pan and cook it with 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:30.530
 the lid for about 20 25 minutes 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:34.050
 in any case, then check the cooking 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:38.630
 while the potatoes cook us there 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:38.630
 we take care of the herb butter 

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:44.940
 let's take care of our butter now 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:48.449
 first or chopped in a way 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:52.139
 very very very fine very small it 

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:54.810
 mirror the garlic clove not only 

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:57.210
 chopped but the most kind with the knife and 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:59.389
 having to show anyway it doesn't 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:02.639
 nothing with his own knife 

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:05.000
 crushed on the site I show it 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:07.830
 here you see your own knife 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:12.479
 crushed against the own cutting board 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:15.570
 recreates creating almost a cut or paste 

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:19.169
 that we put aside this 

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:21.270
 All together we gather the herbs together 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:24.930
 aromatic we want to put in 

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:28.770
 our butter meanwhile roughly the 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:31.110
 chop with a knife and after that once 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:34.139
 they are already coarsely chopped with 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:37.500
 the help of the mezzaluna the minuzzo in the 

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:40.259
 finer finer way they are 

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:42.599
 capable of doing what he did to 

00:05:40.259 --> 00:05:47.520
 this operation that boring and later 

00:05:42.599 --> 00:05:49.740
 let's continue along with this 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:52.289
 point the bulk of the recipe is done 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:54.780
 therefore, either garlic or garlic is grouped together 

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:57.509
 my aromatic herbs to which it has come as well 

00:05:54.780 --> 00:06:00.810
 he complains that I forgot earlier 

00:05:57.509 --> 00:06:03.820
 to say here on the spoon with the help of 

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:07.720
 I put the butter in an electric mixer 

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:12.580
 softened towards my scream armed co 

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:15.870
 ok this but let's put it aside and put it 

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:19.690
 a beautiful and generous pinch of salt 

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:24.580
 we operate the electric mixer for 

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:26.920
 homogenize the whole ok after five 

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:30.070
 minutes of processing our butter 

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:32.970
 the herbs are ready, we just have to 

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:36.730
 transfer it to a serving bowl 

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:39.370

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:41.400

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:11.650
