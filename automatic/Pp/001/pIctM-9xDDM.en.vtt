this<00:00:02.610> is<00:00:02.790> a<00:00:02.820> video<00:00:03.030> for<00:00:03.899> a<00:00:03.929> gentleman<00:00:04.529> that

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:05.720 
this is a video for a gentleman that

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.470 
this is a video for a gentleman that
just<00:00:06.720> recently<00:00:06.930> asked<00:00:07.529> him<00:00:07.620> the<00:00:07.710> question<00:00:08.480> and

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
just recently asked him the question and

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.720 
just recently asked him the question and
I<00:00:09.809> hadn't<00:00:10.170> thought<00:00:10.320> about<00:00:10.380> it<00:00:10.679> for<00:00:11.460> a<00:00:11.490> long

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
I hadn't thought about it for a long

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.950 
I hadn't thought about it for a long
time<00:00:13.160> and<00:00:14.160> it<00:00:14.700> made<00:00:14.880> sense<00:00:15.210> to<00:00:15.420> me<00:00:15.509> now<00:00:15.599> that<00:00:15.900> I

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
time and it made sense to me now that I

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.500 
time and it made sense to me now that I
think<00:00:15.990> about<00:00:16.590> it<00:00:16.859> but<00:00:17.010> he<00:00:17.970> wanted<00:00:18.300> to<00:00:18.390> know

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
think about it but he wanted to know

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.650 
think about it but he wanted to know
what<00:00:18.930> all<00:00:19.050> these<00:00:19.320> pesky<00:00:19.650> hoses<00:00:20.640> were<00:00:20.820> for<00:00:21.150> all

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
what all these pesky hoses were for all

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.650 
what all these pesky hoses were for all
these<00:00:21.869> little<00:00:22.789> hoses<00:00:23.789> that<00:00:24.269> come<00:00:24.420> off<00:00:24.630> the

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
these little hoses that come off the

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.880 
these little hoses that come off the
carb<00:00:25.140> and<00:00:25.500> he<00:00:25.680> was<00:00:26.779> not<00:00:27.779> sure<00:00:28.140> where<00:00:28.410> they<00:00:28.619> went

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
carb and he was not sure where they went

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.209 
carb and he was not sure where they went
or<00:00:29.099> why<00:00:29.720> and<00:00:30.720> I'd<00:00:31.050> never<00:00:31.590> done<00:00:31.800> a<00:00:31.830> video<00:00:32.040> on

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
or why and I'd never done a video on

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.470 
or why and I'd never done a video on
that<00:00:32.369> so<00:00:32.820> I<00:00:32.850> want<00:00:33.300> to<00:00:33.360> go<00:00:34.320> over<00:00:34.559> it<00:00:34.620> very

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:35.480 
that so I want to go over it very

now on the top now this is just one way

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.849 
now on the top now this is just one way
of<00:00:51.780> doing<00:00:51.960> it<00:00:53.030> but<00:00:54.030> usually<00:00:55.020> your<00:00:55.649> largest

00:00:57.849 --> 00:00:57.859 
of doing it but usually your largest

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
your largest hose clamp will usually be

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:09.679 
your largest hose clamp will usually be
your<00:01:04.400> gas<00:01:05.400> Inlet<00:01:06.090> and<00:01:07.850> then<00:01:08.850> what<00:01:09.450> it<00:01:09.570> will

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
your gas Inlet and then what it will

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:18.140 
your gas Inlet and then what it will
have<00:01:09.930> is<00:01:10.290> at<00:01:10.530> least<00:01:10.830> one<00:01:11.790> vent<00:01:15.560> outlet<00:01:16.560> now<00:01:17.400> the

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
one vent hose they have to have that in

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.620 
one vent hose they have to have that in
order<00:01:32.340> for<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.700> vacuum<00:01:32.880> to<00:01:33.150> work<00:01:33.329> with<00:01:33.540> the

a couple other things that a carb may

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.060 
a couple other things that a carb may
have<00:01:41.630> now<00:01:42.630> if<00:01:42.930> you<00:01:43.259> look<00:01:43.470> in<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.710> front<00:01:43.890> of<00:01:44.009> the

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
have now if you look in the front of the

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.810 
have now if you look in the front of the
carb<00:01:44.340> right<00:01:44.880> here<00:01:45.210> on<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:46.259> top<00:01:46.790> there<00:01:47.790> is

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
carb right here on the top there is

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.200 
carb right here on the top there is
nothing<00:01:48.329> on<00:01:48.540> there<00:01:49.040> okay<00:01:50.040> but<00:01:50.610> if<00:01:50.850> you<00:01:50.970> look

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
nothing on there okay but if you look

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.969 
nothing on there okay but if you look
and<00:01:51.509> if<00:01:52.079> you<00:01:52.229> look<00:01:52.409> on<00:01:52.560> this<00:01:52.680> thirty

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
and if you look on this thirty

00:01:52.979 --> 00:02:00.139 
and if you look on this thirty
millimeter<00:01:53.430> on<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:54.149> top<00:01:55.070> you'll<00:01:56.070> see<00:01:56.369> a<00:01:59.149> small

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
millimeter on the top you'll see a small

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.819 
millimeter on the top you'll see a small
rise<00:02:00.630> right<00:02:00.990> there<00:02:03.170> okay<00:02:04.170> as<00:02:04.350> we<00:02:04.619> turn<00:02:04.799> the

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
rise right there okay as we turn the

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.999 
rise right there okay as we turn the
carb<00:02:05.219> over<00:02:05.729> you<00:02:06.450> notice<00:02:06.780> that<00:02:06.960> small<00:02:07.380> rise<00:02:07.619> has

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
carb over you notice that small rise has

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.680 
carb over you notice that small rise has
a<00:02:09.140> dimple<00:02:10.140> in<00:02:10.229> it<00:02:10.379> now<00:02:11.099> that<00:02:11.400> dimple<00:02:11.670> is<00:02:12.060> if<00:02:12.540> you

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
a dimple in it now that dimple is if you

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.370 
a dimple in it now that dimple is if you
want<00:02:12.900> to<00:02:12.989> drill

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
want to drill

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.260 
want to drill
into<00:02:13.830> that<00:02:13.980> and<00:02:14.430> put<00:02:15.240> in<00:02:16.610> what<00:02:17.610> we<00:02:17.640> have<00:02:18.000> in<00:02:18.180> the

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
into that and put in what we have in the

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.290 
into that and put in what we have in the
squinting<00:02:18.690> at<00:02:18.780> Hammond<00:02:19.140> apart<00:02:20.120> which<00:02:21.120> is<00:02:21.150> a

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
squinting at Hammond apart which is a

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.170 
squinting at Hammond apart which is a
vacuum<00:02:21.600> in<00:02:21.840> red<00:02:22.400> now<00:02:23.400> remember<00:02:23.760> this<00:02:23.880> is<00:02:24.030> on

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
vacuum in red now remember this is on

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:25.930 
vacuum in red now remember this is on
the<00:02:24.270> front<00:02:24.480> of<00:02:24.540> the<00:02:24.630> car

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
the front of the car

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.640 
the front of the car
okay<00:02:26.940> the<00:02:27.180> vacuum<00:02:27.540> inlet<00:02:27.810> is<00:02:27.990> usually<00:02:28.350> not<00:02:28.530> on

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
okay the vacuum inlet is usually not on

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.950 
okay the vacuum inlet is usually not on
the<00:02:28.770> end<00:02:28.950> it's<00:02:29.220> on<00:02:29.370> the<00:02:29.520> front<00:02:29.790> I'll<00:02:30.690> go<00:02:30.870> over

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:30.960 
the end it's on the front I'll go over

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.210 
the end it's on the front I'll go over
that<00:02:31.050> in<00:02:31.230> a<00:02:31.890> minute

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
that in a minute

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.560 
that in a minute
sometimes<00:02:32.580> drilled<00:02:32.850> this<00:02:33.030> out<00:02:33.210> and<00:02:33.420> put<00:02:33.540> a

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
sometimes drilled this out and put a

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:41.420 
sometimes drilled this out and put a
vacuum<00:02:34.670> clamp<00:02:35.670> on<00:02:35.970> it<00:02:38.000> so<00:02:39.800> on<00:02:40.800> a<00:02:40.860> carb<00:02:41.220> you're

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
vacuum clamp on it so on a carb you're

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.640 
vacuum clamp on it so on a carb you're
you're<00:02:41.820> generally<00:02:42.390> going<00:02:42.510> to<00:02:42.570> find<00:02:42.780> your<00:02:43.230> fuel

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
you're generally going to find your fuel

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.100 
you're generally going to find your fuel

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
Inlet which is right here and you're

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:50.000 
Inlet which is right here and you're
going<00:02:46.230> to<00:02:46.290> find<00:02:46.530> at<00:02:46.680> least<00:02:46.710> one<00:02:46.950> vent<00:02:49.010> outlet

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
going to find at least one vent outlet

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:56.500 
going to find at least one vent outlet
for<00:02:50.580> the<00:02:53.510> football<00:02:54.510> now<00:02:55.290> this<00:02:55.470> vent<00:02:55.740> outlet

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
for the football now this vent outlet

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:01.930 
for the football now this vent outlet
cannot<00:02:57.510> be<00:02:57.750> clogged<00:02:58.080> at<00:02:58.260> all<00:02:58.410> it<00:02:59.160> has<00:02:59.430> to<00:02:59.670> be<00:02:59.880> um

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
cannot be clogged at all it has to be um

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.600 
cannot be clogged at all it has to be um
it<00:03:02.940> has<00:03:03.180> it<00:03:03.420> you<00:03:03.540> have<00:03:03.720> to<00:03:03.870> have<00:03:04.050> a<00:03:04.290> hose<00:03:05.190> on<00:03:05.430> it

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
it has it you have to have a hose on it

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.240 
it has it you have to have a hose on it
preferably<00:03:06.240> because<00:03:07.140> sometimes<00:03:07.680> these<00:03:08.040> will

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
preferably because sometimes these will

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:09.950 
preferably because sometimes these will
spit<00:03:08.490> out<00:03:08.520> gas<00:03:08.880> and<00:03:09.210> that's<00:03:09.330> why<00:03:09.510> you<00:03:09.570> see<00:03:09.840> the

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:09.960 
spit out gas and that's why you see the

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.650 
spit out gas and that's why you see the
hoses<00:03:10.350> that<00:03:10.950> come<00:03:11.250> from<00:03:11.610> your<00:03:11.820> carb<00:03:12.120> and<00:03:12.450> they

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
hoses that come from your carb and they

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.750 
hoses that come from your carb and they
go<00:03:12.840> all<00:03:13.140> the<00:03:13.200> way<00:03:13.710> back<00:03:14.010> down<00:03:14.570> past<00:03:15.570> your<00:03:15.930> tire

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
go all the way back down past your tire

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.670 
go all the way back down past your tire
underneath<00:03:17.760> and<00:03:18.060> they<00:03:18.900> vent<00:03:19.170> out<00:03:19.380> there

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
underneath and they vent out there

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.760 
underneath and they vent out there
because<00:03:20.270> if<00:03:21.270> you<00:03:21.960> have<00:03:22.110> any<00:03:22.260> excess<00:03:22.560> gas

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:22.770 
because if you have any excess gas

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:24.200 
because if you have any excess gas
that's<00:03:23.130> where<00:03:23.280> it<00:03:23.370> goes<00:03:23.490> instead<00:03:23.850> of<00:03:24.060> all<00:03:24.180> of

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:24.210 
that's where it goes instead of all of

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:27.590 
that's where it goes instead of all of
your<00:03:24.540> your<00:03:24.990> your<00:03:25.380> bike<00:03:25.680> or<00:03:25.920> your<00:03:26.010> motor<00:03:26.360> now<00:03:27.360> on

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
your your your bike or your motor now on

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.880 
your your your bike or your motor now on
the<00:03:27.780> bigger<00:03:27.990> cards<00:03:29.780> the<00:03:30.780> the<00:03:31.380> theory<00:03:31.740> holds

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
the bigger cards the the theory holds

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:36.010 
the bigger cards the the theory holds
exactly<00:03:32.490> true<00:03:32.780> they<00:03:33.780> should<00:03:34.020> have<00:03:34.230> a<00:03:34.500> vent<00:03:34.920> on

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:36.020 
exactly true they should have a vent on

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:41.680 
exactly true they should have a vent on
this<00:03:37.020> side<00:03:37.230> and<00:03:37.470> event<00:03:38.300> on<00:03:39.560> the<00:03:40.560> other<00:03:40.830> side

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:41.690 
this side and event on the other side

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:44.900 
this side and event on the other side
now<00:03:42.690> on<00:03:42.900> this<00:03:43.080> one<00:03:43.320> the<00:03:43.860> fuel<00:03:44.130> Inlet<00:03:44.490> is<00:03:44.700> right

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
now on this one the fuel Inlet is right

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.940 
now on this one the fuel Inlet is right
here<00:03:45.150> it<00:03:46.050> has<00:03:46.170> a<00:03:46.200> big<00:03:46.530> vent<00:03:46.800> or<00:03:47.010> a<00:03:47.070> big<00:03:47.870> Inlet

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
here it has a big vent or a big Inlet

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:54.560 
here it has a big vent or a big Inlet
this<00:03:49.950> is<00:03:50.250> the<00:03:50.610> vent<00:03:51.830> for<00:03:52.830> the<00:03:52.950> right<00:03:53.130> side<00:03:53.570> or

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:54.570 
this is the vent for the right side or

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:58.010 
this is the vent for the right side or
let's<00:03:54.810> say<00:03:54.960> the<00:03:55.200> yeah<00:03:55.770> the<00:03:55.920> right<00:03:56.040> I<00:03:57.020> think

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:58.020 
let's say the yeah the right I think

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.680 
let's say the yeah the right I think
well<00:03:58.230> one<00:03:58.530> side<00:03:58.770> anyway<00:03:59.190> now<00:03:59.970> the<00:04:00.060> other<00:04:00.300> vent

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
well one side anyway now the other vent

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.440 
well one side anyway now the other vent
is<00:04:00.870> an<00:04:01.140> interesting<00:04:01.740> place<00:04:01.950> the<00:04:02.730> other<00:04:03.000> vent

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
is an interesting place the other vent

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:09.440 
is an interesting place the other vent
is<00:04:03.690> right<00:04:04.110> down<00:04:04.350> here<00:04:05.240> on<00:04:06.860> the<00:04:07.860> bottom<00:04:08.010> and<00:04:08.450> why

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 
is right down here on the bottom and why

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.210 
is right down here on the bottom and why
it's<00:04:09.630> like<00:04:09.810> that<00:04:10.080> it<00:04:10.320> must<00:04:10.500> be<00:04:10.650> a<00:04:10.680> new<00:04:10.860> design

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
it's like that it must be a new design

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:16.880 
it's like that it must be a new design
on<00:04:11.520> all<00:04:12.270> the<00:04:12.450> older<00:04:12.840> carburetors<00:04:14.390> if<00:04:15.739> you<00:04:16.739> look

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:16.890 
on all the older carburetors if you look

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:19.220 
on all the older carburetors if you look
right<00:04:17.100> down<00:04:17.250> here<00:04:17.640> on<00:04:17.760> the<00:04:18.630> bottom<00:04:18.840> this<00:04:19.170> is

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:19.230 
right down here on the bottom this is

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:22.790 
right down here on the bottom this is
not<00:04:19.530> a<00:04:19.560> vent<00:04:19.940> if<00:04:20.940> there<00:04:21.390> is<00:04:21.600> a<00:04:21.800> corresponding

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
not a vent if there is a corresponding

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.720 
not a vent if there is a corresponding
screw<00:04:23.220> on<00:04:23.460> the<00:04:23.820> other<00:04:23.850> side

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:25.730 
screw on the other side

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:29.170

of<00:04:25.930> the<00:04:26.930> suppose<00:04:27.800> event<00:04:28.190> then<00:04:28.460> it's<00:04:28.640> not<00:04:28.790> event

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180 
of the suppose event then it's not event

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:46.550 
here now I'll tell you why it's there on

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:50.080 
here now I'll tell you why it's there on
a<00:05:46.610> lot<00:05:46.970> of<00:05:47.090> these<00:05:47.180> mopeds<00:05:48.790> there<00:05:49.790> are<00:05:49.940> two

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:50.090 
a lot of these mopeds there are two

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:51.850 
a lot of these mopeds there are two
lines<00:05:50.330> that<00:05:50.510> come<00:05:50.720> off<00:05:50.840> the<00:05:50.870> gas<00:05:51.200> tank<00:05:51.560> of<00:05:51.740> the

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:51.860 
lines that come off the gas tank of the

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:55.930 
lines that come off the gas tank of the
fuel<00:05:52.220> tank<00:05:52.490> one<00:05:53.300> goes<00:05:53.660> to<00:05:53.690> the<00:05:54.050> inlet<00:05:54.470> and<00:05:54.940> one

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:55.940 
fuel tank one goes to the inlet and one

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:58.030 
fuel tank one goes to the inlet and one
will<00:05:56.150> go<00:05:56.270> to<00:05:56.330> the<00:05:56.510> vacuum<00:05:56.900> line<00:05:57.110> now<00:05:57.710> this<00:05:57.830> is

00:05:58.030 --> 00:05:58.040 
will go to the vacuum line now this is

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:02.110 
will go to the vacuum line now this is
for<00:05:58.310> safety<00:05:58.550> reasons<00:05:59.410> because<00:06:00.550> the<00:06:01.550> gasoline

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:02.120 
for safety reasons because the gasoline

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:06.490 
for safety reasons because the gasoline
or<00:06:02.540> the<00:06:02.690> gas<00:06:04.510> tank<00:06:05.510> itself

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:06.500 
or the gas tank itself

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:11.590 
or the gas tank itself
I<00:06:07.060> can<00:06:08.060> I<00:06:08.410> can<00:06:09.410> zoom<00:06:09.650> in<00:06:09.860> on<00:06:09.980> this<00:06:10.190> it<00:06:11.120> has<00:06:11.270> a<00:06:11.300> pet

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:11.600 
I can I can zoom in on this it has a pet

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:14.800 
I can I can zoom in on this it has a pet
 right<00:06:12.050> down<00:06:12.200> here<00:06:13.240> I'll<00:06:14.240> see<00:06:14.390> if<00:06:14.450> I<00:06:14.510> lift

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:14.810 
 right down here I'll see if I lift

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:18.580 
 right down here I'll see if I lift
that<00:06:14.870> up<00:06:15.110> just<00:06:15.380> a<00:06:15.560> little<00:06:15.590> bit<00:06:16.330> and<00:06:17.330> see<00:06:17.590> where

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:18.590 
that up just a little bit and see where

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:23.740 
that up just a little bit and see where
is<00:06:18.650> it<00:06:18.800> so<00:06:19.580> I<00:06:19.610> made<00:06:19.820> here<00:06:20.690> that<00:06:22.270> pet<00:06:23.270> cop<00:06:23.510> down

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:23.750 
is it so I made here that pet cop down

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:26.050 
is it so I made here that pet cop down
there<00:06:23.780> if<00:06:23.990> you<00:06:24.050> will<00:06:24.260> see<00:06:24.410> that<00:06:24.620> silver<00:06:25.100> disks

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:26.060 
there if you will see that silver disks

00:06:26.060 --> 00:06:28.870 
there if you will see that silver disks
thing<00:06:26.270> has<00:06:26.720> a<00:06:27.170> large<00:06:28.010> line<00:06:28.310> coming<00:06:28.640> off<00:06:28.760> the

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:28.880 
thing has a large line coming off the

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:32.380 
thing has a large line coming off the
top<00:06:29.090> right<00:06:29.360> there<00:06:29.630> and<00:06:29.780> a<00:06:30.230> small<00:06:30.590> line<00:06:31.390> coming

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:32.390 
top right there and a small line coming

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:36.550 
top right there and a small line coming
off<00:06:32.630> the<00:06:32.900> bottom<00:06:33.230> and<00:06:33.380> that<00:06:34.310> small<00:06:34.730> line<00:06:34.970> is<00:06:35.560> a

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:36.560 
off the bottom and that small line is a

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:38.060 
off the bottom and that small line is a
vacuum<00:06:37.070> line

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:38.070 
vacuum line

00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:44.480 
vacuum line
and<00:06:38.160> what<00:06:38.310> that<00:06:38.490> does<00:06:38.760> is<00:06:40.040> if<00:06:41.040> the<00:06:43.280> if<00:06:44.280> the

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:44.490 
and what that does is if the if the

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:46.930 
and what that does is if the if the
engine<00:06:44.790> is<00:06:44.880> running<00:06:45.180> and<00:06:45.450> creating<00:06:46.020> a<00:06:46.140> vacuum

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:46.940 
engine is running and creating a vacuum

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:53.690 
engine is running and creating a vacuum
then<00:06:47.940> it<00:06:48.480> will<00:06:48.900> open<00:06:50.240> the<00:06:51.240> fuel<00:06:51.450> tank<00:06:51.810> to<00:06:52.700> the

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:53.700 
then it will open the fuel tank to the

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:57.500 
then it will open the fuel tank to the
fuel<00:06:53.910> line<00:06:55.070> if<00:06:56.070> the<00:06:56.310> bike<00:06:56.490> is<00:06:56.520> shut<00:06:56.940> off<00:06:56.970> or<00:06:57.420> the

00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:57.510 
fuel line if the bike is shut off or the

00:06:57.510 --> 00:06:59.390 
fuel line if the bike is shut off or the
bike<00:06:57.630> is<00:06:57.810> tipped<00:06:58.050> over<00:06:58.200> if<00:06:58.530> the<00:06:58.680> bike<00:06:58.860> engine

00:06:59.390 --> 00:06:59.400 
bike is tipped over if the bike engine

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:03.050 
bike is tipped over if the bike engine
is<00:06:59.520> not<00:06:59.700> running<00:07:00.050> then<00:07:01.050> the<00:07:01.200> vacuum<00:07:02.060> petcock

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:03.060 
is not running then the vacuum petcock

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:07.430 
is not running then the vacuum petcock
closes<00:07:03.890> to<00:07:04.890> avoid<00:07:05.190> gas<00:07:05.490> or<00:07:05.790> fuel<00:07:06.120> beans<00:07:06.440> being

I hope that cleared up some of the why

00:07:36.569 --> 00:07:38.749 
I hope that cleared up some of the why
