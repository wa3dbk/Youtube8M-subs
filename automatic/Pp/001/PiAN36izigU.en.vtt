discussing and I'm going to be

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.270 
discussing and I'm going to be
discussing<00:00:05.790> demonstrating<00:00:06.540> the<00:00:07.529> missiles

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
discussing demonstrating the missiles

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.160 
discussing demonstrating the missiles
today<00:00:11.240> by<00:00:12.240> the<00:00:12.300> way<00:00:12.480> I'm<00:00:12.599> sorry<00:00:12.780> I<00:00:12.929> couldn't

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
today by the way I'm sorry I couldn't

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:14.930 
today by the way I'm sorry I couldn't
demonstrate<00:00:13.349> the<00:00:13.799> fourth<00:00:14.070> field<00:00:14.309> of<00:00:14.519> missile

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
demonstrate the fourth field of missile

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.019 
demonstrate the fourth field of missile
detectors<00:00:15.890> they<00:00:16.890> should<00:00:17.070> even<00:00:17.310> use<00:00:17.609> that<00:00:17.640> one

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
detectors they should even use that one

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.090 
detectors they should even use that one
actually<00:00:18.210> I<00:00:18.600> can<00:00:19.410> I<00:00:19.560> might<00:00:19.800> be<00:00:19.949> able<00:00:20.039> to

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
actually I can I might be able to

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.279 
actually I can I might be able to
demonstrate<00:00:20.580> this<00:00:20.840> that's<00:00:21.840> a<00:00:21.930> little<00:00:22.109> bit<00:00:22.230> of

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
demonstrate this that's a little bit of

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.720 
demonstrate this that's a little bit of
luck<00:00:22.850> let's<00:00:23.850> start<00:00:24.180> shall<00:00:24.449> we<00:00:25.430> set<00:00:26.430> that<00:00:26.580> right

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
luck let's start shall we set that right

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.890 
luck let's start shall we set that right
there<00:00:27.380> John<00:00:28.519> respond<00:00:29.519> and<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:29.699> missile<00:00:30.000> now

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
there John respond and the missile now

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.170 
there John respond and the missile now
there's<00:00:31.740> many<00:00:32.009> types<00:00:32.250> of<00:00:32.460> missiles<00:00:32.790> started

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
there's many types of missiles started

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.660 
there's many types of missiles started
with<00:00:33.360> petroleum<00:00:34.079> and<00:00:34.950> going<00:00:35.250> all<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.430> way<00:00:35.460> up

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
with petroleum and going all the way up

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.400 
with petroleum and going all the way up
to<00:00:35.880> traveling<00:00:37.309> now<00:00:38.309> let's<00:00:38.690> compare<00:00:39.690> the

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
to traveling now let's compare the

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.799 
to traveling now let's compare the
effectiveness<00:00:40.890> buoys<00:00:41.430> to<00:00:41.610> look<00:00:41.879> for<00:00:42.390> example

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
effectiveness buoys to look for example

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:49.660 
effectiveness buoys to look for example
I<00:00:43.160> faith<00:00:44.160> petroleum<00:00:46.309> doesn't<00:00:47.309> even<00:00:47.399> have<00:00:47.550> the

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:49.670 
I faith petroleum doesn't even have the

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.090 
I faith petroleum doesn't even have the
enough<00:00:50.670> thrust<00:00:51.030> to<00:00:51.180> move<00:00:51.360> itself<00:00:52.100> trilithium

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
enough thrust to move itself trilithium

00:00:53.100 --> 00:01:02.840 
enough thrust to move itself trilithium
on<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.550> other<00:00:53.670> hand<00:00:58.520> the<00:00:59.520> ox<00:01:01.520> not<00:01:02.520> enough<00:01:02.760> to

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
on the other hand the ox not enough to

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.359 
on the other hand the ox not enough to
push<00:01:03.030> itself<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.989> hydrogen<00:01:04.589> is<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:05.040> weakest

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
push itself the hydrogen is the weakest

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.280 
push itself the hydrogen is the weakest
one

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:09.290 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:15.760 

antimatter<00:01:10.250> works<00:01:10.580> rather<00:01:10.790> well<00:01:14.770> however

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
antimatter works rather well however

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.360 
antimatter works rather well however
there's<00:01:15.950> two<00:01:16.250> theories<00:01:16.550> I've<00:01:16.850> had<00:01:17.030> with<00:01:17.240> why

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:18.370 
there's two theories I've had with why

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:23.340 
there's two theories I've had with why
my<00:01:19.370> theory<00:01:19.640> is<00:01:19.760> everything<00:01:20.410> trilithium<00:01:21.410> is

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:23.350 
my theory is everything trilithium is

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:29.650 
my theory is everything trilithium is
simply<00:01:24.350> a<00:01:24.380> little<00:01:24.620> bit<00:01:24.710> of<00:01:24.800> a<00:01:24.860> coaster<00:01:28.510> this<00:01:29.510> is

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:29.660 
simply a little bit of a coaster this is

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:31.180 
simply a little bit of a coaster this is
a<00:01:29.690> Tomahawk<00:01:30.200> missile<00:01:30.620> I'm<00:01:30.860> gonna<00:01:30.980> show<00:01:31.130> you

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:31.190 
a Tomahawk missile I'm gonna show you

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:32.530 
a Tomahawk missile I'm gonna show you
the<00:01:31.370> effects<00:01:31.640> I'm<00:01:31.850> going<00:01:32.000> to<00:01:32.060> try<00:01:32.240> and<00:01:32.360> show

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.540 
the effects I'm going to try and show

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.590 
the effects I'm going to try and show
off<00:01:32.570> the<00:01:32.990> force<00:01:33.380> field<00:01:34.300> really<00:01:35.300> love<00:01:35.450> the

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
off the force field really love the

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:45.550 
off the force field really love the
tongue<00:01:35.750> box<00:01:42.820> it's<00:01:43.820> a<00:01:44.030> equivalent<00:01:44.810> explosion

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
tongue box it's a equivalent explosion

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.700 
tongue box it's a equivalent explosion
force<00:01:45.860> of<00:01:46.070> a<00:01:46.130> JDM<00:01:46.550> except<00:01:47.060> it's<00:01:47.210> a<00:01:47.270> missile<00:01:47.710> so

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
force of a JDM except it's a missile so

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.680 
force of a JDM except it's a missile so
let's<00:01:48.890> see<00:01:49.130> if<00:01:49.310> I<00:01:49.430> can<00:01:49.640> get<00:01:49.790> this<00:01:49.910> to<00:01:49.970> work<00:01:50.390> I

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:50.690 
let's see if I can get this to work I

00:01:50.690 --> 00:02:10.570 
let's see if I can get this to work I
have<00:01:51.229> had<00:02:08.530> you<00:02:09.530> have<00:02:09.649> to<00:02:09.800> hit<00:02:09.890> this<00:02:10.130> side<00:02:10.369> from

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
have had you have to hit this side from

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.080 
have had you have to hit this side from
my<00:02:10.790> being<00:02:11.240> able<00:02:11.300> to<00:02:11.480> test<00:02:11.690> so<00:02:12.440> there<00:02:12.620> you<00:02:12.709> go

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
my being able to test so there you go

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.150 
my being able to test so there you go
now<00:02:14.090> we're<00:02:14.239> going<00:02:14.330> to<00:02:14.390> move<00:02:14.510> up<00:02:14.720> to<00:02:14.959> the<00:02:15.709> G<00:02:15.980> this

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
now we're going to move up to the G this

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.720 
now we're going to move up to the G this
is<00:02:16.310> the<00:02:16.430> ICBM<00:02:17.030> this<00:02:17.300> is<00:02:17.450> what<00:02:17.630> you<00:02:17.750> would<00:02:18.730> load

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
is the ICBM this is what you would load

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.030 
is the ICBM this is what you would load
up<00:02:19.760> a<00:02:20.120> nuke<00:02:20.750> on<00:02:20.959> up<00:02:21.200> here<00:02:21.500> what<00:02:21.650> you<00:02:21.770> would<00:02:21.890> do

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
up a nuke on up here what you would do

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.860 
up a nuke on up here what you would do
is<00:02:22.370> you<00:02:22.670> would<00:02:22.700> build<00:02:23.030> your<00:02:23.150> custom<00:02:23.660> nuke

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
is you would build your custom nuke

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.470 
is you would build your custom nuke
which<00:02:24.050> we<00:02:24.200> will<00:02:24.380> later<00:02:24.580> you<00:02:25.580> put<00:02:26.030> it<00:02:26.150> on<00:02:26.239> there

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
which we will later you put it on there

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.440 
which we will later you put it on there
you<00:02:26.720> put<00:02:26.930> your<00:02:27.050> customer

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.350 

do<00:02:32.370> weld<00:02:33.370> it<00:02:33.520> all<00:02:33.640> together<00:02:33.760> put<00:02:34.000> a<00:02:34.209> nuclear

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
do weld it all together put a nuclear

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.110 
do weld it all together put a nuclear
initiator<00:02:34.959> on<00:02:35.200> top<00:02:35.440> and<00:02:35.739> then<00:02:36.700> you<00:02:36.970> would

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
initiator on top and then you would

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.600 
initiator on top and then you would
angle<00:02:37.510> it<00:02:37.599> correctly<00:02:38.020> so<00:02:38.140> let's<00:02:38.290> just<00:02:38.620> put<00:02:39.520> it

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
angle it correctly so let's just put it

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:44.839 
angle it correctly so let's just put it
right<00:02:39.670> here<00:02:39.790> for<00:02:40.090> example<00:02:40.569> I<00:02:41.640> have<00:02:42.640> a<00:02:43.800> prop

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:44.849 
right here for example I have a prop

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:48.330 
right here for example I have a prop
launch<00:02:45.849> thing<00:02:46.209> built<00:02:46.630> another<00:02:47.620> map<00:02:47.890> however

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
launch thing built another map however

00:02:48.340 --> 00:03:05.009 
launch thing built another map however
that's<00:02:48.670> not<00:02:51.870> and<00:02:52.870> you<00:02:53.020> just<00:02:53.170> activate<00:02:53.620> it<00:03:04.019> it

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:05.019 
that's not and you just activate it it

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:10.020 
that's not and you just activate it it
launches<00:03:06.900> um<00:03:08.430> better<00:03:09.430> place<00:03:09.700> is<00:03:09.880> actually

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
launches um better place is actually

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.020 
launches um better place is actually
over<00:03:10.269> here<00:03:10.660> and<00:03:11.340> then<00:03:12.340> there's<00:03:12.580> even<00:03:12.790> bigger

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
over here and then there's even bigger

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.759 
over here and then there's even bigger
missiles<00:03:13.480> by<00:03:13.630> the<00:03:13.690> way<00:03:14.280> the<00:03:15.280> worst<00:03:15.700> of<00:03:16.180> the

these as boosters on these or these in

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.430 
these as boosters on these or these in
fact<00:03:28.030> I<00:03:28.150> even<00:03:28.180> use<00:03:28.540> these<00:03:28.720> as<00:03:28.900> boosters<00:03:29.260> on

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
fact I even use these as boosters on

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.860 
fact I even use these as boosters on
that<00:03:30.569> anyways

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
that anyways

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.350

mystery<00:03:34.750> it's<00:03:35.049> almost<00:03:35.410> useless<00:03:35.680> in<00:03:36.040> my

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
mystery it's almost useless in my

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.729 
mystery it's almost useless in my
opinion<00:03:36.519> let's<00:03:37.359> see<00:03:37.510> if<00:03:37.570> you<00:03:37.690> found<00:03:37.900> a<00:03:38.019> use<00:03:38.500> for

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:38.739 
opinion let's see if you found a use for

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:40.199 
opinion let's see if you found a use for

00:03:53.650 --> 00:04:04.390 

there<00:03:54.650> it<00:03:54.740> goes<00:04:02.290> and<00:04:03.290> then<00:04:03.740> now<00:04:04.130> we're<00:04:04.310> gonna

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 
there it goes and then now we're gonna

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.450 
there it goes and then now we're gonna
launch<00:04:04.670> an<00:04:04.910> actual<00:04:05.710> the<00:04:06.710> missile<00:04:07.100> a<00:04:07.160> little

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:07.460 
launch an actual the missile a little

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:11.800 
launch an actual the missile a little
bit<00:04:07.550> better<00:04:08.390> this<00:04:08.630> time<00:04:09.910> anyways<00:04:10.910> at<00:04:11.570> the<00:04:11.690> end

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:11.810 
bit better this time anyways at the end

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:32.670 
bit better this time anyways at the end
there

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 
you one of them is the German v2 which

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.070 
you one of them is the German v2 which
is<00:04:39.110> my<00:04:39.230> favorite<00:04:39.880> however<00:04:40.880> this<00:04:41.420> one<00:04:41.690> is<00:04:41.720> also

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:00.600 

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.150 

launching<00:05:01.350> them<00:05:01.500> takes<00:05:01.710> a<00:05:01.830> bit<00:05:01.950> of<00:05:01.980> practice

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.160 
launching them takes a bit of practice

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:06.170 
launching them takes a bit of practice
I've<00:05:02.610> got<00:05:03.530> no<00:05:04.530> mask<00:05:05.100> mean<00:05:05.430> I<00:05:05.580> may<00:05:05.790> or<00:05:05.910> may<00:05:06.030> not

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:09.420 
be able to explain how to do it the v2

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:10.490 
be able to explain how to do it the v2
you're<00:05:09.960> going<00:05:10.080> to<00:05:10.140> notice<00:05:10.260> the<00:05:10.470> difference

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:10.500 
you're going to notice the difference

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:13.150 
you're going to notice the difference
right<00:05:10.890> away<00:05:10.950> by<00:05:11.250> the<00:05:11.310> just<00:05:12.000> Li<00:05:12.150> guys<00:05:12.360> know

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:13.160 
right away by the just Li guys know

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.500 
right away by the just Li guys know
compared<00:05:14.160> to<00:05:14.190> how<00:05:14.310> fat<00:05:14.550> the<00:05:14.940> long<00:05:15.120> it<00:05:15.240> took<00:05:15.330> the

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:15.510 
compared to how fat the long it took the

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:26.110 
compared to how fat the long it took the
other<00:05:15.630> ones<00:05:15.810> to<00:05:15.900> take<00:05:16.050> off<00:05:22.520> it<00:05:23.520> moves<00:05:23.850> fast

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:26.120 
other ones to take off it moves fast

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:54.920 
other ones to take off it moves fast
there<00:05:27.120> goes<00:05:51.980> so<00:05:52.980> the<00:05:53.820> v2<00:05:54.120> is<00:05:54.180> my<00:05:54.360> favourite

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:54.930 
there goes so the v2 is my favourite

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:56.960 
there goes so the v2 is my favourite
now<00:05:55.290> you<00:05:55.350> can<00:05:55.770> strap<00:05:56.130> bombs<00:05:56.400> to<00:05:56.610> them<00:05:56.820> by<00:05:56.910> the

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:56.970 
now you can strap bombs to them by the

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:03.200 
now you can strap bombs to them by the
way<00:05:57.200> for<00:05:58.200> example<00:05:58.460> he's<00:05:59.460> so<00:05:59.670> wished<00:05:59.970> you<00:06:02.210> do

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:03.210 
way for example he's so wished you do

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:06.180 
way for example he's so wished you do
this

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:06.190 

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:11.310 

again<00:06:07.190> ICBM<00:06:07.760> just<00:06:08.300> throw<00:06:08.660> on<00:06:08.980> Tybee<00:06:09.980> reom<00:06:10.220> just

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:11.320 
again ICBM just throw on Tybee reom just

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:23.200 
again ICBM just throw on Tybee reom just
you<00:06:12.320> know<00:06:12.910> do<00:06:13.910> this<00:06:18.100> welder<00:06:19.100> oh<00:06:21.880> so<00:06:22.880> it<00:06:23.000> has

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:23.210 
you know do this welder oh so it has

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:24.520 
you know do this welder oh so it has
this<00:06:23.420> so<00:06:23.570> you<00:06:23.630> know<00:06:23.720> what<00:06:23.840> to<00:06:23.930> do<00:06:24.050> some<00:06:24.290> people

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:24.530 
this so you know what to do some people

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:25.210 
this so you know what to do some people
may<00:06:24.650> not<00:06:24.800> know

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:25.220 
may not know

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:28.200 
may not know
activate<00:06:26.180> the<00:06:26.300> Tiberium<00:06:26.870> that's<00:06:27.050> the<00:06:27.260> warrior

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:28.210 
activate the Tiberium that's the warrior

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:32.050 
activate the Tiberium that's the warrior
another<00:06:29.210> noise<00:06:29.390> outside<00:06:30.610> anyways<00:06:31.610> you<00:06:31.940> can

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:32.060 
another noise outside anyways you can

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:51.620 
another noise outside anyways you can
ignore<00:06:32.360> that<00:06:32.650> and<00:06:33.650> the<00:06:34.160> ignited

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:51.630 

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:53.570 

so<00:06:52.110> the<00:06:52.260> other<00:06:52.530> missiles<00:06:52.950> by<00:06:53.100> the<00:06:53.160> way<00:06:53.370> are

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:53.580 
so the other missiles by the way are

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:55.330 
so the other missiles by the way are
much<00:06:53.880> harder<00:06:54.120> to<00:06:54.240> mount<00:06:54.540> anything<00:06:54.960> on

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:55.340 
much harder to mount anything on

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:58.460 
much harder to mount anything on
actually<00:06:56.340> ICBM<00:06:56.820> this<00:06:57.360> one<00:06:57.540> I<00:06:57.750> have<00:06:58.020> a<00:06:58.110> dupe<00:06:58.320> in
