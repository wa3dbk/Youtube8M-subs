00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:06.150
 on the phone line to alex diego 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:09.920
 those affected by these situations 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:12.630
 the non-payments with a series of 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:15.740
 unfulfilled promises by the 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.740
 directive when exporting 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:21.869
 like all calmer who plan 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.800
 almost where will they go now with this 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.800
 dolphin problem 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:32.190
 We hope this proposal will be resolved 

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:35.680
 that was practically paying them in four 

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:38.410
 monthly payments 25 percent each month 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.780
 you were the ones who rejected this because 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:43.989
 I also think it's smart at the moment 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.309
 of rejecting this proposal are you giving 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:48.070
 meet the operation and create football to 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:50.260
 the league itself mx to the rise mx that no 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.700
 there is an arrangement and they have to settle their 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.930
 debts before they reach the draft is 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.400
 that's where the matter is going 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.920
 what also that the others of the 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:00.080
 principle because this is a demand 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.590
 group then counted from the beginning 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:04.350
 that we write 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.870
 a proposal and we are sending it 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:10.140
 so what we are thinking is that 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:11.760
 is the people rejected it but we did not 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.229
 we can move from there because at the end of 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.740
 accounts and we're not going to do what they said 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:19.000
 no again 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:21.399
 then we will see that in the end it is that 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.280
 all as a brutal action or let's go 

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:28.119
 we will vote and write so the 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:32.660
 writer and electric want how much is the 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:35.860
 The debt is four months that's more 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:35.860
 [Music] 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:41.810
 a little bit if you know what the 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:44.330
 procedure comes the draft if dolphins 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.070
 he does not pay them obviously he would have no 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.260
 I would have the right to enter the draft 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.210
 obviously dolphins I want to go to 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.830
 draft but good the matter of Jose Luis 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.740
 Malibran is also an employee of 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:57.380
 Veronica Gonzalez Gonzalez Gutierrez 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.790
 Monica Gonzales at the end of the day 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.290
 they do not come in, they usually do not 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.270
 transactions of players you 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.100
 affects you or your colleagues in 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.330
 anti obviously can not be contracted 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:09.560
 with another team 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.560
 and 17 how good 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.110
 it does not affect me because I do not 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.030
 I belong to the cinema group 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.680
 ok and apart the lips we always have 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.390
 atlante fashion 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.250
 the only thing that I already have good debt 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.560
 economic 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:25.560
 in my case but a lot of 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.120
 scientists if they are the group in cinemas and 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.680
 they do have uncertainty that they do not 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:33.430
 they know the letters 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.430
 and good 

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:38.379
 so 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:46.719
 the rest is leaving Guatemala for 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:46.719
 enter Guatemala worse 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:56.450
 no no 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:04.400
 then forgive the guy else he sold you to 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.990
 Atlantean and from there the Atlantean starts to 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.990
 handle the transfers obviously not 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:14.150
 치lex how can you explain how 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:17.330
 because you are Aleppo and your own 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.650
 support are not within the decision of 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:22.160
 failure that gives commission of controversies 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:24.140
 of the payment due to them because they do not 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.180
 recognizes you told the people of the end 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:28.010
 it's because they do not recognize what you 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.300
 they owe the amount they owe you or what 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.130
 is the reason why they do not want it 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:35.690
 pay 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:36.800
 in the case that everyone in the sheet 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:40.940
 of demand 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:44.750
 circulate in the amount of contracts 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:47.090
 adjust ink is what happens is that 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:48.950
 when I came to theaters 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:51.819
 obviously normally in the equipment of 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:54.069
 Charles the football to live us 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:57.930
 then well I would say do not notice until 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:04:00.420
 that this paper or these photographs 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:04.780
 I am happy to go to the doctor 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:06.610
 Amen치bar and listen to ballet at the hotel 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:09.520
 it's good that we can not leave because 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:11.290
 if not already our mind is charging the 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:13.959
 In the end I decided with our 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:16.299
 compa침ero fernando sinecio stay 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:18.040
 opening us because the coal is a 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:21.430
 income diet is very difficult to be rented 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:24.250
 for less two years the concession existed 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:27.220
 malibran today is this how much it would cost me 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:29.320
 a month well what are the medium a 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:31.600
 amount in which perfect I'm going to stay 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:33.460
 I'm not going to search the hotel anymore 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:36.420
 of bakker against the jon cinemas for 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:39.280
 share expenses lodging expenses 

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:41.140
 nothing else that we have to pass the title 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:42.460
 you are going to charge the hotel until we 

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:47.340
 pay 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:49.470
 not in the one agreed he said 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:53.790
 all this 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:58.270
 and there were not a number of plans and it's 

00:04:53.790 --> 00:05:00.760
 I'm not, I'm not why I'm not 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:05.880
 good happy with the one we were 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:05.880
 because infecting amounts of clients 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:11.750
 Well, 치lex of good luck with 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:13.520
 keep on the subject what good 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:16.639
 that dare to speak how good it is 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:18.740
 dare to say things as they are 

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:20.240
 frontal way that Mexican soccer 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:23.960
 have to take responsibility 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:25.910
 immediate against what is the affectation 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:27.380
 to its own raw material which are the 

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:29.120
 footballers I think it has to be 

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:31.370
 the immediate decision by that and 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:33.229
 mariah de enrique bonilla and let them leave 

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:35.360
 of nonsense and stop stupid 

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:37.160
 because footballers are owed 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:38.509
 pay players to respect them 

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:40.370
 because if the footballers would not have 

00:05:38.509 --> 00:05:44.479
 football that simple and although it seems 

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:47.150
 so stupid me and my comment and my 

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:49.400
 reasoning well it's something that really 

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:51.110
 they do not value it as they should value it and 

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:54.169
 I think it's time for you 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:55.849
 Launch the shout to the former 

00:05:54.169 --> 00:05:57.979
 has a few transitions for the reason and 

00:05:55.849 --> 00:06:00.110
 is what we have done at the end of 

00:05:57.979 --> 00:06:01.759
 accounts we have raised our voices because it is 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:04.340
 something that corresponds we are not 

00:06:01.759 --> 00:06:06.229
 asking for anything that is not 

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:08.659
 stipulated then we have to 

00:06:06.229 --> 00:06:12.460
 solutions as soon as possible that I 

00:06:08.659 --> 00:06:12.460
 good what partner paper 

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:20.150
 but to remove from chamba in duckling the 

00:06:18.949 --> 00:06:24.020
 little cow 

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:24.020
 [Laughs] 

00:06:27.669 --> 00:06:32.469
 also alex diego is very populist
