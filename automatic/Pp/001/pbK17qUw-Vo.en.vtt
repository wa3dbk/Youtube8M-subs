00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:10.920
 Hello everyone , Dmitry, today we are 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:14.129
 believe on carburetors start here such 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.809
 here's a carburetor we have sales and how 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:18.180
 would very often not ask what 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.260
 carburetor what scooter is suitable 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.900
 whether to replace something 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.520
 and everything will work fine, let's 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.900
 Now consider what we have sales 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.640
 what is the difference and 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.220
 what can replace the case 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.830
 necessity means first carburetor 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.310
 we will look at this this standard 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:40.649
 carburetor which is used on 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:47.149
 dress af20 means further this dio af-18 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:49.260
 27 on 28 most likely so 30 31 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:51.690
 This is a standard carburetor with 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.399
 a standard diffuser but in general all 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.969
 did you see him you have such a scott 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.739
 then its just a difference from others 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.840
 igator 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:04.530
 carburetor is that the barrel diameter is 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.179
 it is 13 millimeters it 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.130
 standard carburetor which 

00:01:06.179 --> 00:01:10.560
 used on comes here such 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:16.229
 carburetor these carburetors are basically 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:18.829
 used on lead 90 on zx 34 he could 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:22.109
 to be used well and actually 

00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:26.279
 probably all the more I am not on others 

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:28.109
 models have not met so here and carburetor 

00:01:26.279 --> 00:01:31.049
 absolutely identical to the first that 

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:33.719
 You only saw the difference in y 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.700
 passing capacity of the diffuser itself 

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:38.999
 as you can see on this carburetor but it is not 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:41.189
 so he stood more, respectively 

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:44.719
 his power will be greater and his diameter 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:50.099
 barrel unlike the first carburetor 

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:52.740
 is 15 millimeters further 3 

00:01:50.099 --> 00:01:54.569
 carburetor 3 carburetors such 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.789
 perform such some kind of it white 

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:59.999
 body unlike the first two there 

00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:00.450
 The body is more yellow and it's white 

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:02.700
 body 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:08.819
 Means such carburetors basically 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:13.110
 used on dio 35 0 p in 48 patina 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:15.120
 100 with engine jeff 06 his 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.489
 the peculiarity is that it has 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.650
 pattern well, as if the diameter will be larger 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:22.349
 the diffuser is even larger barrel diameter of it 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.720
 is 18 millimeters already in contrast 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:27.299
 from 15 and 13 from the first two 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.459
 and its difference is that he has 

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:32.459
 carburetor breathing hole 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:34.890
 located here at the junction of fixing stix 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:38.299
 between textolite gasket which 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:40.200
 also slightly different between 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:42.379
 aluminum colleagues there he is 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.599
 attached here this is the 

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:48.000
 crushed the differences of these carburetors but 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:51.060
 at the same time all these carburetors 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.280
 absolutely interchangeable and absolutely that 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:57.180
 there you can put on 18 dio 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:59.280
 carburetor from lead 100 precipitation to 18 and not 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:03.599
 absolutely fit and absolutely 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:06.420
 will work but at the same time 18 will go 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:09.030
 a little faster and kukoboy she will have stock 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:11.159
 power a little more 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:15.090
 and the face you almost die by 

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:17.489
 power output in a subtle difference and all 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.560
 the rest is exactly the same so 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:21.180
 if you want to pump your little 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.180
 scooter let's say you set 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:26.370
 piston 65 dice either 72 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.769
 you can instead of the standard 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:32.790
 carburetor to take with a slightly increased 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:34.769
 a diffuser or even with a large and without 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.840
 problems you will you configure it and 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:38.700
 of course it will need to reconfigure and 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.129
 he will ride without problems 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:44.549
 yes of course the expense of being a little more 

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:47.609
 but such is his principle and more expense and 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:50.209
 more power returns here in this and 

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:53.609
 is the difference of these carburetors 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:56.280
 Today, it will probably be so short and 

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:58.319
 it is clear that they themselves were Dmitry 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.519
