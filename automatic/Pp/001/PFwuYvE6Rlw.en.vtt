to<00:04:17.530> do<00:04:17.709> with<00:04:17.859> that<00:04:17.949> cipher<00:04:18.400> we<00:04:18.549> saw<00:04:18.729> maybe<00:04:19.620> I've

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 
to do with that cipher we saw maybe I've

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.290 
to do with that cipher we saw maybe I've
switched<00:04:20.949> the<00:04:21.160> encryption<00:04:21.609> protocol<00:04:22.030> for<00:04:22.210> our

00:04:24.749 --> 00:04:24.759 
burst transmission for now what I want

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:26.100 
burst transmission for now what I want
to<00:04:24.850> do<00:04:24.940> is<00:04:24.970> use<00:04:25.210> a<00:04:25.240> different<00:04:25.660> method<00:04:25.690> for

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
to do is use a different method for

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:27.540
