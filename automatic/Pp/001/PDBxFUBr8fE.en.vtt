00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.390
 Next rafael is a friend of mine tested 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.429
 various cheese bread recipes up to 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.200
 that he found an ideal that is the one that 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.660
 I'm going to teach you now in a 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.099
 bowl put three cups of cheese 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.780
 cured grated mines 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:19.020
 but you can also use a combination 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.029
 of other cases use provolone parmesan 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.250
 use your creativity 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:27.689
 then add a cup and a half 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:33.270
 of a sour sprinkle a cup and a half of 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:36.350
 sweet sprinkle a teaspoon of salt and 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.350
 get your hands dirty 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.469
 break two eggs in a pot and beat well 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.469
 with the car 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.320
 then place in the cheese mixture 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:52.020
 add two tablespoons of olive oil 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:55.170
 extra virgin and 100 grams of butter 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:58.640
 without salt and stir well with your hands 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.640
 start making the dough 

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:07.129
 then add half a cup of 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.129
 milk and stir more 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:16.470
 if the batter is fighting in the hands 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.530
 put a little more time together 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:22.170
 Make the candy or sour and stir until it 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.770
 stay consistent and no longer 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.770
 sticking 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.630
 now just make polka dots and put on 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.340
 a baking sheet 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.799
 if you are not using a baking dish 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.079
 Nonstick I recommend lining it with 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.810
 butter and light paper to bake in 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:44.640
 oven at 200 degrees for 15 to 20 minutes 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.890
 keep an eye 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.869
 How are you doing your own? 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.619
 Make cheese bread the size you want 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.659
 to prefer 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:54.240
 and if you want you can even stuff it with more 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.759
 cheese with shredded chicken here I go 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.720
 to make a romeu julieta filling with the 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.720
 good love 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:11.819
 looks like they get crunchy on the outside and 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:14.700
 grinder inside 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:17.340
 besides super tasty here I made a 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.500
 big that I honestly found better than 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:23.060
 that small he gets more pull pulls 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.060
 inside the way I like it 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.690
 enjoy your food 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.310
 and then liked it because how easy it is after 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.690
