00:00:13.029 --> 00:00:19.400
 First prepare the strawberries 10 most 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:23.810
 cute strawberries 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:27.140
 remove the rest of the strawberries for decoration 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:34.599
 peel and cut into pieces 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:34.599
 in 4 eggs, separate the yolks from the proteins 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:50.270
 the yolks will go dough and the whites are sent 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:56.240
 refrigerator of 300 grams of sugar 150 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:01:00.610
 ship the dough by stirring the sugar and 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:03.380
 yolks now ship

 softened butter 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:13.400
 a little less than half a teaspoon of soda 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:14.060
 we extinguish with vinegar and we also send to the general 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.450

 the masses and will manage the flour add 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.890
 flour world crops usually 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:53.560
 so we did the test we have in common 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:59.009
 difficulty with the powder gone 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:59.009
 about 350 grams of flour 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:09.060
 divide the resulting dough into three parts 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:16.120
 since there will be 3 Korzh 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:19.709

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:57.870
 sidewalls beat whites in a strong foam 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:05.310
