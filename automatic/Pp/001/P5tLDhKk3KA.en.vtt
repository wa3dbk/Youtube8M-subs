00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
can also pass on to their children so a

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.580 
can also pass on to their children so a
lot<00:01:09.270> of<00:01:09.299> their<00:01:09.479> sons<00:01:09.720> are<00:01:09.900> not<00:01:09.990> playing<00:01:10.200> sports

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
of that nature because there's no energy

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.310

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
energy to be at our top when proteins

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.959 
energy to be at our top when proteins
proteins<00:02:04.890> all<00:02:05.189> that<00:02:05.310> kind<00:02:05.490> of<00:02:05.520> stuff<00:02:05.640> I<00:02:05.820> don't
