00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
think in the third quarter when he went

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.810 
think in the third quarter when he went
small<00:00:49.050> and<00:00:49.110> you<00:00:49.500> guys<00:00:49.649> stayed<00:00:50.039> rather<00:00:50.280> rangy

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
small and you guys stayed rather rangy

small and you guys stayed rather rangy
and<00:00:50.940> tall<00:00:51.180> and<00:00:51.449> really<00:00:52.289> at<00:00:52.530> that<00:00:52.590> point<00:00:52.770> i

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
and tall and really at that point i

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:54.470

think took control of this basketball
game<00:00:54.570> I<00:00:54.780> thought<00:00:54.930> it<00:00:54.989> was<00:00:55.050> a<00:00:55.110> good<00:00:55.199> decision<00:00:55.320> by
