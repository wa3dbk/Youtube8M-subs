so the

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:10.879 
so the
I<00:00:09.090> studied<00:00:09.690> all<00:00:09.900> kind<00:00:10.320> of<00:00:10.440> different<00:00:10.500> natural

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
I studied all kind of different natural

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:12.980 
I studied all kind of different natural
medicines<00:00:11.519> including<00:00:11.790> I<00:00:12.209> Vader<00:00:12.510> which<00:00:12.870> is

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
medicines including I Vader which is

medicine<00:00:15.959> and<00:00:16.320> all<00:00:16.949> of<00:00:17.099> these<00:00:17.250> different

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
medicine and all of these different

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.880 
medicine and all of these different
medical<00:00:17.910> systems<00:00:18.360> have<00:00:18.689> a<00:00:18.930> lot<00:00:19.410> of<00:00:19.439> common

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
medical systems have a lot of common

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.600 
medical systems have a lot of common
things<00:00:20.220> that<00:00:20.520> allow<00:00:21.330> them<00:00:21.570> to<00:00:21.779> make<00:00:22.200> them<00:00:22.349> work

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:22.610 
things that allow them to make them work

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:25.370 
things that allow them to make them work
so<00:00:23.610> with<00:00:23.939> the<00:00:24.029> wheel<00:00:24.180> of<00:00:24.210> health<00:00:24.599> what<00:00:25.290> I've

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
so with the wheel of health what I've

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.459 
so with the wheel of health what I've
done<00:00:25.410> is<00:00:25.529> to<00:00:25.739> still<00:00:26.070> all<00:00:26.309> this<00:00:26.460> information

00:00:27.459 --> 00:00:27.469 
done is to still all this information

00:00:27.469 --> 00:00:30.109 
done is to still all this information
one<00:00:28.469> aspect<00:00:28.800> of<00:00:28.950> the<00:00:29.040> wheel<00:00:29.219> of<00:00:29.250> health<00:00:29.610> is<00:00:29.849> our

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
one aspect of the wheel of health is our

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.299 
one aspect of the wheel of health is our
body<00:00:30.719> type<00:00:31.050> which<00:00:31.290> I've<00:00:31.439> represented<00:00:31.649> is<00:00:32.160> the

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
body type which I've represented is the

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.880 
body type which I've represented is the
wheel<00:00:32.520> itself<00:00:33.170> essentially<00:00:34.170> it's<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.590> body

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
wheel itself essentially it's the body

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.799 
wheel itself essentially it's the body
we've<00:00:35.129> been<00:00:35.309> given<00:00:35.640> it's<00:00:35.790> our<00:00:35.969> genetics<00:00:36.540> is

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
we've been given it's our genetics is

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.619 
we've been given it's our genetics is
what<00:00:37.290> we've<00:00:37.410> inherited<00:00:37.710> from<00:00:38.040> our<00:00:38.219> parents

00:00:38.619 --> 00:00:38.629 
what we've inherited from our parents

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:41.959 
what we've inherited from our parents
some<00:00:39.629> people<00:00:39.930> can<00:00:40.050> eat<00:00:40.320> and<00:00:40.649> drink<00:00:40.950> and<00:00:41.370> live

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
some people can eat and drink and live

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.840 
some people can eat and drink and live
quite<00:00:42.600> a<00:00:42.629> bad<00:00:42.929> lifestyle<00:00:43.530> but<00:00:43.829> yet<00:00:43.890> can<00:00:44.640> live<00:00:44.820> a

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
quite a bad lifestyle but yet can live a

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.509 
quite a bad lifestyle but yet can live a
long<00:00:45.149> time<00:00:45.260> with<00:00:46.260> others<00:00:46.620> how<00:00:46.769> to<00:00:46.800> really<00:00:47.309> look

00:00:47.509 --> 00:00:47.519 
long time with others how to really look

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:49.189 
long time with others how to really look
after<00:00:47.909> their<00:00:48.089> health<00:00:48.300> in<00:00:48.510> order<00:00:48.780> to<00:00:48.929> be<00:00:49.079> able

00:00:49.189 --> 00:00:49.199 
after their health in order to be able

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:51.290 
after their health in order to be able
to<00:00:49.469> be<00:00:49.620> in<00:00:49.769> the<00:00:49.800> world<00:00:50.010> so<00:00:50.820> essentially

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
to be in the world so essentially

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.720 
to be in the world so essentially
everybody<00:00:51.749> is<00:00:51.870> different<00:00:52.050> we<00:00:52.530> have<00:00:52.859> to<00:00:53.219> to

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
everybody is different we have to to

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.299 
everybody is different we have to to
look<00:00:53.760> at<00:00:54.089> our<00:00:54.269> body<00:00:54.510> type<00:00:54.870> of<00:00:55.309> constitutional

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
look at our body type of constitutional

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.880 
look at our body type of constitutional
health<00:00:56.609> because<00:00:57.569> that<00:00:58.109> enables<00:00:58.679> us<00:00:58.829> to

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
health because that enables us to

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.610 
health because that enables us to
understand<00:00:59.640> how<00:01:00.329> we<00:01:00.390> are<00:01:00.780> as<00:01:00.929> an<00:01:01.050> individual

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
understand how we are as an individual

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.930 
understand how we are as an individual
and<00:01:02.600> health<00:01:03.600> is<00:01:03.899> what<00:01:04.680> our<00:01:04.800> body<00:01:05.040> type<00:01:05.400> is<00:01:05.640> and

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:05.940 
and health is what our body type is and

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.719 
and health is what our body type is and
what<00:01:06.479> we<00:01:06.630> do<00:01:06.810> with<00:01:06.990> it<00:01:07.140> so<00:01:07.830> it's<00:01:07.860> important

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
what we do with it so it's important

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.880 
what we do with it so it's important
that<00:01:08.820> we<00:01:08.909> recognize<00:01:09.090> how<00:01:09.810> our<00:01:09.960> body<00:01:10.170> works<00:01:10.500> and

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
that we recognize how our body works and

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.149 
that we recognize how our body works and
to<00:01:11.760> live<00:01:12.420> according<00:01:12.720> to<00:01:12.900> our<00:01:13.020> means<00:01:13.380> so<00:01:14.040> we

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
to live according to our means so we

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.770 
to live according to our means so we
need<00:01:14.340> to<00:01:14.430> leave<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.610> kind<00:01:14.880> of<00:01:15.000> food<00:01:15.299> that<00:01:15.360> our

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
need to leave the kind of food that our

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.319 
need to leave the kind of food that our
individual<00:01:16.439> body<00:01:16.649> needs<00:01:16.979> we<00:01:17.909> need<00:01:18.060> to<00:01:18.180> either

00:01:18.319 --> 00:01:18.329 
individual body needs we need to either

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:21.230 
individual body needs we need to either
kinds<00:01:18.810> of<00:01:18.869> foods<00:01:19.110> that<00:01:19.320> we<00:01:19.740> we<00:01:20.610> need<00:01:20.850> to<00:01:21.030> live

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
kinds of foods that we we need to live

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.070 
kinds of foods that we we need to live
optimum<00:01:22.020> Lee

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.080 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.290 

essentially<00:01:27.040> i<00:01:27.070> used<00:01:27.340> the<00:01:27.520> wheel<00:01:27.790> of<00:01:27.820> health

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:28.300 
essentially i used the wheel of health

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.160 
essentially i used the wheel of health
as<00:01:29.160> symbolic<00:01:30.160> of<00:01:30.430> our<00:01:30.580> body<00:01:31.050> but<00:01:32.050> it's

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170 
as symbolic of our body but it's

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:33.930 
as symbolic of our body but it's
interfacing<00:01:32.560> with<00:01:32.830> the<00:01:32.950> road<00:01:33.370> which<00:01:33.640> is<00:01:33.790> our

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:33.940 
interfacing with the road which is our

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.330 
interfacing with the road which is our
environment<00:01:34.630> and<00:01:34.870> obviously<00:01:35.380> the<00:01:35.530> more<00:01:35.770> bumpy

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:36.340 
environment and obviously the more bumpy

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.700 
environment and obviously the more bumpy
the<00:01:36.520> road<00:01:36.730> is<00:01:36.970> the<00:01:37.720> more<00:01:37.930> likely<00:01:38.170> we're<00:01:38.590> going

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710 
the road is the more likely we're going

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:40.440 
the road is the more likely we're going
to<00:01:38.770> have<00:01:38.860> health<00:01:39.100> problems<00:01:39.160> so<00:01:40.120> essentially

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
to have health problems so essentially

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.110 
to have health problems so essentially
the<00:01:40.660> more<00:01:40.810> toxic<00:01:41.350> environment<00:01:42.130> is<00:01:42.700> the<00:01:42.910> more

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:43.120 
the more toxic environment is the more

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.810 
the more toxic environment is the more
hostile<00:01:43.960> our<00:01:44.320> environment<00:01:45.070> is<00:01:45.250> the<00:01:45.460> more

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820 
hostile our environment is the more

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.820 
hostile our environment is the more
problems<00:01:46.120> our<00:01:46.450> body<00:01:46.660> is<00:01:46.780> going<00:01:46.930> to<00:01:46.990> have<00:01:47.200> so

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:47.830 
problems our body is going to have so

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:49.140 
problems our body is going to have so
it's<00:01:47.980> important<00:01:48.550> we're<00:01:48.730> in<00:01:48.850> an<00:01:49.000> environment

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.150 
it's important we're in an environment

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.800 
it's important we're in an environment
as<00:01:49.810> much<00:01:50.110> as<00:01:50.260> we<00:01:50.380> can<00:01:50.620> that<00:01:51.280> as<00:01:51.910> toxin<00:01:52.480> free

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
as much as we can that as toxin free

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.410 
as much as we can that as toxin free
that's<00:01:53.200> conducive<00:01:54.040> to<00:01:54.370> really<00:01:54.910> good<00:01:55.060> levels

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:55.420 
that's conducive to really good levels

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.290 
that's conducive to really good levels
of<00:01:55.540> health<00:01:55.890> but<00:01:56.890> if<00:01:57.010> we<00:01:57.220> we<00:01:58.000> don't<00:01:58.150> have

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:58.300 
of health but if we we don't have

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.960 
of health but if we we don't have
complete<00:01:58.870> control<00:01:59.530> over<00:01:59.920> our<00:02:00.310> bottom<00:02:00.729> but

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
complete control over our bottom but

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:03.030 
complete control over our bottom but
what<00:02:01.090> we<00:02:01.210> do<00:02:01.420> have<00:02:01.450> is<00:02:02.050> control<00:02:02.500> over<00:02:02.530> the<00:02:02.770> kind

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.040 
what we do have is control over the kind

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.480 
what we do have is control over the kind
of<00:02:03.160> foods<00:02:03.430> that<00:02:03.700> we<00:02:03.820> eat<00:02:03.850> how<00:02:04.690> we<00:02:04.750> detoxify<00:02:05.740> our

of foods that we eat how we detoxify our

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.359 
of foods that we eat how we detoxify our
lifestyle<00:02:07.270> the<00:02:08.140> kind<00:02:08.410> of<00:02:08.500> exercise<00:02:08.950> we<00:02:09.220> do

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
lifestyle the kind of exercise we do

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:11.490 
lifestyle the kind of exercise we do
that<00:02:09.580> what<00:02:09.790> we<00:02:09.910> think<00:02:10.300> and<00:02:10.450> how<00:02:10.540> we<00:02:10.690> feel<00:02:11.020> so

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
that what we think and how we feel so

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.290 
that what we think and how we feel so
all<00:02:11.709> of<00:02:11.740> these<00:02:12.010> factors<00:02:12.250> can<00:02:12.520> make<00:02:12.910> us<00:02:13.060> more

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
all of these factors can make us more

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:17.610 
all of these factors can make us more
robust<00:02:13.750> to<00:02:14.110> our<00:02:14.200> environment<00:02:16.440> what<00:02:17.440> are<00:02:17.560> the

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
robust to our environment what are the

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.220 
robust to our environment what are the
major<00:02:17.860> principle<00:02:18.220> I<00:02:18.550> look<00:02:18.790> at<00:02:19.000> is<00:02:19.330> which<00:02:20.110> is

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
major principle I look at is which is

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.830 
major principle I look at is which is
the<00:02:20.350> first<00:02:20.590> we<00:02:20.950> love<00:02:21.010> which<00:02:21.970> is<00:02:22.120> a<00:02:22.150> first<00:02:22.450> spoke

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
the first we love which is a first spoke

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.620 
the first we love which is a first spoke
of<00:02:23.050> the<00:02:23.140> wheel<00:02:23.290> of<00:02:23.320> health<00:02:24.060> its<00:02:25.060> nourishment

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
of the wheel of health its nourishment

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.949 
of the wheel of health its nourishment
it's<00:02:26.080> what<00:02:26.560> we<00:02:26.770> eat<00:02:27.040> what<00:02:27.910> we<00:02:27.970> drink<00:02:28.450> the<00:02:28.840> air

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
it's what we eat what we drink the air

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:31.199 
it's what we eat what we drink the air
we<00:02:29.290> breathe<00:02:29.590> all<00:02:30.130> of<00:02:30.400> these<00:02:30.550> factors<00:02:30.580> have<00:02:31.180> a

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
we breathe all of these factors have a

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:34.979 
we breathe all of these factors have a
really<00:02:32.050> important<00:02:32.739> fundamental<00:02:33.730> impact<00:02:34.660> on

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
really important fundamental impact on

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:38.900 
really important fundamental impact on
the<00:02:35.470> way<00:02:35.680> our<00:02:36.070> being<00:02:36.670> is<00:02:37.000> how<00:02:37.660> healthy<00:02:38.200> we<00:02:38.230> are

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
the way our being is how healthy we are

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.880 
the way our being is how healthy we are
so<00:02:39.910> nourishment<00:02:40.600> is<00:02:40.660> important<00:02:41.200> but<00:02:41.620> so<00:02:41.860> is

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
so nourishment is important but so is

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:43.650 
so nourishment is important but so is
detoxification<00:02:42.519> we<00:02:43.060> can<00:02:43.209> take<00:02:43.360> all<00:02:43.480> the

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
detoxification we can take all the

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.530 
detoxification we can take all the
really<00:02:43.989> good<00:02:44.290> health<00:02:44.530> healthy<00:02:45.340> food<00:02:45.550> in<00:02:45.820> but

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
really good health healthy food in but

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.479 
really good health healthy food in but
if<00:02:46.630> we<00:02:46.720> don't<00:02:46.900> get<00:02:47.050> rid<00:02:47.230> of<00:02:47.290> the<00:02:47.500> waste<00:02:47.709> then

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489 
if we don't get rid of the waste then

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:51.479 
if we don't get rid of the waste then
our<00:02:48.610> body<00:02:48.880> will<00:02:49.150> become<00:02:49.269> toxic<00:02:50.170> and<00:02:50.860> full<00:02:51.430> of

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:51.489 
our body will become toxic and full of

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:53.160 
our body will become toxic and full of
these<00:02:51.700> environmental<00:02:52.360> poisons<00:02:53.019> and

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
these environmental poisons and

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.100 
these environmental poisons and
metabolic<00:02:53.709> wastes<00:02:54.220> so<00:02:54.970> in<00:02:55.330> the<00:02:55.750> book<00:02:55.900> I<00:02:56.080> talk

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.110 
metabolic wastes so in the book I talk

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.770 
metabolic wastes so in the book I talk
about<00:02:56.380> how<00:02:57.010> it's<00:02:57.250> it's<00:02:57.519> so<00:02:58.060> important<00:02:58.690> to

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
about how it's it's so important to

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.590 
about how it's it's so important to
detoxify<00:02:59.590> and<00:02:59.920> that<00:03:00.550> can<00:03:00.730> be<00:03:00.760> the<00:03:01.030> digestive

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 
detoxify and that can be the digestive

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.800 
detoxify and that can be the digestive
system<00:03:01.630> the<00:03:02.470> kidneys<00:03:03.370> the<00:03:03.760> liver<00:03:04.000> the<00:03:04.420> skin

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
system the kidneys the liver the skin

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.949 
system the kidneys the liver the skin
and<00:03:05.080> how<00:03:05.620> to<00:03:05.680> really<00:03:06.340> encourage<00:03:06.880> the<00:03:07.209> body<00:03:07.390> to

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
and how to really encourage the body to

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:12.390 
and how to really encourage the body to
get<00:03:08.140> rid<00:03:08.350> of<00:03:08.380> all<00:03:08.590> these<00:03:08.790> negative<00:03:09.790> toxins<00:03:11.400> of

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
get rid of all these negative toxins of

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.030 
get rid of all these negative toxins of
course<00:03:12.670> health<00:03:13.239> isn't<00:03:13.450> just<00:03:13.950> nutrition<00:03:14.950> is

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
course health isn't just nutrition is

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.430 
course health isn't just nutrition is
also<00:03:15.310> how<00:03:15.459> we<00:03:15.489> move<00:03:15.910> and<00:03:16.330> and<00:03:16.480> how<00:03:16.930> we<00:03:16.989> keep<00:03:17.260> our

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
also how we move and and how we keep our

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.560 
also how we move and and how we keep our
metabolic<00:03:17.769> rate<00:03:18.220> by<00:03:18.489> the<00:03:18.550> kind<00:03:19.000> of<00:03:19.090> exercise

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:19.570 
metabolic rate by the kind of exercise

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:23.039 
metabolic rate by the kind of exercise
that<00:03:19.870> we<00:03:20.019> do<00:03:21.090> what's<00:03:22.090> also<00:03:22.269> important<00:03:22.810> is<00:03:22.840> it

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:23.049 
that we do what's also important is it

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:25.289 
that we do what's also important is it
is<00:03:23.230> is<00:03:23.470> resting<00:03:24.070> is<00:03:24.220> making<00:03:24.580> sure<00:03:24.850> that<00:03:25.150> we

00:03:25.289 --> 00:03:25.299

to bed when we eat all of these factors

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.339 
to bed when we eat all of these factors
really<00:03:36.620> pivotal<00:03:37.340> to<00:03:37.879> how<00:03:38.360> our<00:03:38.540> well-being<00:03:39.019> is

essentially all of these aspects come
together<00:03:58.459> and<00:03:58.790> a<00:03:59.690> vital<00:04:00.500> for<00:04:01.310> how<00:04:01.640> we<00:04:01.700> operate

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:02.329 
together and a vital for how we operate

00:04:02.329 --> 00:04:05.080 
together and a vital for how we operate
in<00:04:02.480> the<00:04:02.599> world<00:04:02.810> is<00:04:03.230> how<00:04:03.769> healthy<00:04:04.280> we<00:04:04.310> are<00:04:04.579> and

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 
in the world is how healthy we are and

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:06.880 
in the world is how healthy we are and
once<00:04:05.359> all<00:04:05.540> these<00:04:05.720> factors<00:04:06.109> are<00:04:06.170> together<00:04:06.379> we

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:06.890 
once all these factors are together we

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:08.979 
once all these factors are together we
can<00:04:07.310> achieve<00:04:07.430> a<00:04:07.700> much<00:04:08.180> better<00:04:08.540> level<00:04:08.870> of

can achieve a much better level of

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:11.860 
can achieve a much better level of
health<00:04:09.200> we<00:04:09.920> can<00:04:10.129> be<00:04:10.310> vital<00:04:10.790> we<00:04:10.940> can<00:04:11.090> have<00:04:11.269> more

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
health we can be vital we can have more

in<00:04:31.890> an<00:04:32.010> effortless<00:04:32.550> way<00:04:32.760> but<00:04:33.510> sometimes

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 
in an effortless way but sometimes

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:35.870 
in an effortless way but sometimes
things<00:04:34.350> happen<00:04:34.620> we<00:04:35.010> become<00:04:35.310> out<00:04:35.430> of<00:04:35.460> balance

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:35.880 
things happen we become out of balance

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.270 
things happen we become out of balance
and<00:04:36.090> we<00:04:36.180> become<00:04:36.510> drawn<00:04:37.440> to<00:04:37.770> the<00:04:37.890> edge<00:04:37.980> of<00:04:38.160> the

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 
and we become drawn to the edge of the

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.250 
and we become drawn to the edge of the
wheel<00:04:38.430> in<00:04:38.610> a<00:04:38.670> sense<00:04:38.880> we<00:04:39.030> become<00:04:39.390> between<00:04:40.020> the

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:40.260 
wheel in a sense we become between the

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:44.060 
wheel in a sense we become between the
wheel<00:04:40.560> and<00:04:40.590> and<00:04:41.070> the<00:04:41.490> bumpy<00:04:41.910> road<00:04:42.150> so<00:04:42.920> what<00:04:43.920> we

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:44.070 
wheel and and the bumpy road so what we

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:45.650 
wheel and and the bumpy road so what we
need<00:04:44.220> to<00:04:44.370> do<00:04:44.520> is<00:04:44.670> to<00:04:44.820> get<00:04:44.970> to<00:04:45.090> the<00:04:45.210> center<00:04:45.240> of

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:45.660 
need to do is to get to the center of

need to do is to get to the center of
the<00:04:45.720> wheel<00:04:45.930> but<00:04:46.170> for<00:04:46.380> that<00:04:46.500> to<00:04:46.560> happen<00:04:46.950> we<00:04:47.550> need

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:47.670 
the wheel but for that to happen we need

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:49.490 
the wheel but for that to happen we need
all<00:04:47.790> of<00:04:48.000> these<00:04:48.090> five<00:04:48.450> aspects<00:04:48.990> to<00:04:49.200> be<00:04:49.320> in

exercise we need to do and then also

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:36.050 
exercise we need to do and then also
it's<00:05:33.620> what<00:05:34.620> we're<00:05:34.800> thinking<00:05:34.980> and<00:05:35.430> how<00:05:35.880> we're

it's what we're thinking and how we're

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:38.000 
it's what we're thinking and how we're
feeling<00:05:36.210> is<00:05:36.450> our<00:05:36.570> relationship<00:05:36.900> to<00:05:37.680> other

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:38.010

what all these aspects are there we can

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:44.570 
what all these aspects are there we can
