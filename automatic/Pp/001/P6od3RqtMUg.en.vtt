00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.240
 in this image that we are seeing here 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:10.519
 who also managed to capture the klaus driver 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:14.099
 who is the father of the 5 spellings is 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:16.170
 catch romy schneider there reach her 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.289
 to see is not true but an image 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.140
 as well 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:25.750
 and look, you make a comparative 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:28.770
 this person looks like an alien 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:31.350
 clear that here is a 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:34.380
 and now there is a mixture if you want to 

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:37.770
 a human image if with an image that 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.570
 one has internalized as a ghost 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.100
 What happens to felipe is that 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.380
 probably so clear to me I 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.050
 appear until this image I never the 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:51.809
 relationship would do with anyone but as he is 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:54.150
 your daughter to look for the clear similarity this 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.040
 it is one may be said when it is a 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:59.340
 family or someone direct one can 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:04.739
 say look for similarities say if you look or 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:06.240
 it looks like my sister to my dad very 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.190
 famous but knows that it is a denominator 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.810
 common to in this picture that is being 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.850
 watching through the television where 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.830
 you see this ghost the ghosts when 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.170
 There are many people who have told him 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.119
 about that they are as transparent and 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.610
 they really have how to deny it as a 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.920
 transparent white light that leaves as 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.290
 this clear wake at the moment of moving forward 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.780
 in one place it's like a bull like 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.260
 divinity is surely and the basins 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:38.730
 of the eyes you notice 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:38.730
 almost like holes I have the impression of 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:44.920
 the movie 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:48.060
 and he through the medium interpreted 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:50.290
 It is able to demonstrate that is 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.850
 everything had to be through what 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.890
 closed good and at the end of the movie 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.440
 she can see it in that ending and everything 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:59.470
 but effectively those characters 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:01.510
 what if I could say today 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.920
 this gentleman when you die remember 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:04.330
 it's always the case on TV for 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.370
 talk the last minutes with your 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:08.500
 families 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:14.080
 this gentleman summons through this 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:15.550
 tune the knowledge that you never never 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.410
 we had put in the assumption that in 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.820
 some time letting the TV turn on something 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.420
 you can appear 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:24.459
 I do not know who the house and turn on the TV 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.620
 who is staring to see what 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:28.209
 happens in this ant game one is 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.040
 He ended the pay TV is already then 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:33.520
 but to make it appear on your TV 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:35.280
 home who where he captured that image is not 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:38.020
 that this image does not happen 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.150
 this phenomenon occurs and leaves the 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.739
 channel to live is current chain the me 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.750
 we really wanted to analyze a bit 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:45.310
 for another chapter the frequency 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.069
 electromagnetic that causes the 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.840
 TV should be something not doing 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:52.750
 that the spirit can have the presence 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:55.030
 and materializes through images to 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.920
 Through these 525 lines have the 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.180
 television screen but this is 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.790
 really amazing because the 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.170
 accuracy of this scientist is just 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.319
 be at the right time and in addition 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:10.060
 have the materials to be able to record 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:13.800
 advanced technology as the 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.800
 definition could become more 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:27.890
 klaus true be awesome let's 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:32.640
 the next image who of a woman 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:36.680
 smiling is very clear this nothing to see 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.680
 with the other step is clearly 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:45.960
 If we can define well what is a 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.890
 gay woman is a woman who smiles 

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:50.850
 beyond 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:54.450
 to these strains a German who lived to 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:56.480
 74 years old but here clearly 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:59.640
 sees you in the fullness of your life 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:01.860
 is one of the few images that have been 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:04.560
 recorded with movement because here no longer 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:05.070
 it's just a frozen image is not 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.440
 true 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:11.510
 but also here there is a movement 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:15.110
 of this of this woman who appears 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:19.400
 smiling and that too 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:20.299
 as the work of this German shows 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.550
 klaus 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:25.150
 webber that is the so-called father of the 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:25.150
 geography
