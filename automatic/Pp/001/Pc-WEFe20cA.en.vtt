00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:05.899
 wanna brag became radost 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:09.590
 hover cultivator 

00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:13.320
 diameter of a disk is 55 centimeters 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:14.360
 believed even honestly thick 6 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.810
 millimeters 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:21.960
 it means there are a lot of pans on y-tube 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.130
 such a plan but differently attached then 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.350
 there we are completely different designs 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.880
 such a construction such a construction 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.279
 rather, I suggested 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.410
 my good friend and acquaintances and 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.059
 loom 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:36.600
 he already enjoys such a frying pan yet 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:40.410
 his parents made such a frying pan 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.540
 already more than ten there 20 years and very she 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.430
 he likes 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:48.500
 so what's the difference here from all 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:51.180
 the rest of the pans you made a fire 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.440
 when already there got burned if you're still burning 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.890
 straight to the center of the fire 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:01:00.149
 insert the pin like this now 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:02.579
 for example, and at this joint wears and 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.280
 griddle and skipped through this 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:10.010
 tube we here it goes on the right 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.010
 height clamping these bolts 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:17.159
 thanks to these bolts you can lift 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:19.380
 its higher or lower and the pan will be 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:22.020
 warm up as you need to not 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:26.729
 quite on fire it was possible to regulate 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.810
 temperature means what did next 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:32.060
 there was only one disk 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:35.009
 responsible flag 8 pull out the puck back 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:41.009
 on the outside 48 inside wears 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:42.170
 the diameter of this tube I took the tube 25 26 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:46.200
 millimeters 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:47.130
 we put this washer boil then we put 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.040
 washer 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.300
 scalded from this side just as well was 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:57.820
 war 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:02:00.160
 from the bottom now means if necessary 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:03.550
 lift that just unscrews 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:06.550
 here are these nuts and lifting or 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:08.920
 up or down to wear 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:12.300
 principle can be taken with the left right hand 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.560
 for these and wear it but I still did 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:20.410
 additional 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:22.210
 this is removable when frying is not 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:25.380
 heats up then gets tired and me when 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:30.520
 it is necessary to carry for example just walked 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:32.010
 put a pen here unscrewed with one hand 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:38.190
 took and panic 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:44.459
 mint what I did on the reverse side 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:44.459
 I prefigured their legs, I have three things, and 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:51.120
 Mom well, like calmly put on the table 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.120
 and 

00:02:53.319 --> 00:03:02.920
 calmly already pour the sheet thief like 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:04.810
 I will only experience this video as 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:10.499
 clean it well and of course like on it 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:10.499
