lot<00:01:53.390> of<00:01:53.450> glued<00:01:54.040> down<00:01:55.040> and<00:01:55.310> just<00:01:55.430> keep<00:01:55.640> on

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:55.759 
lot of glued down and just keep on

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:58.980 
lot of glued down and just keep on
putting<00:01:56.180> more<00:01:56.390> B's<00:01:56.950> down<00:01:57.950> and<00:01:58.220> gluing<00:01:58.580> them

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:58.990 
putting more B's down and gluing them

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.870 
putting more B's down and gluing them
and<00:01:59.990> here<00:02:00.680> I'm<00:02:00.770> just<00:02:00.950> pushing<00:02:01.130> the<00:02:01.399> beads<00:02:01.580> in<00:02:01.790> a

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
and here I'm just pushing the beads in a

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.030 
and here I'm just pushing the beads in a
little<00:02:02.149> bit<00:02:02.270> so<00:02:02.540> that<00:02:02.570> when<00:02:03.259> we<00:02:03.290> screw<00:02:03.680> the<00:02:03.830> lid

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040 
little bit so that when we screw the lid

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.430 
little bit so that when we screw the lid
on<00:02:04.100> it'll<00:02:04.820> actually<00:02:05.180> go<00:02:05.570> on<00:02:05.600> and<00:02:06.140> the<00:02:06.200> paint's

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:06.440 
on it'll actually go on and the paint's

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.320 
on it'll actually go on and the paint's
won't<00:02:06.619> be<00:02:06.710> blocking<00:02:06.950> it<00:02:07.280> and<00:02:07.520> then<00:02:07.790> here<00:02:08.209> I'm

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
won't be blocking it and then here I'm

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.060 
won't be blocking it and then here I'm
just<00:02:08.509> putting<00:02:08.720> a<00:02:09.050> little<00:02:09.170> bit<00:02:09.470> more<00:02:09.679> glue<00:02:09.890> on

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:10.070 
just putting a little bit more glue on

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:13.880 
just putting a little bit more glue on
just<00:02:10.310> to<00:02:10.429> make<00:02:10.580> sure<00:02:10.610> that<00:02:10.940> everything<00:02:11.360> stays

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.680
