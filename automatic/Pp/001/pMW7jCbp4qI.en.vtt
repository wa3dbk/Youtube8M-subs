00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
effective the worst thing he could do is

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.550 
effective the worst thing he could do is
ice<00:04:09.030> punch<00:04:09.330> and<00:04:09.510> freeze<00:04:09.840> though<00:04:10.110> that<00:04:10.470> would

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
ice punch and freeze though that would

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.720 
ice punch and freeze though that would
be<00:04:10.740> kind<00:04:11.370> of<00:04:11.400> detrimental<00:04:13.190> he's<00:04:14.190> just<00:04:14.640> gonna

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
be kind of detrimental he's just gonna

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:16.520 
be kind of detrimental he's just gonna
drain<00:04:15.060> punch<00:04:15.270> and<00:04:15.510> that<00:04:15.540> does<00:04:15.840> like<00:04:16.049> nothing

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
drain punch and that does like nothing

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:19.190 
drain punch and that does like nothing
so<00:04:17.130> I<00:04:17.489> really<00:04:18.090> don't<00:04:18.239> think<00:04:18.299> Conkeldurr<00:04:18.930> can

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.200 
so I really don't think Conkeldurr can

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.340 
so I really don't think Conkeldurr can
live<00:04:19.410> an<00:04:19.700> area<00:04:20.700> late<00:04:20.850> boosted<00:04:21.299> returned<00:04:21.660> so

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:26.900 
and I'm pretty sure Jolteon gets a code

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:32.339 
and I'm pretty sure Jolteon gets a code
if<00:06:27.050> not<00:06:27.229> to<00:06:27.440> a<00:06:27.469> ko'd<00:06:28.449> so<00:06:29.449> what<00:06:30.020> to<00:06:30.169> see<00:06:30.349> though

00:06:32.339 --> 00:06:32.349 
if not to a ko'd so what to see though

00:06:32.349 --> 00:06:36.249 
if not to a ko'd so what to see though
um<00:06:34.240> but<00:06:35.240> I'm<00:06:35.300> pretty<00:06:35.509> sure<00:06:35.690> this<00:06:35.779> one's<00:06:36.020> in<00:06:36.139> the

00:06:36.249 --> 00:06:36.259 
um but I'm pretty sure this one's in the

00:06:36.259 --> 00:06:37.180 
um but I'm pretty sure this one's in the
bag<00:06:36.289> already

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:37.190 
bag already

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:39.850

oh<00:06:37.389> that<00:06:38.389> gets<00:06:38.479> oak<00:06:38.750> code<00:06:38.990> look<00:06:39.259> at<00:06:39.349> that<00:06:39.500> power

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:39.860 
oh that gets oak code look at that power

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:42.659 
oh that gets oak code look at that power
Infernape<00:06:40.580> man<00:06:40.789> the<00:06:41.029> power<00:06:41.270> of<00:06:41.599> Infernape<00:06:42.199> I

00:06:42.659 --> 00:06:42.669
