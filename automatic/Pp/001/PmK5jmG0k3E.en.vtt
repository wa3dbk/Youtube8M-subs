built<00:01:32.939> basically<00:01:33.630> known<00:01:34.049> for<00:01:34.619> his<00:01:34.740> a<00:01:34.770> great

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
built basically known for his a great

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.429 
built basically known for his a great
standard<00:01:35.549> play<00:01:35.850> I<00:01:36.420> don't<00:01:36.840> think<00:01:36.900> tester<00:01:37.320> is

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
standard play I don't think tester is

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.679 
standard play I don't think tester is
known<00:01:37.619> for<00:01:37.860> much<00:01:38.009> of<00:01:38.040> anything<00:01:38.220> yet<00:01:38.790> yeah<00:01:39.659> I

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
known for much of anything yet yeah I

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.390 
known for much of anything yet yeah I
think<00:01:39.750> he's<00:01:39.960> still<00:01:40.170> yet<00:01:40.470> to<00:01:40.500> prove<00:01:40.799> himself<00:01:40.890> in

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
think he's still yet to prove himself in

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.920 
think he's still yet to prove himself in
the<00:01:41.490> pro<00:01:41.670> scene<00:01:41.939> although<00:01:42.150> it<00:01:42.420> has<00:01:42.570> quite<00:01:42.900> a

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
the pro scene although it has quite a

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.969 
the pro scene although it has quite a
few<00:01:42.990> matches<00:01:43.259> under<00:01:43.590> his<00:01:43.740> but<00:01:45.740> he<00:01:46.740> doesn't

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
few matches under his but he doesn't

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.770 
few matches under his but he doesn't
have<00:01:47.009> great<00:01:47.189> percentages<00:01:47.880> I<00:01:48.060> don't<00:01:48.360> have<00:01:48.570> the

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
have great percentages I don't have the

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.240 
have great percentages I don't have the
stats<00:01:49.110> with<00:01:49.290> me<00:01:49.439> right<00:01:49.590> now<00:01:49.710> but<00:01:49.829> I<00:01:49.920> think<00:01:49.950> his

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
stats with me right now but I think his

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.069 
stats with me right now but I think his
best<00:01:50.430> percentage<00:01:50.820> was<00:01:51.150> against<00:01:51.600> terran<00:01:51.930> is

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
best percentage was against terran is

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.710 
best percentage was against terran is
something<00:01:52.380> like<00:01:52.530> fifty<00:01:53.100> four<00:01:53.340> percent<00:01:53.369> and<00:01:54.270> as

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
something like fifty four percent and as

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.240 
something like fifty four percent and as
others<00:01:54.990> were<00:01:55.140> thirty<00:01:55.439> and<00:01:55.590> forty<00:01:55.740> percent<00:01:56.130> i

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
others were thirty and forty percent i

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.539 
others were thirty and forty percent i
believe<00:01:57.439> comes<00:01:58.439> a<00:01:58.530> refinery<00:01:59.009> in<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.220> barracks

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
believe comes a refinery in the barracks

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.270

looks<00:02:00.119> like<00:02:00.270> Midas<00:02:00.540> is<00:02:00.990> staying<00:02:01.799> inside<00:02:02.159> of

looks like Midas is staying inside of

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.169 
looks like Midas is staying inside of
his<00:02:02.369> base<00:02:02.549> once<00:02:02.820> again

00:02:06.169 --> 00:02:06.179 

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:08.669 

Midas<00:02:07.179> makes<00:02:07.420> himself<00:02:07.569> very<00:02:07.899> susceptible<00:02:08.319> to

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:08.679 
Midas makes himself very susceptible to

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:10.559 
Midas makes himself very susceptible to
cheese<00:02:08.920> when<00:02:09.670> it<00:02:09.759> comes<00:02:09.940> to<00:02:10.090> this<00:02:10.239> kind<00:02:10.450> of

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:10.569 
cheese when it comes to this kind of

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:12.509 
cheese when it comes to this kind of
late<00:02:10.780> scouting<00:02:11.290> stuff<00:02:11.560> I've<00:02:11.890> seen<00:02:12.190> him<00:02:12.310> get

00:02:12.509 --> 00:02:12.519 
late scouting stuff I've seen him get

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:16.140 
late scouting stuff I've seen him get
rushed<00:02:13.000> before<00:02:14.190> being<00:02:15.190> stuck<00:02:15.549> inside<00:02:15.760> of<00:02:16.060> his

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
rushed before being stuck inside of his

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.880 
rushed before being stuck inside of his
base<00:02:18.269> but<00:02:19.269> looks<00:02:19.780> like<00:02:19.989> it<00:02:20.200> is<00:02:20.319> not<00:02:20.500> happening

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
base but looks like it is not happening

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.869 
base but looks like it is not happening
now<00:02:21.239> and<00:02:22.239> testers<00:02:23.230> already<00:02:23.980> Mining<00:02:24.340> gas<00:02:24.489> so

00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:24.879 
now and testers already Mining gas so

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:26.339 
now and testers already Mining gas so
we'll<00:02:25.030> see<00:02:25.180> if<00:02:25.209> he<00:02:25.360> gets<00:02:25.390> any<00:02:25.780> zealots<00:02:26.140> out

00:02:26.339 --> 00:02:26.349 
we'll see if he gets any zealots out

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:29.600 
we'll see if he gets any zealots out
this<00:02:26.709> time<00:02:26.980> he<00:02:27.220> didn't<00:02:27.459> get<00:02:27.580> easy<00:02:27.910> lets<00:02:28.120> out<00:02:28.330> in

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
this time he didn't get easy lets out in

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.360 
this time he didn't get easy lets out in
the<00:02:30.610> first<00:02:30.849> game<00:02:31.090> that<00:02:31.150> kind<00:02:31.540> of<00:02:31.629> cost<00:02:31.870> him<00:02:32.140> I

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
the first game that kind of cost him I

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.039 
the first game that kind of cost him I
think<00:02:33.370> he<00:02:33.580> wasn't<00:02:33.849> able<00:02:33.970> to<00:02:34.120> fend<00:02:34.299> off<00:02:34.450> against

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:35.049 
think he wasn't able to fend off against

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:39.479 
think he wasn't able to fend off against
the<00:02:37.560> wasn't<00:02:38.560> able<00:02:38.650> to<00:02:38.799> fend<00:02:38.950> off<00:02:39.069> against<00:02:39.430> the

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
the wasn't able to fend off against the

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:41.850 
the wasn't able to fend off against the
mines<00:02:39.760> at<00:02:39.940> all<00:02:40.140> Hey<00:02:41.140> look<00:02:41.170> like<00:02:41.410> tester<00:02:41.769> is

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
mines at all Hey look like tester is

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.009 
mines at all Hey look like tester is
actually<00:02:42.160> blocking<00:02:42.430> his<00:02:42.730> choked<00:02:43.030> with<00:02:43.629> two

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:44.019 
actually blocking his choked with two

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:46.920 
actually blocking his choked with two
probes<00:02:44.829> right<00:02:45.069> now<00:02:45.220> so<00:02:45.489> he's<00:02:45.670> going<00:02:46.599> to<00:02:46.690> try<00:02:46.870> to

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
probes right now so he's going to try to

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.449 
probes right now so he's going to try to
keep<00:02:47.110> that<00:02:47.260> scouting<00:02:47.590> information<00:02:48.160> away<00:02:48.340> as

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
keep that scouting information away as

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:50.460 
keep that scouting information away as
long<00:02:48.819> as<00:02:48.940> he<00:02:49.030> can<00:02:49.239> but<00:02:49.420> that<00:02:49.629> means<00:02:49.959> he's<00:02:50.170> not

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
long as he can but that means he's not

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.589 
long as he can but that means he's not
going<00:02:50.650> to<00:02:50.739> scout<00:02:50.920> himself<00:02:51.310> so<00:02:52.090> it's<00:02:52.390> hard<00:02:52.569> to

00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:52.599 
going to scout himself so it's hard to

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:53.850 
going to scout himself so it's hard to
tell<00:02:52.780> what<00:02:52.959> he's<00:02:53.049> going<00:02:53.230> to<00:02:53.290> be<00:02:53.379> up<00:02:53.500> to<00:02:53.530> here

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
tell what he's going to be up to here

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:54.960 
tell what he's going to be up to here
you<00:02:53.950> might<00:02:54.099> be<00:02:54.220> thinking<00:02:54.310> about<00:02:54.519> going<00:02:54.730> for

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
you might be thinking about going for

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.690 
you might be thinking about going for
something<00:02:55.180> interesting<00:02:55.720> actually<00:02:56.700> factor

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
something interesting actually factor

going<00:02:58.030> up<00:02:58.180> for<00:02:58.930> midas<00:03:01.530> looks<00:03:02.530> like<00:03:02.739> he<00:03:02.950> is

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
going up for midas looks like he is

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.490 
going up for midas looks like he is
replacing<00:03:03.370> one<00:03:03.790> the<00:03:03.940> probes<00:03:04.209> with<00:03:04.720> a<00:03:04.959> zealot

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
replacing one the probes with a zealot

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.470 
replacing one the probes with a zealot
just<00:03:05.859> making<00:03:06.340> sure<00:03:06.609> that<00:03:06.640> midas<00:03:07.030> doesn't

00:04:05.889 --> 00:04:07.379 
same strategy every single time so maybe
it<00:04:06.069> is<00:04:06.160> the<00:04:06.190> twilight<00:04:06.730> themed<00:04:06.970> they're<00:04:07.209> like

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:07.389 
it is the twilight themed they're like

00:04:07.389 --> 00:04:09.539 
it is the twilight themed they're like
it's<00:04:07.930> another<00:04:08.109> twilight<00:04:08.560> map<00:04:08.739> so<00:04:09.280> I<00:04:09.310> better

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:09.549 
it's another twilight map so I better

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:12.509 
it's another twilight map so I better
use<00:04:09.639> my<00:04:09.879> Dark<00:04:10.120> Templar<00:04:10.919> it'll<00:04:11.919> be<00:04:12.040> hard<00:04:12.220> to<00:04:12.280> see

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:12.519 
use my Dark Templar it'll be hard to see

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:15.210 
use my Dark Templar it'll be hard to see
them<00:04:12.700> on<00:04:12.879> this<00:04:13.030> dark<00:04:13.299> background

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
them on this dark background

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.349 
them on this dark background
that<00:04:16.220> looks<00:04:16.370> like<00:04:16.489> my<00:04:16.609> T's<00:04:16.789> is<00:04:16.940> finally<00:04:17.269> going

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:17.359 
that looks like my T's is finally going

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:19.180 
that looks like my T's is finally going
to<00:04:17.419> scout<00:04:17.690> I<00:04:17.930> think<00:04:18.259> there's<00:04:18.979> something

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:19.190 
to scout I think there's something

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:21.039 
to scout I think there's something
swinging<00:04:19.669> around<00:04:19.820> the<00:04:19.910> map<00:04:20.120> they're<00:04:20.329> not<00:04:20.810> sure

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 
swinging around the map they're not sure

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:22.510 
swinging around the map they're not sure
what<00:04:21.079> exactly<00:04:21.560> that<00:04:21.769> is<00:04:21.919> it<00:04:22.160> might<00:04:22.280> be<00:04:22.400> the

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:22.520 
what exactly that is it might be the

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.390 
what exactly that is it might be the
scout<00:04:22.759> from<00:04:23.000> testdir<00:04:23.870> actually<00:04:24.320> I<00:04:24.590> think

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400 
scout from testdir actually I think

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.100 
scout from testdir actually I think
Midas<00:04:25.910> is<00:04:26.030> moving<00:04:26.330> down<00:04:26.570> right<00:04:26.870> now<00:04:27.050> two

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
Midas is moving down right now two

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:31.600 
Midas is moving down right now two
testers<00:04:27.710> base<00:04:29.380> it's<00:04:30.380> like<00:04:30.530> two<00:04:30.889> barracks<00:04:31.370> out

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:31.610 
testers base it's like two barracks out

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:34.749 
testers base it's like two barracks out
here<00:04:31.820> for<00:04:32.120> midas<00:04:32.440> was<00:04:33.440> interesting<00:04:34.430> it<00:04:34.580> looks

00:04:34.749 --> 00:04:34.759 
here for midas was interesting it looks

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:37.300 
here for midas was interesting it looks
like<00:04:34.850> he's<00:04:34.970> going<00:04:35.090> to<00:04:35.210> get<00:04:35.330> some<00:04:35.919> maybe<00:04:36.919> medic

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
like he's going to get some maybe medic

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.779 
like he's going to get some maybe medic
marines<00:04:37.759> out<00:04:37.970> he<00:04:38.150> did<00:04:38.330> was<00:04:38.600> getting<00:04:38.930> his

marines out he did was getting his
Academy<00:04:40.789> out<00:04:40.940> so<00:04:41.150> we<00:04:41.240> could<00:04:41.360> be<00:04:41.509> seen<00:04:41.690> a

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:41.720 
Academy out so we could be seen a

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.439 
Academy out so we could be seen a
modified<00:04:42.229> medic<00:04:42.620> marine<00:04:42.889> and<00:04:43.160> a<00:04:43.190> tank<00:04:44.150> push

00:04:44.439 --> 00:04:44.449 
modified medic marine and a tank push

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:46.270 
modified medic marine and a tank push
here<00:04:44.780> or<00:04:44.900> something<00:04:45.320> that's<00:04:45.830> very<00:04:46.009> strange

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:46.280 
here or something that's very strange

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:49.629 
here or something that's very strange
very<00:04:47.440> strange<00:04:48.440> to<00:04:48.680> go<00:04:48.830> medic<00:04:49.070> marine<00:04:49.310> against

00:04:49.629 --> 00:04:49.639 
very strange to go medic marine against

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:51.610 
very strange to go medic marine against
protoss<00:04:49.970> it<00:04:50.690> usually<00:04:50.960> doesn't<00:04:51.199> work<00:04:51.229> out<00:04:51.470> too

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:51.620 
protoss it usually doesn't work out too

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.350 
protoss it usually doesn't work out too
well<00:04:51.650> if<00:04:51.919> the<00:04:52.039> Protoss<00:04:52.400> goes<00:04:52.669> for<00:04:52.910> a<00:04:52.940> lot<00:04:53.060> of

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:53.360 
well if the Protoss goes for a lot of

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.779 
well if the Protoss goes for a lot of
jergens<00:04:53.900> that<00:04:54.620> is<00:04:54.740> basically<00:04:55.190> the<00:04:55.340> counter<00:04:55.639> to

00:04:55.779 --> 00:04:55.789 
jergens that is basically the counter to

00:04:55.789 --> 00:04:59.200 
jergens that is basically the counter to
a<00:04:55.820> medic<00:04:56.090> marine<00:04:56.360> i<00:04:57.199> guess<00:04:58.160> sk<00:04:58.610> Terran<00:04:58.970> build

00:04:59.200 --> 00:04:59.210 
a medic marine i guess sk Terran build

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:04.540 
a medic marine i guess sk Terran build
against<00:04:59.840> a<00:05:00.050> Protoss<00:05:02.770> there's<00:05:03.770> a<00:05:03.889> medic<00:05:04.190> out<00:05:04.340> so

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:04.550 
against a Protoss there's a medic out so

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:05.860 
against a Protoss there's a medic out so
this<00:05:04.669> is<00:05:04.849> definitely<00:05:05.060> a<00:05:05.270> medical<00:05:05.660> marine

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:05.870 
this is definitely a medical marine

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:08.830 
this is definitely a medical marine

Maureen built in the past against

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:12.249 
Maureen built in the past against
protoss<00:05:10.699> and<00:05:11.000> that<00:05:11.090> was<00:05:11.240> one<00:05:11.690> of<00:05:11.780> his<00:05:11.840> calling

00:05:12.249 --> 00:05:12.259 
protoss and that was one of his calling

protoss and that was one of his calling
cards<00:05:12.560> back<00:05:12.770> then<00:05:13.009> going<00:05:13.940> for<00:05:14.150> a<00:05:14.180> weird<00:05:14.570> build

cards back then going for a weird build
like<00:05:14.990> that<00:05:15.229> but<00:05:16.160> Dark<00:05:16.400> Templar<00:05:16.520> is<00:05:16.820> already

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:17.030 
like that but Dark Templar is already

like that but Dark Templar is already
out<00:05:17.150> here<00:05:17.180> I<00:05:17.389> don't<00:05:17.630> think<00:05:17.720> Midas<00:05:18.710> has<00:05:18.860> scan

00:05:19.149 --> 00:05:19.159 
out here I don't think Midas has scan

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:21.219 
out here I don't think Midas has scan
and<00:05:19.490> he<00:05:19.820> probably<00:05:20.000> has<00:05:20.210> one<00:05:20.240> scan<00:05:20.840> they're

00:05:21.219 --> 00:05:21.229 
and he probably has one scan they're

00:05:21.229 --> 00:05:25.750 
and he probably has one scan they're
ready<00:05:21.560> to<00:05:21.710> go<00:05:22.930> but<00:05:23.930> if<00:05:24.310> tester<00:05:25.310> can<00:05:25.460> make<00:05:25.580> might

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:25.760 
ready to go but if tester can make might

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:27.310 
ready to go but if tester can make might
his<00:05:25.880> waist<00:05:26.150> that<00:05:26.300> scan<00:05:26.570> oh<00:05:26.599> man<00:05:26.960> he's<00:05:27.110> building

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:27.320 
his waist that scan oh man he's building

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:28.930 
his waist that scan oh man he's building
another<00:05:27.380> barracks<00:05:27.919> here<00:05:28.099> this<00:05:28.669> is<00:05:28.789> ridiculous

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:28.940 
another barracks here this is ridiculous

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:31.180 
another barracks here this is ridiculous
and<00:05:29.570> might<00:05:29.990> have<00:05:30.110> sees<00:05:30.349> this<00:05:30.380> he<00:05:30.830> definitely

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:31.190 
and might have sees this he definitely

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:34.330 
and might have sees this he definitely
sees<00:05:32.229> the<00:05:33.229> blur<00:05:33.650> on<00:05:33.680> the<00:05:33.919> map<00:05:34.099> and<00:05:34.250> he

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:34.340 
sees the blur on the map and he

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:37.689 
sees the blur on the map and he
retreated<00:05:34.760> before<00:05:35.030> then<00:05:36.340> he's<00:05:37.340> gonna<00:05:37.490> have<00:05:37.669> a

00:05:37.689 --> 00:05:37.699 
retreated before then he's gonna have a

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:39.149 
retreated before then he's gonna have a
lot<00:05:37.849> of<00:05:37.880> trouble<00:05:38.150> finding<00:05:38.330> us<00:05:38.479> off<00:05:38.690> I<00:05:38.840> think

00:05:39.149 --> 00:05:39.159 
lot of trouble finding us off I think

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:41.080 
lot of trouble finding us off I think
because<00:05:40.159> he<00:05:40.190> doesn't<00:05:40.310> have<00:05:40.550> any<00:05:40.669> Minds<00:05:40.970> here

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:41.090 
because he doesn't have any Minds here

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:43.300 
because he doesn't have any Minds here
or<00:05:41.150> anything<00:05:41.360> i'm<00:05:41.599> not<00:05:41.720> sure<00:05:41.930> why<00:05:42.169> oh<00:05:42.470> I<00:05:42.979> think

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:43.310 
or anything i'm not sure why oh I think

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:45.460 
or anything i'm not sure why oh I think

might be waiting for some more Dark
Templar<00:05:46.849> before<00:05:47.330> he<00:05:47.389> decides<00:05:47.690> to<00:05:47.780> go<00:05:47.930> in<00:05:48.080> and
