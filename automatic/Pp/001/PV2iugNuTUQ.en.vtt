00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.380 
right now in fact the wife Irene thought
this<00:03:05.840> is<00:03:06.110> I<00:03:06.410> think<00:03:06.530> we're<00:03:07.250> off<00:03:07.400> of<00:03:07.610> 3G<00:03:07.849> network

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
this is I think we're off of 3G network

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:23.309 
this is I think we're off of 3G network
a<00:03:08.660> reason<00:03:09.020> being<00:03:09.200> we're<00:03:09.830> using<00:03:10.010> 80s<00:03:19.720> in<00:03:20.720> April

00:03:23.309 --> 00:03:23.319 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:36.930 

April<00:03:28.690> 1st<00:03:29.690> quarter<00:03:30.050> probably<00:03:31.040> camera

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:48.300 

it'll<00:03:37.930> be<00:03:45.360> is<00:03:46.360> the<00:03:46.570> batteries<00:03:46.930> walkable<00:03:47.470> no<00:03:48.280> I

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:48.310 
it'll be is the batteries walkable no I

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:50.940 
it'll be is the batteries walkable no I
do<00:03:49.000> believe<00:03:49.180> it's<00:03:49.420> built<00:03:49.630> in<00:03:49.870> it's<00:03:50.560> right<00:03:50.740> here

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
do believe it's built in it's right here

00:03:50.950 --> 00:04:00.840 
do believe it's built in it's right here
I<00:03:50.980> have<00:03:51.580> been<00:03:51.760> told<00:03:51.940> a<00:03:52.030> lot<00:03:52.270> so<00:03:59.850> dedicated

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:00.850 
I have been told a lot so dedicated

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:03.300 
I have been told a lot so dedicated
solid-state<00:04:01.750> is<00:04:01.930> too<00:04:02.140> big<00:04:02.380> with<00:04:02.620> 32<00:04:03.160> gate

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:03.310 
solid-state is too big with 32 gate

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:06.420 
solid-state is too big with 32 gate
capacity<00:04:03.820> story
