00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:21.529
 Hi guys on the river today I show 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:27.050
 how can you renew the old moves 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:29.900
 who is forgotten at home volleyball 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:33.939
 tip of how to make it super modern 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.939
 using Tiga and decide 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:47.390
 so if you want to see how I turned 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:50.210
 That's right, you know nothing. 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:53.300
 to reform my mobile I used two 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:55.489
 inks a white to serve as a voucher 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:59.890
 and one of the desired color 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:03.410
 in my case red glue white paintbrushes 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:05.810
 Make yourself civil with the desired stamp 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:07.689
 we'll start taking them and the 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:12.790
 mobile this step is fundamental 

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:12.790
 especially if it is inferred 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:20.630
 now the company a video I went through 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:24.759
 The whole property for us wants to 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.759
 dust so you can receive ink 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:32.329
 To make the background I told 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:35.030
 ink I hated I do not know if it is 

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:37.579
 because of the brand its type because it 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.689
 also suitable for metals beyond April 

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:40.700
 for wood 

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:43.459
 I thought I would have compensated but if I 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.560
 I bought that paint. 

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:47.420
 and understands the largest size 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.459
 So here's the tip if you're going to make a 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.869
 background to apply your way the zÃ© 

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:52.869
 boiling the same 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:58.159
 I ran the white paint all over the 

00:01:56.239 --> 00:01:59.929
 property case is continuous 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:02.479
 in this step you do not need to 

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:04.610
 worry about leaving the beginning because 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:08.090
 serve as the very basis of the 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:11.120
 next paint after having painted is just 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:14.450
 to dry well in my case I stopped 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.680
 overnight the mobile was fine, yes it was 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.319
 It is very important that he is 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.329
 really if so you put your finger 

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:21.350
 so to see if you're not there will not 

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:23.510
 changing 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:27.459
 there you can paint in the desired color on the 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.459
 In my case I chose the red ink 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:46.630
 the drawer does not need to paint the part of the 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:49.180
 fitch in my case I left only white paint 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:51.670
 because then we will meet 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:54.460
 with fabric I gave two coats of paint 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:56.620
 in new cei the first let dry well 

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:59.920
 so good from day to day that 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:02.200
 then walks hand which binds the 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.090
 helmand metric while they have 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.280
 front of the drawer 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.980
 now we will pass these measures 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:11.650
 to achieve this will greatly facilitate 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:15.690
 because we're going to strengthen the size 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.690
 the front of the drawer 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:23.530
 now it's with the wheel people matter 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:24.730
 that it is a snake that strong and not 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.430
 miss scolari 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:29.440
 the next step is to glue all over the 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.890
 surface where the 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.890
 fabric 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:43.690
 to make the fabric more 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:46.540
 tough and does not say son 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:49.210
 We're going to make a mix with glue. 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:51.900
 and a little water and go over 

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:51.900
 this super 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:04.690
 Now just leave drawers and housing and to 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.690
 to finalize I decided to change the handle 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:14.260
 it's ready, not even I can not 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.260
 in love does not work 

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:25.940
 and then I liked it, I loved it. 

00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:27.470
 see do not think that one thing that you 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:29.780

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:32.120
