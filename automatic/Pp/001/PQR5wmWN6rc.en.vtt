00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
but I didn't like the forest in the

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.920 
but I didn't like the forest in the
background<00:01:13.590> so<00:01:13.860> I<00:01:14.510> walked<00:01:15.510> little<00:01:15.840> bit

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
background so I walked little bit

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.580 
background so I walked little bit
further<00:01:16.229> to<00:01:16.610> swamp<00:01:17.870> kind<00:01:18.870> of<00:01:18.960> a<00:01:19.050> swamp<00:01:19.320> and

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
find this old forest and I thought to

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.700

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.469 
this one and after that I go home and
start<00:01:29.310> working<00:01:29.580> with<00:01:29.729> my<00:01:29.970> background<00:01:30.360> I

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
start working with my background I

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.030 
start working with my background I
always<00:01:30.900> started<00:01:31.200> working<00:01:31.619> with<00:01:31.950> the

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
always started working with the

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.580 
always started working with the
background<00:01:32.430> because<00:01:33.150> I<00:01:33.330> want<00:01:33.509> to<00:01:33.600> know<00:01:33.960> what

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
background because I want to know what

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.219 
background because I want to know what
the<00:01:34.680> lights<00:01:34.890> was<00:01:35.100> on<00:01:35.479> before<00:01:36.479> I<00:01:36.720> go<00:01:36.900> to<00:01:36.960> the

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
the lights was on before I go to the

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:43.219 
the lights was on before I go to the
studio<00:01:41.000> when<00:01:42.000> I<00:01:42.030> got<00:01:42.210> this<00:01:42.360> mock-up<00:01:43.020> of

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
studio when I got this mock-up of

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.490 
studio when I got this mock-up of
lineage<00:01:43.850> so<00:01:44.850> I<00:01:44.910> can<00:01:45.090> see<00:01:45.300> where<00:01:45.539> I<00:01:45.810> wanted<00:01:46.410> the

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
lineage so I can see where I wanted the

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.240 
lineage so I can see where I wanted the
light<00:01:46.680> sources

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
light sources

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.330

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.630 
the model and we went to the studio and
where<00:01:53.970> I<00:01:54.000> set<00:01:54.210> up<00:01:54.300> the<00:01:54.840> light<00:01:54.990> sources<00:01:55.640> that

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
where I set up the light sources that

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.460 
where I set up the light sources that
look<00:01:57.000> similar<00:01:57.240> to<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:58.259> background<00:01:58.440> and<00:02:00.470> we

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:01.470 
look similar to the background and we

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:03.670 
look similar to the background and we
took<00:02:01.590> some<00:02:01.770> pictures<00:02:01.800> of<00:02:02.550> that<00:02:02.610> I<00:02:03.149> went<00:02:03.330> home

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:03.680 
took some pictures of that I went home

00:02:03.680 --> 00:03:02.040 
took some pictures of that I went home
