00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:08.049
 hello everyone I'm quality 

00:00:08.049 --> 00:00:11.299
 I extracted it a special thing 

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:14.969
 I always say the same thing but it is that if I like things that are not centers 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:15.649
 days 

00:00:15.649 --> 00:00:19.550
 today I went I do not know if you know I have not followed the twitter yesterday I had many 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:20.800
 many problems 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.980
 the referee is dying, he is very little very little 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.130
 I already got a scare a few months ago and now I go back to the law says that 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.669
 within little or nothing 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:32.560
 but to say so far I have arrived 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.930
 and good to go to the store d good not the store but the shopping area of 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:36.960
 Barcelona 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:37.979
 d 

00:00:37.979 --> 00:00:41.339
 in sepulveda street, which is where you usually have these hard penalties 

00:00:41.339 --> 00:00:42.910
 magical 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:46.240
 to report a little bit hard I was really going to buy a computer 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:50.340
 new by pieces I do not know informed in the end I did not buy the shit 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.960
 but that form a little more because it is a purchase would be and I in these 11 yo 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.910
 I do not want to buy things pointed 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.040
 but good if you have followed my channel 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.610
 you have seen what he says to a friend of mine 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:05.800
 Alcazar 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:07.860
 you have to talk on the other hand add 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.260
 the test of the falconcitos point 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.260
 I promised in that video I wanted a tutorial 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:19.270
 how the bows will be 5 points 1 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.020
 Well, just when we were going to do that tutorial 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.930
 the sarcomas broke 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.320
 by the way we have to the store and we returned them 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.160
 they told us they were going to change it and surprise me they changed it for 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:32.610
 some newt 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.580
 the newts 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.580
 Haitian 7 20 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.530
 he found out that changing the tory to 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.930
 here the box just brought from the store 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.930
 the housing of helmets for those who are pons 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.420
 and good body to install them and then the tutorial 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.990
 so suppose I put in a transition 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.680
 and then start with the tutor and agreement agreement I'm going to bundle denied the cables 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.680
 until now 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:06.010
 I'm already here 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:09.289
 we have everything disassembled here we see the helmets 

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:12.099
 helmets have 

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:14.359
 you have to put the micro 

00:02:14.359 --> 00:02:16.929
 of agreement and micros with the pin that valley 

00:02:16.929 --> 00:02:18.639
 in this position 

00:02:18.639 --> 00:02:22.629
 only one position is turned over and inserted perfectly for 

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:25.549
 remove it you have to throw it 

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:29.040
 it's like a safety pin so it does not leak out of you and you take off and put on 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.040
 ponce counting the posture of 

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:34.329
 agreement 

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:37.329
 or we have control of volumes 

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:42.319
 the disconnected cycle of the general volume for the pc or for the 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:45.989
 for possible extension and volume of the micro 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:49.989
 ok here we see that there is a very simple diagram 

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:53.589
 defocused pear 

00:02:53.589 --> 00:02:56.749
 to connect it to the x box to the common people 

00:02:56.749 --> 00:02:58.439
 or at tc 

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:00.359
 it's worth in this case 

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:01.979
 st the play 

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:05.499
 the truth is that the charcones when I looked at it were very very complicated 

00:03:05.499 --> 00:03:07.379
 connect here is very easy 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:09.260
 We're afraid helmets 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.649
 of the helmets is the volume control of the lumen mattress 

00:03:12.649 --> 00:03:15.319
 to the device to the decoder 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:18.359
 and twice cause then stop the current 

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:21.239
 percent and the optical cable fide 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:22.749
 and the cable vs 

00:03:22.749 --> 00:03:25.760
 and from the play to the TV with hdmi that 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.869
 almost everyone has it 

00:03:27.869 --> 00:03:30.309
 now let's see it we've seen it on paper 

00:03:30.309 --> 00:03:31.739
 let's see it here 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:34.619
 valuable helmet volume control 

00:03:34.619 --> 00:03:37.859
 we follow the cable the cable is quite long so you see 

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:42.069
 and the cable reaches the decoder we have two inputs so we have two 

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:44.229
 helmets we could by with two 

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:46.499
 and we have behind 

00:03:46.499 --> 00:03:49.829
 the transformer and here is to plug it into the current 

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:54.579
 the optical cable 

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:56.919
 according to the optical cable 

00:03:56.919 --> 00:04:00.249
 is this cable 

00:04:00.249 --> 00:04:01.960
 that which is connected 

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.239
 Atleti in the back 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:07.299
 that is a peg that norman that is covered by his life 

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:10.259
 because it opens out rayitos usually goes 

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:14.079
 protected from it with this cap is very small I do not know if I will see it says 

00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:18.150
 ok because it's a pretty pretty delicate cable 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.529
 They are very thin fiber optic cable 

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:23.610
 and with this cable or I recommend that you go carefully 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.749
 ok and finally we have this cable 

00:04:26.749 --> 00:04:28.909
 which is a fifth square collection 

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:30.370
 and for the extreme 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.719
 we have the typical severe zero point of all life 

00:04:33.719 --> 00:04:36.709
 that as you all know the plague is has that connection for the part 

00:04:36.709 --> 00:04:37.969
 lead 

00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:40.969
 here we have more cables but these cables are for the pp 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:47.510
 i good is very simple to connect to connect with figure in the play 

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:49.479
 and play 

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:51.630
 percent now what I'll do 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:53.889
 I'm recording with my mobile 

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:57.069
 is to turn off make another transition 

00:04:57.069 --> 00:05:00.309
 I will try to capture concertation that is repeated for playstation 3 

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:03.029
 but first I'm going to teach a little 

00:05:03.029 --> 00:05:05.219
 but here in ibiza 

00:05:05.219 --> 00:05:06.879
 said 

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:08.199
 maybe 

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:11.199
 who loves to always bring something home with a bag 

00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:15.620
 has the fucking hobby of getting into the cuts pieces 

00:05:20.099 --> 00:05:23.099
 day 

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:26.650
 mimi 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:29.689
 ap as it reads in the eyes e with light 

00:05:29.689 --> 00:05:32.689
 min 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:36.900
 you are in your work 

00:05:38.219 --> 00:05:41.219
 In the south 

00:05:47.599 --> 00:05:49.580
 video is to say 

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:51.069
 I was carrying forward 

00:05:51.069 --> 00:05:52.979
 walk to enter 

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:54.909
 pÃ©rez de la fuente 

00:05:54.909 --> 00:05:57.909
 or the cup 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:01.000
 this madness 

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.319
 then I swear it is a maniac goes into the bags 

00:06:04.319 --> 00:06:06.740
 I also have trovato that does the same 

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:09.740
 He maintained that this is the first street already entered 

00:06:11.669 --> 00:06:13.599
 xxi is going to stop 

00:06:13.599 --> 00:06:16.599
 alak and cofetel 

00:06:17.259 --> 00:06:19.369
 violence 

00:06:19.369 --> 00:06:20.550
 good 

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:22.659
 transition 

00:06:22.659 --> 00:06:25.009
 we are already in the fight 

00:06:25.009 --> 00:06:28.110
 good in the part that needs to be done cooperation in the movie is very very 

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:29.900
 simple 

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:32.119
 those who seek to do 

00:06:32.119 --> 00:06:35.400
 aju zotac of solids 

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:42.030
 audio devices and change the poor micro says media bush audio endorsements 

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:43.819
 agreement 

00:06:43.819 --> 00:06:44.820
 look 

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:49.980
 e la bombonerita laurie el huesca finally out there but it's like you can 

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:53.300
 check that he the official that every time he speaks Spanish lacks the 

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:55.189
 Wand 

00:06:55.189 --> 00:06:59.459
 varela showed that the ante floor would be missing a device change that 

00:06:59.459 --> 00:07:01.110
 It is full of sound points 

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:05.620
 audio output settings is to remember that the audio comes out through fiber optics 

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:11.370
 kessel digital optics come out at the end but attractive to him the digital double 

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:14.419
 we got to yes 

00:07:14.419 --> 00:07:16.169
 perfect 

00:07:16.169 --> 00:07:20.300
 I remember that if Christ and not by the microphones and by the television monti output 

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:22.169
 audio here I am 

00:07:22.169 --> 00:07:24.499
 according to all the pulsars for the two sites 

00:07:24.499 --> 00:07:29.909
 synod I do not know this in case there is somebody you under the helmets and vietnam equaled 

00:07:29.909 --> 00:07:33.849
 to hear the game or if not I know that put them helmet directly 

00:07:33.849 --> 00:07:34.909
 it is not active 

00:07:34.909 --> 00:07:36.919
 that already to each one free 

00:07:36.919 --> 00:07:38.479
 to do what he wants 

00:07:38.479 --> 00:07:40.919
 and good and only missing 

00:07:40.919 --> 00:07:43.919
 then take the game that you want the other black that is 

00:07:44.969 --> 00:07:47.550
 and try the helmets 

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:49.050
