00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:07.990
 good afternoon everyone as he says that 

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:10.030
 he was saying I'm not in good 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:11.840
 I'm out of the country for reasons 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:15.740
 personal 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:18.650
 but we have decided that they have though 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:22.430
 for a few minutes my virtual presence to 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:26.980
 through this video for this first 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:32.200
 meeting was going to look good to everyone 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:34.300
 fashion comes and goes and the style that gives 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:38.450
 style and elegance that they give and are 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:41.890
 own of the same and in 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:45.560
 turning of master I travel a lot 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:51.220
 I know people I see people but go where 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:53.840
 I try to maintain my coherence 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:57.070
 mainly because it makes me feel 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:01:02.090
 well you make me uncomfortable it makes me feel 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:06.229
 that I can find myself relaxed and have and 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:10.400
 I can deal with and deal with everyone because 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:14.450
 because it has to do with that with that 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:17.710
 commitment with myself and with my form 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.710
 to be with my personality 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:27.710
 so again I repeat you have to try 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:33.380
 that fashion is not the one that prevails 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:39.740
 rather you have to try that the same 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:43.010
 can capture in fashion what you have 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:47.870
 what to do with his personality 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:53.150
 it's a long way it's not easy but that 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:55.630
 It gives a lot of satisfaction because that makes 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:57.700
 part of a project and a program of 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.740
 increase 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.869
 he expressed but especially of a 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:05.350
 inner growth of a growth 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:09.310
 interior of an indoor gym for 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:11.830
 try to find the balance the 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:14.860
 serenity to harmony with the rest of the 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:20.860
 world and especially with the same good 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:22.959
 I hope you enjoyed this one 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.720
 these talks of that encounter that is 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:29.739
 the first in a long series and I hope 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:34.799
 that is not the first step of that 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:39.040
 long way for those who still do not 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:42.910
 they had the approach of that process and that 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:48.790
 be a step plus one more link for 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:51.760
 those who are already traveling this is that 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:54.280
 process so so interesting that 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:58.019
 It has to do with some losses that 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:03:02.079
 been he who has allowed that 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:03.970
 I find a thank you other 

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:06.700
 special thanks 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:10.660

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:14.140
 master of all this project and good and 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:15.960

 the 1st 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:27.210
 step towards the development of good 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:30.020
 of something so current so modern so 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:34.540
 own our 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:34.540
