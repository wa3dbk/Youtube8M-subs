00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
the gameplay in the background I do also

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.090 
the gameplay in the background I do also
want<00:00:15.690> to<00:00:15.809> mention<00:00:15.900> this<00:00:16.109> was<00:00:16.410> a<00:00:16.500> quad<00:00:16.890> more

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100

fail<00:00:17.369> and<00:00:17.640> I<00:00:18.180> got<00:00:18.359> really<00:00:18.630> nervous<00:00:18.900> especially

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
fail and I got really nervous especially

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.529 
fail and I got really nervous especially
on<00:00:19.740> the<00:00:19.859> first<00:00:19.890> streak<00:00:20.369> because<00:00:20.699> I<00:00:20.970> think<00:00:21.270> I

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
on the first streak because I think I

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.140 
on the first streak because I think I
died<00:00:21.779> on<00:00:22.020> a<00:00:22.050> 19<00:00:22.680> gunstreak<00:00:23.160> at<00:00:23.369> around<00:00:23.580> 25

died on a 19 gunstreak at around 25
points<00:00:24.630> and<00:00:24.810> I<00:00:25.320> knew<00:00:25.529> if<00:00:25.650> I<00:00:25.769> would<00:00:25.920> have<00:00:25.980> gotten

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
points and I knew if I would have gotten

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.679 
points and I knew if I would have gotten
that<00:00:26.460> moive<00:00:26.820> I<00:00:26.849> definitely<00:00:27.300> would<00:00:27.510> have<00:00:27.539> been

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
that moive I definitely would have been

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.419 
that moive I definitely would have been
able<00:00:27.900> to<00:00:28.050> get<00:00:28.199> at<00:00:28.289> least<00:00:28.320> a<00:00:28.619> triple<00:00:29.039> if<00:00:29.189> not<00:00:29.400> a

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
able to get at least a triple if not a

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:30.919 
able to get at least a triple if not a
quantum<00:00:29.820> off<00:00:30.029> of<00:00:30.179> I<00:00:30.269> would<00:00:30.330> have<00:00:30.539> been<00:00:30.630> able<00:00:30.660> to

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
quantum off of I would have been able to

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.959 
quantum off of I would have been able to
keep<00:00:31.080> my<00:00:31.230> momentum<00:00:31.410> going<00:00:31.890> so<00:00:32.160> I<00:00:32.610> definitely

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
keep my momentum going so I definitely

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.060 
keep my momentum going so I definitely

domination<00:00:42.059> I<00:00:42.270> thought<00:00:42.690> was<00:00:42.809> definitely<00:00:43.200> a

really<00:00:43.620> good<00:00:43.739> amount<00:00:43.980> of<00:00:44.070> kills<00:00:44.219> so<00:00:44.520> that's

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
really good amount of kills so that's

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.180

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
pretty hot in the summer definitely the

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.400 
pretty hot in the summer definitely the
winter<00:02:16.210> it<00:02:16.330> can<00:02:16.360> get<00:02:16.600> pretty<00:02:16.660> cold<00:02:17.020> as<00:02:17.230> well

but<00:02:17.950> yeah<00:02:18.160> sometimes<00:02:18.640> I've<00:02:18.880> been<00:02:19.030> actually

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
but yeah sometimes I've been actually

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.180 
but yeah sometimes I've been actually
sent<00:02:19.720> home<00:02:19.840> my<00:02:20.170> mom<00:02:20.290> has<00:02:20.500> picked<00:02:20.710> me<00:02:20.830> up<00:02:20.860> and

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
sent home my mom has picked me up and

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.670 
sent home my mom has picked me up and
the<00:02:22.090> reason<00:02:22.270> being<00:02:22.510> was<00:02:22.870> because<00:02:23.230> I<00:02:23.260> had<00:02:23.470> a

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
the reason being was because I had a

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.950 
the reason being was because I had a
high<00:02:23.890> temperature<00:02:24.400> I<00:02:24.430> was<00:02:24.700> feeling<00:02:25.090> fine<00:02:25.330> but

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:25.960 
high temperature I was feeling fine but

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.570 
high temperature I was feeling fine but
the<00:02:26.110> thing<00:02:26.320> is<00:02:26.350> since<00:02:27.010> the<00:02:27.190> school<00:02:27.400> didn't

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
the thing is since the school didn't

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:28.950 
the thing is since the school didn't
have<00:02:27.670> air<00:02:27.820> conditioning<00:02:27.970> my<00:02:28.360> temperature<00:02:28.810> was

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:28.960 
have air conditioning my temperature was

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.080 
have air conditioning my temperature was
a<00:02:28.990> lot<00:02:29.230> higher<00:02:29.410> than<00:02:29.470> usual<00:02:29.860> so<00:02:30.310> that's<00:02:30.850> one

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
a lot higher than usual so that's one

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:33.210 
a lot higher than usual so that's one
thing<00:02:31.270> and<00:02:31.570> also<00:02:31.900> if<00:02:32.290> you're<00:02:32.770> not<00:02:33.010> have

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
thing and also if you're not have

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:34.320 
thing and also if you're not have
running<00:02:33.520> a<00:02:33.580> temperature<00:02:33.880> or<00:02:34.060> anything<00:02:34.270> like

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
running a temperature or anything like

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:35.640 
running a temperature or anything like
that<00:02:34.450> you<00:02:34.600> can<00:02:34.780> just<00:02:34.930> say<00:02:35.050> you<00:02:35.110> have<00:02:35.350> a<00:02:35.410> really

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
that you can just say you have a really

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:36.930 
that you can just say you have a really

little bit and you can pretty much just
miss<00:02:41.890> that<00:02:41.920> entire<00:02:42.340> period<00:02:42.580> if<00:02:42.820> you<00:02:42.910> play<00:02:43.090> it

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120

right so that's just one tip I can give
you<00:02:45.010> guys<00:02:45.160> that<00:02:45.370> always<00:02:45.520> worked<00:02:45.820> out<00:02:45.970> pretty

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
you guys that always worked out pretty

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.300 
you guys that always worked out pretty
well<00:02:46.270> for<00:02:46.420> me<00:02:46.660> and<00:02:46.870> it's<00:02:47.410> at<00:02:47.560> least<00:02:47.740> riskiest

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
well for me and it's at least riskiest

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:49.740 
well for me and it's at least riskiest
as<00:02:48.520> well<00:02:48.700> you<00:02:48.910> never<00:02:49.060> would<00:02:49.300> really<00:02:49.510> get<00:02:49.600> in

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
as well you never would really get in

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.360 
as well you never would really get in
trouble<00:02:50.050> for<00:02:50.080> doing<00:02:50.290> anything<00:02:50.590> like<00:02:50.830> that<00:02:50.890> so

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
trouble for doing anything like that so

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:52.650 
trouble for doing anything like that so
definitely<00:02:52.090> would<00:02:52.210> recommend<00:02:52.270> doing

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
definitely would recommend doing

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.330 
definitely would recommend doing
something<00:02:53.050> like<00:02:53.170> that<00:02:53.380> if<00:02:53.590> you<00:02:53.860> absolutely

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
something like that if you absolutely

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.700 
something like that if you absolutely
have<00:02:54.910> to<00:02:55.090> and<00:02:55.480> I<00:02:55.870> do<00:02:55.930> a<00:02:56.020> little<00:02:56.230> sneaky

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:56.710 
have to and I do a little sneaky

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:58.080 
have to and I do a little sneaky
transition<00:02:57.310> right<00:02:57.400> here<00:02:57.550> it<00:02:57.670> looks<00:02:57.820> like<00:02:57.880> i'm

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
transition right here it looks like i'm

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:59.610 
transition right here it looks like i'm
still<00:02:58.360> in<00:02:58.420> the<00:02:58.510> same<00:02:58.660> streak<00:02:59.020> although<00:02:59.380> my

00:02:59.610 --> 00:02:59.620 
still in the same streak although my

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.560 
still in the same streak although my
specialist<00:03:00.100> bonus<00:03:00.370> to<00:03:00.520> disappear<00:03:01.030> and<00:03:01.210> i

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:01.570 
specialist bonus to disappear and i

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:02.790 
specialist bonus to disappear and i
don't<00:03:01.720> know<00:03:01.780> i<00:03:01.810> just<00:03:01.900> realized<00:03:02.410> that<00:03:02.590> when<00:03:02.740> i

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 
don't know i just realized that when i

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.830 
don't know i just realized that when i
was<00:03:02.980> editing<00:03:03.160> this<00:03:03.520> video<00:03:03.700> I<00:03:04.060> kind<00:03:04.570> of<00:03:04.630> noticed

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
was editing this video I kind of noticed

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.450 
was editing this video I kind of noticed
that<00:03:05.110> the<00:03:05.440> streaks<00:03:05.890> that<00:03:06.040> kind<00:03:06.220> of<00:03:06.250> inner

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:06.460 
that the streaks that kind of inner

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:08.790 
that the streaks that kind of inner
combined<00:03:07.000> and<00:03:07.330> I<00:03:07.660> think<00:03:07.900> this<00:03:08.050> is<00:03:08.200> the<00:03:08.410> Tony

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:08.800 
combined and I think this is the Tony

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.680 
combined and I think this is the Tony
gunstreak<00:03:09.160> fail<00:03:09.460> i<00:03:09.490> think<00:03:09.820> i<00:03:09.880> got<00:03:10.000> like<00:03:10.450> turn

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
on the guy and i just couldn't quite

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.700 
on the guy and i just couldn't quite
turn<00:03:12.520> on<00:03:12.700> him<00:03:12.820> so<00:03:13.000> I<00:03:13.030> died<00:03:13.360> but<00:03:13.690> either<00:03:14.140> way<00:03:14.470> I

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:14.710

for getting out of class it's really

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.780

Twitter<00:03:35.080> but<00:03:35.560> what<00:03:35.709> I<00:03:35.740> would<00:03:35.860> do<00:03:36.160> the<00:03:36.340> period

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
Twitter but what I would do the period

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.070 
Twitter but what I would do the period
before<00:03:36.910> I<00:03:37.120> had<00:03:37.270> the<00:03:37.300> test<00:03:37.630> when<00:03:37.840> we<00:03:37.870> were

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:38.080 
before I had the test when we were

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.350 
before I had the test when we were
switching<00:03:38.290> classes<00:03:38.620> I<00:03:39.040> would<00:03:39.400> go<00:03:39.610> and<00:03:39.880> sit<00:03:40.209> in

bathroom stalls for the whole entire

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:46.320 
bathroom stalls for the whole entire
period<00:03:44.350> now<00:03:44.530> this<00:03:44.800> is<00:03:45.010> dependent<00:03:45.880> on<00:03:46.000> whether

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:46.330

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
the day they kind of just expected that

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.120 
the day they kind of just expected that
you<00:03:55.540> were<00:03:55.630> going<00:03:55.720> to<00:03:55.780> be<00:03:55.930> at<00:03:56.020> class<00:03:56.230> so<00:03:56.830> it

you were going to be at class so it

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:58.590 
you were going to be at class so it
worked<00:03:57.340> out<00:03:57.459> pretty<00:03:57.670> well<00:03:57.820> for<00:03:57.970> me<00:03:58.180> I<00:03:58.209> never

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:03.580 
the whole entire period that was only if

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:06.000 
the whole entire period that was only if
I<00:04:03.760> knew<00:04:03.790> that<00:04:04.060> I<00:04:04.240> had<00:04:04.420> a<00:04:04.450> test<00:04:04.780> now<00:04:05.260> if<00:04:05.500> you<00:04:05.650> had

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
I knew that I had a test now if you had

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:07.530 
I knew that I had a test now if you had
an<00:04:06.130> unexpected<00:04:06.580> test<00:04:07.000> obviously<00:04:07.209> you're

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
an unexpected test obviously you're

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:08.699 
an unexpected test obviously you're
gonna<00:04:07.660> have<00:04:07.810> to<00:04:07.870> tell<00:04:08.020> the<00:04:08.140> teacher<00:04:08.320> that<00:04:08.680> you

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:08.709 
gonna have to tell the teacher that you

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:10.530 
gonna have to tell the teacher that you
didn't<00:04:09.040> feel<00:04:09.160> good<00:04:09.220> or<00:04:09.640> you<00:04:10.000> could<00:04:10.209> just<00:04:10.239> take

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:10.540 
didn't feel good or you could just take

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:11.790 
didn't feel good or you could just take
the<00:04:10.570> test<00:04:10.900> but<00:04:11.080> I<00:04:11.140> wouldn't<00:04:11.410> recommend<00:04:11.440> that

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:11.800 
the test but I wouldn't recommend that

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.290 
the test but I wouldn't recommend that
because<00:04:11.980> you<00:04:12.580> know<00:04:12.610> grids<00:04:12.940> they<00:04:13.150> are

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:13.300 
because you know grids they are

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:15.630 
because you know grids they are
important<00:04:13.840> and<00:04:13.989> if<00:04:14.410> you<00:04:14.920> just<00:04:15.220> say<00:04:15.430> that<00:04:15.580> you

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:15.640 
important and if you just say that you

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:16.770 
important and if you just say that you
don't<00:04:15.760> feel<00:04:15.970> good<00:04:16.120> you<00:04:16.239> can<00:04:16.419> get<00:04:16.540> out<00:04:16.630> of<00:04:16.720> the

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 
don't feel good you can get out of the

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:18.720 
don't feel good you can get out of the
test<00:04:16.959> that<00:04:17.140> kind<00:04:17.350> of<00:04:17.380> thing<00:04:17.620> and<00:04:17.830> you<00:04:18.430> can<00:04:18.609> just

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:18.730 
test that kind of thing and you can just

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:20.130 
test that kind of thing and you can just
spit<00:04:19.030> for<00:04:19.359> it<00:04:19.419> the<00:04:19.480> next<00:04:19.510> day<00:04:19.780> like<00:04:20.020> you

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:20.140 
spit for it the next day like you

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:21.330 
spit for it the next day like you
normally<00:04:20.260> would<00:04:20.470> getting<00:04:20.739> better<00:04:21.070> grade<00:04:21.310> than

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:21.340 
normally would getting better grade than
