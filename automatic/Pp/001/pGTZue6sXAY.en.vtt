the<00:01:07.229> same<00:01:07.439> thing<00:01:08.119> the<00:01:09.119> tech<00:01:09.600> box<00:01:09.900> is<00:01:10.140> is<00:01:10.500> white

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
the same thing the tech box is is white

and gray and contains the arcane logo
and<00:01:13.799> back<00:01:13.950> design<00:01:14.180> there's<00:01:15.180> very<00:01:15.420> few<00:01:15.479> words

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
and back design there's very few words

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.280 
and back design there's very few words
on<00:01:16.020> this<00:01:16.170> like<00:01:16.350> I<00:01:16.470> said<00:01:16.500> there's<00:01:16.890> no<00:01:16.950> UPC<00:01:17.820> and

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:18.290 
on this like I said there's no UPC and

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:20.660 
on this like I said there's no UPC and
design<00:01:19.290> actually<00:01:19.590> wraps<00:01:20.040> around<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.640> entire

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
design actually wraps around the entire

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.359 
design actually wraps around the entire
box<00:01:21.210> which<00:01:21.479> is<00:01:21.600> pretty<00:01:21.810> interesting<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.920> back

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
box which is pretty interesting the back

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.710 
box which is pretty interesting the back
design<00:01:23.729> itself<00:01:24.119> is<00:01:24.420> kind<00:01:25.259> of<00:01:25.850> ethereal<00:01:26.850> it's

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
design itself is kind of ethereal it's

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.670 
design itself is kind of ethereal it's
very<00:01:27.930> grey<00:01:28.310> and<00:01:29.310> mystical<00:01:29.939> it<00:01:30.390> contains<00:01:31.350> a<00:01:31.470> lot

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
very grey and mystical it contains a lot

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.749 
very grey and mystical it contains a lot
of<00:01:31.710> like<00:01:32.189> room<00:01:32.880> symbols<00:01:33.450> in<00:01:33.689> a<00:01:34.530> flower<00:01:35.250> like

fleur-de-lis type pattern in the middle
and<00:01:38.990> the<00:01:39.990> back<00:01:40.170> design<00:01:40.409> for<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.829> black<00:01:41.150> deck

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
and the back design for the black deck

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.980 
and the back design for the black deck
is<00:01:42.390> similar<00:01:43.170> but<00:01:43.590> it's<00:01:44.070> very<00:01:44.250> dark<00:01:44.610> in<00:01:44.990> this

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
is similar but it's very dark in this

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.319 
is similar but it's very dark in this
deck<00:01:46.530> does<00:01:46.770> come<00:01:47.009> in<00:01:47.130> a<00:01:47.189> white<00:01:47.399> version<00:01:47.640> and<00:01:47.850> a

black<00:01:48.570> version<00:01:48.899> traditionally<00:01:49.649> and<00:01:49.860> I<00:01:50.520> find

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
black version traditionally and I find

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.880 
black version traditionally and I find
between<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.299> two<00:01:51.479> of<00:01:51.630> the<00:01:51.720> white<00:01:51.930> version<00:01:52.200> you

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
between the two of the white version you

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.710 
between the two of the white version you
can<00:01:53.040> see<00:01:53.070> a<00:01:53.280> lot<00:01:53.490> more<00:01:53.520> of<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:53.970> detail<00:01:54.299> in<00:01:54.509> fact

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
can see a lot more of the detail in fact

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.240 
can see a lot more of the detail in fact
you<00:01:55.110> know<00:01:55.200> if<00:01:55.320> I<00:01:55.409> ever<00:01:55.439> have<00:01:55.740> a<00:01:55.799> choice<00:01:56.009> between

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
you know if I ever have a choice between

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.520 
you know if I ever have a choice between
a<00:01:56.460> white<00:01:56.850> deck<00:01:57.090> or<00:01:57.329> a<00:01:57.630> black<00:01:57.899> deck<00:01:58.140> I'm<00:01:58.320> going

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
a white deck or a black deck I'm going

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.310 
a white deck or a black deck I'm going
to<00:01:58.590> choose<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:58.979> white<00:01:59.130> deck<00:01:59.340> every<00:01:59.850> time

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 
to choose the white deck every time

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.230 
to choose the white deck every time
preferably<00:02:01.320> because<00:02:01.890> of<00:02:02.189> just<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:02.939> card
