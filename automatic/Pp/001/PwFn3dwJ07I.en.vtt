00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
 to the castles of minecraft from mons io sono 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.210
 piece and today I'm here to introduce you to the 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.200
 to Tom 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:12.750
 mod let's start right away but let's see 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.580
 what introduces us this new fashion 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.410
 first of all this fashion introduces us 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.020
 a new dimension that we can do 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:22.050
 blend the golden with this object 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.300
 scarab the kraft I call with four 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.119
 goulding ott and a diamond we must 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:30.330
 find us in a desert blog have 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:33.540
 of the stone dela excuse of the sandstone 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.880
 at our feet and click inside 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.309
 of the sandstone with the right button col 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.410
 our golden club 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.750
 once done this will appear 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.730
 I now use the portal on the 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.379
 on science are even though I believe so 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.940
 can use on the sand 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.399
 it takes for sandstone I had 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.020
 reason ok we use it on 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.449
 sandstone is this ours 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.579
 portal and what we do now for 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.920
 enter the dimension we click 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.620
 again with the right button at 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.480
 center where this hole is and we enter 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.210
 in size 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.960
 then I'll read to you that we can 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.020
 to find 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.520
 meanwhile, once married, you see that 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.750
 looks like a sandstorm 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.229
 looks like we're right in the middle 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.900
 of a sandstorm party 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.509
 if we try to put it as you see it is to do 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.909
 at its option once you return to the menu 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.189
 main look at us will come back as you have 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.200
 just seen on the short so we have 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.659
 a few let's say seconds to see the 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.119
 surrounding world and then back to normal 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.810
 first thing we will find in this 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.490
 dimension 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.740
 first we will find these 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.439
 skeletons that should be of 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.110
 let's say mummies don't play mummies though 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:45.270
 that is, look at these zombies now 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.100
 they are not so bad they are enough 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.020
 strong give us the effect of slowness 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.500
 however they don't make us so many South have 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.750
 strong are these are put me the 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.909
 creativity I die here's how you see there 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:00.210
 they are different groups of mummies like 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:02.460
 see these these two is that then 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.070
 they are really different and from a hook and 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:08.310
 really well done we will always find 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.720
 these palms we say don't believe 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.850
 it is possible to find water that 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.220
 we have some 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:14.390
 banished from the desert is the most beautiful thing 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.160
 what we want to find are 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.870
 great pyramids 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.080
 now I should look for evidence of this 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:23.180
 which is an oasis I should look for but it is also 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.400
 quite difficult to find and what 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.110
 we will find in these pyramids in these 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.770
 pyramids of his found of the ruins 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.010
 as you see 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:34.460
 here they are special because they are inside 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.510
 this basket see if there will be gods 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:37.880
 objects as you have just seen 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:40.130
 we will find these objects that will be 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.140
 different and when we get closer 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.420
 will work both from certain and from mob 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.250
 spooner and we can therefore find these 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.390
 types of ruins or as I told you 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:52.280
 before the great Egyptian pyramids 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:54.170
 egyptian egyptians sorry egyptians see 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.030
 here too some ruins now 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.770
 should spur the mob when 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.470
 we kill on the furniture we can open e 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:03.980
 we will find the objects and only bring one 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.550
 a little bit far it will take away because it is 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.680
 fast 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:09.920
 by you can't even weigh a wall 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.510
 or very good when it would have been 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.130
 far to open them we will find how 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.620
 see different objects 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:17.330
 here's what brings us this fashion over 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:20.450
 to the pyramids to all the objects there 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:21.620
 introduces these armors now a 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.890
 moment that I put the menu of too many 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:28.550
 items of not enough item then meanwhile 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:30.440
 we will find different types of drops or 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:33.020
 sandstone with which we can craft like 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.880
 see also the limestone funes 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:36.200
 now I don't know how they work though 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:39.440
 they should be normal sims in 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:42.830
 furnace but adapted to this biome then 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:45.290
 we can find you see ico always 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:48.170
 same things, however, of different material 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:50.510
 that is, a dimension we can 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.850
 say equal and contrary to this 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:55.400
 we will always find the same objects though 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:59.450
 they will be made differently but here 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:01.310
 all the weapons begin 

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:02.990
 objects we can find 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.670
 meanwhile you see the objects are 

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:06.710
 focused here we still enjoy 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:09.170
 sclavi that I showed you before the 

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:11.090
 scimitar the short bauer we have 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:15.560
 of the objects that would now be there 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:16.940
 I show the pick and let that 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.200
 however it should not be an ax though 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.960
 I don't know why it's a back 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:24.520
 then we have here is a sword in jazz the 

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:26.660
 so far 46 are even six 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:30.560
 this should be a ball e 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:33.350
 this should be a 1 and then 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:35.660
 we see the strength of this sword I would say 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:37.700
 which is strong enough to kill us 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:39.830
 with two shots all the mod 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:42.740
 the experience that I really have to say 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:44.600
 low because as you have just seen 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:46.250
 there is practically nothing dropped 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:50.090
 this serves a little peric 9 back 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:51.650
 but I think it's more useful on seeing 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:55.070
 that now this is pretty strong all 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:56.930
 the thing caught that is not my dropped 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:59.210
 practically nothing ok anyway 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:01.670
 here is another basket as we see 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:03.050
 now of the dirt i tool that i don't know 

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:05.060
 good use even if it 's not there 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:08.210
 dovrebbere should be a statuette 

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:11.450
 because this is how you expect it 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:13.400
 we still say over but they are 

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:15.020
 adding the last things again 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:17.480
 statuettes I don't know yet what it is for 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:19.730
 see let's have a sweet I am a bit 

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:21.590
 I really don't know what's also why 

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:23.270
 they ca n't be placed, I don't know how 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:25.130
 use them as this is not a former one 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:27.830
 play on fashion but it is only for 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:29.750
 show it to you I won't show you how to do it 

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:32.000
 things then we have this we say 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:35.570
 beautiful armor or I was wrong a 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:38.090
 click this beautiful armor ok 

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:40.490
 this beautiful armor the horus 

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:42.620
 armor no only the feet are of horus 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:45.050
 anyway ok is given a moment that has 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:47.420
 got more tech tic tac objects and these 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:49.610
 we wear them now I make you 

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:51.560
 meanwhile, seeing aesthetics really is 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:52.970
 beautiful and done really well except for 

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:55.100
 eyes that do not understand them 

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:56.540
 and when we remove it it should give us 

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:59.420
 of the effects that I do not know why now 

00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:01.820
 do not give them or you are still 

00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:03.740
 ok guys i found the pyramid here 

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:06.350
 then this is the form I make it for you 

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:08.360
 moment to see here is what we find in his 

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:10.160
 internal we find we say a little 

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:12.470
 maze from these objects 

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:14.630
 if we approach it we will catch fire 

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:16.820
 so it's really a real one 

00:06:14.630 --> 00:06:20.050
 maze with these hidden traps 

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:22.070
 we will have to try not to get hit 

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:24.830
 however arrived at some point 

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:28.160
 now I break myself and after a while 

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:29.600
 because already from positivi do everything 

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:32.420
 so I could go directly to 

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:34.160
 I didn't want the treasure chamber 

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:36.740
 do I wanted to look for it with you here is the 

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:37.610
 which treasure chamber we find 

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:40.840
 this room 

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:43.310
 we find the boss that is the pharaoh horner 

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:45.050
 fourth I would say we can kill him 

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:46.639
 since we have a beautiful sword, oh well 

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:49.520
 in fact we do a lot of damage with 

00:06:46.639 --> 00:06:51.379
 you see the pharaoh orl at the already 

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:54.349
 long the drop I must say that it is 

00:06:51.379 --> 00:06:56.539
 lousy except for the ex there is a bar 

00:06:54.349 --> 00:06:57.409
 of gold and as you can see, however, we find 

00:06:56.539 --> 00:06:59.629
 so many objects 

00:06:57.409 --> 00:07:01.009
 so guys this is all there is 

00:06:59.629 --> 00:07:03.229
 introduces this new fashion 

00:07:01.009 --> 00:07:05.330
 I remind you to like me 

00:07:03.229 --> 00:07:06.770
 80 I like to publish new fashions of 

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:08.539
 write to the channel before black updated 

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:09.860
 on upcoming fashions that will come out and there 

00:07:08.539 --> 00:07:10.879
 let's see in a next video on ever 

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:13.360
 created by mode 

00:07:10.879 --> 00:07:13.360
 hello everyone guys
