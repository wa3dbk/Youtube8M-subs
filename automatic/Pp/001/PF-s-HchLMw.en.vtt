center<00:03:36.090> midfielder<00:03:36.720> is<00:03:37.129> paulinho<00:03:38.129> now<00:03:38.760> the

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:38.819 
center midfielder is paulinho now the

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:40.849 
center midfielder is paulinho now the
reason<00:03:39.120> that<00:03:39.329> i<00:03:39.480> picked<00:03:39.780> paulinho<00:03:40.199> is<00:03:40.470> because

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:40.859 
reason that i picked paulinho is because

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:43.460 
reason that i picked paulinho is because
i<00:03:40.889> needed<00:03:41.310> that<00:03:41.549> strong<00:03:41.909> link<00:03:42.180> between<00:03:42.470> the

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
i needed that strong link between the

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:45.229 
i needed that strong link between the
two<00:03:43.650> players<00:03:43.949> to<00:03:44.069> give<00:03:44.370> mariah's<00:03:44.909> full

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
two players to give mariah's full

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:47.210 
two players to give mariah's full
chemistry<00:03:45.780> so<00:03:46.169> they<00:03:46.290> both<00:03:46.470> play<00:03:46.739> with<00:03:46.979> at

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
chemistry so they both play with at

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:48.860 
chemistry so they both play with at
corinthians<00:03:48.000> i<00:03:48.150> think<00:03:48.389> and<00:03:48.569> they're<00:03:48.720> both

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
corinthians i think and they're both

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.589 
corinthians i think and they're both
brazilian<00:03:49.530> so<00:03:49.889> again<00:03:50.400> that<00:03:50.940> gives<00:03:51.120> them<00:03:51.359> nine

00:03:51.589 --> 00:03:51.599 
brazilian so again that gives them nine

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:53.809 
brazilian so again that gives them nine
chemistry<00:03:52.199> now<00:03:52.680> you<00:03:52.739> can<00:03:52.979> probably<00:03:53.280> guess<00:03:53.430> who

00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:53.819

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:20.659 
he's actually pretty good he's got a
very<00:05:18.720> good<00:05:18.930> long<00:05:19.199> shot<00:05:19.560> now<00:05:19.740> he<00:05:19.800> may<00:05:20.070> be<00:05:20.130> slow

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:20.669 
very good long shot now he may be slow

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:23.180 
very good long shot now he may be slow
but<00:05:20.940> his<00:05:21.449> his<00:05:21.810> power<00:05:22.139> and<00:05:22.500> strength<00:05:22.860> is

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:23.190 
but his his power and strength is

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:25.129 
but his his power and strength is
ridiculous<00:05:23.789> he<00:05:23.910> pushes<00:05:24.360> so<00:05:24.570> many<00:05:24.750> defenders

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:25.139

ridiculous he pushes so many defenders
off<00:05:25.349> the<00:05:25.500> ball<00:05:25.680> and<00:05:25.889> he<00:05:26.400> is<00:05:26.550> a<00:05:26.580> pretty<00:05:27.150> pretty

00:05:27.469 --> 00:05:27.479 
off the ball and he is a pretty pretty

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:30.020 
off the ball and he is a pretty pretty
good<00:05:27.780> finisher<00:05:28.289> so<00:05:28.740> again<00:05:29.099> I<00:05:29.280> do<00:05:29.340> like<00:05:29.669> playing

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:43.800 
team with nine chemistry I've brought in

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:48.050 
team with nine chemistry I've brought in
five<00:05:44.070> leagues<00:05:44.490> and<00:05:44.880> a<00:05:45.770> five<00:05:46.770> nationality<00:05:47.760> so

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:48.060

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:55.670 
it is a true hybrid now that team all
together<00:05:50.729> it<00:05:51.449> costs<00:05:52.349> between<00:05:52.740> at<00:05:53.870> 192<00:05:54.870> 200k

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:55.680 
together it costs between at 192 200k

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:58.370 
together it costs between at 192 200k
it's<00:05:56.190> very<00:05:56.580> manageable<00:05:57.000> to<00:05:57.479> actually<00:05:58.020> afford

00:05:58.370 --> 00:05:58.380 
it's very manageable to actually afford

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:00.409 
it's very manageable to actually afford
it<00:05:58.530> now<00:05:58.919> if<00:05:59.070> you<00:05:59.190> want<00:05:59.460> you<00:05:59.729> can<00:05:59.880> replace<00:06:00.180> the
