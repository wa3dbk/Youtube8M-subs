00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:59.510 
flour mixture and let that mix and I'm
going<00:02:53.020> to<00:02:53.170> pour<00:02:53.650> in<00:02:53.860> half<00:02:54.190> of<00:02:54.430> my<00:02:54.580> buttermilk

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.220 

okay<00:03:00.520> and<00:03:00.760> I'm<00:03:00.940> going<00:03:01.090> to<00:03:01.120> add<00:03:01.300> the<00:03:01.540> rest<00:03:01.840> of<00:03:02.050> my

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
okay and I'm going to add the rest of my

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:16.410 
okay and I'm going to add the rest of my
flour<00:03:02.530> at<00:03:02.920> this<00:03:03.069> point<00:03:13.470> and<00:03:14.910> the<00:03:15.910> rest<00:03:16.060> of<00:03:16.300> my

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
flour at this point and the rest of my

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.620 
flour at this point and the rest of my
buttermilk

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:22.990 

so<00:03:21.170> the<00:03:21.290> final<00:03:21.650> step<00:03:21.920> will<00:03:22.130> be<00:03:22.160> to<00:03:22.280> add<00:03:22.610> the

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
so the final step will be to add the

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.720 
so the final step will be to add the
vinegar<00:03:23.420> and<00:03:23.720> baking<00:03:23.990> soda<00:03:24.400> when<00:03:25.400> this<00:03:25.550> is

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
vinegar and baking soda when this is

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.650 
vinegar and baking soda when this is
fully<00:03:25.940> combined<00:03:26.420> I<00:03:26.630> will<00:03:26.840> be<00:03:26.930> back<00:03:27.140> to<00:03:27.350> do<00:03:27.470> that

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
fully combined I will be back to do that

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.360 
fully combined I will be back to do that
so<00:03:29.660> the<00:03:29.750> last<00:03:29.960> step<00:03:30.260> is<00:03:30.530> to<00:03:30.560> combine<00:03:31.160> the

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
so the last step is to combine the

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.180 
so the last step is to combine the
vinegar<00:03:32.210> with<00:03:32.390> the<00:03:32.540> baking<00:03:32.930> soda<00:03:33.170> and<00:03:33.770> before

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190 
vinegar with the baking soda and before

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:35.770 
vinegar with the baking soda and before
I<00:03:34.220> pour<00:03:34.580> it<00:03:34.730> in<00:03:34.850> I'm<00:03:34.970> going<00:03:35.150> to<00:03:35.240> turn<00:03:35.480> this<00:03:35.630> on

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
I pour it in I'm going to turn this on

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:41.050 
I pour it in I'm going to turn this on
to<00:03:35.990> low<00:03:36.170> and<00:03:37.270> pour<00:03:38.270> in<00:03:38.480> the<00:03:38.690> vinegar<00:03:39.730> and<00:03:40.730> I'm

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
to low and pour in the vinegar and I'm

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.740 
to low and pour in the vinegar and I'm
going<00:03:41.210> to<00:03:41.240> take<00:03:41.480> that<00:03:41.720> mixture<00:03:42.200> and<00:03:43.750> slowly
