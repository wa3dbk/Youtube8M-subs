00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.920 
a little bit different just like each
chroma<00:01:45.840> squad<00:01:46.079> is<00:01:46.470> a<00:01:46.560> little<00:01:46.799> bit<00:01:46.920> different

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:47.930 
chroma squad is a little bit different

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.050 
chroma squad is a little bit different
first<00:01:48.930> up<00:01:49.200> after<00:01:50.159> you<00:01:50.310> glue<00:01:50.549> your<00:01:50.610> stripes

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
first up after you glue your stripes

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.450 
first up after you glue your stripes
down<00:01:51.799> you<00:01:52.799> make<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.189> breast<00:01:53.490> cancer<00:01:53.939> symbol

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
down you make the breast cancer symbol

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.999 
down you make the breast cancer symbol
like<00:01:56.460> this

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:00.009 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:02.319 

here<00:02:01.009> comes<00:02:01.250> the<00:02:01.399> part<00:02:01.700> that's<00:02:01.939> a<00:02:02.000> little<00:02:02.240> bit

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:02.329 
here comes the part that's a little bit

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:07.149 
here comes the part that's a little bit
more<00:02:02.509> difficult<00:02:03.610> actually<00:02:05.860> you<00:02:06.860> make<00:02:07.039> the

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:07.159 
more difficult actually you make the

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:10.059 
more difficult actually you make the
breast<00:02:07.399> cancer<00:02:07.789> symbol<00:02:08.000> like<00:02:08.300> this<00:02:08.709> so<00:02:09.709> both

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:10.069 
breast cancer symbol like this so both

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:14.500 
breast cancer symbol like this so both
sides<00:02:10.280> are<00:02:10.879> facing<00:02:11.510> same<00:02:12.260> time<00:02:13.030> both<00:02:14.030> sides<00:02:14.300> of

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
sides are facing same time both sides of

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.479 
sides are facing same time both sides of
15<00:02:16.510> after<00:02:17.510> you<00:02:17.810> have<00:02:17.959> to<00:02:18.140> assemble<00:02:18.380> the<00:02:19.190> back

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:19.489 
15 after you have to assemble the back

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:22.690 
15 after you have to assemble the back
piece<00:02:19.790> right<00:02:20.090> here<00:02:20.120> you<00:02:20.630> press<00:02:20.959> it<00:02:20.989> down<00:02:21.700> like

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
piece right here you press it down like

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.930 
piece right here you press it down like
this<00:02:24.040> see<00:02:25.040> how<00:02:25.190> it's<00:02:25.340> kind<00:02:25.370> of<00:02:25.580> making<00:02:25.700> a

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:25.940 
this see how it's kind of making a

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.479 
this see how it's kind of making a
little<00:02:26.120> bow<00:02:26.330> down<00:02:26.569> now<00:02:27.470> you<00:02:27.530> can<00:02:27.799> adjust<00:02:27.950> it<00:02:28.459> to

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:28.489 
little bow down now you can adjust it to

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:30.820 
little bow down now you can adjust it to
