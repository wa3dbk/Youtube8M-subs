00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:55.069 
what I mean the reason the rationale for

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:57.099 
what I mean the reason the rationale for
always<00:02:55.519> putting<00:02:55.700> your<00:02:56.120> presentation<00:02:56.840> side

and<00:03:05.810> I<00:03:05.900> always<00:03:06.020> leave<00:03:06.260> the<00:03:06.410> skin<00:03:06.680> on<00:03:06.709> because<00:03:07.069> I

00:03:07.809 --> 00:03:07.819 
and I always leave the skin on because I

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:10.120 
and I always leave the skin on because I
find<00:03:08.030> that<00:03:08.209> so<00:03:08.270> much<00:03:08.569> more<00:03:09.050> crispy<00:03:09.410> that<00:03:09.920> way
