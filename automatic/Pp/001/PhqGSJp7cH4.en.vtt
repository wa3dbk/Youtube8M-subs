hi<00:00:00.780> there<00:00:00.989> a<00:00:01.800> little<00:00:02.129> while<00:00:02.429> ago<00:00:02.580> I<00:00:03.030> recorded

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:03.480 
hi there a little while ago I recorded

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.329 
hi there a little while ago I recorded
the<00:00:03.600> video<00:00:03.750> I'm<00:00:04.410> looking<00:00:04.770> at<00:00:04.890> how<00:00:05.009> to<00:00:05.040> play

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339 
the video I'm looking at how to play

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.240 
the video I'm looking at how to play
double<00:00:05.759> octave<00:00:06.170> passages<00:00:07.170> and<00:00:07.589> I<00:00:07.680> used<00:00:07.950> as<00:00:08.130> an

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
double octave passages and I used as an

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.499 
double octave passages and I used as an
example<00:00:08.550> the<00:00:08.849> list<00:00:09.059> being-<00:00:09.840> alotta<00:00:11.330> now<00:00:12.330> in

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
example the list being- alotta now in

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.419 
example the list being- alotta now in
that<00:00:12.660> particular<00:00:12.900> example<00:00:13.889> the<00:00:13.950> octaves<00:00:14.280> are

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
that particular example the octaves are

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.060 
that particular example the octaves are
fairly<00:00:14.700> fast<00:00:15.150> and<00:00:15.929> it<00:00:16.139> works<00:00:16.379> quite<00:00:16.619> nicely<00:00:16.680> if

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
fairly fast and it works quite nicely if

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.470 
fairly fast and it works quite nicely if
they're<00:00:17.250> playing<00:00:17.490> with<00:00:17.670> a<00:00:17.699> slightly<00:00:18.240> detached

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
they're playing with a slightly detached

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.560 
they're playing with a slightly detached
feel<00:00:19.400> plus<00:00:20.400> you<00:00:20.580> can<00:00:20.730> also<00:00:20.880> use<00:00:21.000> a<00:00:21.150> little<00:00:21.449> bit

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
feel plus you can also use a little bit

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.210 
feel plus you can also use a little bit
of<00:00:21.600> pedal<00:00:21.930> in<00:00:22.020> those<00:00:22.170> examples<00:00:22.590> to<00:00:22.980> achieve

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
of pedal in those examples to achieve

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.849 
of pedal in those examples to achieve
the<00:00:23.430> kind<00:00:23.609> of<00:00:23.699> correct<00:00:23.970> effect<00:00:24.449> as<00:00:25.109> a<00:00:25.320> response

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
the kind of correct effect as a response

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.099 
the kind of correct effect as a response
to<00:00:25.949> that<00:00:26.250> I've<00:00:26.519> had<00:00:26.849> somebody<00:00:27.090> ask<00:00:27.449> for<00:00:27.930> some

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
to that I've had somebody ask for some

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.710 
to that I've had somebody ask for some
tips<00:00:28.349> on<00:00:28.529> how<00:00:29.010> to<00:00:29.070> play<00:00:29.369> legato<00:00:29.609> octaves<00:00:30.539> so

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
tips on how to play legato octaves so

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.269 
tips on how to play legato octaves so
that's<00:00:30.960> what<00:00:31.199> ISIL<00:00:31.590> would<00:00:31.710> look<00:00:31.890> at<00:00:32.040> in<00:00:32.130> this

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
that's what ISIL would look at in this

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.410 
that's what ISIL would look at in this
particular<00:00:32.460> video<00:00:34.910> when<00:00:35.910> we<00:00:35.940> play<00:00:36.210> legato

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
particular video when we play legato

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.420 
particular video when we play legato
octaves<00:00:37.230> they're<00:00:37.410> often<00:00:37.739> asked<00:00:37.890> to<00:00:38.070> be<00:00:38.160> played

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
octaves they're often asked to be played

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.610 
octaves they're often asked to be played
as<00:00:38.610> a<00:00:38.640> much<00:00:38.910> more<00:00:39.120> steady<00:00:39.510> tempo<00:00:40.079> which<00:00:40.410> is<00:00:40.590> a

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
as a much more steady tempo which is a

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.850 
as a much more steady tempo which is a
big<00:00:40.800> advantage<00:00:40.920> and<00:00:42.410> really<00:00:43.410> there's<00:00:43.649> several

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
big advantage and really there's several

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.380 
big advantage and really there's several
ways<00:00:44.010> of<00:00:44.280> getting<00:00:44.579> around<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.910> problem<00:00:45.090> and

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
ways of getting around the problem and

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.569 
ways of getting around the problem and
it<00:00:45.480> does<00:00:45.660> depend<00:00:45.840> a<00:00:46.110> bit<00:00:46.140> on<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.980> span<00:00:47.340> that

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
it does depend a bit on the span that

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.410 
it does depend a bit on the span that
you<00:00:47.640> have<00:00:47.850> with<00:00:48.059> your<00:00:48.180> hands<00:00:49.969> for<00:00:50.969> example<00:00:51.360> if

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
you have with your hands for example if

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.510 
you have with your hands for example if
i<00:00:51.510> look<00:00:51.660> at<00:00:51.809> d<00:00:51.989> flat<00:00:52.230> major<00:00:52.289> scale<00:00:52.739> how<00:00:53.219> we<00:00:53.280> make

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
i look at d flat major scale how we make

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.080 
i look at d flat major scale how we make
that<00:00:53.730> might<00:00:54.390> make<00:00:54.660> that<00:00:54.840> legate<00:00:55.550> if<00:00:56.550> we<00:00:56.910> can

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
that might make that legate if we can

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.810 
that might make that legate if we can
span<00:00:57.480> between<00:00:58.260> two<00:00:58.680> Black<00:00:58.949> Keys<00:00:58.980> an<00:00:59.460> octave

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
span between two Black Keys an octave

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.599 
span between two Black Keys an octave
using<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:00.899> first<00:01:01.289> and<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.829> third<00:01:01.859> finger

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
using the first and the third finger

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.369 
using the first and the third finger
that's<00:01:03.030> quite<00:01:03.420> a<00:01:03.449> big<00:01:03.660> advantage<00:01:03.989> because

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
that's quite a big advantage because

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:14.830 
that's quite a big advantage because
what<00:01:04.680> we<00:01:04.830> can<00:01:04.979> then<00:01:05.189> do<00:01:05.840> 13<00:01:06.840> 14<00:01:08.270> 15<00:01:10.159> 13<00:01:11.600> 14<00:01:12.600> 15

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
what we can then do 13 14 15 13 14 15

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.780 
what we can then do 13 14 15 13 14 15
and<00:01:15.840> so<00:01:16.080> on<00:01:16.140> so<00:01:16.890> that<00:01:17.070> could<00:01:17.189> be<00:01:17.250> quite<00:01:17.400> a<00:01:17.520> big

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
and so on so that could be quite a big

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.880 
and so on so that could be quite a big
advantage<00:01:18.150> if<00:01:18.570> you<00:01:18.689> can<00:01:18.990> stretch<00:01:19.380> that<00:01:19.439> one

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
advantage if you can stretch that one

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.719 
advantage if you can stretch that one
two<00:01:20.130> three<00:01:21.680> the<00:01:22.680> other<00:01:22.799> thing<00:01:23.100> that<00:01:23.130> we<00:01:23.369> can<00:01:23.490> do

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
two three the other thing that we can do

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.020 
two three the other thing that we can do
is<00:01:24.320> finger<00:01:25.320> substitution<00:01:26.220> so<00:01:26.460> we<00:01:26.549> could<00:01:26.759> start

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
is finger substitution so we could start

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:33.020 
is finger substitution so we could start
with<00:01:27.119> 14<00:01:28.020> and<00:01:29.329> then<00:01:30.890> 15<00:01:31.890> but<00:01:32.340> then<00:01:32.520> while<00:01:32.850> we

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
with 14 and then 15 but then while we

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.969 
with 14 and then 15 but then while we
hold<00:01:33.210> that<00:01:33.540> down<00:01:34.100> swap<00:01:35.100> to<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:35.939> fourth<00:01:36.210> finger

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:36.979 
hold that down swap to the fourth finger

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:41.899 
hold that down swap to the fourth finger
so<00:01:37.979> we<00:01:38.070> start<00:01:38.369> with<00:01:38.460> 14<00:01:39.090> go<00:01:39.659> to<00:01:39.720> 15<00:01:40.610> swap<00:01:41.610> to<00:01:41.820> the

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
so we start with 14 go to 15 swap to the

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.719 
so we start with 14 go to 15 swap to the
fourth<00:01:42.240> go<00:01:42.600> to<00:01:42.659> work<00:01:43.049> for<00:01:43.530> swaps<00:01:44.159> of<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.430> fifth

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
fourth go to work for swaps of the fifth

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:52.429 
fourth go to work for swaps of the fifth
fourth<00:01:45.329> sorry<00:01:45.950> 15<00:01:50.420> so<00:01:51.420> that<00:01:51.570> by<00:01:51.720> continuously

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
fourth sorry 15 so that by continuously

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.200 
fourth sorry 15 so that by continuously
swapping<00:01:53.009> that<00:01:53.159> top<00:01:53.399> leg<00:01:53.610> playing<00:01:53.939> it<00:01:54.090> with

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
swapping that top leg playing it with

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.080 
swapping that top leg playing it with
four<00:01:54.570> and<00:01:55.320> then<00:01:55.470> socking<00:01:55.920> 25<00:01:56.280> while<00:01:56.640> I<00:01:56.670> hold<00:01:56.939> it

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
four and then socking 25 while I hold it

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.999 
four and then socking 25 while I hold it
down<00:01:57.299> it<00:01:57.600> then<00:01:57.750> freeze<00:01:58.079> my<00:01:58.290> fourth<00:01:58.560> finger<00:01:58.740> to

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
down it then freeze my fourth finger to

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:07.479 
down it then freeze my fourth finger to
play<00:01:59.159> the<00:01:59.219> next<00:01:59.490> octave<00:02:00.020> Lagarto

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:07.489 

00:02:07.489 --> 00:02:10.430 

so<00:02:08.489> that's<00:02:09.179> really<00:02:09.360> two<00:02:09.660> methods<00:02:10.140> you<00:02:10.259> can<00:02:10.289> use

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
so that's really two methods you can use

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.080 
so that's really two methods you can use
the<00:02:10.739> one<00:02:10.890> and<00:02:11.039> three<00:02:11.250> to<00:02:11.400> help<00:02:11.580> you<00:02:11.760> if<00:02:11.970> you

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
the one and three to help you if you

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.780 
the one and three to help you if you
have<00:02:12.360> a<00:02:12.599> fairly<00:02:13.110> big<00:02:13.319> stretch<00:02:13.769> if<00:02:14.459> you<00:02:14.640> have<00:02:14.760> a

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
have a fairly big stretch if you have a

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.449 
have a fairly big stretch if you have a
limited<00:02:15.239> span<00:02:15.629> use<00:02:16.319> one<00:02:16.590> and<00:02:16.739> four<00:02:16.980> and<00:02:17.160> SWAT

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
limited span use one and four and SWAT
