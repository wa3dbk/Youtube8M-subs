hey<00:00:06.060> guys<00:00:06.240> jaded<00:00:06.720> an<00:00:07.109> aka<00:00:07.620> Jed<00:00:08.040> here<00:00:08.280> and

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
hey guys jaded an aka Jed here and

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.970 
hey guys jaded an aka Jed here and
today's<00:00:09.389> snowball<00:00:09.809> topic<00:00:10.170> let's<00:00:10.469> talk<00:00:10.740> about

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
today's snowball topic let's talk about

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.580 
today's snowball topic let's talk about
base<00:00:11.550> materials<00:00:12.150> which<00:00:12.360> base<00:00:12.750> on<00:00:13.110> a<00:00:13.170> snowboard

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
base materials which base on a snowboard

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.770 
base materials which base on a snowboard
is<00:00:13.920> best<00:00:14.190> because<00:00:14.639> I<00:00:14.880> was<00:00:15.269> reading<00:00:15.450> some

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
is best because I was reading some

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.510 
is best because I was reading some
foreign<00:00:16.049> threads<00:00:16.350> online<00:00:16.710> and<00:00:16.980> people<00:00:17.220> are

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
foreign threads online and people are

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.519 
foreign threads online and people are
really<00:00:17.760> confused<00:00:18.090> as<00:00:18.510> to<00:00:18.539> which<00:00:18.960> snowball

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
really confused as to which snowball

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.429 
really confused as to which snowball
base<00:00:19.890> type<00:00:20.220> is<00:00:20.490> best<00:00:20.850> and<00:00:21.150> that's<00:00:21.930> some

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
base type is best and that's some

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:23.960 
base type is best and that's some
mistakes<00:00:22.949> that<00:00:23.100> people<00:00:23.310> are<00:00:23.519> making<00:00:23.699> when

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
mistakes that people are making when

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.029 
mistakes that people are making when
you're<00:00:24.090> thinking<00:00:24.269> about<00:00:24.449> bases<00:00:24.960> so<00:00:25.199> firstly

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
you're thinking about bases so firstly

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.830 
you're thinking about bases so firstly
there<00:00:26.310> are<00:00:26.340> two<00:00:26.670> main<00:00:26.910> types<00:00:26.939> of<00:00:27.420> snow<00:00:27.660> what

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
there are two main types of snow what

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.660 
there are two main types of snow what
bases<00:00:28.199> there's<00:00:28.500> extruded<00:00:29.070> bases<00:00:29.460> and

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
bases there's extruded bases and

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.900 
bases there's extruded bases and
synthesis<00:00:30.599> so<00:00:31.140> those<00:00:31.980> two<00:00:32.279> bases<00:00:32.669> are<00:00:32.790> the

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
synthesis so those two bases are the

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.380 
synthesis so those two bases are the
main<00:00:33.090> bases<00:00:33.480> that<00:00:33.570> you<00:00:33.630> find<00:00:33.960> in<00:00:34.370> 99%<00:00:35.370> of<00:00:36.149> all

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
main bases that you find in 99% of all

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.240 
main bases that you find in 99% of all
snowball<00:00:36.840> so<00:00:36.989> basically<00:00:37.290> all<00:00:37.410> snowboards

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
snowball so basically all snowboards

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.200 
snowball so basically all snowboards
have<00:00:38.460> those<00:00:38.730> bases<00:00:39.239> in<00:00:39.390> them<00:00:39.570> so<00:00:40.760> the<00:00:41.760> common

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
have those bases in them so the common

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.729 
have those bases in them so the common
mistake<00:00:42.570> that<00:00:42.600> people<00:00:42.809> make<00:00:43.079> is<00:00:43.230> thinking

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
mistake that people make is thinking

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.819 
mistake that people make is thinking
that<00:00:44.030> extruded<00:00:45.030> bases<00:00:45.450> are<00:00:45.629> more<00:00:45.960> durable<00:00:46.500> but

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
that extruded bases are more durable but

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.979 
that extruded bases are more durable but
slower<00:00:47.160> than<00:00:47.399> scented<00:00:47.730> bases<00:00:48.090> that's<00:00:48.570> not

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
slower than scented bases that's not

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.680 
slower than scented bases that's not
true<00:00:49.379> so<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.489> truth<00:00:50.730> is<00:00:51.000> actually<00:00:51.210> that

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
true so the truth is actually that

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.040 
true so the truth is actually that
sintered<00:00:52.289> bases<00:00:52.910> can<00:00:53.910> come<00:00:54.180> in<00:00:54.449> a<00:00:54.719> few

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
sintered bases can come in a few

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.650 
sintered bases can come in a few
different<00:00:55.489> constructions<00:00:56.489> and<00:00:56.730> they<00:00:57.480> can

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
different constructions and they can

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.220 
different constructions and they can
come<00:00:57.870> from<00:00:58.460> softer<00:00:59.460> than<00:00:59.579> extruded<00:01:00.090> up<00:01:00.239> to<00:01:00.600> way

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
come from softer than extruded up to way

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.529 
come from softer than extruded up to way
more<00:01:01.440> durable<00:01:01.800> than<00:01:01.980> extruded<00:01:02.879> bases<00:01:03.270> so

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
more durable than extruded bases so

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.570 
more durable than extruded bases so
depending<00:01:04.439> on<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.650> type<00:01:04.830> of<00:01:04.860> scented<00:01:05.369> base

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
depending on the type of scented base

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.380 
depending on the type of scented base
that<00:01:05.880> you<00:01:05.970> have<00:01:06.770> it's<00:01:07.770> actually<00:01:08.340> tends<00:01:09.060> to<00:01:09.270> be

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
that you have it's actually tends to be

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.960 
that you have it's actually tends to be
more<00:01:09.780> durable<00:01:10.100> faster<00:01:11.100> and<00:01:11.369> better<00:01:11.850> than

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
more durable faster and better than

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.539 
more durable faster and better than
extruded<00:01:12.540> bases<00:01:12.930> so<00:01:13.200> in<00:01:13.710> most<00:01:13.860> cases<00:01:14.010> when<00:01:14.460> you

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
extruded bases so in most cases when you

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.120 
extruded bases so in most cases when you
see<00:01:14.760> a<00:01:14.790> snowball<00:01:15.299> with<00:01:15.570> a<00:01:15.659> sintered<00:01:15.960> base

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
see a snowball with a sintered base

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.510 
see a snowball with a sintered base
it'll<00:01:17.130> be<00:01:17.250> more<00:01:17.880> durable<00:01:18.150> you'll<00:01:19.080> be<00:01:19.200> faster

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
it'll be more durable you'll be faster

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.520 
it'll be more durable you'll be faster
will<00:01:20.520> absorb<00:01:20.909> wax<00:01:21.150> better<00:01:21.509> and<00:01:21.810> it's<00:01:22.290> just

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
will absorb wax better and it's just

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.859 
will absorb wax better and it's just
generally<00:01:22.650> a<00:01:23.009> better<00:01:23.369> base<00:01:23.700> than<00:01:24.150> extruded

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
generally a better base than extruded

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.899 
generally a better base than extruded
bases<00:01:25.200> but<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.560> downside<00:01:25.830> of<00:01:26.369> a<00:01:26.490> sintered

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
bases but the downside of a sintered

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.920 
bases but the downside of a sintered
base<00:01:26.939> is<00:01:27.450> that<00:01:28.290> it's<00:01:28.590> harder<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:29.729> maintain<00:01:30.540> and

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
base is that it's harder to maintain and

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.800 
base is that it's harder to maintain and
repair<00:01:31.799> so<00:01:32.130> it's<00:01:32.340> more<00:01:32.490> expensive<00:01:32.670> to<00:01:33.299> repair

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
repair so it's more expensive to repair

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.590 
repair so it's more expensive to repair
basically<00:01:34.350> but<00:01:35.189> outside<00:01:36.000> of<00:01:36.060> that<00:01:36.180> you

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
basically but outside of that you

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.840 
basically but outside of that you
generally<00:01:37.380> if<00:01:37.650> you<00:01:37.860> have<00:01:38.460> to<00:01:38.640> choose<00:01:38.820> between

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
generally if you have to choose between

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.640 
generally if you have to choose between
the<00:01:39.180> two<00:01:39.329> bases<00:01:39.659> you<00:01:39.780> always<00:01:40.049> want<00:01:40.259> a<00:01:40.320> sintered

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
the two bases you always want a sintered

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:41.990 
the two bases you always want a sintered
base<00:01:40.680> they're<00:01:41.220> just<00:01:41.430> they're<00:01:41.700> just<00:01:41.729> better

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
base they're just they're just better

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.830 
base they're just they're just better
bases<00:01:42.590> but<00:01:43.729> with<00:01:44.729> extruder<00:01:45.240> bases<00:01:45.659> you'll

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
bases but with extruder bases you'll

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.380 
bases but with extruder bases you'll
find<00:01:46.079> them<00:01:46.259> in<00:01:46.439> mid<00:01:46.920> to<00:01:47.189> low<00:01:47.399> end<00:01:47.729> snowboards

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
find them in mid to low end snowboards

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.420 
find them in mid to low end snowboards
typically<00:01:48.840> because<00:01:49.170> that's<00:01:49.470> where<00:01:50.040> companies

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
typically because that's where companies

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.700 
typically because that's where companies
put<00:01:51.180> that<00:01:51.329> base<00:01:51.509> on<00:01:51.780> those<00:01:51.990> snowballs<00:01:52.200> to<00:01:52.500> save

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
put that base on those snowballs to save

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.600 
put that base on those snowballs to save
a<00:01:52.740> bit<00:01:52.950> of<00:01:52.979> money<00:01:53.070> in<00:01:53.520> construction<00:01:53.700> costs<00:01:54.420> so

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
a bit of money in construction costs so

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.280 
a bit of money in construction costs so
extruded<00:01:56.610> bases<00:01:57.000> on<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.420> whole<00:01:57.570> aren't<00:01:58.140> as

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
extruded bases on the whole aren't as

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.649 
extruded bases on the whole aren't as
good<00:01:58.649> as<00:01:58.799> sintered<00:01:59.100> basis<00:01:59.460> but<00:01:59.729> the<00:02:00.030> upside<00:02:00.450> of

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
good as sintered basis but the upside of

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.690 
good as sintered basis but the upside of
them<00:02:00.990> is<00:02:01.409> although<00:02:01.979> they're<00:02:02.189> slow<00:02:02.460> and<00:02:02.490> and

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
them is although they're slow and and

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.670 
them is although they're slow and and
scented<00:02:03.030> bases<00:02:03.420> although<00:02:03.930> they<00:02:04.170> tend<00:02:04.200> to<00:02:04.530> be

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
scented bases although they tend to be

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.649 
scented bases although they tend to be
less<00:02:04.829> durable<00:02:05.310> than<00:02:05.369> scented<00:02:05.790> bases<00:02:06.149> they're

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
less durable than scented bases they're

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.029 
less durable than scented bases they're
easier<00:02:07.259> to<00:02:07.590> repair<00:02:08.550> if<00:02:08.789> they<00:02:09.060> get<00:02:09.239> damaged<00:02:09.660> so

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 
easier to repair if they get damaged so

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:11.920 
easier to repair if they get damaged so
maintaining<00:02:11.039> them<00:02:11.220> and

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
maintaining them and

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.660 
maintaining them and
pairing<00:02:12.140> them<00:02:12.260> is<00:02:12.409> a<00:02:12.439> lot<00:02:12.650> easier<00:02:12.890> than<00:02:13.609> a

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
pairing them is a lot easier than a

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.030 
pairing them is a lot easier than a
scented<00:02:14.120> base<00:02:14.299> so<00:02:15.140> that's<00:02:15.439> basically<00:02:15.859> the

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
scented base so that's basically the

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.459 
scented base so that's basically the
difference<00:02:16.159> between<00:02:16.549> the<00:02:16.790> two<00:02:17.030> bases<00:02:17.540> so<00:02:18.140> if

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:18.469 
difference between the two bases so if

00:02:18.469 --> 00:02:20.170 
difference between the two bases so if
you<00:02:18.620> get<00:02:18.769> confused<00:02:18.980> just<00:02:19.370> remember<00:02:19.819> scented

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
you get confused just remember scented

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:21.309 
you get confused just remember scented
bases<00:02:20.540> are<00:02:20.689> the<00:02:20.810> good<00:02:20.959> ones

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 
bases are the good ones

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:22.929 
bases are the good ones
yeah<00:02:21.469> there's<00:02:21.680> bases<00:02:22.129> that<00:02:22.280> you<00:02:22.340> want<00:02:22.670> in<00:02:22.819> your

00:02:22.929 --> 00:02:22.939 
yeah there's bases that you want in your

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:24.940 
yeah there's bases that you want in your
snowboard<00:02:23.390> but<00:02:23.659> you<00:02:23.750> typically<00:02:24.379> only<00:02:24.500> find

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
snowboard but you typically only find

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:26.559 
snowboard but you typically only find
them<00:02:25.069> in<00:02:25.129> mid<00:02:25.489> to<00:02:25.609> high-end<00:02:25.760> snowboards

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:26.569 
them in mid to high-end snowboards

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:29.530 
them in mid to high-end snowboards
extruded<00:02:27.560> bases<00:02:27.890> are<00:02:28.069> the<00:02:28.340> bases<00:02:28.760> in<00:02:28.939> the<00:02:29.299> mid

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
extruded bases are the bases in the mid

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.839 
extruded bases are the bases in the mid
to<00:02:29.719> low<00:02:29.900> end<00:02:30.139> snowboards<00:02:30.680> depending<00:02:31.129> on<00:02:31.250> what

00:02:31.839 --> 00:02:31.849 
to low end snowboards depending on what

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:33.399 
to low end snowboards depending on what
be<00:02:31.969> company<00:02:32.299> chooses<00:02:32.689> to<00:02:32.780> do<00:02:32.930> with<00:02:33.079> your<00:02:33.230> base

00:02:33.399 --> 00:02:33.409 
be company chooses to do with your base

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:35.619 
be company chooses to do with your base
materials<00:02:33.950> but<00:02:34.579> if<00:02:34.730> you<00:02:34.849> can<00:02:35.120> you<00:02:35.329> want<00:02:35.510> a

00:02:35.619 --> 00:02:35.629 
materials but if you can you want a

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:37.780 
materials but if you can you want a
sintered<00:02:36.079> base<00:02:36.109> in<00:02:36.560> your<00:02:36.680> snowboard<00:02:37.159> but

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
sintered base in your snowboard but

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:40.959 
sintered base in your snowboard but
don't<00:02:38.150> make<00:02:38.389> it<00:02:38.650> they'll<00:02:39.650> make<00:02:39.680> it<00:02:39.920> a<00:02:40.370> huge

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:40.969 
don't make it they'll make it a huge

00:02:40.969 --> 00:02:44.110 
don't make it they'll make it a huge
deal<00:02:41.239> where<00:02:41.599> all<00:02:42.230> extruded<00:02:43.189> bases<00:02:43.609> are

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 
deal where all extruded bases are

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.449 
deal where all extruded bases are
horrible<00:02:44.780> and<00:02:45.019> you<00:02:45.349> never<00:02:45.650> buy<00:02:45.889> a<00:02:45.919> snow<00:02:46.310> but

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
horrible and you never buy a snow but

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:48.159 
horrible and you never buy a snow but
with<00:02:46.549> an<00:02:46.669> extruded<00:02:47.060> base<00:02:47.209> that's<00:02:47.569> that's<00:02:48.079> just

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:48.169 
with an extruded base that's that's just

00:02:48.169 --> 00:02:50.740 
with an extruded base that's that's just
ridiculous<00:02:48.590> you<00:02:48.919> it's<00:02:49.639> just<00:02:49.879> another<00:02:50.419> factor

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
ridiculous you it's just another factor

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.770 
ridiculous you it's just another factor
that<00:02:51.049> factors<00:02:51.769> into<00:02:51.980> how<00:02:52.370> good<00:02:52.970> a<00:02:53.269> snowboard

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
that factors into how good a snowboard

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.839 
that factors into how good a snowboard
is<00:02:53.900> on<00:02:54.139> a<00:02:54.169> whole<00:02:54.530> but<00:02:55.010> there<00:02:55.340> are<00:02:55.430> plenty<00:02:55.669> of

00:02:55.839 --> 00:02:55.849 
is on a whole but there are plenty of

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:57.699 
is on a whole but there are plenty of
really<00:02:56.299> amazing<00:02:56.540> snow<00:02:56.900> blots<00:02:57.139> of<00:02:57.230> extruded

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
really amazing snow blots of extruded

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:01.780 
really amazing snow blots of extruded
bases<00:02:58.299> for<00:02:59.299> example<00:02:59.689> the<00:02:59.870> arbor<00:03:00.379> Westmark<00:03:01.340> I

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
bases for example the arbor Westmark I

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:05.020 
bases for example the arbor Westmark I
believe<00:03:02.180> is<00:03:02.419> on<00:03:02.870> a<00:03:02.930> scented<00:03:03.650> unscented<00:03:04.000> on<00:03:05.000> a

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
believe is on a scented unscented on a

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.509 
believe is on a scented unscented on a
extruded<00:03:05.780> base<00:03:05.870> this<00:03:06.169> year<00:03:06.349> and<00:03:06.560> they<00:03:07.219> changed

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:07.519 
extruded base this year and they changed

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:08.890 
extruded base this year and they changed
I'm<00:03:07.669> not<00:03:07.849> sure<00:03:07.969> why<00:03:08.120> they<00:03:08.269> changed<00:03:08.569> it<00:03:08.659> from<00:03:08.780> a

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:08.900 
I'm not sure why they changed it from a

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.659 
I'm not sure why they changed it from a
sintered<00:03:09.200> base<00:03:09.230> probably<00:03:09.739> the<00:03:09.889> safe<00:03:10.069> cost<00:03:10.340> but

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:10.669 
sintered base probably the safe cost but

00:03:10.669 --> 00:03:13.179 
sintered base probably the safe cost but
yeah<00:03:11.389> so<00:03:11.719> the<00:03:11.840> Alba<00:03:12.109> west<00:03:12.319> mark<00:03:12.560> and<00:03:12.769> blacklist

00:03:13.179 --> 00:03:13.189 
yeah so the Alba west mark and blacklist

00:03:13.189 --> 00:03:15.220 
yeah so the Alba west mark and blacklist
I<00:03:13.310> believe<00:03:13.579> extruded<00:03:14.329> basis<00:03:14.689> this<00:03:14.840> year<00:03:15.049> and

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
I believe extruded basis this year and

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.710 
I believe extruded basis this year and
that's<00:03:15.409> fine<00:03:15.620> I<00:03:15.919> mean<00:03:16.280> I<00:03:16.760> think<00:03:17.299> they'd<00:03:17.599> be

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
that's fine I mean I think they'd be

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:18.939 
that's fine I mean I think they'd be
better<00:03:17.900> with<00:03:18.049> sintered<00:03:18.349> bases<00:03:18.650> but<00:03:18.799> there's

00:03:18.939 --> 00:03:18.949 
better with sintered bases but there's

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:20.800 
better with sintered bases but there's
still<00:03:19.129> amazing<00:03:19.699> Park<00:03:19.940> snowboards<00:03:20.510> it's<00:03:20.659> still

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
still amazing Park snowboards it's still

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:22.089 
still amazing Park snowboards it's still
one<00:03:20.989> of<00:03:21.019> the<00:03:21.169> top<00:03:21.199> paths<00:03:21.590> to<00:03:21.709> know<00:03:21.799> what's<00:03:21.979> out

00:03:22.089 --> 00:03:22.099 
one of the top paths to know what's out

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:25.089 
one of the top paths to know what's out
there<00:03:22.159> so<00:03:22.549> don't<00:03:22.819> feel<00:03:23.000> like<00:03:23.560> if<00:03:24.560> it<00:03:24.769> has<00:03:24.949> an

00:03:25.089 --> 00:03:25.099 
there so don't feel like if it has an

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:27.280 
there so don't feel like if it has an
extruded<00:03:25.430> base<00:03:25.609> it<00:03:25.849> sucks<00:03:26.150> it's<00:03:26.659> that's<00:03:27.079> not

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
extruded base it sucks it's that's not

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.349 
extruded base it sucks it's that's not
true<00:03:27.470> it's<00:03:27.709> just<00:03:27.949> another<00:03:28.849> factor<00:03:29.239> that

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:29.359 
true it's just another factor that

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:31.539 
true it's just another factor that
factors<00:03:29.689> in<00:03:29.870> so<00:03:30.109> remember<00:03:30.560> extruded<00:03:31.159> bases

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:31.549 
factors in so remember extruded bases

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:36.490 
factors in so remember extruded bases
the<00:03:32.030> cheaper<00:03:32.510> but<00:03:33.379> less<00:03:33.769> durable<00:03:34.449> less<00:03:35.500> speed

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
the cheaper but less durable less speed

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.610 
the cheaper but less durable less speed
and<00:03:37.209> easier<00:03:38.209> to<00:03:38.569> maintain<00:03:38.810> and<00:03:39.169> repair<00:03:39.409> but

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
and easier to maintain and repair but

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.589 
and easier to maintain and repair but
the<00:03:39.650> sintered<00:03:40.040> bases<00:03:40.340> are<00:03:40.519> the<00:03:40.639> faster<00:03:41.389> ones

00:03:41.589 --> 00:03:41.599 
the sintered bases are the faster ones

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:43.990 
the sintered bases are the faster ones
but<00:03:42.139> they're<00:03:42.259> more<00:03:42.439> expensive<00:03:43.069> and<00:03:43.430> you're

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
but they're more expensive and you're

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.999 
but they're more expensive and you're
harder<00:03:44.269> to<00:03:44.419> repair<00:03:44.720> and<00:03:44.959> more<00:03:45.409> durable<00:03:45.709> as

00:03:45.999 --> 00:03:46.009 
harder to repair and more durable as

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:47.830 
harder to repair and more durable as
well<00:03:46.220> so<00:03:46.549> those<00:03:46.849> are<00:03:47.060> the<00:03:47.209> pluses<00:03:47.629> and<00:03:47.659> minuses

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
well so those are the pluses and minuses

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.559 
well so those are the pluses and minuses
of<00:03:48.259> each<00:03:48.769> type<00:03:49.040> of<00:03:49.069> snow<00:03:49.400> at<00:03:49.549> base<00:03:49.729> hope<00:03:50.359> that

00:03:50.559 --> 00:03:50.569 
of each type of snow at base hope that

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:52.629
