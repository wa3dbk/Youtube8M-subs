 dear friends please do not buy if 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.200
 they do not need to remember that Mexico and the

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.010
 we Mexicans are aware not 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.260
 spend what they do not have for God's sake 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.660
 I ask you and let's go running with the 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.250
 cream cheese fondant recipe 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.920
 that if you have a very simple recipe 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.350
 very rich and how well do you say it for 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.000
 vary a bit in the flavors very well 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.590
 we are going to need the following 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.150
 ingredients for cheese fondant 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:04.030
 cream about 220 grams of cream cheese

 900 grams of sugar glas a little more a 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.540
 little less you have to remember that 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.490
 depending on the brand each one brings a 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.380
 different degree of humidity and a degree 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.780
 also of different corn starch 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.210
 then there varies a little bit if average 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.940
 scoop of smc that can also 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:22.240
 use as of taylos or failing gum 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:25.330
 swallow song and we will also need 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.640
 50 grams of good shortening 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:30.470
 quality 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.890

 perfect glycerin you told us the 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.530
 ingredients did not say it flying

 icing sugar half teaspoon cmc 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.610
 otay caught them gum swallows song 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.380
 any of the three yes they know him 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.929
 you can find it in any store 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:11.570
 who sells items for implements 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:13.459
 for pastry all this in about 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:14.930
 places in the center in the market of 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:17.600
 Santa Teresa supplies can 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.430
 find fmf really very economical is 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.380
 practically the same as the stem does not 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.060
 I recommend applying paint 32 but 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:26.480
 that this month is perfect that good 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:29.240
 you do not say it and we are also going to need 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.530
 50 grams of good shortening 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:34.459
 quality 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:37.100
 50 grams of 5 milliliter corn starch 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:39.650
 of transparent vanilla essence and 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:42.380
 very important this exact and that check 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.720
 that is also of good quality yes 25 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:49.360
 grams of honey of a flavor corn 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.360
 natural and 25 milliliters 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:53.970
 we perfectly have the ingredients 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:54.750
 how are we going to do very well as it is 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.000
 very easy 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:00.000
 and first let's mix our sugar 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.950
 glas with the starch of corn and the cms very 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.750
 important to mix the cmc with the sugar 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.030
 glas because if you're not going to do it 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.880
 groups but it's very important 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.680
 already after here we are going to divide in 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:13.590
 two equal parts and we're going to do them 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:17.340
 very true this is full here we are going to 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:19.140
 Take the cream cheese and we're going 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.530
 to work we will think about it and we are going 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:25.350
 take 15 to 15 seconds until 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.910
 be completely smooth truth I would 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:29.160
 I recommend that you take it out hours before 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:30.959
 because if not the protein starts to 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.180
 break down so it's wrong is 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:35.819
 better get us out of refrigeration leave it 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.860
 save the rest and 15 in 15 seconds 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:39.180
 and soften it so do not break the 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.580
 Cold chain 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.650
 Third exactly here and until 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:45.360
 it is creamy and smooth we are going to place it 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.860
 in the seasoning of the blender with 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.650
 shovel attachment 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:53.100
 we're going to mix it at low speed with 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:55.739
 shortening and half the sugar 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:57.810
 ok then let's start working at 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:59.700
 low speed because because if you do not 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.230
 will blow us all the powder what 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.690
 can do there is also to place a 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:06.049
 wet cloth around so you do not 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.049
 them one 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:12.450
 after here we are going to add little to 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:14.209
 little honey mail glycerin the 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:17.549
 vanilla 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:19.950
 perfectly and already after this step 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:22.710
 let's remove the mixer from the blender 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:25.260
 on a perfectly clean table and 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:28.260
 with the help of the scraper we will add the 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:31.470
 rest of the sugar gradually until 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:33.900
 form a uniform paste here is very 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:35.700
 important that they add little to 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.710
 a little like that they have 50 grams left 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:39.600
 and so until it was perfect seeing it 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:41.640
 add the rest because if it is not going to 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.200
 reflect the product a lot if you have 

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:45.150
 whole reason here I believe that the 

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:48.240
 people who already work the fondant and 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:50.760
 they know the exact point the texture and everything 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:52.740
 but people who are new or 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:54.600
 beginners because there are also gentlemen 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:56.449
 that are already handling the pastry and 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:59.539
 everything that entails good 

00:04:56.449 --> 00:05:02.050
 Be cautious start day - like you 

00:04:59.539 --> 00:05:04.520
 you say and in case you have any doubt 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:07.400
 reread read again the 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:10.639
 ingredients check even tutorials 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:14.539
 in different places so that with the 

00:05:10.639 --> 00:05:17.240
 sight with the ear with its five senses 

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:18.830
 good they can achieve the success of a 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:21.020
 recipe because your recipes are always 

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:23.059
 Exactly they are always very complete very 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:25.219
 well balanced but as you say 

00:05:23.059 --> 00:05:27.050
 also common sense and a little bit of 

00:05:25.219 --> 00:05:29.569
 practice does not mean that we are 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:31.460
 teachers not exactly and especially that 

00:05:29.569 --> 00:05:33.499
 they also vary in ingredients 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:35.689
 ingredients as I told you in 

00:05:33.499 --> 00:05:38.810
 the beginning of the degree of humidity of each 

00:05:35.689 --> 00:05:41.419
 different place if and sift the before 

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:43.669
 as it also always tells us now 

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:46.490
 sugar quality sometimes glas brand 

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:48.919
 brand is different also try 

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:51.649
 Buy a brand of very good quality 

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:53.479
 so that it is white because if it is not going to 

00:05:51.649 --> 00:05:55.760
 get brown I people 

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:59.270
 I recommend this brand that also 

00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:01.160
 I will have rice and beans is a very brand 

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:03.710
 known from a green dietitian 

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:05.840
 of very good quality as the colony 

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:08.540
 where are we here exactly 

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:09.980
 lety yes yes exactly with that they are going to 

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:11.930
 get very good results in what 

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:14.600
 personal and what I try to live 

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:17.240
 perfectly some valley out there by 

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:18.950
 the southern valleys at once is exactly 

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:21.320
 the fate that there is in the right day of 

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:24.020
 here very important we will cover with 

00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:25.790
 a clean bag or else we 're going to 

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:27.020
 cover with adhesive plastics and very 

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:29.270
 important let's take the 

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:31.160
 cooling for at least eight hours to 

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:33.980
 stabilize thank you but will continue 

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:36.020
 constant this fondant has obviously 

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:38.740
 for protein a shorter life time 

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:42.110
 it is kept refrigerated for a month 

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:44.120
 here for example they asked me some 

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:46.010
 people can be used then for 

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:48.410
 use the pill with the famous 

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:50.270
 rubber paste I do not recommend them 

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:54.240
 because it has a higher degree of fat 

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:56.770
 perfect details to cover cookies 

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:58.360
 but I do not recommend them that 

00:06:56.770 --> 00:07:00.699
 keep at room temperature because 

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:02.919
 we are handling proteins because they 

00:07:00.699 --> 00:07:04.629
 we usually do with the other fondant 

00:07:02.919 --> 00:07:06.879
 that we have only the protein of the 

00:07:04.629 --> 00:07:09.279
 creatine but anyway if this is like 

00:07:06.879 --> 00:07:11.740
 to make him use it and eat it 

00:07:09.279 --> 00:07:13.360
 and richer I think that this if not what 

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:15.909
 we leave or we remove this if we do not 

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:18.430
 we eat everything does not have a very rich flavor 

00:07:15.909 --> 00:07:20.199
 very delicate if it's sweet because the 

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:22.270
 true that sweet but feels the flavor 

00:07:20.199 --> 00:07:24.340
 of the cheese and gives another flavor a 

00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:26.139
 toquecito different out there think 

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:27.639
 an idea that I am going to comment on and you 

00:07:26.139 --> 00:07:28.960
 you think expert so then see if the 

00:07:27.639 --> 00:07:30.669
 you can say I know you're going to 

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:32.319
 develop but then he told you 

00:07:30.669 --> 00:07:34.569
 artur we ran out of time where 

00:07:32.319 --> 00:07:36.340
 we can find clear tea that if I 

00:07:34.569 --> 00:07:36.909
