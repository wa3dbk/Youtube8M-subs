good netcode good level design fix your

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.969 
good netcode good level design fix your
fucking<00:04:56.389> audio<00:04:56.720> and<00:04:57.020> also<00:04:57.530> let's<00:04:57.680> talk<00:04:57.860> about

00:04:57.969 --> 00:04:57.979 
fucking audio and also let's talk about

00:04:57.979 --> 00:05:01.240 
fucking audio and also let's talk about
skill<00:04:58.550> based<00:04:58.729> matchmaking<00:04:59.080> ok<00:05:00.080> I<00:05:00.289> think<00:05:00.979> that

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:01.250 
skill based matchmaking ok I think that

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:03.670 
skill based matchmaking ok I think that
school<00:05:01.639> based<00:05:01.789> matchmaking<00:05:02.380> would<00:05:03.380> make

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:03.680 
school based matchmaking would make

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.950 
school based matchmaking would make
sense<00:05:03.949> but<00:05:04.190> you<00:05:04.280> have<00:05:04.460> to<00:05:04.639> like<00:05:04.960> appropriate

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:05.960 
sense but you have to like appropriate

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:08.469 
sense but you have to like appropriate
it<00:05:06.110> with<00:05:06.229> connection<00:05:06.830> ok<00:05:07.310> I<00:05:07.490> think<00:05:07.940> they<00:05:08.300> need

00:05:08.469 --> 00:05:08.479 
it with connection ok I think they need

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:10.120 
it with connection ok I think they need
to<00:05:08.510> look<00:05:08.930> at<00:05:09.139> it<00:05:09.320> they<00:05:09.440> need<00:05:09.590> to<00:05:09.680> realize<00:05:10.099> that

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:10.130 
to look at it they need to realize that

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:12.610 
to look at it they need to realize that
connection<00:05:10.880> not<00:05:11.389> only<00:05:11.570> is<00:05:11.779> it<00:05:11.900> a<00:05:11.990> local<00:05:12.380> thing

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:12.620 
connection not only is it a local thing

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:14.090 
connection not only is it a local thing
but<00:05:13.340> it's<00:05:13.550> also

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:14.100 
but it's also

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:16.040 
but it's also
a thing<00:05:14.430> as<00:05:14.670> Internet<00:05:15.150> service<00:05:15.420> providers<00:05:15.840> I

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.050 
a thing as Internet service providers I

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:17.480 
a thing as Internet service providers I
might<00:05:16.500> have<00:05:16.680> someone<00:05:16.920> down<00:05:17.100> the<00:05:17.220> street<00:05:17.460> that

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:17.490 
might have someone down the street that

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:20.150 
might have someone down the street that
uses<00:05:17.850> like<00:05:18.090> dish<00:05:18.660> network<00:05:19.140> while<00:05:19.740> i'm<00:05:19.890> using
