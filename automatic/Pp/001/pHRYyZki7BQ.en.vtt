 Samara there is such a read I wrote there 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.450
 tells how to protect your 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:16.209
 vehicle from theft and there 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:19.750
 item is spelled out one that all rome 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:21.900
 close the windows do not leave things to 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:25.660
 not attract thereby provoke 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:27.459
 criminals, and certainly not any way 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.650
 don't leave your keys in the ignition 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:31.390
 here so data inspectors I do not know 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.610
 it is possible and knowledge is not covered 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:38.770

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:39.370
 gbdd means drivers call for data 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:44.370
 by action 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:47.470
 so that the crime itself employees 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:51.030
 road patrol strips 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.030
