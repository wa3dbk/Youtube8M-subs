that<00:02:11.519> protein<00:02:12.890> the<00:02:13.890> world<00:02:14.099> is<00:02:14.310> suspect<00:02:14.959> this

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
that protein the world is suspect this

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:19.309 
that protein the world is suspect this
is<00:02:16.140> that<00:02:16.380> or<00:02:17.099> young<00:02:17.660> natural<00:02:18.660> chocolates<00:02:19.080> or

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
is that or young natural chocolates or

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.589 
is that or young natural chocolates or
where<00:02:19.620> it<00:02:19.709> should<00:02:19.920> be<00:02:19.950> good<00:02:20.269> just<00:02:21.269> get<00:02:21.480> the

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599 
where it should be good just get the

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:26.949 
where it should be good just get the
scoop<00:02:21.900> and<00:02:23.930> one<00:02:24.930> scoop<00:02:25.260> in<00:02:25.440> the<00:02:25.470> magic<00:02:26.160> bullet

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
scoop and one scoop in the magic bullet

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:29.839 
scoop and one scoop in the magic bullet
and<00:02:27.959> it's<00:02:28.110> up<00:02:28.260> to<00:02:28.440> you<00:02:28.560> you<00:02:28.709> can<00:02:28.769> have<00:02:29.040> up<00:02:29.250> to<00:02:29.280> a

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:29.849 
and it's up to you you can have up to a

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:33.680 
and it's up to you you can have up to a
stack<00:02:30.920> particular<00:02:31.920> protein<00:02:32.430> is<00:02:32.700> you<00:02:33.510> just

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
stack particular protein is you just

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.000 
stack particular protein is you just
read<00:02:33.900> the<00:02:35.810> label<00:02:36.810> here<00:02:37.019> it's<00:02:37.260> a<00:02:37.349> hundred<00:02:37.860> and

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
read the label here it's a hundred and

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:43.009 
read the label here it's a hundred and
twenty<00:02:38.580> calories<00:02:39.680> one<00:02:40.680> scoop<00:02:40.980> is<00:02:41.330> C<00:02:42.330> 30.4

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
twenty calories one scoop is C 30.4

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:46.130 
twenty calories one scoop is C 30.4
grams<00:02:43.349> and<00:02:43.709> it<00:02:44.040> has<00:02:44.280> a<00:02:44.640> fairly<00:02:45.150> good<00:02:45.569> protein

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
grams and it has a fairly good protein

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:52.850 
grams and it has a fairly good protein
of<00:02:46.319> 24<00:02:46.739> grams<00:02:50.060> so<00:02:51.060> we'll<00:02:51.530> let's<00:02:52.530> good<00:02:52.709> all

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
of 24 grams so we'll let's good all

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.009 
of 24 grams so we'll let's good all
around<00:02:52.890> that<00:02:53.400> protein<00:02:53.849> now<00:02:54.360> what<00:02:54.540> I<00:02:54.569> might<00:02:54.750> do

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
around that protein now what I might do

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:57.259 
around that protein now what I might do
is<00:02:55.049> just<00:02:55.560> a<00:02:55.799> tad<00:02:56.130> bit<00:02:56.160> of<00:02:56.430> milk<00:02:56.579> I'll<00:02:57.000> put<00:02:57.180> the

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
is just a tad bit of milk I'll put the

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:59.809 
is just a tad bit of milk I'll put the
bed<00:02:57.420> and<00:02:57.569> in<00:02:57.750> just<00:02:58.290> whack<00:02:58.470> it<00:02:58.500> in<00:02:58.709> add<00:02:59.519> a<00:02:59.579> bit<00:02:59.790> of

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
milk and of course yogurt 3 i'll do the

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:15.460

precise measurement at the table student
at<00:03:24.000> that<00:03:24.209> food<00:03:24.450> as<00:03:24.600> well<00:03:25.549> that's<00:03:26.549> good<00:03:26.850> for<00:03:27.000> the

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
at that food as well that's good for the

at that food as well that's good for the
skin<00:03:27.209> in<00:03:27.480> the<00:03:27.569> hair<00:03:29.030> and<00:03:30.920> you<00:03:31.920> can<00:03:32.040> either<00:03:32.160> put

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
skin in the hair and you can either put

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:38.490 
skin in the hair and you can either put
an<00:03:32.609> egg<00:03:32.850> in<00:03:33.090> there<00:03:33.329> I<00:03:33.569> want<00:03:33.930> to<00:03:33.989> do<00:03:34.049> an<00:03:34.170> egg

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.589 

you<00:03:39.500> can<00:03:39.650> almost<00:03:39.800> live<00:03:40.190> off<00:03:40.370> this<00:03:40.580> this<00:03:41.209> this

00:03:41.589 --> 00:03:41.599 
you can almost live off this this this

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:44.350 
you can almost live off this this this
is<00:03:41.810> almost<00:03:42.050> like<00:03:42.170> meal<00:03:42.500> replacement<00:03:43.360> now

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:44.360 
is almost like meal replacement now

let's see what else I've got honey but I

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:48.040 
let's see what else I've got honey but I
might<00:03:46.580> skip<00:03:46.849> the<00:03:47.000> money<00:03:47.209> today<00:03:47.510> because<00:03:47.900> I've

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:48.050 
might skip the money today because I've

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:49.360 
might skip the money today because I've
got<00:03:48.200> the<00:03:48.319> maple<00:03:48.650> search<00:03:48.860> so<00:03:49.040> you<00:03:49.099> can<00:03:49.250> actually

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
got the maple search so you can actually

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.280 
got the maple search so you can actually
have<00:03:49.760> money<00:03:49.940> of<00:03:50.209> you<00:03:50.420> don't<00:03:50.599> have<00:03:50.750> maple<00:03:50.900> syrup

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290 
have money of you don't have maple syrup

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:54.130 
have money of you don't have maple syrup
and<00:03:52.030> precise<00:03:53.030> measurement<00:03:53.540> of<00:03:53.630> these<00:03:53.840> that

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:54.140 
and precise measurement of these that

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:58.809 
and precise measurement of these that
antioxidant<00:03:55.450> berry<00:03:56.450> mix<00:03:56.690> and<00:03:57.640> these<00:03:58.640> are

00:03:58.809 --> 00:03:58.819 
antioxidant berry mix and these are

00:03:58.819 --> 00:04:00.190 
antioxidant berry mix and these are
frozen<00:03:59.090> so<00:03:59.450> they're<00:03:59.630> actually<00:04:00.019> going<00:04:00.110> to

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.200 
frozen so they're actually going to

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.940 
frozen so they're actually going to
taste<00:04:00.650> really<00:04:00.860> nice<00:04:01.190> ok<00:04:02.440> let's<00:04:03.440> see<00:04:03.650> you<00:04:03.800> put

taste really nice ok let's see you put
the<00:04:04.069> lid<00:04:04.280> on<00:04:04.310> now<00:04:04.730> this<00:04:04.940> this<00:04:04.970> little<00:04:05.390> gadget

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:05.660 
the lid on now this this little gadget

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:07.750 
the lid on now this this little gadget
has<00:04:05.959> the<00:04:06.230> bottom<00:04:07.010> is<00:04:07.099> actually<00:04:07.280> that<00:04:07.610> you<00:04:07.640> have

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 
has the bottom is actually that you have

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.520 
has the bottom is actually that you have
ways<00:04:08.060> for<00:04:08.300> the<00:04:08.390> blender<00:04:08.690> so<00:04:08.870> to<00:04:08.930> screw<00:04:09.290> that<00:04:09.470> on

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
ways for the blender so to screw that on

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:11.440 
ways for the blender so to screw that on
I<00:04:09.860> think<00:04:10.130> I<00:04:10.280> had<00:04:10.400> one<00:04:10.580> that<00:04:10.730> filled<00:04:11.000> it<00:04:11.120> up<00:04:11.209> two

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:11.450 
I think I had one that filled it up two

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:13.410 
I think I had one that filled it up two
months<00:04:11.750> let's<00:04:11.930> go<00:04:12.049> to<00:04:12.110> make<00:04:12.260> a<00:04:12.290> funny<00:04:12.560> Sarah

flavor yummy so this is got gluto as

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:46.260 
flavor yummy so this is got gluto as
well<00:04:42.880> its<00:04:43.240> got<00:04:43.450> maple<00:04:44.140> syrup<00:04:45.060> natural<00:04:46.060> protein

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.270 
well its got maple syrup natural protein

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.440 
well its got maple syrup natural protein
which<00:04:46.840> is<00:04:46.870> the<00:04:47.140> optimum<00:04:47.590> nutrition<00:04:47.830> and<00:04:48.450> now

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:49.450 
which is the optimum nutrition and now

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:52.950 
which is the optimum nutrition and now
see<00:04:49.930> I<00:04:50.880> did<00:04:51.880> put<00:04:52.060> in<00:04:52.180> yogurt<00:04:52.570> but<00:04:52.690> it's<00:04:52.810> got

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:52.960 
see I did put in yogurt but it's got

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.410
