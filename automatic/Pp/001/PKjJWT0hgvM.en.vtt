 hello welcome to our channel be 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.340
 a year today we talk to you about a 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.080
 new play super cute a future 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.059
 great big success in families to 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.910
 Christmas is a little bird 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.619
 it is aimed at children from 4 to 8 in 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.440
 movement right away how he 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.930
 therefore works its first function at this 

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:28.560
 little bird and that of chantilly 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.450
 so we put it on the hot position and we 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.590
 stroking each other's back and they get 

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:39.090
 give way to desire and more a caress 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:41.630
 and then he sang the field sphere 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.630
 different 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.649
 that's the second function that has nothing 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.810
 to see it's a repetition function 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.820
 in fact but who if there is a small 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:53.030
 button and this little button is used to 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:57.320
 save what means for example 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.320
 this little bird is beautiful 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:05.930
 I'm still trying this little bird is 15 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.930
 euros 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:15.990
 you saw it works great super good 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:17.609
 alright then this little bird rice la 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:19.439
 pelota for the first time things 

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:21.029
 it is extremely cute and 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.469
 on the shelf you find eight 

00:01:21.029 --> 00:01:24.749
 different so has something for everyone 

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:26.249
 the second reason is that the function 

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:29.350
 recording it really works 

00:01:26.249 --> 00:01:32.860
 super good so the songs 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:34.720
 very nice all right there frankly everything 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.549
 well he has only one small point that is 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.320
 not related to the bird that there is actually 

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:40.930
 to products that is sold since it 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.640
 also offers a separate bird cage 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:43.899
 we find that the cage does not have much 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.890
 of interest since the bird works 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:46.780
 as you have it in the hands of 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.040

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.860

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:59.110

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.610
