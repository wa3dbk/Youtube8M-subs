00:00:46.869 --> 00:00:46.879 
Laurinaitis that kind of sounds like an

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:48.610 
Laurinaitis that kind of sounds like an
oxymoron<00:00:47.000> because<00:00:47.720> who<00:00:48.020> the<00:00:48.320> would<00:00:48.440> want

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:48.620 
oxymoron because who the would want

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.340 
oxymoron because who the would want
to<00:00:48.710> John<00:00:48.890> Laurinaitis<00:00:49.280> figure<00:00:49.730> but<00:00:50.230> the<00:00:51.230> only

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350 
to John Laurinaitis figure but the only

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.140 
to John Laurinaitis figure but the only
reason<00:00:51.650> I<00:00:51.710> collected<00:00:52.040> this<00:00:52.190> set<00:00:52.430> is<00:00:52.580> because

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:53.150 
reason I collected this set is because

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:54.630 
reason I collected this set is because
all<00:00:53.300> four<00:00:53.330> figures<00:00:53.780> are<00:00:54.050> pretty<00:00:54.290> awesome

series<00:01:00.489> Christian<00:01:01.600> what<00:01:02.600> a<00:01:02.629> big

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:03.409 
series Christian what a big

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:06.670 
series Christian what a big
painting<00:01:03.650> is<00:01:04.010> this<00:01:04.370> was<00:01:04.640> to<00:01:04.879> find<00:01:05.320> he<00:01:06.320> was<00:01:06.440> only

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
painting is this was to find he was only

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.660 
painting is this was to find he was only
really<00:01:06.830> like<00:01:07.780> 11<00:01:08.780> in<00:01:08.960> a<00:01:09.050> box<00:01:09.290> so<00:01:10.190> this<00:01:10.520> was

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:10.670 
really like 11 in a box so this was

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.390 
really like 11 in a box so this was
particularly<00:01:11.000> hard<00:01:11.210> to<00:01:11.570> hunt<00:01:11.780> down<00:01:11.990> I<00:01:12.590> feel<00:01:13.370> a

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:13.400 
particularly hard to hunt down I feel a

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.149 
particularly hard to hunt down I feel a
big<00:01:13.760> a<00:01:14.030> big<00:01:14.420> reason<00:01:14.630> for<00:01:14.840> that<00:01:15.020> was<00:01:15.170> because<00:01:15.620> he

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:16.159 
big a big reason for that was because he

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:18.460 
big a big reason for that was because he
comes<00:01:16.340> with<00:01:16.520> the<00:01:16.729> new<00:01:17.240> white<00:01:18.049> strap

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470

variation really well done I like it a
lot<00:01:27.520> a<00:01:28.520> lot<00:01:28.939> of<00:01:29.060> people<00:01:29.180> were<00:01:29.299> kind<00:01:29.509> of<00:01:29.689> set

00:01:29.889 --> 00:01:29.899

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:33.079 
seen as he was the one who reintroduced

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:35.800 
seen as he was the one who reintroduced
this<00:01:33.439> I<00:01:33.829> mean<00:01:34.729> shouldn't<00:01:35.000> say<00:01:35.210> reintroduced

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
this I mean shouldn't say reintroduced

this I mean shouldn't say reintroduced
it's<00:01:36.020> really<00:01:36.649> a<00:01:36.680> new<00:01:37.070> design<00:01:37.670> about<00:01:38.030> with<00:01:38.390> the

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
it's really a new design about with the

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:41.410 
it's really a new design about with the
w/e<00:01:38.960> logos<00:01:39.320> but<00:01:39.530> the<00:01:40.340> overall<00:01:40.609> design<00:01:40.880> is

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
w/e logos but the overall design is

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:42.940 
w/e logos but the overall design is
based<00:01:41.570> on<00:01:41.750> the<00:01:41.869> classic<00:01:42.020> Intercontinental

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
based on the classic Intercontinental

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:44.289 
based on the classic Intercontinental
title<00:01:42.979> so<00:01:43.369> a<00:01:43.399> lot<00:01:43.700> of<00:01:43.729> people<00:01:43.820> felt<00:01:44.180> that

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:44.299 
title so a lot of people felt that

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:45.789 
title so a lot of people felt that
probably<00:01:44.659> should<00:01:44.840> have<00:01:44.899> come<00:01:45.049> with<00:01:45.079> a<00:01:45.229> lead<00:01:45.469> 20

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:45.799 
probably should have come with a lead 20
