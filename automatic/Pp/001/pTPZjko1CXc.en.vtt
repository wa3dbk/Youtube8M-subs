you'll<00:02:03.810> see<00:02:04.079> that<00:02:04.789> if<00:02:05.789> you<00:02:05.909> get<00:02:06.090> a<00:02:06.119> little<00:02:06.359> bit

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
you'll see that if you get a little bit

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.169 
you'll see that if you get a little bit
of<00:02:06.630> movement<00:02:07.109> on<00:02:07.289> the<00:02:07.439> inside<00:02:07.799> but<00:02:08.489> the<00:02:08.640> p90

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
of movement on the inside but the p90

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.690 
of movement on the inside but the p90
gives<00:02:09.390> me<00:02:09.509> significantly<00:02:10.019> more<00:02:10.709> so<00:02:11.370> the<00:02:11.459> black

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
gives me significantly more so the black

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.990 
gives me significantly more so the black
and<00:02:11.910> white<00:02:12.090> wires<00:02:12.480> are<00:02:12.840> actually<00:02:13.700> the<00:02:14.700> screw

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
and white wires are actually the screw

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.509 
and white wires are actually the screw
coils<00:02:15.480> and<00:02:15.980> the<00:02:16.980> outside<00:02:17.400> coils<00:02:18.620> now<00:02:19.620> on<00:02:20.010> the

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:20.519 
coils and the outside coils now on the

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:26.660 
coils and the outside coils now on the
red<00:02:20.760> and<00:02:21.090> green<00:02:21.480> pair<00:02:24.920> I'm<00:02:25.920> gonna<00:02:26.129> wire<00:02:26.370> those

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
red and green pair I'm gonna wire those

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:32.990 
red and green pair I'm gonna wire those
red<00:02:27.360> hot<00:02:27.720> green<00:02:28.440> ground<00:02:30.049> now<00:02:31.049> you<00:02:31.110> see<00:02:31.970> quite<00:02:32.970> a

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
red hot green ground now you see quite a

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.839 
red hot green ground now you see quite a
bit<00:02:33.150> more<00:02:33.360> change<00:02:34.290> there<00:02:34.590> with<00:02:35.010> the<00:02:35.250> the<00:02:35.670> rail

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:35.849 
bit more change there with the the rail

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:40.569 
bit more change there with the the rail
and<00:02:36.450> that<00:02:37.110> p90<00:02:37.680> does<00:02:37.860> pretty<00:02:38.400> much<00:02:38.579> nothing<00:02:38.819> so

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:40.579 
and that p90 does pretty much nothing so

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:44.240 
and that p90 does pretty much nothing so
it<00:02:41.579> is<00:02:42.290> kind<00:02:43.290> of<00:02:43.319> the<00:02:43.410> reverse<00:02:43.560> of<00:02:43.950> what<00:02:44.010> you

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
it is kind of the reverse of what you

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:45.680 
it is kind of the reverse of what you
would<00:02:44.370> expect<00:02:44.670> from<00:02:44.910> a<00:02:45.060> Seymour<00:02:45.510> Duncan

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
would expect from a Seymour Duncan

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.470 
would expect from a Seymour Duncan
pickup<00:02:46.230> and<00:02:46.470> then<00:02:47.340> when<00:02:48.090> you<00:02:48.180> start<00:02:48.239> looking

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
pickup and then when you start looking

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.110 
pickup and then when you start looking
at<00:02:48.750> magnetic<00:02:49.170> polarity<00:02:49.760> things<00:02:50.760> get<00:02:50.970> a<00:02:51.000> little

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
at magnetic polarity things get a little

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.589 
at magnetic polarity things get a little
dicey<00:02:51.360> err<00:02:52.340> I'm<00:02:53.340> gonna<00:02:53.579> guess<00:02:53.970> I'm<00:02:54.299> not<00:02:54.480> quite

00:02:54.589 --> 00:02:54.599 
dicey err I'm gonna guess I'm not quite

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:56.780 
dicey err I'm gonna guess I'm not quite
sure<00:02:54.720> how<00:02:54.989> they've<00:02:55.200> constructed<00:02:56.040> this<00:02:56.519> but

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
sure how they've constructed this but

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.280 
sure how they've constructed this but
typically<00:02:57.209> in<00:02:57.450> a<00:02:57.569> something<00:02:57.930> that<00:02:58.019> looks<00:02:58.230> like

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
typically in a something that looks like

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.610 
typically in a something that looks like
a<00:02:58.410> humbucker<00:02:58.980> you'd<00:02:59.250> have<00:02:59.400> a<00:02:59.430> flat<00:02:59.730> bar<00:03:00.060> magnet

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
a humbucker you'd have a flat bar magnet

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.509 
a humbucker you'd have a flat bar magnet
between<00:03:01.620> these<00:03:01.860> two<00:03:02.160> and<00:03:03.620> the<00:03:04.620> magnetic

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
between these two and the magnetic

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:07.190 
between these two and the magnetic
polarity<00:03:05.730> s<00:03:05.970> would<00:03:06.090> be<00:03:06.180> the<00:03:06.299> edges<00:03:06.690> that<00:03:06.900> one's

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
polarity s would be the edges that one's

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.720 
polarity s would be the edges that one's
one<00:03:07.470> edge<00:03:07.680> would<00:03:07.799> be<00:03:07.859> in<00:03:08.069> north<00:03:08.310> and<00:03:08.489> one<00:03:08.609> edge

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
one edge would be in north and one edge

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.090 
one edge would be in north and one edge
would<00:03:08.850> be<00:03:08.970> a<00:03:09.000> South<00:03:09.269> on<00:03:10.049> a<00:03:10.139> typical<00:03:10.440> single

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
would be a South on a typical single

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.690 
would be a South on a typical single
coil<00:03:11.519> it's<00:03:12.420> actually<00:03:13.079> the<00:03:13.889> pole<00:03:14.100> pieces<00:03:14.549> out

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
coil it's actually the pole pieces out

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.190 
coil it's actually the pole pieces out
of<00:03:14.730> the<00:03:14.880> magnets<00:03:15.269> so<00:03:15.450> you<00:03:15.480> kind<00:03:15.900> of<00:03:15.959> check

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
of the magnets so you kind of check

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.470 
of the magnets so you kind of check
those<00:03:16.410> differently<00:03:16.889> by<00:03:17.069> checking<00:03:17.549> them<00:03:17.819> this

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
those differently by checking them this

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.930 
those differently by checking them this
way<00:03:18.660> rather<00:03:18.900> than<00:03:19.139> on<00:03:19.230> the<00:03:19.350> edges<00:03:19.709> this<00:03:20.700> seems

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
way rather than on the edges this seems

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.940 
way rather than on the edges this seems
to<00:03:21.060> be<00:03:21.120> kind<00:03:21.389> of<00:03:21.450> a<00:03:21.540> combination<00:03:22.079> of<00:03:22.530> things

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
to be kind of a combination of things

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.729 
to be kind of a combination of things
the<00:03:23.130> way<00:03:23.250> the<00:03:23.790> way<00:03:24.600> the<00:03:24.720> compass<00:03:25.049> responds<00:03:25.590> to

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
the way the way the compass responds to

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:28.729 
the way the way the compass responds to
it<00:03:25.829> in<00:03:25.980> this<00:03:26.519> room<00:03:26.819> North<00:03:27.600> is<00:03:27.959> kind<00:03:28.380> of<00:03:28.500> that

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
it in this room North is kind of that

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:32.809 
it in this room North is kind of that
way<00:03:29.690> earth<00:03:30.690> North<00:03:31.079> is<00:03:31.380> that<00:03:31.410> way<00:03:31.790> which<00:03:32.790> is

00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:32.819 
way earth North is that way which is

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:37.309 
way earth North is that way which is
pointing<00:03:33.299> to<00:03:33.389> a<00:03:33.420> South<00:03:33.690> magnet<00:03:35.780> and<00:03:36.780> if<00:03:36.900> I<00:03:37.049> go

00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:37.319 
pointing to a South magnet and if I go

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:40.099 
pointing to a South magnet and if I go
here<00:03:37.829> and<00:03:37.970> and<00:03:38.970> start<00:03:39.239> checking<00:03:39.450> against<00:03:40.019> the

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:40.109 
here and and start checking against the

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:44.089 
here and and start checking against the
sides<00:03:40.380> like<00:03:40.709> I<00:03:40.889> would<00:03:41.040> typically<00:03:41.400> do<00:03:42.769> it<00:03:43.769> looks

00:03:44.089 --> 00:03:44.099 
sides like I would typically do it looks

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:50.050 
sides like I would typically do it looks
like<00:03:44.340> the<00:03:45.120> rail<00:03:45.329> as<00:03:45.690> a<00:03:46.400> North<00:03:47.400> magnet

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:54.800 

but<00:03:51.060> then<00:03:51.269> as<00:03:51.840> you<00:03:51.900> come<00:03:52.170> around<00:03:53.090> it<00:03:54.090> seems<00:03:54.690> to

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
but then as you come around it seems to

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:56.809 
but then as you come around it seems to
get<00:03:54.900> confused<00:03:55.409> about<00:03:55.560> what<00:03:55.920> what<00:03:56.459> this<00:03:56.640> other

00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:56.819 
get confused about what what this other

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:00.619 
get confused about what what this other
side<00:03:57.150> is<00:03:57.540> and<00:03:58.549> if<00:03:59.549> you<00:03:59.700> tilt<00:03:59.970> it<00:04:00.150> a<00:04:00.239> little<00:04:00.269> bit

00:04:00.619 --> 00:04:00.629 
side is and if you tilt it a little bit

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:03.710 
side is and if you tilt it a little bit
then<00:04:01.620> you<00:04:01.860> can<00:04:02.099> sort<00:04:02.610> of<00:04:02.700> get<00:04:03.390> it<00:04:03.480> to<00:04:03.569> play

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
then you can sort of get it to play

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.970 
then you can sort of get it to play
along<00:04:04.489> this<00:04:05.489> is<00:04:05.730> obviously<00:04:06.410> you<00:04:07.410> know<00:04:07.739> it's

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
along this is obviously you know it's

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:12.710 
along this is obviously you know it's
very<00:04:08.269> consistently<00:04:09.269> a<00:04:09.590> north<00:04:10.590> magnet<00:04:11.720> it

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
very consistently a north magnet it

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.990 
very consistently a north magnet it
stays<00:04:13.049> solid<00:04:13.440> whether<00:04:13.890> I<00:04:13.950> go<00:04:14.190> up<00:04:14.310> and<00:04:14.489> down<00:04:14.580> and

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
stays solid whether I go up and down and

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.120 
stays solid whether I go up and down and
go<00:04:15.090> side<00:04:15.299> to<00:04:15.330> side<00:04:15.480> and<00:04:15.989> then<00:04:16.590> it<00:04:16.680> seems<00:04:16.919> like

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
go side to side and then it seems like

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.159 
go side to side and then it seems like
when<00:04:17.340> you<00:04:17.430> get<00:04:17.549> over<00:04:17.699> to<00:04:17.910> the<00:04:17.940> p90<00:04:18.720> you<00:04:18.810> kind<00:04:19.079> of

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:19.169 
when you get over to the p90 you kind of

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:22.370 
when you get over to the p90 you kind of
have<00:04:19.320> to<00:04:19.350> rotate<00:04:19.680> up<00:04:20.130> toward<00:04:20.519> the<00:04:21.180> poles<00:04:21.510> to

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
have to rotate up toward the poles to

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.820 
have to rotate up toward the poles to
see<00:04:22.820> that<00:04:23.900> those<00:04:24.900> are<00:04:25.139> that<00:04:25.350> that<00:04:25.560> is<00:04:25.710> the

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
see that those are that that is the

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:27.680 
see that those are that that is the
South<00:04:26.039> magnet<00:04:26.550> and<00:04:26.940> then<00:04:27.030> as<00:04:27.150> you<00:04:27.240> come<00:04:27.389> kind

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
South magnet and then as you come kind

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:28.939 
South magnet and then as you come kind
of<00:04:27.810> come<00:04:27.930> around<00:04:28.020> it<00:04:28.289> starts<00:04:28.380> flipping<00:04:28.770> around

00:04:28.939 --> 00:04:28.949 
of come around it starts flipping around

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:34.670 
of come around it starts flipping around
but<00:04:29.930> so<00:04:30.930> the<00:04:31.080> inside<00:04:32.810> is<00:04:33.810> that<00:04:34.080> as<00:04:34.289> a<00:04:34.320> North

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 
but so the inside is that as a North

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:38.240 
but so the inside is that as a North
magnet<00:04:35.639> which<00:04:36.300> is<00:04:36.630> typical<00:04:37.380> of<00:04:37.590> Seymour

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:38.250 
magnet which is typical of Seymour

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:40.219 
magnet which is typical of Seymour
Duncan<00:04:38.400> now<00:04:39.300> let's<00:04:39.720> take<00:04:39.900> a<00:04:39.930> look<00:04:40.080> at<00:04:40.139> the

00:04:40.219 --> 00:04:40.229 
Duncan now let's take a look at the

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:41.600 
Duncan now let's take a look at the
Norton<00:04:40.440> of<00:04:40.560> the<00:04:40.620> neck<00:04:40.830> pickup<00:04:41.190> even<00:04:41.490> though

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:41.610 
Norton of the neck pickup even though

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:43.879 
Norton of the neck pickup even though
the<00:04:41.789> even<00:04:42.600> though<00:04:42.720> our<00:04:42.750> wires<00:04:43.110> our<00:04:43.530> coils

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:43.889 
the even though our wires our coils

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:46.029 
the even though our wires our coils
ended<00:04:44.070> up<00:04:44.190> being<00:04:44.400> backwards<00:04:44.880> the<00:04:45.120> magnetic

00:04:46.029 --> 00:04:46.039 
ended up being backwards the magnetic

00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:49.640 
ended up being backwards the magnetic
polarity<00:04:47.039> I<00:04:47.930> guess<00:04:48.930> it<00:04:49.080> does<00:04:49.199> kind<00:04:49.410> of<00:04:49.470> switch

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:49.650 
polarity I guess it does kind of switch

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:53.870 
polarity I guess it does kind of switch
around<00:04:49.800> to<00:04:50.539> when<00:04:51.539> you<00:04:51.630> go<00:04:51.780> over<00:04:51.930> here<00:04:51.960> now<00:04:52.880> we

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:53.880 
around to when you go over here now we

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:57.140 
around to when you go over here now we
have<00:04:53.910> a<00:04:54.030> South<00:04:54.300> magnet<00:04:54.840> on<00:04:55.440> the<00:04:55.650> inside<00:04:56.010> so<00:04:56.789> on

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:57.150 
have a South magnet on the inside so on

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.659 
have a South magnet on the inside so on
the<00:04:57.450> bridge<00:04:57.690> we<00:04:58.560> had<00:04:58.680> a<00:04:58.710> North<00:04:59.010> magnet<00:04:59.430> on<00:04:59.520> the

00:04:59.659 --> 00:04:59.669 
the bridge we had a North magnet on the

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:02.719 
the bridge we had a North magnet on the
inside<00:05:00.860> on<00:05:01.860> the<00:05:02.039> neck<00:05:02.250> pickup

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:02.729 
inside on the neck pickup

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:04.700 
inside on the neck pickup
we<00:05:03.389> got<00:05:03.510> a<00:05:03.539> South<00:05:03.810> magnet<00:05:04.200> on<00:05:04.289> the<00:05:04.440> inside

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:04.710 
we got a South magnet on the inside

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:07.250 
we got a South magnet on the inside
that's<00:05:04.919> that's<00:05:05.729> different<00:05:06.060> for<00:05:06.570> Seymour

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:07.260 
that's that's different for Seymour

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.560 
that's that's different for Seymour
Duncan<00:05:07.440> so<00:05:08.190> what<00:05:08.789> they're<00:05:08.970> actually<00:05:09.120> doing

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:09.570 
Duncan so what they're actually doing

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:11.839 
Duncan so what they're actually doing
with<00:05:09.690> these<00:05:09.900> pickups<00:05:10.380> is<00:05:10.680> going<00:05:11.010> north<00:05:11.550> south

00:05:11.839 --> 00:05:11.849 
with these pickups is going north south

00:05:11.849 --> 00:05:17.000 
with these pickups is going north south
north<00:05:13.520> south<00:05:14.810> so<00:05:15.810> what<00:05:15.930> you<00:05:16.080> end<00:05:16.289> up<00:05:16.440> with<00:05:16.500> is

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:17.010 
north south so what you end up with is

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:21.170 
north south so what you end up with is
and<00:05:18.979> get<00:05:19.979> him<00:05:20.099> in<00:05:20.190> here<00:05:20.340> this<00:05:20.490> is<00:05:20.550> the<00:05:20.700> necklace

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:21.180 
and get him in here this is the necklace

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:23.480 
and get him in here this is the necklace
the<00:05:21.389> bridge<00:05:21.539> north<00:05:21.870> south<00:05:22.080> north<00:05:22.139> south<00:05:22.710> which

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:23.490 
the bridge north south north south which

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:25.279 
the bridge north south north south which
helps<00:05:23.849> you<00:05:24.000> to<00:05:24.030> mix<00:05:24.539> those<00:05:24.780> with<00:05:24.810> other

00:05:25.279 --> 00:05:25.289 
helps you to mix those with other

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:27.469 
helps you to mix those with other
pickups<00:05:25.680> which<00:05:26.190> I<00:05:26.280> think<00:05:26.550> was<00:05:26.729> the<00:05:26.760> the<00:05:27.150> idea

00:05:27.469 --> 00:05:27.479 
pickups which I think was the the idea

00:05:27.479 --> 00:05:29.990 
pickups which I think was the the idea
for<00:05:28.080> them<00:05:28.260> and<00:05:29.010> in<00:05:29.250> doing<00:05:29.280> that<00:05:29.639> differently

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:30.000 
for them and in doing that differently

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.650 
for them and in doing that differently
than<00:05:30.210> they<00:05:30.330> had<00:05:30.510> ever<00:05:30.690> done<00:05:30.900> that<00:05:30.960> previously

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:32.660 
than they had ever done that previously

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:38.899 
than they had ever done that previously
on<00:05:33.660> the<00:05:33.780> neck<00:05:33.930> pickup<00:05:34.349> if<00:05:35.190> I<00:05:35.460> check<00:05:35.729> the<00:05:35.849> wiring

00:05:38.899 --> 00:05:38.909 

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:41.169 

start<00:05:39.599> with<00:05:39.689> the<00:05:39.749> black<00:05:39.959> and<00:05:40.139> white<00:05:40.289> pair

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:41.179 
start with the black and white pair

00:05:41.179 --> 00:05:47.719 
start with the black and white pair
white<00:05:42.709> being<00:05:43.709> ground<00:05:46.039> black<00:05:47.039> being<00:05:47.339> the<00:05:47.550> hot

00:05:47.719 --> 00:05:47.729 
white being ground black being the hot

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:57.980 
white being ground black being the hot
feet<00:05:54.740> so<00:05:55.740> black<00:05:56.009> and<00:05:56.159> white<00:05:56.249> is<00:05:56.789> the<00:05:57.179> street

00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:57.990 
feet so black and white is the street

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:01.760 
feet so black and white is the street
journal'<00:05:58.349> and<00:05:59.389> in<00:06:00.389> this<00:06:00.509> case<00:06:00.779> it's<00:06:01.080> the

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:01.770 
journal' and in this case it's the

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:05.419 
journal' and in this case it's the
outside<00:06:01.949> coil<00:06:03.830> which<00:06:04.830> i<00:06:04.919> think<00:06:04.979> is<00:06:05.189> what<00:06:05.339> we

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:05.429 
outside coil which i think is what we

00:06:05.429 --> 00:06:08.929 
outside coil which i think is what we
have<00:06:05.610> there<00:06:05.819> too<00:06:06.830> so<00:06:07.830> this<00:06:07.979> is<00:06:08.159> all<00:06:08.309> kind<00:06:08.610> of

00:06:08.929 --> 00:06:08.939 
have there too so this is all kind of

00:06:08.939 --> 00:06:10.579 
have there too so this is all kind of
mixed<00:06:09.209> up<00:06:09.300> if<00:06:09.539> you're<00:06:09.719> used<00:06:09.959> to<00:06:10.050> see<00:06:10.259> more<00:06:10.439> dump

00:06:10.579 --> 00:06:10.589 
mixed up if you're used to see more dump

00:06:10.589 --> 00:06:13.699 
mixed up if you're used to see more dump
in<00:06:10.770> this<00:06:10.919> world<00:06:11.569> of<00:06:12.569> the<00:06:12.839> red<00:06:13.019> and<00:06:13.169> green<00:06:13.409> I'm

00:06:13.699 --> 00:06:13.709 
in this world of the red and green I'm

00:06:13.709 --> 00:06:18.079 
in this world of the red and green I'm
gonna<00:06:13.889> go<00:06:14.159> green<00:06:14.490> as<00:06:14.849> ground<00:06:15.269> and<00:06:15.659> red<00:06:16.080> is<00:06:17.089> hot

00:06:18.079 --> 00:06:18.089 
gonna go green as ground and red is hot

00:06:18.089 --> 00:06:20.959 
gonna go green as ground and red is hot
that<00:06:18.499> should<00:06:19.499> be<00:06:19.589> the<00:06:19.709> rail<00:06:19.889> and<00:06:20.369> it<00:06:20.519> is<00:06:20.669> and

00:06:20.959 --> 00:06:20.969 
that should be the rail and it is and

00:06:20.969 --> 00:06:23.570 
that should be the rail and it is and
that's<00:06:21.089> the<00:06:21.209> correct<00:06:22.279> clarity<00:06:23.279> they're

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:23.580 
that's the correct clarity they're

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:27.379 
that's the correct clarity they're
electrically<00:06:24.860> so<00:06:25.860> we've<00:06:26.069> got<00:06:26.279> black<00:06:27.179> and

00:06:27.379 --> 00:06:27.389 
electrically so we've got black and

00:06:27.389 --> 00:06:29.719 
electrically so we've got black and
white<00:06:27.539> on<00:06:28.110> the<00:06:28.679> outside<00:06:28.709> with<00:06:29.399> the<00:06:29.429> screwed

00:06:29.719 --> 00:06:29.729

00:06:37.969 --> 00:06:37.979 
with that with that rail so to summarize

00:06:37.979 --> 00:06:41.899 
with that with that rail so to summarize
this<00:06:39.800> if<00:06:40.800> this<00:06:40.979> is<00:06:41.039> the<00:06:41.249> neck<00:06:41.429> this<00:06:41.669> is<00:06:41.819> the

far as wire coloring is concerned the

00:06:52.769 --> 00:06:55.609 
far as wire coloring is concerned the
p90<00:06:53.430> is<00:06:53.610> the<00:06:54.029> black<00:06:54.240> the<00:06:54.449> p90<00:06:55.079> is<00:06:55.139> both<00:06:55.319> of<00:06:55.499> them

00:06:55.609 --> 00:06:55.619 
p90 is the black the p90 is both of them

00:06:55.619 --> 00:06:58.100 
p90 is the black the p90 is both of them
are<00:06:55.800> the<00:06:55.949> black<00:06:56.159> and<00:06:56.369> white<00:06:56.519> wires<00:06:56.789> and<00:06:57.180> the

00:06:58.100 --> 00:06:58.110 
are the black and white wires and the

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:02.179 
are the black and white wires and the
rails<00:06:58.349> are<00:06:59.159> the<00:06:59.459> red<00:06:59.669> and<00:06:59.969> green<00:07:00.329> wires<00:07:01.189> which

00:07:02.179 --> 00:07:02.189 
rails are the red and green wires which

00:07:02.189 --> 00:07:04.129 
rails are the red and green wires which
is<00:07:02.369> kind<00:07:02.639> of<00:07:02.759> the<00:07:03.209> opposite<00:07:03.689> of<00:07:03.779> what<00:07:03.839> you'd

00:07:04.129 --> 00:07:04.139 
is kind of the opposite of what you'd

00:07:04.139 --> 00:07:06.019 
is kind of the opposite of what you'd
expect<00:07:04.259> from<00:07:04.589> a<00:07:04.709> Seymour<00:07:05.069> Duncan<00:07:05.219> pickup<00:07:05.729> and

00:07:06.019 --> 00:07:06.029 
expect from a Seymour Duncan pickup and

00:07:06.029 --> 00:07:09.199 
expect from a Seymour Duncan pickup and
then<00:07:06.659> they<00:07:06.869> don't<00:07:07.050> have<00:07:07.740> the<00:07:08.159> insides<00:07:08.939> being

00:07:09.199 --> 00:07:09.209 
then they don't have the insides being

00:07:09.209 --> 00:07:10.909 
then they don't have the insides being
north<00:07:09.419> and<00:07:09.599> the<00:07:09.659> outsides<00:07:09.990> being<00:07:10.229> south<00:07:10.589> they

00:07:10.909 --> 00:07:10.919 
north and the outsides being south they

00:07:10.919 --> 00:07:13.999 
north and the outsides being south they
are<00:07:11.099> north<00:07:11.789> south<00:07:11.999> north<00:07:12.329> south<00:07:12.919> thanks<00:07:13.919> for

00:07:13.999 --> 00:07:14.009 
are north south north south thanks for

00:07:14.009 --> 00:07:16.069 
are north south north south thanks for
