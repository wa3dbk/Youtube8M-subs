00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.599

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.969

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.400
 dragged by a current and still 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.750
 he does not know his whereabouts 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:18.119
 gracefully to a brother- in- law who 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.390
 accompanied and a friend of this one managed 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:24.180
 get out of the water but almost 48 hours more 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:27.390

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.820
 stormy anguish I am desperate

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.550
 my heart men I know he is fine and I 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:37.100
 I have faith that he is alive 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.600
 if I know that well and I know that he is going to 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.180
 fight for him for me for his baby 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.070

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.730
 dad that we are these desperate are 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.590
 grabbed one of the stones 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:51.070
 they saw it they climbed on the bridge 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:55.570
 pendant there are they saw it there they tried 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:57.820
 to go closer and then the current 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:00.390
 he is too strong and he jumped 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:04.690
 more downstairs they saw him holding on to a 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:06.490
 bush as I said and when they tried to 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.470
 lower it to look for it no longer in each 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.700
 staff of the state agency for the 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.729
 emergency management and administration 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:15.310
 of disasters continue the intense 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:18.280
 search to which more than 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:21.280
 40 people between volunteers and staff 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:24.070
 specialized but there's still no news 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.080
 of this young man who is close to being 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:29.320
 father and we are working in brigades 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.960
 of work 22 that are terrestrial and 2 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.340
 that we have in the river looking 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.979
 scrutinizing all the areas that are 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.990
 in the river we have traveled all the 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:40.119
 river what is the point of the last time 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:43.720
 that you see that your colleagues see you with 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:45.280
 life of the disappearance all up to the 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.440
 observatory of arecibo we are 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.300
 looking alive 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.740
 to see where we can already 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:53.530
 with control of what is important is 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:56.140
 find it for Pablo Perez Rivers were 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.480
 usual in the exits to the rivers and 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.970
 the caves is for this the relatives 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:03.700
 they hold that the young man may be alive 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:07.310
 positive that is so maybe this has 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:11.900
 hit and taken night 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:15.530

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:25.370

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:34.340
 rolled in a 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:37.550
 and bushes apparently because more 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:40.580
