 on 

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:30.600
 like the previous model is here 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.220
 also the touch cover and the type cable 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.120
 the attachable by means of magnets 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.400
 keyboard 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.160
 the latter keyboard is also still 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:40.830

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.860
 use notebook replacement too 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:48.530
 just a few longer on the way 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.790
 to write texts 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:54.629
 and if you ask yourself how strong you are 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:55.800
 The magnet works so strongly on the go 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.690
 of course with the full hd 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.790
 touchscreen and if you have the keyboard 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.550
 Of course, you can not keep cover here 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:03.180
 also the onscreen keyboard of windows 8 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.610
 use 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.560
 in everyday life and in the workplace 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.780
 Artistic area is a stylus 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.340
 of course very important with these 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.960
 to make handwritten notes 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:18.120
 or draw on the back 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.010
 we have a stand and this one has in 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:23.490
 Contrary to the previous models now 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:25.770
 two options and it 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.830

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.540
 and a front camera 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.220
 let's look at the connections to da 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.770
 we have here on the right side 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.650
 first a mini display port and then 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:40.230
 from the left side a usb 3.0 port 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.570
 and of course the micro sd cards 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:44.460
 these are not missing 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.600
 because we have windows as the operating system 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.220
 Of course we can also do that here 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.050
 applications use the like from the 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.740
 notebook or on the desktop already 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:51.690

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.530

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.610
