00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.490

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:46.140
 devices what is inserted under 

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:50.340
 legs this is what is inserted here so 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:52.950
 let's start the figures to the first figure 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:58.170
 which did not come across it of course pedometer 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:02:01.039
 this figure did not like 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:05.119
 because i'm a japanese tv remote 

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:05.119
 from behind it looks like this 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:16.790
 well, okay , so here's the stupid one 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:20.890
 physiognomy physiognomy means the second figure 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.890
 which got caught is maggie maggie 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:28.180

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:28.180
 scared his face like that 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:38.700
 and a torn bear from behind she looks 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:43.050
 here so this body is common there is no legs it 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:47.610
 connected together 3 figurine which is not 

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:49.920
 sleep is certainly Bart that my 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.460
 he liked the fact that there is limited 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.600
 sleeves 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:58.440
 like gomer hall drawn a slingshot on 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:03:08.250
 legs and body skateboard there is such 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:12.020
 interesting and such is the head so 4 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:15.020
 figure I came across it was 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:15.020
 to grow 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.620
 paint it looks like this 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:26.689
 Homer is such a pink shirt his such 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:29.000
 he has such a hair pie 

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:31.459
 Generally nothing ordinary he interesting 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:37.879
 by the way all the figures and felt their 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:42.920
 fingers so 4 means I came across march 

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:45.890
 she does not have such an inscription donuts and of 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:48.079
 English is bad I'm a handbag now 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:51.519
 Here is such an interesting long hair 

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:56.150
 there is some hole in the place why is she 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:59.170
 back here if she would have been without a skirt and 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:01.280
 she would be in shorts 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:04.250
 so the next figure 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:09.130
 the next figure we had was 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:13.470
 flanders flanders 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:13.470
 he has such simple clothes 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:18.470
 there is nothing drawn behind this 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:21.070
 mug 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:21.070
 some inscription 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:33.600
 and here is such a tool case 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:34.950
 so the next figure we did not get 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:40.180
 this 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:42.190
 Scratchy if that if that was the name and 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:50.830

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:19.850
 his name is not like him at all 

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:22.430
