00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.850 
seconds you can bring in the egg from
the<00:01:54.210> sides<00:01:54.509> like<00:01:54.780> this<00:01:54.840> and<00:01:55.259> where<00:01:55.619> there's<00:01:55.770> a

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
the sides like this and where there's a

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.920 
the sides like this and where there's a
gap<00:01:56.070> there<00:01:56.369> don't<00:01:56.790> worry<00:01:56.939> just<00:01:57.149> tilt<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:57.689> pan

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
gap there don't worry just tilt the pan

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.480 
gap there don't worry just tilt the pan
and<00:01:58.500> then<00:01:58.590> you<00:01:58.649> can<00:01:58.770> bring<00:01:58.890> it<00:01:58.979> in<00:01:59.070> here<00:01:59.310> and

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
and then you can bring it in here and

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.670 
and then you can bring it in here and
then<00:01:59.820> you<00:01:59.880> can<00:01:59.939> tilt<00:02:00.149> the<00:02:00.240> pan<00:02:00.450> just<00:02:01.320> like<00:02:01.439> this

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
then you can tilt the pan just like this

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.889 
then you can tilt the pan just like this
right<00:02:02.009> and<00:02:02.759> then<00:02:02.939> after<00:02:03.240> about<00:02:03.509> 30<00:02:04.020> seconds

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:05.899 
right and then after about 30 seconds

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:08.359 
right and then after about 30 seconds
all<00:02:06.899> right<00:02:06.960> you<00:02:07.290> want<00:02:07.469> to<00:02:07.500> squiggle<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:08.250> egg

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
all right you want to squiggle the egg

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.119 
all right you want to squiggle the egg
around<00:02:08.489> one<00:02:08.849> last<00:02:09.000> time<00:02:09.330> we'll<00:02:10.319> turn<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:10.679> heat

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
around one last time we'll turn the heat

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.300 
around one last time we'll turn the heat
down<00:02:11.160> a<00:02:11.370> bit

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
down a bit

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.040 
down a bit
and<00:02:13.150> I'll<00:02:13.240> put<00:02:13.420> a<00:02:13.450> little<00:02:13.569> bit<00:02:13.660> of<00:02:13.750> cheddar

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
and I'll put a little bit of cheddar

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.199 
and I'll put a little bit of cheddar
cheese<00:02:14.170> in<00:02:14.560> now<00:02:14.950> you<00:02:15.190> could<00:02:15.340> use<00:02:15.520> all<00:02:15.880> sorts<00:02:16.060> of

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
cheese in now you could use all sorts of

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:16.920 
cheese in now you could use all sorts of
different<00:02:16.360> cheese

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
different cheese

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.620 
different cheese
I<00:02:16.959> think<00:02:17.319> cheddar<00:02:17.560> cheese<00:02:17.800> is<00:02:17.950> just<00:02:18.130> great<00:02:18.819> you

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
I think cheddar cheese is just great you

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.930 
I think cheddar cheese is just great you
need<00:02:19.750> the<00:02:19.840> tiniest<00:02:20.260> amount<00:02:20.620> and<00:02:20.890> this<00:02:21.550> is<00:02:21.670> just

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
need the tiniest amount and this is just

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.180 
need the tiniest amount and this is just
for<00:02:22.090> a<00:02:22.150> basic<00:02:22.569> omelet<00:02:22.900> so<00:02:23.440> just<00:02:23.709> grate<00:02:23.950> the

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
for a basic omelet so just grate the

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:27.510 
for a basic omelet so just grate the
cheese<00:02:24.450> over<00:02:25.450> the<00:02:25.660> omelet<00:02:25.959> like<00:02:26.050> this<00:02:26.400> you<00:02:27.400> can

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520 
cheese over the omelet like this you can

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.010 
cheese over the omelet like this you can
see<00:02:27.670> that<00:02:27.850> uxt<00:02:28.150> looks<00:02:28.420> a<00:02:28.480> little<00:02:28.569> soft<00:02:28.930> around

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
start turning you can just look at it

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:51.780 
start turning you can just look at it
you<00:02:50.260> can<00:02:50.350> see<00:02:50.680> it<00:02:50.800> you<00:02:51.190> can<00:02:51.340> see<00:02:51.550> the<00:02:51.700> egg

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
you can see it you can see the egg

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:54.360 
you can see it you can see the egg
change<00:02:52.150> color<00:02:52.510> then<00:02:53.350> you<00:02:53.860> get<00:02:54.010> your<00:02:54.130> slice

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
change color then you get your slice

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.570 
change color then you get your slice
like<00:02:54.640> this<00:02:55.769> you<00:02:56.769> can<00:02:56.920> just<00:02:56.950> go<00:02:57.250> around<00:02:57.459> the

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
like this you can just go around the

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:00.240 
like this you can just go around the
edges<00:02:57.989> don't<00:02:58.989> sort<00:02:59.170> of<00:02:59.230> over<00:02:59.500> touch<00:02:59.680> it<00:02:59.920> though

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
edges don't sort of over touch it though

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.620 
edges don't sort of over touch it though
just<00:03:00.280> go<00:03:00.489> around<00:03:00.670> the<00:03:00.760> edges<00:03:00.930> and<00:03:01.930> dislodge<00:03:02.440> it

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
just go around the edges and dislodge it

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.210 
just go around the edges and dislodge it
non-stick<00:03:04.630> pans<00:03:04.900> for<00:03:05.080> this<00:03:05.230> really<00:03:05.769> essential

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
non-stick pans for this really essential

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.250 
non-stick pans for this really essential
I<00:03:06.280> think<00:03:06.630> unless<00:03:07.630> you've<00:03:07.750> got<00:03:07.840> a<00:03:07.900> good<00:03:08.050> old

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
I think unless you've got a good old

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.130 
I think unless you've got a good old
cast-iron<00:03:08.709> one<00:03:09.390> see<00:03:10.390> if<00:03:10.480> you<00:03:10.569> can<00:03:10.750> move<00:03:10.930> the

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
cast-iron one see if you can move the

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:12.120 
cast-iron one see if you can move the
omelette<00:03:11.380> like<00:03:11.470> that<00:03:11.590> can<00:03:11.739> you<00:03:11.769> see<00:03:11.950> how<00:03:12.069> that

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130 
omelette like that can you see how that

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.580 
omelette like that can you see how that
omnis<00:03:12.459> moving<00:03:12.880> alright<00:03:13.540> so<00:03:14.080> in<00:03:14.200> theory<00:03:14.440> I

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
omnis moving alright so in theory I

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.160 
omnis moving alright so in theory I
shouldn't<00:03:14.890> get<00:03:14.980> any<00:03:15.040> grief<00:03:15.840> so<00:03:16.840> what<00:03:17.049> I<00:03:17.079> do

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
shouldn't get any grief so what I do

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.410 
shouldn't get any grief so what I do
then<00:03:17.320> is<00:03:17.350> I<00:03:17.500> tilt<00:03:17.829> the<00:03:17.920> Omni<00:03:18.100> away<00:03:18.340> put<00:03:19.269> my

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
then is I tilt the Omni away put my

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.729 
then is I tilt the Omni away put my
spatula<00:03:20.100> into<00:03:21.100> one<00:03:21.250> side<00:03:21.489> like<00:03:21.700> this<00:03:22.650> get<00:03:23.650> it

00:03:23.729 --> 00:03:23.739 
spatula into one side like this get it

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:26.699 
spatula into one side like this get it
underneath<00:03:24.010> I<00:03:25.019> don't<00:03:26.019> want<00:03:26.170> to<00:03:26.230> overcook<00:03:26.560> the

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
underneath I don't want to overcook the

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:28.650 
underneath I don't want to overcook the
omelet<00:03:26.950> and<00:03:26.980> then<00:03:27.220> just<00:03:27.400> flap<00:03:28.060> it<00:03:28.209> like<00:03:28.540> that

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
omelet and then just flap it like that

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.710 
omelet and then just flap it like that
that's<00:03:29.200> all<00:03:29.350> we<00:03:29.470> want<00:03:29.650> and<00:03:30.040> that<00:03:30.070> is<00:03:30.850> heavenly
