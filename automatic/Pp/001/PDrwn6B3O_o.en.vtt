00:00:01.399 --> 00:00:08.480
 hello and welcome tsum 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:10.740
 technology advice with wolfgang rudolph yes 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:13.650
 it is interesting 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.680
 I have a demo here 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.940
 started hello together 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:21.390
 navigation system a navigation system 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:24.300
 with german map in 6 inch format 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.789
 and I have to say very honestly 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.070
 bright display is very bright very strong 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.330
 even if a little bit the sun 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.619
 On it you can also something 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.809
 recognize that is usually roses 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:38.969
 critical point in many navigation system 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:40.350
 it is called rsx 60 3 d it can signals 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.510
 they have just heard of themselves 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.300
 it speaks of course it can also 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.579
 street names speak this is the tunnel 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.860
 By the way, I have to come there day 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.230
 I think there is one though 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.590
 system knows that in the tunnel it says 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.750
 then eventually gps signal lost or 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.820
 something like that is clear in the tunnel one has 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.260
 But no one is easy in the software 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.710
 just a click that someday 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.989
 to change 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.640
 the navigation is nice to you 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.590
 Can in this tunnel illustration 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.939
 By the way, we also see that we are up there 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.130
 this little window the 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.479
 route course still displayed 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.470
 he gets tempted as 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.140
 find out 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.790
 with the old speed as where is 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.159
 he actually how fast and are now 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.299
 then we'll see you outside again 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.970
 then we will get those again 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.110
 Traffic sign displayed from somewhere 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.759
 comes a right turn 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:32.220
 here is then replenishment of the 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:35.270
 containers overtake and I get 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.770
 running something tells this 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.450
 navigation system also has a dvb-t 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.090
 TV installed here you can see 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:45.270
 the antenna and in areas where you too 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.610
 can hear over dvb-t radio station 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.860
 Of course you will get them too 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.270
 have a video player installed 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:57.320
 So watch her videos 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:59.790
 mp3s , thank you and so on, so listen 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:02.030
 navigation system which is very fast in 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.799
 the navigation is very fast in the 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:07.550
 calculating the route accessories is everything 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:09.629
 here the connection cable 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:12.180
 at the same time this is also the antenna 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.959
 for the built-in russian worm 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.519
 receiver with the 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:17.000
 traffic messages are received and 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:19.709
 to be involved in the navigation 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.569
 USB cable then at home afterwards 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:23.010
 at calculator can see if the memory card 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:25.560
 look at it write etc 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.450
 read your data underneath and of course 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.609
 here this bracket for the disc 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.219
 By the way, software is there too 

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:39.180
 Below is this little card if I am now 

00:02:32.219 --> 00:02:42.079
 Let's get out there is the navigation 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.079
 software on it
