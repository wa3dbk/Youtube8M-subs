00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
well maybe not because the answer is

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.630 
well maybe not because the answer is
actually<00:00:20.730> false<00:00:21.769> believe<00:00:22.769> it<00:00:22.890> or<00:00:22.980> not<00:00:23.100> they

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:48.240 
reliable tools is to use shadows here's
another<00:01:47.200> illusion<00:01:47.500> to<00:01:47.710> show<00:01:47.830> you<00:01:47.890> how<00:01:48.070> that

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 
another illusion to show you how that

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.820 
another illusion to show you how that
works<00:01:48.900> take<00:01:49.900> a<00:01:49.960> look<00:01:50.200> at<00:01:50.259> that<00:01:50.350> basketball

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:50.830 
works take a look at that basketball

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:52.980 
works take a look at that basketball
again<00:01:51.220> we're<00:01:52.060> going<00:01:52.240> to<00:01:52.390> put<00:01:52.600> it<00:01:52.690> on<00:01:52.810> the

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
again we're going to put it on the

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.700 
again we're going to put it on the
course<00:01:53.229> and<00:01:53.500> move<00:01:54.040> it<00:01:54.190> along<00:01:54.460> a<00:01:54.490> diagonal

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.360 

now<00:01:58.250> we're<00:01:58.370> going<00:01:58.520> to<00:01:58.640> add<00:01:58.760> a<00:01:58.790> shadow<00:02:00.370> it's

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:01.370 
now we're going to add a shadow it's

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:05.560 
now we're going to add a shadow it's
still<00:02:01.640> moving<00:02:01.970> in<00:02:02.030> the<00:02:02.120> same<00:02:02.300> way<00:02:02.510> right<00:02:04.570> okay

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
still moving in the same way right okay

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:07.930 
still moving in the same way right okay
so<00:02:06.080> what<00:02:06.380> if<00:02:06.470> we<00:02:06.590> change<00:02:06.950> the<00:02:07.190> position<00:02:07.340> of<00:02:07.790> the

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940 
so what if we change the position of the

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:09.850 
so what if we change the position of the
shadow<00:02:08.210> do<00:02:08.840> you<00:02:08.929> think<00:02:09.140> we<00:02:09.229> can<00:02:09.350> trick<00:02:09.710> your

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
shadow do you think we can trick your

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.290 
shadow do you think we can trick your
brain<00:02:10.039> into<00:02:10.190> seeing<00:02:10.610> the<00:02:10.789> balls<00:02:11.030> motion

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
brain into seeing the balls motion

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:18.070 
brain into seeing the balls motion
differently<00:02:16.209> does<00:02:17.209> it<00:02:17.330> look<00:02:17.510> like<00:02:17.660> the<00:02:17.870> ball

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
differently does it look like the ball

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:24.550 
differently does it look like the ball
is<00:02:18.320> taking<00:02:18.770> off<00:02:18.980> no<00:02:22.810> let's<00:02:23.810> tweak<00:02:24.110> the<00:02:24.290> shadow

what's the ball doing now looks like

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.399 
what's the ball doing now looks like
it's<00:02:33.390> bouncing<00:02:33.930> right

00:02:36.399 --> 00:02:36.409

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
your brain has learned to trust shadows

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.250 
your brain has learned to trust shadows
as<00:02:41.670> an<00:02:41.819> earful<00:02:42.239> proof<00:02:42.599> way<00:02:42.810> to<00:02:43.080> know<00:02:43.230> the

behavior of objects in space and in
general<00:02:47.879> it's<00:02:48.090> worked<00:02:48.500> until<00:02:49.500> now<00:02:49.819> behind<00:02:50.819> me

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
general it's worked until now behind me

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.869 
general it's worked until now behind me
there<00:02:51.659> are<00:02:51.720> two<00:02:51.900> shadows<00:02:52.290> that<00:02:53.190> both<00:02:53.489> appear

00:02:53.869 --> 00:02:53.879 
there are two shadows that both appear

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:56.059 
there are two shadows that both appear
gray<00:02:54.299> because<00:02:54.810> we<00:02:55.080> have<00:02:55.200> two<00:02:55.470> white<00:02:55.769> lights

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069 
gray because we have two white lights

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:58.130 
gray because we have two white lights
that<00:02:56.340> are<00:02:56.670> facing<00:02:57.060> me<00:02:57.180> now<00:02:57.840> if<00:02:57.900> we<00:02:58.019> replace

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
that are facing me now if we replace

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.619 
that are facing me now if we replace
with<00:02:58.920> a<00:02:58.980> purple<00:02:59.430> filter<00:02:59.760> let's<00:03:00.390> see<00:03:00.510> what

00:03:00.619 --> 00:03:00.629 
with a purple filter let's see what

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:03.369 
with a purple filter let's see what
happens<00:03:00.989> through<00:03:01.200> colors<00:03:01.500> you<00:03:01.650> see<00:03:01.680> the

00:03:03.369 --> 00:03:03.379 
happens through colors you see the

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:06.050 
happens through colors you see the
shadow<00:03:04.379> no<00:03:04.590> longer<00:03:04.860> looks<00:03:05.040> gray<00:03:05.280> it<00:03:05.790> looks

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
shadow no longer looks gray it looks

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.690 
shadow no longer looks gray it looks
screen<00:03:06.420> so<00:03:07.349> the<00:03:07.440> question<00:03:07.769> is<00:03:07.920> where<00:03:08.489> is<00:03:08.670> that

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
screen so the question is where is that

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.630 
screen so the question is where is that
green<00:03:09.090> light<00:03:09.299> coming<00:03:09.540> from<00:03:10.250> well<00:03:11.250> there<00:03:11.400> is<00:03:11.489> no

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.640 
green light coming from well there is no

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.910 
green light coming from well there is no
green<00:03:11.879> light<00:03:12.060> the<00:03:12.690> shadows<00:03:13.049> gray<00:03:13.319> but<00:03:13.799> it

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
green light the shadows gray but it

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.670 
green light the shadows gray but it
looks<00:03:14.099> green<00:03:14.370> why<00:03:14.819> because<00:03:15.720> of<00:03:15.959> the<00:03:16.410> color

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
looks green why because of the color

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.800 
looks green why because of the color
that's<00:03:16.950> surrounding<00:03:17.489> it<00:03:17.750> context<00:03:18.750> is
