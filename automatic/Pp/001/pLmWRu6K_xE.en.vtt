00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.030 
it will go there really quick just an
awesome<00:01:38.579> way<00:01:38.820> to<00:01:38.970> sort<00:01:39.270> of<00:01:39.710> integrate<00:01:40.710> that

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
awesome way to sort of integrate that

experience<00:01:45.540> so<00:01:45.630> we<00:01:45.720> can<00:01:45.840> continue<00:01:46.200> to<00:01:46.320> add

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
experience so we can continue to add

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.960 
experience so we can continue to add
various<00:01:47.610> tabs<00:01:47.990> we<00:01:48.990> can<00:01:49.020> add<00:01:49.409> let's<00:01:49.710> say

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
various tabs we can add let's say

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.760 
various tabs we can add let's say
YouTube<00:01:50.970> and<00:01:51.270> Engadget<00:01:51.960> and<00:01:52.140> let's<00:01:52.409> just<00:01:52.590> load

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
YouTube and Engadget and let's just load

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:53.899 
YouTube and Engadget and let's just load
up<00:01:52.799> a<00:01:52.979> bunch<00:01:53.100> of<00:01:53.250> tabs<00:01:53.490> and<00:01:53.670> see<00:01:53.790> how

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
up a bunch of tabs and see how

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.270 
up a bunch of tabs and see how
performance<00:01:54.270> is<00:01:54.630> with<00:01:55.409> lots<00:01:55.619> of<00:01:55.770> tabs<00:01:56.009> open

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
performance is with lots of tabs open

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.310 
performance is with lots of tabs open
this<00:01:57.090> has<00:01:57.210> really<00:01:57.479> come<00:01:57.630> a<00:01:57.689> long<00:01:57.899> way<00:01:58.140> in<00:01:58.170> terms

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
this has really come a long way in terms

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.899 
this has really come a long way in terms
of<00:01:58.619> performance<00:01:59.100> it<00:01:59.219> used<00:01:59.369> to<00:01:59.460> be<00:01:59.579> kind<00:01:59.759> of

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
of performance it used to be kind of

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.330 
of performance it used to be kind of
slowing<00:02:00.390> buggy<00:02:00.630> but<00:02:01.409> now<00:02:01.619> it<00:02:01.860> works<00:02:02.100> really

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
slowing buggy but now it works really

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.670 
slowing buggy but now it works really
well<00:02:02.460> and<00:02:02.790> tabs<00:02:03.240> will<00:02:03.540> load<00:02:03.750> simultaneously

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
well and tabs will load simultaneously

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.459 
well and tabs will load simultaneously
as<00:02:05.000> you<00:02:06.000> can<00:02:06.180> see<00:02:06.390> they're<00:02:06.600> starting<00:02:06.930> to<00:02:06.960> load

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
as you can see they're starting to load

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.529 
as you can see they're starting to load
got<00:02:08.160> a<00:02:08.190> lot<00:02:08.369> of<00:02:08.489> tabs<00:02:08.700> coming<00:02:09.090> through<00:02:09.300> there

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
got a lot of tabs coming through there

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.600 
got a lot of tabs coming through there
or<00:02:10.229> for<00:02:10.410> a<00:02:10.470> Wi-Fi<00:02:10.800> connection<00:02:10.860> so<00:02:11.370> should<00:02:11.580> be

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
or for a Wi-Fi connection so should be

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:12.640 
or for a Wi-Fi connection so should be
pretty<00:02:11.849> fast

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
pretty fast

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:14.680 
pretty fast
so<00:02:13.250> just<00:02:13.519> a<00:02:13.580> couple<00:02:13.700> of<00:02:13.909> seconds<00:02:14.209> later<00:02:14.420> and<00:02:14.569> we

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
so just a couple of seconds later and we

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.539 
so just a couple of seconds later and we
have<00:02:14.810> all<00:02:15.019> the<00:02:15.200> tabs<00:02:15.440> loaded<00:02:15.890> now<00:02:16.250> there<00:02:16.430> are<00:02:16.489> a

00:02:16.539 --> 00:02:16.549 
have all the tabs loaded now there are a

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:18.309 
have all the tabs loaded now there are a
few<00:02:16.700> things<00:02:16.940> that<00:02:17.090> you<00:02:17.180> can<00:02:17.360> do<00:02:17.569> from<00:02:18.110> here

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319 
few things that you can do from here

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:19.600 
few things that you can do from here
first<00:02:18.530> of<00:02:18.680> all<00:02:18.799> let's<00:02:19.010> take<00:02:19.220> a<00:02:19.250> look<00:02:19.489> at

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
first of all let's take a look at

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.309 
first of all let's take a look at
pinch-to-zoom<00:02:20.000> performance<00:02:20.720> and<00:02:20.930> panning

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 
pinch-to-zoom performance and panning

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:22.809 
pinch-to-zoom performance and panning
and<00:02:21.409> scrolling<00:02:21.709> so<00:02:22.190> let's<00:02:22.310> click<00:02:22.489> down<00:02:22.700> the

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:22.819 
and scrolling so let's click down the

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:24.880 
and scrolling so let's click down the
page<00:02:23.030> very<00:02:23.299> quickly<00:02:23.569> okay<00:02:24.470> we<00:02:24.590> get<00:02:24.709> some

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
page very quickly okay we get some

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.350 
page very quickly okay we get some
checkerboard<00:02:25.400> so<00:02:25.549> not<00:02:25.730> perfect<00:02:25.970> in<00:02:26.239> that

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
checkerboard so not perfect in that

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.649 
checkerboard so not perfect in that
respect<00:02:26.810> we<00:02:27.290> can<00:02:27.739> stop<00:02:28.280> it<00:02:28.519> and<00:02:28.700> we<00:02:28.970> can<00:02:29.150> pinch

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:29.659 
respect we can stop it and we can pinch

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:32.319 
respect we can stop it and we can pinch
to<00:02:29.750> zoom<00:02:29.950> pretty<00:02:30.950> good<00:02:31.129> performance<00:02:31.329> looks

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:32.329 
to zoom pretty good performance looks

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:33.670 
to zoom pretty good performance looks
like<00:02:32.540> we<00:02:32.659> accidentally<00:02:33.140> clicked<00:02:33.440> on<00:02:33.590> a<00:02:33.620> link

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
like we accidentally clicked on a link

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.789 
like we accidentally clicked on a link
there<00:02:34.069> and<00:02:34.840> you<00:02:35.840> can<00:02:36.110> go<00:02:36.260> back<00:02:36.500> with<00:02:36.530> the

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:36.799 
there and you can go back with the

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:38.259 
there and you can go back with the
android<00:02:37.220> back<00:02:37.400> button<00:02:37.760> or<00:02:37.940> you<00:02:38.030> can<00:02:38.150> do<00:02:38.239> a

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:38.269 
android back button or you can do a

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:39.970 
android back button or you can do a
little<00:02:38.450> swipe<00:02:38.780> over<00:02:39.110> here<00:02:39.379> and<00:02:39.530> use<00:02:39.739> the

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
little swipe over here and use the

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.100 
little swipe over here and use the
buttons<00:02:40.280> over<00:02:40.459> there

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
buttons over there

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:44.319 
buttons over there
so<00:02:42.110> let's<00:02:42.319> zoom<00:02:42.409> in<00:02:42.739> on<00:02:42.860> something<00:02:43.120> pinch<00:02:44.120> the

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:44.329 
so let's zoom in on something pinch the

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:46.119 
so let's zoom in on something pinch the
scroll<00:02:44.660> or<00:02:44.870> pinch<00:02:45.049> to<00:02:45.200> zoom<00:02:45.230> isn't<00:02:45.709> as<00:02:45.890> refined

00:02:46.119 --> 00:02:46.129 
scroll or pinch to zoom isn't as refined

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:49.390 
scroll or pinch to zoom isn't as refined
as<00:02:46.609> it<00:02:46.790> is<00:02:46.940> on<00:02:47.209> even<00:02:47.690> the<00:02:48.500> the<00:02:48.709> default<00:02:49.190> browser

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
as it is on even the the default browser

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.059 
as it is on even the the default browser
for<00:02:49.790> Android<00:02:50.230> now<00:02:51.230> if<00:02:51.290> we<00:02:51.410> swipe<00:02:51.680> over<00:02:51.799> to<00:02:51.920> the

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:52.069 
for Android now if we swipe over to the

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:53.259 
for Android now if we swipe over to the
right<00:02:52.190> you're<00:02:52.340> going<00:02:52.370> to<00:02:52.519> see<00:02:52.609> a<00:02:52.640> few<00:02:52.849> options

right you're going to see a few options

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:54.550 
right you're going to see a few options
here<00:02:53.329> we<00:02:53.540> can<00:02:53.629> go<00:02:53.720> right<00:02:53.900> into<00:02:54.049> the<00:02:54.200> settings
