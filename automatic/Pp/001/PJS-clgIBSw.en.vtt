and<00:00:12.840> today<00:00:13.740> we're<00:00:13.920> going<00:00:13.950> to<00:00:14.129> link<00:00:14.430> the<00:00:14.580> two

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:14.760 
and today we're going to link the two

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.820 
and today we're going to link the two
together<00:00:14.990> by<00:00:15.990> adding<00:00:16.530> a<00:00:16.770> 10

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:18.830 
together by adding a 10

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:21.340 
together by adding a 10
I've<00:00:19.340> made<00:00:19.610> it<00:00:19.730> will<00:00:19.880> track<00:00:20.180> here<00:00:20.480> you<00:00:20.960> can<00:00:21.140> see

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:21.350 
I've made it will track here you can see

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:24.310 
I've made it will track here you can see
that<00:00:21.590> and<00:00:22.360> for<00:00:23.360> the<00:00:23.420> bad<00:00:23.570> idea<00:00:23.900> if<00:00:23.990> you<00:00:24.080> want<00:00:24.230> to

do one for yourself which is something
to<00:00:26.000> focus<00:00:26.210> on<00:00:26.660> each<00:00:27.439> direction<00:00:27.800> we're<00:00:28.310> going

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:29.200 
to focus on each direction we're going

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:33.310 
to focus on each direction we're going
to<00:00:30.200> start<00:00:30.529> with<00:00:30.740> and<00:00:31.070> extend<00:00:31.759> next<00:00:32.629> to<00:00:32.840> the

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:33.320 
to start with and extend next to the

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.150 
to start with and extend next to the
trek<00:00:33.620> with<00:00:34.250> it<00:00:34.430> to<00:00:35.210> the<00:00:35.360> side<00:00:35.629> and<00:00:36.160> circle

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:37.160 
trek with it to the side and circle

is<00:02:58.690> a<00:02:58.750> pivot<00:02:59.620> turn<00:03:00.480> if<00:03:01.480> you've<00:03:01.660> got<00:03:01.810> your<00:03:01.930> track

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
is a pivot turn if you've got your track

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:04.640 
is a pivot turn if you've got your track
down<00:03:02.500> point<00:03:03.280> your<00:03:03.400> toes<00:03:03.460> forward<00:03:04.090> to<00:03:04.210> track
