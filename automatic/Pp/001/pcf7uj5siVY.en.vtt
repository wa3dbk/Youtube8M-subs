00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:04.980
 or 2 I already missed today 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.170
 I wanted to put a soundtrack to the video 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.770
 so I leave it here and go with 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.630
 the questions 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.099
 Edwin asks if I can tell you everything 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.750
 about what the disc wanted to make a video 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.070
 special for disk pc but in view of 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.450
 all the time it would take what 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.310
 you were a summary of everything that 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.859
 look for a 6 degree ph 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.439
 at least one gh under 6 a cache on 3 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.449
 the conductivity parameter between 250 and 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.189
 100 micro semen will usually be needed 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.930
 use an osmosis filter for the 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.670
 tap water will depend on the water of 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.109
 each city apart the capacity of 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.730
 filter should be above the 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.950
 Aquarium needs temperature 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.750
 ideal would be 27 degrees and at least 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.460
 they would need 50 liters for each fish 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.989
 regarding food, the best for 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.910
 These fish are homemade porridges 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.620
 made with vegetable fish or shellfish and 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.719
 fish feed supplement it with 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.190
 Live food and lyophilized as you see this 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.050
 it's a fish that needs its own neighborhood 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.520
 It is also very quiet and in need 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.199
 be expressed by what aquariums 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.090
 shaded and with vertical trunks for 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.379
 darken the water is great for you I do not 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.120
 I'm an expert on disk but I've had 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.070
 some 100 of beginners and it's not 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.690
 easy or cheap to take care of them rodri man 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.399
 asks how to treat a fungus that has 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.260
 he explained he took that adopt he has heard that 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.610
 they are cured with sea salt and this worked 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.330
 they point a tupper with filter without 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.680
 Heater 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.540
 adding and shouting water to try 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.860
 keep the temperature and have it in a 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.480
 tupper not to infect the judges 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.070
 also counted with three times this 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.330
 problem lately and I think that is 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.040
 patent that the fringe is world is a 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.510
 fish for small aquariums but for 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.830
 aquariums of hundreds of liters I would 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:21.450
 to the tupper inside the aquarium to 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.310
 and so maintain the temperature of step 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.510
 facilitate water changes the best 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.280
 would be to get some kind of 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:28.020
 medication like the one you mention and 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.700
 medicate according to your instructions if you do not 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.260
 you get I would use the half tub of 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.090
 sale in pharmacies then god perhaps 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.680
 what lamente liters every two or three days 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.510
 after each partial water change 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.980
 until I repeat the finished problem 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:39.660
 the treatment make a change of water and 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:41.280
 put active carbon at reason has a 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:42.840
 small spoon for every 20 liters of 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.250
 water for three days guillermo 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.229
 ask if it is normal for the fish 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.640
 swim against the glass sometimes or if it is 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.380
 a defect of this one because they look 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.640
 actually reflected many times the 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.229
 fish do this because they get 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.820
 nervous but sometimes they see their 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.590
 reflex a bit and progresses normally 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.240
 they should stop doing it in a short time 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.680
 but if it is not, the safest thing is that 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.150
 the wind because we have mounted is not the 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.830
 more correct for our fish because the 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:03.240
 size of the aquarium will be very small 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.920
 light question about care for the 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.470
 cherry shrimp and if it can coexist 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.840
 with guti runners and snails 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.220
 the software ph is 7 with 5 to 8 and the 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.630
 hardness you do not know because he has not yet 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.370
 could afford to buy 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.140
 indeed the prawn can live together 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.760
 with that kind of fish and snails 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.410
 anyway and the snails also from 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.150
 this pregnancy surely this water is 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.010
 good for prawns Juan Felipe cured 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.630
 the white dot but it looks like 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.760
 its way so this is very typical of 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.620
 neighborhoods without a heater 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.540
 because the white dot disappears with the 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.129
 medicines but eradicated by 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.659
 complete with high temperatures 

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:35.670
 they need a heater and I will go up 

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:37.470
 the temperature slowly watching over 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.480
 the fish do not get sick until they're 30 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.489
 degrees should keep it that way for 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.140
 a week and I emphasize watching the 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:44.370
 fish are always fine had question 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.530
 what is only care for the zebritas 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.940
 It is a fish a little nervous and needs 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.970
 a lot of free space for nothing you 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:53.069
 necessary parameters are ph of 7 ghd 15 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.569
 and the temperature of 96 degrees though 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:56.430
 a 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:58.140
 little different to these are fish that go 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.970
 in a group and the more we have the better 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.220
 food comes to be very standard re 

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:04.260
 large flake lyophilized live fish or 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.730
 seafood and vegetables and as a final point 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.230
 say that it is one of the most fish 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.549
 easy to take care Alberto has dedicated me 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.109
 a background for facebook like 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:11.310
 thanks to the advice I give and I 

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:13.349
 I feel so proud that I wanted to 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.810
 teach them all down to put it 

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:18.680
 Well I'm going to decide and use a 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.680
 kiss with my cherubs 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:25.290
 thanks for watching my videos here I leave you 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:28.040
 some more in case you have not seen it or 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.040
 you want to see again
