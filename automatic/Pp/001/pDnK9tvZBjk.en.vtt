00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:10.080 
they've been in the mood for mac and
cheese<00:04:06.939> lately<00:04:07.359> and<00:04:07.859> I'd<00:04:08.859> found<00:04:09.189> I<00:04:09.609> like<00:04:09.909> these

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090 
cheese lately and I'd found I like these

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:11.610 
cheese lately and I'd found I like these
coloring<00:04:10.509> books<00:04:10.750> that<00:04:10.959> are<00:04:11.049> the<00:04:11.169> big<00:04:11.349> and<00:04:11.500> easy

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
coloring books that are the big and easy

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.869 
coloring books that are the big and easy
ones<00:04:12.009> because<00:04:12.609> as<00:04:12.939> I<00:04:13.720> had<00:04:13.840> said<00:04:13.870> before<00:04:14.139> they

00:04:14.869 --> 00:04:14.879 
ones because as I had said before they

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:17.219 
ones because as I had said before they
typically<00:04:15.879> only<00:04:16.000> have<00:04:16.239> one<00:04:16.419> object<00:04:16.900> in<00:04:17.019> them

00:04:17.219 --> 00:04:17.229 
typically only have one object in them

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:19.890 
typically only have one object in them
so<00:04:17.979> I<00:04:18.039> can<00:04:18.070> isolate<00:04:18.310> the<00:04:18.609> object<00:04:18.940> and<00:04:19.090> say<00:04:19.329> to

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
so I can isolate the object and say to

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:21.539 
so I can isolate the object and say to
my<00:04:20.019> daughter<00:04:20.079> oh<00:04:20.560> what's<00:04:20.949> this<00:04:21.159> this<00:04:21.400> is<00:04:21.459> a
