because you know this this little guy
here<00:01:12.420> runs<00:01:12.659> into<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.020> rim<00:01:13.229> we<00:01:13.770> found<00:01:14.040> a

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:14.190 
here runs into the rim we found a

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.700 
here runs into the rim we found a
different<00:01:14.340> steering<00:01:14.729> arm<00:01:15.060> that<00:01:15.690> raises<00:01:16.409> the

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
different steering arm that raises the

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.460 
different steering arm that raises the
the<00:01:17.460> outer<00:01:17.610> tie<00:01:17.850> rod<00:01:17.880> in<00:01:18.210> yeah<00:01:18.750> it's<00:01:18.960> got<00:01:19.170> to<00:01:19.200> be

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
the outer tie rod in yeah it's got to be

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.650 
the outer tie rod in yeah it's got to be
an<00:01:19.770> inch<00:01:19.980> inch<00:01:20.340> and<00:01:20.520> a<00:01:20.610> half<00:01:20.790> at<00:01:21.090> least<00:01:21.120> right

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:21.660 
an inch inch and a half at least right

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:24.710 
an inch inch and a half at least right
right<00:01:22.140> exactly<00:01:22.710> now<00:01:23.100> you<00:01:23.400> can't<00:01:23.910> just<00:01:24.000> do<00:01:24.480> that

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
right exactly now you can't just do that

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.750 
right exactly now you can't just do that
alone<00:01:25.350> so<00:01:25.740> you<00:01:25.800> can't<00:01:26.040> take<00:01:26.250> these<00:01:26.400> steering

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:26.760 
alone so you can't take these steering

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.010 
alone so you can't take these steering
arms<00:01:27.000> and<00:01:27.180> put<00:01:27.300> them<00:01:27.390> on<00:01:27.450> a<00:01:27.480> stock<00:01:27.720> Camaro

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
arms and put them on a stock Camaro

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.470 
arms and put them on a stock Camaro
spindle<00:01:28.620> because<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:28.980> thing<00:01:29.190> will<00:01:29.370> just<00:01:29.480> bump

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:30.480 
spindle because the thing will just bump

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.000 
spindle because the thing will just bump
steer<00:01:30.750> all<00:01:31.050> over<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.440> place<00:01:31.650> it'll<00:01:31.920> be

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:32.010 
steer all over the place it'll be

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:33.860 
steer all over the place it'll be
terrible<00:01:32.250> but<00:01:32.790> we<00:01:32.940> make<00:01:33.150> this<00:01:33.360> handy<00:01:33.750> dandy
