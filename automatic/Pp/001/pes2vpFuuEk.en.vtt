00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:45.219 
anyway um I pulled off a few surprising

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:48.420 
anyway um I pulled off a few surprising
hits<00:01:45.490> this<00:01:45.820> time<00:01:46.180> though<00:01:47.040> now<00:01:48.040> we<00:01:48.100> all<00:01:48.399> know

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:48.430 
hits this time though now we all know

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:53.359 
hits this time though now we all know
that<00:01:48.700> the<00:01:49.090> m<00:01:49.210> 98<00:01:49.509> has<00:01:50.380> a<00:01:50.520> maximum<00:01:51.520> damage<00:01:51.909> of<00:01:52.299> 95

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
that the m 98 has a maximum damage of 95

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.940 
that the m 98 has a maximum damage of 95
dropping<00:01:54.369> off<00:01:54.520> to<00:01:54.549> a<00:01:55.060> minimum<00:01:56.049> of<00:01:56.200> 59<00:01:56.920> i

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
dropping off to a minimum of 59 i

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.639 
dropping off to a minimum of 59 i
believe<00:01:57.520> at<00:01:57.850> a<00:01:57.909> hundred<00:01:58.600> and<00:01:58.930> fifty<00:01:59.259> meters

00:01:59.639 --> 00:01:59.649 
believe at a hundred and fifty meters

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:04.440 
believe at a hundred and fifty meters
and<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:02.710> silencer<00:02:03.340> doesn't<00:02:03.759> seem<00:02:03.969> to<00:02:04.149> change

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
and the silencer doesn't seem to change

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.709 
and the silencer doesn't seem to change
those<00:02:05.110> stats<00:02:05.700> what<00:02:06.700> it<00:02:06.820> does<00:02:07.060> change<00:02:07.390> though

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:07.719 
those stats what it does change though

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:12.330 
those stats what it does change though
is<00:02:07.990> the<00:02:09.180> the<00:02:10.180> speed<00:02:10.509> of<00:02:10.720> the<00:02:10.899> bullet<00:02:11.340> basically

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
is the the speed of the bullet basically

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.150 
is the the speed of the bullet basically
cutting<00:02:12.610> it<00:02:12.880> in<00:02:13.090> half<00:02:13.380> so<00:02:14.380> you<00:02:14.800> can<00:02:14.980> already

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
cutting it in half so you can already

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.180 
cutting it in half so you can already
guess<00:02:15.700> them<00:02:15.970> by<00:02:16.540> the<00:02:16.600> by<00:02:17.530> the<00:02:17.590> time<00:02:17.920> your

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
guess them by the by the time your

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:21.870 
guess them by the by the time your
bullet<00:02:18.720> gets<00:02:19.720> to<00:02:20.380> the<00:02:20.530> enemy<00:02:21.010> he<00:02:21.610> would<00:02:21.760> have

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
bullet gets to the enemy he would have

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.170 
bullet gets to the enemy he would have
moved<00:02:22.060> you<00:02:22.390> know<00:02:22.420> twice<00:02:22.930> as<00:02:23.200> far<00:02:23.470> and<00:02:23.769> as<00:02:24.280> he

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
moved you know twice as far and as he

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.380 
moved you know twice as far and as he
would<00:02:25.390> have<00:02:25.569> if<00:02:26.230> you<00:02:26.560> if<00:02:27.099> you

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
would have if you if you

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.080 
would have if you if you
been<00:02:27.540> shooting<00:02:27.750> without<00:02:28.050> a<00:02:28.260> silencer<00:02:29.090> so

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
been shooting without a silencer so

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.780 
been shooting without a silencer so
leading<00:02:30.450> become<00:02:31.020> eating<00:02:31.620> the<00:02:31.860> target<00:02:32.370> becomes

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
leading become eating the target becomes

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.300 
leading become eating the target becomes
a<00:02:32.940> you<00:02:33.330> know<00:02:33.510> vital<00:02:34.020> if<00:02:34.350> you<00:02:34.770> want<00:02:34.980> to<00:02:35.100> actually

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
a you know vital if you want to actually

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.660 
a you know vital if you want to actually
hit<00:02:35.760> something<00:02:36.120> that<00:02:36.480> you're<00:02:36.690> aiming<00:02:36.840> at<00:02:37.670> well

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
bit too low and constantly getting those

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.070
