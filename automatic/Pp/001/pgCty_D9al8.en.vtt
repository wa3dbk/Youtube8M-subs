now before people asked it why does your

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:10.370 
now before people asked it why does your
voice<00:00:08.910> sound<00:00:09.030> different<00:00:09.599> is<00:00:09.690> because<00:00:09.840> I<00:00:10.139> got<00:00:10.349> a

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
voice sound different is because I got a

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.290 
voice sound different is because I got a
new<00:00:10.559> headset<00:00:10.800> it's<00:00:11.550> because<00:00:11.790> my<00:00:11.880> last<00:00:12.120> one

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
new headset it's because my last one

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.060 
new headset it's because my last one
broke<00:00:12.660> is<00:00:13.170> a<00:00:13.230> fatality<00:00:14.040> creative<00:00:14.790> headset<00:00:15.210> and

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:16.070 
broke is a fatality creative headset and

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:18.260 
broke is a fatality creative headset and
the<00:00:17.070> reason<00:00:17.369> why<00:00:17.460> I<00:00:17.490> makes<00:00:17.699> my<00:00:17.850> voice<00:00:17.880> sound<00:00:18.060> a

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
the reason why I makes my voice sound a

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.700 
the reason why I makes my voice sound a
little<00:00:18.420> bit<00:00:18.630> different<00:00:18.990> is<00:00:19.109> just<00:00:19.140> because

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
little bit different is just because

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.500 
little bit different is just because
that<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.189> mic<00:00:20.369> sort<00:00:20.640> of<00:00:20.730> closer<00:00:20.910> to<00:00:21.090> my<00:00:21.210> face

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
that the mic sort of closer to my face

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.189 
that the mic sort of closer to my face
and<00:00:22.400> that's<00:00:23.400> that<00:00:23.730> so<00:00:24.240> anyways<00:00:24.510> the<00:00:24.779> machine

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
and that's that so anyways the machine

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.689 
and that's that so anyways the machine
that<00:00:25.350> makes<00:00:25.560> the<00:00:25.710> smoke<00:00:25.980> was<00:00:26.189> created<00:00:26.550> by<00:00:26.640> the

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
that makes the smoke was created by the

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.130 
into the hole place a water bucket like
like<00:01:13.770> that<00:01:14.210> two<00:01:15.210> peas<00:01:15.360> in<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.509> Redstone<00:01:15.900> I

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
like that two peas in the Redstone I

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.870 
like that two peas in the Redstone I
read<00:01:16.619> some<00:01:16.770> repeater<00:01:17.040> facing<00:01:17.220> this<00:01:17.520> way

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
read some repeater facing this way

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.600 
read some repeater facing this way
or<00:01:18.210> some<00:01:18.450> repeater<00:01:18.810> facing<00:01:18.960> that<00:01:19.259> way<00:01:19.470> and<00:01:19.740> two

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
or some repeater facing that way and two

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.670 
or some repeater facing that way and two
pieces<00:01:20.820> of<00:01:20.850> redstone<00:01:21.030> like<00:01:21.689> that<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.590> way

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
pieces of redstone like that and the way

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.190 
pieces of redstone like that and the way
to<00:01:22.740> arm<00:01:22.979> it<00:01:23.159> is<00:01:23.280> just<00:01:23.520> placing<00:01:23.939> a<00:01:24.659> redstone

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
to arm it is just placing a redstone

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.990 
to arm it is just placing a redstone
torch<00:01:25.290> like<00:01:25.619> that<00:01:25.799> and<00:01:26.070> quickly<00:01:26.460> switching

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
torch like that and quickly switching

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.060 
torch like that and quickly switching
out<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.150> redstone<00:01:27.570> like<00:01:27.780> so<00:01:28.080> and<00:01:28.290> I'll<00:01:28.799> click

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
out the redstone like so and I'll click

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.520 
out the redstone like so and I'll click
the<00:01:29.700> smoke<00:01:30.030> particles<00:01:30.240> now<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.020> only<00:01:31.350> bad

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
the smoke particles now the only bad

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.140 
the smoke particles now the only bad
thing<00:01:31.740> about<00:01:31.799> this<00:01:32.159> is<00:01:32.520> that<00:01:32.670> if<00:01:32.909> you<00:01:32.970> go<00:01:33.119> to

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
thing about this is that if you go to

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.700 
thing about this is that if you go to
the<00:01:33.270> options<00:01:33.689> and<00:01:33.869> make<00:01:33.960> your<00:01:34.079> sound<00:01:34.259> turn<00:01:34.530> on

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
the options and make your sound turn on

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.679 
the options and make your sound turn on
I'll<00:01:34.950> put<00:01:35.400> it<00:01:35.549> at<00:01:35.610> nine<00:01:35.909> because<00:01:36.060> it<00:01:36.299> is<00:01:36.420> very

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
I'll put it at nine because it is very

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:37.100 
I'll put it at nine because it is very
noisy

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
noisy

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.719 
noisy
I<00:01:37.229> thought<00:01:37.680> you<00:01:37.799> can<00:01:37.920> hear<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.159> hissing<00:01:38.400> of

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
I thought you can hear the hissing of

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.870 
I thought you can hear the hissing of
these<00:01:39.270> smoke<00:01:39.509> particles<00:01:40.020> so<00:01:40.829> that's<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.700> bad

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
these smoke particles so that's the bad

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.399 
these smoke particles so that's the bad
thing<00:01:41.909> but<00:01:42.329> the<00:01:42.450> only<00:01:42.479> way<00:01:42.720> to<00:01:42.750> fixing<00:01:43.110> that<00:01:43.229> is

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
thing but the only way to fixing that is

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.319 
thing but the only way to fixing that is
just<00:01:43.649> putting<00:01:43.829> it<00:01:43.979> down<00:01:44.130> and<00:01:44.640> you<00:01:45.090> won't<00:01:45.240> be

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
just putting it down and you won't be

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:46.819 
just putting it down and you won't be
able<00:01:45.420> to<00:01:45.540> hear<00:01:45.750> it<00:01:45.810> now<00:01:46.380> if<00:01:46.439> you<00:01:46.500> do<00:01:46.619> want<00:01:46.799> to

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
able to hear it now if you do want to

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.039 
able to hear it now if you do want to
make<00:01:46.950> it<00:01:47.070> stronger<00:01:47.430> you<00:01:47.939> boom<00:01:48.540> you<00:01:48.720> can<00:01:48.869> just

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
make it stronger you boom you can just

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.530 
make it stronger you boom you can just
place<00:01:49.320> more<00:01:49.799> redstone<00:01:50.159> timer's<00:01:50.970> like<00:01:51.210> this

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
place more redstone timer's like this

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.490 
place more redstone timer's like this
around<00:01:52.439> it<00:01:52.770> and<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.220> more<00:01:53.399> you<00:01:53.490> put<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:53.759> more

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
around it and the more you put the more

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.719 
around it and the more you put the more
darker<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.619> smoke<00:01:55.860> will<00:01:56.040> be<00:01:56.070> so<00:01:56.490> I'll<00:01:56.579> just

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
darker the smoke will be so I'll just

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.240 
darker the smoke will be so I'll just
make<00:01:56.880> one<00:01:57.119> really<00:01:57.570> quick<00:01:57.750> like<00:01:57.990> this<00:01:58.250> like

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
arm it really quick and bam the smoke

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.540 
arm it really quick and bam the smoke
gets<00:02:05.640> much<00:02:05.939> darker<00:02:05.969> and<00:02:06.479> much<00:02:06.600> stronger<00:02:07.129> so<00:02:08.129> if

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
gets much darker and much stronger so if
