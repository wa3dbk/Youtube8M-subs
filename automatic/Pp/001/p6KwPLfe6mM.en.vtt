00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:04.370
 good here 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:13.230
 this the pointer of a ds xl 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:15.449
 it squeezed without much force but what 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.870
 that will make box on the edge do not read you 

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:18.220
 nothing 

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:20.240
 to put it on the table so that 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:23.300
 be well 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:26.680
 when you approach the edge it is left 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.680
 read to make more strength 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:34.800
 then what's the pinch if it's activated 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.590
 the option to show where the 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.810
 pointer all the time 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:43.160
 when you make the famous pinch 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:43.160
 as the law in white point 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:53.850
 then they are drops of 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:57.520
 it is impossible to do that 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.460
 as you see, you have to do 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:01.329
 in the process 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:05.489
 after 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:05.489
 if we open the open mobile 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:15.430
 in the minute of travel and at the age 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:17.470
 what happens is that the program hangs 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:20.520
 what on the table with which I am 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:20.520
 recording does not happen 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:25.920
 and back then the top 8 remains 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.020
 and the mini opera 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.620
 where there are supposed to be letters here 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.390
 I have seen some letters that you have speak 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:42.090
 what is the thing 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:43.920
 and there all this here are options 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.790
 written in text and you do not see that 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:51.220
 loneliness here 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:51.220
 of more options but do not know what they are 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.690
 and the southern common is the east button 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:09.100
 putting the finger have a tad of oak 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:10.540
 this from bottom to top 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.490
 so I'm doing two watching one of 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:15.050
 The most expensive 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:17.920
 and it does not feel like this anymore 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.920
 because this option 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:27.230
 you are given menu 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:31.120
 my whole soul I will not do it 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.120
 on carbon to go down to tolo 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:38.440
 all of which is pretty good 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:41.380
 explained I should explain nothing more 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.840
 good mainly that 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:47.910
 all fucking mother but there are things that 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.910
 advanced a 1 if they are like this or directly 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.070
 you are welcome
