will so there's the how high you are you
could<00:01:12.810> have<00:01:12.900> different<00:01:13.110> cameras<00:01:13.820> I'm<00:01:14.820> flying

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
could have different cameras I'm flying

could have different cameras I'm flying
the<00:01:15.240> Southwest<00:01:15.720> airplane<00:01:16.159> yes<00:01:17.159> oh<00:01:17.869> oh<00:01:18.869> yeah

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
look at this I'm probably crashing into

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.690 
look at this I'm probably crashing into
the<00:01:23.420> ocean<00:01:24.420> right<00:01:24.600> now<00:01:25.250> the<00:01:26.250> reason<00:01:26.400> why<00:01:26.580> my

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
the ocean right now the reason why my

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.039 
the ocean right now the reason why my
controlling<00:01:27.210> the<00:01:27.270> plane<00:01:27.479> is<00:01:27.659> cuz<00:01:27.840> it's

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
controlling the plane is cuz it's

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.990 
controlling the plane is cuz it's
probably<00:01:28.409> you<00:01:29.130> know<00:01:29.220> can<00:01:29.490> I<00:01:29.549> turn<00:01:29.700> on<00:01:29.850> the

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
probably you know can I turn on the

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.469 
probably you know can I turn on the
autopilot<00:01:30.240> oh<00:01:30.720> crap<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.770> engines<00:01:32.460> down<00:01:32.640> okay
