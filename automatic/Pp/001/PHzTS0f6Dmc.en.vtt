00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:51.870 
that's something that a lot goalkeeping
needs<00:00:50.740> to<00:00:50.830> have<00:00:50.980> if<00:00:51.160> these<00:00:51.310> to<00:00:51.430> be<00:00:51.550> successful

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:51.880 
needs to have if these to be successful

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.210 
needs to have if these to be successful
by<00:00:52.690> command<00:00:53.110> my<00:00:53.260> box<00:00:53.470> I<00:00:53.590> communicate<00:00:54.100> with<00:00:54.130> my

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:54.220 
by command my box I communicate with my

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.100 
by command my box I communicate with my
defense<00:00:54.670> effectively<00:00:55.240> and<00:00:55.360> clearly<00:00:55.600> and<00:00:56.020> that

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:56.110 
defense effectively and clearly and that

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:57.390 
defense effectively and clearly and that
makes<00:00:56.290> my<00:00:56.380> job<00:00:56.560> a<00:00:56.620> lot<00:00:56.740> easier<00:00:56.800> because<00:00:57.250> I

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:57.400 
makes my job a lot easier because I

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:58.560 
makes my job a lot easier because I
don't<00:00:57.550> usually<00:00:57.670> have<00:00:57.940> as<00:00:58.060> much<00:00:58.270> as<00:00:58.390> much

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:58.570 
don't usually have as much as much

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.140 
don't usually have as much as much
action<00:00:58.890> when<00:00:59.890> it<00:01:00.010> comes<00:01:00.160> to<00:01:00.280> crosses<00:01:00.730> when<00:01:01.060> it

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:01.150 
action when it comes to crosses when it

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.390 
action when it comes to crosses when it
comes<00:01:01.360> to<00:01:01.570> reactionary<00:01:02.200> saves<00:01:02.500> I<00:01:02.710> feel<00:01:02.980> like

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:03.400 
comes to reactionary saves I feel like

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.530 
comes to reactionary saves I feel like
those<00:01:04.089> are<00:01:04.120> my<00:01:04.330> two<00:01:04.390> strings<00:01:04.780> as<00:01:04.930> well<00:01:05.110> I

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
those are my two strings as well I

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.730 
those are my two strings as well I
obviously<00:01:07.540> look<00:01:07.900> at<00:01:07.960> the<00:01:08.080> forward<00:01:08.290> the<00:01:08.440> angle

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:08.740 
obviously look at the forward the angle

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.230 
obviously look at the forward the angle
he's<00:01:08.890> coming<00:01:09.160> out<00:01:09.250> to<00:01:09.340> the<00:01:09.460> goal<00:01:09.670> and<00:01:09.850> I<00:01:09.970> just

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240 
he's coming out to the goal and I just

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.600 
he's coming out to the goal and I just
think<00:01:10.420> of<00:01:10.450> myself<00:01:10.510> I<00:01:10.900> can't<00:01:11.229> commit<00:01:12.160> too<00:01:12.340> early

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:12.610 
think of myself I can't commit too early

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:13.980 
think of myself I can't commit too early
because<00:01:12.760> if<00:01:13.119> he<00:01:13.240> does<00:01:13.390> so<00:01:13.570> just<00:01:13.750> dribble

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
because if he does so just dribble

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:15.780 
because if he does so just dribble
around<00:01:14.050> you<00:01:14.350> and<00:01:14.470> put<00:01:14.650> it<00:01:14.740> in<00:01:14.860> i'd<00:01:15.280> try<00:01:15.340> to<00:01:15.580> stay

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:15.790 
around you and put it in i'd try to stay

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:17.520 
around you and put it in i'd try to stay
on<00:01:15.850> my<00:01:15.940> feet<00:01:16.060> as<00:01:16.210> long<00:01:16.330> as<00:01:16.450> possible<00:01:16.479> you<00:01:17.380> just
