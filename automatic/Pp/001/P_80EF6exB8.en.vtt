 when getting stitch damage it emits 

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:22.079
 a cloud of poison gas for 4 seconds it's 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.229

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.920
 absorbed hero does not get 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.170
 extra damage and can't attack 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.029
 or use abilities also 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.130

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:08.600
 ingestion for 13 uncontrollability 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:10.340

 opponents by 75 percent by one 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.870

 teleports a short distance 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:50.540
 increase the mobile stitch or durable 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:52.459
 shields which reduces damage taken over 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:55.209
 75 percent in four seconds 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:58.670
 if you feel the lack of survival 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:59.480
 stitch most often play 2 builds 1 per 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:02.600
 survival 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:04.640
 2 but damage to the comments to the video write 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:07.250
 which of the oak was more like and 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:08.630
 how often do you play how to behave in 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:10.550
 the battle of the beginning of the battle 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:12.290
 go with some kind of killer on the line and 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:12.799
 try to fully realize your 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:14.840
 hook 

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:17.049
 drawing an enemy hero to your towers 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:19.700
 and killing him together 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:21.709
 survivability and damage of the beginning of the battle is not very 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.610
 is strong at stitch so don't try 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:24.890
 to heroize 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:26.680
 also use a hook in team fights 

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:28.970
 to draw an enemy hero 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.470
 preferably a hero which you are very 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:31.570
 quickly 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:34.150
 kill with a hook you can also shoot down 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:36.250
 triple shot but you or wandering spirit 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:38.410
 nazibo if your choice fell on 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:40.390
 ingest try to swallow 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:42.790
 strong killer or support 

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:44.770
 attributed to your team and quickly kill 

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:47.290
 use his bounce for 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:49.720
 use damage while consuming 

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:51.520
 only for archives off stitch very 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:54.130
 I liked how the characters he has a pretty 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:57.150
 heavy damage and a good survival and 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:59.260
 also very effective in team fights
