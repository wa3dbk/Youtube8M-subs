00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.339
 hello everyone i'm a parakeet min and this is my 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.470
 video 90 on youtube today I'm going to talk about 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.450
 the letters of yu gi but how to play 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.059
 currently and the most archetypes 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.280
 known the game changed a lot from 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.890
 that started that why I'm going to talk first 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.779
 of the different generations to 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.550
 principle only monsters were used 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.470
 normal and had chabÃ³n is that it 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.720
 they wanted to do the grosos and they sent them 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.730
 rituals and mergers but at that time 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.310
 to do mergers and rituals was something 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.380
 very difficult because to mergers only 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.210
 you could do them with polymerization and in 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.550
 that moment the only one that made mergers 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.710
 and rituals was yuri because he joputa 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.379
 I was always lucky and they had the 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.510
 better letters or if they did not make letters 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.460
 impossible to play as the guardian of 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.309
 the door and all those things that nobody 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.230
 they invoked them in real life after 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.149
 they started to make more monsters 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.010
 effects because they realized that 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.260
 making many common monsters the 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.260
 game got boring and the goals were 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.390
 always the same ones later came the 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.280
 yuyo gx and they started using more 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.530
 archetypes and fusion monsters 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.880
 They were increasingly used and easier 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.619
 to invoke 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.630
 now there are more cards that allow you 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.810
 make mergers like the super cop 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:15.000
 future merger and among others for whom 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.729
 do not know what a merger is when a 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.220
 solid becomes good liquid that 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.979
 is scientifically I do not feel like 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.679
 explain what a merger is then 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.689
 came out 5 yugioh in this were created the 

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:29.610
 synchrony letters that are letters 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.740
 whites that are summoned by adding a 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.380
 singer and a non-singer monster that 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.630
 add the monster level summon by 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.000
 example you invoke pink axel which is level 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.740
 4 and is a singer and then you invoke 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.780
 flash that is not a singer because it is 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.750
 guitarist and you can summon the geese 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.689
 roses was illiterate was to name a 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.880
 the band haha finally came out the weed 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:53.520
 sexual in this were added the 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.500
 xxi cidh monsters and these require two 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.799
 monsters of the same level and stay 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.390
 down the monster invoked good now 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.759
 I'm going to talk about the list of letters 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.159
 Prohibited limited and semi-limited 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:07.259
 good for me is very good 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.060
 existence of this list because if it is not 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.920
 I could win with many decks in one or 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.500
 two shifts and it would be the one that starts 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.300
 first wins although there are anyway 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.820
 people who complain because they make changes 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.310
 bad but anyway the list 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:23.160
 current seems to me something fair except for 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:25.050
 the prohibition of sangam now my mini 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.090
 prediction of this list 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.190
 the allowed cards are going to be the pot 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.260
 of greed and rayet and since they have 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.720
 effects too bad to be 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.400
 in the semi-limited list are going to be 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.380
 continue and the portal because I'm going to 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.600
 threaten the owners of konami in addition 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:42.420
 of button them track hole will not be 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.890
 limited letters the forbidden cards 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.260
 they will be the idol of the thousand eyes 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:48.390
 because you can attack its zero you do 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:50.340
 a first turn king also banned 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.320
 the king will be there and be a dragon 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.020
 all the pieces of exo dayz the 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:56.640
 reggaeton the sentinel humble button les 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:59.220
 track hole and the swords of light 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.670
 revealing besides that draco saqib and 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:04.350
 Guille will be 69 copies per beck 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:05.010
 there are some things that I do not understand 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.410
 she is ready 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.560
 for example the forbidden spear is 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:12.300
 allowed and ex hates the forbidden too 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:14.280
 sure that if someday they take out the spear 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:17.490
 allowed to be banned and if they take out 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:19.470
 exo day the limited 69 also 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:21.600
 good in this game there is always 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.370
 problems in which the duelists are 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.230
 they fight because the cards are due 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.030
 comply to the letter and there are times 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.980
 that you get to discuss with the others 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.950
 users of the effects of the letters 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.750
 this is a negative thing although there are times 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:36.690
 that you shit with laughter 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:39.090
 the other if it's online that's a 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:41.160
 thing that bothers me the other 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.590
 annoying thing is that they take a lot in 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:45.450
 make his plays he became very very 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.130
 complex the game currently and there's 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.750
 many decks that do not take long to make their 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:51.780
 played and not knowing if they 're making you 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:54.660
 trap or is it like that his game the worst thing is that 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:56.910
 after rem areas although also what 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.740
 annoying is that they draw archetypes re groso 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:01.410
 yes they are invisible and then they go 

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:04.560
 to avant list good now I'm going to talk 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:06.540
 of the most famous archetypes first 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:09.120
 I'm going to talk about the spplb uco books 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:11.580
 magic is a deck that has like 69 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:14.190
 Magic cards and little monsters 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:16.170
 but they're easy to invoke and with 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:19.320
 spplb uco city mind you bring half of 

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:21.060
 calama is not rejected that letter after 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.950
 other magical cards that do not 

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.030
 I know well and I have no idea that 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:26.910
 do they work 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:29.250
 for some if I know them later 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:31.320
 there are the oak dragons the only thing that 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:33.360
 I know that with whatever hand you have with 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:36.360
 those monsters you can summon Draco 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:38.400
 I take out the great eye the other acquaintances are 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:41.160
 the dark world these gain effects 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:44.280
 when they are discarded for example grafa 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:47.130
 can destroy another monster after 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:49.080
 are the six samurai this is the one 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:51.930
 I use because I only have silver to 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:53.910
 buy me the deck of many structure 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:56.040
 have you wondered what the 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:58.080
 name the cards but I got to 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:00.450
 search the wikipedia and I noticed 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:03.000
 that are their last names I also saw their 

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:05.580
 full names I know that you the 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.190
 they want to know so there they go john 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:10.500
 carlos genÃ© jorge kit san martÃ­n who 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:13.320
 jett and ricardo jean hay marÃ­a marta mi 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:15.120
 flow and jose at the cafe muse is called 

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:17.340
 Mario and the old man is called Alberto 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:19.110
 perez but as it is re little Japanese its 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:22.080
 name prefers to be told the old 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:24.960
 like the one of alejo and valentina after 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:26.940
 are the manches these are funny 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:28.650
 because most people say that 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:31.139
 they are for weiss because he has drawings 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:32.999
 queers but even the game is based 

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:35.639
 strategy and has nothing to do if 

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:37.259
 the drawings seem guys to these the 

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:38.909
 they did when they ate because it has 

00:05:37.259 --> 00:05:41.879
 Dessert names like ice cream 

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:43.979
 tiramisu good the letters that one 

00:05:41.879 --> 00:05:47.069
 they buy come in different rarities 

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:50.129
 for example rare ultra rare 

00:05:47.069 --> 00:05:52.379
 secret hyper rare rare archi rare mega and 

00:05:50.129 --> 00:05:55.439
 super hyper hyper rare file that from this 

00:05:52.379 --> 00:05:57.150
 last only I have good letters that 's 

00:05:55.439 --> 00:06:00.300
 lie because I most of the 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:01.979
 letters that I have are common there is something 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:03.779
 that I do not understand in this of the 

00:06:01.979 --> 00:06:06.180
 rarities similar to that of exo dÃ­az el 

00:06:03.779 --> 00:06:08.969
 prohibited for example the spplb ucot 

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:11.189
 secret's is common I think that if some 

00:06:08.969 --> 00:06:14.219
 day they take out a letter called spplb ucot 

00:06:11.189 --> 00:06:16.139
 Common's going to do good secret 

00:06:14.219 --> 00:06:18.150
 I had thought of showing him my 

00:06:16.139 --> 00:06:20.849
 collection of unique letters but it gives me 

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:23.639
 pachorra use the yuyo card maker sorry 

00:06:20.849 --> 00:06:26.069
 that did not have to say now they have 

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:27.990
 that believing this lie did not want them 

00:06:26.069 --> 00:06:30.180
 show because I have to go to the bank to 

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:33.180
 my ultra secret bunker to take them out and 

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:35.310
 it is relejo of my house good now 

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:37.379
 I would have to do poetry but as I do not 

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:38.009
 I want to use the yuyo card maker 

00:06:37.379 --> 00:06:39.800
 less 

00:06:38.009 --> 00:06:44.449
 I'm going to want to make a poetry 

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:44.449
 see you I'm going to play yugioh
