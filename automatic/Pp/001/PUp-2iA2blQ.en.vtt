we'll<00:00:04.080> take<00:00:04.259> power<00:00:04.560> from<00:00:04.740> the<00:00:04.950> grid<00:00:05.130> convert

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
we'll take power from the grid convert

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:08.509 
we'll take power from the grid convert
it<00:00:06.270> to<00:00:06.319> 25,000<00:00:07.319> volts<00:00:07.470> through<00:00:08.040> a<00:00:08.069> substation

out of another arm it will go across the

out of another arm it will go across the

add the age of the patient to the
