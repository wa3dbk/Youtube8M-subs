 three minutes 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:10.340
 an expert consultant on widoobiz and 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:12.990
 three minutes with evelyne platnic cohen 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:14.790
 founder of booster academy hello 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.650
 hello then this is the moment of 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.990
 expert chronicles and this week you 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.910
 came to offer us this column 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.619
 around prospecting techniques by 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.900
 phone discount know a little 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.099
 little more so first by phone that 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.349
 remains a basic today in 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.910
 prospected by phone but it's true 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.650
 that they rules have changed look into ten 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.420
 years as secretary 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.950
 completely gone which like that one 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.480
 spoke of the passenger secretary it's 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.610
 always very complicated but they are 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.690
 more there secretaries then but we 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.809
 still does not also happen to 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.610
 to join people but are in my opinion one 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.350
 put them out a little bit because 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.149
 you see well that there are poles where 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.960
 we have a person an assistant for 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.850
 ten employees 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.949
 so they have more the same function of 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.329
 to do dam good except on the 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.460
 obviously very very big boss so 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.289
 the rules of the game have changed and 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.660
 today you are going to have to reach 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.129
 an interlocutor via a number 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.960
 employees who do not work 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.250
 directly with his collaborator 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.080
 so there is a first rule that's 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.310
 always imagine that when you 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.210
 call you call a friend 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:14.760
 know you have times I call a 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.100
 friend no hawkers forbidden hello 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.830
 I would like to please no these jo 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.049
 talked to james dean and directly 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.369
 on two be clear in the voice 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:25.170
 imagine that you are calling your family 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.189
 imagine you're calling your spouse 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.850
 you will be able to reach him 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.350
 directly 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.439
 we know you will not lose your 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.280
 time people answer for others 

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:33.479
 try to pick up the phones 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.790
 nobody wants to take his 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.590
 time do not show up wait 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.210
 that you are asked for his passes and 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.650
 pass up to a particular moment where there is 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.259
 a wall then this wall there that what 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:46.110
 she is potentially an assistant 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:49.079
 but it's not the worst the worst is the 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.820
 answering this mail wants one round 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.710
 do it a message or not so yes 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.770
 so yes now the rules have 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.780
 changed I say yes left a message this 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.189
 message you present yourself do you 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.479
 a pitch of your business and tells you 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.009
 do not worry i'll call you back 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.570
 which makes the person who is 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.500
 always ultra overflow the 35 hours 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.149
 have done everything to be 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.530
 extremely overflow which makes that the 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.720
 pair 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.220
 that's what you do she understood 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.470
 quickly what you will do and 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.510
 when you will be able to remember it 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.860
 will be a lot simpler to go to a 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.930
 just a little bit further than his true 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.600
 pitch is a long message to extend where 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.459
 we stammer a little bit and it's a trick 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.300
 makes you want something that you present 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:25.010
 something you say here is 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.200
 absolutely we speak to each other I have this 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.250
 offer I'm going to remind you I'm going 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.959
 have you on the phone 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.550
 do not worry it's a pleasure 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:32.959
 to be able to discuss together so 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:33.440
 not really miss on the 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:35.030
 answering machine 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.709
 when we have the person it happens 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.110
 how then when we have the person 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:40.550
 the same thing you have to go straight to the goal 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.180
 to say you are extremely 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:44.209
 quickly 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:46.070
 and then you try directly without 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:48.260
 silence to reach the person of 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:50.720
 the hang sentence of hanging pitch that 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.580
 is working this is studying anyway 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.590
 this is real a real technical 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.239
 therefore, to search for 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.459
 anyway we will have the opportunity to 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:59.630
 come back on all these strategies for 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:02.150
 better sell in his chronicles 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:04.819
