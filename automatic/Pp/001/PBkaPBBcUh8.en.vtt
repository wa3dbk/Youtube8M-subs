00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:17.280
 we are all in a new video and 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.490
 we are in the periods that I am going to give you 

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:23.340
 to be able to grow on youtube which 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.650
 as vital youtube grow so we go 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.810
 to it first we have to have good 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.939
 quality videos are I worth to edit and 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.850
 I use I love I study 8 and 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.470
 the sony vegas pro second have fears 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.300
 in the videos I already know that not only put 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.460
 thumbnails but more than anything because no 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.590
 I have time and if you want minutes 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:46.060
 own doing it with photoshop 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:48.430
 third good quality videos so 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:50.770
 I think what has already been said but it is convenient 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:53.860
 is the most important of all we have 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:57.070
 to have for videos that are so 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:59.170
 minus 720p or 1080p since people are 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:01.510
 it calls more attention to have a good 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:05.770
 clarity in the voice that is to say has a 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:07.450
 good microphone because if you have the voice 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.250
 he is listening well because he was called more 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.869
 attention to people and your videos 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.060
 because he continues to hear badly he had to is 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:16.170
 uncomfortable 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:19.170
 and third do I think make a channel 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.060
 of what you like so for example does 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.970
 it's a gaming channel and all this the 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.590
 games those videos usually they 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.270
 does the best to follow I do not know if what 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.000
 do you paint for example always 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.250
 you will like to play games and so 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
 so much the better 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.000
 third 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:42.229
 the next one would be for example to be more 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.060
 stuck to the public is to say not to speak 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:47.000
 for you but as if they were 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.710
 seeing and saying things that come to him 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.420
 well to subscribers because they 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.610
 a video is being made 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.310
 say then I or I say lies recommend 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.540
 what happened to make it more fun and 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:57.740
 for the last of all you're going to do 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.500
