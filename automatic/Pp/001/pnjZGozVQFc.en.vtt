 Let's take a look 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:31.390
 It is a comment from Mr. Ronpac Snatch

 When making the green noodles of cup noodles , warm it up with hot water and discard all its peculiarity instead with sesame oil 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:40.010
 Wonderland's Oh When you eat dare with mayonnaise to Cauchy 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:45.260
 Such comment comes because it is absolutely p oil soba fly though 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:48.980
 I also ate a cash register-style soup-free ramen that I recently put out in the video 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:55.460
 Now I'm addicted to ramen Toka oil near the white 4 system 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:01:01.309
 So I bought this green raccoon dog so use it today 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:03.060
 I would like to make soba noodles Yes, so let's start making it normally 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:07.860
 It's good, I guess this is surely 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:10.390
 So what do you do with this one? 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:15.000
 It is variously hot water key 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:20.740

 Nde no undue importance of discarding know letter Make the that the long-awaited 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.730
 Anyway 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.960
 Let's keep it for a while 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:38.960
 Say this 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:46.070
 On this not it be something good feeling in this hit here 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:51.690
 2 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:53.090
 Sesame oil a sound cut that hot water in BuKKon 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:58.179
 trough 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:58.179
 Even a little mayonnaise of the muffler sound now 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.200
 It is such a monk 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:04.670
 Yes 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:08.750

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.300
 Yes Asoda Well then because once this fall too good 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.600

 Let's drop that egg 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:19.480
 Stir the good chart and 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.590
 In the people of the flap 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:26.420

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.730
 What 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:34.769
 At annual 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:38.549
 Let's do around 3 minutes Yes , we made in the south waterfall 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:43.110
 Aburaso'd like to Jitsushoku

 But it's not at all oil 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:56.890
 If it was noodles with cup ramen, it would be full of oil soba noodles, so why not 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:58.840
 Only because what you do is poor of Tteyuu kana was choice those who are in it will surely that 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:04.150
 Put a repair 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:06.440
 Assumed to it is the most fat scan of me out of the soup which soaks while the 3-minute waiting 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:09.980
 On the assumption that say is I think we made Mappoku 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:12.580
 I think I would like to eat for a while because I think it may be included 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.580

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:56.390

00:03:52.970 --> 00:04:02.590
 Somewhat the king 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:04.780
 Whatever the possibility of taste is different at that time at that time because it is the amount and or three core business of mayonnaise 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:10.660

 Also tempura riding on Let's eat together this 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:22.820
 I'm glad there is a quite profitable feeling Is because there is no minute that you are riding from the front oil wrestling 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:33.470
 I 'm not the kind of tempura of crispy system and I have to boil it together normally 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:37.150
