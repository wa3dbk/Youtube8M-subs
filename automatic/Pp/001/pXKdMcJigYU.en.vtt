00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
again there s so we'll just take a poor

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:47.540 
again there s so we'll just take a poor
picture<00:02:46.440> first<00:02:46.770> of<00:02:46.920> all<00:02:47.010> then<00:02:47.190> we'll<00:02:47.250> try<00:02:47.430> and

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
picture first of all then we'll try and

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:53.860 
picture first of all then we'll try and
take<00:02:47.640> a<00:02:47.670> couple<00:02:47.880> of<00:02:48.200> faster<00:02:49.200> ones<00:02:49.670> so<00:02:50.670> I<00:02:50.700> see<00:02:50.880> it

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:03:01.240 

so<00:02:54.870> I<00:02:54.930> think<00:02:54.990> that<00:02:55.590> was<00:02:56.130> pretty<00:02:56.310> damn<00:02:56.490> quick

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:09.110 

now<00:03:02.250> I<00:03:02.280> think<00:03:02.430> you'll<00:03:02.730> agree<00:03:04.190> the<00:03:05.190> 4s<00:03:06.050> is<00:03:08.120> super

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
now I think you'll agree the 4s is super

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.920 
now I think you'll agree the 4s is super
super<00:03:09.900> fast<00:03:10.370> now<00:03:11.370> we<00:03:12.270> see<00:03:12.420> something<00:03:12.810> even

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
super fast now we see something even

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.620 
super fast now we see something even
faster<00:03:13.650> you<00:03:14.460> can<00:03:14.610> use<00:03:14.760> the<00:03:14.880> key<00:03:14.940> volume<00:03:15.300> up<00:03:15.420> one

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
faster you can use the key volume up one

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:22.250 
faster you can use the key volume up one
which<00:03:16.140> I'll<00:03:16.290> show<00:03:16.440> you<00:03:16.470> now<00:03:20.780> you<00:03:21.780> know<00:03:21.900> I<00:03:21.930> must

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
comparison you can see that reviewing a

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.469 
comparison you can see that reviewing a
couple<00:04:21.930> of<00:04:22.020> days<00:04:22.729> so<00:04:23.729> it<00:04:23.850> will<00:04:23.970> guar<00:04:24.120> there

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:24.479 
couple of days so it will guar there

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:26.960 
couple of days so it will guar there
once<00:04:25.020> again<00:04:25.260> bring<00:04:25.650> up<00:04:25.770> the<00:04:25.890> camera<00:04:26.039> here

seeing<00:05:34.440> the<00:05:34.590> picture<00:05:34.919> whether<00:05:35.100> that<00:05:35.280> makes

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:35.460 
seeing the picture whether that makes

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:36.830 
seeing the picture whether that makes
difference<00:05:35.850> or<00:05:36.000> if<00:05:36.060> it's<00:05:36.240> just<00:05:36.360> on<00:05:36.450> the<00:05:36.570> screen

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:36.840
